[0:02] I'm really enjoying it. I hope you're
[0:03] being blessed too by God's grace. I just
[0:06] love to say like brother Brandham, I
[0:08] preached what Paul preached. Hallelujah.
[0:11] I have no special revelation of my own.
[0:13] Like Perry Green told Brother Brandham,
[0:15] I just try to emphasize what's already
[0:17] been said. Brother Ram said, "That's a
[0:19] remarkable statement for a preacher to
[0:21] make. I'm not one whom the word of the
[0:23] Lord comes to." Like Perry Green told
[0:26] Brother Brandon, like you're one who the
[0:27] word of the Lord comes to a prophet. He
[0:30] said, "But it's remarkable when he says,
[0:32] I just want to emphasize what's already
[0:34] been said." Hallelujah.
[0:36] Church, if we can just emphasize what's
[0:38] already been been said in here, we're
[0:39] going to be just fine for the rapture.
[0:40] Praise God. We're going to be fit for
[0:42] heaven. No doubt, but just fine for the
[0:44] rapture. 1 Corinthians 14.
[0:49] Now, of course, if you've read ahead,
[0:50] you know, this is about mainly about
[0:52] tongues interpretation, but towards the
[0:55] end of the chapter, you know, it gets
[0:56] into this uh topic of uh women preachers
[1:01] and who the word of God comes to. So,
[1:03] it's a very uh important chapter by
[1:05] God's grace.
[1:08] And I'll just try to emphasize as I was
[1:10] studying today what the Lord uh kind of
[1:12] put on my heart. I feel things I wasn't
[1:14] planning on saying and just as I was
[1:16] waiting on the Lord, things would come
[1:17] to me as I normally do uh by the grace
[1:20] of God.
[1:22] 1 Corinthians 14, let's just read verse
[1:24] one for the sake of time here. Don't
[1:26] have to worry about Malachi getting up
[1:27] at 3 3:50 tomorrow morning because
[1:30] there's no work tomorrow by God's grace.
[1:32] At least at least probably for most of
[1:34] us, you know. Uh I'm sorry if you do
[1:36] have to work tomorrow. I don't think
[1:38] anybody does, but except the moms. They
[1:40] got to do all the cooking, right? So I
[1:41] do apologize about that. Somebody's got
[1:43] to cook and God will bless you.
[1:45] Hallelujah for all your uh efforts to
[1:48] feed your family. Praise God.
[1:51] 1 Corinthians 14:1. Let's read that on
[1:53] three. Ready? One, two, three. Follow
[1:56] after charity and desire spiritual
[1:59] gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
[2:03] May God add the blessing to the reading
[2:04] of his word. You can be seated. You can
[2:07] switch over case. I got a few notes here
[2:09] I'd like to share.
[2:22] Yeah. So, I I'll probably be sharing a
[2:23] little bit of of the testimony that I
[2:25] heard as I said on Wednesday night or
[2:28] Sunday night at Chipotle afterwards. I'm
[2:30] not going to call names now that the
[2:31] live stream's on, you know, but you know
[2:32] who I'm talking about if I do tell that
[2:34] story. I'll just say it's a precious
[2:36] couple that visited.
[2:40] So, um, we'll look at 14. We finish
[2:42] chapter 13 with, uh, the the greatest
[2:45] gift of all is charity. And brother
[2:46] Brandham said, "Thus sayith the Lord."
[2:48] Uh, charity is the only thing that's
[2:50] going to make it over to heaven. Right?
[2:52] So, we have to have love uh the love of
[2:55] Jesus Christ, the agape love of Jesus
[2:57] Christ. We've got to have that in our
[2:58] hearts. Hallelujah. In our spirits.
[3:01] Then, if we got that, then we're know we
[3:02] know we're going to make it over by
[3:03] God's grace. And brother Ram said, "Do
[3:05] all everything that's in your power to
[3:06] lay aside anything that will hinder you
[3:08] from loving." He said, "Even those who
[3:11] hate you." Hallelujah. Because that's
[3:13] real love. Jesus said, "Father, forgive
[3:15] them. They don't know what they do." Uh
[3:17] remember Stephen said, "Lord, lay it not
[3:18] to their charge." Right? So the real
[3:20] Christian spirit is God forgive them.
[3:23] Lord, don't lay it to their charge. God
[3:25] have mercy on them. That should be our
[3:27] spirit as well as Christians. God have
[3:29] mercy on our enemies. Hallelujah.
[3:33] That's right. Now,
[3:35] we'll look here at uh we'll just I like
[3:37] to go three verses at a time and uh stop
[3:39] and just for a sake of the they're easy
[3:42] to read. They're legible by the grace of
[3:45] the Lord. Uh but verse one says, "Follow
[3:48] after charity and desire spiritual
[3:50] gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
[3:54] And I think that's why, you know, today
[3:55] there's this uh group called the N. They
[3:58] call themselves the New Apostolic
[4:00] Reformation, but they're not real
[4:01] apostles. But they they they they
[4:04] practice even at their schools. They
[4:05] admit they practice they tell the the
[4:08] false prophets just prophesy over
[4:11] people. Right now the the idea they get
[4:15] that from they have a school of prophets
[4:17] which there was a school of prophets in
[4:18] the Bible in the Old Testament not the
[4:20] New Testament in the Old Testament. It
[4:22] was also the sons of the prophets as I
[4:25] was reading in Kings. But the this false
[4:28] school today says you can't even make it
[4:30] to the second year of schooling unless
[4:32] you miss three times on your prophecies.
[4:35] That's a requirement. And yet the Bible
[4:37] says if you miss one in the Old
[4:39] Testament, you die.
[4:42] So
[4:44] you know this is uh they see they have
[4:46] they have the right understanding as as
[4:48] far as prophecy is very important. But
[4:50] then when they allow you to miss that's
[4:53] against the word of God. That's an
[4:54] antichrist spirit. It's a lying spirit
[4:56] at the very least, right? Because God
[4:58] does not lie. Okay? And so, and it's
[5:02] it's it's it's good too that they desire
[5:04] gifts. And and you know, a lot of people
[5:05] a lot of people go that way because they
[5:07] go to denominations and and sadly some
[5:09] denominations, they don't even pray for
[5:10] miracles or they don't pray for
[5:12] supernatural, right? They're just so
[5:13] into their organization and their
[5:16] liturgy or their tradition or whatever,
[5:18] they don't even pray for miracles. So
[5:21] just the fact that they're trying to get
[5:23] miracles that attracts some people.
[5:25] Okay. But uh uh but to believe things
[5:28] like that, you've got to take a a lying
[5:30] spirit. The Bible calls it a seducing
[5:32] spirit. You got to be seduced into
[5:34] believing prophets can miss because the
[5:37] Bible's clear. A prophet cannot miss.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; There's only one questionable time and
[5:41] that was Isaiah, right? He had thus
[5:42] sayith the Lord. But it's not
[5:44] questionable for us. It's just it's just
[5:45] hard for us to understand. How could God
[5:48] change it from, you know, Hezekiah, set
[5:50] your house in order? Well, now you get
[5:52] to live. Well, we just know it's the
[5:53] perfect will versus the permissive will
[5:55] of God.
[5:57] But it's not easy to understand. And I'm
[5:59] to this day, I'm a pastor of 20 20 years
[6:02] almost, preaching 21 years. I still
[6:03] can't explain it, but I believe it.
[6:05] Hallelujah. I just know there's very few
[6:07] cases like that. And if you look at
[6:09] Isaiah's life and his his his range of
[6:12] testimonies, you would know he was a
[6:13] true prophet of God. Hallelujah. So
[6:16] anyways,
[6:18] and pardon me. I'm still battling
[6:19] recovering from this cold, but I feel a
[6:21] lot better by God's grace. I appreciate
[6:22] anyone that prayed for me. Um, so we get
[6:24] it. We get this pattern. Love is the
[6:26] most important thing. Follow after love.
[6:28] Make sure you're in love with everybody
[6:30] in the church.
[6:32] Then desire gifts. So in other words, we
[6:35] shouldn't be even caring about gifts
[6:36] until we love everybody in the church
[6:39] because it's just going to be a tinkling
[6:40] symbol. It's just going to be beat in
[6:41] the air. It's just going to be uh a
[6:44] total waste of time, right? Uh unless
[6:47] you love everybody in the church first.
[6:49] You have to love the people of God.
[6:51] Hallelujah. So ha have your heart full
[6:53] of God's love and then desire spiritual
[6:56] gifts and desire the best gifts which
[6:58] are prophecy.
[7:02] For he that speaketh in unknown tongues
[7:03] speaketh not unto men but unto God.
[7:05] Isn't that interesting? uh people that
[7:07] have the gift of tongues and even the
[7:09] ones I've talked to um they've even said
[7:12] they feel like they're talking to God.
[7:14] In other words, the Bible said they're
[7:16] groanings. They're uttering their
[7:17] groanings.
[7:18] So, a lot of times the people who have
[7:20] the gift of tongues, they're prayer
[7:22] warriors and they're making groanings to
[7:25] God and they're actually talking to God
[7:26] when they're speaking in tongues.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Now, think about that. They're speaking
[7:30] in tongues they don't know. And God's
[7:32] understanding those tongues that they
[7:34] don't know. And then they don't even
[7:36] know what they're praying for. But God
[7:38] knows.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that interesting that God would do
[7:41] that? He's going to let you say
[7:43] something you don't understand. Pouring
[7:46] out your heart, but you don't understand
[7:47] it, but God understands it.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Why does God do that? It keeps the
[7:53] supernatural element alive, right? just
[7:55] shows in other words, I'm taking control
[7:57] of you and I'm using you to intercede
[8:00] for others, right? Or yourself because
[8:02] it could be praying for yourself. So,
[8:04] it's it's a beautiful thought to think
[8:06] about that. Wow, you're speaking to God
[8:07] with these unknown tongues. You don't
[8:09] even know what you're saying, but you
[8:10] all you know is you're pouring out your
[8:12] heart to God.
[8:15] So, when you speak in unknown tongue,
[8:16] the Bible said no man understands him.
[8:19] How be it in the spirit he speaketh
[8:21] mystery. So, even there's an element
[8:22] there. you could you're speaking a
[8:24] mysterious thing that only God knows.
[8:28] So, it's really just God understanding
[8:30] that mystery.
[8:31] Okay. So, children, if you ever speak in
[8:33] tongue, now I never have. I've asked God
[8:34] to do it many times, but I know numerous
[8:37] people who have. But if you ever start
[8:38] speaking in tongues, Brother Ram said it
[8:40] would just happen. Brother Ram said the
[8:41] first time he spoke in tongues, he was
[8:42] just walking along the power lines
[8:44] because he was he worked for the power
[8:45] company, right? And he's just singing,
[8:47] "I'm one of them. I'm one." And he's
[8:49] just singing all day long. And pretty
[8:51] soon he started speaking in tongues. So
[8:54] just be aware the Bible and the Bible
[8:56] said be filled with the spirit right in
[8:57] Ephesians chapter 4 praying in hymns and
[9:00] songs and spiritual songs. But if you
[9:03] ever have that happen to you just
[9:04] realize it's just God moving on you so
[9:07] you can make groanings or speak some
[9:10] mystery
[9:12] right now. I don't can't explain that
[9:14] but that's what the Bible says. speaking
[9:16] some mystery to God.
[9:20] Now, he that prophesieth speaketh unto
[9:22] men to edification, exhortation, and
[9:25] comfort. Now, in our church, we mainly
[9:26] seen it with dreams as prophetic, but I
[9:29] have shared a couple uh prophecies that
[9:32] I've heard, like the one where the
[9:34] brother said numerous well-known uh
[9:38] pastors are going to die this year in
[9:40] 2013. And there was about five worldwide
[9:42] famous pastors that died that year. And
[9:45] so that was thus sayith the Lord. So
[9:47] I've shared that with other people. Uh
[9:48] but that now the Bible said that should
[9:51] be for one of these either edification,
[9:53] exhortation or comfort. So one of those
[9:57] now I'm looking at it and I'll define
[9:58] those words next.
[10:01] To me I don't know it would must be
[10:03] edification because I don't I didn't
[10:05] know the pastors and so when they died I
[10:08] didn't know them. It didn't give me
[10:09] comfort, you know. So I imagine it would
[10:11] be edification. So let's look at these
[10:12] definitions. Edification means building
[10:14] up or promoting growth. Well, u it's sad
[10:17] to see people die, right? You never want
[10:19] to see people die, but if God tells you
[10:20] beforehand, that would make you trust
[10:22] God more, right? You would say, "Wow, I
[10:26] that raises my faith, right?" And even
[10:29] in the dreams, you know, when we've had
[10:31] dreams, and this week I dreamed about
[10:32] two preachers. I told my wife about it.
[10:35] Like, I don't always dream about
[10:37] preachers, but they were just really
[10:39] vivid. So, the second one wasn't very
[10:41] good. One of them visited our church and
[10:43] and it was so weird. I was studying
[10:45] while the preacher sitting there when
[10:46] we're supposed to be having service and
[10:48] then our uh our machine wouldn't work.
[10:50] You know, our we couldn't get the words
[10:51] up there and the preacher just sitting
[10:53] there like like I don't study during the
[10:55] sermon. I study before the sermon.
[10:59] So, I don't know if it was just the
[11:00] busyiness of life or something. Uh I
[11:02] don't know. You just never know. But
[11:04] sometimes dreams are just nonsense,
[11:06] right? They're just the Bible said
[11:08] because of busyness. you get all these
[11:10] thoughts together. But as far as that
[11:12] prophecy about um you know pastors or
[11:15] preachers passing away that would I
[11:17] imagine that would build up your faith
[11:18] that would that promoted my faith in the
[11:20] gift of prophecy. And then the dreams
[11:23] that have come to pass that makes us pay
[11:25] special attention to dreams that we have
[11:27] now.
[11:29] And that's why we write down dreams. You
[11:30] ought to if you don't you ought to write
[11:32] down dreams and see if they will come to
[11:34] pass. Uh because I've had numerous ones.
[11:37] My wife's had numerous ones that come to
[11:38] pass. So, you just want to get in the
[11:40] habit of right doing that because it
[11:42] could be God. Brother Bram said when
[11:43] there's no one there's when there's no
[11:45] prophet in the land, God has to give a
[11:47] prophecy through a dream. And the
[11:49] example was Joseph and Mary. When Joseph
[11:51] was there, there hadn't been a prophet
[11:52] for 500 years since Malachi. And so, how
[11:55] does God speak? He's got to speak
[11:56] through a dream.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; So, expect God to speak to you in a
[11:59] dream if he's going to do something
[12:00] prophetic, right? Um exhortation was
[12:04] encouragement or refreshment. Now,
[12:06] people dying, that's not really
[12:07] refreshing to me. People dying, that's
[12:09] not really encouragement to me. I mean,
[12:11] it's I guess it's encouraging that a
[12:12] prophecy came to pass and I got to hear
[12:14] it. Um, but I would say this one seems
[12:17] to be edification, like building up our
[12:19] faith in the prophetic. And then comfort
[12:22] is calming or stimulating. Uh, so
[12:25] prophecy is supposed to go out to
[12:27] stimulate us or calm us to know that
[12:29] God's got everything under control.
[12:33] Now verse four, he that speaketh in an
[12:35] unknown tongue edifies himself. So
[12:37] again, young children or even our adults
[12:40] here, even myself, if God would let me
[12:42] speak in a tongue, I would I would be
[12:43] realizing, wow, God's trying to edify
[12:45] me. God is trying to build me up or
[12:48] promote my growth. And that's why, you
[12:50] know, brother Ram said, uh, you know,
[12:52] that's why Paul said he wish everybody
[12:54] spoke in tonesues because it builds you
[12:55] up. That's why I've asked God to speak
[12:57] in tonesues. I would like to, uh,
[13:00] because it would edify me. But then the
[13:01] Bible says, "Do all speak with tongues?"
[13:04] I mean, who wouldn't like to lay hands
[13:05] on the sick and see them recover? But
[13:06] but do all have the gifts of healing?
[13:08] Who wouldn't like to travel and preach
[13:11] and start a church? Who wouldn't like to
[13:13] do that? But the Bible said, "Not all
[13:15] are apostles."
[13:17] &gt;&gt; So, you just got to stay in the channel,
[13:20] stay dedicated, consecrated to God, and
[13:21] God will manifest the gifts in this time
[13:23] and season.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; So, if you speak in tongues, you edify
[13:27] yourself. But if you prophesy, you edify
[13:30] the church. I'm sorry if I bumped that.
[13:33] I would that ye all Yeah, here's where
[13:35] Paul says it. I wish you all spoke with
[13:37] tongues. Or you got built up and
[13:39] edified. But rather that you prophesied.
[13:42] I'd rather have everybody prophesy and
[13:43] dream dreams that are prophetic. Sorry.
[13:46] For greater is he that prophesies than
[13:48] he that speaketh with tongues, except he
[13:50] interpret that the church may receive
[13:52] edifying.
[13:56] Okay. So, uh, it's greater, it's a
[13:58] greater gift to edify everybody in the
[14:00] church. We'd much rather do that than
[14:03] just have one person who got all the
[14:04] edification.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; You know, one person's feeling, one, one
[14:08] person is feeling uh, I'm build up. I'm
[14:10] built up. That's good, but God wants
[14:12] everybody to be built up, right? Let's
[14:14] not be selfish with I just want to get
[14:16] built up myself. Uh, we we should pray
[14:19] for God, give us a prophecy, God. Uh and
[14:22] we've had things that were prophetic
[14:24] like you know we've talked about
[14:25] recently where uh you know God has just
[14:28] told us things in advance what was going
[14:30] to happen
[14:32] even through sermons. So we can rejoice
[14:34] in that that God sees our situation. God
[14:37] knows us.
[14:39] Um, so we want we want everyone to be
[14:42] built up and we want we want to see
[14:44] everybody grow in the spiritual realm.
[14:46] And the more uh prophecies there are,
[14:49] which there are very few, but the more
[14:50] there are, the more people get built up
[14:52] and strengthened and edified. Now,
[14:55] brethren, if I come unto you speaking in
[14:56] tongues, what shall I profit you except
[14:59] I shall speak to you either by
[15:00] revelation or by knowledge or by
[15:03] prophesying or by doctrine?
[15:08] Now Paul in earlier in the book I
[15:11] remembered as I was studying that Paul
[15:13] said he didn't want to come short of any
[15:15] gift in the church. So 1 Corinthians
[15:19] verse uh 1 verse 5 that in everything ye
[15:21] are enriched by him in all utterance and
[15:24] in all knowledge.
[15:26] So Paul says Jesus enriches your life.
[15:30] If you're not if your life's not
[15:31] enriched, you got to get more in contact
[15:33] with Jesus.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; He makes your life sweeter. The Bible
[15:36] remember that song says he gets sweeter
[15:38] and sweeter as a day go by. Is that
[15:40] right, brother Rod? Is that right,
[15:42] brother Sister Beatatrice? All these
[15:44] years of serving the Lord all these
[15:45] decades. Is that right? He gets sweeter
[15:46] and sweeter. Right. He enriches your
[15:49] life. Your life gets more enriching the
[15:51] more time you spend with the Lord. Even
[15:53] as the testimony of Christ was confirmed
[15:55] in you so that you come behind in no
[15:58] gift waiting for the coming of our Lord
[16:02] Jesus Christ. So the Corinthians did not
[16:04] lack any gift. Okay? But as brother
[16:09] Random points out, notice uh Paul
[16:11] doesn't address gifts with the Ephesian
[16:13] church, the Philippian church, right?
[16:14] All Thessalonans, he doesn't address it.
[16:17] And brother Ram says because they had
[16:19] the gifts in order. They weren't uh they
[16:22] weren't majoring on gifts and they
[16:24] didn't have the gifts out of order. So
[16:27] Paul didn't have to address them, right?
[16:30] regarding the gifts. But Paul has to
[16:33] address it here. And Paul says, "What am
[16:36] I going to profit by speak in tongues
[16:37] except I give you a revelation or
[16:40] knowledge or prophesying or by
[16:42] doctrine." So this is really awesome as
[16:45] well. A tongue could give a revelation
[16:48] either of someone's life or of the
[16:49] scripture. It could give knowledge of
[16:51] the scripture or someone's life. It
[16:53] could prophesy of the scripture or
[16:55] someone's life. Or it could give you
[16:57] doctrine from the scripture. Doctrine is
[16:59] instruction.
[17:00] So uh this is how people are profited.
[17:03] You are profited when God gives a
[17:04] revelation at church or God gives
[17:06] knowledge at church or he prophesies at
[17:09] church or gives a doctrine at church.
[17:11] That should edify you. That should
[17:13] profit you. Hallelujah.
[17:16] And so uh regarding the brother and I
[17:18] I'm not sure why I had that on there. Uh
[17:21] oh yeah, I guess you know um I'll just
[17:24] share the brother's testimony real
[17:25] quick. Uh for all these years he was
[17:27] against interracial marriage. He would
[17:29] he would have been the one that would
[17:30] have said no way, impossible.
[17:33] Uh,
[17:35] Brother Ram said this, you know, Brother
[17:36] Ram said that, which he did, but Brother
[17:37] Ram was at a time when uh there was a
[17:39] lot of racial tensions and when it was
[17:41] illegal to have interracial marriage,
[17:43] right? So, you got to take the context.
[17:45] And church, if if you just looked at the
[17:47] Bible, if anybody just read their Bible
[17:48] under the Holy Spirit, they'd never find
[17:50] a ban against interracial marriage. If I
[17:52] said if they're reading by the Holy
[17:54] Spirit,
[17:56] &gt;&gt; right? If you're reading by the Holy
[17:57] Spirit, believing just what the Bible
[17:59] says, you would never see a ban against
[18:01] interracial marriage. There's a ban
[18:02] against interfaith marriages
[18:05] &gt;&gt; or faith and no faith marriages like
[18:08] Ahab, but he he really had no faith to
[18:11] begin with anyway. I mean, he had a
[18:12] little bit, right, when he repented one
[18:14] little time.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Uh, and God told Elijah, "Look at him.
[18:17] Even he repents." But then he turned
[18:18] right around and does the opposite
[18:20] later. He backslid, of course, but
[18:23] that's all that God does. But so the
[18:27] brother told the testimonies were
[18:28] sitting there. Were any of my children
[18:30] with me? Yeah, that's right. Two. I
[18:31] don't know if you remember or not, but
[18:33] he was saying God gave him numerous uh
[18:36] voices and then numerous uh dreams about
[18:39] this subject of interracial marriage.
[18:41] And he said as soon as God revealed it
[18:43] to him, he said he popped on YouTube and
[18:45] then my video popped up right right
[18:46] there. And uh again, he was one totally
[18:50] against it. But then as God and he kept
[18:52] saying and he would pray and say, "God,
[18:54] show me. Is this you? Is this you? And
[18:55] God gave him a sign after a sign. I
[18:57] said, "This is like Gideon where you lay
[18:58] a fleece and you ask God for this and
[19:00] this." And then God eventually changed
[19:02] the situation.
[19:03] So, and I told him, my brother, I said,
[19:05] I didn't teach that. I didn't get that
[19:07] until I fasted and pray to understand
[19:09] interracial marriage because it was so
[19:11] hard for me to understand. Why do I read
[19:13] in the Bible this and brother Ram will
[19:15] say this, right? But of course, we know
[19:17] brother Ram never said, "Thus sayith the
[19:19] Lord with this." He never even even used
[19:21] a Bible verse that I can find.
[19:24] Right? And then brother Ram called Moses
[19:26] and Zapora. He called that was perfect.
[19:28] That's a perfect marriage and that was
[19:30] God's choice. Now you can't get no
[19:32] better than God. Right? Nobody chooses
[19:35] better than God. Right? And then brother
[19:38] Ram says I he said I can't explain it.
[19:40] He said I just believe it. That's what
[19:41] brother Ram said about Moses and Zapora.
[19:43] So, it's clear, you know, he had his he
[19:46] had his beliefs, but he it's clear when
[19:48] he looked at the Bible, it was always it
[19:50] was always right in the Bible when two
[19:52] believers, no matter what races or what
[19:54] nation they come from, as long as
[19:55] they're believers, only in the Lord can
[19:58] you marry. All right? So, I thought that
[20:01] was beautiful. Our brother is getting
[20:02] revelations and words. He's hearing from
[20:04] God and dreams. He gets it that way. Uh
[20:08] I got it through doctrine.
[20:11] But we come together and then God uh oh
[20:14] yeah and it was answered and then there
[20:15] was all these testimonies with the wife
[20:16] prayed about it as well and just God
[20:18] brought it together. So it's very
[20:20] beautiful just to see how God uses gifts
[20:22] of the Holy Ghost
[20:24] and even things without life uh giving
[20:27] sound whether pipe or harp except they
[20:30] give a distinction the sounds how shall
[20:32] be known what is piped or harped. Okay
[20:36] so now he's going to get into tongues.
[20:38] So there must with every tongue there
[20:40] must be a distinction in it. Okay? Uh in
[20:43] other words, you must be able to tell it
[20:45] tell that tongue from a different
[20:47] tongue. Now, now I'm talking about
[20:48] languages, right? So we know English was
[20:50] different from Spanish and French. There
[20:52] has to be a distinction of the sounds.
[20:55] For if the trumpet give a uncertain
[20:57] sound, brother Ram preached this sermon
[20:59] seven times at least
[21:02] uncertain sound. Who shall prepare
[21:03] himself for battle? Hallelujah.
[21:07] So, uh, we're going to get this idea.
[21:09] God doesn't deal with uncertain sounds,
[21:11] right? God's going to give you a certain
[21:13] sound. God's going to give you something
[21:16] that you can understand.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, God may hide something
[21:19] like the he Jesus hid things from the
[21:21] disciples, right? They asked him, "When
[21:23] is the time and season?" He says, "Not
[21:24] for you to know it." Right? When Israel
[21:26] gets its power back. Hallelujah. So,
[21:29] there are some things God won't let us
[21:30] understand. But if God does give us
[21:32] something, it's going to be a certain
[21:34] sound.
[21:35] Hallelujah.
[21:37] So likewise ye, except ye utter by the
[21:39] tongue words easy to be understood. Now
[21:42] church, that's why I've always said, if
[21:44] I say something you don't understand,
[21:45] ask me at the Bible study. I want to
[21:48] utter things that are so easy to
[21:50] understand.
[21:51] Hallelujah. Because that that's what we
[21:54] should we we should strive to make it so
[21:56] easy a child could receive it.
[22:00] How shall it be known what is spoken?
[22:02] For ye shall speak into the air. So now
[22:05] we get this idea of people speaking in
[22:07] tongues with no interpreter, right? And
[22:09] Paul says it's just like you're speaking
[22:11] into the air, just kind of filling up
[22:13] the air with noise if we don't
[22:16] understand what's being said.
[22:19] Now just I just wanted to give you one
[22:21] of the highlights of those seven
[22:24] uncertain sound sermons if you haven't
[22:26] yet. Okay, brother said why he's at the
[22:29] prayer line. Why Jesus is here. It's the
[22:31] Holy Ghost himself. Just keep standing.
[22:33] Just keep standing. Just keep on your
[22:35] feet. All that wants the baptism of the
[22:37] Holy Ghost that hasn't received it,
[22:38] believe you can receive it tonight.
[22:40] Stand up on your feet. Just receive it.
[22:42] Good. No uncertain sound about that now.
[22:46] Right. Remember, blessed are ye that do
[22:48] hunger and thirst for righteousness, for
[22:50] they shall be filled. Nothing uncertain
[22:53] about what Jesus said. Amen. Ain't that
[22:56] beautiful? So, brother talks about how
[22:58] there there's all these uncertain sounds
[22:59] like coming from denominations or or
[23:02] non-denominational deceivers, false
[23:04] teachers, false doctrines, right? But
[23:06] brother says Jesus's words are a certain
[23:09] sound.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; If you really hunger and thirst for the
[23:13] Holy Ghost, you'll receive it.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; I want to be born again. I want the
[23:17] power of God in my life. I want to be
[23:19] changed. I want to be a witness for
[23:20] Jesus Christ. If you keep hungering like
[23:22] that, he's going to fill you with the
[23:23] Holy Ghost. Just make sure you're
[23:25] baptized the right way. Amen. And then
[23:27] if you're not baptized, he can still
[23:28] fill you. But as soon as you get filled,
[23:30] Peter would command you to go be
[23:31] baptized in the name of the Lord.
[23:33] Hallelujah.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Because that's what he did at the house
[23:35] of Cornelius. Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:39] So here, this is the point. This is a
[23:41] highlight of the uncertain sound.
[23:43] There's a certain sound and the certain
[23:45] sound is the word of God. Hallelujah.
[23:47] This is a certain sound. If it's in here
[23:49] and it's it's rightly divided, it's
[23:50] certain.
[23:54] Now moving on to verse 10. There are may
[23:56] be so many kinds of voices in the world,
[23:58] and none of them is without
[24:00] signification.
[24:02] Therefore, if I know not the meaning of
[24:04] the voice, I shall be unto him that
[24:06] speaketh a barbarian.
[24:08] So again, speaking of unknown tongues,
[24:12] if it's if there's no interpretation,
[24:14] Paul says it becomes barbarian. It's
[24:16] like a barbarian. Uh and he that
[24:19] speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
[24:20] Now, who's he talking to? He's talking
[24:21] to the Corinthian church.
[24:24] So, this church would be a church that
[24:25] would just let everybody and as many as
[24:28] you wanted, any unknown tongues could go
[24:30] forth. And Paul's telling them, you're
[24:31] setting up a situation where everyone's
[24:33] like a barbarian to one another.
[24:36] Now, they may they weren't barbarians.
[24:38] They were in the house of God. But it
[24:40] creates the situation when there's no
[24:41] interpretation that we're just putting
[24:43] words in the air and no one knows what's
[24:45] being said.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; That's a great point, Brother Random
[24:48] made. It was so beautiful. And that he
[24:49] called it the the debate over the debate
[24:51] with tongues.
[24:54] Uh brother Bram made that beautiful
[24:55] point. Brother Brham said if we don't
[24:57] get the interpretation of the tongue
[24:59] then there's no way to know where it
[25:01] came from.
[25:03] That was a powerful point. Right?
[25:06] Because any because if if you if you
[25:07] don't know the interpretation well
[25:08] anybody can just make up any unknown
[25:11] language.
[25:12] They can just create sounds and put
[25:14] sounds together. If you don't get the
[25:16] interpretation, you don't know where it
[25:18] comes from. And then that can't be the
[25:20] evidence of the Holy Ghost because you
[25:22] don't know which spirit that came from,
[25:24] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost or the unholy ghost.
[25:26] Which one did it come from? Right? It's
[25:28] a beautiful point from God's prophet and
[25:30] use that in the debate.
[25:33] And of course, they couldn't answer
[25:34] that. So, they had to change question.
[25:35] Well, on to the next question, right?
[25:40] Because anybody then can claim they've
[25:42] got the Holy Ghost as long as they said
[25:44] some words that no one understood. They
[25:46] can claim it. But but you can't. That's
[25:48] why tongues is not the evidence.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; You have to have an experience. You have
[25:52] to have an experience that you can
[25:54] anchor in. Right? You got to have a
[25:55] moment when you receive power.
[25:57] Hallelujah. And then your life the life
[25:59] after that will prove whether you got it
[26:01] or not.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; So he says uh he that speaketh shall be
[26:07] a barbarian unto me. In other words, we
[26:08] don't we we can't understand what's
[26:10] happening here.
[26:12] Even so, and then remember there's no
[26:14] edification going on, right? Though the
[26:16] listener is not build up by the unknown
[26:18] tongue if they don't understand what's
[26:20] being said. Even so, ye for as much as
[26:23] you're zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
[26:25] that ye may excel to the edifying of the
[26:27] church.
[26:29] So, some churches sadly are filled with
[26:31] pretending barbarian-like people. Right?
[26:34] And that's what I was saying. You know,
[26:35] I went to that church and I went to the
[26:38] church and and the pastor said, "Now
[26:40] let's all pray in tonesues and everybody
[26:41] prays in tonesues and there in that
[26:43] within that church within two years
[26:45] there was numerous adulteries in that
[26:47] church and then people left that church
[26:50] no longer serve God. You know you just
[26:53] uh you know uh people just aren't taught
[26:56] the right way and right and then I told
[26:58] you that story my friend his name was
[26:59] Greg the pastor shoved the mic in his
[27:02] face and said did you receive the Holy
[27:03] Ghost in front of the entire church and
[27:05] he was nervous so he said yes. He said,
[27:07] ' Then speak in tonesues.' And he
[27:09] pretended to speak in tonesues. And he
[27:11] he confessed to me with tears the night
[27:14] before we played Eastern Michigan up in
[27:15] Michigan before a football game. Boy, we
[27:18] were really studying for the game hard,
[27:19] weren't we? I was playing a different
[27:22] game. Hallelujah. And not a game. I was
[27:25] fighting a battle. Hallelujah.
[27:27] We should have been up. We should have
[27:29] been up studying the film. And we had
[27:31] more important things to talk about. The
[27:32] Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And the
[27:36] next day, God gave me an interception.
[27:37] Praise God. But then I that's when I
[27:40] broke my uh AC joint there the second
[27:42] time. And I'm like, "Okay, I'm done.
[27:44] Time for surgery." Uh but anyways,
[27:47] that's the point. You know, uh they
[27:48] would go to these church, you know, we
[27:50] go to these churches or different places
[27:51] and everybody's just giving unknown
[27:54] words into the air and the Bible said
[27:56] there's no there's no edification to
[27:58] that.
[28:00] Seek that you may excel to the edifying
[28:02] of the church. Okay. So, zeal is good,
[28:04] but we got to use it for the benefit of
[28:06] others.
[28:08] Wherefore, let him that speaketh in an
[28:09] unknown tongue pray that he may
[28:11] interpret. Now, this is I remember, you
[28:14] know, talking to this to my friends when
[28:16] I visit their church. I I I said when
[28:19] when are we going to pray for the
[28:20] interpretation of those tongues? And so,
[28:23] they don't they just don't. Well, that's
[28:25] breaking the commandments of Paul right
[28:27] here. Remember later in the chapter, he
[28:29] says, "These are not commandments from
[28:31] me. These are commandments from the
[28:32] Lord. Okay. So, and we've had unknown
[28:36] tongues in our church, I think, three
[28:37] times over the years. And each time,
[28:39] remember, I stopped and said, "Let's
[28:40] pray for their interpretation." I set my
[28:42] timer on my watch and it was like 10
[28:43] minutes. I said, "Well, we didn't get
[28:44] the interpretation. Praise the Lord."
[28:47] That's fine. But at least we prayed for
[28:48] it. The one time we had interpret
[28:51] interpretation was Easter of 2010. I
[28:53] wasn't here. And the brother interpreted
[28:55] the tongue himself. And the tongue was
[28:58] uh the the tongue interpretation said uh
[29:01] you're spiritually dying. It's time to
[29:02] repent. And so I went and I went and
[29:04] talked to the the whole church and three
[29:06] people said that was for them. So that's
[29:08] why I believe that was exactly right
[29:11] because people said they were
[29:12] spiritually dying.
[29:14] Now it was pretty sad. They're
[29:15] spiritually dying, but I was spiritually
[29:16] living. You know, it just church, you
[29:19] can't let yourself die. You've got to
[29:20] you got to get out of that rut. You got
[29:23] to get some life back in you.
[29:24] Hallelujah. Repent. Seek God. Silence
[29:26] every voice. Go on a uh go on a digital
[29:29] detox or whatever you got to do or maybe
[29:31] a physical detox,
[29:32] &gt;&gt; right? Stop eating the wrong food like I
[29:34] showed you uh with my picture of me. I
[29:37] ate too many wrong foods, you know?
[29:40] But in other words, we're responsible
[29:42] for staying alive, keeping our fire
[29:44] burning for Jesus. Now, if I pray in an
[29:46] unknown tongue, my spirit prayth, but my
[29:48] understanding is unfruitful.
[29:51] Okay. But what is it? So Paul says,
[29:53] "What is it then?" So what's the whole
[29:54] point of this? I will pray with the
[29:56] spirit and I'll pray with the
[29:57] understanding also.
[29:59] I'll sing with the spirit and I'll sing
[30:01] with understanding also. Now I've never
[30:03] heard it, but brother Ram talked about
[30:04] people singing in tonesues. You can even
[30:07] sing in tonesues. And Paul says that's
[30:09] good. But he also said sing with
[30:11] understanding too. Pray in tonesues, but
[30:14] also pray in understanding as well.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:19] else when thou shalt bless with the
[30:21] spirit, how shall he that occupyth room?
[30:23] So he's talking about now he's talking
[30:24] about the room of the believers,
[30:28] how shall they say amen at the giving of
[30:31] thanks, seeing he understandeth not what
[30:32] thou sayest. So church, we don't have
[30:35] tongues a lot, right? You know, we've
[30:36] only had it three or four time four
[30:38] times in our whole 20 almost 20 years.
[30:41] Okay?
[30:43] But the Bible says don't say amen unless
[30:45] you understand what it means. That's
[30:47] right.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; So, you know that. But now, let's apply
[30:50] this just to regular preaching. If you
[30:51] don't understand something, church,
[30:52] don't feel bad to say amen.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Don't say, don't feel bad if
[30:56] you're not going to say amen. If you
[30:59] don't understand what the preacher's
[31:00] saying, if you don't know what I'm
[31:01] saying, I won't get offended. At least
[31:03] I'll try not to. I'll try not to get
[31:04] offended if you don't say amen. Now,
[31:07] probably recognize it's kind of quiet
[31:08] now. Can somebody ask me a question
[31:10] after service? What did I say that was
[31:12] wrong? Now, you know this. I just do
[31:14] this to be silly, right? Just like
[31:16] brother Diggs,
[31:20] &gt;&gt; I it it's just to be silly. I got I
[31:23] don't want you to say amen unless you
[31:24] understand what I'm saying. I don't want
[31:27] to be so deep, which I might
[31:30] I might you might argue is that deep or
[31:32] you being confusing. You know, is that
[31:34] deep or you just raw off the word, you
[31:35] know? You might someone might argue
[31:37] about that and debate in a good way. I'm
[31:39] talking about um but again, we get this
[31:42] idea you shouldn't say amen. So be it
[31:44] unless you understand it. Now what I've
[31:47] done over the last few years, church,
[31:48] you probably seen when there's a
[31:49] preacher and you know they're preaching
[31:51] something I disagree with. I'll just
[31:52] smile like this. Now then as soon as
[31:54] they say something good, I'll say amen
[31:57] because I don't want to discourage them,
[32:00] right? I understand we've got
[32:02] differences. You know, brothers, we
[32:04] don't we don't have to see eye to eye on
[32:06] everything. The main thing is baptism of
[32:07] the Holy Ghost, be born again, right?
[32:09] Confess your sins, get saved, right?
[32:12] But that's how I do it. As soon as he
[32:14] gets off of the the topic I don't like,
[32:16] I'll say amen, you know, because I want
[32:18] to encourage him.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say amen. If he says
[32:21] something about a theophony and you
[32:23] heard from your theophony, I won't say
[32:24] amen to that. But as soon as he gets on
[32:27] back on something good about theophony,
[32:28] amen. Come on, brother. You know,
[32:32] because we shouldn't we shouldn't be
[32:34] hypocritical and say amen to something
[32:35] if we don't understand it. Paul gives
[32:38] you a license to not say amen unless you
[32:41] understand something.
[32:45] He says, "You truly, you barely give
[32:47] thanks
[32:49] well, but the other is not edified."
[32:52] Okay, so I think that's beautiful, too.
[32:53] Right? Sometimes when people speak in
[32:55] tongues, they're just giving God a
[32:56] thanksgiving.
[32:58] Isn't that beautiful? I just think
[32:59] that's beautiful. You can groan in
[33:01] tongues, right? Groan a burden. pour out
[33:05] a burden or supplication I think is the
[33:07] correct word. Uh you can groan, you can
[33:10] give thanks and you can speak a mystery
[33:13] in unknown tongues.
[33:15] Isn't that beautiful? And you're talking
[33:18] to you and God or just talking to God.
[33:21] Now if somebody interprets it now you're
[33:23] talking to the whole church.
[33:27] Now remember church this was the
[33:29] condition they were in. There were
[33:30] people in this Corinthian church,
[33:31] tongues, tongues, tongues, tongues,
[33:33] tongues, tongue, tongues everywhere.
[33:34] Like when I was growing up, you know,
[33:36] which Oh, yeah. And I went and saw them,
[33:37] you know, at that funeral a couple weeks
[33:38] ago and uh I was thankful this Assembly
[33:42] of God Church, they got in the spirit,
[33:44] you know, they we just sang gratitude,
[33:45] you know, all my words fall. And people
[33:47] are saying, "Amen. Hallelujah." And
[33:49] they're so sincere. I'm like, "Praise
[33:50] God, they're sincere." I was like, "We
[33:52] could learn some lessons from them from
[33:54] a message church." You know, they just
[33:56] so freely got in the spirit, you know?
[33:57] They were just, "Hallelujah." I heard
[33:59] somebody speaking in tongues, you know,
[34:00] at the at the height of the song. I
[34:02] thought, "Praise God, she's getting
[34:03] edified." Now, she should hold that. She
[34:05] should learn she got to hold that until
[34:07] she gets interpretation, you know.
[34:11] Now, of course, but you know, we
[34:12] understand,
[34:15] you know, everybody has churches have
[34:16] different uh uh you know, beliefs about
[34:19] tongues and everything like that, but I
[34:20] I was blessed to hear uh that church uh
[34:23] so freely getting in the spirit of God.
[34:25] I I enjoyed that.
[34:27] And Paul says he thanks God because he
[34:30] spoke in tonesues more than anybody.
[34:33] Isn't that just inspiring, you know, to
[34:35] see that Paul spoke in tongues more than
[34:37] anybody? So, I imagine he was speaking
[34:39] some mysteries. Don't you think he was
[34:40] speaking some mysteries? He He'd been up
[34:42] to the third heaven, church. Hallelujah.
[34:44] No doubt he was speaking something
[34:46] mysterious because he had seen things
[34:48] other people hadn't seen. But he thanked
[34:51] God he spoke with tongues more than
[34:52] everybody else. Yet in the church, I'd
[34:54] rather speak five words with my
[34:56] understanding. Now, five divided by
[34:59] 10,000 is 500s of 1%.
[35:03] 500s of 1%. And then again, that means
[35:06] you break 1% of that up into a hundred
[35:09] pieces. You break that 1% 100 pieces.
[35:12] Five of those is what Paul's talking
[35:15] about, right? I'd rather have five
[35:18] words. That's a very small percentage.
[35:20] That's 99.9999
[35:23] n Paul said five words you understand is
[35:27] better than 99 so many hund
[35:30] 9,900
[35:32] 95 words you don't understand
[35:36] so what is Paul emphasizing
[35:37] understanding right spiritual growth
[35:42] he says that by my voice I might teach
[35:45] others also than 10,000 words in an
[35:47] unknown tongue
[35:50] Brethren, be not children in
[35:51] understanding. How be it in malice,
[35:53] which means the desire to injure, be
[35:55] children, but in understanding be men.
[35:58] In other words, let's not try to ever
[36:00] hurt anybody. Let's just try to build
[36:03] people up.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can I make how can I
[36:07] help our church to be more mature? How
[36:10] can I raise their faith today? I could
[36:12] preach on tongues. Amen. That would
[36:15] raise their faith right now. Sing. Try
[36:18] to sing all day tomorrow. See if you'll
[36:20] speak in tongues. Right? I mean, it's
[36:22] God's gift, right? It's all determined
[36:25] by God the Father. Hallelujah. Remember
[36:28] the Bible said in chapter 12, God
[36:30] chooses the gift for the person. I'm
[36:32] just paraphrasing, but it's God who
[36:33] chooses the gift.
[36:36] Now, later on, I'm going to tell you
[36:38] what that mark means. It means Paul's
[36:40] starting a new paragraph. It's going to
[36:41] come in important later. So, now Paul's
[36:45] going to break into a new thought. I
[36:46] can't remember the name of that. I got
[36:48] it later on my notes. So now Paul breaks
[36:50] into a different thought and the law
[36:51] it's written with with men of other
[36:54] tongues and other lips will I speak unto
[36:56] this people. And yet for all that they
[36:58] will not hear me sayeth the Lord. Now
[37:02] Paul is citing Isaiah 28:11. That's what
[37:05] Paul's citing. So this is proof Isaiah
[37:09] 28:11 was speaking of the day of
[37:11] Pentecost.
[37:13] So with stammering lips and another
[37:15] other tongues will I speak to this
[37:16] people. Right?
[37:19] And that's important because Paul says,
[37:21] "This is the rest
[37:23] wherewith you rest." Hallelujah. And
[37:26] it's the refreshing you'll be refreshed
[37:28] with.
[37:30] And that's important to prove how the
[37:32] rest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[37:34] the soul.
[37:36] The soul when you're born again in the
[37:37] New Testament, your soul rests. You're
[37:39] no longer uh trying to earn your
[37:42] salvation. You have the seal of God in
[37:44] your soul and you're resting on the
[37:45] promise of God. But boy, you're going to
[37:48] fight in your mind.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[37:51] &gt;&gt; You are going to fight the greatest
[37:53] battle ever fought in your mind. Satan's
[37:55] going to put that thought in. How do you
[37:56] know you're saved? How do you know? How
[37:58] can a saved person do that? How can a
[37:59] Holy Ghost fil person do that? Well, I
[38:02] don't know, devil. All I know is that
[38:03] I'm sealed in my soul and the blood of
[38:05] Jesus Christ was shed for all my sins,
[38:08] past, present, and future. Praise God.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all I know. Praise God. And
[38:12] all I know, devil, is that you're going
[38:14] to be burned up and annihilated in hell.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; You liar. Stop lying to me. Get behind
[38:20] me, Satan. Hey, I rebuke you in Jesus
[38:22] name. That's what you have to do. We
[38:24] have to Oh, I have to do that. We all
[38:25] have to do that.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; And now, here's a great thought, too.
[38:28] Wherefore, tongues are for a sign, not
[38:31] to them that believe.
[38:34] Okay? And this is what I told the people
[38:36] who believe tongues is evidence.
[38:38] tongues. They'll say, "Well, you got to
[38:40] speak in tonesues, so you got a sign
[38:42] that you're born again." I'm like,
[38:46] "This says it's not for a believer."
[38:50] Hallelujah. That's what I tell my
[38:51] friends. Well, you misunderstood that.
[38:54] No, that's what it says. Tongues are not
[38:57] a sign for believers,
[38:59] right? They're for those that don't
[39:01] believe. So, the day of Pentecost, they
[39:03] got the Holy Ghost. They spoke in
[39:04] tongues. Who was that sign for? It was
[39:06] for all those 17 nations out there,
[39:09] right? That's who it's for. It's not for
[39:11] the believer. They believe. They knew
[39:14] Jesus was the Messiah. They know he's
[39:17] raised from the dead. Hallelujah.
[39:18] They're believers and they're just
[39:20] speaking, right? But it's not for
[39:23] believers.
[39:25] Prophe Prophesying is for the believers.
[39:28] And the church said,
[39:29] &gt;&gt; "Amen. We want prophecy." Hallelujah.
[39:32] Right?
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Because then it'll give us exhortation,
[39:36] uh, edification or some comfort.
[39:40] Amen.
[39:42] And that's why, church, some of the
[39:44] sermons we've got that have been
[39:45] prophetic, foretelling things, that's
[39:46] why it's such a comfort to know that
[39:48] we're here and God knows we're here. God
[39:52] knows where we're at and God's he's
[39:53] going to he's going to be with us. He's
[39:55] never going to forsake us.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful to know? That's why
[39:59] prophetic things are so important. They
[40:02] keep you encouraged, right? They
[40:03] strengthen you. They stimulate you. Oh,
[40:05] God's with us. God's watching over every
[40:07] one of our moves.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are in the hand of God.
[40:10] Amen. Aren't you glad to be in the hand
[40:12] of Jehovah? Hallelujah.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why prophecy is so
[40:16] important.
[40:18] Verse 23. If therefore the whole church
[40:20] be come together into one place and all
[40:22] speak with tongues and there come those
[40:24] that are unlearned or unbelievers will
[40:26] they not say ye are mad. Okay. So
[40:30] believer unbelievers walk in if every
[40:31] there's no interpretation they'll say
[40:33] this crazy as barbarians.
[40:36] They're saying all these things and we
[40:37] don't even know what's being said. So
[40:40] Paul says you got to stop that
[40:41] Corinthian church. Right? But if all
[40:44] prophesy and there come in one that
[40:46] believeth not or one unlearned, he's
[40:49] convinced of all. I like this. He's
[40:51] judged of all. I like this church. Uh
[40:54] you know, people say, "Don't judge me.
[40:55] Don't judge me." But I want God to judge
[40:57] me in this way. In other words, I want
[40:59] God to show me uh the thoughts and
[41:02] intents of my heart.
[41:04] Right? He's not going to judge us in a
[41:07] eternal way like in you know send us
[41:09] away but he's going to judge the
[41:10] situations that in our lives
[41:14] said we go through our purgatory now.
[41:17] There is no purgatory in the future but
[41:19] says we go through it right now. We're
[41:21] getting purged right now
[41:23] &gt;&gt; or judged. Right?
[41:27] And thus are the secrets of his heart
[41:29] made manifest. So this judging is your
[41:32] secrets are judged. the contents of your
[41:35] heart are judged and you're you see, oh,
[41:37] God knows what's in my heart. God knows
[41:40] what I'm going through.
[41:43] And so fall and I like this falling
[41:45] down. See, church,
[41:48] when God does something supernatural
[41:50] like a prophecy or a dream and it comes
[41:51] to pass, it should make us so happy and
[41:53] humble, we should just fall down and
[41:55] say, "God, I love you.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; I love you, Jesus. You're so kind to do
[41:59] this for me. You're so kind to show me
[42:02] what was in my heart and life and it
[42:04] just shows me how much you care for me
[42:07] and I love you as well. I'm loving you
[42:09] back. Right? See that that's what that's
[42:11] why it's so important when God speaks to
[42:13] your situation. Fall down and give God
[42:16] some praise. Hallelujah. Fall down and
[42:18] give God some glory because it shows it
[42:21] shows that he knows about you. He cares
[42:24] about you. He hasn't forgot about you.
[42:26] He'll never forsake you.
[42:31] And then you report, right? God is in
[42:33] you of a truth.
[42:37] Like that one time I told you, you know,
[42:38] Simon preached on a Wednesday night a
[42:39] couple years ago. And I I I counted nine
[42:42] things he preached about that were
[42:44] directly about my life and he didn't
[42:46] even know it. And I just cried like a
[42:48] baby. And I met him out there in the
[42:49] parking lot. I waited my turn. Rain is
[42:52] pouring down. And I waited my turn to
[42:54] talk to him. I just said, "Simon, you
[42:56] don't ever doubt that you're called to
[42:57] preach because I have never had my life
[42:59] discerned like that." I mean, I was
[43:01] having fear battles, having trouble
[43:03] sleeping, all these different things and
[43:05] Bible questions I had. And I said,
[43:08] "Simon, don't ever doubt your call to
[43:10] preach. God spoke through you tonight.
[43:12] I've never had a preacher tell me the
[43:14] secrets of my life like that."
[43:18] And what did I do? I fall down and say,
[43:19] "Thank you, Jesus. Jesus cares about me.
[43:22] He loves me. He loves you. Hallelujah.
[43:26] And they report God is in them truly.
[43:29] God is truly in that church. How is it
[43:32] then, brethren, when you come together,
[43:34] every one of you has a psalm, everyone
[43:36] hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a
[43:38] revelation, hath interpretation, that
[43:40] all things be done unto edifying.
[43:44] Okay. Now, again, like I said before,
[43:46] you know, u this church there was they
[43:49] were always having gifts, constantly
[43:51] having gifts. The other churches we
[43:52] don't really hear too much about gifts.
[43:54] One time I did that. I looked one time I
[43:56] looked up gifts in every other one of
[43:58] the books and it was very few instances.
[44:00] Think about that. They were holy
[44:01] ghostfilled church and Paul doesn't
[44:03] write anything about gifts.
[44:06] Well, because they they knew how to
[44:07] handle it. I'll say like this. They had
[44:08] the love of God.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; They had charity. Charity will take care
[44:13] of these things.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; As far as people misusing gifts, right?
[44:18] Charity will take care of that. Charity
[44:20] will make you use the gifts in the right
[44:22] way.
[44:24] Now imagine that. Imagine church.
[44:26] Imagine if we were at a service and you
[44:29] know Malachi told me he wanted to
[44:30] testify tonight. Sometimes I'll get
[44:31] testimonies from Zur. You know sometimes
[44:32] I get testimony from other people which
[44:34] I love. But imagine if if while I'm up
[44:38] here I said, "Okay, who has a
[44:39] testimony?" Every hand shot up.
[44:42] And pretty soon it's just like, "Oh,
[44:44] who's got a revelation? Oh yeah, I got
[44:46] one. Who's got a tongue?" Imagine that's
[44:49] what their church was like. It was like
[44:51] Malachi gave a testimony and then Zur
[44:53] and then Beatatric and then Lydia and
[44:55] then Rod and then all the little ones.
[44:56] Everybody just testified. And there's so
[44:59] many gifts operating which is wonderful.
[45:02] But Paul says we got to limit that. You
[45:05] have to limit that. You got to do it
[45:07] decently and in order.
[45:09] Praise God. Now we always do it in order
[45:11] here. I'm not I'm just saying let's try
[45:14] to think about what it would be like if
[45:16] we were a Corinthian church, but we're
[45:18] not a Corinthian church. I'll say like
[45:20] this. I believe we're a mature church.
[45:21] Now, do we have areas to grow?
[45:23] Absolutely.
[45:24] But we don't do these things, right? We
[45:27] we don't say everybody speak in tongues.
[45:28] Even if you don't have the gift, you
[45:30] you've never heard me say that. I'm
[45:32] never going to say that, right? You've
[45:35] been around me long enough, you know.
[45:39] So he says, "Let all things be done to
[45:42] build each other up." So you have to
[45:43] make sure when you like Malachi telling
[45:45] testimony, that builds us up, doesn't
[45:46] it?
[45:48] &gt;&gt; So you have to make sure when you
[45:49] testify or whether you had a song
[45:51] special or uh you got a doctrine you
[45:55] want to share with me. Like sometimes
[45:56] brother Chris will tell me doctrinal
[45:57] questions, you know. Uh you want to make
[46:00] sure that's going to it's going to build
[46:02] people up, right?
[46:05] So we want to be mindful of that.
[46:07] edifying, making them stronger, promote
[46:10] their spiritual growth.
[46:12] Now, if any man speak in an unknown
[46:14] tongue, let it be by two or at the most
[46:16] three. Now, look at it. Look at church.
[46:18] It goes from everybody's got one. Paul
[46:19] says just two or three.
[46:23] Everybody in the church got one. Just
[46:25] two or three. Well, how do we know then?
[46:29] Well, you got to have a Holy Ghost
[46:31] filled pastor, right? You got to have
[46:33] some people that have the uncction of
[46:34] the Holy Spirit. Or maybe it's first
[46:37] come, first serve. I'm just saying the
[46:39] the pastor has control over the the
[46:41] course of the service.
[46:43] But imagine going from everybody's got
[46:45] one after the pastor's done. Who wants
[46:48] to testify? Oh, I'll testify. Who's who
[46:50] who's got a dream? I had a dream. Who
[46:53] got a revelation of the word? I had a
[46:54] revelation. Uh, we'll take three. Take
[46:58] three. Now, I've been at services. Who's
[47:00] ever been in a service before where it's
[47:02] a special service and you have so many
[47:04] people want to sing song specials? You
[47:06] got to limit it down.
[47:08] Maybe be a church members. I've been to
[47:10] numerous meetings, they got five or six
[47:12] people want to sing song specials. Well,
[47:13] how do you know? You just go to the Holy
[47:15] Spirit, right? Or ones that I've been
[47:18] to, they'll say, "Well, you're a
[47:20] visitor. We don't get to hear you sing.
[47:21] So, we're going to let you sing. You
[47:23] home church people, you got to wait.
[47:25] We're going to put you off till later."
[47:27] But you want to make sure you're led of
[47:29] the Holy Spirit.
[47:31] I mean, that that's a kind thing to do.
[47:32] who will let the visitors sing, but are
[47:34] you led of the Holy Spirit? You just
[47:36] want to make sure. And maybe God's
[47:37] leading you that way. I'm not I'm not
[47:38] trying to be critical. I'm not trying to
[47:39] say they're wrong.
[47:43] Um, and that by course and let one
[47:46] interpret. Okay. Now, I told this story
[47:48] before. Maybe it's been years since I
[47:50] told it. When I was uh 16, I got
[47:53] baptized in Father and Holy Ghost
[47:56] because I didn't know better. And I just
[47:57] I wanted to serve God. I had a I had a
[47:59] good heart at that time. God was really
[48:02] good to me. Um, and I was back. I just
[48:05] kind of gave in because the the the the
[48:08] youth the youth pastor was kind of after
[48:10] me a little bit. I just kind of wanted
[48:12] to get her off my shoulder. But I I I I
[48:15] respected God because he healed my mom
[48:16] of cancer. But it wasn't long after that
[48:18] as soon and church. I told you the
[48:19] story. As soon as I got in the car, like
[48:21] when I got baptized, I was thankful. As
[48:23] soon as I got in the car, we turned on
[48:24] rock and roll and I backslid right
[48:26] there. Right there. I remember. I
[48:28] remember that moment. We sat down. and
[48:30] my brothers turn it on and I was in the
[48:31] front seat and I remember that moment. I
[48:33] was like, "Oh, I'm back in it. I'm back
[48:34] into the rock and roll." But in that
[48:37] moment, I was thankful to God. I wanted
[48:39] to serve God. Well, fast forward, I
[48:40] forget how many months or years. I'm in
[48:42] a service and the pastor is preaching to
[48:44] me and I I should have I should have
[48:45] told his parent or his children this
[48:47] when I saw the children a couple weeks
[48:48] ago at the funeral. I was in that
[48:51] service. I remember I was distinctly on
[48:52] that that right side and the the uh
[48:56] there came a tongue and interpretation
[48:58] calling sinners up. a tongue
[48:59] interpretation, calling sinners up. And
[49:01] I sat there and I had my head down. I
[49:02] said, "God, if you send seven of these,
[49:04] I'll go up to the altar,
[49:07] church." Seven came and then like eight
[49:09] or nine or 10 came. And I sat there with
[49:12] a hard heart. I said, "I'm too ashamed
[49:14] to do it." Now, now I feel like crying
[49:15] because I wish I would have gone up. It
[49:17] would have saved a lot of pain in my
[49:18] life.
[49:20] But look, I didn't know better. And I
[49:21] said, "God, give me seven." And God gave
[49:24] me more than seven. That shows me how
[49:26] much God was trying to save my soul.
[49:29] Now, our church didn't understand it.
[49:31] I'm sorry. Our our church didn't didn't
[49:32] have the these Bible beliefs. So, what
[49:35] was it? Our Assembly of God Church was a
[49:36] Corinthian church in one way, right? In
[49:38] one way. But tell you what, they're
[49:40] sweet people. And I told him that, too.
[49:44] And I thank God for that Assembly of God
[49:46] church. We had a good good church, but
[49:47] probably like the ones you've been in,
[49:49] brother. Sweet people. But I just want
[49:52] you to see like Paul limits three, but
[49:55] beforehand, everybody had one.
[49:59] before he said three, everybody had a
[50:01] tongue or interpretation or something.
[50:04] So, I just want you to know, church, and
[50:06] I want you young people to know, too. If
[50:08] you make a deal with God, keep your side
[50:10] of the bargain. I regret deeply I didn't
[50:14] keep my side. I gotten a lot of things I
[50:17] wish I would not have got into. And it
[50:19] breaks my heart now to have to say that,
[50:21] but I'm going to tell it like it is. I'm
[50:22] going tell it straight by God's grace.
[50:23] I'm going be honest.
[50:26] I'm trying to bring this down. We're
[50:27] almost here at the end of the chapter.
[50:28] But if there be no interpreter, let him
[50:30] keep silent in the church of God and let
[50:32] him speak to himself and to God. Of
[50:34] course, that means at home, right? In
[50:36] your prayer time, your prayer closet.
[50:40] Now, Brother Ram says, "If you have an
[50:42] unknown tongue and and there's no
[50:44] interpreter," he said, "Let it go a
[50:46] couple times, a couple services, and see
[50:48] if God will raise up an interpreter."
[50:50] So, that's been always that's always my
[50:52] policy, too. If somebody speaks in
[50:54] tongues, we pray, we don't get the
[50:56] interpretation. I'm not going to say
[50:57] stop it. I'm gonna say keep doing it.
[50:59] Maybe we'll keep praying. And I've said
[51:01] that three or four times, three times
[51:03] now because I wasn't there the first
[51:04] time. I've said that every time. You
[51:07] know, just keep doing it. Just speak in
[51:10] tongues. Let it go. And let's pray for
[51:12] an interpretation by the grace of God.
[51:16] And if not, church, if not mature
[51:17] enough, I'll be happy that you're
[51:19] edified because I get edified by the
[51:22] word. I get edified by singing. I'm
[51:24] happy you're edified. Hallelujah. Good
[51:26] for you. I don't I don't want to get
[51:27] jealous of the body. I want to be
[51:29] thankful for the body. You understand?
[51:32] But if somebody now, if somebody's doing
[51:33] it with a wrong spirit, I believe God
[51:34] would show us that if they're just
[51:36] pretending. I believe God would show us
[51:37] that by their character, you know, by
[51:39] the discernment of the Holy Spirit. But
[51:41] if they're if they're genuine person
[51:44] just learning about tongues, learning
[51:45] about their gift, then let's give them a
[51:47] chance. Brother says like a child who's
[51:49] learning how to talk. If he's saying da
[51:51] da da da da, you don't say be quiet till
[51:53] you can say daddy the right way. No,
[51:55] brother said, look, he's got a gift to
[51:57] talk. He's just got to exercise it.
[52:00] Right. Like Tulsi's now learned how to
[52:02] talk. Dad,
[52:05] well, she's got a gift to talk. She's
[52:07] got to learn how to do it. So, we give
[52:08] her chances to do it. And that's how we
[52:11] that's how we we approach unknown
[52:12] tongues. Like, you got to learn how to
[52:15] use it, but we also got to have an
[52:17] interpreter. So, we just give a little
[52:18] time. If that should ever happen by
[52:20] God's grace,
[52:22] let the prophets speak two or three and
[52:24] let the other judge. In other words, in
[52:26] this church, everybody knew who the
[52:27] prophets were. Right? Everybody knows
[52:30] who said, "Thus sayith the Lord, and it
[52:32] came to pass, right?"
[52:35] And that's what we want to recognize,
[52:37] too. You know, we we want to recognize
[52:38] if someone's got a gift of prophecy or
[52:41] faith or tongues or we want to recognize
[52:43] that gift and we want to honor that
[52:45] gift, right? But we want to we want to
[52:47] have love first and then covet. God use
[52:50] brother so and so. God use sister so-
[52:52] and so in the gift today.
[52:57] And so if you ever if we ever had a
[52:59] prophet of course or we ever will go to
[53:01] meetings where there's a prophet
[53:03] whenever they speak two or three got to
[53:05] judge it to know that it's from God or
[53:07] not.
[53:11] And that's why church when we had that
[53:12] tongue in 2010 interpretation that's why
[53:14] I went to the people because we were
[53:16] young that time nobody judged that gift
[53:18] right in that 2010 service I wasn't
[53:21] there my family wasn't there nobody said
[53:23] well let's judge this from the preacher
[53:24] nobody did that right so I what I have
[53:26] to do I have to go follow up the next
[53:28] week and see was that from God right but
[53:32] in the perfect sense you'd have a tongue
[53:33] interpretation and then you'd have
[53:34] judges we let's say Malachi was a judge
[53:38] thus say the Lord
[53:39] Mali, is that right? Was that the spirit
[53:41] of the Lord? Uh, Rod, was that right?
[53:44] Was that the spirit of the Lord or not?
[53:45] Okay, we got two witnesses. All right,
[53:47] we accept it. Praise God. Brother Ram
[53:49] said, "Then if it fails," he said, "You
[53:50] got to go to the judges and the person
[53:52] and repent and say, "We got an evil
[53:54] spirit." Now, that's serious right
[53:56] there. Got a lying spirit in there. All
[54:00] right. That's how it should operate.
[54:02] Now, church, do I believe this will
[54:04] happen before the rapture? I don't know,
[54:05] but I hope so by God's grace. Brother
[54:07] Abraham said, "Thus say the Lord, the
[54:08] fullness of Pentecost will be in the
[54:11] bride at the end time."
[54:13] So whatever we see in the book of Acts,
[54:15] the fullness of this, and it's based
[54:17] upon Joel chapter 2 and 23- 26,
[54:21] right? I'll restore all the years that
[54:24] the Palmer worm, the cankeror, the
[54:25] caterpillar, and I always forget the
[54:26] fourth one. Uh what was it? Palmerworm,
[54:30] caterpillar, was cankerworm. Is that the
[54:33] one I forgot? Locust. There it is.
[54:35] Locust. That's what I forgot. Locus.
[54:37] Thank you. In other words, all these
[54:40] years that the denomination or the evil
[54:41] antichrist spirit has eaten away the
[54:42] Holy Ghost. God's going to pour it back.
[54:44] Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:48] Church, as I told you, I've had revival,
[54:50] years of revival in my life where I felt
[54:52] like it was the book of Acts.
[54:55] But then we go through ups and downs. We
[54:56] all all got to go through seasons. 2010
[54:59] to 2013 was one of those moments. I felt
[55:02] like the book of Acts, the rapture was
[55:05] on. And then we had a good uh set of
[55:08] healings there right there around 2020.
[55:09] Remember, we had numerous testimonies. I
[55:11] felt like that again. But then we got to
[55:12] go through times hard times again to be
[55:14] tested. So just keep serving God. I'll
[55:17] restore, sayeth the Lord.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, when I come in the
[55:21] message in 2004 or 2001, I felt like
[55:23] that too. I felt like the book of Acts.
[55:27] Now, let me finish up here. If anything
[55:29] be revealed to another that siteth by,
[55:31] let the first hold his peace. In other
[55:32] words, the believer with the revelation
[55:34] must remain silent until the prophet is
[55:36] done speaking, there can't be any
[55:38] confusion. There can't be any
[55:39] interruptions.
[55:41] Okay? So that's what that's saying. Let
[55:43] the person let the person hold their
[55:45] peace until the speaker is done and then
[55:48] you go on. So you give the prophecy or
[55:50] the unknown tongue, give the
[55:51] interpretation and then if there's a
[55:53] revelation, just let that person finish
[55:55] and go on to the next one.
[55:58] For ye may all prophesy one by one that
[56:01] all may learn. Now remember in the in
[56:03] the book of Acts they learn that a
[56:04] famine was coming. Now wouldn't it be
[56:07] nice to know that inflation's coming in
[56:08] our day?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that have been nice to know
[56:11] that was coming? Now we probably could
[56:12] have known if we well we would have
[56:14] known if the Holy Ghost would have told
[56:15] us but but that's the same type of
[56:17] thing. Prophecy will help us learn
[56:20] something that will help us in our life.
[56:22] Right? That's where prophecy can be
[56:24] helpful. I mean, even with that 2013
[56:27] with the death of the uh pastors, well,
[56:29] that's good to know, too, because that
[56:31] lets you know God knows when it's your
[56:33] time to go. It makes you humble, right?
[56:36] Well, my goodness, God knows the years.
[56:38] God knows everything. He the very hairs
[56:40] of your head are numbered, right? Any
[56:43] sparrow, any any any bird that dies, God
[56:45] sees it fall and die. God knows all
[56:48] about it.
[56:51] So, he foretold the famine, right? and
[56:53] all may be comforted.
[56:56] Hallelujah.
[56:58] And the spirits of the prophets or
[56:59] subjects of the prophets, brother Ram
[57:01] said, the person who speaks in tonesues
[57:03] or interpretation, they have control
[57:04] over it. Now, brother Rod, have you ever
[57:06] spoken in tongues? Okay.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That's right, brother.
[57:11] Now, this is what brother Ram said, and
[57:13] it's okay maybe if you got a different
[57:15] experience, but he said, Brother Ram
[57:17] said he knew when he was going to speak
[57:19] in tongues, but he had to wait till the
[57:21] right time to let it come out. Do you
[57:22] have that same experience?
[57:27] Okay.
[57:30] Okay.
[57:32] Amen.
[57:36] Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That could
[57:38] be your experience.
[57:41] Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. Amen.
[57:46] Yeah.
[57:47] Yes, sir.
[57:53] No, that's good. I asked you.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, brother. Amen to
[58:02] that. Hallelujah. So, in the context
[58:05] where when brother Ram said this, he had
[58:07] this trouble at certain times of his
[58:09] ministry. He tried to preach and people
[58:10] would raise up to speak in tongues and
[58:12] prophesy and he and he and he had he you
[58:15] talk to him after servants say you know
[58:16] that wasn't the right time because the
[58:18] word of God is coming now this is the
[58:20] time to preach the word pull sinners up
[58:23] from the pulpit right pull them up out
[58:25] of sin and we didn't want an
[58:27] interruption of tongue interpretation
[58:30] and so brother Brandham taught them and
[58:31] all these preachers agree with brother
[58:33] Brandham in the questions answer 61 if
[58:34] you want to listen to it and they say oh
[58:36] yeah brother Brandham we have we have
[58:38] control over it the spirit of the
[58:39] prophets are subject to the prophets
[58:42] pardon me and they were able to hold it
[58:45] in until the right time and then brother
[58:48] Ram just gives a simple illustration
[58:51] he says how many you ever shouted in the
[58:52] spirit and he said he said look at the
[58:55] hands he said don't you have control
[58:56] when you shout yeah right you have
[58:59] control you know in other words you feel
[59:01] brother says you feel something coming
[59:03] up right I've felt that many times
[59:06] and then uh but you got to say it the
[59:09] right time, right? You don't want to say
[59:11] at the wrong time. You want to say at
[59:12] the right time. All right? So, that's
[59:15] that's that's just the summary, just a
[59:17] very simple summary of what brother
[59:19] Random would talk about that verse.
[59:21] Uh they they they can open their mouth
[59:24] or they can the Bible say you can quench
[59:26] the Holy Spirit, right? So, some people
[59:28] could quench the Holy Spirit, right? And
[59:31] that would be sin. But you also need to
[59:34] wait till the right time like brother
[59:35] talked about. Brother said after the
[59:37] preaching that's the time for the gifts
[59:39] to operate.
[59:42] Verse 33. For God is not the author of
[59:44] confusion but of peace as in all
[59:47] churches of the saints. So I love this.
[59:49] God ordained taking turns, right? Your
[59:52] whole life you got to learn take turns.
[59:54] Oh, it's turn. No, it's Malachi's turn.
[59:56] No, now it's Lydia's turn. Right.
[59:58] Everybody's got to take turns. When do I
[59:59] get my turn? Right, children? When do I
[1:00:01] get my turn? God started this, right?
[1:00:04] God authors this. We need to take turns
[1:00:07] with gifts,
[1:00:09] right? Two or He says two or three. Two
[1:00:12] at the most three.
[1:00:14] So that and that's that's how you can
[1:00:16] that's how you can take turns is because
[1:00:18] he God gives you control over that. Like
[1:00:21] you can either quench it or you can hold
[1:00:23] on to it at the right time and let it go
[1:00:24] and let the words be said at the right
[1:00:26] time. All right. Even Yeah. Sure,
[1:00:30] brother.
[1:00:36] Yes, sir.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; For sure.
[1:01:00] Sure.
[1:01:02] Oh yeah.
[1:01:06] Yeah.
[1:01:08] Yeah.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; For sure. Amen, brother. Yeah. He told
[1:01:13] the story one time uh he was in meetings
[1:01:16] and it was like numerous meetings like
[1:01:19] in a row, like five in a row. And he
[1:01:21] said uh he said one he's preaching,
[1:01:24] brother M's trying to give his altar
[1:01:25] call and a woman raises up and distracts
[1:01:27] from the altar call with a tongue
[1:01:29] interpretation. He said it happened
[1:01:32] again. He said the third night um third
[1:01:34] night he was walking the meeting and
[1:01:35] there was that woman. He he said she was
[1:01:37] fixing her hair saying I've got another
[1:01:38] message from the Lord tonight.
[1:01:41] And so brother said as soon as she stood
[1:01:42] up he she he said sit down
[1:01:45] because she's she's getting herself to
[1:01:47] look good to stand up and prophesy.
[1:01:50] Brother said, "Sit down. That's not the
[1:01:52] Holy Spirit." Now, Brother Rod, I want
[1:01:54] to say this on every tape. I've never
[1:01:57] heard Brother Bam rebuke anybody
[1:01:58] speaking in tongues and actually
[1:02:00] interrupting his preaching. So, that
[1:02:02] shows what a gentleman he was. And also,
[1:02:04] it must have been led of the Lord. And
[1:02:06] what that meant, brother Bam says, those
[1:02:08] people just weren't trained to wait to
[1:02:10] give the prophecy and interpretation at
[1:02:12] the right time.
[1:02:15] And then another on top of that, it
[1:02:17] could be that would signal if it was
[1:02:19] like an altar call, that would signal
[1:02:21] the altar call to start. Like if it's a
[1:02:22] prophecy calling for repentance or even
[1:02:25] healing.
[1:02:27] So I just want to let you know that
[1:02:28] brother told that story, but I've never
[1:02:30] heard it on tape other than him telling
[1:02:31] the story. I've never heard him live in
[1:02:34] live right there rebuking somebody and
[1:02:36] say, "Sit down and you're out of order."
[1:02:38] But he told the story about it. Okay,
[1:02:41] that's great. Great great story,
[1:02:42] brother.
[1:02:44] Now, here's where it is. That's called a
[1:02:46] pillcrow. Isn't that a weird word for
[1:02:47] that? That's called a pillcrow. That
[1:02:49] little paragraph sign there. The
[1:02:52] pillcrow makes the beginning of a new
[1:02:54] paragraph or a topic shift. So, it's not
[1:02:57] in every King James Bible, but I like
[1:02:58] them in my Bible. I I like to know when
[1:03:01] did the prophet change thoughts? Isn't
[1:03:03] it helpful to know? So, you know, he's
[1:03:06] he's switching now. So, now now you know
[1:03:07] the verses, but these verses are going
[1:03:09] to be little different thought than the
[1:03:11] previous verses.
[1:03:13] I remember they added the numbers in
[1:03:15] like a couple hundred years ago. I mean
[1:03:17] those numbers like 1 Corinthians 13:10
[1:03:19] that was the verse 10 and chapter 13
[1:03:21] wasn't in the original manuscript. It
[1:03:24] was just added for help, right? For
[1:03:26] benefit that we could find things. So
[1:03:29] now he switches gears. He says, "Let
[1:03:31] your women keep silent the churches." So
[1:03:32] it seems like Corinthians let the women
[1:03:34] preach, but Paul says, "Keep them silent
[1:03:37] in the churches, for it's not permitted
[1:03:39] unto them to speak, but they are
[1:03:42] commanded to be under obedience as also
[1:03:45] saith the law.
[1:03:47] And if they will learn anything, let
[1:03:49] them ask their husbands at home." So the
[1:03:51] first person the w the married woman is
[1:03:54] supposed to ask a question is her
[1:03:55] husband. Okay? For it's a shame for a
[1:03:59] woman to speak in the church or preach
[1:04:00] in the church. It's not a shame for a
[1:04:03] woman to say amen. It's not a shame for
[1:04:05] a woman to say hallelujah. I like that
[1:04:07] when you sisters say that. Uh amen. I
[1:04:11] just say that. Um
[1:04:14] now every commentator I read which was
[1:04:16] uh JFB uh Barnes Henry
[1:04:21] uh I forget the other ones they all said
[1:04:23] as also say the law law refers to
[1:04:26] Genesis 3:16 where Eve is made uh to be
[1:04:30] under Adam's rule uh thy husband shall
[1:04:34] rule over thee. So all the commentators
[1:04:36] seem to agree on that and that is also
[1:04:38] agreed by Paul in second Timothy chapter
[1:04:41] 2 because Paul says don't let the women
[1:04:44] preach and teach right don't let her
[1:04:45] assert authority over men he says why
[1:04:48] because Adam was formed first then Eve
[1:04:51] and then Eve was deceived in the
[1:04:52] transgression Adam was not
[1:04:55] okay and and additionally on top of all
[1:04:58] that the law never permits a woman to be
[1:05:01] a priestess women were never allowed
[1:05:03] into the priesthood Right? They couldn't
[1:05:06] minister before God. They couldn't
[1:05:08] teach. The priest, the priest was the
[1:05:10] teacher as well. The Bible says that as
[1:05:11] well.
[1:05:13] Okay.
[1:05:15] And then I like this. Then he changes
[1:05:16] thought again. What? Now he's finishing
[1:05:18] up this chapter. He says, "Came the word
[1:05:20] of God out from you or came unto you
[1:05:22] only? You've allowed women preachers.
[1:05:24] You've allowed all these tongues to go
[1:05:25] forth. Did the word of God come out of
[1:05:27] you?" It's got quite a good rebuke,
[1:05:30] isn't it?
[1:05:32] Paul's saying, "I got the word of the
[1:05:34] Lord." No doubt they knew. Jesus Christ
[1:05:36] met Paul in Arabia and taught him the
[1:05:38] gospel. No doubt they knew. And he's
[1:05:41] saying, "What? Didn't the word of God
[1:05:43] come out of me? It didn't It didn't go
[1:05:46] to you. It came to me." Right? If any
[1:05:49] man think himself to be a prophet or
[1:05:51] even spiritual, let it acknowledge the
[1:05:53] things that I write unto you are the
[1:05:56] commandments of the Lord. So these are
[1:05:59] commandments of the Lord, church. Ain't
[1:06:02] that beautiful? Hallelujah.
[1:06:05] But then church, now remember this.
[1:06:06] Brother Ram was very gracious to women
[1:06:08] preachers. Brother Ram was very gracious
[1:06:10] to people that spoke in tongues and
[1:06:12] interrupted his preaching,
[1:06:14] right? Because why? Because these are
[1:06:15] minors, right? It's a minor. The major
[1:06:18] is salvation by the blood of Jesus
[1:06:20] Christ, not by works, lest any man
[1:06:22] should boast. Don't trust in your creed
[1:06:24] for salvation. Trust in the blood of
[1:06:26] Jesus Christ for salvation.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; That's a major brother. Remember we did
[1:06:29] that Bible study children a couple weeks
[1:06:31] ago, three weeks ago.
[1:06:33] Never major on a minor, right? Major on
[1:06:36] a major.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "If any man's ignorant of
[1:06:41] this, let him be ignorant." In other
[1:06:42] words, let the blind lead the blind.
[1:06:44] Right?
[1:06:46] Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy
[1:06:48] and forbid not to speak with tongues.
[1:06:50] That's why I said, if someone speaks in
[1:06:51] tones, speak in tonesues. We'll pray for
[1:06:53] the interpretation.
[1:06:55] But we should desire prophecies. In
[1:06:57] other words, God give us dreams or God
[1:06:59] give us visions. Oh, yeah, that's right.
[1:07:01] Yeah, that brother I told you about with
[1:07:02] interracial marriage. He's had visions
[1:07:04] that God told him something like, "Why
[1:07:06] would you call this wrong when my word
[1:07:08] calls it right?"
[1:07:10] A vision. He was wide awake and he saw a
[1:07:12] vision of God saying, "This is right in
[1:07:14] the Bible." There's nothing wrong with
[1:07:16] interracial marriage according to the
[1:07:18] Bible.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; You just got to be church. You just want
[1:07:21] to be led of the Lord whoever you marry.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's not like, "Well, I'm a white man.
[1:07:25] I'm going to go chase a black woman."
[1:07:26] Or, "I'm a black man. I'm going to go
[1:07:29] chase a white woman." That's not the
[1:07:30] right attitude. It's God, who do you
[1:07:31] want me to marry?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Because I believe the word of God. And I
[1:07:36] want to be yolked to the person God
[1:07:37] wants me to be yolked to.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Young people, I'm already yolked. You,
[1:07:43] if you're not yolked, you better pray.
[1:07:44] Hallelujah. Pray.
[1:07:46] Verse 40. Let all things be done
[1:07:48] decently. That means honestly and in
[1:07:51] order. So God's a God of order. God's a
[1:07:53] God of taking turns. So the second time
[1:07:56] he says covet those best gifts expressed
[1:07:59] by the apostle. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:08:01] Uh musicians can come.
[1:08:05] So tonight church let's pray for uh
[1:08:08] gifts to operate of course with the love
[1:08:09] of God. Let's also pray for uh prophecy.
[1:08:14] Let's let's see if God will speak to us
[1:08:16] somehow in a dream or something along
[1:08:17] those lines. You know u
[1:08:21] you remember that nice little testimony
[1:08:23] I told you or maybe sister Yeah.
[1:08:24] Remember, sister Naomi told her
[1:08:26] testimony. Remember in 2017 in the other
[1:08:29] uh room over there, I preach on
[1:08:31] spiritual gifts. And then remember
[1:08:33] sister Naomi spoke in tongues right at
[1:08:34] the end of the service. Remember that.
[1:08:38] And that was part of her testimony
[1:08:39] because she had told her dad before. She
[1:08:41] said, uh, "Brother William, I'm I'm
[1:08:44] speaking for her behalf, so if I mess up
[1:08:46] the story, please correct me." Uh, but I
[1:08:49] think she told her dad, "Lord, will you
[1:08:51] let me speak in tongues so I know I've
[1:08:53] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost." And
[1:08:55] then she forgot about it. All these
[1:08:57] years later, she flies across the ocean
[1:09:00] and a little known nobody preacher
[1:09:02] preaches on gifts and then she speaks in
[1:09:04] tonesues as a and then she remembered,
[1:09:07] "That's right. I did pray to speak in
[1:09:08] tonesues as a a proof that I'm born
[1:09:12] again."
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; And that was her request. So, we thank
[1:09:15] the Lord for God's grace. Hallelujah.
[1:09:17] Thank God for amazing grace. How many
[1:09:19] thankful this Thanksgiving? Praise God.
[1:09:21] So, let's have a word of prayer, church.
[1:09:22] If anyone needs prayer, you're more than
[1:09:23] welcome to come. But I imagine if
[1:09:25] there's not, then um let's pray for
[1:09:27] prophecy, right? Let's pray that our
[1:09:29] church could be edified.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Remember, God has foretold us a few
[1:09:33] things in the last year, right?
[1:09:35] Especially regarding with people in the
[1:09:36] church and what was going to happen. God
[1:09:38] told us that prophetically, right? We
[1:09:41] knew beforehand. Uh didn't quite
[1:09:44] understand it, but God told us
[1:09:45] beforehand. So, we know we're in the
[1:09:47] plan of God. We're know we're know we're
[1:09:49] in the hand of God by living in love.
[1:09:53] We're loving, right? We're supposed to
[1:09:54] be loving, following the word of God.
[1:09:58] But we'll also pray that God will speak
[1:09:59] in some dream vision.
[1:10:02] And remember, we're just visited Sunday
[1:10:04] night with a man who saw a vision, a man
[1:10:06] who dreamed dreams about the word of
[1:10:08] God. And God showed him the truth of the
[1:10:11] Bible. Praise God. Let's bow our heads.
[1:10:15] Dear God, we're thankful for tonight.
[1:10:17] Bless this audience. They've been very
[1:10:18] patient. I preached extra long here
[1:10:20] tonight. Uh because we don't have work
[1:10:21] tomorrow. So God, we're thankful, Lord,
[1:10:23] for a day where we don't have to work
[1:10:25] tomorrow. Thank you, Jesus, for the time
[1:10:28] off. Thank you for the family time.
[1:10:30] Thank you for the fellowship, Lord,
[1:10:32] we'll have. We also want to reflect on
[1:10:35] this year. Thank you for another
[1:10:36] wonderful year, Lord. 2025 has been a
[1:10:38] great year of your mercy, your
[1:10:40] provision, Lord God.
[1:10:43] Hallelujah.
[1:10:46] Lord, we have one more reason to count
[1:10:47] our blessings. You protected Malachi
[1:10:49] there on the road. Lord God, another
[1:10:51] reason to say thank you, God. Thank you
[1:10:53] for your blessings, God. Those visitors
[1:10:56] on Sunday night. Thank you, God,
[1:10:59] for people that will pray and fast for
[1:11:01] revelation on the word of God.
[1:11:04] And just use my life in a real small way
[1:11:07] to be encouragement to them. Thank you,
[1:11:10] Lord God.
[1:11:13] Lord, we realize we're right in your
[1:11:15] hand, Lord God. Sometimes it might not
[1:11:17] seem like that having such a small
[1:11:19] church. I know I battle that. Enemy
[1:11:21] fights us with different things. Yet,
[1:11:23] Lord, we know if we're obedient, if we
[1:11:26] pray, if we fast, if we wait on you, if
[1:11:28] we stay under the inspiration of the
[1:11:30] Holy Spirit,
[1:11:32] that God, you'll give us these
[1:11:34] revelations.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah. these doctrines, these
[1:11:38] psalms,
[1:11:41] these prophecies, Lord God.
[1:11:45] So we thank you tonight, Lord, for all
[1:11:47] these things you've done. Father, we
[1:11:49] want to pray for prophecy, Lord God. It
[1:11:50] would edify everyone, Lord, to hear you,
[1:11:53] Lord God. Foretell something and then it
[1:11:56] come to pass.
[1:11:59] Lord, we never want to impersonate
[1:12:00] anything. We never want to try to
[1:12:02] pretend to be spiritual.
[1:12:05] We just want your Holy Spirit to flow
[1:12:07] through us, Lord God.
[1:12:09] Lord, we want our church to be edified,
[1:12:11] God. Lord, I want to see it. I'm sure
[1:12:14] they want to see it. Me, we all want to
[1:12:16] see each other get stronger spiritually,
[1:12:19] mature spiritually, Lord God. Grow as a
[1:12:22] Christian. Hallelujah. Lord God,
[1:12:27] we all want to see everybody stimulated,
[1:12:32] comforted, calmed
[1:12:34] despite the trials of life. Lord God,
[1:12:40] so Lord Jesus, here we are, Lord God. We
[1:12:42] love you tonight. We're just going to
[1:12:43] worship, God. And I pray speak to us
[1:12:45] through dreams. Lord, I've had these two
[1:12:46] dreams about preachers.
[1:12:49] I didn't see much significance in them,
[1:12:51] but if I miss something, God, just show
[1:12:53] it to me.
[1:12:59] I love you, Lord God. Just want to thank
[1:13:02] you for your word tonight. Again, thank
[1:13:04] you for all the saints that came out to
[1:13:05] the house of the Lord here tonight. God,
[1:13:07] speak to us.
[1:13:11] Edify your people, Lord God. Lord, I'll
[1:13:14] give you thanks. If someone, one person
[1:13:16] speaks in tongues, I'll give you thanks.
[1:13:17] I'll be happy.
[1:13:20] But Lord, I'm praying, God, that the
[1:13:21] whole church could be edified, Lord God.
[1:13:23] the whole church could receive something
[1:13:26] from you, Lord God.
[1:13:29] Thanks for showing us in these little
[1:13:30] ways. You're with us. You're protecting
[1:13:32] us. Hallelujah. You're providing for us.
[1:13:36] We just want to walk in complete
[1:13:38] obedience to you, God, by your grace and
[1:13:40] mercy.
[1:13:41] Lord, we give you thanks. We ask all
[1:13:43] these blessings in Jesus.
