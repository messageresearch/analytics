========================================

three I believe if you haven't listened to it I really encourage you to listen to it it's a just a very special message it's a thorough teaching on God's grace and uh I just surely enjoyed it I trust you have as well and hope you enjoyed the review of zerubabel on Wednesday night was that a good review hopefully everybody enjoyed that one and um good message there by God's grace and remember we ended with 1 Timothy 1:14 and the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus so just a reminder that you know God gives us Grace and through that Grace he gives us also faith and he gives us love praise God so we're thankful for God's Amazing Grace uh it's God's gift that did it to us and he's giving us uh Grace just as we need it Hallelujah now brother R uh now working I'm I'm in paragraph 60 so I'm going through you know I'm going to try to go chronological through the sermon here um and we just ended with the part where brother brand was talking about um finishing up his uh his uh experience with the three rainbows and uh he he said those three rainbows represented the godhead the father son Holy Ghost Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new and he said the same God that gave him the message of the godhead is the same God that gave him the right balance on Grace Hallelujah and that's what this message is it's it's the message of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so if anyone has a true understanding of Grace that's a church it ought to be our church it ought to be churches that have heard the ministry of God's Prophet brother Brandon because we in other words we accept every Bible verse on Grace we don't take it too far like the Calvinists you know they believe you can uh they believe you don't have to do any absolutely anything to be saved and and what what they're saying is no works are there's no works right you can have no works and still be saved well uh that that's going too far that's going too far uh you have to do something you have to repent Hallelujah you have to repent and accept it there's always been one provided way Hallelujah God's provided way is repentance and accepting salvation the human has to do something to be saved God can't force somebody to be saved Hallelujah so God gives us uh something to do and it begins with submitting our will and so we're thankful that we have the right balance by the grace of God and I think you know as message Believers I think we have to be careful not to go on the side of armenis like I'm only saved if I'm doing good works all the time right we have we have to because we know so much about justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost talents gifts we know so much about that we hear so much of about it that the enemy will attack us and say well you haven't done enough this week you're probably not saved M right or you failed here how could you be saved you failed here how could you be justified how could you be Sanctified how could you be filled with the Holy Ghost see this say he's going to work on you either way that's why it's best just to praise God hallelujah like I was telling like when I preached on the the dancing you know you might as well dance you might as well praise God because Satan's going to attack you either way right that's why I told the Saints they enjoyed that thought out there in Kentucky either way you know either way he's going to bow to you the Bible said the the best part is when you do dance or when you do praise God or when you do worship uh the Bible said he inhabits that praise he in other words he's anointing you while you're doing that that's what I told one of those repentant Brothers I said I said when you do it you'll get the joy of the Lord back and then you'll be strong because the joy of the Lord is your strength amen so yes go ahead and praise God Amen recognize God's grace and enjoy that because and then you'll brother man said you'll live off that for a few days amen that's right he said he lived two weeks off of the future home imagine you wake up tomorrow oh future home and then imagine waking up Tuesday oh the future home you ever done that before that's quite a that's quite a thing you know you live off a revelation for a week or something that that's pretty awesome yeah I know I off that in appointing experience for at least a week I was like everyone wow thank you Lord amen God you're so close you're so wonderful amen you're so near to us hallelujah amen and so God uh you know God is encouraging us with Grace now um at this point in brother's sermon he's looking at himself a little more and comparing God's grace on his life because he's telling over this vision and he's seeing himself as a partial type of zerubabel zerubabel laid the foundation stone but then he was also going to lay The Headstone now brother random didn't lay the foundation stone Paul laid the foundation stone but brother randam did by God's grace he's laying this in other words he's pointing to the headstone The Headstone is Christ amen right and I'll say like this there's a couple of types there's two types for you the headstone is you getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's a headstone for you amen glory amen when there's a headstone we're all looking for that's the Rapture hallelujah amen see we could say brother laid The Headstone for the church other words he showed the church here's the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen right so and that that's one way brother Ram did Lay The Headstone but the other type is brother R's Ministry uh point us to Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is coming back just like John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the world or I'm sorry takes away the sin of the world brother Ram was saying Behold the Lamb of God he's coming back in the pre-tribulation Rapture hallelujah amen he was pointing to the headstone and I love it the shout was Grace Grace hallelujah amen amen amen when that squeeze begins coming on church we'll be shouting God grace thank we need God's grace amen we want to be ready by the grace of God see and if Grace caused the The Headstone to come there then Grace will cause this headstone to come as well amen it is God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah so brother is dealing with this you know he's starting now to get into some topics of Grace and just so you know here's brother ROM's here's the Bible characters brother random uses as I was studying yesterday I I found this this uh brother R basically went chronologically Through the Bible he started with Adam and Eve that's probably what we look at today then he went to Noah Abraham Israel as a nation Moses he spent the most time on David and if you haven't listened to the sermon and you like David you need to listen to the sermon because it's awesome about David he spends most of the time on David you know how could he do this with Bas Sheba yet God provided Grace it's it's beautiful and then he goes with a thief on the cross how he received Grace so if you want to see some beautiful uh preaching on Grace this is the sermon to listen to amen that's why we sing about it because it's a revelation from the Holy Ghost amen to God's prophet and God's Prophet gave it to us hallelujah he said just like I was given to God think about brother William just as he was given to godhead he was given this message of Grace amen and God Vindicated it with that vision of the three rainbows because what's a rainbow a covenant and what's a covenant it's a it's a promise of God's grace it's a promise I'm not going to leave you I'm not going to forsake you hallelujah amen I made a promise to you and I'm going to keep my promise hallelujah oh it's beautiful now brother R says this I'm going to start reading a few quotes and get down to some scriptures here by God's grace brother R said to think of him Jesus I was thinking of that Grace immediately after that Friday morning when he saw the three rainbows just at the break of day up there in the field where I sat on a log later and tears come down my eyes so here brother's crying after seeing the three rainbows and he says oh God Your Grace has stooped to save me why did you ever have such pity on a poor illiterate ratch like myself I like how brother was able to use some of these Bible words cuz Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am hallelujah amen and he was poor naturally now we if we're rich some of us most of us in America were raised Rich right as far as we have everything we need so we ought to be able to say Lord you had mercy on a literate how many can read brother man couldn't read very well he was illiterate so you you and I are like almost the opposite we're rich literate wretches might not it might not be easy for you accept that at first but that's the truth amen I don't care if you could read or what I don't care how smart you are if you're living in sin you are rich amen that's right and God's Amazing Grace came to you it came to me to save us miserable Rich literate wretches hallelujah amen hallelujah we're no better fact Bible said the Bible says Lea was an awful time Jesus didn't give Le DEA one compliment praise God and so you know we can't say we're better off or something like that yes there's more Revelation given this hour but you have also look at the other scriptures there's more deception this hour and we're we're just as prone to wonder as anybody else in any other Church age right we're prone to wonder right we love I love that song prone to wonder God I feel that prone to leave the God that I love I love God I love this message but I'm I'm prone to be distracted away from it so God take my heart and seal it for thy course above amen other words give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost and bring me back into Fellowship when I Stray hallelujah amen they wrote a song about that amen a song God uh seal me with thy in in thy courts above Lord help me to live in Heavenly places Hallelujah help me to set my affections on things above and not on this Earth Hall he said how did you ever come down to a humble little Tabernacle where peace people of low Walk of Life poor have nothing in this world most of us don't have much in this world think about that I'm 43 all I got in this world I'm still paying for 3/4 of an acre I don't have much acre in this world I don't even have an acre right and I'm still point I'm still paying for it praise God see we don't have we don't have much in this world but church if we say faithful to God we have much in heaven hallelujah amen much in the Millennium hallelujah amen I love our brother sisters we we're so humble we're so we're so wretched but yet your grace comes to us and you give us such exceeding precious promises amen think about that if we can just rule over sin now he'll make us rulers over cities in the Millennium praise God you can just rule over sin now mhm these great precious promises remember that's what James I'm going to read it James 2:5 if I'm not mistaken I know we're rich in comparison to almost all people around the world but most of the time we're reminded of our really we're poor in United States uh standards right but rich in the we're rich in the worldly standards the worldwide but most of us are pretty poor a lot of us maybe live paycheck to paycheck right we're not banking up and banking up all this savings and our savings just continually abound and abound and abound now if you are God's given to you for a purpose don't trust in uncertain riches oh yeah that's right I was out there in Kentucky and a brother come up and uh he was a multi-millionaire he said but he started straining from God he was in Insurance he's a multi-millionaire he started staying from God he backslid and he lost he said almost everything he said but God's grace brought me back amen and now he's like he had all this money he they could have all the guest preachers come in that's how they built that beautiful Church uh uh Caris where's Caris Caris Victoria that's how they built that big church they where's Victoria there's a couple there's not it's not it's not that big of a church I mean there's maybe 75 people but they had people that were millionaires in the church so they could build a really nice church but he said he has so much money they can invite the most popular preachers and you name you Nam the most popular preachers in the message they've had them there he said I've I've hunted he said I taught them to a turkey hunt he said taken them on trips and Havalina hunting all the he said but after I fell I realized in other words I realized my sin and I don't even desire to travel no more I just want to strengthen the local congregation that's right praise God see see that money you know it got him all these great experiences but he eventually fell away that's right that's right and there's nothing wrong with having money just don't let it take you away from God but most of us most of us in in in terms of American stands we're we're we're medium middle class or low class but thank God we got a class hallelujah thank God we're not dead thank God you know thank God we're not in not homeless Hallelujah at least we got a class Hallelujah Glory try not to scream too loud James 25 yes hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith see you might not be rich in money but you've got faith in God you have troubles where do you run to you don't run to the the alcohol H bottle you don't run to the fentol right you know you don't run to all these things you don't run to evil things you run to God because you got faith in God hallelujah you're rich in faith amen you might not be like it but if you're here today and you're trusting in God and you're trying to overcome all your trials and you're asking God to deliver you then you my friend are rich in faith hallelujah hallelujah the poor of this world I've worked for 20 years and I'm still trying to pay off 3/4 one acre now if I could have been selfish I I probably could have it paid off if I have to do all these maintenance and fixing up I probably could have paid it off but then our house probably would have burned out or something like that it was so old but you just we just want to be thankful yes right we just want to be thankful we want to be content I heard brother say yesterday he said you want to be content in the lot that God has given to you God's given you a lot God's giv you boundaries right and and we got to remember God's called me to this lot and I just want to I want to stay in God's lot amen I want to be thankful for God's lot hallelujah amen and getting back to that brother he said yeah he's just uh he come up and he handed I shouldn't say much I don't want to give people ideas online they're just trying to you know attack message Believers I don't give them too much ammunition uh he says we're poor he said how did you ever come down to a poor little humble Tabernacle here people of low Walk of Life poor have nothing in this world and still your grace is spread abroad in our hearts somebody got Grace in their heart today by the holy spirit that you heal our sicknesses amen you save our sins save us from our sins rather and make us your people and deal with us amen it's just God's grace that he deals with humble People Like Us amen humble not not rich in this world not great people this world but just humble people and church you've got thus sayth the word of God God chosen you Hallelujah because you have faith Hallelujah and you are Heirs of the Kingdom which he has promised to them that love him praise God I might not have much in this life but we'll have so much in the next life hallelujah amen amen remember remember that rich man in in Luke 16 it was that rich man Jesus said no Abraham said you have all that you fared so sup sumptuously during your lifetime and the the beggar had nothing during life he said but now you're tormented and now he's having Mercy he he's living in relief so see Church these little struggles we go with now it's good for us amen amen the trials we go through now it's God's grace to us amen amen it would be better to be a beggar and go to heaven than be a rich man and go to hell Hallelujah right it's God's grace that did that hallelujah it's God's grace you know and I don't know if this is true or not but brother R you know remember he he was looking at uh uh Oral Roberts future home remember that or Roberts was building a bigger home and and brother BR said you know all I got a little trailer if you haven't seen it it's just like a little trailer like like a construction trailer when you see you know a construction companies out there they got little where the office is that's what brother's office was and then there you know he sees Tommy Osborne and all Roberts they big it a future home of of or Robert's Ministries right and what was brother R's prayer brother R's prayer was well God maybe uh you you couldn't uh uh trust me with the finances right now no doubt God probably could have trusted him but he looked at at it as in other words my God's keeping me humble so I can do God's perfect will amen amen he said Tommy o I'm sorry or Roberts had to have like a 100 computers just to print out the papers to keep asking and begging people for money and brother said I'm glad I don't have to beg people for money that's right that's right hallelujah amen I'd rather be poor or small well he said with one little typewriter you see brother BR typing oh my you see in Visions he's got one typewriter of course he had Billy Paul and maybe a couple brother Argan Bri different ones you hear on tape that we secretaries but this is the humble Little Grace Ministry that God gave to his Prophet just visit visited last week uh I took Caris and Victoria down to brandom Tabernacle it's just a humble little church isn't that Brick Church Victoria just a small little Brick Church nothing really uh fantastic about it just a humble little place by God's grace I love it but that's the kind of church that God visits amen amen oh that's the kind of church that God dwells in Hallelujah these mega churches have you seen all these last few years all these mega church pastors are falling if the leaders got sinned then the Bible said that leav goes to all the church wow but if we got a holy life if I live a holy life if you live a holy life then we got the real unleavened bread of God here amen we can have the real Holy Spirit here with the real conviction of the holy spirit amen amen see they have a partial they got a partial hunger they got a partial uh anointing everything's partial partial but we can have the fullness in other words we can live in the fullness of God's grace for our lives amen amen oh we can come to the fullness of what God's called us to become Hallelujah brother man said you know he said then I thought of David how he took a notion to build the house of the Lord David said it's not right for me to live in the house of Cedar and the Ark of Covenant of my God under sheep skins and a tabernacle and God told the prophet go tell my servant David I took you from the Sheep coat from feeding them few sheep out there of your daddies and made you a great name like great men in the earth and so brother Ram always uses scripture use it in the seven seal use it different places in the seals he said this scripture always meant so much to him because God reminded David where he came from David wanted to do something great I want to build God a house and what' God say God said remember I took you from the Sheep coat right and they said then even told David you're a man of blood you're a man of war you're not going to build the house right but you're still a man after my own heart he reminds David you came from the Sheep Co feeding a few sheep and look where I brought you amen if we can be thankful Church where God brought us from this morning amen Where's God brought you from amen if you haven't listened to Austin's testimony lately you listen to God brought Austin from some sheep coat God brought me from the Sheep coat amen just a humble uh not for me a very sinful background very I've been telling Malachi some of my background this week you know we had more fellowship and we're going to have more Fellowship going to Iowa just telling in my background you know some of the more deeper things uh not the details of it but uh some of the more deeper sins that I was into and this this reminds me too it really encourages Me by God's grace that God can take a person whose mind is so degraded and God can wash it and many times I don't even think about those things because he's given me a new life and behold he that's in Christ is a brand new creature amen behold the old things have passed away All Things become new Hallelujah sometimes I'm surprised as I was talking to Mal like that's right I forgot I did that I forgot some of the depths I went to thank God Amen that he brought us out of the myy clay Hallelujah amen he put our feet on the Rock today hallelujah thank God he puts a song in our souls today amen song of Praise hallelujah praise God Amen you know he sees has this experience you know he's going to preach on Grace he sees himself you know as as a anti-type of zerubabel at the end of his ministry and then he says uh God reminded me that I in other words I'm not in control amen if God wants to take you somewhere if God wants to use you don't doubt God is going to use you praise God that's right amen if I just say if you're really born again how many be really born again if you're really born again then God is going to accomplish his perfect will in your life the only ones that don't is like Saul Saul is always that great example uh and and lot remember Saul he would have ruled all Israel forever if he just would have been faithful if he would have just put God's word first instead of pleasing the people people and what we've seen Church you know people that have come through our church remember I told you this one of the family told me they said we never actually put this church first we always put family first remember that we've had families coming and sometimes they wouldn't be here on a Sunday I'm like I wonder where they are and I text them I found out well they're spend their family visit so they don't come to church now that's the time you ought to come to church because we find out our family members that aren't in the message they're really they're led by evil spirits they're going to try to draw us away from the word yes church I know it it's I've seen it it's a reality they don't they're so deceived they don't even know what they're doing Hallelujah that's why church if you put God first you're on the right Road amen hallelujah you're on the right Road Hallelujah because God deserves to be first he deserves your your best Hallelujah he must be number one if you want to be a wise version by God's grace if you want to be a church after if you want to be a bride after the Heart of Jesus you got to put Jesus first amen hallelujah amen I'm learning lessons we're learning lessons that we always put God first and to keep sin as far away from you as you can sure remember your friends and family that aren't in the message Satan's trying to anoint them to bring you away from the truth so make your best friends message people amen and church don't complain I don't have any friends in the message you show yourself friendly you need a friend let's say hey let's go get some coffee now you know if you ask me to get coffee I'm going to go get coffee with you I might even pay for you no I will pay for you if you're a sister my wife can go with us of course something like that but you understand like if you want friends you got to show yourself friendly praise God you got to learn to reach out you got to you got to reach out out of your inhibitions out of your fears you got to and if someone doesn't accept it then maybe the next person will accept it right but the opposite is worse you don't want to let Satan keep you in this lonely state where you're lonely and defeated feel like you have no friends go out and make a friend amen I say if you can go make 10 if you can go make $1,000 a job surely you can go make a friend Hallelujah is that right church I don't know why I'm here that's not my notes amen glory but if anybody ought to be happy it ought to be us amen if anybody ought to have real friends it ought to be us hallelujah if you need a friend make a friend Hallelujah ask God for a friend hallelujah amen you don't have to be alone GL we got Jesus but we also got we also got God or Jesus in flesh and portions not the fonus portion you have a portion I have a I have a portion of Jesus in me Hallelujah you have a portion of Jesus in you amen I always like this how brother Brooks brother Brooks was always a good example he was always asking the brothers for Fellowship MH especially the new brothers he would always ask them he'd always invite them over or between Services he would try to take us out to eat he would always invite us you know he live right next to the church so all the brothers Simon Dave and Craig we' all myself we'd all go over there and fellowship you know and just have the guy time you know and so you got to you got to do that and even even as when brother BRS moved to Iowa uh Brother Rich remember his wife died uh and he was the one that was drinking all the diet coke he just he just turned 76 last week he sent me a picture with 1976 I'm sorry 1776 on it yeah the founding of our nation he's like I feel great at 76 I'm like Hallelujah you look great buddy but he's the one that drank too much coke he couldn't walk upstairs he stopped drinking Coke now he can walk up the stairs Hallelujah that's why I told those uh people at Kentucky I said every time I pass one those Dr Pepper signs I said I rebuke you Satan that's right I told him I said every time I pass that Taco Bell I said I'll rebuke you Taco Bell or Wendy's or whatever you saw those pictures in my feet I don't think leina seen them but maybe I'll show this afternoon you seen it it look like polka dots because of bad food but that's what we see church we see that we got to draw n to God I lost my train of thought that's why I'm saying I got to find my thought again I don't know what but having a friend you know whatever you have need of you pray to God and say God guide me to the right friends amen or to to the right job you I have a lot I was telling this to my wife I have a lot of financial testimonies but I've always worked two jobs I've always been a pastor yeah I've always worked two jobs right and then my wife has had to deal with the sacrifice of that right because I got to go study or I got to go do things for the church whatever more you know so we've sacrificed a lot and I was growing I was grew up poor you know I've tried to I've triy to donate a lot of the ties back to the church I still use some of course when I need it when I don't need it Glory God if I don't need to use that any God's really pouring out the finances am Hallelujah I've tried to give so much think about this all the times we've ever rent in churches it's because I gave the ties our offerings can never support this so I'm thankful for that I'm thankful that I I love to give it back but I thought you know this whole time you know I've had to invest in that if I've had to invest in that naturally God gives me natural blessings so whatever you have a need of invest in that Hallelujah and God will give you something praise God when it's his time and season how many believe that by God's grace am see so we're we're rich in Faith Church and we will be hirs we will inherit lands remember the Bible says We'll Inherit Vineyards that's right we'll build houses amen and if you have Offspring The Offspring will be right there with you praise God hallelujah I believe it it's a promise a millennial Promise by the grace of God Amen amen I didn't even know when I started preaching I imagine I started at uh let's see imagine I started at 10:30 now after the David comment brother Ram goes to this and he says I thought of the grace of God how that he could do that save to the uttermost how remember that from the book of Hebrews he can save to the uttermost how many people can you think of that my they're really deep in sin I don't know if God can save them but God can save them to the uttermost oh now I got a FR I'm going to share this testimony from Kentucky there was a 76 year old man who walked up to me now the whole time I'm preaching he's smiling at me I'm like this guy's pretty happy I he's really pulling on the word of God I love I like this guy he even stood up a couple times you know he's an old man white man he's got all the straight hair he comes it straight back he's he's looking around you know when they're when they're enjoying the word of God his name's Glenn but he come up after me he said after service he said I want to share my testimony on Saturday night's service oh yeah saving to the uttermost saving a wretch he said brother Jesse I want to tell you four years ago I was living in sin he said I've only been coming to this church for four years I'm like whoa you don't find that very much he only been saved for 4 years he's 76 that means he got saved at 72 in the message so friends don't give up on people and let me tell you this testimony he said at 20 20 years old whatever he was in the military he said that's when he left believing in God and he said for the next 50 some years think about this just say 52 from 20 to 52 he said I gave myself over to everything Satan offered so can you imagine porn you know I don't know I'm just the depths of sin now he was married the whole time but he said whatever Satan told me to do I did it I had no question now think about that for 52 years God had Grace and didn't let him die M he said but when he was 72 listen he said the devil was telling him go get that gun and kill yourself go get that gun and kill yourself and he had to fight it off and he said in that in those moments where the and he was on drugs and all kinds of things a 72- man all all these drugs he said something came back when he used to go to church as a Baptist something the Baptist preacher said 50 years ago said it reminded him of God's grace and then guess what one of those people from that the church in Kentucky he said basically dragged him to church and let me tell you this church if you let's be encouraged if we can do anything to get people to come to church let us do it outside of heard them let's not beat them up but in other words what I'm saying is don't take a no as an answer keep asking them to come to church amen hallelujah amen he said he said that he said that guy over there basically dragged me to church and then he said said that's when he repented he got re-baptized uh he said I got filled with the Holy Ghost he said now I've been in this message for 4 years I had no desire to serve God so see Church even at 72 God can say to the utmost Hallelujah everyone of us if we would have known him we would have written him off oh Impossible Too Far gone too many years outside of God too many years outside the message but our God is rich in Mercy he stay to the utmost I started crying I said brother I'm more blessed to be here than for you guys to have me here that's right and they poured out like I told you they poured out so many Financial blessings on me I'm like what what's going on here you guys have like an ATM that prints off money or something like that does money grow on trees in Kentucky I'm going start ready we might have to move down to Kentucky everybody I'll buy some acres and we'll all move down there cuz I think money grows on trees no it doesn't they work their tails off is what they do but see to save to the utmost so in other words let it be a fresh reminder don't ever give up on God because God can save to the uttermost that's what I was even tell my dad and different other ones I said God didn't even call Abraham till he was 755 he was an idol worshiper brother he you know brother man dramatized it like his dad showed him how to make idols and I dramatized it a few year maybe last year he would Bow Down think of Abraham for 75 years bowing down praying sacrificing to these wooden images and he's like I know these things don't talk I know they don't hear my but he had to do it because he had to follow his daddy and then one day the voice of the Lord said get thee up out of thy country get thee away from thy Kindred now he partially obeyed just like us amen that's a little better and he partially obeyed just like us yeah that's right brother and then and then he said Abraham par obeyed but then he did exactly what God told him not to do he took lot with him and look God's grace still ended to Abraham and church can extend to us cuz we're Abraham seed hallelujah amen All Nations will be blessed through Abraham if you have faith in Jesus Christ you're a child of Abraham I don't always obey perfectly but God will make sure I obey him amen that's what a faithful dad will do he'll make sure you obey the word of God Amen that's right amen is that right amen a faithful mother a faithful father they're going to make sure you obey the word of God as long as you're under my roof you're going to obey the word of God that's right Hallelujah don't ever give up on God God sure don't give up on you brother tells it later you know he tells it later in this sermon he said you know we try to be children of Faith he said he said we try to believe in Divine Healing and then uh the next day we get a tum tummy ache and he says we we lose all of our faith for Divine Healing he's talking about Abraham amen right we want to be children of Faith he said but we do things that we shouldn't do sometimes right but did God throw away Abraham no sir God finished the work that he had planned for Abraham God will finish the work he's planned for you and I amen it's impossible for God to fail whatever you were whatever you were in the mind of God how many know they in the mind of God before the foundation world as a real believer whatever you were in there God is going to bring it to pass because he's going to teach you to surrender Hallelujah he's going to drive you to do the right thing amen how many see that before God drives you away God will drive you to obey as well God will drive you he'll move you into difficult situations just to see what you're going to do yeah brother said it's the greatest thing that ever happened to you is the trial oh it's hard to say Amen to that that's true amen he said he can say to the uttermost even a 72y old man who has no signs of being saved he'll save him from suicide praise God Amen Hallelujah he can save to the uttermost Hallelujah he says and then God would take a poor Wretch like myself and give me the opport opportunity to preach the gospel and to see others saved see them healed see homes that's been broke up straightened up again so brother talking about the highlights of his ministry see how God saving me God healing up homes and families God's saving people hallelujah these are the highlights of Christianity amen a house that loves God children that love God Amen parents that love God that's a highlight that's a miracle Hallelujah see lives that's been ruined made right again and give me Grace I thought oh it's amazing race then come to a degra now this is how he describes degraded not upgraded we all like to upgrade our phones right I'm going to upgrade to a new laptop I'm going to upgrade to a better car I'm going to upgrade to what better clothes but he says the opposite of himself how you ever came to a low degraded he said low squirrel Hunter out in the woods and form himself in the form of a rainbow which means a covenant look what look what he's called himself so far and look how people describe oh we're the bride I'm the word I'm God made flesh I'm all this look how look and this is right after brother meets God amen amen right after he sees Jesus in a rainbow here's the voice of God he does he doesn't say I'm the bride look at me I'm the seven Church age messenger I'm the mighty prophet of God he said I'm a low degraded squirrel Hunter I'm a humble person of nothing he said it's God's Amazing Grace on me Hallelujah in other words the experiences don't make him Pride prideful the experiences make him humble praise God Amen that's right that's what real Christianity is it's experiences that make you more humble so you can follow God closer that's right so let's let's look again he's called degrad he calls himself degraded now in your soul let me say this in your soul you're upgraded brother amen you had 100% upgrade cu the Bible said your soul was dead in sins and trespasses Hallelujah but that you've been quickened or Made Alive by the holy spirit so your soul has received a 100% upgrade fully uploaded that's right I was watching all my apps down or upload yesterday that's right that's what happened in my soul one day sister H amen I raised my hands the Holy Ghost came on give me 100% now I'm sealed now I'm upgraded to the day of my Redemption Hallelujah but here's where we get the gred our mind and our flesh instead of getting uploaded sometimes we get degraded sometimes right we think degraded thoughts the church said we actually perform degraded actions yes brother man said you came to a degraded low squirrel Hunter remember what he call himself earlier poor illiterate wret like me Hallelujah this is how this is another reason how I know brother man's a true prophet of God that's right I don't hear any of these other people humbling themselves like this yeah yeah contrary to what they say brother's life was free from Scandal that's right free from Scandal he was true to his wife you know both were alive he was true to that one wife he didn't know how the taxes work so he had to do the IRS case Hallelujah but he lived the Gospel of Jesus Christ he preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ and he made it so real to me that I living and following it all my life amen l i i i gladly accept any rejection I'll gladly accept any criticism because I know brother and preach thus sayith the Bible amen I know it praise God nobody can talk me out of it praise God Amen because the holy spirit is The Giver of Revelation he's the spirit of Truth amen and we are lovers of the truth we are living the truth and we live by the truth praise God they can't talk me out of it because God's already show me the revelation of it amen amen amen praise God so we should be able to say Lord have pity on me I'm a poor no I'm sorry I'm a rich naturally I'm a rich literate wret I'm a degraded low school teacher factory worker whatever you are student thank he says thank you for Amazing Grace he said he gave me a message of Grace that he give me to preach and he formed it there in the Covenant that he's behind it so brother took that I saw that experience to show me God show me he's behind the one God teaching amen he's behind it Hallelujah then brother said now he show me he's behind my preaching on Grace I love it and this is one of the highlights of the sermon if you hear the people shout and brother man's voice he said and he's behind it and brother said he'll be behind it because the message is of Jesus Christ and His Glory Hallelujah I love it 1961 brother said Jesus is this message he'll be behind this message and let me say it now in 2024 Jesus is behind this message and he'll be behind this message you next Generation you stay with this message because Jesus Christ is behind you he's pushing one God he's pushing Lord Jesus Christ pushing Grace's three pushing Len he's behind that he's telling his creatures the preaching that's amazing gra Hallelujah he's not behind the compromising preachers the mega churches he's not behind that he's behind one thing that's his word hallelujah he'll be behind it because it's thus say the Bible am thus sayi the Lord hallelujah amen that's exactly right makes him so humble he said we've got theologians today we've got doctors of divinity we got great men all over the world that's smart intelligent educated but it takes the Simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday forever listen he said it takes a humble heart dedicated to God it brings Jesus Christ into the present tense he say see church this is what we want we want Jesus Christ to be in a present tense other words his spirit's right now teaching us and giving us what we have need of for our journey he's not something from the past or Jesus used to work here but now he don't work he should be present tense right here Among Us right know we know he's going to do in the future we know he's going to be there in the future but we got to recognize recognize he's present tense but brother said takes a humble heart that's dedicated to God now think about the times where God was most you're most convinced God was in your life you can get back to that it just takes a humble heart he says and dedication to God this is what I found church this what I found Satan he he just used his time to slowly introduce sins or slowly introduce uh uh Temptations in our life that slowly take away our devotion and dedication to God it's just something slow something small and then after time goes by and let's say this sin or this temptation goes greater and greater and and you know he tries to make us think sin isn't as bad as it is right but then one one day we just wake up and we realize my I I'm so far from where I used to be right and we just wake up that's the moment where we got to repent and say God I want you back in my life in a present tense amen I'm tired of of of thinking about oh it used to be like this God give me that feeling back praise God now many times you know got not all the time but many times God will use that in my life when I go preach to other places because I I see that I you know people always respond better you know when they haven't heard you very often you know just the natural but those are always times I I I saw Mal I think you know when we were out in uh Napoleon last year and then even down there in Kentucky I was telling the girls yeah we go into those atmospheres and like I don't know have any trouble with sin there's something really special about that Hallelujah but we just don't have to wait for those times we can have it anytime we want praise God but God God lets us go through Seasons so we can see right we can see that where we're letting up in our walk and then God can strengthen us to live stronger every single day amen hallelujah amen in other words keep ourselves keep our minds on fire this is what needs on fire right here amen you got the Holy Ghost thank God for that but you got to use that to let it get you on fire right here praise God so you can have a humble heart a humble mind and keep your mind dedicated to God Amen right and don't let your mind be uh used by the devil to bring certain imaginations into your mind just stay with your mind on God pure things amen amen unto the pure all things are pure amen hallelujah but said Jesus never came to theologians he came to Humble fishermen right so the the the smart the wise educated they wouldn't accept God's grace the way it came yeah right because they didn't want to change from their ways Grace is trying to show you this is the way out of all your legalism right the Pharisees Grace God's Jesus was trying to show them God's grace will bring you out of this false religion you're teaching Commandments of men right and it's vain worship yeah God's not receiving your worship cuz you have self-righteousness instead of God's righteousness Hallelujah I don't think we to spend too much time on legalism you know I've gone over that quite extensively you know but just remember you know legalism in the message is oh you have to have this certain type of clothes or this certain type of uh uh you have to recognize these certain type of holidays you know or not recognize certain types of holidays it's man-made righteousness I'm surprised church so many people forget take everything back to the word of God like a topic will come up and people instantly say brother said this and they just forget well what did the Bible say about that what the Bible say about does the have anything to say about this of course yes of course like like somebody online today just you know I was just going through the comments briefly they said oh you believe the tribulation seven years you're a heretic like that like what how does that even affect the G it has nothing to do with the Gentiles if you got the Holy Ghost you ain't going to be here exactly now maybe he's upset because you don't have the Holy Ghost and he's going to be here I said sir your Zeal has eaten up your wisdom you know just this this this man-made uh traditions of men yeah right creating your own righteousness Grace doesn't do that Grace doesn't create legalism amen Grace accepts God's word and Grace accepts just what God gives us to do praise God Amen it doesn't create it own self-righteousness now you might have to create boundaries in your life that keep you from sinning that's right and that might be a safeguard to you but you can't use it as legalism right so let me give some examples so like you and I we won't go to movie theaters right most of the time right now if they just have a Christian show uh we did a couple years ago we went to Pilgrim's Progress it was a beautiful movie but we I had to be I had to watch my children they were younger had to watch them don't look at those movie posters right you know let's walk the other way cuz there's some Evil movie posters over there there C there's certain safeguards now could someone walk into a movie theater and win a soul yes but we're not Jesus Jesus could sit with Sinners and publicans and prostitutes and the spirit of God he was always obedient and he knew that he'd bring them to repentance exactly but we set up for me I'll never I'll never drink alcohol in public I set that up as a a safeguard that I don't cause people to stumble that's right I don't want it I told my I said I'm I I have Godly fear I don't want people to take a picture hey there's a pastor at Applebees he's got and I want I don't want I don't want them to put that all over Facebook because that could cause people to stumble I'm fear I'm fearful of that that's good Godly fear amen because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom hallelujah amen you're not even wise yet until you fear God's so much that you hate sin when you hate sin now you just started wisdom amen amen now how many know God can restore your wisdom because like I said that's what the process is we have God gives us all the Zeal to hate sin but then through time the devil attacks our mind but God's got to bring us back to our first love and restore our wisdom amen amen everybody understand what I'm saying like Peter Peter had wisdom he had the Holy Ghost but remember legalism came in I'm not going to eat with the Gentiles see Satan slowly worked on him well these preachers you know they're going to say this if I do this and I I don't want to offend them but you're going to offend the Gentiles right see but slowly and it took somebody to walk up and put a finger right up under uh nature put your finger right up on my no under my nose and say you're the guilty one guilty one yeah that's what it that's what it take a preacher now you wouldn't do it in the service you probably did it outside the service cuz we want everything Godly in order right reverent order and she he said Peter you're the guilty one that's what he need he need reminded to go back to his first love that's right oh God grace saved us both that's right the wall has been torn down the wall between the Jew and Gentile has been torn down but we have to set up safeguards in our lives amen and for some of you it might be a a a partner for accountability you might need an accountability partner mhm to overcome something for a while right where you can check in with someone that say check up on me make sure I'm doing okay by God's grace set up safeguards what if you have private property and someone's in your yard all the time what would you do You' put up a fence yes you put up a safeguard so we must do that spiritually put up safeguards in our lives to protect us hallelujah amen now brother said I'm trying to close where we at oh okay wow 11:30 I know you've been all happy nobody's fallen asleep so I might preach a little bit longer brother said Grace is old Grace is I'll say like this grace is eternal Grace is as old as the world is Grace was first shown to the human race when he had the beginning of the human race when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dark morning when that little woman had stepped across the separating line brother man said he's just dramatizing he said but when Eve did what she did with the he said all the clouds gathered all over instead of light now all the clouds came and it became dark for the first time he said and she gone away from God's commandment and enticed her husband to do the same and then the law was broken sin he said the law must have a penalty or isn't a law the day you eat thereof the day you shall surely die it was a process of dying right it wasn't immediate it was a process said oh how it was terrible he said but when Jehovah come out I could imagine there wasn't even a star to shine it was so dark in that light little garden that once was because sinid blotted out had taken the light from among them so brother dramatized the clouds came over it was totally dark what did ad do they went and hid in the bushes they got some fig leaves together and covered up just their private parts only they they covered up their private parts only and God comes walking down in the midst of I love it God working in darkness amen just like at the beginning Hallelujah the pillar of fire amen it rotated around the earth it shined upon the Earth though Earth was without form and void and it was dark but God sent light to the darkness amen church God always sends light to the darkness your Darkness amen amen God will come walk in the midst of your Darkness amen and say say where are you I missed that time talking with you in prayer this morning where are you I miss I miss talking to you when you didn't read your Bible this morning where are you and church it might be weeks months or years but he's going to come looking for you if you're a child of his he's going to come looking for you you we ought to be happy this morning amen thank you Jesus if you're a child of God he's going to come looking for you where were you where are you now he knows where you are he wants you to say where you are he wants you to be like the prodigal like let's say if you're backing or something he wants you to be like the prodigal and say wow I've come to myself look where I am I'm eating dirty food I'm eating pigs food I'm eating on the things of the world surely I can do better than this surely God has a life for me surely my father has a better life for me than this Glory praise God surely there's Grace in My Father's House Hallelujah amen surely daddy would take me back even as a servant surely he would surely there's Grace I just must confess my sin against heaven and against my father and church that's when you're finally in your right mind you recognize your sin you confess it to God and you confess it to your other friends hallelujah or family or someone you sinned against Hallelujah that's when you know you're right with God you ready to confess the depths of your dirtiness or your Darkness I'll say like that amen man was so dark Jehovah's walking around he said then he says Darkness hanging in the garden he said I'll imagine a a fog of black sackcloth he said I imagine every leaf never even moves there's no wind just darkness and fog all around there was no wind stirring we out I think we're here at the church yesterday and boy there's just a beautiful wind blowing through I'm like this is natural air conditioning I I need need you need it when it's 89 degre Hallelujah but he said there with the sin there's no wind it was darkness and terrible because sin had bled out then Jehovah come down like a roar of Thunder walking through the garden crying Adam Where Art Thou amen bride of Christ Fellowship where are you hallelujah amen if you don't give God this is kind of like a communion message amen if you don't give God the fellowship he'll in his grace he'll come looking for us saying where are you I miss our time together why are you hiding from me I want to I want to have fellowship with you that's what God does in his grace amen amen hallelujah that's what his Mercy does he comes out and says where are you I'd like to spend some time with you amen but first we got to get the sin problem solved we got to take care of the sin issue he said to come down like thunder saying Adam Where Art Thou that's when Adam realized he was naked and sinned before God he' hid himself and tried to make himself a religion but it didn't work remember the word religion means covering that's true now that's one that's one meaning covering the another one is just Pious or reverence okay there's two religions so religion can mean a covering but it could also mean a Pious life a reverent life that's right that's why the Bible says in James 1 pure religion is to visit uh the widows and the child the fatherless in their Affliction and to keep himself listen unspotted from the world Amen Lord keep every spot of sin off my life amen keep my phone help me be unspotted from my phone help me to be unspotted with my friendships and my relationships help me to be unspotted with money amen help me unspotted with my thought life and my actions help me to be unspotted from sin now you're into some pure religion Hallelujah now you're really trying to live reverently before God hallelujah now I'm going try to bring this down to the close here by God's grace but R said there the his couple stood condemned there would be no human race they had to die death on the human race go he said God would have had to give back if there's no Grace God he said God would have gave the world back to wild beasts and there had been no human race but in the darkest hour when all hopes was gone Grace came pouring through and said I'll give you a savior I'll give you a messiah amen Genesis 3:15 amen hallelujah glory to God the woman's seed will bruise the head of the serpent Hallelujah think about that ad and Eve had fallen to The Serpent and God promised Eve I'm going to give you a seed I'm going to make you your Offspring conceive a seed and that seed will bruise this awful serpent it'll bruise his head that's caused you to fall into this disgrace amen hallelujah though you've fallen in disgrace I'm going to give you Grace and this Messiah is going to bring your race back to me hallelujah oh such Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound hallelujah amen God could have just let both of them die but he didn't because he was showing he's always a god of Grace amen said if it was Grace at the beginning Oh Glory it'll be Grace at the End Amen Grace from the beginning Grace for the Rapture Hallelujah Grace for God's race [Music] amen it's a wonder how God could ever do it God's Amazing Grace in the Garden of Eden that give us the promise of the just one Jesus who would come through the woman the woman's seed will bruise the Serpent's head that's the guilty one his head shall bruise her heel to show there be Affliction to the church but he promised a Triumph MH what provided savior Grace provided the Savior amen Church listen we're provided a Triumph we're not just going to squeak by and get a win we're going to have a triumph over sin amen praise God hallelujah all the pressure of the mark of the beast and start coming around but that's going to all that's all going to move us into a more dedicated walk with God amen amen that's right and then the anointing will come just like it did for Enoch GL just as the anointing came for Rapture for him by Grace it'll come for us by Grace hallelujah amen that's right he just walked with God his me me dedicated brother I said we need a dedicated life before God hallelujah a humble heart with a dedicated walk towards God Amen and God's grace will provide us for a body change just like it did for Enoch who remember was a humble agricultural man he's a humble farmer that's all he was he wasn't nothing great he wasn't a great special man there's no records of him out in the earth you know there's no other than that pyramid We Believe by God's grace supernaturally formed but there's no other record he was just a humble man agricultural man that was ordained he was a prophet too he prophesied that Jesus would come back with 10,000 of his Saints he prophesied the battle of Armageddon Hallelujah just a humble man that God was able to bring in to a close walk with him he said because you walk with me I'm going to take you home in the Rapture you're the seventh from Adam we're the seventh from Paul hallelujah we're the seventh from St Paul the seven church we got to walk with him we got to be dedicated and God's grace will provide rapturing Grace amen I'm trying to close bear with me here I feel so good today amen talk about a Triumph amen what could Adam and Eve show to Merit Grace what could they do to earn this Grace what could they do brother Ram said they didn't do anything he said what they did they kept passing the buck he said it's an army expression I don't know I've never been in the Army but God said Adam look what you done what did Adam do Eve she made me do it he should have said no it's my fault I knew better but what do we do what do we do when we sin well was that fault that fault that fault no the fult right here yes this is the Fault right here he said so see grace had to make way even even when we make excuses Grace will make a way to cover our sins amen amen and bring us to a real confession Adam said no Eve Eve said wasn't me God said no you're all guilty amen you're all guilty and God proved it when he said I'm driving you think about this I'm driving you out of my presence go to Genesis 3 we're going to close this go to Genesis 3:21 Church there has to be consequences our mistakes that doesn't mean we're less children of God it just means God is trying to teach us something Adam knew better Eve knew better to some degree now she was deceived in that act but she knew better not to eat of the tree she did know better God told her and Adam Genesis 3:21 okay now remember verse 20 said this shows how Eve was already pregnant in verse 20 and Adam called his wife's names Eve because she was the mother of all living she's already pregnant most people recognize Genesis 4:1 is where Eve has her first uh pregnancy but it's actually earlier because that proves it she's already a mother of all living verse 21 and unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them cover them so he gave them real religion a sacrifice covered their sins a blood sacrifice covered their mistakes that's what we've got we've got a blood sacrifice that covers all our mistakes amen now what did that did they deserve that no God's grace did that brother labing on that what could they do to Merit Grace nothing God had to give it to them they kept passing the bucks but man said there's no hopes for them but God provided Grace and it come breaking through when love broke through remember it all dark it was all dark and there got their man-made religions right their man-made traditions and God's love breaks through that's right it says but I'm going to make you a sacrifice I'm going to cover your sins you're not going to die yet that was God's grace amen am if you eat you die but I'm going to give you Grace I'm going to give you a covering so you don't feel as ashamed as you as you would cuz they're already ashamed they felt ashamed in their in their reproductive parts they covered themselves El and brother said but God said I'll Make A Way somehow I'll save you regardless you've done wrong you've trespassed my laws the Judgment for my laws will have to be executed therefore there'll have to be a death because I've said death God said because you sin you shall die something's got to die because I said something has to die that's right if you sin the grace was promised in the Garden of Eden and Grace came Grace came to Adam and Eve nowhere to go no way to turn and yet Grace made a away oh my they were staring death in the face but God made a way to show them Mercy hallelujah amen they knew the only thing the only consequence was death but God's grace Ste and said I'm going to give you Mercy Hallelujah you don't deserve it but I'm giving you my grace Hallelujah God's grace Made A Way amen where the only way was death but God's grace gave up heart paron he said let me say this sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute and brothers think about prostituting your minds that's what Jesus said right you may be a prostitute you may be hear this morning a woman Chaser you may be hear a drunker or a g or a murderer now remember murder if you hate somebody Without a

said now Adam and Eve know what sin can do we know what it was cuz we saw it in heaven first and now let he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever God knew it wasn't time for them to live and take the tree of life and live forever that's Sav for the New Jerusalem remember brother the Bible said that the Nations will will eat the fruit and the Bible said the leaves will be for the healing of Nations they're going to be passing out some that's what we need some apples for Hallelujah for healing amen apples didn't cause the fall but God's going to use some fruit and some leaves amen he's going to pass those around for the Nations to be healed quite a quite a story verse 23 therefore the Lord God s sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from when he was taken so look at this here's what I want to get to so he drove out the man and placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to
