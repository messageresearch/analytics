raise meeting unless standing around it's very inspiring a metalic reach on the wise and foolish virtuous morning praise the Lord said I've been doing at the kingdom of heaven series so I just kind of felt led to go this way studied all morning on the wise and foolish virgin again I I know I preach on a little bit here and there and we had a just a tremendous service a couple Wednesday nights ago sister when I was preaching on the wise a foolish virgin and sister Beatrice was dancing screaming shouting and just got all in the spirit it was really glorious a few weeks ago yeah but I was a yeah you can stand right here buddy sorry about that so um I know it's inspired and it's nice to have another vindication there by the grace of Lord Matthew 25 verse 1 you know they're singing about it is well with my soul the wise virgin has oil in her soul praise God let's for time sake let's just read one verse let's just reverse ten by God's grace that's kind of the the rapture scripture there let's all read it together on three of them brother was they worried afterwards one two three and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut let's have our brother read it there be no LFO so Alaska davin prefer Alice and Clare on con él a la bola is a roll of word amen a goddess bus in Rio is word may be seated here so I do have some slides Lydia we can show by God's grace we've been looking at the sixteen parables of the kingdom of heaven and so I want to continue on that today we've preached on three about stewardship now this is within the last few months two of them about endtime conditions tore about the Jews and the Gentiles we preached on the great supper on Wednesday I'm sorry it was the wicked husbandmen that was Wednesday we preached to about sin and also on Wednesday we looked at the king's son that concludes with the man who didn't have the Garmadon and let me just share a little testimony you know I believe these sermons are letter the Lord we've heard multiple preachers preach on the same subjects I just heard brother Samuel preach on it on last Thursday night dealing with finding your position and then Wednesday's message was really inspired as well and here's how I know because our girls went home and the next day they were talking to my wife about being born again you see it takes uh sincere heart to want that that means God is dealing with hearts because cold hearts or backslidden hearts they won't examine themselves but Paul said our real Christian examines himself whether they're in the faith praise the Lord so I just want to share that as a little testimony by God's grace so you keep praying keep praying for these little ones and we'll pray for the adults we want everybody to have the oil because if you got it you'll be watching you'll be praying you'll be ready and we'll look at that today by God's grace now Lord willing Wednesday we'll start looking at the salvation parables [Music] they're all very simple but they have some great truths they someway simplified a feeling grounded for life remember they all relate to the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom the word kingdom means Dominion or rule so the kingdom of heaven is the rule of the Holy Ghost how he rules in our daily lives so this is how God wins our love and affection through salvation so this salvation begins your love relationship with the Lord when you first get saved isn't Jesus your treasure isn't he or one pearl that's greater than all the others of course the other ones deal with you no laboring or I'm sorry other ones deal with eternal life and forgiveness because you can't be saved unless you forgive others now the last ones beautiful it shows the three works of grace but the emphasis of that parable is God's unseen work member the man goes to sleep he wakes up and then the the plant has sprouted up the man goes to sleep but when he wakes up the plant has sprouted up and the man doesn't know how but that's the glory of being saved you don't know how it happened but Jesus gave you life so that's the beauty of it and we'll get to those Lord willing on Wednesday now this was the revelation I preached when the Holy Ghost fell on that Wednesday night when Beatrice was screaming and dancing in the spirit so the revelation was the foolish virgin doesn't do these things so the foolish virgin doesn't obey enough they obey a lot but not enough and they they don't hunger and thirst enough brother Branham said it perfectly he said you have a partial hunger but we have to have a full hunger a full thirst amen remember this is all based upon the scripture Paul said if you obey God will give you the Holy Ghost that's an X 532 jesus said if you hunger and thirst for righteousness you'll be filled with you five verse six and then Jesus said if you ask you'll receive the spirit Luke 11:13 how many believe that see God came and vindicated on that Wednesday night brother Ray was here but the Aaron was here and then they Omi's family was here and it was just almost three are they almost a three-hour service so it was wonderful to see God vindicate this as a revelation because God always backs up his word amen so that with this foundation here you know with this revelation then we want to take a fresh look at the wise and foolish virgins okay now this parable differentiates two kinds of Christians and there's always been two kinds of Jews even the Old Testament - simple exam I'm sorry three simple examples are Enoch and Noah remember Enoch was dedicated that's what his name means no was a preacher of righteousness but he got drunk on wine and had to endure the tribulation of the flood so hope everybody can see there's two kinds of believers what I mean is two kinds of genuine believers praise God there was Abraham and lot Abraham lived away from Sodom lot lived among Sodom for riches and he lost his wife and he was tormented every day by the atmosphere of Sodom then there was David and Saul David was a man after the message of the hour which is the heart of God but saul was after popularity and wasted most of his adult life trying to murder God's elect but Samuel said he was saved did you know it was four years after Samuel died four years after he died the witch called him up that's because they didn't have the blood of Jesus Christ to protect them God it was impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin and Satan had the keys of death in hell but when Jesus died and shed his blood the bible says through death he destroyed death and his righteous life was a substitution for our lives and they paid what the bible called the ransom he paid the punishment that all sins deserved and he became our sin that we might be as righteousness so he took the keys of death in hell he said come on Saints follow me up praise God and he resurrected and the Bible said he opened the graves Labriola squirt but he first opened his grave amen and then the other graves were open and they appeared unto many praise God I'm sorry and the Saints appeared unto many in Jerusalem so this is the power of the Holy Spirit God still save Saul but Samuel said David was better than he was [Music] then these two kinds of Christians are the good ground and the thorny ground you know the good ground is the honest heart so listen church the only real message believers are the fully honest ones the only message believers the only true message believers are the honest ones I think at the end someone else because jesus said the good heart is the honest heart okay that means the wise Virgin is going to come to church hear the word of God and be honest with themselves and the church about their spiritual condition but the foolish virgins not that honest right because they the Bible said they have cares of the world and it chokes out the life of the word praise God so we want to be honest with ourselves this morning we want to honestly look at our lives praise God so see these two kinds of believers have always existed you know now let me read uh some history on the it's called the ancient Jewish marriage ceremony in Antigua ceremony I love you dear Matthew Henry says Henry Henry do you think the bridegroom came in the days of the Jews surrounded by his friends late in the night to the house of the bride where she expected him and she had her bridesmaids gathered around her when they knew he was approaching they were to go out to meet him with lamps in their hands and then go to either the father's house or back to the groom's house his own house because one historian says it was the father's house one says it was back to the groom's house so now we have the picture of the rapture the ten virgins represent both the bride and her bridesmaids because they're waiting with the Virgin's means no intercourse physically and spiritually right because in the parable is physical but in the spiritual I'm sorry but in the and then in the in the type it's spiritual praise God in other words we have we have no spiritual intercourse with the world Jesus is our only love interest we only give our love to Christ we don't flirt with the world if we get a temptation we overcome it we cast it down Paul said we're chase virgins which means means uncorrupted it means not deceived from the simplicity that's in Christ praise God oil is a symbol of the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah chapter 4 let's just turn there for the children to see that try before matthew i'm matteo zechariah chapter 4 o Sicarius capital o quattro now we're not gonna read all of it but in verse 2 there's a candlestick all of gold with the ball upon the top of it and seven lamps their own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are on the top thereof and two olive trees by it one on the right side and one on the left now verse 6 it says this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord vs. unicornia spirit toward each other while senior now in verse 9 you can see some compound prophecy because it says the hands of zerubu & hill finish it you know like our lamb so in this time the two olive trees are Haggai and Zechariah those live a song a hell it's a Korean praise the Lord now this brings an interesting thought because a lot of people major on one doctrine from brother Branham I'm sorry one statement from brother Branham and they make it say like God never sends two prophets at the same time now from that looks like the scripture God does send two prophets sometimes because there's two prophets right here in Zechariah 4 and then there's two prophets in revelation 11 in the days of Paul there was Paul there's abacus you know the other power of those baba yaga bow now we know Paul was the major prophet trkage messenger I hope that doesn't stumble everybody here I don't think it will but it will stumble Branham worshipers I know how many know that's the wind of doctrine blown right now Tina random worshippers it is so you see this is speaking of two prophets and they both are fed I'm sorry these two trees feed the oil there into the seven church ages because in verse 12 it says these two olive branches get significant other dramas through the two golden pipes the earth and the sea SAT empty the golden oil out of themselves amen amen so you see that when a prophet is fulfilling his ministry Laurie he's pouring out his oil he's manifesting Christ that's what our lives should be when people look at our lives they should see life from it never in the American Billa hallelujah thank the Lord that's in your see their their oil was flowing out and it lit up the church ages our lives should show the light of the church ages if we're burning with the oil praise the Lord see it's a emptying out of ourselves in other words we've got to let the Holy Spirit flow out of our lives we can't get our flus all clogged up we've got to let the Holy Spirit flow we've got to believe they meant we've got to trust God gotta obey the word we got to shine the love of Christ verse 14 he says these are the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth who you standing by today church we want to stand by Christ amen praise the Lord now just one more point even the days of Ezekiel and Jeremiah and Isaiah if you look at some of the years they ministered there was an overlap of their lives in other words you had major prophets on the earth at the same time they were just ministering in different locations I challenge anybody to read that in the scripture praise the Lord so it's not to exalt ourselves above brother Branham but to continue this exercise dividing the Word of God and the reason we do it is to go against that spirit that will worship brother Branham only Jesus Christ gets worshipped and it doesn't stumble a real Christian to say we take everything a man says back to Christ you'd be surprised how many people that stumbles but I ain't gonna stumble the bride Church because she's not Maren Eleazar she's marrying Christ amen I got to bring that out there because it's important I want the children to see that Zechariah for now children can you see that now our lives are supposed to let the Holy Spirit flow out and that manifests the light of Christ for this day yeah I'll just share a quick testimony I was a Bible Club and the man teaching he stopped the teaching of about 60 kids and he walked all the way back to where I was in front of all the kids he said mr. Smith is a real Christian he said I work with men all around the world I mean country I mean country not the world but he said mr. Smith is one of the most righteous men of all of them and I'm sharing that so you'll see that our lives are different than the foolish virgin for encima the infant's happens if you have two lamps and one's burning and one's not they won't dump on our you and I sense empty they know you ought to see a great difference between them your life and my life should look so different and it manifested everything we do we're supposed to keep our word if we promise to pay something we pay it we promise to pray for somebody we need to pray for them if we promise anything we must keep our word why because we're a part of the word Jesus Christ is the word and he keeps his word and if we're a part of the word we keep our word I'm sad about all the compromising in the world but it gives us a chance to be the real believer who doesn't compromise hallelujah thank the Lord now in the parable the foolish only had oil in their lamps so the foolish only have oil in here but the Bible said the wise have extra oil in their vessels with their lamps so they've got a separate portion separate from their lamp what can I say like this their human spirit see that the the foolish had oil in their minds but they didn't have extra oil in their soul see everything else is the same the flesh is the same with the bullish virgin I'm talk about your life in my life the flesh will be the same between the wise and the foolish virgin the sin in your flesh will battle you it will grieve you what you will feel and the attraction towards sin in your flesh you will learn to hate it if you don't already you ought to and then the mind battles the same two because they we both want the anointing in our human spirits and a foolish virgin can be virgin in her mind she can keep out all the idols through quoting the words she can cast out every temptation and she won't build an idol in her life but the difference is is the soul of the individual the nature of the individual the soul is the nature of the Spirit when people die their body stays here but that human spirit moves either up or down and that human spirit is supernatural did you know Cain's human spirit soul is still alive this morning it's awaiting judgment it's waiting for judgement that's will not be there with you it's in the prison house in hell tonight 5,000 years later it's still alive see we changed location but our character stays the same our nature stays the same amen so the only difference between a wise and foolish is the nature the nature that rules the life with me because it's the kingdom the rule of heaven so our life will be ruled more by the word then forced version if you can't see it yet in your life I pray you'll see you soon if you don't see it enough you probably don't hang around enough foolish virgin right because we're so busy with our work and then church you know I've been around a lot of Christians first virgin lately these last few years look they got enough discernment to stay away from rap today let's use music as an example rap yeah music rap music well I thought I sent them a multi-car up so that they know rap music is wrong today but it's okay to listen to older music from time to time you know like Michael Jackson and the Beatles Aretha Franklin see because it doesn't bother their nature now when they got the noin ting on their minds it bothers them [Music] but that anointing in their mind leaves because it's only a temporary anointing Goren but the soul anointing is permanent and so that's why we hear the music but very quickly the nature disagrees with it not or anything I mean let me say this clearly my flesh is guilty of singing along with worldly music even after I've been a Christian but as soon as it gets down to my soul the nature shuts it down yeah sometimes I'll catch my foot tap into worldly music just because I'm in a restaurant but as soon as it starts to try to get down into my soul there's a seal there there's a defense there it tells it to stop and go back to hell amen that's the only difference between the wise and the foolish see this has been revealed to me lately as you meditate upon the word see because the soul is the nature we've got an extra portion just hang it on kind of hang in there on our belt of righteousness joy truth melts the truth which represents an external anointing in the soul hallelujah everything else is the same use we've seen foolish virgins that have power love and sound minds let me say this thank God for it I'm all for the foolish virgins where they met glory sister Wendy I'm all about supporting them I'll pray for them because I know which side their they're trying to fight on they're trying but they're turning down the power or resources that we're supposed to have amen and so because the anointing is temporary in the mind the foolish virgin gets tricked [Music] to wasting time with worldly cares and because of that they can't fully focus on the Word of God like sports is a great example like sports is a great like baseball or baseball or football so I know foolish virgins that'll watch sports but there are times they'll turn it off if they have some special services so see they can get the victory sometimes but many times they waste their time with worldly cares and they wonder why they can't move on with God praise the Lord we're moving on with God we're not turning back to the world we're not picking up worldly habits see we're redeeming the time and the key to this parable is time because she went and prepared the oil beforehand it was only preparation that's the only thing that separated them one prepared oil beforehand the other didn't so if you just picture the foolish version only had one vessel of oil but the wise had to double anointing glory hallelujah I'm one of that's what that means I just direct me right there double anointing got anointing in the human mind thank God for it because with that anointing I was with that one anointing when I was in the dominations I was able to cast down beer cigarettes cussing swearing using cuss words curses dirty movies but still I wasn't born again but once born again I was able to overcome greater enemies I think the greatest enemy I have over overcome my enemy go I see since becoming a Holy Ghost real Christian has been complexes because that was brother Graham's last battle last spiritual battle before he passed away he got here to the stomach trouble a month before he passed away but his greatest spiritual battle before he died was complexes hallelujah now I know many foolish virgin many and it's sad because they Harbor complexes for decades and ice I'll just share like this to be general I see it my family I'm not talk about my message family I'm talking about my non message family and I just don't want to share the specific examples but it's bitterness see that's what Satan tries to get in message churches roots of bitterness to get one person disliked in another mkhaya mejor que no attack see cuz he's trying to establish the roots the long-term victory see Esau had roots of bitterness the Bible said that and he couldn't find a place to repent see but the good heart up roots all that and just keeping the heart pure is the great victory and that's the sign of the why's virgin she keeps her heart and mind pure from all the weeds and roots of bitterness hallelujah a few more symbols here mass now I'm gonna pull this up I preached this foolish virgin three years ago I'm just gonna hit a few highlights in a moment so let's get back to the parable the bridegroom tarring represents Jesus waiting in heaven the midnight cry is the Ministry of brother Branham because the shout is what wakes both virgins and brother Brahim said the bride is awakened she's awake amen the mystery of the rapture is the shout voice and [Music] trumpet that's the mystery of it it was shared with me recently I agree the meeting in the air is not mysterious everyone believes there's going to be a meeting in the air that's not the mysterious part the mysterious part is the shout right because every denomination can know there's a meeting in the air but only the children of God can hear the shout praise God and recognize it is the shout in other words recognize brother Rams ministry was the Holy Ghost shout that was pointing us to Christ to get ready for Jesus that's the mystery the voice is the voice of Resurrection for the sleeping dead because the dead in Christ rise first so everything's on time the shouts still going out I heard it in 2001 where they met heard it in 2014 amen you you can all say the year you heard it praise God the shout is still going one of these days it's gonna awaken some Saints in Thailand amen Simon's going again next month in October Simon's going with Ron next month back to Thailand I see them $1,000 first ticket we're gonna keep supporting missionaries a little more heavy I've had that drop in my heart I'm gonna send a quarter of our income to missionaries Ganges Eunice millions of souls in Thailand have not heard the shout so it needs to go out praise God amen thank God for the shouting saying wake up get ready praise God trip your lips lamp trimming member is sanctification amen the foolish version will be sanctified just does it go far enough just not enough because Jesus said if you ask okay so this I can see two peas you receive my recipe if you hunger Ambree I'll feed you a lemon if you obey everything I'll give you the Holy Ghost amen see they get so close but so far away that's the mystery of the rapture you be surprised how many people say the raptures already happened we were talking about a hint that is a castle I mean there are some things going around I'm sorry there are some world events that look like tribulation but it's not the the level of tribulation that we see in the book of Revelation and we also see people waking up China's waking up how do you guard this waking up glory well these days Thailand is going to wake up virgins are waking up all over the world the shower is still going out amen god help us to keep shouting Amen now brother Rams off the scene now it's your turn to shout my turn to shout hallelujah thank the Lord see both kinds wake up when they hear the message of the hour both remove the carbon from the wick nature so they're burning as brightly as possible I have some foolish version friends they burn pretty bright breanne cemente but they won't be able to burn as long as the wise virgin praise God because they don't have enough oil ooh yeah the foolish realize they don't have enough oil can no tienen sufficient your safety and they try to take it from the wise but the wise virgins are so humble they're honest and they say I can't give you the Holy Ghost why do people say brother Branham gave them the Holy Ghost shows they're not wise virgins because no man can give it John the Baptist said i baptize you with water but there's one coming after me praise the Lord whose minor than ally J there and he's the one that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost ease things up as we go along in conversations with people oh brother Branham said I'd brother man gave me the Holy Ghost or something like that John the Baptist can't give the Holy Ghost well RAM can baptize you in water well he could have but he cannot give the Holy Ghost the wise virgins prove that you've got to go to the one who gives the oil the thing was they could have done that their whole lives mercy it just struck me right there they could have been doing this brother bang their whole lives but they act like they forgot and they must have forgot because of the attractions and the cares of the world watch your foot on the pedal now okay what I mean claim now though so see they could have made time to get it but they didn't not only theorem and so the wise tell them go pray up by an hour ah doesn't that make a clear Church the foolish read revelation 3:18 Jesus says by of me go dry in the fire you'll be rich white raiment to be clothed and I saw that you can see equally upon us all better the foolish read the same Bible we do but they're more concerned with physical transactions rather than spiritual transactions like prayer como la nación again the foolish virgin didn't repent enough they repent enough to get saved they didn't pray enough they didn't obey enough so they cannot be filled when the foolish go to buy oil the door shut and that should remind us of Noah's day now we know Noah doesn't type the bride but this is a Noah condition this day from luke 1730 remember as it was the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the Son of Man so the imagery of the door shutting is very fitting for this day and just as the believers gathered to one location Holy Ghost filled Saints are gathering to one location and that's gathering to Christ Christ is the word and the word is preached at your church amen but we know it's more than just physically at a church it's being in heavenly places amen in other words the spirit the condition of a person who's born again that's where we're gathered we call heavenly places whether I see one of you at the the store whether I see you at the store whether I see at my house or see you here at church we're all always get in the same place it's heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen see we're under the rule or Dominion of Christ that is the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven is in you hallelujah I mean so that's why we can use Noah and connected to our day he's both Enoch and Noah amen now he concludes the parable by saying watch that means give strict attention caution now let's let's talk about that someone who's born again is very cautious about what they decide to do they don't make just quick decisions they pray about it to make sure it's Father's will because they're watching they don't want anything to distract them from the coming ride guru so the rapture requires your full attention we must be actively working in his kingdom the Greek also says the Greek language also says we must take heed that we don't fall into remission and slothfulness and slothful laziness Oh and then suddenly overtaken like the foolish como los ins and Santos so watching Londo means we're always active at the post of duty praise the Lord now here's the Greek meanings of wise and foolish wise means you're intelligent foolish just means impious now godless there means without the seal the holy ghost because God is the seal now there's a Greek meanings of version I kind of got over that there's no idolatry totally chaste towards Christ okay so I just want to say this I'm sorry the I should have used a different font but it says you can be free from idols and cleaned out without being filled it just came to me Matthew 12 Jesus said there's your euro you are a house Jesus says and as a sinner you're full of demons but you got to have the strong hand of faith and drive out the demons but then the house is cleaned out but it's still not filled Laurie there it is right there beautiful picture the foolish virgin gets all the demons out doesn't let Christ come in fully right fully beautiful picture so as we'll see the foolish did not put the time into it [Music] because in the parable the oil had to be prepared ahead of time and now's our time to prepare it amen now like I said I'm going to skip ahead here yeah I want to read this I read this three years ago but I'm sure we've all forgot it Matthew Henry said this the foolish virgin do not have time to get the Holy Ghost when the bridegroom is coming see getting grace are receiving the Holy Ghost is a work of time you can't do it in a hurry we've all seen it my back these last five years I've seen more people that I thought had the Holy Ghost turn around and leave the truth proven they didn't have it buh-bam says in one quote he said unless God reveals it there's no way to know who has it really less God will reveal to you Saints I'm find that to be the reality I think people have it hope they think I have it with our lives prove it our obedience proves it our prayer life proves it our hunger proves it our thirst proves it amen hallelujah see it it takes time to be born again how many mothers kid that I've had a baby could say amen to that it takes time to have a birth takes time can do in a hurry you're doing a hurry there's gonna be a lot of pain that I know try to push that baby out before time it's gonna be a lot of pain we can damage the baby and the mother I know what I'm talking about I've got seven got a witness see there to mouth of two witnesses you talk to any doctor trying to hurry the fourth the birth always a damaging thing you gotta let nature take its course amen you gotta let God have his way we gotta let God's three works of grace take their course amen praise God I just want to share a few things here now concerning our gifts now the reason I have preached on gifts the reason I didn't teach on gifts the new name look Naomi wouldn't be here and she's a pillar in the church just like all of our members then it turned out you know Karen was sick so is a vindication you know misuk and my wife can't be here so I feel vindicated on holding off but look what my mom says he said oh my can't they see that the sleeping Church they let the oil go out of their lamp now really they just didn't take the oil but you understand they never entered into this they never let Christ here it is take control so he could work miracles and speak with tongues and do wonders and things to prove that he lived in his church a see giving him full control given all your time all your efforts watching giving strict attention to see that that's the connection to gifts so you can't have you know if you have the giver you have the gifts praise God very confident in that now some of these were very familiar with yeah some of these I've already gone over yeah now just just so you know a few years ago someone approached me that was a part of our church at that time and we're sure the foolish virgins weren't saved in San Saba Salva and there are two quotes that say that but the majority of them say they are saved the majority say they are saved so let me go through a few of those the five foolish virgins were not lost 1961 no they were not lost there to be judged according to the way they treated the light but they were not lost the sleeping virgin will be saved of course she'll be saved at the judgment she is the same group of people they are to be saved there'll be the sheep on his right side yeah we remember this I just want to go over him again the sleeping version comes up purged and has white robes on she'd been purged and given white robes she's not the bride but it's a pure people the house is cleaned out just not filled our lives should be so different because he's in the house amen rise to that song amen when he's in the house death has to flee a man dead works amen that habits that conflicts dead complexes amen it has to flee because life is in the house amen they're really sincere in heart God knows their heart there was a virgin but didn't have any oil the virgin Rises you know in the last day at the White Throne but not the bride 1964 now the sleeping virgin he says is not to be saved during that time now he means saved from the destruction of the tribulation she's already been saved see see those those people in the evangelical churches they're saved it's a small group just like the bride but she saved but she's been rejected in the bride goes to the tribulation period for purification because she rejected Christ the word does that help my this helps me tremendously because I have so many friends that accept accept the truth but not the full revelation they believe in Jesus but not the seven seals Amen or the seven church age is Amen or serpent seed or marriage in divorce they can accept the cross and the power to clean out their house but they can't write the let the rest of the word come in for purification the first version is saved now see here from eternal death now so we'll look at tonight I'm trying to close here tonight I want to preach on hell's not eternal meditating it on meditating on it this week writing a youtube script whole field yeah and hoping I'll record it this week but look the bush version saved from the second death but goes to the tribulation now people even say today and misquote brother Branham and say there's no salvation for the foolish version that doesn't line up with the quotes or the Bible most importantly the Bible because she saved she comes up at the white throne judgment let's just read it one more time Matthew 25 in the sheep and the goats look how Jesus addresses the foolish virgin verse 34 then shall the King say unto them on his right hand yeah I'm sorry 2530 for my fault brother forgive me dear ah I love this other nature beneath Bandito demi padre de el rey no preparado para nosotros did they love from the sandal mundo thank you I know you were the whole thing good he said come he blessed are the foolish virgin curse no they're blessed of the father and inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world amen this is after the Millennium so what kingdom are they get inherit the kingdom outside the city right that's right because the bride will not leave the husband and shall live in the new city that's a reward Amen for faithful watching hallelujah 434 oh babe rain falling it over Jesus amen that's a reward she'll never leave aside amen hallelujah but the foolish is blessed lot was blessed with salvation no was blessed saw was blessed and the foolish virgin will be blessed here the two misunderstood quotes now in the first quote later on he says that the nominal believers are saved by fire so let's look at the first quote he said after the bride is raptured well any of the foolish virgin be saved yeah well I'm sorry well any of the foolish virgin be saved he says no no that's a lot of reading he says it again will the first version be saved no because he says there in the state of revelation 22 11 [Music] we are the holy that are holy still but lot was called a righteous man and he that's righteous is righteous still now here's where he says the nominal churches are hungry for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the nominal believers like lot he's going through the tribulation period and be saved as it were by fire the church lukewarm anything outside the bride will go through the tribulation period and then he quotes Matthew 25 about the foolish virgin like sheep call me blessed of my father and there's one quote that's the quote this misunderstood but heavy as you keep reading it he said the nominal saved by fire so the revelation is this the foolish version are saved eternally but not saved from the wrath of the tribulation that's what it means and people misunderstand those quotes which it's understandable if you don't pray enough and study enough here's the quote about the first version taking the mark of the beast and we had a man just come in a few years ago and he preached that the first version take the mark of the beast and it got real quiet that was proud of your church not saying Amen on that because the first versions eternally saved the Bible says so but see they take one quote and then the other we just saw and either brother branham misquoted or he forgot what he taught and so that event just majored on this quote so you have to balance out all the quotes and line it up with the word so 1961 when the sleeping virgin went out which already received the mark of the beast you say mark of the beast yes indeedy so the game received the mark and went out I see it goes talking about Jezebel's and things like that so this quote needs to take him back to the word foolish virgin are saved the Bible said anyone that takes the mark your name was never on that I'm sorry your name is blotted off the book of life that's in the book of Revelation so see maybe had a slip of the mind or the tongue but the word says she saved yeah that's the revelation that I've come to the bush virgin is eternally saved but not saved from the tribulation period stay on our feet here well Ram said there's a few foolish virgin saved there are three Church age book quotes about the foolish virgin and everyone she saved let's look at this one he said that's when the lukewarm Church and the five foolish virgins will appear he will separate the sheep from the goats now let's skip down he talks about his bride comes the minister to him look at the urgency it is now or never repent before it's too late wake up from amongst the dead and seek God to be filled with the spirit or you'll miss eternal life do it now while theirs what do it now well there's time let me close with one more more quote things that are to be 1965 [Music] and I just have it here let me type it in this is the beauty of free more agency okay programs talking about how the word was believed by Mary in her heart just heard us yesterday look at this we know Jesus has gone to prepare place to receive a people unto himself look how humble he is who those people are I hope it's we are part of those people tonight if it isn't my friend now I'm gonna inject something wrong here let's give up and not and not try to be bribed is that what he said sbobet I'm saying if you're not yet born again God has made a way a condition that you can be included in that sorry if you want to you're on free moral agency idea you can act the way you wish to but now notice in this world that is to come there is a world to come so what I want to say God will give you the desires of your heart what do you wish what are you wishing for right now God will give you whatever you wish for let me believe that Psalms 37:4 says delight yourself in the Lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart the reason the bride will go in the rapture is because she wants to Amen it's her choice Amen God's not gonna force anybody to go there the reason the foolish don't go because they didn't want to the beauty is God made away for everybody to come to the wedding supper Amen see we got to be careful not to go too far on predestination and election is if we major too much on that say we'll say look at your faults you might as well not even try you weren't ordained to the rapture that liar he's always telling lies and now make people give up I guess I'm not the bride and they'll get so discouraged but the reality is every Christians backslides even Holy Ghost fill Christians but the Holy Ghost filled Christian wish is to go in the rapture desires ago in the rapture so she'll devote all her time to making sure she's ready amen because God gave her that choice see how we got to be right down the middle it's your choice balance with God's foreknowledge but if you want to go you can go because Jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life beautiful isn't it musicians come oh yeah to me that's the beauty of that parable the lies prepared devote an extra time but the foolish didn't praise the Lord Lydia stop the life here I mean I'm just gonna announce a few things now yeah the Lord bless all the lies dreamers loving the Lord
