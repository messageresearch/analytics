[0:02] thank you brother austin i appreciate
[0:04] you uh sharing that acts 5 verse 18.
[0:10] i was telling my wife that testimony you
[0:11] know brother austin told me about it the
[0:13] other night or monday rather i was
[0:14] telling my wife i thought what a good
[0:16] example of
[0:17] he just heard the word preached on
[0:19] sunday and then he went home and acted
[0:21] on it
[0:22] and i was like that's what we all need
[0:24] to do that's what i need to do more
[0:26] there's such a beautiful brother
[0:27] childlike faith
[0:30] just thanking god that i can suffer
[0:33] like paul like we said on sunday paul
[0:34] had his portion to suffer with christ
[0:36] he counted his sufferings a a blessing
[0:40] and then in the moment where he's
[0:41] thanking god i get to suffer
[0:43] god heals him right in that moment
[0:45] it's just amazing thank god for his
[0:47] grace
[0:48] hallelujah
[0:50] acts 5 19.
[1:00] acts chapter 5 verse 19.
[1:15] i will be mindful the time tonight i
[1:16] think i was mindful last wednesday i
[1:18] think i did
[1:19] i think i might have surprised everybody
[1:20] but uh
[1:22] just tried to be really cautious the
[1:24] time so lord willing we'll try to do
[1:26] that again tonight
[1:27] acts 5 verse 19.
[1:43] now just as some background
[1:46] this is i believe the second time
[1:50] or perhaps the third time i have to look
[1:51] it up but this was either the second or
[1:53] third time the apostles had been
[1:54] arrested after the day of pentecost
[2:00] and i believe the first time they were
[2:02] just beaten and let go
[2:05] but nobody the first time they were just
[2:06] questioned in chapter
[2:10] four
[2:15] yes and then they were beaten
[2:19] if i'm not
[2:20] mistaken in here in chapter 5 a
[2:23] phenomenon i'm not mistaken
[2:26] will they get arrested again
[2:30] and let's look at verse 19.
[2:33] and again i'd like to look at tonight
[2:35] the power of the apostles doctrine
[2:37] so just standing with jesus's teachings
[2:40] is so important
[2:42] as we said because if you align with the
[2:43] doctrine if you align with the teaching
[2:45] god's power will flow through you
[2:48] in other words if you obey god's word
[2:49] his power flows through you like we saw
[2:51] with you brother with that testimony
[2:54] acts 5 verse 19.
[2:58] uh let's read 19 and 20 together and
[3:00] then i'll read 21
[3:02] myself because it's a little bit longer
[3:05] verse 19 let's begin on three one two
[3:07] three but the angel of the lord by night
[3:10] opened the prison doors and brought them
[3:13] forth and said go stand and speak in the
[3:17] temple
[3:18] to the people
[3:19] all the words of this life
[3:22] they're in prison it's a second or third
[3:24] time
[3:25] and this time the angel comes
[3:28] opens the door and says i'm setting you
[3:30] free to do what to go preach to the
[3:33] people the word of god
[3:36] look at verse 21 i'll read that and when
[3:38] they had heard that they entered in the
[3:39] temple early in the morning and they did
[3:41] they did what they taught
[3:44] but the high priest came and they that
[3:46] were with him and called this council
[3:47] together in all the senate of the
[3:48] children
[3:49] of israel and sent to the prison to have
[3:52] them brought
[3:55] i'm sorry this is the second persecution
[3:57] yes i'm sorry so they're beaten after
[3:59] this yeah they're beaten after this at
[4:01] the end of the chapter so forgive me the
[4:04] first time they're arrested i think they
[4:05] just stayed a night in prison this time
[4:07] though they're beaten
[4:10] so let's have a word of prayer if we
[4:12] can't hear tonight by god's grace
[4:13] heavenly father lord we we've read your
[4:15] word thank you for this beautiful
[4:16] testimony god of childlike faith lord of
[4:18] the power of god flowing through our
[4:20] brother's life we give you thanks and
[4:21] praise for that thank you for healing
[4:23] him lord god we know you're the
[4:24] ever-present help in time of trouble we
[4:26] know you're here to meet every need lord
[4:28] god and if we'll just lord receive each
[4:30] word with faith and believe the word of
[4:31] god we know all things are possible to
[4:33] them that believe we've made many
[4:35] requests known unto you tonight lord god
[4:37] and we know you heard those prayers
[4:39] encourage us strengthen us here tonight
[4:40] lord and may we receive our portion
[4:43] of the word of god lord may those that
[4:45] need milk may they get the milk may
[4:47] those that need meat may they get the
[4:48] meat of the word of god because lord we
[4:50] need your grace we need your strength so
[4:52] father let your holy spirit minister now
[4:54] to each and every need help me to get
[4:55] out of your way and lord may jesus
[4:57] christ be magnified here tonight and
[4:59] it's in his holy name we pray and the
[5:01] church said
[5:02] amen god bless you as you're being
[5:04] seated praise god
[5:08] okay so we'll like to look here tonight
[5:10] i just want to look at
[5:12] uh the subject of doctrine again but i
[5:14] want to look at the power of the
[5:15] apostles doctrine
[5:18] so we saw
[5:19] the last three services about the power
[5:22] of jesus's doctrine
[5:24] and
[5:25] tonight lord willing we'll look at the
[5:27] apostles doctrine so have your bible
[5:28] there in acts chapter
[5:31] 2. let's go we're in five but let's go
[5:32] back to acts chapter 2.
[5:38] now we know in verse 4 the baptism of
[5:40] the holy ghost fell on believer souls
[5:42] for the first time and the bible said
[5:44] they went around declaring the wonderful
[5:46] works of the lord
[5:47] so when you're born again church you
[5:49] will praise the lord you will praise the
[5:52] lord or you'll tell somebody about god's
[5:53] wonderful works when you're born again
[5:55] you'll be unashamed to do it praise god
[5:58] because that's what happened on the day
[5:59] of pentecost we know in other times they
[6:01] spoke in tongues other times they
[6:04] prophesied other times they magnified
[6:07] god they just glorified god when you're
[6:09] born again something uh will happen to
[6:12] you and you will glorify the lord in a
[6:14] strong bold liberating spiritual manner
[6:17] praise god the world will look at you
[6:19] and say jesse's drunk or they look at
[6:21] you say austin's drunk the world will
[6:23] look at us and say we're drunk
[6:25] but we're what we're what's happened is
[6:27] that we're taking full control by the
[6:29] holy ghost praise god god has full
[6:31] control in our lives amen at that moment
[6:33] and then we're going to battle of course
[6:35] the rest of our lives how many how many
[6:36] battle in the rest of your life to stay
[6:37] drunk on the holy spirit praise god
[6:39] in your mind now in your mind because in
[6:41] your soul it's always there god's seal
[6:42] there but to keep your mind transformed
[6:45] by the word of the lord that's a great
[6:46] battle great struggle but that's the
[6:48] great battle we're fighting amen that's
[6:50] what we're earnestly contending for the
[6:52] faith that was once delivered to the
[6:53] saints praise god
[6:55] and lord willing out there in this
[6:56] message i'll get to just a few simple
[6:58] examples some of you might be familiar
[6:59] with some of these but
[7:00] uh battles that you know sometimes our
[7:02] church our battles will take years to
[7:04] overcome and if you've been serving the
[7:05] lord long enough you know what i'm
[7:06] talking about
[7:08] you may struggle with something for more
[7:09] than a week you might struggle with
[7:10] something for more than a month you
[7:12] might struggle with something for more
[7:14] than six months
[7:15] it might be a year it might be two years
[7:17] it might be three years it might be a
[7:19] decade
[7:20] but if you keep trusting god if you keep
[7:22] serving god god is going to bring the
[7:24] victory to you praise god unless that
[7:27] unless some something is you know laid
[7:28] there to keep you humble or something
[7:30] if it's not for that purpose god is
[7:32] doing it to allow you to learn how to
[7:35] obey learn how to trust learn how to
[7:37] lean upon his everlasting arms and learn
[7:40] to know that god has a season for
[7:41] everything
[7:42] just like a natural season this is a
[7:44] season for salt right as you see the
[7:46] salt on the roads it's a season for
[7:48] snowball fights that's what the season's
[7:50] for you know hot chocolate that's what
[7:52] the season's for
[7:53] but there's a time and season for
[7:55] everything god works the same way
[7:57] there's a time and season of your life
[7:58] for everything praise god
[8:00] like i look at some of the sermons i
[8:02] preached down there's no way i could
[8:03] have preached them 10 years ago there's
[8:04] no way because i hadn't experienced some
[8:06] of these things or i hadn't gone through
[8:08] them i hadn't read that in the bible or
[8:10] the holy spirit hadn't revealed that to
[8:11] me like that
[8:13] and so
[8:15] we we trust god that his time is the
[8:17] right time amen and he's going to make
[8:19] everything beautiful in his own time now
[8:21] you can switch over here honey i do have
[8:22] just a few slides here to show
[8:26] now in acts chapter 2 verse 4 they get
[8:28] the holy ghost
[8:30] and then
[8:31] the god starts blessing them by winning
[8:33] new souls
[8:35] and in verse 42
[8:37] uh
[8:41] the bible says this
[8:44] and they continued steadfastly in the
[8:45] apostles doctrine and fellowship and in
[8:48] breaking of bread and in prayers
[8:52] okay and fear came upon every soul and
[8:54] many wonders and signs were done by the
[8:57] apostles
[9:00] and all that believed were together and
[9:02] had all things in common if that's the
[9:04] way the church started how many know
[9:06] that's the way the church is going to
[9:07] finish
[9:09] right because god is alpha and omega
[9:11] that means the first letter of the
[9:12] alphabet the last letter god through all
[9:14] of it praise god
[9:15] and the bible does talk about god
[9:17] restoring at the end time god will
[9:19] restore all things praise god at the end
[9:22] time through the spirit of elijah which
[9:23] is
[9:24] brother brahm's message right and that
[9:25] points us back where to the bible amen
[9:29] and so if if that if this is how they
[9:31] acted when they first got born again
[9:33] that's the way we should act today so
[9:36] anyone that's baptized like our fresh
[9:38] baptisms here you know austin alina
[9:40] we should see them do this which they're
[9:42] doing
[9:43] they're continuing steadfastly in my
[9:45] teaching from the bible right
[9:47] and also our fellowship that's why it's
[9:49] important that we fellowship on sundays
[9:51] and go to church you know go out to eat
[9:52] together and you know meet up when we
[9:54] can on wednesday night we'll fellowship
[9:55] after church here just maybe for a few
[9:56] minutes
[9:58] you must do that you must continue in
[10:01] the doctrine the teaching
[10:03] and the fellowship and we have all
[10:05] things in common
[10:06] hopefully most of us are debt-free now
[10:08] by god's grace
[10:10] right except for our mortgages or
[10:11] something like that you know
[10:13] it's gonna be a while for me to get debt
[10:14] free from that unless god sends a
[10:15] miracle
[10:17] but see we got all things in common
[10:18] right
[10:19] working on a car or working on that by
[10:21] god's grace god's working on that
[10:23] it be the right time
[10:25] god's working on these things
[10:27] it makes all thing in common right and
[10:29] breaking a bread washing feet prayers
[10:32] communion
[10:33] we have all these things in common so i
[10:35] can clearly see how our church just
[10:37] looks like that church
[10:39] amen
[10:40] now the amount of miracles that's
[10:41] different depending on the number of
[10:42] people and also the gifts that are in
[10:44] the church
[10:46] we clearly see that there's gifts of
[10:48] healing in the church because people
[10:49] have been healed in the church
[10:51] there's gifts of deliverance in the
[10:53] church because we've been delivered a
[10:54] mind battle some of us have been
[10:55] delivered from mind battles praise god
[10:58] there's all these wonderful gifts in the
[10:59] church praise god
[11:01] that god wants to use that has been
[11:03] there's been wisdom given to us there's
[11:05] been knowledge given to us praise god
[11:07] we've heard a tongue right hallelujah
[11:09] we've heard interpretations about 11
[11:10] years ago we've heard them so when god
[11:12] wants to send them we want to be able to
[11:14] receive them praise god
[11:16] and that if we want more we should pray
[11:18] for more
[11:19] and then we should live like we want
[11:20] more praise god
[11:22] live close to god
[11:24] see
[11:25] now i do want to say this i do believe
[11:27] there's miracles that apostles
[11:29] that they will do that will be greater
[11:31] than all the other miracles
[11:34] because there's something that if the
[11:35] apostle has the highest calling in the
[11:37] bible they would have to have some type
[11:39] of higher gift
[11:40] some type of higher ability and you find
[11:43] that's the case
[11:45] who had who had greater gifts than and
[11:47] miracles than peter and paul
[11:49] right who we can't find anybody outside
[11:51] of christ that had greater miracles than
[11:53] that peter would walk by and his shadow
[11:56] would you know god would use his shadow
[11:58] to bring healing to people
[12:00] who's ever heard of that you know in our
[12:01] day
[12:02] one time i heard perry green say that
[12:04] that they would do that in india
[12:06] we would go there to india i think even
[12:08] south south america or some sort south
[12:10] africa they would have prayer lines and
[12:12] they would just want his shadow to
[12:14] strike them and he said some of the
[12:16] people got healed when i listened to his
[12:17] testimony
[12:18] because there was such faith so see
[12:20] and what he knew he went to many places
[12:22] to start churches amen i believe he did
[12:24] do some work of an apostle
[12:26] to start some churches
[12:28] but these men that god commissions to go
[12:30] into a darkness you know where they've
[12:32] never heard the gospel of christ god
[12:34] gives them power god gives them
[12:36] anointing god gives them doctrine god
[12:39] gives them signs miracles and wonders to
[12:41] prove that jesus is raised from the dead
[12:44] not just talk about it but prove it
[12:48] my good friend maxwell lee it's been a
[12:50] year since he preached for us i think it
[12:51] was 2013 or 2014. he's a missionary and
[12:54] a pastor he says he's walked into houses
[12:56] before in south south america and bodies
[12:59] were levitating off the ground in
[13:01] satanic worship and he said i rebuke in
[13:03] the spirit of jesus christ and the
[13:04] bodies would fall down to the ground
[13:07] he said he was walking he was leaving
[13:08] that house and he said a demon-possessed
[13:11] person came running at him and he just
[13:13] kept walking and the holy spirit threw
[13:15] that person up against the wall and he
[13:16] just walked right and left the house
[13:18] that's his own testimony and this man is
[13:20] like five two
[13:22] now he looks strong but he's no great
[13:24] man and he said before he was leaving
[13:26] there was one more person that was
[13:27] coming to get him and the man fell
[13:29] directly at his feet and just like with
[13:31] brother ram fell directly at his feet
[13:32] and the man couldn't even move
[13:34] a demon-possessed man that was going to
[13:35] hurt him
[13:36] so that he's an apostle he goes places
[13:39] other people don't go
[13:41] i just think that's an important thought
[13:43] that we need to remember that that we if
[13:45] we have a calling in life we must be
[13:47] obedient and also if god's given you
[13:49] calling he's going to give you the power
[13:51] to back it up
[13:52] amen praise god if god's called you to a
[13:55] ministry he's going to give you the
[13:56] strength to do it praise god and god
[13:59] will not fail praise god
[14:01] it's impossible
[14:03] so they were baptized with the holy
[14:05] ghost
[14:06] instantly they said let's fellowship
[14:08] let's learn the word of god
[14:10] let's have all things in common these
[14:12] were the group this was the three
[14:14] thousand group that were just baptized
[14:16] okay
[14:18] now
[14:18] we read acts 5 be for our text rather
[14:22] and the angel said go stand and speak in
[14:24] the temple all the words of this life
[14:26] they went and taught
[14:28] and then they got arrested
[14:30] they said don't teach in jesus name in
[14:32] verse 29 but peter said we ought to obey
[14:35] god rather than man amen praise god
[14:38] always obey god amen no matter what man
[14:40] says don't listen to man if they're
[14:42] speaking against god's word
[14:44] go with god's word obey god's word and
[14:46] god will back you up
[14:48] that's right
[14:51] it's such a beautiful
[14:52] story
[14:55] now earlier actually in chapter 4 verse
[14:57] 20 peter said we cannot but speak the
[15:00] things which we have seen and heard
[15:02] and that should be our testimony as well
[15:04] we should talk about jesus and the
[15:06] things we've seen jesus do and the
[15:08] things we've heard jesus do
[15:11] tell others what you've seen jesus do
[15:14] testify to others about how god has done
[15:16] miracles for you how he showed up for
[15:18] you when he didn't have food or you
[15:20] didn't have money and god showed up and
[15:22] did something for you
[15:23] amen
[15:24] the angel thought teaching the people
[15:26] was so important that he broke them out
[15:29] of jail amen
[15:30] the angel of the lord praise god
[15:33] and that's because jesus said go and
[15:35] teach
[15:36] all nations baptizing them in the name
[15:38] of the father son holy ghost which is
[15:40] the lord jesus christ
[15:42] so look they were trying to lock them up
[15:43] the evil men were trying to lock them up
[15:45] and because jesus said go teach the
[15:47] angel broke them out and said go teach
[15:50] the angel was just repeating what jesus
[15:52] said amen every true messenger from an
[15:54] angel every messenger that's really a
[15:56] messenger really an angel will will line
[15:59] up with what jesus christ said amen
[16:02] that's what jesus said the holy ghost
[16:03] will do
[16:04] he'll bring you in remembrance of my
[16:06] words and he'll teach you what to say in
[16:08] that hour praise god
[16:11] let's learn what to say in this hour
[16:13] this is important hour for you brother
[16:14] austin and lena says selena so let's
[16:16] learn let's learn now what the holy
[16:18] spirit wants you to say on the next call
[16:20] amen
[16:24] follow the leading of the lord what does
[16:25] the lord leading you say if it's if it's
[16:27] if it's from the lord it'll be with the
[16:28] word of god
[16:30] so this is in the in the battle of the
[16:32] hour this is the battle trial so this is
[16:34] the moment lord i'm here to listen i'm
[16:36] here to learn teach me what i must say
[16:39] because you don't want to speak the
[16:40] devil's language you don't want to speak
[16:41] death the bible said life is in the
[16:43] power of the tongue as well amen
[16:46] speak life amen
[16:48] like when uh bang's dad had that stroke
[16:51] the his church came in to pray for them
[16:53] and to die but we came in to pray to
[16:56] live amen
[16:57] that we are speaking the words of this
[16:59] life and that was my whole revelation
[17:01] the whole time was
[17:02] life and death is in the power of the
[17:04] tongue so speak life it's going to be
[17:06] all right amen hallelujah jesus christ
[17:08] is going to show up he's going to make a
[17:10] way he's our waymaker our miracle worker
[17:13] our promise keeper amen
[17:15] he's the light of the darkness amen
[17:18] speak god's word speak life
[17:21] because the angel thought so much about
[17:23] their doctrine i'm breaking them out of
[17:25] prison so other people can be taught the
[17:27] gospel of jesus christ amen
[17:31] hallelujah the bible said they filled
[17:33] there go down to verse 28 acts 5 28
[17:38] why were they so upset
[17:41] these pharisees were so upset because
[17:42] the apostles were doing miracles in the
[17:44] name of jesus and also they were
[17:46] teaching in the name of jesus
[17:50] verse 28 saying did we not straightly
[17:52] command you that you should not teach in
[17:54] this name and behold you filled
[17:55] jerusalem with your doctrine
[17:59] see and intend to bring this man's blood
[18:01] upon us
[18:03] what were they filling it with doctrine
[18:05] did they have the holy ghost yes or no
[18:07] church
[18:08] yes
[18:09] so you mean a holy ghost-filled man will
[18:10] have miracles and teach doctrine that's
[18:12] exactly what the apostles had amen
[18:15] hallelujah
[18:17] but today there's a move even amongst
[18:19] message people and especially the
[18:20] charismatics it's all about power god
[18:22] will sort out our doctrines when we get
[18:24] to heaven that's a lie
[18:26] the real apostles have doctrine and they
[18:28] have the word of god as well
[18:31] so do real pastors too and real
[18:32] evangelists amen and real teachers and
[18:35] all the fivefold ministry praise god all
[18:37] prophets minor prophets of course
[18:40] see so that means church the apostles
[18:44] were just teaching and then these signs
[18:46] followed them
[18:48] because jesus said these signs follow
[18:50] them that believe amen
[18:52] when you're a believer the signs just
[18:53] follow you
[18:55] see so they'd go teach they'd pray for
[18:57] the sick god would heal god do something
[18:58] great they would just constantly teach
[19:00] constantly talk about jesus teach others
[19:02] about christ and then when the need came
[19:05] up they'd pray or they they speak the
[19:07] word of god and god would do miracles
[19:08] amen it's that simple
[19:11] go fill
[19:13] jerusalem with the doctrine don't feel
[19:15] akron with the word of god amen
[19:18] hallelujah
[19:20] the angel of the lord commanded them to
[19:22] teach god's doctrine
[19:24] so the angel lord would do the same
[19:26] thing today tell us to teach doctrine
[19:28] now go to acts 13 verse 11 and 12.
[19:39] the power of the apostles doctrine
[19:42] it was so powerful the angels broke them
[19:44] out of jail to go teach the people the
[19:46] doctrine and they filled the whole city
[19:48] with it
[19:51] i'm getting ready to go do another run
[19:52] on the of those postcards one of those
[19:54] postcards from 2018 we sent out 2 500
[19:56] postcards brother and guess how many
[19:58] people come to church too
[20:01] hey but i'm glad they got to hear the
[20:02] word of god amen
[20:04] because what if that was me i'd want a
[20:06] chance to hear the word of god too
[20:08] and the thing was one of them knew about
[20:10] brother brandon but just never come back
[20:12] we think she had some type of mental
[20:13] trouble but i offered brother i
[20:15] basically begged her to come back to
[20:17] church i begged both of them to come
[20:18] back to church but you know if the holy
[20:20] spirit's in your heart no one's got to
[20:22] beg you to come to church
[20:24] hallelujah but i wanted to know that we
[20:26] loved her and we wanted to see her again
[20:28] both of them
[20:29] so i'm getting ready to do that again i
[20:31] believe akron deserves a chance to hear
[20:32] the gospel hey maybe we'll put your
[20:34] testimony on there buddy
[20:35] we'll put that testament on the back of
[20:36] that card jesus christ the same
[20:38] yesterday today and forever
[20:41] let's let's pray about that praise god
[20:43] acts 13 11 and 12. now in this case
[20:45] brother and sisters
[20:47] uh there's a deputy and paul's trying to
[20:49] witness to him but an evil sorcerer
[20:52] tries to stop him from hearing paul's
[20:53] preaching
[20:54] right
[20:56] so someone's the devil's trying to stop
[20:58] somebody from hearing the word of god
[21:00] and look at verse 11.
[21:03] and now behold
[21:08] actually let's read verse 10
[21:09] and
[21:10] verse 9 sorry then saul who was also
[21:12] called paul filled with the holy ghost
[21:13] set his eyes on him and said o full of
[21:15] all subtility and all mischief thou
[21:16] child of the devil thou enemy of all
[21:18] righteousness wilt thou not cease to
[21:20] pervert the right ways of the lord and
[21:22] now behold the hand the lord is upon me
[21:23] and thou shalt be blind not seeing the
[21:25] son for a season and immediately
[21:26] therefore him a miss and a darkness and
[21:29] he went about seeking some to lead him
[21:31] by the hand so paul called down darkness
[21:33] on this man and he couldn't see for a
[21:35] little season
[21:36] and look what the deputy says in verse
[21:38] 12 then the deputy when he saw what was
[21:40] done believed being astonished at the
[21:42] doctrine of the lord these are major
[21:45] miracles signs and wonders right only
[21:47] we've only seen apostles do these things
[21:50] right i've never met anybody that's
[21:51] called down blindness on anybody have
[21:52] you sister beatrice have you heard
[21:54] anybody call blindness on anybody in
[21:56] ghana have you ever heard that yeah i
[21:58] haven't either i'm just curious you know
[22:00] because that's a different part of the
[22:01] world you know
[22:03] think about that the power what what
[22:05] would you have you have to see visions
[22:06] or something oh god's going to bring
[22:08] down a veil of darkness a mess of
[22:10] darkness on this sinner this devil
[22:11] worshiper
[22:13] and he called it down and the deputies
[22:15] i'm astonished at this doctrine i'm
[22:17] astonishing this teaching
[22:18] the teaching is that god will fight for
[22:21] any soul who wants to hear the word of
[22:23] god amen that's the doctrine amen
[22:26] hallelujah in other words do anything do
[22:28] as much as you can to get the message to
[22:30] everyone you feel loved to give it to
[22:34] see because some people are just not
[22:35] going to receive it in fact most people
[22:37] are not going to receive the gospel
[22:40] so fight and pray with everything you've
[22:42] got to get the gospel to those that you
[22:43] think will hear it
[22:48] he was astonished at the doctrine
[22:50] and remember look at that church both
[22:52] jesus and the apostles had astonishing
[22:54] power
[22:55] and doctrine vindicated by supernatural
[22:57] power they said the same thing about
[22:58] jesus what is this new doctrine
[23:01] he casts out devils
[23:02] praise god
[23:04] same thing about paul he's calling down
[23:06] blindness he's casting out devils what
[23:08] kind of doctrine is this it's authority
[23:10] it's following the leading of the lord
[23:12] praise god
[23:14] i've only cast out one devil really here
[23:16] in america that i've seen face to face
[23:18] but i think we did six over five of them
[23:20] over there and uh
[23:21] guyana south america
[23:25] that's because in america most people
[23:26] first of all they're not humble enough
[23:28] to admit they got a devil
[23:29] or the devil keeps them from coming to
[23:31] church or they got a religious devil and
[23:32] they won't they won't confess
[23:35] because america is a backslidden nation
[23:38] but we know the one thing is true the
[23:40] blood of jesus christ will set the
[23:41] captive free if they want to be free
[23:44] they can be free praise god
[23:46] any person who wants to be free can be
[23:48] free
[23:49] that's the story that you remember the
[23:50] story of the maniac brother he was he
[23:52] lit there was a man in jesus day he was
[23:54] called the maniac of gattera and he
[23:56] lived he was a man he was totally naked
[23:57] demon-possessed and he lived among uh he
[24:00] lived among the tombs
[24:02] he slept in the graveyard in other words
[24:04] well jesus said i jesus got on a boat
[24:07] and he crossed the boat to go get to
[24:08] that man because brother branham and the
[24:10] bible says he had need to go to that man
[24:13] in other words jesus heard that man
[24:15] crying for deliverance even though he's
[24:17] demon-possessed jesus heard him crying
[24:20] over the space of that lake and so jesus
[24:22] traveled over there and the first thing
[24:23] the man did he run to him and worshiped
[24:26] him and then jesus rebuked those demons
[24:28] and the demons left and they went in the
[24:29] pigs and the pigs run off into the water
[24:31] but the idea is if someone wants to be
[24:33] delivered god will cross all heaven and
[24:36] earth to deliver them amen
[24:38] praise god amen jesus got on the boat
[24:40] and crossed the boat just to go pray the
[24:42] prayer of faith to deliver that man and
[24:44] the man was set free and the bible said
[24:46] as soon as he did that he got his
[24:47] clothes on and he sat at the feet of
[24:49] jesus and said can i follow you and
[24:50] jesus said no you need to stay here and
[24:52] preach
[24:53] amen jesus jesus forbid him to be a
[24:55] missionary that wasn't his calling
[24:57] i wonder if he was a pastor i wonder if
[25:00] he's an evangelist or a teacher or
[25:01] something like that or a prophet
[25:03] but jesus said no you can't can imagine
[25:04] you jesus delivers you and he says you
[25:06] can't come with him
[25:07] yet he invited the rich young ruler he
[25:09] said come follow me remember to tell the
[25:10] rich young come follow me but not the
[25:11] maniac
[25:13] interesting see god's got a different
[25:15] plan for every life may god just help us
[25:17] to see what's your plan for my life and
[25:19] help me to obey it amen
[25:21] hallelujah
[25:24] see it's not cocky or it's not it's not
[25:26] cookie cutter that's what i meant to say
[25:28] it's not a cookie cutter gospel like we
[25:29] saw with the
[25:30] joshua series every ministry is
[25:33] different in some ways
[25:34] they're not all exactly the same
[25:39] but god vindicates
[25:40] doctrine with power
[25:43] praise god
[25:46] now let's go to romans 6
[25:49] verse 16 and 17.
[25:52] so it's the next book
[25:53] this will all go in order tonight and
[25:55] i'll try to watch my i never set a timer
[25:57] so here let me set one
[26:00] okay
[26:01] okay thank you buddy i appreciate that
[26:04] good can you tell
[26:05] because of that okay because the live
[26:06] stream good good okay wonderful buddy
[26:08] thank you
[26:11] i do want to be cautious of the time
[26:12] austin i didn't get a lot of sleep and
[26:14] i don't want anybody to get caught in
[26:15] the any cold rain in case the weather
[26:17] changes
[26:18] romans 6 16.
[26:23] know you not that to whom you yield your
[26:25] servant your i'm sorry yourselves
[26:26] servants to obey
[26:29] his servants you are to whom you obey
[26:31] whether of sin unto death or of
[26:33] obedience unto righteousness
[26:35] well see that's what
[26:37] that's what every sinner does right they
[26:39] yield to the devils telling them oh just
[26:41] lie about this right
[26:43] they yield to it oh just steal this it's
[26:45] okay just steal this
[26:47] or just go on your phone on that
[26:48] pornography website just go on that
[26:51] right they yield to that and they listen
[26:53] to that rather than fighting that off
[26:55] but the bible says we have mighty
[26:57] weapons of warfare amen
[26:59] it's not like we don't have weapons to
[27:00] fight back we shouldn't be slaves to say
[27:03] we can't be pushovers with satan we got
[27:05] to fight back we've got the sword of the
[27:07] word
[27:08] but see that's why they get in bondage
[27:10] and get addicted to sin because they let
[27:12] the devil
[27:14] talk him into it
[27:16] but you and i are not that way how do we
[27:18] overcome by verse 17
[27:20] but god be thanked that ye were were the
[27:23] servants of sin but ye have what obeyed
[27:26] from the heart
[27:28] that form of doctrine which was
[27:30] delivered to you
[27:33] hallelujah
[27:34] brother jesse how did you get free from
[27:36] all those addictions everything i obeyed
[27:38] the doctrine from my heart amen i opened
[27:41] up my heart and said jesus i'll do
[27:43] anything you tell me you've forgiven me
[27:45] just tell me what to do and i'll do it
[27:47] praise god
[27:48] i became a servant of righteousness
[27:50] instead of a servant of sin
[27:53] whoever you yield to that's your boss
[27:56] right that's your master that's your god
[27:58] right man like the bible said false
[27:59] preachers their god is their belly right
[28:02] that's really their god but satan must
[28:03] be behind that somehow they're
[28:05] worshipping themselves
[28:09] see it's yielding from your heart so
[28:12] first you got to have the right heart
[28:14] you got to love god you got to trust god
[28:16] and know that he's faithful and then if
[28:18] you love god you'll obey the doctrine
[28:20] you obey the teaching from the heart and
[28:22] you'll be a servant to christ instead of
[28:24] a servant of the devil thank god we're
[28:26] servants of christ here amen
[28:28] hallelujah
[28:31] but you got obey from the heart
[28:32] that's why a lot of message people they
[28:34] don't they don't get the holy ghost
[28:35] because they start obeying by legalism
[28:38] or they start obeying by well my i just
[28:41] got to work at it till i get it instead
[28:43] of love
[28:45] right
[28:46] love well i love the lord so much that
[28:48] lord you're gonna help me to overcome
[28:50] this help me surrender this because i
[28:52] love you that's the way to grow in god
[28:54] amen
[28:55] now well i'm gonna do this just so
[28:56] people don't think i'm backslidden
[28:57] people don't think i'm worldly
[28:59] that's not why you do it that becomes
[29:01] legalistic that person will not enter
[29:03] the kingdom of god amen
[29:05] you got to do it because it's from the
[29:06] heart it's because you love god you
[29:08] appreciate god you thank him for the
[29:10] cross amen everything about jesus you
[29:13] love amen
[29:15] and you become a servant to jesus
[29:18] all right uh romans 16 17.
[29:22] go chapter 16 verse 17.
[29:34] now hear what paul says you should do to
[29:36] false teachers
[29:38] so preachers that preach false doctrine
[29:40] here's what we need to do
[29:45] 16 and 17.
[29:48] maybe i'll get some readers back there
[29:49] hey how about it lydia and uh where's
[29:51] haven is having back there oh she's in
[29:53] there okay malachi and lydia yeah
[29:55] maybe austin and lena maybe
[29:58] all right romans 16 17. you want to read
[30:00] that sisterlina roman 16 17.
[30:10] salute one another with the holy kiss
[30:12] the churches of christ with you now i
[30:15] beseech you brethren mark them which
[30:18] cause the vision of offensive contract
[30:27] amen
[30:29] yeah praise god verse 18
[30:31] for they are such serve not our lord
[30:34] jesus christ now church can the bible be
[30:36] any any clear
[30:38] anyone who preaches a false doctrine
[30:40] which people are saying dr no matter
[30:42] even in the message
[30:45] paul says avoid them
[30:47] and mark them that cause divisions by
[30:50] their false doctrine because they don't
[30:52] serve christ
[30:53] they serve the devil of food or whatever
[30:55] they serve the devil of self-love right
[30:57] they're worshiping themselves
[30:59] so false doctrine is a true sign they're
[31:02] not a real believer
[31:04] that's the real sign
[31:06] but see people they say well as long as
[31:07] they're in miracles they might be off on
[31:09] a few teaching things that's okay no
[31:11] they need to be right on the teaching
[31:13] and they need to have miracles amen you
[31:15] gotta have both praise god
[31:20] so it's the authority of the word of god
[31:22] that we stand on when we when we preach
[31:24] on doctrine because there's power in
[31:26] doctrine
[31:27] there there's power if you obey if they
[31:29] obey the doctrine they wouldn't worship
[31:31] their belly they'd worship the god that
[31:33] made their belly amen
[31:35] they would trust god who made them to
[31:37] provide for their stomach rather than
[31:39] worshiping their own their selves or
[31:41] their own situation being selfish or
[31:43] however you can interpret this of their
[31:45] god being their belly
[31:48] by good words and fair speeches deceive
[31:51] the hearts of the simple
[31:54] see it's always with their slick words
[31:57] that's how they deceive people but
[31:59] really they're after your money that's
[32:01] what these false preachers are after
[32:02] they preach false doctrine so they can
[32:04] get after your money like you see all
[32:06] the ones on tv
[32:07] or they got infomercials on their
[32:09] youtube channel they'll have a little
[32:11] segment that's kind of about the bible
[32:13] and they'll say
[32:14] now here's three dvds and you can order
[32:16] it for a small donation of 79.99
[32:19] they're after i mean those dvds they
[32:21] cost 50 cents to make think of all the
[32:23] money they're making they're trying to
[32:25] fill their bank accounts rather than
[32:27] trying to get filled with the holy ghost
[32:30] amen
[32:31] they're serving their own buildings amen
[32:34] and they're teaching false doctrine to
[32:36] begin with
[32:39] see so how do you treat them sister lena
[32:41] read it in verse 17
[32:43] mark them i'm sorry avoid yes mark them
[32:46] and avoid them
[32:50] that's fine
[32:53] that's fine if people want to avoid you
[32:55] that's fine too but listen you got a
[32:56] right to avoid them as well
[32:59] people don't like us because maybe of
[33:00] our stand on the gospel or stand on the
[33:02] truth
[33:03] they might avoid us but guess what i'm
[33:05] going to avoid them too
[33:06] because they're preaching false doctrine
[33:08] and all my doctrines backed up right
[33:10] here by the bible praise god and i can
[33:11] prove it to you i got all the videos i
[33:13] got the books i got everything to prove
[33:14] it's the bible praise god it's god's
[33:17] word that we're standing on amen it's
[33:19] god's truth amen and god's truth keeps
[33:21] marching on amen
[33:23] hallelujah
[33:26] like brother man i said if a man loved
[33:27] you he come corrected well where's all
[33:28] the people that love me see the emotion
[33:30] if i'm wrong somebody come correct me
[33:32] but see they don't come because they
[33:34] don't love me because i'm right
[33:37] i thought they didn't brother branham
[33:38] too they couldn't correct him either
[33:40] amen
[33:41] see that
[33:43] they're afraid
[33:46] like i said they got spies watching us
[33:47] or something like that why aren't the
[33:48] spies come talk to me like a man
[33:51] man to man or even woman to man my wife
[33:53] will sit there with you if a sis for
[33:55] somebody's watching a woman's spy come
[33:56] talk to me about it
[33:59] because we know what the holy spirit has
[34:01] revealed we know what the bible says
[34:03] it's not our word it's god's word amen
[34:06] hallelujah well i'm starting to get
[34:09] zealous here by god's grace but see we
[34:11] we know the false doctrines
[34:13] uh uh are are from false teachers who
[34:16] worship themselves
[34:22] all right hopefully everybody can see
[34:24] that by god's grace now i want you to
[34:26] notice now now this is a whole different
[34:28] thought here now go to the next book
[34:29] first corinthians 14 6
[34:31] first corinthians 14 6. and lydia why
[34:33] don't you read that first corinthians 14
[34:35] 6.
[34:36] now this is kind of off the false
[34:38] teachers for a moment because i'm just
[34:39] going in order to make it simple on you
[34:41] for reading your bible me too
[34:43] lydia go ahead first corinthians 14 6.
[34:55] amen never to catch yet
[34:57] the early church had lots of this i'm
[34:59] sorry this church the corinthian church
[35:00] had a lot of gift of tongues but did you
[35:02] see what the tongues give
[35:05] a tongue could come and give us any of
[35:07] these everybody say revelation can you
[35:08] say that revelation that's what serpents
[35:10] see this serpent seed is not a doctrine
[35:12] it's not a it's not a how-to
[35:14] right it's a revelation
[35:17] right the godhead is not a how-to it's a
[35:20] revelation
[35:22] right
[35:23] like jesus said about the the doctrine
[35:26] he talked about all the doctrines
[35:27] remember we went through that last week
[35:28] last wednesday night went through all
[35:29] jesus doctrines there with marriage and
[35:32] anger and all these things how to
[35:33] control your anger how to overcome
[35:35] lustful thoughts all that remember how
[35:37] to be blessed the beatitudes
[35:40] but the holy spirit can give a
[35:42] revelation everybody's saying knowledge
[35:43] ready knowledge everybody say
[35:45] prophesying ready prophesying and last
[35:47] one everybody say doctrine doctrine so a
[35:49] tongue could give any of those
[35:52] so see we have to hunger and thirst for
[35:54] the gifts to move right
[35:56] and then a gift a tongue would give us a
[35:58] doctrine can you imagine a tongue could
[36:00] come and say this is how to do this this
[36:02] is how you should fast or pray this is
[36:04] how you should
[36:08] know this situation this is how you
[36:10] should overcome your depression you know
[36:11] you'll give a doctrine on how to do it
[36:14] okay teach you something that you didn't
[36:17] know before it could also give you a
[36:18] revelation
[36:20] right see the holy spirit wants to give
[36:22] all these prophet signs revelations
[36:24] doctrines knowledge he wants to give all
[36:27] these things to us and but we've got to
[36:28] be hungry for them and we've got to be
[36:30] open to receiving them
[36:32] all right now go to verse 26 in the same
[36:35] chapter paul compliments them and
[36:37] brother branham does compliment them
[36:39] also the corinthian church in the church
[36:41] age book
[36:42] and brother brahm said it was good every
[36:43] one of them
[36:45] had these different
[36:47] uh revelations and tongues and
[36:49] interpretations so malachi can you read
[36:50] that first corinthians 14 26 please
[37:05] amen
[37:06] edify means building up
[37:08] so whatever you bring to church no he
[37:10] says when you all come together when
[37:11] everybody comes to church he said
[37:13] everyone in this church has a psalm
[37:15] everybody has a song to sing
[37:16] right every now and then we'll get a
[37:18] song special we appreciate that
[37:19] i appreciate brother amen bringing songs
[37:21] every week right
[37:22] i brought three songs a night or four
[37:24] songs and i just wrote my heart
[37:25] everybody has a psalm
[37:28] everybody has a doctrine see you can god
[37:30] can reveal a doctrine to you and you can
[37:31] bring it to church
[37:34] hallelujah
[37:36] the next one a tongue
[37:38] a revelation and interpretations but all
[37:41] things are to build up the body of
[37:43] christ all things are to be done here
[37:45] tonight to make you stronger
[37:47] praise god every word every song
[37:50] everything we teach should make you
[37:51] stronger in the word of god if you'll
[37:53] believe it
[37:54] but there's that that's that big if
[37:55] right if we'll apply it to our lives if
[37:58] we'll look in the mirror and not forget
[37:59] what we were when we looked in the
[38:01] mirror
[38:02] right remember what we are as we leave
[38:03] the building tonight praise god remember
[38:05] that we're christians we're servants of
[38:07] christ and we're learning from christ
[38:09] and we do what christ tells us to do
[38:12] amen
[38:13] now i did i read this one on sunday so
[38:15] i'm not going to go over this but
[38:16] remember all those out five outside the
[38:19] fivefold ministry are tossed like
[38:21] spiritual children
[38:23] and they're easily deceived
[38:26] easily deceived
[38:30] okay and i see i'll be getting on to
[38:32] that and more in the future i've been
[38:33] watching just recent you know church
[38:34] services from different places and
[38:36] people are just easily deceived they'll
[38:38] believe anything
[38:39] like one guy bless his heart my goodness
[38:41] i've texted him and talked to him a
[38:43] little bit uh
[38:46] he said the scripture uh
[38:48] before the mount transfiguration where
[38:50] uh the bible says some of you standing
[38:52] here will not taste death do you see the
[38:54] lord's coming remember that scripture
[38:56] that man actually interpreted that as
[38:58] saint john is still alive today
[39:00] can you believe that
[39:02] that would make him older than
[39:03] methuselah who was 900 what 79
[39:07] there's people that look they read the
[39:08] bible and they teach this false doctrine
[39:10] and they say the reason he's still alive
[39:12] is so he can come and teach us the book
[39:14] of revelation well too late we've
[39:16] already had elijah come and open the
[39:17] seals
[39:18] with thus saith the lord amen
[39:21] and he said he said john's hiding out in
[39:23] some cave in turkey for 2000 years
[39:26] well that means he hasn't gone to church
[39:28] so he's breaking the word there because
[39:29] the bible says gather more as you see
[39:30] that day approaching
[39:32] all right
[39:34] and jesus said jesus never said you need
[39:36] john to teach you he said when the
[39:38] comforter comes he'll show you all
[39:40] things amen it's the holy ghost
[39:43] this is a man even that says he believes
[39:45] in brother branham but he thinks we need
[39:46] john to come back and reveal the book of
[39:48] revelation well i'm sorry you haven't
[39:49] been listening to brother branham too
[39:50] much lately
[39:52] you missed the whole point of the seals
[39:54] were to break the seals off the book so
[39:56] now we can understand the symbols now we
[39:58] can understand the revelations and now
[40:00] we can be under the anointing praise god
[40:02] of the eagle at the end time so we can
[40:05] fly above the world we can watch and
[40:07] pray and be ready for the rapture with
[40:09] prophetic revelation
[40:11] amen
[40:16] all right go to first timothy chapter
[40:18] one
[40:20] now from what i've
[40:21] read
[40:23] and heard
[40:24] first timothy is paul's letter to
[40:26] timothy
[40:28] to help the church at ephesus
[40:30] which is really
[40:32] going to be very interesting lord
[40:33] willing if we ever preach this book on
[40:34] lord willing i may start colossians on
[40:37] sunday just because we'll have two
[40:38] services i may do colossians on sunday
[40:41] because i've been studying on that
[40:43] book
[40:44] but anyways remember remember what
[40:46] ephesus was about church remember that
[40:48] remember when paul left he said i'm
[40:49] leaving you he said i warned you for
[40:51] three years
[40:52] that wolves are going to enter in and
[40:54] not spare the flock well here paul names
[40:56] some of the wolves in the in the church
[40:58] of ephesus
[41:00] right it's just a beautiful mind you're
[41:01] putting those together it's beautiful
[41:03] now we see what paul was warning about
[41:05] they're going to preach that
[41:08] you
[41:09] can't eat me or your brothers you can't
[41:10] marry and all these lies from hell
[41:13] they're going to bring in all these lies
[41:14] and corrupt the church
[41:16] all right give me 10 minutes here that's
[41:18] what's happened 30 minutes maokai
[41:22] 40.
[41:23] okay well all right praise god
[41:25] all right so let's finish this page
[41:26] we'll finish this today page right guys
[41:29] so paul is writing this
[41:30] uh
[41:32] telling the young preacher timothy
[41:35] here's how you stand against liars that
[41:37] bring false doctrine
[41:40] first timothy 1 verse 3
[41:43] and i besought thee to abide still at
[41:45] ephesus when i went into macedonia that
[41:47] thou might has charged some that they
[41:49] teach what
[41:50] no
[41:51] other
[41:52] doctrine
[41:53] see why
[41:55] church can you can you understand this
[41:56] see why it's dangerous sometimes to say
[41:58] well i might not have the right doctrine
[42:00] but i got the right spirit can you see
[42:02] how that might be danger can anybody see
[42:03] how that might be dangerous
[42:06] that could also that can be taken the
[42:08] wrong way and say well i just don't want
[42:10] to study it i don't want to cause
[42:12] problems so i'm just going to act real
[42:13] loving what if paul would have done that
[42:15] with some of those liars in the church
[42:18] they would have kept spreading their
[42:19] false doctrine all over the church
[42:21] and the bible said it would have
[42:22] overthrown the faith of some can you
[42:25] imagine if i overthrow this i mean
[42:27] like last week i was getting into jesus
[42:28] whipping with the cords you know what if
[42:30] i overthrew this you know i'd throw it
[42:32] over and everything would fall on the
[42:34] floor paul said that's what happens when
[42:36] you have false teachers they overthrow
[42:38] your faith in other words you're not
[42:40] standing on faith anymore you've fallen
[42:42] from grace amen
[42:44] doctrine is so important paul said teach
[42:46] no other doctrine amen
[42:48] why because i got it from christ's amen
[42:50] and anything away from christ is
[42:52] antichrist
[42:55] and it's okay we don't have the same
[42:57] doctrine no it's not
[42:59] i mean it might be okay for you but i i
[43:01] believe i can have the right doctrine
[43:03] and the right spirit
[43:05] because that's what paul had
[43:07] and i got the same holy spirit paul had
[43:09] praise god because it directs me to the
[43:11] word
[43:15] here's what they were doing in verse
[43:16] four neither give heed to fables
[43:19] see just lies just conspiracy theories
[43:21] right fables
[43:22] cinderella stories
[43:24] right
[43:26] they gave heed to fables
[43:28] and endless genealogies
[43:31] right
[43:32] which minister questions rather than
[43:34] godly edifying which is in faith so do
[43:40] now uh
[43:43] i'm going to stop right there
[43:47] but this this no doctrine paul says no
[43:50] other doctrine it goes perfectly with
[43:52] galatians 1 which said if you change the
[43:54] gospel you're preaching another gospel
[43:56] it's another jesus and any man that
[43:58] changes is cursed
[44:01] see that
[44:02] to change one word to change one
[44:04] doctrine is to be cursed
[44:08] so church let's not take it lightly
[44:10] paul says teach no other doctrine
[44:13] he says to change anything you're cursed
[44:17] now what's interesting is i haven't
[44:18] heard any preacher lately
[44:21] preach out of first timothy chapter one
[44:24] you know why because that would make
[44:25] them change their doctrine and make them
[44:26] uncomfortable
[44:28] that make them have to say oh you know
[44:29] i'm sorry i said that about doctrine and
[44:30] doctrine not being important all those
[44:32] things
[44:33] they'd have to repent of that but you
[44:34] know what it takes you know you know
[44:36] what it takes to repent a lot of
[44:37] humility
[44:41] and that's what a lot of people don't
[44:42] have today because this is the day of
[44:43] pride
[44:44] i'm rich and increased with goods i got
[44:45] a big church i i don't have any nothing
[44:48] and the bible says you're blind
[44:50] miserable naked wretched and don't even
[44:52] know it
[44:54] now small church is going to have false
[44:55] doctrine too i'm just not not just
[44:58] because we're small or anything like
[44:58] that that god's helped us
[45:01] but it's the it's the attitude of the
[45:02] preacher it's the experience of the
[45:04] preacher has that preacher met the holy
[45:07] spirit praise god amen
[45:09] and if he has then jesus said the holy
[45:11] spirit will teach you all things amen
[45:14] and he will reveal she'll show you all
[45:16] truth praise god
[45:19] and isn't the bible truth
[45:21] isn't this true
[45:23] should we believe that
[45:24] it'll guide you into more truth it'll
[45:27] take you deeper in the word
[45:30] and you want to make a foolish statement
[45:32] like that where oh doctrine doesn't
[45:34] matter i just want the right spirit well
[45:35] if you had the holy spirit you'd have
[45:36] the right doctrine
[45:38] because the holy spirit wrote the
[45:39] doctrine amen hallelujah
[45:43] oh thank you jesus
[45:51] let's go to
[45:53] well
[45:54] yeah the bible says sound doctrine so
[45:56] let me find that scripture
[45:59] it's in first timothy chapter one
[46:03] actually let's read verse five because i
[46:04] want austin and elena see this too
[46:06] what is the
[46:08] purpose of commandments look at verse
[46:10] five now the end of the commandment or
[46:12] the purpose of the commandment is what
[46:14] so you obey the commandments so you'll
[46:15] have charity out of a pure heart
[46:19] so what's the purpose of all these
[46:20] doctrines and commands so you and i will
[46:22] have pure hearts and will be full of
[46:24] god's love
[46:25] that's what obeying the word of god does
[46:27] it makes us love each other more
[46:30] with pure hearts
[46:32] that means i won't just you know smile
[46:34] at beatrice but then sudden when i leave
[46:35] talk bad about her you know
[46:37] i just want to smile my kids while i'm
[46:39] here but then be angry and cuss at him
[46:41] at home
[46:42] some wicked stuff like that
[46:44] but no i'm i'm loving at church and i'm
[46:46] loving at home too hey man now i'm
[46:48] definitely more tired at home
[46:50] always a lot more energetic behind the
[46:52] pulpit just just just my children can
[46:54] tell you
[46:55] but i try to be loving and if i make a
[46:57] mistake i try to say sorry
[46:58] this is the whole point of a commandment
[47:00] so you'll have a pure heart and you'll
[47:02] have your heart full of love amen
[47:06] and a good conscience and a faith
[47:07] unfaint so real faith real faith
[47:11] when you love god you have a pure heart
[47:13] and you have real faith i don't know how
[47:15] god's gonna answer but god's gonna
[47:16] answer amen
[47:18] i know it
[47:19] because he's faithful and i'll say it
[47:21] like this he may not do what i want but
[47:23] i'll love him anyway
[47:26] no like job said though he slay me yet
[47:28] i'll trust him amen that if i die if i'm
[47:31] slain then it was god's will to take me
[47:33] home
[47:34] that's real faith
[47:39] ah
[47:40] that's the whole purpose of the
[47:41] commandment
[47:46] now look at verse 10. now here we get
[47:47] into some other things that are false
[47:49] doctrine the first is whoremongering
[47:51] which is any person who has lots of
[47:52] sexual activity just lots of sexual
[47:54] activity outside of marriage
[47:55] verse 10 for whoremongers for them that
[47:57] defile themselves with mankind
[47:59] homosexual men stealers i'll have to
[48:01] look that one up i don't know what that
[48:02] one is men's steelers
[48:04] i'll look up in just a moment uh liars
[48:06] we know what liars are
[48:08] for perjured persons if there be any
[48:10] other thing that is contrary to sound
[48:12] doctrine so now you know a doctrine of
[48:14] the devil is homosexuality's okay
[48:17] that's a doctrine of the devil right
[48:19] there paul just said it
[48:21] sleeping around with all these different
[48:23] people having kids by all these
[48:24] different women that's from hell that's
[48:26] a doctrine of the devil
[48:29] whoremonger
[48:34] let me look this up men's dealers
[48:38] men's steelers is a slave dealer a
[48:40] kidnapper oh my
[48:42] ah
[48:43] what do they call that trafficking human
[48:46] trafficking
[48:47] doctrine of a devil
[48:49] get them hooked on drugs you can make
[48:51] them sex slaves right
[48:54] one who unjustly reduces free men to
[48:56] slavery and steals the slaves of others
[48:58] and sells them that's human trafficking
[49:00] right there doctrines of devils
[49:03] perjured persons persian means a false
[49:06] swear okay so someone who lies like uh
[49:09] publicly or something like that
[49:15] okay so we see it
[49:16] doctrines of devils
[49:18] but see we anything that's contrary to
[49:20] healthy now sound doctor means good
[49:22] health right and that means the
[49:24] condition of your heart is in good
[49:25] health spiritually so when you obey
[49:27] sound doctrine you have a good heart you
[49:30] want to obey christ you want to love him
[49:32] and serve him from your heart when
[49:33] you've got false doctrine now you have a
[49:34] corrupt heart
[49:36] and you your your bellies in this case
[49:39] your belly's your god or your your
[49:41] sexual drive is your god
[49:43] right or uh selling people as slaves as
[49:46] your god making money through human
[49:48] trafficking is your god
[49:50] see
[49:51] but sound doctrine will take you away
[49:53] from that amen
[49:55] hallelujah
[49:59] all right so let's uh
[50:00] finish this one okay first timothy 5 17.
[50:05] first timothy 5 17. why don't
[50:09] case you want to read that for me you
[50:10] got it can you do it
[50:13] is that okay
[50:15] or lydia lydia what do you want do you
[50:17] want to get that
[50:19] okay linda why don't you get it first
[50:20] timothy 5 17 yeah i'm sorry case you're
[50:21] my fault
[50:31] so in a real holy ghostville church
[50:36] the saints are going to give honor
[50:40] to elders that's someone who's older in
[50:42] the lord like sister beatrice
[50:44] it can mean by your years but it can
[50:46] also mean as a pastor because elder
[50:49] means overseer
[50:50] so elder has two meanings it's either
[50:52] someone who's older in the lord they
[50:53] serve god more or it's a preacher or
[50:56] leader of the church
[50:59] so if the elders rule well that's
[51:01] speaking of preachers they're counted
[51:03] worthy of double honor especially those
[51:05] who labor in the word and what
[51:08] well then why is doctrine such a bad
[51:10] word around the message because people
[51:11] don't want to obey the word
[51:13] because they're trying to build message
[51:15] kingdoms rather than building real
[51:16] christians
[51:20] see
[51:24] there's my time
[51:25] that's okay we'll just do one more
[51:26] scripture
[51:27] so see church it's it's different than
[51:29] what we think right remember first
[51:30] corinthians 12 who gets more honor is it
[51:32] the public people or the behind
[51:34] behind-the-scenes people the bible said
[51:37] the behind-the-scenes people get more
[51:38] honor god has given them more honor
[51:41] but he said for those public figures who
[51:44] are laboring and doctrine the word he
[51:46] said they deserve double honor
[51:50] because they're laboring and teaching
[51:51] the truth to people that their hearts
[51:53] will be pure
[51:54] praise god that they will that charity
[51:57] love will rule their lives
[51:59] and they'll obey the word of god from
[52:01] their heart
[52:03] and not as
[52:04] a legalistic thing
[52:06] but because they love christ they want
[52:08] to obey the commands
[52:10] and paul said those kind of men deserve
[52:12] double honor
[52:14] well who would you honor who do you have
[52:15] to honor you have to honor your boss
[52:17] right i gotta honor my boss i gotta
[52:19] honor the
[52:21] well imagine double that honor
[52:25] i'm just gonna since beatrice is here
[52:26] i'm gonna use her as an example tonight
[52:27] so
[52:28] beatrice has to honor her boss right
[52:31] but she should give double honor
[52:33] to the elders in the church right like
[52:35] in ghana
[52:38] me too of course you know i'm an elder
[52:39] here
[52:40] but
[52:42] think about the honor you give to the
[52:43] world well the church of god should be
[52:45] above that twice as much
[52:48] twice as much
[52:49] if you're growing in doctrine and
[52:50] growing in understanding and growing
[52:52] obedience you should give double honor
[52:54] to that but remember not worship only
[52:57] give jesus worship
[52:58] amen honor just means respect respect
[53:01] them like i just put a video out about
[53:03] this today
[53:04] when i look at this there's no virtue in
[53:06] it i just put that video out it's
[53:07] actually doing pretty good
[53:09] but the point is an image is not evil
[53:12] it's only evil if you bow down and
[53:13] worship it
[53:15] right like i told that man i said i
[53:16] don't know how many times i've been
[53:18] singing and i look over there at that
[53:19] and it just really humbles me and i'm
[53:21] like it's almost like the reality of
[53:22] heaven strikes me i don't know if that
[53:24] ever happened to you
[53:25] but sometimes i go so long you know i
[53:27] just have mind battles but then when i
[53:29] see jesus and i look at his humble face
[53:31] like that it makes me want to cry or
[53:33] something
[53:34] because i think oh that man's he's in
[53:36] heaven right now but he's got white hair
[53:39] right he's got fire in his eyes you know
[53:41] he's standing in the midst of seven
[53:43] golden candlesticks in other words he's
[53:45] standing with us praise god
[53:47] amen
[53:50] but you don't bow down and worship it
[53:52] we give honor to men but we give all the
[53:54] worship to christ and not pictures of
[53:56] christ jesus christ the holy ghost
[53:58] praise god
[53:59] amen all right let me finish with this
[54:01] last one
[54:04] first timothy 6 1.
[54:09] so what do you think doctrine's
[54:09] important or not what do you what is it
[54:11] what was it what does everybody think
[54:12] here
[54:13] yeah
[54:14] give them double honor no other doctrine
[54:16] sound doctrine
[54:17] because if not they're worshiping their
[54:19] bellies
[54:21] and they will miss the kingdom of god
[54:25] if they don't have the sound doctrine
[54:26] and they don't obey it
[54:28] first timothy 6 1
[54:31] i wrote on here servants who dishonor
[54:33] masters blasphemed doctrine now look at
[54:35] that and false doctrine preachers are
[54:38] proud that's what we'll see in these
[54:39] verses that as many servants as are
[54:41] under the yoke count their own masters
[54:43] worthy of all honor that the name of god
[54:46] and his doctrine be not blasphemed now
[54:48] church i i haven't said this too much
[54:50] but listen paul lived in rome and church
[54:53] there were slaves in rome
[54:55] he lived in the roman society
[54:57] we don't have slaves in america but we
[54:58] used to have slaves in america
[55:00] notice paul never said break up the
[55:02] slavery system
[55:04] now i'm not for slavery but i'm saying
[55:06] look at the wisdom paul uses
[55:10] paul says if you're a slave
[55:12] he said give honor to your master
[55:16] right
[55:18] and then if you do
[55:19] you'll honor god but if you dishonor
[55:21] your master you blaspheme christ can you
[55:24] imagine it
[55:27] we all hate slavery we all hate it right
[55:30] but paul was not led of the lord to
[55:32] abolish slavery
[55:35] he knew that god would abolish it in
[55:37] god's own time
[55:39] he could have abolished it
[55:41] he could have said all slaves
[55:43] rebuke your masters and go free in jesus
[55:45] name but he didn't
[55:48] i'm not for slavery i know someone might
[55:50] spice this because there are devils out
[55:51] there
[55:54] i'm not
[55:55] but i mean people preachers talk about
[55:57] all the time paul never abolished it but
[55:59] he said you honor your master and that
[56:02] will show that the that christ is not
[56:04] blasphemed
[56:06] in other words you may cry and how can
[56:08] you honor a heavenly god you can't
[56:11] you have to honor heavenly i'm sorry you
[56:13] have to honor earthly people and that
[56:14] proves you honor the one you can't see
[56:16] amen
[56:17] if you can't love the ones you can see
[56:19] if you can't honor the ones you can't
[56:20] see then you can't honor the one you
[56:22] can't see praise god
[56:24] if i can't love austin there's no way i
[56:26] can love god because i can actually see
[56:28] austin i can't see god but if i love him
[56:31] that proves i love god if i love all of
[56:33] you that proves i love god amen
[56:37] i'm not for slavery but paul never
[56:41] felt led of the lord to get rid of it he
[56:43] said stay as a he said
[56:46] count your masters worthy of all honor
[56:49] that you don't blaspheme the doctrine of
[56:51] christ
[56:53] that's quite a statement
[56:56] and they that have believing masters let
[56:58] them not despise them because they are
[57:00] brethren but rather do them service
[57:02] because they are faithful beloved
[57:03] partakers of the benefit these things
[57:05] teach and exhort look he's saying teach
[57:07] this
[57:08] teach the slaves to serve well and honor
[57:11] their masters
[57:15] that's why i feel like i'm a slave to
[57:16] the bank because i'm trying to pay off
[57:17] this house
[57:19] i just got to be a happy slave
[57:21] i got to respect pnc you know
[57:24] yes sir i'll send you that money on the
[57:25] first of the month or whatever
[57:28] but this was serious this was real
[57:30] serious a lot more serious than i mean
[57:31] right now with pnc
[57:33] verse three if any man teach otherwise
[57:35] what does paul say
[57:36] and consent not to our wholesome words
[57:39] even the words of our lord jesus christ
[57:41] and to the doctrine which is according
[57:42] to godliness he's a proud
[57:46] knowing nothing donating about questions
[57:48] and strifes of words whereof cometh envy
[57:51] strife railings evil surmising
[57:53] perverse disputings of men of corrupt
[57:55] minds and destitute of truth supposing
[57:57] that gain is godliness from such
[57:59] withdrawal thyself well i'm getting
[58:01] richer i must be serving god better
[58:03] that's not always the case
[58:04] that's not always the case
[58:08] natural gain is not proof of spiritual
[58:10] gain amen
[58:13] obedience from the heart
[58:15] is truth of spiritual gain a pure heart
[58:18] is proof of a spiritual gain hallelujah
[58:21] charity love that flows out of your
[58:23] heart that's proof of spiritual gain
[58:25] amen
[58:27] not more money
[58:28] but it's can you love
[58:30] the people that god has placed you
[58:31] around
[58:32] can you honor your masters
[58:36] can i honor my principle right it's cool
[58:38] can you honor your teacher right nature
[58:42] can you honor these other ones that are
[58:44] maybe higher position than you are
[58:47] and manifest the spirit of christ
[58:51] to everyone in your life
[58:54] see any man that says you don't obey
[58:55] this doctrine paul said he's proud he's
[58:58] a deceived preacher
[59:00] he doesn't even know what he's talking
[59:01] about
[59:03] see the trouble is the message people
[59:05] don't read the bible
[59:06] more than they listen to tapes they
[59:07] listen to more tapes in the bible
[59:11] when brother brahm said
[59:12] they asked him how do i fall in love
[59:14] with god what brother adam say
[59:17] read your bible and pray
[59:19] did you say go listen to a tape no i'm
[59:21] not against listening to tapes i listen
[59:22] to tapes but how do you fall in love
[59:24] with god he didn't say listen to the
[59:25] bible he said read the bible
[59:28] and the church said
[59:30] hallelujah he didn't say you want to
[59:32] fall more in love with god read all my
[59:33] books
[59:34] he didn't say that
[59:36] he said read your bible and pray but yes
[59:38] are we going to read brother bran's
[59:39] books yes are we going to listen to
[59:40] tapes yes but see
[59:42] if message people ignore this they
[59:44] ignore the very mind of god
[59:46] then they miss the doctrines of paul
[59:49] and that's why they dishonor real
[59:50] preachers they dishonor the doctrine
[59:52] they just they disrespect the word of
[59:54] god because they're not doing what god
[59:56] said god said live by every word that
[59:58] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:03] let's stand to our feet i better stop
[1:00:04] right there because i could keep going
