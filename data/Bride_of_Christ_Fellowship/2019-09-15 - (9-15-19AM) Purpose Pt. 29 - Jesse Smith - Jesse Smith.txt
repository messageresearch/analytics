[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] first actually I want to share a little game my hat this week well I was this week I was reading the book of Exodus and I was reading about Moses and then the plagues that he had and I won't behold I had a dream about it so I think it was Thursday morning I had a dream that um my wife were driving and we saw a bunch of insects ladybugs fireflies you name it it was like a plague across the whole world and we're here for some reason we're going to California we were driving there I'm like look this is the plague in the Bible where Moses summoned all the plagues but I remember that only the Egyptians got hit but not the Israelites so they were protected like okay cuz we didn't get hit by the bugs or anything and then we drove from California to Wisconsin and then there was a tornado that came and then we were under a bridge and uh you know we're talking about getting up bring your gifts then God spoke through my wife it was like kind of like I don't know how to say it but she spoke through my wife and sees and God said if you don't move then you're gonna beat me in heaven right now I'm like oh no that means we're gonna die if we don't get out of here right now so we quickly drove and we drove all the way to Georgia but then my wife and I we were talking about you know church and like upbringing and nine gifts of the Spirit like wow this is amazing God's talking to us you know and then I saw my college buddies and I was thinking about a song in my head and it's a song about to sing and uh this guy was singing it I don't know who he was and the song was called at the midnight cry the Bride of Christ will rise and then when Jesus steps out on a kottakkal children it's pretty much talking about the rapture and then I don't know why the guy was seeing it and that it was a nighttime I was looking up in the sky and I saw the moon eclipse and was at midnight and as soon as the moon finished eclipsing I saw the cross of Jesus and that I knew that was I felt like it was gonna be the rapture at that moment and I woke up from that dream and I was telling my wife about it oh my man this is powerful and I had a dream just this morning about a few hours ago and it was about I was working and then we had a board meeting and then when I was at the board of me I saw Jesus and he was going one by one with every co-worker that I had he said will you follow me and they all said no but then when it came to me he never asked me that he never asked me if I should follow him right now I'm like okay so I went back to work I was thinking about in my head I was thinking about I heard William Brown he was talking about Halloween for some reason it was talking about how people there are people who go to church and then their hearts are so far away from God but yet they still like to go Halloween and do do all those stuff you know and yet they're in the message and stuff like family Wow and then I was thinking about that and then this part speak me I heard wedding bells ring really loud like I really thought the rapture was happening when I was sleeping that that's how loud it was and how scared I was not scary but like I was like so nervous I'm like oh man this the rash is happening right now and like my welcome or my wife woke me up before uh right after is so I'm like wow praise the Lord two weeks I mean yeah this week I had two dreams about the Lord coming the rapture happening it's so I want to sing a song I jumped about [Music] [Applause] of a mighty rushing wind and it's closer now and I can almost hear the trumpet that's Gabriel says like oh yeah the midnight cry we'll be going home when Jesus steps up on a cloud and all its children the dead in Christ all right [Music] and those that which we beg will be quickly change [Applause] after midnight cry when Jesus comes again I look around me I see prophecies fulfilling head size of the time they're a pyramid [Music] I can almost hear the father at the midnight cry the Bride of Christ will rise when Jesus the dead in Christ [Music] and those that which we made [Music] like right when Jesus comes

thankful for that let's go to first Corinthians 14 verse 1 I like to continue looking at our purpose so 1st Corinthians 14:1 I got up slow down here vamos a la primera corinthos capital rocket or saber si CRO una like to look at purpose I believe this is part 29 and we want to look at the gifts of the spirit again today you know our sobre la parte de propósito snow more event in a way that's circular donatella spirit to just read this one verse vamos al aire solamente on particular and then we'll have a word of Prayer and have you be seated here a display a bomb-ass a tener una palabra de votación isn't that enough let's read together and let's read on three one two three follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy seguin el amor y pro Corrado's Donna's a spiritualist pero sobre todo que prophetess a so just notice the order you're following the baptism of the Holy Ghost observe I lower the bhakti small espíritu Santo as you follow that you desire to see God move and gifts come on tell you think I think that but I el momento de Dios activist so that's the order and the right approach to gifts it's a lower than para obtener little Don let's have a word of Prayer vamos a tener una palabra de las iam if you have a need on your heart just raise your hand SI tiene una necesidad su corazón de Levante semana Heavenly Father thank you for today dear God as his poorest areas in yours we ask that your Holy Spirit and the son we administer to us through the Word of God la palabra de Dios encourage every heart and Corral colloquialism bring correction or thinking right correction to pensamiento help us to be yielded to you a unison your may all things be done que todo fue hecho for your glory or a to Gloria in Jesus Christ's name and normally he was a man I mean God bless she's been seated all right so Lydia we have a few quotes and slides if you'd like to switch over and that's show those now I told you I was gonna print out a little sheet for you so I have a little sheep for you today I'll pass it out at the end they have you're not okay with them I don't know oh ha ha pasado finale and maybe we'll take about ten minutes of prayer at the end and we'll just pray and ask the Lord to reveal if God has used any gift in your life a final visit and hermano Desmond o today ASEAN para buscar Nelson York a donation okay d'Asti NFR honest Avila and the purpose is so that you can be faithful with your gifts propose it to have to say I feel I don't today oh now I didn't read Luke 19 normally I must look at this in a way but we read it last week and Jesus gives everyone one pound I know on talento which in today's standards will be about $15,000 okay I'll do a aproximadamente Kings a million dollars Jesus calls that a very little amount Kenya can see that because he tells the servant you've been faithful with a very little fearful sobre lo poco I feel of feeling and then we saw how the faithful servants in McComb oil feel fear beau had a five-fold increase or tenfold increase incremental Oh cinco EDS basis praise God a lot of sales in your now I want to just go over some foundations for a moment or the or the basic truths about gifts are basically load honest because we know like with charismatic churches or Pentecostal denominational churches many of them make speaking in tongues as the evidence of the Holy Spirit yes conceal and carry blood and linguist la we then see le petit anse anthem but we know that's not exactly right okay no noise correction because when they spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost was in Pentecost this everyone understood the tongues via linguist and today most people speak with tongues and few understand yeah boy which i hain't the Evelyn Lang was in no song anthem Venus and there's five times the Holy Ghost fell in the book of Acts a sink over the sky or liquid into Santo and a liberal a chose three of them had tongues tonight the a of to Iran linguist but two of them did not well though they have not we Adam and then Paul says he Pablo DC do all speak with tongues language and that's in first Corinthians 12:30 yes M primera Corinthians DOS a treinta and so that's that our that's our position on that doctrine Trina because I've seen numerous people speak in tongues and then later fall into a complete life of sin mostarda can be the complete other picado so that proves speaking in tongues is not the seal Ling what no and he'll tell you because when you have the seal porque cuando tienes a yo it's a permanent mark on your life that means you're permanently faithful to Christ their momentum na marcado para el Senor hisses and we believe in tongues a Muslim linguist we believe interpretation but it's not the evidence of being born again everything Jesus told us the evidence he said when the spirit of truth comes Vanga it'll guide you into all truth so someone who's clearly are truly born again I'm antenna see though that no I wa is in the word all the way in obeys all the Word of God we looked at that a little bit on Wednesday night so you can watch that if you like to watch that saved on youtube now here's a few bullet points as Holy Ghost filled Christians we seek the giver Baca Moselle dad or first remarry not the gifts no so I was raised in a church that sought the gifts and they they tried to urge me to speak with tongues and they said Jesse just keep saying I love Jesus over and over aaaah - Ian Jessie Montaigne telly siendo you are more hassles your mind and there's a great anointing there and I jumbled up some of my words because I was emotional motion odd oh and they thought I spoke with tongues but I did it and as soon as they're done praying for me for me I went outside and played football Yahoo got a football but if I'd have been truly born again I would have declared the wonderful works of God because that's what acts 2 says edge of those and so they were they were sincere but sincerely wrong so we seek Christ the giver first and then the gifts follow and that's what 1st Corinthians 14:1 says means capital rocket or say Oh No listen follow charity and desire spiritual gifts praise God and Jesus says in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe so see we follow charity or the leadership of the Holy Ghost then signs follow us see we never put the signs in front of the word but the Bible says we should desire them and the Bible said we shouldn't be ignorant of them so we have to preach on them I'm okay pretty car so radio so we're not ignorant of them all so we must cover the best gifts so there's a few things we're allowed to cover in life not much but we should cover spiritual things that means so what what someone else has to see we want what God has want God's will for our lives we want God's leading amongst the church so we covered after that and then love motivates the gifts so before gift operates we we first we first know that love is our motivation now we looked at last week how gifts are Jesus's love tokens for the marriage of he and his bride and brother Branham says gifts are like bait on a hook so sometimes the manifestation of a gift will attract someone sometimes seeing a miracle will lead someone to Christ but the only way they stay with Christ is to get hooked on the word because we know anyone can see a miracle but then later fall away from God's Word is available on seniority now the Prophet also says gifts run the church and keep it clean now we know running the church would be like the fivefold ministry so God gifts men to run the church with the preaching gifts now the nine gifts of the Spirit keep it clean now preaching can too of course but this is the the the ministry of the laity is in keeping it clean praise God Casa Mira how's your wife understanding it pretty good so far okay good good so make sure we're doing a good job I want to go too slow or you know or too fast or slow okay yes sir so different for me you know I'm usually a million miles a minute you know I want to give two exact quotes from william branham and i want to share with Kylie since he's new God sent a man named William Branham he passed away in the 1960s by you and me no I think oh but he had a tremendous supernatural ministry the the most important part of his ministry was that he restored Bible work Bible teaching so that's why you refer to me say brother Branham said dear man he was also a prophet because he foretold antici for all of the event and so if you hear me say the Prophet said I'm usually referring to William Branham okay so I hope that helps you by God's grace one thing he foretold was that rock and roll would take over churches so he said that in 1965 and now we see mega churches that live on rock and roll so that was foretold you know 50 years before it happened so here's what he said about gifts there's nobody can ever see God's gifts operate but what it thrills them is it a thrill to a church when God operates supernaturally in the context of the quote brother Branham was speaking of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba and how she was so amazed at the gift of discernment and the gift of wisdom in Solomon's life here's another quote oh you're fine God's gifts has always caused an enthusiasm praise God I got to do something nice for him after service so don't leave brother I got you some nice for you now from the Bible the Bible teaches this in 1st Corinthians 14 gifts gifts they make visiting unbelievers testify to God's presence so whether it's through an interpreted tongue or the preaching of the word God discerns people's secrets when God does that the unbeliever acknowledges that God is with you how many ever had that happen to them where a preaching gift or a gift of the Spirit reveal some secret that you had in your heart oh my it's happened to all of us if not get ready you hang around God long enough he's gonna tell your secrets if you can tell the king of Syria his secrets there Elisha you listen to Elisha long enough [Laughter] which is brother branham's ministry it'll reveal your secrets praise God amen so those are some foundations now I mentioned some quotes last week and I wonder have you read them this week and I'm reading this to encourage you because we all go through seasons some seasons we feel closer to God than others some seasons were more faithful than others but God's grace never leaves us God will not forsake his children we so many times emphasized the supernatural things God did through brother Branham just like evangelicals just like evangelical churches or just like Baptist churches they remember the great things of Billy Graham's ministry and that's what we want to do today so I want to read these quotes here and show how brother Branham fell short at times but we know there's so many other times he was obedient to God and God did supernatural things through his ministry the same is true with us when we're disobedient we're gonna feel low we're gonna feel like we're not even saved but we are saved amen we are God's children we're not gonna feel like it but we all fall short of God's glory but God promises to raise us up the righteous man falls seven times but the Lord raises him up so the first one is from 1956 sometimes I look at myself and think I've been such a jellyfish in my life that's a lot of words that's okay but I'm not gonna read all of it but thank you I've waited and missed many thousands of souls in the kingdom because I've depended too much on a spiritual gift me a vision then I'll turn around and let someone talk me into something else he said but I have to come to the spot till I feel it's a faith and I must step out there because it's a promise praise God a simple example is like coming to church don't feel easy to come to church we should still come because he promised to gather whoever two or three are gathered you have a promise to meet Jesus this morning it's my promise you don't have to depend on a spiritual gift for that now like I said last week he said he missed many thousands of souls but no doubt God would have saved them some other way because the Bible said God will not lose one praise God like when Judas fell from his position God raised up Matthias in his place now we know eternally Paul will be take that place but history says Matthias preached in many communities as a missionary started many churches and then died as it through crucifixion like Christ see God will find a way to save the souls Jesus leaves the 99 and he goes to get the one praise God then he says sometimes I stand around like a jellyfish and it makes me discouraged with myself anyone ever get discouraged about yourself it's time to keep your eye on the promise by God's grace I aim to do and I realize every devil of Hell will shoot at me but by God's grace I aim to keep my eye on the promise so see we're all gonna feel like failures at times we're all gonna feel like failure sometimes we got to turn our eyes to Christ don't look at ourselves but look at the sacrifice the blood of Christ in heaven and let our courage be renewed let your mind be transformed have a new start have a new season a new beginning a fresh start with the Lord now this is a long quote but it's preached in jeffersonville he's talked about people doing worldly things like sports games Mews mints television Hollywood he says your soul is growing on that kind of trash I'm gonna change the word that's the reason people don't have real hunger for God I was looking at an article online and it said you might people see my people might see eight commercials in an hour Oh Joe commercialism and most of those have some type of sexual temptation on them so see people's souls grow on that spirit of lust or may I say they're feeding on those unting spirits so that's why they don't want to feed on the things of God unless they'll say it's okay for me to watch a game it's okay for me to watch a movie but it's not really if all this trash comes along with it because it it makes you feed on the world rather than feeding on God's Word and the Prophet says you ought to have your Bible out somewhere laying out before God on your knees praying for the sins of the country he said I'm guilty with you so he noticed how he could be praying more and we could all raise our hands and say I should pray more but we've got to follow that up with action so we got to pray more tomorrow don't put it off to next year do it tomorrow he said I've made up my mind by the help of God I'm determined to press towards the mark I'm gonna skip some words here he said I'm lagging behind and become a spiritual enemy ax I'm sorry Anna Anna Anna Mia anemia anemia sorry never the same the under asana trust instead in the nearest cell the hallelula by now I should read the sentence before head I'm sorry the beginning part of the sentence seeing the works and the things I've seen that's right I'm sorry seeing the works and seeing the things that I've seen and lagging behind it's every understand he should have been further up the road you and I should probably be further up the road right if we're honest with ourselves but God is great in translations and moving people up the road like with Philip praise God he naturally translated him up the road in other words God can help us catch up if we fall behind God is the great restorer I hope these quotes help you I'm a jellyfish I'm lagging behind there's another one 1953 he's preaching on do you now believe I'm not calling any down because of unbelief because I pray God forgive me of my unbelief I'm ashamed of my faith there's many personal dealings and face-to-face talks and experience that God has given me I feel ashamed of myself I publicly confess it I ought to have mountains of faith but I see he realized he didn't have mountains of faith but he knew he should have so he couldn't rebuke the people so I hope this helps you understand also recognize this though if you get a genuine rebuke from a preacher and it's led by the Holy Spirit then that preacher must be walking in obedience to the word I can show you many times brother branham rebuke denominations never understand see there's time and that's because we're in a season of obedience but they're seasons where we can't rebuke because we need the rebuke praise God is that what it says the RAM said I can't rebuke you because I'm falling short but then in the indictment sermon he rebukes every preacher that teaches there's no more miracles and refuses to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when they've seen though when they've seen the truth of it and he indict them in the name of Jesus Christ to indict means to formally charge now if that's not a rebuke I don't know what is so I hope this helps us understand if it does say Amen see I normally put quotes of the Prophet that are all teaching that are all exploits of faith they're all speaking the word but here I wanted to show you some more humble quotes that showed his humanity and how he had to wrestle against flesh and blood just like you and I wrestle against flesh and blood I'll tell you he won the wrestling match and so can you praise God so can I Amen praise God but the only thing I say is god help us have faith and as we see manifestations of God's presence it increases our faith to believe in Him praise God now gifts are manifestations of God's Spirit so we want to see our faith rise but that comes by seeing God using his gifts so we see how they're connected praise God now I just want to go through two quick quotes concerning your gifts the first one he says first find out if it's scripture for you to do it if it's in the scriptures not just wrote in one place but I mean completely scriptural through the Bible for you to do it your position and I'm gonna skip down first see if God called you so God's only gonna call you through the Bible God's not going to call you to a gift outside the Bible the easiest example is women preachers Jesus never called a woman to be an apostle and Paul said I never allow a woman to teach men all the other examples of women that have authority in the Bible are in their area as been leadership through the priesthood Deborah is the most used example she was a judge but that's not spiritual in the priesthood that's that's political like we'd say in the government and the fact was Israel was Baxter then at that time so the men weren't leading as they ought to so they lacked male leadership so God had to raise up a woman in the government who had a gift of prophecy praise God next now brother ram tells us to try out a gift but of course we pray first if the gift is not even in the Bible for you to do it then you won't try it out no matter how much you pray about it so first fine if it's scriptural then you pray about it before you try it out so it's easy to look at a preacher and as an example I'll use myself as soon as I came to the message and I go to message churches like the first one I went to his brother Samuel is up there as soon as I walked in I knew I was called to the pulpit I felt like a magnet pulling me to the pulpit but I waited upon it I prayed about it I just let the Lord deal with it and then about three years later was when I started preaching [Laughter] praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus glory Bray's God but I had to take that step of faith because faith is a revelation it was revealed to me I'm to be at the pulpit it wasn't a step of Hope it was a step of faith and we've got to be careful not to take steps of hope first let God reveal your gift then you step out in faith to act upon it praise God now the prophets talking about a song leader he said God has give you talent you say well brother branham God hasn't given me nothing I wonder how many people come to church with that attitude how sad that is whether William they'll go years people will go decades and feel like God gave them nothing that's impossible the Bible said the gifts are given to every man so that we all profit everybody has a divine portion a measure of a gift the Bible says whether your portion is small medium or massive or large you have a divine deposit you have a divine talent God has given to you and you and I are supposed to use it for others glory you should live for the people in this room if nobody else you should live for the people in this room I know it's hard to save souls I get discouraged sometimes too but God always encourages me when he uses my gift to help all of you because that's what the gifts are for Lord they're for believers they're not for unbelievers they're for believers but so many people say they have nothing you know that's a sin I believe to say God hasn't given me anything that's like the man that buried the tail in the ground he just forgot about it the trouble is you forgot what God gave you amen you so buried it down under years of depression or years of doubt and fear that we forget what God has given to us we forgotten the move of the Holy Spirit in the pound's parable he put a napkin around it in the pound's parable he wrapped a napkin around his money and we'll be all so we see just covered you want to hide it from his own sight so he covered it up that's what people will do today they're so pissed about their gifts they'll just put it out of their sight they'll look at anything else other than God's call for their life look at money in business jokes in Hollywood Sports and shopping you name it look at anything else but God's divine gifts in their life he says you don't know maybe see you may just go try something maybe you've never went out and testified to somebody try that going everybody can't do that we all know Simon can do it Simon save that so this socios I was pointing you but I had three point back at me sister see actually two pointing you sat right Simon can he just he just came up like this he said brother Jesse he said you've got to listen this serpent seed sermon excellence I see me enter little pimping he urged me to listen to it I'll say like this he compelled me to listen to it because that's scriptural Jesus said the last call for the wedding supper he said go to the highways and hedges and compel them to come in hallelujah now Simon doesn't do that with everybody but he does it with a lot more than I do because everybody can't do that but if you're not sure and if you never tried try it today man try tomorrow try this week get prayed up and see if you can't testify to somebody there's something you can do that you can put it to God he says he said you have to yield so with gifts it's all about yielding to God's Spirit in other words we got to be willing to do something thank God we're willing to come to church now God's calling you for another level of being willing you got to be willing to give more to the kingdom of God coming to church is not going to be enough to go in the rapture that's part of it but you got to be willing to give more of your life to God you got to be wise with your time because if you're saved you'll either be foolish with your time or wise with your time and if you're wise with it you'll have extra oil to go out to meet Christ yeah to go into the marriage supper so how we deal with our time reveals which condition were in we ought to feel blessed God give us a few extra years to use our time for the kingdom of God if you haven't yet redeemed the time and you don't yet know your gifts or you're not investing in your gifts thank God for another year to service make this the year you purposely redeemed the time well BAM even calls whistling a gift did you know that he calls whistling a gift and don't that's why sometimes I whistle during song service I just love to do it but a man who sings has to yield his voice like our brothers with the song special like Naomi songs specialist was a Wednesday night has to be something that you yield or sacrifice for others he says the man who could sing yielded himself he give in to it in other words he surrendered we might not feel like it we've got to give in to it we've got to let Christ lead us instead of leading ourselves and he says that's how he yields to visions he talks again about men singing and men whistling the same this the same way you yield to whistling what he says is the same way he yields to a vision read it all together it's for one edification of the glory of Jesus Christ the Son of God so if you feel like you got a gift make sure it's scriptural pray beforehand get anointed then yield yourself try to do it I got a little scripture on my heart bear with me go to Ezra got Azra I just read it this morning my what a tremendous Scripture it was here Ezra I gotta look it up it was right here sorry I'm gonna preach a little bit on this tonight oh here it is yeah Ezra 822 it's so small please don't strain your eyes as you're 822 it ties right in with gifts Ezra 822 a dress or short length goes now brother amen sings a song called in your presence and that's where I'm strong that's where I belong I sang that growing up in the Pentecostal church in the 1980s and 90s I loved the song then I loved a lot more now especially when he sings it because he's got the revelation of the message as her 8:22 now in context Ezra's leaving Babylon to go back to Israel and let's read verse 22 for hours ashamed to require the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way to avert winds at the penetrate ropa a gente de caballo cannot defend the assemble in amigo and El Camino because we had spoken under the king saying diciendo the hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek Him sobre la busca but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him verse 23 so we fasted and we saw our God for this and he was entreated of us did you catch that revelation in there when is guy hand upon you when you're fasting and seeking his face and notice the Bible said all a double L now just preachers any servant of God male female younger old when they're seeking God the hand of God is upon them the anointing of the Holy Ghost is upon all them that seek God glory that's why I like that song in your presence that's where I'm strong and to presence yeah I yet on the euro so I fourth day after I spend time praying in God's presence I walk to the pulpit amen I'm gone I feel like I'm gonna slay some demons or something like that because the hand of God is upon me I don't care what anybody says I don't care who's here don't care who's livestreaming when the hand of God is upon you God is going to use your gifts because you've just spent time seeking his face to Tiempo with candles rostro he's anointed you for the job can you say Amen that's why fasting is so important that poor SSK like you know is muy importante it truly brings humility you never be as humble as you want to be until you fasted a you and me in that scriptural Psalms 30:5 Cinco verse 15 35 15 Kings II know it's 13 sorry I said 35 13 or something I think they think of dressing but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sack cloth you're one the way your thing for tomorrow maybe Steve if he leaves you I humbled my soul with fasting preheat oh my you know me Alma and my prayer returned into my own bosom Amiata fiance well via I miss em so see that david says he humbled himself through fasting nowadays I can tell me yours in me you know and notice it said his soul Alma and see then the prayer returned in other words the spirit gave witness of God's Spirit in authority vo then recompense is speedy to the Neos our spirit bears witness with his spirit no it was pity to leave a car guard in the spirit to videos and that's how many times I know yes which I bet that you'll say what God wants me to preach as I'm studying Commerce to the end oh I'll feel the presence of the Lord yo siento la presencia your and I get a witness from God that this is truth but then I gotta check it by the word and then you receive it and don't you tell a receive it then you rejoice or then you repent just like we all do does that help by God's grace you know who wants God's hand upon them so I tell you that I don't want God to remove his hand from me no I don't want that no that mean because remember his hand is his protection okay sumon oh no I brought the handle and for him to remove that oh my now we're in trouble here where was the mana for vamos Italian problemas that means we gotta stay in step with the Holy Spirit's leading and and did he heal a cell espírito Santo praise God I want to read this quote about God will drive you to your gift Sita some of us back onto CeeLo as you soo-dong I'm not going to read all of it but it is scriptural at the beginning of this purpose series we showed through the scripture how God had a drive Paul to his ministry God had to drive Moses to his ministry God had to drive David to the ministry and so God will do the same for you so if you don't know your gifts God will take you there I can see that in my life in 2012 God started driving me into deeper teaching and then are the teaching YouTube ministry based upon that I wrote the modesty book now seven years later today I can see the fruits of that leading like on Labor Day weekend on that Friday morning I got a voicemail from California of a man that doesn't know the message but he found my book read it and he thanked me for writing it he said it took away all the confusion about modesty he said years of confusion he said his daughters would argue about the scripture and they dress immodestly but he said God used the gift to give him a Bible definition for modesty and he said what a gift to the body of Jesus Christ praise God but God had to drive me to that sure wasn't easy but brother Scott encouraged me he said every man has to do three things plant a tree write a book was the third one brother have a child okay plant a tree write a book and have a child plant a tree write a book have a child or have a baby [Laughter] that's a lot of wisdom see God had to drive me to that it wasn't easy neither will your ministry be easy God wants you to overcome in other words you've got tools to overcome that's prayer that's the word that's your gifts that's the body of Christ that's your brothers and sisters you have all these tools to overcome the gates of Hell hallelujah each one of us has a different ministry one works different each has a separate ministry all that comes in the CRO beautiful all that comes in the Christ has a ministry I forgot to highlight that one see you gotta get in Christ amen you gotta be born again all those in Christ have a ministry not only the preacher but you have a ministry something you can do amen let's say praise the Lord but usually God has to drive you into your correct ministry like a child child what doesn't want to do something you better Drive that job to do it right last year at school I'm a school teacher of six-year-olds two children miss their mother so much they didn't want to stay at school so the moms had to drive them physically into the room into my hands and then run down the hallway I guess I'm a pretty scary figure for a six-year-old but by the end of the year they're the ones hugging me and loving me separation anxiety is a reality sometimes you have to be driven into something and so let's recognize if God is driving us into something now for us at our church this is the way I feel this God is having me preach it again [Music] and again and again and again to try to drive us to find our ministries it might not feel like a good thing but it's the will of God because I showed you the last quote or the quotes last week well the Brandon said it's just as essential that you are in your position in the house of God as the pastor hallelujah so be it hallelujah see we gotta find our position as you follow the Holy Ghost the signs will follow you look back at the signs and then you can see where you're where you been right well I whenever I Drive home from Toledo to Akron I pass the Lodi sign every time as I'm driving forward I can look in the rearview mirror and I see that I passed Lodi the same things happens in the spiritual I Drive past another here Li another healing brother William I just passed another healing that's where I've been that's following me that must be where God wants to use me praise God now that's what we got to do we got to see where God has taken us we have to look back at our lives honestly and see when was there a real time God anointed me to help other people praise God that's probably your ministry notice I said probably because God may use you one time for something and then never use you for that again praise God a man no they asked brother Branham should we seek we should we all come together and seek for our ministry fella BAM said no don't do that he said usually believers run from it you take a man that always says Lord I'll do this I'll do that God knows he'd be prideful or a stuffed shirt a stuffed shirt of prideful is prideful now this quote is used often and it should be but it's got to be balanced out - with other quotes like the one I read earlier about every one of you has a ministry and you need to be interested in your ministry now we cannot neglect our gifts so that quote cannot abolish what the scripture says so at the beginning of your walk with God you're not gonna pridefully try to find a gift you're gonna humbly wait on God until he shows you the gift after that it changes now you invest in that gift now you don't avoid it now you seek after it and that's a scripture once you're driven to it then you invest in it and you give yourself completely to it because that's Paul's advice to Timothy does that make sense now do we need to read that or is everybody familiar with that scripture great raise your hand if you want me to read that scripture seemed like everybody knows okay couple all right let's go okay first sir second Timothy three that's good I like I like honest people I like that now I was so ashamed in school I would never raised my hand I didn't want people to think I didn't know but now I'm like I don't care people know if I don't know I want to know lost my fears second Timothy three let me find the scripture here I may be in the wrong book I'm sorry I am in the wrong book first Timothy 4 forgive me verse 12 first Timothy 4:12 sorry to see you have to balance William branham's quote with the word the quote is right and the word is right but you can't go overboard on the quote or else you'll never have a gift you'll never recognize your gift is ever understand that's why that quote can only work for so long people use it as a crutch we'll see I don't have to seek for God for a gift but we just saw how if you seek God God hand comes upon you and if God is ever gonna use - it's when his hand is upon you Amen that's right let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in Word and conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity see now same flow the Locrian test in palabra conductor amor espíritu fare till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine like sorta see own Alliance agency I'm gonna read this wrong but does it say neglect the gift that's in thee cuz you're not old enough in the message no doesn't say that in fact he's talking to a young man who's fearful older they're not gonna respect me because I'm not old like Paul yes ignore the gift he said neglect not the gift that is in thee just read that one element a prophecy a con line position de las manos del verse 15 meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them I almost said partly that thy profiting may appear to all see we're trying to emphasize this thought you can't ignore the gifts in your life you must also run from them you're supposed to run to God so he can help you handle that gift the church said that's a good Amen right there verse 16 take heed unto my unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee alright everyone understand now we just saw a quote our brother Graham said don't see good don't see gifts you'll be a stuffed shirt now let me give you a quote now this is the quote about Jerry Steffi Jerry Steffi but the brand didn't want him to waste his painting gift it's too bad to see a tail it that wouldn't be developed if God thinks that much about paints glory how much more about singing how much more about divine healing if he thinks that much about oil-based paints how about the Holy Ghost oil gift I'm just trying to say it somehow Amen if he cares so much of the natural oil what about the spiritual door there's a preacher in here somewhere there's a preacher so hard going slow today thankful here's a quote from 1954 where brother Branham says an evidence of the Holy Ghost is wanting to do something for God so you have to balance all these quotes with the word yes if you don't know your gift weight but if God shows you your gift don't wait invest in it and please my request is just my request please let the pastor know so I know your gift you've got a gift of praying and fasting yeah you know and someone is in bondage or addicted the Bible says praying and fasting breaks the chains do you believe that absolutely it does we prayed and fasted for Christopher years later he was healed of his seizures we prayed for Samuel who had cancer we fasted for him he was healed months later a lot faster in josé's a witness of that because those people are his family I'm skipping here I'll give you my estimation of what I think the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian its travail of soul a person always hungry and thirsting for God day and night they can't stand it they gotta do something for God praise the Lord they're full of love and so travail all the time and now he goes into prayer and quotes the Book of Psalms he that sews and tears will return again rejoicing with precious sheaves praise the Lord so see we got to balance these quotes with the scripture I know I'm going long let me check my notes here okay yeah let me finish with this quote and then I'll get to this sheet and then we'll be done maybe you can about 15 more minutes here if God would have asked me about a group of people if God would have asked me do you want all your church to shout I'll just kind of paraphrase it sure do you want them to all speak in tongues sure you want them all to dance in the spirit sure all right that's very good but what would you rather have them do hallelujah let me it let's be wrong we don't see a lot of this all the time in our church right and the church said and that's okay if it's not your gift don't try to impersonate it if you don't have victory and dance sometime you ought to get victory and dance it's glorious it's been a few weeks since I've done that but it's been glorious I'd rather have a church that had such a burn on their heart for prayer and just stayed at the altar day and night and in their house constantly in prayer humble trying to get people to come to God making phone calls in the hospital visiting the sick trying to get people to come to church and do right I'd rather have that and all the other put together amen it belongs in the church I'm sorry although the others right it belongs in the church praise the Lord now here's all yes I'd put prayer first because if you've got prayer all the other will take place amen and some people don't dance they don't pray enough and repent of their sins praise God you gotta pray you gotta talk to God amen if you've got that if you get so hungry for God shout it will take place amen we get so hungry for God speakin in tongues will take place if you got so hungry for God he said you'll keep hungry keep yourself right I guess keep yourself right but if you see yourself getting indifferent or disinterested I'm talking about prayer because no man would have rather Prayer than everything else if our church is not interested in prayer then we're probably not gonna see all the other things because if you do prayer the rest will come hallelujah if you see yourself getting disinterested you've got a different spirit stay right before God with humble with your veil of soul just be that good old-fashioned Holy Ghost field saying can I just hit right and the church said I'm trying to close bear with me I can prove by the Bible that's the first time the angel of God went over the lands to see what the Holy Ghost he only sighed I'm sorry only sealed those who cried inside for the abominations done in accra Ezekiel chapter 9 I want to ask you a question what would take place today if the Holy Ghost went through Jeffersonville Akron to seal those this afternoon who would be at home praying God send a revival just so hungry for a meeting Oh God look at the sins of the city isn't it terrible God won't you please send a revival God send some good preacher send someone where would the Holy Ghost seal think of that praise God who would he steal an Akron little bigger who'd he steal in Ohio that's a little bit bigger who would he steal in America who's that home sighing and crying saying God send a revival because that's what God did the first time all right I'm skipping that we'll get to that next time here's the nine gifts to the spirit and with a manky do me a favor give everybody one of these we'll just take about ten minutes well I only have 12 so give it to the Saints that usually come to Akron if we have leftovers we'll give it to the visitors but I don't know if they're leftovers well that's out of ink I just I need to order ink it just ran out recently I sorry my now I just want you to take a few minutes we're gonna invite the musicians up in just a moment I just want to have some music playing as music drives out demons multi Cobra marinade for the yah multi cover I'm gonna put a come on yeah and I'll have some pens ready in a little bit but just let me explain so I want to give some examples of the gifts of the Spirit now the brown ones are the ones we're probably not as familiar with the black ones are we're pretty familiar with now word of wisdom helps you make a decision to building a to build skillfully upon your life in the perfect I'll just say this helps you do the perfect will of God [Music] because the Bible said wisdom builds its house so a person will give you a word of wisdom and it will help direct your life now word of knowledge well Bram said his knowledge of the word you didn't know the Bible said that somebody brought it to your attention and now you know and knowing opens the door jesus said jesus said knowledge is the door of not or I'm sorry call it the key of knowledge and I'll give examples of these in a moment faith but man says you already know you got what you asked for you speak faith and you know what's going to happen gifts of healing can be instant healing I'm sorry gifts of healing take time to heal [Music] miracles are something spontaneous and supernatural that happened instantly now prophecy for us will be in the form of dreams many times although it could come just as a thus saith the Lord prophecy now discerning means judging so the sermon judges spirits and the thoughts and intents of people's hearts and we know tongues are usually either tongues of men or tongues of angels an interpretation tells you what the tongue said okay now let me give some examples and then after this we'll take about 10 minutes to write down I'm leaving you that space so you can write down some from your life just give me a couple if you got a lot then you've got lots of gifts so let me give a few my wife and I have two dreams that seem to be prophetic because they foretold what was going to happen we had dreams that were prophetic so Kristyn dreamed about a sister wearing pants in other words she'd be backslidden she laughed about it said it would never happen within a couple years that had happened so that was foretelling something that was a warning about something that's gonna happen she didn't heed the warning now she's been married and divorced and just her life is ruined I would hate a thousand philadelphia people I got it and laughs because she didn't obey the Bible and the church said I had a dream about a pastor son-in-law everybody said he had the Holy Ghost well I had a dream he was playing tennis in a woman's bikini kind of thing it was pink his wife is outside the tennis court watching him just having a good old time well I went told the brother about it I said the Lord has telling me this he didn't laugh it off but he shrugged it off and said no that's not gonna happen [Music] years later they've left the message and they take pictures on facebook on their friends on Facebook playing tennis he's got his shirt off pair of short shorts on they weren't pink they were not pink but his wife's out there in short shorts playing tennis with him now you tell me was that foretelling the future or not because God always gives warning before judgment to me that's foretelling the future so if you're a dreamer make sure you pray out before you go to bed cuz Satan can't get in there I've had dreams that I didn't like and I rebuked him in Jesus Christ's name and honestly that's the only time it's ever been prophetic in my life second we had the Sermon through a dream with Amon and who about a year ago their dream was referencing wolves entering into the church and when they let me know that that same scripture I just preached on in text I was I was ministering on that same Scripture so their dreams and they had dreams of certain people like wolves attacking them and the church attacking them was just them yeah just you guys and I just had that scripture on my heart and I just shared it with my wife that actually that night I just shared it with my wife and I got a text from amen saying that Scripture came to his mind and it discerned the spirit in that conflict perfectly that spirit was trying to attack them and attack me it was trying to tell me what to preach praise God and there was some more details on that I told you about it later or last year but see that judge what spirit was attacking them and me it judged now the good thing is one of them came back to repent that's the good thing see so that's another vindication repenting of that wrong spirit as they get the wisdom I was talking to a pastor who was accused of being a failure as a father all because he led his boys play basketball I felt the Bruns of God come upon me I'm just on the phone I start quoting quotes from brother Branham in scriptures like a Russian river coming out of my mouth and showing the balance with sports the brother rejoiced on the phone and said that was a gift of wisdom I didn't say it he said it praise God and it set him free from that condemnation praise the Lord directing his life because we'll wisdom builds the house knowledge I heard preached first Corinthians 6:12 and the Bible said you should not be brought under the power of anything when I read that scripture my heart was set on fire I posted that scripture in my room up on the wall I started quoting that scripture every time I had a tobacco addiction or pornography addiction or whatever it was I started quoting that scripture the beautiful thing was I don't even know what's in the Word of God but once I had knowledge of that the key of knowledge opened the door of deliverance and that's the first sermon I preached in January 2004 was on addictions praise God another one on knowledge a preacher called me and said he was being accused that he should have preached and be a deacon I told him I pray for him I just felt led to share with my wife so my wife shares a scripture that Philip was both a deacon and a preacher evangelist share it called the brother back he started crying on the phone and he's still preaching this day see that's knowledge of the Lord that's what the gift is for so God used my wife with the gift of knowledge she wasn't Janette me she was just sharing what the scripture says okay last one I don't have up here but tongues interpretation in 2010 Steven Kressel gave a tongue and interpretation at our church I was preaching in Columbus but they recorded it being recorded it and after the interpretation came it said why would you die you need to be revived Davida so I went and asked everybody in the church I went to ask everyone in the church who felt like they were spiritually dying three people told me they did see the Bible said try every spirit that's the only time in our church's history that we've had an unknown tongue interpretation and it was right on nine years ago praise God now at the bottom those are just ministries I'm not gonna go over those I've tried to divide a male and female this is a growing list I'll keep building this men can preach deacons prophesy with all nine gifts they can labor in prayer which we just saw program said I'd rather have prayer a ministry of prayer than any other ministry testifying in evangelism the Shepherd's they weren't preachers but they could testify what God had showed them music and dance that's what we course our music ministry with Malik I'm brother amen females can prophesy of all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit prayer and fasting Anna had the ministry the Bible said she served God at the temple of God with the Ministry of prayer and fasting alms deeds and clothing for the poor Tabitha did that in Acts chapter 9 laboring in the gospel ministry traveling with and financially supporting preachers was a ministry of the sisters like Susannah and Mary Magdalene they just traveled with them and supported their ministry with money testifying and evangelism Anna testified to everybody about Jesus being born the woman at the well testified to everybody that Jesus Christ discerned her life Priscilla testified with her husband Aquila to Apollo's so she just testified that the Holy Ghost was real remember he didn't know about the Holy Ghost he knew about baptism and sanctification but didn't know about the Holy Ghost so she was there as a witness the Holy Ghost is real I'm full of it that's a real testimony right there and music and dance in the women well let's the end of our feet here musicians if you'll come now as you're standing just keep the sheet in your hand or you you can pray let's just pray for about 10 minutes and ask the Lord if you'd remind us of any ways where you've been used in a gift or of someone else in the church you've seen some of these gifts I tried to list some like I said they don't happen all the time I know there's more than that you know those are the ones yesterday I was that came to my mind as I was preparing where I can no doubt say this was a definite gift of God God supernaturally use someone in order to serve the body of Christ praise God just play you have a song brother okay got you I was gonna say if you don't Potter's hand but if you cuz he says use me call me guide me filming you know but whatever you feel like to do that's just the first thought on my mind you love the Lord today well I went long I've almost preached two hours my you know part that's the interpretation Thank You Lily she appreciates it too maybe that's her gift worship and shout and praise hallelujah let's just take a moment here what song was this he shot in with God one time and then let's just pray for a little bit and ask the Lord lord please show me maybe this would be the time for the Lord to show you and look back maybe through the you know through the rearview mirror of life it's a Lord that's why the professing person I gave that person that word they didn't even know it in a set of free maybe God will give you wisdom see where God used a church that gives you an idea where you may use for the future the RAM even said God doesn't take dystrophy look it up if God gave you a gift he's not gonna take it from that made you about that gift and you got to be faithful with it you've got it invested in and we want to see a huge right here in the Church of God we want to see God's people [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now you can pray in your own way I just want a few moments where we can see God I'm going to set my timer to subtle I know people might have to go but let me just set a little timer here we don't wanna I don't know where yeah I know what the kids eat at the same time this is these things are turn remember we read last week Bill Graham said we spend our too little time on the rewards of God the eternal rewards of God are too lightly esteemed we don't reach you enough we don't major on them enough we don't emphasize them enough about earning eternal rewards through faithful stewardship god help us to be faithful and accurate I can't answer for another church I can only answer for this church I can only answer for myself lord help me to be faithful steward your gun I've tried to live everything I preached to you by your grace I fall short maybe I'm a jellyfish something I should have more faith than I should have a lord by your grace I've tried to live everything [Music] let's pray for all in here Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus thank you for this wonderful time in your presence Lord this is where I envisioned this series going when I started it over a year ago January I'm mission building up for the people [Music] that they could then not neglected but invested it and they could be just as interested in getting their gifts in the house of God as the pastor or something or Deacon or trustee as you getting its position right in the house of God and Lord hoping that everyone would be so hungry to pray and realize it's a great evidence of a Christian to perm to travail in prayer to constantly want to do something for God we have ladies on his leadership Hey witnessing or testifying or praying for someone trying to get somebody to church or sharing a tract or passing out a book or sharing a website just want to do something for the kingdom of God Oh God [Music] let your hand be upon us to your God amen may we get in the position where your hand get honesty in prayer and seeking your face and read the scripture Lord God in meditating in focusing on our gifts not neglecting giving ourselves wholly to the gifts that we see when I forgot one I know brother Jose had that word of faith I forgot about that when we met up there where he spoke to that barren couple and said you are gonna have a baby and ten months later they did against all odds a word of faith he knew it was gonna happen because of wish you using the gift holida thank you no thank you Jesus I'll faithful you are thank you Jesus or take each person out down Lord through their lives I pray in Jesus Christ let them look in the rearview mirror of life they pass any signs [Music] I can see it my wife I can see it in my life therefore examples we used up here we thank you for that I know it's in the house of God the answers to our questions the Word of God shirts the very thoughts in pencil our ha help us just be humble and recognize that divine portion or deposit of a gift that's been placed in our lives may we not just try to cover it up with some cloth and just not look at it maybe we just take the cloth off this morning now this afternoon if you've got to get the same of us to invest in it we got a ministry of praying and fasting help us to invest in that we got a gift of dreams with the sermon or prophecy or tongue interpretation or wisdom or knowledge or faith miracles god help us do the best and if you're gonna as your prophet said we ought to investigate something's wrong we're not investing our gift something's wrong we put other things before the kingdom of God thank you thank you Jesus praise be to God thank you for your word it's very small Lord overseas I'll preach three hours just the serving three hours and they'll sit there and rejoice and praise God oh god help us to humble ourselves a little bit [Music] we thank you for this word Lord it's your word it's not mine but your prophet taught us Lord if we're willing to be taught to hate men if we can have a learner's spirit and get out of stagnancy and complacency and go into the growth mode amen we those seeds can sit dormant for years but God once they're in the right condition amen now springboard god help the gifts in our lives as far maybe be in the right condition of word to bring forth abundance unto you Lord Ananta five times ten times twice as much of the gifts in our lives that was the ourselves wholly of God [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's quite a commute talk with and speak [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm very thankful for the word this morning let's go around dismiss an order prayer here before you are I just not gonna force anybody but if you'd like to share your gifts with me I'd sure like to know that way if I would need and maybe I can't really pray for someone like a hawk see there's the ten minutes I can see a brother or sister please pray for them I got a busy week I'm gonna be able to or brother bank let's join together in prayer this person has a need I know you can pray I know you can do this I know God's called you let's see if God will answer praise God praise Allah I'd sure like to know but if not that's okay God knows God knows right where we are I just think it'd be helpful to know I think be helpful for the rest of the Saints to know Tim so we can contact one another for prayer for encouragement for wisdom for knowledge amen all these things that we see in the scripture but above all like unlike brother Branham I would prefer to have a church for the prayer warriors than anything else Tom bites again to pray before service pray after service we have to prayer meetings every week Wednesday night at 6:30 Sunday morning at 10:30 everybody's welcome to all the prayer meetings praise the Lord I'm not the spot where I pray before every Sunday night but I want to get there like I said last week I'm not I might not be a prayer work right now but by God's grace I want to be I don't want to be a prayer weekly we should know that I'm trying to get the Holy Ghost back in the land to the rhapsode Nicolaitans he said it's the worst is have a bed number that it's never been worse to put all this anointing in the pulpit instead of sharing the anointing everybody's anointed it's the worst that's ever been he said the church age so what am i trying to do I'm trying to get everybody to come to church with a serious attitude praying fasting seeking God so the hand of God can be upon everybody trying to break that demon of the geladen system I'm trying to knock him
