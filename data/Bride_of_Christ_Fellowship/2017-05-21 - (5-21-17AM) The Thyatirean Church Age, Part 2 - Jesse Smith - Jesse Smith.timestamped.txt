[39:26] burden for this message this morning

[40:42] sure this to everybody you know when's I
[40:46] don't let a preach on a little message I
[40:47] just want to start with that the message
[40:49] called the Holy Ghost is timid and I
[40:52] will kind of want to bring that back
[40:53] just to remind the church oh how
[40:55] sensitive we have to be to the Holy
[40:56] Spirit I don't know if you saw that I
[40:58] want to encourage the church if you're
[41:00] not able to livestream those services
[41:01] try and listen to it on Thursday or
[41:03] Friday or Saturday because if you miss
[41:07] out on a service you kind of missed the
[41:08] direction of the Holy Spirit never
[41:10] understand that like if you're a sheep
[41:12] okay let's say you miss a meal from the
[41:14] Shepherd you know you're going to be
[41:16] little disconnected you know and if we
[41:18] want to be connected as a body try to
[41:20] feasts on every word that you can
[41:21] because it ain't me mode absence you've
[41:24] got to look beyond the preacher we've
[41:25] got to see Christ in the word amen so if
[41:28] you haven't listened to Wednesday night
[41:29] I encourage you to do that it'll help
[41:31] you by God's grace we looked at a lot
[41:34] how young he sends it to the Holy Spirit
[41:36] but God could move you know in the
[41:38] atmosphere if we made it right with God
[41:41] and serve God and basically ended up
[41:43] with word to the church brother Brandon
[41:45] left us above all he said love one
[41:47] another
[41:48] he said Satan's gonna he said you have a
[41:50] honeymoon as a church a honeymoon period
[41:52] as a church right and then he said but
[41:55] say he's not gonna let it remain that
[41:57] way he said he's going to inject
[41:59] somebody with poison to test the church
[42:00] God's get allowed to test the church and
[42:04] he said when that poison comes and
[42:05] somebody gets need and I starts talking
[42:07] bad about somebody or something like
[42:08] that he said don't join up with them but
[42:11] rally together as
[42:12] body in love they met and so I just
[42:15] thought it'd be good you know and I kind
[42:17] of shared how I felt like I can see as a
[42:19] pastor I'm here every service I can see
[42:21] as a pastor how we had a honeymoon
[42:22] period the last few years but then
[42:24] Satan's trying to inject some poison
[42:26] into the church so I understand that
[42:28] like you see people come in and then
[42:31] fall out or come in and fall out you
[42:33] know they they can't remain faithful why
[42:35] is that because they don't have the
[42:36] Spirit of God in their hearts right the
[42:38] right church but man said he said I'll
[42:41] tell you he said if you got the Spirit
[42:43] of God your heart you can't wait for
[42:44] those doors to open and fellowship with
[42:46] your brothers and sisters glory that's a
[42:49] big if if you've got the Spirit of God
[42:51] anointing you your heart you see what
[42:53] people feed the black dog the black dog
[42:55] the black dog and they don't to come
[42:57] feed the white dog because they're so
[42:58] same to get them discouraged or
[43:00] depressed or something like that but if
[43:02] you've got the Spirit of God in you you
[43:03] can't wait to see your brothers and
[43:04] sisters because you're gonna spend
[43:06] eternity with them
[43:07] amen it's exactly right holiday be there
[43:10] so if you didn't listen to that please
[43:12] get a chance to listen make that up make
[43:14] that a priority put God's word above
[43:16] work family anything put God's Word and
[43:19] watch of God don't bless you
[43:21] program says put God first he said pay
[43:24] your tithe first
[43:25] he said above all put the house of God
[43:28] about everything else in your life
[43:29] I've preached on that couple years ago
[43:31] you know you want the quote I'm kidding
[43:32] I can click it in seventy in two clicks
[43:34] by God's grace if you want those quotes
[43:38] because we're going to get as much out
[43:40] of the holy spirit as we put into this
[43:42] let me understand that you have to
[43:44] invest in it if you invest in you'll get
[43:47] something up remember Galatians 6 said
[43:49] if you sow to the flesh so if you invest
[43:51] in your flesh you're gonna reap to the
[43:53] flesh but if you invest in the holy
[43:54] spirit you're going to reap in the Holy
[43:56] Spirit Lord why not have it enough
[43:59] reaping of the Spirit will have you
[44:00] invested in lately how come my crop the
[44:03] Holy Spirit is not coming up well have
[44:06] you planted there have you eat at the
[44:07] garden lately right
[44:10] so we want to we want to remember that
[44:13] and now the reason I often preach on
[44:16] church attendance and support in church
[44:17] is because of the prophecy of Joel toups
[44:20] let's turn in your Bible Joel 2:23 I'll
[44:23] put up here on Maya
[44:24] computer junk doctor my bug laughter
[44:30] Joel 2:23 brother Brad said this is thus
[44:33] saith the Lord
[44:34] Joel chapter 2 23 for the bride thus
[44:37] saith the Lord
[44:38] so the in other words this is the
[44:39] direction we're going and that's why
[44:42] Vernon's me as a pastor when I know what
[44:44] brother Bram said about the state the
[44:45] Lord and people aren't all again my joy
[44:47] and burdens me I've got I've got a
[44:50] responsibility to warn the people I
[44:51] understand that I want to preach I'm not
[44:53] going up up and study on that warnings
[44:55] and the watch straight from the
[44:57] watchtower from Ezekiel Oh Matt
[44:59] hallelujah brother have said this is
[45:02] thus saith the Lord to the bride be glad
[45:04] that insures I rejoices the Lord your
[45:06] God
[45:06] we're supposed to be glad and rejoice in
[45:08] God he free have given you the former
[45:11] right modely that's the ministry for the
[45:12] brand of teaching ministry and he will
[45:14] cause to come down for you the rain the
[45:16] former rain and the latter in the first
[45:18] month so it's fall dated in the latter
[45:21] ad tells us his raptured thing so we're
[45:24] going to be receiving the former rain
[45:25] the teaching a program through the Bible
[45:27] we're receiving that the anointing of
[45:29] lessons of that but one day the latter
[45:31] rain is going to start phone that's
[45:33] going to be rapture afraid to get the
[45:34] bride ready exactly and here and the for
[45:40] show be full of wheat what does we do it
[45:42] makes you read which is the word which
[45:45] is the food of God amen and the bat
[45:48] shall overflow with light and oil so see
[45:51] the church is supposed to have this
[45:52] we're supposed to have a house that's
[45:54] filled with oil and why and wheat I
[45:56] understand that man so people don't want
[45:59] to come to the house of God how the word
[46:00] you going to make a rapture when it's
[46:02] tough state the Lord we got to have
[46:03] plenty of we D plenty of wine plenty of
[46:06] oil plenty of simulation we got to be
[46:08] glad we got to rejoice that's the
[46:10] prophecy that's the vision for the
[46:12] church you'll never understand that
[46:14] that's thus saith the Lord for the RAM
[46:16] toes so if we're not in love with the
[46:18] Church of the Word of God
[46:19] something's wrong with us we're not
[46:22] walking in step we're not walking in a
[46:23] prophecy that the Prophet gave us you
[46:26] can say all day long
[46:27] guess I'll be alone I believe my dad was
[46:29] a prophet I believe every word he said
[46:31] Oh superb Oh Benson a man tornament I
[46:33] believe every word you say brother
[46:34] Mannis knew he was lying my vision and
[46:36] program said see that's a spirit a
[46:38] spirit gets on something I believe all
[46:40] the messenger I believe this and if
[46:42] their life does it all line with that
[46:44] obedience they don't believe it they're
[46:46] just a professor and not a possessor
[46:49] exactly right and here are the next two
[46:54] verses and I'll restore to you the years
[46:56] of the locust has eaten see all these in
[46:58] years these denominational and
[47:00] Antichrist spirits and either way God's
[47:01] going to restore God's going to restore
[47:04] the love that they had on the day of
[47:07] Pentecost for the man God is going to
[47:08] restore that to us I'll just it's the
[47:11] save the Lord brother Graham said might
[47:13] a great army which I sent him on you
[47:15] numbers 2016 he shouting him plenty
[47:17] who's this more of the bride what Aram
[47:19] said this is for the bride they'll say
[47:20] the Lord you shall eat in plenty strap
[47:22] plenty of food to eat we're going to be
[47:24] satisfied and praise the name of the
[47:26] Lord your God that I've dealt wonders
[47:28] with you of my people should never be
[47:30] ashamed
[47:31] that's the save the Lord how we can see
[47:33] that by God's grace so when I see people
[47:36] you know their characters lacking or if
[47:38] their desire is not lacking for the
[47:40] things of God what if what should i do
[47:42] what should you do we should reach out
[47:44] love and try to encourage people and
[47:46] pray for that right the Bible said let
[47:50] the strong encourage the weak that's the
[47:53] scripture first Thessalonians chapter 5
[47:55] so this is a vision without a vision
[47:57] you're going to perish do the opposite
[47:59] without a vision the people perish
[48:00] vision means prophecy well here's the
[48:03] prophecy the bride is supposed to walk
[48:04] into without this you're going to perish
[48:07] it's exactly right you must have the
[48:09] vision Lord you're going to restore Lord
[48:12] we're going to eat we're eating in
[48:13] plenty we're enjoying a former rain I'm
[48:14] enjoying the rain showers of the
[48:17] teachings from the Bible that God sent
[48:19] through His Prophet
[48:20] I rather enjoyed that arranged of our
[48:23] main man events that rain that shower
[48:26] we'd say the showering blessings of the
[48:28] Holy Spirit and this is what I preached
[48:30] last Sunday in Lima I preached for to
[48:32] enact two hours people were just pulling
[48:34] I lost my voice is you probably to that
[48:36] I never get back into any more is I'm so
[48:38] busy everything preaching talking
[48:40] teaching all the time at the end of the
[48:43] service for the young a couple people
[48:44] come up
[48:45] I went over to pray over the young man a
[48:47] 14 year old man he's confessing his sins
[48:49] and just prayed for him at different
[48:51] sins I told him gave him counsel and
[48:53] he's shaking in crime he's raising his
[48:55] hands as he's getting the victory pray
[48:57] for my 10 or 15 minutes hey finally
[48:59] broke through he's finally able to raise
[49:01] his hands and rejoice he's got tears and
[49:03] we're both shaking and crying as soon as
[49:06] he did that a sister let out a scream
[49:07] praising God and after I got no brain
[49:10] with him some of the vegan shoulders
[49:12] there go Jessica
[49:13] sister on a prayer so I walked over and
[49:15] said sister Deanie prayer she said God
[49:18] already healed me while you were praying
[49:19] for that man the same time God was
[49:22] dealing with that man giving him victory
[49:25] the Holy Spirit held that man - how did
[49:27] it even the power of the Holy Spirit
[49:28] amen my dad said if you don't all line
[49:31] with it we'll move on to somebody else
[49:32] but I'm going to say this pass me down
[49:35] oh gentle Savior hear my humble cry
[49:37] while others are calling don't pass me
[49:39] by touch me today bless me today because
[49:44] we're in a time where as this is where
[49:46] we're getting to venture out into the
[49:47] service love of the people is going to
[49:50] wax old the love is going to decrease
[49:54] the foolish virgins love is going to get
[49:56] less and less the world's love for God
[49:58] is going to be less less but ours should
[50:01] increase understand men we should have
[50:04] plenty of love plenty of word plenty of
[50:07] widen oil we should have plenty of it
[50:11] our lives should be full of love and
[50:14] full of inspiration full of the Holy
[50:16] Spirit you believe that that's what your
[50:19] prophet said thus saith the Lord that's
[50:20] what my prophet said so see that's why
[50:22] I'm trying to walk in line with that I
[50:24] want a long walk in line with that I
[50:26] hope you do by the grace of the Lord
[50:28] about such a burden you know when I see
[50:29] these things how can you be walking the
[50:32] vision and not coming to church or not
[50:34] read your Bible or any like got to and
[50:36] the Bible says the bride is going to do
[50:38] that she's going to fall more in love
[50:39] should have more victory should have
[50:41] more joy more enjoy the word more enjoy
[50:44] that's prophecy and want to fall under
[50:46] the spirit of the prophecy that's my
[50:49] little sermon out before the sermon okay
[50:51] so pardon me all right we're in the
[50:53] church ages we're at this age right here
[50:55] the poor church age Thyatira
[50:57] we preach quite a few sermons on these
[50:58] by God's grace and quite a few leading
[51:01] up to them but here where this church
[51:02] age
[51:04] the longest church age 914 years by
[51:09] God's grace now remember each church age
[51:11] had to deal with the satanic power of
[51:14] the Antichrist so God had to send the
[51:16] light anointing to combat the innocent
[51:19] deception of those first years there
[51:21] where the white horse rider was writing
[51:22] when transcend the Satan jumped off his
[51:24] white horse and got on the bloody red
[51:26] when he United powers in the Church of
[51:28] state around three hundred fifty eighty
[51:31] something like that and then he rode for
[51:33] a long time until the Dark Ages and then
[51:35] they started to charging for forgiveness
[51:38] in the Catholic Church started doing
[51:40] novenas and all these things and
[51:41] indulgences and all these things and
[51:43] they captured the wealth of the world
[51:46] and they wrote that black horse rider
[51:49] wrote for quite a long time and now
[51:52] spiritual death is riding understand
[51:54] that spiritual death is riding where
[51:56] people can say they love God but their
[51:58] spiritual debt they can go to church but
[52:01] they're dead while they're alive
[52:02] it's exactly right but thank God we got
[52:05] to fly eagle anointing in the South amen
[52:07] to fly above all those things less or to
[52:10] savage cause I'm gonna dig with my wife
[52:11] grab the part you know walk around how
[52:14] many bows leave a day divided even after
[52:15] you America believe that you have to I
[52:17] still have the most post last night I
[52:20] was on my walk with my wife on a day two
[52:22] Saturdays ago we're just at the Silver
[52:24] Lake Creek II know it's beautiful little
[52:27] uh what you called hard there here sorry
[52:31] in the Norton and I'm just looking
[52:34] around you know were just leaning around
[52:35] watching the beauty of nature all of a
[52:37] sudden I saw eagle swooped down from the
[52:38] heavens he's got this big white head
[52:40] he's kind of hovering there he's
[52:41] probably 20 feet above the water and all
[52:44] of a sudden he just puts his head down
[52:47] and dives right in for the lay down my
[52:49] life in the world he died about how you
[52:51] don't see him for a second and all of a
[52:53] sudden he comes up off the water you got
[52:54] a big old fish in his hand it was
[52:56] awesome and then today he started flying
[52:58] around the lake and pretty soon he just
[53:00] stopped his wings and the the wind
[53:02] currents he caught the wind currents
[53:04] like a whirlwind almost hey
[53:07] going higher and higher and higher and
[53:10] he just got pwned on that fish and I
[53:12] thought my he just had to flap a few
[53:15] times and just like mother Graham said
[53:16] when he see those Eagles they would fly
[53:18] and pretty soon my wife and I watched
[53:20] him and pretty soon we could even see
[53:21] him anymore I thought what a picture of
[53:23] a real child of God jesus said where the
[53:26] carcass is the Eagles would be gathered
[53:28] the eagle knows how to fight its food we
[53:31] know how to find our food in the Word of
[53:33] God we dropped out from the heavenlies
[53:36] to get some food and we let the Holy
[53:38] Spirit to strengthen us to rise above
[53:41] the things of the world so high at the
[53:43] world people on the ground can't even
[53:45] see us because we're in such heavenly
[53:47] places they met and what do we got we
[53:49] got the food of God in our claws a men
[53:52] and with that we'll feed ourselves and
[53:54] our families hallelujah we just make a
[53:56] quick trip down get the food that we
[53:58] need that we saw back up to the
[54:00] heavenlies I mean love the Lord Amen
[54:02] praise God and cap it off yet a guy
[54:04] visit our Bible club at school on Sunday
[54:06] Friday after school and he taught on
[54:08] Eagles I thought Lord you're trying to
[54:10] tell me something
[54:11] to be a flying eagle he said he has an
[54:13] eagle nest four miles from his house
[54:14] here in Ohio that's all he does is take
[54:16] pictures I said you got to come to my
[54:18] class and teach a science lesson on
[54:20] eagles he can be a guest in my class I'm
[54:24] sure I sure want to do that Church I
[54:26] shown to be a flying eagle amen how many
[54:29] would say Lord read reading my strengths
[54:30] like an eagle and these guys sometimes
[54:33] they're really strong sometimes Eagles
[54:34] got to have their strength renewed amen
[54:36] now remember these revelations in the
[54:39] seals and the church ages are the state
[54:41] the Lord I'm not going to go through
[54:43] this within the 7th seal he says this
[54:44] the church age is busted history it's
[54:47] the state the Lord
[54:48] so we're out dealing with some of these
[54:49] ideas these are the revelations God one
[54:52] in its proper to give us amen there's
[54:55] the course for church ages now remember
[54:58] I'm we're looking here at Columbus
[54:59] Church age we went through Colombo last
[55:00] time now 30 Wednesdays ago and I want
[55:04] you to understand this
[55:05] it--it era was the darkest age our age
[55:09] is not the darkest age never understand
[55:11] that our age is the most deceptive age
[55:15] program I have hopes to show I'm not
[55:17] making this up I'm not I'm just telling
[55:19] what the prophets
[55:20] there's less something can see there's
[55:21] less light entirety or than Lucia
[55:23] because of the evening time did shall be
[55:26] light this was the darkest time for the
[55:30] random set because of persecution but
[55:34] the hardest thing about today it's more
[55:36] deceptive even than it was then
[55:38] it's dark for persecution but here it's
[55:41] evil because of deception so that's what
[55:46] the quotes tell us higher-tier was the
[55:48] darkest age but our age is the most
[55:49] deceptive age so you and I have to worry
[55:52] so much about persecution although
[55:54] Christians do different countries and we
[55:57] know there's a coming persecution
[55:58] milligram says some say to the Lord the
[56:00] same persecution on pagan Rome is coming
[56:02] to 96 he says that state the look it's
[56:04] come we know that but right now it's not
[56:08] and it won't be here when the bride's
[56:10] here I don't understand that God will
[56:12] not let his bride you persecuted what
[56:14] man whatever that is might be persecuted
[56:16] you wouldn't do that he protect her so
[56:20] brother it says in Messiah the church
[56:22] age has been through the darkest age it
[56:24] went through the dark ages the church
[56:28] age book we'll get to this in love it I
[56:30] know thy works the last thing more than
[56:31] first now as we've already stated this
[56:33] age is called the dark ages because it
[56:36] was indeed the darkest period of all
[56:38] history
[56:40] see this is darker it was darker than
[56:42] later cm y Bo Jess well he does us it
[56:45] was the age of hope is to the third who
[56:47] claimed that he was the Vicar of Christ
[56:49] supreme sovereign over the church in the
[56:51] world who instituted the Inquisition
[56:54] which under his direction shed more
[56:57] blood than any other time except in the
[56:59] Reformation so what dark means is dark
[57:03] persecution death physical death okay
[57:07] but then if I'm going to tell something
[57:09] out of the île age he said last week of
[57:11] Matthew 24 it was the most deceiving of
[57:14] all ages so fire tear was the darkest
[57:17] age of persecution but our age is the
[57:20] most deception there was in that all the
[57:24] ages of the seed from the garden being
[57:26] all the way down there's never been an
[57:28] age so deceptive as this age so it
[57:33] wasn't as
[57:33] the days of Columba and Thyatira because
[57:37] the real believers knew of their the
[57:39] Roman Catholic Church is perverted you
[57:41] know they're they're killing people you
[57:42] know they got Inquisition on their there
[57:44] wasn't much deception but program tells
[57:47] us now the deception is people will go
[57:50] to church and think of their Christians
[57:52] when they're not and think they're
[57:55] worshipping God when they're actually
[57:56] worshipping Satan but madam said that's
[57:59] more deception today such I pray God
[58:03] take any scales from eyes hoping to see
[58:05] my spiritual condition perfectly so I
[58:07] know exactly where I stand with me don't
[58:10] let me be to see let me look at the word
[58:12] romance at IU how can you ever know that
[58:14] you're doing the will of God and look at
[58:16] the word and do it glory do the Word of
[58:20] God hallelujah were the most deceptive
[58:23] age there ever was
[58:25] this seems people well people to believe
[58:27] they they believe they they believe the
[58:30] message they believe they're follow the
[58:31] message what they're not praise God they
[58:35] believe that God sent a prophet so they
[58:36] say but they don't listen to the Prophet
[58:39] that's right this is the age we're
[58:41] talking about an age of deception praise
[58:43] God remember that was one of them that
[58:46] was one of the Christ the Holy Spirit
[58:48] and the latest in church aid remember as
[58:51] many as I love I rebuke and chasten if
[58:55] he loves you he'll correct you I
[58:56] understand that a man if a pastor loves
[58:59] you a brand new word to correct you
[59:01] I know it's hard because I need
[59:03] correction to many times I know it's
[59:05] hard but if somebody actually loves you
[59:07] they'll try to correct you remember a
[59:08] proverb says if you rebuke a wise man
[59:10] you love you remember that that's
[59:12] ternary but I want to read it I think
[59:14] I'm going to hold up you're up a few
[59:15] clips
[59:16] I think it's reviewed a wise man I think
[59:23] I lived up a few weeks ago yeah there's
[59:26] gory
[59:27] yeah even highlight it okay Gloria
[59:29] rotters 98 rebuke not ask order less he
[59:33] hate the rebuke a wise man and you love
[59:36] thee give instruction to a wise man
[59:39] about God's a wise virgin kind insert
[59:42] that in there
[59:42] ah a wise version filth only goes give
[59:46] instructions to a wise virgin and he or
[59:49] she will be yet wiser teach a just man
[59:53] no increase in learning anyone that
[59:56] doesn't want to be corrected has
[59:58] officially backslidden right amen
[1:00:02] and if not it doesn't correct that
[1:00:05] situation will be at most a foolish
[1:00:07] version but a live version can be
[1:00:10] corrected and will love you for
[1:00:12] correcting them praise God don't forget
[1:00:18] that church if you're the Lord is the
[1:00:20] beginning of wisdom and now to the whole
[1:00:21] youth understanding we live in an age
[1:00:23] where zone wants to be corrected right
[1:00:26] what's the time they don't to be
[1:00:27] corrected
[1:00:27] just tell me good things just tickle my
[1:00:30] ears as Paul told Timothy that's what
[1:00:32] they would say just tickle my ears you
[1:00:33] know but don't correct me but if you
[1:00:36] correct somebody with wrote godly love
[1:00:37] they'll receive it because they know you
[1:00:38] love them it's exactly right hard to
[1:00:42] find that all right now just so you know
[1:00:45] there's fire to your the for church Jake
[1:00:47] that's making that pyramid looks like
[1:00:49] looks like that cloud picture like I
[1:00:51] said I brother Brandon saw the cloud of
[1:00:52] Jesus it sure looks like that looks like
[1:00:55] a little lick of fire there you know I
[1:00:56] don't know it's interesting now we did
[1:01:00] the salutation a couple weeks ago or do
[1:01:01] the eulogy this morning by the grace of
[1:01:04] the Lord verse 19 I know that works so
[1:01:10] see the introduction the citation was
[1:01:11] verse 18 we preach on that verse 19 I
[1:01:14] know that it works and love and service
[1:01:16] and faith in our nations and their works
[1:01:18] and the last to be more than the first
[1:01:21] here we get by the same introductory
[1:01:23] marks I know thy works the son of God
[1:01:28] Himself said believe me for the very
[1:01:30] works sake he put an emphasis on his own
[1:01:32] works while on earth the works that he
[1:01:35] did were aimed of God to inspire faith
[1:01:37] in him it was the great part of his
[1:01:39] ministry amen
[1:01:42] His Holy Spirit in the Apostle Paul said
[1:01:46] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:01:50] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[1:01:54] hath ordained that
[1:01:55] should walk in them and we know this but
[1:01:59] let me say it again
[1:02:00] God has something good for you to do how
[1:02:04] many can say men to that you're not
[1:02:06] supposed to just come to church or for
[1:02:08] those that sit at home you're not
[1:02:09] supposed to sit at home and do nothing
[1:02:10] you're supposed to have a work that God
[1:02:13] has called you to the administered he
[1:02:17] said if you're a farmer he said then
[1:02:19] you'd be the best godly farmer you can
[1:02:20] do got work to do
[1:02:21] your father be the best father mother be
[1:02:23] the best mother housewife whatever you
[1:02:25] are be the best that you can for Christ
[1:02:27] amen you have a work you have to do how
[1:02:31] do you want to do the works of God you
[1:02:34] only do that by the Holy Spirit because
[1:02:36] the fruit of the Spirit are the works of
[1:02:38] the Spirit praise God amen these works
[1:02:42] were to inspire faith in him as they
[1:02:44] would show for that relationship to him
[1:02:47] that Paul describes has created in him
[1:02:51] amen now rotate of balances out works in
[1:02:55] faith here as you know if you've ever
[1:02:57] listened to works as faith Express I
[1:02:58] preached a whole circle serie of sermons
[1:03:00] on that sermon from 1965 but let's go
[1:03:03] over to get works will never take the
[1:03:05] place of faith in God for our salvation
[1:03:07] but works will show forth our faith
[1:03:12] already placed in him good works won't
[1:03:16] save you but they will come forth out of
[1:03:18] a save life as fruit unto the Lord I
[1:03:21] believe in good words even if a man is
[1:03:24] not saved you ought to do good works and
[1:03:26] do the best he can but it's horrible the
[1:03:28] side of God is fermented and evil works
[1:03:30] and then say they're doing the will of
[1:03:32] God that is what the bishops and Pope's
[1:03:34] of hierarchy of Rome are doing they were
[1:03:36] killing maiming and doing all manner of
[1:03:38] evil in the name of the Lord right they
[1:03:44] lived out lives now he's talking about
[1:03:47] these priests and Cardinals they're
[1:03:48] posed during the times here in church
[1:03:52] age they lived out their lives exactly
[1:03:55] opposite to what the word teaches and
[1:03:58] that evil day goes shoe believers shone
[1:04:02] like a light in a dark place as they
[1:04:04] continually did good for they returned
[1:04:09] cursing
[1:04:10] with blessing and did the true to under
[1:04:13] God even though many died for it
[1:04:16] they met in this verse which is verse 19
[1:04:21] he is commanding his children because
[1:04:23] they were living changed lives amen
[1:04:26] their works testified to a new spirit
[1:04:29] within men saw their good works and
[1:04:32] glorify God yes sir if you are Christian
[1:04:36] you are going to do what is right your
[1:04:40] works will show that your heart is right
[1:04:43] and it won't be something that you put
[1:04:46] on for you will do his will like this
[1:04:49] even when no one but God sees you and
[1:04:52] you'll do it feel even if it costs you
[1:04:54] your life a man hey man that's why we
[1:04:58] have to be careful what are we doing in
[1:05:00] our free time when no one else is around
[1:05:02] that's when you'll see the real Jesse or
[1:05:06] the real vain or the real brother sister
[1:05:08] saw it so when those around because at
[1:05:12] that time either you recognize God's
[1:05:14] presence or you'll forget God's presence
[1:05:16] and what man said you won't do things
[1:05:17] that you might do it when you're in
[1:05:19] God's presence so the thing to do is
[1:05:22] recognize God's presence status presence
[1:05:25] and even do what just through the right
[1:05:28] things of God no matter who's around
[1:05:29] when you're in secret praise God
[1:05:32] jesus said thine alms shall be in secret
[1:05:35] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:05:37] himself shall reward thee openly Jesus
[1:05:42] sees you while you're driving the word
[1:05:43] all by yourself he sees you praise God
[1:05:46] he sees you on your note the restroom
[1:05:48] you don't brushing your teeth or doing
[1:05:49] your hair good morning when you're all
[1:05:50] by yourself he sees what you're doing
[1:05:53] free sky and here he sees it forgiving
[1:05:56] to the people that are less fortunate
[1:05:56] than us are we giving to them he sees
[1:05:59] what's done in secret went out Brandis
[1:06:03] not shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[1:06:04] if they love to pray standing the
[1:06:05] synagogues and the corners of the
[1:06:07] streets that they may be seen a men
[1:06:09] verily I say to you they have their
[1:06:11] reward but thou when thou prayest enter
[1:06:14] into thy closet and when thou is shut
[1:06:17] the door pray to the Father which is and
[1:06:19] see
[1:06:19] at the father which seeth in secret
[1:06:21] shall reward the open in men and this is
[1:06:25] what we're talking about
[1:06:26] this is planting to the holy spirit when
[1:06:29] you go in the closet it's like going
[1:06:31] into your field and planting a you'll
[1:06:33] great potato eyes you know you know or
[1:06:36] you know we'd say scattering the lettuce
[1:06:38] seat you know or whatever plant you late
[1:06:40] never venture you like it's like
[1:06:42] planting in there and then God will
[1:06:44] reward you openly what stunning seeker
[1:06:47] will be mad at us on the open you'll be
[1:06:49] able to take from that prayer closet or
[1:06:51] take from those kidding and you'll be
[1:06:53] able to produce fruit of the Spirit and
[1:06:54] then give that to other people praise
[1:06:56] God they'll see your fruit in your life
[1:06:58] but see it must be done in secret it
[1:07:01] must be planted in secret God sees our
[1:07:04] secret lives how many grateful for that
[1:07:05] Amen I'm great please there if I make a
[1:07:08] mistake in secret he's there to correct
[1:07:10] me
[1:07:10] amen he's there to put it back to the
[1:07:14] faith he's there to point me back to
[1:07:16] repentance he said I pointed back to
[1:07:18] obedience man because he sees me in
[1:07:20] secret praise God if you're sincere
[1:07:24] those are the best times you have in the
[1:07:25] Lord which is you in the Lord you and
[1:07:28] the Lord is worse than Jesus knowing
[1:07:30] that no one's watching you're not going
[1:07:32] to get any reward for this other than
[1:07:33] more of his love and that's the only
[1:07:36] reward we once more Christ under the
[1:07:39] brakes God remember without as it is I
[1:07:43] know your love service faith and
[1:07:44] patience so now he's going to comment on
[1:07:46] that portion of the scripture you will
[1:07:50] know that their love is placed between
[1:07:52] works and service and that is the right
[1:07:56] place for it because without love our
[1:08:00] works are not accepted before God and
[1:08:02] neither is our service how many can say
[1:08:05] amen to that man I make say lord help me
[1:08:07] to do works with love in my heart help
[1:08:09] you to serve you with love in my heart
[1:08:11] help me not get just give because I know
[1:08:13] the Bible says it but help me to get
[1:08:15] with a loving heart amen
[1:08:17] help me to go to church with love hey
[1:08:20] help me to not do to the service just
[1:08:22] because I have to I know it's the Word
[1:08:24] of God but because I'd love to do it see
[1:08:27] love needs to be right in between your
[1:08:28] works and your service needs to be your
[1:08:31] very heart which is of course your soul
[1:08:33] is the baptism all the ghosts in your
[1:08:34] soul the very core of your being needs
[1:08:37] to be filled with God's love Laurie
[1:08:41] Paul speaking the Corinthians that
[1:08:43] without love I had nothing in whatever I
[1:08:45] do is without profit unless it's done in
[1:08:47] love now you can see right here that
[1:08:50] these believers weren't in that Nicolaes
[1:08:53] in class that it works as a means of
[1:08:56] salvation or to be or to be admired by
[1:08:59] men they did their works out of the love
[1:09:02] of God that was shut up from their
[1:09:04] hearts by the holy days ahead see you
[1:09:08] gotta gotta be born again if you're born
[1:09:10] again the Bible said the love of God is
[1:09:11] shed in your heart and then when it's in
[1:09:13] your heart you want to floss other
[1:09:14] people praise God and that's why you the
[1:09:18] works that you do that's why you serve
[1:09:19] the way you do it's because of God's
[1:09:21] love in your heart amen
[1:09:25] that love in their hearts was God's love
[1:09:28] for his own jesus said by this shall all
[1:09:32] men know that you're my disciples that
[1:09:34] you have love one for another
[1:09:35] the pagans who saw the lives of the
[1:09:38] early Christians that behold how they
[1:09:40] loved each other
[1:09:42] John said every one that loveth is born
[1:09:45] of God amen do you think you think your
[1:09:49] family says it about you MA
[1:09:50] they must really love that church cuz
[1:09:52] they'll go to church and nose skip our
[1:09:54] family party or something like that
[1:09:55] amen on the video I'm going to tell my
[1:10:01] mom that like a Mother's Day mama I love
[1:10:02] you so much but God taught me to be a
[1:10:04] pastor I can't come see on Mother's Day
[1:10:06] and you know what she's fine with that
[1:10:08] because she raised me to love God the
[1:10:10] manner she raised me to love God more
[1:10:12] than I love anything else so no doubt it
[1:10:15] hurts us a little bit on holidays don't
[1:10:17] even see my mom or my dad or things like
[1:10:19] that
[1:10:19] one thing I'd get to do is I get to do
[1:10:21] God's will and I get above God more in a
[1:10:24] head hey man you see that people are
[1:10:26] look at your life and say ma you must
[1:10:28] really love that church because you put
[1:10:31] God's Word but you put those people to
[1:10:32] church above everybody else hey dad
[1:10:35] we're going to say that by God's grace
[1:10:39] everyone that loves is born of God if
[1:10:43] you can't find something love out
[1:10:44] somebody you got to pray a little more
[1:10:45] and spend more
[1:10:46] that person you'll find something to
[1:10:48] love about every person that's exactly
[1:10:50] right
[1:10:52] Laurie look everywhere everybody ready
[1:10:56] for a warning for brother Brad everybody
[1:10:57] ready awarding I want to give a warrant
[1:11:02] right here for the RAM stops in the
[1:11:04] midst of the church age and gives a
[1:11:05] warning
[1:11:05] it says concerning the last days that
[1:11:09] because of the abounding of iniquity the
[1:11:12] love of many will wax cold programs
[1:11:16] giving us a warning this is for the last
[1:11:18] days remember Matthew 24 says I'll bring
[1:11:21] up in just a minute
[1:11:22] jesus said iniquity but which is sin
[1:11:26] that people do and they often already
[1:11:28] know they shouldn't do it understand
[1:11:31] that iniquity - sin that you know you
[1:11:34] should do but you do it anyway because
[1:11:36] of iniquity so that can only apply to
[1:11:38] pride members are inserted that
[1:11:40] brightener definitely find people that
[1:11:41] have heard the message that's what I
[1:11:42] mean this is the message of the hour
[1:11:45] because of iniquity the love of many
[1:11:48] shall wax cold so it's people that have
[1:11:54] heard the message is people that have
[1:11:55] heard the truth of the Bible but they
[1:11:57] choose if you roam anyway and it's
[1:11:59] because of that iniquity their love for
[1:12:02] God and their love for people dies down
[1:12:06] but we have said in the later scene or
[1:12:08] last age self-love this is the age of
[1:12:11] selfies right and love for material
[1:12:14] things will take the place of the true
[1:12:16] love of God look at that self love love
[1:12:20] for material things that's a warning
[1:12:22] don't love yourself and don't love
[1:12:25] things more than you love other people
[1:12:27] if you do you have fulfilled the wrong
[1:12:31] scripture you don't want to fulfill that
[1:12:33] scripture you don't want your love
[1:12:34] waxing away 9 you want it growing it and
[1:12:39] you want your love for our brothers and
[1:12:41] sisters here you want it to grow and how
[1:12:43] we see your love by your service one for
[1:12:46] another how you serve each other how you
[1:12:48] treat each other it's exactly right we
[1:12:52] need to guard against the power of sin
[1:12:55] these last days so many how many can sit
[1:12:58] under that
[1:12:58] I can say my that so many are getting so
[1:13:01] hard instead of more loving they're
[1:13:04] getting more hard less levy they don't
[1:13:08] hug you like they used to they don't
[1:13:11] fellowship with you like the Heathcliff
[1:13:12] the church said anything I don't get
[1:13:15] down into your business but this one by
[1:13:16] the RAM said you said you believe God
[1:13:17] sent a prophet you want to pastor to
[1:13:20] preach the message and this is the
[1:13:22] message a church we all need it we're
[1:13:26] all the latest in church age we just
[1:13:28] ought to tighten up on the buckle of
[1:13:30] truth and live the truth ain't that a
[1:13:31] minute I kept it up the buckle the armor
[1:13:33] get the sword out polish off the shield
[1:13:35] and be a real Christian soldiering that
[1:13:37] in men hallelujah people are getting so
[1:13:42] hard instead of instead of getting it
[1:13:44] hot for Christ to fold up they're
[1:13:46] getting icy cold towards love for other
[1:13:48] people all they think about is
[1:13:50] themselves it's exactly right instead of
[1:13:55] serving others instead of helping out
[1:13:57] the guy that needs something they'll
[1:13:58] help out themselves praise the Lord
[1:14:02] instead of helping out supporting the
[1:14:04] church they'll help out themselves
[1:14:06] understand what we're talking about it's
[1:14:09] all about them it's all about me it's
[1:14:12] about us
[1:14:13] they love material things and themselves
[1:14:15] more they love God that is the warning
[1:14:19] that we need for this hour we should
[1:14:22] chew on that for a few minutes
[1:14:23] praise the Lord I will I think I would
[1:14:25] amen so hard because they hadn't
[1:14:28] realized the effect of this last day
[1:14:30] spirit it's time to draw back to God see
[1:14:34] why I ask people to come to church early
[1:14:35] and pray you see why I say this because
[1:14:37] brother Branham said we have to draw not
[1:14:39] the Bible says for all night and people
[1:14:41] say they believe in rhythm but don't do
[1:14:43] what he says amen they don't do it they
[1:14:47] do some of it but not all of it but the
[1:14:49] bride does all the Word of God a man
[1:14:50] she's a full word bride amen everybody
[1:14:53] thought Judas was in the word all the
[1:14:54] way but at the enemy show he wasn't but
[1:14:57] we've got to show everybody that we are
[1:14:58] as a run all the way all the way through
[1:15:00] amen amen glory Judas tricked everybody
[1:15:05] because he had such a false
[1:15:06] sanctification it looked like he was in
[1:15:09] the word but he wasn't in the word all
[1:15:11] the way
[1:15:11] at the end of the journey is shown what
[1:15:13] side he was off see instead of getting
[1:15:18] hard towards others we should get more
[1:15:19] loving towards others exactly right
[1:15:22] Church he's trying to draw nigh to God
[1:15:25] and let him fill our lives of his love
[1:15:28] or we will feel the coldness of the last
[1:15:30] day Church and reject the truth of God
[1:15:35] which alone is able to help us amen so
[1:15:42] what do you feel when you go here you
[1:15:43] feel love or do you feel cold well you
[1:15:46] ought to feel love praise God
[1:15:48] amen you ought to feel love you
[1:15:50] shouldn't feel cold and if you feel cold
[1:15:52] autumn and said go to the person who's
[1:15:54] cold towards you and talk about how many
[1:15:58] know he said that well Graham said I
[1:16:01] have never have any feel any odd feeling
[1:16:03] toward anybody so go talk to them about
[1:16:05] it so ultimately it falls back not on
[1:16:08] somebody else it falls back on each one
[1:16:10] of us how many can say Amen Milgram said
[1:16:16] I free something wrong he said come to
[1:16:18] me in a private meeting straight and
[1:16:20] straighten me out on that and I said the
[1:16:22] same thing
[1:16:22] nobody's come to straighten me out on it
[1:16:24] so I must be preaching the truth or
[1:16:26] people are scared to tell me the truth
[1:16:28] just tell me the truth of overall I'll
[1:16:30] love you more for that right a wise man
[1:16:33] if we're wise men and women we should
[1:16:35] love somebody who's trying to correct us
[1:16:37] not hate that we should love them grace
[1:16:40] of God praise the Lord I like that
[1:16:45] I just want to dwell on that I think I
[1:16:47] got some scriptures at the end I'm
[1:16:48] almost done here let me see his most got
[1:16:50] a few more but so I want to preach

[1:17:03] great series tonight in the prophecy on
[1:17:05] the last to Gentile power sometimes the
[1:17:09] Gentiles and there's hope there about
[1:17:11] the Antichrist to come so if you're

[1:17:14] you'll tune in that or and be here by
[1:17:16] God's grace amen
[1:17:18] I know your service jesus said he
[1:17:23] that is the greatest of all is servant
[1:17:26] to all who served more than anybody else
[1:17:30] in this age brother grant how many could
[1:17:32] say Monday nobody can have a higher
[1:17:35] revelation at him nobody can have a
[1:17:37] greater reward in it because he's a star
[1:17:39] in Christ's own right hand let me get my
[1:17:41] hands right this is this
[1:17:43] he is a literal star that means he shied
[1:17:46] him brighter than a lot better than me
[1:17:47] and he's not a guy humming himself he's
[1:17:50] not just one little tub of abuse Oh God
[1:17:52] how we should help ourselves I'm the
[1:17:55] most of the pastor Doug if he's a what
[1:17:58] could I be if he's if he's a little
[1:18:00] started I went in the smallest grains
[1:18:01] broken off the stone a smallest one so
[1:18:05] who served more than all for the rent
[1:18:07] where where was mother grave on Sunday
[1:18:08] in the house of God right where is he
[1:18:12] where he give his life to mother and
[1:18:14] said if I need about chores tomorrow
[1:18:15] 2:00 Monday he said I'd be preaching
[1:18:17] here on Sunday morning because this is
[1:18:18] my post of duty hard because they don't
[1:18:22] want it up there the ones that one it
[1:18:24] will be here because judgment begins at
[1:18:26] the house of God a man attacked erupted
[1:18:28] hey man I feel oh this morning got to
[1:18:32] serve me up amen that's exactly right
[1:18:35] a wise man confidence that this here's
[1:18:38] what he said only history proved the
[1:18:39] truth of that dictum that man was right
[1:18:42] all the truly great men of history had
[1:18:44] been service did you know George
[1:18:45] Washington anyone to be the general did
[1:18:48] you know he was planning on retiring
[1:18:49] instead of being about the general for
[1:18:51] the revolutionary or did you know that
[1:18:53] did you know he did not one of these
[1:18:55] present knighted States he had to choose
[1:18:57] to sacrifice those years of his life in
[1:18:59] order to serve that's history he just
[1:19:04] wanted to go back to his no Virginia
[1:19:05] home and just he just wonder it retire
[1:19:08] he already been serving here have been
[1:19:10] but the people needed a leader Omaha so
[1:19:14] he sacrificed another decade or so of
[1:19:17] his life and gave it to the people so
[1:19:19] they could have a leader and whose name
[1:19:21] is great today what's the capital our
[1:19:22] nation who do that who has these
[1:19:24] monuments its Washington Monument
[1:19:27] Washington his name is May because he
[1:19:30] was a servant to all and he was to get
[1:19:32] paid four hundred thousand a year like
[1:19:33] somebody's in the past presidents again
[1:19:35] speech favors $400,000 here just to be a
[1:19:39] speech after reading president I'm not
[1:19:41] you know bashing the individuals I'm
[1:19:42] just saying it's a less of money to them
[1:19:44] hey then yes they don't have the same
[1:19:47] character like Washington had a pen
[1:19:49] another of new and we can't change it at
[1:19:52] all we just got to bear with them pray
[1:19:53] for that that's all we can do but you
[1:19:56] know him and watt Lincoln and all those
[1:19:58] men Lincoln died to try to unite the
[1:20:00] army together or the nation did you know
[1:20:02] that you know that he died who are the
[1:20:04] greatest men of all those that serve
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:07] those that serve don't think about the
[1:20:09] body all these people that served think
[1:20:11] about our day brother branham people
[1:20:14] that serve that go out there lives could
[1:20:16] be easier but they purposely get in the
[1:20:18] service of God to do something for God
[1:20:20] and they give of themselves he that's
[1:20:22] greatest among you will be the servant
[1:20:24] in it exactly right how many want to
[1:20:28] serve others and that means you have to
[1:20:31] lose some of your own time and like I
[1:20:34] said it can be praying for the service
[1:20:35] at your house be praying here in the
[1:20:37] church before church it can be given and
[1:20:41] helping you know with money or open with
[1:20:42] your time and helping people out Oh your
[1:20:44] car broke down brother or sister oh
[1:20:46] maybe we help you out with Saturday
[1:20:47] maybe we come over help you out or
[1:20:48] something like that
[1:20:50] you see they who are great were the
[1:20:52] servants of all that's right they who
[1:20:57] demanded to be served they who oppressed
[1:20:59] they who sought to always get the head
[1:21:01] have gone down in shame even the very
[1:21:04] richer condemned by God with him not use
[1:21:06] their wealth right but look in the
[1:21:08] history he will find that the truly
[1:21:10] great ones were those who served others
[1:21:11] history could never claim those for whom
[1:21:14] lunch was done but it will forever
[1:21:16] praise those who did much for others
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:20] like that I wish had more time I wanted
[1:21:24] that more time to search out more men in
[1:21:25] history that God has honored but I think
[1:21:28] you understand those that serve the most
[1:21:31] those that serve others are the ones who
[1:21:33] God exalts because they humble
[1:21:35] themselves then God exalts them in due
[1:21:37] season so if everyone says let us apply
[1:21:41] that to ourselves that means let's learn
[1:21:44] from that help me to learn how to be a
[1:21:46] sir
[1:21:48] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:21:50] ministered but to minister so we are to
[1:21:53] follow that example see him as he vows
[1:21:55] himself over the feet of the Apostles
[1:21:56] and washes their tired and dirty feet he
[1:22:00] said you do not know what I'm doing but
[1:22:02] you will know hereafter but what you are
[1:22:05] seeing me do you ought to do also to
[1:22:07] others he became a servant in order that
[1:22:10] God could elevate it to the highest
[1:22:12] heights and one day in the judgment of
[1:22:14] the Saints we are to go I'm going to
[1:22:16] hear him say well done good and faithful
[1:22:18] servant Jesus said I know your service
[1:22:23] enter thou into the joy of the Lord is
[1:22:27] it easy to be a servant Church or is it
[1:22:30] hard it's hard it's hard to always be a
[1:22:35] servant other people but those who spend
[1:22:39] and are spent for others will one day be
[1:22:42] seated within this throne it'll be worth
[1:22:45] it all then praise the Lord those who
[1:22:51] are spend no look life's going to be
[1:22:53] hard either one way or other either
[1:22:55] going to get hard for iniquity or you
[1:22:58] have to have a hard time serving other
[1:23:00] people rest it with your flesh life is
[1:23:03] going to be hard Church said aren't you
[1:23:06] there get hard : God or you have to go
[1:23:08] the hard way and constantly serve and
[1:23:10] die out to other people
[1:23:12] I'll take the way with the Lords of
[1:23:13] spice in it I'd rather the hard life
[1:23:15] that way constantly served
[1:23:18] I am constantly sacrifice let me say
[1:23:22] this summer is coming up and if you want
[1:23:25] me to visit your house and fellowship
[1:23:27] this the time to might be over by God's
[1:23:28] grace I'm not going to bite by itself
[1:23:30] over but if you want if you once a mouse
[1:23:33] with me suffer some time I got to that
[1:23:34] months so we let me know I'll Drive any
[1:23:36] distance anybody the church I can do
[1:23:39] that by God's grace I just wanna make
[1:23:43] sure I say that so I don't forget you
[1:23:46] see we must love each other and serve
[1:23:48] each other by the grace of the Lord
[1:23:51] program quotes the song we just say
[1:23:53] let's labor for the master when the roll
[1:23:56] is called up yonder I'll be there
[1:23:58] and amen Jesus said I know your faith
[1:24:01] now he does not say here as he hitted
[1:24:03] the Church of Pergamos you hope my faith
[1:24:06] he's not talking about his faith now but
[1:24:08] he's committing them for their
[1:24:09] faithfulness and as he does he also
[1:24:12] mentions their patience now faithfulness
[1:24:15] that nations go together
[1:24:16] in fact patience of the outcome of
[1:24:18] faithfulness or says in James 1 3 the
[1:24:21] trying of your faith worketh patience
[1:24:26] now if you would go to Roman's 5 have
[1:24:29] you got your Bible there I guess I can
[1:24:30] go there for you about that there's a
[1:24:40] four-step process to really having godly
[1:24:42] hope Romans 5:3 so but radically and how
[1:24:54] you have to work and you have
[1:24:55] temptations by working you know this
[1:24:59] because what I've seen the fruit of that
[1:25:01] you know what we have end-of-the-year
[1:25:03] benchmarks and first-grade you gotta
[1:25:04] meet they going to do so many time tests
[1:25:06] they got that you so good on their
[1:25:08] reading words per minute I think the guy
[1:25:10] that would be so good on their reading
[1:25:11] level and at the beginning the year I
[1:25:16] have this both the board I put up and
[1:25:18] said this is where you're going these
[1:25:19] are the goals you have to read this many
[1:25:21] words of men you have to write this many
[1:25:22] sentences you have to do this many facts
[1:25:26] in eight minutes on the time test and
[1:25:28] this week we finished all of our tests
[1:25:32] and I get to enjoy the fruit of my
[1:25:33] Labor's here we understand that back in
[1:25:37] August I started planting fruits of
[1:25:39] helping them become better readers and
[1:25:41] better writers and better at addition
[1:25:43] and subtraction and some of the
[1:25:45] multiplication and division so my first
[1:25:46] graders time to publication division and
[1:25:48] I've labored all year you know it's hard
[1:25:50] sometimes vodka let's go back and help
[1:25:53] this from the stove and so intervene
[1:25:54] here let's go back and do it but we kept
[1:25:56] faithfully working basically and I have
[1:25:58] patients that some of them church I just
[1:25:59] think they make the goal but this week
[1:26:01] I've seen almost everyone did by God's
[1:26:03] grace now that is just a small example
[1:26:06] that's just a nine-month planting and
[1:26:09] harvesting season are you with
[1:26:11] but I had to be patient good say well
[1:26:14] Johnny you need to read faster or Susie
[1:26:17] need to add these better you know you're
[1:26:18] not a DS the right Layton you're not
[1:26:20] making it up growth that's just like
[1:26:23] going out to your garden yelling at your
[1:26:24] garden tonight when you get home from
[1:26:25] church you radishes what's wrong with
[1:26:28] you you celery looks your problem let us
[1:26:32] what your problem I planted you three
[1:26:34] weeks ago maybe been wrong or something
[1:26:36] and I just enjoyed the fruits of my
[1:26:40] labors this week and I always give up
[1:26:41] starburst I give the kids all these all
[1:26:44] right cause I know it's my calls in some
[1:26:45] cavities but their parents even time to
[1:26:47] brush their teeth but my teachers gave
[1:26:51] always gave me our extra rewards I love
[1:26:54] to do it they've their faces just
[1:26:55] everybody needs a paycheck you know
[1:26:57] everybody needs like something summer
[1:26:59] wore don't think when I was yelling at
[1:27:02] my grandma gave me $5 for every a I
[1:27:04] worked my tail off to get straight A's
[1:27:06] I enjoyed that money I spent on baseball
[1:27:09] cards and candied apples and all kinds
[1:27:11] of things I love reading reward and I do
[1:27:14] it today and help them to see that your
[1:27:16] works not in vain so this week I saw the
[1:27:20] fruits of my patients praise God I was
[1:27:22] patient with Suzy a patient with Lily or
[1:27:24] patient with this one and that one and
[1:27:26] they did exceedingly abundantly above
[1:27:28] all I asked in the new glory amen
[1:27:32] and see Church that's what we have to do
[1:27:34] with faithfully with Bryce if we're not
[1:27:36] there though where we want to be in
[1:27:38] Christ be patient we got to be patient
[1:27:42] and keep planning and keep investing and
[1:27:44] keep believing and be faithful be
[1:27:47] faithful gardeners be faithful teachers
[1:27:49] faithful parents faithful pastors
[1:27:51] faithful deacons faithful song leaders
[1:27:53] whatever you are be faithful and God
[1:27:55] will bless you at the end of the road
[1:27:56] amen it's exactly right great stuff in
[1:27:59] church they can't exceed me but above
[1:28:01] all I ask them to do and I don't get to
[1:28:04] hug them and give them high-fives you
[1:28:05] know and shake their hands and I believe
[1:28:07] that's what Jesus was do you know not
[1:28:08] maybe high five course on high five but
[1:28:11] it will definitely follow the speed and
[1:28:13] worship Him a man and a wife away all
[1:28:15] the tears rise if we're faithful to the
[1:28:16] end glory did you know did you know
[1:28:20] the hope of being saved in the rapture
[1:28:22] four step process I'm waiting for the
[1:28:25] revelation I would preach to a whole
[1:28:26] sermon on this the site is struck me
[1:28:28] when Simon came and preaches a few
[1:28:30] Wednesday nights ago having how many of
[1:28:33] us were to be saved
[1:28:34] I don't have hope to go the rapture it's
[1:28:36] a four-step process to get that hope it
[1:28:39] doesn't happen overnight
[1:28:40] some of you partner when you first came
[1:28:42] the messenger maybe got tempted to go
[1:28:44] back to the world it's hard to kind of
[1:28:45] hope you know use this or not you don't
[1:28:48] may be able to I want to keep these
[1:28:50] cigarettes off for me or I'm able to
[1:28:52] keep this custon away or able to stay
[1:28:54] away from those movie theaters or I may
[1:28:56] want to stop doing this or that or this
[1:28:58] relationship you might not have the hope
[1:29:01] yet you had but if you serve God long
[1:29:03] enough and be faithful to God God will
[1:29:05] give you that blessed hope I understand
[1:29:07] it's something that doesn't come in a
[1:29:09] few days it comes after seasons and
[1:29:12] seasons and years and years of serving
[1:29:14] God we must be faithful servants we must
[1:29:17] serve out of love in our heart Satan or
[1:29:20] and not only so but we glory in
[1:29:24] tribulations also knowing that
[1:29:25] tribulation works patience so you'll
[1:29:30] never get patient without going through
[1:29:31] trials and that patience produces
[1:29:36] experience I've had the experience of
[1:29:39] waiting on God and I saw God showing me
[1:29:42] that situation but I had to go through
[1:29:45] the trial first or through the trial
[1:29:47] that increased my patients the patient's
[1:29:50] led me to have more experience with God
[1:29:52] and after all of this experience now
[1:29:55] I've got hope some people I talk to
[1:29:59] people brother about an sister I thought
[1:30:00] you people recently that's that I hope I
[1:30:02] get saved and know the message you heard
[1:30:04] there hold on how is that possible how
[1:30:07] can you know this and then not have any
[1:30:09] hope it's because they're skipping some
[1:30:11] of these steps praise God like I said
[1:30:14] last week when the sister said the Holy
[1:30:15] Spirit struck around preaching I said
[1:30:17] the problem is people haven't rejected
[1:30:20] they say they've been baptized it when
[1:30:22] they were on a drive center right and
[1:30:24] came up a wet one they never really died
[1:30:26] themselves because their rice prudent
[1:30:28] they never have the patience that they
[1:30:30] never they never get through
[1:30:31] tribulations like y'all to they fall
[1:30:33] during tribulations rather
[1:30:35] Hey they follow the sit rather than
[1:30:40] coming over sit amet and they never go
[1:30:43] through this four-step process and hope
[1:30:45] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[1:30:47] God has shed abroad in our hearts by the
[1:30:49] Holy Ghost which is given to us amen
[1:30:51] hallelujah see they don't have any
[1:30:55] optical erection already hope to go to
[1:30:57] heaven why because they haven't gone
[1:30:58] through they haven't evolved through the
[1:31:00] tribulation then I died themselves they
[1:31:02] haven't had patience and way not God
[1:31:04] like they ought to it's a four-step
[1:31:08] process I'm waiting for the more
[1:31:09] understand because there's a lot of
[1:31:10] forms right there's the 419 to the four
[1:31:13] beasts right
[1:31:14] Lazarus said it would race on the fourth
[1:31:16] day there's four Gospels Matthew Mark
[1:31:18] Luke and John there's a lot of fours out
[1:31:20] there there's fourth man to fire yeah
[1:31:22] there's a lot of course I wait for the
[1:31:23] inspiration on that but it's true if you
[1:31:26] don't go to the fourth step you won't
[1:31:28] have hope the Blessed hope for the
[1:31:30] rapture and that reminds me of another
[1:31:32] hope army oh this is okay I'm just pull
[1:31:37] these scriptures up here I think it's
[1:31:41] actually called the Blessed hope and
[1:31:42] Titus chapter 2 that's actually talking
[1:31:44] about the rapture I'm not mistaken yep
[1:31:48] there's there's okay Titus 2:13 looking
[1:31:52] for that blessed hope and the glorious
[1:31:54] appearing of our great God and our
[1:31:57] Savior Jesus Christ this is what people
[1:32:00] can't over the rapture they haven't been
[1:32:02] faithful
[1:32:03] they haven't served God they haven't
[1:32:05] really repent of their sin they still
[1:32:07] love sin more than i truly love God
[1:32:14] praise God
[1:32:17] are you joined the word distorted amen
[1:32:20] I tried to go get him give me a few
[1:32:21] minutes hear me I want to go too long I
[1:32:24] go along again I'm going to pass out
[1:32:26] when I get home from work on these days
[1:32:27] master Friday I soon got home I said to
[1:32:31] hi honey
[1:32:31] Lincoln get out on the floor every since
[1:32:34] you like you need to go lay on the couch
[1:32:36] and belts they found so worn out oh my I
[1:32:39] got out of control myself there is
[1:32:42] absolutely no other way in which to gain
[1:32:44] patience it has to come by the trials of
[1:32:47] movement
[1:32:47] you have to go through trials you have
[1:32:51] to wrestle out with God in glory because
[1:32:55] tribulation worketh patience how highly
[1:32:59] God regards is out working of our
[1:33:01] patients and seeing James 1 4 but let
[1:33:04] patience have a perfect work that you
[1:33:07] may be perfect and entire lacking
[1:33:10] nothing God's will for us is perfection
[1:33:14] and that perfection is patience I love
[1:33:18] this quote waiting on God and waiting
[1:33:22] for God glory amen
[1:33:25] this is the process of character
[1:33:28] development yet the wait on God and wait
[1:33:32] for him this is how character is
[1:33:34] developed tribulation patience gives you
[1:33:40] experience and experience gives you the
[1:33:42] blessing whole book you know and your
[1:33:43] knowing the rapture and if you die
[1:33:46] you'll meet him in the air how highly
[1:33:49] God has committed these things of the
[1:33:51] dark ages patient as lambs led to the
[1:33:54] slaughter lovingly faithfully they serve
[1:33:57] God that is all they wanted out of life
[1:34:00] look at that look at that
[1:34:01] what is the world 1 they just what
[1:34:03] pleasures and monies and houses and
[1:34:05] lands and all these think that's all
[1:34:06] they went on but all the Christian wants
[1:34:08] out of life is to serve God hey man hey
[1:34:11] that's all he wants our life just
[1:34:16] service to their Lord how great was to
[1:34:19] be their reward I know how it works in
[1:34:24] the last to be a more than a person they
[1:34:27] got close to this in just a moment I I'm
[1:34:29] not going to get through outer space
[1:34:29] without wearing myself up I know yeah
[1:34:35] now look at this laughs works were more
[1:34:38] than their first so in the church age
[1:34:41] their works were greater at the end of
[1:34:45] the church age their works were greater
[1:34:47] at the end of their life never to
[1:34:49] understand that by God's grace I
[1:34:50] remember brother branham's testimony of
[1:34:52] t/l up not to your mother at that Bosma
[1:34:54] how do you know that testimony remember
[1:34:57] that he was a preacher for how many
[1:34:59] years 30 40 years
[1:35:01] he was 70 some years old and he was
[1:35:03] already retired from preaching like he
[1:35:05] was like a cow going out to pasture you
[1:35:07] don't even - done
[1:35:08] he was just done and all of a sudden he
[1:35:10] heard about the miraculous ministry
[1:35:12] William Branham and it's so inspired him
[1:35:14] he left retirement and started preaching
[1:35:18] and I think it was 75 years old I think
[1:35:20] in time of Abraham how Abraham got a
[1:35:21] call 75 50 men amen
[1:35:24] Lori and Evan Bosworth testimony was
[1:35:28] that he preached until he died I forget
[1:35:29] how old he was everybody was it was like
[1:35:31] 85 or somebody yeah like 10 more years
[1:35:33] of ministry and his testimony was he did
[1:35:37] more work at the end of his life than he
[1:35:39] did the beginning hey Lori and in other
[1:35:45] words that I would encourage you if you
[1:35:46] haven't served God up to this point like
[1:35:50] you've left you you can serve God marks
[1:35:52] are you done hey Ann Marie it's exactly
[1:35:56] right or if you've already served got a
[1:35:58] lot you don't have to say well I can't
[1:35:59] go any higher
[1:36:00] you can go higher right ahead amen yes
[1:36:02] you can hallelujah Jesus says your works
[1:36:07] are more at the end and that's the
[1:36:10] beginning praise God
[1:36:12] why do you think the devil had me to see
[1:36:14] I couldn't do any more for forgotten
[1:36:15] heart yes you can there's always more to
[1:36:18] God if you'll use yourself to the Holy
[1:36:20] Spirit hey man
[1:36:22] and what about him say he said when FF
[1:36:25] Bosworth died he spent the last hours
[1:36:27] like shaking hands with people in
[1:36:28] another dimension and they were thanking
[1:36:32] him for going to preach the gospel at 75
[1:36:35] years old 80 years old still preaching
[1:36:38] the gospel church your life is not in
[1:36:41] vain you can pick up today and your
[1:36:43] service at the end can be more at the
[1:36:45] end it wasn't the begin hallelujah I
[1:36:50] don't give oh or don't tire it's hard
[1:36:52] for me to get up earlier it's hard for
[1:36:54] me like I said hard for me to a lot of
[1:36:55] things hidden but where myself out but
[1:36:59] that's no excuse the power of God is
[1:37:02] able to restore he's the God of
[1:37:04] restoration
[1:37:05] I'll restore Sanford a man all the years
[1:37:08] is prophecy that's what the bride will
[1:37:10] do all the years of the been lost God
[1:37:12] will make up for it and
[1:37:13] short quit work coming on that quota
[1:37:15] yeah hi there you don't make up for at
[1:37:18] the end the end will be greater than the
[1:37:21] beginning a day exactly right the glory
[1:37:24] of the latter house is prettier than the
[1:37:26] glory of the harbor I'm gonna do you
[1:37:28] know that from a seat zechariah chapter
[1:37:30] 4 in it
[1:37:31] the glory of the ladder is greater than
[1:37:34] the former but now I can see another we
[1:37:38] want to see how many also going to
[1:37:39] believe that for our lives it's easy to
[1:37:42] hear that the Word of God is sweet as
[1:37:44] honey in the mouth oh it's bitter when
[1:37:47] it comes Monday morning it's time to
[1:37:49] pray it's better on Wednesday night when
[1:37:52] you're tired but the Holy Spirit's
[1:37:54] calling you to hear the preaching of the
[1:37:56] word amen glory amen thank you Jesus
[1:38:06] this is certainly remarkable program
[1:38:08] says it's remarkable that a church can
[1:38:11] give more service to God at the end of
[1:38:13] their life in the beginning because at
[1:38:15] the beginning you had more energy right
[1:38:17] physical it's not about physical energy
[1:38:20] it's about being led of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:23] how many I might even go to understand
[1:38:24] this we should be more sensitive to the
[1:38:26] Holy Spirit as we get older we should be
[1:38:28] used to hearing his voice and so as we
[1:38:31] get older we shouldn't we should be able
[1:38:33] to obey more clearly than when we're
[1:38:37] going we just wanna do some forgotten
[1:38:38] will just you know jump with the hat of
[1:38:39] anything yet which is okay we're trying
[1:38:41] doing something but many times we're
[1:38:43] just spinning our wheels when were
[1:38:44] younger right like the finances us I
[1:38:46] didn't know about finances I'm spinning
[1:38:48] my wheels just paid the minimum on the
[1:38:50] mortgage paid the minimum on the man and
[1:38:52] not realizes I'm not getting anywhere I
[1:38:54] had to be a little bit more mature start
[1:38:56] paying down on some of these things and
[1:38:58] use the wisdom right same thing
[1:39:01] spiritually we start off with just
[1:39:03] trying through something but here's we
[1:39:04] get older with God we should be more in
[1:39:06] tune with the Holy Spirit's into our
[1:39:07] lives and then God can bless it more at
[1:39:11] the end and in beginning as the darkness
[1:39:15] of this age increase at the honor of the
[1:39:17] martyrs grew length here day by day they
[1:39:19] worked all the harder they served all
[1:39:25] the more they come to church
[1:39:27] they prayed less that what he says no
[1:39:31] they did more
[1:39:33] and Jesus noticed that Jesus noticed
[1:39:37] their dedication in and grow less their
[1:39:38] dedication increased and what's the
[1:39:41] prophecy getting we're going to have the
[1:39:43] same church just like the book of Acts
[1:39:46] chirps that's prophecy we're going back
[1:39:48] in order to go up I don't remember that
[1:39:50] by God's grace remember that so see as a
[1:39:54] pastor you know I look at I look at the
[1:39:56] congregation you look at my life our
[1:39:57] lives should have more dedication if
[1:40:00] we're following in line with the
[1:40:01] prophecy our dedication in Christ should
[1:40:03] increase even though we're tired even
[1:40:06] though it's hard it's going to be hard
[1:40:07] either way you're going to get a hard
[1:40:09] cold heart we're not feet all the things
[1:40:11] of God or is gonna be a hard serving God
[1:40:12] but you got to press through through the
[1:40:13] will of God and see as you serve God
[1:40:18] more what increases your favorite verses
[1:40:21] how tragic it was in the fusion Age
[1:40:24] loved waned they had their works but
[1:40:26] they left their first love they were
[1:40:28] working with us they were working
[1:40:30] without love in the first church cake at
[1:40:31] that initial revival and it truly
[1:40:34] nothing asset of the increased labor of
[1:40:36] love and the other ages I'm closing with
[1:40:38] it so stay tuned or feel better
[1:40:41] I preached about an hour and a half ago
[1:40:44] that's great god bless you for your
[1:40:46] patience I'm closing to this and truly
[1:40:53] nothing is said of the increased labor
[1:40:55] of love in the other ages another age
[1:40:57] had this testimony see that's why the
[1:41:00] church ages are so powerful Church it
[1:41:02] will just get to the channel this ain't
[1:41:04] just another sermon or another book this
[1:41:06] is what the Holy Spirit wants us to see
[1:41:07] right now
[1:41:09] we can give more service to God now our
[1:41:12] service to God can increase now it
[1:41:16] doesn't have to get weaker and weaker we
[1:41:18] can get stronger and stronger but in
[1:41:24] this age and the darkest of all ages
[1:41:26] they served him more and more what a
[1:41:29] lesson that is there is no ceasing of
[1:41:33] this gracious service of love into the
[1:41:36] Lord but rather and increasing
[1:41:39] of it that is the secret
[1:41:45] how can you wonder how can this brother
[1:41:48] have such victory how can the sister of
[1:41:49] such victory
[1:41:50] how many bless the secret you don't
[1:41:52] decrease the love or the service you
[1:41:55] increase Amen you don't love yourself
[1:42:00] and love just the people you love others
[1:42:03] you don't grow the world worldly
[1:42:05] material things you serve other people
[1:42:09] that is the secret let the enemy attempt
[1:42:13] to thwart our service to the Lord our
[1:42:16] reply is what increase certain Amen did
[1:42:20] brother Randall did what he was
[1:42:21] preaching yeah

[1:42:37] see him increasing his service to guy
