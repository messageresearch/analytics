[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what a holy name let's take our Bibles here I like to get right into the Word of God here tonight by His grace let's go back to 2nd Timothy chapter 1 if we could in your Bibles if you have it here it's good to be back with you again I'm really enjoying having all these services in a row pray to the heart it's good to be with everybody here today 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verse 9 we'll just read verse 9 to get started like to look at purpose again tonight and I just like look at this little thought of God's planned or God planned your purpose I want to look at that here tonight by God's grace so I can timothy 1 verse 9 so let's begin on three let's all read this together if you can let's read it on three one two three who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began how many believe that tonight God has a holy calling he saved you for to be holy not according to your works but according to his purpose his intent and his grace in your life Amen I'm so glad he's called me for his purpose I just have to do his purpose you and I just have to do his purpose on this earth and of course if he asked you to do something he's gonna help you do it that's how word of Prayer let's just bow our heads if you have a need on your heart tonight just make it known unto the Lord Heavenly Father Lord you see the hands raised you see the hearts raised Lord God and Lord you're aware of each one of these people Lord they're your children they're your creation they're your masterpiece dear God and I pray Lord you administer to each one by your word help me to get out of your way and father let your your liberty and your power and your love and your your care just flow from the Word of God here tonight may each person feel your divine presence may each person hear from heaven O God and may you minister Lord to us and may you continue to guide us and direct us and as you promised lead us into all truth dear God we're looking for your coming Lord God we're watching and waiting we're praying O God Lord were where we're designing every each day of our life Lord God to point to you to glorify you you're the purpose of our lives and father we want to live according to thy purpose that you've made known to us Lord Granite Lord here tonight that you speak to every heart in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless she's been seated praise God so I want to get right to this thought here and try to get be very cautious at the time here by His grace so I do have quotes again here by the grace of Lord I would look at a little bit on our thoughts or our purpose and then look at brother branham's purpose and then after that I like to look at the purpose that God had for one of brother Rams friends which is quite striking so I'm gonna move it up here I don't know how many have have how many have studied garnet peak is anyone ever studied his funeral message by the random preach does anybody ever study that Jose do ever so okay so I want to end with that and look at that year tonight to kind of give you an idea about how God has planned he's planned your purpose we talked about this a little bit about how how God has a plan or a purpose for you and it's not your choice it's God's choice and so we have to be humble enough to listen and like we said on on Monday night we have to ask God God what's your plan for my life what's your purpose for my life and so you want to look at that here again briefly tonight we read our text it's a holy calling and it's God's own purpose that was given in Christ before the world began this has already planned out it's already orchestrated just like you and I would see someone build a building or would you build something there's blueprints it's already planned out and we just have to ask God to show us what his blueprint is all about and then we have to walk in it now I pulled a little bit of inspiration again from this book Purpose Driven Life and and the second chapter starts off with these words you're not an accident and this kind of shows the the plan this is another way to say that God has planned for you to be here so it says you are not an accident your birth was no mishap or mistake your life is no fluke of nature your parents may not have planned for you but God did was anybody a surprise in here I know I wasn't but my mom wanted me to be a girl so when I came out she's a little disappointed because she already had three boys I know a little bit I was a little disappointment to my parents you know of course in a little way because my mom said we were hoping you'd be a girl but the next one was so see God was not at all surprised by your birth in fact he expected you to come long before you were conceived by your parents you were conceived in the mind of God he thought of you first it is not fate nor chance nor luck nor coincidence that you are breathing at this very moment you're alive because God wanted to create you the Bible says the Lord will fulfill his purpose for you so I want to just read those scriptures this is our text now we remember this one it's very familiar he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so we are already in the mind of God we were chosen in his thoughts that we should be holy so I can prove by these two scriptures that God's purpose for you and I is to be holy that is part of the purpose of your life to see it to live as holy as you possibly can how many started out twenty nineteen living holy for Jesus amen hallelujah I have and I trust you are as well now this is the scripture that's referenced the Lord will perfect that which concern with me the Psalms writer says now perfect means to complete to bring to an end all that God has planned for me God will bring me to that end he says thy mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake not the works of thine hands so God will bring holiness to completion remember holiness is part of your calling so God will make you more holy amen if you're willing to yield yourself if you're willing to surrender to God God will make you more holy in other words God will make you fall more in love with him amen because he'll perfect that which concern with me whatever God's plan is for me he's going to bring it to pass and that mate reminds us of Philippians 1 verses 2 to 6 grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen so Paul would remember the Philippians every time he prayed he thought of the Philippians he says here and he was he was assured God would finish what he started until the day of Jesus Christ amen now he said the rider says God prescribed every single detail of your body he deliberately chose your race the color of your skin your hair because remember every hair is numbered and every other feature he custom made your body just the way he wanted it he also determined the natural talents you would possess and the uniqueness of your personality the Bible says I'm just gonna read the Bible says I will praise thee David said from fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and my that my soul knoweth right well hallelujah now we you know the the world doesn't want us to think we're wonderful but we really are wonderful God has made our bodies in a wonderful way not to make us a proud or anything like that but just to acknowledge when God made God made us he made something special praise God he did a great creation and he says my substance which means the bones was not hid from me when I was made in secret and curiously raw and the lowest parts of the earth you know they can see inside of a mother's womb and in the third month they can see that the bones are forming all the bones are there and from that third month they're there and they just spread out and they become more and more identified that there's 300 bones when a baby 3 months a baby in the womb has 300 bones you know as it's born and everything all those bones kind of they kind of go smaller and a smaller number and they end up with 209 when it's born so the bones kind of fuse together there's less bones as it grows but these were not hid from God in other words God can see right into the womb praise the Lord God's right there he knows exactly nothing's hid from God so God's been watching you but well before you were out of the womb God even watched you while you're in the womb brace of the heart that's what the Bible said wasn't hid from God God didn't just say oh there's Jesse when I was born you know he was there he knew he had it all planned out it wasn't hid from him it was a wonderful thing that God was doing he said when I was made in secret and curiously wrought the lowest parts of the earth nine eyes that see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them so all of your members and one translation says all your days God saw all your days in his book were already written when we didn't even realize them God knew the number of our days and he says how precious are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them so see God's plan should be precious to us God has a book of each one of us write the Bible said his book thy book all my members were written praise God so God's book has us written in there he knows all about us it's all in there and David said it should be precious to us God's thoughts about us God's plan for us should be precious to us amen in other words in other words we should say God thank you for my life thank you for what you're doing in my life you knew all about this would happen well before it even happened I have confidence in you I have confidence in your plan it's precious to me my life is precious thank you for giving it to me help me to be thankful he glory how precious are your thoughts in other words how precious is the Word of God because these are God's thoughts and he said how great is this some of them hallelujah God made you for a reason he also decided when you would be born and how long you would live he planned the days of your life choosing the exact time of your birth and death and we just read those scriptures so he knew when you would be born and how long you would live the Bible said there's a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted so the Bible said teach us to number our days that we may apply or enter our hearts unto wisdom so teach us to remember that we just have a certain limited number of days a church we keep that in mind we can either let that go the wrong way interfere or it can go the right way into faith and motivation or I've only got let's say I'm 38 let's say you know the God promises a man 70 years right so let's say I got I'm almost forty so I got thirty two more years let's say God you know that either make us go into fear and depression or that'll make us go into faith and confidence Lord use these last 40 years of my life help me to use them for your glory I know they're going to end soon so help me to seize the day help me to redeem the time help me to live for you help me to give you everything I got with joy because I know I don't have forever help me to live as close to you as I can because I know I've only got a certain number of days amen help me to make like like that sign says the high school where I teach I don't teach at the building but where in my district it says don't count the days make the days count I like that don't count the days how many days left I got no make the days count let this day be to the glory of God help me use this day to tell others about Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so see when you number your days off only got this many days I'm gonna make these days count you apply or you enter into wisdom and I've and I can thank the Lord that I gave my heart to God at 19 I've been able to give my 20s to Jesus Christ so I spent in 20 from 20 to 25 learning about the Word of God and I spent 25 to 30 being a pastor then I spent thirty to thirty eight where I am now I spent all that time preaching loving Jesus and being a pastor raising my family I'm thankful that I've entered into the wisdom of God I haven't left my family and chased after alcohol or or anything evil like that or sensuality or any carnality like that I've tried to apply my heart to wisdom to invest in the things of God and we have people on Facebook now that are asking us to write a book about how to do marriage and parenting because people can see Christ in our lives amen because it's not it's not me it's not me it's taking the glory it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ so that we can see the blood of Jesus Christ must be applied to our lives and it's applied to our lives it becomes wisdom it becomes the way of God that's right amen so teach us to number our days hallelujah that will live wise lives now this is one I forgot to write so I've got your Bible go to acts 17 here I forgot to put this one down on the slide I've referenced this over the years I can't remember the last time I preached it well let's just go ahead and read it here acts 17:26 let's go to actually of 17 22 now the writer says God also planned where he planned when you would be born when you would die and then he planned of course where you would be born at and where you'd live for his purpose because he had a purpose for you to be born in Ghana we had a purpose for you to be born in Ohio or which one was it brother Nicaragua he had a purpose for you to be born in Nicaragua it's a purpose God knew the purpose your race and nationality are no accident God left no detail to chance he planned it all for his purpose and this is where the Bible said Paul is up on Mars Hill in acts 17 22 then Paul stood up in the midst of Mars Hill and said you men of Athens I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious for I passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you verse 24 God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worship with man's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things verse 26 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth now here it is and hath determine the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation so God determined the time you'd be born and God also determined the country or the habitation you'd be born in praise God hallelujah now look at verse 27 that they should seek after the Lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for ye also are his offspring amen aren't you glad you're the offspring of God or you're a child of God you are God's offspring now we're gonna get to this a little later but God determined where you be born because where you would be born would help you to seek the Lord praise God that's what the Bible says you were born in a certain place because being born in that place would help you to seek after God had you been born in a different place you might not have to sought after God like we can look at Jose's life and he was born in a certain place so he could meet his current wife and be introduced to the message right brother that right we're gonna look at this Garnett peak at the end he was born in a country where there was tobacco fields all around and brother Brahim said that was his desire to be a bat aback o farmer but he said when he was when when the message came to Garnett peak he had this he had a plan to be a tobacco farmer but he turned that down in order to gain Christ he had to be born in a certain place and the only attraction that the highest attraction of his life would be to be a tobacco farmer well I'm gonna brace tobacco and I'm gonna sell tobacco so I can sell it and make some money and that actually drove him the emptiness of that drove him to accept Jesus Christ in the message amen so in your life God has placed you here God has placed me here in this place here where where we were placed here and then now we look around and see and I thank God where God placed me right there in Liberty senator Ohio it's an hour north of Lima brother and brother Brandon would visit Lima all the time honey amen thank you Lord and so so when Simon after September 11th after Simon was shook up by September 11th he saw an advertisement for a Bible study he went to that Bible study and he learned about the message of God a man so he was close to a message church God determined that we'd be close to that church to meet brother Brooks and meet brother Craig and meet all these sayings and the ones of the brother and sister Brown that went to brother Adams church we got to meet them and staying at their a house a few nights God determined that God placed us in a position where we'd be able to hear the word I'm glad he did it praise God amen other God determined that God knew I'd received the message just by studying the scripture with brother Craig God knew that was how I needed to receive it praise God so God determined that we should seek after the Lord God determined when we'd be born where are we we born so that we would seek after God hallelujah look at verse 29 for as much then as we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that Godhead is like on the gold or silver stone graven by art and man's device alright just let's pause right there now that's got me thinking there let me just uh that got me thinking here let me switch over just a minute did you see this I did you see the Pope's prayer it just got me thinking did you see the the Pope had a prayer yesterday and his prayer was not to Jesus for the new year it was to Mary I can show you the link this is the Catholic knew this is their own this is their own website so like we just read the Godhead is not liking on the stone silver or gold or silver stone graven by art and man's device and look there's a golden Mary in Jesus who looks greater in that picture marry her Jesus Mary looks greater and in this prayer for 2019 the prayer is to mother Mary he said we we fly to your protection see they're running to Mary but we're running to Jesus amen hallelujah they run to Mary they which is a false god which is evil spirits they run to to Mary but we run into a tower the righteous run into the tower the name of Jesus Christ and they're saying amen we see they're making the Godhead unto gold just what the scripture says they shouldn't do there's update there's a ghost picture there she got earrings on the Bible condemns earrings in that so sad Church they Dec them in gold and all these precious gold and the Bible says right there do not make the Godhead to like it any gold or silver anything like that you're not striking I thought mine well I thought well I better show that to the church just to see where they're headed the Pope's praying for their unity he's praying for all those things and he's praying to Mary God keep us a million miles away from that thank you lord hey God give us grace to love people that that are so caught and too seen by that they don't even understand what they know or they don't even understand what they believe oh my just thought I'd share that with you alright it's all for a purpose so God planned that you'd live in Ohio so you'd have a message Church here in Akron is that right God God desires right the Bible said you gather more as you see that Day approaching so gathering together is not an option it's a command if God has to command you to do it he's going to have a church here for you to gather with amen it's all ordained of God it's all in God's purpose we just have to do God's purpose amen now he said most amazing God decided how you would be born regardless of the circumstances of your birth or who your parents are God had a plan in creating you it doesn't matter whether your parents were good or bad or indifferent God knew that those two individuals was that's exactly the right genetic makeup to create the custom you that he had in mind they the DNA God wanted to make you that's right while there are illegitimate parents there are no illegitimate children I like the Hat de menthe glory many children are unplanned by their parents but they are not unplanned by God God's purpose took into account human air and even sin honey remember Tim Tebow and remember him that football player he's an NFL the doctors told his mom to abort him because they looked at the ultrasound and they thought he would be mentally or didn't have enough oxygen and look she could have she could have took in that and said oh well I better aboard I better kill off this life but look what came out of this life a man that will stand there on the TV and say I think the Lord and Savior my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and whether he's you know wise or foolish now we have our opinion right but whether he's wise or foolish it's a life that that the world said wasn't worth living the DNA wasn't going to be any good but look how God can redeem when doctors are wrong when man is wrong look how great God is to redeem from the pits of hell amen hallelujah there's so many examples of like of that where doctors and and maybe mothers and fathers you know didn't think there would be anything good about life but when given a chance God redeems life from the grave amen hallelujah God never does anything accidentally he never makes mistakes he has a reason for everything he creates every plant and every animal was planned by God and every person was designed with the purpose in mind God's motive for creating you as his love the Bible said long before he laid the foundations he had us in mind he had a settled on us as the focus of his love and that was from Ephesians 1:4 let me go back to that one theevans one for ya the Bible says we should be holy and without blame before him in love it's all about love God created us because he loved us and now he wants us to love him back right now instead here he said like the attribute see it is in God and attribute as your thought God in the beginning the eternal he wasn't even a God he wasn't he was the eternal he wasn't even God he God is an object of worship or something see so he wasn't even that he was Elohim the eternal but in him was thoughts he wanted to become material and what he knew then he spoke a word and the word was materialized that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation is nothing wrong it's Elohim materializing so he can be touched feel and in the millennium there's hello him sitting on the throne see that's right with all subjects around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world imagine how that's gonna feel for God now of course God is not like you and I but God had him in his mind and then manifested them throughout these six thousand years and then pretty soon in the Millennium for a thousand years here the very image of his mind now comes it comes into a reality praise the Lord Ava had his thoughts come to reality hallelujah brother and said there's like a man building chimes or making chimes the motor each bells got to ring different from each other the same materials but so much I earn so much steel so much rest to make it give the ting he says that's the way God did God read this one - that one - the what that one - one - one - this one - one till he got exactly what he wanted so that's what God did with you he put your grandparents together then put your parents together and here you come you're exactly what God wanted you to be so you could have a special sound to your life a special testimony to your life Amen God either made you to be a man to be a godly man have a special ring as a man or a special woman a woman has a special testimony and to overcome certain things and at the end of it has such a sweet testimony God's going to use that testimony on judgement day to condemn all those that that wouldn't serve Him but it'll stand as a witness that Jesus Christ was real in this generation amen so God read this one and that one and put all these together your mother and father and then you have a special testimony he said that's how he came down God and veiled himself in a pillar of fire down through the prophets than into the Son of God which he was God see it's the same God bringing out exactly from perfection of perfection from glory into glory that's the way the church goes hallelujah from glory to glory now look what the liquidus the Bible says here but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us you feel love tonight you should feel the love of God tonight you shouldn't feel hatred toward God or disappointment God is disappointed in you or God's trying to condemn you the Bible doesn't say God's trying to do that the Bible said God wants to show us how much he loves us amen his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus what kind of love does he have for us great love now look at this God loved you in great love for this purpose that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ so once we get to heaven God is going to show us all his great love over and over and over again I later yeah praise God amen there's so many things we don't know about yet God through it all as expresses love to us constantly faithfully over and over and it's so great he's going to take ages and ages and times and cycles and seasons and over and over again to show us all of his great love oh thank you lord it's kind of like you know think about this you know my teacher that's dying you know he has over probably like a hundred comments on Facebook just people thanking him and then today I went there to the the the hospice care and he had 40 greeting cards and each one people were thanking him now I could have went I went through those I just briefly went through them maybe for 30 minutes but I'd imagine if I write each of those it'd probably take me about two hours and so two hours you'd spend saying wow look at look at the appreciation for this for this man there's two hours we could just spend telling this person how much he's loved and Jesus you know he came so that we might take years and years and years not just a few hours but years and ages trying to understand how much he loves us not to ours but Ages amen why did God love us with a great way so that in ages to come he could show us this great kindness that he gave us by grace for by grace ye are saved through faith and that not of works it's the gift of God it's a great gift now that works lest any man should boast there'll be no bragging on the Day of Judgment Church there'll be no bragging over there it'll be all by God's grace that we did it but he'll take ages and so well this is where I was kind to you here this is where I express my grace to you right here this is where I showed mercy to you this is where I showed love and he'll take ages and ages to do that and we'll just all sit there say hallelujah thank you Lord well praise have been praise him and say mine well worship him and love him for ages as he shows us his great love that he's given to us and say wasn't you Jesse it wasn't you brother branham it wasn't you you put your name in there brother Malik over there it wasn't you it was my grace that did it for you oh thank you Lord and this then the passage ends with this for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them see God we're we're a planned out product we were an invention God invented with a special purpose in mind and nobody could do that better than we could there's something God has some work God has for you and I to do and there's nobody better that could do it than you because you're his workmanship and he created you not to fail but he created you unto good works not the new bad works and fail he created you to succeed and do what he called you to do in something good amen and all's you gotta do is walk in it he's got a walk in obedience to his calling in your life praise God and he's ordained you to it he's called you to it to walk in this plan for your life hallelujah now let's take a few moments to look at programs purpose Josie and I were talking about this a little bit a few nights ago now there's many things that could be said about the purpose of brother Branham but I'm just taking the quotes or brother BAM said I was born to this or I was called to do that those are those are the quotes I looked up and here's what I found about program's purpose now when the ancient Lord first met me he said now you were born to play video games make moonshine that's what does dad wanted them to do right you were born to pray for sick people and you take this gift to the peoples of the world so all Christians are born to take our gifts and use them you were born to pray for sick people so there was just a certain way brother Aaron well Jose there's just a certain way that brother Branham bowed his head and prayed hey I didn't hear you he could do in such a way that other people couldn't do it that way where you can hear and you can hear on the tape right when you listen he could pray and you know he was touching the heart of God amen he was born to do that it was in him to do that he had a way didn't have to shout all the time he'd have to yell then there's times I've heard him yell and I've heard him yell to people stand up on that wheelchair receive your healing and everybody goes wow at other times I've heard him just say God's gonna do it for you just real sweet humble in the name of Jesus receive your healing he was born to do that like he said like he said in his own testimony before he was saved he would spend his Sunday morning shining his model Ford car and he said he said oh what a waste of time he said that's the one thing I did rob from God I did steal from God he said I stole God's time he said instead of shining up my Ford I could have been trying to win souls amen so he wasn't just born to pray he actually had to go and take that to someone else because he had the calling of an evangelist now here's again where he says it I'm just gonna skip down a little bit he said I never studied on divine healing or anything in the Bible but he said you were born to pray for sick people take a gift of divine healing now I I put that quote up there and in particular because divine healing is one of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit so his his purpose in life was directly directly associated with one of the nine gifts of the holy spirit that's what I mentioned on a Monday night that I believe Church that you and I have some of those nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and our lives are directly tied to them our purpose in life is directly tied to the gifts God has placed in our life why would God give you a gift if he doesn't want you to use it now he wants you to use it in his time and season right and it has to be according to his time his purpose his season his word all those five must I program taught us it must be according to those but remember that he gave everybody talents he gave everybody a gift we were born to do something with that gift and we got to make sure we do it I like this quote where he said and the angel said this is all to indicate that you were born to pray for sick people well what did I know about praying for sick people I was just a local Baptist pastor and I looked at him again he was very kind seemed like the fear begin to leave say like that when the Angels around the fear begins to leave when the Holy Ghost is here Church the fear begins to leave amen when you start singing God's praise when you start quoting God's Word that's when the fear goes haha hey man and I said sir I'm uneducated I could do no such things as you have you've told me to do because he had just said that you'll go to all the world you'll be praying for Kings potentates monarchs and how could I do that when I was just a grammar school education see I never received the Holy Ghost as yet so God even told him before he received the Holy Ghost what are you supposed to do so God might tell you the same you might know well God gave me this I was born to do that but you might not be born again so the thing to do is get born again and then do what God's called you to do like geez like Jesus told the disciples they all had their preaching gifts they all had the ability to cast out Devils but he said go wait until you're gonna do with a power from on high then you'll be a witness then you won't deny me in front of a little made girl that's accusing you and your life is on the line and you won't deny me you'll stand up for me so get even you might know or make me you don't know but even if you don't know the thing to do is get born-again live a holy life you know holiness is the purpose of God let God make you more holy and then get power and then God will show you what to do with your life amen he said these things are strange to me and I know nothing about them and I looked up again to speak to him and I said sir I could not do that and he said as Moses was sent with two gifts to prove to the people to vindicate that he had been son of God you are given two gifts amen so God's going to give you something to prove to you see his gifts was proving to him and to everybody else that God had sent him amen and that's what God does with your gift God has given you gifts in your life to prove to you and other people that God is with you that God's going to help you do these things right hope you can see that see this is what I want to show this to brother Graham tells the same story of the angel he said watch God puts it right back in the people's lap you were going to pray for sick people if you can get them to believe so God will first tell you your gift but say oh it's in your lap now you've got to be responsible with that gift amen praise God you can't just try to be half hazard with it you in other words you can't ignore it you can't forsake it you got to be devoted to the gift God has given to you just like with the talents you got to go invest it you got to go make sure it gets more it gets greater so God will give you something God's giving you something but now you have to invest in it I said they won't believe so see he keeps putting back on him well what God's giving you it well they won't believe so the angel keeps giving more answers try to get off his doubt away he said I'll give you two signs buy this they'll believe notice then these signs they were they've rallied for them the signpost instead of the Commission believing they that you were sent to pray so responsibility comes with gifts and this is my brother Brandon said God doesn't manifest more gifts in people's lives it's because he can't trust them yet they're not as faithful as they need to be with the gift in other words they don't pray about their gift they don't even meditate on their gift they don't study the Bible about their gift so God doesn't let those gifts manifest in their life because you have to be trustworthy with the gift how many understand that so God what God will give you a gift but then he puts it right back in your lap now what are you gonna do with that what are you gonna do with it did brother Branham sit at home then and just have a home service after this meeting with the angel no he started a church and he got the preaching and he preached free free until he went to special meetings then until God exploded his ministry right then went around the world seven times he had something to do with that he couldn't send there knew nothing he had to act on what he knew the Bible said look God even honored him in his ignorance because he was the least trying to do something with what God told him to do that's what you and I need a new church if we're not sure what to do everything to do let's do something with what God's given us but see now most people just sit back it and in any Church not just message churches but any church they just sit back and let the preacher do everything right let the song leader do everything not really realizing that God has placed something in our lives and were responsible to God with the talents he's given to us praise God that's what we're gonna get to eventually is this gift in your life for you you need to be identify and say what is God done supernaturally in my life that has blessed people or helped other people what is God calling me to do and then once you know you got to give yourself to that Feast of the trumpets I love this and so will it be with the bride and so it is on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many loss and blind how many sinners was there in the world the hour I got saved I think about that how many of my friends were out there that could have been saved but yet God chose me God let the rest of my friends go through college get drunk and live worldly lives and get divorces and in and out of in more relationships but yet God called me out of all those people hey man see God knew what he was doing God had a plan and God's gonna perfect and finish that plan we just gotta walk according to the plan God save me for a purpose and I'm determined not lazy I'm determined by his will to do that purpose I don't care what anything else goes I want to do it so church you need determination if you're gonna fulfill God's purpose in your life you've got to be determined you got to be focused you got to know God called me to do this I'm not gonna let anything discourage me praise God hallelujah so he was determined even at 55 years old 64 I'm determined to do my purpose in life now here's the smile I was sharing with brother Jose and the eye or when I see the churches they're great glamour the rich had need of nothing layer to see and they say see the mismo wretched blind they pat you on the shoulders want you to compromise with them he said I was born for a purpose that's the condemned that thing and called out he said this I do I was born to pray for sick people and I was born to condemn the Laodicean lazy boys I was born to condemn the legacy in spirit of how they're rich and increased with Goods oh just compromise just say we're all saving just say we're all the same we're not all the same he said I was can I was born to condemn that in other words I was born to call out that Antichrist spirit now I didn't get to Jeremiah one maybe I'll get to that next time cuz I got to keep going I didn't set a timer here this is my first timer sit now you remember this brother branham asked why would God bring me here you ever wondered that why did God bring me to Akron why did God bring me to Ohio why did God bring me here and this is at the end of brother branham's life you remember this story brother man he I'll just go through it quickly he's how in Arizona and he doesn't know he's asking God God he doesn't see God moving like he did this at the end of his life and God called him away from Jefferson billion a house paid off a house through the church there a parsonage he had he said a growing thriving Church and God called him out of that church to Arizona he said I said well I had to come out here and separate myself come to this desert and I thought wonder why God would bring me to a desert out there where there's nothing but scorpions and gila monsters never wonder that why would God call me out here well I have wonder that many times why would God call me to Pastor a small church all I want is a big church so I can just pastor full time that's what my flesh wants I like to just devote all my energy to preaching but it seems like God didn't call me to that as much as I might like that but you wonder why did God bring me out here and so you remember the story I read it Bota have said not only is it a natural desert it's a spiritual desert can anybody relate to that I feel like Akron is a pretty spiritual desert place we don't see people getting saved all the time right it's a pretty much a spiritual desert why would God call us out in the desert and he said see even though it's a natural desert he said we've got that's the teach us a lesson that we have to stand under the Spirit of God and your life becomes sweet and tender like water brings this grass and soft buds in Arizona it won't grow these trees would be cactus these leaves just wind up and make snickery that's the way it is when you get dry around the church everybody's sticking to one another you know hope we're not poking each other and bothering each other right with thorns every time I go around Jose I'll chose it why you got to say that Malachi oh man okay why you gotta say those things hope we're not sticking each other around the church if we are we're in a real desert place but you don't do that I know Jose doesn't do that now Qaeda knew that so say he said even then even the natural things are to point us the spiritual things so church the reason actor in such a desert place is to remind us that in the midst of a desert we've got to receive the waters of God we've got to be the ones because on the day of judgment God's going to ask us you later to see a rich blind wretched all these things naked miserable but yet you overcame that God's going to say you did it because you saw the conditions and you chose to live above those conditions you receive the former aid and if we live to the rapture will receive the latter rain amen but you have to swirl they they go after the natural things they go after the big church a big money all these things but we've got to go after Christ so then the spiritual desert is even they're supposed to remind us to be spiritually on fire do you mean a spiritual spot where we love Jesus Christ with all of our hearts and some something said to me maybe you're ratting on God's job so even Satan's whispering in his mouth well maybe a whisper in his ear maybe maybe you're not serving God enough maybe you're not you're not doing the right way so I prayed for a vision and Meeta just got me a new Bible and brother Brown from Ohio that's the man that I met brother Brown brother Tom Brown he's passed on now I stayed at his house one time up from Ohio got me a new Bible both them at the same time at Christmas I went got one of the new Bibles I said Lord the days gone by you had Urim and Thummim let me say this he says let me say don't do this it's not a good thing but I said Lord I used to be when a dreamer dreamed a dream they took it down the Urim and Thummim and told it and if the Urim Thummim flashed the lights back in a supernatural light the dream was true I said but the priesthood that the Urim and Thummim has done away with your Bibles Hyrum Thummim now Lord may I never do this again but I've asked you and prayed to you to give me a vision speak to me about why I'm dreaming these dreams what have I done if I've harmed if I've done anything to any person in the world let me know I'll go make it right look at that does that sound like a real godly repentance he's not seeing God he's wondered God called him away from everything that was growing and thriving in Jeffersonville and now he's out in the desert all alone the preachers won't invite him to preach he's saying God show me a vision why am I here I wonder why I'm here he's if I'd done anything to anybody let me know how go make it right and yet the whole time he's right amen the whole time he's wondering am i right saying saying you didn't read it you read it out God's job you didn't do the right thing and the whole time he's right before God talk about mind battles Church now this is a mind battle for a 55 year old man who has gone around the world seven times he's done everything he could for Jesus Christ and this is the mind battle he puts on a 55 year old Christian veteran who's got the sword of the Spirit he's got all the armor of God on and this is the battle looks like you're out here doing nothing for God looks like God sent you out here to separate you because you just have a nun faith you have a nun good enough job God give me a vision God why my other show me why God doesn't give a vision so his last resort is to say God I'm gonna open this Bible and whenever I point to just show me what you want me to be show me why I'm out here his last-ditch effort can I say like that he prayed he's asked for visions no answer so he opens his Bible and I said surely there's something the Word of God from Genesis to Revelation to some character that you dealt with would be the same basis that would be my question anyone ever ever anyone ever have any questions for God if somebody has done something you get after them about it then let me turn to that place in the Bible and if somebody whatever they've done it'll lean my way where I've done wrong or something you want me to do haven't done let me see the character in the Bible like that I closed my eyes just that my Bible fall open and my finger on a scripture Genesis 24/7 let me read that he just let the Bible fall open Genesis 24/7 the Lord God of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto the I see will I give this land he shall send His angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence amen that's Abraham telling Eliezer go out and find a wife for my son Isaac and the angel of the Lord will be with you yet this whole time he's like where's the angel where's the vision where's all these things and yet God showed him there he's with you you're just going through trial praise God he said he was being set to hunt the bride for Isaac children over me sure that's that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the bride so God called him out away from Jeffersonville so he could go preach at other places out there in the Arizona area because he says it next he said Justin I'm skipping down just the perfect message back to the word go get that bride that's my dude that's where I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out a bride he said I'm in Arizona to try to call out a bride so the muscleman bride members that would not have heard about Jesus unless brother Branham had moved out there amen look at Arizona now look at all the churches out there serving God look at that so God had to separate him from his family everything he loved the growing thriving church and had to let him go through these mind battles in order to fulfill the purpose of being Eleazar amen hallelujah so his first commission was in 1946 the angelic visit in the cave see he said May 7th 1946 Green Mill Indiana there was an angel come the room where I was out a man talking and that's where he said about the two gifts he said that was the Commission he said you're born this world to pray for sick people and if you get two people to believe you will be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer that was the Commission it's Anna's first Commission in 1946 then you remember in 1962 God kind of changed it a little bit and God took him away from going out and praying for the sick people and told him to stay in Jeffersonville and store up tapes in 1962 this is from April so I remember Abraham said in the dream I had there not long ago I in this dream I was supposed to be storing up food in this tabernacle you see here in the dream how many members in a few weeks ago I couldn't give you the interpretation of it and it won't take me very long I'll just tell you if we'd like to hear it nobody says Amen so brother Mayer had a dream with his wife and the dream he saw George six-second Smith training and beating men up in the boxing ring and he said dreams are funny no a just I looked at my wife in the dream I said wife you know he'd give me my first training and then you know the dreams are funny I come down to a big seat so it went from a boxing ring where he sees this first trainer and it switches over to a sea where there's a bow and two men in the boat and the waters are real choppy and meet it wasn't with me then my wife and the boatsman come over here and handed me a little canoe about two foot and a half three foot lungs that sound like a good boat 2 by 3 I'm like a good boat you want to sail the seven season two by three see God's not trying to confuse us he's not the author of confusion looking Church look closely at your dreams look closely at the Word of God that's been preached to you look closely at it God's not trying to hide it from us it was a real white just plastic and he said here's your bow and I said oh I couldn't cross him that he said well that'll run 50 miles an hour up and up down this way I said am i up and down the shore but it won't out there he said well go with them and I looked in here said brother Woods and brothers fred sauceman the two brothers was with me the night I dreamed the dream and they were setting the green canoe with a lot of rigging in at camp and rigging tents and so forth they're sitting there he said go with them I said they're not even boat men I know that I said I'm a boat man I know about the canoe to handle it but they'll never they couldn't make it I wouldn't go like that anyhow so they're sitting in this 2 by 3 boat with all their camping gear in there saying let's go sail across this ocean but the man said I can't go like that he said well they love you he said well why don't you go back here and store up how many one know the interpretation of this dream say no this interpretation so I went back in the little place where we've been out a little place called Klondike about 40 miles from any civilization one little store for the ranchers and things look like it was a Klondike and it turned out to be this tabernacle so after the the CC and they went to this naik and it turned out to be a tabernacle and I was standing there calling in great barrels of the prettiest food I ever seen radishes three foot long turnips greens potatoes everything he said stole in plenty of it see how his standing there just storing it in then brother man woke up and here's the interpretation of that but the random said George Smith represented brother Rams first training in the prayer lines so Mena and brother bran were saying there there that's my first trainer that was my first training was in the prayer lines in other words the first pole the boat represented going overseas on an invitation from brother Argan bright brother argan bright wanted to set up meetings where they preach one service and then the rest of it would be a vacation and brother may have said no there's not even enough preaching to call me across the sea in other words I shouldn't go across the sea for just one service he said so there's the interpretation of the dream and then as they went along brother argabright cancelled the meetings so everything he had set up to go across the seas got cancelled it didn't work out and God was showing him that he's to stay home and store up tapes and Meeta had to tell me that she didn't want to go so first they wanted to go and then she said I didn't she didn't want to go and brother are termites called and said we have to leave on the 20th of May she said that's out that's out the children's just taken their examination then can't go so the children going to school and taking a test was a sign to brother Branham that he can't take his family overseas you see how brother branham a valued education you see how we should value our education for our children brother man took this as a sign all the kids got to take their tests it's the it's the end-of-the-year test they can't leave so we can't go overseas and have a preaching and a vacation trip see how important education is Church see she had it turned down herself because she was the one included it was her vacation and there it was even dreams everything's for a meaning everything has got something somewhere so dreams have interpretations now what I am to do is these things I'm teaching on here storing up this food and getting them up I want to go now I have no definite leading to any place but I'm going sowing seeds sent by somewhere or by some sent by somewhere started so that was on April 1st program told this dream that he had about storing up food and then he goes from April May June July August September October November December he goes for nine months preaching at the Bram Tabernacle mostly storing up all these tapes and then he you know this morning and that morning on April 1st he took his text to preach wisdom versus faith and he said now what are we doing trying to this morning follow what the Lord said lay up food amen so brother branham's Commission was in 1946 go pray for the sick people but then he had a dream in 1962 to go overseas but then God told him don't take it it's not going to work the boat's not big enough store up food so he follows this next leading of the Lord what am I saying Church we have to follow the voice of the Holy Spirit from one leading to the next leading if you don't know where God caught or what you're supposed to be doing look to the last time that God called you to do something when was the last time your knew you knew you were walking the perfect will of God and go with that praise God go with that brother who stayed with that he stayed with doing the will of God until God gave him a fresh leadership or a fresh word from heaven hey hallelujah and he did it through a dream the first one was by an angel and then God gave these supernatural dreams to get him to stay home and store up tapes for nine months and then in December of 1962 you know he got his new Commission and that was to go out west praise God in services as the end time brother Rams telling the vision of when he saw the seven angels form the cloud and I'm just going to skip ahead he said Lord what this vision mean and then it come to me not a voice just me oh that the angel of the Lord coming to give me my new commission and when I thought that I just raised up my hand said Oh Lord Jesus what will you have me to do amen now he had been told this vision in 1956 so he had to wait seven years for the interpretation are we willing to wait seven years Church for God to show us the interpretation it away seven years the provision was in 1956 he talks about the third pole seven years waiting on the Lord I think that was hard might have been but Church if you waited upon the Lord if you're a real eagle you won't get discouraged you'll renew your strength Amen Alleluia so went from 1946 to 1963 basically on one commission that you know the last nine months of it yeah he stayed home there but then in 1963 he knew him to go out west a new Commission and that was the third pole because he says it anoint it ones at the end time third pole the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than profits but the only way the profit can be vindicated I'm sorry yeah is by the word and remember the third pole was the opening of them seven seals two real the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word all right is everybody okay with that by God's grace I'm closing with this let me close with this this young man's life so we can see the purpose in brother Adams life clearly he was called to pray for the sick he was called to condemn organizations can already see it okay and he stayed with his Commission that he knew God had called him to stay with he stay with that till God did something new in his life and church we have to do the same thing we can't get discouraged well God when you're gonna do something new God when are you gonna reveal this to me we've got to stay positive we've got to stay in love with Jesus we've got to not look to symptoms not look to circumstances but look to the Word of God amen don't get discouraged don't get discouraged in waiting don't get defeated stay strong stay confident be comforted this very thing the thing that God started you he'll perform it to the day of Jesus Christ we're talking about your purpose we're talking about the purpose God placed you on this earth now one look at this humble little boy there's garnet peak 15 years old he's diagnosed with polio I think he lived one or two years I just want to close with this because I was listening to this week and I was just so encouraged because remember God had a plan for brother Branham and listen God had a plan for this little boy even though he died at 16 or 17 God still had a purpose for him and I think this would be humbling for us to see here tonight that no matter what your life looks like God had a plan for it and you have to be able to look back at or look at your life and see what did God call me to do what is God's purpose for my life and we must accept God's purpose for our lives now brother Branham is giving the funeral he's preaching the funeral of garnet peak and this is at the end of 63 I believe yeah the end of 63 and he's preaching you can hear he's preaching to his mother and father and family members of a boy who just passed away sixteen or seventeen year old boy now I said this little cold frame laying here none of us can say but what he's a part of the great economy of God's creation he's a part of God's creation he's a man a human being that God created he lay sleeping now the thing of it is is if he served God's purpose in his life then there's got to be a resurrection for garnet there's no way of getting around it he said this is not the end of garnet so if we God's purpose there'll be a resurrection for us he said I'm so happy as far as I know within the reach of my understandings by the Word of God and by the witness of the Holy Spirit this boy met that condition he was born of the Spirit of God a changed man the Spirit of God was upon the little fella he was a staunch Christian he served God's purpose maybe it was for a short time but sometimes God trains men for years to get a few days of service out of him John the Baptist here's examples John the Baptist was 30 years by himself in the wilderness for six months of service six times three is what I'm sorry six times 30 is what 180 God trained him for thirty years in the wilderness for a hundred eighty days of service 180 days and when God described in Isaiah he said the mountains will be brought down and the valleys will be raised up for a hundred eighty days of preaching that's how powerful preaching and repentance is hey I didn't hear you praise God amen and the Bible said he had no miracle other than the miracle of repentance and water baptism amen 180 days and you just went through 365 in 2018 he said sometimes God will train a man for years for just a few days of service not goodness he said Jesus Christ was 30 years old for three and a half years of service for the crucifixion God trains men brings him up it's his purpose time is with man eternity is with God I believe God brought this little boy here on earth for a purpose and if you notice right the time of his sickness and things this struck him for a purpose brother Branham said polio was part of God's purpose that's what brother Branham says God could have made the boy sound and well but what he do instead of taking his life he let him get up just where he wasn't going to die so the his test his story as he would get sick call brother Branham he get better he gets sick but I call brother and me he keep getting better and better and better better he says but neither did polio kill him he didn't die by polios actually influenza killed him he didn't die from polio he said no other disease killed him that we prayed for he and I so every disease they prayed for God healed him now the last one brother Graham couldn't pray him for because he was in a service preaching and as soon as he got out he went to pray for him but the brother said he died at 6 p.m. so he did have a chance to pray for him he said and all the rest of the Christians around here prayed for him it never it never did that he said it was Garn it's time to go he must he had served his purpose a 17 year old boy had served his purpose he come to Christ he'd been Germanized Dorie what if he would have died before being germanized polio drove him to God amen hallelujah think about job's trials Jerome's trial seeing his children die draw we're not to the devil and drove him to God amen hallelujah polio drives this man this young boy to God sometimes we think why did God allow this sure all trials are supposed to direct us to God polio drove him to God now listen he was to be a tobacco auctioneer what he had his money I said it wrong earlier not a tobacco planter a farmer up tobacco auctioneer can I get 25 25 25 about 30 - 30 35 40 40 40 145 pity pity is that ridiculous or what that's what he wanted to be that was in his mind oh if I could just grow up and be an NBA basketball player that's the same thing as saying oh if I could just grow up and be a tobacco auctioneer so because he had this in his mind brother Branham said that's what he had in his mind but that wasn't his purpose at all hey man how do I know yeah we knew that his purpose was to be a Christian hallelujah what was your desire before you became a Christian I was to go to the NFL that was my desire and be a week of rich so I could buy my mom a house that was my desire but now I'm trying to praying that God will give Jesus my mother a house in the New Jerusalem that's my prayer now he said now if he was a tobacco auctioneer somebody might have said maybe 78 five years from now if the world should stand that long garnet was a great auction ear maybe that's all the minister could have said to this funeral he was a great auction hear how sad is that how sad would that be if somebody said oh he was just a great accountant all she was was a great baseball player but instead brother man said but what can we say today he's a Christian as an auctioneer without the germ of life that's just a memory of that generation he done among a few men but now he's amongst the immortal I'll tell ya Laurie a tobacco auctioneer might get you some praise of men a few men right but a life lived a Christian life Dermott eyes that the Holy Ghost will get you all kinds of shouting and rejoicing with the presence of the Angels amen hallelujah buh-bam said the last time I spoke to him I said brother garnet if you knew that you could be well and strong like these other boys run up and down the roads here with your hot rod running up and down the roads and drinking alcohol and would not know this message that I know he said garnet said I wouldn't swap this for ten thousand lives like that amen in other words if you could give up the polio you'd have to give up Christ but then you could have all this time running around on hot rods he said I wouldn't give up Christ for 10,000 lives on a hot rod with drunks and women and all things like that he said that was a real true Christian praise God a young I'm sorry eighteen year old boy so I said seventeen eighteen eighteen year old boys find handsome looking young men would probably been a regular target for the devil but God had to throw them in that stage of polio to get out of him to serve the purpose look at his patience his testimonies among you neighbors look what he was how this little life has spoke to so many of you that at the day of judgment his life will testify right back against you he says he was an example of what God wanted him to be he served God's purpose that's Ann Murphy well of course we hate to see this young man lying there like that just look like in the prime of life but you know he says when you take a flower out of your flower garden to make a bouquet you don't always take the old ones he says sometimes you have to take a bud a bud has to serve your purpose in a bouquet he said maybe God wanted a bud and that's what he picked on here for a bud for his altar in glory amen hallelujah with a guarantee of everything testifying that he will rise again our face as he right he'll rise again the word says arise again the moon the Stars the Sun the flowers nature everything says he'll rise again I'll tell you why because the seed of eternal life was planted and germanized in his soul so he says all these things testify that he'll rise again praise God I'll stop right there by the grace of Lord you can switch over to songs here how many appreciate that testimony y'all appreciate that testimony I heard that this week and I'm about blew me all out of my shoes eighteen year old boy God says I've I've got to get him somehow to not love tobacco auctioneering I've got to drive him to me because I know he wants to serve me I got a drive how can I do it I'll allow polio to go he gets polio and it drives and he gets sick and brother BAM said every time he go over there he was laying in his bed instead of laying his bed he wasn't laying down he was sitting up doing Bible studies with the neighbors polio studying the Word of God a real staunch Christian serve his purpose in life to all those boys around there Malka he can come up here all the boys all the young 18 year old boys around there riding around getting drunk we got here's the 18 year old boy with polio studying the scripture this is what the Bible says you must be born again amen hallelujah and God said I'd like to bring that young bud that bud of a flower that young beautiful flower I like to bring that up to my throat and decorate my altar with that praise God God is not the author of confusion Church God has a purpose for all

God will use polio to drive a person to be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost God and his great plan is a great understanding they'll use it before he'll get there before the devil gets in there to try to make him a tobacco auctioneer I imagine he be chewing tobacco spitting it while trying to auction off the tobacco but God in His wisdom said I'll get to him first I'll bring the message I'll send my prophet not a new you I'm not going to send anybody I'll send my prophet to him and I'll heal him each time to this last time I'll show my power all these times and then I'll bring him whole
