TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] this morning by the grace of god let's go to the book of first john chapter two i just want to start a short little series here i just like to look at the spirit of pride but i just want to call it overcoming pride by god's grace overcoming pride kind of goes with the doctrines of devils series we were looking at recently um so i like to just call it overcoming pride first john chapter 2 verses 15 through 17. again it's great to see everybody today and last sunday i missed the clap for sisterhood's birthday i know we did the sunday before but let's clap again by god's grace god bless you sister sorry i missed that you know last weekend was a crazy busy weekend okay i felt like i was going to die on monday but but i felt bad i was driving home i'm like ah yesterday was sister who's birthday so i'm sorry god bless you and hope you had a great weekend this weekend my god it's great so hallelujah we got some may birthdays coming up lena's in may right and anyone else in may okay brother james all right brother james so praise the lord yeah i got a list there but i didn't look i just remembered that's right i got to remember that one that one got to add austin's october october 15th by god's grace hallelujah god a couple maze coming up here first john chapter 2 verse 15. and hopefully as you know hopefully as we minister this morning or as the holy spirit ministers through me uh you'll see why this is such a crucial subject because i believe as far as right now i could be wrong but i believe pride is the evil spirit that we will battle the most and fall to the most the spirit of pride that's just my my understanding of it right now i could be wrong but i feel like that's what i've seen in brother branham's life my life the scriptures i feel like pride is the evil spirit that we will be deceived by the most or just willingly give into the most and of course we'll have to repent for our sins and that god is faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in the light as he's in the light first john 2 15. i'll read 15 and 17 and we'll all read 16. so let me read 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him let's read 16 1-3 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world i love verse 17 and the world passeth away don't we see it passed away all the time this person that person that trend that idea that thought the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever how many want to buy it forever how many would say pray for me and let's pray for one another that god helped me to obey the word of god that i can live live forever abide forever let's my hands up too let's pray heavenly father we just come reverently this is the way you set up lord to strengthen your people was by the preaching of the word the world calls it foolishness but to us it is the power of god so lord let your power rest upon each one of us lord as we heard with brother dennis lord whatever state we're in may the power of god may we be content in the state we're in lord in obedience and lord may the power of christ rest upon us this morning lord as i've looked at this subject now for weeks and weeks lord and just kind of waiting lord i've just i've just been convinced this is the sin i fall to the most this is the sin lord we see that believers fall to the most so help us dear god help us lord as we revisit this subject lord god i pray god that we would overcome pride hallelujah and we would have the real spirit of humility that christ had where he said i can do nothing except the father shows me first so god may we always do what you tell us to do first in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i think for the sake of this message i think i'll start with a quote here from brother branham in just a moment but just a few thoughts about our text here from 1st john we see the three channels of temptation these are the channels eve battled in the beginning and for the very first temptation adam as well and they're the same temptations jesus battled when satan met him face to face and so these are the channels that you and i must battle every single day of our lives i'm thankful you know we battle sometimes we go through difficult seasons i'm thankful for the seasons of rest aren't you when i feel like i can take a deep breath and i can just enjoy serving the lord and i don't have the intense battles but then there are those weeks those months you know god forbid years when people get really awful diseases or sicknesses or like in the case of my father you know years of depression where they go and this of course self-imposed many of these times you know self-inflicted but there are going to be those long seasons where we're going to need to trust in god we're going to need someone anointed to the holy spirit to come up and give us a word of encouragement we need someone to show us a word of kindness because we don't feel very kind we need someone to show us love because we don't feel very lovely and so may god help us to be sensitive if we're in a spirit of victory help us to may god help us to have uh just love that can pour out of our lives and a manifestation of god's love that can just flow into other people this i saw yesterday there's a man he older man he's got to be in the 60s he's got to be he lost all his hair and he's you know he's got wrinkly skin uh he's the one that put in our we had to get a new fridge because other one but basically you know busted i guess but this old man worked you know for an hour to get our old fridge out and bring in the new one i wasn't there but he left his pocket knife and so we left it there at the house told him he can come pick it up any anytime it was hanging from the doorknob you know well he come right when i was leaving last night and he's just a real short guy real tiny guy and i just you know i was talking to him i just looked over and i said you know i just want to thank you i just kind of felt like i should share the love of god i said i just want to thank you for uh helping us helping our family uh get out this this old fridge and put in the new fridge and i said i believe god anointed you to do that and i said i just want to tell you i really appreciate that he's like thank you he's like oh that makes me feel really good uh and he said i've heard a saying that um the most important need is the uh the most important person is the one who meets your need that you have right at that moment and i thought isn't that the truth like let's say you got a flat tower who's the most important person to you then the person who's going to help you get on a good tire right so in other words in your hour of trial who's the most who's the most important person the person who's the servant the person who helps you at that time but we just started talking about the lord and and how every part of the body is so important you know everybody in the body of christ is so important and how god has no big ones and no no little ones they're all just god's children praise god and uh just to see his face you know turn it from like a stern to a smile by the end and by the end i'm like god bless you man god jesus loves you jesus loves you i said never forget jesus loves you and he drives away and he's waving goodbye we're waving divine just a good example of how we can be such a light to other people just reminded me of how we we got to be there and lift people up praise god and try to try to put a smile on their face by the grace of god the bible said a merry heart maketh medicine hallelujah but you know we're going to not getting back to this we're going to battle these three channels and and we want to be when we're strong we want to be strength to other people we want to be an example the bible said when you're young be an example unto the believers praise god hallelujah so we're going to battle these three throughout the seasons of our lives but like joshua remember we're going to stay with that joshua theme here since god bless us with so many great thoughts and revelations in there and blessings we can conquer and possess all the gates of the enemy hallelujah so the the pride of life is a very i say a major gate of the enemy in other words there's areas of there's uh in in the in the inheritance god has for us in god's plan for our lives in order to conquer all of it one of the major gates is pride and we've got to be able to conquer that gate we've got to be able to approach that and we've got to conquer that by humility praise god and then can i say it like this you know we'll drive back the gates we'll move the gates we'll possess the land but if we're not careful we we we won't drive it out all the way how many want to drive it out all the way praise god there's so many good thoughts in here but i want to just read this quote this is from influence november 14th 64. brother bam said any man is subject to mistakes he's subject to heir because he's human he's subject to the violations of god's laws and he's subject to many things because satan tempts him and he is just a human being now we got to balance that out with you're more than a conqueror you're an adopted son of god your soul doesn't sin amen right with all those are all true all those statements are true but at the same time you are just a human can we all say i'm just a human i'm just a human now we should not continue in sin that grace may abound but we should remember that we have a human element we won't get the victory over it fully on this side and there's going to be times when we feel just like a human we don't feel divine we don't feel inspired we don't feel anointed we don't feel like a conqueror in fact we feel like a failure i know when i get a chance i want to look up that quote where brother bam says sometimes i don't even feel like i'm saved and see what year that was maybe i can look it up real quick feel like i just had that thought i'm saved well that's 51. praise god 51. so he had already been preaching i started his revival in 46 as worldwide revival in 46 so he already had five years in he said sometimes i don't even feel like i'm saved he says he's just a human being and if god now listen listen this here's what i want you to get this why am i starting with this if god ever lifted his hands he would fall that's all so let me say like this in your soul you are sealed to the day of redemption and the church said in your soul you don't sin and the church said but god has his hand over your mind and your body as a hedge and he can remove that hedge if he wants so never remove the seal because it's sealed to the day of your redemption but if he chooses he could remove that hedge from your body right because satan could put a disease on your body if god removes the hedge or he could remove that hedge around your mind where you don't have the sound mind you once had take that back to the scripture god left hezekiah for a season to test him after he got his 15 years of extra life god left the anointing on his mind god took that hedge around and now he he got all prideful he said yeah you babylonian guys can come in you can check out the house of god little did he know they'd go back and they'd make a plan to come and steal all the things from the house of god a huge mistake major mistake where god said it would have been better for you to die so brother madam says if god ever lift his hands you would fall that's all so how did you get here today god's hand was on you amen hallelujah praise god amen you didn't get here by your power you got here by god's power amen brother man said i've heard people say oh satan can't do that in other words satan can't get to them brother brahm said yes you just let god lift his hand one time and watch what happens i was listening to this in the car yesterday i'm like what oh my goodness you just let god lift his hand one time and watch what happens he says i constantly plead god don't send him speaking of satan keep mercy on me keep satan away from me you see i need god's mercy and we all need that a prophet's constant prayer yet he saw visions all the time but like that brown bear vision video showed he can you can disobey visions still be a child of god and i got a good testimony a family said thank you so much for this video we love the message but we had so many doubts they said now that you made this video our family you've dissolved all of our doubts hallelujah we're strengthening souls one at a time amen hallelujah thank you jesus but brother adam says here that if god doesn't protect him he would fall and he was constantly praying so in and out of visions in and out of praying for sick and then in in that in between time who is he praying for himself church it's okay to pray for yourself i know you're not supposed to pray for yourself more than other people but when you do pray for yourself amen when you do pray for yourself say god please keep your hand of mercy on me please don't remove the hedge about my body and my mind amen because if he ever did you'd surely fall i'd surely fall no doubt about it amen if god didn't protect us and keep us we'd fall and personally i think we'd most easily fall into pride because the other two are so obvious the lust of the eyes and the pride of life i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry lust of the eyes lust of the flesh right so that's a quote i need to bookmark that one and i need to make a reminder revisit that quote again re when i'm struggling i need to see that go i need to hang that quote up on my wall we need to constantly bleed that god does not take his hand away from us and god have mercy on me hallelujah now what's a modern definition of pride as we move on it is consciousness of one's own dignity or honor so in other words you're aware of how dignified you are or how honorable you are it's also the quality of having an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance well in my opinion i'm pretty great in my opinion i'm very important goodness gracious help us jesus amen in my opinion i deserve a lot of honor in my opinion i'm a very dignified person i'm a very respectful person that's the new oxford dictionary definition of pride so see as we just maybe preach a few sermons on this we'll see lord willing we need to have the right opinion of ourselves but it cannot be uh an excessively high opinion of ourselves so you want to have the opinion i am more than a conqueror but you got to you got to have this a part of your opinion as long as i humble myself and obey god's word amen amen hallelujah i am more than a conqueror as long as i pray before i make major decisions amen as long as i read my bible i'm praying as long as i seek the kingdom of god first amen then i'm more than a conqueror hallelujah then i'm an adopted child of god hallelujah see so we don't want pride excessively high opinion of ourselves to creep into our lives we don't want to think we're more important than we really are like we're joking out there about you know your job if you don't show up if you die they're going to replace you the next day they might have a moment of silence let's have a moment of silence for mr smith all right back to work guys you know let's go i don't even know if they do that but you know that's brother madam calls it dog eat dog that's the way in the world right and that's why we can never let things of the world become more important than the things of god that's why we must always put the things of god first in our lives and above everything else i'm just remember reminding of uh reminding of a family that used to come here that fell away from the message uh and i'm not bad mouthing them but i'm just saying they ne god was never first in their life whenever a family would come they'd skip church right or live stream but you know if you're live streaming at home you've got family visiting are you really paying attention to the sermon are you really amending it like you should and singing along like you should it's not the same as being with the saints and just you know without god being number one that shows the the pride of life had entered in family is more important i'm taking my family above the church above the word of god pride in other words just like eli in other words i'm giving my family more honor than jesus christ and the church that's what eli did so because eli did that his office was removed from his his uh offspring right he honored his sons more than god well just like any family can do today they can honor friends or family or money or riches or pride or whatever they can magnify that they can honor that above god and the bible said pride always goes before what the fall that's what we want to avoid by god's grace a fall may our falls be very small i want small falls i want i can i say like this i want private falls where i don't fall publicly and it brings a disgrace upon the name of jesus christ now before i forget remember on wednesday or last sunday no last friday i was preaching and i was talking about how um i'm just going to add this in here so i don't forget remember brother i was talking about brother ramsey's death by a car accident right and the thought that i like behind now this is totally unrelated but the thought behind that uh that i like from the brother i went and listened to it again this week to follow up with with my church because i love you so much i want to keep my word to you but the thought was um just because brother ram died in a car accident doesn't mean he was a false prophet he said if that and here's the thought if that was the case what about all these false prophets he said the hospitals will be full with all these false prophets that are on the internet right now and the church said and yet these false prophets get to live to their 70 80 have their own private planes natural blessings are no sign of god's approval on your life amen now it might be if you're humble and you're private but i'm talking about in general a natural blessing not is not necessarily proof that you're right with god because if anybody was right with god it was that humble prophet praise god who turned down riches and and cadillac's and all these things he turned that down and he he left his family he forsook the family and he left jeffersonville to go out uh and go to arizona and receive the revelation and he just forsook everything for the ministry if anybody deserved to live it was him but now these present-day prophets they can they've already uh they've already lied so many times it's just it's coming out there's just there's total there's complete youtube pages by atheists that are dedicated to mocking these christian false prophets and they have hundreds of thousands of views it becomes a sport to them because they're so obviously false so just the way someone dies doesn't mean that they were a false if it's a it's a tragic death it doesn't mean they were a false prophet so that's what i want to share with you last friday it slipped my mind forgive me so i got that off my checklist okay all right so church we don't want to excessively high opinion of ourselves and really as our brother dennis preach which is my life scripture john 15 5 jesus said apart from me you can do nothing so let's have the right opinion i'm nothing let's all say that ready i'm nothing that's that's the best opinion i'm nothing if any good comes out of my humble little insignificant tiny little life then it was jesus that did it and i finally got on the way so he could do something with me praise god then he gets the glory then i'm going to surely throw the crown at his feet not my feet amen in other words i don't have this crown unless you overcame you conquered for me praise god now the bible uh or lexicon greek definition of pride is self-confidence oh my another definition is boasting which means self-satisfied talk about one's achievements or compliments look what i've done boy i am so satisfied with what i've done i have i have really done something i have really achieved it's you're so satisfied with yourself i have arrived i have made it that self-confidence now we see in peter's life right on the night of jesus erection or arrest rather jesus said you're all going to deny me tonight and peter said i will not i'll die with you i'll die for you i'll not deny you he said before the crack crows you'll deny me three times and he said where's a sword give me a sword self-confidence now the beautiful part church the beautiful part is that even jo even though jesus told him that when they went to the garden jesus said here's your escape amen here's your way out of temptation amen he said pray that you enter not into temptation praise god ah he told him he told him he told him his face he was wrong and then they went glory they went to a prayer meeting amen hallelujah that's what we need a prayer meeting amen our own individual prayer meeting hallelujah we have a prayer meeting before every service if you want to come or you can pray after church it don't matter just pray amen this is a house of prayer hallelujah but look how gracious jesus is he warns him and he says now here pray up so you don't fall here's your chance but he got tired he said i could really use a nap right now self-confidence look at that bragging i will i won't deny you i'll die for you i'll die for it but when it come to time he was too tired to back up his words help us to only say what we know god has called us to do and then say if the lord is willing praise god hallelujah help us to only say what we know is right and then say i'll do it if the lord is willing if god's willing like remember james says the bible doesn't say or james says don't say well i'm going to move next year year go to that place make some money and then come back the bible says don't boast about tomorrow say if the lord is willing i'll move there and make some money and then come back if god is willing because church how many know god has a different plan for your life than maybe what you have now in my life personally i've you know i've seen my life stay very stable since i moved to akron you know nothing out of the ordinary but church i can't be complacent i can't be prideful and think well i'm never going to move i'll always be right here i always you know i want to always be a faithful servant i always will by god's grace but i i can't be so i can't be so secure in my human mind that i'm not open to the leadership of the holy spirit i can't have self-confidence i've got to have confidence in christ confidence in christ another word is like braggadocious they say you know boasting here look let me tell you what i've done let me tell you what i'm gonna do let me tell you what i have done bragging now let's look at the first man spiritual man who fell lucifer isaiah 14 let's go there isaiah 14. isaiah 14 verse 12. i'm sorry i don't have slides you know it's just been a busy week been a but it's been a good week a good week of recovery but it's just been a busy week here isaiah 14 12. i just caught a good thought in here you know i think when brother dennis or brother simon or i can't remember his brother brian one of those preachers they were preaching and they talked about satan weakening the nations i thought ah that's a good thought isaiah 14 12 how art thou thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou has set in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will send above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit and the church said thank god hallelujah verse 16 they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that's why i said man spiritual man right because angels are all men is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake the kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners so all those ukrainian cities that are being destroyed who's doing it satan's doing that he destroys the cities he weakens the nations he makes the wilderness now i just want you to uh consider this i was thinking about this pride was the first thing that entered into satan's heart now the other scripture says he was lifted up because of his beauty and his wisdom and i think it's ezekiel 28. the church i don't know let's just rehearse some of these moments here before there was anything there was just god and then god said let there be light and brother man said it could have been millions millions billions of years then the pillar of fire came out a picture of fire there and then from that pillar of fire god spoke creation because the bible said god created all things by jesus christ who is the word amen so the pillar of fire started speaking the logos speaking all creation and then before the earth that light spoke angels innumerable number of angels all these angels and all the angels would have turned and seen the light there's god by that time maybe he had his seventh dimension set up you know and then god said now look down here look out here in the universe i'm going to set up the earth and god spoke the word and all of a sudden uh brother branham said that he said the earth came out of another ball of fire and i can't explain all that another burning star or something like that he said look it was a clinker out of another one so i don't know he spoke it he said that little clinker was burning he said but then it cooled off and all the angels even satan is watching that earth fly out there and then all of a sudden god said stop and the earth stopped and then when it stopped god founded the earth and set it right there and god said this is going to be my crowning planet and they're probably confused like look at all these huge planets and these huge stars this is your crowning achievement remember it was in darkness the earth was without form and what void it was just as dark and god said look angels this is my crowning achievement it was there was no green on it there was no plants it wasn't beautiful it's just water but yet the bible said all the sons of god amen all the angels the bible said they shouted for joy they said hallelujah praise god amen this dif all the all the other plants were different this one had water yet it was without former void and lucifer was right there he was shouting and praising god oh my look at this special it's it's it's the home it's the home of god's children and the bible said they all shouted for joy now church don't be deceived that wasn't you shouting for joy because brother branham said you bypassed your theophany and went from thought to flesh body and the church said you'd be surprised how many people think those sons of god shouting were christians they weren't you were in the thoughts of god you were not manifested yet those were angels and lucifer was shouting right there glory look at that they were worshiping singing lucifer was right there next to god and some sometime during a worship service he had all these pipes and tablets he was such a musician at one point he thought i am very wise i am so beautiful i've seen god now he's been he's this pillar of fire this with this theophanies been on the throne all these millions and maybe hundreds of thousands of years man we we talk about that all the time in our house but at some point he thought i deserve this worship now how did he get to the spot where he was shouting and rejoicing about earth being created and now thinking he could make himself a throne just like god's the bible said because of pride he had a he realized wow look at me i'm actually much more beautiful than these other angels look at me i'm much more talented and i will ascend above the th of the above above the stars of the of the sky i will ascend i can be greater god made me like this but i could be greater than this now look how church look at that thought look how humble god was he made all this creation but yet he humbled himself so much he must have been so humble that even the even lucifer looked at him and said well i can be just like him i can do that now member church he had a lot of power the bible said he can transform himself didn't he take jesus the bible said he took jesus on a pinnacle in jerusalem then the bible said he took him up into a high holy mountain how does he do that he's got powers so he's able to transform himself he has all these powers he can control nature right you can only can influence the nature when god allows it we saw him here he could make deserts now the thing what i want to get to you and i for you and i is that the thing he's trying to do to you is to weaken you the bible said he weakened the nations but i want to tell you and i the thing he's trying to do is make us less strong than what we currently are praise god amen that's the thought that i got from i felt it maybe mcbride or i can't remember who it was maybe simon so consider consider your strength what is your spiritual strength today what do you think about what are you overcoming today or what have you overcome this week now satan's looking at that and through his his many servants his wicked demon servants he's trying to say how can i weaken brother vang this week how can i weaken brother jess's weak that's what he's trying to do he's not he's not going to be able to throw you away from the faith and the church said he won't be able to totally deceive you but he's going to try to weaken you so your faith is not as strong as it should be he weakens the nations and what he does he weakens churches remember brother i'm warned bradham tabernacle you're going to be weaker he said you're going to oh yeah he said brother he said random tabernacle you're going to lose your strength and he said how did it happen through gossip talking about other people see church if we got a problem let's go talk to somebody ourselves you can talk to me i like to counsel too i'll do that but there's an individual if there's an individual need you know and we need a counselor you got to go to that person or let's have a group meeting by god's grace because gossip and pride pride ultimately it weakens a church weakens us or we don't have as much joy anymore don't even we're not as zealous for the word as we should be he knows he's not going to get you to go steal or go kill or commit adultery he knows but he's trying to weaken you so he can get you to fall in some other way that will be a disgrace upon christianity or your family but here we see lucifer's pride i mean this is all this is the awful state of pride how could you ever think you could be like god how could you ever think you could have a throne and defeat the all the other angels of god now this ought to encourage us church if we're here today god's protected us to be here and if we've overcome sin this week then we're strong in the lord and the power of his mind hallelujah we're putting on the armor of god through humility through prayer by pleading with god saying don't take your hand away from me hallelujah amen but satan's goal today is to weaken you listen to less sermons read your bible less testify remember that good testimony had about testified testify less no but we should testify the same keep jesus on our lips keep jesus on our mind at all times lucifer thought he could be like the most high so church this makes me wonder how often do they see god create things because that what power separates lucifer from god lucifer is not a creator but god is a creator so i wonder if god hid a lot of the creation from the angels i wonder if everything was already there brother hosea he already had the stars all out there then the angels come in and then maybe one of the last things we placed was right there the foundation of the earth he told the angels this is going to be my crowning achievement right here my whole plan for this whole universe my whole plan is focus right there on that little that little watery dark planet that's tiny little planet comparative you've seen you've seen you've seen the comparisons earth is tidy that's where we find god god puts himself in little things amen hallelujah god's interest in the details hallelujah so we see lucifer's pride now let's learn from that church let's learn not to say i will i will i will six times let's learn to say thy will thy will thy will be done because that's the first step out of the plan of god is saying i will do this i will do that i don't need i don't need to pray about this i don't need to consider that overcoming pride how many overcoming pride by god's grace amen now let's go to genesis 3 verse 1. now let's look after satan falls himself then he goes to eve and i got a good thought from a youtube preacher i wasn't actually listening to a baptist preacher he was doing a uh he was doing a documentary on like music you know i was like well i'm interested and we just talked about that we don't want to do we always avoid rock and roll but i was listening to a music documentary and he brought this beautiful thought out about eve's deception and satan's tactics in the garden just a i maybe you heard it before i never heard it before and if i did i forgot genesis 3 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god hath made and he said in the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of the tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden by the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did eat of course the eating is a spiritual symbolism here good for food that was a spiritual aspect right because the bible says i don't know if we've done that study with austin lena have we done the serpentine study with you too not since you've been back i don't think have we well keep your place there and go to proverbs 30 verse 20. that scripture is kind of like etched on my mind it's a good thing too proverbs 30 verse 20. so eating here is not natural that's what denominations see you know and you know god bless their hearts those that are faithful there's a few saved in there and all those all those that want to see it we'll see it probably 30 verse 20. but i also want to read that for us brother proverbs 30 verse 20. amen thank you so see eating is like it unto fornication or in this case adultery right so this was we'd say adultery because eve was already promised and espoused to adam and then the satan anointed the serpent to commit this act with eve and it was adultery so it was a symbolized as eating and i preached i appreciate a few months ago i preached a few months ago how uh idolatry is spiritual intercourse idolatry so worshiping idol is actually spiritually making love to an idol evil spirit so i don't expect to remember that but i remember that so she eats it was good to be eaten which means it was a sexual thing there's a sexual relationship now i want you to notice here's the thought that the brother brought out i thought was really good satan's first tactic was to diminish the vision of god downplay god's vision and that was in verse 1. because he said yea hath god said you shall not eat the tree of the garden so god's vision was never eat the tree of the garden so his first thing is to diminish the vision are you sure that's god that's what god wants for your life for us it might be are you sure god wants you to be humble like that and just little little known and a nobody are you sure god wants you to be nobody for the rest of your life shouldn't you be somebody could you be somebody famous or popular or money or something like that should you be somebody great now god does have some of those right god does have some of the job is the richest man in the world at that time david and solomon were the richest men in the world at that time now we know what it did to some of them right we know it caused david and solomon to fall but god can have great ones among us but the bible said there's few of them most of us might like scotland remember that scripture simon brought out not many are noble right not many are great there's not many like that there could be a few like that but most of god's children are poor people or little people the bible said they're poor in this world but they're rich in faith hallelujah thank god amen god's faith has anchored in your heart that you trust in god more than riches hallelujah so satan's first thing is i'm going to diminish the vision of god well maybe my life doesn't have to be all this holiness all the time maybe i could get a tv just that's a simple example well maybe i could you know drink a little bit at home even when my stomach doesn't hurt yeah you're going the wrong way yeah i'll tell you see how brother like brother said see how far you can get away from sin don't see how close you can get to sin see how far you can get away from it so that's verse one this first thing is diminish the vision of god the second thing is he dismisses the vengeance of god in verse 4 because he says you shall not surely die now we've got to balance this out because god has grace many times but this is the first time sin has ever manifested itself on earth so he he diminishes the vision of god well god don't want it to be like that all the time and then you won't surely die i mean surely god's not going to be mad i mean you sin all the time now that's how it'd be for us what you said all the time it's okay for you to do this sin on purpose it's different it's different when we know it it's different when we don't know what the sin is and that's different when we do know what the sin is when we do know it there's a greater consequence a greater punishment or as the bible says if you don't like the word punishment to me it's a fine word but if you don't like that word it's chastisement hebrews chapter 12. god chastens every son that he loves see that's what satan's going to try to battle us on he's going to first say well you know i mean message people can do this i mean message people don't have to live like this forever brother amen you have to do that forever i mean just just when you first get saved you know no no he's diminishing the vision of god i'm growing in grace amen i'm going from glory to glory amen we're going from faith to faith the light of god shineth more unto a perfect day then he says well god's not gonna he's not you're not gonna die god's not gonna punish you he takes that away the third thing is he distorts the voice of god or he twists the voice of god for god knows god knows this god knows in the day he eat thereof your eyes will be opened and you should be as gods knowing good and evil he twists that says well you will be god's the fact was they already were gods they already were adam already was a a little g god he already he already had dominion over the whole earth and satan's telling his wife well you're not even there yet there's a greater place you could be there's a greater thing you could ascend to and god's vengeance he's not going to be met you're not going to die and you don't have to live like this forever but what is our prayer my prayer is god keep your heads about me forever amen keep a hedge on my mind keep a hedge on my body protect me hallelujah that's why the bible said pray that you enter not in temptation amen pray god keep me from evil hallelujah that's the third thing he does he distorts the voice of god well see god knows this is going to happen that's going to happen and god you know you're actually god was actually keeping you from something that some pleasure that you actually like and then the fourth thing he does he uh he causes eve to be deciding to be void of god so she leaves the plan of god she doesn't need god you can be a god so see he convinces her you can be void of god you'll be like god and you won't need to be you then you won't need god but see our attitude's different we just want to follow jesus we want to we when we get to heaven we will we want to be one place with jesus praise god hallelujah the bible said that they'll follow him wherever he goes amen they'll never lead aside his wife will serve him in the temple praise god amen so he diminishes the vision you don't have to always live like that then he says dismissed is the vengeance god's not going to punish you and then he twists the voice well god knows it's actually like this and then he gets them to decide to be void of god they don't need god and you can choose the sin and do the sin but we see jesus doing the opposite amen hallelujah even though even adam fell jesus stands there says no satan i will not bow down i will not change this bread into rock amen because i don't live by every word i don't live by bread i live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god see satan's trying to give evil live by this word this is a different word than god's word but jesus had the victory over that i will only live by the word of god remember church the bible says take heed lest you fall that's why these services like this now look i love guest preachers but these services are just regular common services these are just as important as all the other ones because if you just if you just if you if you let satan convince you that this is just a regular service and you don't pray constantly for god to hold you amen i don't know if you don't plead with god protect me keep me strong if you don't do that if you let down on god that's where satan can weaken you that'll cause you to give in to the enemy and into a fall where you've fallen short of the glory of god i believe we've got some pretty strong soldiers here today by god's grace i believe we've got some faithful watchers today that are watching for the enemy and keeping them out by the grace of god hallelujah so see we see how satan fell now pride and eve's pride remember pride is just exalting your way above god's way it's well i've got self-confidence i can interpret like eve i can interpret the word i'll take satan's i'll take the serpent's interpretation of the word i'll take that above god's word she just took that and that was a prideful thing to do exalted that exalted his interpretation above god's interpretation of the word hallelujah let's put let's go uh i'm sorry let's go to first peter five please first peter five i'm gonna hit some general scriptures here for a moment first peter 5 verse 5. in church as i said you know this is pride is what i see in the message that has attacked the message most i'm not going to show that this morning but you know at some point i want to show all the videos on that i'm still actually combine compiling some first peter verse five and as i said on that wednesday night pro i'm sorry time is the great vindicator time will show who is right and who is wrong time will show who was prideful and who was humble it'll always show because the bible said uh wisdom is justified over children and i'll say this a tree is known by its fruit whether it's a corrupt fruit sinful prideful fruit or if it's genuine holy ghost humility fruit humble fruit first peter 5 verse 6. likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resists the proud and giveth grace to the humble now there's lots of things in here bless you brother the first thing is clothe you put humility on like your garment you put on today all right i had to put on my shirt get the tie going on there i had to put it on you have to do the same thing every day you got to put on a humble attitude church can i say this you got to put on an attitude of a servant every day when you walk in these doors may god help me all of us say we're walking here lord how can i serve the people here today i'm not coming here to be served i'm coming here to serve put it on just like you did your nice sunday best here today by god's grace god resists or god opposes god is against the proud full i'm sorry the prideful rather god is against the proud but he gives grace to the humble that means the pride will the prideful will not get a lot of grace from god god will oppose them oppose them oppose them they won't get the grace that the believers will get look at verse six who's going to humble you is the preacher going to humble you is the deacon going to humble you is your mom going to humble you how about your dad your dad gonna hump you no the bible says humble yourselves in other words this is a soul decision where is the will of god brother brahm says he said the will of god free more agency is in the soul this is a soul decision now what's interesting this i don't have this mystery figured out yet but if you're seeing with the holy ghost in your soul and you have three more ages in there how does the soul be sealed but then also make decisions to be prideful so i don't have that one figured out yet i don't i'm not sure about that but it's just something to keep in mind if free more agencies in the soul well how can you have a sealed soul but yet make that decision so i'll be waiting for my questions i'll be waiting for my questions for my little girls here this evening and so see if they can stump me on that one i'll just say i don't know i don't know but it's a mystery it's a great mystery god did a great a great amazing creation when he made our bodies and our minds humble yourselves church therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time so can i say like this church it is true god wants to exalt you but it's not in your time it's in his time amen in other words god wants a city on a hill amen that's shining that everybody sees amen god wants a city on a hill he wants to exalt you but it's not in your time it's in god's time hallelujah you just got to be humble serve god obey the word and wait for it's your time where god's going to shine his light upon you remember that's a good example of joshua for all those years for 40 years he was waiting behind moses just yes yes moses yes sir yes sir okay i'll go fight that battle but all of a sudden moses died now god was going to exalt joshua praise god just wait church just wait in your place find your position brother brahma says find your position and just wait there do not leave your position brother brant said you're just as important as billy graham now he was a worldwide evangelist you're just as important as long as you stay in your position that's true that is true each part of the body is so important praise god you are just as important as me right you sisters you're just as important as the brothers hallelujah i thought i'd get a little more amen than that but that's okay maybe you're thinking about it real hard glory just as important because you're a soul that god made worth ten thousand worlds you're a soul that's very valuable in the sight of god he doesn't want to lose that soul he wants that soul to love him to serve him to worship him to do his will for their life praise god so we can't expect somebody else to hum us now maybe god will use somebody to correct us but ultimately you have to receive the correction humble yourself under the mighty hand of god and god will exalt you in due season well what do i do with all my cares brother jesse verse seven what are you doing here here's what you do with all your cares well i've gotta i've gotta take care of this i've gotta i've gotta take care of that care care right casting all your care i gotta take care of this i gotta take well what about god is god ever gonna take care of anything for us absolutely there's a lot of cares we have but he said cast your cares upon the lord for he careth for you now look at verse eight be sober now don't be too silly right it's okay to laugh for a little bit but then we gotta get back to business amen it's okay laugh and joke feel human for a little while but then we got to get sober again be sober be vigilant alert because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and i got seven minutes left on my hour hard to believe that so satan is constantly roaming about and there come a time in season where he's going to use his demons to try to attack you and roar at you but you've got to be clothed with humility praise god you've got to be clothed with power amen so that when he roars you're not shaken by the roar when he roars that's when you pull your sword out praise god hallelujah because you know he roars but he don't have any teeth right brother said he lost his teeth at calvary amen hallelujah praise god and he's as aligned he's not a lion there's only one line that's jesus christ the lion of the tribe of judah amen he's the real lion so he's impersonator lion he's a fake line and yes he can roar that still doesn't take away your ability to put on humility to put on the armor of god and stand with the word of god in hand and not be prideful but be humble because god will oppose you if you're proud but he'll exalt you if you're humble one way god does this many times is in the marriage relationships so those of us who are married you see this often in scripture uh go to first peter 3 7. first peter 3 7. yeah we're already we're heard in chapter 4 let's go to the first period of three good so brothers here we go likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessels so brothers have to acknowledge my wife's a weaker vessel but i've got to give them honor that's what i must do god's called me to be to give my wife honor and respect and as being heirs together of the grace of life so we're in this life together we're partners amen in other words you're a part of me i'm not complete without you that your prayers be not hindered so here's where god will oppose a man if he's mistreating his wife he won't listen to his prayers lord i need this money or i need this i need this uh lord heal this person help this person and god doesn't hear their prayers because he's not honoring his wife and of course the same can work for the sister too right but especially the man he has more responsibility he's called to be the leader the same is true in malachi 2 verse 14. we see the same thing in old testament new testament god is talking about all the sins that israel has done against him in this section of scripture where god in verse 13 god doesn't even regard their offerings anymore can you imagine church bringing all these animals to sacrifice and god doesn't receive any of it you just killed all those animals and god didn't even god didn't receive any of that think of the value of all that well the same is true today you can pour in all your ties and offerings but if your heart is not right with god god don't receive it right the pharisees tithe on their ties offerings on their cumin all their spices all their oils they do everything they tithe and offered offered on everything yeah jesus said you have your child i'm sorry you have your father the devil you're the children of hell and jesus said inwardly or outwardly you look beautiful like a whited suffolker like a whited gravestone but inwardly you're full of dead men's bones i'll say like this may we look good on the outside maybe we look holy on the outside but may we have cleanliness on the inside amen may we have life on the inside a new heart a new sphere and god's spirit praise god but they were dead on the inside let the life of god shine out of your life church show the love of god manifest the light of god let your light sign sow before men that they'll see your good works and glorify your father in heaven amen hallelujah i like that song i've got the life of god in me i've got the life of god in me i got his life his nature and his liberty i've got the life of god in me amen we don't have dead men's bones in us praise god we've got the life of jesus inside of us amen well then let it shine let the love of jesus shine especially in your marriage especially in your family because here's where god says i won't receive your offering if you're mistreating your wife or your husband verse 14. yet ye say wherefore in other words why don't you receive my offerings because the lord had been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant did he not make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed take i'm sorry therefore take heed to your spirit and let not i'm sorry and let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth see that's why we're here today church we're here to take heed to our thinking so you don't get weak on the week on god this week it's my prayer you don't go home tonight after second service and you fall into some temptation or you fall into some weak spiritual state where you're not as strong as you were when you came here this morning if you do it wasn't my fault because i preached the word amen hallelujah as far as i know my honesty in my heart i prayed here half hour before the service i've tried to confess everything you know just trying to consecrate myself if you knew it wasn't my fault amen now it could be sometimes it could be my fault sometimes i could miss the sometimes i miss the leading of the lord i'm not perfect like i felt bad on a good friday let me just share this this will kind of get it off my heart i felt like i just missed the main thought of the sermon on good friday when i shared all those examples of the old testament after each one after each one i said i wanted to emphasize but the blood of the covenant forgave them and kept them strong i felt like i was just too harsh on just you know just their sins but i wanted to give you hope i didn't want to just preach all those sins and i want to give you hope i want to emphasize the power of the blood so i enjoyed the service but i felt like i didn't emphasize it the way i wanted to so forgive me on that one i just felt like i felt i put too much emphasis maybe on hardness of cutting preaching and you know stay away from these sins but i want to give you some hope i want to give you uh some joy through the blood amen if their blood covenants protected them and forgave them of drunkenness and lies and deception and all these things surely the blood of jesus will forgive us of all of our sins amen and cleanse us from all unrighteousness but the man said it's good for your soul to be honest amen james 4 6 james 4 6 how does god oppose you in your prayers if you get prideful james 4 6 hebrews james there's my hour so let me try to finish up here james 4 6 now in this text he's talking about worliness and how christians are friends with the world and james says god gets jealous when you're friends with the world doesn't the bible say i'm a jealous god god don't want you to make love to netflix god i don't want you to make love to cigarettes i don't want you to make love to chocolate i don't want your uh god i don't want you all your pleasures to go somewhere else he wants to be your pleasure amen he wants to feel your love and your praises amen he don't want me to love sports you don't want me to worship a pigskin can you imagine a piece of pigskin filled with air he don't want me to worship that he wants me to worship him praise god the god who made the made the pig amen the god who made all these things praise the lord hallelujah and the main thing with pride he don't want us to worship ourselves amen there it is right there because that's what lucifer did amen i will be like i'll get the worship i'll be like the most high he don't want us to make love to you know the spirit of pride look how great i am well i'm really accomplished i've really done something i'm really confident in myself just wait a while you'll get sick and then you'll see how little you are you know just wait a little bit winter's coming around you know you'll see because remember church whatever we reap that's what we sow i'm sorry no whatever we sow forgive me whatever we sow whatever we plant that's what we're gonna reap james 4 6. now verse 5 is where he says god is a jealous god he lusts us doesn't the spirit lust is to envy doesn't god get jealous when we are friends with the world instead of friends with him and his word verse 7. i'm sorry verse 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resists the proud but gives grace into the humble that's what i love about david although he committed murder although he committed adultery he laid there in the temple for seven days asking god god will you give me another thus saith the lord can you give me was that a permissive thus saith the lord that's what i love about david amen when nathan told him it was him he said i'm the man i'm the guilty one now church i don't know how long it was that he denied it but i love when he finally repented he the bible said he threw himself into the house of god jerusalem don't we see the same pattern we get distracted from the things of god but then thankfully god by his grace brings us back to our first love the house of god worshiping god reading the word hearing the preaching singing a new song in the god event being together with god's people god always brings us back to the house of god why because you're just like david you're a bride after jesus's own heart praise god amen see it's a very similar parallel david a man after god's own heart we should be the bride after the heart of husband jesus right when you got married you should have been after that person's heart you just been doing a lot of nice things for that person right you're after their heart you want them to love you for the rest of their lives that's a pretty big task sometimes i don't think we consider how how much a big tax task that is decades long decades decades yes decades a whole lifetime amen thank god for his grace he gives us more grace verse 7 here's how you do it you submit yourself to god in other words you obey god you resist satan and he will flee from you praise god in other words you obey you obey obey until the power well brother jess i still feel tempted we'll keep obeying keep resisting keep fighting and pretty soon you'll you'll probably wake up and that spirit all be gone kind of wake up from your uh just from your battle realize oh i'm not even bound with that anymore praise god thank you jesus for the victory i've been so focused on you the enemy has left amen hallelujah satan's left because i submitted to god i obeyed the word i read the word i worshiped god i was focusing on god and not myself amen i resisted satan so he had to flee well if he's gone who's there jesus amen so just me and jesus amen it's just the lord and i it's just a fellowship what a fellowship what a joy divine leaning on the everlasting arms praise god it's just the lord and i i'm leaning on into my lord i'm enjoying his fellowship i'm laying in his bosom like john the beloved hallelujah humble yourself in the sight of the lord i'm sorry verse 8 draw night to god he'll draw night to you cleanse your hands ye sinners purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness sure sometimes i battle temptations and things so hard i've got to go in the prayer closet and i've told my wife this different things you know i struggled with over the years and then when there's troubles in the church i'll get so upset i've got to go and i've got to just pray in the prayer closet and i'll just start weeping and crying saying god help me i need your help i need your strength i can totally relate to this scripture praise god when you're tempted when you're tested the only way out is god amen i don't know he's the only way out he's the only way in amen he's he's everything praise god hallelujah draw night to god what's the answer every time the answer is draw nigh to god confess your sins get rid of your pride humble yourself and he'll lift you up praise god and if god lifts you up then you'll know god lifted you up right because you know god did this god answered this prayer hallelujah many times he'll do it publicly too he'll just honor you publicly in front of other people because if you pray in secret he rewards you publicly if you can humble yourself and give in secret he rewards you openly publicly proverbs 16 18. we'll just hit a couple of proper scriptures and we'll finish up i thought i would get the king more on king uzziah today but i think i'll save that proverbs 16 18. oh good you're fast good job i didn't have to turn there pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall so anytime we would fall into a temptation it's because we first accepted the evil spirit of pride and we are all susceptible to it that's the point i want to make i believe if you're a wise virgin it seems to me the greatest battle you'll have is with the spirit of pride where you become self-confident in yourself rather than trusting in god i've got a list of brother branhams real quick and i may preach these maybe wednesday night we'll see brother bam one of the first things with pride he battled was his mother-in-law remember his mother-in-law told him don't you go with those pentecostals they're a bunch of trash brother ram knew that wasn't true but he said okay i don't want to disobey my wife's mom and then he suffered greatly because of that lost two family members suffered because of what pride that wasn't lust of the flesh was it no was that lust of the eyes i'm not going to go with the pentecostals because of the lust of the eyes or the lust of the it was the pride of life well my mother-in-law doesn't want me to do this now what about us my dad doesn't want me to do this my mom don't want me to do that my you know my brother don't want me to do it my sister don't want me to do it are we going to take god's way or we're going to take mom's way dad's way mother-in-law's way so when i look at brother bram's life most of his trials most of his falls which he he talked about openly we're not bashing brother branham it's just great it's just great to see he was human like us praise god it's great to know that he needed jesus christ for his advocate just like we need jesus christ for an advocate today lying to the irs what was that was that lust of the flesh his flesh wanted something was that lust of the eyes he was lusting after something it was the pride of life brother branham had amoebas for six months laid in the bed after that uh south africa meeting durbin meeting six months he laid in bed why because he went with the preacher's schedule and itinerary rather than god's angel telling him where to go what was that was that lust of the flesh no the lust of the eyes pride of life part of life i'm going to take the denomination schedule look at this he had to overcome his mother-in-law and denominations he had to learn all these lessons amen the church who's influencing you is it a mother-in-law father-in-law you got to be we got to be careful careful who's influencing us because that's where we're going to fall many times as if we pridefully take somebody else's influence rather than god's influence how about the critical spirit brother branham had he said this critical spirit is haunting me i'm criticizing voice of healing i'm criticizing this preacher criticizing that spirit what is that that's not lust of the flesh that's not pride of life i'm sorry that's not lust of the eyes that's part of part of life right brother branham told god one time you owe me an understanding why uh this you let this mother die after she was healed god wouldn't talk to me i felt like for two weeks he said like a black sheep came down what is that god resist what god resists the proud god's resisting his prayers i'm not gonna hear your prayers do you ever hear about brother brown falling into cigarettes or alcohol no ever feel heard brother i'm falling about into adultery or anything like that no what did he fall into he fell into pride what are you likely to fall into bride what am i likely to fall into likely pride he said god you owe me something and god told him i don't owe you anything now church look how humble that is we think something has to work out a certain way god don't have to god don't have to heal god don't have to give us god don't have to give us the desires of our heart praise god his word says he will but of course that's conditional based upon what the will of god and of course you were familiar with the complex that he had in 1963 standing in the gap he wanted to leave the ministry and i just i'm going to leave all these churches because they just cut their hair anyway these the men just smoke and cuss and i'm just going to leave the ministry i'm just going to live up in the mountain i'm going to run away from everybody i'm going to be a hermit up in the mountains that's that's like my that's like that's just like my dad that's just exactly exactly like my dad he just wants to be a hermit wants to live out all there in his apartment we visit him a couple weeks ago that's just exactly what it is so sad just live away from everybody i don't want nothing to do with anybody everybody hates me i hate everybody this was a complex he had to battle and god had to help him overcome aren't you glad god was faithful aren't you glad god never took that hedge away from his mind hallelujah god never lifted his hand from the prophet thank god but god gave him grace to overcome pride proverbs 13 10. i'll close with this one i'll close with this one i will close hallelujah you join the word today amen it's good to be back with the home home church you know about god's grace i feel i was out i was out of this pulpit for a whole month can you believe that but i guess god has a time and season for everything i had it you know from january all the way till april anyway so it was good so church if you see contention life only by pride comes contention or strife if there's strife in your life it's likely because pride started it if you have a strife or division against a brother sister husband wife mother father if you have contention or strife in your life it's probably due to someone's pride you know what it takes it takes somebody with humility if you like jesus said if you know somebody's got to ought against you what do you do you go to them and you make it right if you've got to ought against somebody what do you do you humble yourself go to that person that's real humility now church when we think about this when i thought about this the first thought i had was wow thank god that i can live a peaceful life how many people's lives are filled with drama and strife and arguments and debates and fusses all that's all they go through austin knows tell me about that with his life we've all been through it everything's a battle everything's a strife everything's an argument everything's a straining and everything's a fight that's because of pride and it can be easily taken care of if someone will be clothed with humility if someone will put on the garment of humility humble themselves draw night to god confess your sins and then god will exalt you in due season let's stand to our feet here musicians can come you can stop the live stream hundred maybe it stopped already right we've been having such trouble
