[19:09] I had a few announcements as well was
[19:12] going to text everybody but I just
[19:14] forgot about it this Sunday I'm gonna
[19:16] cancel with brother Matthew McCloud I'm
[19:18] gonna wait a couple of weeks I told him
[19:21] I wait two weeks since the other
[19:22] situation is at that time with traveling
[19:25] between states it may be legal for him
[19:28] to come to Ohio I'm not sure but just
[19:31] for the risk factor I asked him just
[19:34] let's wait two weeks you know text him
[19:36] two weeks and see if he can come again
[19:39] by God's grace so we're willing I'll be
[19:41] preaching this Sunday as long as the the
[19:43] laws stay the same we'll try to do it
[19:46] like last Sunday if you're healthy come
[19:50] to church we won't shake hands
[19:51] by God's grace and
[19:54] we'll do the services the same way I'll
[19:57] preach the morning at church in Akron
[19:59] and then Lord willing we'll have a 4:00
[20:02] p.m. Bible study service livestream just
[20:05] like tonight by the grace of Lord
[20:08] also yeah one more update there this
[20:11] morning I finished that the next YouTube
[20:13] video it's called not every word William
[20:15] random said was thus saith the Lord yet
[20:17] he's a true prophet so it's already
[20:19] number one
[20:21] out of the last
[20:23] the last two years so within the first
[20:26] eight or ten hours so thank the Lord for
[20:28] that I've heard back from four or five
[20:29] people already about what a blessing it
[20:32] was so that's the pattern we do it we
[20:34] try to preach it first to you and then
[20:35] take it to YouTube land
[20:38] so thankful for that if anyone's
[20:40] interested up I'll probably share it
[20:41] anyway I'll probably text it to you as a
[20:44] blessing there by the grace of God
[20:49] so I can't think of any other
[20:51] announcements by the grace of God so
[20:55] let's sing one more song here and we'll
[20:56] get right into the Word of God
[21:07] let's sing the highest praise and then

[26:10] tonight by God's grace
[26:14] Lord willing when I look at part two of
[26:17] the Bible covenants tonight
[26:21] we're in a star at the third feminine so
[26:24] let's go to Genesis chapter verse 20
[26:27] praise the Lord Genesis 8 verse 20
[26:34] [Music]
[26:49] might do some reading
[26:55] Genesis 820 of course this is right
[26:57] after the flood
[27:08] let's notice here verse 20 by God's
[27:11] grace we
[27:13] read 20 21 22 out of the memory we're so
[27:17] sorry about that interior
[27:20] so just for times sake let's just read
[27:22] verse 20
[27:25] Genesis 8:21 I'll read it together in
[27:27] our homes we're gonna hear it together
[27:29] out loud on three one two three and Noah
[27:33] builded an altar unto the Lord and took
[27:37] of every clean beast and of every clean
[27:40] foul and offering burnt offerings on the
[27:44] altar praise God if you would just keep
[27:48] your spot there let's go to Romans
[27:49] chapter 12 for our memory verse
[28:03] 20 is 12:1 and 2
[28:13] so let's read this on three by God's
[28:15] grace one two three I beseech you
[28:19] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[28:22] that you present your bodies a living
[28:25] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[28:30] is your reasonable service and be not
[28:33] conformed to this world but be
[28:35] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[28:39] that you may prove what is that good and
[28:42] acceptable and perfect will of God let's
[28:45] have one more word of Prayer ask the
[28:47] Lord to minister if you have a need on
[28:48] your heart just make it known at the
[28:49] Lord right there in your home nobody
[28:52] father we love you again we thank you
[28:53] Lord for your mercy it's so good to sing
[28:55] to you we give you all the worship all
[28:57] the praise thank you for forgiving us
[28:59] the unworthy ones Lord you're so worthy
[29:02] your son was the only one worthy to take
[29:04] the book and loosed the seals and now we
[29:06] have a new Bible thank you Lord that
[29:09] these topics and these covenants Lord
[29:11] come open in a way that we've never seen
[29:13] it before Lord God just blessed now to
[29:16] our hearts and our minds Lord that help
[29:18] us to remember your promises even today
[29:20] how their unfailing we love you Lord
[29:22] bless us now in Jesus Christ's name the
[29:25] church said amen god bless you maybe see
[29:29] this praise guy
[29:38] now we'll go back to Genesis 8 verse 20
[29:41] by God's grace
[29:54] now here we're on the the third covenant
[29:58] out of eight now that's what I believe
[30:00] as far as the scripture it seems like
[30:03] New Jerusalem is the eighth day and so
[30:07] it seems like the New Jerusalem will be
[30:09] the eighth covenant we start with Eden's
[30:12] covenant conditional then we went to the
[30:16] Adam covenant and then Lord willing
[30:20] Sunday nerves are you last Sunday night
[30:21] we finished with Noah's covenant
[30:25] I'm sorry
[30:29] now we just got through to last week
[30:31] right yeah we just got through the part
[30:33] me thinking about tonight here we got
[30:35] through the
[30:36] eating covenant and the Adam covenant on
[30:39] Sunday night praise God tonight we're on
[30:41] the third one by God's grace or on
[30:43] Noah's covenant now this is a long
[30:45] covenant so I'm not going to read all
[30:46] this but it starts at Genesis 8:20 and
[30:50] goes all the way to 9 17
[30:54] so let's just keep reading here at the
[30:57] beginning let's go to Genesis 8:21 now
[31:00] and the Lord smelled a sweet savour and
[31:03] the Lord said in his heart I will not
[31:05] again curse the ground any more for
[31:07] man's sake for the imagination of man's
[31:10] heart is evil from his youth neither
[31:12] will I again smite anymore every living
[31:15] thing as I have done
[31:17] while the earth remaineth seedtime and
[31:20] harvest and cold and he and some winter
[31:23] and day and night shall not cease
[31:27] now let's go to chapter 9 I want to just
[31:30] go to
[31:33] verse 15
[31:38] actually you know what why don't we
[31:40] go to 12 because it mentions it there I
[31:43] like how verse 12 shows God's specific
[31:46] words a quote from the Lord about the
[31:49] word covenant verse 12 and God said this
[31:52] is the token of the Covenant which I
[31:54] make between me and you and every living
[31:58] creature that is with you for perpetual
[32:01] generations I do set my bow in the cloud
[32:04] and it shall be a token of a covenant
[32:07] between me and the earth
[32:11] praise God I'm gonna preach from my
[32:13] notes I was highlighting and stunning on
[32:15] those a little bit here tonight by God's
[32:18] grace
[32:25] so now we're on the third covenant it's
[32:28] the Noah covenant praise the Lord
[32:33] now this covenant came into effect about
[32:38] almost 2,000 years after
[32:40] the Adam covenant technically I think by
[32:44] Bible chronology it's about one thousand
[32:47] seven hundred years since Adam's
[32:50] covenant went into effect
[32:53] and notice again it's the Lord
[32:55] initiating this covenant remember that
[32:57] the word covenant means agreement or
[33:00] league and remember how that's different
[33:02] from dispensation at least with Paul's
[33:05] dispensation Paul's dispensation was a
[33:07] stewardship or one job or assignment
[33:11] within the New Covenant and
[33:14] so here we have God establishing a
[33:17] covenant in agreement with man
[33:19] and God makes these
[33:22] gracious gracious promises now notice
[33:26] it's again established after Noah offers
[33:29] a sacrifice
[33:30] right so here again we have a covenant
[33:33] where there's blood blood had to be shed
[33:36] so just like in the previous covenant
[33:38] that Adam covenant God came down and he
[33:41] tore apart lambs and made lamb coat
[33:44] skins and he clothed Adam and Eve and as
[33:47] they walked the skin slapped against
[33:49] their legs but God called out he said
[33:52] I'm gonna kick you out he said but imma
[33:54] let you back in praise God and that be
[33:56] through the the seed of the woman which
[33:59] was Mary bringing forth the Christ child
[34:04] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that
[34:06] blood brings us back into fellowship
[34:08] with God because God's Spirit is now
[34:12] made available in the soul of man and
[34:14] now you and I get to partake of the tree
[34:16] of life praise God amen one day that
[34:19] life will be in our mortal body it'll
[34:22] swallow up our mortal body in other
[34:24] words and we'll have a glorified body
[34:26] praise God but right now jesus said I am
[34:29] the bread of life we'll get to that just
[34:30] a moment but he's the Tree of Life
[34:32] praise God
[34:35] and so here we see blood being shed
[34:38] again and beasts being torn apart and
[34:40] then God looks down from heaven no one
[34:43] looks up and God looks down and said I'm
[34:44] gonna now make another covenant I'm
[34:46] gonna make another League
[34:48] agreement with mankind right after Noah
[34:51] leaves the ark
[34:53] and now this time the lord's covenant is
[34:56] with man but also with all living things
[34:59] so this is a unique
[35:01] covenant here in one sense it's with man
[35:04] and animals he promises to never curse
[35:07] the ground again nor smite every living
[35:10] thing through a flood
[35:13] and we thank the Lord for that praise
[35:16] God but one thing we keep in mind the
[35:18] 2nd Peter 3:10 then why don't you get
[35:20] that for us
[35:22] because in 2nd Peter 3:10 we know God is
[35:25] gonna smite all living things with fire
[35:29] is that right so you says here in
[35:32] Genesis he said I'm never gonna kill in
[35:34] the same way or smite the earth or judge
[35:36] the earth with water but we know the
[35:38] next time is going to be fire so Lydia
[35:41] can you read 2nd Peter 3:10
[35:44] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[35:46] thief in the night in which the heavens
[35:47] shall pass away with a great noise and
[35:49] the elements that then shown that melt
[35:52] with fervent heat the earth also and the
[35:54] works that are therein shall be burned
[35:56] up thank you so the earth and all the
[36:00] elements will be burnt up so we know God
[36:02] is going to do this just in a different
[36:05] way and that he's gonna do it for the
[36:07] same purpose because man was so evil man
[36:09] was so
[36:11] selfish that he turned down God's mark
[36:14] the baptism of the holy ghost a freak a
[36:16] freak of inant right a free pass to
[36:19] heaven right a free token to the rapture
[36:22] to escape the Great Tribulation but most
[36:25] of men are so foolish
[36:26] they reject it so God has to pour out
[36:29] wrath because only their hearts meditate
[36:33] on evil all the time continually so evil
[36:36] that they take the mark of the beast
[36:38] they turn down God's mark and they would
[36:41] rather worship a man than worship the
[36:44] god man the Lord Jesus Christ a fallible
[36:46] man they'd rather worship a Satan film
[36:49] man than a God filled man but we worship
[36:51] the God filled man the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:53] praise God because Christ is the image
[36:55] of the invisible God praise God amen now
[37:01] let's go through some of the promises
[37:03] now it's the first thing God promises in
[37:06] this covenant is he after you know
[37:09] promising he'll never destroy the earth
[37:10] again by water the next thing he
[37:13] reaffirms the be fruitful and multiply
[37:15] and replenish the earth so God said that
[37:19] in the first eating covenant and now he
[37:23] reaffirms it after all mankind is
[37:27] destroyed he says remember he said be
[37:29] fruitful multiply replenish the earth
[37:32] also next he he says animals will
[37:35] continue to fear and dread mankind so
[37:39] man's dominion over all living things
[37:41] will continue
[37:43] what's interesting now is God allows a
[37:46] new diet he allows mankind to eat meat
[37:51] but they must abstain from the blood
[37:54] because the life is in the blood
[37:58] beforehand man was vegetarians man and
[38:01] animal were vegetarians but now God
[38:04] allows us
[38:06] and it's very interesting next
[38:09] God allows capital punishment to be
[38:14] carried out
[38:15] in within the human government
[38:19] so before we know you know in the Garden
[38:23] of Eden or after the Garden of Eden
[38:24] rather with Cain and Abel Cain slew Abel
[38:28] but God did not kill Cain God let him go
[38:32] and he was a wanderer and a vagabond all
[38:34] the days of his life with a mark upon
[38:36] him but now after the flood after the
[38:41] judgment God allows capital punishment
[38:45] in Genesis 9:6 amount I can read that
[38:47] Genesis 9:6
[38:55] thank you so now God kind of Institute's
[38:59] this I for an eye principle now Noah
[39:02] quote we know of course he you know say
[39:03] that specifically that in the Mosaic
[39:05] Covenant which Lord willing we'll get to
[39:07] here tonight if God's willing but yeah
[39:10] also put it here now I want everyone to
[39:14] understand although God instituted this
[39:17] we know that we must do it in the fear
[39:19] of the Lord okay now what I mean by that
[39:22] is if we're to if they were to carry out
[39:24] capital punishment it is done through
[39:27] much discretion so although it's allowed
[39:30] God is still very merciful so for
[39:33] example
[39:34] Moses killed a man right and then Noah
[39:38] of course was before way before Moses
[39:40] and yet God did not suffer him to be
[39:44] killed although he murdered a man so God
[39:47] was merciful and then David indirectly
[39:50] killed Uriah and yet God had mercy on
[39:53] David
[39:55] so we understand that although God
[39:57] allowed this it was used with great
[40:00] discretion and great fear of the Lord
[40:04] now to conclude this covenant it's again
[40:07] so with such a beautiful thought God
[40:10] gives the first token and it's the first
[40:12] time the word token is used in the Bible
[40:14] amen because the token means a sign
[40:17] praise God a sign there's a sign for the
[40:21] Covenant and this of course is the seven
[40:24] colored rainbow the bow will be in the
[40:26] clouds and then God will remember his
[40:29] covenant with man and all living things
[40:31] to never destroy the earth again through
[40:34] a flood
[40:36] now remember this is a beautiful symbol
[40:39] here the rainbow and so member I preach
[40:42] us a few years ago but on earth we only
[40:45] see half of a rainbow right we receive
[40:47] maybe a little over more than a half
[40:49] but God truly loves the rainbow the
[40:52] world has perverted it of course through
[40:53] the homosexual and LGBT movement and so
[40:56] forth it's been perverted but this is
[40:59] God's covenant this is God's symbol and
[41:01] God thinks so much of it that when
[41:04] revelation is open we see there's a bow
[41:06] but it's not just half way around but
[41:08] it's all around the throne of God and
[41:10] that tells us that the half has not yet
[41:13] been told about the gracious covenants
[41:16] of God amen
[41:18] so what a blessing here only we only
[41:22] know half praise God probably less than
[41:24] that but the point is God will review
[41:26] all the great blessings of promises and
[41:28] protections of his covenants to us in
[41:31] glory praise the Lord
[41:37] so I want to say this now as we close
[41:39] this covenant
[41:41] all the commands and conditions of
[41:44] Noah's covenant remain to this day
[41:48] but it seems that it ends at the eternal
[41:54] covenant when the eternal covenant
[41:56] begins because there's no more death
[41:58] so see God won't have to prove it
[42:01] anymore
[42:03] of course there'll be no capital
[42:05] punishment there we know eating probably
[42:07] no eating of animals anymore imagine so
[42:11] it seems like this covenant lasts a
[42:12] great long time praise God
[42:16] alright next we have our fourth covenant
[42:19] the fourth covenant is the Abrahamic or
[42:22] Abraham's covenant so it's found in a
[42:25] couple scriptures Genesis 12 liddie if
[42:28] you go there Malachi Genesis 17 9 so
[42:32] Genesis 12:1 Lydia and Malachi Genesis
[42:35] 17 9
[42:41] so after a long period between Adams
[42:44] covenant to Noah there's a rather
[42:47] shorter one from Noah to Abraham and
[42:52] kind of get the background remember
[42:55] after Noah what major event took place
[42:57] the Tower of Babel so even after God
[43:00] graciously gives humanity another chance
[43:03] they rebelled again man still shows
[43:06] every imagination of his heart is wicked
[43:09] and he wants to try to make his own way
[43:11] to heaven they're still doing that today
[43:13] right in the modern day tower Babel we'd
[43:15] say the Roman Catholic Church the mother
[43:17] harlot and all her daughters not just
[43:19] the one just the mother but the
[43:21] daughters as well when they make a
[43:23] man-made way to heaven anything that's
[43:25] outside of the blood of Jesus Christ
[43:27] thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ
[43:29] that's why we're saying we're saved by
[43:32] grace through faith not of works lest
[43:34] any man should boast praise God
[43:37] but 400 years pass and God sees them
[43:41] again all mankind gathers the one place
[43:44] and they try to they try to just force
[43:46] their way to heaven or discover their
[43:49] way to heaven and God said they would
[43:50] have done it that's how smart they were
[43:52] my so God sends angels down he shuts him
[43:55] down he changes their language and
[43:57] creates Babel confusion and out of this
[44:00] God said I need to make a new covenant
[44:02] then all these men come against me and
[44:06] I've got to do something new praise God
[44:07] and so God chooses one man praise God
[44:11] out of all the world God chooses one
[44:13] mass and I'm gonna start a new covenant
[44:16] with this man his name's Abram praise
[44:18] God so then it can you read verses 1
[44:21] through 3 in Genesis 12
[44:26] you have the out of thy country and from
[44:27] thy kindred and from thy father's house
[44:29] unto a land that I will show thee and I
[44:31] will make of thee a great nation I will
[44:33] bless thee and make thy name great and
[44:35] thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[44:37] bless them that curse thean curse him
[44:39] that curseth thee and in thee shall all
[44:41] families of the earth be blessed amen
[44:44] thank you now by God's grace we saw five
[44:47] blessings did you notice I think there's
[44:49] five blessings in this command he's
[44:53] gonna make a great nation of Abraham
[44:55] seed 1 he's gonna make his name great
[44:58] which it is right with the three major
[45:00] religions
[45:01] Christianity Judaism and the Muslim
[45:05] faith all make claim to Abraham
[45:08] that's over I think that's over about 3
[45:11] billion people on this earth
[45:15] number 3 God promises I bless all those
[45:19] who bless you Abram number 4 I'll curse
[45:23] all those who curse you and number 5 I
[45:28] will make a view of blessing to all the
[45:32] families on the earth so through you
[45:34] every family on the earth would be
[45:36] blessed by what I promised that's how
[45:39] much God thought of Abraham or Abram you
[45:41] had such fate remember he's the father
[45:43] of faith the father of Revelation so
[45:46] Abraham had a revelation right faith is
[45:49] the evidence of things not seen so
[45:51] revelation is your evidence God has
[45:54] unveiled some one of his promises to you
[45:56] and that is your evidence your hope or
[45:58] your assurance your trust that what God
[46:01] revealed to you is his word and it's
[46:03] going to come to pass he's the father of
[46:05] that and praise God we're part of his
[46:07] seed spiritually today amen don't know
[46:10] why we don't have any proof maybe you
[46:12] say we'll go in the rapture or have any
[46:14] proof to say we're wise virgins or
[46:17] anything like that but we have the
[46:18] revelation of it by the baptism of the
[46:21] Holy Spirit of the same spirit that was
[46:23] in Christ doing the same works and
[46:24] living the same life in our life today
[46:27] that's our evidence faith praise God
[46:30] amen thank the Lord hallelujah
[46:33] so women have Malachi read Genesis 17 9
[46:37] to 14
[46:40] yes please and
[46:43] God said unto Abraham I should have keep
[46:46] my covenant therefore thou and they seed
[46:48] after thee in their generations
[46:49] this is my covenant which you shall keep
[46:52] between me and you and thy seed after
[46:54] you every man shot on you shall be
[46:56] circumcised then you shall circumcise
[46:58] the flesh of your foreskin it should be
[47:00] it's opened up with evident tricks me
[47:02] and you and he that has eight days old
[47:04] shall be circumcised among you every man
[47:06] child in your generations he then is
[47:08] born in the house or bought with money
[47:10] of any stranger which is not as I see he
[47:13] then is born in my house and he that has
[47:15] bought with my money must not be
[47:17] circumcised and my covenant shall be in
[47:19] your flesh for everlasting covenant and
[47:21] the uncircumcised man child whose flesh
[47:24] of his foreskin is not circumcised that
[47:25] soul should be fought for his people he
[47:27] had broken my covenant
[47:29] thank you I'm Alcott the token which
[47:33] we'll get to in a moment but before we
[47:34] get to there once again God in his
[47:38] beautiful design he confirms his
[47:41] covenant with Abram through a blood
[47:44] sacrifice in Genesis 15 now we're not
[47:47] going to go through read that all of it
[47:51] but we know Abraham brought many of
[47:53] these sacrifices and then he slew him
[47:56] and remember what happened remember how
[47:58] the birds came down and tried to take
[48:00] away the sacrifice and number Abram had
[48:02] to shoo him away and brother man thought
[48:04] that that was a type of Abraham casting
[48:07] out Devils right because usually groups
[48:09] of birds represent evil spirits and so
[48:12] then a beautiful thing happens God puts
[48:15] Abram to sleep and then the Holy Spirit
[48:17] like a furnace like a light goes between
[48:20] the sacrifices and usually in a covenant
[48:24] which I don't have the scripture about
[48:25] he'd look it up I think it's in Jeremiah
[48:26] usually God said when you make a
[48:28] covenant both men stand between the
[48:31] pieces of the animal and
[48:33] they make a oath saying that if we don't
[48:37] keep it let if I don't keep my end of
[48:39] the bargain if I don't keep my covenant
[48:41] let me be as this beast let me be torn
[48:44] apart but see when God did it with
[48:46] Abraham he said Abraham down I said
[48:48] Abraham
[48:49] your strength is not going to be able to
[48:52] keep this covenant right Abraham
[48:55] strength couldn't do it God was God was
[48:57] showing that Abraham you can't keep a
[48:59] covenant and this one I'm instituting
[49:02] and my word it's my power it's my Holy
[49:06] Spirit's my light that's going to keep
[49:08] this covenant praise God amen that's so
[49:11] beautiful praise the Lord God has to put
[49:12] him asleep and said I'm the one it's my
[49:15] power that will keep the Covenant praise
[49:16] God because we know Abraham lied he fell
[49:19] short of the glory of God Abraham sinned
[49:21] at times right he wasn't a perfect man
[49:24] but God wasn't looking at his mistakes
[49:26] God was looking at his faith praise God
[49:29] God forgave him all the sins amen praise
[49:32] God
[49:33] so again blood is connected with the
[49:36] Covenant praise God it's like with
[49:39] Adam's Noah's and now Abraham's there's
[49:42] always blood shed and a covenant except
[49:45] for the first and the last as we said
[49:46] the eating covenant and then the eternal
[49:49] covenant there be no bloodshed at those
[49:51] as far as we understand by the grace of
[49:53] the Lord
[49:54] now even after Abraham's death memory
[49:57] the Abraham brother he lived 175 years
[49:59] even after that we're not going to read
[50:01] it but in Genesis 26 and Genesis 28 God
[50:05] is so faithful to Abraham's seed that he
[50:08] comes to Abraham's son Isaac and
[50:11] grandson Jacob and he reaffirms the
[50:15] Covenant that he gave Abram back in
[50:18] Genesis 15 it's beautiful to see it but
[50:21] we're not going to go there to read it
[50:23] just for times sake I want you to nod to
[50:26] notice that
[50:27] God is now focusing on one group of
[50:30] people to make a great nation through
[50:34] his holiness
[50:35] because mankind in total defiance defied
[50:40] is his law at the Tower of Babel he
[50:42] defied his word they defied his way to
[50:44] heaven so because all of humanity came
[50:47] against God God said I'm gonna start
[50:49] with one praise God just like he did
[50:51] with no I'm gonna start with one family
[50:53] there's one family that found grace and
[50:55] the side Lord in church let our families
[50:57] be the families that find grace in this
[51:00] wicked hour this Laodicean
[51:02] lukewarm how're that our families be the
[51:05] ones that are found faithful that have a
[51:06] fire for God and love for God a
[51:08] diligence for God may God granted that
[51:10] we can be faithful families that find
[51:13] grace in the sight of the Lord praise
[51:15] God amen thank the Lord
[51:18] now through this covenant God does a
[51:21] major thing God creates two groups of
[51:24] people
[51:25] so before this there was only the human
[51:27] race right but now God said I'm gonna
[51:30] make a seed out of Abraham so now he
[51:33] makes the Abrahamic seed which we know
[51:35] later turns into Israel or Judah right
[51:38] Abraham Isaac Jacob Jacob had a name
[51:41] change to Israel and the people because
[51:43] he had 12 sons became known as the
[51:45] children of Israel and later they became
[51:47] known as Jews because the center of
[51:50] Israel was Judah right and so they
[51:52] called him Jews which was short for
[51:54] Judah the tribe of Judah we know Judah
[51:57] was just one try but they took that name
[51:59] because Jerusalem there was the capital
[52:03] of Israel they called it the people of
[52:05] Judah
[52:07] all right now
[52:10] so God focuses on one family praise God
[52:13] the the Abrahamic family which later
[52:16] becomes the Jewish family praise God now
[52:20] everyone else all their nations are
[52:22] called Gentiles now remember God
[52:24] promised to bless all those but he
[52:26] wasn't specifically dealing with them he
[52:29] was specifically dealing with Abraham's
[52:31] seed praise God but as long as the
[52:33] Gentiles bless Abraham God would bless
[52:36] them if they cursed Abraham they'd be
[52:39] cursed
[52:43] now just like the Noah covenant God
[52:47] assigns a token for Abraham's covenant
[52:49] this time it's not in nature which all
[52:52] men can see it's actually in man's body
[52:57] which men don't see very often right
[53:00] unless it's a personal situation right
[53:03] so now it's it's a covenant in secret
[53:07] and
[53:08] God calls it an everlasting covenant in
[53:12] their flesh which is male circumcision
[53:14] now know this program brother Adam
[53:17] catches this numerous times on the tapes
[53:19] he said notice the Bible said
[53:20] everlasting covenant and not eternal
[53:23] because an eternal will never have an
[53:26] end right so God causes an everlasting
[53:30] because everlasting usually means just a
[53:32] very long time it's not the same as
[53:34] eternal which means never had the
[53:35] beginning never had an ending so Malachi
[53:38] read that tonight he said I'm gonna give
[53:39] you an everlasting covenant the male
[53:42] circumcision
[53:45] now I want to just stop and make this
[53:48] obvious point to most people but
[53:50] Abraham's covenant has suture
[53:53] supernaturally shaped and transformed
[53:55] human history
[53:57] remember in Genesis 41 I'll just give a
[54:00] few examples
[54:01] Egypt was going to suffer an awful
[54:04] famine right that whole part the whole
[54:06] part of the world was gonna suffer an
[54:07] awful famine and death but God spared
[54:11] Egypt because they blessed Joseph right
[54:15] so because one of the most wicked
[54:18] idolatrous nations which later got
[54:20] judged right by Pharaoh through
[54:22] Pharaoh's disbelief God spared Egypt God
[54:26] blessed Egypt with seven years of plenty
[54:28] and then kept them through Joseph God
[54:32] blessed Egypt through Joseph through
[54:35] Abraham seed all those that bless you
[54:38] bless all those that curse you I'll
[54:40] curse praise God and we know Israel or
[54:44] Egypt has fallen greatly because they
[54:46] started cursing right Israel and Moses
[54:49] and that's why there was the Exodus
[54:53] so see we can easily see how Abraham's
[54:57] seed is transformed so whatever whoever
[54:59] Israel went that's where the blessings
[55:01] of God flowed from
[55:04] another example was under Moses Joshua
[55:07] David and then Solomon Solomon was we
[55:11] called the Golden Age of Israel right so
[55:14] much prosperity so much blessings where
[55:17] everybody was under Solomon right at the
[55:20] end of David's life everybody was under
[55:22] David right he had all the nations
[55:24] they're under under him and paying him
[55:26] taxes right
[55:29] and so see everyone that blessed
[55:32] Israel was blessed think about Moses and
[55:35] Joshua all the nations they destroyed
[55:37] the Moabites the Hittites amirite
[55:40] whoever blessed that most blessed
[55:42] whoever came against them was cursed and
[55:44] so all history follows this same pattern
[55:48] and even today we know the United States
[55:52] became the world's superpower because of
[55:57] its
[55:58] judeo-christian foundation and its
[56:00] initial adherence to God's laws that's
[56:03] why America has become we'd say the
[56:05] beast out of the land right from
[56:08] Revelation chapter 13 the Constitution
[56:11] and the Bill of Rights are heavily
[56:13] influenced by the Torah and Paul's
[56:16] epistles
[56:18] America's prosperity has flowed over
[56:21] into every other nation in fact in the
[56:25] 1800s a man from Europe came over to
[56:28] United States and went across the
[56:29] country and went back to Europe and
[56:30] wrote a book and called it America's
[56:33] exceptionalism he said there was
[56:35] something exceptional about America
[56:37] they're not the biggest country they
[56:39] don't have the most people in their
[56:41] country but their prosperity is
[56:44] unparalleled
[56:45] so for the for the number of people
[56:47] their fruitfulness is unmatched and he
[56:51] called it American exceptionalism why
[56:54] was that because America started with
[56:56] prayer fasting honoring God freedom of
[56:59] religion and they took upon themselves
[57:02] the spiritual seed of Abraham praise God
[57:05] they were the spiritual seed of Abraham
[57:07] and that tiny little boat coming across
[57:09] the ocean right God protecting his seed
[57:11] hallelujah thank the Lord and then now
[57:15] is transform the entire globe has
[57:18] transformed the entire world through
[57:20] Abraham's seed
[57:23] now going back to the nation of Israel
[57:25] we know they became identified nation in
[57:28] 1948
[57:30] they have experienced amazing prosperity
[57:34] and innovation since they got back in
[57:36] their land
[57:38] it is a known fact I use a
[57:42] a reference in the book here or willing
[57:44] when it comes out
[57:46] Israel is one of the world's leaders in
[57:48] the number of patents research
[57:51] achievements
[57:53] entrepreneurship and innovation in the
[57:56] entire world again per person or per
[57:59] per population it's one of the greatest
[58:02] and most prosperous most fruitful
[58:04] nations in all the world I think is top
[58:07] three in the world so it's so
[58:10] extraordinary why is that because
[58:12] they're Abraham's seed and when they
[58:14] obey God God blesses them and then
[58:17] whoever blesses them God blesses them in
[58:19] return
[58:24] when I threw out this about America
[58:28] although other nations you know are
[58:30] prosperous like we'd say like China and
[58:32] other places like that you know the
[58:35] United Kingdom and everything there is
[58:37] no country like the United States of
[58:39] America people sit from all around the
[58:42] world say that because no country
[58:45] experiences the level of freedom and
[58:48] prosperity that Americans have Chinese
[58:51] can be very prosperous English can be
[58:53] very prosperous but they don't have the
[58:56] freedoms that we have because our
[58:59] freedoms come from God's word come from
[59:02] the Torah come from the New Testament
[59:05] some of them come from Jesus's words
[59:07] praise God and I've had a friend I have
[59:10] a friend in denomination his name's Dan
[59:12] he's been to over 20 different countries
[59:14] around the world and he just pleased
[59:17] with people on Facebook and everyone he
[59:19] comes in contact to he said don't let
[59:21] socialism come in this country he said
[59:24] I've been to the socialist countries
[59:25] I've been to all these countries he said
[59:27] there's no place like America why is
[59:29] that it's because the blessings of
[59:30] Abraham upon this nation praise God
[59:34] because God keeps his covenant aren't
[59:36] you glad God keeps his covenant promise
[59:38] to us Abraham seat praise God I
[59:45] wanted to stop and make a point here
[59:48] that as far as my my book I remember I'm
[59:51] preaching chapter two right now of the
[59:54] next book if the Lord is willing
[59:56] now a chapter 3 will deal specifically
[1:00:00] on the mystery of God graciously opening
[1:00:04] the eight Abrahamic covenant to the
[1:00:07] Gentiles okay so I'll devote that whole
[1:00:11] chapter to that how it was a natural
[1:00:13] seed and then it became a spiritual seed
[1:00:17] so Israel is Abraham's natural seed her
[1:00:21] offspring but our faith in Jesus Christ
[1:00:24] makes us the spiritual seed and that's
[1:00:27] in Galatians three seven I'll read it
[1:00:30] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:00:32] faith the same are the children of
[1:00:35] Abraham
[1:00:37] so because Abraham's true seed is
[1:00:40] actually spiritual now the circumcision
[1:00:44] or token is now spiritual as well praise
[1:00:47] God amen Paul cause at the inward
[1:00:50] circumcision of the heart amen and of
[1:00:53] course he means soul as well in Romans
[1:00:56] 229 I wanted to stop and make a point
[1:00:59] here I found a real good quote and for
[1:01:01] all of our friends that love quotes I
[1:01:03] know you do praise God so I want to read
[1:01:06] a quote I'm a quote lover and I know you
[1:01:08] are too because we take all those quotes
[1:01:11] back to the Word of God
[1:01:13] let me read this quote we hear now
[1:01:15] programs preaching the last sermon of
[1:01:19] nineteen sixty it's called Revelation
[1:01:20] chapter 4 part 1 he's closings this is
[1:01:23] on a New Year's night and he's praying
[1:01:25] and doing an altar call and asking
[1:01:27] people to raise their hands if they want
[1:01:29] to accept Christ
[1:01:30] he says this he says our heavenly father
[1:01:33] has this New Year's Eve just about two
[1:01:36] hours now and it'll be over there'll be
[1:01:38] a new year what we have done this year
[1:01:40] we have did many things I've done I'm
[1:01:42] ashamed of myself I repent of those Lord
[1:01:46] and
[1:01:48] there's a lot of things that I've done
[1:01:50] that many of my brethren didn't
[1:01:51] understand many of the brothers out in
[1:01:53] the fields don't understand and why did
[1:01:55] them but father I did them because I was
[1:01:58] led to do them I pray father that you
[1:02:00] will never let me be ashamed of that
[1:02:03] leading praise God amen turn to you and
[1:02:05] I we never would be shamed of the way
[1:02:07] God leads us
[1:02:09] we'll know it's God leading cuz it'll be
[1:02:11] more of the Word of God that were
[1:02:13] supposed to fulfill
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:16] he said but leave me on Lord to continue
[1:02:19] to do as I am led to do help me God
[1:02:23] because I seek sincerely to know your
[1:02:26] will that I might do it to bring no no
[1:02:30] notice he breaks into this vision or
[1:02:32] dream I can't find which one it was but
[1:02:34] notice he says he's seeking to know
[1:02:37] God's will that I might do it to bring
[1:02:39] as you show me many years ago when I
[1:02:41] left this church
[1:02:42] so when brother Branham went he left
[1:02:45] pastoring round tabernacle and went on
[1:02:47] his mission healing and missionary
[1:02:50] campaigns he had a vision he
[1:02:53] said to bring the bread of life to the
[1:02:57] peoples of the world now watch this
[1:02:59] watch this because this is important for
[1:03:01] me and I know for you too
[1:03:04] so brother man I had a vision when he
[1:03:06] left a tabernacle he was to bring the
[1:03:08] bread of God to the people of the world
[1:03:12] look what he says when I saw that great
[1:03:15] mountain of bread oh brother hos I hope
[1:03:19] you're saying Amen right now
[1:03:21] when I saw that great mountain of bread
[1:03:24] and listen white robe Saints coming from
[1:03:28] all over the earth to eat this bread of
[1:03:33] life amen praise God
[1:03:35] hallelujah now why is that so important
[1:03:38] Church
[1:03:40] because he says Oh God let me Oh God let
[1:03:43] me never fail to feed the people on the
[1:03:46] bread of life because notice people from
[1:03:48] all around the world are coming to
[1:03:51] brother Brent of the north they have
[1:03:52] white robes on which means they have
[1:03:53] eternal life they're coming to him to
[1:03:55] feed on a mountain of bread now the
[1:04:00] reason I bring that up is because I'm
[1:04:01] preaching from the book I'm writing now
[1:04:03] which I feel inspired by the Holy Spirit
[1:04:06] to write it and there's 12 chapters and
[1:04:09] those twelve represe there's twelve
[1:04:11] Bible mysteries and those twelve
[1:04:14] represent the twelve loaves of shewbread
[1:04:18] praise God in the Holy Place phrase what
[1:04:21] are they they're a mountain bread
[1:04:23] actually two mountains of bread praise
[1:04:25] God see it's beautiful in church this is
[1:04:29] what God did in brother man's ministry
[1:04:30] he had a Leibrandt amber NACO to preach
[1:04:34] all the revelations of God right
[1:04:37] of course after the seals he took those
[1:04:38] revelations and preached him out as well
[1:04:40] so he had to go and preach you know all
[1:04:43] the mysteries that were preaching that
[1:04:45] we've been preaching the mysteries of
[1:04:46] the kingdom of God the mystery of the
[1:04:48] rapture the mystery of God's will oh my
[1:04:51] here the mystery of the Jew and Gentile
[1:04:53] praise God here the mystery of Israel's
[1:04:55] blindness all these mysteries and you
[1:04:57] had to go preach and deliver God's bread
[1:05:00] the mysteries of God and that ties in
[1:05:03] perfectly with Revelation chapter 10
[1:05:05] where John eats the book and he goes and
[1:05:07] prophesied to every nation there they
[1:05:09] are there they are everybody feeding on
[1:05:13] the bread of God praise God eating the
[1:05:15] book eating the bread of God thank you
[1:05:17] lord so I never found that quote I think
[1:05:20] til last week so I know Jose I know you
[1:05:22] love that one brother what a blessing
[1:05:24] praise God so brother Aaron continues
[1:05:26] praying in this sermon
[1:05:29] he said bless these hungry souls in here
[1:05:32] that raised their hands just now they're
[1:05:34] seeking for more of life I pray that
[1:05:36] you'll fill them with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:37] Lord each of them each one of them
[1:05:39] granite Lord God give them blessings
[1:05:42] help our brethren everywhere and bless
[1:05:45] our ministry brothers it's fixing to
[1:05:47] come up again now in a few moments
[1:05:48] others will be speaking we pray that
[1:05:51] they will give out the bread of life to
[1:05:53] us tonight father as we'll listen
[1:05:56] closely and reverently to hear the voice
[1:05:58] granite amen wow I didn't catch it you
[1:06:02] catch it but a man just said to hear
[1:06:04] God's voice so see brother man was
[1:06:06] saying I'm not the only voice of God now
[1:06:08] he was the main voice as a prophet and
[1:06:10] the church a messenger but he also said
[1:06:12] God is going to speak through these
[1:06:13] other people and we're gonna hear the
[1:06:16] voice tonight amen because there's one
[1:06:18] voice the voice of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:20] praise God amen
[1:06:23] and notice they're gonna be feeding
[1:06:25] people bread to Ivy that's what we're
[1:06:27] doing tonight we're feeding God's people
[1:06:29] the bread amen the bread of life
[1:06:30] hallelujah
[1:06:32] thank the Lord alright hope you like
[1:06:36] that one
[1:06:37] that's beautiful beautiful quote there
[1:06:39] and I didn't I didn't even realize that
[1:06:41] one must have forgot that vision or that
[1:06:43] dream whatever it was brother man said
[1:06:46] the people will be coming from all over
[1:06:48] the world to eat the bread of God the
[1:06:51] eternal life of God's bread from Bible
[1:06:54] thank the Lord
[1:06:55] praise God
[1:06:58] good now got about twenty minutes to get
[1:07:00] my hour here so we'll see how we go now
[1:07:03] let's get back here this Abrahamic
[1:07:05] covenant all the conditions and commands
[1:07:08] from this covenant to today
[1:07:11] now how many believe this is a great
[1:07:14] cover now I would say Amen I mean
[1:07:16] tremendous through those five tremendous
[1:07:18] blessings everything he touched is
[1:07:20] turned to gold basically everything a
[1:07:22] wreck anyone that loves Abraham they're
[1:07:24] gonna be blessed
[1:07:26] but as great as this is
[1:07:29] this covenant never solves anything with
[1:07:32] Abraham sin problem it's still animal
[1:07:35] blood sacrifice right it doesn't solve
[1:07:37] that problem because the Bible said
[1:07:40] there was still a problem they would
[1:07:42] sacrifice but their conscience when they
[1:07:44] would leave their conscience was would
[1:07:46] stay to file
[1:07:47] her advice could never cleanse their
[1:07:50] conscience to say I am really forgiving
[1:07:52] God really done ah my sins are put away
[1:07:55] there there underneath the blood also
[1:07:57] Calvary praise God as far away as
[1:08:00] darkness is from Donna amen
[1:08:02] those great as it was it never finished
[1:08:06] the sin question
[1:08:10] so the total answer never came during
[1:08:13] the answer for sin rather never came in
[1:08:15] at Abraham's covenant it would come
[1:08:17] later in the New Covenant praise God but
[1:08:20] before even that God was going to get
[1:08:22] two more covenants and it's a good thing
[1:08:24] he did because they all had purposes and
[1:08:27] foreshadowing and fulfillment that had
[1:08:31] to take place
[1:08:34] now it's what wonderful to see is that
[1:08:37] the Abrahamic covenant began about 1900
[1:08:41] or almost 2,000 years before Christ so
[1:08:45] did you catch that again so Noah's was
[1:08:46] about 2,000 years after the garden and
[1:08:50] then here
[1:08:52] boom sorry
[1:08:59] no sir I got that mixed up here I
[1:09:04] got my stop mixed up there sorry what it
[1:09:09] was as Abraham I'm sorry God destroyed
[1:09:12] God destroyed the earth 2,000 years
[1:09:15] after the garden threw water through
[1:09:17] Noah and then it's 2000 years Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ dies on the cross right and then
[1:09:22] 6000 years the rapture takes place
[1:09:25] praise God sorry I was kind of getting
[1:09:27] my numbers mixed up there pardon me but
[1:09:30] Abraham's covenant does end when the
[1:09:33] eternal covenant begins I believe
[1:09:35] because its purpose is now fulfilled
[1:09:38] because every one alive in that future
[1:09:41] home
[1:09:44] will already have the eternal blessings
[1:09:47] of eternal life there will be no need
[1:09:50] for any curses right then I don't wanted
[1:09:51] to curse anybody because the cause of
[1:09:54] curse the Father curses is done away
[1:09:57] with Satan and Church the whole earth is
[1:09:59] full of God's glory already praise God
[1:10:02] amen and like the Bible said you want to
[1:10:05] teach every man his neighbor the word
[1:10:07] because every man will already know it
[1:10:09] praise God God's Word will already be
[1:10:11] written in their hearts praise the Lord
[1:10:12] and before they ask God will answer
[1:10:15] before they call God will answer already
[1:10:17] praise God
[1:10:19] so that covenant can be fulfilled it can
[1:10:21] be completed in the eternal covenant
[1:10:25] praise God
[1:10:29] now let's take the last
[1:10:32] 20 minutes or so by God's grace and
[1:10:36] we'll finish up with the Mosaic Covenant
[1:10:37] the fifth and final covenant praise God
[1:10:43] they had a few notes I'll be referencing
[1:10:45] off my tablet as well
[1:10:49] so we'll start by saying this covenant
[1:10:53] has the most written about it as far as
[1:10:56] well I guess is I guess I guess that's
[1:10:59] up for debate too I can I guess if
[1:11:01] with the new covenant so you see some of
[1:11:04] these things I haven't thought through
[1:11:05] all the way that's why I'm preaching at
[1:11:06] first to try to catch the inspiration
[1:11:08] praise God and then finish the chapter
[1:11:09] later
[1:11:13] well it depends I guess what you say
[1:11:16] about you all that for example with the
[1:11:17] new covenant with all of Paul's writings
[1:11:19] and Jesus is writing that shows a lot
[1:11:21] that shares a lot but the mosaic has a
[1:11:24] lot too because the Mosaic Covenant is
[1:11:26] covered in exodus chapters 20 through
[1:11:30] 40 and then also there's a great chapter
[1:11:33] and Deuteronomy 30 that covers it as
[1:11:37] well
[1:11:43] yeah so I got a couple of quotes I want
[1:11:45] to make sure I read here or a couple of
[1:11:48] scriptures rather
[1:11:51] so just bear with me just a second here
[1:12:06] okay yeah so I'll get to that in just a
[1:12:10] moment at a scripture I want to read
[1:12:12] about
[1:12:13] God's faithfulness to the Covenant okay
[1:12:17] now I'll get to that one in just a
[1:12:18] moment there thank you for your patience
[1:12:20] we'll get to that in just a moment here
[1:12:23] so 400 years after Abraham the father of
[1:12:26] faith God raised up a lawgiver praise
[1:12:29] God's you have a father of faith and now
[1:12:31] you have a lawgiver by the name of Moses
[1:12:34] taking all the water
[1:12:36] here now God initiates this covenant and
[1:12:41] so let's have Lydia read district an you
[1:12:43] go to
[1:12:44] Hebrews 9 so that he's going to read
[1:12:47] Hebrews 9 19 and 20
[1:12:53] so just as Adam's covenant Noah's
[1:12:57] covenant and Abraham's covenant had shed
[1:12:59] blood so does the Mosaic Covenant so
[1:13:03] Lydia can you read Hebrews 9 19 and 20
[1:13:18] saying this is the blood of the
[1:13:20] Testament which God has enjoined unto
[1:13:22] you amen so now this is that was this
[1:13:26] that was a reference in Hebrews 9 but it
[1:13:31] actually took place in gentler Exodus 24
[1:13:34] Moses takes the blood he sprinkles the
[1:13:36] book and he sprinkles the people so the
[1:13:39] Bible said the blood and joins them or
[1:13:42] connects them to God's covenant or puts
[1:13:46] them into God's covenant so again we see
[1:13:49] blood along with covenants death in
[1:13:53] order to bring life praise God
[1:13:58] now God gave Moses two tables of
[1:14:01] commands called the ten commandments and
[1:14:04] that symbolizes this new covenant right
[1:14:07] because all you have to do is see two
[1:14:08] pictures of two tables of stone that you
[1:14:10] think Oh Moses the law Moses now of
[1:14:14] course all of Moses laws was over 600
[1:14:16] loss right
[1:14:17] all of them can be divided into three
[1:14:19] groups you have the moral law moral laws
[1:14:23] Ten Commandments abominations you have
[1:14:26] civil laws just laws within Hebrews and
[1:14:29] then you have ceremonial laws which
[1:14:32] aren't Levitical laws
[1:14:34] now it's beautiful about this is we get
[1:14:37] a law through Moses but we also get
[1:14:40] ceremonial sacrifice and a priesthood
[1:14:44] through Moses praise God so get a
[1:14:46] lawgiver and we get a priest and get the
[1:14:48] law and then we get priests
[1:14:51] so beautiful here
[1:14:54] now just like the previous two tokens we
[1:14:58] have the rainbow and the male
[1:15:00] circumcision now we have another sign so
[1:15:03] Malachi can read this one here it's
[1:15:06] exodus 31:16 and 17 you know it's a
[1:15:10] that's your house if you know that the
[1:15:12] token for the Mosaic Covenant so exodus
[1:15:15] 31:16 and 17 whatever you're
[1:15:26] out there generations for a perpetual
[1:15:29] covenant is it it is a sign between me
[1:15:32] and the children of Israel forever for
[1:15:35] in six days the Lord made heaven and
[1:15:36] earth the station rested and was
[1:15:39] refreshed amen so as an ark I read the
[1:15:43] token for the Mosaic Covenant is
[1:15:45] sabbath-keeping so now it's it's back to
[1:15:49] the it's now it's more than the flesh
[1:15:51] now it's in your daily life or your
[1:15:53] actions praise God which that's a
[1:15:55] beautiful thought right there so went
[1:15:58] from visible to all to something
[1:16:00] personal in the flesh and then it went
[1:16:03] to a public life
[1:16:05] now what's what's striking is that a lot
[1:16:08] of Christians today
[1:16:10] and I have two friends that actually do
[1:16:13] it two brothers in Christ that actually
[1:16:16] do it but they're they're into
[1:16:20] Christian Judaism I'm not sure exactly
[1:16:22] how to say I don't under the exact word
[1:16:24] my wife would know cuz I forgot but they
[1:16:28] actually keep the Sabbath they actually
[1:16:31] keep it and they're not they're not
[1:16:34] 7-day in Venice either they're just
[1:16:35] there's Christians that believe in I
[1:16:38] think they might be Messianic Christian
[1:16:40] that maybe that's the word there but I
[1:16:42] think they keep the Passover the Feast
[1:16:45] of Tabernacles feast of weeks they
[1:16:47] actually keep those and
[1:16:49] those friends starting Friday night
[1:16:52] because from our Friday night actually
[1:16:55] turns into Saturday s considered
[1:16:56] Saturday morning so from Friday night to
[1:16:59] Saturday night our time they don't do
[1:17:02] anything they stay at home they they
[1:17:05] don't try to cook very much
[1:17:07] they don't do any work now look I just
[1:17:10] went to the church to see this look at
[1:17:12] the sincerity of that they give up
[1:17:14] working on and all my friends they could
[1:17:16] work and make some overtime money they
[1:17:18] can make big bucks
[1:17:20] but they give a look how sincere they
[1:17:22] are they give up the money and all that
[1:17:25] because they actually think this is
[1:17:27] still in effect for them and
[1:17:30] they think that's actually this is God's
[1:17:33] seal or token for them
[1:17:36] but church what a greater thing now a
[1:17:39] lot of those people will do that but
[1:17:40] they'll remain in their same sins what a
[1:17:42] greater thing God gives us through the
[1:17:45] true token today the true Sabbath today
[1:17:48] resting from our works that we might do
[1:17:51] God's works amen praise God that's what
[1:17:54] the New Testament Sabbath is a corned
[1:17:56] Matthew 11 where Jesus says I'm going to
[1:17:58] give you rest for your souls and then
[1:18:00] Hebrews chapter 4 where we rest from our
[1:18:03] works as God did from his praise God
[1:18:06] amen because the Bible said there
[1:18:08] remained a rest for the people of God
[1:18:10] even after Moses and Joshua there still
[1:18:13] remained a rest and that was the rest
[1:18:15] for the soul the soul no no longer tries
[1:18:17] to work its own will when it's
[1:18:19] surrendered and it's filled with God's
[1:18:21] will by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:23] praise God amen thank the Lord
[1:18:26] so thank you for reading that lydian
[1:18:29] Malka praise God
[1:18:31] so Israel under the Mosaic Covenant
[1:18:34] worked six days
[1:18:37] right basically Sunday to Friday and
[1:18:40] they took the seventh off Saturday
[1:18:42] because the Lord made the earth in six
[1:18:45] days and rested on the Sabbath
[1:18:49] now there's a couple of portions I want
[1:18:51] to just reference here we're almost
[1:18:53] getting done here by God's grace the
[1:18:55] entire chapter of Deuteronomy 30
[1:18:58] expresses God's unfailing commitment to
[1:19:01] Israel and even the chapter he foretells
[1:19:05] them that they're going to fall away can
[1:19:07] you imagine that God is so he's just so
[1:19:10] straightforward and honest right you
[1:19:11] don't beat around the bush he blesses
[1:19:13] them but he tells him you're gonna
[1:19:14] eventually fall away he said I'm gonna
[1:19:17] scatter you all over the world yeah and
[1:19:21] you're gonna reject the forthcoming
[1:19:23] Messiah but God in Deuteronomy 30
[1:19:26] promises to gather Israel from all
[1:19:29] nations
[1:19:30] giving her a heart that completely loves
[1:19:32] him and causing her to forever possess
[1:19:35] the land of Palestine let's just read
[1:19:38] one verse in there
[1:19:41] Deuteronomy 30
[1:19:47] just because it'd be good to read it
[1:19:49] there so you have a little bit of
[1:19:51] background knowledge on it
[1:20:00] Deuteronomy 30
[1:20:18] now in verse
[1:20:21] 3 that then the LORD thy God will turn
[1:20:25] thy captivity and thy compassion upon
[1:20:27] thee and returning gather thee from all
[1:20:29] the nations whether the LORD thy God has
[1:20:32] scattered thee so God foretells them
[1:20:34] you're gonna backslide you're gonna be
[1:20:37] scattered but I'm gonna bring you back
[1:20:38] what amazing love praise God
[1:20:42] now look at verse 10 if thou shall
[1:20:45] hearken on the voice of the LORD thy God
[1:20:46] to keep his Commandments and his
[1:20:47] statutes which are written this book of
[1:20:49] the law and if thou turn unto the Lord
[1:20:52] thy God with all thine heart and with
[1:20:54] all thy soul praise God would it be
[1:20:57] scripture they sue you have time you
[1:20:59] want to read that I'm in numbers right
[1:21:01] now so my next book will be Deuteronomy
[1:21:03] or willing about that probably a month
[1:21:05] or two here
[1:21:08] praise God what a beautiful beautiful
[1:21:10] promise now couple more things the
[1:21:14] purpose of the Mosaic law
[1:21:16] along with the other things I said like
[1:21:18] law giver and ceremony and priesthood is
[1:21:22] also described in Galatians 3:24 the
[1:21:26] Bible says the law was our schoolmaster
[1:21:28] to bring us to Christ and I'm a
[1:21:31] schoolteacher so I really like this
[1:21:32] scripture praise God
[1:21:34] so the law teaches like a schoolmaster
[1:21:37] right a strict schoolmaster teacher the
[1:21:41] law teaches how evil we are to a holy
[1:21:44] God
[1:21:46] say because our sins demand a penalty
[1:21:50] they demand death and not and we just
[1:21:53] don't send once we sin all the time can
[1:21:56] I say just kind of plain like this the
[1:22:00] tabernacle of Moses was like a bloodbath
[1:22:03] there was just constant animals dying
[1:22:06] every morning every night and in between
[1:22:08] when they would have the the the
[1:22:11] families come in and offer sacrifice it
[1:22:13] was just blood death death death death
[1:22:16] all the time it was a teacher to show us
[1:22:19] how evil we weren't how we could never
[1:22:21] pay for our own sins we can never earn
[1:22:23] our own forgiveness that's why we need a
[1:22:25] real rest today praise God amen the
[1:22:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah to
[1:22:30] change our hearts
[1:22:31] see sins demand a penalty death and the
[1:22:36] law was added because of transgressions
[1:22:38] so God had to show us because we because
[1:22:41] of Noah's day every heart was only evil
[1:22:43] continually God had to add the law to
[1:22:46] show us the wickedness and the awful
[1:22:50] consequences of our sins and the Bible
[1:22:53] says where there's no law there's no
[1:22:55] transgression so we need even know we
[1:22:57] didn't the people didn't even know what
[1:22:59] they were doing really until the law
[1:23:01] pointed it out and showed how how wicked
[1:23:03] it really was I think how the law showed
[1:23:06] how wicked it was to talk back to your
[1:23:09] parents they can take out the child and
[1:23:11] stuff that's how wicked talking back to
[1:23:13] your parents is if a man or woman is
[1:23:16] caught in adultery both them caught were
[1:23:18] taken out the street and stoned
[1:23:20] instantly I
[1:23:22] mean that's this shows it was where
[1:23:25] there's no law there's no transgression
[1:23:27] so the law showed how evil the
[1:23:29] transgressions were and what God really
[1:23:31] thought of it
[1:23:34] what was all this wars all this blood
[1:23:36] all this bloodshed what was it for it
[1:23:38] was to teach us like a school teacher
[1:23:41] that we desperately need one sacrifice
[1:23:44] not all five of these different kinds
[1:23:47] and we don't need five we need one
[1:23:49] sacrifice to take away all of our sins
[1:23:52] praise God oh thank you Lord Jesus
[1:23:55] praise God we need one sacrifice and do
[1:23:58] away with all of it praise God
[1:24:00] because the law would continue till the
[1:24:03] seed should come according to Galatians
[1:24:06] 3:19 that promise see marry see praise
[1:24:09] God the seed of the woman the sea that
[1:24:12] would bruise the head of the serpent
[1:24:13] Jesus Christ that was prophesied in
[1:24:16] Adams covenant and then our need would
[1:24:20] be fully satisfied in the New Covenant
[1:24:22] through the death and resurrection of
[1:24:25] Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:24:27] thank the Lord
[1:24:28] let's read this so Lydia I think you're
[1:24:31] next
[1:24:32] six 41 and 42
[1:24:36] now this scripture is so important it
[1:24:39] highlights the principle that God's
[1:24:41] former covenant blessings remain true
[1:24:46] even in the current covenant so in other
[1:24:49] words if you're in the Mosaic Covenant
[1:24:51] previous promises from the previous
[1:24:53] covenants still apply to you and you can
[1:24:56] claim those promises oh praise God
[1:24:58] that's why that's why I'm for the new
[1:25:01] covenant where that's where to see the
[1:25:02] Abraham that's why children who can grow
[1:25:05] up and say God well the new covenant
[1:25:06] where that's where to see the Abraham
[1:25:08] that's why children who can grow up and
[1:25:10] say god bless me so I have a good job
[1:25:12] bless my family because I am the seed of
[1:25:15] Abraham I don't want to be cursed so
[1:25:19] lord help me to be careful when I say to
[1:25:21] curse people right
[1:25:22] but bless me because I want to be a
[1:25:26] blessing to others God's Word got a
[1:25:28] bless you you're Abraham's seed faith in
[1:25:30] Jesus Christ God will bless everything
[1:25:32] you've been praising God already is
[1:25:33] investing a lot of things you do praise
[1:25:35] God because you love the Lord so Lydia
[1:25:38] Leviticus 26 41 and 42
[1:25:47] there uncircumcised hearts be humbled
[1:25:50] and they then except of the punishment
[1:25:52] of their iniquity then will I remember
[1:25:54] my covenant with Jago but also I come to
[1:25:56] know with Isaac and also I covenant with
[1:25:58] Abraham will I remember and I will
[1:26:01] remember the land beautiful
[1:26:03] God tells them he said through Moses
[1:26:07] they possess the promised land fall away
[1:26:10] from the commands causing him to scatter
[1:26:12] the nations but then he promised I'll
[1:26:14] restore them to living back in Palestine
[1:26:17] when they confess their sins in genuine
[1:26:20] humility church that's all we need today
[1:26:22] is genuine repentance when Israel did
[1:26:26] that God would say then I'll remember my
[1:26:29] covenant with Abraham praise God and
[1:26:32] I'll remember the land amen what a
[1:26:34] blessing praise God see repentance
[1:26:37] activates the Covenant there is he that
[1:26:40] the the Jews that were scattered they
[1:26:43] won't get the Covenant blessings until
[1:26:45] they obey through repentance that's how
[1:26:48] it is today the comment of the New
[1:26:51] Testament it's not activated to me obey
[1:26:53] it to repent repentance activates God's
[1:26:57] promises amen praise God hallelujah
[1:27:01] God forever remembers his promises
[1:27:03] hallelujah
[1:27:05] even while living in Moses is covenant
[1:27:07] God will still remember Abraham's
[1:27:10] covenant to them to give Abraham seed
[1:27:13] the land of Palestine based upon the
[1:27:16] condition of their humble obedience
[1:27:18] right and we know we'll get there
[1:27:20] normally next week we know the New
[1:27:22] Covenant now is based upon our obedience
[1:27:24] as well it's based upon our obedience
[1:27:27] because the Bible says they can trodden
[1:27:30] underfoot the blood of the Covenant
[1:27:31] right it's in Hebrews we'll get to that
[1:27:33] that'll be a major Scripture people can
[1:27:35] stop on the blood of the Covenant so see
[1:27:39] the Covenant is only its condition it's
[1:27:41] only unconditional by God's
[1:27:43] foreknowledge amen I know it's
[1:27:46] conditional to us cuz we know we're not
[1:27:47] sure but it's unconditional by God's
[1:27:51] foreknowledge praise God
[1:27:53] thank the Lord
[1:27:56] hallelujah
[1:27:58] remember this humble confession so
[1:28:01] Leviticus 26 as Lydia read 41 to 42 it
[1:28:05] when is it fulfilled it's fulfilled in
[1:28:07] revelation 7 1 through 8 when the
[1:28:09] hundred forty-four thousand are sealed
[1:28:13] with the Holy Ghost praise God that's
[1:28:15] when it's fulfilled because that's when
[1:28:16] they really humble themselves really
[1:28:18] repent the fountains are over the house
[1:28:20] of David and the Holy Spirit looks down
[1:28:23] upon and fills their souls amen praise
[1:28:25] God thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah thank
[1:28:28] the Lord
[1:28:30] thank you lord
[1:28:32] so see the Mosaic Covenant is the
[1:28:35] current covenant blinded Israel is under
[1:28:38] this moment because they rejected the
[1:28:40] the New Covenant so they're under the
[1:28:43] Old Covenant
[1:28:46] now of course some Jews didn't accept it
[1:28:48] like you know Peter Paul and other
[1:28:50] remnant Jews Paul calls them remnant
[1:28:53] Jews in Romans 10 and 11 they accepted
[1:28:56] Christ
[1:28:57] but despite casting away the
[1:29:01] despite casting away the New Covenant
[1:29:04] the blinded Israel can still be blessed
[1:29:07] from all the previous covenants right
[1:29:11] how many understand that Noah's Covenant
[1:29:15] still blesses everybody sinner or Saint
[1:29:18] right it's so blessed because it was
[1:29:19] made to everybody so everybody's blessed
[1:29:22] that's how it is with Israel even though
[1:29:25] they turned on the new one they still
[1:29:26] have Moses's they still have Abraham's
[1:29:29] they still have no us to fall back upon
[1:29:32] we say to fall back upon
[1:29:35] now there's my hour so let me try to
[1:29:37] close I think I'm almost done here
[1:29:41] so any minded Jew who receives God's
[1:29:45] covenant blessings
[1:29:47] will receive them if they sincerely love
[1:29:50] God and obey his commands God cannot
[1:29:54] cast away all Israel because he promised
[1:29:57] to bless them and never forget faithful
[1:30:00] Jews when read some scriptures about
[1:30:02] that net as we close here
[1:30:04] so Moses covenant began about 1500 years
[1:30:07] before Christ and it actually ended for
[1:30:10] Jesus followers it ended at the
[1:30:13] resurrection praise God
[1:30:16] or you might say the cross it's finished
[1:30:19] but then he had to raise in order
[1:30:21] to show he conquered and defeated death
[1:30:24] hell in the grave
[1:30:26] but the Mosaic Covenant still continues
[1:30:29] for blinded Jews now let's read this
[1:30:31] scripture been waiting the reader here
[1:30:32] is Isaiah 49
[1:30:34] 13 through 16 so if you got your Bibles
[1:30:37] Isaiah 49 13 through 16
[1:30:42] says sing o heavens and be joyful o
[1:30:44] earth and break forth into singing o
[1:30:46] mountains for the LORD hath comforted
[1:30:49] his people and have mercy upon his
[1:30:52] afflicted but Zion said the LORD hath
[1:30:54] forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten
[1:30:57] me so that's what Israel say I'm
[1:30:59] forsaken I'm forgotten but God answers
[1:31:02] back he said can a woman forget her
[1:31:03] suckling child but she should not have
[1:31:06] compassion on her over her on the son of
[1:31:09] her womb yay they may forget yet will I
[1:31:12] not forget thee behold I have grave and
[1:31:15] me upon the palms of my hands thy walls
[1:31:18] are continually before me praise God so
[1:31:22] God even tells Israel I've engraved you
[1:31:24] on the palms of our hands why cuz Jesus
[1:31:28] was sent to the house of Israel to pay
[1:31:30] the price for Israel's sins and he even
[1:31:33] on the cross Jesus even said Father
[1:31:34] forgive them they don't know what
[1:31:37] they're doing praise God so any Jew that
[1:31:39] honestly loves and serves God though
[1:31:41] blinded can still be saved that's the
[1:31:44] mystery God's God's mystery of Israel's
[1:31:47] blindness during the church age well
[1:31:49] let's stand praise God in your home
[1:31:50] there by the grace of God
[1:31:53] God can never forget his people Israel
[1:31:56] even for told them you're gonna fall
[1:31:58] away but I'll bring you back praise God
[1:32:00] now remember my covenant to Abraham I
[1:32:02] remember the the Mosaic Covenant he said
[1:32:05] then I'll Mount Zion I open up the house
[1:32:08] and on the fountain of David praise God
[1:32:11] and the spirit of grace and supplication
[1:32:13] will pour upon you praise God and my
[1:32:17] people will be called by my name again
[1:32:20] praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah
[1:32:23] may be Lord willing Sunday we look at
[1:32:25] the Davidic covenant and then the new
[1:32:28] covenant and the eternal covenant praise
[1:32:31] god what a blessing let's remember these
[1:32:33] great blessings Church here as we
