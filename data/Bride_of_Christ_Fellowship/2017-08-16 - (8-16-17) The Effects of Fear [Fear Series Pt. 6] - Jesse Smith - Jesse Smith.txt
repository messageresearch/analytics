[Applause] - is word race I'd like to continue on here tonight again by the grace of the Lord I want to look at the effects of beards now I will look at the effects of fear and hopefully we'll get on another angle and overcoming and I just want to look at that year God's grace I like to read out numbers 13 go there numbers 13 [Music] now we know the story here this is where Israel's at Kadesh Barnea and I want to look at the effects of fear in this story now Sunday we had just a wonderful time looking at the seven nations that Joshua conquered by God's grace and they shared that with some brothers this week and they're really blessed by that I was just so burden I just I'm so thankful for I want to share with somebody so they enjoyed that and I hope you enjoyed it too as I can see myself battle those constantly amen and thank the Lord for the victory that we have but I want to remember this story here before they went over they had to spend 40 more years in the earnest because they let fear take ahold of the entire congregation I'm gonna skip down let's go to verse 27 just because of sake of time here I wanna make sure I'm very mindful of time verse 27 and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sent us us and surely it flows with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there I'm gonna skip ahead you know Caleb stills the people we taught it we taught that today in youth group before service let's go to verse 31 so caleb stills the people it gets everybody quiet and he gives them a word of faith but they turn from it they reject his word of faith they don't receive it verse 31 but the men that went up him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched under the turn of Israel saying the land which though I'm sorry through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of anak Enoch which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight a man s power has a word of Prayer you have a need on your heart just money make it known unto God as we approach the word Heavenly Father we love you tonight again we thank you for the prayers and the songs come thou fount of every blessing come now sweet Holy Spirit Lord God as we're gathered we're calling upon the name of Jesus Christ may the holy spirit of Jesus Christ come now be with us lord give us every blessing we need for tonight Lord God I don't know who this is for no doubt for me Lord as I believe it's a timely message the Lord may it be for everyone Lord to be able to hear the Word of God we know this is your divine plan this is Lord the way to grow as a Christian is to hear the word because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God if we want to get closer to your Lord this is your divine plan to gather acept and assemble together to pray to worship to pull upon you Lord God may we pull out a blessing from your heart or as I know your heart is open Lord ready to give us blessings ready to give us your word your promise is Lord let us have faith to receive and Lord we thank you may you give us everything we have need of in Jesus Christ's name we mature said amen god bless you didn't see their praise god someone look at the effects of fear tonight by God's grace I 1 look at a few of them now like I said there's over I think 700 verses on fear I haven't gone over them all yet but I want to just bring out I think I have about 11 effects or maybe 10 effects that we can clearly see through Scripture that I think will be a blessing to us tonight by the grace of the Lord so the first one we saw is our first effective fear now recall that fear is a spirit and I like when our sister Marie gave a testimony she said I battled a certain thing for so many years but after we preached the spirit of fear she could identify what it was remember that when she testified she can now identify it and once you can identify something then you can overcome it praise God but see like brother Branham said that demons got to be what exposed and thank God that the word exposes every one of those demons amen that we battle that we face that we go through trials against Hill expose everyone we just got to trust in his word amen so we see that and we're thankful that we recognize the spirit of fears not from God God gives power love and a sound mind praise the Lord so the first thing we see through this story is that fear is contagious cuz caleb stills the people he tells everybody be quiet he gives him the promise that God gave to Moses right beforehand and it's not enough and fear spreads from ten to two million can you imagine that that's just like how social media works right you know somebody post something crazy it'll spread like wildfire whether it's good or good or bad it'll spread and so ten people are able to influence 2 million not but two people because they stay true to God what God does when God's gonna carry out his word he ignores the 2 million right allows all them to die in the wilderness and God raised up the next generation someone that will believe the Word of God amen God never forgot that little group that couple believers God never forgot them what God did was preserve them amen God preserved the few that actually believed even though everybody else fell away and unbelief and fear and they doubted God's promise God just did away with them and let some time go by he raised up those two along with a new generation and took him in the promised land amen God always honors faith aren't you glad hallelujah he always honors faith so fear is contagious fear also keeps people from their destiny or their their inheritance kind of say like that it keeps us from our inheritance it keeps us from the promises that God has for us and we preach on that last year about how you can lose rewards we're familiar with that how a saw lost the reward of having the kingdom forever as I mentioned numerous times but I want to bring that to us again it's contagious and then if it's so serious God's Word is so serious that if if we let fear get victory in the moment when we should have it at the wrong time it can keep someone from there I'm sorry from their divine destiny or divine inheritance amen praise the Lord next this is pretty striking let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 1 this is really striking to me God looks back later a few years after numbers 13 and has Moses right due to Romney remember Deuteronomy pne's two laws or the second time the law is preached Moses read everybody the law after Mount Sinai you know he got the Ten Commandments and so forth sorry he got the Ten Commandments and then towards the end of his life God had him rehearsed the law to the people that was the book of Deuteronomy it was a second time around amen a second time around the law let's go through this one more time let's rehearse where God's brought us and let's go over it that's what the book of Deuteronomy is so Deuteronomy 1 now verses 19 to 46 is Moses rehearsing what happened to the old generation at Kadesh Barnea but let's just go if we can diverse 29 so Deuteronomy 129 give me a minute as they get there you'd around me 129 I want to end at 32 that's the one I want to get to this is quite a thought here I want you to see this verse 29 dude r129 remember Moses at the end of his life he's rehearsing what happened at Kadesh Barnea years earlier then I said I knew you'd read not neither be afraid of them the Lord your God which goes before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou has seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee as a man doth bear a son in all the way that ye went until you came into this place yet in this thing he did not believe the Lord your God who went in the way before you to search you out a place to picture tension and fire by night to show you by what way he should go in a cloud by day and the Lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swear saying surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land which I swear to give unto your father's save Caleb the son of Jephunneh he shall see it and to him will I give the land that he does I'm sorry that he hath trodden upon to his because yes wholly followed the Lord now 32 is what I wanted I was so striked when I heard this yeah and this thing you did not believe the Lord your God so Church fear shows a lack of faith praise the Lord very very simple but very powerful here the fact that they were scared of God of taking God's promise showed they didn't believe God to begin with praise the Lord Oh mine now many of these people they ended up dying in the wilderness right almost all of them except these two and then the new generation and remember the Bible said a mixed multitude left Egypt not and fear proved their fear at the very gates there we'd say the very the very doorway to go the promised land their fear right there show they never believed God in the first place I don't know about you but I want to have I want to show God my faith amen I don't want to be one who who shiza weigh in and then my fear shows I don't believe God I want to be one that can take a challenge upon because I know God's with me amen but if if we come to a spot and we you know people come to a spot and they can't overcome or they shrink away many times it's because they don't have faith to begin with they didn't believe in the first place we've all seen how many people come in here get baptized and a little you know they get a little persecution from their family or they get a little financial trial and they give up on God and that shows they didn't and then they fall away in the sin it shows they didn't believe in God in the first place right they never really had real faith or maybe he fell away like the seed fell by the wayside or fell upon the rocks they really didn't have the faith they didn't have the good heart like they needed to withstand and hold on to the faith I'll say like that the seed of God's Word so that's a very striking very important scriptures that you see that fears contagious fear keeps people from their destiny and fear shows they didn't believe in the first place many times especially in that case of Israel oh my important to see that next I want you to see another one I think also shows that someone is selfish many times they can be selfish they only think about themselves what a judge is seven let's go to judges seven here I think we can see that this is a selfish motive here instead of thinking about others fear makes us only think about ourselves in our own life and that's selfish because we all we think about is ourselves o'mine judges 7 verse 1 and remember the opposite of self selfish is selfless and that's the definition of love love think if not her own right first Corinthians 13 charity think it's not her own charity doesn't bond itself up charity serves other people hope saw and doers all right believes all charity is all about other people not just ourselves Amen now in verse two judges 72 and the Lord said unto Gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the many nights in their hands lest Israel Vaught themselves against me saying mine own hand has saved me now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people say whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from the mount gilead and their return to the people 20 and 2000 and they remained ten thousand so God says any one that God preaches through Gideon any one that's afraid leave right so it shows they were selfish they were thinking about themselves rather than the army praise God you ever see people like that they're not really in it for the cause of the group they're only in it for each other they're only in something for what they can get right they're only in it because well I'm going to get a reward at the end remember when those people follow Jesus member and they only went to foul Jesus because the food he gave him over that in John chapter 10 I believe it is the only when Jesus said you're only following me because of the food I'm giving you he said but the bread I'm giving you but he said I am the bread of life amen and Jesus cared about him he cared about their natural needs they were hungry he had compassion upon them but when it came down to it he knew they were only there for their own belly selfish instead of wanting to fight and die with the army well they say well I got a spare my life I need to I need to spare myself mine and it only thought about oneself now go to exodus for us again another example Moses in Exodus for all he could think about was himself so fear many times is selfish it keeps us from going into as we said our inheritance or we might say in more modern terms to get out of our comfort zone well I've only ever done this brother Jesse I can't go into something else or or brother sister so and so I could never do that I could never help you out because of this suit I couldn't help with the money or whatever I couldn't do this because I just I've never done that before and so it's selfish it actually limits what God wants to do through you amen we must be open to seeing what God wants more to do in us like I like I want to see what else God can do I see what God has done in me but I want to see what more you can do in me what else can he do praise God what else can I heal too so that God can use me I just don't do the same things over and over that's fine if they're good things but I want to see what more could God do amen what more does God want to use me for for his glory and I don't want to be selfish and say well I could never do that I could never have faith for that I want to be open to following the leadership of the Lord now in Exodus 4 verse 10 let's go there you're familiar but let's look at it from this thought God had told him I'm gonna give you two signs but look at verse 10 and Moses sending the Lord oh my lord I'm not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou has spoken unto thy servant but I'm slow of speech and of a slow tongue now Church God had just told him I'm gonna go with you plus I'm gonna give you two signs so he had three assurances already as if three wasn't enough three assurances I'm with you brother Adam and I'm giving you these two tools like I'm gonna do a job let's say we're into a job I'm with you Lydia and I'm gonna give you these two tools to do the job all that assurance and all she can think of is himself Oz he can think of he didn't even see how God had agree forgot got it equipped him and he looked at all just at himself we got a look at what God's equipped us with the Word of God had the message of the hour that's what God's equipped us with amen that's right so he looks at himself I'm slow speech I'm slow tongue and the Lord senator who hath made man's mouth I like that or who who make it the dumb or the deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord God made them this way now therefore go and I'll be with your mouth and teach the what now shout saying he said o my lord send I pray thee by the hand of him whom now will send and now God gets upset verse 14 he said law in other words just Lord just used whoever you want to send and gods aren't down like no I'm sending you not making excuse to stop being selfish stop looking at yourself look at the command I'm giving you praise God and the anger the Lord was kindled against Moses because he kept pushing off and say somebody else somebody else somebody else too selfish and he said is not hearing the Levite thy brother I know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he see at thee he will be glad in his heart okay and so God gives him Aaron because he's so afraid because he's so fearful God gives him Aaron to talk oh my look how look how look how wonderful God is look how he'll give us whatever we need to get the victory if God has a plan for our lives despite our fears my despite our excuses God is gonna get the job done amen despite our mistakes despite our fears despite our excuses despite how he equips us and yet we doubt it God is gonna get the job done that's a real encouragement amen hallelujah so we see that now fear can be selfish like with the 20 mm and Gideon's army or Moses all they can look at is themselves they can't look beyond themselves even to God's Bible we'd say or God's promise so we must not be selfish we must be selfless amen now we saw this already but I want to I want to go to this one again here fear makes a person useless in God's kingdom now we just saw it with judges 7 let's go to Matthew 20 525 I want to go back to this one at the 2525 fear makes people useless and God's kingdom I'm sure we'd all we all pressed out here on the Wednesday night I'm sure we'd all say Lord I want to be useful for your kingdom I want to be a useful tool that you can use Lord so if we want to be like that we got to be able to take we have to take the Word of God in our heart and act upon the Word of God like we like even tonight like example praying for Jose's friend there who's on who's off life support we just gotta we gotta take ahold of that we can't shriek back or try to say a prayer of faith we got to have faith amen we got to wake up the faith inside of us and use the faith that we have if God lets it come to pass praise the Lord but if not we can't back down in fear well I could never pray that prayer of faith we got to take God at His Word use the faith that we have now Matthew 25 25 and we're just want to rehearse this I think of course we're very familiar with it and you know I honestly don't know if this person is lost or not like I don't know if they go to hell or not because in other types brother branham uses or gnashing of teeth as the tribulation so I don't know if this is exactly person lost or not but remember this is where Jesus comes back and he asked the five talent man you know what are you done with my five talents the three talent man and now he comes to the one talent man now let's go up above that Malachi to verse 24 I'm sorry then he which had received the one talent came and said lord I knew that I knew thee that thou are in a hard man reaping where thou has not sown and gathering where thou has not straud I don't understand that because God is not a hard man I don't not sure about that I think this person had a misunderstanding of God to myself verse 25 and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine so God gave him an amount of money and he was scared he was scared of the Lord for this reason he thought God reaped where he didn't sow so he thought God was unjust he thought God would just take from anybody and so he was scared to lose what God gave him right so he didn't invest in it he didn't go take it out and later Jesus says you at least should have took it to the bank to get interest you should at least got interest on this money he was too lazy or too scared to even do that right and so the Bible says later he hid god's talent now let me just stop here on my notes I put this some people will hide a desire to sing a song special and they'll never sing a song special some people will hide a desire to preach some people hide a desire to go witnessing even out on the streets like I was so encouraged brother Simon and brother Mike the guy in the wheelchair they went out in Toledo and sit on the corner and preached for two hours last Saturday night I was so encouraged by that I thought praise to the Lord there get there just so stirred up they got to do something I like that but some people instead of going to do that they'll hide that and they won't act upon what they know got if God give you ability let's say even financially God give you the money financially to help somebody out and they hide that say well if I give that I won't have anything else they hide the leading that God gives them can't understand what I'm saying they hide that leading you know what I heard a sermon and the examples some of the examples like people have a desire to teach Sunday school but they hide that talent see I couldn't I don't could never do that or I could never already have a tail I like to help the church out but I'm scared I'll mess up anything that God's called us to do if God's given us the word for then God will give us the ability to start it and finish it amen but we must not hide the talent God's given us the ability the desire he's he's got to do it I'll never forget when I first started to make videos for YouTube I was so scared what people are gonna think it was - that is our since 2006 brother Adam 2006 and I finally put out my first video in 2013 I was scared for most of those years for almost 6 years but in 2012 when we were at Waterloo I started practicing videos and I started looking at how did the guy do this and how they and I was scared to stepping from the camera you can watch them some of my first videos I kind of look like I'm a little nervous because I was scared what would people say are they gonna drag my name in the dirt yeah I had a little bit of persecution but it's just very small and I was so scared what if I mess up on the video what if I mess up on the scriptures what if I mess up on this what if what are people gonna say I was so scared for numerous years I didn't do anything and finally I just said forget about it I've got to do something for God amen I just know I felt led to do this other people like brother Samuel here is here last time he said well Jesse I could never step in front of a camera I can never do that I'm thinking yeah you could now he might not be able to but in other words he recognized that it took some type of faith to do that and not only does it take faith it takes a lot of time to make those videos it takes a lot of time a lot of hours a lot of effort a lot of time that's why the Bible so you have to labor in the Word of God it's a work it's labor to sit there rightly divide and pray and say God lead me here or should I emphasize this or do that but God help me get out fear in 2013 and since then now we got almost 1,700 subscribers and a over 160 thousand views praise God and that's just one example of where I was afraid to do it and but God gave me grace after prayer and waiting upon the Lord and taking a step and investing in something and God gave me and now I can see results from it Amen that's just a little testimony from my heart scared to do it and then did it all I was scared the first time I went preaching I remember I was so scared but I knew there's just I got to get up there and I'm glad I went by God's grace and other people are glad I've preached too because it's not me it's Christ in me with any gift any good because it's not my money it's his money it's not my preaching gift it's his preaching gift how you see that it's not me it's him Amen I just got to invest in that I've got to go work at it and I've got to put this money to use amen see it verse 27 you oughta therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury I could at least got some interest on that now take therefore the town for a man give it to the one with ten towns remember the Bible says if you're faithful little he'll make you ruler over he's going to take all the things all the rewards and other people lost all the responsibility right and the Bible said will rule over Nations remember that he's gonna take these nations away from these sinners and give it to the bride members and we are gonna rule over Nations I still can't get my head around that I still can't understand that but that's what Christ is gonna do if I'm faithful this little church and Jesus says well done well then I expect he'd make me ruler over something more because that's what His Word says we must be faithful and what God gives us and then he'll bless us at the end of it amen now okay there in his verse 30 and caste the unprofitable servant into outer darkness and there should be weeping and gnashing of teeth now he might just go through the I don't I don't know if he's saved or not it doesn't seem like a foolish virgin it seems really awful because of the way he talks way the way Christ talks about him it looks like he's lost but I would let you know there are scriptures where the tribulation talks about or the tribulation speaks of weeping and gnashing of teeth in the book of Revelation I know that because it's on one of the videos I'm gonna produce soon for the book of Revelation so I don't know if he saved her or not but let's say let's say he's lost right let's say he's lost that means someone can have a genuine gift of God as we know like Balaam and Judas and they can not invest in that gift and use it the right way if they misuse God's gift they can get to the spot where they're not even saved they never even receive salvation and what did that fear did that fear fear kept them from even getting saved fear kept them from even investing they hid the talent in the earth I remember what the earth represented carnality remember clay earth carnality met from sunday are you not yet carnal Paul said Envy strives divisions right exalting best preacher above that preacher that's carnal in the head and so he invest he takes his tail and he hides it in carnality he just lives a carnal life and just you know feeds his flesh and and meets the needs it just does what his body wants to do instead of what God called him to do amen we wonder what God called us to do now I want to look at a few more scriptures that go along with this now also remember I want to I got this one too but gifts of the Spirit you know like divine healing words of knowledge words of wisdom discernment right judging is the Spirit of God or not any of these gifts if they're buried in the earth that's the big time trouble you're getting in trouble of Jesus that's why we at some point we got to have gifts operating in the church you believe that I believe that vault my heart if we're all believers and we all got at least one gift or something like that then we want to see the operate at some time in the future by the grace of the Lord because we got to invest in that how do you mess in that gift pray about it amen pray about it pray about it and say God whatever gifts her in my life bring it out just let me live consecrated to you amen remember he said get duty said don't major on the gift major on getting love and then when you got love then God will automatically use your gifts so that's the thing we should just fall in love with Jesus more and more amen just find more ways to love and more reasons to love him and then God will begin using our gifts amen that's right that's right I believe that follow my heart now remember let's go to Revelation 21:8 let's read that one again so you're familiar with that one Revelation 21:8 this was I meant me I mentioned this the first sermon but there will be people that will be lost all because of fear instead of having faith to be saved they chose to live a life of fear of God and this is the wrong fear and they'll be lost because lately they let fear rule their life instead of faith just like people will let adultery rule their lives instead of faith right they'll let money Mammon riches they'll let that rule their life instead of faith they'll never surrender to Christ and even have faith in Christ Jesus so this is one of them the very first one Jesus says this or the Bible says is but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable murderers whoremongers sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death now that sounds like weeping and burning and gnashing of teeth doesn't it oh my it sounds like that talent one talent man who had to get from God just hid it from everybody hid it from the world or hid it from the church he just put it in the world and was scared to use God's gift my so because of fear some people will go to hell that's right we can see that from the scripture so if I say like this fear not only is contagious but fear will destroy a man's soul right now what the scripture says the fearful fear being afraid of God and not surrendering to God and and not having any faith at all that will destroy a man so because it's unbelief amen it's unbelief in God's perfect plan the Bible said a fool shall not err in the way of salvation you remember that from Isaiah 35 a fool not err in that that's how wonderful this plan is that's how easy it is to understand the gospel amen even a fool can't get this wrong it's so easy to see Christ died for you trust in him believe in him one time I heard a man explain it like a parachute he said we're all in a plane the plane of the world and either this plane is going to crash or you can jump out but before you jump out what should you put on you better put on a parachute and that parachute is faith in Christ because the Bible said put you on the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but people won't put that on and then jump out and trust the Word of God that's been spoken but we can do that I jumped out a long time ago I jumped out about 18 years ago hallelujah I took my jacket my parachute of faith and I jumped out and some I'm leaving the things of the world I'm leaving this plane that's bomb for destruction and I'm gonna jump out and I'm gonna sail down in the skies of the grace of God and I'm gonna land softly in God's kingdom amen that's right I'm trusting in Christ my faith is in Christ he's locked around me in other words he's sealed in me I'll say it like that amen but see people will stay in the plane because they're scared the parachute won't work they're scared it won't come out did you ever jump out of a plane brother Adam no okay I never did it either my aunt has my tad sixties maybe I shouldn't say her age but my aunt's in her 60s and she's jumped out of planes I just haven't had the time or opportunity but I like to do that someday but yeah you have to have faith to do that you got to trust the parachute but see people in this natural case it's really easy to see people won't jump out because they're afraid now my mother lost a me when she was here she's dumped out of the plane but she had a specialist strapped to her back that's just like Jesus though she's got a person who's specially trained we've got somebody who's done it before amen glory because Christ took all of the father's words at his word and believed all the father's word amen and he jumped out so far hallelujah that he fell all the way down to hell and then came back up yeah by the grace of God by the promise of God amen that's right but those that are fearful are gonna stay in the play that's why our children you know we never know when a service will be when these children will give their hearts to the Lord and our faith should encourage their faith they should look over and be able to see us raise our hands or praying or worshiping God or a mending the Word of God and our love for Christ should be contagious to them hey man and they should be able to leave their fear and now I've talked to some of my little children they say well I'm scared if I get baptized everybody's gonna be looking at me right and we how many can relate to that I can relate to that when I first got saved children I was scared to raise my hands even I was so scared but as time went by I first I started like this then I could go a little higher and now I can go like this and praise the Lord you know just I'm just reading the spirit I know God loves me and I love him amen I don't do this for show I do it because I'm free and I have liberty in Christ Jesus and nobody can take my liberty amen I'm free in Christ but yordan even them our love for God should create such an atmosphere that they should want to fall into the love and then they won't be scared about God I believe that we never know we want to just be full of love and we want to be full of faith and cast out all the fear praise God that we can trust in the Word of God if we jump if we jump into Christ he's gonna open Amen he's gonna open to us he's gonna protect us amen now let's go to mark 5:15 here's another people that seem like they'll probably get the same destiny as this talent one town man here remember was the people of God the gadarenes remember this can you imagine mark 5:15 you imagine the the God and healer of heaven and earth comes down to your country and he casts out all the Legion of demons and does the greatest miracle probably this the city has ever seen and instead of rallying around this gift they get scared and say get out of here this is ass and Jesus said woe unto these cities now this is an example where fear will drive people to reject Christ and I believe if they didn't repent of course they would have went to hell this is a good example of the fearful they're scared of this power like brother Branham said I chopped it up a little bit but he said they'd rather have their they're dirty filthy stinking pigs they'd rather have the dirty filthy stinking pigs and have the Lord Jesus Christ and how many people say they'd rather have the dirty filthy stinking movies or drugs or alcohol right or gossip or money they'd rather have the dirty stinking money and all these things then have the purity of the Lord Jesus Christ bye and what did it fear did it fear let's read that mark 5:15 and they came to Jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the Legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid right and what do they do next they sent him away they said get out of our land we'd rather have the pigs and the demons than we'd have the Lord Jesus Christ see how fear see how powerful fears fear will destroy people's souls that's why that's one of those examples the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of God my so fear destroys a man's soul fears contagious makes a person uses in the kingdom of God makes a person selfish and one of them too with the judges we could have said that to fear makes you isolated right because those soldiers left the rest of their army right it isolates them from the real army of God and what causes people to leave church many times fear well I wonder what they're well if I come back the brothers gonna preach on me well if I could if I come back everybody's gonna look down upon me I come back I've got a face brother so-and-so er I've gotta face this or so and so on and I don't want any confrontation what keeps them away from the army of God fear does fear isolates them well I could never face this person again or I could never trust this person again what does it fear does it not the effects of fear Church my goodness let's do it one more here Matthew 25:41 let's go there Matthew 25:41 this is familiar again but I just want to bring out these I'm just looking at different angles here tonight maybe nothing new I just want to bring this on a different angle Matthew 25:41 this is of course this is the goats or the people likening the goats on the left hand of Jesus remember and we see here the reasons that they don't receive eternal life okay verse 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was a hungered and he gave me no meat I was thirsty and you gave me no drink so as we go think about these giving somebody food giving them a drink number 43 I was a stranger and he took me not in so shelter giving somebody shelter naked and he clothes me not giving somebody clothes sick and in prison and you visited me not so visiting the sick and those in prison just those five things Church just those five things and we know the story when did we when did we see you and they said well when you did it not to Lysa these my brother now I'm just bringing out the possibility fear could have kept these people from not doing these things especially in countries of the persecution right oh I'm a Muslim but if I do something nice for a Christian I'm fearful what they'll do to me see that see how fear could keep somebody from doing that if I if I invite somebody into my house Oh what could they do well they might do something bad or the angels of God might protect you right I mean right that's what we see here oh if I give my money if I give my clothes I want might not have anymore I'm scared I might not have anymore well there's fear and that's fear like cripples a man's soul right it cripples men and women's souls we know that there's another one it destroys the soul fear feeds other bad behaviors even racism go to Galatians 2:12 remember this one I preached on go I please preach the series on Galatians into in 2015 so most people probably remember but Galatians 2:12 I don't know if you did that I preached through the whole book remember Peter rebukes I'm sorry Paul rebukes Peter to the face why because Peter stopped eating with the Gentiles he showing a form of racism how many know racism's live and well today like with Charlottesville and all these evil things happening racism is alive and well in Peters case what fed his racism was fear he was scared look at the scripture for before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision he was so scared of what the Jews what would the Jews think if I eat with the Gentiles he was so afraid he stopped eating with Christians who were all washed by the same blood of Jesus Christ so this is a form of racism right and what if people can have racism they I'm scared I I never talked to African American before I never talked to an Asian before I never talked to a Spaniard or Mexican I never I never ate with a Spanish person before I never and God's give us a nice good bouquet of Nations amen here so we appreciate that we love that but we shouldn't be scared to be with any believer now his was because of all you know they're unclean you know so maybe some carryover from the Old Testament but either way fear led his segregation right like just like we talked about so fear will lead to other behaviors that aren't maybe so evil on the outside Peter has already filled the Holy Ghost Church he wasn't gonna lose his soul but he was gonna lose his fellowship with the Saints and Paul rebuked him to his face and said you're to be blamed the body of Christ should have no division because of fear we should all be one body so feared Rome to say I can't eat with you I'm sorry can enough knew with you I'm scared with the other I'm Sarah with these other brothers are gonna say I'm gonna scared they're not gonna invite me back I'm scared they're gonna speak about me let him speak about you be full of love amen let's not be full of fear why did Pilate crucify Jesus because he feared the Jews the Bible says feared the Jews a member his wife was so scared member she sent through the messenger saying have nothing to do with him so that fear fed from his wife all the way to him so the Jews there and then pilots wife all fed and see how that fear is contagious led to some awful decisions we must never act by fear unless it's the right kind of fear reverence but let us not act by fear the evil spirit of fear now go to Titus 1:9 here's another one where preachers especially are supposed to be able to overcome fear in order to keep fear from spreading in the church so let me just read this so this is something I I should be expected to do if somebody comes in here with false doctrine somebody tries to spread false doctrine we should all try to help the person who's off the word but especially the preacher has to stand there and not be afraid and has to stand there maybe talk to the person and pull them out or something like that if whenever there's a false doctrine being taught okay look at verse 9 the speaking of elders or bishops which we know as pastors Bishop means overseer the pastor oversees the flock holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and convince the gainsayers so Evers gainsaying whoever's trying to draw people with false doctrine the pastor has to stand there and show how they're wrong and convinced him that they're wrong he can't be afraid and say well this person is the richest person we got in the church better not say anything against their faith he's the biggest type err she's the biggest tithe fair whoever is bringing the false word the pastor must stand there and speak against it verse 10 for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers especially the circumcision in this case in this century was the Jews whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre sake look at this look at this doctrine here look at the doctrine whose mouths must be stopped I'm sorry already pretty say that okay one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are always liars evil beasts and slow bellies and look what Paul says this witness is true did you catch that a prophet a prophet prophesied that these cretians those who live in Crete these Jews that live in Crete the Prophet said thus saith the Lord these are liars evil beasts and slow bellies and Paul said he was true see how the Holy Ghost will sometimes call some pretty harsh names right that's why we got to be humble but not too humble right Church this is apostolic and how many believe we got the faith of the Apostolic fathers sometimes preachers got to call things black and white right can't be scared and that's why I never by God's grace I never try to come up here and purposely preach on anybody or anything but if I'm under the anointing and I just feel out of the Lord and I've got such Liberty I may have to call off some certain things that I don't I don't know Mert necessarily wouldn't do but I believe if it's the right motivation it's the same spirit that did this that stood up to these sinners and stood against the false doctrine stood against the fleshly desires and had to call black black and white white the preachers have to do that they have to stand there brother cam last week had two people visit his church that are going around the nation now to all these message churches accusing any using all these people false doctrine and brother cam said he had to stand out there in the vestibule while everybody and visitors are watching and these brothers are telling cam and his family they're going to be lost and perish because of certain things we believe we believe the same things and brother cam had to stand there and with stand them and God it was a great testimony maybe cameltoe when he comes but cam was so humble but yet so firm he said if I'm wrong and I got the wrong spirit let's go in there and pray and you pray the devil off me that's the right spirit the brother said oh no no no no and so see that proof cam have the right spirit because if you had the wrong one he was willing to get it off and that's what a real Christian is if I'm wrong I want to know I'm wrong if I'm wrong in a sermon meat knock on my door after the service or meet me out there if I'm wrong I want to know I'm wrong like on Monday morning I had an email at 8 a.m. that said brother Jesse I didn't really agree with your teaching on the earrings on Sunday remember I taught on the earrings and it's not even a person in our church a wonderful godly person but I just had to watch that I just had to watch that and I had to explain to the dear person maybe they're watching tonight praise the Lord and then I explained a dear person my life and our life speak that we would never even wear clip-on earrings but if my example was if a woman came out of the world or a woman just came out of the denomination's it came to the church and she's wearing clip-on earrings I cannot condemn that by the Word of God because the Bible doesn't condemn that the Bible condemns when you make a mark on your body and bore holes in your ears that's what the Bible condemns praise the Lord that's the story I'm giving right and I'm trying to teach the Word of God what you see we have to be able to give answers praise God amen we have to be able to give answers but I said of course you know I believe brother branham's example you know we don't we don't wear we don't wear clip-ons and I would hope if a sister came in the church and she wore clip-ons for a while pretty soon she look at our sisters and she look at our sisters and see oh they don't wear earrings well I guess I don't have to either did you know brother hos they got me that generations book did you know Billy Paul branham's second wife Boyce she wore pants the whole time after she got saved and married to Billy Paul and brother Branham and his wife never rebuked them never starting every buked her until the Holy Spirit brought it to her attention one day and said huh and this is years after she been going to the tabernacle they never come out and said you Bob you Bominable woman and that's part of her testimony to read the testimony now brother Branham of course would blast it from the pulpit but in private he wouldn't just you know in a prideful way rebuke her he would just you know love her and just be kind and everything and she said that was what taught her so much about love you that's rebuke from the pulpit but if somebody doesn't know you have to feel led to go rebuke them right just don't go in different and rebuke anybody and put your finger under everybody's nose it's wrong and make yourself the Big Shot right you got to have wisdom on how to correct people and that's one example that's what I was using with the woman with if a woman who come in here with clip-ons I would let our love speak louder than our arrogance and God hopefully we don't by God's grace we don't have any arrogance separate I understand that by the grace of Lord a pastor has to rightly divide these things and stay with the Word of God stay with the word of truth hope that's understandable to you by the grace of Lord so see Titus basically shows that pastors can't be afraid they've got to be able to stand on the Word of God and tell the truth because the Word of God is unfailing the Word of God is forever settled in heaven amen okay let me get closing here I got okay 17 more minutes that'd be an hour okay so fear allow sin to spread if the pastor doesn't stop the false doctrine or doesn't stop it it'll spread because a little leaven leavens the whole lump so preachers should be able to stand up and give answers like that one time when we had a family leave the church and left the message I went over there and I took every question for three hours straight from a family that shot everything they had about brother Branham for three hours I just sat there and just took the questions and gave my answers gave the Bible gave the Bible now I left feeling like I won the debate by God's grace that's how I felt they might have felt different but see I'm standing there taking their hardest questions and their criticisms and stand there and hold the truth and not be afraid of that but be able to take it on and know that the Holy Spirit will give me the words to say in the hour that I need it amen now remember this one job let's go back to job the Bible said the thing that he feared came upon him and let me find that scripture real quick I didn't ever written down yeah job 3:25 there it is job 325 and I want to read you the quote from perfect faith where brother BAM talks about this remember I used the words prophetic fears prophetic kind of because it's that idea of there's life and death in the power of the tongue whatever spirit your a little Creator whatever spirit you allow and say out loud that's what's gonna happen Branham says it plainly in perfect faith let's read the scripture again job 3:25 for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come up unto me all right so there's job all right now I went back to chapter one I don't know if chapter one is an example of fear but member job said this he said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts thus did job continually I don't know if that's the fear I don't know if job said that in fear or just in love I don't know but the Bible said he feared it whatever happened to him losing his money losing his cattle you're losing his family whatever he feared it actually came upon him now here's what mother Bram said in the book of Job Brougham said it says here job feared and what he feared it actually happened what brought it brother Ram said his fear so stop right there what made that whirlwind come and it caused him to lose all of his cattle and all his family fear joel must had a fear in the back of his heart I'm gonna lose my job I'm gonna lose my money I'm gonna lose my home I'm gonna lose all my children he had that fear and mother and said it happened because of that remember remember I brought this out I just said this briefly I don't know if you remember remember when God saw it he said job's a perfect man because God always looks at our end condition God doesn't see our sin necessarily right he looks at our finished product because the Bible said whoever God is justified he's already glorified God sees us in our final condition so even though so it's quite a thought there kind of thought even though God's almas and condition in the in the in time and space allowed this to come to pass whatever Joe feared he allowed to come upon him as a test but it was his fear that brought it brother May I'm said but madam said that's what made it happen now listen this his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him his faith would have kept him from going through this but his fear brought this upon him Wow and Joe was a model he was the model example of what patience in the Bible so because he was he was weak in fear right he had the weakness of fear God allowed him to go through all these tests at the end of it God brought out a greater patience in his life by taking all the fear out of his life so what that tells us whatever weakness is in us God's gonna let it play out so it finally gets driven out of our lives right like the nation's being driven out of Canaan and then at the end we'll have a mighty testimony at the end of it just like Moses you know Moses had to get all of his fear driven out of him right and then now then when the Bible say he was the meekest man on the earth praise the Lord look at Joe look at no Moses they're different weaknesses but they all had to be driven out in order to produce the right kind of character Wow brother Ram said that his faith would have kept him from it so just Joe would have had a little more faith he went out a lost his children that way think of that church think of that right he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen brother branham said now if he'd been if he'd knowed it wouldn't have happened it wouldn't happen see what I mean Church I wonder how much has happened in our lives because we were scared of it I wonder and I wonder about other people I wonder how much they fear that's actually happened to them but I don't say the other side I wonder how much has it happened because of our faith I like to think about I wonder how much God has kept you and I from because we just believe God's Word amen glory just because believe his word and I'm not gonna be afraid I'm just gonna believe God's Word I wonder how much God has kept this from a man looking brother have said if you're afraid when you come by the prayer line maybe I just having out the faith it'll never happen he said don't worry it'll never happen but if you know it's going to happen it'll happen see it's a substance of something Jobe had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear that your disease is going to leave you it won't leave you but if you have faith it will leave you amen in that beautiful church - striking so in other words Jobe had already played that thought through oh this is what it's like this is what its gonna be like to lose all my money this sort of be it's gonna be like to lose my children and to lose my health I'm I've always been scared I'm gonna get boils you see that that's what he was thinking the whole time some of these times right I wonder I'm probably gonna get boils I'm probably gonna have this and then it actually happened there's another example Peter sank in the water because the Bible said he got afraid the very thing he feared was what happened and that powerful a simple but powerful Peters fear of sinking brought it upon him and made him sink right and motor Anderson you ask any metal medical doctor the first thing we'll try to get you to do is to have confidence in the medicine he's giving you if you haven't got no confidence in it you better leave it alone sure see what is it then it's faith that does the healing it's faith that does it all the time amen faith caused him to walk on water but then unbelief and fear caused him to sink it's faith that keeps us up on the water all the time amen I had a man one time tell me he said you said preaching that loud and preaching that much and clapping that loud he said you won't last one year bless his heart I've lasted thirteen years of preaching preaching that loud and being enthused about the Lord Jesus Christ he said you won't last one year he told me to my face I just laugh I just kind of chuckle I'd already been doing it like six or seven years see he's trying to plant fear in your life and he said your parents are gonna I'm sorry your children gonna hate you and they're not gonna love you for preaching that way and and I even walked out of church that night my children come up and give me all these hugs and tell me they love me what is that fear he's trying to get fear into my heart and say oh if you preach that hard everybody's gonna be every is gonna hate you and you won't meet you're gonna wear yourself out and none of its come to pass but what if I would accepted that box the rattlesnakes what if I took that box of rattlesnakes I might have get worn out I might have thought my children my children - are hating me but we must stand for God's Word and cast everything else aside and don't walk in fear walk in faith amen we have to walk in faith we gotta have confidence in what we're doing amen praise the Lord let me find a place to close here yeah I'm close here all right nine minutes I got all these different points I want to make this is probably I think I can bring this down right here let's close with David because if you want to know meekness you look at Moses is life if you know patience look at job's life right if you know everything look at Jesus's life but if you want to know faith conquering fear you can look at David's life so let's look at David just briefly as we close I know we've already heard this many many times but let's look at it from this angle David had to overcome fear and my last point is that fear paralyzes people remember I said that earlier fear will literally paralyze someone so they won't do anything for God's kind of like the man with the talent there's kind of another way to say that fear paralyze the army of Israel that they didn't do anything for 40 days can you imagine me on the battlefield I can't imagine this forty days and not doing anything forty days that's a month in 10 days right thirty days forty days doing nothing just paralyzed with fear I would think like once you ask yourself sometime am I even a soldier like what what am i doing I'm not I don't even fireman fought one person forty days in a battle and nothing happening and that's just what Satan wanted he just wanted an army that doesn't use their swords right but we're an army who uses the Word of God we have to use the Word of God that's just what Satan one don't quote the word for a whole month just sit back in and don't don't fight the battle for a whole month basically that's what he's saying forty days Goliath came two times a day for 40 days and paralyzed the people even paralyzed saw who was head and shoulders above everybody else now let's look at this here I just wanna look at a few so let's go to 1st Samuel 17 I just read a few scriptures here verse 11 first time in 1711 all right First Samuel 17 11 all right let's read that it says when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid I remember when I preached on this if anybody should have stepped up to the plate he should have been saw he was head and shoulders above everybody he had had a lot of victories before this remember that when we preached I don't know if him or that when I went through the whole book of 1st Samuel ppreciate evil spirits upon him he couldn't even stand up to Goliath he already had evil spirits upon him with this disobeyed Samuel and again and hated David yet of course but he had he had disobeyed Samuel numerous times and God said told Samuel I'm taking the kingdom where I'm renting the kingdom away from you so you'd already disappointed God a few times and so here he's full of fear and said I'm full of faith and let's look at this here now let's look how David overcame fear now the first thing brother branham said was that David was a prophet and God showed him the revelation that he was gonna win this fight amen hallelujah that's why we say pray for Revelation more than anything else pretties the Lord revelation so David goes into the situation already knowing I'm gonna get the victory he must have seen a vision maybe had a dream I don't know but he goes in this situation as a prophet already knowing what's gonna happen amen so the first thing get a revelation that's what my RAM says speak the word until you get a revelation he said and works his faith Express speak God's word until you know it's real until you know it's a reality the second thing is David remembered God's past faithfulness because he said remember when he went before Saul he said I've already killed a bear and a lion he remembered God's faithfulness he wasn't going to be paralyzed by fear like everyone else notice a third thing David ignored the pressure from family and government and spiritual leaders like that who are the people that sometimes discouraged us the most family members right could be government could be our spiritual leaders right cuz Saul was both a spiritual leader and he was a government official because he was the king it was a theocracy right so the very people that should have been encouraging him were discouraging him so he had to have a revelation that's how he overcame fear he had to remember God's past faithfulness if we could do that church how much stronger would we be amen to remember God did this God did that God can do it again amen we must overcome the discouragement from family members if a church leader has the wrong spear and tries to discourage us hopefully I don't have the wrong spirit god help me I never want to have the wrong spirit I never wanted to discourage you from what you're called to do praise the Lord I never want to do that but let's say a church leader would we even got to go past that we got to be able to go past that accusation and David was willing to do that he was willing to stand in front of the king stand in front of his brothers and say I'm not naughty there's a cause I'm an overcomer and I will fight that giant the fourth thing David looked at God's promise and not Goliath David's perspective was only on God David only considered the Word of God he didn't consider his enemy amen I want you to see this David only mentioned Goliath three times anybody know how many times he mentioned God six so in other words he talked about God twice as much as he talked about the devil if we would testify twice as much as we honor doubt and confusion and unbelief or we'd be more like David Amen don't you believe that we already are but listen if we have to actively do that actively make sure we tell our testimony more and more and more praise God he talked about God twice as much as he talked about Goliath so look at that verse 26 and look at let's read verse 26 for Samuel 17 26 look at the very first time he talks about Goliath and look what he says 17:26 I'm kind of turned Aaron my oh my digital Bible and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what should be done to the man that killed this Philistine this is that awesome the first thing he says about Goliath is he's gonna die basically that's the first thing he lets his mouth utter about this Philistine what's the reward gonna be for the person who kills this guy how about what's the first thing we say when someone has cancer what's the first thing we say when someone falls away from the church what's the first thing we say when we got a little and we maybe don't get the the deal he wanted right what's the first thing we say when a yeah a little trouble at work and the teacher doesn't like what you did the first thing we should say should be words of faith not words of doubt or words of discouragement like ones like I told that story when Haman heard her cheek there and the very first words out of Simon's mouth were words of faith he said oh it's not so bad and look God protected your eye Haven remember that the very first words out of our mouth we need to respond with faith let's let we have to put faith first let's give faith preeminence amen the first thing he says oh this guy's gonna die what's the reward for the person who kills this guy and members saw a member this saw didn't even keep his word Saul told everybody to get my firstborn daughter and Saul actually didn't give his firstborn daughter to david david want to know what do i get for killing this guy because god showed me he's going down yeah god showed it to me i got a revelation this man's gonna die this uncircumcised philistine he will not defy which means humiliate god will not let this man send there and humiliate the churches of the message amen glory hallelujah God will not let this sinner stand there and humiliate the bride and God's prophet God will not let him stand there what does the person get who defeats this enemy amen because I want to know what's the reward gonna be because I'm gonna be the one that's gonna take him down the very first thing he said about this well Ram said he said like a giant of cancer he said make it let's bring the life to our day what does Goliath a cancer right diabetes tuberculosis bankruptcy right a lost loved one a mother and father who doesn't serve God infertility like the woman I prayed for the job right I couldn't have a baby all these giants or all these mountains and our first words should be words of faith amen David did not consider losing because his first thing he said he talked about the death of this Philistine hallelujah that shows he didn't have any fear cause he had was faith amen his first words were on the prize like Paul said don't look on things to the pass set your sights on things in the front of you amen set your eyes on things above treasures in heaven set your press on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen like Romans 8:31 said if God is for us who can be against us David knew which army he was on AIM which side he was on he was on the Lord's side amen and the last thing that's into our feet I'll make sure my time already went off let's stand there it's already been an hour the last thing we see about David David did not procrastinate to get the fight on David didn't put it off because he wasn't afraid right so if we have a situation we don't that we have to deal with if we're afraid of it we might try to put it off and say well maybe next week I'll do this or maybe maybe it maybe next year but when you have faith you run to meet the battle the Bible said he literally ran to meet the battle right and he got five souls was his j esus and FAI Thu make sure he had faith in Jesus hallelujah and he ran to meet the Philistine and brother Ram said when you have the word of god Moni 21 Sunday he said you're like Joshua you're reckless with God's Word which means you're just ready to run through a wall God told you the answer you know what's gonna happen you got faith God is gonna God is gonna help you amen you're not gonna lose now let me close with one quote we are I just want to close with one quote because this is from as always with Moses now think about yourself think about you've been battling something I don't know here what if anyone's been battling something I don't know for those live-streaming using them badly something but this is a prayer brother branham gives at the end of as I was with Moses brother I was talking about how he needed to leave the wandering in the wood remember that from Sunday mother Graham said when he just did it a sermon night and night and night out twenty thirty times he'd say 50 or 20 times to wear himself out he said he was focusing on the signpost instead of the Commission and he said he was wandering around in the second pole by letting people just stand there and letting people pull out visions until they got weak and tired he said he needed to leave the wilderness and possess the promised land with me I know that might seem a little bit striking but that's what he says he says but Lord I'm getting tired of tramping over the same ground like I said last night 40 years in the wilderness back and forth back and forth God is blessing yes raising sheep and children whatever mourn Fox and herds and all the more God you bless them but one day you said we've been on this mountain long enough going up north towards Jordan now look I've never said God I have you started this morning I'm leaving these signposts because it's pointing towards a better land look at this brother Brandon calls his second Pole the wilderness and he said wandering around the witness around the discernment long enough he said it's time to go to the third Pole and it was just in time for the third Bowl right because he preached the church ages in 1960 going into the word the opening of the word praise God okay there we go and then two years later into the seven seals hallelujah and then two years later in that marriage and divorce opening up these great mysteries of God mother and said I've a stumble I may go through the Amalekites praise God so you may have try us how do you want to press on and go deeper with the Lord and you may have trials it's hard fear my keep you from trying to step into what God has called you into you may stumble you met Vanessa you may battle the Amalekites no I didn't preach on that on something that wasn't one of the seven but programs is naming names you understand and now here he says I may go through the hit tights I'm gonna indict through the canaanites this is exact quote I may have to pass through my own criticizing Lord I'm not going to be criticized when I started YouTube videos criticized when I started pastoring got criticized all your church is so small all your church still does have any new people criticism oh maybe yeah maybe someday you'll grow and maybe someday criticism criticism but I had to do what God put on my heart brother man had to do what God put on his heart don't just let the people pull the disturbance out move on into the third pole use that when needed but don't lean upon that too much move on to the third pole he says I may have to pass through my own criticizing Lord I'll just keep moving on and I know there's a land yonder somewhere there somewhere some conditions some place we can get to where your answered prayer he says Amen and whatever he asks will be granted talking about the spoken word third Pole not ever not even cancer will stand before the prayer I don't have to be the truth that I believe and I wait for Lord and I commit myself to thee this morning for your service in the name of Jesus Christ I'm closing with that now think in your mind are you tired of being out of position certain position your life if you are then this message is for you praise the Lord because what may be keeping someone back may be fear now let me say like this if it's somebody waiting on the hand of God and wait because remember David had to wait behind the mulberry bush until he heard a rattling remember that that was before he was even King David said Lord I'm gonna wait here until I see her head when the wind blows and here the mulberry bushes shake then I'll go out and he waited and god lemon but that's different that's not what I'm scared to go do it God coffee dude that's waiting I want to see God's hand move first then I'm going everybody see the difference I'm not telling anybody here just to run through and just just because we're scared I'm saying get rid of the fear but then also make sure you have the leadership of the Holy Spirit right you may have to go through some Hittites you may have to go through some Canaanites he said but we've got to move on out yonder to some condition somewhere however you want to get to another condition man I want to get to a new place in Christ I use all my heart I've prayed for this we could keep praying I want to go higher with us some more of God want to do more of the Lord how do we do that you must be ready to face criticism and not be afraid we must overcome the effects of fear I'm going to overcome the effects of good let's pray together and that's God to take away any effects of fear yes we can wait for the spirit to go through the mulberry bushes that's totally different I'm not talking about that I'm saying if there's fear and we're scared to do something we know we ought to do let's pray against that and let's have love in our hearts that we might be able to overcome the effects of fear the only father we love you today who Norcom we preach your word when we looked at some of these common examples but Lord hopefully it was in a new light for the saints law of God a lot of these were a new light for me Lord God and I'm thankful nor we want to be like David we want to be like Joshua we want to be like your prophet we want to recognize that we want to go or we're called to a higher plane we're called to to lure in Christ we don't want to be fearful and make others afraid we don't want to be fearful and isolated we don't want to be fearful and selfish we don't want to be fearful and destroy our own salvation we want to be overcomers full of faith hallelujah and what we want to go from faith to faith from every place the soles of our feet will tread we want to go from place to place further and further taking more land all the time dear God Lord I ask for grace Lord I ask for the help of the Holy Spirit Lord God that this church and everyone listening and everyone hearing Lord God will receive these seeds of the Word of God these seeds of faith and it will help them continue to drive out fear amen the drive out Lord I believe it is the hittite if I'm not mistaken for they're the sons of Heth to drive out the Hittites Lord to drive out fear that might keep us from doing what you want us to do with our one talent that you've given us more surely you've given every servant some tale the Bible says in Luke 5 3 5 2 or 1 surely everybody here has at least one pallet Lord to offer you because you've given it to them so Lord men your Holy Spirit help us drive out of the fear Lord or another illustration to leave where we are been wandering around we're tired of being here Lord may your spirit give us grace to move beyond Lord our spending our second condition or God and move further into the next stage of Lord the will of God for our lives North College grant that Lord Jesus I even pray for our little sugared here tonight are those that
