[0:35] preach far as a pastor that will be free
[0:38] that the water yew tree will be pure
[0:40] water not satiate of water but pure for
[0:43] the word of God and then and they fell
[0:45] for it that's my church you know you

[1:00] that long going and I was talking some
[1:02] friends died oh we're going to the we're

[1:06] they got all painted up a dress and this
[1:08] is what it felt like to be like they're

[1:16] praise they go to their feet we go to
[1:18] our cakes amen I know you the VC on the
[1:22] Word of God on an area i watch off
[1:25] actual compromise in that kind of
[1:26] atmosphere the music freaks to do start
[1:29] tap it or not even start seeing your old
[1:31] Psalms and all these things like that Oh
[1:33] be careful Megaman right that's a fatal
[1:37] forgetteth where they overwrite the
[1:39] elect will be kept out of that by the
[1:41] grace of God and bailed note if God
[1:44] wanted curse then he take them over on
[1:46] this denominational side and caused the
[1:48] anger of God and killed him anyhow then
[1:50] let God kill them himself if he could
[1:53] ever get them out of the way of truth
[1:55] see some male knew that I can't curse
[1:57] them but if I could lead them into sin
[1:59] God will kill them and that's just what
[2:02] Balon wanted but madam said as soon as
[2:05] you walk out and join a church instead
[2:07] of receiving the backs of the Holy Ghost
[2:08] you're dead not for you but on here I'm
[2:13] not that soap
[2:13] then you're on you have a name said the
[2:16] Luthor here of the Tsar's age that word
[2:18] Cyrus me is dead and when they have
[2:20] committed spiritual fortifications up
[2:22] there at Pergamos the church married
[2:24] from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a
[2:27] denomination they became dead there you
[2:29] are that's what the Bible said that's
[2:31] what God said speaking to the churches
[2:34] so just stop in a moment balans feast
[2:37] was physical form vacations and program
[2:40] brings that to the Peugeot be in church
[2:42] age and said this is spiritual
[2:44] fornication let me show you the type
[2:46] here so the Caribbean church age they
[2:49] were led by Constantine okay the days of
[2:53] Moses never led by Balin this is the
[2:55] doctrine of Balaam Constantine a big
[2:58] council called the Council of Nicaea veo
[3:01] had a big feast called the feast of lpr
[3:03] at that piece of Constantine they had
[3:07] spiritual fornications you know what it
[3:09] was big on who's big on the Trinity i'ma
[3:12] show that by history church who knows
[3:14] with the name of the the Creed of the
[3:16] trainees call the Nicene Creed the
[3:21] Athanasian Creed is a couple all these
[3:23] people that involved about em said
[3:25] that's where the church at a false
[3:26] Church committed spiritual fornication
[3:28] and took the doctrine of Balaam that's
[3:31] right but see a days of Moses with
[3:35] baiting them he had natural fornications
[3:37] but false doctrine is spiritual
[3:40] fortification that's why I'm talking
[3:41] about that the table only move that's
[3:43] why we tell you about you know the seven
[3:45] thunders and the different moves that
[3:46] are off the Word of God the perugia move
[3:49] that says God's already here we don't
[3:51] need to pass some frame r rd2 millennium
[3:53] that's called a post-millennial doctor
[3:56] but never said that's from hell he said
[3:58] he said cuz they're joining their
[4:00] millennium now he said but the
[4:01] millennium is to come they then in the
[4:04] after the day of the Lord ray Scott now
[4:09] go two numbers 23 9 if you got you by
[4:12] the way with numbers 23 9 this is the
[4:15] gold nugget but may I was talking about
[4:16] I got a quote at the end of the service
[4:19] where brother said he never knew how
[4:21] evil organizations were
[4:23] a few days ago so that was in the week
[4:26] of December the seventh of nineteen
[4:28] sixty he said I never knew why indented
[4:31] organization so much until a few days
[4:33] ago and here's the script of truth
[4:35] numbers 23 9 let's read that together
[4:38] three one two three four from the top of
[4:41] the rocks I see him and from the hills i
[4:45] behold him know the people shall dwell
[4:47] alone and shall not be reckoning among
[4:50] the nations he say praise the Lord
[4:52] praise the Lord by the way I'm use this
[4:55] quote to say this he says I'll prove to
[4:59] you its rose not at the nomination amen
[5:04] he said that in a retread rope numbers
[5:07] 2390 says does that sell it they were
[5:10] not a denomination amongst either not
[5:12] amongst the other nations oh they were
[5:15] Wanderers in pants Ali's down the street
[5:18] corner a little mission get behind the
[5:21] rest they keep them out God was one
[5:23] thing that it goes somewhere else see
[5:25] Wanderers right this is up Hebrews 11
[5:29] say that they wonder from place to place
[5:31] praise God that's how Israel was they
[5:35] were no organization they 12 alone with
[5:38] God's prophet and the pillar of fire and
[5:41] that's a weed I do we follow with god's
[5:43] holy spirit ray scott and the message
[5:46] that God sent through his property man
[5:48] that we drove off some women were
[5:51] talking to me the week before he shoots
[5:52] it or you guys getting ready to church
[5:54] they don't go past you looking ready for
[5:55] the churchmen you know all your visitors
[5:57] going to cut my studies classes I said
[5:59] we don't get too many visitors because
[6:02] we're not an organization to have
[6:04] visitors got to have a huge building
[6:07] right how to butcher oh the water too
[6:10] different it's not attractive to the
[6:12] worldly mind and most people only come
[6:16] on Easter anyway are just Christmas
[6:18] Christian for Christmas and Easter
[6:19] Christian who's there not even Christian
[6:21] they're not and so I just kind of said
[6:25] well yeah I can step up my way to sing a
[6:27] little bit but but we're just not we're
[6:29] just not a church you know where / small
[6:30] church I said we're not a big
[6:31] denominational church
[6:33] I'm not trying to hinder God look you no
[6:36] doubt that God you've got to bring
[6:38] whoever you want sir wouldn't even got
[6:39] saved but that got a lot of people I
[6:41] didn't know that it was happening god I
[6:43] can bring a lot of people but the point
[6:45] is we don't stand out there you know
[6:47] like a denomination to have huge
[6:49] buildings and advertise on the TV you
[6:52] know we don't we don't have money like
[6:54] that we don't have it programs like that
[6:56] every other man who said stay humble you
[6:58] said don't don't rely on money don't get
[7:00] like that don't get a spot where you
[7:03] don't rely upon money for the ministry
[7:06] into the spot where you rely upon the
[7:07] holy ghost hey cauvery rely upon the
[7:11] move of the Holy Ghost of the church
[7:12] that's what we must rely upon that's why
[7:16] I'm rely upon this morning amen got to
[7:18] move in your hearts this morning so what
[7:22] proved did it this proved it right here
[7:24] numbers 23 9 they were all alone
[7:27] sometimes I feel sad when I'm alone when
[7:29] I read this I'm encouraged by loris that
[7:31] we're loving I'm encouraged because
[7:34] that's how it is really well she wasn't
[7:35] a ver out they were hate around the
[7:37] Moabites it tides they were trying to
[7:39] drive out those unbelieving hey hey they
[7:43] were trying to start a new revival
[7:44] amongst their move and the train up
[7:47] there showed remember if you driving six
[7:49] he said teacher children diligently the
[7:51] Word of God that things might go well
[7:54] with you in the land we're trying to
[7:56] establish churches within our families
[7:57] we're trying to Bruce riddle disciples
[7:59] of christ and believers hungry trying to
[8:02] get my god eater that was the command of
[8:04] God now don't get me wrong God can send
[8:06] an unbeliever some things like that but
[8:08] our strategy is not the same as the
[8:10] world the world's like bigger build a
[8:11] big church puts on it's all over the
[8:13] yard bring some people into Christ and
[8:15] those same he wiggly spiders that became
[8:18] in the neck they crawl out about two
[8:20] weeks later right I nose wiggle tails
[8:23] and all those snakes that they get them
[8:24] caught the net they eventually crawl
[8:26] right back out to the world how many see
[8:28] no I seen it so many times nine the
[8:30] comment under a special meeting and walk
[8:32] out and then deny the Word of God the
[8:36] very God they said it saved them they
[8:37] deny the word that's not the nine let's
[8:39] swallow with the Holy Spirit and let's
[8:41] let God after
[8:43] the church such as she said after the
[8:46] book of Acts head the box in the book of
[8:48] Acts God added to the church as many as
[8:51] four piece a day been that's a we'd have
[8:54] to wait for just wait for God will add
[8:56] to the church as many saints that are an
[8:58] acronym at all the free destined all the
[9:01] forward end of God will be at this
[9:03] church in acronym God's called them amen
[9:05] that's right so if you don't feel bad to
[9:09] be all alone sometimes church that's how
[9:11] easier once we're going to have
[9:14] fellowship with anybody universe you
[9:15] with the Baptist they're drinking their
[9:18] social drink or you know you remember
[9:21] her genetic also Christian missionary
[9:23] alliance I get FLC with em on a Saturday
[9:26] night let's go bowling let's go listen
[9:28] to like an old time rock and roll that
[9:30] kind of used it just pervert your soul
[9:33] nope is it up with the New York City
[9:36] they love that old time rock and roll it
[9:38] just perverts their soul what is it is
[9:41] trying to be a feast is trying to be
[9:42] like the doctor the family feast of a of
[9:44] your oh you don't fellowship enough with
[9:46] us or you don't hang out Noah sinners
[9:48] but you gotta be led by god to do that
[9:51] you gotta stay clean you got to heat
[9:53] your garments why they been remember
[9:56] Jesus told them jesus said I will only
[9:59] forgive you if you keep your garments
[10:01] white he said those who are worthy of me
[10:04] walk in white that's right I remember
[10:07] god forbid you to eat lunch with a
[10:09] fornicator god forbid you to look for
[10:12] something that won't work he said don't
[10:14] even eat with people that will work that
[10:16] they'll be a shame them stuff so the
[10:18] very fact you don't go to their movie
[10:19] theaters and their bowling parties and
[10:21] their birthday parties and their our
[10:23] anniversaries of all these things and
[10:24] all these things they do is or many
[10:26] things behind it the reason you don't go
[10:28] it shows a rebuke on them for their life
[10:30] of sin but where did you lower the Holy
[10:32] Spirit and the pillar of fire as lights
[10:35] in a dying art world amen see that they
[10:38] star has a written in your heart how
[10:40] many hearts as a resident the day Sarge
[10:42] to the rise we're children of the day
[10:44] not children on the dark as we said last
[10:47] Sunday amen make sure the children of
[10:50] life is headed on the pillar fire move
[10:52] over them uh oh yeah leading
[10:55] night and I filed by day oh I love you
[10:58] never God said this you don't come out
[11:01] from among them he said you come out
[11:02] from among them that I will dwell in you
[11:04] see God can tell people because they
[11:07] don't get saved and finds them they
[11:09] don't come out of the things of the
[11:11] world on their fellowship with their
[11:13] families and friends and comrades and
[11:15] all these things like that he said you
[11:18] come out I walk in you he said I'll be
[11:20] your God you'll be my people come out
[11:24] from among them be separate saith the
[11:25] Lord touch not the unclean thing and
[11:27] I'll receive you and I will be a father
[11:30] unto you ye shall be my sons and
[11:32] daughters saith the Lord Almighty ah how
[11:37] many grateful to be alone by following
[11:38] the Holy Spirit man on a new yo bro
[11:41] deficit I never do this let me show that
[11:42] close you said never knew it till till a
[11:47] few days ago now how many loves him with
[11:50] all your heart how many believes in with
[11:51] all your heart hope now do you think
[11:53] that I would stand here just because
[11:55] that we're not organizations that we're
[11:57] an organization would say those things
[11:59] you understand my brother why all my
[12:02] life I fought against that thing he
[12:05] start against denominations and creeds
[12:07] and organizations he said see it was the
[12:11] Holy Spirit that did that I couldn't
[12:16] understand it myself I did know it took
[12:19] just a few days ago see I did know what
[12:21] made me do that I didn't know why I
[12:23] always try to get some women living
[12:25] wrong and things I didn't know it what I
[12:28] do now because one of the doctor de
[12:31] balón do it produce an organization
[12:34] right it reduced people outside the word
[12:36] with false doctrines that led people to
[12:39] symbolize rather than a life of holiness
[12:41] but we're supposed to a perfect holiness
[12:43] in the fear of God Satan my said hey man
[12:47] he said they didn't know this took not
[12:49] showed me in the word that Israel is
[12:52] although they were just a fellowship all
[12:55] along Church in many ways the very
[12:59] people you see in here is all you got
[13:01] your fellowship you might say men men
[13:04] men
[13:05] how long can you fellowship with your
[13:07] denomination friends I can go about the
[13:09] and go little aha let's start feeling
[13:12] the file because they break out their
[13:14] short they break out their hula hoops
[13:16] they break out your paint they break out
[13:17] their dirty movies how how can we walk
[13:20] together except we be agreed so some of
[13:25] the most dear people to fellowship with
[13:26] all right here in this room hey ahead
[13:29] glad I'm still waiting for your
[13:31] invitations I can what were you how
[13:32] about it remember you're a sec
[13:36] necessarily dear speaker you ever want
[13:39] to meet that are all alone there caught
[13:42] out from the world all alone with the
[13:45] saints of God that's exactly right
[13:47] church let me thank God is calling us up
[13:50] now let's go a few more here little bit
[13:53] further am i doing on time ok see if you
[13:57] don't follow the truth is you think
[13:59] Nicolaitans that because God is doing
[14:01] for you do what you're doing like that
[14:03] there's original truth you're only
[14:06] taking God's permissive will see
[14:08] denominations are in the permissive will
[14:10] of God so limit the Holy Spirit say
[14:13] dodging on you this this is all God
[14:15] showed us and that's it he said you said
[14:18] well God give us the Holy Spirit he
[14:20] blesses us and we're baptized the name
[14:22] of our Holy Ghost you fail in mind see
[14:25] dr. Nabila look at that doesn't bring
[14:26] the power strainer but this is a prophet
[14:28] he's a modern-day Moses right brother
[14:32] Raiders of modern-day Moses comparing
[14:34] just a few baptisms nutty nothing else
[14:36] not smoking not cross dressing you'll
[14:39] not wear makeup um no the no other
[14:42] doctrines just that dr. of baptism and
[14:45] he said you'll take us and all that goes
[14:46] he said you bailin right all right
[14:50] that's up the church and I striking to
[14:51] see that see because that is a
[14:53] denominational thought don't get me
[14:56] wrong we love all of our friends what
[14:59] might be love everybody but we've got to
[15:02] stand with the truth praise God and we
[15:05] cannot be the sieve into All Star Trek
[15:07] we got to stay with the word of God so
[15:10] we gotta love at the same time yet
[15:12] denied their ungodliness praise God he
[15:17] said God did
[15:18] after he was so arrogant he just let him
[15:20] go on hung his own stuff that was bad
[15:22] enough ribbit basically got killed by
[15:24] Israel's army but man she just hung
[15:26] himself basically you got to get back to
[15:28] the truth foundational truth back to the
[15:30] Bible oh well he's blessed us he said I
[15:34] I know that he told Bailey to he said
[15:36] you go ahead if you want to you're bound
[15:38] to go that way and you want the
[15:39] organization route take it go Allah
[15:42] everybody see that by God's grace the
[15:45] doctrine of Balaam is a false unity that
[15:48] partially as a partial truth to it but
[15:51] not all the truth and it leads people
[15:55] into sin in this case and with sexual
[15:57] sin programs of and only has to lead you
[15:59] into spiritual fornication which is
[16:01] called doctrine amen dr. nicolaides I
[16:06] think I just have a few slides on this
[16:07] year no I got okay five seven or eight
[16:13] help me Jesus help me Lord Jesus are you
[16:17] joining us by God's grace and amen
[16:19] people say brother Ram you know we're
[16:21] not preaching both for a more rigid
[16:22] exactly what he said exactly what he
[16:25] said right back to the same scriptures
[16:26] and everything like that by God's grace
[16:28] all right now here's perhaps talk about
[16:32] the great guys seen council 325 I'm
[16:36] going to skip down here but but yet
[16:38] through the Nicolaitans the goal for
[16:40] most Constantine's political plan they
[16:43] outvoted the true church among the
[16:45] victory and issued it bishops and Holy
[16:47] Order men taking the holy spirit from
[16:50] the meeting and placing upon bishops
[16:51] Cardinals hopes and so forth okay so the
[16:57] council of nicea did some awful things
[16:59] now I read the Britannica this morning
[17:02] on the council of nicea and also did was
[17:03] praised it just pays Constantine crazy
[17:07] like you to some some great man well
[17:11] what is is a narrow down
[17:16] about trinity i was a conference that
[17:22] horse everybody should believe their way
[17:25] about the truth all right that's where
[17:29] my brother would condemn the council of
[17:32] nicea is so hard in 325 AD because it
[17:34] was trying to get all those who didn't
[17:36] believe the training the way we believe
[17:37] it get them out of church that's exactly
[17:40] what they did letraset did you notice in
[17:43] the catholic church today you can't read
[17:44] that by let's not for you to interpret
[17:46] that's the bishop see where it come from
[17:48] that he can see what they think Elena's
[17:50] really was a fart begin this we can
[17:52] crawl so by Madison look at a calyx
[17:54] today and you member for the Austin's
[17:57] bout as a Catholic right she was raised
[17:59] and they told her never read the Bible
[18:00] and so she hated go to church she uh she
[18:04] said I never understood anything they
[18:06] said it was all Latin he said memory
[18:07] used to always be glad their masses so
[18:09] nobody even understood what was saying
[18:11] it was total confusion babble and now
[18:15] recent within the last few years now
[18:17] they've allowed him to do it in English
[18:19] but it used to be just a lad so you
[18:21] didn't understand any Jews have with
[18:23] bloody fate just to believe what they're
[18:24] saying was right there's nothing just
[18:27] accepted okay and I'm shifting our
[18:29] friend stephanie was not a sister yet
[18:30] but hopefully she will be but she said
[18:32] that's how was my dad was raised in a
[18:34] Catholic school in Chicago church they
[18:35] never told read his body and so see the
[18:38] spirit now that says never read your
[18:40] Bible was the same spirit that comes
[18:41] with nice deal it has just advanced let
[18:45] me tell you Constantine then they read
[18:46] their Bibles but they were denying the
[18:49] parts of the Bible but now is the spot
[18:51] where they keep the Bible from the
[18:52] people to arrange your but if they read
[18:56] the Bible they pointed to the Apocrypha
[18:57] instead of the work of that right Jason
[18:59] right because the Apocrypha has those
[19:02] things like raise the dead in it all
[19:03] these kinds of false doctrines and Jesus
[19:05] turned a little clay birds and the birds
[19:07] and all kinds of different doctors like
[19:09] that and I've seen it it's not right so
[19:12] this we're seeing the advanced version
[19:14] of the doctor the Nicolaitans today now
[19:19] this is getting back to mail and that
[19:22] council and Constantine used the same
[19:25] strategy that failed did that a meeting
[19:27] after this counts up there the bishop
[19:29] put over the churches and somewhere to
[19:30] rule it and take all the power from the
[19:32] land team and they had no thinking of
[19:35] themselves neither did they have any
[19:36] rights to talk with the scripture and
[19:38] that it was all to the priests twisted
[19:40] interpretation of the scriptures finally
[19:44] after a while they make a master priest
[19:45] a vicar which was the Pope but now they
[19:50] come to the spot where they put it all
[19:51] the understanding belongs to the priest
[19:53] and the congregation's don't have to
[19:54] read the Bible they don't do nothing
[19:56] frankly the Bible's kept from them and
[19:58] now they've taken it all over upon
[20:00] themselves and was voted into us because
[20:03] it looked good and then brother Graham
[20:05] preaches a few paragraphs on it looked
[20:07] good to the Romans because now this
[20:10] Catholic Church wasn't called accountant
[20:12] or jevon they had riches big buildings
[20:15] wrote choir robes and fanciness how got
[20:18] two things so the Christians that
[20:21] weren't true Christians easily swelled
[20:23] up because of what money big buildings
[20:26] the outside appearance instead of what
[20:29] was in the heart praise God that should
[20:32] be the difference with our church it's
[20:34] not about the outward appearance it's
[20:35] about the heart amen it's about what is
[20:38] the truth what is what the real word of
[20:41] God say but see this will cause people
[20:43] to fall away bigger churches more money
[20:46] big rose big wires all worship is much
[20:49] better than all these things like this
[20:50] instead of the incense of the Holy
[20:52] Spirit are sensitive to the flesh and
[20:54] the Bible said to be sensual not having
[20:57] the Holy Spirit of a book of Jude when
[21:01] we make decisions by our flesh that's
[21:02] not the Holy Spirit you must make
[21:04] decisions by the Holy Spirit it always
[21:07] point you to the Word of God now almost
[21:10] of the history just bear with me just a
[21:11] minute one more quote don't get the
[21:13] history that will try to get to those
[21:14] rewards I got about 20 minutes so I
[21:17] God's grace now the work heard of most
[21:20] means Mary the very word peugeot speeds
[21:23] Mary Christianity that is that a nickel
[21:25] laid inside the formal side married to
[21:28] the state will go through the history of
[21:31] Copsey just briefly like I said I don't
[21:32] have time to read all of his instrument
[21:34] read over so Constantine married the
[21:37] state the government to the church and
[21:40] that is all true from history
[21:42] that's fully true with pagan ceremonies
[21:45] pagan ceremonies and it was the birth of
[21:47] the Catholic Church in that day see I
[21:52] didn't almost birthday kind of church
[21:53] because it's damaged of the Trinity they
[21:56] still attorney docket is so sprinkling
[21:58] you saw all these false doctrines and
[21:59] you can go read the council and I see
[22:02] the history that's what it was all about
[22:03] not in three persons kicking out
[22:07] anybody's going to agree with attorney
[22:08] doctrine we're kicking you out to see
[22:10] exactly how we see it or you're not a
[22:12] part of the church that's exactly what
[22:13] happened now anyone knows the Catholic
[22:17] Church has brought assistance at the
[22:18] Nicene Council here's a history this is
[22:20] the first paragraph on Constantine on
[22:22] the Britannica that's my go-to it's my
[22:25] go-to resource now jeez it's so easy
[22:26] it's right on line I could just do a
[22:27] word search it's real easy Constantine
[22:31] he says ah it says the first Roman
[22:35] Emperor to profess Christianity that
[22:37] doesn't mean he was a Christian he
[22:39] professed it he not only initiated the
[22:43] evolution of the empire into a Christian
[22:45] state but also provided the impulse for
[22:49] a distinctly Christian culture that
[22:50] prepared the way for the growth of the
[22:52] eyes inclined in western medieval
[22:54] culture now let's see this year look at
[23:00] this history says Constantine's that
[23:02] here it's the Christianity now remember
[23:04] was the false Christianity was closely
[23:06] associated with his rise of problem in
[23:09] other words he wintered did not rise the
[23:10] power except through Christmas
[23:12] Christianity his association with false
[23:15] Christianity he fought the Battle of
[23:18] Milvian bridge in the name of the
[23:21] Christian God having received
[23:22] instructions in a dream to paint the
[23:24] Christian monogram on his troops shields
[23:26] this is the account given by the
[23:27] Christian apologists lack 10 TS think
[23:31] i'm staying on the right a somewhat
[23:33] different version offered by use of us
[23:36] tells of a vision seen by constantine
[23:38] during the campaign against Maxentius in
[23:42] which the christian side appeared the
[23:43] scatter the legend in this side conquer
[23:46] howdy her down before and if you would
[23:47] admit of our demo so there's three
[23:49] different versions of how Constantine
[23:51] actually be supposedly became a
[23:54] Christian
[23:55] the first one he saw a dream the second
[23:58] one he saw a vision of a cross and the
[24:01] third one is says he didn't even see a
[24:03] Christian God it was the vision of a
[24:05] Palo off Scott see there's three
[24:09] versions of his conversion that's not a
[24:12] good sign two of them saying was he saw
[24:15] Christian cross a third one saw said he
[24:18] saw a vision of Apollo this Greek god at
[24:23] a shrine in Gaul so it's possible to put
[24:29] that up it's possible the very mission
[24:31] they say he had wasn't even Christ it
[24:34] was a false spirit it was a demon spirit
[24:36] disguises Apollo who showed him a cross
[24:38] and he said partner in this side
[24:40] wouldn't that make sense if that was
[24:42] what really happened would that make
[24:44] sense how I showed you history few years
[24:46] ago remember so we don't members maybe
[24:48] sister bowood many might remember i
[24:51] showed you in history from Constantine
[24:53] Constantine just foot crosses on the
[24:56] pagan temples he just put a cross up
[24:59] there but it was still pagan temple and
[25:00] had the same pagan rituals in it the
[25:02] same pagan statues he just went across
[25:04] it in front of it and that's as bad as
[25:07] putting up a message book here at the
[25:09] pulpit say we're a message church but we
[25:11] don't receive the spirit of the message
[25:13] praise God we gotta have the sphere of
[25:15] the message amen which is the holy
[25:17] spirit see this so there's three
[25:20] accounts on his conversion no court my
[25:26] brother Graham said this one makes the
[25:27] most sense I program did say they
[25:29] painted on crosses on their shields but
[25:32] I did say that so the kind of overlaps a
[25:34] little bit now here's here's the
[25:37] constant I see a Constantine second
[25:40] involvement and Italy's acid issue
[25:41] father defeat of the Sidious but the
[25:44] controversy over aranea ism with its
[25:48] intricate expirations of the precise
[25:50] nature of the Trinity that were
[25:52] concerned if Republican Greek was as
[25:55] remote from Constantine's educational
[25:56] background as was from his impatient
[25:58] urgent temperamental look at this is how
[26:01] you to describe st. Paul impatient this
[26:05] is how you described by the RAM
[26:07] impatient and temperamental
[26:09] he was a tyrant church he's a tyrant he
[26:13] was a techie wasn't it wasn't elected he
[26:15] was a tired he later killed his son will
[26:18] show the next one to see the Council of
[26:20] Nicaea it was a battle over his chew it
[26:26] I'm sorry his Christian priests and this
[26:29] group called Arianism which to summarize
[26:32] it they believe God created Jesus and
[26:38] he's like no God was a the Sun is the
[26:41] Sun is God too he's uncreated see member
[26:44] that number that doctrine of the Trinity
[26:45] God the Father uncreated God the Son
[26:49] uncreated holy spear uncrated his false
[26:53] doctrine I see this now I'm not saying
[26:56] Iranian as it was all right too but how
[26:59] many know Jesus body was conceded the
[27:01] Holy Ghost was the spirit of Jesus
[27:05] created no was the body of Jesus created
[27:08] you better believe it you see but to
[27:12] take to take old si there to cut out
[27:14] anything that disagreed with their
[27:15] Trinity and you disagree with their
[27:17] Creed may cut it out and wrote answer
[27:20] this is the doctrine of the Nicolaitans
[27:22] that's right see so there's truth in
[27:26] this I'm not saying it was all true cuz
[27:28] when I study in the past I don't
[27:29] remember being all true but it's true
[27:31] God had to be critical body of Jesus but
[27:34] the sphere that was in Jesus was God
[27:36] himself in the head that's right here's
[27:40] where he murdered at the end of his life
[27:42] so he can't say this guy was even
[27:44] converted because the Bible said no
[27:45] murder has what eternal life Wellington
[27:49] him haha ah mid aan de proves it no
[27:53] murderer has eternal life going in there
[27:58] he's God I'm going to do that's the word
[28:00] of God so see this is at the end of his
[28:03] life here the history says he visit West
[28:10] the west part of his empire in 326 to
[28:13] repeat the celebrations at Rome the
[28:16] anniversary of him being the ruler from
[28:18] the greatest political crisis of the
[28:21] rain during his absence from
[28:22] ease and meriva that remain obscure so
[28:24] you don't even know why did this
[28:25] Constantine had his eldest son Crispus
[28:28] slain look at that and his own wife my
[28:34] goodness foster Christmas stepmother
[28:35] slain he killed two people now if you
[28:39] read the history he was just great
[28:40] Christian man and brother branham brings
[28:43] it the other way he said IVs I can't
[28:44] find lunch tray that even says he was a
[28:46] believer the other hide the truth from
[28:49] the textbook see me there only telling
[28:54] the history through their eyes I'm glad
[28:56] God tells history through these eyes
[28:58] right here and Jesus told us the history
[29:01] of the church by those seven letters the
[29:04] seven Gentile churches hey man I believe
[29:07] you praise god for telling us what would
[29:10] happen the Peugeot most age where church
[29:12] and state would unite and they would
[29:15] start killing everyone that disagrees
[29:17] them exactly right you don't know Lord
[29:21] today never around Warren of the Holy
[29:25] Ghost to teach the people these things
[29:30] what are we saying church let me say
[29:33] this again just to remind you you and I
[29:36] he kept denominator as anything else as
[29:39] soon as you know at the Holy Ghost move
[29:42] in your life you start going towards
[29:44] that as soon as you stop trying to go
[29:48] closer to Christ you start getting a
[29:51] denominational spirit we nobody can
[29:53] teach me anything anymore I don't need
[29:56] to press into the things of God I don't
[29:59] need to search deeper for more of God
[30:00] I'm just comfortable where I am that's
[30:02] very very close to denominational spirit
[30:05] because now you organized in your own
[30:07] life and in your own heart mind you've
[30:09] already brought your own crees well this
[30:12] is where you stop you get to 36 Nick and
[30:14] stuff I'm 36 i'm using myself as their
[30:18] bed once you get to 36 then you can stop
[30:20] you off the bass afraid of the trap but
[30:22] pressing up to listen to tapes anymore
[30:24] over study the word anymore like after
[30:27] but jesus said if you want to hear from
[30:29] me jesus said is going to hear for me
[30:32] see me jesus said if you want to hear
[30:35] from me not
[30:36] come on to me the chipset and the Holy
[30:40] Ghost will guide you up there's a more
[30:43] truth you see some people might take the
[30:46] services over a Jessica no doctor to
[30:48] faylene doctor to think elated that's so
[30:50] far off weird work where the bride are
[30:52] you if you're the bride that we love the
[30:55] things of God amen then we remaining the
[30:58] truth and we keep the Word of God we
[31:02] keep hungry for more of God's look a
[31:04] supposed to convert a person by history
[31:06] turns into a murderer murders is a wife
[31:10] and a step such as old as time murders
[31:14] it I'm sorry stepmother his eldest son
[31:18] and then his stepmother money is this
[31:23] awful church and this is what history
[31:26] says is a real example of christina
[31:28] novelli girl he did some nice things he
[31:32] took away all the persecution for most
[31:34] Christians he said I cannot persecute
[31:36] Christians he does nice things there but
[31:39] when it come down to it this is what is
[31:41] nice what is the last things record on
[31:44] history by his life he kill other people
[31:46] yeah and one of the Antichrist spirited
[31:50] man to it from white to black I'm sorry

[32:59] overcometh shall inherit all things hey
[33:02] Laurie so what's the hidden manna
[33:06] brother Hammerson let's give the
[33:07] interpretation what is hidden manna
[33:09] tight it was a type that a man that was
[33:11] kept in the holy place the show Greg is
[33:16] the Bible that was only for the priests
[33:17] how he knows that they had bread /
[33:20] congregation there's a special bread for
[33:22] the priests is that right so what was
[33:25] the reward they got special bread that
[33:28] nobody else got to eat I did it I got
[33:31] this remind me at first angle so the
[33:33] free save him gave David hallowed bread
[33:37] for there was no bread there but the
[33:40] showbread that was taken prep before the
[33:43] Lord to put hot bread in the day when it
[33:47] was taken away amen so see David was
[33:51] even a priest but God allowed him to eat
[33:54] the shewbread coming member that but the
[33:56] Bible said you and I are kings and
[33:59] priests unto God hey so got a lot of
[34:02] David to take partake of that that
[34:04] hidden manna hidden read and the Bible
[34:07] said you and I are already kings of
[34:10] Greece and we get to eat the special
[34:12] bread of God how many thankful for the
[34:14] fresh bread of God today ahead

[34:38] bread of God that's right larissa gotta
[34:42] stretch of red in a Nevada and what is
[34:45] our mana it's christ jesus said I am the
[34:48] bread of life that come down from heaven

[38:16] people even but you understand I'm not
[38:18] advocating be alone all the time but
[38:21] when it comes down to it there's going
[38:22] to be less and less sake I mean no
[38:24] that's the sort of death less and less
[38:26] not more and more people safe the Bible
[38:29] said Jesus has the short at a time that
[38:31] someone like would be sent all the elect
[38:34] will be saved now what is white white
[38:40] Ruff representing a bands to this angel
[38:42] of a white stone what is the ride he
[38:44] said purity later the next night he says
[38:47] it in the factory she said it means
[38:49] God's own righteousness so you're giving
[38:52] hidden man up and you're given a white
[38:55] stone and the stone represents a
[38:57] revelation we know that my soap is upon
[39:00] this rock I will build my church so you
[39:04] have a revelation of God's righteousness
[39:06] and a new name so let me just say like
[39:11] this you were supposed to receive a
[39:12] revelation by be the message a
[39:15] revelation that you have a new name
[39:18] what's our new name mrs. Lord Jesus
[39:21] Christ what are you then a nude in a
[39:26] church we're supposed to receive a new
[39:28] day know that goes beyond that you
[39:30] remember you must know you're the bride
[39:31] of Christ but it goes beyond that the
[39:33] great up said he knows who he is but he
[39:37] can't tell others because if the name
[39:40] which he himself knows but nobody else
[39:43] knows see no one knows but himself jesus
[39:49] said Peter know knew he had the keys of
[39:52] the kingdom but you didn't hear him
[39:54] bragging about it raised up he said
[40:00] these guys have brag and say well I've
[40:01] got a new name he said I noticed how
[40:04] many know that we have a rapture mr.
[40:05] Peter had the keys to the kingdom we got
[40:08] the revelation for the rapture but we
[40:12] don't go around bragging on why because
[40:17] we've got a special white stone and our
[40:22] names in there and nobody knows it
[40:24] except does no ma'am not let me explain
[40:28] a lot more by Madison the reason jesus
[40:35] said a white stone is because in the
[40:36] Peruvian age that's when they start
[40:39] building a white rock altered for their
[40:41] posts history can show you that to look
[40:45] at their artwork they still have up now
[40:46] okay you can see if there's granite and
[40:48] marble everywhere white beautiful rocks
[40:50] that's when it started was in the
[40:52] program age so jesus said don't look at
[40:54] those white marble stones I'm giving you
[40:56] a white spiritual stuff hey then I'm
[41:01] going to give you a revelation of your
[41:02] name and nobody else knows your name
[41:04] with you the man said but this angel or
[41:09] know who he was a son of God through the
[41:13] revelation of Jesus Christ are you
[41:17] starting to see this now the white stone
[41:20] is your personal revelation for the Jose
[41:21] of moody Walker let me say this my
[41:25] revelation
[41:26] is who i am i have a preacher of the
[41:29] true gospel of jesus christ i had filled
[41:32] with the Holy Ghost I am a continuation
[41:34] of the book of Acts but I don't go
[41:36] around bragging it's a revelation to me
[41:40] and I just keep it a secret it's
[41:43] something gods revealed to me you can't
[41:46] have the same stone as me right you
[41:48] can't I can't make yourself you can't
[41:50] take my son we all got our position in
[41:52] crisis you understand that that's what
