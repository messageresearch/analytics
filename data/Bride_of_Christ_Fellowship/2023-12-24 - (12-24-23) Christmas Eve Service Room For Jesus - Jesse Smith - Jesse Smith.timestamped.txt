[16:07] and take our Bibles let's go
[16:08] to Romans here uh 6 verse 22 I'd like to
[16:13] preach my Christmas message U as part of
[16:16] my book of Romans series I just saw kind
[16:19] of like a a nice connection here so I
[16:21] like to go to Romans
[16:23] 6:22 we'll read Romans 7:4 so P Romans 6
[16:27] vers
[16:33] so I'm going to just start preaching on
[16:34] Romans to kind of tie this in and then
[16:37] at the end I'll just preach on this
[16:39] little thought room for Jesus that's my
[16:41] Christmas thought is room for
[16:43] Jesus so we're thankful we can have make
[16:46] room for Jesus praise the Lord let me
[16:49] see if there's any other prayer requests
[16:50] here okay that looks good all
[16:54] right Romans
[16:57] 6:22
[17:01] let's read that if we can and then we'll
[17:02] read Romans 74 after this here by God's
[17:05] grace thank you let's read that on three
[17:08] 1 two three but now being made free from
[17:12] sin and become servants to God your H
[17:18] and the end everlas life just for a
[17:21] moment the main thought I want to pull
[17:23] out of here is the fruit and that's what
[17:25] brother random emphasizes when he
[17:27] preaches uh the invisible Union of the
[17:29] Bride of Jesus Christ he preaches
[17:31] Christians should have fruit to their
[17:33] Union with Christ uh so verse 4 of
[17:37] chapter 7 let's read that one 1 2 3
[17:41] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[17:44] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[17:48] that he should be married to another
[17:51] even to him who is raised from the dead
[17:54] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[17:57] God God as blessing to reading his word
[17:59] you may be
[18:01] seated we only have one service today so
[18:03] I'm really not going to keep track of
[18:05] time I'm not even to set my timer today
[18:06] I'm just going to just try to preach as
[18:08] long as I or as long as the Holy Spirit
[18:09] wants me to by God's grace so um and
[18:12] then at the end you after we sing and if
[18:14] there's any prayers you know we can pray
[18:15] and then we'll invite the children up
[18:17] and uh you know just talk to them a
[18:20] little bit about little gifts you know
[18:22] um I told my older ones I told Haven you
[18:25] know um let's let's make sure we give
[18:28] The Junction City children these gifts
[18:30] first okay we'll get now whatever ones
[18:32] we got we'll give them to the youngest
[18:34] first come first
[18:35] serve and believe me I'll make it up to
[18:37] you older ones by God's grace God will
[18:39] help me I'll make it up to
[18:41] you because we want to we want our guest
[18:43] to feel the love of God and they
[18:46] sacrificed so much to be here we want
[18:47] these little children to feel of God's
[18:49] love Hallelujah so we want to look at um
[18:52] I I have some uh slides here got a few
[18:54] slides ready I want to look at this
[18:56] thought of uh Book of Romans this idea
[18:59] brother Ram brings it out bringing forth
[19:01] fruit unto God and so uh brother Ram
[19:04] brings it out as a marriage he uh I'm
[19:07] sorry St Paul brings it out as a
[19:08] marriage and then brother Ram takes that
[19:10] thought and brings it down to our day so
[19:13] we want to look at Book of Romans is
[19:14] part 14 in our Romans series also at the
[19:17] end I'll look at just a simple thought
[19:18] room for Jesus and so again Merry
[19:21] Christmas to everyone and God bless your
[19:23] holiday season I hope you get to see
[19:24] your family and loved ones by God's Gra
[19:28] I've been on vacation for a few days I'm
[19:30] enjoying this and I hope you're enjoying
[19:32] some vacation time as well by God's
[19:34] grace so we read our text here and I
[19:36] found this or one of my children shared
[19:38] this with me I thought it was just a
[19:40] funny way to kind of maybe start out not
[19:42] just a funny but true this is a true
[19:44] thing we've been preaching on the book
[19:46] of Romans and and this is how it is with
[19:48] me almost every verse I can highlight
[19:50] and say wow that's powerful that's
[19:52] powerful I hope you can say amen after
[19:54] the first uh 13 parts of this series I
[19:57] hope you can say Amen to this
[20:00] because that is the absolute truth you
[20:01] can just go over so many truths in the
[20:05] Book of Romans who was it oh as my
[20:07] barber was telling me a couple weeks ago
[20:09] he said uh said you know I was thinking
[20:10] about you this morning and uh he said uh
[20:13] I was reading through Romans and I I
[20:15] just kept coming back you know all these
[20:17] things I've heard from you I just kept
[20:19] kept coming back to the Book of Romans
[20:21] there's something about the book of
[20:22] Romans and uh it's a true of course
[20:26] because God's Prophet messenger St Paul
[20:28] he brought so much Unity to Christian
[20:30] Jews and Christian Gentiles in this book
[20:33] he answers all the questions uh and it
[20:36] goes from how we're all guilty before
[20:38] God but then God can bring Jew and
[20:40] Gentile together in the Holy Ghost
[20:42] praise God Amen so it doesn't matter
[20:44] your nationality doesn't matter your age
[20:46] your gender there's only two genders
[20:49] doesn't matter anything like that we are
[20:51] all one in Christ Jesus
[20:53] Hallelujah you have the Holy Spirit and
[20:55] I have the Holy Spirit we are the family
[20:57] of God hallelujah amen and if we both
[20:59] obey the Holy Spirit we'll have Unity of
[21:01] the spirit God that's what we enjoy
[21:04] today praise God but I just thought you
[21:06] like that that made me laugh because
[21:07] that's exactly what my Bible looks like
[21:09] I just switched out my Bible so I got my
[21:10] new one up here so it doesn't quite look
[21:12] the same this is my newer one I took my
[21:14] old one home I'm transfering all my my
[21:17] note my special notes and highlights out
[21:18] of that one I'm putting in my new
[21:20] one so I like to do that that's been 14
[21:23] years since I had that Bible so I like
[21:24] to transfer them over now remember uh
[21:27] scopio Ram likes a lot of Scofield's
[21:29] teachings but scoffield broke this book
[21:31] up into eight or seven Parts we're on
[21:34] part three we're looking in chapter 5
[21:36] through 8 on crucifixion with Christ and
[21:38] the Believers walk in the Holy Spirit
[21:41] praise God so we're looking at that
[21:42] today we're looking at the walk in the
[21:44] Holy Spirit this section of uh Paul's
[21:47] letter to the Romans remember I'm just
[21:49] going to read a couple of these I'm not
[21:50] going to read all of them but brother R
[21:51] said every time I got feeling a little
[21:53] depressed I turn to the Book of Romans
[21:54] chapter 4 so if you ever get depressed
[21:56] May the Holy Spirit remind you read
[21:59] Romans 4 praise God the Bible says that
[22:02] Abraham hoped against uh I'm sorry he
[22:05] believed uh he hoped yeah he believed in
[22:08] Hope praise God the Bible said he was
[22:09] not weak in faith so when we feel weak
[22:11] in faith remember God doesn't see you as
[22:13] weak in faith amen God knows you're
[22:15] going to get weak God knows you're going
[22:17] to struggle God's going to come to you
[22:19] and he's going to strengthen you if you
[22:21] did that with Abraham he's going to do
[22:22] it with you because you're Abraham's
[22:24] spiritual children am hallelujah thank
[22:27] you Jesus and Abraham didn't consider
[22:29] his body dead because he looked at the
[22:30] promise of God the promise said I'm
[22:32] going to give you a new body the promise
[22:35] is to us God's going to give us a new
[22:36] body at the
[22:38] Rapture amen praise God so we got that
[22:41] promise Hallelujah so let's not be weak
[22:42] in faith Hallelujah God's going to get
[22:44] us ready for the Rapture
[22:46] amen when I first came in the message
[22:48] back in 2001 I thought oh I don't have
[22:51] enough time to make it ready for the
[22:52] Rapture now look I've had now look at
[22:54] all this time I've had all this time to
[22:55] get ready for the Rapture if you want to
[22:57] go in the rapture God's going to give
[22:58] you time to get in the Rapture amen he
[23:00] will not leave one person behind that
[23:02] really wants to be in the
[23:04] Rapture just like with Noah AR now that
[23:07] it's not a type of the Rapture but it's
[23:08] a type of being saved God won't let
[23:10] Destruction come until every single
[23:12] believer has a safe place hallelujah
[23:15] amen so God makes sure every believer is
[23:17] rescued from the impending judgment upon
[23:20] the Earth praise God the Bible said God
[23:23] will not suffer the righteous to be uh
[23:25] destroyed with the wicked Hallelujah
[23:28] God will always rescue the Believers
[23:30] Hallelujah when the worldwide wrath of
[23:32] God comes on God will always rescue the
[23:34] Believers I love this I love this
[23:36] Abraham didn't consider oh my body's
[23:38] dead Sarah's dead we're past the years
[23:41] of of procreation he didn't consider
[23:44] that because he looked at the promise of
[23:46] God hallelujah amen he staggered not so
[23:49] when God looked at Abraham he didn't
[23:51] stagger because he kept pressing on
[23:53] through the battles Hallelujah he kept
[23:55] believing God he kept praying to God he
[23:57] kept conf confessing the promise of God
[23:59] hallelujah that's what we must do we
[24:01] must just confess the promise of God we
[24:03] must remember God's word hallelujah and
[24:05] God look down at us and when God writes
[24:07] the story of Our Lives it'll say John
[24:09] never stagger at the promise of God Amen
[24:12] brother amen and sister who they never
[24:13] Str staggered at God's promise amen
[24:16] sister Naomi and beus they were strong
[24:18] giving God glory amen amen I can call
[24:21] each one of your names amen amen and
[24:23] brother said you know there's certain
[24:25] things Paul wrote In the book of r that
[24:28] other Christians couldn't handle I want
[24:30] to be such a mature Christian that God
[24:31] can give me any word amen that he knows
[24:34] I can handle any promise of God
[24:36] hallelujah I don't want to be a baby
[24:38] Christian where God's got to Baby me on
[24:41] well come on baby let's just try to
[24:42] believe you'll make it through the
[24:44] trials you'll make it through the
[24:45] Rapture you you'll make it through 2024
[24:48] I don't want to be a baby I want to be a
[24:49] mature believer praise God and this is
[24:52] what the the Romans were and so were the
[24:54] Ephesians but said God couldn't teach
[24:56] those Corinthians the deeper things of
[24:58] God they were just a baby fashioned kind
[25:00] of church but he couldn't go to those
[25:03] great deep messages that he did to the
[25:04] Ephesians and the Romans because they
[25:07] wasn't able to take it now let's just
[25:10] have faith this morning uh let's have
[25:12] the the confidence of God in our heart
[25:14] that we're mature mature Christians and
[25:17] God can uh he can take us through
[25:19] whatever he can take us through and
[25:20] we'll still praise the Lord I was in
[25:24] contact with this message believer I
[25:25] don't remember where he's
[25:26] from
[25:28] uh he was a father of two boys and now
[25:31] the uh and one of the boys was a a
[25:33] famous boy in their little town I forget
[25:35] what it was I don't know if he was an
[25:36] athlete or what he was anyways he was a
[25:39] message believer and this young teenager
[25:41] died in a car accident and he was such a
[25:43] famous guy there a young teenager I
[25:45] think it was 18 years old that that the
[25:47] uh the the the TV station the local TV
[25:50] station came down to interview his
[25:52] father and they asked him about you know
[25:54] the accident and you know his favorite
[25:56] memories and the TV station put put on
[25:57] the TV and they said what's your last
[26:00] words you want to tell this
[26:01] community and his dad looked at the
[26:03] camera he's crying he said the Lord
[26:05] gives and the Lord takes away amen he
[26:08] said blessed be the name of the Lord the
[26:10] church that's the kind of mature faith
[26:12] that real Christians should have
[26:14] Hallelujah that's not a baby Christian
[26:17] right you know if God chooses to take
[26:18] our children or God chooses to do
[26:20] something that we don't understand the
[26:22] mature believer the Deep Christian says
[26:24] God gives and God takes away God brought
[26:27] me here who am I anyway praise God who
[26:30] am I what do I deserve anyway I don't
[26:32] deserve nothing God's already saved me
[26:34] he's already given me Grace hallelujah
[26:36] amen whatever God allows he's wise
[26:38] enough he allowed it and he'll guide me
[26:40] safely home praise God Amen if I lose
[26:43] somebody on this side surely I'll be you
[26:45] reunited on that side hallelujah it's
[26:47] coming a great reunion day hallelujah
[26:50] it's the hope of eternal life Hallelujah
[26:53] I just was so blessed by that that
[26:55] wasn't some baby you know no doubt I'm
[26:57] not saying it's it's it's it's normal to
[27:00] be sad it's normal but I'm talking about
[27:01] look at the faith that's that's that's
[27:03] job Faith right that's job level of
[27:06] patience Hallelujah that God could allow
[27:08] you to be tested in the greatest measure
[27:10] and you still come out praising God Amen
[27:12] I was reading yesterday you know how or
[27:14] the day before how David after his uh
[27:16] adultery you know he even went and
[27:18] fasted and prayed for that
[27:20] child right and the Bible said as soon
[27:23] as the child died everybody was all
[27:24] upset what's going to David do to
[27:26] himself what is he going to do to
[27:27] himself now he's he's fasting all these
[27:29] days and the Bible said he washed
[27:30] himself and he went up to the church and
[27:33] he started praising God may God help us
[27:36] to do that in our hardest moments when
[27:38] we don't feel like going to church may
[27:39] we come to church and give God glory
[27:42] Hallelujah because that's what a man or
[27:44] woman after the heart of God does
[27:46] they're they're they're they're strong
[27:48] enough in their faith praise God they
[27:49] got enough confidence in God to know
[27:51] that if God allowed it he'll bring me
[27:53] through it amen yay though I walk
[27:55] through the valley of the shadow of
[27:57] death I shall fear no evil Hallelujah
[27:59] Your Rod and your staff are comforting
[28:02] me praise God Amen I'm a sheep he's a
[28:05] Shepherd he's he's he's he's directing
[28:07] my path Hallelujah he's taking care of
[28:10] me he knows the beginning from the end
[28:12] hallelujah amen and his word cannot
[28:14] return void amen that was in my notes I
[28:17] don't know who that's for so amen PR for
[28:20] all of us now if you got your Bibles
[28:21] let's go to Romans 41 sorry Romans 71
[28:25] sorry Romans 71
[28:32] Glory now look at verse one I just got a
[28:34] few thoughts here know ye not brethren
[28:36] for I speak to them that know the law
[28:38] how that the law had dominion over a man
[28:40] as long as he liveth now let's back up
[28:43] to verse 23 because remember in chapter
[28:45] 6 chapter 6 is about the promises of God
[28:49] you're given after your water baptized
[28:51] that's why I'm looking at my Jun City
[28:53] friends they're all baptized this year
[28:55] amen so it might be a good blessing for
[28:57] you go back going read Romans 6 Romans 6
[28:59] lays out all the blessings of being
[29:01] baptized and what it means spiritually
[29:04] you were baptized into his death so you
[29:07] will be raised in his life amen
[29:09] hallelujah because you joined him by
[29:11] water baptism because you went down the
[29:13] water you will come up in the
[29:16] resurrection hallelujah praise God these
[29:18] are Divine Promises of God hallelujah
[29:22] this word cannot return
[29:24] void Hallelujah it'd be easier for on
[29:27] Earth to pass away than for one of these
[29:29] words to fail
[29:31] hallelujah amen God's word cannot fail
[29:34] hallelujah amen if you be dead with
[29:38] Christ you shall live with him also the
[29:39] Bible says amen but remember verse 23
[29:42] this is a very famous verse many people
[29:43] memorize this verse in the message and
[29:45] outside the message we memorize it at
[29:47] bible Club at the little uh the
[29:49] elementary Bible Club lot of the kids
[29:51] call on this one real fast for the wage
[29:54] of sin is death but the gift of God is
[29:56] eternal eternal life through Jesus
[29:58] Christ Our Lord praise God so these
[30:01] gifts children in a moment you know the
[30:02] these represent the gift that God gives
[30:04] to
[30:05] you right Victoria and is jenab here
[30:08] this
[30:09] morning oh there she is so jev didn't do
[30:12] any work for me to give her these gifts
[30:13] right she's only five what work could
[30:15] she do you know she might scrub the
[30:17] floor a little bit you know she might
[30:18] get some work done you know but there
[30:21] there's no they didn't earn it it's just
[30:23] from my heart praise God Amen that's how
[30:25] every real gift should be from the heart
[30:28] praise God Amen and then you know as a
[30:30] child as we know children will be really
[30:32] happy and uh they'll be so happy for the
[30:36] gift they'll want to hug daddy or
[30:38] something like that wink
[30:40] wink maybe they'll want to obey daddy
[30:42] and mommy no better when they get home
[30:44] they do a good job but you know what I'm
[30:46] talking about um it's a free gift
[30:49] salvation is a free gift so the rest of
[30:52] our lives After we receive salvation
[30:54] after we're baptized in water the Bible
[30:56] says we labor out of our love for God
[31:00] Amen because it's we receive the gift oh
[31:03] I remember the gift when I got saved and
[31:05] now everything after this it's just a
[31:07] it's a blessing to serve God Amen think
[31:09] about that God gave me the gift of
[31:11] Salvation now it's a blessing for me to
[31:12] take up my cross and follow him amen he
[31:16] saved me and now he says take up a cross
[31:19] and stop living for yourself am I'm
[31:22] preaching to myself I'm preaching myself
[31:24] stop living for yourself Jesse live for
[31:26] other people
[31:27] that's what I'm talking about amen so
[31:29] we're so thankful for the gift of
[31:31] salvation but now we need to learn how
[31:33] to die to ourselves so Christ can live
[31:35] through US amen so notice here in verse
[31:39] one I just these are just my notes from
[31:40] this morning's study the law had
[31:42] dominion over all of us the law it was
[31:45] the curse of the law that was so awful
[31:48] uh because the law forced you to be
[31:50] justified by your Works rather than
[31:52] faith in other words there's 613 Old
[31:54] Testament laws right and each one of
[31:55] them you better do and and if not then
[31:57] you you're cursed by all of it if you
[32:00] don't keep one of them the Bible said
[32:01] you're cursed by all of them and so it's
[32:04] constantly like oh I'm doing good for
[32:05] the last 10 minutes right and then I
[32:08] make a I make a
[32:10] sin or I did good the the first morning
[32:13] but then this afternoon I really
[32:14] struggled loving my
[32:15] neighbor you know it was constantly
[32:18] happy depressed happy guilty right
[32:21] joyful guilty joyful full of shame it
[32:25] was this back and forth all day now we
[32:27] experience that to a degree but the
[32:29] Bible says the blood of Jesus Christ
[32:31] does more for us in Hebrews 10 the Bible
[32:35] said we do not have a guilty conscience
[32:38] amen that's the difference with the
[32:40] blood of Jesus Christ we don't have to
[32:42] have the weight of of our guilty
[32:44] conscience as this chapter shows us our
[32:47] past life is
[32:49] dead it say dead is a doornail praise
[32:52] God Amen it's completely separated it's
[32:56] it's completely forgotten brother said
[32:59] all your sinful Works were in a book and
[33:01] they were thrown in the sea of
[33:04] forgetfulness never to be found amen so
[33:07] that is different now we have that
[33:09] conscience now he saved me he forgave me
[33:13] there's no more condemnation to me am
[33:16] Hallelujah yes I got to confess my sin
[33:19] but all that P all the Gil and shame all
[33:22] the curse have been taken
[33:25] away
[33:28] the Bible plainly tells us this as many
[33:31] of the works of the law are under the
[33:33] curse so see that that's a legalism
[33:35] right our Junction City friends were
[33:36] under and and some of us each one some
[33:38] of us in in other ways were under that
[33:40] right for us in the for us in the
[33:41] Assemblies of God the legalism was you
[33:44] got to speak in
[33:45] tongues that was the legalism I was
[33:47] raised under if you don't speak in
[33:49] tongues you're really not even Sav
[33:51] that's that's the that's what I was
[33:53] under now I didn't care because I was a
[33:55] sinner you know I once I got got saved I
[33:57] started to care yeah I walked in that
[33:59] class with the pastor I said
[34:01] pastor I know you're trying you went
[34:03] through all these things about tongues
[34:05] and I said pastor can I show you 1
[34:06] Corinthians 12 and it said do all speak
[34:08] in tongues and of course the answer is
[34:10] no I said well Pastor what about that he
[34:13] said well Jesse he said uh this is just
[34:16] what we believe I said okay I'm not
[34:17] joining the church have a good
[34:19] day I didn't even know the message at
[34:21] that point but I had enough
[34:23] understanding no the Bible's right
[34:27] you can speak with a million tongues and
[34:29] everything but if you don't have love it
[34:31] don't profit you nothing
[34:33] am there might be tongues of men and
[34:35] angels amen you might speak in the
[34:38] language of Gabriel right or wormwood
[34:41] that don't matter if you don't know the
[34:42] love of Jesus Christ when Jesus said if
[34:44] you love me keep my commands amen if you
[34:47] don't have that love it does you no good
[34:49] praise God amen
[34:52] amen so see I I thought I'd bring that
[34:55] in there that there's always legalism to
[34:57] every
[34:58] denomination not just Amish it's even in
[35:00] the Assemblies of God it's even in the
[35:02] CMA buddy
[35:04] right for it's written cursed is
[35:07] everyone that continueth not the things
[35:09] which are written in the book of the law
[35:10] to do them but that no man is justified
[35:14] by the law of the sight of God it's
[35:16] impossible for you to earn salvation
[35:18] that's a blessing that's that should
[35:21] make you say amen amen it's evident for
[35:24] the just shall live by faith amen faith
[35:28] is a substance of things hoped for it's
[35:30] an Evidence of not of Things Not Seen so
[35:33] we don't live by our works wow look what
[35:35] I've done today we live by the substance
[35:38] of faith in our hearts hallelujah or in
[35:41] our souls that's what we live by I'm
[35:43] saved by my faith in what God already
[35:46] did amen he's already saved me amen he's
[35:50] already revealed himself to me that's
[35:52] what I'm saved by I I'm saved by My
[35:54] Sacrifice hallelujah amen
[35:57] Glory the just shall live by faith not
[36:00] by his Works amen and the law is not of
[36:04] Faith legalism is not of Faith because
[36:07] it's I earn this I earn this I earn this
[36:10] you ever hear somebody give a testimony
[36:12] and say oh when I got saved I did this
[36:14] and then I did that they kind of got
[36:16] they're kind of clouded in their minds
[36:18] when I got saved the Bible said the
[36:20] goodness of God led me to
[36:22] repentance I got saved God finally let
[36:25] me wake up and recog
[36:27] that his will is I love that song sister
[36:29] n was saying one one time his will is
[36:31] stronger than my will that's why I got
[36:33] saved amen I'm undone by the mercy of
[36:36] Jesus Amen so we talk about salvation
[36:39] it's about what Christ did not what I
[36:42] did amen I just finally died out I just
[36:45] finally said okay I'm going to stop
[36:46] fighting against God I'm going to stop
[36:48] fighting against heaven and now I'm
[36:49] going to let Heaven Come Into Me
[36:51] Hallelujah
[36:53] God that's why I got Sav amen because is
[36:57] stronger than me
[36:59] amen
[37:02] glory the law is not of Faith the man
[37:04] that doth them shall live in
[37:07] them Christ has redeemed us now look at
[37:09] this I love this verse if you ever think
[37:11] and sister Z and I were texting about
[37:13] this well I guess a little bit about
[37:14] cursing and everything like that I love
[37:16] this I'm already bought bought back from
[37:20] the curse of the law so the curse of the
[37:23] law is I'm not good enough I haven't
[37:24] kept all the commands that's the curse
[37:26] of because you broke one you're guilty
[37:28] of all them that's what the Bible
[37:30] says but Christ bought me he paid the
[37:33] price that I am out of that
[37:36] condemnation he redeem means to buy
[37:39] back right so Jesus purchased us with
[37:43] his blood the Bible says right amen and
[37:47] now I'm no longer cursed you're no
[37:50] longer curse
[37:52] amen cursed is everyone that hangeth on
[37:55] a tree so Jesus took our curse he kept
[37:58] all the law amen right he paid the
[38:01] penalty for all of our sin all of our
[38:03] sin were was placed upon him the Lamb of
[38:06] God and now there's no more curse on us
[38:09] amen now will we get spanked if we make
[38:11] a mistake yes but that doesn't mean
[38:13] we're cursed amen I'm blessed amen the
[38:17] Bible said you are blessed you are not
[38:19] cursed anymore you are blessed now
[38:22] Hallelujah because of what Christ did
[38:25] amen standing on the word amen I don't
[38:28] care what Satan says Satan didn't write
[38:30] the Bible God wrote the Bible am Satan's
[38:33] the father of lives God the father of
[38:35] Truth amen I choose to believe Christ
[38:39] hallelujah amen I'm not under the curse
[38:42] of the law anymore yes I I I want Jesus
[38:45] to say Well done good and faithful
[38:47] servant but that's out of my daily dying
[38:50] right that's out of my appreciation it's
[38:52] not that I'm going to earn it it's
[38:54] impossible for me to earn it right talk
[38:56] about a Christmas
[38:58] message I sure where all this came from
[39:01] Romans 2:7 I'm Sor Romans 7:2 for the
[39:04] woman which ha a husband look look at
[39:07] this interesting Paul goes from chapter
[39:09] six to baptism and then he goes into a
[39:11] type of
[39:12] marriage see when you got baptized you
[39:14] were coming under the headship of your
[39:16] husband spiritually right amen right
[39:18] some of our sisters aren't married right
[39:20] some our brothers here are maybe not
[39:22] married young especially the younger
[39:23] ones but it's that's what happens
[39:25] spiritually when you get
[39:26] baptized you're choosing Christ to be
[39:29] your head Your Leader amen your ruler am
[39:34] that's what Lord means ruler Master amen
[39:36] hallelujah amen how many enjoy getting
[39:39] uh uh directions from your master yes
[39:42] I'm me enjoy instructions from the Great
[39:44] Master amen Jesus that's where we got
[39:46] this Bible for amen hallelujah that's
[39:48] why he gives us dreams and visions and
[39:51] Revelations praise God because he wants
[39:53] to give us instruction on how to serve
[39:56] him Hal hallelujah amen
[39:58] amen for the woman ha I'm sorry which
[40:01] hath an husband is bound by the law to
[40:03] her husband so long as he liveth but if
[40:05] the husband be dead she's loose from the
[40:07] law of her husband so the law being
[40:10] under the
[40:12] law the curse it's liken unto a marriage
[40:15] partner now that doesn't sound like a
[40:16] good marriage partner to be married to
[40:19] right and it's it's liken unto a male so
[40:22] the law was like a male uh husband and
[40:25] then we're liken to as a body of
[40:27] Believers we're like it unto a woman
[40:29] right and this Dominion lasts until
[40:33] death loosening only happens at death
[40:37] Hallelujah right so once a man or woman
[40:40] dies in a marriage that person is
[40:41] totally free now to marry whoever they
[40:43] want or they can remain single praise
[40:45] God right but death death is the only
[40:49] thing that allows someone to leave that
[40:51] Covenant right verse three is confirms
[40:54] it now Paul confirms this still lasts
[40:57] that was the Old Testament that still
[40:59] lasts in the New Testament amen
[41:01] hallelujah verse three so then if while
[41:04] her husband liveth she'd be married to
[41:06] another man she should be called an
[41:08] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[41:10] she's free from that law so that she is
[41:12] no adulterous though she' be married to
[41:14] another man now we see that in America
[41:16] it's it's rampant so many people are
[41:18] married a second time third time fourth
[41:20] time after that they just stopped
[41:21] getting married because there's they
[41:22] realize they're a failure right at
[41:25] keeping their promises
[41:27] right but this is what Paul tells us
[41:28] that this is why so many people will not
[41:30] inherit the kingdom of God just because
[41:32] of their marriage
[41:34] choices right adulterers fornicators
[41:37] will not inherit the kingdom of God and
[41:39] what is the kingdom of God the Holy
[41:40] Ghost amen amen it's Luke 17 Jesus said
[41:43] the kingdom of God is within you
[41:46] Hallelujah there is a future Kingdom to
[41:48] come but if someone wants to have the
[41:50] kingdom now if they want to work for the
[41:51] kingdom now they must be married the
[41:53] right way praise God Amen
[42:00] that's the power of the institution of
[42:02] marriage and the natural the natural is
[42:05] given to us here Paul tells us the power
[42:07] of a natural marriage but there's a
[42:09] spiritual application here as well we
[42:11] are under the law we're under legalism
[42:13] but now legalism has died
[42:16] amen amen legalism has died now we live
[42:20] by faith
[42:21] Hallelujah now we're married to faith in
[42:24] Christ Jesus amen amen Glory verse four
[42:27] says wherefore my brethren you are also
[42:29] become dead to the law by the by the
[42:31] body of Christ amen that ye should be
[42:35] married to
[42:36] another amen even to him who raised from
[42:39] the dead that we should bring forth
[42:42] fruit unto God amen glory so the Bible
[42:46] says plainly that when we become a
[42:48] Christian when we after we got baptized
[42:50] we're you know our old law our old curse
[42:53] our old life of legalism is dead
[42:57] and if it dies it sure ain't coming back
[42:59] amen there's no Resurrection for death
[43:02] in the Bible amen hallelujah amen glory
[43:06] that old life the old curse all the
[43:09] condemnation is now gone you are loose
[43:12] in Jesus Christ's name
[43:14] amen like Jesus told that woman woman
[43:17] thou art loose can I say this bride of
[43:19] Jesus Christ you are loose from the
[43:21] curse of the law praise God you are
[43:24] loose from your past you're loose from
[43:27] your sins you're loose from your guilt
[43:29] and your shame you are loose in Jesus
[43:32] Christ
[43:33] name Hallelujah that's not what I said
[43:36] that's what the Bible say
[43:40] am and now this is the beautiful part
[43:42] brother brings us out when he preaches
[43:44] this sermon uh the invisible Union of
[43:46] the Bride of Jesus Christ in November
[43:49] 65 he's preaching on Thanksgiving day he
[43:52] shows how when we're born again we now
[43:54] have a spiritual union with with
[43:57] Christ we're married to him by our soul
[44:00] our soul is married amen isn't that why
[44:03] you love to pick up your Bible in the
[44:04] mornings is that like is that why you
[44:06] like to sing at your homes and have
[44:09] prayer time because I'm United with that
[44:12] amen amen I'm in love with Christ amen
[44:15] oh that's why I like to sing to him
[44:17] that's why I like to read his love
[44:19] letter to me sister vress amen I like to
[44:22] read his love letter Oh you mean Jesus
[44:24] you love you love me this much amen you
[44:26] wrote me this big long love letter right
[44:29] I read every phrase brother Austin and I
[44:31] keep reading it every
[44:33] day I want to know his entire Love
[44:35] Letter what did he say to me CU I know
[44:38] he loves me
[44:39] amen my old my old spouse is dead the
[44:42] law is dead it's dead it's gone but now
[44:46] I got a new spouse it's Christ
[44:49] hallelujah it's the way the truth and
[44:51] the life amen
[44:54] amen our husband took our curse that was
[44:59] on us upon himself and then he gives us
[45:02] the
[45:03] blessing he was cursed all sin was
[45:05] placed upon him that all the blessing
[45:07] might be placed upon
[45:11] us Galatians 3:14 that The Blessing of
[45:14] Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[45:17] through Jesus Christ that me we might
[45:19] receive the promise of the spirit
[45:22] through faith so what is the blessing
[45:24] the Holy Spirit filling up
[45:26] the Holy Spirit anointing us the Holy
[45:29] Spirit leading us not not not a not a a
[45:32] seat of discrepancy not the Antichrist
[45:34] Spirit but the Holy Spirit praise
[45:38] God brother said if you got the Holy
[45:40] Ghost it'll always point you back to the
[45:41] word of God aren't you glad you always
[45:43] go back to the word of God who gets the
[45:45] final say on your life who who gets the
[45:47] final say on your decisions the word of
[45:49] God that's a good sign you're born again
[45:52] amen hallelujah this is the blessing I'm
[45:56] not under a curse I'm I'm under the
[45:58] blessing
[46:00] Hallelujah I'm married to Christ Jesus
[46:03] I'm United to Christ in my soul amen
[46:07] that's
[46:09] right now I want to emphasize this
[46:11] brother emphasizes fruit through the
[46:14] union with Christ so Paul says you're
[46:17] not married to legalism
[46:18] anymore you're not saved by your works
[46:21] the church
[46:22] saiden although you should be zealous
[46:24] for good works
[46:26] one guy accused me of that he said
[46:27] you're a legalist this week you know I
[46:29] made a video or something he said you're
[46:31] a legalist I said you
[46:33] misunderstood I'm not I'm not saved by
[46:35] my works I'm just zealous for good works
[46:37] right I said you only use one verse
[46:40] there's other verses you forgot about
[46:42] there's a lot more verses in that love
[46:44] letter that he forgot to read that's
[46:46] right I know I'm not saved by my works
[46:49] it's impossible right I'm saved by faith
[46:53] amen but then the Bible says when you're
[46:54] saved by faith you're created unto good
[46:57] works amen that's the reason I was
[46:59] created to find out what God wants to do
[47:02] with me praise God amen amen amen so
[47:06] brother emphasizes now that you're
[47:08] married to Christ you should bring forth
[47:10] fruit so it speaks of spiritual fruit
[47:14] right like a wife would bring forth
[47:15] children it's called the fruit of the
[47:18] Union right and so brother breaks into
[47:21] that in this sermon if we're married to
[47:23] Christ we should see some fruit spirit
[47:25] fruit brought
[47:27] forth amen I love it it's a beautiful
[47:29] thought really is that's why it's such a
[47:32] memorable sermon that's why so many
[47:33] preachers take so many good quotes out
[47:35] of here it's such a beautiful thought
[47:36] and think of that it was a Thanksgiving
[47:39] sermon you should be thankful that your
[47:42] old spouse is dead and now you're
[47:44] married to Christ Hallelujah who can
[47:47] never die again amen GL the law could
[47:51] die Christ died once but now he lives
[47:54] forever more praise God
[47:56] never to die again
[47:59] Hallelujah so brother used Romans 7 1-4
[48:03] as part of his text when he preached
[48:04] invisible union now earlier this year if
[48:06] you remember right before we went to
[48:07] Brother cams in a April I felt let the
[48:11] Lord to preach on that I preached on as
[48:12] though you never did it in the first
[48:14] place because brother ad preaches this
[48:16] message and he says if your old husband
[48:19] is dead then he says there's no more
[48:22] record of that husband right the
[48:24] husband's dead
[48:26] you're completely loose from your past
[48:29] brother said when you come to Christ
[48:30] you're saved in such a way it's as
[48:33] though you never did those sins in the
[48:35] first place
[48:37] amen now we all know we did them we all
[48:41] know we s in the past but he says it's
[48:43] as though in other words God's
[48:46] forgiveness is so great that God even
[48:49] forgets your sins God won't bring them
[48:51] up amen your new husband won't bring it
[48:55] up to pass amen hallelujah how'd you
[48:57] like that if you had a new spouse right
[48:59] and they kept bringing up uh well I was
[49:01] married to this person well I wish you
[49:02] were more like that person Jesus don't
[49:04] do that to us amen we should do it to
[49:07] Jesus amen hallelujah amen would that be
[49:10] a happy
[49:11] home well my other husband he he was a
[49:15] lot more handsome than
[49:17] you or vice you
[49:19] whatever it would just be awful but
[49:22] Jesus forgives all of our pasts amen
[49:25] amen we got a freshed our new creation
[49:29] New Life New Beginning Hallelujah that's
[49:32] what Jesus does Amen now and just so you
[49:36] understand that I I wanted to show the
[49:38] balance uh 1 John 3:9 so let's read that
[49:41] first John
[49:45] 3:9 well it's a good atmosphere in here
[49:46] I really appreciate the polling on the
[49:48] word of God I just felt Victory as soon
[49:50] as I walked out the door here so thank
[49:51] you the amen all the song specials
[49:53] really enjoyed that uh first first John
[49:55] 3:9 if the devil ever condemns you take
[49:58] him back to this verse that's what I do
[49:59] of Amen brother we go to Romans 4 I kind
[50:02] of go to First John 3:9 wink wink that's
[50:05] kind of where I go because I need to
[50:07] tell the devil I the real me never sin
[50:09] in the first
[50:11] place the real me the part of me that
[50:14] came out of God because I came from
[50:15] somewhere right you know I was going
[50:17] through all these old pictures this week
[50:18] and signs like where am I daddy where am
[50:20] I he wasn't born yet how do you explain
[50:23] to a three-year-old where he was at
[50:24] before he got here it's hard to do so I
[50:27] just say Zion you were in
[50:30] God you were in God in heaven the Bible
[50:33] said we were chosen in Christ before the
[50:36] foundation of the world praise God so
[50:38] God said he just dramatized it God has a
[50:41] photo album in his mind of all the
[50:43] saints down Through the Ages and there's
[50:45] a picture of you in
[50:47] there amen and God takes it out and you
[50:51] know uh God takes it out around the the
[50:54] Year 1980 says okay it's time for Jesse
[50:57] here's what he looks like now it's time
[50:58] for him to come down through the uh the
[51:00] realm of his mother and
[51:02] father and I didn't even know it but God
[51:04] already had a record of me in heaven
[51:06] praise God said now it's time for him to
[51:08] come down and each person was s down at
[51:10] the right time in season oh God wanted
[51:13] you here right now cuz God wants to use
[51:15] you as his workmanship for God's glory
[51:18] hallelujah amen it's a photo album of
[51:21] his many membered
[51:23] bride his Gentile bride
[51:26] Hallelujah so if the devil tells
[51:29] you all these lies take them back to 1
[51:31] John 3:9 who soever is born of God does
[51:35] not commit sins amen for his seed
[51:39] remains in him he cannot sin because
[51:42] he's born of God this is speaking of the
[51:44] Soul Your Soul cannot sin if God's in
[51:47] there because that Soul came from
[51:50] God right your flesh sins your mind sins
[51:53] but the soul can not sin remember two
[51:58] chapters earlier the Bible said If any
[51:59] man said he don't sin he's a
[52:01] liar so we can't say I never sinned in
[52:04] my flesh that's where you sin you have
[52:05] to say I Sinn in my flesh I sin in my
[52:08] mind but there's a part of me that never
[52:10] did Sin Hallelujah that's the part Jesus
[52:13] married
[52:14] amen that's the part he wants to marry
[52:16] that's the union with Christ you have in
[52:19] your soul praise God Amen so take the
[52:21] devil back there well devil yes my flesh
[52:24] sinned my mind sin but my soul never did
[52:26] Sin and Jesus already paid the price for
[52:29] all my fleshly sins
[52:31] amen
[52:33] amen hallelujah amen that's what the
[52:36] word of God says y so see that moment
[52:39] where the word of God comes in you
[52:41] that's where you recognize wow I did

[59:43] communities so let's keep praying for

[1:03:30] right now I have a video there's four
[1:03:33] scriptures that condemn make maybe five
[1:03:35] five sinful Fashions the Bible says
[1:03:37] modest clothing 1 Timothy 2 they deny
[1:03:41] acts 238 late night parties is condemned
[1:03:43] in 1 Corinthians 6 and Galatians 5 I
[1:03:45] didn't have time to put up all the verse
[1:03:46] up there what I'm saying is how can
[1:03:48] these churches be married to Christ when
[1:03:50] they break all of his
[1:03:52] commands and this thought struck me a
[1:03:54] while ago brother said there's hundreds
[1:03:56] of
[1:03:59] them there's hundreds of differences
[1:04:01] between the bride of Christ and the
[1:04:04] Bride of
[1:04:05] Satan yes there's lots of differences
[1:04:08] right now what interesting brother John
[1:04:10] is that Jesus said to be so close it
[1:04:12] deceive the very left so that's another
[1:04:14] thought I just struck me right now I
[1:04:15] actually didn't have that in my
[1:04:17] notes hundreds of
[1:04:19] them yeah here he list he list some more
[1:04:22] here and I want to open this note real
[1:04:23] quick
[1:04:25] I hope this is not boring to you but I
[1:04:26] want to just I just want to take a
[1:04:27] little on this I thought this was so
[1:04:29] inspired brother said there's hundreds
[1:04:31] of
[1:04:32] them hundreds of differences between the
[1:04:35] bride of Christ and the false
[1:04:38] bride
[1:04:41] Hallelujah does the bible agree with the
[1:04:43] woman bobbing her hair the congregation
[1:04:44] says no does the bible agree with three
[1:04:47] baptisms one for the father son Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost no no such thing does the bible
[1:04:52] agree with women wearing men's clothing
[1:04:53] or not today men wearing women's
[1:04:55] clothing well that's just three of them
[1:04:58] there when there's hundreds more search
[1:05:00] it out in the light of God's word amen
[1:05:03] you say I'm a church member so was Kane
[1:05:05] Kane went to church right he he made a
[1:05:07] sacrifice he he built an altar right so
[1:05:10] is Eve he says she met with God when God
[1:05:13] would come down the cool of the evening
[1:05:14] Adam and Eve would always meet with God
[1:05:17] the Bible predicts in the last days the
[1:05:18] L of SE will be the same now I'm not I'm
[1:05:21] going to go through this fast I made a
[1:05:23] list yesterday of 100 differences
[1:05:25] between us and
[1:05:27] denominations I made a list it took me
[1:05:29] about an
[1:05:30] hour not going to bore you by reading
[1:05:32] the whole thing but I shouldn't say bore
[1:05:33] you I'm not going to wear you out I
[1:05:35] guess that's probably
[1:05:37] it but there's 10 doctrines in Hebrews 6
[1:05:41] 1-2 that we have different than
[1:05:44] denominations and then there's 20
[1:05:46] prophetic scriptures that we have
[1:05:48] different than denominations I listed
[1:05:50] every one of them if you want to copy
[1:05:51] Saints I'm going to make a video about
[1:05:52] this too because that was the Holy Ghost
[1:05:55] in brother brand saying there's hundreds
[1:05:57] of differences between us and the Roman
[1:05:59] Catholic church and all these
[1:06:01] denominations glory amen in other words
[1:06:04] some people uh they wouldn't look at us
[1:06:06] and say well wow they're they're a lot
[1:06:07] like the Roman they're a lot like the
[1:06:09] Lutheran no I came out of the Lutheran
[1:06:11] Church they're a lot like the
[1:06:12] Pentecostal no there's hundreds of
[1:06:14] differences between me and the
[1:06:16] Pentecostal amen other words Jesus has
[1:06:19] such a separated bride she's way
[1:06:22] different than the worldly Church amen
[1:06:26] hallelujah that's up to 20 no now it's
[1:06:28] up to 30 there's five about salvation
[1:06:31] the Bap the Holy Ghost there's eight
[1:06:33] about modesty you know high heels
[1:06:34] tattoos separate garments thighs or
[1:06:37] nakedness expensive hair and jewelry uh
[1:06:39] there's the mysteries of God in there
[1:06:42] there's Holiness and Doctrine
[1:06:43] homosexuality no women Angels no women
[1:06:45] preachers you see how I just you can
[1:06:46] just build this list so easily right
[1:06:49] sure Pope is the Antichrist mesic was
[1:06:51] God in flesh not some priest they think
[1:06:53] he's some people think he's just a
[1:06:54] priest it was God right Daniel 70 weeks
[1:06:59] mark of the beast uh the five elements
[1:07:02] of the human Spirit Grace can be
[1:07:04] rejected Grace can be failed the gifts
[1:07:06] of the Holy Ghost are in operation names
[1:07:08] can be blotted off of The Book of Life
[1:07:10] Jesus said so right Spirit of Jezebel
[1:07:13] Jesus leading captivity captive uh Ms
[1:07:17] fasting prayers the last sign of the
[1:07:18] Gentiles that's just a hundred of them
[1:07:21] now I was almost going to preach all of
[1:07:23] them to you but I see how I how the
[1:07:24] service is going I don't want to wear he
[1:07:26] out but that was so inspired of the Holy
[1:07:30] Ghost there's hundreds of differences
[1:07:32] between the message churches and all the
[1:07:35] other ones
[1:07:37] righten in other words when Jesus looked
[1:07:39] at you he said oh you're you're not
[1:07:41] you're nothing like that other church
[1:07:43] and I'm not trying to be critical I'm
[1:07:45] just saying Jesus when he looks at his
[1:07:47] wife she's way different she ain't even
[1:07:49] he ain't even attracted to that other
[1:07:52] church amen
[1:07:55] Hallelujah you are so different there
[1:07:57] are so many things different about you
[1:07:59] thank God that's just the way you look
[1:08:01] in his photo album
[1:08:03] hallelujah hallelujah hundreds of
[1:08:06] differences Hallelujah am no wonder he
[1:08:08] put the other one away Glory no wonder
[1:08:10] he called himself a bride without spot
[1:08:13] without blemish hallelujah amen I want
[1:08:17] to make a video on that I'd like to get
[1:08:19] up to at least 200 then I can make the
[1:08:21] video on it brother said hundreds I can
[1:08:24] just get to 200 now I know I if I just
[1:08:26] look at for example if I just look at
[1:08:27] the RO the Mormon Church brother John if
[1:08:30] I just looked at the the Mormon Church's
[1:08:31] website I could find a 100 differences
[1:08:33] right
[1:08:34] there I have the I have the Roman
[1:08:36] Catholic catechism in there it's about a
[1:08:38] thousand Pages oh I could probably find
[1:08:40] a thousand
[1:08:41] differences right you see how he was so
[1:08:45] inspired of the Holy Ghost amen he
[1:08:46] didn't have to say thus say the Lord
[1:08:48] because God was speaking to him at that
[1:08:50] moment but then we go search it out the
[1:08:52] Bible said prove all things amen so
[1:08:55] sometimes he said th say the Lord
[1:08:57] sometimes he didn't how do you know if
[1:08:58] he didn't say it Go prove it by the word
[1:09:00] of God H that's how you know it's still
[1:09:03] from the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:08] glory now look at this spiritual wies
[1:09:10] submit to your own husbands as unto the
[1:09:12] Lord so you married women don't go try
[1:09:15] to obey some other man obey your
[1:09:17] husband right for the husband is head of
[1:09:20] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[1:09:21] the church he's the savior of the body
[1:09:23] therefore as Christ is subject I'm sorry
[1:09:26] I'm sorry there forgive me Lord
[1:09:28] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:09:30] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:09:33] husbands and
[1:09:34] everything and I just showed you really
[1:09:36] briefly there's over a hundred things
[1:09:39] that churches will not submit to to
[1:09:42] Christ the
[1:09:43] husband but you will amen amen that's
[1:09:47] why you're the bride yeah that's right
[1:09:50] the bride's in the Bible amen John said
[1:09:53] John the Baptist said whoever has the
[1:09:55] bridegroom is the bride amen hallelujah
[1:09:59] amen Jesus wants a bride right who's got
[1:10:02] hundreds of differences from the
[1:10:05] world oh my Hallelujah this is what he
[1:10:09] does and then oh yeah as the church is
[1:10:12] subject in the Christ why should be in
[1:10:14] everything so that means everything in
[1:10:16] the word of God we want to obey amen one
[1:10:20] guy got on there on my sermons to you
[1:10:21] guys there in J City one guy got on
[1:10:23] there said why you preaching so much
[1:10:25] false Doctrine I said show me one false
[1:10:28] Doctrine I asked him like four times he
[1:10:30] still hasn't found one yet I said amen I
[1:10:33] said the reason you can't find any is cu
[1:10:35] I didn't preach any false doctr
[1:10:38] everything I taught Sarah Ruth was right
[1:10:40] out the
[1:10:41] Bible Hallelujah is that right now if I
[1:10:45] I preach something wrong you come tell
[1:10:47] me and I'll I'll say sorry I've done
[1:10:48] that
[1:10:49] before but that's the reason they can't
[1:10:52] find anything is because I didn't say
[1:10:53] anything wrong by the help of God not
[1:10:56] because of me but because of God's
[1:10:58] spirit God's blessing amen it's God's
[1:11:01] blessing see only the bride submits to
[1:11:04] all of the word we have no head but
[1:11:06] Christ right like when we do questions
[1:11:09] and answers I can tell you my opinion
[1:11:11] but really my opinion don't really
[1:11:13] matter it's what the word of God says
[1:11:15] that's right and I hope my church I hope
[1:11:16] our home Church don't take my opinion if
[1:11:18] it disagrees with the word of God take
[1:11:20] the word of God Amen you have you don't
[1:11:23] need my permission you have God's
[1:11:24] permission obey God not me praise God
[1:11:27] I'm trying to point you to the word of
[1:11:29] God the best I can but on things I don't
[1:11:31] understand I just say Here's my thought
[1:11:33] but if there's ever disagreement if I'm
[1:11:34] wrong God forbid I'd be wrong but if I'm
[1:11:36] wrong then you stay with your husband
[1:11:38] Christ
[1:11:39] amen you're not married to me you're
[1:11:41] married to Christ now there's one quote
[1:11:43] brother says the pastor is like the
[1:11:45] husband of the church but there's only
[1:11:47] one quote he doesn't preach a whole
[1:11:49] sermon on it and the devil has used that
[1:11:51] quote to make pastors Lords and tyrants
[1:11:53] over churches so that's why I don't use
[1:11:55] that it's it's not really a good type
[1:11:57] for me it's it's not like
[1:12:01] that yes you know yes yes the the
[1:12:04] husband is head of the wife yes yes the
[1:12:06] pastor The Bishop's head of the
[1:12:08] church but I'm not a perfect head right
[1:12:12] I'm not a perfect man right Christ and
[1:12:15] I'm not the I'm not at the top of the
[1:12:17] the chain Jesus is the top and the top
[1:12:20] of him is God amen amen right visible
[1:12:23] Spirits the top of all of it the
[1:12:25] heavenly father Hallelujah I thought I
[1:12:28] laid that in there now he says harand
[1:12:30] love your wives even as Christ Lov the
[1:12:31] church and gave himself for that he
[1:12:33] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:12:35] washing of the Water by the word amen so
[1:12:39] just you know uh they didn't take many
[1:12:42] baths in those days they use a lot of
[1:12:44] oils right but before they would have a
[1:12:46] marriage you know remember remember with
[1:12:47] Esther she had to spend a whole year
[1:12:49] getting washed and
[1:12:51] cleansed right to make sure she was
[1:12:54] just married to that that she just be
[1:12:56] married to that man she has received no
[1:12:57] other seed right she only received seed
[1:12:59] from the husband praise God
[1:13:02] see and the Bible said the man he's got
[1:13:05] to get her ready for the wedding praise
[1:13:07] God hallelujah and the Bible said Jesus
[1:13:10] washes us with the water of the word
[1:13:14] right amen uh jenemy fell on on
[1:13:16] Wednesday night right and she had all
[1:13:18] this dirt on her she had scrapes on her
[1:13:19] knee and she was crying I was so sad she
[1:13:22] feel better now about God
[1:13:24] but I had to take those cuts in there
[1:13:25] and I had to go get some soap and wash
[1:13:28] them out I don't do as good as Mommy
[1:13:29] does it but I do it
[1:13:31] okay but I had to get some soap out and
[1:13:34] that's what Jesus does all of our
[1:13:36] blemishes and the Bible actually says
[1:13:38] that God did that to Israel so no doubt
[1:13:40] God does it to us too God finds us the
[1:13:43] world's it's like the parable of the
[1:13:44] Good Samaritan the world leaves us half
[1:13:47] dead right the CMA left you half dead
[1:13:51] the assies of God left me half dead but
[1:13:53] there came along a Good Samaritan am
[1:13:56] Hallelujah he started cleaning me up
[1:13:58] amen and then he poured some oil and
[1:14:00] wine
[1:14:01] Hallelujah he fill me with the Holy
[1:14:03] Ghost he gave me wine for Revelation
[1:14:07] hallelujah amen and they took me to the
[1:14:10] end and he said I'm paying you whatever
[1:14:12] you have Hallelujah take care of this
[1:14:14] guy cuz when I come back I'm going to
[1:14:16] rescue him out of here
[1:14:19] hallelujah amen yes so the washed them
[1:14:24] with the oil and the
[1:14:29] wine that's why I can pass him for 17
[1:14:31] years and it never gets old like like
[1:14:33] remember Wednesday night we're weeping
[1:14:35] and crying God just comes around on a
[1:14:38] Wednesday night and just re shows us a
[1:14:40] little more glimp glimpse of his
[1:14:43] love he pours a little more wine in
[1:14:46] there no you're you're wounded you're
[1:14:48] hurt this week you had some troubles

[1:14:57] little dry out there in the world let me
[1:14:58] pour some oil on there let me freshen
[1:15:01] you up a little bit right oh it never
[1:15:04] gets old because Christ week in week out
[1:15:08] year in year out washing us cleansing us
[1:15:11] hallelujah give us fresh Revelation
[1:15:14] fresh stimulation giving us an anointing
[1:15:16] Hallelujah we need the anointing praise
[1:15:20] God oh my is constantly watching us year
[1:15:24] after year amen sometimes want to bang
[1:15:27] my head out here it's so
[1:15:29] wonderful it's such a beautiful plan of
[1:15:33] God because I'm not married to legalism
[1:15:37] anymore he's not my husband Christ is my
[1:15:41] husband I got the blessing of Christ I'm
[1:15:43] not under a curse I'm blessed
[1:15:47] amen I can see it in my life oh yeah I
[1:15:50] even I even emailed my employer and I
[1:15:52] said thank you for uh covering my
[1:15:55] insurance there's this big story I
[1:15:56] forgot to turn in a paper so they're G
[1:15:58] to find me
[1:15:59] $3,500 I was seven days late because I
[1:16:01] just forgot about it and I said could
[1:16:03] you please have mercy on me and as soon
[1:16:06] as I saw you know my my stomach sank and
[1:16:08] then that day God woke up my wife and
[1:16:10] just allowed her to fast and she said I
[1:16:11] wonder why I'm fasting today see church
[1:16:14] we need to follow the leading of the
[1:16:15] Holy Spirit never know why God make
[1:16:17] maybe he as you miss a meal don't be
[1:16:19] discouraged maybe he wants you to pray
[1:16:20] for somebody so as soon as I text my
[1:16:23] wife she said oh that's the reason I'm
[1:16:24] supposed to pray it's going to be all
[1:16:26] right God has me fasting now I I
[1:16:28] struggled for a couple weeks are they
[1:16:29] really going to receive
[1:16:30] this but eventually he wrote me back and
[1:16:33] and I said I said Thank you for having
[1:16:35] mercy on me I said I was so happy I went
[1:16:37] and danced at church and the woman wrote
[1:16:39] back and said she said I'm glad you got
[1:16:40] to celebrate
[1:16:42] that but see now she knows there's
[1:16:45] people that dance when God does
[1:16:46] something great for
[1:16:48] them it's a chance every Everything is a
[1:16:51] testimony it's a chance to show how much
[1:16:53] we love Jesus
[1:16:58] Hallelujah I'm glad you got to have some
[1:17:00] celebration I sure did s all over me and
[1:17:03] dancing and praising the Lord it was
[1:17:04] sure a celebration
[1:17:06] Hallelujah Grant it Jesus amen that will
[1:17:09] always rejoice in what he's done for us
[1:17:11] am now I want to take a few minutes here
[1:17:13] I'm almost at my hour and a half just
[1:17:15] because I got to memorize noon's always
[1:17:16] an hour and a half so I wasn't keeping
[1:17:18] track of
[1:17:20] time but let let's let's close with this
[1:17:22] now if you got your Bible let's go to
[1:17:24] Colossians 2 you know in the message you
[1:17:26] know a lot of people struggle with
[1:17:28] whether to do Christmas or not and so I
[1:17:31] just want to read this just so you can
[1:17:33] see it and I was reminded by a preacher
[1:17:35] this week I was listening to a preacher
[1:17:37] I'll share that in just a moment
[1:17:38] Colossians
[1:17:39] 2:16 brother R has quotes you know on
[1:17:42] both sides I believe all the quotes line
[1:17:44] up I really
[1:17:46] do um but some people you know they they
[1:17:49] think it's wrong to give somebody a gift
[1:17:51] at Christmas time or something like that
[1:17:53] or even to acknowledge that Jesus was
[1:17:58] born
[1:18:02] umans Colossians 2:16
[1:18:06] sorry so if there's ever any question
[1:18:08] about you know whether you can have a
[1:18:10] holiday or not of course you can have a
[1:18:12] holiday just make sure no sin gets into
[1:18:14] it right as brother Bram said what what
[1:18:18] sin is there in Remembering Jesus was
[1:18:20] born what sin is there taking one one
[1:18:23] day out of the Year remembering God sent
[1:18:25] us the greatest gift he could ever send
[1:18:26] us amen there's no sin in
[1:18:29] that right Colossians 2:16 uh let no man
[1:18:33] therefore judge you in meat or drink or
[1:18:34] in respect of an holy day so see
[1:18:36] whatever day you consider
[1:18:38] holy don't let somebody judge you in
[1:18:41] that or in the respect of whole day or
[1:18:43] of the new moon or the news or of the
[1:18:45] Sabbath days which are a shadow of
[1:18:46] things to come but the body is
[1:18:49] Christ so the main thing in church if
[1:18:51] you have a if you have a holiday make
[1:18:53] sure it's holy it's like tomorrow when
[1:18:55] the kids open up gifts we're not going
[1:18:57] to we're not going to sing Jingle Bells
[1:19:00] we're going to sing Joy to the World
[1:19:01] Jesus Christ is born we're going to read
[1:19:03] Luke 2 Matthew 2 maybe Matthew 1
[1:19:07] hallelujah it's actually extra worship
[1:19:10] time amen right it's extra worship time
[1:19:15] it's a holy day and yes you can Feast on
[1:19:17] a holy day there's nothing wrong you
[1:19:18] don't have to fast just because it's a
[1:19:20] holy day don't mean you have to fast you
[1:19:21] could but you don't have to
[1:19:23] it's a chance for me to show my children
[1:19:25] I love you it's a they love they look
[1:19:27] forward to this day right it's just
[1:19:30] whatever you do make sure it's holy yes
[1:19:34] right make sure it's holy so I made a
[1:19:36] video about it why I mean brother Bram
[1:19:38] set up a tree I can't because of how I
[1:19:40] was raised I just I don't feel like I
[1:19:41] can do it okay now what I did do I I did
[1:19:44] buy my daughter a real small Christmas
[1:19:46] tree it's real small I said there's your
[1:19:49] Christmas
[1:19:50] tree I can't do it for myself and she go
[1:19:52] goes makes you know she decorates a tree
[1:19:54] now to her I don't blame her for liking
[1:19:56] a Christmas tree cuz she wasn't raised
[1:19:58] the way I was raised exactly you know
[1:20:00] she's been rais in a good home by God's
[1:20:02] grace I ra a good home but I'm talking
[1:20:03] about a more holy home right that obeyed
[1:20:05] more the word of God but brother set up
[1:20:08] a tree I mean there's nothing wrong with
[1:20:09] that if you want to do that just don't
[1:20:11] worship the tree I mean
[1:20:13] yeah I I don't know anybody that
[1:20:15] worships a tree I know parents that lie
[1:20:18] and tell them about Santa Claus and
[1:20:19] reindeer I know parents that lie don't
[1:20:21] ever lie
[1:20:23] and then if you want a full sermon on it
[1:20:25] I preached that uh five years ago there
[1:20:26] sister Connie here
[1:20:28] brother still praying for brother Aon by
[1:20:31] God's grace I'm sure con's doing well
[1:20:33] she's always been a faithful
[1:20:36] saint but that that's the heart of the
[1:20:38] matter is that whatever you do to
[1:20:41] memorialize uh Christ's birth just just
[1:20:43] keep it holy I heard a preacher say this
[1:20:45] week why can't we remember it when when
[1:20:48] even angels came down to celebrate it
[1:20:52] Angels said think about it Hallelujah
[1:20:55] wise men traveled two years to rejoice
[1:20:57] in
[1:20:58] it right if they could rejoice in that
[1:21:02] if they can remember that why can't
[1:21:04] we that's a good point brother yeah I
[1:21:06] like
[1:21:08] that Hallelujah because Jesus is
[1:21:10] ultimately still getting all of our
[1:21:12] worship amen
[1:21:16] hallelujah now the verse I want to use
[1:21:18] just as as I get ready to finish up here
[1:21:20] I don't know how maybe half hour maybe
[1:21:22] we'll see how it goes she brought Mary
[1:21:24] brought forth her firstborn son and
[1:21:26] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:21:29] laid him in a Manger because there was
[1:21:31] no room for them in the end and the
[1:21:34] other night we watched it s sound did A
[1:21:35] Christmas one we watched that was about
[1:21:37] an hour and a half maybe maybe two hours
[1:21:40] maybe an hour and a half I
[1:21:41] think but that's what struck me you know
[1:21:44] uh the kind of the climax of of of the
[1:21:47] whole thing was when you know they went
[1:21:49] toh Bethlehem and they couldn't find any
[1:21:51] place and they had to go to the this
[1:21:52] dirty stinking M I'm sorry in
[1:21:57] no yeah not in it was just a barn kind
[1:22:00] like a barn yeah and there's these
[1:22:03] animals all over and the people were
[1:22:04] like oh you're going to go in there well
[1:22:06] there was no other
[1:22:07] choice nobody else would open up their
[1:22:09] place for the King of
[1:22:11] Kings yeah nobody else would make any
[1:22:15] room so he had to go to a place where
[1:22:17] there was brother said a dirty stinking
[1:22:20] stable but brother R types that that
[1:22:22] that stable to to your life God will
[1:22:25] come down in a dirty
[1:22:28] life but what he does he actually
[1:22:30] divorces our old
[1:22:32] life gets rid of all he comes in and
[1:22:33] sweeps it out like Matthew chapter 12
[1:22:36] Hallelujah he sweeps it all out and gets
[1:22:38] all that trash out and then he brings
[1:22:41] himself into there hallelujah it's a
[1:22:43] clean house and now it's got a a a
[1:22:45] husband to rule the house praise God
[1:22:47] Amen the strong man of Faith amen the
[1:22:50] Holy Ghost rules the house now amen all
[1:22:53] cleaned out but it's amazing grace he
[1:22:56] comes to a place that's dirty he comes
[1:22:59] to a place where he where he will be
[1:23:03] received now notice brother points out
[1:23:05] these two things I'm going to read this
[1:23:06] one more quote here notice how he's
[1:23:08] wrapped and then notice there's lack of
[1:23:11] room not enough room for Jesus think
[1:23:13] about that he they wouldn't make room
[1:23:16] for Christ that's the way it is today
[1:23:19] people can't accept speaking with
[1:23:20] tongues in their Church it would ruin
[1:23:21] their Creed
[1:23:23] and you know church here you can speak
[1:23:25] in tongues at the end of the service
[1:23:27] fact I'll say like this really you can
[1:23:28] speak in tongues anytime you want but if
[1:23:30] we're going to get mature with it you
[1:23:32] got to save it to the end that's how
[1:23:33] it's always been here we've never had
[1:23:35] anybody interrupt service with a tongue
[1:23:37] but let me tell you like this if the
[1:23:38] Holy Ghost is on you you can't contain
[1:23:40] it Let It Go yes we're mature enough to
[1:23:42] stop service pray we're mature enough
[1:23:45] and then get back to the preaching I
[1:23:47] think I don't think that would hinder
[1:23:48] our service I think that would help our
[1:23:49] service don't you wow Jesus here
[1:23:52] hallelujah amen we never had that
[1:23:56] trouble I should but then it wouldn't be
[1:23:58] trouble right it wouldn't mean it' be a
[1:24:01] blessing some Churches say no tongues it
[1:24:03] ruin their Creed they can't accept
[1:24:05] Divine Healing the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost and such great Evangelical
[1:24:08] doctrines of the Bible Apostolic truth
[1:24:10] why because their Creed condemns it oh
[1:24:13] how foolish to take the paper package is
[1:24:16] WRA in and throw the gift
[1:24:18] away so brother brings it down to like a
[1:24:21] gift
[1:24:23] Christ comes in and they they take the
[1:24:26] the the wrapping but they throw away the
[1:24:28] gift what's what's the gift the word of
[1:24:30] God Divine Healing speaking in tongues
[1:24:32] the gifts of the Holy Spirit the baptism
[1:24:34] of the Holy Ghost that's the real gift
[1:24:36] amen but they throw the gift away and
[1:24:39] just take the wrapping well I'm a
[1:24:41] Christian I go to
[1:24:43] church it's Christmas Merry Christmas
[1:24:45] now they say it without any real
[1:24:47] conviction in their
[1:24:49] hearts he said he said like the or
[1:24:52] the crazy man he took the box and
[1:24:54] accepted it and throw their gift away
[1:24:56] that's the way the churches people do
[1:24:58] today they forget that the gift of God
[1:24:59] is eternal life through Jesus Christ we
[1:25:01] just read that Romans 6:23 amen he's
[1:25:04] rejected as much today as he was then
[1:25:06] this Christmas night he's just as much
[1:25:08] rejected as he was the first Christmas
[1:25:10] night they cannot do it because it
[1:25:12] disagrees with their Creeds all down
[1:25:14] Through the Ages we've had the same
[1:25:16] thing
[1:25:17] Hallelujah Glory no wonder there was no
[1:25:20] room for him in the end
[1:25:22] no wasn't wrapped
[1:25:25] right it came wrapped with a woman who's
[1:25:28] pregnant just just a husband and wife
[1:25:30] with a pregnant wife saying oh I got a
[1:25:32] child of the Holy Ghost come on when has
[1:25:34] that ever happened never happened they
[1:25:37] didn't like how it was
[1:25:38] wrapped was wrapped in such humility oh
[1:25:42] born in a manger oh come
[1:25:44] on he said it wasn't wrapped it had the
[1:25:47] class the classical paper around it it
[1:25:49] was wrapped as a gift and the gift from
[1:25:51] God sent from God a God that they didn't
[1:25:54] know nothing
[1:25:55] about they thought they thought the
[1:25:57] Messiah would come through Caiaphas
[1:25:59] right or who of course he wasn't even a
[1:26:02] high priest at that time they thought it
[1:26:03] come through Herod or or one of the
[1:26:05] other high priests but it come through a
[1:26:07] common woman and man out of the house of
[1:26:11] David poor a poor
[1:26:13] carpenter yeah he was some big CEO like
[1:26:16] I know everything it wasn't Elon Musk of
[1:26:18] today we'd
[1:26:20] say he just a com Carpenter down there
[1:26:23] maybe he maybe he just a construction
[1:26:25] worker maybe he's just a landscaper
[1:26:27] brother could be maybe he's just a
[1:26:29] common school teacher they're Diamond
[1:26:31] dozen I tell my wife I'm just a diamond
[1:26:34] dozen we're just common people they
[1:26:37] don't like how it comes wrapped but it's
[1:26:40] foolish don't look at the rapping look
[1:26:41] at the gift inside hallelujah amen look
[1:26:45] at the word of God is packing
[1:26:48] Hallelujah they claimed they accepted it
[1:26:50] they claimed they was looking for him
[1:26:51] but we did not coming the way they was
[1:26:53] they thought he was coming according to
[1:26:54] their Creeds that they could not receive
[1:26:56] God's Gift he was wrapped different he
[1:26:58] was wrapped up like a baby he was born
[1:27:00] in a manger he come from poor people he
[1:27:02] come from a bunch of Fanatics so how
[1:27:04] could they receive something like that
[1:27:06] no wonder there was no room for him in
[1:27:07] the end he didn't come the way they
[1:27:10] expected him there's no room for him
[1:27:13] there's no there's no room for him yet
[1:27:15] in churches they OU him they don't
[1:27:17] believe it they'll say away with such a
[1:27:20] thing it's fanaticism we want nothing to
[1:27:22] do with it it's against our father's
[1:27:24] doctrines the doctrines of the church
[1:27:26] the doctrines of our Creeds and our
[1:27:27] forefathers therefore Christ is just as
[1:27:29] rejected today as he was back there
[1:27:32] there's no room tonight in our good
[1:27:34] churches or big churches or fine
[1:27:36] churches right like brother said I was
[1:27:38] listening when I preached there at
[1:27:39] Junction City brother R said serpent
[1:27:41] seed is the Killer and isn't that
[1:27:43] something that's like the very heart of
[1:27:44] the the birth of
[1:27:46] Jesus you had to be virgin born it just
[1:27:49] struck me W the real heart of the Virg
[1:27:52] of jesus' birth is the fact he was
[1:27:54] virgin
[1:27:55] born amen he didn't come by way of a
[1:27:57] seed line by through man instrumentality
[1:28:00] right right like Cain come through he
[1:28:03] was son of the serpent not Son Of Satan
[1:28:05] son of the serpent now spiritually he
[1:28:06] was a son of Satan but he wasn't the son
[1:28:08] of Satan in the natural he was the son
[1:28:10] of the serpent in the
[1:28:12] natural right so did Abel Abel came by
[1:28:14] male
[1:28:16] instrumentality Hallelujah but that's
[1:28:18] what it is church as soon as I brought
[1:28:20] up serpy with with my friends of the
[1:28:22] Chapel we're
[1:28:23] done said that's the
[1:28:26] killer it totally separates you as soon
[1:28:29] as you bring but it's in the Bible God
[1:28:30] said the serpent has a
[1:28:32] seed right the Bible said the fruit is
[1:28:35] the fruit of
[1:28:36] adultery she wipes her mouth and said
[1:28:38] I've done no wickedness it's a fruit
[1:28:40] adulter is a fruit of adultery right it
[1:28:43] starts as a sin but it produces the
[1:28:45] wrong
[1:28:46] fruit
[1:28:48] right but look at this there's no room
[1:28:51] in our religious circles today for a
[1:28:52] holy ghost
[1:28:54] meeting right we we we went to the
[1:28:56] Baptist Church a few times this year
[1:28:58] because a Baptist preacher invited me to
[1:28:59] preach at his church now we had some
[1:29:01] good services but do we have services
[1:29:02] like we had in
[1:29:03] Napoleon or some of our other services
[1:29:06] they're nice Services they're not quite
[1:29:08] the same you can't get I can tell some
[1:29:11] of them want the Holy Ghost in there the
[1:29:13] preacher come up and told me he said we
[1:29:15] want the Holy Ghost but we don't we
[1:29:17] don't we don't want to be tongues we
[1:29:19] know tongues aren't the evidence of the
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost right so that's why I still
[1:29:21] go back I feel L of God as long as you
[1:29:23] don't shut me down I'm going to keep
[1:29:24] preaching the truth
[1:29:25] there the people didn't realize with
[1:29:27] amen I preach the revelation of the
[1:29:30] baptism of the soul I preached the
[1:29:32] mystery of Christ Christ to them the
[1:29:34] hope of glory in their soul and they
[1:29:36] didn't even realize I preached the
[1:29:37] message to
[1:29:39] them they didn't
[1:29:41] realize hallelujah it's the hidden
[1:29:44] wisdom of God the hidden wisdom of God
[1:29:47] we speak it in a mystery hallelujah amen
[1:29:50] amen it's L right there before him
[1:29:54] that's why I brought out that those
[1:29:55] stickers right body I'm sorry Body
[1:29:58] Spirit soul I brought out these
[1:30:00] construction I might have right here
[1:30:01] actually I might use yeah I
[1:30:04] might I only got two what happened to my
[1:30:09] third that's too bad Malachi do right
[1:30:13] the Holy Ghost falls on your flesh you
[1:30:14] feel good but it's got to go deeper than
[1:30:16] that right amen then you get it in your
[1:30:18] mind praise God I got the holy ghost in
[1:30:20] my thoughts but then you start thinking
[1:30:21] about the wrong thing
[1:30:23] once you get it in here the seat of God
[1:30:25] it doesn't
[1:30:26] leave it's
[1:30:28] sealed to the day of your Redemption and
[1:30:30] that's the seed that cannot sin
[1:30:32] hallelujah amen that's right right I
[1:30:35] tried to show
[1:30:36] them see it's going to take a little
[1:30:38] longer Lord willing I hope these people
[1:30:40] I've always thought that brother Paul
[1:30:42] might come in the message I've always
[1:30:43] thought that I don't know I'm not God
[1:30:46] but I sure I'm going to keep preaching
[1:30:47] if he keeps inviting me if he feels led
[1:30:50] to have me I feel led to preach
[1:30:53] Hallelujah they don't want it it now
[1:30:55] look notice they don't want a holy ghost
[1:30:57] meeting because it belittles
[1:30:59] them in other words It embarrasses
[1:31:03] them church I don't care if God has to
[1:31:05] embarrass me however he wants me to act
[1:31:07] I just want to act how God wants me to
[1:31:08] act amen right I don't care I could care
[1:31:12] less what anybody says I want I I care
[1:31:15] what God thinks about
[1:31:17] me I think I proved that to you I danced
[1:31:19] around here enough this year I think I
[1:31:21] proved to I don't really care anybody
[1:31:23] things I want God to be pleased with my
[1:31:25] life
[1:31:26] amen hallelujah amen and this all goes
[1:31:29] back to christas right they didn't want
[1:31:31] the Holy Ghost they didn't want God in
[1:31:33] flesh yeah they didn't have room for
[1:31:35] that but there's room here this morning
[1:31:38] now afternoon there's room this
[1:31:41] afternoon for the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:31:43] that reminds of that song we'll make
[1:31:45] room for Jesus to do whatever he wants
[1:31:47] am what do you think about that
[1:31:49] song they don't want it embarrasses them
[1:31:53] in the sight of the classes of the
[1:31:55] country it belittles them to think that
[1:31:57] they have to Humble themselves and come
[1:31:59] down to the alter to cry to wait there
[1:32:01] until they're filled with power from on
[1:32:03] high amen that's I I've always respected
[1:32:06] sister who and brother amen and
[1:32:07] different ones Lydia that come down here

[1:32:37] God
[1:32:41] hallelujah he says to rise up from there
[1:32:44] with newness of light to let women let
[1:32:46] their hair grow out amen and act like
[1:32:50] women ought to act to make men throw
[1:32:52] their cigarettes away like me I used to
[1:32:54] smoke make me quit my drinking I used to
[1:32:57] drink treat their families right hope I
[1:32:59] treated Mal right and everybody
[1:33:01] Lydia it's too much for them so they
[1:33:03] hold on to their Creed their church
[1:33:05] instead of receiving God's Gift God's
[1:33:07] Christmas gift aren't you glad God's
[1:33:10] Christmas gift is here today and I'm not
[1:33:11] talking about orange construction
[1:33:13] paper God's Gift of the Holy Ghost is

[1:33:34] experience where you know the Holy Ghost
[1:33:36] fell on you and look afterwards look
[1:33:39] make sure you're a changed person after
[1:33:41] that that's the Simplicity of
[1:33:44] it that's the Simplicity maybe brother
[1:33:47] said you might scream you might shout
[1:33:49] you might cry you might dance you might
[1:33:50] speak in tongues
[1:33:52] he said you know I don't know what to do
[1:33:53] but something will happen when you get
[1:33:55] the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah
[1:33:58] something's going to happen in the Bible
[1:34:00] sometimes all they did was magnify God
[1:34:03] glory amen thank you Jesus I magnify you
[1:34:07] that's all they did they got the Holy
[1:34:09] Ghost amen hallelujah amen it's all they
[1:34:13] did that's God's Christmas gift to
[1:34:17] us that's the gift the Holy Ghost comes
[1:34:20] on you and you thank him for the gift
[1:34:22] Hallelujah you Thank The Giver for his
[1:34:24] gift
[1:34:28] Hallelujah and then it'll make you live
[1:34:31] right right hallelujah how many more I
[1:34:35] got okay I I told you before I'm not
[1:34:37] going to wor
[1:34:38] about not worry about preach they would
[1:34:42] rather have a Creed than they would a
[1:34:43] gift rather than the paper than the
[1:34:46] gift they want the paper sure something
[1:34:48] that's all tinsel a lot of fuss that
[1:34:50] they can do about it now here here this
[1:34:52] is what I found the
[1:34:53] message and I think this is why so many
[1:34:55] people which is okay are against trees
[1:34:57] or something like that now it's not okay
[1:34:59] to be against a tree but what what I'm
[1:35:01] saying so many people don't celebrate
[1:35:03] Christmas because they have so many
[1:35:05] people in their church this is my
[1:35:06] opinion pastors have so many people in
[1:35:08] their church that are clearly not born
[1:35:10] again but they'll take all that time to
[1:35:12] decorate a tree all the celebrations the
[1:35:15] eggnog and the
[1:35:19] tinsel uh what's those red berries
[1:35:23] poinsettas mistletoe that's what it is I
[1:35:26] mean I don't blame some of those pastors
[1:35:29] if I saw you all doing that I'd blast it
[1:35:31] too you
[1:35:32] know I don't know come over your house
[1:35:34] very much but you saw in my house you
[1:35:37] might be

[1:35:44] they see people that just sit there the
[1:35:45] whole time when is he going to get over
[1:35:48] and yet they get excited about Christmas
[1:35:49] trees yeah I think God would blast it
[1:35:51] too MH right the church said amen
[1:35:54] because they're they're they're
[1:35:55] rejoicing in the tentel instead of the
[1:35:57] Holy Ghost praise instead of worshiping
[1:36:00] God praying
[1:36:03] amen you guys are see compromised and
[1:36:06] they rejoice in the tel but they fail to
[1:36:08] get the real Christmas gift the Holy
[1:36:10] Ghost amen or like a lot of these
[1:36:12] compromisers once the children get own
[1:36:14] up they'll skip church on Sunday to go
[1:36:16] to the soccer game what a bunch of
[1:36:18] nonsense that's accepting the tel and of

[1:36:49] much energy for tree and presence and
[1:36:52] you can't come up to the Altar and pray
[1:36:54] right amen and and these are the same
[1:36:56] people that complain about marriage

[1:56:35] grer I used anyway I don't want to take
[1:56:39] the up it take tell the story but God
[1:56:43] told me and Carol both that we would not
[1:56:47] pay a scent of that bill and and uh
[1:56:51] so anyway between the helicopter ride
[1:56:55] and the hospital bill I think it
[1:56:57] was what
[1:57:00] 160,000 and uh we were trusting in God
[1:57:03] totally for didn't have insurance and uh
[1:57:08] and
[1:57:12] so people gave I mean just God just
[1:57:16] moved people and I think we received
[1:57:19] what was it
[1:57:22] 9,000 right at
[1:57:24] $9,000 and the bills started coming in
[1:57:27] and
[1:57:29] U of
[1:57:32] course uh they told us they would do a
[1:57:35] like a self-pay discount thing and I
[1:57:39] filled out a a a thing that they said
[1:57:42] well we're below poverty level I guess
[1:57:44] for them so they said well they'll
[1:57:46] they'll give us a a p cut or whatever
[1:57:49] and uh but it looked pretty you know it
[1:57:53] looked absolutely impossible but uh I
[1:57:57] just to make a really long story short
[1:57:59] the other day I would call every and say
[1:58:03] you know when is this bill last bill
[1:58:05] coming because I I want to
[1:58:07] know and uh so from March till the other
[1:58:11] day finally they sent the last bill and
[1:58:14] they sent the thing that had all the
[1:58:16] bills together at what we were supposed
[1:58:18] to
[1:58:20] and we had paid
[1:58:23] $683 earlier in the in May or some
[1:58:27] time and uh then my brother advised me
[1:58:31] to wait till I received all the
[1:58:33] bills and so I did and so they send
[1:58:36] another thing of um was
[1:58:41] it anyway the the total bill all
[1:58:44] together we paid right at
[1:58:46] $7,500 I mean I Just Want To Praise God
[1:58:49] because not only did he I
[1:58:52] mean our church was going to was waiting
[1:58:55] till we received the bill because they
[1:58:57] wanted to help and uh they didn't even
[1:59:01] need to because we had more than enough
[1:59:04] and I just I just I can't keep quiet
[1:59:06] about that and I just want to praise God
[1:59:09] and
[1:59:11] there's I mean there's if there ever was
[1:59:14] a question in my mind if there was a God
[1:59:16] that cared you know and I now for a new
[1:59:20] hand I mean I I you know people look at
[1:59:24] me and think I'm crazy I mean I probably
[1:59:27] am to almost run death I just I praise
[1:59:31] God it healed I mean healed good she
[1:59:33] she's not really even handicapped but
[1:59:36] she does only have that one finger on
[1:59:38] that hand and it says all things are
[1:59:42] possible to down that belief and I mean
[1:59:45] I haven't read if that excludes the four
[1:59:49] F that she doesn't have so I don't think
[1:59:51] that this I think anyway I just want to
[1:59:54] praise God and I want to thank him for
[1:59:55] healing that hand and thank him for for
[1:59:59] the hand I mean it was his from the
[2:00:02] start so that
