[37:31] need this morning before we get into the
[37:33] word though I just do want to say thank
[37:35] you brother Jesse for having us we've
[37:37] kind of been trying to get this data
[37:39] range since I probably November of last
[37:40] year and it finally worked out we had a
[37:43] reschedule and a dent in a family back
[37:45] in February my wife's grandfather passed
[37:48] and then so we rescheduled but we're
[37:50] here we're glad to be here with you we
[37:51] just trusted something to be said that
[37:53] would encourage you this morning
[37:54] if I can get a little bit more volume up
[37:57] here that'd be great and
[37:58] it's good to be back with many of you
[37:59] some of you I know many of you I don't
[38:01] know but it's it's great to see everyone
[38:03] and familiar faces and some that are not
[38:06] so familiar but trusting that through
[38:08] the course of our day and the fellowship
[38:10] in the word this morning we realize that
[38:12] we come from eternity we're going back
[38:14] to the attorney a man if you have your
[38:18] Bibles this morning let's take a take
[38:20] our bow gonna turn to John 14 I want to
[38:23] speak to you I got two thoughts this
[38:25] morning or actually one for this morning
[38:27] one for this evening I want to speak to
[38:29] you on faith that will speak this
[38:31] morning then we're going to turn around
[38:32] this evening by God's grace and we will
[38:35] speak time for you to speak so just
[38:38] trusting something to be said that will
[38:39] encourage you something that will edify
[38:42] you and remember the prophet of God said
[38:45] if you want something out of this
[38:46] service you got to do the puller you got
[38:49] to do you got to expect God you got to
[38:51] ask God you got a you got to get from
[38:53] what you have need of you got to pull it
[38:54] out of the ministry today and so I'm
[38:56] counting on you to pull on the gift of
[38:59] God and I tell you every time I've been
[39:02] in a service and I've seen God move and
[39:05] the people beginning really gonna have
[39:07] that anointing begin to pull God it
[39:09] pulls God right to your need and got a
[39:11] minister to your knee and you'll not go
[39:13] out of here disappointed but well we
[39:16] want to take our time this morning our
[39:17] brother give us our liberty and we just
[39:19] want to take our time to say some things
[39:21] that when encouraging we find here in
[39:23] John 14 and verse 12 the scripture says
[39:26] verily verily I say unto you he that
[39:28] believeth on me and the works that I do
[39:30] shall he do also and greater works than
[39:33] these shall he do because I go into the
[39:34] Father and whatsoever you ask in my name
[39:37] that will I do that their father may be
[39:40] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[39:42] in my name I will do it I want you to
[39:47] key in on that if you ask anything in my
[39:49] name I will do it now if your Bible
[39:54] reads like mine that's read letters
[39:56] that's not a man's interpretation of the
[39:59] word that's God Almighty as Jesus Christ
[40:01] telling you that if you ask anything in
[40:03] his name he will do it let's look here
[40:07] in first John 5 and verse 14
[40:12] first John five and verse 14 and this is
[40:17] the confidence that we have in him that
[40:19] if we ask anything according to his will
[40:22] he heareth us and we know that he hears
[40:26] us whatsoever we ask we know that we had
[40:30] the petitions that we desired of him so
[40:34] if we ask anything according to his will
[40:36] he heareth us and we know that he hears
[40:40] us so whatsoever we ask we know that we
[40:43] had the petitions that we desired of him
[40:45] father we just bow our heads to you this
[40:48] morning Lord we want to say thank you
[40:49] for the opportunity to be here to be a
[40:52] symbol with of the believers Lord those
[40:55] of like precious faith father has been
[40:58] many years since we've been here we've
[40:59] seen the growth of the church and we're
[41:01] grateful and thankful father for what
[41:03] you're doing that you have a bride
[41:05] called right here in Akron Ohio we're
[41:07] asking Lord you come by our way and
[41:09] you'd begin to some ministry to us speak
[41:11] to us Lord encourages Lord we just give
[41:13] ourselves to you this morning
[41:15] we asked Lord not only that you'll bless
[41:17] to speak another word but you'll also
[41:18] bless the hearing of the word father may
[41:21] it just be a two-fold purpose Lord that
[41:23] of giving and that of receiving when you
[41:26] give strength to the body Lord strength
[41:28] to the local congregation and we just
[41:30] pray O God that you'll have preeminence
[41:32] in our hearts and have preeminence in
[41:33] this service this morning we've just
[41:35] committed to you now in Jesus name amen
[41:38] you can be seated this morning I'm gonna
[41:41] have to have just a little bit more
[41:42] volume brother Jesse I want to take you
[41:46] to another scripture here in 1st Peter 1
[41:49] and verse 6 because there speaking on
[41:53] faith this morning faith that will speak
[41:56] we find here in 1st Peter 1:6 says
[41:59] wherein you greatly rejoice though now
[42:04] for a season if need be you're in
[42:06] heaviness through manifold temptations
[42:09] that's a trial of your faith being much
[42:12] more precious than gold that perishes
[42:14] though it be tried with fire might be
[42:16] fell into the praise and honor and the
[42:19] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[42:21] so we notice here that our faith it goes
[42:25] to a try
[42:26] or goes to a season of tests now how
[42:28] many of you love tests I mean not a hand
[42:34] was raised not even you young kids I
[42:37] don't like tests either do you I hated
[42:39] tests in school we don't like tests but
[42:41] we found through the course of the
[42:43] scripture that is the test is not a test
[42:46] of who you are but it's a test of your
[42:48] faith it's a test of what you claim to
[42:51] believe and we love so look in the book
[42:53] of James the Bible tells us in James 1
[42:55] in verse 2 my brother counting all joy
[42:58] when you fall into divers temptations
[43:01] now there's now so here this morning
[43:03] they goes and coming to church know best
[43:05] to be the name I'm in a trial this
[43:06] morning oh praise God I'm being tested
[43:08] for the glory of God none of you walk in
[43:10] like I know you walk in with the Eeyore
[43:12] complex
[43:13] nobody gives around a bad day and you
[43:17] know you won't everybody feel sorry for
[43:18] you
[43:19] come on human nature is that is how it
[43:22] is but we find here that in book of
[43:24] James says now I brought my brother
[43:26] counting all joy when you fall into
[43:28] divers temptations knowing this that the
[43:31] trying of your faith work is patience
[43:33] that word patience there's Hoopa mone it
[43:36] is - patience that when you're under
[43:38] heavy load you're not trying to get out
[43:39] of it it's not like sitting at the
[43:41] doctor's office and you're patiently
[43:43] waiting like some of you right here are
[43:44] just patiently waiting like okay great
[43:47] no but this is like somebody who's under
[43:49] a heavy load and he's enduring the load
[43:51] he's and he's not trying to get out from
[43:53] underneath it because he knows he's been
[43:55] tasked with that job he's been given a
[43:58] responsibility and he's not trying to
[44:00] shut the responsibility but he's trying
[44:02] to do all that he can because he's wrong
[44:04] because he is being tested his faith is
[44:06] being tested and the Bible says let
[44:08] patience have her perfect work that you
[44:11] may be entire morning nothing let me
[44:14] tell you Church that's what we want in
[44:15] this hour we don't want to be lacking
[44:17] one thing but he called for a bride to
[44:19] come home we want to be perfect it
[44:22] wasn't going to take to me perfect it's
[44:23] going to take your faith to be tried by
[44:26] the test in the trials that we go
[44:27] through let's not sugarcoat it way this
[44:31] is not a flowery man of ease you will
[44:33] never know your true strength until
[44:36] you've been forced put to the test
[44:38] you'll never know how much fate you
[44:40] really have unless your faith has been
[44:42] put to the fire and when you've been put
[44:44] to the fire everything they sound like
[44:46] God begins to melt away all the just
[44:49] begins to melt away all the impurities
[44:51] begin to fall away you become more like
[44:54] God but it takes the testing and the
[44:58] trying of our faith to bring us to that
[45:00] position and the bring us into that
[45:02] condition not wonder many times I wonder
[45:06] I want to do we fail to realize as a
[45:09] bride of Christ or is it believed do we
[45:11] fail to realize the fate that we have
[45:14] and I believe do they have we can
[45:16] recognize who we are it had faith in who
[45:19] we are then there would be nothing to
[45:20] stand before you
[45:22] you would weather every storm you
[45:24] wouldn't come in dragony church you'd
[45:26] come in rhetoric because your faith is
[45:28] being tested and you know because it's
[45:30] being a test I think God has something
[45:32] in store he's got something greater at
[45:34] the end you better come out more perfect
[45:37] more precious than gold so as I was
[45:43] beginning to study this I'll begin to
[45:45] think why is our faith being tested we
[45:49] can find the answer in the church
[45:51] Facebook we look here in the church age
[45:54] book brother Branham says now remember
[45:56] this that Christ in the true church is a
[45:59] continuation of the book of Acts how
[46:00] many of you believe that that Christ in
[46:03] the true church is a continuation not a
[46:06] period but a comma the same things a gun
[46:09] is the same things we do today well
[46:11] brother tell that was 2000 years ago I
[46:13] don't care how long ago was the same
[46:16] works that they did is the same work so
[46:18] we're to continue but the book of
[46:22] Revelation shows how they Antichrist
[46:25] spirit we're coming to the church and
[46:27] defile it make it lukewarm formal and
[46:30] powerless look at what they had on
[46:32] Christ Buddhist trying to do he's trying
[46:34] to get to true church to become lukewarm
[46:37] well you don't care you're not on fire
[46:39] for God you don't read your Bible you're
[46:40] not praying you're not having that time
[46:42] alone with the God with the Lord and
[46:44] making it formal when we come in and we
[46:46] come in we had a noose there's so much
[46:48] formality and we're we're afraid to let
[46:50] our hair down
[46:51] afraid to get in the anointing we're
[46:52] afraid because somebody may look around
[46:54] somebody may walk through the door
[46:56] who cares what anybody else thinks this
[47:00] is your time alone with God this is your
[47:02] time to get your knees man if it takes
[47:04] let your hair down if it takes carnage
[47:06] snug whatever it is it doesn't matter I
[47:08] got a need a good - Jesus Christ
[47:12] anyone relation to church powerless let
[47:15] me tell you we don't need a powerless
[47:17] religion I'm irritated we don't have a
[47:20] powerless religion we got a church this
[47:22] old fire God now the Book of Revelations
[47:27] here he says now it exposes Satan
[47:29] revealing his works now notice his works
[47:32] his attentive destruction of God's
[47:34] people
[47:35] how does he attempt to destroy you by
[47:38] tacking your faith because if he can
[47:41] destroy your faith then he weakens you
[47:44] and if he weak is you you will not fight
[47:46] him back so he's attempt to destroy
[47:50] God's people and the discrediting of
[47:53] God's Word now have we seen an attack on
[47:56] the word today we've seen one after the
[47:59] other has it ever come up rise up after
[48:01] many years walk away from what we call
[48:03] the message of the hour and begin to
[48:05] crucify and begin to make accusations
[48:07] against the messenger just dismiss it
[48:10] let me tell you I know what this
[48:12] measures can produce I know what I used
[48:15] to be I love them desires and I used to
[48:17] have I used to drink
[48:19] I used to woman eyes eyes you all those
[48:21] terrible things and party when I came in
[48:23] with this word with this much I'm no
[48:26] liar the things that introduces brothers
[48:31] they change my life with a law of God in
[48:33] its heart the problem is that there's
[48:39] the attack on the peel the word is
[48:41] because they've never had an experience
[48:42] with the word says they're right down to
[48:49] the time that he is cast into the lake
[48:52] of fire he fights that he cannot stand
[48:55] it I want you to notice this is where it
[49:00] gets good yeah saw they thank you
[49:04] he's noted he says he knows referring to
[49:07] sake can I get a little bit more volume
[49:09] I don't know what's going on with my
[49:10] throat where's the monitor system
[49:13] monitor here are you there back there
[49:16] I'm talking out the speakers okay that's
[49:20] fine all right he knows referring to
[49:22] Satan he knows that it took people get a
[49:25] true revelation of the true church
[49:28] listen to him come on stay with me this
[49:31] morning he knows it too people get a
[49:33] true revelation of the true church and
[49:36] what she is
[49:38] where is she bone of his bone flesh of
[49:41] his first power of his power
[49:43] part of his learned she is him and say
[49:48] nose out about you this morning and what
[49:51] she stands for one is his bride stand
[49:53] for she stands for truth she stands for
[49:56] righteousness she stands for holiness
[49:58] she says for purity
[49:59] she stands for modesty she says for
[50:02] everything that is godly that's what she
[50:05] stands for and Satan knows that about
[50:08] you this morning and he knows it all so
[50:11] that she can do the greater works he
[50:14] said that she will be an invincible army
[50:17] so let me just bring this back in he
[50:20] says now Satan knows and put it in Satan
[50:22] knows because he's referring to he knows
[50:23] say knows that if two people get a true
[50:26] revelation the people right here the
[50:29] people this morning get a true
[50:31] revelation of the true church and what
[50:33] she is and what she stands for and then
[50:37] she can do the greater works he says
[50:39] that she will be an invincible warming
[50:41] that weren't invisible there means too
[50:43] powerful to be defeated come on somebody
[50:47] I'm talking about you this morning
[50:48] you're too powerful to be defeated this
[50:51] morning and Satan knows that about you
[50:55] see if they get a true revelation of the
[50:57] true spirits within the framework of the
[50:59] Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[51:02] desert and with sin Antichrist spirit
[51:04] Satan will be powerless how many you owe
[51:08] Satan to be powerless this morning they
[51:10] say God give me a true revelation of the
[51:13] two spirits within the framework of the
[51:15] Christian Church and help me by your
[51:17] grace
[51:17] discerner withstand antichrist spirit he
[51:22] will be definitely thwarted today as
[51:24] when Christ would suit his every effort
[51:26] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[51:28] Satan hates revelation but we love it
[51:30] with true revelation in our lives the
[51:33] gates of Hell cannot prevail against us
[51:36] but we come on somebody but we shall
[51:39] prevail over them I know what you're
[51:43] going through this morning but it
[51:44] doesn't matter because we shall prevail
[51:46] over them this morning so we find that
[51:50] our whole Christian experience hinges on
[51:52] faith the Bible says that we're saved by
[51:55] grace but it's through faith and we know
[51:58] that che knows this about you he knows
[52:00] the power that you possess
[52:01] he knows the position that you possess
[52:03] the problem is I'm afraid many times as
[52:05] a believer we fail to understand the
[52:07] power that we have the authority that we
[52:10] have the position that we have God's
[52:12] called you for a holy position has
[52:14] placed you in his power has placed you
[52:16] in his family and there's no general
[52:18] hope is that before you if you can only
[52:20] recognize who you are in this hour so he
[52:24] knows these things about you therefore
[52:28] he attacks your faith that's why your
[52:31] faith is under attack that's why you're
[52:33] going through manifold temptations and
[52:35] trials in situations but if the believer
[52:38] can ever recognize the faith that they
[52:41] have but what the faith that they
[52:43] possess then there'd be no devil of Hell
[52:46] can stand before that believer I don't
[52:49] care if it's cancer I don't care if it's
[52:51] heart trouble
[52:52] I don't you put a name that you put a
[52:54] torment spirit oh it can't stand before
[52:56] that name and if you can discern it
[53:01] withstand Antichrist Satan will be
[53:03] powerless you will be all-powerful he
[53:06] will be defeated you'd be undefeated
[53:08] you'd be triumphant but she attacks her
[53:13] faith he tries to weaken our faith
[53:14] because he knows if he can weaken your
[53:16] faith you have no leg to stand on
[53:18] because you're then you're trembling
[53:20] you're fearful and many times we think
[53:24] we gotta have gigantic faith how many
[53:26] you realize you many times you say well
[53:28] if I had faith like so-and-so
[53:31] faith like brother John Graham fact
[53:33] faith like brother Jessie if I had faith
[53:35] like this brother of that brother if I
[53:37] had faith like brother Branham
[53:38] oh man for a wicked we could create
[53:41] squirrels but the Bible says here in
[53:44] Matthew 13 the kingdom of heaven is like
[53:48] a grain of a mustard seed and brother
[53:50] Jessie I took the liberty to bring some
[53:52] mustard seed out of your office you see
[53:55] that can y'all see that seed right there
[53:58] that's me you kicked my finger was over
[54:01] what do y'all talking about y'all
[54:03] couldn't see that seat I get that line
[54:04] spirit out of here first let me shake it
[54:08] up look at that seed right there you'll
[54:11] see that seed you can't see from the
[54:14] back can you brother John but it's there
[54:17] and sometimes it's like your faith you
[54:19] can't see it but it's there so we find
[54:23] here the Bible says that the kingdom of
[54:24] heaven is like a grain of a mustard seed
[54:26] I took one of these little seeds out
[54:28] this morning I put it on my finger and I
[54:30] snapped a picture up and I said to my
[54:32] wife I said inside of that seed right
[54:34] there is enough power to move mountains
[54:36] if you can only recognize inside of that
[54:39] scene you don't take gigantic faith it
[54:42] takes just a little bit of faith the
[54:43] size of a mustard seed and if you can
[54:46] recognize that particular this morning
[54:47] let me tell you all heavens will move
[54:49] back o demons will move back o torment
[54:52] spirits will move back
[54:53] but that's why are you recognize that it
[54:55] would then me is the faith of the God
[54:57] just a little bit of see little bit of
[55:00] faith this morning can move mountains
[55:02] what about your situation what about
[55:04] what you're going through this morning
[55:06] [Music]
[55:07] see it doesn't take gigantic faith but
[55:11] just a little bit seed right here you
[55:13] plant that seed in the Reich
[55:14] anti-environment you begin to water that
[55:17] CD you're gonna put the right mental
[55:19] sunlight on that see what happens to
[55:21] that seed suddenly begins to crack that
[55:23] outer shell begins to crack but inside
[55:25] of that seed is life and life begins to
[55:28] wiggle up out of the ground it begins to
[55:30] excuse me rise up he grows into a 12 to
[55:34] 15 foot tree inside of that little bitty
[55:37] seed
[55:39] and fowls of the air will come alive in
[55:42] its branches so many times we think we
[55:47] got to have gigantic faith we don't need
[55:49] y'all gettin faith what we need is to
[55:51] plant the faith when we got in this
[55:53] field of God's Word plant the faith that
[55:57] you have in the field of God's Word
[56:01] don't come back there so they digging it
[56:03] up no plant they're expecting that seed
[56:06] to produce life it's not going to lay
[56:08] dormant no it's going to produce life if
[56:11] you plant it with faith believing that
[56:13] whatsoever you ask in his name I will do
[56:16] it so there's been times we've sold
[56:21] seeds of doubt we've sold seeds of
[56:24] unbelief but it's time that we start
[56:27] sowing seeds of faith faith that this
[56:29] word is perfect faith that this message
[56:31] is perfect faith for total healing faith
[56:34] for total deliverance faith for a body
[56:36] change faith for our wedding supper
[56:38] faith for a obtains how do we start
[56:40] tolling those kind of seeds Matthew 17
[56:46] and verse 20 says now if you have faith
[56:49] as a grain of a mustard seed just a
[56:53] little bit of mustard seed you shall say
[56:54] unto this mountain removed to a yonder
[56:57] place and it shall remove and nothing
[57:00] shall be impossible unto you Luke 17 and
[57:05] verse 6 if you had faith ever grain as a
[57:08] mustard seed you might say unto the sick
[57:10] of my tree be thou plucked up by the
[57:13] root and be thou planted in the sea and
[57:15] it should obey you so we find there's a
[57:18] common theme here if you have faith of a
[57:22] grain of a mustard seed you can speak to
[57:25] a mountain and it's got to move you can
[57:28] speak to a tree as Adam did in the
[57:31] beginning and say be plucked up and be
[57:33] planted over here and the Bible says in
[57:36] mark 9:23 jesus said unto him if thou
[57:39] canst believe or otherwise have faith
[57:41] then all things are possible to him that
[57:44] believeth I'm trying to get it something
[57:47] to you this morning faith that will
[57:49] speak it's time that we have faith too
[57:53] speak things to come in the things that
[57:55] you have needed of Istanbul we ask God
[57:57] and not only ask but expect God to
[57:59] minister and expect God to move and look
[58:03] at the days of God not moving and
[58:05] responding their days go by I'm telling
[58:07] you today God is just as real today as
[58:09] it was 2,000 years ago when he opened
[58:11] the blind I was there he's here this
[58:13] morning and he's really open up blinded
[58:15] eyes ain't Kongsberg and let you come
[58:17] into a greater revelation of who you are
[58:20] in this hour but the Bible says all
[58:23] things are possible to him that
[58:25] believeth and we found here again that
[58:29] we look back into in Matthew 17 and
[58:31] nothing shall be impossible so if you
[58:33] got faith this morning nothing is
[58:35] impossible and all things are possible
[58:38] so what does that tell you is what I
[58:39] tell you that the devil don't have a leg
[58:41] to stand on
[58:42] he's trying to come to your brother you
[58:44] out of it he's trying to taint you're
[58:45] not gonna be who you say you are let me
[58:47] to tell you all things are possible if
[58:49] you can believe this morning and nothing
[58:52] shall be impossible they says hearing
[58:56] the messages they shall be even as it
[58:57] was told me says maybe you might not
[58:59] have spontaneous faith to bring
[59:01] something just a miracle right to you
[59:03] you may not have that kind of faith but
[59:06] jesus said if you had to faith like a
[59:07] mustard seed I'm trying to get something
[59:10] over to you don't take a lot of faith
[59:12] it just takes cheap on faith but if you
[59:15] had a faith the size of a mustard seed
[59:17] you could say to this mountain be mood
[59:20] and by and by it would come to pass it
[59:22] would vanish it away but by and by it
[59:25] would come to pass see the mustard seed
[59:28] he goes you can make scale you can make
[59:31] spinach you can breed it together but
[59:33] you can't mix mustard nothing with it
[59:35] won't mix it's just mustard to be
[59:37] mustard and that's the kind of faith
[59:39] that we need in this hour
[59:40] not a Pentecostal faith it's gonna mix
[59:42] with the world not a presbyterian faith
[59:44] is going to mix with the doctors
[59:46] increase of the world but we need that
[59:47] that's supernatural Holy Ghost feel hey
[59:50] there refuses to mix with the world
[59:52] we're not putting on clothes that
[59:53] pertain to a man or to a woman we're not
[59:56] wearing makeup we're not turning our
[59:58] hair
[59:58] we're not dressing in a way we're not
[59:59] acting the way no we're become the
[1:00:01] living vessels are living
[1:00:02] this hour how do you do that by adorning
[1:00:05] yourself with faith faith gotta believe
[1:00:07] the word and it may not be spontaneous
[1:00:12] but nevertheless if it's the size of a
[1:00:14] mustard seed it will come to pass
[1:00:19] because if you got just the least little
[1:00:22] grain of faith that's genuine mustard
[1:00:27] seed o kick catch a hold of that genuine
[1:00:29] not mixed with doubt now it mixed with
[1:00:32] unbelief not based on what somebody else
[1:00:33] do out I can't believe because so I'm so
[1:00:35] trusting God and she went by the way in
[1:00:37] the grave well you know what that's not
[1:00:39] mixing we're not talking about that but
[1:00:41] on by a supernatural genuine faith he
[1:00:44] goes if you can just get a little grain
[1:00:45] of faith
[1:00:46] that's genuine mustard seed faith that
[1:00:48] won't move stay with it it will bring
[1:00:50] you out come on somebody are you ready
[1:00:55] to come out at trial that you've been
[1:00:56] here are you ready to come get delivered
[1:00:58] and get the victory that you've been
[1:00:59] longing for just stay with it produce
[1:01:02] that kind of faith
[1:01:03] Ginuwine mustard seed bait this morning
[1:01:07] he says now some people have faith like
[1:01:10] this some people have that must face
[1:01:12] some people has that much faith and some
[1:01:14] people have faith you know plumb over
[1:01:15] the heads into miracles he says but
[1:01:17] because you haven't got that much that
[1:01:19] doesn't mean that you can be healed if
[1:01:22] you had the least let up now won't you
[1:01:24] listens at least a little bit of faith
[1:01:26] just stay right with it he goes it'll
[1:01:29] take you out will you believe that he
[1:01:31] goes that's the truth God will make me
[1:01:33] answer for it if I haven't told you the
[1:01:35] truth did you hear that I'm gonna say it
[1:01:39] again he goes just because you haven't
[1:01:42] got that much that doesn't mean that you
[1:01:44] can't be healed if you had just a least
[1:01:46] little bit of faith just stay right with
[1:01:50] it it'll take you out will you believe
[1:01:52] that that's the true God will make me
[1:01:55] answer for it if I haven't told you the
[1:01:58] truth sohal it takes
[1:02:03] there's thirty five in here I pulled one
[1:02:06] out stuck it on my finger take a picture
[1:02:09] of it rolled off my finger on my Bible
[1:02:11] on the floor and I can't find it
[1:02:13] I still hadn't been I was in there for
[1:02:16] 15 minutes looking for this little seed
[1:02:18] of faith you say bro Jill why don't you
[1:02:22] say that because don't lose your little
[1:02:23] seed because sometimes it's harder to
[1:02:27] regain to find than it is to have it
[1:02:29] initially oh I had it right here in the
[1:02:31] little bag but you know I got a little
[1:02:32] bit bold and pulled it out stuck it on
[1:02:34] my finger gonna do some cute send it to
[1:02:36] my wife so real just hello you a little
[1:02:38] seed I promise you is back to on the
[1:02:41] ground somewhere but maybe be planted
[1:02:43] and rise up to a great great tree of
[1:02:46] faith but if the Bible says now if
[1:02:50] notice if you have faith if so this word
[1:02:56] implies a little bit of uncertainty many
[1:02:59] people have religion but they don't have
[1:03:01] faith many people have a Creed but they
[1:03:04] don't have faith many people have an
[1:03:06] imagination they believe that you're
[1:03:08] healed or delivered or whatever maybe
[1:03:09] but they don't have faith many people
[1:03:11] have hope but they don't have faith see
[1:03:14] faith begins when you put your belief in
[1:03:17] action let me say that again faith
[1:03:20] begins when you put your belief into
[1:03:23] action when God puts you somewhere
[1:03:25] should've complained about it in this
[1:03:27] that another know you begin to react or
[1:03:29] to act upon it and that proves that you
[1:03:31] have faith in where God has you tell me
[1:03:35] have you here just little bitty Church
[1:03:36] for a purpose for a season but don't
[1:03:38] complain because there's not more coming
[1:03:40] in sees more going out versus coming in
[1:03:41] but God has you here for a purpose put
[1:03:43] your faith in action go out and tell
[1:03:46] everybody about it there's a message
[1:03:47] Church there's somebody preaches the
[1:03:49] gospel truth and bring them in and bring
[1:03:51] them in put your faith into action that
[1:03:53] you know that you're here for a purpose
[1:03:54] that God's planted you here and it's
[1:03:56] time that you grow where you've been
[1:03:58] playing it but see the question isn't
[1:04:02] today how many things we believe but is
[1:04:04] how genuine is the faith that we have in
[1:04:06] the things that we do believe is your
[1:04:09] faith unshakable is your faith unmovable
[1:04:13] that's the question that you need to
[1:04:15] answer within yourself today is my faith
[1:04:17] unshakable it's my faith unmovable
[1:04:21] ro-bear makes a statement now in the
[1:04:23] second miracle he says some people have
[1:04:24] great big faith like this anything can
[1:04:27] happen
[1:04:27] you know what I'm jealous of those
[1:04:29] people I don't have that kind of face my
[1:04:33] wife's used to say you got booted off
[1:04:34] faith I may have Bulldog favor boo doll
[1:04:36] faces just must receive faint refusing
[1:04:38] to let go of it I just stay with it but
[1:04:41] you got some of those that have they
[1:04:42] have just gigantic faith or great big
[1:04:44] faith and all some miracles take place
[1:04:47] but it doesn't mean that I'm any less of
[1:04:50] a Christian I'm any less of a believer I
[1:04:51] mean unless part of the body of God then
[1:04:53] they are see the next has faith bill
[1:04:56] them say this deep a little bit deeper
[1:04:58] next has faith this he takes quite a
[1:05:00] little while he says some had paint like
[1:05:02] a mustard seed but if it's a mustard
[1:05:04] seed fade genuine faith hold on to it
[1:05:07] just keep believing in a become marvel
[1:05:09] faith in it become grapefruit faith then
[1:05:11] it become a mountain Bey it'll bring you
[1:05:13] right out if you just stay with a hold
[1:05:15] on he'll bring you right straight to the
[1:05:17] line if you'll stay with it he says but
[1:05:19] don't get discouraged and don't believe
[1:05:22] the symptoms he said the symptoms are
[1:05:24] the devil's lies but I'm not seeing
[1:05:27] anything happen it doesn't matter what
[1:05:29] you see your experience today ain't
[1:05:31] based on what you see it's based on the
[1:05:33] Word of God and the Word of God is shame
[1:05:36] amen to the believer it is just say the
[1:05:39] Lord to the believer in will you get
[1:05:40] funded in the worst stay with it we look
[1:05:45] here in Hebrews 11 and verse 1 the Bible
[1:05:47] says that faith is the substance of
[1:05:49] things so forth so we got to have an
[1:05:51] understanding or what faith is so faith
[1:05:54] is the substance of things hoped for and
[1:05:56] the evidence of things not seen that
[1:05:58] we're subdomain means actual existence
[1:06:01] so it is the actual existence it's the
[1:06:04] steadfastness of mind it's a firmness
[1:06:06] it's the courage it's a resolution it's
[1:06:08] confidence it's a firm trust
[1:06:10] it's the assurance so faith is the
[1:06:14] assurance it's the actual existence for
[1:06:17] brother till I don't feel like it when
[1:06:19] you don't have faith because your faith
[1:06:21] ain't based on your feeling your faith
[1:06:23] is based on what the word says it ain't
[1:06:25] based on how you feel about a name based
[1:06:27] on what you're seeing it makes you want
[1:06:28] you heal it you're hearing you're
[1:06:29] smelling and all that all those things
[1:06:31] can lie to you but it's based on the
[1:06:33] Word of God and the Bible says that the
[1:06:37] evidence of things not seen that word
[1:06:38] evidence there is proof
[1:06:41] it's the proof of things not seen that's
[1:06:44] why Abraham could call those things that
[1:06:46] are not as though they were because he
[1:06:47] had faith in a God who he's never seen
[1:06:49] Oh church we've seen signs and wonders
[1:06:54] there's no reason for us not to believe
[1:06:56] in this our Abraham didn't have those
[1:06:59] signs and those wonders but abraham
[1:07:01] believed nevertheless what about us this
[1:07:03] morning will you believe the Word of God
[1:07:05] for your hour so we got a look at faith
[1:07:09] here and I want to bring this story down
[1:07:10] brother Browns little with this young
[1:07:12] girl this is 1947 faith is a substance
[1:07:15] this young girl he's getting to show her
[1:07:17] now that she didn't have faith maybe you
[1:07:20] many of you probably know about this but
[1:07:22] he says oh brother Branham she has over
[1:07:24] the Bremen do you think I'll live
[1:07:26] he goes I believe you will but do you
[1:07:29] believe you will she said oh yes I
[1:07:32] believe sure I don't care what my church
[1:07:34] says I believe Georgia Carter got well
[1:07:37] said I'll get well - I'm just scared of
[1:07:40] the operation
[1:07:40] no brother Brown makes the statement
[1:07:42] send down a girl thought she believed
[1:07:44] and many times we come to church and we
[1:07:47] think we believe she thought she
[1:07:50] believed just like me you come down
[1:07:52] tonight
[1:07:52] you think you believe but she didn't
[1:07:54] believe and he said sister I don't mean
[1:07:57] to hurt your feelings but you do not
[1:07:59] believe I notice here's a prophet of God
[1:08:02] do you think maybe you're getting praise
[1:08:03] on the property he's gonna build you up
[1:08:05] lift you up Oh bless God you gotta fake
[1:08:07] no sister you don't believe could you
[1:08:10] imagine me coming to this church this
[1:08:12] morning telling every one of y'all y'all
[1:08:13] don't believe man and brothers I said
[1:08:16] never had me back more he preached doom
[1:08:19] and gloom and I was gonna make it but
[1:08:21] here's a prophet right here standing
[1:08:23] before this young girl her life was on
[1:08:25] the line she was about to die and she's
[1:08:29] thinking that she's believing so he had
[1:08:31] to go and catch her and tell her you do
[1:08:33] not believe though you think you believe
[1:08:35] and so that's why I'm here this morning
[1:08:36] maybe some of you come in here and you
[1:08:38] think oh well go to a message Church Oh
[1:08:40] bless God I believe God sent a prophet I
[1:08:42] believe brother Branham and you can
[1:08:45] quote scriptures and quotes and all that
[1:08:46] but yet something but believing and
[1:08:48] having faith are two different animals
[1:08:51] morning I want you to have faith to
[1:08:52] speak what you have Nina because if
[1:08:55] we're not going to put it back on the
[1:08:56] days go by we're gonna put it back that
[1:08:58] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday back
[1:09:00] then today this morning it'll be the
[1:09:03] same for you tomorrow but you gotta
[1:09:05] anchor your soul in faith that you know
[1:09:07] that God's Word is real she said oh I
[1:09:11] believe I believe brother Branham was
[1:09:13] she thought she believed she had hope
[1:09:16] but faith is the substance of things
[1:09:19] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:09:21] seen you see what I mean and I said
[1:09:23] sister in an ordinary case because I
[1:09:26] think I could have a little time I'll
[1:09:28] let you have time maybe to take take
[1:09:30] about a little bit as much faith to go
[1:09:31] out with it but you haven't got you
[1:09:34] haven't got an immediate attention or
[1:09:35] because you've got to have an immediate
[1:09:37] of attention right now for I'm gonna ask
[1:09:40] I'm gonna be honest with you you'll not
[1:09:42] live to see the hospital and so she said
[1:09:45] well she believed but she did not I said
[1:09:48] sister you do not have faith whole
[1:09:52] reverend Branham I have faith to believe
[1:09:53] anything notice her reply he goes if you
[1:09:58] have faith notice his reply if you have
[1:10:01] faith I want to ask you or show you
[1:10:02] rather that you don't have faith now

[1:12:50] she said you don't believe she said no

[1:12:55] said now one day Jesus passed by a tree
[1:12:58] he wanted to find some fruit on it there
[1:13:00] was no fruit on it but he put a curse on
[1:13:02] it in the tree begin to wilt and when
[1:13:04] they pass by at noon the tree was
[1:13:07] wilting down and Peter remark and he
[1:13:08] said how quick the tree would wilted and
[1:13:11] he said if you will say in your heart
[1:13:13] for this tree to be plucked up and cast
[1:13:15] into the sea and would not doubt it
[1:13:17] would
[1:13:18] now we have faked to believe that but we
[1:13:21] refuse to have fate to make a bracelet
[1:13:23] move he says now if you say in your
[1:13:27] heart for this tree to be pulled up and
[1:13:29] cast into the sea when I'm down you
[1:13:30] heart you'll have it he's also said now
[1:13:32] if you'd said into this mountain be thou
[1:13:33] removed and not doubt in your heart but
[1:13:35] by and by it will come to pass did he
[1:13:37] say that sure he did he says now if you
[1:13:40] have faith the size of a mustard seed if
[1:13:42] the faith of a mustard seed will move
[1:13:44] move that mountain
[1:13:45] how much smaller faith would it take to
[1:13:48] move that bracelet let me tell you a
[1:13:49] church if the faith the size of a
[1:13:51] mustard seed can move monks how much
[1:13:53] smaller faith will it take for you this
[1:13:55] morning to receive your healing what
[1:13:57] about your total deliverance what about
[1:14:00] your loss what about your children how
[1:14:02] much smaller faith would it take this
[1:14:04] morning if that little bitty seen that
[1:14:06] little bit of faith - movement what
[1:14:08] would it take the move on your situation
[1:14:10] all they take for God to come back this
[1:14:13] little room this morning ever getting to
[1:14:14] raise you up it give you desires of your
[1:14:17] heart hey let's take a great amount of
[1:14:19] faith it just takes us steadfast don't
[1:14:22] believe the word just that little seed
[1:14:27] can move a mountain I'm not asking you
[1:14:30] to move a bracelet I'm not asking you to
[1:14:34] move a mountain this morning I'm just
[1:14:36] asking you to have faith to believe for
[1:14:38] your situation just have faith to
[1:14:41] believe for your situation to believe
[1:14:43] for your circumstance
[1:14:45] she said well lookie here I want to ask
[1:14:47] you something she said did God move that
[1:14:50] bracelet did the devil move he said
[1:14:53] neither one of them moved it then hide
[1:14:55] in the world did it move well I said I
[1:14:58] moved it said we're here 15 feet away
[1:15:00] from it said no my faith moved it see if
[1:15:05] you ask anything and not doubt if you
[1:15:10] ask anything and not doubt the Bible
[1:15:14] says here if we go back to John and
[1:15:15] verse 14 he that believeth on me how
[1:15:19] many of you believe this morning and the
[1:15:21] works that I do you believe the works
[1:15:24] that he did you shall do also do you
[1:15:28] really believe that this morning
[1:15:30] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:15:32] and greater works than these shall you
[1:15:35] do because I go into the Father not
[1:15:38] greater as far as your gonna do more
[1:15:39] miraculous but no greater because now
[1:15:41] it's no longer a single man ministry now
[1:15:43] some most emember body called the bride
[1:15:45] of Jesus Christ all over the world doing
[1:15:47] what the same time the same wonders the
[1:15:51] same works that's how now that the bride
[1:15:53] is doing the great work
[1:15:55] Satan already knows it's about you that
[1:15:57] you can do the greater works you just
[1:15:59] don't have faith yet to believe he says
[1:16:04] whatsoever you ask in my name that I
[1:16:08] will do that the father will be
[1:16:10] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[1:16:13] in my name I will do it I've not asked
[1:16:20] one thing from God yet but what he's not
[1:16:22] brought into pass
[1:16:23] what brother Joe didn't happen overnight
[1:16:24] no it didn't happen overnight having
[1:16:26] over meeting Heights sometimes it just
[1:16:28] takes a long long time sometime it take
[1:16:31] weeks months you know we know the story
[1:16:33] it was 33 weeks if I'm not mistaken for
[1:16:36] Daniel there or David whichever one of
[1:16:38] them he was asked you know his prayer
[1:16:40] went up and here comes in the Spirit of
[1:16:42] God and he was fighting his whole way
[1:16:43] back to get to him it was three weeks
[1:16:45] but he hurt him the very first time he
[1:16:46] prayed and gods heard your prayer the
[1:16:49] very first time you pray for that
[1:16:50] situation for that loved one that you
[1:16:52] have a need that you got God's heard
[1:16:54] your prayer and if we know that he hears
[1:16:56] our prayer then we know that we get our
[1:16:58] petitions asked because why because God
[1:17:01] is faithful to his people but see we
[1:17:05] declare the we're bride of his bone of
[1:17:07] his bone flesh of his race we decree
[1:17:09] that we are him in this hour then
[1:17:11] where's our faith to believe the
[1:17:13] impossible where is our faith to believe
[1:17:16] in the supernatural we say God's
[1:17:19] supernatural God's just natural the
[1:17:20] thing is that we got to rise ourselves
[1:17:23] up in God's presence so that we can
[1:17:24] start responding like God yet he's
[1:17:28] supernatural but the things he does is
[1:17:30] natural to God and if we're Messiah if
[1:17:32] we're gods then the things that we do
[1:17:34] are just not supernatural they're just
[1:17:36] natural because why we're believer it's
[1:17:38] naturally for us to believe the Word of
[1:17:40] God it shouldn't be a supernatural thing
[1:17:42] cause to believe does say it the Lord
[1:17:46] but many times I think we've we find
[1:17:48] that God puts these things in the word
[1:17:50] and we just glossed right over if I had
[1:17:53] this kind of faith I can speak to that
[1:17:54] now
[1:17:55] but yeah we don't believe that mountains
[1:17:57] gonna move we just quoted holy blessed
[1:18:00] God we can pluck that tree up and go
[1:18:01] planting over here put it in the sea
[1:18:03] you know but I believe right now within
[1:18:07] each and every believer here this
[1:18:08] morning is the power of God to make
[1:18:11] those things come to pass and you're
[1:18:14] gonna find it as we keep going through
[1:18:15] this service today into this evening we
[1:18:18] find now we can do the greater works but
[1:18:22] it's time we put our faith into action
[1:18:26] people will say well that only pertain
[1:18:28] to brother battle well if it only
[1:18:31] pertain to brother Branham then he's he
[1:18:32] would have said these signs should
[1:18:34] follow him and not them come on somebody
[1:18:39] these signs to follow him and not them
[1:18:41] well as you guys got to be for a
[1:18:43] prophetic ministry well I'm glad it is
[1:18:44] for a prophet in misery because I'll
[1:18:46] read revelations 10 and verse 8
[1:18:48] somebody's taking the book somebody must
[1:18:50] prophesy again
[1:18:51] who's that promise on he's already ran
[1:18:53] his course brother branham's no over
[1:18:55] here the promise ah now it's the bride
[1:18:56] we've eaten a book or a proper sign
[1:18:58] again you've got a prophetic ministry
[1:19:00] and it's time that you take the circle
[1:19:02] and you put your faith tonight and you
[1:19:04] make the Word of God live in this hour
[1:19:06] somebody's going to be a written epistle
[1:19:08] somebody's going to be a direct
[1:19:09] reflection of a word made manifest in
[1:19:12] this hour and when they got a need they
[1:19:13] don't go crying about it they just cry
[1:19:15] out to God ain't got no sponsor that
[1:19:17] ain't got issues of that thing ain't got
[1:19:20] ministers to him and you see the hand of
[1:19:22] God move on their behalf the Bible
[1:19:28] is Jesus speaking many mighty works he
[1:19:31] could not do because of the people's
[1:19:33] unbelief oh don't let that be your
[1:19:36] crutch so let that be your hindrance
[1:19:39] your unbelief no be like that that man
[1:19:42] said lord I believe but help down my
[1:19:44] unbelief I believe I want to believe
[1:19:47] help my unbelief help me when I get down
[1:19:50] help me when I when I when I look at the
[1:19:51] symptoms I look at the situation and I
[1:19:53] take my eyes off the prom Oh help me
[1:19:55] dear no stop to have faith that I
[1:19:57] believe back to the story of the little
[1:20:03] girl she said now what do you Tim she
[1:20:07] says well do you mean to tell me what
[1:20:08] part does that play with God that part
[1:20:10] there and he says now there was an angel
[1:20:13] came down in the room and told me that
[1:20:15] way or that back way back before I was
[1:20:18] born before I was ordained with the gift
[1:20:20] of divine healing and he came and he
[1:20:22] told me in a room one night they God has
[1:20:24] sent a gift and the gift of divine
[1:20:28] healing was for the people and if I
[1:20:31] could get two people to believe me and
[1:20:33] would be sincere when I prayed nothing
[1:20:37] would stand before the prayer and I said
[1:20:41] therefore speaking face-to-face with the
[1:20:43] supernatural being I believed it with
[1:20:46] all my heart and if I can get you to
[1:20:49] believe me with all your heart that's
[1:20:51] what smooth God if you can believe this
[1:20:56] morning Church with all your heart that
[1:20:58] is what's going to move God your belief
[1:21:01] moves God to your situation your faith
[1:21:04] to take God at His Word moves God to
[1:21:06] your scene moves God to that trial that
[1:21:08] you're in it brings God on the scene for
[1:21:11] you it's your faith that moves God and
[1:21:15] then he says then your he'll say your
[1:21:17] faith has saved you you see what I mean
[1:21:19] your faith to believe have saved you not
[1:21:22] what you worked up to not your adults in
[1:21:24] your mind but what you really know the
[1:21:26] very evidence of things not seen you see
[1:21:29] what I mean and the girl said I truly
[1:21:30] know there's something above that I've
[1:21:32] never reached she said I'll try with all
[1:21:34] my heart and God had mercy on me said
[1:21:36] let me believe that she was sincere and
[1:21:38] what I want to believe
[1:21:40] let me believe he was I took her by the
[1:21:41] hand then and we've been the vibration
[1:21:44] was pouring forth from that ruptured
[1:21:45] appendix and I had prayer for and it
[1:21:48] stopped it immediately and I said god

[1:25:29] ministers we pray over and she'd go tuck
[1:25:31] him on the mattress or tuck him
[1:25:32] underneath the pillow but he had a slew
[1:25:34] of prayer cloth under that bed hey
[1:25:37] wonder why he kept fighting

[1:26:08] takes a bunch of us brothers somebody's
[1:26:10] close friends he says I need y'all to be
[1:26:12] praying for me I didn't know what was
[1:26:13] going on but I knew God was dealing with
[1:26:15] because he's never responded to us like
[1:26:16] yeah
[1:26:17] oh he come to church on a Wednesday
[1:26:19] night brother Timothy Prue was preaching
[1:26:22] he was talking about the man the little
[1:26:23] warrior there or the military guy got
[1:26:25] off the train and he had spiritual
[1:26:27] amnesia and here this brother was
[1:26:29] sitting there and he had spiritual
[1:26:30] amnesia he didn't know who he was but he
[1:26:32] know he took them some ladies didn't
[1:26:33] know hard to get back I remember one
[1:26:34] time a conversation I had with him I
[1:26:36] said man why are you doing this he goes
[1:26:38] do you think I want to live this way I
[1:26:40] don't want to live this way I want to
[1:26:42] serve God but there's nothing inside of
[1:26:44] me they don't let me do it that's how
[1:26:46] bad he didn't God I saw the condition
[1:26:47] that even God that's what the devil kept
[1:26:49] trying to put over there's no use you
[1:26:51] have no desire or mateus a son of God
[1:26:54] can go a long time before you ever
[1:26:55] recognize that he's a son of God always
[1:26:58] just see that God deposited before the
[1:27:01] foundational world he was inside him it
[1:27:04] may have been a little bitty mustard
[1:27:05] seed oh it had life in it but he said
[1:27:09] through that service and brother Timothy
[1:27:10] started up talking about that guy he
[1:27:13] started wandering off the train there
[1:27:14] and he saw this water tower oh but he
[1:27:18] saw the water tower triggered dolf's
[1:27:20] he's startled remember at home well my
[1:27:22] cousin just so had lelee design from a
[1:27:24] water tower but they tell your church
[1:27:27] that devil was on the run here he was he
[1:27:30] doesn't begin to stir something and he
[1:27:32] went up to the altar after the service
[1:27:34] and he says no bro Brown never said that
[1:27:36] a water tower he said yes he did here it
[1:27:38] is right here he fell to his knees and
[1:27:41] gave his heart to God and he hain't turn
[1:27:43] back yet what do you say I'm saying the
[1:27:47] same God that saved you is the same God
[1:27:49] because your loved ones he's the same
[1:27:53] God but it's based on your faith that
[1:27:56] mama never quit that daughter in the
[1:27:58] songs never quit praying never quit
[1:28:00] believing a wife never gave up on her
[1:28:02] husband she'd always saved him a seat in
[1:28:05] the pew in case he decided to drop him
[1:28:08] let me tell you another story had a
[1:28:10] prayer line one night brother Wayne lost
[1:28:11] was at our church on a Wednesday night
[1:28:13] boy imitating a power God came in that
[1:28:16] building it seemed like we pray for
[1:28:17] every person in the church well young
[1:28:19] girl Kimberly
[1:28:20] one of our young sisters 16 17 at the
[1:28:23] time she came here and she was crying
[1:28:26] she had her eyes all cry you know just
[1:28:28] tore up she goes I really want my
[1:28:30] brother to be safe but this young man I
[1:28:32] got into college he didn't call her now
[1:28:34] and then started doing drugs and in the
[1:28:36] world and just doing all kind of things
[1:28:37] running around with the bone wrong crowd
[1:28:38] playing worldly music you know very
[1:28:40] gifted kid but he was completely lost
[1:28:43] well service went on and on you know and
[1:28:47] it's a lemak lot and mom and dad and
[1:28:49] daughter ain't home he begins to get
[1:28:51] worried he gets in his car then 30 he
[1:28:54] they ain't home yet they he runs to the
[1:28:57] neighbor's house that goes to our church
[1:28:58] they home either
[1:29:00] he's all Lord the rational took place 14
[1:29:03] he ran to the church he comes stumbling
[1:29:06] into the church hey drug him to the
[1:29:08] office that boy ain't never been the
[1:29:10] same the faith of a young girl went
[1:29:13] after her brother some twenty minutes
[1:29:15] later he comes bagging in the house of
[1:29:18] God but he's a real born-again son of
[1:29:21] God today what was it was a faith of a
[1:29:23] sister they stand there for a brother
[1:29:25] just and in need and God responded to
[1:29:29] her faith whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:29:32] that I would have show me maybe summer
[1:29:37] maybe minutes but whatsoever you ask in
[1:29:42] my name that I will do so the safe faith
[1:29:47] let's say this young girl the same faith
[1:29:51] that went out to my cousin the same
[1:29:53] faith to save sister Elena bus from
[1:29:55] cancer and Mariah Pruett from alopecia
[1:29:57] is the same faith that you need right
[1:30:00] here this morning
[1:30:01] for whatever trial you're going through
[1:30:05] continue on the story a few moments
[1:30:08] later I was sitting in a chair because I
[1:30:10] went to sleep someone's coming up I had
[1:30:14] just to get a little bit of rest before
[1:30:15] returning home because I was afraid I'd
[1:30:16] break up somewhere on the road have a
[1:30:18] wreck and I was sitting there and then I
[1:30:19] called the ambulance and told them there
[1:30:21] was no need he goes I was waking by one
[1:30:24] of the family while the girl was out of
[1:30:26] bed she didn't eat a pint of ice cream
[1:30:28] and she never had a knife from that day
[1:30:30] to this completely delivered
[1:30:34] and notice every time the prophet of God
[1:30:37] if you listen to the ends of the tapes
[1:30:39] in the prayer lines or when he had a
[1:30:41] special prayer for different ones he
[1:30:42] said your faith have saved thee see it
[1:30:46] wasn't him doing the healing it was God
[1:30:48] recognising the faith of the people and
[1:30:51] when their faiths reached up enough to
[1:30:53] God's Word and God pronounced him healed
[1:30:55] or pronounced and delivered so it's not
[1:30:58] based on a man God don't want you to put
[1:30:59] your faith on a man you don't put your
[1:31:01] faith in a church put your faith in dust
[1:31:03] said or in the Word of God cuz man can
[1:31:05] fail you Church can crumble and fall but
[1:31:07] the Word of God sure and stedfast in a
[1:31:10] heavens and earth will pass away that
[1:31:12] this world will never pass away so I'll
[1:31:16] say tonight is time that we cast all our
[1:31:18] reasons aside we throw away all the
[1:31:20] doubts and unbelief and we were getting
[1:31:21] to say this is my day Lord I'm going to
[1:31:23] be delivered today I'm going to be
[1:31:25] healed today my kids are coming home
[1:31:27] today
[1:31:27] my Lost Levels are coming back today I
[1:31:29] refuse to leave out of this church the
[1:31:31] same as I won't did something's gonna
[1:31:33] happen
[1:31:33] my faith today it's gonna pull God to my
[1:31:36] knee program said that faith is the only
[1:31:41] direct positive sense it's the sixth
[1:31:44] sense faith is more than sight features
[1:31:46] more than feeling you don't feel faith
[1:31:48] you don't taste faith you don't smell
[1:31:49] faith you don't see faith faith is the
[1:31:51] substance of things hoped for and the
[1:31:53] evidence of things not real and when
[1:31:56] real faith listen when real faith takes
[1:31:58] a hold in the heart it's not
[1:31:59] intellectual you found people trying to
[1:32:02] make their self believe we've all been
[1:32:04] there it's okay it's called human nature
[1:32:08] that's why the Bible says cast down
[1:32:10] imagination could imagine yourself
[1:32:11] healing and believe don't imagine it any
[1:32:16] longer
[1:32:16] no probably I said picture yourself the
[1:32:18] whole body and walk into it don't
[1:32:21] imagine it picture it yeah there it is
[1:32:23] I'm walking into it he says it's not an
[1:32:28] election is no more reason it's real the
[1:32:30] Spirit of God witnessing through you
[1:32:32] God's Word is truth he goes I'll stay
[1:32:35] right with it yes sir and that's what
[1:32:37] brings the results but now we know that
[1:32:40] faith is a substance Hebrews 11:1 things
[1:32:44] hoped for and the evidence of things not
[1:32:46] seen
[1:32:47] but the brother Brown makes a statement
[1:32:49] in a perfect faith and I would encourage
[1:32:51] you if you had listened to that sermon
[1:32:52] in quite a long time maybe you want to
[1:32:55] go back and listen to it perfect faith
[1:32:57] he says now here's where many people
[1:32:59] fail to receive their healing or what
[1:33:01] they're asking for because they take
[1:33:03] faith to something that it's not they
[1:33:05] don't believe it's not an imagination
[1:33:07] it's an actual substance see it's not
[1:33:11] what you imagine is just as real as any
[1:33:13] sense of your body wouldn't clear
[1:33:15] anything is just as real as my eyes see
[1:33:18] this piece of paper right here it's just
[1:33:20] as real as that as a light right there
[1:33:22] he goes it's just as real as I feel my
[1:33:24] coat it's just as real as you hear the
[1:33:26] baby talking right here see it's just as
[1:33:28] real the only thing is is you can't show
[1:33:30] it to somebody else you have it alone
[1:33:32] see it's yours faith is the substance of
[1:33:35] things hoped for it's not a myth he says
[1:33:40] notice it's something that you possess
[1:33:41] not an imagination if you really have it
[1:33:45] so it's not in a man it's not an
[1:33:48] organization it's not in a group of
[1:33:50] people it's in God because God is a word
[1:33:52] and your faith is in God and one faith
[1:33:57] but that makes a statement here he says
[1:33:59] now there's many times that people have
[1:34:01] faith today and tomorrow they haven't
[1:34:02] got it I'm not even gonna ask you to
[1:34:05] raise your hands because the look on
[1:34:07] your face says guilty right we all been
[1:34:11] there guilty Bojo don't pick me out
[1:34:15] don't embarrass me in front of I don't
[1:34:17] even know you
[1:34:19] we're good he says now there many times
[1:34:25] people have fake say it's more they
[1:34:27] haven't got it the next day there's
[1:34:28] something in something else he said but
[1:34:30] when God anchors it and you see it
[1:34:32] there's nothing ever gonna make you move
[1:34:35] from it and he says now the church has
[1:34:38] itself up in the power of God because
[1:34:41] we're too close to the end now and I
[1:34:43] believe that your church is in a
[1:34:44] condition where we can teach it a little
[1:34:46] deeper things and rub some of them
[1:34:47] make-believe off get into something real
[1:34:51] I think it's time you know we you know
[1:34:52] we're worried about the seven seals and
[1:34:54] let me tell you the great that the seven
[1:34:55] seals are open but if you ain't got
[1:34:57] faith for your own personal needs why do
[1:34:58] you want to have faith for the seven
[1:35:00] seals
[1:35:01] there's a lot of times we need God to
[1:35:03] meet our needs not our intellectual
[1:35:05] understanding God I need you to be my
[1:35:09] healer I need you to be my deliverer but
[1:35:11] oh you guys so many people that focus on
[1:35:12] the deep things of God and yeah the
[1:35:14] Spirit of God loves the deep things of
[1:35:15] God and there's a time and a place for
[1:35:17] those deep things but when you're going
[1:35:19] through the valley and you're in that
[1:35:20] trial you need a God as the little boy
[1:35:22] said I need God with skin on them
[1:35:24] I need a living God to come by my way I
[1:35:27] don't need these deep intellectual
[1:35:28] thoughts I need a living God to manifest
[1:35:30] a living presence if form I need I need
[1:35:33] that kind of faith lord help my unbelief
[1:35:35] this morning let me believe in the
[1:35:37] supernatural let me believe in a Living
[1:35:40] God let me believe in a miracle let me
[1:35:42] believe in a divine healer let me
[1:35:44] believe in a God that still say O God
[1:35:46] that still delivers oh god that still
[1:35:48] sets free Oh God is still able to move
[1:35:50] let me believe this morning in thank God
[1:36:00] John 16 in that day you should ask me
[1:36:03] nothing but verily verily I say unto you
[1:36:05] whatsoever you ask the Father in my name
[1:36:08] he will give it to you propose oh you
[1:36:12] sure are doing a lot of reiterating well
[1:36:14] maybe a little bit of repetition you're
[1:36:15] the anchor in here but it'll go from
[1:36:19] here down to here and when he gets into
[1:36:21] here brother BAM said that's where life
[1:36:22] begins but it passes through the mind in
[1:36:26] a drop down into the heart then life can
[1:36:28] begin to spring up no longer is it
[1:36:30] intellectual now it's oh I believe
[1:36:33] whatsoever you ask the Father in my name
[1:36:35] I recite that all time whatsoever things
[1:36:37] I desire when I pray if I can believe
[1:36:39] that I have then I'll have what I asked
[1:36:40] for
[1:36:41] that's one of my favorite I quote that
[1:36:42] scripture almost every day Lord I don't
[1:36:44] come to you in this we're just you know
[1:36:46] have hardness but Lord you said
[1:36:47] whatsoever things I can that I desire if
[1:36:49] I can believe this morning when I pray
[1:36:51] God I believe that yours that same kind
[1:36:53] of God this morning I've seen the
[1:36:54] miracles I've seen deliverance I've seen
[1:36:56] salvation as I've seen God move a
[1:36:58] super-nice way God I know if I can just
[1:37:00] get you right here if I can be sincere
[1:37:02] when I pray that you minister to this
[1:37:04] need and I've never seen God failed me
[1:37:06] yet
[1:37:08] he says now he will give it to you
[1:37:11] hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[1:37:14] name ask and you shall receive that your
[1:37:17] joy may be full well I think Pentecost
[1:37:21] fell he says you can never exhaust God's
[1:37:23] love and mercy to you come on somebody
[1:37:27] ah ah you know I asked too much he finds
[1:37:30] some people you go to some churches man
[1:37:31] there isn't one person they come with
[1:37:32] you they come to the altar every service
[1:37:35] you got those kind of people well like I
[1:37:38] told the church last weekend where I was
[1:37:39] and I said maybe if you had their needs
[1:37:41] you'd be at the altar here a lot more to
[1:37:43] do you don't know what that person is
[1:37:45] dealing with you don't know what that
[1:37:46] person is going through maybe that
[1:37:48] person is do being as sincere as they
[1:37:49] can you know many times we look back
[1:37:51] like man will they ever get up from the
[1:37:52] altar but if we were in that condition
[1:37:55] and that need maybe would be there a
[1:37:57] little bit more sincere a little bit
[1:37:59] more seeking Gallivan more but but
[1:38:01] brother L says you can never exhaust
[1:38:02] God's love and mercy to you you say well
[1:38:04] I hate to bother you so much father
[1:38:09] now how many you got children well Jesse
[1:38:11] you don't have to say we got you got way
[1:38:13] too many well you know this is the truth
[1:38:17] you know you can't bother God I got four
[1:38:22] kids and I we haven't we have a
[1:38:24] two-story house and my office is up on
[1:38:26] the up story to the far end of the house
[1:38:29] and I soundproofed it I did it on
[1:38:31] purpose because I knew I had four kids
[1:38:33] or at least three kids at the time third
[1:38:35] one was on the way the fourth one is
[1:38:36] coming later so when we built the house
[1:38:38] I built it because I was going to my
[1:38:39] study I wanted to be quiet I want to be
[1:38:41] shut in so I go up there and I start
[1:38:44] studying you know just never fails next

[1:40:39] to that need because let me tell you you
[1:40:41] are God to your children they hold you

[1:40:56] that he was to be bothered that way he
[1:40:59] does don't ever think that you can ask
[1:41:00] too much of God I believe the scripture
[1:41:03] says you have not because you ask not
[1:41:05] and you ask not because you believe not
[1:41:07] he wants you to ask and believe that
[1:41:09] your joy may be full
[1:41:10] he wants you to ask abundantly he wants
[1:41:13] you to ask for big things
[1:41:14] don't limit your faith to little mustard
[1:41:17] seed get on out there is some big kind
[1:41:19] of fate and move out into things big
[1:41:21] things is just as easy to receive as
[1:41:23] little things because you must have you
[1:41:27] must have to believe all things he goes
[1:41:29] you gotta have faith you just can't just
[1:41:31] go out there and just have hardly do a
[1:41:33] bit you can because now you can put it
[1:41:35] to rental to the right to the work and
[1:41:37] it'll be just fine
[1:41:39] so I say tonight don't live in your
[1:41:40] faith to just small things don't limit
[1:41:43] your faith tonight to your situation
[1:41:45] don't live in God's ability to move on
[1:41:48] your behalf because you're in a trial
[1:41:50] know you expect God to come down you
[1:41:52] expect God to move you expect God to
[1:41:54] raise you up you expect God to deliver
[1:41:57] you expect God to do what His Word says
[1:41:59] in there you can never exhaust God's
[1:42:01] goodness
[1:42:04] could you imagine a little bitty fish
[1:42:06] and a great big ocean swimming around
[1:42:09] all of a sudden poof I got to consider
[1:42:12] this thing if I drink all this water I'm
[1:42:16] going down now this little bitty fish is
[1:42:20] massive ocean he swim my oh ho ho ho
[1:42:24] stop it sometime let's how do we do we
[1:42:27] stop the hop God if I do this it's gonna
[1:42:32] be my hand
[1:42:33] oh brother barely makes the statement he
[1:42:35] says now he goes it could easily be done
[1:42:38] for that fish to drink all that water
[1:42:40] that ocean then it could be that you can
[1:42:43] exhaust God's goodness he says now now
[1:42:47] it could more easily be done
[1:42:49] you could ask too much of God he's the
[1:42:51] end he goes you cannot ask too much ago
[1:42:53] he's the inexhaustible Fenna life
[1:42:55] whatever you have need of ask him and
[1:42:57] believe it he provided in the redemptive
[1:43:00] blessing when he died at Calvary
[1:43:01] and he gave the promise to you for
[1:43:03] everything that you have neither while
[1:43:05] you're in this journey it's yours if
[1:43:07] you'll ask and believe it and where's
[1:43:12] the believer planted by the
[1:43:13] inexhaustible fountain of life oh you
[1:43:16] got a do church's drink and push out
[1:43:18] drink and push out come to serving and
[1:43:21] drinking in the same me Lord
[1:43:23] that's the world oh hey
[1:43:24] begin to push out delivery hey push out
[1:43:27] healing ain't even gonna push out move
[1:43:29] what are you doing you're drinking in
[1:43:30] faith you're drinking in the word cuz
[1:43:32] thank Tomic by hearing and hearing by
[1:43:34] the Word of God
[1:43:35] you can exhaust God's goodness you can't
[1:43:38] exhaust God's grace everything that you
[1:43:40] have meet up when you receive the Holy
[1:43:41] Ghost is in you already from here to the
[1:43:43] other side all you got to do is know how
[1:43:47] to use the faith that God's given you
[1:43:49] and the Bible says that he's given every
[1:43:51] man a measure of faith some of yours is
[1:43:57] only that big some of yours is not even
[1:44:00] that big but it doesn't matter because
[1:44:03] every man has been given a measure of
[1:44:05] faith all that you have to do church is
[1:44:08] put it in action as I begin to bring
[1:44:13] this down to a close my map says now
[1:44:17] sons and daughters of God would create a
[1:44:20] world would create them a world out
[1:44:22] there and go live on a private life
[1:44:23] owner because you had the power in you
[1:44:25] to do that if you got the shadow of the
[1:44:28] power God in you you got the power do it
[1:44:30] God as I'm nipping at you see what I
[1:44:32] mean the power that's in you will make
[1:44:34] you could speak a world into existence
[1:44:36] and go and live on it but you tremble
[1:44:39] when I talked about moving that bracelet
[1:44:40] you were stricken in fear oh I can't do
[1:44:43] that but ya know probably God says you
[1:44:45] got if you got the shadow of the power
[1:44:47] of God and you you can create another
[1:44:48] world and go live a private life on it
[1:44:51] he goes that's what's the powers in the
[1:44:53] church now but it's controlled by law
[1:44:55] and the law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:44:57] Commandments it's the law of faith Jesus
[1:44:59] says all things are possible to them
[1:45:01] that believe if you can believe it
[1:45:03] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:45:05] believe that is yours if you can find
[1:45:09] the key to this law of faith that opens
[1:45:12] it to you you see what I mean if you're
[1:45:14] a son and daughter of God that never
[1:45:16] leaves you is with you all the time but
[1:45:18] your faith gets because your faith gets
[1:45:20] away from it but it's still there so
[1:45:23] we're trying to bring your faith back in
[1:45:25] line with it he says now God's power
[1:45:28] listen as we begin to bring us to a
[1:45:30] close
[1:45:30] God's power is limited to your faith
[1:45:34] that's the only limited has is your
[1:45:37] faith
[1:45:39] all things are possible to them that
[1:45:41] believe there's a great God in heaven
[1:45:44] and if we can only get in contact like a
[1:45:46] direct line to him all things are
[1:45:48] possible but we must come in contact
[1:45:50] with them with no static nowhere you
[1:45:53] remember you you should turn that door
[1:45:55] down on the radio you hear like till you
[1:45:58] pick up a right channel you know what we
[1:46:01] need to do is get other out of the way
[1:46:02] and tune in to the Father so we have a
[1:46:05] direct line there's no static no where
[1:46:08] and he says just a clear channel between
[1:46:10] us and God and then he said if you say
[1:46:13] it to this mountain be moved and not
[1:46:14] doubt on your heart but believe what you
[1:46:16] have said he goes now you can't Bluff it
[1:46:18] Satan doesn't Bluff too easy he goes so
[1:46:20] you can't Bluff it but when you really
[1:46:22] know that it's got to happen it just
[1:46:24] must happen and he says now as much as
[1:46:26] your faith will be released that's how
[1:46:29] much power you can have because in you
[1:46:32] dwells the power to make heavens and
[1:46:34] earth God dwells in you and your sons
[1:46:39] and daughters of God there you are but
[1:46:41] it's your faith according to your faith
[1:46:45] be it unto you if thou canst believe all
[1:46:47] things are possible and we find here
[1:46:50] second Corinthians four and verse 13 the
[1:46:53] Bible says and we having the same spirit
[1:46:55] of faith according it is as it is
[1:46:59] written I believe therefore I have
[1:47:01] spoken and we also believe and therefore
[1:47:05] we speak and I ask you this morning
[1:47:08] Church do you have faith that a speak
[1:47:12] speak to your trial speak to your
[1:47:14] situation speak to your need you got a
[1:47:17] mouth on just laying in your way
[1:47:18] zechariah 4:17 says who art thou a great
[1:47:21] mountain before zubaba
[1:47:23] thou shall become a plain speak to your
[1:47:26] mountains speak God's given us
[1:47:28] everything that we have need ah we have
[1:47:31] faith that's what God sent this message
[1:47:33] for it was to give you faith in a word
[1:47:35] give you faith in the resurrection give
[1:47:36] you faith in a ration give you faith to
[1:47:38] not be afraid to ask God and not only
[1:47:43] ask but ask for big things speak to that
[1:47:47] mountain that lays before you can you
[1:47:49] believe this morning
[1:47:51] can you believe that all things are
[1:47:52] possible to you because you believe can
[1:47:56] you believe that nothing is impossible
[1:47:57] with you because you believe you said
[1:48:01] we're brother Joe I believe but there's
[1:48:04] times I deal with fear and I deal with
[1:48:05] this and I got complexes Psalm 16 verse
[1:48:09] one says let God arise and let his
[1:48:11] enemies be scattered
[1:48:14] let them that also that hate him flee
[1:48:16] before him and I say this morning let
[1:48:18] fear leave this room this morning
[1:48:20] let depression and anxiety be scattered
[1:48:23] this one lake complexes vanish this
[1:48:25] morning lake sickness in the body flee
[1:48:26] this morning let change the darkness be
[1:48:28] broken this morning God but God's people
[1:48:31] exercise their faith faith to receive
[1:48:33] every promise of God and in the message
[1:48:38] perfect faith bro BAM says perfect faith
[1:48:40] masters all circumstances perfect faith
[1:48:44] masters all circumstance no matter what
[1:48:47] it is it masters it because when you
[1:48:49] believe anything do anything and you got
[1:48:51] faith in what you're doing no matter
[1:48:53] what the circumstance is dad don't have
[1:48:55] one thing to do with us see it masters
[1:48:57] that circumstance if it's in a room of
[1:48:59] sickness the Lord's revealed that a
[1:49:01] certain thing is going to happen to you
[1:49:03] you just speak it and go on you don't
[1:49:05] have to ask any question it's already
[1:49:07] over just keep going it masters all
[1:49:09] circumcised faith believes that God will
[1:49:12] work it out I don't know how he's going
[1:49:14] to do it but if he'll do it anyhow it
[1:49:16] masters all circumstance so what are you

[1:49:20] tonight oh this more do you have faith
[1:49:23] to speak what you have need of if you've
[1:49:25] got that kind of faith and you've got a
