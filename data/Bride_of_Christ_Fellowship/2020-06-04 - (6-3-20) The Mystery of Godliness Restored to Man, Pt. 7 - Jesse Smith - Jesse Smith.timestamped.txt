[22:18] forward to it 14 years having this
[22:20] church so we started on the first
[22:22] weekend of June in 2004 and talked 2006
[22:27] rather so this is the first weekend in
[22:30] June so nice nice we can fit it on the
[22:33] same weekend
[22:34] praise God so very thankful and looking
[22:38] forward to having brother Brooks with us
[22:39] and the Brooks flies in tomorrow night
[22:41] so just keep him in prayer just Oryza
[22:51] amen and I were talking about getting
[22:53] rid of this thing you know we might need
[22:54] a new one
[22:55] so it just makes all that noise so sorry
[22:58] about that
[23:00] would it be better if I just use that
[23:02] one does that bother you hon can you
[23:04] hear that yeah
[23:09] I can hear it cuz it's right here but
[23:17] okay is it can you hear pretty clear
[23:21] okay did you show you score to this okay
[23:24] I think I'll just go to that well The
[23:32] Sweeney and I do when I freaking I broke
[23:34] it a long time ago praise God let's take
[23:44] a few prayer requests here tonight and
[23:46] then we'll get to the Word of God I'm
[23:47] gonna try to preach I'm gonna set a
[23:49] timer for 35 minutes and that will be my
[23:52] closing point I'll try to start closing
[23:55] at 35 minutes and the reason is because
[23:57] if I don't my wife says I get lost in
[24:00] heavenly places and then that which is
[24:02] true I you know I can't I just don't
[24:07] know how to do it but anyways the
[24:09] trouble that is like especially during
[24:11] the school year you know staying here or
[24:12] too late throws off the rest of our week
[24:15] for our family I'm a little more tired
[24:18] and cranky kids or cranky you know your
[24:21] body really does well by getting to
[24:23] sleep at the same time every night I
[24:24] know we can't be perfect but I do want
[24:28] to try to be more cautious of that and
[24:30] there is a quote you know I mean I never
[24:32] want to limit the Holy Spirit but
[24:33] there's a quote brother Graham says
[24:34] trying to get your sermon to 35 or 45
[24:36] minutes so you do have one quote if you
[24:40] want it but Lord willing we'll try to
[24:43] get the message is short and sweet
[24:45] tonight by God's grace so let's take a
[24:50] few prayer requests whether a man got to
[24:52] witness to his stepsister so let's
[24:54] remember her that show open her heart to
[24:58] the Lord I was a great request also
[25:00] there was two young men baptized on
[25:03] Sunday one of them was already planned
[25:05] to but then after the sermon another one
[25:08] came up to be baptized Cody and Michael
[25:11] so let's remember them they're new
[25:13] believers and by the Kam's been doing a
[25:15] great job with them so let's pray for
[25:17] them also let's pray for this country
[25:19] with racism you know it's never laugh
[25:22] right you know it's so sad it was so
[25:26] public this last couple weeks it caught
[25:28] on video and it's just awful
[25:31] any Christian loves all skin colors
[25:33] because God loves all of them if you're
[25:35] a real Christian you love all of them
[25:37] and so sad but let's just pray that
[25:39] justice will be done that these officers
[25:40] will get justice for the evils that
[25:44] they've done also let's pray that the
[25:46] evils of the rioting and looting will
[25:48] stop as well two wrongs never make a
[25:51] right and that's awful that people would
[25:53] riot and loot and destroy it just shows
[25:58] it's the spirit of Satan behind both of
[26:00] those murder and also destruction and
[26:04] stealing and I think Akron had two
[26:06] people that got caught with two thousand
[26:09] dollars of stolen merchandise they just
[26:11] broke into stores and they arrested and
[26:13] it's just so sad to see that and also
[26:17] you know all the all the small
[26:18] businesses that had their property
[26:20] destroyed that was really sad so let's
[26:21] just remember all these things in prayer
[26:29] and brother Brooks said remember him in
[26:31] prayer you know his family with him
[26:33] being a black man his family is
[26:34] concerned with him traveling which is
[26:36] understandable of course so let's just
[26:39] remember his family he's not really
[26:42] concerned but you know his family and
[26:43] his wife and everybody are concerned
[26:45] just because of all the racial tensions
[26:47] in major cities but he's flying into
[26:49] Akron Canton so I haven't heard of any
[26:52] riots in Akron I've seen peaceful
[26:56] protests and then there was the one like
[26:58] I said a couple people got arrested for
[27:01] looting but not too big of riots or
[27:05] looting so a lot to pray for are there
[27:09] any other needs here tonight that anyone
[27:10] would like to be remembered in prayer
[27:12] Haven okay let's remember that
[27:21] let's remember who is that sister how
[27:24] your dad do it do it okay okay if you
[27:27] like it stronger about the same okay
[27:37] amen right he's gotta share that
[27:39] testimony with the Saints on Sunday they
[27:40] really enjoying it so thank you for the
[27:43] update we appreciate that and there was
[27:49] a sister that wanted prayer Netanya she
[27:55] has some back issues so she liked prayer
[27:58] for that so let's just pray for that
[28:06] okay I think that's it okay okay it's
[28:10] pray for our friends that be saved
[28:11] that's right
[28:15] you know I go on their Facebook page
[28:17] from time to time and check and see how
[28:18] they're doing they're really struggling
[28:20] so let's just remember them in prayer
[28:22] you know a tree is known by its fruit so
[28:27] you just have to pray for mercy you
[28:29] don't have to pray their hearts will
[28:31] open up God wants all to be saved and he
[28:34] can save like I told my cousin he can
[28:37] save to the utmost when I did see my
[28:39] cousin by the way the one that we were
[28:41] praying for he's fully delivered from
[28:43] the drugs we were just weeping and
[28:47] crying and praising the Lord it is a
[28:49] tremendous testimony he thanked acacia
[28:51] for all of her encouraging letters he
[28:54] said many of those were convicting to
[28:56] him and helped give his family hope but
[29:00] he is a new man and he was there Bible
[29:03] study on saronite he was there Sunday
[29:05] morning at church it was phenomenal
[29:07] and he was and then I was meeting with
[29:10] his brother too than when we prayed for
[29:11] and he was encouraging his brother to
[29:13] get baptized I was encouraging to get
[29:15] baptized too I said it'll change your
[29:16] life Matt yeah so it was just a powerful
[29:20] example of the power of Jesus Christ
[29:23] he's the same yesterday today and
[29:26] forever and that just brings joy to my
[29:28] heart God heard all of our prayers we
[29:29] didn't even see God doing it but God did
[29:31] it
[29:32] it ought to raise our faith for more
[29:34] praying or believing to see our loved
[29:37] ones safe also got a chance to witness
[29:39] to my dad he just I just brought up
[29:42] Jesus and we were talking and he was
[29:45] really listening to me and I was I told
[29:47] him about the forty years you know I
[29:49] told my preached out a long time ago but
[29:52] in 2023 will be forty years since he had
[29:55] that experience with the Lord but he's
[29:57] been running away from the Lord he
[29:58] thought that was really interesting and
[30:00] he said just this last week he said he
[30:02] was praying for the first time in a long
[30:05] time and he was crying while he was
[30:06] praying so let's pray that God was
[30:08] softened his heart just some really good
[30:11] just some good time and he actually
[30:12] smiled in the pictures that was even
[30:14] better I'm gonna upload that one on
[30:15] Facebook but he actually smiled in the
[30:17] picture it was it was really great so a
[30:20] lot of encouraging things from this
[30:21] weekend let's go before Lord and a word
[30:23] of Prayer here many many needs but our

[34:58] your faith virtue and to virtue

[35:09] name virtue alright first thessalonians
[35:12] 5:14 romans 5 14 to 23 nice portion of
[35:28] scripture beautiful beautiful portion
[35:41] first steps on it's 5:14
[35:53] alright let's read 14 down to 23 let's
[35:56] begin on three one two three
[35:58] now we exhort you brethren warn them
[36:02] that are unruly comfort the
[36:05] feeble-minded support the weak be
[36:08] patient toward all men see that none
[36:11] render evil for evil unto any man but
[36:15] ever follow that which is good both
[36:18] among yourselves and to all men rejoice
[36:22] evermore pray without ceasing in
[36:26] everything give thanks for this is the
[36:29] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[36:31] you quench not the spirit despise not
[36:35] prophesying prove all things hold fast
[36:39] that which is good
[36:41] abstain from all appearance of evil and
[36:44] the very God of peace sanctify you
[36:47] wholly and I pray God your whole spirit
[36:50] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[36:53] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[36:57] may God add his blessing Serena's worth
[36:59] maybe seated praise God ok I'm a set
[37:08] timer now this will work God's grace
[37:11] alright
[37:18] so Lord willing we'll keep going on
[37:20] godliness restored to man it's a great
[37:23] mystery Paul calls it a great mystery
[37:26] and the longer I serve the Lord the more
[37:28] I realized what a great mystery it is
[37:30] and the main issue I think is with as
[37:33] Peter said diligence a lot of message
[37:36] believers get lazy on the Lord but he
[37:39] said if you want these added you must be
[37:42] very diligent praise God and so that
[37:45] means year after year after year be
[37:47] diligent and be hungry and thirsty for
[37:50] righteousness and and see how closer to
[37:54] God you can be praise God not how easy
[37:57] your life can be but but how much
[38:00] more of God that he can add to your life
[38:03] praise God and so we see this as an
[38:06] important part of Christianity is
[38:08] growing in the grace of Lord I think
[38:10] Sunday morning and the point I
[38:12] ministered on Soul thirst and there was
[38:15] a great response of people that realize
[38:18] that the the each part of your being has
[38:21] a thirst so while you're there keepo up
[38:25] Ephesians two three
[38:26] I just realized as I was driving over
[38:29] there on Saturday that your mind has a
[38:31] thirst as well and it's scriptural so
[38:34] brother Ram in the sermon thirst says
[38:36] you have a body thirst for like water
[38:38] and food he says you have a soul thirst
[38:41] for holiness or fellowship with God but
[38:45] then also your mind has a desire as well
[38:48] and so here the Bible says of among whom
[38:51] also we had our conversation in times
[38:52] past in the lusts of the flesh
[38:54] fulfilling the desires of the flesh so
[38:57] there's your thirst for the flesh right
[38:58] and of the mind so I didn't realize
[39:03] that's something that's a fresh
[39:04] revelation that not only does your flesh
[39:07] and soul have a thirst but your mind has
[39:10] a thirst and then brother Branham gives
[39:13] examples in that sermon he said an
[39:15] architect has a thirst he said to want
[39:19] to design something new
[39:20] he said I'll sit down and he waits for
[39:23] the inspiration because he's desiring to
[39:25] to make a new structure that's never
[39:28] been made before I'm also said evil
[39:32] churches have a desire they have in
[39:34] their mind a certain pastor they want
[39:36] that will let them get away with sin
[39:38] well the man gives the example of a
[39:40] pastor that will let teenagers go on
[39:43] mission trips overseas and and learn
[39:45] evil dances he calls it the Watusi
[39:48] and he said come back and dance the
[39:50] Watusi and then the pastor lets these
[39:53] girls that come back from their mission
[39:54] trips dance sinful dances he said
[39:57] because that's what they desire they're
[39:59] mine once that kind of pastor a
[40:01] compromiser and he said that's the kind
[40:04] of pastor they'll vote in and so you
[40:06] have in your in your mind you have
[40:08] conscience memory reason affection
[40:09] imagination see like memory sometimes
[40:12] you desire to remember the
[40:14] memories right that's what people are
[40:17] doing now with you know that a gentleman
[40:19] who passed away mr. Floyd people go back
[40:22] and they desire to remember in their
[40:23] minds good memories about it whenever a
[40:26] loved one that you know passes away what
[40:28] do you do you you desire to go back and
[40:30] remember oh I remember when they we had
[40:33] such a great time together and those can
[40:35] be good things but they can also be evil
[40:37] things right when Satan brings back bad
[40:39] memories we have to learn to cast those
[40:42] down in Jesus name praise God the Bible
[40:45] said cast out anything that exalts
[40:47] itself against the knowledge of God if
[40:50] not church it will become a stronghold
[40:52] in your mind it'll become a complex in
[40:55] your mind a fortress in your mind and
[40:57] that's giving Satan a place most people
[41:00] today are demon-possessed in their minds
[41:03] maybe not their bodies but their minds
[41:06] because they give place to the devil
[41:09] praise God why should they praise God
[41:11] about that but it's true it's praise God
[41:12] then that's true
[41:13] we know we are not that way we are daily
[41:17] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[41:19] to daily washing it's a daily renewing
[41:22] in the Word of God and when you start
[41:25] slipping on that you'll notice a
[41:27] difference like my cousin Adam was
[41:29] telling me he said for 10 months he was
[41:31] listening to a sermon of brother Branham
[41:32] every day he said then he took oh he
[41:34] took a couple days off and he just did
[41:36] music and he said all those temptations
[41:39] that he was battling a drug addiction
[41:41] started getting closer and closer he
[41:44] felt that demon power getting closer and
[41:46] closer so he instantly prayed and went
[41:49] back to the tapes and started listening
[41:51] the Word of God and he said all the
[41:52] power came back hey man see we got we
[41:57] have to renew our minds daily with the
[41:59] Word of God
[42:00] yes there's days you need to maybe
[42:02] listen to a little more worship music
[42:04] right to refresh your spirit but you can
[42:07] never let go on the word of God
[42:09] when you feel the enemy coming in like a
[42:12] flood the Spirit of God raises up a
[42:14] standard against it praise God it's
[42:16] through the renewing of the mind Amen
[42:18] that must be done if not then we beget
[42:21] weak in our minds and then we will start
[42:24] entertaining lies from the devil and
[42:27] so a lot of people can get faith a lot
[42:29] of people can get virtue in fact I just
[42:32] had some saints telling me recently I'm
[42:34] not going to give much details on this
[42:35] one but a recent family has fallen away
[42:40] from the message and the woman went to
[42:42] where and you know those where they call
[42:43] the yoga pants and the brother you know
[42:45] they just did evil things and they were
[42:47] really faithful but the brother was
[42:49] telling me that that the this family was
[42:51] so on fire for God so on fire and yet
[42:55] after a few years they could fall so far
[42:58] away they were so on fire but then
[43:01] they're so cold just a few years later
[43:03] why is that because each of these
[43:06] attributes are an anointing but they're
[43:09] temporary right
[43:12] faith virtue knowledge and they had all
[43:15] this knowledge and that under
[43:17] understanding and those people even
[43:18] visited our church
[43:20] not long ago we see they get this
[43:24] temporary noin ting but when they when
[43:26] they accept the lies of the devil that
[43:28] anointing of the statue brother man
[43:31] leaves them we looked at that last week
[43:33] you can have the anointing you can have
[43:35] character but then it can you can lose
[43:37] it by selling it out that's exactly
[43:40] right
[43:40] we saw remember the Bible said you can
[43:42] be sanctified but then trodden under
[43:45] foot the Son of God remember a pig can
[43:47] be washed it can be clean but then it
[43:49] can go back to the mud we don't want to
[43:52] go back to the mud praise God
[43:53] of course we're not a pig either that's
[43:55] the pig is God's foreknowledge right
[43:57] we're evil sprays God we see by God's
[44:01] foreknowledge he knew Judas was a pig
[44:03] but he got cleaned up for a while but
[44:05] then came back but we're Eagles and we
[44:07] might they might find us in the muck and
[44:10] mire of the chicken yard but God washes
[44:12] us off and then we fly in the skies and
[44:14] the heavenlies like a real eagle praise
[44:16] God so that part is for now is that the
[44:19] eagle the seed part is God's
[44:21] foreknowledge we don't always know like
[44:23] that brother was telling me they thought
[44:25] for sure that family was filled with the
[44:26] Holy Ghost
[44:26] they thought for sure that woman was
[44:28] fill with the only ghost and that that
[44:30] husband and they thought for sure but by
[44:32] their fruits you shall know them a good
[44:35] tree cannot produce corrupt fruit right
[44:39] and so it's so poor
[44:41] to know this when you have faith you
[44:43] choose the way when you have virtue you
[44:46] have you have power to live it publicly
[44:49] and then the next one is knowledge
[44:52] now knowledge is your third step it's a
[44:54] third portion of Holy Ghost anointing
[44:57] that's right and God adds this to your
[45:00] human spirit it's knowledge now in the
[45:03] Greek knowledge means understanding a
[45:05] deep understanding that belongs to
[45:08] advanced Christians about what's lawful
[45:12] and unlawful okay so God first gives you
[45:16] faith to choose the way then he gives
[45:18] you bonus on the way your virtue and
[45:21] then he helps you understand the way
[45:23] praise God he gives you a deep
[45:25] understanding of of knowledge on the way
[45:29] to to know where you're going praise God
[45:32] that's right
[45:33] amen and why why why did the white as
[45:37] his life please God and why does God
[45:39] want me to do this these are all
[45:41] questions that are answered by the
[45:43] knowledge of the Lord amen
[45:46] and this is all backed by brother Ram
[45:48] sermons that's River man because this is
[45:50] these are the points he makes so in
[45:54] order to accept knowledge from God you
[45:56] have to reject human reasoning and
[45:59] that's what my man tells us in this
[46:02] sermon if in order to accept knowledge
[46:04] you've got to turn down reasoning okay
[46:07] so reasoning is human understanding the
[46:10] way the human mind would understand God
[46:13] is wrong we don't need we already got a
[46:15] human understanding that's wrong we have
[46:17] to lose that and we have to get the mind
[46:19] of Christ amen we need the understanding
[46:23] of Jesus Christ praise God
[46:24] to understand the way why we walk this
[46:28] way why God requires these things when
[46:31] God gives us that then we've got
[46:32] knowledge amen it's a great power it's a
[46:36] great anointing amen as you'll see see a
[46:41] lot of people a lot of people
[46:44] misunderstand the sermon wisdom versus
[46:46] faith how many remember that title
[46:48] brother Branham used wisdom versus faith
[46:49] and brother my majors on human wisdom is
[46:52] wrong and we just need faith we can't
[46:54] take wisdom
[46:55] the same idea here you can't take human
[46:57] reasoning you've got to take faith in
[47:00] God's knowledge praise God so you have
[47:03] to have godly knowledge like remember
[47:07] remember of the man vessel eel in the
[47:09] time of Moses the Bible said God filled
[47:11] bezel eels mind with knowledge on how to
[47:15] make the Ark of the Covenant not only
[47:17] that the cherubims on the mercy seat
[47:19] which one of you have ever pounded gold
[47:22] before and made a cherubim is everyone
[47:24] ever made one who's ever made their
[47:27] wings to touch at the top and their
[47:29] heads bowed facing one another who's
[47:30] ever done that has anyone ever done that
[47:31] who has now as to do that I don't I
[47:34] don't know anybody that has that kind of
[47:36] knowledge but there are no doubt people
[47:39] like that but that was an anointing he
[47:41] understood how hot that the gold had to
[47:44] be how to melt it and then how to format
[47:48] how do you form gold around that so to
[47:51] make cherubims face each other how do
[47:54] you how do you make staves how do you do
[47:56] that well God gave him knowledge God
[47:59] gave him an understanding to do that and
[48:02] so God was in that God was in that
[48:05] science church let me say like this any
[48:08] good science God is in it uh remember
[48:14] last week yeah last Sunday not two
[48:17] Sundays ago when I preached on the
[48:18] surface he remember that a little bit on
[48:20] the sermon seat that was science that
[48:22] found that DNA in serpents there's DNA
[48:25] about how to build arms and legs in
[48:28] snakes every snakes got it that's a good
[48:31] that's a good thing of knowledge right
[48:33] that's a good dose of knowledge I'm glad
[48:36] they found that it proves that serpent
[48:37] seed is right it's one more proof
[48:40] there's nothing wrong with that if they
[48:43] got a medication that helps your heart
[48:44] praise God that's a little good medicine
[48:47] there if they've got something that'll
[48:49] clean out a wound and take away the
[48:51] infection thank God for that so see I
[48:55] mean all these with that we have to
[48:58] understand all these statements from
[49:01] brother Brian we have to rightly divide
[49:02] them and if you rightly divide it you'll
[49:03] see he was right but a lot of people
[49:06] misunderstand what brother Branham said
[49:09] like here's another example brother
[49:10] branham said I believe education is the
[49:12] worst is the worst detriment to society
[49:15] but then they tried to set up meetings
[49:17] for him to preach remember this about a
[49:18] man we talked about this in 1964 to
[49:21] preach the trumpets and he said well I
[49:23] can't do it because I got to take the
[49:24] kids back to Arizona so they can be in
[49:27] school since the brother Brad wasn't
[49:31] contradicting himself he was just making
[49:34] a general statement yes overall human
[49:36] education reasoning that denies creation
[49:39] is evil it's a great detriment to
[49:42] society but yet he realized the value of
[49:46] teaching your children to read and write
[49:48] and do math because then you can read
[49:50] the Bible praise God amen
[49:52] and you can understand how to how to
[49:55] work and make a living and he said when
[49:57] you do that you make life a little
[49:58] easier on this side see the smarter you
[50:01] are life can be a little bit easier now
[50:03] what that means is easier on your body
[50:05] so you can do things for God more praise
[50:09] God like I was talking to a brother I'm
[50:12] not gonna name him but if from cams
[50:13] Church it was after the second service
[50:15] and he's like I don't know how you do it
[50:17] Jesse you preach you make videos you
[50:19] write books he said I don't know how you
[50:21] do it I said it's very simple brother I
[50:23] said I can do things you can't but you
[50:27] can do things I can't and he was he was
[50:30] telling me how you know he he's he's
[50:34] into all kinds of hands-on work he says
[50:37] I get home from work and I'm cash out I
[50:39] can't do anything I said well that's
[50:40] because your jobs harder than mine I
[50:42] said there's nothing wrong with that I
[50:44] said we're just and I said you can do
[50:46] things you know he's renovated the
[50:48] church he renovated his home numerous
[50:51] occasions all kinds of things and that's
[50:54] all good knowledge you don't and so is
[50:57] right there's a knowledge for writing
[50:59] books there's a knowledge for building
[51:00] buildings and and that's all of God
[51:02] those are all good things as long as
[51:04] they serve God's purpose amen and so we
[51:09] must of them we must understand that God
[51:11] gives us knowledge for a good reason to
[51:14] glorify Him
[51:16] there's nothing wrong with knowledge a
[51:18] lot of people just misunderstanding they
[51:21] got the wrong slant on
[51:22] on quotes from brother branham remember
[51:25] God in Isaiah let me get the scripture
[51:28] here
[51:29] Isaiah 116 220 we're not going to read
[51:32] all but but God said you remember common
[51:35] reason with me that your sins that are
[51:40] scarlet may be made white God says
[51:44] common reason and if you read the book
[51:46] Church of Isaiah if you haven't read it
[51:49] do the people reason to the people get
[51:52] right with God no God tells him come use
[51:55] some knowledge and repent and do what's
[51:58] right and they turn him down they'd
[52:00] rather give their knowledge to idols and
[52:02] riches God says come use your reasoning
[52:06] skills come try to understand what
[52:09] you're doing wrong and they turn him
[52:11] down but we're the opposite amen we use
[52:14] our knowledge of God in our lives and
[52:16] are in the Word of God and we use that
[52:18] to let Jesus wash our robes white as
[52:21] snow amen
[52:23] that's right that's Isaiah chapter one I
[52:27] mean you can see it plainly in the
[52:28] scripture so see reasoning is good if
[52:34] it's God's reasoning which is called
[52:36] knowledge but reasoning with human
[52:38] reasons is evil because it rejects God's
[52:41] Word I think that's quite plain like
[52:45] Genesis 3 though this is the example
[52:47] brother Branham gives with Eve she
[52:49] reasoned against God's Word I think I
[52:52] shared this with you I think it's worth
[52:55] saying again when the serpent said
[52:57] you'll be like God knowing good and evil
[53:00] he was saying you will be the judge you
[53:02] can be equal with God and you can judge
[53:04] you're the absolute that's what he was
[53:06] saying right and so she reasoned some
[53:11] thought yeah God is hiding something
[53:13] from me and I won I can be like God and
[53:16] I need to be like God and she reasoned
[53:19] and disobeyed God's Word she should have
[53:24] just believed what it said and not
[53:26] injected the word not in there
[53:28] now there was more than not because then
[53:30] Satan added on this special new promise
[53:33] that they'd never heard of introduce
[53:35] some new
[53:36] new uh new knowledge serpent knowledge
[53:41] see it was a false claim and so and as a
[53:46] result of that is all of our gray hairs
[53:49] those of us who got it right be a mother
[53:53] that's what brother Labor's on and that
[53:54] sermon he says every siren all those
[53:57] riots is a result of reasoning against
[53:59] God's Word right the murder the cops
[54:03] murdering the innocent man it's a result
[54:05] of human reasoning remember God puts it
[54:10] on Adam - because Adam chose to fall he
[54:13] was the first one she was the see but
[54:15] Adam did it willingly we know he did it
[54:17] as a type of Christ but yet he still
[54:19] sinned he still transgressed against
[54:22] God's Word let me said I guess he's
[54:25] still reasoned with this human mind we
[54:29] know he did a good thing though as far
[54:31] as saving his wife or taking his wife
[54:34] sin upon him as a type of Christ but
[54:37] Jesus comes the other way instead of
[54:40] thinking out of this or there's things
[54:42] Satan knows that God is trying to show
[54:44] me right
[54:44] another thing that Jesus says I'm only
[54:47] gonna do what pleases the father that's
[54:49] real knowledge right there he said I
[54:52] always do God's will
[54:54] the things that please God and because
[54:58] of that Christ was exalted and he
[55:01] purchased our full Redemption if you put
[55:06] up here Romans five eighteen and
[55:07] nineteen there for us by the offence of
[55:11] one look it says one and in the context
[55:14] it's Adam now I believe because Adam and
[55:16] Eve are one and if that's wrong well
[55:19] then just Adam because Adam he knew
[55:21] better Eve didn't but the Bible Paul
[55:24] puts the blame on Adam in this scripture
[55:27] it's Romans 5:18 and nineteen there for
[55:32] us by the offence of one judgment came
[55:35] upon all men to condemnation he's
[55:37] comparing the two men right the first
[55:39] Adam and the last Adam amen grace thank
[55:42] God we got the last Adam why because
[55:45] we're coming to the last II praise God
[55:47] that's us amen the last Eve
[55:50] one who be faithful with God's Word just
[55:53] like the last animus was faithful with
[55:55] God's Word
[55:56] hallelujah even so by the righteousness
[55:59] of one the free gift came upon all men
[56:03] and the justification of life first by
[56:06] one man's disobedience he's singling out
[56:09] Adam so sinners don't let yourself get
[56:10] beat up about this you know any woman
[56:13] would have done that any man would have
[56:15] done that but the Bible puts the
[56:17] condemnation here are the disobedience
[56:20] upon a man one man's disobedience many
[56:22] were made sinners so by the obedience of
[56:26] one shall many be made righteous amen
[56:30] see Adam reason Eve reason with human
[56:34] reasoning but Jesus reasoned with the
[56:37] word and memory church he didn't need
[56:39] one miracle to overcome that lion
[56:41] serpent he just needed obedience to the
[56:44] word it's written it's written it's
[56:47] written I'm not gonna do what you're
[56:48] telling me to do I wanna do what God
[56:50] leads me to do amen you gotta worry
[56:55] about any America you know worried about
[56:57] any tongue you got don't have to worry
[56:58] about any prophecy you have to worry
[57:00] about any divine healing God will lead
[57:03] you to do it when it's time to do it
[57:04] praise God you have to worry about it
[57:07] God if you're so in tune with God then
[57:09] you're just a glove he's gonna put on
[57:10] the glove and use you for his glory we
[57:13] had a good testimony there's a 19 year
[57:15] old man there on Sunday and he came in
[57:17] he looked really mean and everything
[57:19] like that
[57:20] well I preach and I kind of mentioned
[57:21] some pornography will he come up and
[57:23] repented of his pornography you shoulda
[57:26] saw his face like he was like like he
[57:28] knew like I was there's the Holy Spirit
[57:30] preaching I'm not me I was just kind of
[57:32] I always go that route you know most
[57:34] groups of men are gonna have to
[57:35] pornography problems even in the message
[57:37] of course that's why they're so cold on
[57:40] God yeah so he comes up and brother cam
[57:44] and I were gonna pray for him and I said
[57:47] he said I'm bound by this pornography
[57:49] demon and I said well confess it now I
[57:53] say confess it to Jesus Christ so he was
[57:56] already crying his face was so red it
[57:58] was crying
[57:59] I said you confess he confessed it I
[58:01] said you want to be free he said yeah
[58:04] I said I said cam and I are gonna loose
[58:06] you from this demon in the name of Jesus
[58:08] Christ we prayed and loosed him and
[58:10] about that time Cam's wife started
[58:11] screaming like a siren in the back
[58:13] proven that those demons were leaving
[58:16] praise God and you shoulda saw him
[58:18] afterwards he was like a brand-new man
[58:20] and this is a man that had a real deep
[58:23] dark history cam told me the history a
[58:25] real deep dark history into pornography
[58:27] really deep and dark but see our God is
[58:32] so faithful I didn't know I didn't know
[58:34] him from anybody praise God but Jesus
[58:36] Christ knows everybody Amen and I said
[58:39] when you expose Satan he's got to go
[58:42] praise God
[58:43] right when you expose him and confess
[58:46] and you admit you want to be free the
[58:48] Sun is going to set you free
[58:51] amen but you got to confess and it want
[58:54] to be set free oh it's so good to see
[58:58] the power of the Holy Spirit amen
[59:00] see it's just whenever God whenever
[59:02] people want to be free that's when
[59:04] they'll be free if I could say people
[59:08] like brother Brooks was telling me last
[59:09] night I was talking to him on the phone
[59:10] he's like he's like brother Jes I've
[59:12] tried to save so many people and I
[59:13] realized I come to the conclusion I
[59:14] can't save them they got to want to be
[59:16] saved
[59:16] I said I've done the same I've been
[59:19] guilty the same every person that seems
[59:21] to fall away I take it personally but
[59:23] how come I don't fall away because I
[59:25] love Jesus if people want an excuse to
[59:28] go they're gonna go
[59:29] we can't force people to be safe we can
[59:33] point them to be saved let me say like
[59:34] this we command them to be saved because
[59:37] Jesus commanded he says enter into the
[59:40] straight gate he didn't say you might
[59:43] want to enter he said enter it was a
[59:46] direct command you're either gonna enter
[59:49] in the narrow or the broad let's go the
[59:52] narrow way praise God God Jesus commands
[59:55] us it's not well if you want to invite
[59:57] Jesus in your heart I it's it's I
[59:59] command you to repent and get those
[1:00:01] demons off you and get the anointing of
[1:00:04] the Holy Spirit and become a man that's
[1:00:06] restored unto godliness amen
[1:00:09] how do you how much time do I got him
[1:00:10] feeling pretty good twelve minutes all
[1:00:13] right
[1:00:13] thank the Lord Church it's a reality
[1:00:17] I've seen
[1:00:17] praise God over and over and over again
[1:00:19] if you want to be free it's your choice
[1:00:22] it's your free more agency God will set
[1:00:24] you free
[1:00:25] hey man I was hoping not to use my voice
[1:00:29] so loud anyway Matt what can I do I need
[1:00:34] someone I need someone to stand up in
[1:00:35] the back and say don't preach so hard
[1:00:37] your throats gonna regret it tomorrow
[1:00:39] daddy
[1:00:40] somebody said I'm saying try to stop now
[1:00:45] because I told the law remember when my
[1:00:47] voice went out over there I promised the
[1:00:49] Lord I said I vow Lord if you heal my
[1:00:51] voice I'll try to be better with my
[1:00:54] voice I don't I don't let my zeal eat up
[1:00:57] my wisdom now Jesus yeah maybe I'll just
[1:01:05] do a couple more here
[1:01:05] before we close yeah Jesus deals with
[1:01:11] the reasoning of some scribes in mark 2
[1:01:16] this is I'm gonna turn there my Bible
[1:01:17] mark 2 verse 1 the Bible said they
[1:01:21] reason in their heart against Jesus
[1:01:23] marker 2 1 to 12
[1:01:32] look at verse 6 but there were certain
[1:01:36] of the scribes sitting there and
[1:01:37] reasoning in their hearts now the
[1:01:39] scribes or some of the sneakiest ones
[1:01:41] but they ain't men because they spent
[1:01:43] their whole deck he imagined 8 hours a
[1:01:45] day just copying the Old Testament oh
[1:01:48] shout not lie and then they go out there
[1:01:54] and they lie like they're big they
[1:01:56] actually exalted themselves as far as
[1:01:58] public status above the priests because
[1:02:01] they knew the word better see so thou
[1:02:04] shalt not lie they should not lie they
[1:02:07] were lying they were lying to Jesus they
[1:02:09] were trying to deceive Jesus and so they
[1:02:12] get all upset here Jesus as a there's a
[1:02:15] palsy paralytic man here in Capernaum
[1:02:18] and Jesus preaches the word and Jesus
[1:02:24] sees their faith they open up the roof
[1:02:26] in the Peters house and they let down
[1:02:28] this this man here and Jesus
[1:02:31] I love this he sees their faith church I
[1:02:33] want I want to see your faith I want you
[1:02:36] to see my things remember faith works if
[1:02:39] you've got faith it works works is faith
[1:02:43] expressed in the head right and it all
[1:02:46] operates by love right either works your
[1:02:51] works your love makes you work for God
[1:02:53] or your love for the world makes you
[1:02:54] work for the devil one of the other and
[1:02:58] so he in verse 6 but there were certain
[1:03:01] of the scribes reasoning in their hearts
[1:03:03] why does this man speak blasphemies see
[1:03:06] they the reason they were reasoning say
[1:03:08] he's blaspheming and he wasn't who can
[1:03:14] forgive sins but God only I love this
[1:03:16] they they thought they believed men they
[1:03:18] thought he's not God everybody was I
[1:03:21] know yeah he was God manifest in the
[1:03:25] flesh amen but their reasons they came
[1:03:28] up with well he's not God he can't
[1:03:31] forgive sins and Jesus noticed their
[1:03:34] reasoning against me they're trying to
[1:03:36] find all the reasons I'm wrong you know
[1:03:41] cuz remember he's the word now right he
[1:03:44] rightly he divides soul and spirit
[1:03:46] asunder see he divided this down to
[1:03:49] their spirits he cut it down said oh I I
[1:03:51] see them reasoning in their spirits see
[1:03:54] he didn't judge their souls at this spot
[1:03:56] and say oh they're going to hell now he
[1:03:58] did later in Mark Matthew 23 he said
[1:04:00] you're the children of hell you're
[1:04:01] twofold more children the hell like your
[1:04:03] converts he said your Serpent's your
[1:04:05] generation of vipers but here the word
[1:04:07] just cuts and it divides the humans of
[1:04:09] human mind so Jesus just looks into
[1:04:12] their human mind and said your reasoning
[1:04:14] against God's Word and Jesus says in
[1:04:19] verse 8 and immediately when Jesus
[1:04:20] perceived in this spirit they so
[1:04:23] reasoned within themselves he said them
[1:04:25] why reason you these things in your
[1:04:26] hearts I had that same thing I was
[1:04:29] somebody come trying to correct me after
[1:04:30] the service on Sunday morning by a man
[1:04:32] during the fellowship and I read the
[1:04:34] night I read I'm sorry not reason I
[1:04:37] perceived he was trying to reason with
[1:04:39] me and later I found out that Joseph
[1:04:41] Branham is his pastor and you don't even
[1:04:44] go to church there
[1:04:45] but I caught that I perceived he's
[1:04:48] trying to reason and come up with a
[1:04:50] wrong a wrong reason for his actions I
[1:04:56] didn't take his correction by the way
[1:04:58] cuz I think I was right by God's grace
[1:05:00] so that's what the Holy Spirit does it
[1:05:03] helps you perceive remember discernment
[1:05:05] judges people's spirits right he said
[1:05:09] Jesus says why reason ye these things in
[1:05:11] your hearts he said whether is it easier
[1:05:13] to say to the sick a palsy thy sins be
[1:05:16] forgiven thee or to say arise and take
[1:05:17] up thy bed and walk but that ye may know
[1:05:19] there it is know the knowledge amen
[1:05:23] see Jesus knows they got the wrong
[1:05:25] knowledge so he says so you have knows
[1:05:27] in other words let me give you some
[1:05:29] knowledge amen let me give you some real
[1:05:32] godly reasons so you know that I'm doing
[1:05:36] what I'm called to do amen hallelujah he
[1:05:42] says but you may know that the Son of
[1:05:44] man has power on earth to forgive sins
[1:05:45] he said to the sick of the palsy I sing
[1:05:48] thee arise take up thy bed and go thy
[1:05:50] way into thine house and that beautiful
[1:05:55] C Church if anybody knew the Messiah was
[1:05:59] supposed to be God it would have been
[1:06:02] the scribes because Isaiah 11 he says
[1:06:06] he's the mighty God and the everlasting
[1:06:09] father right if anybody should have
[1:06:13] known it would have been them so he said
[1:06:16] so he says I see your reasoning against
[1:06:19] the word the Messiah is God in the flesh
[1:06:22] and I can forgive sins because my father
[1:06:25] dwells in me praise God Alleluia and I
[1:06:29] come in my father's name and I am the
[1:06:32] image of the invisible father there it
[1:06:35] is praise God thank you Lord so he gives
[1:06:40] him one more chance to reject their
[1:06:42] sinful reasoning and he says I'm gonna
[1:06:45] heal this man so you know that I have
[1:06:49] power on earth to forgive sins in other
[1:06:52] words I'm gonna heal him so you can try
[1:06:54] it so I'll give you a chance to receive
[1:06:55] the knowledge of God instead of the
[1:06:57] knowledge of man
[1:06:59] is that beautiful praise God I love this
[1:07:03] this well I'd say the Bible becomes a
[1:07:05] new Bible when you receive the message
[1:07:07] because you can see you can see spirit
[1:07:10] soul body
[1:07:11] Jesus breaking into the spirit by
[1:07:13] discernment he judges their reasoning
[1:07:16] right conscious memory reason reason he
[1:07:20] breaks in their human spirit and helps
[1:07:22] them to no tries to get them there know
[1:07:25] the truth and shine the knowledge of
[1:07:27] God's Word on them all right five
[1:07:29] minutes praise God okay go to Acts
[1:07:34] seventeen it's 1 to 1 to 12 this is a
[1:07:42] very familiar one in your daily prayer
[1:07:51] and Bible time reading I've been
[1:07:53] encouraging you to get a journal write
[1:07:56] out your questions you need to do that
[1:07:59] you need to you need to be inquisitive
[1:08:02] about God's Word right I always
[1:08:05] highlight circle and you know then email
[1:08:08] myself if I got a question so I can put
[1:08:09] it into a document you know so I can
[1:08:11] preach it later but you should be doing
[1:08:13] that you should be coming up with more
[1:08:16] knowledge of God all the time
[1:08:18] praise God praise God now in acts 17 one
[1:08:24] to twelve of course we're not going to
[1:08:26] read all that he gets some opposition in
[1:08:29] Thessalonica and then in verse 10 and
[1:08:31] the Brethren immediately sent away Paul
[1:08:33] incise by night unto Berea who coming
[1:08:35] thither went into the synagogue of the
[1:08:37] Jews these were more noble than those in
[1:08:41] Thessalonica in that they received the
[1:08:43] word with all readiness of mind and
[1:08:45] searched the Scriptures daily whether
[1:08:48] those things were so praise God praise
[1:08:53] God now I missed a scripture here though
[1:08:56] oh yeah I missed verse two I'm sorry
[1:08:58] yeah let's go down to verse two
[1:08:59] sonication and Paul as his manner was
[1:09:03] they look how does a missionary work in
[1:09:06] Paul how did Paul work as a missionary
[1:09:09] verse two his manner was he went in unto
[1:09:12] them and
[1:09:13] three Sabbath days reason with them out
[1:09:15] of the scriptures why wasn't he just
[1:09:19] doing miracles the whole time because he
[1:09:21] couldn't do him unless God told him to
[1:09:23] do him so what did he know for sure
[1:09:26] brother Damon if God's not going to
[1:09:27] America what what do I know for sure I
[1:09:30] should try to do get them to receive the
[1:09:33] knowledge of God amen
[1:09:35] give them reasons from this Holy Bible I
[1:09:38] know this is Jose's or what give them
[1:09:40] reasons from this Bible to believe in
[1:09:43] your God amen
[1:09:46] if God's not gonna do America he's not
[1:09:48] gonna heal the sick or raise the dead
[1:09:49] the very least we should do is give them
[1:09:52] reasons to believe hallelujah so see
[1:09:57] like brother Simon sometimes you know
[1:09:59] that first time you were at 14 baptisms
[1:10:01] that was a mighty move of God most of
[1:10:03] them went back in the world I know
[1:10:06] there's one family I think still hanging
[1:10:08] on but like let's say there was no
[1:10:11] miracle well that's okay God can still
[1:10:13] be in that because God is the one who
[1:10:16] determines when miracles happen God is
[1:10:19] the one that uses your gifts not you
[1:10:22] so Paul three weeks in a row can you
[1:10:25] imagine that sister three weeks in a row
[1:10:27] all she does is try to just do a Bible
[1:10:30] study can't you see Jesus with Isaiah 53
[1:10:33] can't you see he did Genesis 350
[1:10:35] okay it was just it was just reasoning
[1:10:37] amen it was just trying to get them to
[1:10:41] receive the knowledge of God amen and
[1:10:43] then brother hey man if they received
[1:10:45] the knowledge surely they go back and
[1:10:47] get faith in virtue
[1:10:47] right right he's trying to use knowledge
[1:10:50] to reason say you shouldn't believe
[1:10:53] we're still in the days of the Old
[1:10:55] Testament we're the New Testament he try
[1:10:57] to prove to them that Jesus Christ came
[1:10:59] and fulfilled all these promises and
[1:11:02] that now you can have a new heart a new
[1:11:04] spirit and the Holy Spirit amen
[1:11:08] he was trying to show them the Ezekiel
[1:11:09] 36 is for failed praise God you can have
[1:11:12] the Holy Spirit in your heart
[1:11:14] hallelujah I mean soul you know what I
[1:11:16] mean so see paul models reasoning just
[1:11:21] like jesus reason and gave them reasons
[1:11:24] fine I'll heal this man so you'll know
[1:11:26] and
[1:11:27] a reason to believe that I am the son of
[1:11:29] man and I can forgive sins in other
[1:11:30] words on the Messiah I am God in the
[1:11:33] flesh
[1:11:34] now Paul he just does an old-fashioned
[1:11:36] Bible study remember his part remember
[1:11:39] the parchment Paul said Paul told
[1:11:41] Timothy in his last letter he said now
[1:11:43] remember when you come in the winter
[1:11:44] makes you bring my one coat not my whole
[1:11:48] wardrobe buy one coat bring my one coat
[1:11:53] and the parchments in other words bring
[1:11:57] those empty Scrolls so I can write God's
[1:11:59] Word and send it out to the world praise
[1:12:02] God amen give them reasons to believe
[1:12:05] and give them the knowledge of God
[1:12:08] oh there's about 35 minutes that's my
[1:12:11] reminder to close that wasn't too bad
[1:12:14] was it I was pretty good I give up I'm
[1:12:18] preaching an hour and a half tonight I'm
[1:12:20] just kidding no I'm just kidding all
[1:12:24] right now no no what did they do now
[1:12:27] here's what I was saying Church in verse
[1:12:29] 11 you have to receive the word with all
[1:12:32] readiness of mind and searched the
[1:12:33] scriptures whether these things are B so
[1:12:36] now we're not up we're not borderline
[1:12:38] believers or not we are fully fledged
[1:12:41] believers but we need to search the
[1:12:43] Scriptures about the rapture right we
[1:12:46] need to search the scriptures about the
[1:12:48] baptism of the holy ghost right anything
[1:12:52] that we have a question on there or it's
[1:12:53] we don't understand or it's going to be
[1:12:56] fulfilled in the future we should search
[1:12:58] the Scriptures on that to find the
[1:13:00] reasons of the hope that we have within
[1:13:03] us like Amen this week he said he wasn't
[1:13:07] even trying to witness to his stepsister
[1:13:10] but I'm sure you saw brother Amen once
[1:13:12] it got going the answers just started
[1:13:14] flowing out of you right yeah
[1:13:17] same thing with when I witness to even
[1:13:19] when I preach sometimes I'm not even
[1:13:20] planning on preach of things but they
[1:13:22] get to a certain subject and it just
[1:13:23] starts flowing out flowing out it just
[1:13:26] it just comes right and it's God using
[1:13:30] our words as a as a fountain of water
[1:13:32] praise God to flow out so the people can
[1:13:35] have a chance to quench their spiritual
[1:13:37] thirst amen
[1:13:40] that's right because God always uses man
[1:13:44] to save man
[1:13:46] he could have preached by angels he
[1:13:49] chose to preach by fallen men redeem men
[1:13:52] by the Holy Spirit
[1:13:54] sissie Church got to search the
[1:13:56] Scriptures daily see and if you don't
[1:14:02] hunger after God's Word then you're
[1:14:04] hungry after something else you
[1:14:05] shouldn't be hungry after right if you
[1:14:10] don't hunger and satisfy that holy
[1:14:13] thirst
[1:14:13] you'll start trying to hush it by
[1:14:15] enjoying worldly pleasures right
[1:14:18] you're either feeding the white dog or
[1:14:20] the black dog and the church said I mean
[1:14:23] you're only it's a one of the other
[1:14:24] either the sin nature you're feeding or
[1:14:25] the divine nature let's feed that divine
[1:14:27] nature let's search the Scriptures daily
[1:14:31] let's listen to tape this tapes daily do
[1:14:35] what you must do to stay with God's Word
[1:14:38] alright got seven minutes so I'm gonna
[1:14:40] close with this thought and that'll be
[1:14:43] 45 minutes
[1:14:44] oh yes praise of the hardhead that
[1:14:48] worked out pretty good now these are
[1:14:50] three the Bible gives three metaphors
[1:14:53] for knowledge I forgot to bring I was
[1:14:57] gonna bring my keys keys are a metaphor
[1:14:59] of knowledge okay and this will be
[1:15:02] helpful next week as we look at the gift
[1:15:05] of knowledge because knowledge is an
[1:15:07] attribute but there's a separate gift of
[1:15:09] knowledge okay and if you have the gift
[1:15:12] of knowledge you speak God's Word and it
[1:15:15] opens doors for people or you speak
[1:15:18] God's Word sister Beatrice and it's like
[1:15:20] the darkness scatters light comes on oh
[1:15:23] now I understand it or the other one is
[1:15:26] fragrance now a lot of these fragrances
[1:15:29] today are really bad chemicals right and
[1:15:31] we're allergic to some of them but if
[1:15:34] it's a real good like a oil base you
[1:15:36] know maybe essential oil fragrance I
[1:15:38] don't know my wife oh no she wrote a
[1:15:40] book about that she know about that but
[1:15:42] if it's a healthy substance that is
[1:15:44] something you want to enjoy and you can
[1:15:47] instantly observe it and you can catch
[1:15:50] the fragrance of it and it just changes
[1:15:53] the atmosphere the
[1:15:54] right because we've all walked into
[1:15:55] rooms where they smell awful
[1:15:58] sometimes it's humans fault sometimes
[1:16:00] and the most fault there's all kinds of
[1:16:02] reasons for bad fragrances but the Bible
[1:16:05] says knowledge is like three things it's
[1:16:07] like a key a light and a fragrance in
[1:16:11] Luke 11 Jesus says you lawyers you've
[1:16:15] taken away the key of knowledge and
[1:16:17] you've not entered in yourself and then
[1:16:20] that entering you hindered and they says
[1:16:24] later Matthew 23:23 you have shut up the
[1:16:27] Kingdom of Heaven against men can you
[1:16:29] imagine that they knew Jesus was the
[1:16:32] Messiah Nicodemus said he said we know
[1:16:35] you're a master sent from God you know
[1:16:38] the reason God blinded them was because
[1:16:40] they knew he was God but they rejected
[1:16:42] him anyway that's the reason God blinded
[1:16:45] them because their unbelief so they knew
[1:16:50] they haven't they had the keys imagine
[1:16:53] that believing they had the keys to get
[1:16:54] in but they cut they were taping people
[1:16:56] out of salvation and that's why Jesus
[1:16:59] said you are of your father the devil
[1:17:02] Jesus wanted people to go in the door
[1:17:05] but they were holding the people back
[1:17:07] from entering and say don't enter or
[1:17:09] they let him do it and they're hiding
[1:17:10] the keys they go ahead I got the keys
[1:17:12] I'm not giving you the keys and that's
[1:17:15] why they were twofold more the children
[1:17:18] of hell than others before them because
[1:17:22] they knew it a member that would get
[1:17:24] greater condemnation those Pharisees
[1:17:26] Sadducees scribes lawyers in Jesus time
[1:17:28] there's a greater condemnation because
[1:17:30] the preacher was greater he was greater
[1:17:33] than Solomon he was Jesus Christ a
[1:17:35] greater than Solomon so see knowledge is
[1:17:41] like a key so meditate on that this week
[1:17:44] anytime God uses your words to open a
[1:17:47] door for someone and now they can enter
[1:17:50] into salvation or now they can enter in
[1:17:51] their deliverance right anytime God uses
[1:17:55] a word of knowledge it opens a door and
[1:17:58] somebody gets a victory somebody gets
[1:18:02] into something new they've never got
[1:18:04] into before oh yeah and there's Bible
[1:18:07] examples I'll get them
[1:18:08] next week there's lots of Bible examples
[1:18:15] now we're not going to go through all of
[1:18:17] them but member Peter had the keys to
[1:18:18] the kingdom he opened the salvation to
[1:18:20] the Jews on the day of Pentecost the
[1:18:22] Gentiles in acts 10 and the Samaritans
[1:18:26] in acts 8 he had the key it was the
[1:18:29] knowledge of God in Jesus Christ praise
[1:18:33] God
[1:18:33] now the other one is a light light
[1:18:38] knowledge is a light second Peter one
[1:18:43] three and four
[1:18:44] okay went on that's not the one second
[1:18:46] Corinthians 4:6 to seven I'm sorry honey
[1:18:49] st. Corinthians for six to seven I was
[1:18:51] looking a different passage beautiful in
[1:18:57] church there's one place this light
[1:19:00] shines in their heart and I could tell
[1:19:04] like with Adam even Adams brother was
[1:19:06] telling me he said when Adam was
[1:19:07] addicted to drugs he would always be
[1:19:09] looking to leave because he was looking
[1:19:10] for the next drug deal he said it was
[1:19:12] twitching all the time and I remember
[1:19:14] Adam can do that too not so much but but
[1:19:17] he said now he said the reason I know
[1:19:19] he's set free Matt told me this his
[1:19:21] brother is because he looks at you he
[1:19:23] said you can see peace in his eyes right
[1:19:27] you can see the Friends of God and
[1:19:29] there's no rush to get off to the next
[1:19:32] drug deal or the next whatever there's
[1:19:34] just peace you can see it on people oh
[1:19:38] yeah and that's what the light of God
[1:19:43] does God commands the light to shine out
[1:19:45] of darkness he shine where in your
[1:19:48] hearts in your minds church see that
[1:19:51] light shines and all of a sudden your
[1:19:53] mind was in darkness but now it's bright
[1:19:56] now the darkness is fleed away and now
[1:20:01] there's light there now you can see to
[1:20:05] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:20:09] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:20:12] so in other words it's like Jesus
[1:20:14] Christ's face is always in your mind
[1:20:17] amen and thank God we got a pretty close
[1:20:20] picture of what his face actually looks
[1:20:21] like
[1:20:21] right through mr. Hoffman and not the
[1:20:25] Hoffman on the piano guy that's what the
[1:20:29] Bible says it's the now that the light
[1:20:31] of knowledge when you learn about Jesus
[1:20:34] crisis powers like a light ball goes off
[1:20:37] in your mind and now all day you just
[1:20:39] think about Jesus all day he's a key
[1:20:43] he's also a light knowing him is a key
[1:20:48] and then knowing him is a light in your
[1:20:51] mind remember Paul said forgot Jesus
[1:20:57] told Paul I'm gonna use you to take the
[1:20:59] people from the power of darkness to the
[1:21:02] power of light amen that's why he would
[1:21:07] use knowledge this is what's the true
[1:21:10] this is unders this how you understand
[1:21:12] the Bible this is how you understand the
[1:21:14] Old Testament this is how you understand
[1:21:15] the New Testament that's power
[1:21:18] that's not wimpy preaching that's profit
[1:21:21] preaching the profit ball reasoning from
[1:21:24] the scriptures amen three times in a row
[1:21:27] right three Sabbath's in a row reasoning
[1:21:29] that's real Holy Spirit she's trying to
[1:21:33] shine the lights into their minds and
[1:21:37] the last one is a metaphor as a
[1:21:42] fragrance
[1:21:43] second Corinthians 2 so two chapters
[1:21:46] earlier verses 14 to 16 now thanks be to
[1:21:50] God which always causes us I love this
[1:21:54] church are you a witness to this does he
[1:21:56] always cause you to triumph are you a
[1:21:59] winner or are you a loser I'm a winner
[1:22:02] praise God amen I may have a few losses
[1:22:05] every now and then but overall I'm
[1:22:07] overcoming praise God
[1:22:09] I'm a winner I'm bound to win because
[1:22:13] Christ one for me praise God he fought
[1:22:16] the battle for me amen
[1:22:18] and he's faithful to finish what he
[1:22:20] started in my life he says always causes
[1:22:25] me to triumph I always get the victory
[1:22:27] brother I always get the victory sister
[1:22:33] Beatrice I don't know how but I always
[1:22:34] get the victory
[1:22:35] it might take a few years it might take
[1:22:39] a few months but Jesus Christ causes me
[1:22:42] to triumph amen
[1:22:43] hallelujah eventually giving to you over
[1:22:47] that spirit and makes manifest the
[1:22:50] savour of his knowledge by us in every
[1:22:53] place see everywhere they'd go they
[1:22:56] share the knowledge of God and he says
[1:22:58] it's like a fragrance for we are unto
[1:23:01] God a sweet savour unto Christ so
[1:23:05] Christ's smells our testimony in them
[1:23:10] that are saved and then that perish so
[1:23:12] see the God Jesus smells our testimony
[1:23:14] or so do sinners sinners don't like our
[1:23:17] holy smell so the one we are savour of
[1:23:20] death unto death see because we tell
[1:23:24] them to command them to get saved if
[1:23:26] they turn it down they die but the other
[1:23:32] the savour of life unto life I love
[1:23:35] seeing that one it don't happen very
[1:23:36] much anymore but I love to see my life
[1:23:38] shines and people get life I talk about
[1:23:42] Jesus Christ and they move from death to
[1:23:44] life amen hey like the brother with the
[1:23:47] pornography
[1:23:48] he went from death to life amen through
[1:23:51] the knowledge of God's Word amen
[1:23:55] that and that's a sweet-smelling God's
[1:23:59] nostrils in Christ's nostrils let's
[1:24:02] stand to our feet praise God we'll look
[1:24:10] at it again next week never
[1:24:11] underestimate musicians you can come in
[1:24:13] if you've got a song buddy let me know
[1:24:15] never underestimate just speaking God's
[1:24:17] word remember I told you I didn't even
[1:24:20] know I could be saved from chewing
[1:24:23] tobacco until I read first Corinthians
[1:24:25] 6:12 I saw I forget who shared it with
[1:24:29] me but this is my own testimony because
[1:24:32] of this scripture
[1:24:33] I got delivered from addiction it was
[1:24:36] just knowledge all things are lawful
[1:24:39] unto me but all things are not expedient
[1:24:42] all things are lawful for me but I will
[1:24:45] not be brought under the power of any
[1:24:47] when I
[1:24:48] read that sister naomi is like that
[1:24:53] that's always like for me I didn't even
[1:24:56] realize it I don't have to be under
[1:24:59] bondage to this I don't have to and I'm
[1:25:03] not supposed to praise God and I have
[1:25:07] power to not be brought under it praise
[1:25:10] God and I started seeing that little tin
[1:25:12] as how is this little plastic tin
[1:25:14] defeating me a child of God and it
[1:25:17] wasn't long after that Haven to the Holy
[1:25:19] Spirit deliver me from it praise God
[1:25:21] instead of that tin ruling over me i
[1:25:24] triumphed over it praise God because
[1:25:28] Jesus Christ always causes us to triumph
[1:25:31] in Christ amen through the knowledge I
[1:25:36] just had to know the scripture and then
[1:25:39] it was like a light went on I don't have
[1:25:41] to keep doing this I don't have to get
[1:25:43] mouth cancer someday I can be cancer
