[30:59] messages lord we can truly see how there
[31:01] has to be a bride church somewhere lord
[31:03] god
[31:04] everyone's claiming to be the whole book
[31:06] of revelation is about a true bride and
[31:07] then an imposter bride
[31:09] lord the whole the whole plan of
[31:11] redemption is about this subject there's
[31:13] got to be a true bride
[31:14] and lord by your grace we believe we're
[31:16] a part of that
[31:17] so father wash us here tonight and and
[31:19] bless us and help us

[31:46] have preeminence we pray
[31:47] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[31:49] said amen god bless you as you're being
[31:51] seated praise god
[32:04] okay so tonight we'll look at uh more on
[32:07] the church as the bride we'll probably
[32:09] have a couple more services on this one
[32:11] i forgot to let the church know on
[32:12] sunday too i put a new youtube video out
[32:14] on sunday afternoon
[32:16] and it's about the sixth vision is the
[32:18] sixth vision fulfilled
[32:20] and my answer is no i don't think so at
[32:22] least not yet it's in the process of
[32:24] coming to pass so i've got
[32:25] i got some good feedback on that and
[32:27] people really appreciate that
[32:29] so i've been thankful i'll just try to
[32:31] rehearse it real quick i don't think the
[32:33] fourth vision is fulfilled because
[32:34] brother branham said the church age book
[32:35] we're still
[32:36] awaiting the road systems uh we don't
[32:39] even have the driverless cars yet we're
[32:41] getting close
[32:42] there's a couple uh the waymo company
[32:44] out there in arizona and california they
[32:45] do have driverless cars right now
[32:48] but it's just they're kind of testing
[32:50] them um
[32:52] but the road systems brother ramsay were
[32:54] still awaiting them so they weren't on
[32:56] the scene yet
[32:58] and he said they're either all come to
[32:59] pass or they're in the process of coming
[33:01] to pass
[33:01] the fifth vision now brother brown said
[33:03] to be a fifth vision would be a state of
[33:05] undress amongst the women
[33:07] now this one i don't know i still don't
[33:09] think it's fulfilled but it could be
[33:10] um i was thinking more like you know
[33:13] brother ram saw the vision of the women
[33:15] that had like he said plastic
[33:17] transparent dresses that had three spots
[33:20] darken you know the three main parts
[33:22] of a woman there uh i would just think
[33:25] that would be more like a public thing
[33:26] but
[33:27] it could be we are in the state of
[33:28] undress could be i don't know i just
[33:30] felt like
[33:31] if he saw the vision that we'd have to
[33:33] see it i don't know anybody that's seen
[33:34] that out in public
[33:36] um so that's what i put on there and
[33:38] then i just don't think the sixth vision
[33:39] is fulfilled
[33:40] brother bram said to be a most beautiful
[33:42] woman most beautiful woman
[33:44] most people don't think she's very
[33:45] beautiful miss harris
[33:48] uh the other thing was
[33:51] brother braham said she'd get in by a
[33:53] popular vote of women and we know there
[33:55] was voter fraud and we know they didn't
[33:56] win the election
[33:57] they did all the fraud to win the
[33:59] election that's that's all the facts are
[34:01] true there
[34:02] uh what was the third one there there
[34:04] was no one more thing i thought about oh
[34:06] she doesn't have
[34:06] she doesn't have total power uh the
[34:10] vision said
[34:10] the whole nation would bow to this woman
[34:13] and bowing in the bible's worship
[34:14] because every knee shall bow and every
[34:15] tongue confess
[34:17] that jesus is lord so the nation has to
[34:19] bow and confess whatever this beautiful
[34:21] woman is whether she's the catholic
[34:22] church or
[34:23] a future woman president or something
[34:25] like that
[34:27] i just don't think based upon those
[34:29] details of the vision that it's
[34:30] fulfilled
[34:31] of course a lot of people do what
[34:34] happens with most message people they
[34:36] a lot not most i should say some they
[34:38] want to try to jump ahead and they want
[34:39] to be the first to
[34:40] have a revelation right they want to be
[34:42] the first i was the first one that
[34:44] knew the prophecy was fulfilled or
[34:46] something but i think it's always best
[34:47] to wait
[34:48] i just found that it's best to wait
[34:50] everybody's jumped to all these
[34:52] conclusions and thought well that's 2009
[34:55] or 2015 and 2018 they all make all these
[34:59] guesses and
[35:00] i just don't want to get in the habit of
[35:01] that i want to i just wait upon the lord
[35:03] so i just put that out recently hope
[35:04] that
[35:05] would be a blessing to us i've kind of
[35:07] preached it here
[35:08] next i'm working on the clarence larkin
[35:10] video i'm going to show brother brandon
[35:12] used clarence larkin quite a bit
[35:13] and he didn't always reference him but
[35:15] it's not plagiarism because plagiarism
[35:17] is when you
[35:18] you steal it and you don't mention it
[35:20] and you say it was all original
[35:22] but we have so many quotes brother
[35:23] brahms says uh he used all these books
[35:26] he names at least six or seven books
[35:27] at the beginning of preaching the church
[35:29] age book he lists he says there's about
[35:31] six or seven he lists three or four
[35:34] um and you can see the exact quotes i
[35:36] have i have larkin's book electronically
[35:37] you can see the exact quotes brother
[35:39] brandon used many
[35:39] exact quotes from clarence larkin but
[35:42] then there's a quote brother ram said
[35:43] i'm very
[35:44] grateful to dr larkin for his views so
[35:46] there's a quote on that
[35:48] but they're making it sound like he
[35:49] plagiarized everything and
[35:51] uh and said brother branham uh never
[35:54] referenced him well he did it just
[35:55] wasn't exactly in every sermon he didn't
[35:57] reference him but there was
[35:58] numerous times he did reference the
[36:00] people he used
[36:02] and church remember a seventh grade
[36:03] educated man probably can't
[36:05] write a good document right and
[36:07] reference everything
[36:09] he's not that scholarly trained right uh
[36:12] now level may have been maybe libreo
[36:14] should have been
[36:15] if he was a real doctor i don't know if
[36:18] he was or not
[36:19] um so yeah maybe that was more of
[36:22] maybe that was more of lee vale's kind
[36:24] of failure there i don't know
[36:25] i wasn't there just that you know that's
[36:28] kind of what we're studying on next by
[36:29] god's grace so
[36:30] praise the lord well i want to just
[36:34] start with st
[36:34] patrick since today's st patrick's day
[36:38] america has totally lost the reasoning
[36:40] behind the saint patrick's day
[36:42] today it's a day of folly it's a day of
[36:44] drunkenness it's a day of revelry
[36:47] it's an absolute disgrace to the man who
[36:49] was a saint
[36:51] saint patrick so i studied on him this
[36:52] summer and i used
[36:55] uh one resource it was
[36:58] hazeltine rachel hazeltine it's the book
[37:01] she's the woman historian brother
[37:02] branham used
[37:03] in the church ages in fact that was the
[37:05] most uh history i found
[37:08] that's the resource brother brad used
[37:09] most was rachel hasselton and he says it
[37:11] in there
[37:12] a woman he said rachel has a time so
[37:14] brother ram read a woman's book
[37:16] to get a lot of the genuine history so
[37:18] let's just go over this real quick uh
[37:22] he lived from 372 to 461
[37:25] uh a.d his given name was suckat
[37:28] or sukkat he's a saint from the
[37:31] pergamian age
[37:33] and like jesus said he held on jesus
[37:35] name and he kept his faith
[37:37] because that was the command of the
[37:39] church age patrick was
[37:41] robbed of his childhood i think he was
[37:43] well they say around 14.
[37:45] one article says 14 but he was robbed of
[37:48] his childhood in a way
[37:49] he and his two sisters were kidnapped
[37:51] and sold as slaves
[37:53] and patrick was taken to northern
[37:55] ireland to herd swine
[37:58] and he used dogs there but it was there
[38:01] in ireland where he repented
[38:02] and he was converted by god's spirit
[38:04] history says he didn't have any man
[38:06] there
[38:07] to preach to him so god converted him
[38:09] praise god
[38:10] god came looking for him amen and he
[38:12] converted there as a swine herder
[38:15] well with dogs and uh
[38:18] history says that uh then the holy
[38:20] spirit told him your ship awaits
[38:22] you and so he went to get on his ship
[38:24] and then brother brown said he had the
[38:26] dogs
[38:26] trained so well he he kind of sold the
[38:29] dogs to the shipmaster but then he snuck
[38:32] on and hit himself
[38:33] and had he had a certain noise for the
[38:35] dogs to kind of hide him but once the
[38:37] boat was off and then he
[38:39] he gave the signal and the dogs went
[38:41] crazy and everything and
[38:42] and uh he said the dogs are going to
[38:45] destroy everything unless you let me
[38:46] go on the on the ride or on the boat
[38:48] that was heading back to england
[38:50] and so he said of course we'll let you
[38:52] stay and so then he got the dogs back
[38:54] under control
[38:56] when he got back to england he then went
[38:59] to france
[39:00] and he enrolled in his uncle martin's
[39:03] bible school
[39:04] this is the same martin who was the
[39:06] church age messenger
[39:08] to the pergamon church age
[39:12] and let me get a little bit about martin
[39:13] just a little bit martin was such a
[39:15] mighty man of god
[39:17] uh
[39:20] he was taught by saint hillary well he's
[39:23] not called saint but hillary
[39:24] uh from france he was a mighty man of
[39:27] god
[39:28] he converted his pagan mother and sister
[39:32] to christianity this is martin now the
[39:34] church age messenger
[39:35] and then he built a school and this was
[39:38] a school
[39:38] plus a prayer chapel and so many men
[39:42] were trained up of god in this school
[39:44] and sent forth
[39:45] from uh by the holy spirit to do great
[39:47] works in jesus name
[39:49] there in france god performed so many
[39:52] miracles in martin's ministry
[39:54] uh it was because he didn't dedicate
[39:56] himself to prayer study
[39:58] uh fasting uh now this is the history
[40:01] from hazeltine
[40:03] again brother madam use hazeltine uh
[40:06] god used such great miracles that the
[40:08] laws of nature were
[40:10] defied and they they were
[40:13] used by god used martin to stand against
[40:15] idolatry
[40:17] and you probably you might remember this
[40:18] from the church ages uh
[40:20] doors were supernaturally opened just
[40:23] based upon martin's prayer so doors
[40:25] of us of a city or structure compound
[40:28] were opened by the power of god
[40:30] and history says golden light actually
[40:34] shone from his body and the dead were
[40:37] raised to life so it's like moses how he
[40:39] was shown
[40:40] the light shone this is what the rachel
[40:42] hasselton wrote
[40:43] he has literal history of him his face
[40:46] shining with the glory of god
[40:47] and they'd ra he'd raise the dead
[40:51] she said the best way to describe his
[40:53] life from his conversion
[40:55] to his death was one constant miracle
[40:58] how would you like that to be the
[40:59] description of your life one
[41:01] it was just one miracle from the time he
[41:03] got saved all the way till he died
[41:05] he was his life was a constant miracle
[41:08] uh he traveled 300 miles to plead with
[41:12] spanish bishops for the life of one
[41:14] friend he drove
[41:15] or he traveled three not drove it might
[41:17] have drove horses but he traveled
[41:18] 300 miles to plead for one soul of one
[41:22] friend
[41:25] he refused any fellowship with the first
[41:28] church of rome
[41:29] he saw how rome's man-made creeds their
[41:32] idolatry their killing their lies
[41:34] left the roman church powerless of the
[41:36] holy spirit
[41:37] and as a testament to the holy ghost on
[41:39] him many sick
[41:40] touched his tomb and were healed
[41:46] and just like elisha's bones in second
[41:48] kings 13
[41:50] 21 and this says he was
[41:53] uh never canonized by rome but he was
[41:55] canonized by god
[41:58] amen now that's martin right that's
[42:00] that's patrick's
[42:01] uncle patrick's uncle now let's get back
[42:04] to patrick
[42:05] so after patrick got on the boat there
[42:07] the dogs covered him and he got on loose
[42:09] he went to his uh uncle martin's bible
[42:11] school
[42:12] he grew in grace and faith and then he
[42:15] had the leadership of the holy ghost to
[42:17] take the gospel to ireland where he was
[42:19] once a slave
[42:21] and he took many ministers over there as
[42:23] well and they saw the holy ghost do many
[42:26] miraculous miracles
[42:27] in fact one barbarian chief one of the
[42:29] first ones he saw so many miracles
[42:33] in patrick's life that he and his entire
[42:36] house repented and received christ
[42:38] imagine a whole family repenting a
[42:40] heathen just heathen plain heathens on
[42:42] ireland's uh
[42:44] the isle there the emerald isle they
[42:46] repented just because they saw a miracle
[42:48] after miracle after miracle
[42:50] in a man's life amen beautiful testimony
[42:54] of
[42:54] patrick history records
[42:58] also uh that he took up serpents
[43:01] we know there's a lot of serpents on uh
[43:02] the ir the isle of ireland
[43:05] but he took up many and he was never
[43:07] hurt by them
[43:09] just like jesus said you'll take up
[43:10] serpents and they will not hurt you
[43:12] he laid on his hands on the sick and
[43:14] they recovered by jesus's faith just
[43:17] like his
[43:17] uncle martin did
[43:21] one time patrick was approached by an
[43:24] embassy from rome
[43:26] and they wanted him to come visit but he
[43:28] refused because they knew their
[43:30] wickedness he knew they were going to
[43:31] try to get him to
[43:32] compromise right that's what they always
[43:33] do they try to give you money and
[43:35] power and authority but he turned them
[43:38] down flatly imagine that he turned out
[43:40] all those
[43:41] uh money all the prestige all the power
[43:44] he turned that down and he just stayed
[43:47] there
[43:47] in ireland for god's glory in fact it is
[43:50] believed the entire island received the
[43:53] pure gospel
[43:54] of the lord jesus christ through
[43:56] patrick's efforts that's hasselton's
[43:58] history there the whole island receive
[44:02] the gospel
[44:03] now sadly a hundred thousand of
[44:07] patrick's spiritual children
[44:09] were slaughtered through the roman
[44:11] jesuits in 1640.
[44:14] so that was about
[44:17] 164. that was about 1200 years after his
[44:20] death
[44:21] so see because rome couldn't get him uh
[44:24] they came
[44:25] 1200 years later and just destroyed the
[44:27] whole island well not the line but i'm
[44:28] sorry destroyed 100 000 of a spiritual
[44:31] converts
[44:33] but church we know if you have genuine
[44:35] faith in jesus
[44:36] christ's name then you receive a
[44:38] martyr's crown in heaven amen
[44:40] a hundred thousand so that if that was
[44:42] just a hundred thousand of his uh
[44:44] converts uh were were martyred there
[44:47] how many more converts to that one man
[44:50] have
[44:51] that one man have and that's the history
[44:53] i got from
[44:54] hassletime now today it's all it's all
[44:56] tommy rock can i say it like that
[44:59] uh the the chicago uh the city of
[45:02] chicago put
[45:03] green dye in the river today right to
[45:06] celebrate
[45:06] they do that to celebrate all the irish
[45:08] people in chicago
[45:10] they'll they'll spray their hair green
[45:12] right
[45:13] uh though the kids today all the kids
[45:16] come in today dressed like leprechauns
[45:18] or
[45:19] and the teachers act like leprechauns
[45:21] invaded the school we had a teacher that
[45:23] does that every year
[45:24] they kick over their trash and they put
[45:25] glitter and and stars everywhere
[45:28] and today there's nothing about it
[45:30] there's nothing about patrick as really
[45:32] being a man of god that he was but this
[45:34] was a man
[45:34] who cast out devils this was the man who
[45:37] prayed for the sick and they
[45:38] recovered this is a man that was bitten
[45:40] by serpents and just like paul
[45:42] cast him down and never had a problem
[45:44] because he was a man
[45:45] filled with the holy ghost and fire amen
[45:47] but they leave all that out right they
[45:49] leave all that out
[45:50] they forget that this is the reason why
[45:54] we rej or america had a holiday for this
[45:57] man
[45:58] because he left everything and he
[46:00] converted an entire
[46:01] island for the gospel of jesus christ
[46:04] amen
[46:04] so that's the reason why this nation
[46:06] started uh
[46:08] honoring this man not because of
[46:11] leprechauns and shamrocks and things
[46:13] like that
[46:14] now it was said that he didn't teach you
[46:16] know god was a father-son holy ghost uh
[46:18] through the shamrock
[46:19] they do say that which that that that's
[46:22] actually closer than that's
[46:23] that's actually pretty close right three
[46:25] manifestations it's still one it's still
[46:27] one plant
[46:28] right it's still one uh leaf but it's
[46:30] got three parts to it that's right
[46:32] god is one person but he's got three
[46:33] manifestations right or three offices
[46:35] brother ram says
[46:36] so you can still use that it's not three
[46:39] separate plants right it's one plant
[46:42] god's not three persons he's one person
[46:44] amen
[46:45] so we see a great uh a great example of
[46:48] christianity from uh patrick a wonderful
[46:51] man of god
[46:53] and broadband talks about him a lot in
[46:55] the church age book as well so
[46:56] uh that's that's great okay now we'll
[46:58] move on here let's go back to the
[47:00] uh the mystery of uh the
[47:03] church as the bride so let's see i got
[47:06] give me 30 minutes here we'll preach
[47:08] about 30 minutes on this
[47:09] okay you've got your bibles uh let's go
[47:11] to first samuel
[47:12] let's look at hannah we ended with macau
[47:14] or
[47:16] i'm not sure exactly how to say that
[47:17] macau last week
[47:19] and it taught us that we should get in
[47:21] the spirit
[47:22] we should be loudly worshiping praying
[47:24] at times there's times to be quiet of
[47:26] course
[47:27] there's a time and season for everything
[47:28] praise god and we should use our bodies
[47:30] our emotions
[47:31] despite any reproach that anybody says
[47:35] and let's not be a judas iscariot or a
[47:37] macao let's be a david who gets in the
[47:39] holy ghost praise god
[47:41] that's a great lesson to learn
[47:45] churches that don't do that they will be
[47:47] blind i'm sorry
[47:48] they'll be barren childless and no one
[47:51] ever be born again by the holy ghost
[47:53] we've got to be the ones uh that pray
[47:55] through
[47:56] right that cry out that that that
[47:59] shout and holler amen and don't mind uh
[48:02] how we act right we we want to forget
[48:04] when anybody's around we just want to
[48:06] make sure we know jesus is around praise
[48:08] god
[48:08] we just want to act like jesus is in the
[48:10] house praise god amen
[48:13] the bible said wherever jesus went it
[48:14] was noise abroad that he was there right
[48:16] you couldn't keep him quiet right
[48:18] because they knew jesus was there so you
[48:20] couldn't keep people quiet they just oh
[48:21] jesus is coming
[48:22] the healer's coming the messiah is
[48:23] coming the savior's coming the son of
[48:25] david's coming
[48:26] you couldn't keep them quiet because
[48:28] jesus was a man of power amen
[48:30] a man of love amen thank god
[48:35] okay so we look at hannah let's look at
[48:37] hannah now what does hannah teach
[48:39] the bride today hannah was the wife of
[48:42] alcanna
[48:44] and mother of the prophet samuel and
[48:46] she's best known for desperately
[48:48] and emotionally seeking god for a child
[48:52] that uh she wouldn't be barren right
[48:55] she's known for pouring out her soul
[48:58] before the lord in prayer for a natural
[49:02] child for a natural child
[49:05] right eli then comes in while she's
[49:09] praying and mistakes her emotion
[49:11] for drunkenness that's a great type on
[49:13] the day of pentecost
[49:15] he said what are these new wine they say
[49:17] we're not drunk this is what joel said
[49:19] this is that which joel spoke of praise
[49:21] god
[49:22] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[49:24] amen
[49:25] see there's a great connection there to
[49:26] being filled with the holy ghost
[49:28] and looking like a drunk person praise
[49:31] god
[49:31] that's why we believe if someone gets
[49:33] the holy ghost something's got to happen
[49:34] to them some type of emotion
[49:36] something has to happen because even
[49:38] here it was foreshadowed it was typed
[49:40] that
[49:40] some emotional change has to happen
[49:42] right if you because remember that's
[49:44] what the holy ghost is it's a nature
[49:46] change
[49:46] right god bless you nature that's a
[49:48] great name it's a nature change and
[49:50] brother
[49:51] said your nature is dead and dead in sin
[49:54] until the holy ghost comes
[49:55] and then you get a holy nature praise
[49:57] god you get
[49:59] life you get god's life as your nature
[50:01] amen
[50:03] and so how can something not happen
[50:05] praise god right
[50:06] something has to happen when the nature
[50:08] goes from death the bible said dead in
[50:10] sins right and then but then you get the
[50:12] nature the name
[50:13] the the soul gets quickened made alive
[50:16] by the holy spirit something has to
[50:18] happen praise god
[50:19] amen but eli thinks oh she's just drunk
[50:22] and she's no
[50:23] she said i'm pouring out my soul before
[50:26] the lord that's why i encourage young
[50:27] people
[50:28] our teenagers that's what you gotta do
[50:30] you gotta seek god and you gotta pour
[50:31] out your soul you gotta get in
[50:32] desperation from the holy spirit praise
[50:34] god
[50:35] it's something you gotta be desperate
[50:36] and it's just not something you walk
[50:37] into it's something you're seeking
[50:39] you're seeking the new birth you're
[50:41] seeking to be born again praise god
[50:43] you're desperate you're hungry jesus
[50:45] said you got to be hungry and thirsty
[50:47] for righteousness amen
[50:49] it's something you got to move into
[50:51] right just like a natural birth it's
[50:52] something the woman has moved
[50:54] into right uh the birth pains get
[50:56] shorter
[50:57] it's a it's just something that takes
[50:59] over the woman right it's
[51:00] something natural something inside and
[51:02] that's what the
[51:03] the birth pains of being born again they
[51:06] get closer and closer until they're born
[51:07] again of the holy spirit
[51:09] amen hallelujah
[51:13] and because eli sees this after he
[51:16] listens to her explain her desire
[51:19] he gets led by the holy spirit and he
[51:20] says god's heard you
[51:22] god's approved of and he's going to
[51:24] answer your requests and your vow
[51:26] think about that man this this man later
[51:28] you know he he got
[51:29] too heavy he ate too much food didn't
[51:31] take care of himself lost his eyesight
[51:33] uh was almost blinded but at this spot
[51:37] of his life he was still
[51:39] he could still uh discern the holy
[51:41] spirit and he got
[51:42] anointed by the holy spirit and
[51:44] basically prophesied and said you
[51:46] you have what you asked for of course we
[51:48] know according to time of life
[51:50] uh she conceived hannah conceived
[51:53] brought forth samuel
[51:54] and she weaned samuel uh until she
[51:58] took him there to leave him at the house
[52:00] of god
[52:01] what kind of amazing faith is that
[52:03] praise god
[52:04] lord if you give me a son i'll give him
[52:07] back to you and i'm just not talking a
[52:08] prayer of dedication
[52:10] i'm talking about i'm going to leave him
[52:12] in the house of god for service that's
[52:14] real desperation praise god
[52:16] reminds us of that one gentleman who
[52:18] made the desperate vow
[52:19] for his daughter i can't remember his
[52:22] name now
[52:23] was it jaffna jeff jeffna
[52:26] i could never say that name jeff not now
[52:29] i don't believe she was killed i just
[52:30] believe she lost the ability to be uh
[52:32] married that's what i believe as far as
[52:34] because why would god ask a
[52:36] you know a husband or a daddy to keep
[52:38] his word you know to lose his daughter i
[52:40] don't i don't see how
[52:41] that could be in the scripture but
[52:44] anyways
[52:47] hannah here keeps her promise and after
[52:49] samuel's wean
[52:51] she sews in mako a prisco and ephodon
[52:53] and takes him to the house of god
[52:56] right it's such a beautiful story of uh
[52:59] of this is uh spiritually what we've got
[53:01] to do as parents we've got to raise our
[53:04] children and we've got to put them in
[53:05] the hands of god
[53:06] god i don't know that's what my mom told
[53:08] me i was talking to my mom
[53:10] last year and i said mom how did you you
[53:12] know because i was talking about lydia i
[53:13] said how can i let lydia get a car you
[53:15] know
[53:16] how can i let her drive a car you know
[53:17] she's my baby you know and
[53:19] my mom's like jesse you just got to pray
[53:21] and let him go in the hands of god i'm
[53:23] like
[53:23] easier said than done
[53:26] uh you know because my mom drove me to
[53:29] akron and dropped me off after
[53:30] 18 years to have me she just dropped me
[53:32] off and left me i don't know how she did
[53:33] that
[53:34] that takes a special kind of love i
[53:36] guess with your you naomi and wesley
[53:38] leaving their parents you know they can
[53:39] kind of
[53:40] their parents can relate to that leaving
[53:41] everything
[53:43] and that was it was difficult but that's
[53:45] what hannah did she was
[53:47] she if amen if god was going to keep his
[53:49] word she was going to keep her word amen
[53:52] hallelujah that's what we should do if
[53:53] we make a promise we ought to keep it by
[53:55] god's grace
[53:57] amen now
[54:00] for time's sake i guess i won't read
[54:02] that but here's the lessons we learned
[54:04] we learned the value of natural children
[54:06] and spiritual children i preached on
[54:08] this many times but
[54:09] most churches allow the killing of
[54:11] babies through abortion pills right and
[54:12] i put that in the book
[54:13] so that people will be able to see that
[54:15] but true churches of god
[54:17] they despise natural death right
[54:20] they despise that and they value all
[54:22] life
[54:24] because we're children of life amen
[54:28] remember birth control pills prevent
[54:30] fertilized
[54:31] uh embryos from attaching to the uterine
[54:34] wall
[54:35] that's the natural but spiritual bride
[54:38] churches
[54:38] are desperate to see new life come forth
[54:42] uh in the natural and spiritual womb of
[54:44] the church
[54:46] praise god like there's a church not
[54:48] there's a church up here
[54:50] mega church used to be a mega church
[54:52] just a few miles up the road on route
[54:54] 77.
[54:56] uh and then you go on route 8. there's a
[54:58] church up there it used to be big time
[54:59] during the 50s and 60s that's the one
[55:01] that has the
[55:02] restaurant that wasn't finished i'm not
[55:04] sure if you know which one i'm talking
[55:05] about it was the one of the first
[55:06] uh churches on tv so it's like uh it was
[55:09] like the original mega church
[55:13] well after that original gentleman left
[55:16] the guy that came in had all those
[55:18] people and he told them the
[55:20] lord is so so near he said don't have
[55:22] any children.
[55:26] and out of that has come forth some
[55:28] really wicked things
[55:29] they have now they have i think over 20
[55:32] abuse cases
[55:33] where the pastor and the different ones
[55:35] there have abused people and
[55:37] it's been really awful and now look how
[55:40] the devil the man says
[55:41] uh if the devil can't get you from
[55:44] seeing the truth he'll push you real far
[55:46] off on it
[55:47] so they were able to see the coming of
[55:49] the lord is soon of course they don't
[55:50] follow brother or anything like that
[55:52] but because uh they still love the
[55:54] things of the world the devil is able to
[55:55] push them over to the side of well don't
[55:57] have children
[55:58] the rapture is going to come and now
[55:59] most of that generation is dying all
[56:01] that
[56:02] all that generation that didn't have
[56:03] kids they're dying look there's no their
[56:05] their name is not carried on right
[56:06] they have no inheritance right they have
[56:08] no offspring to kind of carry on the
[56:10] name and
[56:10] and be uh the next generation for jesus
[56:13] in other words the church is dying
[56:15] right but we don't know when jesus is
[56:17] coming so we gotta pray we gotta put
[56:19] footprints in the sands of time in case
[56:21] there is another generation praise god
[56:24] but see that church is gonna die and
[56:26] there's nobody to carry on the torch for
[56:27] jesus
[56:29] because they're all not deceived right
[56:31] and it's going to be hard for
[56:32] any many of those any of them to be
[56:34] saved because they went so far also on
[56:36] this false doctrine and now it's tied to
[56:37] money
[56:38] and saying on the tv but they started
[56:40] out good it was a blessing brother
[56:42] brothers were telling me there's a
[56:43] blessing when it was the original was
[56:44] old-fashioned and
[56:46] and they prayed and they they really
[56:48] preached the gospel simple gospel
[56:50] get saved repent be baptized fill with
[56:52] the spirit
[56:54] but see that's what happened when a
[56:55] church despises the natural babies
[56:58] but church we don't despise the natural
[57:00] we receive the natural praise god
[57:02] but here's what we have to do we have to
[57:04] be more desperate for spiritual babies
[57:06] being born
[57:08] that's what we've got to do i know i
[57:11] said last week how many there's been
[57:12] numerous times three or four times i
[57:14] prayed lord send the holy ghost to akron
[57:15] for jesus's sake
[57:17] now i think after each time somebody did
[57:19] get filled with the holy ghost
[57:20] and so i want to be led by the holy
[57:22] spirit uh to have a burden for that
[57:25] praise god because if somebody's really
[57:28] filled with the holy ghost you'll see
[57:29] their new life right it's a new life
[57:32] it's uh like we said a nature that was
[57:34] dead but now it's a living nature it's
[57:35] god's nature praise god
[57:37] and it just brings new life into the
[57:39] church praise god
[57:41] amen so see we learn these lessons
[57:46] from hannah's life if we want to see
[57:49] life
[57:49] in the natural or life in the spiritual
[57:52] we got to be desperate for the lord now
[57:53] remember jose and i prayed for two
[57:55] barren couples and we desperately prayed
[57:58] in tears
[57:59] and god heard both of them and now they
[58:01] can quote and
[58:02] i think that one of them sent me this
[58:03] quote first samuel 1 27 for this child i
[58:07] prayed
[58:07] and the lord hath given me my petition
[58:10] which i asked of him praise god amen
[58:13] hallelujah that's right natural couples
[58:16] i wonder the couple share that with me
[58:18] for this child i prayed amen and god has
[58:21] given me the petition
[58:23] which i ask how many thankful that god
[58:25] hears our prayers
[58:27] remember the bible said children are a
[58:29] reward
[58:30] not a trial children are a reward if you
[58:33] love them
[58:34] if you don't love them there'll be a
[58:35] trial if you love them they'll be a
[58:37] blessing praise god i know i was a child
[58:39] of my mom so mom forgive me
[58:42] making a heart on you if i ever made a
[58:43] heart on you i'm sure i did a couple
[58:44] times
[58:45] probably more than that but the word
[58:47] reward in hebrew means a payment of a
[58:49] contract
[58:51] or a salary your children are your
[58:53] salary from the lord
[58:56] amen we're singing that song i'm rich
[58:58] but not from satan wages
[59:00] [Laughter]
[59:02] i think about that till right now amen
[59:04] i'm rich in these little arrows the lord
[59:06] has given me praise god
[59:08] my wife and i thank the lord
[59:11] they're a reward of the lord at psalms
[59:13] 127
[59:15] the fruit of the womb is his reward
[59:19] or salary from god
[59:23] praise god like my mom was telling me
[59:25] the last time i remember when she had
[59:26] that kidney stone
[59:27] she said uh you know she was talking
[59:29] about the different blessings all the
[59:31] children have been
[59:33] so one of my brothers he while she went
[59:36] into the hospital to get the
[59:37] the surgery my one of my brothers sat in
[59:40] the parking lot
[59:41] all night and just stayed awake all
[59:43] night
[59:45] just sat there and praying and waiting
[59:47] for my mom to come out and then when she
[59:48] come out
[59:49] uh he picked her up and took her to my
[59:51] sister's house and then
[59:52] my sister took care of him she said i
[59:54] couldn't be taken care of any better
[59:56] i just look at that and then you know my
[59:58] mom told me about some of the other
[59:59] brothers that have helped with money and
[1:00:00] and plumbing and all these things
[1:00:04] and it proves that children are a reward
[1:00:08] they're a payment praise god they're
[1:00:10] god's payment
[1:00:11] god's blessing to you as his servants
[1:00:13] amen
[1:00:15] praise god so my mom in other words was
[1:00:17] telling me all the salary she's earned
[1:00:18] from having all these kids praise god
[1:00:21] so that's what the word says the bible
[1:00:23] said they're a payment
[1:00:25] and what's interesting too i just got my
[1:00:27] irs payment this morning
[1:00:30] from the government and it's a it's a
[1:00:32] larger sum because i have more children
[1:00:36] so it's just interesting how things work
[1:00:38] out when i'm preaching on that today i'm
[1:00:40] just planning on preaching that
[1:00:41] this is the day it comes in the the bank
[1:00:43] account
[1:00:44] interesting all right so now get your
[1:00:47] bible if you would go to galatians 4 19.
[1:00:52] this is a very peculiar scripture rush
[1:00:55] maybe interesting or
[1:00:56] i should say maybe mysterious would be
[1:00:57] the better word so lydia get galatians
[1:00:59] 419 malachi
[1:01:01] hebrews 4 1. would you um lydia
[1:01:04] galatians 4 19 and then malachi hebrews
[1:01:06] 4 verse 1.
[1:01:07] now before we read this as i said church
[1:01:10] we've got to be willing to pray
[1:01:11] earnestly for new converts to be born
[1:01:13] again
[1:01:14] by the holy ghost baptism
[1:01:18] because acts chapters 1 and 2 show 120
[1:01:22] converts the bible said they went into
[1:01:25] an upper room now i don't know what kind
[1:01:26] of room
[1:01:28] what size of a room do you need to fit
[1:01:30] 120 men and women in
[1:01:32] how many chairs do we have here like 40
[1:01:34] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
[1:01:36] 8 9 nine does one two three four
[1:01:39] five so we have less than 45 chairs in
[1:01:40] here what kind of room what kind of
[1:01:43] upper room do you need to fit 120 people
[1:01:45] in
[1:01:46] for 10 days 10 days
[1:01:49] what was the size of this room but the
[1:01:51] bible said they sat there
[1:01:53] the bible said they prayed the bible
[1:01:55] said they tarry no doubt they sang
[1:01:57] no doubt they ate but the bible said
[1:01:59] when they were sitting just sitting
[1:02:00] around
[1:02:01] the holy ghost came sweeping in like a
[1:02:03] rushing mighty wind praise god
[1:02:05] amen it just swept through and that's
[1:02:07] what hula said who has said when she got
[1:02:09] here that one time
[1:02:10] she felt the holy spirit just come
[1:02:11] through this wall struck her and she got
[1:02:13] healed of the flu but brother amen did
[1:02:14] it
[1:02:15] which that's all right that happens she
[1:02:18] felt the wind come through
[1:02:19] amen that was when brother cam was here
[1:02:20] a couple times ago probably about two
[1:02:22] years by now
[1:02:24] but look they gathered there they prayed
[1:02:26] and they're just waiting
[1:02:27] earnestly sincerely waiting upon the
[1:02:29] promise praise god
[1:02:32] so that takes a lot of sincerity to wait
[1:02:34] that long
[1:02:35] and wait for the holy spirit to come
[1:02:37] right so
[1:02:38] so bride churches have to be willing to
[1:02:41] go to great lengths to be born again
[1:02:44] because going just going to church and
[1:02:45] just doing your regular thing
[1:02:47] that's not enough we got to die to
[1:02:49] ourselves praise god
[1:02:51] you got to really hunger for it you
[1:02:52] really got to thirst for you really got
[1:02:54] to want to be filled with god's life
[1:02:56] amen god's power now lydia read this one
[1:02:59] uh this is an interesting scripture so
[1:03:01] read this one i say it's mysterious
[1:03:09] what an amazing scripture now remember
[1:03:12] this is the this is the same
[1:03:14] church that was formed i believe it was
[1:03:16] formed right after the philippian church
[1:03:18] paul left there and then he went there
[1:03:19] later to galatia i think maybe a couple
[1:03:22] trips later it was on one of the stops
[1:03:24] on that third missionary journey right
[1:03:27] uh but look what he says now this is
[1:03:28] chapter four remember chapter one he
[1:03:30] said if you preach anything
[1:03:31] outside of christ you're cursed right
[1:03:33] and then remember chapter two he had to
[1:03:34] correct peter to his face
[1:03:36] then chapter three talks about
[1:03:37] circumcision the church
[1:03:39] got got the holy spirit to visit them
[1:03:42] but then they
[1:03:42] started accepting legalism back into the
[1:03:45] church
[1:03:46] and he says these amazing statements
[1:03:48] here
[1:03:49] my little children of whom i travail in
[1:03:52] birth
[1:03:52] again until christ be formed in you
[1:03:56] now we know ephesians 4 30 you're sealed
[1:03:58] until when the next revival
[1:04:01] the next time brother cam comes the next
[1:04:04] time brother brooks comes is that the
[1:04:05] night is that when you're sealed to
[1:04:07] no you're seeing to the day you get a
[1:04:09] body change amen
[1:04:11] but paul's saying look i've got a
[1:04:12] travail
[1:04:15] where i've got to be in birth pains
[1:04:17] again
[1:04:18] until christ be formed in you so in
[1:04:20] other words they didn't get the holy
[1:04:22] ghost some of them didn't get the holy
[1:04:23] ghost
[1:04:24] the first time he was there think about
[1:04:27] that
[1:04:28] they had the holy spirit father no doubt
[1:04:29] there were signs wonders and miracles
[1:04:31] because remember paul says it in this
[1:04:33] chapter he says did you receive the holy
[1:04:35] ghost by the works of the law or by the
[1:04:37] hearing of faith
[1:04:38] remember that so they had miracle
[1:04:40] workers there there was
[1:04:41] people that had the holy ghost
[1:04:42] ministering through gifts and everything
[1:04:43] like that
[1:04:44] but he said i'm gonna have to travail
[1:04:46] again we gotta go back in other words
[1:04:48] we gotta go back to the altar amen we
[1:04:51] gotta go back to praying we gotta go
[1:04:52] back to
[1:04:53] seeking the holy spirit so you guys can
[1:04:55] get born again that's what he said
[1:04:57] so until christ be formed in you because
[1:05:00] that's what it's about christ in you the
[1:05:02] hope of glory
[1:05:04] christ dwelling in our hearts by faith
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:07] glory so what is it going to take it's
[1:05:11] going to take like a hannah anointing
[1:05:14] that's why brother cam and brother
[1:05:15] brooks came last june that's why
[1:05:17] it was such a great service because they
[1:05:19] just labored they labored through all
[1:05:20] the people remember they prayed for that
[1:05:21] they just
[1:05:22] labored through all the people that
[1:05:24] wanted prayer for the holy ghost and i
[1:05:25] was so exhausted and tired
[1:05:27] i could hardly pray i just prayed a
[1:05:29] little bit because i was totally worn
[1:05:30] out mentally i was worn out and
[1:05:32] exhausted
[1:05:35] but i'm thankful that they were laboring
[1:05:37] in prayer for all of our
[1:05:39] uh children all the visitors that come
[1:05:41] up for prayer i think that was mostly
[1:05:42] children that come up oh yeah brother uh
[1:05:44] joe joe carter came up for prayer that's
[1:05:46] right
[1:05:48] now malachi read hebrews 4 1 because
[1:05:50] this uh
[1:05:51] connects to it
[1:06:01] keep that up there remember this chapter
[1:06:02] this is the chapter about
[1:06:04] joshua in jesus right he was
[1:06:07] showing how israel never entered into
[1:06:10] the real rest the rest of the soul
[1:06:13] and he said if joshua had given them the
[1:06:14] rest then there would not be a need to
[1:06:16] talk about another rest
[1:06:18] but he said you can't come short of the
[1:06:21] promised land
[1:06:22] of the baptism of the holy ghost so
[1:06:24] church we've got to have this desire
[1:06:26] that we do not fall short of being born
[1:06:29] again because that's what paul found out
[1:06:31] in galatians 4
[1:06:32] they come short they come all the way up
[1:06:35] to kadesh barnea but never entered in
[1:06:38] never crossed over
[1:06:39] jordan and so we got to be willing to
[1:06:42] labor with people
[1:06:43] for that desire amen
[1:06:46] so what does hannah teach us we need to
[1:06:48] love natural children
[1:06:49] and we got to desperately cry out for
[1:06:52] spiritual children as well
[1:06:55] when i was up in new york the last time
[1:06:57] it must have been 2018
[1:06:59] the pastor up there was telling me his
[1:07:01] uh adult daughter
[1:07:04] yeah she i think was 18 or 19. she was
[1:07:06] going worldly and astray she wasn't
[1:07:07] married anything
[1:07:09] but she was really getting into uh maybe
[1:07:10] some bad i can't remember what the sin
[1:07:13] was
[1:07:13] it doesn't matter but anyways her her
[1:07:15] wife i'm sorry his wife felt led to go
[1:07:17] down into their basement
[1:07:19] and pray and fast and she prayed and
[1:07:21] fasted for three days
[1:07:23] she would just come up just to go to
[1:07:25] sleep
[1:07:26] she just was down there listening to
[1:07:27] sermons the whole time praying this is
[1:07:29] in new york and i've been to their house
[1:07:31] it's nice downstairs it's just like a
[1:07:32] regular downstairs you know where
[1:07:33] there's couches in there
[1:07:35] it's a nice downstairs pictures all over
[1:07:36] the wall
[1:07:38] but she was down there for three days on
[1:07:39] the third day that a 19 year old
[1:07:41] daughter came home
[1:07:44] and i think she was wearing pants i
[1:07:45] think at this point no she was raising
[1:07:47] the message
[1:07:48] uh she just went into her room she broke
[1:07:51] down started crying
[1:07:52] and then her dad went in there and then
[1:07:54] her mom came up at that
[1:07:56] same time and they came to see the
[1:07:57] daughter to see what was wrong and she
[1:07:59] said i'm ready to repent
[1:08:01] i'm ready they said they got right down
[1:08:03] there on their knees and prayed and they
[1:08:04] said she got the holy ghost right there
[1:08:07] but that mother fasted for three days
[1:08:10] now does that sound like hannah does
[1:08:13] that sound like hand in the bible
[1:08:14] just we pouring out ours oh oh god fill
[1:08:17] my children with the holy ghost
[1:08:19] fill my my mother or my wife or my
[1:08:21] husband or my grandfather my dad
[1:08:23] fill them with the holy ghost they had
[1:08:24] to get desperate praise god that's what
[1:08:26] we need more of amen
[1:08:28] now of course there'll be times and
[1:08:29] seasons there's always a time and season
[1:08:31] for a birth and the church said
[1:08:33] right you can't if the baby's on the way
[1:08:36] you can't make it come when you want to
[1:08:37] right there's a time and season for it
[1:08:39] but as that time approaches that people
[1:08:41] should be hungry and thirsting for that
[1:08:47] that's why i always like i always like
[1:08:49] to fast and pray on sunday mornings you
[1:08:50] just think
[1:08:51] that's usually the height the highlight
[1:08:52] service right where everybody's really
[1:08:54] dialed in and there's a real sincerity a
[1:08:57] lot of good anointing
[1:08:58] i always want to be ready because a
[1:08:59] couple of times people have received the
[1:09:01] holy ghost when i prayed for him after
[1:09:03] service
[1:09:03] amen and i always want to be ready to
[1:09:06] have
[1:09:06] uh my body in that in that uh
[1:09:09] that that that mindset i always wanted
[1:09:11] to have a body that's uh
[1:09:13] feasting spiritually and i've got zeal
[1:09:15] of the lord and i'm not tired from
[1:09:16] eating supper i'm not tired from
[1:09:18] uh anything carnal i'm having a
[1:09:20] spiritual feast amen
[1:09:22] and then i'm able to labor to enter into
[1:09:24] that rest pray because that's what
[1:09:25] happened with sister who got the holy
[1:09:26] ghost remember we prayed the first time
[1:09:27] remember that lydia
[1:09:29] uh we dismissed and didn't seem like you
[1:09:31] know anything happened
[1:09:34] and uh then lydia came in to want to
[1:09:36] pray for the holy ghost i come back
[1:09:37] out and i said you know what let's pray
[1:09:39] for sister who again
[1:09:40] we pray we all got down there together
[1:09:42] and we know the holy ghost fell right
[1:09:43] there
[1:09:44] praise god so it took a second prayer
[1:09:46] amen took a second
[1:09:48] time seeking the lord so never feel bad
[1:09:50] i didn't get the holy ghost the first
[1:09:51] time i i prayed for i prayed for it
[1:09:53] numerous times i didn't get the holy
[1:09:54] ghost the first time
[1:09:55] in fact that one day i think i told you
[1:09:57] in my college house once all my buddies
[1:09:59] were out
[1:10:00] i was on saturday night i remember on
[1:10:01] saturday night because the next day was
[1:10:02] a sunday
[1:10:03] i just went to my upper room there i got
[1:10:05] on my knees and i shouted and screamed
[1:10:07] and cried god come in here fill me with
[1:10:09] the holy ghost i was expecting angels to
[1:10:11] come in
[1:10:12] i was expecting to see a light it didn't
[1:10:13] happen that day but it happened months
[1:10:15] later
[1:10:16] but i was seeking for it i was
[1:10:20] i was generally i genuinely wanted to be
[1:10:22] filled with the holy ghost
[1:10:23] i wanted to know that life had come in
[1:10:25] me praise god
[1:10:26] and i was crying out for it i wouldn't
[1:10:28] be born again i want to i want to know
[1:10:30] that christ is in me
[1:10:31] i want the life of jesus in me praise
[1:10:34] god
[1:10:35] so you got to be desperate for it it's
[1:10:36] got to be something you're hungry and
[1:10:38] thirsting for
[1:10:40] it's got to be more to life it's got to
[1:10:42] be more it's gotta mean more than life
[1:10:44] to you
[1:10:47] that's what hannah teaches us what a
[1:10:48] lesson from hannah
[1:10:50] she's willing to go to the house of god
[1:10:52] and just pour out her soul god i want
[1:10:54] the holy ghost more than anything praise
[1:10:56] god
[1:10:58] that's what we learned from a saint like
[1:11:00] hannah
[1:11:01] as malachi said as he read there from
[1:11:03] hebrews we must be careful
[1:11:06] not to fall short of it
[1:11:09] we've got to enter into the promised
[1:11:11] land
[1:11:13] so church what do we learn from paul's
[1:11:15] example legalism
[1:11:17] and any church that reverts instead of
[1:11:19] going on with the holy ghost
[1:11:21] like say like this instead of going
[1:11:22] higher and higher with the holy ghost
[1:11:24] when people go lower and lower and go
[1:11:25] into legalism and man-made creeds
[1:11:28] that proves they were never born again
[1:11:30] to begin with
[1:11:31] like all the message preachers that have
[1:11:33] fallen away that prove they were never
[1:11:35] born again in the first place
[1:11:37] because they went into legalism or they
[1:11:39] went into criticizing brother branham or
[1:11:41] basically blaspheming brother branham
[1:11:44] and then the bible and jesus
[1:11:46] right if they go into that type of
[1:11:49] behavior
[1:11:51] it proves they were never born again in
[1:11:53] the first place and then we'd have to
[1:11:54] echo the words of paul
[1:11:57] we need to travail and birth again until
[1:11:59] you get christ
[1:12:00] born in you praise god amen we've got to
[1:12:03] try that birth again
[1:12:04] praise god because they never got the
[1:12:06] original birth
[1:12:10] all right how much time i got five
[1:12:12] minutes okay
[1:12:17] i'm just gonna stay on this thought here
[1:12:20] i'm just gonna yeah i'm gonna just
[1:12:21] preach here
[1:12:23] you know i'm not even gonna close my
[1:12:25] notes i'm just gonna prank for a
[1:12:26] little bit
[1:12:29] the greatest meetings i've ever preached
[1:12:31] anywhere have been when i preach on the
[1:12:33] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:35] i've never seen greater meanings in
[1:12:36] those meetings
[1:12:38] uh we had a four or five hour service
[1:12:40] over there in albion when i preached on
[1:12:42] uh the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:46] and i thought it is so and it's nothing
[1:12:48] that i ever planned out i just
[1:12:50] i i i studied one day or one actually
[1:12:52] maybe i studied for a week or whatever
[1:12:55] on the baptism of the holy ghost how do
[1:12:56] i receive the holy ghost
[1:12:58] and i just showed all the scriptures
[1:13:00] where there was wonderful works
[1:13:01] shouting speaking in tongues prophesying
[1:13:04] rejoicing
[1:13:05] boldness i just showed every all the
[1:13:07] examples there's five examples in the
[1:13:09] book of acts right
[1:13:10] and you showed all of those and so
[1:13:12] church i've learned
[1:13:13] the message god likes the most that i've
[1:13:16] ever preached
[1:13:17] that he's ever given me is the one about
[1:13:19] being born
[1:13:20] amen the one about being born into his
[1:13:24] family
[1:13:25] god loves the sermons on the birth amen
[1:13:28] like cam right when cam came last
[1:13:30] last summer that was the that was the
[1:13:32] most anointed service i think i've ever
[1:13:34] been in our church
[1:13:35] was he preaching on the holiest of
[1:13:37] holies
[1:13:39] the baptism of the holy ghost i know
[1:13:41] jesus likes that why
[1:13:42] because that's where you mean him amen
[1:13:44] that's where you meet him
[1:13:46] and jesus has proved to me over and over
[1:13:50] i still remember when i preached in guy
[1:13:52] and i still remember this in guyana the
[1:13:53] church was so small i can i can show you
[1:13:55] the youtube video of the church
[1:13:57] because they have another video there
[1:13:59] brother brooks was outside in the sand
[1:14:01] the church is so small
[1:14:02] the church isn't even this size inside
[1:14:05] of it
[1:14:06] much smaller so brother brooks was out
[1:14:08] past the back door
[1:14:10] i was preaching on the holy ghost saints
[1:14:12] god is my witness
[1:14:14] he would every him and all the people
[1:14:15] around were on his knees this was
[1:14:17] probably a four or five hour service as
[1:14:18] well
[1:14:18] he was on his knees in his suit in the
[1:14:21] sand because it was all sand it's like a
[1:14:23] beachy sand
[1:14:24] right there and guy on that island where
[1:14:26] we were at and church i could
[1:14:28] see the water almost piling up like uh
[1:14:31] from his tears it was just it was
[1:14:33] hitting the same spot and it was like
[1:14:34] tiny little puddles
[1:14:37] just he was so we were so moved by the
[1:14:40] people that were
[1:14:42] desiring to be filled with the holy
[1:14:43] ghost and brother brooks uh
[1:14:45] said the holy spirit gave him a great
[1:14:46] touch that day and
[1:14:48] it was it's not it's not anything about
[1:14:50] me it's just what the lord gave me
[1:14:52] for those people right
[1:14:57] uh i'm gonna think i'm gonna pause the
[1:15:02] live stream because i'm gonna say
[1:15:03] something personal so god bless the live
