[18:28] our Wednesday was part 43 of the church
[18:32] ages and really curbed by that this is
[18:35] part 44
[18:37] that's what Revelation chapter 3 verse 8
[18:41] I'll just be in 45 minutes here I don't
[18:43] want to go much longer than that so
[18:46] we'll just try to keep it right straight
[18:48] to the word revelation 3 verse 8
[19:01] I truly enjoy
[19:03] Church ages praise God it's been a
[19:05] wonderful series and it's been such a
[19:08] refresher to go back through the church
[19:10] age book it's just been wonderful and so
[19:13] thankful for the inspiration it provides
[19:15] us I'll read that quote again what the
[19:18] Prophet said and he said when you read
[19:19] the church ages and get the revelation
[19:20] it prepares you for the rapture so it's
[19:23] so needed in this hour revelation 3
[19:25] verse 8 so get the open door I may have
[19:28] to preach maybe two or three sermons on
[19:30] the open door there's a lot the Prophet
[19:32] gives us on the open door so we'll just
[19:35] read verse eight tonight let's read it
[19:37] together
[19:37] on three one two three I know thy works
[19:41] behold I have set before thee an open
[19:44] door and no man can shut it for thou
[19:48] hast a little strength and has kept my
[19:50] word and has not denied my name
[19:54] it's Bauer heads here and if you have
[19:56] meat on your heart just make it on in to
[19:57] God Heavenly Father were grateful to be
[20:00] in your house again tonight or speak to
[20:02] us through thy word Lord thank you for
[20:04] the open door and as we'll see Lord
[20:06] you've you've had many open doors Lord
[20:09] God in the scripture there's many ways
[20:10] to apply this so thank you Lord God that
[20:13] you open the door for us Lord in this
[20:16] hour in our lives dear God in this city
[20:19] Lord Jesus and also father of this whole
[20:22] age Lord the whole age of the open door
[20:25] to Philadelphia and then the entire
[20:27] Gentile dispensation as an open door so
[20:32] father were grateful Lord God and Lord
[20:34] we're looking forward to that meeting in
[20:36] the air Lord as we just sang about Lord
[20:37] and those that have already gone before
[20:39] we look forward to meeting them just
[20:41] inside the eastern gate father we thank
[20:43] you Lord God let your spirit be not to
[20:46] us in Jesus Christ's name never said
[20:48] even God best should be in seat of their
[20:50] praise God
[20:51] [Music]
[20:59] well had it real good time studying this
[21:01] I think I studied this on Wednesday and
[21:02] I never got to it preach it on Wednesday
[21:04] night because I preached longer on the
[21:08] other statements but let me just read
[21:11] this again here and malachi you know
[21:15] what maybe we'll just show these slides
[21:16] here by God's grace remember in the
[21:29] church age book I just thought it'd be
[21:30] good to read this again by God's grace
[21:33] to encourage our hearts where the
[21:37] Prophet said though this volume will
[21:39] concern itself with various major
[21:40] doctrines such as Godhead water baptism
[21:43] etc found in Revelation chapters one
[21:46] through three its main theme is setting
[21:48] forth of a detailed study the seven
[21:50] church ages this is necessary in order
[21:53] to study and understand the rest of the
[21:56] revelation four out of the ages come the
[21:59] seals and out of the seals come the
[22:01] trumpets now the trumpets come the vials
[22:03] like the first burst of a roman candle
[22:05] the church ages comes forth with the
[22:07] mighty initial illumination without
[22:11] which there could be no further light
[22:14] that's amazing why you have to
[22:17] understand the church ages before you
[22:19] can even understand the seals the right
[22:21] way or the judgments of God the
[22:23] Tribulation Period and the vials that's
[22:25] all tribulation period so the Prophet
[22:28] says it without which so without this
[22:29] understanding of this wonderful church
[22:31] age book the Prophet gave us the seals
[22:33] would not have come that the
[22:35] understanding of it and that's the order
[22:37] - God gave you know brother Branham
[22:38] that's the church ages in 1960 and three
[22:41] years later you know in 1963 he gives
[22:43] them the seven seals and I just want you
[22:48] to see that again you know this is
[22:50] necessary it's necessary for me to teach
[22:52] the seven church ages because the
[22:54] prophets said it was necessary and Jesus
[22:57] said it was necessary so we're grateful
[22:59] for that and hope you're enjoying this
[23:01] series by God's grace also he said but
[23:03] the brilliance of the seven church ages
[23:05] is given by divine revelation so when
[23:09] you when we hear these things they
[23:10] should say my we should say that was
[23:11] brilliant the Holy Spirit gave the
[23:13] fit brilliant understanding of the Word
[23:15] of God that's what we should say it
[23:17] should be brilliant to us because this
[23:20] divine revelation light upon light
[23:22] follows until the whole of the
[23:24] revelation opened wide before our
[23:27] wandering eyes and we edified and
[23:29] purified by its spirit are made ready
[23:31] for this glorious appearing even our
[23:33] Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus
[23:36] Christ I don't know about you but I'm
[23:39] sure it was with you after you first
[23:42] heard the church ages and then heard the
[23:44] seven seals you finally were able
[23:46] understand the rest of the book of
[23:48] Revelation right and it should have
[23:50] opened up like he said it should have
[23:52] been light upon light and you and when
[23:55] you first read it right your eyes
[23:56] wandered like you you wonder at the
[23:58] Bible with admiration this Bible is a
[24:01] new Bible we know everything in the book
[24:04] of Revelation we know all the symbols we
[24:06] know the order and we looked at it with
[24:08] eyes of wondering didn't we and let's
[24:11] not forget that initial illumination
[24:13] let's ask God for a little more
[24:15] illumination tonight by God's grace Lord
[24:18] give us a little more illumination
[24:19] tonight because it's brilliant if we'll
[24:22] see it in the light where the scripture
[24:24] brings it and I love this we edified and
[24:28] purified by its Spirit are made ready
[24:32] for the glorious appearing even our Lord
[24:34] and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ
[24:36] because I remember the Prophet did tell
[24:38] us remember he said thus saith the Lord
[24:40] all the interpretations in the churches
[24:43] and the seals and the history were thus
[24:44] say at the Lord and that's what
[24:46] revelation as we saw this morning ok so
[24:49] here's my thoughts I want to do for
[24:51] today tonight by God's grace remember
[24:56] we're in the sixth church H from 1750 to
[25:00] 1906 they had a little more light in
[25:02] this age and they did in the Sardis age
[25:04] and John Wesley lived from 1703 to 1791
[25:09] now the prophets spent most of his time
[25:12] on the truth of the open door in the
[25:15] 1960 sermon so if you go through and
[25:18] listen that I don't know if you have my
[25:19] wife was listen to it last week and but
[25:24] I listened to it of course you know
[25:25] before that he spent most of the time so
[25:30] most of the quotes from the 1960 sermon
[25:33] on the open door I'll bring out probably
[25:35] Wednesday but I want you to again look
[25:37] at the outline let's look at the outline
[25:39] again and he spends over an hour just on
[25:41] the open door because the open door
[25:43] thought is more than just missionary
[25:46] aged Philadelphia so in other words that
[25:49] idea the open door is more than just
[25:51] confined to the sixth church age there's
[25:54] actually different kinds of open doors
[25:55] that's what one look at tonight I want
[25:57] to go through the scriptures on the open
[25:58] doors okay so here's the outline the
[26:02] first two minutes after the introduction
[26:05] were the aged messenger then he reviewed
[26:08] the previous ages for about seven
[26:10] minutes and then he did more on Wesley's
[26:11] history performance now all this in
[26:13] orange the next two slides is all open
[26:16] door so he spent a total of 68 minutes
[26:19] almost 70 minutes of the two-hour sermon
[26:22] on the open door so let's go back there
[26:24] he talks about the open door missionary
[26:26] age empower and not word only so signs
[26:30] wonders and miracles for the Gentile
[26:31] church age he spends 23 minutes on that
[26:34] and then he takes 22 minutes on how
[26:36] Jesus is the open door how Jesus is God
[26:40] the name of Jesus and the Holy Ghost
[26:42] covenant even goes back to Abraham and
[26:46] shows how the Abrahamic covenant
[26:48] started in Genesis and then even extends
[26:51] to us in Galatians chapter 3 it teaches
[26:53] us that or for I believe and then he
[26:57] takes five minutes on the supreme deity
[26:58] of Christ and the key of David and then
[27:02] he takes 18 more minutes on how this age
[27:06] had a little strength and that strength
[27:08] was in the deity of Christ and the name
[27:10] of Christ and water baptism and then so
[27:13] a total of 68 minutes on the open door
[27:15] so like I said Wednesday we'll go
[27:17] through those quotes I haven't got those
[27:18] on the slideshow I just did the
[27:20] scriptures on this slideshow so we're
[27:22] looking at the slideshow here tonight
[27:24] while these slides I should say and then
[27:27] he's takes about 20 well 3 10 13 14
[27:32] minutes on synagogue of satan' takes 14
[27:35] minutes on that
[27:36] we looked at that a little bit a few
[27:38] weeks ago and then he takes about 10 18
[27:43] minutes on the hour temptation the crown
[27:45] the pillar and the new name and they
[27:47] close with that okay now I'm going to
[27:51] skip past this here
[27:52] I had a few quotes I think I'll use
[27:53] those on Wednesday let's just look at
[27:55] the scriptures here tonight will take
[27:56] about a half hour by God's grace how
[27:59] many thankful for the open door tonight
[28:00] oh so thankful let's go to john 10:7
[28:03] this is where the prophet starts in the
[28:05] church age book door john 10:7
[28:11] or jesus says i am the door so malachi
[28:23] can read up for us john 10:7 amen all
[28:32] that ever came before me are thieves and
[28:34] robbers but the Sheep did not hear them
[28:37] what of what a blessing amen the real
[28:40] sheep never heard those thieves and
[28:41] robbers I am the door by Me If any man
[28:44] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[28:47] in and out and find pasture the thief
[28:51] cometh not before to steal and to kill
[28:53] and destroy I am come that they might
[28:55] have life and that they might have it
[28:57] more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd
[28:58] the Good Shepherd his life for the Sheep
[29:02] we'll just stop right there by God's
[29:04] grace all right now I wanna let me slip
[29:08] skip ahead to this here and then we'll
[29:10] prove it by the scripture let's look at
[29:11] this slide I made here there are the
[29:14] following open doors in the scripture
[29:17] there's the open door during the
[29:19] Philadelphian church age that's the one
[29:20] we just read a revelation 3/8 there's
[29:23] the open door for the Gentile
[29:25] dispensation and Pentecost so we're
[29:27] going to show these by the scripture
[29:29] there's an open door to local ministries
[29:33] there's an open door to heaven by vision
[29:36] because John was caught up by the open
[29:39] door he said the door was open
[29:42] there's the open door response that
[29:45] Jesus requests by Christ to the Laotian
[29:48] Church H remember II said knock
[29:50] knocking if you open the door to see
[29:53] there's there's a lot of applications to
[29:54] the open door there's not just one like
[29:56] we said there's not just one to the
[29:58] Philadelphian church age and that's why
[30:01] it's so important that we just don't
[30:02] well I'll leave the open door just to
[30:03] Philadelphia we got to remember God
[30:05] Christ is saying open the door to me
[30:08] today we've got to open our hearts door
[30:10] to Christ today in the Laodicean Church
[30:12] age and then there's the open door
[30:15] requested by the workers of iniquity but
[30:17] they will be denied so they asked they
[30:19] asked for the door to be open too late
[30:21] right so we know if Jesus is not Jesus
[30:24] is offering it right now and we got to
[30:25] be ready right now but they're gonna ask
[30:28] too late
[30:29] so now let's go through these scriptures
[30:30] here let's go back and we'll go through
[30:32] a few scriptures let's go to this one
[30:33] right here let's go to Luke 13:23 and
[30:36] maybe we can have some readers in just a
[30:37] moment Luke 13:23 I want you to see the
[30:41] thought of the open door through the
[30:42] scripture
[30:53] 13:23 so this is the group of the
[31:02] workers of iniquity remember this is the
[31:03] same group for Matthew 7:21 they've done
[31:06] miracles they've cast out demons they've
[31:08] done all these things but they never
[31:09] knew Christ they never went through the
[31:12] open door they just had the anointing
[31:14] right of the Holy Spirit and they never
[31:17] went through the door they never went
[31:19] through the word they never went through
[31:21] the message of the hour amen
[31:22] I say God let me go through all the
[31:24] message of the hour hallelujah Luke 20
[31:29] to 30
[31:30] I'm sorry 1323 I'm sorry I said the
[31:33] wrong thing okay I got that but I would
[31:37] like to read tonight by God sorry sister
[31:38] Wendy can you read 23 to 25 look at this
[32:28] thought Church isn't that striking jesus
[32:30] said in verse 24 many are gonna try to
[32:33] enter in and won't be able many that
[32:37] means many people in the tribulation are
[32:39] gonna realize there's trouble this is
[32:43] God's judgment I want to enter in and
[32:45] Jesus says many people now we think of
[32:47] the weather seven billion on the earth
[32:48] right now so that's the population think
[32:51] about when the rapture goes it's gonna
[32:52] be one percent of that or one in a
[32:54] million or a real small number brother
[32:56] Branham says and then many people are
[32:59] gonna realize the wrath of God is upon
[33:01] this earth and they're gonna try to go
[33:03] through the door and they're gonna knock
[33:05] and say they're gonna pray
[33:07] right that's what mother Ram said
[33:08] they're not gonna we're gonna come back
[33:10] the rapture has already come and they
[33:11] didn't know it right they're gonna knock
[33:14] and say Lord Lord and Jesus will say to
[33:15] them I know not whence you are so maybe
[33:18] that voice will also come and say that I
[33:20] don't know who you are I didn't know you
[33:23] you didn't open the door you didn't open
[33:25] the door of your heart to me when you
[33:26] had the chance right you didn't come
[33:29] through the word when you had the chance
[33:30] to come through that's a striking
[33:33] thought right there and many church many
[33:35] people are gonna realize something's
[33:37] going on chaos is happening right the
[33:40] wrath of God I say god I open all my
[33:43] heart to you take all my heart I want to
[33:45] I want to go through all the world I'm
[33:47] gonna go through every door of God amen
[33:48] I don't open every door in my heart to
[33:50] Christ I want all of Christ in me right
[33:53] now amen now look at verse 26 then shall
[33:57] you begin to say we have eaten and
[33:58] drunken in thy presence and thou has
[34:00] taught in our streets
[34:02] but he shall say I tell you I know not
[34:05] whence you are depart from me all ye
[34:06] that workers of iniquity Wow and that's
[34:09] striking again see we were in your
[34:12] presence see they had the anointing that
[34:14] the presence of God right in his
[34:16] presence is fullness of joy these people
[34:18] experience the presence of God oh we're
[34:20] right in your presence but they never
[34:22] went through the word they never had a
[34:24] word based experience they just had the
[34:27] anointing workers of iniquity remember
[34:29] they see they're living in sin but also
[34:31] enjoying the anointing we got to have
[34:34] both we gotta the anointing and a life
[34:35] of purity
[34:37] verse 28 there shall be weeping and
[34:40] gnashing of teeth when ye shall see
[34:42] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the
[34:44] prophets in the kingdom of God and you
[34:46] yourselves thrust out this is speaking
[34:48] to Jews but also the Gentiles right
[34:51] because this is the age where he said
[34:53] they're workers of iniquity and I never
[34:56] knew you so it's speaking to both here
[34:57] and they would see Abraham Isaac they
[34:59] see them and then the Jews in that day
[35:01] would be thrust out and they shall come
[35:04] from the east and from the west and from
[35:05] the north and from the south and shall
[35:06] sit down in the kingdom of God and
[35:08] behold they're our last which shall be
[35:11] first and they're our first which shall
[35:14] be last all right and that's verse 30
[35:16] okay that's what we're gonna read to see
[35:18] there will be people seeking the open
[35:20] door
[35:22] right but it's at the wrong time we got
[35:24] to seek the door while there's time Wow
[35:27] God's available right now during our
[35:30] season of our lives amen
[35:35] so I want you to show that so see
[35:37] there's an open door where they can't
[35:39] get in that door will never be open
[35:41] right they are asking for the open door
[35:42] but that door shut where they can't have
[35:45] an open door but we can have the open
[35:47] door today amen
[35:49] now let me show you the dispensational
[35:51] open door that's acts 14 27 let's read
[35:54] that so this is the dispensational open
[35:57] door where the RAM calls us the open
[36:00] door of Pentecost in the church age book
[36:02] X 14 27 Jesus
[36:15] is the door Jesus is the word ax 1427
[36:23] amen
[36:24] this has returned to Antioch they had
[36:27] their Paul had his first missionary trip
[36:29] I believe yeah and then he comes back in
[36:32] verse 27 and when they were come and had
[36:34] gathered the church together they
[36:36] rehearsed all that God had done with
[36:37] them and how he had opened the door of
[36:40] faith unto the Gentiles and there they
[36:44] abode long time with the Gentiles the
[36:47] Gentiles have this dispensational open
[36:50] door well once it's closed they're gonna
[36:52] say open that door back up to us and
[36:54] Jesus said I never knew you you already
[36:56] had the chance you were in the streets
[36:58] we were all you were in my presence all
[37:00] these things but you never went through
[37:02] the word I'm glad I can be washed
[37:03] through the waters of the word amen I
[37:05] want to be washed right now praise God
[37:07] hallelujah want to go through Christ the
[37:09] word right now and then remember we read
[37:13] this but the Philadelphia age was the
[37:15] missionary age of the open door we'll
[37:17] look at that more on Wednesday the
[37:20] missionary age of the open door and so
[37:23] the times of the Gentiles is the
[37:26] dispensational age of the open door you
[37:28] have a church age open door age to the
[37:31] Philadelphia but then you have this we'd
[37:33] say 2,000 long year or 2,000 years long
[37:38] open door to all the Gentiles okay so we
[37:42] have to keep that in mind there's
[37:43] multiple kinds of open doors by God's
[37:46] grace now I want to show you this here
[37:49] the local ministries were also open
[37:51] doors that's what I feel like we have an
[37:53] Akron God give us an open door in Akron
[37:55] there's an open door in Lima there's an
[37:58] open door in all these cities thank God
[37:59] for it amen that's oh we want we want an
[38:01] open door praise God we want something
[38:04] to walk into a ministry to walk into it
[38:06] because the Bible says if you have a
[38:08] gift
[38:08] it'll make room for itself well how do
[38:10] you get into a room you got to go
[38:11] through the door praise God now 1st
[38:14] Corinthians 16:9 let's go there this is
[38:16] this is just really refreshing to go
[38:18] through these 1st Corinthians 16:9
[38:20] really encouraging by the grace of Lord
[38:22] as well within 16:9
[38:27] I was asking that woman at Giant Eagle
[38:38] Rochelle last week I said what did you
[38:41] make it to church and she said no I said
[38:42] well here's my card she's oh I got your
[38:45] card she said I work since 8:00 a.m.
[38:48] this morning didn't make it to church
[38:49] and she said I said we listen to our
[38:51] sermon tonight when you get home she
[38:52] said I'll try to do that and so I asked
[38:54] her today if she got a chance she said
[38:55] no I try but then something came up she
[38:57] said I would try to finish listen to
[38:58] your sermon what am I trying to I'm
[39:00] trying to get her into the open door
[39:02] right everybody we come in contact with
[39:04] we try to get them into the open door by
[39:07] God's grace and that was just
[39:08] encouraging you know she's trying to
[39:10] listen but then things keep coming up
[39:11] she's trying to hear the word of God and
[39:13] we know right that even this ministry
[39:15] God can use life's true means to save
[39:17] souls we know that God can use YouTube
[39:19] to save souls God can use a track to
[39:21] save a soul die can use anything to save
[39:23] a soul it's the way that he plans amens
[39:27] his design a 1st Corinthians 16:9 now I
[39:32] want to reverse 8 though but I will
[39:34] tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost for a
[39:38] great door and effectual is open unto me
[39:43] and there are many adversaries think
[39:48] about that he wanted to go up to pen and
[39:50] coffee one to stay at Ephesus then go to
[39:52] Pentecost she went to stay there in
[39:54] Ephesus because it was a great open door
[39:56] right when to go to Pentecost to worship
[39:58] because there was an open door there's a
[39:59] church in Jerusalem
[40:01] but that's one thing I want to lay in
[40:03] the verse 9 we should expect if God give
[40:05] us an open door we should expect Satan
[40:07] to be fighting us tooth and nail that's
[40:09] what I find right we labor pray for
[40:11] souls we we pull them in we baptize as
[40:14] many as we can and then Satan pulls many
[40:17] of them out but we've got to still be
[40:20] faithful and remember we have many
[40:21] adversaries but with Christ were more
[40:23] than a conqueror and we understand we're
[40:27] part of those that are going through
[40:28] that open door as well we're trying to
[40:30] get as many as we can but we will face
[40:32] many adversaries with the open door God
[40:36] has given to us now one is look at verse
[40:38] 10 - now if Timothy has come
[40:40] see that he may be with you without fear
[40:44] for he worketh for the Lord as I do I'm
[40:49] sorry as I also do pardon me forgive me
[40:53] if I don't read the scripture right last
[40:55] week I kind of messed up sister Connie
[40:57] because I I was reading the scripture
[40:59] about fear and I said reverence cuz that
[41:01] was the definition of fear
[41:02] she thought I was reading the Bible and
[41:04] and thought that her Bible had a
[41:06] misprint in it so just because I you
[41:08] know forcefully said it so much and so
[41:10] forgive me I don't want to add to the
[41:11] word you know I need to state if I'm I
[41:14] need to tell you if I'm giving a
[41:15] definition okay but Timothy I want to
[41:18] make sure I wrote that I noted that
[41:21] Timothy was called Paul's son did you
[41:24] know that Paul called Timothy his son in
[41:26] the faith I want to just make sure I
[41:29] read that too because that'll become
[41:30] important here as we get to the next
[41:33] scripture so let's go to 2nd Corinthians
[41:35] 2 right now let's go there yeah that's
[41:41] right that's right so 2nd Corinthians
[41:44] chapter 2 verse 12 I'm gonna look at
[41:46] this here cuz I thought he called Titus
[41:50] my son to have to look up that but I
[41:54] thought he said Titus was my son I know
[41:56] he called Timothy my son they called own
[42:05] Onesimus his son as well as we know he
[42:09] was a father in the gospel he was one
[42:10] that brought the gospel they got born
[42:12] again under his ministry so they called
[42:14] him a father so brother Brooks would be
[42:15] like the father and the gospel to me
[42:17] because I was born again the Holy Ghost
[42:19] under his ministry that's just how it
[42:22] would be that's apostolic so 2nd
[42:25] Corinthians 2:12 I'm sorry I'm not there
[42:33] st. Corinthians 2:12 okay furthermore
[42:38] when I came to Troas to preach Christ's
[42:41] gospel and the door was open unto me of
[42:45] the Lord so he this is the local
[42:48] ministry open door
[42:49] remember he already said in acts 14 the
[42:51] door face been open to the Gentiles but
[42:53] there was also many door
[42:55] little doors in every city right where
[42:57] there's a church God had a little door
[42:59] got to open that door but he had to have
[43:00] somebody willing to go and open that
[43:03] door and willing to walk into that
[43:05] ministry then he'd raise up when the
[43:06] door was open they could walk through it
[43:08] and they could establish pastors right
[43:10] teachers establish a church there so
[43:13] this is the local ministry open door now
[43:17] in acts 16 Paul went to Troas which was
[43:20] a coastal city in the northern part of
[43:23] the Providence of Asia and Paul went
[43:27] there after the riot and Ephesus in acts
[43:29] 19 on his way to Macedonia in Acts
[43:34] chapter 20 okay so I want to UM I want
[43:40] to read that in just a moment but let's
[43:42] read the next verses since we're in sin
[43:43] card the interested one
[43:44] let's i'm sorry ii needs to let's read
[43:46] verse 13 here i had no rest in my spirit
[43:53] because I found that Titus my brother
[43:55] but taking my leave of them
[43:58] I went from thence into Macedonia so
[44:04] there was something about his
[44:05] relationship with Titus that Paul
[44:07] couldn't rest he had to know that his
[44:09] son was okay he had to know that his son
[44:11] was still walk you in the faith see how
[44:14] important it is when you have someone
[44:16] you've led to the Lord see how see how
[44:17] much you should care about them see how
[44:19] much we should care about the souls that
[44:21] God gives us he places you know these
[44:23] souls under us where we're supposed to
[44:25] be faithful we should care so much that
[44:27] we can't rest until we know that the
[44:29] ones that we've led to the Lord are
[44:30] still serving the Lord amen
[44:33] that's a real care he couldn't he
[44:35] couldn't have any rest he couldn't get
[44:36] any any consolation until he found Titus
[44:40] his brother that was because God had
[44:42] opened the door now let's go to Acts
[44:45] chapter 20 so I think I put that up
[44:46] there yeah Acts chapter 20 verse 6
[44:56] so you'll remember Acts chapter 20 so an
[45:07] open door was given to Paul intro ass
[45:10] and God did a mighty miracle intro ass
[45:13] as well amen verse 1 and after the
[45:16] uproar was ceased Paul called unto him
[45:18] the disciples and embraced them and
[45:19] departed for to go into Macedonia and
[45:22] when he had gone over those parts and
[45:23] had given them much exhortation he came
[45:25] into Greece and their abode three months
[45:28] and when the Jews had laid wait for him
[45:29] as he was about to say on to Syria he
[45:32] purposed to return through Macedonia and
[45:34] there accompanied him into Asia so
[45:37] patter of Berea and of the Thessalonians
[45:40] r s darkest and secundus and Gaius of
[45:45] Derby and timotheus and of Asia
[45:48] Takai 'kiss and trophimus these going
[45:53] before tarried for us at Troas yes
[45:56] there's that City remember this was an
[45:57] open door the city was a place where God
[45:59] had opened a door and we sailed away
[46:02] from Philippi after the days of the
[46:04] unleavened bread and came unto them to
[46:06] trow as in five days where we abode
[46:09] seven days and upon the first day of the
[46:13] week when the disciples came together to
[46:15] break bread and that's the scripture
[46:16] where we get we should gather on Sunday
[46:18] the first day of the week
[46:20] they broke bread like we broke bread
[46:22] this morning on the first day of the
[46:24] week amen Paul preached unto them ready
[46:27] to depart on the morrow and continued
[46:29] his speech until midnight that's quite a
[46:33] long Majan if I preached here till
[46:35] midnight tonight that's what he did he
[46:36] was on the first day of the week
[46:38] and he preached them to midnight because
[46:40] we they didn't know if they'd see this
[46:41] messenger again they didn't know if
[46:43] they'd see this prophet again all they
[46:44] knew is that God had opened a door and
[46:46] Troas and they were ready to hear the
[46:48] message of the hour and when the Prophet
[46:50] came through all that's here we gonna
[46:51] stay all night if he's gotta leave
[46:52] tomorrow let's have him preach to us all
[46:54] night we're hungry for the Word of God
[46:56] we want to hear the message from the
[46:59] prophet of God Oh hallelujah and now you
[47:02] remember the miracle verse 8 and there
[47:04] were many lights in the upper chamber
[47:06] when they were gathered together and
[47:07] there sat in a window a certain young
[47:09] man named eutychus
[47:10] being fallen into deep sleep and as Paul
[47:13] was long preaching he sunk down with
[47:15] sleep so don't know about he's sunk down
[47:17] was sleep here tonight and fell down
[47:19] from the third
[47:20] Lofton was taken up dead and Paul went
[47:21] down and fell on him and embracing him
[47:23] said trouble not yourselves for his life
[47:25] is in him wherefore he therefore was
[47:29] come up again and when he had broken
[47:32] bread and eaten and talked a long while
[47:34] until break of day so he departed and
[47:36] they brought the young man alive and
[47:38] were not a little comforted a man praise
[47:42] God now I want to just stay a couple
[47:45] more things about this there's a few
[47:47] things I read in here now that'll be a
[47:50] blessing I want to read that scripture
[47:52] how Paul was the son I'm sorry Timothy
[47:54] was a son to Paul okay so it's go to 2nd
[47:57] Timothy 1 verse 2 second Timothy 1 verse
[48:00] 2
[48:10] second timothy 1 verse 2 alright someone
[48:22] like to read that for me second Timothy
[48:23] Lydia thank you
[48:29] [Music]
[48:31] amen
[48:32] so these men that were under Paul became
[48:37] sons to him let me find Titus and see if
[48:42] there's there it is alright Titus 1 for
[48:43] I knew I thought for sure Titus was a
[48:45] son of Paul 2 so it's going to Titus 1
[48:48] for I just want to show you the
[48:54] relationship you know through the
[48:55] scripture that the open door brings the
[48:58] open door brings father-son relations in
[49:00] other words it brings family
[49:01] relationship right when someone's born
[49:04] again through the ministry it brings
[49:06] like a family relationship like father
[49:08] son mother right it brings that Kuip
[49:11] type of family where our family here at
[49:13] church should be more close than your
[49:15] unsaved family that's your natural blood
[49:17] family ever understand that by God's
[49:19] grace Paul and Timothy Paul was like
[49:22] father
[49:22] Timothy's son Paul's father Titus is son
[49:25] it brings such a strong bond because
[49:27] it's the bond of eternal life amen
[49:29] through the open door alright Titus 1
[49:33] for malachite give me that for me sir
[49:35] thank you amen so Titus was his son a
[49:45] member there in second Corinthians there
[49:48] he said Titus was my son and Titus I had
[49:52] no rest until I found Titus my son
[49:56] through the open door now
[50:00] Titus is important to this is a thought
[50:02] that's kind of outside the the open door
[50:04] thought but I want to lay this in here
[50:06] Titus was Paul's proof to the Galatians
[50:10] that the Gentiles could be converted
[50:12] without works of the law such as
[50:14] circumcision so I like the let's go to
[50:16] Galatians chapter 2 Galatians 2 verse 1
[50:21] [Music]
[50:36] because we know that's the proof of a
[50:38] real Ministry of God is that the
[50:40] ministry produces god-given fruit which
[50:43] are souls souls believers those who have
[50:46] accepted it that's the fruit of the
[50:48] ministry praise God amen
[50:50] so Galatians 2 verse 1 then 14 years
[50:53] after I went up again to Jerusalem with
[50:55] Barnabas and took Titus with me also I
[50:58] went up by revelation all right there's
[51:00] that thought from this morning amen and
[51:02] communicated unto them that gospel which
[51:05] I preached among the Gentiles but
[51:06] privately to them which were of
[51:08] reputation lest by any means I should
[51:10] run or had run in vain but neither Titus
[51:14] who was with me being a greek was
[51:16] compelled to be circumcised and that
[51:19] because of false brethren unawares
[51:20] brought in who came in private to spy
[51:22] out our Liberty which we have in Christ
[51:25] Jesus that they might bring us into
[51:28] bondage to whom we gave place by
[51:30] subjection no not for an hour that the
[51:33] truth of the gospel might continue with
[51:37] you
[51:37] praise God so Paul had Timothy right
[51:39] here he had a Gentile right here amongst
[51:42] those Jews and said look at this Gentile
[51:45] look how he's so filled with faith look
[51:47] how he's so filled with power in other
[51:48] words he's gone through the open door he
[51:50] don't need to go through the law he
[51:52] needs he went through the open door he
[51:54] went through the baptism of the holy
[51:55] ghost and now he's my son so who were
[51:58] Paul's most faithful converts the
[52:00] Gentiles and yet he was a Jew because
[52:04] God had opened the door of faith to the
[52:05] Gentiles and he was the messenger to the
[52:08] Gentiles amen
[52:11] Titus was also an effective as Paul's
[52:14] ambassador and dealing with the
[52:16] Corinthian crisis and then later he
[52:19] represented the Christians represented
[52:22] the Apostle Paul to the Christians in
[52:24] Crete which was Titus 1:4 so Titus was
[52:28] in the city of Crete amen okay so I like
[52:33] that by God's grace I want to see that
[52:34] Paul's the father and he had these two
[52:37] sons in the gospel that came through the
[52:39] open door amen
[52:41] all right now let's finish up here I got
[52:44] a couple more scriptures I want to
[52:45] finish up on these
[52:46] by the grace of Lord okay so go to
[52:48] Colossians chapter 4 here Colossians 4
[52:55] verse 1 so I hope you can see tonight
[53:02] that's my goal for you can see the open
[53:03] door through the scripture and the
[53:05] different applications right you have
[53:07] the dispensation open door you have the
[53:10] six church age open door we have the
[53:12] open door that we must go through our
[53:14] local ministry and here's now what we
[53:17] can pray for as well in Colossians 4 we
[53:21] must pray for more open doors that's
[53:24] what we can do tonight as we close in a
[53:25] few moments can pray for open doors
[53:28] how many once the open door and their
[53:30] family how about an open door in a
[53:32] different City I like to see an open
[53:33] door in Doylestown you know I Drive
[53:35] through this might be something you but
[53:36] I drive through every town and when I
[53:38] Drive through these towns I see like
[53:40] storefront places that say for rent I
[53:42] just envisioned churches there I don't
[53:44] know about you but that's like I want to
[53:46] see it open I want to see a revival in
[53:48] Doylestown where I want to see a revival
[53:49] wodsworth other why couldn't just a
[53:51] little Church you know like a little
[53:52] message churches that's that's my desire
[53:55] I want to see open doors so we got to
[53:57] pray for open doors I got to keep
[53:59] praying for open doors this is what Paul
[54:02] said you must print we must pray for
[54:04] these so a Colossians 4 masters gay
[54:12] to your servants that which is just and
[54:14] equal knowing that ye also have a master
[54:17] in heaven
[54:18] now here's gets into the new thought now
[54:20] he transitions continue in prayer and
[54:24] watch in the same with Thanksgiving with
[54:29] all praying also for us or pray for the
[54:31] Apostles pray for Paul and all the
[54:33] Apostles that God would open unto us a
[54:38] door of utterance to speak the mystery
[54:42] of Christ for which I am also in bonds
[54:46] that I may make it manifest as I ought
[54:50] to speak in that beautiful he says I'm
[54:52] in jail right now but you need to pray
[54:55] that God will open up a door of
[54:57] utterance that I can share the mystery
[55:00] of Christ with other people in other
[55:02] places I thought you don't let you to
[55:04] appreciate that by God's grace we must
[55:07] pray for open doors and like I said
[55:11] that's what we'll do tonight here in
[55:12] just a moment let's read this last verse
[55:14] then revelation 3:20 and this is the age
[55:18] for us every person that gets to hear
[55:25] the message of the hour by the Holy
[55:28] Spirit is actually hearing the Holy
[55:30] Spirit cry out to them open the door to
[55:33] me that's what that's what happens when
[55:35] they get to hear about water baptism
[55:36] they got to hear about serpent seed when
[55:38] they get to hear about a prophet in this
[55:39] hour in Revelation 10 7 they're actually
[55:42] hearing the Holy Spirit say open the
[55:44] door I'm knocking will you let me in
[55:46] will you fellowship with me will you
[55:49] have communion with me praise God for
[55:51] the open door amen
[55:52] I love that revelation 3:20 behold I
[55:57] stand at the door and knock and If any
[55:59] man hear my voice and open the door
[56:02] because we have the door to the heart I
[56:04] will come in to him and will sup with
[56:07] him and he with me 10 that overcometh
[56:10] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[56:12] even as I also overcame and I'm set down
[56:16] with my father in his throne he that
[56:19] hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit
[56:22] says into the churches
[56:24] praise God let's turn our feet here
[56:25] we'll close
[56:26] with that one by God's grace so I'm
[56:29] going back to this err summary there's
[56:35] open door to the Philadelphia there's
[56:40] the open door of the Gentile
[56:41] dispensation of Prophet said the
[56:42] Pentecost
[56:43] that's what Adrienne right now there's
[56:46] open doors the local ministries there's
[56:49] open doors to heaven by vision there's
[56:51] open doors that Christ is asking for
[56:54] today but the most of Gentiles they're
[56:57] gonna ask for the open door too late
[56:59] they're gonna ask for the word of the
[57:01] hour the Holy Ghost
[57:02] they're gonna ask for that too late
[57:03] because it's being offered right now by
[57:06] God's grace
[57:07] how many appreciate that little study
[57:09] there by God's grace oh I love going to
[57:11] the scripture and looking at open doors
[57:13] and doors off in the New Testament it's
[57:15] there for us we've got to be faithful
[57:18] amen help me have it on their heart that
[57:20] God would open the door somewhere I
[57:22] constantly wonder I want to witness to
[57:24] somebody I want to want to see churches
[57:27] and little cities all over here I'd love
[57:29] to see that but something we have to
[57:32] pray for as Paul said pray for us that
[57:35] God would give us a door letters yeah I
[57:37] look at it to you I looked at Akron God
[57:40] gave me the door of utterance with the
[57:42] long church for a couple years I don't
[57:43] know if you remember where you hear
[57:44] anyone we they invited me to preach at
[57:46] their church two or three times that
[57:48] youth event three times I felt like God
[57:50] was offering them the open door and
[57:54] thank God you know the banks family came
[57:56] out you know then whoever the Amen so
[58:00] thank God for that
[58:00] we've got offer them the open door and I
[58:04] want to see more opportunities don't you
[58:05] want to see more open doors I can
[58:08] imagine if maybe the cost of church or
[58:10] Apostolic Church or Baptist Church in
[58:12] this area we just want to see God open
[58:15] doors so we can speak the mystery you
[58:17] know that reminds me this morning
[58:18] brother Jose wasn't here this morning do
[58:20] you tell you what okay
[58:21] he thought you I okay did you know okay
[58:23] sister guys I'll try to summarize a real
[58:25] quick
[58:25] he got a text from Simon or he thought
[58:27] it was signing my brother but it was a
[58:29] different Simon and Simon said we're
[58:31] gonna have a big service at this
[58:33] location we can you join us in Akron so
[58:35] he went expecting to see my brother and
[58:38] all of us there
[58:39] and it wasn't but they let him come up
[58:43] and testified he said he got to share
[58:44] about the message of the hour he got to
[58:46] share our YouTube channel with his
[58:48] testimony on it and there was I guess a
[58:50] hundred people there or someone that
[58:51] they really liked his testimony so he
[58:53] may go back there in the summer but that
[58:55] was strange on the name of reaching an
[58:57] open door obviously I got an open door
[58:58] there to share his testimony about the
[59:01] messages of the hour
[59:02] and how God's open those things to him
[59:04] so we'll just see we'll see we'll see if
[59:06] God will open a door one thing let's
[59:08] pray for let's pray for an open door
[59:11] praise God and that souls will open
[59:15] their hearts door to Christ so as we
[59:18] pray you know it's just our heads and
[59:20] think of someone you want to pray for or
[59:22] think of a city think of a town you want
[59:26] to see God give you a door of utterance
