[30:12] [Music]
[30:13] let's have a word of Prayer here
[30:15] Heavenly Father were so grateful that we
[30:17] know you Lord God and more importantly
[30:19] as your church age book says Lord that
[30:21] you knew us before the foundation of the
[30:23] world Lord before we were yet born Lord
[30:27] God you died the righteous for the
[30:29] unrighteous you for new Lord God our
[30:32] desire to love you so you made a way
[30:34] that we could Lord God thank you for
[30:36] this amazing love knowing you is the
[30:38] greatest privilege on this earth that we
[30:40] have Lord God Lord it keeps us gives us
[30:43] the anchor Lord in the midst of the
[30:44] storm in the midst of the
[30:46] disappointments and trials of life but
[30:48] yet we know they're more precious than
[30:50] gold as we saw last Wednesday night Lord
[30:52] the trial of your faith more precious
[30:56] and gold dear God Alleluia and your
[30:59] prophet said as we saw last week the
[31:02] test is the best thing that ever
[31:03] happened to us Lord God MA what inspired
[31:08] words Lord God just anchors tonight Lord
[31:11] a little deeper in your word a little
[31:13] deeper in your love Lord God ministered
[31:15] every need Lord through your word bless
[31:17] this word as I attempt to preach it I
[31:19] know I can't do it I need your help here
[31:22] through the saints Lord and let me hear
[31:24] as well Lord let faith come by hearing
[31:26] hearing by the Word of God that your
[31:29] Holy Ghost have preeminence here Lord
[31:31] bless this reading of thy word and bless
[31:33] each and every heart in Jesus Christ
[31:35] name Amen amen let's say I take our
[31:38] Bibles here tonight by God's grace like
[31:41] to go to Hebrews chapter 10 I like to
[31:46] look at part 3 of how can I overcome so
[31:48] let's look at that tonight Hebrews 10
[31:52] I'd like to go to verse let's start at
[31:57] verse 35
[32:08] [Music]
[32:14] Hebrews 10:35 my main Scripture was down
[32:27] to verse 39 but I just want to look at
[32:30] this idea of overcoming because the some
[32:35] of the examples we'll look at tonight
[32:36] but the Bram talks about missus lot and
[32:40] lot and lots daughters and in this
[32:42] sermon how can overcome so I like this
[32:45] this passage is really fitting because
[32:49] lot believed all the way till his soul
[32:51] was saved but mrs. Lott didn't believe
[32:54] long enough so let's go to the verse 35
[32:57] Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore
[33:00] your confidence which has great
[33:03] recompense of reward that's the thing I
[33:05] needed a few months ago I need now again
[33:06] by God's grace amen
[33:08] verse 36 for you have need a patience
[33:11] that after you've done the will of God
[33:13] you might receive the promise for yet a
[33:16] little while and he that shall come will
[33:19] come and will not tarry glory now the
[33:22] just shall live by faith in faith is a
[33:25] revelation of the will of God but if any
[33:29] man draw back from that the confidence
[33:32] in God my soul shall have no pleasure in
[33:34] him we are not of them which draw back
[33:37] unto perdition or destruction but of
[33:41] them that believe all the way to the
[33:43] saving of the soul now go to Luke 17
[33:47] this is a scripture milligram references
[33:50] Luke 17 I started verse 30 because
[33:54] that's a familiar scripture force how
[33:57] can I overcome let's look at again
[33:59] tonight by God's grace
[34:05] 17:30 that's all read that one because
[34:10] that's a very important scripture to us
[34:13] think about it Church most of the world
[34:15] can't see that the Son of Man has
[34:17] already come they can't even see it that
[34:20] a son a man has come to reveal the Son
[34:22] of Man and thank God that the Son of Man
[34:24] is still here praise God the Spirit of
[34:27] Jesus Christ is still here praise the
[34:28] Lord let's read verse 30 together one
[34:31] two three even thus shall it be in the
[34:35] day when the Son of Man is revealed now
[34:37] I'll read verse 31 and 32 in that day he
[34:41] which shall be upon the housetop and his
[34:44] stuff in the house let him not come down
[34:46] to take it away
[34:48] and he that is in the field
[34:52] let him likewise not returned back verse
[34:57] 32
[34:57] remember Lot's wife so let's have one
[35:02] more word of Prayer here if you ever
[35:03] need on your heart just make it unto God
[35:05] Heavenly Father we love you Lord God
[35:07] again we're grateful for your word your
[35:08] revelation we always want to believe
[35:12] Lord we always want to keep the faith we
[35:14] don't want to cast away our confidence
[35:16] or strengthen our confidence tonight in
[35:18] your word and your ways Lord let us with
[35:21] patience possess our souls Lord God
[35:23] thank you for your loving kindness it's
[35:25] better than life to your God so father
[35:27] bless this reading of our Lord and break
[35:29] the word of God to our hearts may be
[35:31] like bread for our souls Lord to feed
[35:33] our hungry souls and we're so thankful
[35:35] for your message Lord God you're sending
[35:37] your prophet and Lord that the Spirit of
[35:40] Christ the Son of man is still here
[35:42] today thank you lord
[35:43] encourage us strengthen us tonight in
[35:45] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[35:47] Amen god bless you be in seated praise
[35:49] God praise God you know I just got
[36:00] thinking of you know brother Samson and
[36:02] his family and I thought my how
[36:05] uncertain life is at times you know I
[36:08] just got it was just a burden for him
[36:10] and and I think of that people that have
[36:12] lived longer than him you know they're
[36:14] still alive that are older than him and
[36:16] I just thought my god just gives each
[36:17] person a certain number of days and we
[36:19] got to redeem the time praise God we got
[36:22] to be grateful for the time that we have
[36:23] we got to redeem all the time and make
[36:26] sure that we're always ready to meet the
[36:27] Lord praise God praise God I'd like to
[36:32] look at how can I overcome we've been
[36:35] looking at this the last few weeks here
[36:37] this is part three here now in our
[36:40] scripture here we see quite an overlap
[36:43] of prophecy because it overlaps our day
[36:49] as and it likens it unto the days of
[36:51] Noah and then as the days of a lot and
[36:54] then the Bible said it must be like this
[36:56] in the time when the Son of Man is
[36:58] revealed and we know the Son of man went
[37:00] to the Jews through Christ and the
[37:02] Samaritans in John chapter four but it
[37:05] never went to the Gentiles until our day
[37:07] and now the Son of Man has been revealed
[37:10] in a day when it's like the days of Noah
[37:12] and the days of son of man
[37:14] praise God now think about that think
[37:17] about how God Terri church Noah might
[37:19] have preached 120 years look how God
[37:22] tarry during that whole time and the age
[37:24] just kept getting worse and worse and
[37:26] worse but from the the days that Noah
[37:28] started ministering and preaching the
[37:30] word it was the days of Noah that whole
[37:32] time was it not and that's how it is
[37:34] today in the days of the voice of the
[37:36] seventh angel praise God in this days of
[37:39] where his message is still sounding it's
[37:42] still like the days of Noah still like
[37:44] the days of Sodom but thank God that the
[37:46] spirit of the son of man is here amen
[37:49] Jesus Christ spirit is still here still
[37:51] calling people to repent it's still
[37:52] calling people trying to get them in the
[37:54] ark of Christ for safety praise God and
[37:57] we're so thankful for that hallelujah
[37:59] hallelujah and it's a great overlap of
[38:02] the anointings of today the great evil
[38:06] anointing and brother I heard brother
[38:09] BAM say it and how can I overcome this
[38:10] morning I was listening to it or this
[38:12] afternoon rather brother BAM said this
[38:14] day is just getting gradually more
[38:16] deceptive and more deceptive each and
[38:18] every day he says getting worse and
[38:20] worse because it's more deceptive as we
[38:25] said on last week the enemy now comes in
[38:28] the name of Christianity
[38:29] right it comes to the name of the church
[38:31] and each day it gradually gets worse and
[38:33] worse it's kind like that illustration
[38:35] you've heard about a bog in boiling
[38:37] water right the Frog will sit there he
[38:40] just turned it up one degree at a time
[38:41] the frog will just sit there and then
[38:43] pretty soon it'll die when it's boiling
[38:44] because it just it's so gradual right
[38:48] the sin is so gradual right it just gets
[38:52] so as 1 degree worse one degree worse
[38:54] and that's what brother Bay I'm liking
[38:56] it unto he said first you know first he
[39:00] you know in the churches let's say in
[39:02] the days of brother Branham the first
[39:03] thing they did this they just started
[39:05] letting cut their hair a little bit
[39:06] right and wear short skirts a little bit
[39:08] and then they start letting them smoke
[39:10] cigarettes a little bit and they could
[39:12] still be church members right and then
[39:14] they could still sing in the choir right
[39:16] and then uh like I said like this so
[39:19] like the grandmas in the grandmas day we
[39:22] say like this and the grandmas day they
[39:24] cut their hair but they still have long
[39:25] dresses on well their daughters are they
[39:29] letting them cut their hair but then the
[39:30] skirts rose up and the next generation
[39:32] you got short skirts short hair next
[39:34] generation they're wearing pants the
[39:37] next generation they start showing off
[39:38] their chests next generation they start
[39:42] wearing even less and looking and now
[39:44] fast forward to today generation look
[39:46] what they wear now but slowly it was
[39:48] just one degree at a time right one one
[39:50] year at a time they just said it was so
[39:52] gradual now they don't even realize that
[39:54] they're spiritually so far back sidin
[39:57] don't even realize the insanity the age
[39:59] at that we're living in right they don't
[40:01] realize it but we see it and we got to
[40:04] make sure our eyes don't get
[40:05] desensitized to the evil but around said
[40:08] the closer you get to the light the more
[40:10] wicked it looks though this world and we
[40:13] got to say God God we got to press into
[40:16] the light of God amen
[40:17] we got to look full in his wonderful
[40:18] face make sure we're looking in the
[40:20] light of God so these things of the
[40:22] world they don't look okay
[40:23] but they look awful they look gradually
[40:27] worse and worse and worse and God's Word
[40:29] looks better and better amen but the
[40:31] message of God looks better and better
[40:33] all the time amen because it's holiness
[40:35] unto the Lord I'm just reading our
[40:38] scripture today let me uh yeah I didn't
[40:40] even plan to say this but let's go to
[40:41] Zechariah the last chapter
[40:43] I'm just reading this thought and is
[40:45] this a beautiful thought see the world's
[40:51] getting more unholy
[40:53] but church you and I got to get more
[40:55] holy don't we I was praying this morning
[40:57] and I was her money and I heard a
[40:58] preacher say one time he said he likes
[41:01] to wake up in the morning and he goes
[41:02] down to prayer and I even prayed us this
[41:04] morning but I like what he said he said
[41:07] Lord you know he confesses his sins and
[41:09] he says Lord I want to join I may have
[41:10] mentioned this before but he said I want
[41:12] to join the Angels because all the whole
[41:14] time I've been sleeping the Angels have
[41:16] been crying holy holy holy and I want to
[41:19] just wait now that I'm awake I'm gonna
[41:20] start joining those angels amen and cry
[41:23] holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[41:25] amen that the holiness of Christ remains
[41:29] real to us praise God well look at
[41:32] Zechariah the last chapter look at this
[41:35] now let me find the verse cuz like I
[41:37] said I didn't have this written out yeah
[41:42] now God promises he's going to restore
[41:47] worship now look at verse 16 this must
[41:50] be the the Millennium and it should come
[41:53] to pass that everyone that is left of
[41:55] all the nations which come up against
[41:57] Jerusalem shall even go up year to year
[41:59] to worship the king the Lord of hosts
[42:01] and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles now
[42:03] that makes it me think right there that
[42:05] some of the nations that gather against
[42:06] Israel and when Jesus smites them with
[42:09] the sword out of his mouth it makes me
[42:10] think that some of them are gonna
[42:11] survive that that's what it looks like
[42:14] here verse 17 it should come to pass
[42:16] that who so will not come up of all the
[42:19] families of the earth unto Jerusalem to
[42:21] worship the king the Lord of Hosts even
[42:22] upon them shall be no rain so this this
[42:26] is a striking picture of the Millennium
[42:29] verse 18 and if the family of Egypt go
[42:32] up not up and come not that have no rain
[42:35] there so there shall be the plague
[42:37] wherewith the Lord will smite the
[42:38] heathen that come not up to keep the
[42:40] Feast of Tabernacles this shall be the
[42:42] punishment of Egypt and the punishment
[42:43] of all nations that come down up to keep
[42:45] the Feast of Tabernacles in the in that
[42:48] day share there'll be a pond look the
[42:50] bells of the horses holiness unto the
[42:54] Lord so once this millennium sets in
[42:56] church
[42:57] for most of us know this my oh no we
[42:59] thought about this in the Old Testament
[43:01] only the priests had holiness to the
[43:04] Lord on them amen and it was something
[43:07] just it was just set aside for priests
[43:09] the holiness of God wasn't given to the
[43:11] common man it was just for a select few
[43:14] it was just for the priesthood natural
[43:16] but in the Millennium when Jesus comes
[43:19] back he brings such a such a judgment
[43:22] upon the people that not only did the
[43:24] priest not only to the King and priests
[43:26] have holiness but even the animals have
[43:29] holiness amen holiness has spread out
[43:32] just from God's presence and the
[43:34] believers and now it spread out to the
[43:36] entire earth amen and we will wake up we
[43:40] ought to say holy holy holy is the Lord
[43:42] God Almighty amen we ought to give God
[43:45] his glory let's finish the verse 20 and
[43:48] the pots in the Lord's house shall be
[43:50] like the bowls before the altar yay
[43:52] every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah
[43:54] shall be holiness in the Lord of Hosts
[43:57] my everything will speak of God's
[43:59] holiness and all they that set that
[44:02] sacrifice shall come and take of them
[44:03] and see therein and in that day there
[44:06] should be no more the Canaanite in the
[44:07] house of the Lord of Hosts amen so it
[44:10] speaks of a total cleansing a total
[44:12] holiness that will come upon the earth
[44:13] amen
[44:14] praise God I just thought I'd mention
[44:17] that I just read that this morning and
[44:19] that really struck me as inspired and
[44:22] not only do the priests have holiness
[44:23] but God's holiness will spread out to
[44:25] the entire world during the millennium
[44:28] amen where Jesus enjoys his his
[44:31] honeymoon thousand years of peace praise
[44:33] God now we read our text and now we
[44:39] looked at the examples we looked at Noah
[44:41] a couple of Sundays ago and we looked at
[44:44] last week looking at Daniel Wright and
[44:45] the three Hebrew children now brother
[44:47] branham's next overcomers was lot and
[44:50] his two daughters now by Ram starts by
[44:53] saying in the days of a lot Jesus
[44:56] referred to it there were only three
[44:58] that overcome
[44:59] lot and his two daughters not even his
[45:02] wife didn't overcome she started out as
[45:06] a type wish we had time she'd done all
[45:10] right
[45:11] she left so I want you to catch that
[45:16] there that he said she started out right
[45:18] but then she cuz she left she it was
[45:20] able to leave Sodom now brother man
[45:25] breaks into this thought and he goes
[45:27] directly to those in Jeffersonville that
[45:29] are listening he said many of you have
[45:31] left too many who left these things that
[45:34] take your stand after you searched it
[45:36] through the scripture and find it's
[45:37] right you seen the vindication of
[45:39] Almighty God not by some what somebody
[45:42] said was a vindication what the Bible
[45:44] said would be and here it is doing it
[45:46] you saw it was a truth so you set out to
[45:49] leave Sodom leave denominationally the
[45:51] things that bind you to a Creed and now
[45:53] look here's what he says you're
[45:54] following to follow Christ by the Holy
[45:57] Spirit vindicating himself by the
[46:00] written word amen
[46:03] so you and I are not following a creed
[46:04] we're not following a church tradition
[46:07] we're following the word that God has
[46:09] vindicated as his own word amen and see
[46:15] Church that's the reality the only
[46:17] reason people will turn away is because
[46:19] the word has it they haven't let it
[46:21] become a reality see when it becomes a
[46:25] reality to you and you love that reality
[46:27] more than you love the world then you'll
[46:29] follow Christ you'll follow the revealed
[46:31] Word all the days of your life because
[46:34] even even Judas had to admit that the
[46:37] word was being revealed he had to admit
[46:39] right because Peter said we all know and
[46:41] sure you're the son of God would you
[46:43] just was standing right there
[46:44] he never piped up and said I don't
[46:45] believe but see he loved money more they
[46:49] loved the revealed word amen
[46:51] we gotta love the reveal word more than
[46:53] we love money or fame or popularity or
[46:55] friendships or any relationship we gotta
[46:58] love the Word of God more than anything
[47:00] but Judas saw the word vindicated Balaam
[47:04] saw the word vindicated right they all
[47:06] saw vindicated Cain sought indicated but
[47:09] he didn't love it more than he loved the
[47:10] things of the world we've got to love
[47:13] the things of the world so that's what
[47:15] program says we're not finding Creed's
[47:16] were following Christ and the Holy
[47:18] Spirit as he vindicates his written word
[47:22] so in other words God has proven to you
[47:25] and I
[47:25] that this word is the right revelation
[47:27] of God brother William I've been to too
[47:30] many churches and I know that they don't
[47:32] have the vindicated written word amen
[47:34] because they love sin more than they
[47:36] love the word amen
[47:38] they love Hollywood more they love the
[47:40] Word of God God has vindicated that this
[47:43] word is right amen not only that but
[47:46] he's done healings and saved my soul and
[47:47] save different ones my family members
[47:49] came and and brother Tim Myers as we've
[47:52] been sharing the last few weeks
[47:53] he's vindicated me that this word is
[47:55] right and I got to choose now that I
[47:57] know it's vindicated I gotta choose use
[47:58] of the word or the world I'll take the
[48:00] word every time
[48:01] amen seven out of seven times amen
[48:08] program says in other words you took the
[48:10] Bible now you didn't say me he said you
[48:13] took the Bible instead of the Creed you
[48:16] set out to follow see that but I've
[48:20] never exalted himself and said you gotta
[48:21] follow me and obey all me now of course
[48:23] we do we follows Bible based teaching
[48:25] but we don't worship brother Branham
[48:27] like many do today he said Lot's wife
[48:29] did the same thing you know she set out
[48:30] to go with lot follow her husband her
[48:33] children her loved ones but it wasn't in
[48:35] her heart she still loved the world so
[48:38] it's possible you can make a star and
[48:40] still be and I'm trying still have the
[48:43] world in you she never overcome even
[48:47] though listen she was well on the road
[48:49] to overcoming wasn't she she was well on
[48:52] the road ma she was can we say like this
[48:55] she was a mile away from being from Oh
[48:58] being an overcomer I imagine she maybe
[49:01] walked up maybe a mile outside the city
[49:03] who knows how far it was but man said
[49:04] they had some proof of it but I've I've
[49:07] never studied enough to find it where
[49:08] the pillar of salt was still there I've
[49:10] never really looked to find it uh but
[49:13] who knows how far think about how far
[49:15] she made it out and then how close she
[49:17] was to be the over cover but it wasn't
[49:22] in her heart and that proves that we can
[49:24] take people very far we can take him as
[49:26] far as we can and I'll say like this
[49:28] brother William the Angels took him that
[49:30] far remember the Bible of the Angels
[49:32] dragging them out angels will take
[49:34] people so far in the message but if the
[49:36] love of God is not in their heart
[49:38] they're gonna turn
[49:39] crowd and long for the things of the
[49:40] world huh he said even though she was
[49:45] well on her road it finally over throat
[49:48] her she had to take one big long last
[49:51] look and that's where she got caught
[49:53] brother Ram screams and I said don't
[49:55] even look back
[49:56] he said don't have no desires keep going
[49:59] put your mind on Calvary and keep moving
[50:03] towards Christ I'd say if you ever have
[50:05] a mind battle think about the cross of
[50:07] Jesus Christ I think about that many
[50:08] times when I go through my battles I
[50:10] think of that scene from the passion
[50:12] movie now it's a Catholic movie but
[50:14] there are certain scenes of it that are
[50:15] very good and I think of Jesus and he's
[50:17] all torn up and and all the blood and I
[50:20] think of that I think and when I'm
[50:21] thinking about having my battles the
[50:23] mind battles fade away when I think
[50:25] about the bleeding Christ when I think
[50:27] about that bloody dying that precious
[50:29] Lamb shall never lose its power amen
[50:31] when I think of that the things of the
[50:34] world the temptations fade away because
[50:36] I think of the love of God that he would
[50:37] sacrifice his own son the Bible said he
[50:40] made his soul on a sacrifice and
[50:42] offering for sin for the joy that was
[50:45] set before and that joy was to save our
[50:47] souls amen and how can i how can i how
[50:52] can I accept sinful evil thoughts when I
[50:55] also I can think of as the cross of
[50:57] Calvary amen and think of how far God
[50:59] went to love me and forgive me how can I
[51:02] entertain evil thoughts when that when
[51:04] the thoughts of Christ are so real in
[51:06] our minds he said don't even look back
[51:10] don't have no desires put your mind on
[51:12] Calvary and keep moving towards Christ
[51:14] amen but man they look program goes into
[51:19] what happened here she started out as to
[51:23] overcome her but she never did overcome
[51:26] he said oh she left the denomination she
[51:29] did she walked out of Sodom with a lot
[51:31] but she wanted to go back and have her
[51:34] hair cut you know what I mean so you can
[51:35] in other words he means you can put any
[51:37] sin in there any worldly sin whether
[51:41] it's a man or woman right cuz you just
[51:42] turn around for money right doesn't
[51:44] matter what's in it is cut the hair
[51:46] beauty money whatever it is he says you
[51:50] know what I mean she had to go back
[51:53] she's just couldn't stand the test now
[51:55] look at her test her test with program
[51:58] says was her screaming dying friends and
[52:01] family members that was her test she had
[52:05] to hear that and endure that in other
[52:07] words she had to escape she had to love
[52:10] the the escape of God more than even
[52:13] family she had he said but she had to
[52:20] look back again to see what the rest of
[52:21] them was doing now look my man says what
[52:24] she was thinking you know had some good
[52:26] friends down there after all after all
[52:28] this might be just a little move I don't
[52:30] know whether it could be right or not
[52:32] look at that maybe maybe the fire hadn't
[52:35] fallen yet I never thought about that so
[52:38] see she was convinced well maybe maybe
[52:40] this message isn't exactly right maybe
[52:42] that's just a fanatical move look at
[52:45] this road man says he says I don't know
[52:48] whether it could be right or not I've
[52:49] only got this man's word for it though
[52:51] he's my husband
[52:53] so see her husband loved the Lord but
[52:57] she kind of said I'm just taking his
[52:59] experience for I've seen what God did in
[53:01] my husband's life and I'm just going to
[53:04] lean upon that so she was leaning on
[53:07] somebody else's experience more than her
[53:09] own and each of us each of us need to
[53:12] have a burning bush experience amen
[53:13] where you meet God for yourself praise
[53:16] God and God Commission's you and gives
[53:18] you a purpose in life gives you a
[53:20] ministry and you've got to be faithful
[53:22] with it but her test was to leave those
[53:27] things he says she said I don't know
[53:30] whether it could be right or not I've
[53:32] only got my husband's word for but man
[53:34] said your pastor is your husband
[53:35] spiritually speaking which means I just
[53:39] preached the word to you it doesn't mean
[53:40] i lord over you like some preachers do
[53:42] well you can't go here you can't go
[53:44] there you know I you need to dress like
[53:46] this or you need to brush your teeth
[53:48] like this so yeah you need to tie your
[53:49] shoes like this or you know I'll give
[53:52] you my wisdom on it look horse I'll give
[53:53] you my mom things like somebody sent me
[53:55] a message this week and they said oh I
[53:58] was reading your book oh yeah somebody
[54:00] got my book and read it and they said
[54:02] they loved it but they had two questions
[54:03] what about beards and what about women
[54:05] wearing flip-flops to church
[54:06] I said I said he said why didn't you
[54:09] cover that your book I said well I never
[54:10] thought about it I never really have
[54:12] those problems you like some churches
[54:14] back battle so I said for beers I said
[54:17] there's only two scriptures the Old
[54:18] Testament that really talked about it
[54:20] and it's mostly for the priests I said
[54:22] but you never see Paul riding anything
[54:24] about beers to New Testament Gentiles so
[54:27] I said it's just the area of Liberty I
[54:29] said to me it doesn't bother but I said
[54:31] if I the choice I'm gonna follow brother
[54:33] Graham's example he didn't he shaved his
[54:35] face I'm gonna that's why I always shave
[54:36] my face if you see me have a beard just
[54:38] cuz I'm too tired to shave it you know
[54:39] but I read it really can't even grow
[54:41] beard but I'm not sure sure how I got
[54:44] here anyway my goodness what the the
[54:46] flip-flop thing was I said well it don't
[54:48] really bother me at the if sisters wear
[54:50] flip-flops are you my own children as
[54:51] long as they're not noisy because the
[54:54] women and Isaiah three had tinkling of
[54:56] their feet you know of course they
[54:57] probably had long I don't like a
[54:59] high-heeled thing you know or but in
[55:01] other words like it makes too much noise
[55:03] like it's distracting or something like
[55:05] that but I don't care if they show their
[55:07] toe I don't even look at your toes I
[55:08] don't even know what your toes are I'm
[55:10] not looking at that I'm looking at as
[55:12] your heart hungry for God amen and of
[55:16] course the high heels well we should
[55:17] know better than that you know we I bet
[55:18] videos on that if you want to watch that
[55:20] it ruins your body not only that but it
[55:23] ruins your faith you know it props up
[55:25] their body like a sexual temptation and
[55:27] he said he said so he said I really like
[55:29] your response that's what I thought
[55:30] you'd say I thought well I thought you
[55:32] were trying to test me so he was
[55:35] expecting me to say that but see there's
[55:40] these areas where pastors your husband
[55:42] as far as he's gonna give you the word
[55:44] he's trying to lead you to Christ amen
[55:47] but she said well I don't I don't know
[55:49] whether it could be right or not I don't
[55:50] know maybe his revelation wasn't right I
[55:57] want to bring this thought out where is
[55:59] about friends he says oh I've got some
[56:02] real good friends out there you know
[56:03] when I was talking to Austin on the
[56:05] phone a few weeks ago he was telling me
[56:08] about I also got to do is lose him for a
[56:09] few friends and I said brother Austin
[56:11] let me tell you the friends that I left
[56:13] for this message turned out not even to
[56:16] be friends because you know what most of
[56:18] them most of them had a
[56:19] demon on them none of them are saying
[56:22] hey come smoke cigarettes or come commit
[56:24] adultery or or come do drugs with me or
[56:26] come you know do cocaine nothin we're
[56:28] saying that what they're trying to do is
[56:30] get me to compromise that their churches
[56:33] were just as good as ours but that's not
[56:34] true because our church has the true
[56:37] atonement the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[56:39] and it's not that we're better but what
[56:42] I mean is we have a more powerful work
[56:44] we have a more sure word of prophecy
[56:45] amen
[56:46] we've got in other words we got the
[56:48] revelation the hour and those religious
[56:50] demons are gonna try to get you to
[56:52] compromise and stay in churches like
[56:54] that and you know I've watched their
[56:56] lives too you know one of my friends
[56:57] he's the one that told me this my best
[56:59] friend he said the water baptism was of
[57:01] the double he showed me that and brother
[57:03] at William I went on Facebook a few
[57:04] years ago and for Halloween he dresses
[57:06] up for Halloween claims to be all
[57:08] religious and wore a Halloween of a
[57:11] Native American you know how they barely
[57:13] had any clothes on and exposes his
[57:16] behind because they did that so he's
[57:18] almost basically naked and the one and
[57:21] Susy to me that's like a fruit of that
[57:24] spirit that religious demon that was
[57:27] coming against our revelation I said no
[57:30] I said turn that down and so see that's
[57:32] not a real friend any friend that would
[57:34] take you away from the Word of God it's
[57:36] not a friend amen
[57:37] but missus look back another what for
[57:40] what friends I got
[57:41] oh yeah the same friends that think it's
[57:42] okay to commit homosexuality the same
[57:45] friends and it's okay to smoke and drink
[57:47] and cuss and worship sports and then go
[57:49] to church and and believe in a sprinklin
[57:51] instead of the real water baptism of the
[57:53] Bible those aren't friends Jesus Christ
[57:56] is a friend that sticks closer than a
[57:58] brother amen and he's the Lord
[57:59] hallelujah
[58:00] so I told him brother Austin I said look
[58:03] those people all those that said they
[58:04] were my friends they're not my friends
[58:06] I'm losing a little bit of Court here
[58:08] and I need that extra six inches of cord
[58:09] air there we go so I can get it let me
[58:11] see if I can get out here glory here we
[58:14] go
[58:14] amen thank the Lord so you children or
[58:20] anyone that's wonders about friends only
[58:23] the only true friend there are is a word
[58:26] friend and let me say like this a word
[58:30] family member too
[58:33] rather we're but we're more family than
[58:35] some of my own natural family because we
[58:37] agree on the word right I got a lot of
[58:41] in-laws and I got a lot of cousins and
[58:44] aunts and uncles but actually you and I
[58:46] are more family than we I am with them
[58:48] amen that's right because we're under
[58:52] the same blood we got the same blood
[58:54] flowing through our veins now not
[58:55] natural spiritual but we're bought by
[58:58] the precious blood of Jesus amen that's
[59:01] why I'm here with you guys and sitting
[59:02] with my natural family amen
[59:05] so I've got a no doubt I mean part of me
[59:07] wants to go back to my natural family
[59:09] but see Jesus has called me to be a part
[59:11] of this spiritual family amen to
[59:14] strengthen the Saints to edify them to
[59:16] preach God's Word amen hallelujah feed
[59:19] God's sheep hallelujah so I was telling
[59:22] our brother the Bible said a friend
[59:25] sticks close to the brother when I left
[59:26] those friends and came the message none
[59:28] of them stuck they all they all
[59:29] abandoned me but now I come to message
[59:33] my real friends stick with me even in
[59:34] the hard times right now they care they
[59:37] won't know how you doing brother Jesse
[59:38] how you doing are you need any prayer
[59:40] those are the real kind of friends amen
[59:43] hallelujah so see mrs. lot got all
[59:47] confused her real friends were the ones
[59:48] out here that one to leave that place
[59:50] right her two daughters and and her
[59:53] husband those were real friends but she
[59:55] got caught up when to go back to her old
[59:57] friends that's what brother mam said he
[1:00:01] said oh I had some good friends down
[1:00:02] there we had some great times really
[1:00:05] those were great times the Bible said
[1:00:09] that lot soul was vexed every day by all
[1:00:11] the evil things he saw all the all the
[1:00:15] gang the gang mobs and and then the
[1:00:17] homosexuality prevalent and the mixed
[1:00:19] marriages and sorry the homosexual
[1:00:22] marriages that's why I'm talking about
[1:00:23] it was vex mind every day and she missed
[1:00:27] that she missed the torment so that
[1:00:29] means she didn't she wasn't tormented
[1:00:31] she enjoyed it because lot it's so
[1:00:35] tormented him he could he could keep us
[1:00:37] back from it he knew it was a torment
[1:00:39] but to her it wasn't much of a torment
[1:00:41] because she loved the things that were
[1:00:43] there she
[1:00:46] most overcame and Jesus said remember
[1:00:49] that person Amen who almost overcame
[1:00:53] remember that one because the fact that
[1:00:56] you're in church tonight you're on your
[1:00:58] road overcoming thank God for that
[1:01:00] but remember Lot's wife that we don't
[1:01:02] miss the world we don't miss some
[1:01:04] friends we don't miss anything
[1:01:07] he said have no desires put your mind on
[1:01:09] Calvary and keep moving towards Christ
[1:01:12] amen so see she never had her own
[1:01:15] experience she was just taking her
[1:01:18] husband or her pastors were brothers
[1:01:20] just taking her pastor's word for it the
[1:01:24] RAM said see if you're not perfectly
[1:01:26] satisfied you're not perfectly know that
[1:01:28] it's the Word of God then you can't go
[1:01:31] you gotta be really sold out you've got
[1:01:34] to know not just say well I see others
[1:01:37] doing it I see a sign so you got to know
[1:01:40] for yourself
[1:01:41] well Ram said missus lot was like Israel
[1:01:44] that left Egypt for the Promised Land
[1:01:47] he said they taught started out two
[1:01:48] million strong and ended up with only
[1:01:50] two men they saw the works of God they
[1:01:54] saw the manifestation the Holy Spirit
[1:01:56] they saw a great and mighty miracles
[1:01:58] being done in Egypt and everything and
[1:01:59] started out but it wasn't in their heart
[1:02:02] they didn't overcome they just came out
[1:02:04] and jesus said they perish in the
[1:02:07] wilderness amen every one of them died
[1:02:10] he said every one of them rotted in the
[1:02:12] wilderness cuz overcoming wasn't really
[1:02:14] in their hearts so see Church we got a
[1:02:17] great a great reminder here that
[1:02:19] overcoming is keeping the revelation
[1:02:22] until you die amen
[1:02:24] it's keeping it through death amen not
[1:02:28] just up to death but all the way through
[1:02:29] death amen be thou faithful unto death
[1:02:33] the Bible says amen
[1:02:34] not just till you die but unto it to
[1:02:38] whatever life hold whatever God's will
[1:02:40] holds for you you're faithful all the
[1:02:42] way to the end
[1:02:46] no man said there was only to overcomers
[1:02:49] Joshua and Caleb Knox we know Miriam was
[1:02:52] saved and Aaron and Moses was saved he
[1:02:55] says but there's only two overcomers
[1:02:57] when it came to the showdown and the
[1:02:59] obstacles look so great
[1:03:00] so they look like grasshoppers and
[1:03:02] Joshua screamed not with Caleb can you
[1:03:04] imagine there's only two of them they're
[1:03:05] side-by-side they screamed now he says
[1:03:08] we're more than able to do it so
[1:03:11] overcomers will scream out today we're
[1:03:13] more than able to take a rapture amen
[1:03:15] we're more than able to overcome
[1:03:18] Laodicea everybody else how can we do it
[1:03:21] we can't have more kids because like
[1:03:23] some people told me we can't have more
[1:03:25] kids because they won't overcome their
[1:03:27] to see you and somebody else don't mean
[1:03:28] I couldn't marry a husband or wife
[1:03:30] because of Laodicea come on we're more
[1:03:33] than conquerors I don't care how big the
[1:03:34] Giant is we've got Jesus Christ on our
[1:03:37] side amen
[1:03:38] we're giant Slayers cuz we got the Word
[1:03:40] of God amen hallelujah tell me they're
[1:03:44] scared to have marriage isn't scared to
[1:03:47] have children because of laodicea I
[1:03:48] don't fear no Goliath because I've got
[1:03:50] Jesus Christ on my side amen and you
[1:03:54] shouldn't be scared either do we respect
[1:03:55] of course yes we respect it we wait upon
[1:03:57] the Lord we wait for the leadership of
[1:04:00] the Lord but we do not fear because the
[1:04:02] spirit of fear wasn't given to us
[1:04:04] st. might have put our name on it but
[1:04:06] that package doesn't belong to us amen
[1:04:08] the promises of God belong to us the
[1:04:10] sharp short the double-edged sword of
[1:04:12] the word belongs to us amen hallelujah
[1:04:18] he said they were the overcomers they
[1:04:21] were the ones that was privileged out of
[1:04:23] the whole gray organization of people to
[1:04:24] take the real elected bride into the
[1:04:27] promised land Joshua and Caleb in the
[1:04:31] front lines out there as two generals
[1:04:33] led them down to the river and cross the
[1:04:35] river over in the promise and why they
[1:04:37] believed the word no matter what amen
[1:04:42] a church how do they believe it numbers
[1:04:43] 14 tells us number 14 numbers 14 23 if
[1:04:47] you want to pull it up there acacia how
[1:04:50] did he do it how did Caleb do it how did
[1:04:52] Joshua do it the Bible tells us how do
[1:04:56] they overcome numbers 14 23 surely they
[1:05:00] shall not see the land which I swear
[1:05:02] unto their fathers neither shall any of
[1:05:03] them that provoke me see it numbers 14
[1:05:07] 24 here it is but my servant Caleb
[1:05:11] because he hath an over
[1:05:14] her spirit with him amen and I followed
[1:05:17] me fully amen see we've got to have a
[1:05:20] different spirit praise God the only way
[1:05:23] to overcome is to have the holy spirit
[1:05:25] praise God because he's the real
[1:05:27] overcomer praise God we just yield our
[1:05:29] will to him and then he works his will
[1:05:31] inside of us amen
[1:05:34] how can I be an overcomer with these
[1:05:36] great giants and how can I be overcome
[1:05:38] or make the promised land have a real
[1:05:40] spirit of Christ in you amen
[1:05:44] him will I bring into the land wherewith
[1:05:47] he went and his seed shall possess it
[1:05:49] hallelujah praise God now the next
[1:05:56] example program gives he still the same
[1:05:57] example of missus lot and then now he
[1:05:59] says it's the same thing she started out
[1:06:02] but turn back just like Israel started
[1:06:04] out but many of them turned back and he
[1:06:06] says day 'then raised up and so did cora
[1:06:10] they tried to say this man is trying to
[1:06:13] make himself above all the rest of us
[1:06:15] he's more holy than the rest of the
[1:06:17] remember that days that in coral raised
[1:06:18] up and said oh we're just as holy as you
[1:06:20] guys what do you think you're so great
[1:06:23] remember what did Moses and Aaron do
[1:06:24] when a boxing match we're to punch him
[1:06:26] out know the Bible said they went and
[1:06:28] interceded for them they ran the
[1:06:31] presence of God they ran in their prayer
[1:06:33] life amen they ran to their prayer life
[1:06:35] and say God have mercy on them Moses was
[1:06:38] saying something like this I don't have
[1:06:39] the exact quote he was saying do you
[1:06:41] think I'd call myself to this do you
[1:06:43] think God volunteered for this it's God
[1:06:46] that sent me praise God and each one of
[1:06:48] us had we should be able to say that do
[1:06:49] you think we volunteered for this as far
[1:06:51] as that we knew all the battles God
[1:06:53] called us to this word God called us to
[1:06:55] the message God called us to living this
[1:06:58] time and we're overcomers amen
[1:07:00] we're doing this by the leadership of
[1:07:02] God not the leadership of man he said
[1:07:07] after God had thoroughly vindicated the
[1:07:09] man they said we'll just start a group
[1:07:10] of people and we'll make this or that or
[1:07:12] the other we'll make our organizations
[1:07:14] and they died and perished
[1:07:16] now since brother I mentioned Korah I'm
[1:07:19] gonna bring up this quote I read earlier
[1:07:21] about Korah from the church age book
[1:07:23] brother Ram said the Korah he said call
[1:07:28] the men of today the the core men's
[1:07:30] today said our businessman and I preach
[1:07:33] this when we looked at the Jefferson
[1:07:34] Mill Doctrine I don't know if you
[1:07:35] remember this code or not it's from
[1:07:36] chapter 4 the smyrnaean church age
[1:07:39] program said they the businessmen have
[1:07:41] styled themselves the fishers of men and
[1:07:43] the founders of a move of God and they
[1:07:46] say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4
[1:07:48] 10 to 13 that God gave the church has
[1:07:51] failed so they're taken over so Motorama
[1:07:54] identifies Korah and Dathan for today
[1:07:57] they're businessmen that are taken over
[1:07:59] the pulpits and saying that preachers
[1:08:01] have failed he said they're they called
[1:08:06] the gain sayings of tokura and they
[1:08:08] don't even know that they fulfilled it
[1:08:10] so that's how we recognize who the
[1:08:12] chorus are today they're the ones saying
[1:08:15] the fivefold ministries failed and so
[1:08:17] they need to lead us you know what's
[1:08:19] interesting I got a text this week and
[1:08:22] so did some of the brothers so I'm sure
[1:08:24] some of you know what I'm talking about
[1:08:27] if you're not sure you can ask me
[1:08:29] afterwards I got a text this week that
[1:08:31] said it was it was mocking the fivefold
[1:08:34] ministry and it was mocking that the
[1:08:37] fact that we believed that when the
[1:08:40] rapture happens these bodies will be
[1:08:42] swallowed up and will go to meet Christ
[1:08:44] in the air literally how many believe
[1:08:46] we're gonna literally meet Christ in the
[1:08:47] air well we are mocked Church were
[1:08:49] mocked because we believe we're gonna
[1:08:51] meet in the literal air we are mocked
[1:08:53] and so someone said the brothers attacks
[1:08:56] this week mocking us for believing that
[1:09:00] and so this person said that what that
[1:09:04] one that if this happens all the other
[1:09:07] message preachers that believe this will
[1:09:10] drop their clothes and be naked now the
[1:09:12] Calico look how perverted this mind is
[1:09:14] now they don't even realize that when
[1:09:17] they drop the clothes don't he realized
[1:09:19] that we get a brand-new body when that
[1:09:20] happens we get our theophanies amen how
[1:09:24] do you amen and whoever said God's gonna
[1:09:26] leave the clothes he might just banish
[1:09:28] them all up you might descend to grade
[1:09:29] them all up who said that so this spirit
[1:09:32] is now mocking the fivefold ministry and
[1:09:34] saying uh-oh
[1:09:36] so the message preachers when they get
[1:09:37] raptured they're gonna have no clothes
[1:09:39] and so this person said why don't
[1:09:41] fly up there and buy these suits off
[1:09:43] Amazon and and go clothe them with that
[1:09:46] now what a bunch of nonsense is that now
[1:09:49] what kind of a what kind of a a Backson
[1:09:51] in mind would even like to imagine that
[1:09:54] we see their attack in the fivefold
[1:09:56] ministry that's a chorus pierre --it
[1:09:58] that's a de 'then spirit that's a
[1:10:00] businessman spirit that's not the Spirit
[1:10:02] of Christ because Jesus he after he
[1:10:05] ascended he said the best thing I can
[1:10:07] send the church is five gifts of the
[1:10:10] Holy Spirit to unify the faith of the
[1:10:12] saints amen
[1:10:13] so I just thought I'd share that any of
[1:10:15] that we still get attacked I still get
[1:10:17] mocked and made fun of like that
[1:10:18] all because I believe that we're gonna
[1:10:21] have a meeting in the air amen and I've
[1:10:23] got quotes on it but I said I read it to
[1:10:25] you last week might be said our bones
[1:10:27] will rise and go to meet Christ in the
[1:10:29] air he said we will rise to meet Christ
[1:10:32] in the air he said between the heavens
[1:10:34] and earth we'll meet him in the air
[1:10:36] hallelujah just like Isaac wasn't in the
[1:10:38] tent and he wasn't out there he was in
[1:10:40] the field he was in the between part and
[1:10:43] that's where we meet Christ in the air
[1:10:44] in that between part in the air amen
[1:10:47] that's right but see people can still
[1:10:51] mock preachers and make fun of them
[1:10:53] that's fine they can do that if they
[1:10:54] want but it's a core move the core move
[1:10:57] says that the fivefold ministries failed
[1:10:59] and that's what Caleb and Joshua
[1:11:02] overcame we praise God
[1:11:06] we'll overcome that corn Dathan movement
[1:11:08] hallelujah just got to say with the word
[1:11:10] God will vindicate which group is on his
[1:11:13] side hallelujah now Brennan says see
[1:11:19] those men had the word of the Lord came
[1:11:21] and Joshua and they stayed with it and
[1:11:23] they went over but man says it's not he
[1:11:25] that starts it's he that finishes many
[1:11:29] start the race but there's one finishing
[1:11:32] it though me many churches start many
[1:11:34] groups of people there'll be only one
[1:11:36] group finish that's the overcomers in
[1:11:39] lots they yes she had that one great
[1:11:43] long look back oh I'm leaving so-and-so
[1:11:45] down there then fine times we used to
[1:11:48] have I never forget it
[1:11:50] can you imagine me in a blood bought
[1:11:52] blood wash Holy Ghost filled Saint
[1:11:55] having the righteousness of Christ and
[1:11:57] then long for the Irishman I wish I
[1:11:59] could just go back to those days in the
[1:12:00] bar I wish I could go just go back and
[1:12:03] have one more cigarette no not a real
[1:12:05] Holy Ghost field st. hey amen but that's
[1:12:09] what mrs. Lott was doing oh I'll never
[1:12:11] forget what great times we had any time
[1:12:14] you had that that mocked Christianity
[1:12:16] any time you had that exalted the the
[1:12:18] sin of the world or lust of the flesh it
[1:12:21] wasn't a good time it was a bad time and
[1:12:23] we thank God for the holy times that we
[1:12:25] have in Christ Jesus oh I'll never
[1:12:30] forget it those old fine times we used
[1:12:32] to have and she was caught she was shut
[1:12:34] out like in the days of Noah
[1:12:36] she was shut out without mercy and she
[1:12:38] perished enough isn't that amazing
[1:12:41] Church Peter said that lot had a
[1:12:43] righteous soul so that means mrs. Lott
[1:12:46] soul was unrighteous she didn't really
[1:12:50] believe she didn't really believe the
[1:12:53] Word of God so lot was righteous like
[1:12:55] yeah that's really evil I'm gonna
[1:12:57] overcome this age I'm gonna armor I'm
[1:12:59] gonna do what's right but she her soul
[1:13:01] wasn't like that she's like well I guess
[1:13:04] I'll just follow him he's my husband you
[1:13:05] know God had me to marry him I guess
[1:13:07] I'll just stay with him but she really
[1:13:09] have the revelation herself but he was a
[1:13:12] righteous man in other words he did what
[1:13:13] was right
[1:13:14] he didn't leave that lived the same life
[1:13:16] Abraham did but he'd lived a righteous
[1:13:18] life see Jesus is referring to missus
[1:13:25] lot and he says not to come down to take
[1:13:28] your things away I was looking at some
[1:13:30] history the houses in those days were so
[1:13:32] close together that if somebody was on
[1:13:34] the roof they could just jump from like
[1:13:37] house to house I guess some of them were
[1:13:38] so close and they could keep going until
[1:13:41] they could get you know to the last
[1:13:43] house where I had a stairs they could go
[1:13:44] down but Jesus saying you wouldn't want
[1:13:48] to go down your own into your own house
[1:13:50] cuz you might be tempted to grab things
[1:13:52] it would slow you down
[1:13:53] in other words Jesus saying don't let
[1:13:55] anything slow you down missus lot let
[1:13:58] something slower down in other words
[1:14:00] when we come to Christ we got to give
[1:14:02] all of our effort to make momentum in
[1:14:04] our Christian journey amen not to stop
[1:14:07] and slow down
[1:14:09] got to keep memorizing the Bible we got
[1:14:10] to keep believing the Word of God we got
[1:14:12] to keep praying we got to keep the
[1:14:14] momentum going forward amen don't know
[1:14:17] don't give yourself any opportunity see
[1:14:19] don't go down in your own house because
[1:14:20] you might want to take this and this and
[1:14:22] that and they'll slow you down
[1:14:25] that's what Jesus says don't even come
[1:14:27] down that take it away he says in other
[1:14:31] words we ought to be happy just getting
[1:14:32] our soul saved because church you and
[1:14:34] I've been to enough funerals those
[1:14:35] people don't take those fancy suits with
[1:14:37] them they don't take those rings with
[1:14:38] them their body stays there their
[1:14:41] balloons stay there they're flowers stay
[1:14:42] there they go down the grave the only
[1:14:44] thing we're taking with us is our godly
[1:14:45] character our righteous Souls amen
[1:14:48] praise God don't even worry about that
[1:14:52] he said and then Jesus says not to
[1:14:54] return back he gives two illustrations
[1:14:56] don't come down and take it away and
[1:14:58] then not return back because she would
[1:15:02] because perhaps she wanted to go back
[1:15:03] and get her stuff remember brother man
[1:15:05] said said she was always buying brand
[1:15:07] new dresses member Graham said that he
[1:15:09] said Sarah was all kind of upset you
[1:15:11] know because she was they had a little
[1:15:12] drought and they were they were out
[1:15:14] there in the wilderness but he said mrs.
[1:15:15] Locke got all the new dresses and she
[1:15:17] had all her fine stitching and sewing
[1:15:19] and really gossiping parties that's what
[1:15:22] she had her gossiping in her
[1:15:24] Entertainment Weekly and her her
[1:15:26] Hollywood weekly news parties ma but she
[1:15:31] loved that she wanted to go back to that
[1:15:33] more than she wanted to escape judgment
[1:15:36] because she loved that more ssin than
[1:15:38] she loved the Word of God I thank the
[1:15:43] Lord
[1:15:43] Wow I got five minutes because I set my
[1:15:46] clock for 45 minutes I think I'll do
[1:15:51] that too I think I'll do that
[1:15:57] in the in the sake of of this thought
[1:15:59] this is where I thought I would finish
[1:16:01] so let me uh we try to finish here now I
[1:16:05] want to flip back to Luke 17 real quick
[1:16:07] to make sure I get those two those two
[1:16:09] illustrations Jesus gives ya ones on the
[1:16:14] housetop and then he that's in the field
[1:16:16] let him not like wise not return back so
[1:16:21] if you're out if you're caught out in
[1:16:22] the field you want to return back to
[1:16:26] your house and get a few things before
[1:16:27] you escape judgment right that's what
[1:16:29] Jesus said the temptation would be ones
[1:16:32] on the housetop you don't want to go
[1:16:33] down to your house the other ones you're
[1:16:35] out in the field oh I'm at work I better
[1:16:37] run home real quick and get my wallet so
[1:16:39] I don't miss so I might need the money
[1:16:42] and Jesus saying don't let any
[1:16:45] temptation slow you down from over
[1:16:47] coming amen that's the reality of a
[1:16:50] praise God don't let any worldly thing
[1:16:52] tempt you that slows down your spiritual
[1:16:54] progress in other words I'll say like
[1:16:56] this cuz you've seen it too don't let
[1:16:58] anything hinder your church attendance
[1:17:00] don't let anything hinder you're giving
[1:17:03] up tithes and offerings

[1:21:59] this brother Mike he's one of passed
[1:22:00] away this summer so let me tell you just
[1:22:04] a close of this testimony because it
[1:22:06] relates to Sodom and lot now when I
[1:22:12] first come the message I all I knew
[1:22:13] about brother Mike was that he was from
[1:22:15] the Mansfield area and he was single and
[1:22:18] he lived in the house kind of next to
[1:22:21] the church and he was retired he had a
[1:22:22] factory job and he'd retired that's
[1:22:26] about all that I I knew about him but a
[1:22:31] couple years ago they had meetings in
[1:22:34] Lima Ohio and some big name preachers
[1:22:37] were there so my wife and I took the
[1:22:39] family over there and we stayed for the
[1:22:40] whole weekend that's where we met
[1:22:41] brother Kevin and sister Marie and after
[1:22:44] that they came started coming to our
[1:22:45] church because they were looking for a
[1:22:46] home church that's where we met them is
[1:22:48] that that same weekend well that weekend
[1:22:51] I was there and and on the Sunday
[1:22:53] morning service I think brother Mike
[1:22:54] came up to me he said hey if you have
[1:22:55] anybody to fellowship with I sure like
[1:22:58] to talk with you after I'd like to
[1:22:59] invite you over to my house and come
[1:23:00] fellowship I said okay brother I'll do
[1:23:02] that so the service went on and after
[1:23:05] sir after service in fact it was him
[1:23:07] yeah brother Greg come up and said hey
[1:23:09] you want to go out to lunch with me and
[1:23:11] all the preachers brother William it was
[1:23:12] kind of a mind battle because there was
[1:23:15] some of the preachers that I that really
[1:23:17] our famous in a good way because they
[1:23:19] love the Lord and I really want to meet
[1:23:21] these brothers and I had a real mind
[1:23:23] battle like mmm
[1:23:24] I go with the preachers I'd like to meet
[1:23:26] these brothers cuz I've listened to him
[1:23:28] my whole my whole message life and it
[1:23:31] was hard it was hard but I said you know
[1:23:33] what brother Craig I said I can't do
[1:23:34] that brother Mike asked me to go over to
[1:23:37] his house and so I went over to his
[1:23:40] house we just ordered some you know
[1:23:42] chicken or something like that
[1:23:43] so he sat down in his living room and he
[1:23:45] was a you know he was single and right
[1:23:50] you know we just got talking I said
[1:23:51] brother Mike tell me your testimony he
[1:23:54] said well there's not much to tell you
[1:23:55] know he was so humble but he said
[1:23:58] brother Jesse I'm gonna tell you he said
[1:23:59] before the message I was a ranked sinner
[1:24:02] he said I was a homosexual and that's
[1:24:05] why this testimony relates to today
[1:24:06] because remember Lot's wife and the
[1:24:08] sodomite condition of that day he said
[1:24:11] well Jesse I'm ashamed and now he's
[1:24:12] passed on oh that's why I feel I don't I
[1:24:14] don't think he'd mind if I shared it he
[1:24:17] said I was a homosexual and church when
[1:24:20] we went to his uh we went to his funeral
[1:24:23] this summer all of his family members
[1:24:25] that they were standing up and saying
[1:24:27] the things he used to do before he came
[1:24:29] to the message they were saying oh we
[1:24:31] had such a good time going to the Ohio
[1:24:33] State Buckeye games they said oh they're
[1:24:36] crying no oh I just I miss going to the
[1:24:38] cedar point with him I miss going to the
[1:24:42] game here and I miss going to do all
[1:24:43] these worldly things just worldly things
[1:24:45] and then all the saints are they're
[1:24:50] rejoicing like crying because they know
[1:24:52] that he came out of all those things
[1:24:54] amen glory and you know what they
[1:24:57] noticed that's the money was he was a
[1:24:58] homosexual someone walked up to him I
[1:25:00] don't know who was and handed him one of
[1:25:02] those cards that said did you know God
[1:25:03] sent a prophet it was a really tiny car
[1:25:05] he said I didn't know that he wrote a
[1:25:08] physical letter to voice of God and said
[1:25:10] can I have some sermon books because it
[1:25:12] says write us if you want some sermon
[1:25:13] books he started reading the books he
[1:25:15] had no idea where Adam was and he came
[1:25:17] to believe that brother Brandon was a
[1:25:19] prophet of God hey man and so he called
[1:25:22] voice of God and said where's the
[1:25:23] nearest church so he drive two hours
[1:25:26] every Sunday from Mansfield to Lima and
[1:25:29] through the preaching of the word
[1:25:31] he left Sodom and Gomorrha Amen can I
[1:25:34] say like that how do you see he had a
[1:25:37] vindication that this word was right
[1:25:40] amen he saw the word said what it did so
[1:25:44] he left the Sodom by the power of the
[1:25:47] word of God and he lived the rest of his
[1:25:49] life without a wife without anything in
[1:25:52] complete dedication to the Lord Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ and how many testimonies you know
[1:26:01] like that I'll tell you like that he was
[1:26:07] more than a lot because he come out he
[1:26:11] is kind of like this it's kinda like he
[1:26:12] came out of Sodom but then he went to
[1:26:13] join Abraham's camp Amen because he
[1:26:17] lives the last few decades of his life
[1:26:19] in complete obedience to the Lord and I
[1:26:22] got to sit there instead of sitting with
[1:26:24] the preachers and how did I know by the
[1:26:26] way him this would be the last time I
[1:26:27] really got the fellowship with him
[1:26:28] before he passed I got to sit there and
[1:26:32] hear his testimony about the card and
[1:26:33] about how he left all the things of the
[1:26:36] world and he started to being devoted to
[1:26:38] the church at his funeral Church I found
[1:26:42] out that brother Mike was the doorkeeper
[1:26:46] to the house of God Amen he was the one
[1:26:50] sister Beatrice that opened and unlocked
[1:26:52] the door every service and now that
[1:26:56] every Bible study and he was the one
[1:27:00] that closed it the pastor's testified
[1:27:03] and said every time I I want him to just
[1:27:05] go home he said no it's my posted duty
[1:27:06] to do it Amen glory and that reminds of
[1:27:12] the scripture where the David said I'd
[1:27:13] rather be a doorkeeper in the house of
[1:27:16] God than to be a sinner in the tents of
[1:27:18] the wicked hallelujah and that's a
[1:27:21] real-life example right there of a man
[1:27:23] that turned he left turned and left
[1:27:25] Sodom and he never looked back Amen
[1:27:28] he found his joy in the house of the
[1:27:30] Lord amen he served God all the days of
[1:27:33] his life let me say one of the
[1:27:38] best friends his best friend who they
[1:27:40] would go out to eat every night because
[1:27:41] they're both bachelors so they didn't
[1:27:44] have any you know family you know the
[1:27:45] guy they're so waiting for God to send
[1:27:47] him a wife or he testified that they
[1:27:50] went on numerous vacations in order to
[1:27:53] see you know weddings or message message
[1:27:56] conventions he said one time they're
[1:27:59] just walking through the mall and his
[1:28:02] friend said oh that looks like a nice
[1:28:04] suit and he didn't think anything about
[1:28:06] it and brother Mike's like hey let's go
[1:28:08] in there to see how much it cost and he

[1:28:26] spot right like that he was so generous
[1:28:28] with his time and his money brother Mike
[1:28:32] sang song specials often he'd always
[1:28:34] seen the same same songs and he would
[1:28:36] get real loud and shout in the spirit in
[1:28:38] fact he got healed that last that's one
[1:28:40] times I went there I prayed for him and
[1:28:42] he said God touched him that's try I

[1:28:51] morning that God healed him when I
[1:28:52] prayed for thank the Lord amen but he
[1:28:57] would always sing the song special he
[1:28:58] said and when he would leave he'd say I

[1:31:29] now what a soldier the cross praise God
[1:31:31] let's stand to our feet here I just
[1:31:36] thought I
[1:31:36] with that testimony I know I don't think
[1:31:37] I ever told you the full testimony but
[1:31:40] there's a man who left Sodom and he come
[1:31:43] and he saw the revelation of the Son of
[1:31:45] Man ha ha hey man praise God
[1:31:48] and he knew this word is right this word
[1:31:50] was vindicated to him I wonder how many
[1:31:52] miracles he saw praise God
[1:31:54] I know God here in him one time when we
[1:31:58] prayed for him see he had to love the
[1:32:03] things of God more and he loved the
[1:32:04] things of the world hope that was a
[1:32:06] blessing Church I want to close with
[1:32:07] that tonight by the grace of God
[1:32:21] is God thank you lord all right let's
[1:32:27] bow our heads here for word of Prayer

[1:33:30] even know how this would turn out Lord
[1:33:32] but you were gonna use him as a
[1:33:34] testimony of an overcomer and I believe
[1:33:37] Lord my just humble thought I believe
[1:33:39] you'll use him against all this Sodom
[1:33:41] generation as proof that a man can be a
[1:33:44] part of it and leave that and crucify
[1:33:46] the lusts of the flesh and the pride of
[1:33:48] life and the lust of the eyes and be a
[1:33:50] real overcomer by receiving the
[1:33:54] overcomer
[1:33:54] be son a man in his heart the spirit of
[1:33:57] Jesus Christ thank you lord
[1:33:59] just like I believe you use
[1:34:01] mike.mccluskey as a testimony of
[1:34:03] forgiveness being shot by a cop but able
[1:34:06] to go on public TV and forgive him
[1:34:08] through the power of the King James
[1:34:10] Bible and the revelation of repentance
[1:34:12] through the message of the hour thank
[1:34:14] you Lord for these testimonies there be
[1:34:16] no excuses on that day Lord no excuses
[1:34:19] where people couldn't overcome because
[1:34:22] Lord you put it out public testimonies
