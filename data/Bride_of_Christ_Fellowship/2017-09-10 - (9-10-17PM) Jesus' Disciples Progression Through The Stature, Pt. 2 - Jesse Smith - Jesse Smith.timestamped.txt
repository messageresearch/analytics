[10:22] let's tend to read a scripture here then
[10:24] we'll just do the Bob City race before
[10:30] let's go to Acts chapter 1 where the
[10:33] three first five of course he's a red
[10:44] letter words important words here my
[10:46] wife might be trying to hear so use the
[10:49] mic here God let's go the bank god bless
[10:51] you see it god bless you sir that's uh
[10:56] x1 first fine I just want to read this
[11:06] verse I believe it's very important
[11:09] because it shows how even after Jesus
[11:11] died and resurrected he was pointing the
[11:14] disciples to the baptism of the Holy
[11:16] Ghost to power for service so let's look
[11:19] at that here let's look at verse five
[11:21] everybody god that's Rita on three one
[11:24] two three four John truly baptized with
[11:28] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[11:31] Holy Ghost not many days father we
[11:36] gettin thank you for the songs the
[11:38] prayers Lord you know you hear our
[11:39] prayers
[11:40] thank you for hearing our prayers thank
[11:42] you for the song that my brother setting
[11:44] or wouldn't encourage it or whatever
[11:45] what a mighty song or dance for each
[11:47] behind then give us the faith for
[11:50] rapturing power when we know according
[11:52] to your word it's already in a slore
[11:53] toddler were formed again so father
[11:55] leave each and every heart be born again
[11:57] Lord Jesus bring each and every person
[11:59] to a new birth Lord God so the rapture
[12:02] is already inside of them because the
[12:04] seed of God is inside their souls Lord
[12:07] God we thank you your love and mercy
[12:09] bless us now as we teach your word Jesus
[12:11] Christ me every set even may be sees it
[12:17] alright so now I'm going to switch over
[12:19] I'm just going to put that picture but I
[12:21] modified it a little bit
[12:23] by about three works of grace the
[12:28] children did a good job reading last
[12:30] weekend yeah so I just want to put that
[12:33] one up there I kind of simplified a
[12:34] little bit we've been going through
[12:37] Jesus's disciples and how they had to go
[12:40] through sanctification or to be born
[12:42] again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:43] and we're showing examples of
[12:47] sanctification in the Gospels now
[12:50] program said when Peter went up the
[12:51] Pentecost he got on the full armor of
[12:53] God so that's why I place that up there
[12:55] to remember that remember that remember
[12:58] that once Peter God the Holy Ghost now
[13:02] he had the full armor of God on and then
[13:05] program set up you're born again you
[13:06] have the fruits in the spirit I found
[13:07] another quote about that the church age
[13:09] book the Prophet taught that as well
[13:11] the fruits of the spirit come after
[13:13] baptism with the Holy Ghost so so the
[13:16] children can see that because for
[13:18] justification getting baptized
[13:19] sanctification and cleaned out and
[13:22] adding all these strengths into our
[13:24] lives then you get borned again with the
[13:27] love of God and then at that moment you
[13:30] have the armor of God and then in time
[13:32] you start bearing fruits of the spirit
[13:33] and that's also called your adoption or
[13:37] placing I can place you in the body
[13:40] wherever he wants you to be so it's that
[13:43] exact okay towards that simplified a
[13:44] little bit I think last week I had all
[13:46] that all the armor pieces listed up here
[13:48] plus all the fruits of the spirit so
[13:50] that was a lot of room up there I
[13:52] thought I'd simplify that so we went
[13:55] through a lot of examples and even
[13:56] Wednesday we did a lot of examples so
[13:58] I'll just briefly review so Jesus you
[14:06] know on the earth administered for three
[14:09] and a half years his disciples walked
[14:10] with him for three and half years it was
[14:12] God in the flesh but the disciples were
[14:15] never born again that's why he breathed
[14:17] on them after the resurrections they
[14:19] received the Holy Ghost received the
[14:20] Holy Ghost and then last week we looked
[14:25] at faith we look at how Jesus prayed for
[14:28] Peter that his face wouldn't fail and of
[14:31] course all the disciples as well is
[14:33] remember they all beat their chests and
[14:34] said we all die with you right
[14:35] this man-made virtue this man made his
[14:39] testosterone but they never never really
[14:42] had the true virtue of God to stay there
[14:45] till death so we spent time on faith and
[14:49] then we spent time on virtue they also
[14:53] all disciples scatter to Jesus the rest
[14:56] praying they couldn't prayed watch for
[14:58] one hour they never hurt you to watch
[14:59] for one hour it's good even pray one
[15:01] hour then they didn't have to hurt you
[15:04] to cast out the demon out of the child
[15:06] but Jesus said you have to be praying
[15:08] and fasting to fast out I'm sorry to
[15:10] cast out a deaf and dumb spirit
[15:12] so that's virtue and that comes through
[15:14] prayer and fasting and then we saw
[15:17] modern examples like men that can hold
[15:19] offices in the church and then flirt
[15:21] with women or costs or all kinds of evil
[15:24] things and a woman that says she
[15:26] believes the message but that it should
[15:27] wear pants to work or school or
[15:29] something like that don't have the
[15:31] virtue to really live the life out in
[15:33] public
[15:34] alright we skipped over now so we're new
[15:36] knowledge today there's a lot of
[15:38] knowledge examples the disciples that
[15:40] have the knowledge or understanding and
[15:42] then will be patience and godliness on
[15:43] Wednesday night went over all the
[15:45] probably kindest examples right arguing
[15:48] about who's the greatest with your
[15:49] brothers forgiving your brother right
[15:52] brotherly kindness gotta forgive they
[15:55] said crease our faith how can I forgive
[15:57] so-and-so somebody at seven times in one
[15:59] day
[16:01] letting brothers have ministries outside
[16:03] of your ministry that's brotherly
[16:06] kindness the disciples refused children
[16:09] to come to Christ that they were being
[16:10] kind in their sisters right the sister
[16:13] just wanted prayer for their children
[16:14] and they couldn't be kind enough to let
[16:16] the sisters come to Jesus and bring
[16:18] their children to Jesus and then the
[16:21] cycles were filled with sore displeasure
[16:23] would James and John's mother came and
[16:26] said King James and John sit on the
[16:28] right hand and left hand so they really
[16:30] like a lot of brother kindness can every
[16:31] see that they always were upset
[16:33] sometimes they got upset in our Gita who
[16:35] was greater got upset with each other
[16:37] didn't have the love of God like we
[16:39] should have so let's go over a lot of
[16:42] the knowledge examples and then we try
[16:45] to close with where the disciples
[16:49] so let's go up there now all right let's
[16:52] go in the scripture let's go to John
[16:55] chapter 2 verse 18 John 2:18 everybody
[16:59] okay with using the mic again to read
[17:03] you don't have to occasion how do you
[17:09] feel sir you feel like okay reading with
[17:11] the mic or done liddie once it passes
[17:17] over if you feel comfortable you can do
[17:20] that John 2:18 st. John 2:18 the first
[17:25] example which I thought was a pretty
[17:27] powerful example as I went through the
[17:28] scriptures did some reading was the
[17:31] disciples didn't understand Jesus when
[17:33] he said you destroy this temple I'll
[17:36] raise it up in three days I did not
[17:38] understand this I think it's pretty
[17:41] striking to see what is actually said
[17:44] about this alright so Lydia do you want
[17:47] to read 18 verse 20 says then said the
[18:11] Jews forty in six years was this temple
[18:13] one building and wilt thou rear it up in
[18:15] three days verse 21 but he spake of the
[18:19] temple of his body look at this next
[18:23] Scripture this is this is what I thought
[18:24] was so powerful when therefore he was
[18:27] risen from the dead his disciples
[18:29] remembered that he had said this unto
[18:32] them and they believed the scripture and
[18:35] the word which Jesus had said now why is
[18:38] that striking and striking because at
[18:40] Jesus's trial at the high priests house
[18:44] before he was crucified
[18:45] remember they brought in false witnesses
[18:47] against Jesus and what did they say he
[18:49] was guilty of blasphemy by saying he
[18:52] would raise up the temple in three days
[18:54] so isn't it striking that Jesus's own
[18:58] disciples didn't remember even preach
[19:00] this until after the rest
[19:02] but yet his enemies understood this as
[19:05] far as they have been remembered it so
[19:07] his enemies remember it his disciples
[19:10] did not remember it until after the
[19:12] resurrection
[19:13] I imagined Peter was out there he was
[19:15] already lacking virtue and here he
[19:17] clearly lacked knowledge because uh one
[19:19] of those false witnesses would raised up
[19:22] and said oh you're your master said this
[19:25] for that and Peter might have shrugged
[19:26] his shoulders and said I don't remember
[19:27] that
[19:28] I don't you remember because the Bible
[19:30] said he didn't remember - after the
[19:32] resurrection so there's a good example
[19:34] of not having the knowledge like you
[19:37] would expect them to have about the
[19:39] prophecies okay so I thought that was
[19:44] pretty striking to see then okay so
[19:47] let's go the next one let's go to
[19:49] Matthew 16 let's go to Matthew chapter
[19:51] 16 they didn't understand the miracles
[19:54] of the bread and the fishes now we can
[19:59] look back now we can see all I can see
[20:00] the understanding behind these miracles
[20:02] but that's only because you know we're
[20:04] after the fact we're not living in those
[20:06] days
[20:06] remember what we said last year if we
[20:08] would have been alive in those days we
[20:10] would have the same thing Peter did
[20:11] right we would have made the same
[20:12] mistakes because we're all human and we
[20:14] all need a Savior so we're not we're not
[20:17] putting the disciples any lower than
[20:18] ourselves in fact we should always put
[20:20] them way above us right we should humble
[20:22] ourselves but just showing how they
[20:24] needed to grow in God right they needed
[20:27] to be sanctified so Matthew 16 1 there's
[20:30] a lot of reading in here you know just
[20:35] because there's so many I think I'll
[20:37] just talk about a few of these let's go
[20:40] to verse 6 now remember in verses 1 to 5
[20:46] they were sailing across looks like a
[20:49] body of water and they they forgot that
[20:51] take bread along with them then verse 5
[20:53] it says that they'd forgotten to take
[20:54] bread ok now verse 6 and then jesus said
[20:58] to them take heed and beware of the
[21:00] leaven of the Pharisees and of the
[21:02] Sadducees and the reason among
[21:04] themselves saying is because we have
[21:05] taken no breath which when Jesus
[21:09] perceived he said them o ye of little
[21:11] faith why reason ye among yourselves
[21:13] because she had brought
[21:14] no bread do you not yet understand mmm
[21:18] acknowledges understand do not yet
[21:21] understand neither remember the five
[21:23] loaves of the five thousand and how many
[21:26] baskets you took up
[21:27] neither the seven loaves of the four
[21:30] thousand and how many baskets you took
[21:31] up how is it that you do not understand
[21:34] that I speak it not to you concerning
[21:36] bread that ye should beware of the
[21:39] leaven of the pharisees and the
[21:40] sadducees then under then understood
[21:44] they how that he bade them not beware of
[21:47] the leaven of bread but of the doctrine
[21:50] of the Pharisees and the Sadducees all
[21:53] right so see they they didn't understand
[21:56] which bread was most important they
[21:57] thought all he's reminding us we didn't
[21:59] bring the natural bread but what did
[22:01] they find out what bread was more
[22:03] important than that regret me spiritual
[22:05] bread now that might seem so easy to us
[22:07] but we're living after the fact right
[22:10] but to them they thought Jesus was
[22:11] talking about the natural bread but it
[22:14] shows how dangerous false doctrine is
[22:17] doesn't it as Jesus said beware of the
[22:19] leaven or the bread height of the
[22:23] Pharisees and Sadducees but they didn't
[22:25] understand that right brother bang the
[22:26] kitty right now the guy they didn't
[22:28] understand that look they're talking
[22:29] about the false teaching of the
[22:31] Pharisees we think all that so simple
[22:33] but I suppose were on the other side of
[22:35] the atonement right we're on the other
[22:37] side of Pentecost so see they didn't
[22:41] even have an understanding of what
[22:42] leaven bread was it was the false
[22:45] doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees
[22:48] alright that's the second example so two
[22:51] examples of not having enough the
[22:53] understanding of the word okay let's go
[22:56] to Matthew 19 10 and 10 through 12 we'll
[22:59] see they didn't have understanding about
[23:00] marriage and divorce where we'd say just
[23:05] the they didn't have the understanding
[23:10] of the power that would keep a marriage
[23:12] strong so Matthew 19 10ft 1910
[23:36] alright Matthew 19 dead his disciples
[23:40] said to him if the case of the man be so
[23:43] with his wife it is not good to marry
[23:46] now look the disciples are saying wow
[23:48] this is the case there's only one cause
[23:50] for a divorce and remarriage it's good
[23:52] for a man not to marry but didn't God
[23:55] say in Genesis chapter 2 it's not good
[23:59] for man to be alone right so here's the
[24:02] disciples they don't understand yet the
[24:05] power when the Holy Ghost comes it's not
[24:06] gonna be hard for a couple to stay
[24:07] together because they're both gonna be
[24:09] born again they're saying oh it's good
[24:13] for the men not to get married but Jesus
[24:15] says this in verse 11 all men cannot
[24:18] receive this saying save save then they
[24:21] determine is given so Jesus says there's
[24:24] only some people that can receive this
[24:25] the true children of God right is the
[24:28] the make believers non-believers they're
[24:30] going to get divorced remarried divorced
[24:31] remarried it's not given to them it's
[24:33] only given to the believer to see so the
[24:38] disciples didn't even understand wow
[24:39] they don't understand the power of the
[24:42] Holy Ghost that would be in them to keep
[24:44] their marriages strong so Paul right
[24:47] later he said no husbands love your
[24:48] wives as Christ loved the church right
[24:50] and wives submit to your husband's as
[24:53] the church should submit to Christ but
[24:56] their cycles is almost not good for men
[24:59] to marry but see they just lacked the
[25:01] understanding of the Holy Spirit about
[25:03] marriage of the horse and about how
[25:05] powerful God became how much power they
[25:08] would have rather to keep their
[25:09] marriages strong okay let's do another
[25:13] one here
[25:14] mark 7:14 so they're marking 14 mark 7
[25:31] 14 to 23
[25:35] Bible calls this a parable which is
[25:37] interesting this is a parable so I think
[25:43] he's referring to the parable earlier in
[25:44] the chapter about how a man is like a
[25:46] cub and if you might wash the outside it
[25:49] doesn't really do any good you got to
[25:50] clean the inside of the cup right
[25:52] we want our heart sleep BB what the
[25:54] inside of our thoughts and emotions when
[25:57] everything will I end up with the Word
[25:58] of God
[25:58] I think that's what we referred to here
[26:00] now look at verse 14 did you want to
[26:04] read 14 15 and thank you that's where
[26:44] Jesus taught when the Bible calls us a
[26:46] parable so when you compare a human to a
[26:49] cup right or suppli core whatever where
[26:52] Jesus was describing it that's I guess
[26:54] it's a pair of a pair of a pair of
[26:56] arable sorry according to scripture
[26:59] verse 18 they say them them are you so
[27:02] without understanding also do you not
[27:04] perceive that whatsoever thing from
[27:07] without enters into the man it cannot
[27:09] defile him because it enters not into
[27:12] his heart but into the belly and goeth
[27:14] out into the draught perching all meats
[27:16] and he said that which cometh out of the
[27:18] man that defiles the men for from within
[27:21] out of the heart of man proceedeth
[27:24] proceed evil thoughts adulteries
[27:26] fornications murders thefts covetousness
[27:28] wickedness deceit lasciviousness and
[27:31] evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all
[27:34] of these evil things come from within
[27:36] and defile the man so me too much candy
[27:40] bars is that going to defile your
[27:41] spiritual state No
[27:44] that will enter in your body it's gonna
[27:46] hurt your body but that's not gonna
[27:49] cause thatch to come out of your mind
[27:52] out of your heart right it's the evil
[27:55] that's already inside of you that's what
[27:57] it's got to be cleaned out Jesus says
[27:59] nothing can go into a man and really
[28:01] defile him it's what's in the heart that
[28:04] defiles a person and then Jesus said
[28:06] don't you understand he said hearken
[28:08] unto me and understand this the
[28:10] Pharisees were all concerned with
[28:11] washing hands and meats and tithing on
[28:14] every little ounce and every little
[28:16] milliliter everything they are all
[28:18] concerned with these outward things but
[28:19] Jesus said don't you understand it's
[28:22] about the inside it's about the heart
[28:24] how many children what a pure heart
[28:26] before God so let's when we pray we'll
[28:31] said God please approach our hearts
[28:32] clean not hearts of our inside to be
[28:35] pure so that these things don't come out
[28:37] of our mouths right these actions we
[28:39] don't steal we don't lie we don't last
[28:41] feel like we don't commit all these evil
[28:43] acts all right so that's another one
[28:47] they didn't understand they didn't
[28:48] understand that it's the inside
[28:51] it's what's already inside a man that
[28:52] defiles it will give us go to Luke 18
[28:57] verse 31 Luke 18:31
[29:00] here's another thing they didn't
[29:01] understand they didn't understand what
[29:02] Jesus was foretelling his death and Luke
[29:06] 18 31 through 34 in church this is one
[29:12] of the saddest ones in the Bible of
[29:14] course but the person was forgiven but
[29:16] remember when Peter rebuked Jesus
[29:19] himself Peter reviewed Jesus and said
[29:22] surely you're not going to die remember
[29:24] Jesus looked at Peter what did he call
[29:25] it what did he call that spear that Jeep
[29:27] Peter was speaking out remember
[29:29] behind me Satan one of the saddest
[29:33] examples I would say of a person getting
[29:37] the wrong spirit on them but thankful
[29:39] that God forgave Peter this is why it's
[29:43] so important to understand the
[29:45] prophecies understand what God has said
[29:48] to us Luke 18:31
[29:51] 234
[29:58] all right so sorry verse 31 that he took
[30:00] unto him 212 instead of them the old we
[30:03] go up to Jerusalem and all things that
[30:06] are written by the prophets concerning
[30:08] the son of man should have accomplished
[30:09] for he shall be delivered unto the
[30:12] Gentiles and shopping mocked and
[30:13] spiteful he's treated and spit it on and
[30:16] they shall scourge him and put him to
[30:19] death and the third day he shall rise
[30:20] again look at this verse 34 and they
[30:24] understood what how much of this none of
[30:28] these things and this saying was hit
[30:31] from them neither knew they the things
[30:33] which were spoken Jesus told them I'm
[30:35] gonna be offering to rise on the third
[30:37] day he told them this I couldn't be
[30:39] delivered to the Gentiles in romance and
[30:42] I lashed on the third day and they
[30:44] didn't understand because the Bible said
[30:46] it was hid from them
[30:47] and right after this in Luke 16 I'm
[30:51] sorry Matthew 16 Peter rebukes Emmanuel
[30:55] himself Peter rebukes God himself and
[30:59] then God asked Jesus has to say get
[31:01] behind me Satan it wasn't a flesh and
[31:03] blood affair wasn't it was battling the
[31:06] spirits behind them so can all the beat
[31:08] all the children see it's important to
[31:10] understand what Jesus is saying it's
[31:12] important understand those prophecies
[31:13] were to understand and remember what he
[31:16] said okay now some of these was gift as
[31:20] we're getting about halfway done with
[31:22] the time there remember the new birth
[31:26] when Nicodemus said explain to me the
[31:28] new birth again what did Jesus say he
[31:30] said art to a aren't you a master of
[31:31] Israel you don't understand these things
[31:33] he said what do you mean I'm gonna have
[31:35] to enter my mother's womb and be born to
[31:37] get how is that possible in Jesus kind
[31:39] of your beauty princess you don't
[31:41] understand it
[31:42] you're a master in Israel you don't
[31:43] understand any born-again event being
[31:45] born again of those of the soul right he
[31:48] meant that that's another example in
[31:51] Ezekiel he said as equal were told us a
[31:53] new heart a new sphere and my sphere and
[31:56] still this master in Israel didn't
[31:58] understand that we went over this
[32:03] briefly but Jesus is preaching in John
[32:07] chapter 6 he said
[32:08] I am the living bread that came down
[32:09] from heaven the Jews thought he was
[32:12] saying that he must eat their literal
[32:14] flesh and drink his literal blood but we
[32:19] know he was speaking of symbolically
[32:21] right he was speaking of the spiritual
[32:22] word and of course our taking the holy
[32:24] spirit and the disciples didn't
[32:27] understand that at all let's go to Luke
[32:32] 10:17 this is a good one always to
[32:36] remember whenever God does America
[32:37] remember it's okay to rejoice but we
[32:40] should remember there's more important
[32:42] things than miracles salvation is more
[32:45] important than miracles let's go to Luke
[32:49] 10:17 so this shows some of the
[32:58] preachers I believe this is with anis
[33:01] emiti return some of them didn't
[33:03] understand the principle either Luke
[33:07] 10:17 they didn't read 17 you want to
[33:27] read 19 thank you appreciate that thank
[33:57] you
[33:57] Lydia and Sarah verse 20 notwithstanding
[33:59] and this rejoice not so they're
[34:01] rejoicing in Jesus's don't rejoice just
[34:04] because you have power right so if we do
[34:08] a miracle we should you know God allows
[34:11] us to do americorps see miracle who
[34:13] shouldn't get more excited about that
[34:14] and the fact that the person can be
[34:17] saved actually the most important thing
[34:19] this person is living a change life
[34:22] right
[34:22] are saved from their addictions they're
[34:24] saved from their sins right that's mo
[34:27] that's more important we that's um
[34:28] something to rejoice about right like we
[34:31] said last week with Haven being baptized
[34:32] and different ones being baptized if
[34:35] your name is in heaven that's more to
[34:37] rejoice on than just seeing America
[34:39] you're injured in heaven because the
[34:41] next verse Jesus says that verse 21 in
[34:44] that hour Jesus rejoice in spirits that
[34:47] I think the O Father Lord of Heaven
[34:48] earth that house hid these things from
[34:50] the wise and the prudent that's revealed
[34:52] them unto babes even so father we're so
[34:54] it seemed good in thy sight so even
[34:57] preachers needed the right understanding
[34:59] right even I need the right
[35:00] understanding everyone needs the right
[35:02] understanding we should have more
[35:04] rejoicing to see people's soul saved and
[35:07] seeing a real change life than just
[35:10] miracles Jesus had to correct them he
[35:13] said don't rejoice over that be thankful
[35:15] for that but don't rejoice and Joyce
[35:17] said something got state all right so
[35:20] that takes you through some of the
[35:22] examples on under oh sorry knowledge you
[35:25] can see how the disciples lacked a lot
[35:26] of knowledge right yeah and remember we
[35:29] would have been the same way
[35:30] we're not exalting ourselves at all we
[35:32] would did exactly the same thing about
[35:33] Bramson we would have did the same thing
[35:34] like Adam and Eve if we would have been
[35:36] there in the garden of you okay let's
[35:39] look at temperance I'm just going to
[35:41] quickly read one we're not going to read
[35:43] it but in Matthew chapter 4 the example
[35:45] for the Granby or temperance was Jesus
[35:47] when he was hungry he had self-control
[35:50] not to turn the stone into bread
[35:52] so Jesus clearly had temperance course
[35:55] he had already received the Holy Spirit
[35:56] it came down like a dove at his baptism
[35:58] the spirit drove him out in the
[36:00] wilderness so can everybody see that he
[36:02] had temperance he had the self-control
[36:05] even though I'm hungry I'm not gonna try
[36:07] to do a miracle or do something for
[36:08] myself I'll wait until God gives me
[36:11] permission okay let's see that was the
[36:14] example brother name of temperance I
[36:16] couldn't find another one of the
[36:17] disciples with temperance
[36:19] anybody think of one I thought about how
[36:22] they ate corn number they were hungry on
[36:23] the Sabbath and they ate corn but Jesus
[36:25] allowed them to do that and Jesus backed
[36:27] them for doing that so that really was
[36:30] an example of any failure with
[36:32] temperance but they didn't they didn't
[36:34] do it when Jesus said they could do
[36:37] so I couldn't think of any other
[36:39] temperance examples and when I was in
[36:41] reading I didn't find any other examples
[36:43] of temperance
[36:46] Harmy that's do it yeah that that's I'm
[36:49] gonna bring that one later with God they
[36:51] actually have that for godliness oh yeah
[36:52] that could be one two that could be one
[36:55] two and some of these overlap I'm using
[36:57] some of these Oh we'll get to later for
[36:59] godliness some of them overlap that's a
[37:01] good one
[37:02] this isn't really nut higher I was
[37:04] really blessed by this was Matthew 15 22
[37:06] let's go here this is the woman of
[37:07] Canaan and her daughter was possessed
[37:10] with the devil this is a really good
[37:12] example of patience the disciples didn't
[37:14] have enough patience Matthew 15 22 all
[37:34] right Matthew 15 22 also called the
[37:37] syrophoenician woman or the Canaanite
[37:39] woman and behold a woman of Canaan came
[37:42] unto I'm sorry came out of the same
[37:44] coasts and cried at him saying have
[37:46] mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my
[37:48] daughter's grievously vexed with the
[37:49] devil and she I'm sorry he answered her
[37:53] not a word and his disciples came and
[37:54] besought him saying send her away or she
[37:58] cried after us
[38:00] so they're so impatient with her just
[38:03] come up she's seen let me see Jesus let
[38:05] me see your Savior he won't answer he
[38:07] won't even look at her remember because
[38:08] she wasn't son of David to knit to her
[38:11] right and he said he told his disciples
[38:13] go to the lost house of the sheep of
[38:16] Israel right so that's what my mind
[38:18] tells us they're so impatient they say
[38:21] Jesus would you please send her away she
[38:24] keeps crying after us they'd lost their
[38:27] patience send her away we've tried to
[38:30] send her away she won't leave
[38:32] look at verse 24 but he answered and
[38:37] said I am NOT sent but unto the lost
[38:39] sheep of the house of Israel then came
[38:41] she had worshipped him saying lord help
[38:42] me and he answered and said it is not
[38:45] meet to take the children's bread and
[38:46] cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord
[38:49] yeah the dogs heat up
[38:50] crumbs which fall from their master's
[38:52] table then jesus answered and sent her o
[38:54] woman great is thy faith be it unto thee
[38:58] even as thou wilt and her daughter was
[39:00] made whole from that very hour praise
[39:03] God to see how God ant honors great
[39:06] faith this great faith give up on your
[39:08] prayers or does it keep Craig what do
[39:10] you think true it keeps cracking keeps
[39:13] crying out Jesus hear me Jesus into my
[39:16] prayer that's what great faith does and
[39:19] we'll keep praying right for God to
[39:20] answer our prayers as well but do you
[39:24] see how the disciples lack patience they
[39:26] got impatient with the movement send her
[39:27] away
[39:28] send away Jesus she won't listen us you
[39:31] send her away
[39:35] and again the disciples were going to
[39:40] send another group away in Matthew 14
[39:42] let's go to Matthew 14 the previous
[39:44] chapter they were going to send away the
[39:47] multitude so again showing the lack of
[39:52] patience Navy lack of compassion the
[39:56] disciples are trying to send them away
[39:57] but Jesus went to help them so Jesus
[40:01] actually looked at this multitude in
[40:03] Matthew 14 13 and the Bible said he had
[40:06] great compassion upon them if you look
[40:09] at Matthew 14:14 he looks at the
[40:12] multitude and had compassion upon them
[40:16] okay look at verse 15 when it was
[40:19] evening his disciples came to him saying
[40:20] this is a desert place and the time is
[40:22] now past send them all to do the way but
[40:24] they both may go into the villages and
[40:26] buy themselves victuals so again the
[40:29] disciples are sending them away we can't
[40:31] help them master send them away and the
[40:33] next chapter they tried to send no
[40:35] Canaanite woman away but then but they
[40:38] didn't know that Jesus would had
[40:39] compassion upon them okay so then Jesus
[40:43] instead tells him to stay and he
[40:45] performs the miracle of multiplying the
[40:47] loaves of the fish grace God there's
[40:50] another good example the cycles want to
[40:52] send away but Jesus says no I have
[40:54] compassion upon this people I'm going to
[40:56] feed them all right so let's do I got
[41:02] two more to go and then we'll try
[41:04] get to our closing scriptures here again
[41:07] this show this so now let's go to
[41:09] godliness I'll never remember brother
[41:11] Branham said about godliness he says be
[41:13] being godly is being like God and loving
[41:16] those who don't love you and then
[41:19] program gave the scripture where Jesus
[41:20] said the heavenly father sends rain upon
[41:24] the just and the unjust so we want to
[41:27] look at some scriptures and this is what
[41:28] we're sister Wendy that caught that one
[41:30] two about Peter cutting off his enemies
[41:32] a year instead of loving his enemy what
[41:35] he tried to do yeah so three that one
[41:40] first is sort of John 18 John 18 10 is
[41:45] the actual description so I thought this
[41:59] was a good example it could be patience
[42:00] as well I think I think a lot of these
[42:02] more together temperance even of
[42:04] self-control but clearly we can see by
[42:09] what brother Graham said about godliness
[42:10] he's not being kind to his enemy
[42:13] these are enemies they're coming to take
[42:15] his Lord the one he said a few hours ago
[42:18] I'll die with you
[42:20] so John 1810 okay every day then Simon
[42:31] Peter having a sword drew it and smoked
[42:33] the high priests servant and cut off his
[42:36] right hear the servants name was Malchus
[42:39] then said Jesus are the Peter put up thy
[42:42] sword into that the sheath the cup which
[42:45] my father hath given me shall I not
[42:48] drink it remember another portion said
[42:50] they who take the sword will die with
[42:52] the sword so should we take a natural
[42:55] sword try the Me's
[42:56] if someone says oh you're you shouldn't
[42:58] dress like that and that goes godly
[43:00] clothes and those those skirts all those
[43:02] are old-fashioned so we want to get that
[43:03] back and hurt them back or should we
[43:05] want to pray for them to pray for this
[43:08] you don't want to fight them back they
[43:11] might try to fight us it's not really
[43:13] that it's a spear behind it we have to
[43:15] be godly and love those who don't love
[43:17] us
[43:19] that's one good example and here's the
[43:22] last one I have for godliness I can find
[43:24] luke 9:51 luke 9:51 this is a story
[43:42] where one of Jesus disciples wanted to
[43:45] call fire down from heaven just because
[43:48] they rejected Jesus so these are people
[43:51] that have rejected Jesus seemingly there
[43:53] were enemies to Christ and Jesus has to
[43:56] correct correct him and this is the
[43:58] disciple of love as well he became later
[44:01] the disciple of love Saint John the
[44:03] Divine so see before the Holy Ghost he
[44:06] was a he was a I would call them sons of
[44:09] thunder right judgment judgment oh man
[44:12] any any enemy let's just make God judge
[44:15] them send fire on them but after the
[44:17] Holy Ghost look how the capstone of love
[44:21] came down upon his heart and now he's
[44:23] praying for his enemies right afterwards
[44:26] and then you memory read this morning he
[44:28] said if you don't love your brother
[44:29] you're a liar you don't love God see so
[44:34] we have to love our enemies if God
[44:36] changed his heart they got I can change
[44:38] any of our hearts to because you really
[44:40] want to see these people destroyed by
[44:41] fire what does he fire come down upon a
[44:44] city burn up people
[44:46] does that sound nice does that sound
[44:48] kind like a fruit of the Spirit no no
[44:51] does it but jesus corrected it he Jesus
[44:55] is here he crept us as well luke 9:51
[45:00] okay so Lydia Sarah maybe we can read a
[45:02] couple more then you read 51 52 53
[45:23] please
[45:33] they're good thank you
[45:35] I mean that Jesus was so focused on his
[45:38] crucifixion that that's all I could
[45:41] think about and the Bible said they
[45:43] didn't receive him because he had such
[45:44] focus on the cross isn't that striking
[45:48] goodness look at verse 54 and when his
[45:53] disciples James and John saw they said
[45:55] Lord will not forgive them and something
[45:59] they said will you forgive them now they
[46:02] said Lord wilt now that we command fire
[46:05] to come down from heaven and consume
[46:07] them even as Elias did they wanted fire
[46:10] to come down all because they rejected
[46:13] Christ is that what Jesus wanted the
[46:15] Jesus want fire to come down upon every
[46:17] person I rejected him no their
[46:19] scriptures I've talked before where God
[46:21] doesn't delight when sinners die it's
[46:24] sad if a burden is it he doesn't want to
[46:26] see people go to hell and brother
[46:28] Branham said if you want to see how to
[46:29] go to hell we need to go back to that
[46:31] doctor repent and get saved we don't
[46:35] want to see anybody lost
[46:36] look at verse 55 but he turned and
[46:40] rebuked him so clearly Jesus is
[46:43] upsetting you change these sons of
[46:45] thunder these dozens of the sons of
[46:48] great emotion right and zeal wow he
[46:53] rebukes him even though he was focused
[46:54] on Calvary he hurts the he hears these
[46:56] words that were not very godly they're
[46:59] not very patient were they he turns
[47:01] around he rebukes them and he says you
[47:03] know not what men our spirit Europe so
[47:07] in other words he says you got the wrong
[47:08] spear don't that's the spirit of the
[47:11] devil right I said you got the wrong
[47:14] spirit that's not God's Spirit for this
[47:16] this particular Thailand season the
[47:18] diverse 56 let's read together children
[47:21] ready one two three more the Son of Man
[47:23] has not come to destroy men's lives but
[47:27] to save them
[47:29] they went to another village so can you
[47:33] see how the disciples didn't have
[47:34] brother godliness yet they weren't quite
[47:37] like God yet they did a lot of good
[47:39] things that miracles if they're very
[47:41] very godly disciples but they had
[47:44] certain character traits that were
[47:45] lacking and it crew that's why Jesus
[47:48] breathed on them and said receive the
[47:49] Holy Ghost
[47:50] put your hand on something and look at
[47:52] them real serious and say receive the
[47:54] Holy Ghost receive as a very serious
[47:59] look yeah that's what Jesus did he
[48:01] looked at them real serious receive
[48:05] because we can't have these types of
[48:08] attitudes we can't want judgment to fall
[48:10] on people that reject us we want God to
[48:13] have mercy on people that won't come to
[48:15] our church we want to ever have mercy on
[48:18] people that call us old-fashioned or oh
[48:20] you're in a cult we won't have mercy on
[48:24] people that say that that judgment mercy
[48:29] those scripture is pretty helpful
[48:31] can you see now so now we've gone
[48:33] through faith virtue now I'll enter you
[48:35] there's a lot of examples that now is
[48:36] went through temperance with Jesus
[48:38] patience of the woman and the sight
[48:40] bowls you know who cycles need have more
[48:42] patience with the woman of Canaan
[48:43] godliness and Wednesday went through
[48:45] brotherly kindness they didn't treat
[48:47] each other right all the time
[48:49] didn't they argued amongst themselves so
[48:53] now let's go through I just want to go
[48:57] through the end of the disciples and
[48:59] this just was such an encouragement to
[49:01] me we preached on this recently but I
[49:03] just want to show it again let's go to
[49:04] Matthew 19:27 and remember I'm not we're
[49:10] not trying to look down upon the
[49:12] disciples at all but we just want to see
[49:15] how they were lacking these things that
[49:17] Peter taught later it's clear they were
[49:19] lacking some of these things just like
[49:21] we can look at our lives and sit home
[49:22] sometimes it's clear that I'm not being
[49:24] kind of my brothers and sisters
[49:27] sometimes as clear I'm not being nice to
[49:29] those people who reject our teaching
[49:32] Matthew 19:27 alright Lydia in deciding
[49:41] game by the way to pass that back to
[49:44] Malachi all right are you gonna read 27
[49:49] and 28 necessary to read 29
[49:53] we will be a forsaken on how these which
[49:58] Jesus said unto them verily I say to you
[50:00] that wish that he which have followed me
[50:04] in their regeneration when the Son of
[50:06] man shall sit in the throne of his glory
[50:08] he also Thank You Sara
[50:33] thank you great job wonderful appreciate
[50:36] your home in verse 30 but many that our
[50:39] first should be last and the last shall
[50:41] be first did everybody see what Jesus
[50:44] was going to reward them with they were
[50:46] clearly not perfect they lacked a lot of
[50:48] strength during Jesus earthly ministry
[50:52] but Jesus knew that they would have then
[50:54] should be born again and so who can tell
[50:57] me what were they going to sit on
[50:58] different see that description or
[51:00] they're gonna sit up twelve Thrones and
[51:03] that these Thrones kind of mind you of
[51:06] Narnia make how they go instead of
[51:08] growth after they overcome right they
[51:11] sit in the throne of his glory and then
[51:13] they can judge I think the children can
[51:17] all see that then we're lacking a lot of
[51:19] these but by these virtues but once they
[51:21] got the Holy Ghost and went through some
[51:23] Lord trials and put on the armor of God
[51:25] neither through the spirit then once
[51:27] they died and crossover they'd be they'd
[51:30] have the character to judge other people
[51:32] right in a character to rule but they
[51:35] had to be willing to go to the Pentecost
[51:37] the Holy Ghost and then really fight for
[51:39] God with the armor of the armor of the
[51:42] Lord
[51:42] okay so again I I just want you to know
[51:46] if I would place myself amongst the
[51:48] disciples idea the very bottom the
[51:50] cycles be way up here and we want to put
[51:53] ourselves where we're the least of the
[51:55] least right where the were the lowest of
[51:56] the low
[51:57] you want to humble ourselves and we're
[52:01] looking at a lot of their mistakes but I
[52:03] want you to know these were some of the
[52:04] finest godliest men because geez
[52:07] just promise then you will judge the 12
[52:09] tribes of Israel most these men have to
[52:12] all them except Saint John died for
[52:15] Christ as martyrs so these were mighty
[52:17] men of God once they got the baptism the
[52:19] Holy Ghost God really used them in some
[52:22] tremendous ways never understand that
[52:24] these are some really wonderful servants
[52:27] of the Lord they just had to go through
[52:29] sanctification and get barred again
[52:32] are you are you children we're ready to
[52:33] go through sanctification be sanctified
[52:35] and serve God yeah
[52:38] if you do and you get filled with the
[52:39] Holy Ghost she has a throne for you I
[52:41] that's even better than our you know
[52:44] like we've been talking for Eve
[52:45] everything about Dean because it's real
[52:48] God has a throne because jesus promised
[52:51] us and never see if we overcome we
[52:53] sitting with him on it that's the
[52:56] promise for our day RH to sell the
[52:59] throne this is beautiful I'll buy this
[53:01] you want to cry here look 22:28 look at
[53:04] this Hawkins praise the Lord
[53:08] the 2229 it makes you want to cry
[53:14] because we've tried to continue with the
[53:17] word and all the trials that come along
[53:21] with it Luke 22:28 this is a parallel
[53:33] passage look at this it says ye are they
[53:37] which have continued with me in my look
[53:44] at this verse 29 and I have point unto
[53:46] you a kingdom as my father at 4.30
[53:49] that's the baptism the Holy Ghost
[53:51] program so that's the kingdom of God
[53:53] that he may eat and drink at my table in
[53:56] my kingdom so now I was talking about
[53:58] the son of David Kingdom and sit on
[54:01] Thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[54:03] Israel I hope I can explain this right
[54:07] to it this is why this makes me want to
[54:09] cry Jesus is going to reward them just
[54:13] for staying with him for the three and a
[54:15] half years of ministry and yet he knows
[54:18] they're gonna scatter and run away
[54:20] like she like scared sheep at his arrest
[54:23] right he knows that but he say because
[54:26] you hung with me and stay with me this
[54:28] whole three and a half years even though
[54:29] others have verse akin me I've been
[54:31] rejected because you stay with me this
[54:33] three and a half years he said I'm gonna
[54:36] point you Thrones to sit on and he knew
[54:38] they were gonna fall short
[54:40] that's what maybe that's what's so
[54:41] beautiful for us because even though we
[54:45] lack understanding or we might not
[54:46] understand everything about the rapture
[54:48] or things to come what can we do can we
[54:51] still continue with the Lord throughout
[54:52] through these temptations in truck
[54:54] absolutely we'll just stay with the word
[54:56] of the hour like brother Lawrence is
[54:59] thinking about we'll just stay with us
[55:01] saith the Lord
[55:02] we'll stay with the word of God we might
[55:04] not understand everything and there's a
[55:07] throne for us to sit on don't bring it
[55:09] don't bring us to it just like he
[55:12] brought the disciples now think about
[55:15] this after Jesus raised from the dead
[55:17] did the disciples go looking for him or
[55:20] did Jesus come looking for the disciples
[55:24] so even if we make mistakes they'll come
[55:27] looking for us so Jesus would reward
[55:32] them for staying with him through his
[55:34] previous temptations he knew they would
[55:37] forsake him at the arrest and the and
[55:39] the cross except John's I was there and
[55:41] women were there those godly sisters but
[55:45] he would seek them out later like a
[55:47] shepherd and bring them back and love
[55:49] that jesus said if he loved me feed my
[55:52] sheep just preach to them preach God's
[55:54] Word feed that machine food right that
[55:57] proves you really love the book amen
[56:00] let's see let's look where the Bible
[56:03] said they actually sat on those Thrones
[56:04] that you know it's in the Bible
[56:06] revelation 4 let's go revelation 4 verse
[56:09] 4
[56:15] Jesus said you're gonna sit on twelve
[56:17] Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel
[56:19] well revelation gives us a picture of
[56:21] them sitting with the other twelve sons
[56:25] of Jacob revelation 4 4 can Jesus tell a
[56:30] lie children no he said you'll sit on
[56:34] these thrones because you continue with
[56:36] me these three and a half years through
[56:37] all these campaigns the up and down of
[56:41] his ministry remember in 2nd year was a
[56:42] year of popularity but in the third year
[56:44] as the year of his rejection
[56:46] that's what Thompson cheating's
[56:47] concordance says his initial
[56:49] introductory year of first year second
[56:51] year as popularity third year he lost
[56:53] all his popularity because of his
[56:55] preaching he was rejected but he said
[56:58] because you stayed with me these three
[57:00] and half years you will sit on the
[57:02] twelfth rows all right revelation 4 4
[57:05] how about we all read that together ok
[57:08] let me get there I hear everybody's
[57:11] voice on three one two three and round
[57:14] about the throne were four and 20 seats
[57:17] and upon the seats I saw four and 20
[57:21] elders sitting clothed and white raiment
[57:23] and they had on their heads crowns of
[57:27] gold that beautiful jesus promised he
[57:30] said because you stay with me because
[57:33] you haven't left the word even though
[57:35] I've seen all your faults with the
[57:36] status for men I've seen all your faults
[57:38] you're going to get barred again and
[57:40] then you're gonna have a throne you're
[57:42] gonna go through the armor of God you're
[57:44] gonna go through adoption placing your
[57:46] the manifest the fruit of the Spirit
[57:47] you're gonna die as martyrs but you're
[57:50] going to have the throne that I promised
[57:51] you praise the Lord
[57:54] okay and let's go one more scripture
[57:58] revelation 14 5 I preached this one
[58:00] let's preach on the throne of God this
[58:02] is my closing scripts you want to preach
[58:04] on the on the table
[58:15] revelation 14 five this is a hundred
[58:29] forty-four thousand Jews and in verse 1
[58:32] the Bible said they get the Holy Ghost
[58:33] but it's called
[58:34] the father's name written in their
[58:37] forehead but we know that symbol written
[58:39] your forehead means your sealed with the
[58:41] Holy Spirit he's God so before the
[58:44] throne of God is there any sin against
[58:46] them know when you're born again God is
[58:50] living inside of you and you have no
[58:52] false before the throne of God that's
[58:55] how important that charity is up there
[58:57] can everybody say capstone ready - stone
[58:59] that's how important that cash so it is
[59:01] he caps your life and ultimately caps
[59:04] your destiny you have a that your
[59:08] destiny that before the throne of God
[59:10] you have a throne - and jesus promised
[59:15] in the church ages and you will judge
[59:17] nations remember that was an authority
[59:19] in church age will judge a nation that
[59:21] you can be born again if you can love
[59:23] God with all your heart soul mind and
[59:24] strength that would let you judge
[59:27] nations remember what the Bible said
[59:29] there is no more what search with the
[59:32] sea there's no more crying okay it
[59:35] starts with them there's no more kind of
[59:39] nation to them that are Christ Jesus
[59:41] right so this scripture says those who
[59:44] are born again there's no fault before
[59:45] the throne of God Paul said there's no
[59:47] condemnation that are in Christ Jesus
[59:49] and no one can lay any what - God's
[59:52] elect any charge good Lydia there is no
[59:58] charge to God's own that no one can
[1:00:01] accuse you of anything when you're born
[1:00:03] again because Jesus has totally forgiven
[1:00:06] you
[1:00:07] how does that make you feel that make
[1:00:09] you want to be born again basically I
[1:00:12] just make my calling election sure I
[1:00:14] believe I'm born again but it makes you
[1:00:16] live even closer to the Lord so there's
[1:00:19] no condemnation chorus right if I've
[1:00:22] said no kind of nation that I said no
[1:00:24] one can lay any charge
[1:00:26] before the throne of God your without
[1:00:28] fault before the throne of complication
[1:00:30] has no charges no one can say you're
[1:00:33] guilty this you'll do that like that
[1:00:34] song one drop of blood that's a reality
[1:00:36] there's no charges because the Bible
[1:00:39] said God nailed them to Jesus's cross
[1:00:42] the handwriting that was against you it
[1:00:44] was nailed to Jesus's cross and you
[1:00:47] don't have to pay for any charges
[1:00:48] anymore
[1:00:49] praise God well that concludes that I
[1:00:51] think I'll stop right there that's about
[1:00:52] an hour any questions on how Jesus's
[1:00:56] disciples had to go through
[1:00:57] sanctification any questions or any
[1:01:00] examples you thought that might be
[1:01:01] helpful if we go through this the future
[1:01:05] in other examples of faith virtue
[1:01:07] knowledge temperance and patience and
[1:01:11] godliness and brotherly content examples
[1:01:13] okay
[1:01:14] just something I told my families but I
[1:01:16] have a desire to preach the whole
[1:01:18] ministry of Jesus that's been a long
[1:01:20] series that I want to preach Matthew
[1:01:23] Mark Luke and John
[1:01:24] I just had that design and I think as we
[1:01:26] go through there we'll pull out some of
[1:01:28] these revelations the reason is because
[1:01:30] brother Branham said the ministry the
[1:01:33] bride must match Jesus's ministry before
[1:01:35] he comes back the capstone must match
[1:01:38] and must fit perfectly on top of the
[1:01:41] pyramid that's why I felt such a burden
[1:01:44] for last couple of years I want to
[1:01:46] preach Jesus his whole ministry and so I
[1:01:48] found my Bible brother bang Thompson
[1:01:50] Chaney and corns lays out all four
[1:01:53] Gospels in chronological order it's
[1:01:57] beautiful and I think it has like 400
[1:01:59] events so it gives me a real good start
[1:02:01] to preach Jesus's ministry I'm hoping to
[1:02:03] do that at some point in the next maybe
[1:02:06] few months or year once I finish the
[1:02:08] church ages I want to get to know
[1:02:10] Jesus's ministry so much that our
[1:02:12] ministry looks like Jesus praise God
[1:02:15] because it has to match and that
[1:02:16] capstone comes out of the rapture Jesus
[1:02:19] comes out at the rapture teen girls can
[1:02:21] you bring the capstone down the boy like
[1:02:23] this bring it down and then set it on
[1:02:25] the top Grady when it comes down the
[1:02:28] ministry of the bride must match jesus's
[1:02:30] ministry perfectly that's why that's
[1:02:33] such an important topic for me
[1:02:36] Thompson Jane got me started there's
[1:02:37] really
[1:02:39] okay well that's our heads and what do
[1:02:42] we say we pray forward or we can pray to
[1:02:44] God we'll what do we say there's
[1:02:50] something particular eyes let's just
[1:02:56] pray that think about those virtues
[1:02:59] again and see which one I want to pray
[1:03:00] for again is there a new one this week
[1:03:02] might want to pray for that you pray for
[1:03:07] the sanctification our lives
[1:03:11] Kember the exact words but yeah the
[1:03:13] continual sanctification something along
[1:03:15] those lines yeah that we'd be sanctified
[1:03:17] yeah right honey well how many want to
[1:03:19] be sent if I didn't live a sanctified
[1:03:21] that means cleaned out all the bad
[1:03:24] things out don't when you take a drink
[1:03:25] of water from a cup don't you want that
[1:03:27] cup nice and clean it's Biggins ban dad
[1:03:30] you are nice and clean so God won't see
[1:03:32] our hearts cleaned out okay so that's
[1:03:34] ours the word of Prayer Emily father
[1:03:38] Lord we come to the close of the day
[1:03:40] father this is such a touching the
[1:03:44] subject to me for some reason and just
[1:03:45] meant so much to me so the closely other
[1:03:48] disciples lives Norman I'm just humbled
[1:03:52] to see how much they failed but of
[1:03:55] course they had so much victory as well
[1:03:57] during this three and a half years no
[1:04:00] doubt about that but I'm humbled to see
[1:04:02] despite their failures how highly you
[1:04:06] exalted them dear God because you said
[1:04:10] if we humble ourselves
[1:04:11] you'll exalt us in due season and then
[1:04:14] Lord we can open up the book of
[1:04:15] Revelation and see how you never told a
[1:04:20] lie everything you said will come to
[1:04:24] pass you promised them Thrones that
[1:04:27] there we see them sitting on these
[1:04:28] throne in the regeneration you rewarded
[1:04:35] them for the three-and-a-half years of
[1:04:37] labor although they didn't understand a
[1:04:40] lot even though they forgot a lot of the
[1:04:42] prophecies you reward them for
[1:04:45] continuing with you in your temptations
[1:04:48] Lord how highly you'll reward us Lord
[1:04:51] God for continuing with the message
[1:04:54] despite our temptations despite the
[1:04:57] accusations against the message of the
[1:04:59] our Lord God how highly will you will
[1:05:02] reward us as long as we continue with
[1:05:05] Lord I believe you said awesome
[1:05:07] revelation 3:10 because you continued
[1:05:10] with the word despite the temptation
[1:05:13] I'll keep you from the hour of the
[1:05:15] temptation because you have patience and
[1:05:18] kept the word of my patience yes there
[1:05:20] it is
[1:05:20] I'll keep you from the hour temptation
[1:05:23] will come upon the interval Lord what if

[1:05:30] promise today or as I told these
[1:05:33] children Lord your your word is true you

[1:05:45] as you set down with your father and his
[1:05:50] we don't take these promises like a big
