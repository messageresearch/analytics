uh to come he's got a few song specials to play but that's okay just play it for a little bit here until he's ready and uh you'll enjoy the music and of course the word of God last time he was here it was such a discernment of the Holy Spirit I think I told you about it with some of the situations that happened a few months ago but it was just it seemed so strange but the whole time he's preaching I'm like this is exactly what's going on in the church you know and I was just rejoicing and trying not to you know just trying just trying to rejoice in myself you know just to God speaking to us you know not to like oh God preached them you know God preach other people you know but thank you Lord for vindicating your truth you know and it was such a tremendous discernment and so we're just trusting for the Holy Spirit to minister to every need now we know there's many need healing today so at the end of this message if you feel the the at the climax brother bear said the the prayer at the end is the climax where the holy spirit is is going to see are we going to be able to receive the word of God for uh for healing or salvation or whatever you have need of at that moment you feel

blood of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good it's like to say um what a privilege it is to be back here with you Saints here in Akron I just appreciate the opportunity to get to come back and appreciate brother Jesse and just enjoying the good singing this morning and good music I was happy to hear that brother was playing the piano I had made my mind up there wasn't going to be nobody here on music this morning I was going to come out and I was going to help play so I said well I'm thinking about helping you and he said he's going to do the I said praise God I was so happy to hear that I I just I love to see young people get in there and doing things for the Lord that that blesses me and uh you know they talk about oh you members so and so on how so-and-so used to doing years ago such and such and I said yeah that's true but one time they were young people learning how to do it too what we need is just another crop of young people coming on and learning how to do all the things everyone said amen and I appreciated seeing that I appreciate hearing that and of course I always like to play and sing and he said I like it I really like it and I told him I said well I said God would give a man the desires of his heart I'd never preach another lick I'd play and sing the rest of my life that's all I'd ever do I enjoy it I I like music and I I feel a little naked as they say this morning my wing girl ain't here with me this morning and uh as most of you know she started teaching seventh grade social studies and so she was called away she had things that she had to attend to school-wise and I I hate it when she don't get to travel with us and I I just miss her when I not around but I've got my middle daughter with me annalize and I'm going to have her sing in just a little bit I'm gonna have her come sing a song and she's quite a singer and you heard the one she wrote and and the Lord's blessing her talents and I'm thankful for that and uh my oldest daughter Elizabeth I want to thank you for praying for her I mean she has had some way to go just to give you a little spot just quickly before we go over here and sing a little bit they um doctors told us a.m that the check her because she's having pancreatitis they have a certain enzyme that releases from your pancreas called lipase and so they check the lipase level to see you know kind of where it's at and it's saying an average person normal healthy person's between 0 and 160. when Elizabeth went into the hospital the other night she was 27 500 and some odd numbers and the doctors were scratching their head trying to figure out why on her organs shutting down why isn't her body quitting all together and I just said well it was the hand of the Lord that was what kept her going and God was with the child and so we took her in and uh I had to preach in Canada a couple weekends ago and so I had to leave Saturday morning to head to a place called Wyoming Canada which is over by Port Huron and uh I just walked to the platform at night and I asked the Saints if they would pray and I said I feel like in my heart that this is like you hear Brothers say he hide from the doctor but he can't hide from God I just feel like that this thing is hiding somehow with the first episode of pancreatitis uh you know they couldn't find they'd done eight or ten or 12 tests or what it was and they couldn't find anything well on Sunday before I even got out of the pulpit the doctor had done come in and done said to Samantha well it was hiding on us but we found what was going on he said I and I when he said them words just that way I said well praise the Lord that's exactly what we was thinking on and so your gallbladder which that's one of the first things that they do whenever you start passing a stone like she was passing them uh it was basically like Plumbing it was clogging up her whole system causing everything to back up which is extremely dangerous in the human body in your sink it just cost you a couple hundred dollars to get it fixed but it can kill you otherwise on a human being you know and a gallstone isn't like a kidney stone you can pass those but a gallstone they get stuck in your system and it can just it can just kill you all together so we said well you know I don't like the idea of her being just now in October 12 years old or having to go and have surgery like that but I like the idea of her being alive a whole lot better than having to go on that surgery and so I told him I said well if that's what you're you I said he said I'm 100 sure this is the way so we took her in and they got her ready and I did the surgery took them a couple hours to do the surgery they deliver biopsy while they was in there to check and see if there was anything additional going on and um as we know the uh doc doctor said that everything that he the best he could tell and this was Wednesday we had the final report that we had three appointments right in a row we had to go start from the morning just go all the way through the afternoon and every one of them that we sat down and talked to they just said normal normal normal perfect perfect normal normal every test came out just just exactly right we appreciate your prayers for our daughter and I I tell you that's a you parents know that's a scary thing whenever you come up on things like that and that it just you just don't know how to feel about it sometimes it's a an Emergency thing and I put it on Facebook and I know some people might think well here he is the preacher and he ought to be able to pray through and get a hold of God all by himself but I learned a lesson many years ago when I listen to them tapes and I'd hear the prophet of God talking about demons crying for help whenever they get in trouble and Jesus is about to expose them he said these demons are crying for help they helped me get them to disbelieve and so forth I learned that if Devil's had enough sense to call for help when they're in trouble a saint of God ought to have as much sense to be able to call for help amen so I I like looking out on the on Facebook I was looking at it and there were some two three hundred people from all over the world all over the country praying for our daughter and I said well thank you Lord for that I I tell you it's nice to have people you can depend on like Adam I want to thank the Smith family for their love for us and I I called that a boy yesterday on accident a friend of mine just had a boy and I was just a buddy a buddy how you doing buddy and girl I think it was Carousel one of them said it's a girl I said oh my oh my and I knew that too but I don't know how I did it but I was happy to see the new edition I I like that amen I'm praying everyone I'm become missionaries piano players violent players trumpet players everyone puts in them and just you know just increase their gifts and you got a whole Orchestra right here they actually got a baseball team or a basketball team right there don't you know Jesse something like that amen and I I just just thankful to the Lord and so we love you God bless you and I just wanted to talk to you just a minute and just tell you what's going on of course you know my daddy passed and I appreciate your prayers over that and uh there's a whole lot of things I could tell you on that but I just it was God's time it was God's Will and we um I will tell you this a little part I I did have an experience when I was in the motel room it was August 26 that passed and on the 25th or 24th something like that I was praying and uh brother Jesse I don't like to say this about myself but I just believe it's God things God God stuff you know not me but the the word and and I I was just talking to the Lord and it seemed like the Holy Spirit come to me and said you know you've got the power to speak him out of that bed don't you and I thought yeah Lord according to what you said here in this Bible I do I do I've got that power if a holy ghost filled Christians then I can come again you know you could just speak and to be over with don't you and I thought yeah that's true and then it seemed to come back to me like this but what's the motive what's objective you got dementia you got Alzheimer's you got rheumatoid arthritis he got glaucoma diabetes you know he shuffled when he walked he half the time he just sit in the chair and raise his head and say is this living is this life is this what living's all about so I thought well the motive and the objective would be just a selfish thing just because I'd like to let you around a little bit longer but really I thought every look like every road somehow would just lead to his exit so I just commit Lord I was on my way down to um Dayton down there where they had him and um they called us and they said no no it ain't severe you know might be able to pull out of this so I waited around a little while and uh the evening that I was supposed to be traveling that day in the evening they called us back my brother did who works at Children's Hospital which is about 10 minutes down from Miami Valley where they had him and he said um Benjamin he said ain't too good he said Dad's throwing a clot into his right foot and they're gonna have to amputate his leg all the way up to the top nearly and said if they do that he won't survive the surgery and so on and so forth like that I said I I don't know he said well you probably should get here if you're going to try to get here I said well let's see see what we can work out but I've been looking at plane tickets and I knew that it was way too it was 12 13 14 15 just try to get on the flight get overseeing and I had to preach in Minnesota on uh Thursday morning I had to be in a meeting a whole convention that whole week and I was preaching Michael Tidwell up there and we had a whole string of meetings and uh I thought well I these are advertised meetings people are traveling and I can't just bow out you know I need to try to fulfill my meeting and I knew that's what Dad would want anyways I know he'd want me to go preach instead of sitting around the hospital balling just calling and carrying on and I thought well Lord I don't know what to do and it seemed like the holy spirit said to me look at him again so I I went back to the computer and I pulled up the tickets again I use a little thing called kayak and it pulls up several different ones at a time and you can kind of compare and see which one might be the better flight and I looked at it and where it was thirteen hundred dollars before it was 735 dollars and I thought well that's still quite a bit and then I remember brother Jesse earlier in the year I had given up my seat on the way to Arizona and I was going to uh um yeah I was on the way to a meeting in Arizona about real early morning flight five some in the morning when I got to this place uh I started or summer like I forget where they stationed us and I give up my flight because I thought well I got plenty of time to get there I don't have to preach to the next day so this would be nice I can use the money for something later in preaching probably and so they give me an 800 voucher believe it or not I've done that two different times I've done that two different times in the day the first voucher I needed it to get to Trinidad for Easter and that was the voucher that got me there for Easter well I'd stuck this other one in my little cabinet at home and I I hadn't thought much about it I was sitting there and I remembered they had give me that other 800 voucher sitting right over there in that cabinet I pulled it out it was the same airline when it wasn't that Airline before it was the same airline with this voucher so I was able to go and see my daddy my desire was I wanted to lay my hands on him committing to God and I did that I was thankful I had a chance to do that and then of course the Lord took him Sunday morning later that week and so I was I wasn't going to tell you all this but I'm here now anyways might as well stay with it but so I was kind of feeling upset a little bit about having to leave him and go preach so Saturday night I come out of a service I think I got done preaching Saturday I think it was and uh I got done with the service and I believe if I remember correctly it was I kind of walked out the side door like this and I think if I remember at the sister and her husband was standing over toward the door light and she had this piece of paper in her hand like this and I said what's that woman got she's looking right at me when I walked out and was following me around as I go shake hands and things and I thought I thought well either it's a bill or an IOU or some something's going on I didn't know what it was and and you know how your mind does and so I walked over to her and she said brother Ben she said the Lord spoke to me this afternoon and told me to give you something I said yes ma'am she said I was sitting in my chair resting me and my husband she said the Holy Ghost spoke to my heart and said she said I had a great big old bookshelf all the way up to the top nice she had hundreds of books in there and she said the Lord spoke to me and said walk to the cabinet go to the top and said pull off the first book up there in the middle open it up in the paper you fall to take it out and give it to brother Ben I said what'd you do she said I went to the Shelf grabbed the top book right in the middle pulled it down opened it up first paper I got I pulled it out I said you didn't go searching for it she said no the first paper I grabbed it and I'm holding it in my hand now this is Brother Brenham standing in the Pulpit when his mother was dying and he made the remark he said like this he said she may be gone tonight said she may already be gone tomorrow so you may already be gone maybe gone tomorrow but says she's still with us tonight he said and if she is with us tonight by God's grace he said I'll be here at the pulpit to fulfill my duty for it becometh me to fulfill all righteousness and I thought well Lord you you're mindful of even these little things like this now I'm saying that to say this the whole reason that I even preach and do like I do is because of my dad when I was 12 years old my father he became permanently disabled with rheumatoid arthritis is permanently disabled he stuck me in a car and packed me across the country take me all these holy ghost meetings and introduce that's how I met brother Carol that's how I met my wife him and all these people and when I was a sinner of course I was raised in the message and I I was in a camp meeting as the night before I got saved there's a fellow there by name of Steve Shelley preaching and he was preaching House of hell and he was talking about uh House of Hell giveaway and then people just got to screaming and hollering House of Hell giveaway women screaming man shaking and running all over the place is mournful it scared me to death I got up out of there and as I walked out the door like this my daddy was standing here looking at me like this my grandpa was Benny Albert and dad always called me Benny he said where are you going Benny I said Daddy that scares me to death he said don't run from it run to it next morning I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I I owe a lot to him and I just wanted to say that and I don't exactly know him maybe you know if they look over the banister of time you know and they get to see what's going on here you like to say thank you a lot you know and how you appreciate them but really I thank God my father for my Earthly dad and it's a lot of the reason why I'm here this morning but it's amazing how even in these hard times like this God was so mindful to let you know that every step every footstep every pathway but could you imagine laying there in a hospital dying they don't send him to hospice he's already in the hospice by this time the Holy Spirit speak to you and say you know you got power to change that don't you now brother sister I'm going to tell you something if you don't have character and I don't claim I got anything except for what God's done for me but if you don't have the right kind of character boy somebody could make a show out of that oh look at me and I've got power and this and that but you know I learned through the years seek for the will of God and seek for what God wants don't seek for what you want and that's really the key of Christianity God thy will be done not my own and not the Lord's Prayer amen so anyhow I just wanted to share that with you we love you and appreciate you and I appreciate your prayers and uh I just thought them little things were outstanding I I wanted to share them so God bless you I'm saying and we'll get right into this preach in just a minute foreign [Music] the [Music] judge turned my way it looks like you're guilty now what do you say I spoke up your honor I have no no that's when Mercy Mercy Waltons walked in and pleaded my case [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] how could this be someone so guilty [Music] had just been set free my chains were broken I felt born again the day that Mercy watches [Music] God's Amazing Grace face the blood was presented that covered my sin oh I'm forgiven cause Mercy I'm forgiven cause mercy walked away [Applause] [Music] can you say praise amen come on [Music] [Music] CE I was walking when [Music] once I was walking when I was small learning new things some people said I'm getting so small tall where there's a little kid girl inside and now God is through the little by little I'm changing [Music] [Music] but God is changing me yeah [Music] sometimes I feel like I'm so far away and now that I know it should be finished [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was [Music] [Applause] [Music] changing me [Music] a little bit nearer [Music] in the mirror [Music] it's all by little I'm changing wallpaper [Music] God is changing [Music] [Music] [Music] changing me little by little [Music] good job good job kid let's stand together this morning amen praise the Lord let's turn this morning to Acts chapter 2. we'll speak to you this morning on these two words one thing one thing amen these two words one thing Acts chapter 2 verse 38. now if you're a Bible read it all you know exactly what this scripture is all about amen amen then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift not gifts now but gift of the Holy Ghost because there is only one true gift it might break up into nine different gifts later might break up into five offices later but there's only one true gift and that's the gift of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord look at that again repent every one of you repent every one of you let's pray together for the word Lord Jesus we thank you this morning for the opportunity to come into your house Lord we are so privileged as your children to be able to Bow our heads over the word of God that's been carved out Lord that's been sacrificed and martyrs and so forth to give their life to us as your children to be able to read from this sacred text this morning and we thank you Lord this morning for the Bible we pray that as the reading has gone forth now that you will come and bring to us a context of this which we're studying this morning may you anoint me May unite the people that we might be receptive and we love you so much Lord for everything you've done in our lives and I know Lord Jesus as I stand here this morning there's probably many many needs right here in this little body of people here at bride of Christ Fellowship and I pray that you'll minister to every need this morning may the Holy Ghost just come today and give us the freedom and the Liberty to be able to express what you have in your mind this morning as we yield ourselves to you for your service in the name of Jesus Christ we commit the word now both speaker and listener and oh God if we've done anything or said anything in a sinful manner to be displeasing to you forgive us of it quickly Lord cleanse Us by thy blood and wash Us by the blood as we say thing coming out here Lord about the precious blood of Christ make it right for us Lord in every way we pray in Jesus Christ's name we commit ourselves now into your hands amen and amen and all the saints said amen and praise the Lord hallelujah and glory to God amen amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good now let's turn to Saint John chapter 3 while you've got your Bible open there and we're going to go to a very familiar picture on the new birth here on the first doctrine that Jesus ever shown and that was here with Nicodemus but now when you get your place there in the scripture just hold it steady for just a moment because I want to give you a foundation if you will on what we're going to talk about this morning the Lord helping us and um you know sometimes in evangelism I like to uh I like to bring things that I think is going to help the body and it changes every place you go sometimes you go to places and you might have a more uh scholarly type group well then I just preach like a Firebrand and I don't know my feet hit the ground I just float the whole time and then when I get on the other side and hit a church it's always up in the clouds and I just anchor myself down and I amen go right into the teaching of the word of God and try to bring balance as part of evangelism is bringing balance everywhere you go and I know pastors have that responsibility but it is also our job as a an evangelist to reprove long-suffering and Doctrine and I think that being that it is my responsibility as an evangelist to come in and set the city on fire run back out as hard as we can go I I it's always needful to try to find what God would have in our our hearts about where we should go and how to go and what to say and how to approach it because you never want to do this with your own mind you understand you never want to try to say well I think the people need this the minute you get that in your mind you'll be as wrong as 100 miles is from 100 miles apart and just be wrong just absolutely wrong and backwards and and it won't help nobody and and I I learned that you can't use your mind of how you're going to approach it and there's been many times you walk out of the office and you think now God I don't know where I'm going to go or how I'm going to get there but I'm just going to trust you and what seemingly sometimes what you think would be the wrong thing to say turns out to be the exact thing you should have been saying all along well the Lord knows how to manage these things if we allow him to do it and you know in my my thinking I feel like that if we would allow God to have control over our lives over our walk with him I feel like that he knows the right pathway for all of us there's only really one thing that God has ever really required of us in the way of Ovation and that is what we just read right here in Acts 2 38 repent now you say of course be baptized yes but all of that comes after this one thing this one thing is repent it's the only thing that God has ever really asked of us now as I say it's good for us to give our lives over to Jesus Christ and allow him to take control allow him to lead us and to guide us because if you allow man to lead your allow some human being of some sort to lead you in some way that man will always use his thinking on how he thinks things should be done and we've seen examples all over creation that you know when a man's doing the leading it always ends up in some disaster it always ends up in some wrong way or some deal like that no matter how successful the person is if a man's doing the leading it always ends up in the failure down the road somewhere you see examples all the time of these businessmen make millions and billions of dollars and they're the spotlight of all the industry and all of that then come down to the end of row old and be like somebody like Jack Daniels who kicked a safe got mad because it wouldn't open up kicked his safe and ended up dying from gangrene in his toe after making millions of dollars selling his whiskey so really when man's leading even what looks like a success it's a complete failure at the very end of the row because really when they've shut those coffins down on many of them that I've preached in their funerals and sang and what more in their funerals and they shut that coffin down on that person I have yet to see all of their houses and lands and monies and stock exchanges and all that go in there with them they go into the ground they're buried six foot under as the expression goes and they're left there without any Earthly thing to take with them except for this one thing whether they did that or didn't do that as God has required it whether they repented or whether they did not repent this is the only thing God has ever really asked of us as his children now I realize that you know there's Holiness things that God asked us to do I realize the three main articles to the church uh water baptism uh communion and foot washing or his brother Joe foreign which I kind of like amen and you get in there and you absolutely uh do these things because you love the Lord we don't take the bread and we don't drink the wine because we believe it's a literal Body of Christ we do it because it's a symbol it is a symbol to show the Lord's death until he comes his broken body unleavened bread why not grape juice now but wine which has a Resurrection Life in it it is the blood of the grapes it is the death the barrel and the resurrection of Those Grapes that bring forth wine it's not grape juice because grape juice has got additives in it man's doctrines and trinitarian everything else stuff down in it but wine is pure amen all the way through it which represents Jesus Christ and his very Doctrine itself because everything that you look at in the natural way of what God's asked us to do all of that is secondary to this one main thing that God is requiring of us and that is to repent to make our hearts right with God now as you got your Bible open there Saint John chapter 3 let's start at verse 1. there's a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi I watch these words we know that thou art a teacher come from God we know that thou art a teacher come from God now here again I want to stress to you as I started out saying these words anytime man is leading the show it's always bound to fail now here these men they are aware that Jesus Christ is on the scene they are mindful of what kind of man he really is because he testifies right here we know who you are but rather than this man Nicodemus come to the Lord Jesus and say all right we're coming in a repentant heart we're coming in a repentant attitude we're asking you to do for us what no other human being can do on this planet because you are the Messiah you are the lamb that takes away the sins of the world we are committing and surrendering ourselves to you but instead of doing that Nicodemus wants to argue watch him here in the next few verses now if he knows that he's a teacher come from God explain to me then why he didn't fall down at his feet and say master teach me you don't see this out of him now watch he says Jesus answered said verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus says how can he be a man be born when he is old and he entered his second time in his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now watch this carefully now here Jesus goes through all of these remarks got about well I guess I'm trying to count here one two three four five six seven eight nine verses all together that really brings this conversation into what the Holy Ghost is all about and in verse 4 instead of Nicodemus saying now Jesus this whole born-again thing is above me I need you to teach me I need you to show me if there's something I'm lacking I want to know what it is that you're talking about instead of doing that he has a arrogant attitude he's ready to argue with Jesus now if you don't think so look at these next words and uh verse 9 look at nicodemus's next words how can these things be you see how he's not doing like the woman at the well he's not doing like the blind man he's not doing like the rest of them that said oh God have mercy on me a sinner he's debating Jesus Christ rather than have the attitude of saying Mighty God you are a teacher come from God and I am surrendering myself to you he enters into a debate with him or I'd like to preach right here for just a minute how many people are doing the very same thing with Jesus Christ oh you say Jesus isn't here the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever he is here in his word he is here and his bride he is here in the form of the Holy Spirit yes yes sir yes ma'am Jesus Christ is here you want to want to answer the question he's here he's here right now amen you say how do you know the Bible said we're two and three are gathered and if they're gathered in my name if they're gathered in the Holy Spirit I'll be right there in the midst of them not just gather for gathers sake but gathered wanting to receive from almighty God what he has in his word one of the hardest things that it is to accept though is somebody always wanting to debate something now here's where I run into a lot of things down through the years I've been at this 27 years this June coming up on 28 years next summer and I preached my whole life I've dealt with hundreds of thousands of people in my lifetime tens of thousands of cases and I I don't say these things I just say it for them to make a point and every one of them are always the same I don't care if they're yellow skin or white skin or black skin or red skin or whoever they might be I promise you people are people and it don't matter if they're This Tall or this tall or you know ever what they might be or going the other direction like me you know hey they're people and they have their own way and their own approach of doing things and listen to me friends people are influenced by Spirits all around this world they're influenced by devils and Satan is the same Satan he's always been from the very beginning he's just gotten smarter he's just has got more devices more tools more ways of being able to get at the child of God or get at the human being and we know that the devil has all of these imps around him that are willing at any moment to do his bidding hey we are up against the greatest battle that any human being could ever fight in this dispensation we're up against it right now has never has there been a time where Satan has been has got so much exposure so much he can get a hold of everything from Hollywood down to the churches he's got his hands wrapped in every one of them and for us we have to be smart we have to be wise to Satan's devices and I see people get influenced by things even in churches oh you say well glory to God I come to church but being in this church doesn't make you any more of a Christian than standing in a garage makes you an automobile come on somebody amen it doesn't mean anything as far as your experience with God being in the church house is only just being in this building this very same building by next week time could be converted into a a into a lodge of some sort to meet for the uh you know for some kind of a uh you know men's Gathering some motorcycle club or so I mean it doesn't matter about the actual physical building itself it is your heart right with almighty God and are you living where you should that's what matters but as I say people are people they always do the things they want to do they behave the way they want to behave they act brother Jesse the way they want to act and no matter what you tell them unless they can willing to do this one thing it'll be debate debate debate debate debate it all comes down to this one thing as I started to tell you as an evangelist I travel and I try to find out what will help the people to kind of bring a little bit of a balance now I know some brothers when they come they find a church that shouts and tears the walls down they get in there with them and do the same thing glory to God we've had a meeting I'm a little bit different I guess I've got a little bit of a Defiance disorder in me I like to rub against the grain a little bit because I feel like that a false balance is wickedness before the Lord and you got people real flighty like that and ain't got no foundation in the word well I say glory to God open your Bible we're going to read some scriptures tonight I'd like to just anchor it down but in my mind I'm thinking God I'm going to try to help these people get somewhere I'm trying to say something to you and I want you to follow my thought here that whenever you get somebody to that spot you think all right now here we are two hours into preaching an hour and a half of what it is I went through 500 scriptures and I've got them anchored down now they walk right out the door the same way they walked in then I go to another church and there might be a stoic you know kind of backward type group everyone it might be and I try to preach the walls on fire they walk out the same way they walked in you know why there's only one thing God ever required of us and that's repentance what you find out in this life friends is it's not about whether or not you can kindly balance and like I said I do it for the right motive I try to balance people in the word I try to be a balanced type preacher I don't want to go on there and just do what everybody likes and act as everybody wants me to act I try to find what will help the church even if it's a little bit different sometimes I want to try to help the body but in all of that all of the wisdom you can apply and all of the smarts you can put together it still takes us one thing right here to get them where they need to get whether they're willing to repent now I know in our mind repentance means coming to you Alder and screaming cry God forgive me God forgive me if there's many different ways to repent and I believe in that too that needs to happen absolutely many times in churches that's why some people don't get any further with God they're not willing to break down their pride and things and come and cry out to the Lord they need to do it sometimes I need to do it sometimes you need to do it sometimes it's a part of our walk with God don't you agree now notice Nicodemus is not in an interview you study this conversation closely you'll find out he's not in the mode of repenting this is not Nicodemus coming to Jesus saying master I need your help he's coming to him like one of these smarter like message guys that knows everything you know I know have you know Jesus I mean maybe Nicodemus was an older man physically speaking he might have been older than the Lord Jesus they tried that trick on him one time he said before Abraham was I am amen amen he always seek to come Osama approach and you watch his Pharisees and his Sadducees sister Wendy they never came to Jesus to understand what the truth of the Gospel really was all about they came for debate's sake well I think this and I think that and I feel this and I believe that you notice even when Nicodemus is responding to Jesus in verse 9. how can these things be that is not the attitude of a repentant man if the man is willing to repent everything that Jesus said to him he ought to have been saying Lord I don't understand it but help me get there help me get there help me understand how do I get from what you're talking about from where I am to where you're trying to take me help me get there how do I get there God it would have been important it's the one thing that God requires of us for salvation the only one thing he's ever asked us to do but it's the one thing many people won't do I I hope you take this right but I have used every every Evangelistic trick in the book and then our tricks believe me when I tell you I have used every expression I should every one-liner I've used every catchphrase trying to move the people in some direction or another and I found out almost 30 years of this there's only one thing that you can get them to do and if they're not willing to do that all of the catch phrases and all the good one-liners and all that listen brother I when I first started I was a Firebrand when I started I still am a Firebrand I still love to preach and and move in the anointing I'm not ashamed of Pentecostal type of knowing I like it I think it's wonderful I enjoy being a part of the Holy Ghost movie I love it I think it's God in action in The Last Day and I started out a Firebrand I'll probably go out of here a Firebrand amen when I started boy I'd kicked my leg this way Hallelujah glory to God hoping somebody would wake up then I'd come over on this side glory to God praise the Lord I'd have big older calls I was in a meeting one time and there was 300 people just packed right up and down the aisles me and Timmy was in Mexico some time ago and and had an honor call and they was going out the back of the door while he was preaching I've seen him get out and cry and holler and Carry On and Shout use gifts and everything else in the world but after the meeting's over with it they still wasn't willing to have this repentant attitude it didn't matter if you kick your leg this way or kick your leg that way or hold your hands this way or hold them that way or be loud or be soft or be scholarly or be Pentecostal it's just one thing that they've got to be willing to do in order to get them somewhere amen I hope we're checking up this morning on our own attitudes about the word of God when you hear something that rubs your grain stop and ask yourself why'd that rub me praise the Lord somebody is it because I've got to repent attitude and it just rubbed my flesh a little bit or is it because I'm a little bit stubborn when it comes to what I think ought to be done remember what I said man always leads you in the wrong direction even if you're the man that's doing the leading man always takes you in a Direction that's contrary to the word of God man cannot keep this word if he could we we wouldn't have needed Jesus Christ hi hey man now I want to say something while I'm here it has been said about people in this message that oh you know and I had a friend of mine that some years ago he left the message and and I was very very close to this brother and it it broke our hearts when he decided to leave the message and I thought you know what what a shame this brother he had a real real Ministry before the Lord it was a real good-hearted guy and a pastor and how to do I mean he went out in the middle of nowhere I mean nowhere there wasn't no there's one message Church within 300 miles of him he went in the middle of nowhere and carved a message search out right almost the side of the mountain as we say in Tennessee now and and I love this man I thought you know I really appreciated his friendship I appreciate it when he left the message it broke our hearts of course and the report came back he said one problem he had about people in this message is we present this message as the only means of salvation I said you said everybody not me I don't I said this message is not a means of Salvation this message is for rapturing faith in the Readiness of Jesus Christ coming the second time salvation comes by Jesus Christ Alone anybody can repent but it takes them to another level when they come into the revelation of this message this message is not for everybody this message is the opening of The Book of Revelation come on now this message is the finishing of the mysteries of God but this message is not a means of Salvation that comes by Jesus Christ Alone now with that said if you are saved and you are bride you will come to this message absolutely the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth and this message is the truth I believe that I believe with all of my heart I believe that everything that brother Branham taught us I believe could be right back here to the scripture and can be balanced out with what Jesus taught with all these other prophets Paul and the rest of them I believe brother when he went beyond the curtain of time and told the angel of the Lord I preached exactly what Paul prayed I believe I believe that's what he preached but we present sometimes I say we I mean some message people that in order to be saved you've got to know the name William Branham but I ain't what the Bible said the Bible said that any man that would know the name of Jesus Christ could be saved that's true now there are different means of salvation Salvation don't mean bride I'm teaching now brother Jesse I'm out of that evangelistical thing for about 30 seconds okay I'm teaching now for a minute but Salvation don't always mean bride there'll be a saved group of people that will dwell on the outside of the city that comes back to this earth there'll be saved people that never knew nothing about this message matter of fact they were only saved because they were good to you there's a group of foolish virgins that will inherit eternal life or not inhere to be given to eternal life rather simply because they were cut off the bride cloth and God allows them to go in as the remnant that come off this bride time they never had the Holy Ghost but they were saved people they knew salvation by Jesus Christ Alone then there'll be a group of people that will be saved that will have salvation that would come on in through salvation but would never make the Bride of Jesus Christ in any way whatsoever who those people are I don't know Jesus categorizes them as when I was in prison you visited me when I was sick you brought me this or you've done that for me yes there are a people that's good to the bride but there's also a saved group that comes in at the same time they're not bride but they're saved I've heard the prophet of God taught that saved don't mean born again [Music] you can be saved and not be born again absolutely right I'll use the example that my buddy Andrew Glover uses he said if you walked out here on this parking lot and you saw a cell phone line on the parking lot you picked that cell phone up you've saved it you brought it in here and get the real Jesse one of these brothers and said hey I found this cell phone somebody could have run it over stepped on it got rained on snowed on everyone I've saved that cell phone but if I pick that cell phone up off the parking lot and I flip it around and it's my cell phone I have not saved it I have redeemed it I have brought it back to the original owner altogether because I was the original owner it was my cell phone and I brought it back to me oh Hallelujah now the difference in being saved and being born again is the difference between saved and Redemption there is no Redemption for anybody outside of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's thus saith the Lord Redemption is alone for those that had their names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world at 144 000 are included in that bride type because Israel was God's bride before he put it away to come over here to these Gentiles but that bride part all of that is redemption God brings you back if you was already his before the foundation of the world but God allowed this this stream of human time whenever Eve fell in the Garden of Eden and so forth like that he allowed in this stream of time tens of thousands of people to be born in this world that would have never originally been intended had she stayed behind that word of God like she was supposed to tens of thousands of people that were never intended to be here on this Earth brother Adam said the way God was going to do it was take the book of life and Adam would take that Lamb's Book and speak him from the dust to the ground and only the names that was on that book would have come forth but I hear Eve falls in the Garden of Eden now we have another program coming in now you have one son another son ten Sons forty dollars you have all of this Humanity coming in and God is not willing that any of them should perish but all of them should come to everlasting life so how does God fix it that bride foolish virgin good to the bride all of these groups can get a chance even Judas got a chance at being saved and in one way he was saved he was justified he was sanctified the prophet of God said when Judas was baptized the devil got baptized when Judas preached the gospel of the devil preached the gospel and one way of looking at things Judah stood there amen his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life which we know is another section of that book of life that name can be blotted out the ones on the lamb section can never be blotted out amen that gives me a consolation to know that no matter what I do or how I live in this life God is obligated to make me do right and go right I'm a child of God and I say well I'm going to quit I'm going to give up I've had enough of this life there's always something there it's always drive you back the other direction amen thank God for that little something that lays on the inside amen I've said it many times the one lesson that I've learned as a Christian was it's never been me holding on to him it's always been him holding on to me amen because of things you see in this life the older you get the harder you get and it wasn't for you know the grace of God in our lives I would quit all together I'd leave this whole thing called the message I'd leave this stuff this church stuff and all this old nonsense walk out and do my own thing but then that's what use about time I hear Jesus say how can you quit something you never began boy because my Bible tells me he that began this good work I didn't begin it but he began it he will finish that work to the day of Jesus Christ but there is a section on This Book of Life of names that can be blotted out the mystery of the foolish virgin are the ones that their names remained on The Book of Life That's the ones that judgment that are called out and he says move depart to you know your workers iniquity go this way and that'd be the goat side he said then those entering the joys that's the Blessed that's him foolish version some of them been good that go on in at the second uh Resurrection at the white Throne judgment they're granted Eternal Light they're not heirs to it they didn't inherit it it was never their personal property God just gave it to him because of their Works in this life here God gave it to him greater than that the Bride of Jesus Christ never stands in the Judgment as a sinner amen because she's been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ she is Forgiven as though it never took place in the beginning Hallelujah amen it's one thing to be forgiven if I made a mark on this wall and I got me some kills and I got some color matching and I matched the paint and kills it over and then covered it over you may never see it but Demarcus still there in the Old Testament God would paint over their sins he covered it where he couldn't see it no more but the Mark was still there they went out with the same old desire that they walked in with but when Jesus shed his blood at Calvary for you and I and the life of God not the chemistry of the blood but the lateral life of Jesus Christ came back to the believer it was as though the mark never went on the wall in the first place glory to God and even greater than that it was it was it went so far back it went all the way back so deeply back that as though there was nothing to make a mark in the first place amen amen I didn't even have the ability to make the mark That's How far back God took us now there's a difference in that and a difference in somebody that's cut to a different different cloth or a different pattern a different way God though puts every single one of us on this same Foundation repent now I've just got through describing to you about eight or ten different end results but where do they start at it has the same effect when a foolish virgin is repenting as it does if a bride member is repenting same as it does that somebody even be what we'd say serpent seed or somebody that'd be Satan's child let the devil come and repent and God might forgive him on certain conditions he might forgive him if he would repent but you want to know one reason why that Satan ain't never made a move to do right he ain't never going to repent that's why I hope you understand what I'm saying to your church it doesn't matter where the end result is there's only one thing God ever acquired of us that's repent repent say you're sorry now after that God may take him this direction that direction this direction that direction that direction that's up to God where he wants to take us but we all start at the same Foundation of repentance he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ now what was the difference in these ones that repent and this one like Nicodemus that's the one thing that he would not do the Pharisees refused to Humble themselves to Jesus New Testament Doctrine this is what he was bringing to him he said a new commandment bring I to you oh they'd sit around and say what it mean a new commandment who do you think you are Moses who are you one of these Prophets John told the story on that one he said oh he said let me tell you who he is not just a prophet but this is the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world brother man said Not only was he a prophet but he was God of the prophets he was the prophet of prophets the king of kings absolutely right Jesus Christ was all at all he was the very head of the church said Paul amen and him being the head he was the one that had the mind of Christ when Paul said Philippians 2 let this mind that was in Christ Jesus also be in you the Lord Jesus had the mind of God 100 not partially in all of it let me give you an example in the unveiling of God but Abraham uses a word called kinos k-e-n-o-s it's a Greek word and uses this word to describe how that God poured himself out of Heaven into Jesus Christ now kinos would be like I've got this bottle of oil here in my hand Keynotes would not be that I take this oil and pour it into another cup that's not kinos whatever you know something it would mean that the liquid the bottle the glass the lid the seal the paper all of it will go from one completely into the other that's kinos when God poured himself into Jesus Christ it wasn't just the oil that went into Jesus but in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily cap seal oil bottle everything became Jesus Christ now then when Jesus is standing here talking to Nicodemus and he says You must be born again in other words you must receive the Holy Ghost well I reckon he knew what he was talking about because he was standing there a man baptized with the Holy Ghost he knew all the doctrine he knew what Moses said he knew what all them prophets said he was living on another level altogether and yet Nicodemus was sitting there under that intellectual thing they knew the word of God so well they could quote you every uh uh uh but but that Moses ever said when he was preaching they knew it so well they could quote volume chapter verse and in what color the book was but this is one thing that Jesus was trying to get him to understand there's a whole other level you can go to Nicodemus what you've got is okay like he told the Rich Young Ruler whatever you come to him he said you know the Commandments he said all these I've kept from the youth up I'm a message kid I was raised in the message you said and he was I done all of these things since I've been a youth and Jesus said but one thing you lack well I know we talk about that oh it was money and so that that was the material part but the real lacking in his heart was the fact he wouldn't repent you see repent means that you've got to give God control again let me say when you let man lead it it always ends up in disaster so the only way that we could ever come to the realities of Jesus Christ and what he is we've got to allow him to take full control of everything we do I hope you understand brother sister that a lot of times the reason people come so far in God sometimes they sit in churches for years you know uh uh like like down south from us a little bit Pastor for 30 years all of a sudden they're done we see these people spend all that time what happens they lose that repentant attitude they lose that attitude of being teachable and touchable they lose that attitude of being able to receive from God a new understanding to be changed to be corrected even and let me tell you when a man a woman gets to that spot they're in a bad place you can argue with them and I've done it you can fight with them and I've done that you can threaten them with bodily harm and I've done that too I remember one guy who was into it and he was really going at it and he said I'm getting out of here I said you head to that door I'm going to tackle you don't you leave me wrong in the middle you go through all these things and try to wrestle them like Jacob almost wrestling god try to hold him down but if they don't have a repentant attitude be it a man boy girl child preacher Deacon trustee you can't do nothing with them until they get that attitude back now let's look at a character in the Old Testament to prove this Saul and David the very difference between Saul and David was this one thing that I'm talking about this morning Saul arrived in a place to where he thought I'm king of the world I can control I can speak I've got money I've got power all I gotta do is say it and everybody will they'll they'll holler to what I say yes so yes yes yes whatever you want we'll do what you want us to do but there was one man in the Kingdom that wasn't absolutely going to put up with it his name was Samuel God told him through Samuel go down there and kill everything kill kill a guy kill the women kill the children kill the the the the cattle kill the kill and get out of it Saul said in his heart I'll do what I want to if I get down there and I think I can make a good business proposition play a little church politics I think it'd be good for my bottom line well I'll work it out the way I want to I'm King I'm anointed after all who is saying well he's the one that had the oil I'm the one he put it on Samuel come to him he said if he died that the Lord told you to do he said oh yeah yeah I've done it sure I've done it don't you see the difference change the picture just a moment Now find out when David got in trouble when Nathan come to him and said let me tell you a story about a man that done such David man is on the Pharaoh fly Nathan said Thou Art the man now look at the difference here's Saul standing here in front of Samuel and Samuel says done everything the Lord yeah I've done it what's the bleeding of this sheep I hear oh you see the people it's the people's fault I I tried to tell them I tried and amazing the man had a complete and total Authority until he got in trouble and that was the people's fault you're talking about people that he would threaten their life if they didn't obey him any other day of the week do what I say it's going to cost you your head or a night in jail or whatever but all of a sudden now when Samuel puts the rubber to the road all of a sudden now Saul has got an excuse why he can't do it but look at David look at the difference when Nathanael says to him without The Man David didn't say well you know that's a that's quite an accusation don't you know I could take your head from your shoulders for that thing come here guards take this man down put him in the dungeon what'd David do oh God Forgive Me Lord forgive me God I'm guilty you know one reason the prophet of God said that David was a man after God's Own Heart because he had a repentant Spirit about him oh Hallelujah but what Samuel say to Saul when he was left when you was when you saw yourself as being little when you was hiding around this stuff you depended on God but now you're a big king and you think you rule the world you're not little in your eyes no more Saul you see yourself as being a big shot y'all know what a big shot is don't you it's a it's a little shot far away from home laughs amen and here he stands there with this attitude on him Samuel takes a sword and kills a guy right there in front of his face what's the blaming of the sheep I hear somebody that God required for obedience is better than your sacrifices he even tried to turn it religious well I'm going to sacrifice these unto the Lord sure you was sure you was Saul I bet you had a I bet you had a sheep traitor just out on ready you had him on your speed dial get ready to make you some money at the end of the day but it was the one thing that David would do it was the one thing that Saul would not do he would not repent now hold on lady who sins I'm coming to your backyard in just a few moments but look at how the attitude changed look at David when you read him in the song my couch is wet with tears oh brother sister I want to ask you a question we have had ever experience when it comes to Doctrine we've had ever Supernatural Revelation when's the last time we've had that experience making our couch wet with tears crying out to God saying God forgive me help me Lord [Music] because we get bigger on site we get to think and we can run the place we can take the ball and we'll just run it how we want to run it one thing we have to understand brother Adam said about a pastor he said that if the pastor's got the ball for example he talked about like a football game he said we blocked for the man he said we don't strip the ball out of his hand and run it ourselves he said we block for him but listen in this game My Life brother sister Jesus is the one who's got the football Hallelujah somebody praise the Lord somebody we ought to take it out of his hand we allow hand nor how do we block for him that's the way the game of life is played who is a god amen amen amen that's the one thing that folks won't do I've kicked my leg this way I kick it that way I've tried to catch him in the odd ways if they're a stoic bunch I've tried to preach them in the clouds it's very clouds up but there's one thing that God requires only one thing Godly sorrow worketh repentance it's the one thing we need in our message today to bring Revival to the churches is a repentant attitude now listen let me explain it to you in this message today on this crazy little tablet I preach on I can hook up Wi-Fi I can sit down in a coffee shop but I said I didn't hit a button on the table down there I tell you everything brother said about the Rapture no matter about 10 seconds we've got Bibles on top of Bibles where I used to go to college that I used to cross the international headquarters of The Gideons almost every every week I'd cross that big headquarters up there and I thought there's the word of God being printed and presses back up here in that headquarters but 10 Bibles don't change your life the message don't change your life it's this attitude whether it'll change your life or not because you can have all of the message you can have all of the Bibles if you're not willing to do this one thing it won't do nothing amen that one thing is what brings us into this channel that one thing is what brings us into this atmosphere of understanding what this message is all about and what this Bible is all about forgive me but a man without that or a woman without that or a pastor without that or a deacon without that he's just flying by sexuals or she is they are walking by faith they're not walking in the spirit they're walking by their own arm of understanding and as I've said several times allow me to say it again when you lean to the arm of Flesh you will always lead you in the wrong direction because man is not permitted to know the ways of God Only God can take the reins there's only one thing that God ever asks look at Nicodemus again verse 9 watch him Nicodemus answered said unto them how can these things be Jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of Israel and no it's not these things Jesus said you want to debate let's do her you want to fight I'm ready for the fight bring it boy I know what I'm standing the Bell Rings the boxing gloves come on but look at the difference scene when Jesus Is by The Well side in Saint John 4. when he's standing about the well side you don't hear no Bell you don't see no boxing gloves glory to God I feel like hollering oh God you don't see no rubs you don't see no referee there ain't no trainers in the corner Jesus is sitting on the well says to go get your husband look how easy he made it for why because she had a repented attitude he knew that she would receive his promised word of the day hey man we knew that there was something on the inside the prophet said them Pharisees were all white on the outside but dark on the inside but she was lying on the inside where she was dark on the outside amen she wasn't religious she didn't have a religious exterior but she had enough for opinion of attitude when Jesus said go get your husband you don't have one he said you said the truth don't worry go back here and find Nicodemus talking that way he said we know you're a ruler in Israel well you slimy hypocrite if you know it how come you didn't take a stand for him then if you're now that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday forever if you not that's why it is true if you've watched him heal watch him raise the dead watched him open Blind Eye watched him do all these great things tell me the Nicodemus why don't you make a public stand for it why because this one thing he wouldn't repent even though Jesus put him in the corner boxed him to The Knockout I don't know if it's a TKO or a 10 count but it was someone okay right to the Limit and Jesus said are you a master in Israel and you don't get this a friend you say what are you making so hard on him because Jesus knew his attitude listen to me children of God one reason sometimes God makes it hard on people is because he knows their attitude before he says a word to him you know what I Gage let me tell you what I Gage if I have a big meeting let's say this morning I get done preaching this I have an altar calling every single one of you pastors included me included for that matter just put me in there I could be fair Jesse Oliver down here screaming and crying and squalling by the end of this service I walk away I said Thank You Lord but ain't when I watch to see what's going on you know what I watch I watched six months after this meeting I watched down the road to see are they coming to church are they paying their tithes are they given their offerings are they reading their Bible are they saying uh forgiveness things to their brother and sister are they keeping bitterness out of their heart are they living right at home are they attending church regularly I watch to see is what they done up here is it really a repented attitude or was it a show hoping they could get God to kind of give them a pass from going to hell hello somebody yes sir brother you have to realize where we're coming at Hollywood evangelism you know what brother I'm called it that because what I just described to you is Hollywood evangelism it looks good on the internet forgive me I appreciate it I'm not against it it looks good on the internet when a preacher has a big meeting and the altar's full he can stand up here and he can jump and kick his leg Gloria God all of that's wonderful but brother where are they Landing after you've got them preached in the clouds Hollywood evangelism doesn't bring the people to Godly sorrow it works them up gets them into an emotional thing God sorrow is what works repentance not emotional if you just get emotional with me this morning because I'm emotional well then then all I did is work on your emotions and that's okay I don't mind making you emotional if I get emotional and you feel it and you get emotional too praise the Lord but when our feet touch the glass what is our attitude when we hit the ground you say well well certainly people are carrying on to order you should appreciate that what if one of them was named Esau because the Bible said he sought it with bitter tears and it wasn't found just because they can cry and Squall and carry on I've been to some of these places overseas and mine uh and I and I don't mean any remark against nobody when I say this just my own experiences I'm referring to I've been in places in Africa where some of them folks have come out of idol worship and when they was in idol worship they would scream and holler and dance and carry on to their idols and then when they crossed over the message they maintain the same type of behavior only for Jesus Christ that doesn't mean it's the Holy Ghost doing that sometimes it's just training oh God y'all get any quicker we're going to revert to the to the Presbyterians or something come on now preach with me sometimes it's just the humanistic side but if it's Godly sorrow it'll work repentance real evangelism isn't about kicking your leg this way or kicking leg that way Pastor in a church teaching the body being an apostle or a missionary being prophetic to the body has nothing to do with how deep you can get it's whether you can get the people to this attitude right here because if everything we do doesn't lead to this right here we're fighting a losing battle I don't care who you are because I could preach mysteries of God and I do I could preach deep things and I will this will do of God permit but if I'm dealing with a bunch of people that don't have a repentant spirit how is anything I'm going to say I'm going to get across to him right it can't it absolutely can't let me show you how deep this goes let's turn the Book of James real quick now I may have used this example in many many many other services and preaching different ways but this really stood out to me in this little message I'm bringing to you this morning and I'm watching the time we're getting down to a little while here in just a minute I know we got to go eat and come back at four so I'm going to save some of it for tonight amen now watch in James chapter one there's a whole build up if you will of James trying to balance us out on works now in the Book of Romans Paul is trying to establish this upon our faith it's our faith that save us and so forth like that but James in the Book of James is showing us our works paired with our faith he said if you want to say got faith all right I'll show you by my Works in that Bible and I would have said now when James is bringing what the real man is supposed to look like I'm talking about the Christian Godly Man James refers that this man he refers it to a model that would be modern day for them a modern day way of looking into a mirror okay now for these people looking into a mirror wasn't the same for us or as the same as us I mean to say in other words they might use brass they might use some kind of a an instrument you hear Paul say looking through a glass Darkly it's because it wasn't the type of glass like we got today so they might uh even in the Old Testament the women would take their looking glasses which was brass pieces and they would shape them and artify someone more for the making of the brass the labor and the uh the brass Ultra the Brazen altar all that stuff come from looking glasses or what we would say would be pieces of metal but now in James referring in verse 22 but be you doers of the word and not hear is only deceiving your own selves for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetth what manner of man that he was now when they looked into their mirrors or their glass we in our in our society today we've got them up here eye level everyone look I know that's true because every one of you got every hair if you got hair in place this morning every one of you why because our mirrors are always up like this our ties are straight sisters our dresses are just so so because we constantly look we know what we look like that's why some of y'all probably think you're you're either ugly or beautiful one or the other depends on what you see when you see it right because you're always constantly looking in my mirror you know even uh say that there's a picture on the wall let's say uh right here the Hoffman's head of Christ you look at it maybe from sisters angle or brothers angle right here look up in a certain direction they'll see a reflection of something you close to it I can see my reflection in that glass everything's at eye level but in this time period that James is referring to they didn't have things at that level they set the glass on the ground so in order for the man to see himself he had to stoop down to get down there he had to get down to a place of humility in order to see his own reflection he didn't have it at eye level like we do he had to get down like this in order to see himself the right way and this is where James said this is the reason he forgets what man or man he is because looks into that mirror he stands back up well he you don't have it here he has it here so he forgets what how did that go again he has to get right back down again oh glory to God what a perfect type of the real Christian of a Christian man or Christian woman as a Son of God Amen they are looking at a high level because we don't put ourselves on the same level as God but in order to see him right we got a stoop we got to get down it's one reason why we bow our heads when we pray you realize that one reason we bow our heads when we pray is we are showing humility to the one who created us glory to God hallelujah we are showing our life of surrender Glory by powering our head over and saying Lord Jesus so when this man looked into the mirror in order for him to see his true reflection as a godly man that is he had to stoop now you know why some people will never see themselves in the word right because they're not willing stoop yes sir you know how it goes in churches he looked right at me when he said that at a small Church like this I'm sure he will I I don't mean small and derogatory senses but I mean we at eye level he said we'll have glory to God brother Jesse just knew about my circumstance brother Jesse just knew about my that's the reason he said that what's the difference does that make whether you know it or you don't know it when you feel led to the Holy Ghost to say something you got to say something just in case you don't know you ain't the only one in this church building every Sunday and Wednesday and whenever you have church sometimes one example can be not for just you but could be for other members of the body but people got chips on their shoulder glory to God Hallelujah that Pastor don't he know he ought to leave me alone when he's preaching maybe maybe God's the one bugging you maybe it ain't the pastor because I'll tell you something right now brother sister sometimes the pastor don't always know who he bugging Glory come on now they're not infallible people they don't know everything that goes on and when people go through circumstances it's hard not to say things that relate or sound like seems like but you know what when you're preaching the gospel you just got to preach it the people of their attitudes glory to God and they wonder why they never get any further in God than where they're at to lacking or repenting that what would be the difference if you'd stop and say hell yeah maybe maybe brother Jesse or brother Ben or whoever maybe them brothers maybe maybe brother cam maybe brother cam up here and preached some well God maybe brother cam maybe he did know about that thing but you know what he's a spirit-led man and God was leading him and I'm trusting that was for our benefit somewhere another which one you all think God appreciates better he appreciates the one that has the repentant attitude now I I'm not reading these a lot of these things word by word on purpose because we'd be here all morning and I I like to read I like to read the Bible but I want to refer to you just a scripture here before we close and we'll go a little bit further into other things tonight but just right here where we're at I just want to bring us to this place in the temple Jesus of course gives this parable about this event and he says here that two of them went down to the temple to pray and he said the one standing there at the temple he was a Pharisee the other one he's just no publican he didn't get his name called in the market he didn't have his phylactus on his head and his arm he didn't have his long borders and his long dresses and when when he uh what I call dresses they're robes over into their dresses but anyhow the public can walk down through the synagogue or down on the streets of the synagogue or wherever it might be people will say well hello that Pharisee hi there sir honor Reverend hi there doctor when he walked by him and said oh God does he have to walk so close to me he stinks ain't bathed in a month oh God oh when Mr Pharisee walked down oh hello Reverend oh can I get you anything going to get you a cup of coffee can I help carry your Bible there can I uh what can I do for you sir uh Reverend sir Jesus Takes these two men and he places them in the temple lower to God and it shows how the Republican gets down and beats on his chest ah mercy on me I'm a sinner and then Here Comes Mr Reverend Dr Pharisee high and mighty thank you Lord creator of heavens and earth great omnipotent God who By the Waters for our fathers and by the way thank you for not making me like this scumbag over here Jesus said which one you would think walked away Justified it wasn't a Pharisee uh amen it was this guy down here saying God have mercy on me as soon let me tell you something children I don't care how deep in this message you get how much you learn or how much you know you ever lose that attitude right there you're gone I don't care who you are you're gone and there's no way back until you come back to that attitude right there I'm gonna shock you for a minute I don't mean this correctively but I want you kitties listen this real good remember this is a good little nugget Sunday school nugget okay Jezebel was a good woman y'all see them eyes going like that she was brother Branham said she was a good woman in the beginning but it was as she developed she turned into what we know today as Jezebel Nebuchadnezzar was a good man tell it was fam had a tender heart before God but his heart became hardened ready for another one Hezekiah when he turned his face to the wall and told God to let him live the prophet said the reason he'd done that is because he had more work to do for God and didn't want to die then because he had more Idols to bust more Groves to burn down and more things to do for the kingdom of God he had a Godly objective but when God said it's however he changed his attitude toward God and said oh God no it ain't over yet because I got more stuff I got to do but who's the one carrying the football Hezekiah and you know what he created more trouble in the last 11 years of his life and what he would if he would have just went on because the god that raised up Hezekiah is a God that could have raised up another Hezekiah mightier than him oh shall we see example examples of it down through the scripture all right I'm going to give you another example somebody that was tender before the Lord the Heathen King that Abraham lies to God he said you're good as a dead man but Lord didn't he tell then he'd tell me that was his sister Lord you know the Integrity of my heart a heathen and you can't get some of these backslid message people even say Amen in church much less than anything like that I don't mean you all I mean the attitude of people against the last day move of God real holy ghost moving in Pentecost they just sit there like a duck on a river they only look at it as being anything spiritual come on somebody but this Heathen King Glory he had such a repentant heart God said I know the Integrity of your heart that's why I didn't permit you to sin against me glory to God he said as a matter of fact I'm going to make a way for you go back to my Prophet let him pray for you because when you go tell him what I've revealed to you he's got some repentance to do on the same token and when Abram got caught what'd he say oh Lord I mean he said you're right Lord you see the difference between a lot of people brother it comes down to this attitude we're talking about right here forgive me for this but uh some years ago it's been five or six years now on this believed the sign thing hit the message seek ye the truth and all this stuff that come up I'll try to be nice when I say this even though I don't feel so nice about it but all these things come up you realize what was happening it was the devil seeking out people who had been walking the fence all these years and he just give them an excuse or a reason to tip over the fence and to choose what side that they've been leaning either way listen the only way they can fall back toward God is they've got to have a repentant attitude so he gives him an out God will give them an excuse if they want one remember what he said about those that put their hand to the plow and then turn around said they're not even Worthy he said if they once they make the decision they got to stick with it all the way you can't walk the line you understand what's happening the reason things are thinning out like the all around the ranks the reason why at this church this morning I told brother Jesse last night I suggested you could have a big church I mean you got a big sweet group here now Lord have mercy come a long way from that four or five we started with in the beginning and beginning God's bless this little body why you got a good pastor he loves God I'm jealous of him in a way I come in here he's down on his face before God crying out and all of his young ones around him I thought oh God that's kind of man I want to be I want that I want to see my girls in that I want to see our families in the message I like to see all of them with that kind of spirit about him he said but I don't know if I agree with all of his Doctrine but you better have the same attitude as God or else it won't matter to end What doctrine is all about what disagree You can disagree but if you don't have that kind of attitude it isn't going to matter whether you agree or disagree at the end of the day because God ain't looking to see if you've got all of your little eyes dotted and T's crossed I told Jesse Esther I said it was his birthday by the way happy birthday to you happy birthday to you and you don't look no older he gets better looking with age me I get balder but I I told him I said you could have a big church if you want it all you got to do is lay a few empty hands on some empty heads call a few women to preach drop your standard I said before nightfall you'd have a church of 400 sitting in here just glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord but at the end of the day what kind of people do you have people that if you really present truth to them they won't listen to it no matter what you should tell them God ain't looking for the type of person that has everything right understand as men our intellectual brain can work against us we're smart people in this life it's day and age they don't think we're smart look at us we can shoot a rocket to the moon can't get it back sometimes when we can shoot her up we're actually it's an intellectual day yes sir all my science progressed to the place we progressed we got a stupid telephone in our hand that can do everything and yet ain't got enough brains to turn it off and set it down and talk to your families that suffer we smart people you understand what I mean there's a need that might be one thing you know we sometimes we text and things and we got to do it but I'm talking about some people are glued to that thing you know what I'm talking about they've almost forgotten the art of human interaction because they don't interact no more is everybody on Facebook and Twitter and all these other places right we're such a smart educated people that we know how to do everything but when it comes to serving God brother you can't use not one intellectual mind it's not whether or not I can figure the seals out figure the Thunders out figure the godhead out figure water baptism out if that's the route you take you're missing the one thing that God's ever asked of us let me say my brother Ben God asks us to be holy God all of that's true but that's after this one thing living holy ain't gonna do you no good if you don't repent all right Paul said though I have ah streets of God get my body to be burned yet without love and how could you ever receive that love unless you're willing to rip in now Revelation chapter 3. Revelation chapter three I told you I was going to get this lady who sins in here before this is over let's get there revelation 3. just love the Bible don't you now watch this last stage I pick him up here in this third chapter verse 14 under the angel of the church the latest thing to write he knows her works because I'll say us I'm rich in Greece with Goods skipping down here now 17. picking up A.T a council buying me gold Trident of Fire he says anoint thy eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see now watch this next verse I hear is the spirit of a real Christian in lady Lucia as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous in other words don't wait around for the right opportunity don't wait for the cards to line up or for the things to stack up or the things get in a row and how people talk waiting for such and such no no don't wait till the Ducks get in the Rope be zalius the moment God moves on you repent you hear Brothers prayer lines whenever he's getting ready to call on the discernment the Holy Spirit be over somebody maybe the brother there and he'd say oh oh he's going to miss it he's going to miss it maybe that sister oh she's going to miss it she's going to miss it he said see answer quickly when the Holy Spirit starts moving this is what Jesus said here be zealous therefore and what learn Mysteries become more deep more intellectual put the Thunders together but to God had to get listen all that's wonderful but if you miss this none of that will mean anything to you because this right here is the main thing amen amen repent they were Rich they were increased so good they had need of nothing and God's telling them repent very next verses you know what he's talking about behold I stand at the door and knock you know why they were standing at the door of his church and knocking because they wouldn't do verse 19. they would not repent therefore they put Jesus Christ out of the church world they put him out of the church put him out of there choirs put out their music put him out of their preaching when he said in the in the series was preaching their Tabernacle we talked about the lady was seeing time that little girl with her hair balled up on her back preacher said God's children must be excellent wonderful she said amen glory to God that's right and everybody crane their neck around look at her before long they told her to quiet down them before that or after that rather they asked her to leave and he screamed out and said your dad and you don't even know it why because they would not repent they wouldn't repent of their intellectualism they wouldn't repent of their formal ways they wouldn't repent of their denominational ideas and standings and it put Jesus on the outside listen to me message children if we're not careful we'll do the same things that the lady of seeing Bunch has done the Pentecostal bunch the same thing they'd done to Jesus Christ when he comes down a mighty angel with a book open in his hand he comes down sets his foot on the land sets his foot on the sea one foot here one foot here if there's time is no longer in other words these denominational ages has run out not the Methodist not the Presbyterian not the Baptist not the Church of God not Pilgrim Holiness not Luther not none of them will never have a chance to do verse 19 ever again and what I receive them as long as they're out there in that organized system cut out of her my people yes that doesn't mean they can't repent from there and then come on but as long as they follow that attitude that was fostered in those environments as long as they follow the denominational Creeds and doxology whoever heard of Peter stand up on the day of Pentecost so let's let's say together now the Apostles Creed that church back home I was telling you about Jesse I was at a funeral one time and somebody had died it was a sinner man that had died I guess this man or woman or who it was and we went there out of respect for the family that was gathered there and found me from the local church there and this I guess he was a Lutheran remember who he was he stood up and he said now we will recite the Apostles Creed and I looked around and there's some of our own message people standing up there reciting it with him oh God I just sat down I thought y'all they may get mad at me but if they want me to recite the Apostles Creed I'll read to him Acts chapter 2 verse 38. because that was their that was their Creed a lot of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission to say that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but it's the attitude oh we don't want to offend anybody we don't want to hurt anybody we don't want to sure but compromise your standard and put Jesus on the outside of the church well we don't want to cause separation sometimes the word of God causes separation and if the word is doing it that's entirely all right if I'm the one doing it that might be a different thing but if the word's doing it then so be it because God separated the light from the darkness for a reason yes but the world put him out you think we're not too far behind this you think we're coming to a time look around pay attention what's going on even in your own local area you say well I don't get out much sure but look around your own local church look around around the rest of the body look at what you hear trickling in coming from the outside look at the condition of your city we're right for judgment why not because this city of Akron and these other places and Loki and these other spots around it not not because they don't know the seals or don't know brother Bam's message that ain't the reason we're right for judgment right for judgment because of one reason you've got a city and a nation full of people that won't repent right you could put a Billy Graham on every street cornica but oral Robertson every Pulpit could put a William Branham in every Church and they won't repent at one time America had a good heart but at the end of 1956 ushering in 1957 by the time it hit Jan 1 1957 the prophet of God wrote it in the church age book she's done she's over she'll never come back why not think of it 1957 was quite a ways before brother Branham really started digging into Doctrine they came out of church it wasn't until 1958 he starts preaching things like the unity of one God and one church 1959. he starts bringing to us uh uh why we're not a denomination why I'm against organized religion 57 he brought Christianity versus idolatry they came 1960 brings us Daniel 70 weeks the serpent seed he starts building on those thoughts 1962 building building come to 63 the opening of the seals God was done with that denominational bunch he was done with this Bunch called Americans they shut the door on him because they wouldn't repent and it amazing that the very precursor to the opening of the word was a Ministry of healing and repentance around the world God was looking for a bride that be willing to do this you know the ones that entered on into the truth of it the ones that was willing to repent the ones that was willing to change who they were to follow the fresh message of the day all right one last thing we're going to stand this in Acts chapter 2 verse 38 was the first message to the New Testament Church it's the first one and it's the last one and it still hasn't changed in between repent repent repent that's the message of God to all of us get right with God I think I told you last time I was here take your experience and put it a hundred years ago you may not think you're a Powerhouse but take the same Holy Ghost experience you got it'd start a Welsh Revival same prayer life that you got today it would spark a a healing campaign same Bible studies that we have in this day and age the Lord they'd start a worldwide Ministry overnight if we was living a hundred years ago 200 years ago back in that anointing when them things were moving like that why aren't people moving like that today because they won't repent at the preaching of the Gospel I said one thing I mean two things I just thought of another Jesus went down and preached to the souls in prison who was the ones he was preaching to message people in general but message people as you would say the people here in the message of the hour that would not repent at the preaching wonderful this is what God requires one thing that's all he ever asked us to do well so then after that one thing what am I supposed to do let him carry the football on everything I don't care about your money be your house your homes your lands your family your health let him pack the ball stand with me thank you Jesus I got everything done in an hour and 40 minutes I'm so proud of myself today amen you figure our preaching 15 minutes of talking 10 minutes of saying I ain't too bad for a day's work isn't Jesse amen you know friends the one thing that I pray I I know compared to somebody in here I I'm this may sound silly to you but being on the other side of 40 now a little bit of a change in me I think if that thing's a little different things a little different and I pray this all the time God I've studied this word since I've been a little boy there's scriptures laying in this Bible like according verbatim for hours at a time never even peel back a scripture things I could quote in a message I could tell you what side of the page you're on on whether it's the old book or the new book and how many butts he said I said God what if I come to the road like my daddy did he had dementia Alzheimer's he couldn't even hardly remember where he was at half the time a month before he died he was sitting in my house in Tennessee and he stood up in my room I have up and my oldest daughter's Elizabeth room and he stood up hello Walker with him and he pulled over the door and he got right up close to my face he said Benny where am I at I just can't seem to find my room I said Daddy you're with me in Tennessee oh he said but my room's around here somewhere isn't it and I thought God I may come to a spot like my dad where I may not be able to remember where I'm at but always let me have Lord that repentant type spirit and anytime you want to deal with me or anything that you want to talk to me about I got that kind of hard to say God I want to hear you I want to hear what you got to say because you realize that's the only thing God has ever required of us one thing happens to be the one thing that people just won't do anymore but God help me help me be a David not a soul help me be like the thief on the cross you know there were two of them there the one standing and looking and said why don't you just speak the word and get off that cross you who you say you are Jesus didn't even answer if you don't even find him having a conversation with him but then the other fellow looked at him and said Lord when you come to your Paradise remember me sure it was a deathbed repentance but still it was a repentance that's the only one thing and what Jesus say to him this day you'll be in Paradise With Me even prophesied today was going to die how Jesus know they kept him alive for five or six days but there he is hanging on the cross a sinner himself George Jesus didn't die God he died of Sinner sure did he had to it couldn't have been the propitiation for my sins and went to the Cross as God he went as a sinner he became a sinner for me that I could become the righteousness of God they tell me that when brother Brown went and saw the movie The Robe or no it's been her one of them I think it was is that one spot where Jesus woken up to calvary's Hill it stops and does a few things Supernatural in the movie brother was standing they said outside the movie house they looked at another brother said he couldn't have done that because by that time he had all the sins of the world had done been placed on him he was a sinner he had to walk up calvary's hill to Center but yet his character his attitude was still intact though he had homosexual Aid on him perversions of all kinds laid on him theft laid on him he's the Lamb of God but he's got all of the sins of the world remember that little lamb became the center of Israel when he went to lay his hands on that little lamb it became the center of Israel they were the ones that became clean the lamb became the sinner well they're pulling his beard out glory to God he said father forgive him you see there was that repentant attitude father forgive him they don't know what they're doing oh God let me always have that attitude that's about her hits this morning Lord Jesus how we thank you this morning for your word God I pray that the Holy Spirit Will just come into this place today and Lord you will bless us oh God with this repentant attitude some Services Lord we seek for Revelation which is wonderful Life Giving life prevailing revelation we need it but God before Revelation could come to us we've got to have a repentant heart we got to have a teachable spirit a touchable attitude so Lord I'm praying for every one of us this morning and Lord if there be one here even today that would have a resistance in their heart to what I'm saying God I just pray that you'll loosen them up allow them to think very seriously about their ways not every one of us checked this morning check up on our hearts to see whether we be in the faith or not granted Lord don't let us go out of here like the rest of these people in the world that go on day by day no matter what God does right before him shakes himself right in front of their face yet they don't see it though one be raised from the dead they're still not convinced but God
