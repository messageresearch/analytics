[34:06] he knew the color of our eyes before was
[34:09] ever born
[34:10] he wrote our name the prophet of God
[34:13] said he wrote our name and spoke it
[34:16] before there was ever a world then no

[34:30] amen isn't that wonderful to know that
[34:32] we can cast their cares upon him because
[34:36] he cares for us what a privilege it is
[34:38] to serve a living God this morning you
[34:41] know you go to India and you'll see
[34:43] people they'll fashion a god out of wood
[34:47] or they'll fashion it out of stone or
[34:50] some kind of metal and they'll pack that
[34:52] guard around and every once in a while
[34:53] they'll set this guard down that they
[34:56] made with their hands and they'll
[34:57] worship this God you'll see it right on
[34:59] the side of the road they'll just set it
[35:00] down and start worshipping this God that
[35:03] they made with their hands but I'm so
[35:06] glad this morning that the god I worship
[35:09] I didn't make with my hands but he made
[35:12] me with his hands stay ahead isn't that
[35:15] wonderful
[35:16] a man it is it's not so much me packing
[35:19] him around but it's him packing me a man
[35:22] and so as long as he's holding my hand
[35:25] you know everything will be all right
[35:26] isn't that wonderful may the Lord bless
[35:28] you richly this morning my name is
[35:30] brother Darrell ward from down in
[35:32] Tennessee no southern I'm going down
[35:33] that way and I don't know a whole lot
[35:35] about the Lord Jesus but I sure love to
[35:37] tell what little bit I know I know he's
[35:40] healed me when I was sick he saved me
[35:41] when I was lost man he opened my eyes to
[35:45] what he's doing in this hour and we're
[35:47] grateful for that and to know that he's
[35:49] the same yesterday today and forever and
[35:50] so we want to look at some of those
[35:51] things this morning and I know some of
[35:53] you don't know me but I trust that you
[35:55] can look beyond the veil of not knowing
[35:59] me and see my heart and my desire is not
[36:01] to come and preach something new to you
[36:03] or show you want to know but just to
[36:05] draw you into a closer fellowship with
[36:07] the Lord Jesus a man so that's truly our
[36:09] desire of this morning if you have your
[36:11] Bibles turn with us to the
[36:13] the Book of Luke we want to read there
[36:14] from Luke chapter 1 starting at verse 30
[36:16] and we greet you in the name of the Lord
[36:17] Jesus we appreciate our precious brother
[36:20] Smith allowing us to come this way and
[36:22] to be with you for this weekend and you
[36:24] saw brother Darrell were small in number
[36:26] but you know the Bible says where two or
[36:28] three are gathered in my name I will be
[36:30] in their midst and so that's all we
[36:32] needed he managed just me and God is the
[36:35] majority man and so we just look to him
[36:38] this morning that he'll just speak to us
[36:39] through his word
[36:41] amen amen the Bible says this and the
[36:46] angel said unto her fear not Mary for
[36:50] thou has found favor with God
[36:54] isn't that wonderful and behold thou
[36:56] shalt conceive in thy womb and bring
[36:58] forth the son and shall call his name
[37:01] Jesus and he shall be great he should be
[37:05] called the son of the highest the Lord
[37:08] God shall give unto him the throne of
[37:10] his father David he shall reign over the
[37:13] house of Jacob forever and of his
[37:15] kingdom there shall be no end that's the
[37:19] kingdom I want to belong to this morning
[37:21] then said Mary under the angel how shall
[37:24] this be seeing I know not a man and the
[37:28] angel answered and said unto her the
[37:29] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[37:32] power of the highest shall overshadow
[37:34] thee therefore also that holy thing
[37:37] which shall be born to be shall be
[37:40] called the Son of God and behold that
[37:42] cousin Elizabeth also conceived a son in
[37:45] her old age this is the six-month with
[37:48] her who was called barren I love the
[37:52] scripture right here for with God
[37:54] nothing shall be impossible hey man and
[38:01] Mary said Behold the handmaid of the
[38:03] Lord be it unto me according to thy word
[38:07] and the Bible says and the angel
[38:10] departed from her
[38:13] you see when Mary received the angel's
[38:15] message then the angel departed from her
[38:19] amen let's bow our heads I want to speak
[38:22] to you this morning or just a simple
[38:24] thought of it's me
[38:26] it's me Heavenly Father we greet these
[38:33] people this morning in the lovely name
[38:35] of the Lord Jesus father we bow in the
[38:39] presence of that great name
[38:42] knowing Lord that heavens and earth will
[38:44] pass away yet your word shall never fail
[38:48] Lord the promises of your word are just
[38:50] as true today as they were when you
[38:53] spoke them Lord are there situations in
[38:57] kingdoms and times and people's unbelief
[38:59] will never hinder thy word from being
[39:02] fulfilled Lord or you said it would not
[39:04] return unto you void but will to
[39:07] accomplish that which it was sent to do
[39:09] the Lord we believe that the prophet of
[39:11] God has come in this hour and he told us
[39:14] Lord we become the word as we receive
[39:16] the word it's the word becoming flesh
[39:19] and the flesh becoming word oh God may
[39:23] we hold these promises true in our
[39:25] hearts dear God knowing Lord you will
[39:28] bring him swiftly the past bless you
[39:31] people today Lord opened the Bible to us
[39:34] dear God for Lord we know any man can
[39:37] open the Bible and read but only you
[39:39] Lord can quicken it Lord and give us the
[39:42] divine revelation and interpretation of
[39:44] your word father may it not just be
[39:47] hearers of the word as James said but
[39:49] may we be doers of that which we hear
[39:52] Lord may we take it into our hearts and
[39:54] speak it back up on our lips for you
[39:56] said their God through your prophet when
[39:59] the son of God my faith takes the Word
[40:01] of God into his heart speaks it back
[40:03] upon his lips it's just the same as
[40:05] deity speaking every mountain has to
[40:08] move o God do great things among us
[40:11] today Lord we pray may we leave Lord
[40:14] with a greater unction and the greater
[40:15] zeal and a greater desire and a greater
[40:17] revelation because you have met with us
[40:20] today bless the people here father God
[40:24] may your anointing Lord use them a signs
[40:26] and wonders be rolled at the hands of
[40:28] the believers father where this is the
[40:30] hour of the manifestation of the third
[40:32] pool these are the things you said you
[40:34] would do in your bride God we believe
[40:37] Lord we are a part of that by grace but
[40:39] we ask these sayings
[40:40] Jesus name and the bride says hey man
[40:44] god bless you you may be seated
[40:47] amen I want to start with this morning
[40:50] with a little quote and kind of just
[40:51] build of what we want to look at for a
[40:53] few minutes of the Lord I help us but
[40:55] the brother BAM says this he says now
[40:57] notice when Israel began to cry for
[41:00] their deliverance and God began to hear
[41:04] and provided a way of escape and sent
[41:08] Moses to them so here we see Israel
[41:12] begin to cry for deliverance and God
[41:16] heard their cry for the livers and
[41:19] provided a way of escape he sent to them
[41:23] Moses and the prophets said how strange
[41:26] it was after crying for deliverance and
[41:29] when deliverance was brought to them
[41:32] they failed to recognize it and refused
[41:37] it and had to suffer forty years more
[41:42] forty more years they suffered in
[41:45] bondage before they realized that the
[41:48] limits that they had salt the delivers
[41:51] that they had desired the deliverance
[41:53] that they had cried for forty more years
[41:56] they suffered in bondage because they
[41:59] failed to recognize it had already been
[42:02] given so what do we learn from this what
[42:07] we learn from this is no matter how
[42:09] great the revelation is no matter how
[42:13] rich the anointing is no matter how
[42:16] great the gift would be that God would
[42:19] send among us if we don't recognize it's
[42:24] for you it will do you no good the Bible
[42:29] said I am the Lord that God that healeth
[42:31] thee but if you don't have the
[42:33] understanding that that word is speaking
[42:36] to you it'll do you no good if you don't
[42:40] recognize that this word is for me all
[42:45] the great revelations all the greater
[42:47] north no matter how great the man would
[42:49] be that God would send among us if we
[42:52] don't realize it's for me
[42:55] it's me the word is speaking of me
[43:00] you see we're living in an hour of
[43:03] identification many year ago when I was
[43:05] a young man started traveling preaching
[43:08] I didn't have to show identification to
[43:10] get on a plane I just got my ticket at
[43:12] the counter and went and got on the
[43:14] plane but now we're living in the hour
[43:15] that you have to be identified everybody
[43:20] has to be identified with who they are
[43:23] amen and so we're living in the hour of
[43:27] identification now the Prophet said in
[43:30] the message perfect faith that faith is
[43:33] based on forgiveness faith is based on
[43:39] forgiveness before you can ever have
[43:41] faith in the Word of God you must first
[43:44] believe that the word is for you you see
[43:48] the revival your revival is when you
[43:51] recognize the word is speaking of you
[43:55] we're living in this hour of
[43:57] identification then we must also have a
[44:00] scriptural identification and our
[44:03] scriptural identification must be found
[44:06] in the Word of God because the word body
[44:09] must be built upon a word frame can you
[44:12] say amen to that they may so then I
[44:15] revival would be when we see ourselves
[44:18] identified in the Word of God when you
[44:22] look into the pages of the Bible and you
[44:24] say it's me the word is speaking of me
[44:28] now love is addition of Christ in the
[44:32] church Christ is now in the church
[44:34] recognizing reconciling the people to
[44:37] God he promised to do it it's been
[44:39] written and he's the same yesterday
[44:40] today and forever II said do you believe
[44:43] that he said I believe it with all my
[44:44] heart he's just now waiting to be called
[44:47] on the scene now the only thing that can
[44:50] call him on the scene is for us to
[44:52] awaken him in ourselves to call him on
[44:56] the scene amen now the Prophet talked
[44:59] about the Welsh revival you remember
[45:01] that a buncha man from the United States
[45:03] went over the West and they wanted to
[45:05] see this revival they wanted to know
[45:08] what God was doing they wanted to
[45:10] experience the Welsh revival and so they
[45:14] see a policeman standing on the street
[45:16] corner and they won't get to the
[45:20] policeman he was singing a song he was
[45:23] whistling a tune but would you to notice
[45:27] they never went to the policeman to get
[45:29] directions to the Welsh revival because
[45:32] he was a policeman they went up to the
[45:35] policeman to get directions to the
[45:37] revival because they heard him whistling
[45:40] a Christian song and they gave to the
[45:44] policeman they said sir were from the
[45:46] United States and we've heard of this
[45:48] great revival and we want to experience
[45:51] the revival can you tell us where is the
[45:55] Welsh revival
[45:59] he never gave him a GPS location
[46:02] he never said don't do blood turn right
[46:05] or left behind the library there's a
[46:07] little bit he never said that but when
[46:10] they said sir we want to see the Welsh
[46:13] revival you know what he said you're
[46:15] looking at it the words revival it's me
[46:19] it's me I am the world's revival Oh God
[46:26] if we can only understand that today
[46:28] that we are the reflection of Jesus
[46:30] Christ His Word made manifest
[46:33] you are the reflection of his word what
[46:36] is the world's revival what building is
[46:38] it in is it sure it's in my heart he was
[46:44] the Welsh revival and today the brother
[46:48] said today that the church ought to be
[46:52] Jesus Christ manifested in flesh Christ
[46:56] in action in his people not just a bunch
[46:58] of quotas no there's let the road with
[47:02] quote but it's more than quote that
[47:04] God's looking for more than just
[47:06] somebody that oh but he's looking for
[47:08] somebody who can take the word Howard
[47:11] and make that word live
[47:14] the message of the hours more than quote
[47:17] books though we thank God for quote
[47:19] books the message of the hour is more
[47:21] the tapes though we thank God for tapes
[47:24] but the message of the hour of God's
[47:26] coming for is not my Bible not my tape
[47:29] player but he's coming for me amen
[47:32] because the word has been made fresh in
[47:35] my heart
[47:36] amen hallelujah see God don't need my
[47:40] ability God don't need my education
[47:43] thank God cuz ain't got much but what
[47:45] God does need is my skin amen
[47:50] you see God wants turkey knows God won't
[47:52] stay empty himself into us all God was
[47:56] important to Christ and all Christ is he
[47:58] has poured into the church Christ as the
[48:02] mystery of God revealed but the bride is
[48:04] the revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[48:09] hallelujah what are we the branch the
[48:13] branch another book of Acts
[48:17] amen amen he was so full of the Wealth's
[48:21] revival till he was the Welsh revival
[48:23] and we ought to be so full of Christ do
[48:26] we reflect him in the power of the word
[48:29] that's allotted for us in this game
[48:31] amen do you love you miss water we're
[48:34] supposed to be the light of this age
[48:36] manifesting the gospel Luther was the
[48:38] light in this day Wesley was the light
[48:40] in their day Pentecost was light in
[48:42] their day
[48:43] let were further up the road now we're
[48:46] coming into the bride we're coming into
[48:48] the called out the elected the probably
[48:50] said remember if you are you're just
[48:54] like that officer he had he need him and
[48:57] if you're the bride Oh God if you're the
[49:01] caught out if you're the elect if you're
[49:04] the one he likes you come to find yes
[49:07] you've got it in you
[49:10] it's who you are friends you see the
[49:13] bride's revival is the opening of the
[49:15] work that stirs her for she sees her
[49:17] position for the word in the hour you
[49:20] see I will to understand this one we're
[49:22] not just part of the move we are the
[49:24] move some touches the revelation in the
[49:28] word and she cries it's me the word is
[49:33] speaking of me you see the seven
[49:35] churches it's God dealing with the
[49:37] church that's what it's called Church
[49:39] Aegeus but this is the last stage so
[49:43] whatever God's going to do in these
[49:45] people you see if no God wanted to do
[49:47] what's in the profit we would have done
[49:49] rapture because the profit is coming
[49:52] down so there must be something else God
[49:56] wants to do in this hour more than give
[49:58] a revelation of the coming of Elijah
[50:02] brother Branham played his part but now
[50:04] you've got to play your part
[50:07] hey man hallelujah so the seven churches
[50:11] is God dealing with the church whatever
[50:14] he's going to do he must do it in those
[50:17] seven ages amen because when the church
[50:21] ages is he will never call another
[50:24] Gentile can you say man it makes sure
[50:27] then we see whatever God must be do
[50:29] because now we're here and because his
[50:31] was in the homeland waiting to receive
[50:33] the Messiah but before they can ever
[50:35] receive the Messiah he's got to pull the
[50:38] bride off the earth so whatever he's
[50:41] going to do to accomplish his word at
[50:43] the end time he must do it where he must
[50:46] do it in you he must do it with he must
[50:51] do it with people
[50:53] Amen because what did he use the first
[50:55] church age people what did he use in the
[50:57] second church age people then what will
[51:00] he use in the last stage people
[51:02] amen amen hallelujah you see the key to
[51:08] the whole thing is to fall in love to
[51:12] fall in love with Jesus
[51:15] huh let's see how much we can know
[51:18] though we should study the word you
[51:20] understand what I'm saying but you know
[51:22] I know a man one time could quote the
[51:24] but you could start a scripture he could
[51:26] finish it no matter where it was that in
[51:29] the Bible you can open up your Bible
[51:30] turn your scripture he'll finish that
[51:32] scripture and the man didn't even serve
[51:35] the Lord so it's not just what we know
[51:38] with our head it's not how much we can
[51:40] quote it's not how much we can memorize
[51:42] if I fall out that window I'll be back
[51:46] amen it's that's no but it's having a
[51:49] relationship with Christ it's not how
[51:54] much we can know that we should know it
[51:56] it's not a mess we can quote though we
[51:58] should quote it but how much can we love
[52:00] you see the oil will know that we're
[52:03] Christians not not how much we quote but
[52:05] the way we'll know that we're Christians
[52:07] by I love God is love when you love
[52:11] right everything else falls into place
[52:15] love produces confidence confidence
[52:18] produces trust amen
[52:21] faith cometh by hearing hearing is not
[52:25] faith but faith cometh by hearing you
[52:29] understand I was just in first two weeks
[52:32] ago and after service the people came up
[52:34] they were excited and they were trying
[52:36] to talk to me I heard every word they
[52:39] said but I never heard nothing they said
[52:41] because they spoke so they didn't
[52:44] understand for each though I heard them
[52:46] I did not understand but are
[52:49] your ears a mess for you hear what's
[52:52] being said in this hour we're not
[52:55] earning on no tongue we not heard a
[52:57] thunder we weren't a voice oh boy the
[53:01] god I feel like how do we get excited
[53:05] where I'm from zone if I take off run
[53:07] and sit still I'll be back
[53:09] amen glory to God hallelujah thank imma
[53:15] be hearing hearing by the Word of God
[53:17] when you trust in what the word is
[53:20] saying to you see you'll find whether
[53:24] there's a lack of the SAR to forgive
[53:25] you'll find there's a lack of love
[53:29] people do things and say things to one
[53:32] another there's no remorse cuz there's
[53:34] no love amen
[53:38] and where there's no love there's no
[53:40] forgiveness and where there's no
[53:42] forgiveness there's no faith for faith
[53:45] is based on forgiveness that all right
[53:52] so the Prophet said we're living in the
[53:54] hour that the Lord would be so far away
[53:57] in the last days that the only lip that
[54:00] would be left would be between the elect
[54:04] of God's people friends that's the hour
[54:07] that we're living in we're living in the
[54:10] hour herself love has took the place of
[54:13] the true love of God the Prophet said it
[54:15] would be that way Southworth people
[54:18] loving their self more that's the age
[54:22] were living in that's why in 2013 the
[54:25] word of the year you know every year
[54:28] Webster's or Oxford Dictionary they pick
[54:31] a word want one and early on the
[54:32] European side of the earth and one on
[54:34] this side of there a word that most
[54:36] reflects the people one word to
[54:41] represent the entire of the on the
[54:44] Western and the eastern sides of the
[54:46] world but in 2013 because of the
[54:50] increase of this one word they chose
[54:53] this one word to represent the entire
[54:56] world and that worked selfie selfie if
[55:07] you look at our pictures my family
[55:09] pictures of my wife and their girls when
[55:11] my girls were small you'll think my wife
[55:13] was the winner because I'm not in the
[55:16] picture
[55:17] there's my wife there's my girl says my
[55:20] wife there's my girls where's where's
[55:22] brother Dale I was taking the picture
[55:25] but not anymore now we got a selfie
[55:28] stick but you see it's the spirit of the
[55:32] age finish do you know there's actually
[55:34] workshops that you can go to three-day
[55:37] workshops to learn to love yourself
[55:41] because it's the
[55:43] the age this is where we are at friends
[55:47] amen amen
[55:52] love would be so far away the only love
[55:54] left would be between the elect you see
[55:56] well there's love there's forgiveness
[55:58] Jesus expressed that on the cross when
[56:01] his blood was poured out like water and
[56:03] they beat him until his face was marred
[56:05] more than any man's face had ever been
[56:07] Lord and yet he looked upon those who
[56:11] done that to him and he loved them and
[56:15] he said Father forgive him for when
[56:18] there's love there's forgiveness Joseph
[56:21] looked upon his brothers who sold him
[56:23] into slavery threw him in a pit but he
[56:26] looked upon them and he forgave them
[56:28] because he loved them thank you brother
[56:31] he forgave him because he loved him
[56:35] think of it this morning for his the
[56:38] Bible said that while we were yet
[56:40] sinners Christ died for us he reached
[56:44] out in the muck and he lifted us up and
[56:47] he loved us we who were unlovable yeah
[56:51] he loved me think of it Christ
[56:54] passed over millions to touch you to
[56:58] show you that he loved you then we gonna
[57:01] have confidence in what His Word says if
[57:04] he let me enough to die for me then he
[57:06] loves me enough to heal me he loves me
[57:08] enough to save me he loves me enough to
[57:10] talk for me hallelujah if he's healthy
[57:13] enough to suffer for me a man then that
[57:18] genuine love produces confidence the
[57:22] confidence that he's forgiving me
[57:24] and when I realized that I'm forgiven
[57:27] what does that produce faith for faith
[57:30] is based upon forgiveness they made a
[57:33] face and what the word says I am oh yeah
[57:38] what the word says I am by the blood of
[57:41] the Lamb of God amen
[57:46] where I've got so many faults I've got
[57:49] so many fell I do too I do too but the
[57:54] figure that it is he don't see me
[57:56] he sees the blood and the bread is
[57:59] perfect then I can have faith in what
[58:05] the word says I am by the blood of Jesus
[58:08] it's not based on emotion not based on
[58:11] sensation there's days I don't feel
[58:13] saved just like you those days I don't
[58:16] feel healed just like you but I'm not
[58:18] here because I feel like it I'm not
[58:19] saying because after I'm saved because I
[58:22] met God's requirements over you see we
[58:27] was like the eagle that was in the
[58:29] barnyard
[58:29] we tried to walk like a chicken cook
[58:31] like the chicken eat like a chicken
[58:33] because that's what we thought we were
[58:35] when we had staff that's all we ever saw
[58:38] was chicken but momma remembered that
[58:40] she had a little one and she began to
[58:43] fly and she flew over the burger and she
[58:46] let out a scream and when she had the
[58:49] voice with junior heard the voice he
[58:52] thought what did he see he saw the wings
[58:56] he saw her talons he saw imagistic head
[58:59] he looked at that and he looked at
[59:01] himself he looked at that and he looked
[59:03] at himself and he said it's me it's me
[59:11] that's who I am and I found out I'm not
[59:17] the son of Charles and Ella Brennan but
[59:20] I'm a son of God I'm an attribute of God
[59:24] you see Jesus had perfect faith amen
[59:28] he had perfect faith how why because he
[59:32] realized what he was he knew he was
[59:38] loved of the Father and he relied and
[59:41] known he was the word and he had faith
[59:45] in the God who made him the word you see
[59:50] he knew what he was there for he relied
[59:53] upon what God had made him he recognized
[59:56] himself in the written word he willing
[59:59] to the temple on the seventh day as it
[1:00:00] was custom and the priest hadn't even
[1:00:02] screw either submit I you know I didn't
[1:00:04] law school preachers more than a s'mizza
[1:00:07] sing a few more so let me see if I can
[1:00:09] something here ain't God doesn't
[1:00:11] prepared he never done that but the
[1:00:13] priest had him screwing the Bible said
[1:00:15] he found the place it was written
[1:00:17] concerning who himself and he said he
[1:00:21] had the boy did me and he closed the
[1:00:25] book kind of get back to the priest and
[1:00:27] the eyes of all the people in the temple
[1:00:29] was on him and he began to say this
[1:00:31] death scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:00:34] ears
[1:00:35] if you allow me to give a hillbilly
[1:00:36] translation what he really said was it's
[1:00:39] me hallelujah
[1:00:41] it's me the Lord has become flesh oh he
[1:00:48] resided knowing what he was he was the
[1:00:51] word and had faith in the God who made
[1:00:53] him the word thing can't we rely upon
[1:00:56] what God made us what did God make us
[1:00:59] believers the word says the believer
[1:01:03] shall lay their hands upon the sick and
[1:01:05] they shall recover these signs shall
[1:01:08] follow them that believe
[1:01:13] are you believer or you believer then
[1:01:17] who's he talking about it's all about
[1:01:20] you
[1:01:21] your national fellow down at home I said
[1:01:24] so we won't ask you a question he said
[1:01:26] alrighty ask away said sir
[1:01:29] why are you a believer it's a lot cz I
[1:01:32] believe he said well but we understand
[1:01:38] that but why do you believe oh that's
[1:01:42] easy I believe because I'm a believer
[1:01:46] certainly understand we understand that
[1:01:49] you're a believer but what we're trying
[1:01:51] to find out is why are you a believer oh
[1:01:56] that's easy because I believe believers
[1:02:02] believe that's why they're called
[1:02:05] believers do you believe do you believe
[1:02:09] you're not sure yet do you believe if
[1:02:12] you believe that who's the scripture
[1:02:14] talking about these signs shall follow
[1:02:16] them that mean that's the Word of God
[1:02:22] yet faith in what he was just a this
[1:02:26] simple three days I raised him how can
[1:02:28] he say that how could anybody say such a
[1:02:30] thing as that because the Lord said that
[1:02:33] he was only saying what the word said he
[1:02:39] knew David wasn't speaking about himself
[1:02:40] David's all corruption Freddy knew David
[1:02:43] hallelujah I'm the man of 19 were
[1:02:46] speaking of him he was famous of what
[1:02:50] David spoke Oh God let that cook into us
[1:02:53] this morning to recognize herself in the
[1:02:56] scriptures to be able to say it's me the
[1:03:00] word is speaking of me now brother Ben
[1:03:03] who told several different times of the
[1:03:05] story of the little boy who saw himself
[1:03:08] in a mirror now why do you reckon he
[1:03:11] told us that story you ever thought
[1:03:15] about that
[1:03:16] you reckon Billy Paul come to you say no
[1:03:18] daddy you know we know you like to save
[1:03:19] money and you you know you want to take
[1:03:21] care of God's money in it and you're
[1:03:23] leaving twenty thirty minutes left on
[1:03:25] tapers or some kind of story you can
[1:03:27] tell to kind of fill up some tape space
[1:03:29] I don't believe that I believe if
[1:03:33] brother Brian was telling us the story
[1:03:34] of a little boy in a mirror it was
[1:03:37] something he wanted us to understand can
[1:03:41] you say Amanda there I don't think he
[1:03:43] just told it to be telling this but
[1:03:44] there's something there he wanted us to
[1:03:47] understand amen
[1:03:50] now he told the story I got the looking
[1:03:52] how many times he told it in the last
[1:03:54] three times that he told it it just
[1:03:56] really struck me he told the story in
[1:03:59] the message identification 63 then he
[1:04:05] told it again in 1964 in the message
[1:04:08] things that are to be and the last time
[1:04:12] the Prophet ever spoke this story was in
[1:04:15] 1965 in a message titled leadership ito
[1:04:21] the story he comes down to his
[1:04:23] grandmother's house never saw a mirror
[1:04:26] before in his life and on the back of
[1:04:27] the door there was a mirror and the boy
[1:04:30] was kind of lonesome you know now trying
[1:04:32] to find something to do and he
[1:04:33] shut the door and all of a sudden there
[1:04:35] was a mirror and he looked in the mirror
[1:04:38] there was a little boy so he tried to
[1:04:43] make friends with the little fella
[1:04:45] because he was lonely though oh that's
[1:04:47] some money to play with
[1:04:48] so he waved and the boy way back and he
[1:04:54] grinned and the boy greenback he made a
[1:04:57] funny face and the boy made a funny face
[1:04:59] and he kept getting closer and the
[1:05:02] puppet said his mom and his grandma was
[1:05:04] watching him and he got closer and
[1:05:07] closer and finally he touched the mini
[1:05:10] jib back
[1:05:10] is it my mother it's me it was him the
[1:05:19] whole time it was here the whole time
[1:05:23] he just recognized it he just talked the
[1:05:27] revelation the boy in the mirror is me
[1:05:33] and the problem said that's what we want
[1:05:35] to do tonight I want to look at me and I
[1:05:37] want you to look at yourself as we look
[1:05:39] into God's great mirror of his word
[1:05:41] let's be able to identify ourselves with
[1:05:44] son that we're going to speak about some
[1:05:47] of the characters of other times I want
[1:05:49] to see myself in God's looking-glass
[1:05:52] because if anything will show you where
[1:05:54] you're standing
[1:05:55] it's this book he said I'm sure we ought
[1:05:59] to find ourselves in some character of
[1:06:03] the Bible we ought to be able to find
[1:06:07] ourselves and some character of the
[1:06:09] Bible so that we would know the outcome
[1:06:11] of that character then we would know
[1:06:13] what our outcome would be think about
[1:06:19] this we can look at that character and
[1:06:21] whatever the outcome would be we would
[1:06:23] know that would be our outcome
[1:06:26] I'm sure tonight we ought to find
[1:06:30] herself somewhere in some character of
[1:06:33] the Bible then we know the outcome of
[1:06:35] that character and then you know what
[1:06:37] your outcome would be by knowing their
[1:06:39] outcome we would know our outcome
[1:06:42] and I thought did anybody ever really do
[1:06:45] that has anybody ever really done what
[1:06:49] the Prophet said who somebody looked
[1:06:51] into a character of the Bible and
[1:06:53] identified herself with that character
[1:06:55] and said their outcome should be mild
[1:06:57] good and I got to looking and I found it
[1:07:03] the black woman down in Memphis her son
[1:07:06] had got out and got a social disease and
[1:07:08] he was dying of syphilis and she got
[1:07:11] down to pray and she said Lord I was
[1:07:13] like the shoot-'em-up woman I couldn't
[1:07:15] have a son but you gave me a son and I
[1:07:19] tried to raise him the best of knew how
[1:07:21] Lord but he's got out and he's got this
[1:07:23] disease and he's dying and she said Lord
[1:07:26] if I'd be like the shooter might woman
[1:07:28] where is your Elijah and the portly was
[1:07:33] in an airplane headed towards Lexington
[1:07:35] Kentucky in other words I don't know
[1:07:38] exactly what happened but we'll just say
[1:07:40] perhaps this happened that they were
[1:07:43] flying along and all of a sudden the
[1:07:45] light come on in the cockpit and the
[1:07:47] captain turns to the co captain says see
[1:07:50] what the light is and he opens up the
[1:07:52] manual and he looks at it and he's in
[1:07:56] land immediately where's the closest
[1:07:59] airport Memphis Tennessee Oh God how
[1:08:03] about the Hubble spell they landed the
[1:08:05] plane and Memphis put the prophet up in
[1:08:07] the Peabody Hotel the next morning he
[1:08:08] goes out the melon postcard and the Holy
[1:08:12] Spirit says stop turn around start
[1:08:14] walking now he had to catch a plane but
[1:08:18] he was obedient to the Spirit of God and
[1:08:22] he was walking and he found himself in
[1:08:23] the black neighborhood and he was
[1:08:25] singing I'm one of them and as he's
[1:08:27] walking down the road singing I'm one of
[1:08:29] them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[1:08:31] them there she stood by the gate she had
[1:08:34] a shirt tile around her head her back
[1:08:36] was wet from the do and when he came
[1:08:39] walking by she said morning parson and
[1:08:43] he says parson how did you know I was a
[1:08:46] preacher
[1:08:46] she said not only that's her I know
[1:08:48] she's coming
[1:08:50] since you're supposed to have a satchel
[1:08:53] where's your satchel he said I left it
[1:08:56] in the room now for people who believe
[1:08:58] not only speaks to prophets who told her
[1:09:01] that come on somebody she knew more
[1:09:04] about what was happening than he did it
[1:09:07] wasn't him telling her it was her
[1:09:10] telling him and you know the story the
[1:09:18] probably we need to pray for the boy and
[1:09:20] God raised the ball up why she
[1:09:23] identified herself with some character
[1:09:25] in the Bible and the outcome of God
[1:09:27] given her that boy was the same outcome
[1:09:29] she experienced earlier Jeremiah 29:11
[1:09:33] says this I know the thoughts I think
[1:09:35] toward you says the Lord thoughts of
[1:09:38] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:09:40] expected end the amplified version of
[1:09:43] that scripture says I know the thoughts
[1:09:45] and plans I have for you says the Lord
[1:09:47] thoughts and plans of welfare and peace
[1:09:49] and not for evil to give you hope in
[1:09:52] your final outcome you've already got a
[1:09:55] final outcome God already hoga God

[1:12:18] what you're suffering right now you were
[1:12:20] there in his thinking you're naming all
[1:12:22] in he by foreknowledge ordained you to

[1:12:27] Prophet said and if you're not ordained
[1:12:31] you'll never see it if you're not
[1:12:33] ordained you'll never see it but I ask
[1:12:35] you of all the people in Akron Ohio
[1:12:37] there was more at the restaurant last
[1:12:39] night than they are here all the people
[1:12:42] that why are you here why are you here
[1:12:47] don't let the devil beat you up put him
[1:12:50] in his place
[1:12:51] you're here because God ordains you to
[1:12:53] be here
[1:12:55] amen we're here because we see these
[1:12:58] things this feeds my soul
[1:13:00] hey CDC don't feed my soul Alice Cooper
[1:13:03] don't feed my soul all these other they
[1:13:05] don't feed my soul but the Word of God

[1:13:16] are not will never seen just be kind to
[1:13:18] him just love them but they'll never see
[1:13:20] it but the Prophet said remember in the
[1:13:23] name of the Lord Jesus the hour is here
[1:13:25] the hour is here to do what brother
[1:13:27] brother the hour is here to see these
[1:13:30] things let me ask the stuff there where
[1:13:36] was the mysteries of God hid where were
[1:13:38] they hid all down through the ages the
[1:13:40] mysteries of God where he had where he
[1:13:42] kept them in his mind
[1:13:44] Moses was able to go back to the
[1:13:46] beginning that's as far as he could go
[1:13:48] when he started writing he wrote in the
[1:13:50] beginning you know why that's as far
[1:13:52] back as he could go but we're living in
[1:13:53] the hour that God had another prophet
[1:13:55] and he allowed that prophet to go beyond
[1:13:57] the beginning into the mind of God and
[1:14:01] bring these things out and make these
[1:14:04] things known to us why for thousands of
[1:14:07] years of God keeping the mystery within
[1:14:09] himself why would he all of a sudden
[1:14:11] make it known it would has to be because
[1:14:13] of people who own the earth who can
[1:14:16] receive those mysteries hallelujah amen
[1:14:21] brother Smith loves his kids he loves
[1:14:23] his kids but would you give that little
[1:14:25] girl the keys to the car tell her to go
[1:14:27] and get your soda they know away she's
[1:14:29] not able to handle the keys she may play
[1:14:33] with them in the nursery but she'll
[1:14:35] never put them in the ignition unless
[1:14:38] you were to call allstate and tell them
[1:14:39] you got an accident on your hands you
[1:14:41] know what I'm saying she's not able to
[1:14:43] handle the key in the ignition
[1:14:45] but as they mature there come a day
[1:14:47] we'll get the boy the car to go to the
[1:14:50] market don't you see the mysteries of
[1:14:52] God was in his mind but now they're made
[1:14:54] known why for some people on the earth
[1:14:56] whose return by the world who can take
[1:15:00] the things that are said who can look at
[1:15:02] the mysteries and say it's me it's me
[1:15:07] hallelujah the word mirror reveals to us
[1:15:11] our word image like the little boy we
[1:15:13] look into the mirror and we say it's me
[1:15:16] it's me that moment that you recognize
[1:15:20] yourself that you
[1:15:23] you are in the vision when you see their
[1:15:30] image in the mirror of his word when you
[1:15:32] realize your the expression of his
[1:15:34] thought you're a part of the vision
[1:15:37] however you want to say God had a dream
[1:15:40] and you was in it
[1:15:42] God had a vision however you want to say
[1:15:44] whatever adjectives if I don't that's
[1:15:46] the right word or not I told you ain't
[1:15:47] took smart but whatever words you want
[1:15:49] to put together to express that can we
[1:15:52] understand that this morning that God
[1:15:54] dreamed the dream and I am what he
[1:15:57] dreamed God had a thought
[1:15:59] I'm the expression of it God had a
[1:16:01] program I'm a part of it God had a
[1:16:03] painting I'm in it however you want to
[1:16:06] look at it if you can see that this
[1:16:08] morning that moment that you realize I
[1:16:11] am a part of the vision is that possible
[1:16:17] can a son and daughter of God actually
[1:16:21] see their self in the vision can you see
[1:16:26] yourself and the vision if I show you
[1:16:34] what yeah man it don't lie now you're in
[1:16:37] church prayer line 1953 Wilmes seems to
[1:16:43] be going for me she's in a hospital or a

[1:19:55] because the woman was in that meeting
[1:19:58] and when he broke into that room he saw
[1:20:00] a vision of that meeting in Portland
[1:20:03] Oregon

[1:20:05] himself on the platform and he said it's

[1:20:49] and he would you tell me about the green
[1:20:51] checkered shirt and he said brother down
[1:20:53] said I will tell you he said a month
[1:20:55] before that happened brother Brennan
[1:20:58] called me about coming up there and
[1:21:00] hunting and he told me the vision on the
[1:21:03] phone he said brother doll it meant
[1:21:06] nothing
[1:21:07] to me it was just another vision that he
[1:21:10] had he said brother Eddie he said
[1:21:13] brother now he told me the vision on the
[1:21:16] phone
[1:21:17] I'm not before it happened but it meant
[1:21:20] nothing to me

[1:21:24] a part of it
[1:21:25] it was just a vision but you know the
[1:21:29] story he goes hunting he gets up that
[1:21:30] morning he's going across the log he

[1:21:50] shot the caribou and they measured
[1:21:52] across the horns and it was 42 inches
[1:21:54] and brother Brennan said enough somebody
[1:21:57] should have a green checkered why

[1:23:07] reality it'll change the very atoms of

[1:23:17] clocks roamers let's hurry amen
[1:23:20] a team that any trifling take that air

[1:23:27] hour late
[1:23:27] yeah you're right hey hallelujah now
[1:23:33] let's just look at a scripture will
[1:23:35] close the prophet of God said you know
[1:23:38] brother man no my kid could bring these
[1:23:40] things out like good Murph said the day
[1:23:43] before this event took place he said
[1:23:46] Mary and Joseph were sitting on the
[1:23:47] porch between services you know and he
[1:23:50] pray that a little drum and he said you
[1:23:52] know said Mary said Oh Joseph said
[1:23:53] wasn't the rabbi's spot on this morning
[1:23:56] maja wasn't that a message he said oh
[1:23:58] I've never heard such preaching I can't
[1:24:00] marry it was tremendous so they sent her
[1:24:03] said you know Joseph said what do you
[1:24:05] want to do they said let's just read a
[1:24:07] few scriptures it says all
[1:24:11] that's wonderful Mara she said I'll go
[1:24:13] get him it probably should go down and
[1:24:15] henna a stand like an umbrella stand and
[1:24:16] they they put the scrolls down in that
[1:24:18] stand and she just reaches in and pulls
[1:24:20] one out but you see the footsteps of the
[1:24:22] righteous or ordered of the Lord she
[1:24:24] just reaches into all these folks she
[1:24:26] pulls one out she comes out on the porch
[1:24:27] she gives it to Joseph Joseph opens it
[1:24:30] up and he begins to read from Isaiah a
[1:24:32] virgin shall conceive and as he's
[1:24:36] reading the scriptures Mary begins to
[1:24:39] hear the word and Joseph said Joseph
[1:24:44] Abba said Mary said the Zap scripture
[1:24:46] means something to you said I notice
[1:24:49] ever since I started reading it that's
[1:24:52] just a glow about you said I always
[1:24:54] thought she's the prettiest woman in the
[1:24:55] valley but my you're even prettier now
[1:25:02] so what is that she said Joseph what did
[1:25:05] I say of me what did he mean a virgin
[1:25:11] shall conceive Joseph I said yes he gave
[1:25:17] her a profound answer to her question
[1:25:21] Joseph and he said dear I don't know I
[1:25:27] don't know I don't know what the Prophet
[1:25:30] meant but there's one thing I do know
[1:25:33] that if God spoke it it will come to
[1:25:36] pass I don't have to understand it if
[1:25:39] God said it would happen it would happen
[1:25:42] I don't understand all the ins and outs
[1:25:45] do you I don't understand
[1:25:46] I don't know how God made my daughter
[1:25:48] walking in which she was crippled in the
[1:25:50] accident they said she'd never walk
[1:25:51] again she'd never stand up I don't know
[1:25:53] how God done that I don't know how God
[1:25:55] opened her blinded eyes which she
[1:25:57] couldn't see in the doctor said you'd
[1:25:58] never see again there's nothing to see
[1:26:00] with the whole back of her brain was
[1:26:02] dead from the stroke I don't know how he
[1:26:04] made her see I don't have to understand
[1:26:06] how a big God keeps his word he's all
[1:26:15] there he can do anything that he says he
[1:26:18] will do
[1:26:18] God will keep his word she was going
[1:26:24] home unnie the Prophet said it was a
[1:26:26] blue wash day if she was going alone
[1:26:28] thinking about these scriptures thinking
[1:26:30] about the prophet of God said it's when
[1:26:31] you think about him that's what he
[1:26:33] appears we think so much about our
[1:26:35] troubles we think so much about our woes
[1:26:36] but if we spend our time thinking about
[1:26:38] Jesus when the two on the road to Emmaus
[1:26:41] when I was thinking about Jesus that's
[1:26:42] when he stepped out and started walking
[1:26:44] with whom she was thinking about these

[1:33:09] express it it's the spoken word age what
[1:33:12] does the Bible say let the redeemed of
[1:33:14] the Lord say so say so not not her head
[1:33:19] not raise her hand though there's
[1:33:20] nothing wrong with that I'm not kicking
[1:33:21] against that but the Bible says let the
[1:33:23] redeemed of the Lord say so why there is
[1:33:25] power in a spoken word
[1:33:29] let the redeemed of the Lord say so
[1:33:33] speak it out there is power in the
[1:33:35] tongue for the Bible said out of your
[1:33:38] own mouth you will be justified and out
[1:33:40] of your own mouth
[1:33:41] you will be condemned so brother the

[1:33:56] always be my friend I said I don't have
[1:33:58] to condemn you you'll condemn yourself
[1:34:00] by the words you speak that's true true
[1:34:06] don't put it on me to condemn you
[1:34:08] condemned his ownself
[1:34:09] he's once said it didn't believe it no
[1:34:11] more out of his own mouth he confessed
[1:34:14] it but that's for me in my house I'll

[1:36:30] preach to this scripture in Luke when my
[1:36:33] daughter was hurt in the accident to her
[1:36:34] my families killed struck my train and
[1:36:37] my baby was laying in a hospital room
[1:36:38] doctors gave us no hope of over 75% of
[1:36:40] her brain was damaged in the accident
[1:36:42] and my wife god bless her so
[1:36:46] my wife was kneeling beside the bed of
[1:36:48] our little girl and she was praying she
[1:36:50] was praying to God about our daughter
[1:36:53] and the Lord spoke this scripture here
[1:36:55] in Luke chapter 1 every time I read it
[1:36:57] it just touches my heart she said the
[1:37:01] Lord spoke that scripture she got up and
[1:37:03] opened the Bible and read it and it said
[1:37:05] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:37:13] this is who we are this is what we are
[1:37:18] the Word of God will not return into him
[1:37:21] void it's me it's me I am the dream that
[1:37:27] he dreamed I am the vision that he saw
[1:37:31] he wrote and spoke my name before there
[1:37:36] was ever a world he knows my name he

[1:38:18] vindicate him come on somebody it won't
[1:38:20] be something that they find in a library
[1:38:22] somewhere that I vindicate him but what

[1:38:26] from God it's when we become what he
[1:38:27] said and the Bible said once more of the
[1:38:30] world we're here from God
