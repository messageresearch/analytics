we all know brother cam it'll be preaching for us today we're very thankful it's been a while since we had him but we're very glad to come back we've been shifting the dates I probably shifting the dates to try to get the right timing and I really feel like this is the right timing how many feel the presence of the Lord this morning amen there's just some wonderful worship there we really feel the presence of the Lord you know and I just want to just thank brother cam for his faithful service to the Lord he's just been a real servant to God I really thank God for the cam you know he was the first of all six of us to become a Christian he's the one that said I don't care what anybody else says I'm gonna serve God cam was very pivotal in my life is because of him listening to his Christian music I started making me hunger to be a Christian him he let me borrow his car and it was because of him that I started liking Christian music oh my this is glorious ffh one of these days and cam has just been a tremendous brother you know he I never told this story but in my senior year before I was doing the state championship at the long jump I pulled a muscle and I think cam was a Christian at this point and I was I did awful I barely made it to the final round I was the I was the state champion the year before now I was feeling all sorry for myself I'm all down I barely made the finals cam comes along and he speaks these words to me he's like he's like forget about it you're not injured take off that sleeve he said go out there and win the championship there like it just lit up a fire in me you know I'm like okay I'm gonna do this and I ignored the pain I went and won the championship because cam talked me into it he told me to get my eyes off those don't worry about that he said just go do and then years later in 2010 cam preached a message for us called Lord just once more and after that I was so moved by the Holy Spirit we just saw a string of miracles after that because it just it was such a mighty message of the Holy Spirit that it causes the crowd to more for more of God and God moved in such a tremendous way so I thank the Lord for using our brother God's just helping me a real faithful witness in the point so we very very thank God for that I just want to share that story I never got a chance to share those stories but my brother has been such a wonderful sermon we're so thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ let's say into our feet here I just want to say those nice things about my brother I surely love him he's doing a tremendous job there Napoleon of course it's all by the grace of God we're not I'm not bragging on him or anything like that I'm just saying thank you Lord Jesus for you've done in my brother's life are you grateful for God in your

thing I wouldn't trade it for nothing in the world where we're seated at right now you know even your prophet said he said he said you know which age would you rather live in would you rather live in the in the days of the upper room or or you know go back to Colombo and Martin Luther all these individuals that we would you rather live let me ask you would you rather live in the day of brother branham I'll tell you what there's no better place to be than right here right now oh ma that'll start a fire amen so by God's grace let's go ahead and stand for the reading of the word we'll get right into this very excited about what the Lord's doing I could tell you a lot of testimonies he's proved over and over and over again that this message is 100 percent right don't look at a flesh don't look at anything just look at the word Amen this morning we have a little message for you open up Daniel 9:24 I heard you're your pastor in the past year maybe even recent has preached on the Book of Daniel I'm not necessarily going that direction but I'm gonna just bring a little thing out and then we're gonna run with it after that we'll go to revelations 11:15 how am I know he's here right now it's beyond a shadow of one doubt his words said we're two or more gathered there I am in the midst if he's here how does that change our expectations how does that change the way you're feeling right now are we certain we're certain not a question whatever your need is it's not even a possibility if it could happen if your faith could reach out alright Daniel 9:24 says here says seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy says know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem notice unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore in two weeks the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall must seiyya be cut off but not for himself Oh glory to God aren't you glad he was cut off for you Alleluia bias stripes and the people the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with the flood unto the end of the war desolations are determined now it's moving our Bibles to revelations 1115 been preaching this at home we've had been having a wonderful time and we'll see what the Lord to do this morning I am NOT under obligation to anything that I have in my own mind God's will is sovereign here he knows what you need and I'll tell you what if something inside of you cries out for the word he'll speak to you it's come time we really gonna believe this thing or we're just what are we doing we're just smiles we'll sit back down and lay out to see you huh it's time to believe the word amen revelations 11:15 it says in the seventh angel sounded trumpet angel and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and notice it says and of his Christ notice Lord and his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever amen as our heads forward a prayer will say a prayer and let you have your seats our precious Savior and husband Lord Jesus how we just loved you this morning o God as we're now moving into the the ministering of the word Lord and we just ask O God that you would just take full control of this service O God as as we've just enjoyed such a wonderful worship service o God I know you felt welcome Lord because I know that you were drawing near Lord and we're asking Oh God now as we enter into the word that you touch every heart every soul in this room Oh God God may they see O God that you're speaking to them Lord and may Oh God they pull you down Oh God even in a greater way than where we're at right we believe Oh God if we'd all just come here just setting ourselves aside that oh god you would be magnified in our midst oh god here we all were just all of us Oh God honestly we're just coming down to our post of duty this morning God and we realize oh god that world we're here for more than just a set Sunday morning or Sunday night service and a set Wednesday night but Oh God we're here for more than that Oh God and we're asking Oh God at Lord you would take these these vile bodies in this this carnal flesh and and these these little pest houses that we've been gathered in Oh God and Lord you would come Lord and begin to do a work of transformation in this morning God setting us O God upon your Will O God and revealing to us individually what should have us to do lord I just pray O God is you see what's in front of my face as far as notes Oh God I'm not interested in these notes I'm interested in your notes Oh God you come and speak Oh God and have your way among your people today Oh God raise them up row God for their glory in Jesus Christ and we pray the church says together a men you may be seated may be seated get a little bit of a late start here but by God's grace just hold on with me if you can I'm a preacher a sermon I heard I'll be honest with you I I said Lord why do you want me to preach and I read this quote and then I had a brother just text me out of the blue and he sent me a quote to parallel exactly what I was just reading I said well that's kind of what happens who hath despised the day of small things like I said he's here right now hallelujah now I want to bring forth a little message I believe would be a blessing to you this morning we'll see what the Lord or do but the idea let's just entitle if we can the hidden purpose of the Messiah sign and the hidden purpose of the Messiah kind and then we'll get to our subject matter and our subject matter this morning is Akron's Messiah s and by God's grace we'll see what he'll do with this momentarily notice here working with so to say hidden purpose of the Messiah sign remember we just read that in Daniel 9 there is talking about the 70 weeks of Daniel and I want you to notice there that it actually we kind of highlighted just two portions of the 25th and 26th verse which actually talked about the Messiah right a min and who was that Messiah Jesus Christ was at Messiah a man of that word right there Messiah was capitalized wasn't it amen it was actually looking for more than just a man but it was looking for what God in flesh amen emanuelle to be amongst us right I want you to see this that word Messiah is actually mashiac amen and in the Hebrew and that word actually has a few different meanings that you can bring in but the word actually means Messiah it actually means anointed amen it means The Anointed One right and I hear brother branham ah let me let me just go this way here this Messiah that we're looking at in Daniel 9 he was the anointed one right and what God proclaimed in his word that the anointed Lawn would come in dwell amongst his people in it he did this brother sister watch in the manifestation of Jesus Christ in flesh amen oh God replace that inside of that woman right and bring forth here Jesus Christ in flesh right it came in a way that was so humble that they did not see it brother sister this is what I want to focus on today in the idea if you can catch it that there Jesus Christ was sitting there for 30 years the anointing Lord and the whole of Jerusalem the Anointed Messiah right in their myths and they didn't even know it and so much of the fact when he came they received his not they received him not they didn't give him the time of day well their lives 30 years not even anointed so to say or to look at right but it was a secret work that God was what bringing forth in Jesus Christ he's had to live a perfect life and what he had to do it because you couldn't name it he had to good because he had to take your place amen he was nothing but God in flesh and he could do nothing but live or die him but he was he came and lived out that male attribute of the Lord knowing that his female attribute would need to a lot to take of that sacrifice of the male attribute oh my so that ought to make you feel pretty good this morning because that would tell us that maybe there's something special about you hallelujah so we begin that word Messiah or Mashiach is actually used thirty-eight times in the Old Testament right and now by the grace of God in Daniel 9 now that's the only reference that we have to the Messiah so what are you saying I'm saying that 36 times that word is used in the Hebrew it's not necessarily referencing Jesus Christ at all so what are you saying that if that word means anointed it's actually talking about somebody else all right now I want you to take this picture with me if we can because remember in this hour and in this day and I'm going to begin the bridges if we can but there is what we've seen another rendition or another coming forth of the Messiah sign it meant as Jesus Christ was on earth what we see the the the the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart we see Lord Jesus Christ by the word showing that he was there that was the Messiah exon and what they asked her probably show how is that the Messiah Cod and he said it's Luke 1730 amen in that last day thus the Son of man should be revealed amen that was a capital S amen and we come back around and we see that it was a son of man revealing the son of man amen hallelujah but brother sister and what I'd really like to jump into today is that you'll actually find out that God anointed that prophet in in and what he came forth in such a way revealing the Messiah side that the people lot they began to worship him like the Messiah isn't that something and yet we find out that there's actually he himself identified that that was the masonic sign and remember in 64 question answers he came forth and they said they said it looks so much like you could be that messiah in this hour and he said I'm not that Messiah he said that would make me Antichrist but he looked so much like Jesus Christ that the world began to mistake him for being Jesus Christ here on this earth oh ma now in this idea that we want to begin to bring forth I want you to see and I'm just going to quote it to you for now but I want you to see that when they asked the Prophet if he was the Messiah he said no I'm not he said but we are messiahs he actually referred to the people never separating himself and never coming around and say yes you're right it is me I am the Messiah but every time he would reference that Jesus Christ presence was near he would say we have that show me an isolated spot I can't find it so we come to a place that we realized that God brought a messiah sign in Jesus Christ right he was the Word made manifest but then when we realized that the Elias sign would have what come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord John the Baptist would come forth it away he would want actually just flood he would be making away prepared for Jesus Christ to take over hallelujah and Lord they mistaken well that manifestation of the Lord and miss that God was actually trying to do something greater than what John the Baptist was and now we come into a place with this prophet that God has given us we've taken off a little bit of a nature and a lot of people have that we begin to place people on pedestals preacher on pedestal and I've seen it so much just being a pastor evangelist and so forth are coming they'll say oh brother Branham was so great oh so mighty Oh everything I don't know about you but if you got the Holy Ghost Sonia you get that little conviction that rolls on you because they're actually elevating and glorifying a man and not actually seeing that he was a sinner that God was trying to use so we come down to the idea oh brother you're talking about the hidden purpose of the Messiah son and that's what I want to talk about because you see the Messiah sign in itself was obvious Allah knew her they would come to Jesus Christ Nicodemus and so forth and they would come form they say they say we know that God is with you because no man can do the things that you do except God be with him they needed the brother branham watch you will come in the Gulf to Chicago and preach baptism and oneness and so forth never say but nobody would challenge that gift they would stay separate of it and they would show that what it was obvious what God had in front of them why are you sitting here today because it's obvious what God has done for you so we have the option and I feel that we've been over over lightened in this area of just coming back and talking about what God did through a man or a reading quotes and and doing this and doing that and we're actually missing the whole purpose of why God sent the Messiah sign the hidden point of what God was trying to do for his children amen you see was Jesus Christ when he came forth did he come to a place and say okay uh it's really just my show here but you know the scripture says that Jesus didn't even have to baptize he misled his disciples done I'm going some of this you see that Masonic sign wants to be glorified that Masonic sign it was the Word made flesh amen and that's why they came to him they cried out Lord they cried out yes you're the son of God yes we worship you but I want us to see that as we begin to work with this idea here that God had a hidden purpose that he was trying to reveal to his children and I feel like we're standing here and that's went right over our head try to pay close attention if you can help me here I want you to see this in 61 117 Messiah listen this message when I get a chance to be a great blessing to you and eat 22 he says he says then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah he says then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was like who that Messiah is capital M he says you could yield yourself to a place that you could be anointed like he was oh that's just for preachers what's your expectation for what God wants for you so now we're coming today you see brother sister this is not a dead work at home it's not a dead work we actually have the only living word that's existing in this world right now this playa counterfeits there's plenty of things that look close but I'll tell you what brother sister this is the only message that can bring Jesus Christ on the scene a minute so look at this now he's talking about you and he says if you can get yielded like he was he said we become Messiah pets notice he adds an X to it so you don't become the Messiah you become a messiah at hallelujah so now you become what you become an anointed one as the bride of Jesus Christ now I want you to see this because the Prophet himself he didn't say no wait a minute this is my show but notice the Messiah sign that was working inside of him was actually after the same purpose that the Mossad sign in Jesus Christ was made you'll see this we're gonna go through it alright now notice here he says we become Messiah aunts little lights he said that's what the church is supposed to be we've been supposed to be that for 60 years and we see it right now it's just as dead as it's ever been God took the eyes away from just like Samson once his eyes took around Samson discharged around the old the old grain silo wherever it was there the garner and well he just kept on look just push it blind couldn't even see who he was didn't see what was going on around him what he actually took the condition of the age in it he was blind election miserable and didn't even know it we don't have to be miserable today you don't have to Lord you don't have to sit there and wonder if God came he came in and he's looking for a boss or a man and that fast so here a man going to God so no yes that's what the church is supposed to be that doesn't mean that a preacher has to come in and be it for you that's what you are he says the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones his standing light is the light of Messiah risen Christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages he said sometimes catch this it go most goes completely out where we at it's almost completely out then it comes back again that's for you that was anointed for you so he says God's anointed one God's Messiah do you realize Akron has a representation of the Messiah sign the Messiah light is in this area the Messiah guide all forget seeing the spiritual eyes brother sister this homeland it might be light outside but it's completely dark but in this one little room that's pulsating what the light of God and you know it just takes a little light in a very dark place and it will displace darkness itself amen light is dominant light makes darkness hide amen and what the light of God is not a weak heart it's not a light but it is what the omnipotent God in displaying his children Amen hallelujah so he says if Messiah means The Anointed One and means King is says then if the church is anointed by the Messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his Dominion so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain he's saying what's God been trying to do maybe it's a question in your mind he's been trying to turn you into the Messiah Church hallelujah you see we'll get through this after a bit let's let's just keep moving on I want to read you a few times that Messiah their Messiah is used in the Old Testament Psalms 20 verse 5 I'm going to go pretty quick here just hold with me because I got a lot to say Psalms 20 verse 5 it says we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our God we will set up our banners the Lord fulfill all by petitions whoo that sounds good now no I that the Lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand oh ma that's something that word Messiah or Messiah the Old Testament it was an anointed Church God will save you amen he calls you an orator because brother sister we should know that God is here right now they were going away but do you realize that you are called to bring an atmosphere amen you're called when you go not just in the church but wherever you go your parking the life of the Holy Ghost Himself amen and what does that mean that means God Himself is inside of you that's why Jesus takes it out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water how's the flow you see that flow that's not something to Sarah whoo I'm in the message whoa that's living waters oh can someone pray for me I'm in the message you know why our church is sit in the condition that they do is because we don't look like messiahs each one of you were made to pack the Holy Spirit each one of you were made to catch souls but you see many times we've talked we've tried we've done this and that and we're missing the point you've got to yield to God you've got to let God speak through your mouth hallelujah hey even preachers got difficult I get up here brother since I've done this so much i canna set myself aside as fence company income really fast or slow picking this lot and then little things come by I don't even control it it just rolls out but brother sister I step down from the anointing I just told the brother I said I said make sure you get to me about five ten minutes before I after I'm preaching because after that and I preach like this I'm whooped and if I'm not careful I can let that atmosphere start going and I'll sit just right there and almost like I'm under a juniper tree so I said what I'm said but the camphor you preset you gonna kill yourself so what if I'm not preaching like that but if he's preaching like that through me helliya but we have to get to a place we all have our ups and downs and we're trying to get rid of those because we don't need those you know faith don't have ups and downs faith has thus saith the Lord faith knows the will of God hallelujah prophet said he said he said that the only way to know the will of God is my faith well you see that's why we looked inside we said well what about my brother what about my sister order what about my family what about this what about my cousin and brother sister what does it say on the inside of you that's not a hope so faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of the unseen you realize hope sits there with an expectation of good if the very expectation of good is there and it says yes that's possible then you need to grab some faith on that and say yes it is the will of God and don't let your profession see different things we're not weak there are so vilified 15 mushiya he says saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm God said touch not mine anointed why do you think the devil can't take your life he tries he tries and he tries something about that he elected see that was predestined from the foundation of the world and he cannot put his hand on it but can't you see when it gets to a place that you realize you don't need any power this message says you don't have any power you know what you don't have any power you never did me did I you know what you don't need any power all you need is a thority hallelujah all's you need is what just like that little policeman remembers a little frog I and get right in the middle the role that science says stop Moses with soul has to stop if we know who's backing us this morning if we know that when we put that sign up to the devil that's top devil if you know who's backing up it has to stop oh so the little Messiah acts that God is called forward you know the word Messiah is used again in the New Testament there and especially the calling out in John 1:14 I read this real quick when it comes to the New Testament messiahs has actually used only one place that we find and that's in John 1:14 and it says one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew simon Peters brother he first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto Him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ so the translation from the Hebrew Old Testament to the New Testament places the word Messiah is actually the Christ so when the word Christos is used it's talking about the Anointed One that's why we say Jesus Christ amen but notice when even our opening scripture there in Revelations 11:15 it said the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ who is that Christ do you feel like that I wonder if Jesus walking down the road said boy I wish God was around me he was the word and once now notice because we have Jesus Christ living infinite flesh it could be killed and this is what I like said I'm talking about but then right when he got baptized and the Duff came down and filled him it was a walk things started happening he had a will to live out you know what do you think obviously we know you know Jesus Christ he rejoiced when he seed when it when he when he seen the names that written on the book and so forth and and and and he was so excited when when he seen souls coming and and those things were there but but I wonder if while he was on that journey walking with the Holy Ghost I wonder if there was there was a time where the Holy Ghost wasn't the Holy Ghost only when it came to a death I find it so ironic that were here living on this earth in this season and we don't realize that the season of the cost is not over you realize the Feast of Pentecost does not end until the feast day of atonement and the trumpets the feast trumpets so what's the feast of Pentecost that's when the Holy Ghost is in you you see we come back around and and and and I told my church awhile ago I said I said we all those act like we're in the Acts age except we don't have the same persecution well beat up wait they were carrying all this great burden do you realize even with two million demons added it does not change the fact that Jesus Christ and his powers omnipotent and the worst that he can do is still nothing compared to who he is and the only thing that really separates us from becoming what we need to become is the fact that we don't have the revelation of who we are how can we sit here scared and nervous [Music] hallelujah looking at the news and all these things like that watching oh oh what's the mall gonna hold we know what tomorrow holds amen we know that Christ is at the helm amen we know he said not one thing can be out of cater amen not one thing we know who's got the wheel now let's go let me read you another one Messiah 1661 a twenty nine he says so if he was called Messiah which he was because he was anointed with that holy spirit and any church that's anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah at a little smaller God and someday when this body is resurrected I hope before him that God can get ahold of a bunch of people that will manifest his power in every dimension that it's supposed to be in the seven dimensions and that Masonic anointing on the bride will manifest power in every dimension it's supposed to be at light matter time hallelujah and then watch that dimension of the demons in the fourth realm and TV waves and everything oh I wonder if it's supposed to be there don't you know every devilish subject amen under the feet of Jesus Christ amen you are more than a conqueror hallelujah think about this even in the dimension of the sense where the believers go if one of them dies and transforms into that dimension if the power God be in you and you pray on their milk on my back we still believe heard a story about an atheist died and found him go himself going to hell and in the middle of the experience I don't know if his Jesus Christ or an angel son said come it's not time for you and you're not going here and he came back to life was married to an atheist he said Jesus Christ is real He gave His life to Jesus Christ this on a nominal level brother sister gave his life to Jesus Christ started preaching the gospel and his spouse left him because she was an atheist and still didn't believe it like knows name I like to tell about the message hallelujah let's go higher but we're living in a day brother sister get on YouTube you watch that what Muslims are having visions that Jesus Christ is the real Savior we're living in a moment God is what beginning to change the scene and we can sit there and let it change in our myths or we can become what the word has ordained us to be now notice he says now you don't have to die to get this you have to spiritually die I wonder how much Laodicea has been in our lives this is really what's really keeping us out he says the inside is where God gets into control you and as he presses himself forward in you don't let any root of bitterness hatred malice strife that will run him right back again notice how many long we've been in this the Holy Ghost has been ruling on you pressing pressing trying to take you over he's pushing can any of us say he hasn't been we know he is but then watch how the devil comes contrary and I'll bring a little root of bitterness by Sabri moved out by he'll what he'll rot it'll come back against what God is trying to do and we forfeit the press of the Holy Ghost hatred malice strife he says that'll run him right back again oh I wonder how many times we've went right back to Laodicea even being in this message when God wants to make you an amateur God you realize your prophet said he said the seal of the Tree of Life was broke at Calvary you can go back to Eden right now walking in the cool of the evening with the land you see we're waiting on something and whatever and we're way old Terry Terry Terry let's go carrying to this remember as the Prophet talked about the Messiah asked in question answer 64 he said a perfect time was Elijah and Elijah when Elijah was getting raptured go back in the scripture and see what Elijah did to Elijah on all four stages the three stages the moving to Jordan he comes to him Elijah says you I'll not leave you and every single time Elijah says tarry here tarry here just wait here you're just fine right here just wait just wait you can wait a justification your prophet type those are three works of grace you be this way to justification don't worry I'm some time sit around in sanctification yeah yeah you'll be anointed sometime oh yeah yeah you got the Holy Ghost you apparently got baptized you're good to go just stay right there he said the Jordan he said it was a type of the dying out hallelujah and then what he Elijah every single time he said I will not leave them you've got to set your face towards Christ say I will not leaving I'm not satisfied with this type of a church with this type of a church experience I want the world has seen the true resurrected Jesus Christ amen the message did not die out and William Adam the message did not die out once he was off the same the message was Jesus Christ and he said he would be in you so he says just get all the meanness anybody got any meanness he's telling you how to become a mess i an't get that rid of bitterness and get that strife out he says get all the meanness and the superstitions pterri pterri Church don't worry the rapture is coming just sit in the seat on anointed you'll make the rapture that's a devil's line you know it how do we both sister I'll just tell you a story okay the Lord this hit me this refresh this and and a lot of this about that yielding and how that's what your prophet said you said all you have to do healed just let go let go get rid of yourself about a month and a half ago is preach that sermon on yield am I go giggle I guess I better do this I'm pastor so I start press it God what do you want me to do today this on a Saturday my family had a King James Version of memorization turned on it's a little little tournament or something they ran and and and I said I woke up say God what do you want me to do there you let me go to this go to this with my kids and see how they do or or can I just stay home and work on the garage and Sutton came right to me that said you go and you know how we do we go mm I don't know if that was God and so you know what I did I asked again their son said go like all right I don't think that's God this pride just cam so my wife she goes okay well we got a DOS all right bye I got to work on the garage so I get changed I go up there I start working and I'll tell you what it was a conviction like a load of bricks falling on me and it struck on me it said it wasn't like a voice I heard it said go is this something said you have to go so I'm like okay I get it I get it cuz he's alive did you know that he's alive who does this for you do we have to change our expectations I started that it's about third ball and I said God what no world I am so stupid like brother man my poor stupid servant so I go there I got this little tournament and I get there and I'm sitting there and everything's going normal you know I'm just watching the kids answer all the questions and and I sat there and and then we're getting ready to leave and I'm out there with the fellow who runs he's a Baptist I believe will be a he'll be a Methodist Baptist Pentecostal message believer pretty soon here but we're staying out there talking getting really I mean it was literally like like it would have been less than a minute we're gonna leave and all of a sudden this big red truck and this churches is Bethel Bethel Baptist Church out by Annapolis and and this big red truck with 12-inch lifts just comes rolling like it sits on a side road there and this pulls into the in the end of the the pavement there and I'm looking at him like he's look at me though and anyway they pull right up to us and I'm sitting here and look at him look at them okay God what's going on here and these two young guys get out by 18 20 years old and then they come up and they start walking up and they said we weren't gonna stop but I just got to ask you guys something so I said okay we guys got going on he's like we were driving by this church here on Christmas Eve he said it was 11 o'clock at night and he said as I was getting close I was driving home from my friend's house here with my sister and we drove and he said I could see the church then they got a big light right out front he said and there was this man standing right in front of the church he said he was 4 foot tall he said shoulders are about this wide and and he was just standing there he said he's just a black just dressed in black a black face everything was black and he said I I looked at my sister I said sister do you see that do you see that his sister couldn't see it he said so like I came in as I was driving closer I slowed down he said I just sustained he said I'm so shocked I'm like 11:30 at night and this thing sitting here and he said all of a sudden he said he said it looked at like it seen him he said and then that black creature it turned around and I ran right into the church and disappeared he's like no it sounds crazy what do you guys think that was I'm with these Baptist fellas I can't believe they're coming but the I just kind of looked at he jump right in he said he said well I know what that was he said it was a big dog and the guy said it wasn't a dog it was a human he said he ran toward the church and disappear the guy said well I'm pretty sure it was a dog so I sat back like Ella who his son jumped then he said he said well I'll tell you exactly what it was it was a big turkey but they don't believe in supernatural you know what I mean they don't know I'm sitting here like oh God of mercy and I'm sitting there like ding-ding-ding go go and so they got done the guys like it wasn't no turkey it was a man but it didn't even have a face and so I looked at him I said well y'all won't know what that was I'll tell you exactly what it was it was a demon I said let me tell you a story so I started telling them some of the stories I've seen demons quite a bit too much for my own liking I'd like to see angels instead though not the fallen ones but the real ones I'm looking forward to that cuz I know it's coming I know it's in the midst right now hallelujah we were meant to see angels amen you know your prophet said if you could get your house in order you'll see angels there come on we know these quotes you see but you're never gonna see in there if you got the world and you got your phones telling you these things these things wooing you to sleep putting all sorts of junk in your in your eyes and you know your eyes are the gateway to your soul Christ said you have to be a single in the eye single you got to look to the one that's why in the Old Testament they would wear for luxuries and they'd have that flat tree but right on the head write down the word would be in the little scroll right there and every time they'd have a certain verse that it is look right up at it where like there they see the word was always be far there so I told the story and then the Baptist fell on his son and I go okay we gotta go I mean they were they were gone cuz then the story God took me to a place told me where the demon was that and I cast it out in the name of Jesus Christ last he still does that to de amen not just to me through you hallelujah the weakest Christian puts the devil on his knees they met hallelujah his doctor believed Amen it's time to get unbelief out so I talked to these gentlemen for after they ran out it's just me and them then hit him up with a mess you cheat him up with everything and balls in their court now but I come back around I say God all you really wanting me to do it's just talk to you listen to you see why can't we be effective even in our churches for the sister don't you realize you were made for nine spiritual gifts you were made your prophets that you are made to have the pillar of fire right here everyone expressing the word right here each and every one of you but I'll tell you what when it looks effective you take it home with you watch that atmosphere put the devil to run hallelujah Hey how we gonna get our family members don't you realize that's why God has you they're not getting to my head and playing even though I kind of have hallelujah we're gonna try to close pretty soon here because I know it's it's it's already been I've been 45 minutes but we start really late but I want you to see this as we go just slow a bit farther because I want you to see this idea because it lives out for you remember you are made in the likeness and image of God when Jesus Christ came that was God in flesh you know he looked like he looked just like you like I said in the Davi could get a headache he was human just like you but you see he had an image and likeness and I want you to know you're not just in his image you're in his likeness now I want to turn a corner with you really quick here because I want you to see Jesus's plant that he was living out let's go on our Bibles to mark 13 earth mark 3:13 notice early on in mark here see if we hardly have enough fervor to get to the house of God how do we expect other people to come fall in love with the God do you have this has to change my church has to change I have to change I have to realize that every time I'm gathered with the children of God we got a wildfire right there and if I got to bring the big fire I'll bring it if somebody else bring it let them bring it whoever's going to bring it let them bring it amen and I'll tell you what I walked in here and there's people up here praying how you gotta get it hallelujah you ain't coming in here for it for the Word of God to get your sin away you're supposed to come in here with the sonority put away and praying for the spiritual manifest himself right here we come in the church and we leave church too many times with the same sicknesses the same oppressions and the same depressions on us that we walked in with that's not what the house of God is for your prophet called this the end you're supposed to put the oil and the light on in here hallelujah remember last time amen there's a while back I remember hallelujah for the Good Samaritan deity he had oil the Holy Ghost and the stimulation of the wire and that brought healing to the wounded to the broken to the sick because those who needed freedom and I'll tell you that save the Holy Ghost is here I map so notice mark 313 so Jesus Christ now Lou this this is V Messiah and says he goes up into a mountain and cloth unto Him whom he would and they came unto him and he ordained 12 that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have power to heal sicknesses and cast out devils I want you to notice this here so here it is the Messiah and he's actually trying hidden plan he's what he's wanting not to just be there amongst the people doing a work all by himself but he's actually trying to activate anointed ones in his midst now I want you to see this Jesus Christ does not go with them he does not go with them when he sends the 74 he does not go with them now catch this all they had was the faith in his word you know why because they did not have the Holy Ghost come on out they just with a faith in his word that he told them took that word and fulfilled that word to a team he was the Messiah activating anointed ones in his merits without even the Holy Ghost and what the do they went out and they did it well come on mark sixteen believers these signs shall follow them Velma that believe a man he can use your hands sister a man he could use my patient just take a faith in that word you know you don't even need the Holy Ghost to have this that's how simple it is but I say God don't let me have nothing without your Holy Ghost just fill me with that spirit amen and let that light consume me amen so what'd he do he sent him forth and they did it now this is what I want you to see mark 3:19 moved just a little bit down so it tells you which ones come forth now I want you to see this Jesus Christ life was lived in such an anonymity look at this why you saying that brother mark 3:19 and Judas Iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into a house and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread notice and when his friends heard of it Jesus's friends they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself Jesus Christ lived such an anonymous life in their midst that once he started looking at Norrington they thought he was crazy brother cam why is that important it's completely important because that's what you've done that's what I've done we live lives unless I got ten smarter tests away but I'm not satisfied I will be unsatisfied I'll um sit like this until the rapture but I'll tell you what I have to see the living Jesus Christ in my life every day and I will not be satisfied until I do and I pray then fill me with a desperation so it never stops you see you don't have to sit here and say well I'm a sister God can't use me to heal when God actually used a sister and brother branham's meetings to bring forth a healing to another lady's door or little baby when she was sick because the mother that was called to pray for that little baby had compassion you know we need to start saying God put me in your path you see this word is alive right now it doesn't matter how I'm anointed you felt how anonymous you feel like you're in your life or what people think about you you'll only cry should be for Jesus Christ fulfill your life amen you see what Christ's plan ended up sending about March 6 but we find that what according to the plan of Christ the Messiah sign was actually sent forth not just to reveal itself but to manifest Messiah it's right in his midst why do you think the Prophet brought it down like he did why do you think he didn't glorify himself why you think he didn't say okay show's over once I'm gone but he said well these signs shall follow them that the belief all the way to the end you can't undo it you see we get we've heard so much Antichrist I must say for it is Antichrist preaching against Pentecost and the life and spirit of Jesus Christ that we what by that by that Antichrist where we pull ourselves and say well you know that's just for a preacher that's what they want you to think and shame on if they're doing it I know what I hear but I'll tell you he wants to live in you that's why that's why brother sister this year some of the main show pieces of the book of Acts are two deacons not even the preachers you know you know what God left it in such a place he spoke more about Stephen and Philip than he did Peter but you can't kick Peter out either cuz Peter was so anointed that his shadow the people it wasn't that there's power in that shadow it was the faith of the people in Peter they knew God was there that's what we need we need the people that are in your individual lives to see the walk of God afresh in your life and to realize that Jesus Christ is the same today in you hallelujah hallelujah but we got a closer close let me go one more area 61 117 I must skip that so I got five sermons on this so you see what struggling and a half I cut up I cut out a lot a lot but I want you to catch the main point the time is now for us to look I don't have to tell you this it's in the message and it's in the Word of God see what I'm saying I'm showing you what is obvious fact to the believer but you have to realize that you personally are made to know God why are your attributes being made manifest now for fellowship your prophet said that you're here right now for fellowship you know your prophet said he said one of the worst mistakes that I've made is that I just haven't waited on God at much I wonder how many times that we sit back and we're just not really you know what well let's say our prayer and we'll roll it out but I wonder how often that we just say okay God what are you gonna say and then we set up shop they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up like Eagles they go a little bit farther Matthew 14:24 we're closing this passage because I want you to maybe I'll get that tonight maybe I won't you'll go somewhere else though Lucy where's that God to God how about it amen so notice so Jesus Christ lived a life where he was manifesting the supernatural never agree with that no I want you to think did Jesus Christ ever manifest something that you can't on the supernatural realm let's let's talk about this he cursed the fig tree Matthew 21 he cursed the fig tree and the fig tree withered and but I want you to see this because they didn't have the Holy Ghost and the scripture says and they marveled they marveled wow this is amazing and what did Jesus say them he said he said what I've done to the fig tree you'll also do but if you say unto this mountain be thou removed plucked up and cast in the sea it shall be you not was standing right I'm paraphrasing yeah he told his disciples you could curse a fig tree and it has to die he said if you said under the mountain be moved it would move I'm gonna take you in this portion here because I want you to see it you are not on anointed blobs and the Laodicean age come on now then we just kind of this blob around boom you're prophesied we're like a bump on a log oh just go into Church oh I believe the message no no where you go brother that's where God's going what's he got in front of you the anointed but this is the truth cuz I want you to see this when he said to that tree he said pluck it out I said all he was doing was what he was showing he was showing the Garden of Eden sonship his disciples that is literally what he was doing so also he was showing you is what a son or daughter of God can do come on now I can prove through you through the scripture all the way absolutely no problem it's there your prophet said it he said earlier in the sermon all Jesus Christ was doing was revealing a word but I want you to see this that that if you say in this mountain be thou removed mark 11 there and plucked up and cast in the sea and you're not doubting it shall happen that was the scripture that stumped the Prophet his whole life so what are you saying the revelation was not made manifest until the seventh angel was manifested and then God could give the revelation to the seventh angel that this word doesn't need to stump you but this word is actually only what you are touch Matthew 14:24 read with me he says he said but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary our coming now and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea Jesus is walking on the sea why you know he was the Messiah of course I'm reading this for reason you know and the disciples saw him walking on the sea and they were troubled notice when they seen the manifestation of that war it troubled them they were not comfortable with it well sure they didn't know what sonship was they didn't know what atom possessed come on no notice they were trouble saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear we have so much fear in our myths right now your prophet said four times in the message he said he said 80% of the people in his preaching place he said 80% of the people in this room have issue with nervousness I wonder if I could say 80% here or 90 or zero they scared enough in hallelujah only I want is a good fear of God amen hallelujah notice and that straightway Jesus spake unto them so notice they were scared at this manifestation of sonship but what would calm them now a little bit of the word the revealed word now I want you to see is this powerful he says Jesus Vader I'm saying be of good cheer be happy about this this is great really it is I be not afraid this is what we have to catch if this comes to you it's not you it's him I'm looking one direction as I close okay I feel it now he says and Peter answered him and said now I want you to see this who is Peter Peters a man without the Holy Ghost Peters a man he stepped in to deny Christ three times really look silly here he's gonna cut somebody zero all that is laying inside of him and looked at Peter right here before all this comes and Peter answered him and said so notice all Jesus said was in his I be not afraid that's all he says all he says Oh lease s look and Peter answered him and said lord if it be that okay bid me come unto thee on the water well that's only for the Messiah Peter back off that's just for the Messiah now I want you to see this this is critical then it comes through a place that God what do you think made Peter do that that bride seed of election on the inside of him but will we these won't be a showboat he wasn't wanting to be a Szabo he was only crying out to what he was he was a son of God made for the traits and conditions that the first Adam had the first Adam was a living soul now notice so what does Jesus tell between diverse and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus all he had to do was hear the war come what do you think you're waiting for when when when when we're waiting for come up hither he identified with Christ now I want you to see this he knew what Christ could do he seen crisis do this and what did say something inside him said you can do the same thing did he have the no you see I'm saying we are living so underprivileged remember it really does come down and I'm not proud I can get that far it comes down to motives and objectives this is why we pray God put me where you want me to put me because whatever mountain stands in front of you we're packing oh I don't have the Holy Ghost I can't do nothing that's not factual at all I'll tell you what maybe if God let you do this maybe you would get the Holy Ghost you shall say maybe you'd realize he's real enough to fill you with his presence and that he wants to remember your prophet said he says like a standing foot pipe all the way into this face and the water that lays in it trying to get out on a leak at the very bottom that is the pressure that God wants to fill you with his spirit he wants you to be like this that bad see I'm saying I'm not running through the river when I'm done understand I'm saying but what I'm saying is whatever mountains in front of me this is what I got to see so notice and Peter was come down out of the ship and he walked on the water to go to Jesus and but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and he began to sink he cried saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto Him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt I'll talk to you why he was doubting he didn't have the Holy Ghost he did not have the faith of Christ inside of him amen that's why you don't see those failures in the book of Acts that's why when you get in the book of Acts you see shadows healing does he fill up translating hey my drive would be a lot better if the Lord woke me up this morning said just say the word brother but has to be for a purpose how do I know there's not a soul in the way I'm supposed to go talk to but you see if we never get our self away from our purpose we can never see sonship so the first Adam was made a living soul but the second Adam was made a quickening spirit quickening spirit if he was a quickening spirit where is he quickening at inside of you I see it I see I'm telling you I'm watching God do stuff right now like I haven't seen Oh a long time but I it's it's all me because I see the more I let my flesh live the less it goes out God told me to have to do something three weeks ago right when all this stuff was happening and something has said don't you go you shouldn't go you sneeze stay home and I did and since then I feel like I've been fighting to get back and I thought I said you know what I went and I had two issues attack my bodily me bodily immediately and now I'm sitting here and say well God's know I hear how do I believe he is but I believe he's warning me to not sit there and be satisfied with a one-word answer or this or that but he's wanting his church to come into a communion this is who you are let's then read the Messiah messenger listen to when you get a chance he said that's what God well God wants eaglets he wants Messiah s he wants you to be a messiah right now he wants men and women did he catch his sisters he wants men and women who have signs and wonders yes you sister yes you sister this is God's revealed will to us he wants a church that's filled with the Holy Ghost a church reflecting him the same yesterday today and forever God didn't die he just born to Kingdom got his Messiah's Messiah in amen every word he says they say Amen that's right he said yes sir they'd look like him act like him they believe like him got the conductor moving right on out with signs and wonders following he said that's Messiah Messiah lives tonight he isn't dead he's alive forevermore you believe that What did he say he would it would be he said these signs shall follow you then that believe I'm just gonna say I could and we'll see I might go there tonight my brother's sister Matthew 1412 he said the works that I do shall ye do also I can stop right there and say everything you've seen him doing the Gospels it's yours but the same issue comes up every time and they were troubled and they feared and they doubted you know what when when the winds came to destroy the ship on the ocean and Christ was sleeping on it how many remember that and Jesus stood up and he said peace be still do you realize that right before Jesus said said peace be still and they won't come up he looked at them he said why did you fear why do I have to get up and do this why are you afraid you speak to the storm why he was releasing them back to sonship and he left the memorial right in this gospel the works that I do shall he do also cuz I go into the Father greater works shall you do love Lauren remember what he said he said you got to yield I'm telling you we have to pray more we have to get in the spirit have to say god I'm gonna yield myself I'm tired of controlling myself god I got too many means I got too many family members I got too many I got too many financial needs or or or or physical needs whatever it is we've got to lay it down and say God fill me he's gonna do it she you shouldn't say well I don't know maybe in your church brother but not here the thought and heart of every believer here says yes this is us Akron's Messiah ants are here right now they come from Delta they come from all over the place God has anointed his church to be adorned with the word enclosing your prophet said he said he said don't come and tell him well I need this or knew that he said come like you're a rascal he said you come to him he said in this message he said you come to him and say I'm a rascal there's nothing good about me not one good thing there any one good thing about me I just told you I'm a failure any Edna wait till I left and I look stupid and I had to go back and go and then and then it'll happen but you know what he did that with my unbelief He loves us that much look in your life as we get ready to pray what's laying there are you satisfied with the move of God in your life he has an individual move in every single life here I tell you that by what we just read but will you believe will you be serious then it's you with Peter he said he said as he spoke the word the Holy Ghost fell on them we don't need anything special you just have to accept the word having it's a gun I believe that's me do be scared okay he's scared or nothing here hallelujah you believe any feels God's will you can walk on water you could stop a stop Halla knew you would pray for the sick and they'd be healed you could take on something deadly and it would not harm you why you are the anointed church you're called for souls your prophet said in that message he said he said I see it twenty to thirty times a day we got a whole church I wonder how many times we see in a day this legacy is not dead enough to make me dead it's not dead enough to make you dead Christ come and live in me let's bow our heads and pray if you believe that would you just reveal your desires to him as we pray a most precious Lord Jesus Christ how we love you today Lord and Lord as you been showing me these things Lord and I don't know but Lord I just know Lord I'm tired of living in an experience that you can't be Lord of all my life don't just be a savior God a personal Savior or or just show me that you could walk through a prophet but God you said there's a special prophet class in this hour I believe Lord that you showed me that I was supposed to preach this here and Lord if you sold this word here Lord that means there's some Messiah acts right in the midst of this church god I pray today Lord in the name of Jesus Christ God that you don't know in
