thank everybody for their faithful support of the church by the grace of the Lord we're so grateful to serve the Lord Jesus in this hour amen Colossians chapter 1 so we want to just read verse 18 I'm gonna try to be a little short on time you know Genevieve's sick and then everybody's coffin here so I wanted to try to get them into bed early so I want to be a little mindful of that by the grace of Lord cautions 1:18 we'll just read this one scripture and then we like to reward a prayer and preach this thought here cautions 1:18 let's read this on three one two three and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence let's have a prayer and ask him to have preeminence here through the Word of God Heavenly Father we bow our heads humbly lord god we recognize Lord that your angels are here Lord God they're your prophets said they're here too to write down Lord the prayer request Lord and to record what's going on so Lord in Jesus Christ's name help us to give you preeminence tonight Lord God we know you're watching Lord God organize I heard this week Lord we know character is what we do when we're alone dear God and when we think no one's watching but Nord I want to live a life where I feel like you're watching me all the time because you are though the scripture says the eyes of the Lord run to and fro upon the whole earth and Lord you're seeking men and women that will serve you and want to please you so lord maybe we just feel that your spiritual eyes are here tonight the Holy Spirit's here tonight watching our behavior watching our attitudes Lord God and Father knowing that may we give you preeminence Lord God you're always watching us and or thank you for always watching us Lord it's comforting to know that our father cares so much that he watches us every hour Lord we give you glory speak to us through this thy word in Jesus Christ's name and the Saint said Amen god bless just being seated praise the Lord so I'm hoping to work my way up to the the part of this sermon where brother Branham talks about predestination I like to end with predestination a few thoughts on that wonderful wonderful doctrine by the grace of the Lord so again happy Thanksgiving to all those livestreaming and Everett everybody here by the grace the Lord hope everybody has a wonderful Thanksgiving I know I'm going to by God's grace if the Lord tarries I'll hopefully I'll take a nap or something and feel good and and get everybody healed up that's what we want to do we want to get the family healed up so we thank the Lord for Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving will always be a special time for me it was I looked it up today it was actually the same day it was November 22nd 2001 when I first heard the message and the tomorrow's a 22nd as well so it lines up perfectly 17 years ago tomorrow I heard that serpent seed for the first time I got pictures from that night I'm gonna try to post it on Facebook if I can remember to do that and just thank the Lord but Thanksgiving is always a special time because that's when I received the message so it always means so much and we can always be thankful for God's Word and and it'll always just direct our lives praise the Lord now I want to just recall this statement that brother Branham made but the man said by preaching this message he said if God will help me and reveal to your in to your mind all these things that I've talked about all through the days of the tabernacle wife said what I've said why I've done what I've done this is why now I want to just rephrase the title it kind of turned this title around its Christ as the mystery of God revealed I kind of want to just turn it around so it makes a little more sense to the children God's mystery revealed is Jesus Christ so in other words God's mystery is Christ if we could just say it another way God had this mystery in his mind and what was the mystery to bring forth Jesus Christ so I just want to simplify you know I don't want to sound confusing Christ as the mystery of God revealed in other words God's mystery was Jesus Christ amen and so today God's mystery is Jesus Christ which is the form ease in today is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that's what we're looking at tonight and that's what this whole sermon is about it's showing how God was above us and then God as the Father God with us as the son Jesus Christ and now God in us through the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I want to just simplify that hopefully even the youngest Karras you know and I don't think Victoria could but maybe Karras could understand it I'm not sure of victory is do much spiritual thinking tonight but maybe so I want to just catch that day Karras can you understand that that God had a mystery one day but his mystery was Jesus Christ can you understand that it's like God had this secret he said I'm gonna show everybody my secret and then finally the secret was that baby Jesus that was God's secret and it was so gorgeous when he that baby was born all the angels filled the sky and saying glory to God in the highest as we were listening on the way to church amen glory so I want to pick it up right there God's great mystery was that beautiful baby the Lord Jesus Christ of course he became a wonderful man we say a common looking man but not he was uncommon in power Aim head he was uncommon in spiritual beauty and strength he had no physical beauty we desire him but he was sure beautiful spiritually amen what a character there's never been a character like him now he ended last week was showing how Jesus Christ is the principal theme of the Bible and because of that he should be the principal theme of our lives now brother Branham says he says now think about this he said God made him the head of all things the Colossians said so here he said he's the head of all things to us for he was for us which we considered all things you say what about the sinner he was made to be judge of the sinner if he won't accept it sure brother man is breaking in this thought of he's the head of all things he's even the head of all sinners can you say amen to that Jesus Christ is the head of the believer the Saints but he's also the head of every sinner he was made the glory for the believer who does accept it so there all things were made by him and for him program said it takes the night to express the glory of the day how many like looking outside and seeing the night the cold night I mean like that how many like though the beauty of the morning better that's her brother have says he's he said this is what God did he's the head of all things and he says it takes the night to express the glory of the day now if you're really tired you might see the glory of the night because you can't wait to go to bed but brother ham says usually it's the glory of the day that we look forward to it takes the vessel of dishonor to express the love and care for the vessel of the honored in other words it takes a Judas or a Pharaoh and awful Pharaoh or betrayer like Judas it takes the the contrast of that the wickedness of that to show the beauty of a faithful servant of a Peter praise God of a Moses Amen it takes one to express the glory of the other he says it takes the evil woman that would wear immoral clothes and sell her morals to express the virtue of a decent genuine lady see it takes a crook and a thief in a man to express the genuine of a real believer a real Christian it takes a hypocrite to show up the believer what he is and brother have said see so all things were made by him and since he's made all things he said all things was he said then since that's true we should we should make our identification with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us we should be identified with him he says how by living for him not just a confession Amen so because he made us we should live for him and not just have a confession the Rebbe said so many take the so many people take a confession well are you a Christian a Methodist he said that's a long way from being making yourself known as a Christian he says look what the Methodist does I'm a Baptist well look what the Baptist does he says I'm a Catholic look what they do see but the only way you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you he says how we get a stinger there that's that that should have been a stinger to us I should have stung us I hope everybody on the tape gets that seat now what's he talking about he's talking about God's got to come down and identify by the Holy Spirit each of our lives and and and show to everybody that we are his children and the Bible teaches us plainly in mark 16:20 so they do you want to pull that up here mark 16:20 so again sorry par me forgive me mark 16:20 and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen so see the Lord will work with you and the Lord will confirm his word that you preach oh how many times have we seen it got a preacher word and it's just the word that confirms our prayer or confirms our desire or it's the Holy Spirit that confirms our prayer answers our prayer heal someone or save someone it's God working with us amen he said that's the only way to be a Christian is when God identifies you in other words God says this is my son or this is my daughter and I'm gonna vindicate them and prove that they're my daughter by manifesting my spirit in them praise God acts 1413 that he might pull that one up there so see this is the only way you can be a Christian it's not and in church even when people ask me what are you I just say I'm a Holy Ghost field Christian I don't always say well you know I'm a message believer I'd only say that I always say I'm a Holy Ghost field Christian who follows the message of William Brannen I'll say something like that but the main confession we should have is a Christian and then not just have a confession but pshhh people should be able to see that Christ is living in us hallelujah x4 13 now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus amen so see being bold about Jesus and then having Jesus do miracles in our lives makes people know that Jesus is with us amen Loretta says well you say I'm Pentecostal he says that doesn't mean a thing it's got to be Christ identified in you that's when he's recognized you you say I spoke with tongues he said Devils does too you say I shouted he said the muhammadans Buddhas and everything shouts the Indians scream at the snake dance sure they all do cults clans and everything else screaming holler they holler and shout at a baseball game so just shouting tonight doesn't prove anything because they can shouting in Cleveland you know they're at the basketball game they're shouting in Golden's in in California at the basketball game he says that's not the evidence but when Christ is identified in you identifying himself then you are christ-like which the word Christian means to be christ-like there is your identification amen how many want to be like Christ praise God that's that's what brother Han says this is what God is trying to do God is the head of you when he lives through you and manifests his sphere through you and proves other people that there's real Christians alive today amen hallelujah now brother and now breaks in the three fold purpose of the mystery of God which I don't I don't think I got to this last week so now in paragraph 140 finally breaks in this mystery that he says was hid back in the mind of God God had three purposes in this mystery now notice God has a three full purpose in this great mystery secret in this secret he had before the world began he has a three full purpose and we want to find out what this three full purpose was the first thing God wanted to reveal himself to the people that's the first purpose God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered all space-time an eternity could not he's too great to have her be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious he says how could that great being that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is so how could someone as great as God who could live trillions and trains of years and never change how could even begin to manifest himself to us but brother Han said but that's what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and he the only way he could express it was to become a son a man hey I let hear you so god I said oh I love me too father I just want to be a father the only way you could express that was to become a son a man that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man they didn't know what he was talking about many of them he said now do you get it he wanted to express himself that he that that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ so what was God's first purpose he wanted to reveal himself as a father and reveal himself also in Christ now secondly he wants to have the preeminence in this body of believers his bride that he might live in other people so first he wanted to live in His Son and anyone to live in his people now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sins separated them so now there had to be some way to get back in again he says this is rich to me to even think of it you see what God's purpose was why he didn't just keep I'm sorry now why did he just keep Adam and Eve like that he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute you see that if God would have if God would have had Adam and Eve never sinned never would have had to dwell in people amen right because remember God couldn't dwell in people until the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost that's when they received the Holy Spirit to dwell in their souls so see God had to make up a plan where he you know Adam and Eve would be anointed with the spear but not living not having the spirit live in them they could fall and then God could start working to redeem them and pretty soon after about four thousand years God could live in there may have which member was just four days to God because a thousand years like it's like a day unto God it's only been two days since Jesus walked the earth in God's eyes amen so what was two days ago Monday what did you do on Monday well yeah dance class right that was you know hide at school that's just a couple days ago well that's what it feels like to God with Jesus being there Jesus was here two days ago and now we know he's coming very soon praise God so in God's mind he's coming very very soon but for us it might seem like a while I might get old on my hair or get gray maybe fall out but in God's eyes it's nothing it's nothing to see god never could have expressed himself if Adam and Eve never never would have fallen into sin he never could have experienced dwelling in someone I'm sure Malachi Lydia feel like that with their Legos maybe they make something so great they wish they could give it life don't you don't you wish that battering ram you could just give it life and just make it you know work and then that Lydia school that she had in the Lego school don't you wish you could make something and give it what God did God made Adam and Eve but but but he wouldn't actually live inside of them he wanted to dwell in them and and so you know when Adam and Eve fell he had that great place at all well one day he said they lost they they fell one day I'm coming myself amen one day I'll come myself and I'll redeem them and after I pay for other since then I can dwell in their souls amen then I can live in the very being I created amen I'm glad to say tonight that Jesus Christ is living in me tonight amen hallelujah he's living in his own creation how do you know because I don't do what I want to do I do what the word says amen that's how we know that we're fulfilling God's second purpose that God wants to live in people that will give him preeminence amen so the first thing is God would reveal himself to the people in Jesus Christ that was his first purpose the second purpose is to live in his people he says amen now how could he do it brother Graham says he said now he says because he he could have never sorry could have been a father there but that's true but he's also a savior so see just being a father to Adam and Eve wasn't enough he wanted to be a savior and he said you say well how do you know he is brother and said he is because I've had the experience a man hardly been saved out there amen you had the experience I was lost but now I'm saying they men God wanted to express that he wanted to save people and he couldn't express that if Adam and Eve never fell he's a savior he hadn't expressed that now how can he do it only through Christ how could he be a son only through Christ how can it be healer only through Christ see all things are wound up in that one person Jesus Christ amen he said by Madison when I think of it all the denomination's pass away he says everything else when I see God's great purpose he says God having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the Godhead bodily into a people that could have the preeminence is the oversight the leading amen you know I was thinking about that today I thought I don't feel so bad as the pastor you know like sometimes I I just feel you know like well Lord am I doing what you have me to do it something struck me today when I I got up at like 5 o'clock this morning to study and pray and everything and something just struck me in a sin it said God thinks so much of pastors in the fivefold ministry he's been using them for 2,000 years I just thought well that was a real encouragement to me I know that's a pretty simple thought but I'm doing the same thing pastors did 2,000 years ago after the Holy Ghost fell they didn't travel all around and spend their time traveling they faithfully fed the sheep the Word of God and the people grew by that word of God amen and that was Jesus playing 2,000 years ago that still is planned tonight amen so that just gave me a bit of encouragement I said well thank you Lord I'm happy to do what that you've been doing for the last 2,000 years amen now brother Aaron breaks into a little thought here about giving God the preeminence but man said oh you remember if you didn't get the tape I preached here one night on a prisoner of Jesus Christ remember brother Ram preached a sermon called the prisoner Paul a prisoner see when God gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the Spirit says do Paul with all his great intellects he was taught by the mayor to be a great priest or rabbi someday he had high ambitions he was intellectually a great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it see to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ he knowed what it was to say he counted all things as dung help me remember that scripture that's a pretty pretty straightforward scripture Aikau all previous teachings as dung that I might win Christ program said he had to become a prisoner now Paul said he was a prisoner of three times he said in Ephesians what three verse one for this guy because I Paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles so paul was a prisoner in other words he couldn't go preach to the Jews God had imprisoned him or kept him as a preacher to the Gentiles that's what I feel like I'm a prisoner as a pastor to the Bride of Christ fellowship amen I'm a prisoner to my family I'm a prisoner to the Word of God I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ that's all we must be we must find what God has called us to be and then be a prisoner to that now it's not by it's not and it's not against our will it's with our will it's it's a prisoner of love as that song says I'm a prisoner of love I'm a slave to the master aim head I willingly toil in the heat in the cold I seek no reward in this world but I think the song says but there come a payday oh yes mother come a payday when the pearly gates unfold amen hey man how do you want to be a prisoner of love amen now you're it's your love that keeps you locked up in the commands of God that Superman tells us so in Philemon chapter 1 verse 1 and verse 9 Paul says the same thing Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and then he says and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ he says it three times I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ now Paul gives two examples of Paul being a prisoner so let's read them liddie let's go to acts 16 verse 5 if you got that here's one way as proof that Paul was a prisoner now brother Branham says like this Paul had a notion to go to some other place and some rather had called him but he was forbidden by the Spirit to do his own will oh if people 1/2 spiritual can pick that up he was forbidden to do his own will he could only do with the spirit said he said the spirit forbade me he was a prisoner to Christ amen so Church as Christians we should feel the Holy Spirit either forbid us to do things or give us the permission to do things that's what a prisoner is you know you might just say well you know I had I guess I had a little decision I had to make this week kind of like be a prisoner but it's going on here I'm putting this on this airplane mode I'm just gonna shut it off I don't even know what's going on here that's twice that happens I think prisoner I think it's I think it's thought I said Siri or something like that but I just shut it off I'm gonna take it off that's strange yeah I've never had that happen before but even this week I had a little I just kind of felt like the Lord was testing me a little bit and with I don't want to give too many details but I kind of was a test a little bit and it was kind of like a decision with with someone that one to come to our church and I had to make a decision and and I kind of felt like it was the Holy Spirit was telling me no don't allow this person to be a part of our church although it was a temptation now Church I'll be honest it's a temptation to have more people come because you can have more ties and you can you can do more things you know you could you can get preachers more money consent more offerings and things like that although I felt it was a little bit of a temptation for me I felt it was God testing me the conviction on my heart said no don't allow this individual to do that and I thought and that I think that's a good idea here although you know we're small we'd like to see more people in the church I kind of had to tell an individual no you're not welcome to the church because I have to be a prisoner to what the Holy Spirit tells me amen and so I just you know without giving too many details you know I just had to say that and I felt like a temptation from Satan you know not from the individual but from Satan like Satan say well you're can finally grow it and all these things I felt a little bit of a temptation but I felt the Holy Spirit my heart that said a conviction I said I just can't do that now there's other reasons of course but I felt the Holy Spirit saying no don't allow this person to come amen now program said that's a prisoner when the Holy Spirit forbids you from doing something now I know the children have done that I know if some of my children told me this week when your flesh your flesh wants that take something your flesh wants to steal something right children or your flesh wants to say something but when you stop for that you become a prisoner to the Holy Spirit amen you want to lie you want to steal or you want to do something you shouldn't do when you stop from doing that and you actually obey the Holy Spirit now you know what it's like to be a prisoner a man God has kept you from leaving the protection of his word God's kept you from going out sinning and he's kept you in his divine presence he's kept you in His perfect will and now you know what it feels like oh I'm a prisoner to Jesus I don't even want to do what Jesus wants me to do hey man holiday oh yeah glory not sure and that's how you can experience it now you're not making decisions about who can come to church and and who can take communion and you're not making decisions about who to pray for maybe all the time or who to help financially or should you go should you travel to this place or that place but you can experience it in those ways with overcoming the flesh does that help children can you understand that when you turn down sin and you obey the word of God now you know what it's like to be a prisoner to Christ amen now brother have said this is one time Paul was a prisoner verse 5 and so were the churches established in the faith and increase in number daily now when they've gone throughout Phrygia which is west turkey and the region of Galatia which was east turkey and were four the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia which is further east so they were traveling west because the Holy Spirit said don't go east so they kept going they were in Galatia which was there in central Turkey and then free Gio was further west now look at verse seven after they were come to my show West Turkey so they kept coming west so from Galatia to Phrygia to my Xia they assay to go into by finial which was I'm sorry further west now notice the next part but the spirit suffered them not now by thinny I'm sorry by tenia was north Turkey so Church don't you want to be that sensitive that you're so sensitive to the Holy Spirit you know which direction to go amen so the Holy Spirit said don't go east and don't go north go west and that's how sensitive we want to be as Christians that will only go where God has called us to go and it might be something as simple as this you know we've had numerous people that have left the church that used to go to special meetings and different places and just going all over the place and and and I saw it was like a detriment to their their their spiritual growth and their attitude toward our church it kind of you know when they got to go to other churches that made them not enjoy our church so much and so see I wonder if that was a leadership with the Holy Spirit I wonder if they're following the actual leadership of the Holy Spirit and I thought because you know brother Branham says your home church is your post of duty and you just don't you know just don't go well I'll just go - I feel like go to other churches won't be nice to visit that church be nice to visit so-and-so that might seem nice but in reality we've got to have a leading of the Holy Spirit we've got to be a prisoner unto Christ amen and he was such a prisoner he knew the Holy Spirit said don't go east and don't go north I'm going west yeah under your verse 8 see that the holy spirit said don't go north the Holy Spirit said go west verse 9 I'm sorry verse 8 and they passing by meisje came down to choice which was even further west Turkey and a vision appeared to paw in the night and there's a man of Macedonia which was across a body of water and even further west which is near Greece so they're in Turkey and Paul sees a vision of a man that's in Macedonia which is a huge trip further west and the man prayed and said come over into Macedonian help us and after he'd seen the vision immediately he endeavoured to go into Macedonia surely gathering that the Lord had called for us to preach the gospel to them amen aren't you glad that God will give you dreams to direct you amen aren't you glad God will speak through preachers right to you God will use whatever method necessary in order to speak to you so Paul took this vision took this dream he said mine the Holy Spirit said no north no East I'm going west and then I have a dream of something the West saying come West and then so he says yes I'm following the leadership of Lord see the Lord will give you many different vindications right when you want to know God's will sure and you've got to say God give me two or three witnesses amen can I just tell a good testimony remember we talked about Hospital Simon was remember children are brothers Simon paid some money to get some people out of prison the this last week last couple weeks brother Simon paid some of his own money now he's entirely right now so you can't hear me preaching this I'm not I'm not preaching it to get his approval but it was a great testimony but a Simon paid a lot of money to get some people out of prison out of his own pocket he said I just felt let the Lord do that I said praise the Lord two weeks later somebody from another Church just felt led to the Lord they didn't know about it they felt letter Lord to send him a check for a lot of money and it fully covered all the money that he paid and this person has never sent him one set in his entire life and most taemin was rejoicing telling me that Simoni on the phone and he was saying I was led to the Lord to get those people out of prison he sacrificed his own money and got these people out of prison and then some pastor that never sent him any money before in the mail sent him all this money plus more to cover all the money that he paid to get them out of there amen a church that's a prisoner to the Lord Hey because there's getting the prisoners out of jail amen so they can serve Jesus Christ I just heard that testimony today so it's fresh on my heart that's what I want to share it with you if God leads you to do something God's going to give you numerous witnesses and then when you act on it God will bless you to do that because see you obeyed him you were a prisoner to him now the second example is in acts 16 Lydia verse 18 and but the RAM shows how Paul was again a prisoner but madam said this little fortune-teller one day Paul knowed he had power to cast the devil off the girl but he could only do it as God willed it day after day she found him crying out after him but one day the spirit gave him permission then he rebuked her the spear that was in her he know what it was to be a prisoner now this is real maturity right here verse 8 I'm sorry verse 16 Lydia 16 16 okay now that's the that's the woman with the spirit verse 17 the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are servants of the Most High God which showed unto us the way of salvation verse 18 and this did she many days now that's what brother day I'm showing why didn't Paul just cast the demon off for the first day it's because he was waiting on God to do it but Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour hey man so bono said and see he had to be a prisoner he had to wait until God told him to do it praise God now brother him said the same thing about Moses now he jumped into Moses but man said Moses was a complete prisoner in the chains of God's Word he was bound up only to thus sayeth the Lord amen hallelujah programs and Moses had to lose his intellectuals in order to find Christ to be a prisoner and when God got all the world beat out of him and all the mighty man that he was and stand the friends of that pillar of fire that day he was found just speechless didn't even couldn't even talk he said God had a prisoner then Amen I lead our church now you and I will be prisoners of Christ when we feel like we have nothing to say we only want to say what God wants us to say for children you'll be a prisoner when you only talk to your brothers and sisters as what would be the Word of God you won't you wouldn't tease your brothers and sisters right you wouldn't say anything ridiculous what but you're a prisoner when you only want to say pleasing things in the sight of God praise God so Moses was finally a prisoner when he said Lord I can't talk what about my stuttering see he was finally a prisoner and God said I'll speak for you he said Aaron will be your prophet and you'll be God to Pharaoh ha ha ha Amen hallelujah praise the Lord but I said oh if God can get him some prisoners like that that's when he can express the preeminence as you see he's got the man of the persons that he knows nothing but Christ amen Superman now reviews the first two purposes of God's mystery first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have preeminence 'as in his church which is his body the bride till he can have the preeminence to express himself through them and now third restore the kingdom back to Eden conditions so first has expressed himself in Jesus Christ second have preeminence in them in this bride the church and third bring everything back to eating conditions praise God that's right now I get here to this thought here okay I'm almost there now brother handbrakes to this thought about the Trinity what about have said therefore if any Trinitarian would just let yourself loose for a minute you can see the Father Son Holy Ghost is not three gods it's just three attributes of the same God its expression father he was wanted to be a father he was a father he was a son and he's the Holy Ghost and the father and the Holy Ghost is the same spirit don't you see it he said don't you get it not three gods the devil has told you them things to make an idolatry out of you amen see it's God expressed in three attributes to me Father to be Savior to be son to be healer is his expressions God expressed sin Jesus Christ who has both father son Holy Ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily now brother have says all that God was he poured into the Christ and all that was Christ he poured into the church the believers now he goes back to his first purpose let's read this here what's his first purpose now express himself as a son see that in him might draw the fullness of the Godhead bodily see all through the scripture that was his purpose then through the life of his son his cross the blood it says here of his cross that he might reconcile to himself a ride which is Eve ii ii they meant huh me know that were ii Eve the first Eve fell right but the second Eve won't fall praise God amen because her Adam won't be slothful the first Adam brother Graham said was slothful but the second Adam won't be because the second Adam is Jesus Christ amen that's right he says in God given a type like he gave Moses the same thing you didn't Adam and Eve and that those Christ and the bride he's the second Adam and the church is the second II but as long as the second Eve compromises against the isn't she doing the same thing the first evening so right that's why that's what the nominal churches are doing they're compromising on the word they'll they'll say anything like I had somebody emailed me this week and said said well you know I was we were emailing about women and preachers and they said well brother Jesse you know you know she said really nicely she said well you know some people have women preachers some don't and she said we just leave this up to the father and then the father will tell us what to do and I haven't written back yet because I'm at the time but I'm you know but I did write back to the people that voice of God so the voice of God people emailed me back and said we don't want to argue about it and I said well I'm not arguing about it I said I was just trying to start a discussion a nice discussion I said because it's dangerous to make brother branham every word he said thus saith the Lord I said that's idolatry brother Graham called it tommyrot and one of the most awfulest things that you can possibly do to see Christians we can't make excuses like well we don't want to argue but see that's an excuse to people I don't want to argue either but it's an excuse people are hiding behind the excuse if I don't want to argue what's hiding behind that is I don't want to admit that I'm wrong and that's what that woman did that's where I believe the other voice of God emails are doing they're hiding behind the excuse well we'll just pray about it and see what God says well we know what God says about women preachers God don't allow it and we know what the Bible says there's no one infallible except Jesus Christ amen but see they'll hide behind these things but we'll just pray about it or we don't want to argue what they're saying is they're scared to look at the truth but if they're born again they would know that though the Bible says the Holy Ghost leads you into all truth amen so you have to wonder what's the truth all women preachers or what's the truth on his every word brother Ram said thus saith the Lord you know if they'll wonder about it because the Bible said God will tell you all the truth hey man that's exactly right see but churches will compromise well they can have more time so they can have more members if they let women preach or they can have more money if they say every word brother Adam said was thus saith the Lord see they compromise on things like that and that's why our church is probably very small tonight it's because we don't want to compromise on anything we just want to keep all the work of God that's right I believe that now huh me know the Bible says the cross reconciled you to god it was the cross that brought you back to God let's go to Ephesians to Lydia verse 16 so in God's first purpose his son Jesus Christ he reconciled you back he bought you back amen hallelujah that he might reconcile both under God in one body by the cross let's say by the Cross ready by the cross the only way you can feel like a part of God the only way you feel like you can have peace with God is through the cross of Jesus Christ that's why I'm going to keep preaching that all the days that God will allow me to preach I'm going to keep reaching the cross and the blood of Jesus Christ because it's only through the cross that you have peace with God it's only through the cross that you'll feel the love of God it's only through the cross that you'll know you're a child of God amen the only way is to remember that old rugged cross haha thank the Lord brother and said that was God's first purpose to manifest himself in Jesus Christ to reconcile all of us unto Him praise God now program said he goes to this thought he said old now let's get to the closing thought here I'll try to close in the next 20 minutes or so better have said God has purpose that he hid the mystery from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and revealed it to the predestinated babes who were predestinated to receive it but RAM said that's the reason watch down through the age when the light hits some they turn away and it flashed away he said the great intellectuals and then priest standing there there was rabbis and great teachers authority like the different ones like Nicodemus was brother Ben preached on Sunday which is so beautiful and Nicodemus and them and the man polish and scholarship and he couldn't even understand it so the Bible says that God hid it from the Sanhedrin God hid it from them because they didn't want to see it they wouldn't believe it anyway in other words they wouldn't obey it that's right only the predestinated would believe the Word of God now I want to read to me what so far has been the most powerful quote in this sermon so far to me because it's helped me to understand predestination better so let me read this quote he says oh oh the great revelation now now to restore back his kinship or his children to bring them back now he had to let them get lost you understand it he had to let them sin put them on free more agency now here's the here's the statement right here God could not make them sin and remain God and then punished them for something he made them do all right so the words God cannot make someone sin God has not ever made anyone sin because if he has then he's going to punish them for something he made them do alright this means sin is a choice praise God and then this means salvation is a choice now to me church this brings a huge and necessary imbalance on predestination because a lot of times you know we hear so much about chosen before the foundation of the world chosen before the foundation world God chose me God chose me but church it's a balance it's a balance if God just chose you and didn't choose your neighbor right our neighbors that don't believe in God we have neighbors I invited them to over but they don't believe in God if God chose our house and not their house then God and God made them God made that choice that God's gonna punish them and send them to hell because he made them that way do you understand what I'm saying I wish I had the education to do it although I've got a master's degree but I said I don't have the education to do it because maybe my degree wasn't in public speaking or something like that so our neighbors that don't believe in other words God can't punish them and send them to hell if he made them go to hell so see what am I saying I'm saying this God could only predestinate by by looking and foreseeing what you would decide in other words God didn't make you choose him and God didn't make the sinner reject him are you with me now to me Church this brings the balance of predestination so many times it's I felt like many times I've heard a preach it's like well you didn't have a choice you didn't have a choice no it's all about choice are you with me it is all about choice predestination is all about your choice if it's not then God's going to punish people that he made to sin and that's not fair that's not just are you with me predestination is all about your choice right now amen hallelujah God cannot make the sinner sin and remain God and then punish them for something he made them do it's all about choice I know Jesus said you know I have you've not chosen me I've chosen you that's true but he chose based upon your what what he knew for knew your decision if not that he's choosing you just because he likes you better than the sinner and then God becomes a respecter of persons but how many no he's not God is not a respecter of persons and the Apple says after I read it to you again if you forgot it but the Bible said God would that all men be saved let me know that God would that all men be saved so this is the thought was so powerful when I heard I said oh praise the Lord this brings us the balance of predestination now why is this so important I'll tell you why because it makes your behavior tonight so important in other words whatever you choose tonight whatever you choose tomorrow God already knew you we're gonna prove it your choices in other words prove what you are Amen hallelujah you can't just say well God made me do this God made me backslider or God made me love sin no he didn't he gave everybody a fair chance and what you choose and if you overcome or not proves that God foresaw and you know he know you'd made that choice before the foundation of the world hallelujah so it's it makes this is why the balance on predestination is so important because it doesn't allow people to say well if I'm if I was meant to be in the rapture I guess I'll just go in the rapture it doesn't let you say that well if I was ordained to be bride I guess I God will make me bride and what are you doing they're just making excuse to be lazy instead of doing what the Bible says give diligence give all diligence to make your calling and election sure or amen see people in America don't want to be told you need to pray more or you need to read your Bible more or you need to come to church more they don't want to be told that but that's really what the Bible's saying if you are the elect of God then make it sure prove it to everybody show which side you're on amen let your faith not be dead but let your faith make your works glorify God because faith without works is dead anyone who says well I believe the message but doesn't live the life and isn't following more love of Jesus they don't believe the message because their works their lack of work shows that their faith is dead Amen hallelujah praise God amen that's nothing but the truth and children you're seeing it with some things that happen today people that choose to walk away from the word are just manifesting what God foresaw before the foundation of the world God is not ever going to lead anyone into sin God like Balaam he'll let you sin if you under sin but God is not going to lead you there praise the Lord see this is the balance God does not punish sinners for something he makes them knew you'd be unjust God does not make anybody sinned now look what the Bible says here let's go to 1st Peter 1 to Lydia first Peter 1:2 I've preached this over and over again over the years but I want to bring it to your attention again this is completely scriptural how many are elect elect means chosen how many are elect chosen you're elect according to what the foreknowledge of God the Father so the reason God has elected us to receive the message is because God's foreknowledge knew we would receive it praise God it's not God saying well I liked Naomi's family and the Smith family I like them but I don't like their neighbors I just hate them no that's that's not what it was God is loving heart he looked out at Akron in 2018 he thought who who would love me and he realized okay these people will love me so those are going to be my elect and because I know that I can orchestrate the events of their lives to receive the message to have a home church to glorify the Lord to obey more of the word of the Lord to manifest my presence to express myself what does a Christian look like in 2018 God will orchestrate all the events of our lives to show the world in Akron what a Christian looks like in 2018 amen hallelujah praise God but God wanted everybody to do that he wanted everybody to manifest the word but he knew he foreknew who would and who would not that's exactly right now here's a quote from other random when God I'm sorry but when he put man on partnership with him let's say that can we all say partnership partnership other man have said God put man on partner we're partners with him that means we have something to do remember that quote brother Branham says God is not gonna push you through a pike remember that quote children from years ago I haven't preached it for a while but I said God is not gonna push you through a pipe and then say hey you overcame because it was all God God just pushed you through oh you're an overcomer what God does is God but man said God wants us to receive the power of God to sit and let that power of God in us move us and direct us but we've got to make the decision to do it God's not gonna force us to be Christians because God's not the God of force God but Satan is the god of force Satan tries to force people to do things but God is not that God is gentle got a sweet got his kind got his patient God is loving God is long-suffering but he's not gonna force you to serve him he wants you to submit and when you submit then he'll take control praise God because you asked him to take control hallelujah that's why not pushing us through a pipe like God's forcing us through well I guess I'll believe the message I guess I'll go to church God didn't have to push you to go to church tonight yeah you wanted to come to church because you surrendered so many years ago you surrender said I want to go to church now I'm I took the Holy Spirit to lead you and help you to crucify your flesh but all those years ago when you surrendered God took control and God saw your choice and God honored your choice and now God is helping you keep your choice Amen hallelujah he put me in partnership with him then let the man act as a free more agency the same thing he's got you on today but Manston see you act any way you want to you're a free agent so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has to put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place see but everybody is on that same basis all right and the church says Lydia first Timothy 2:4 I'm gonna prove it to you God wants all men to be saved who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth did God want Judas saved or not yes God wanted you to save but did Judas want to be saved no Judas chose money over Christ he would rather have money rather serve money than serve Christ Lydia second Peter 3:9 this one says it even more plain God doesn't want anyone to perish God's not God's not like a Potter saying oil I'll make this Judas pot and I can't wait to burn this God is not would you do that if you had the power to make ceramic clay would you make something just so you can say oh I can't wait to break this it would do that if you're not like that how much more God's not like that the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward listen Church not willing that any God doesn't want anyone to perish but that all should come - that was a sermon from Sunday morning God wants everybody God doesn't want that God didn't see Judas God didn't want to hate he saw but God had to hate he saw because he foreknew what he was going to choose he foreknew it but God was not willing he God didn't want to work out that way but because of God's foreknowledge he had to do that go to Ezekiel 33 11 now is it this has struck me right now the Holy Spirit just struck this thought to me look what the Bible says Ezekiel 33 11 Biggio 33 11 saying to them as I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn the attorney from your evil ways for why will you die o house of Israel do you need help spelling it hunt okay alright ever look up there if you get I have no pleasure God thus saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked God did not say oh I'm really happy that Judas just hang himself I'm really happy about that God was not saying I'm really glad Pharaoh drowned in the in the sea God did it because he was fair and just and he gave judgment but God does not delight in that did he believe the Bible yeah God has no pleasure but you know what it just struck me about the Holy Spirit go to Isaiah 53 the Bible said it pleased the Lord to bruise him in that striking God wasn't pleased when the wicked died but God was pleased when Jesus died amen now that's divine love right there church as to my love it pleased the father to bruise him let's go to Isaiah 53 I just struck me there amen now that's to me that is a fresh understanding right there a fresh revelation verse 10 isaiah 53:10 you got it yeah that pleased the Lord to bruise him so it did not pleased God to see Judas commit suicide that did not please him but it did pleased him when Jesus Christ gave his life for all the sinners amen praise the Lord give me ten more minutes here so a church I hope you can see that we are on partnership with God God is not forcing you to be a Christian and I'm not gonna force my children either I mean I want them to be Christians but they've got to make the choice they've got to serve God when they get old enough the children can walk out just like we've seen other people walk out hey that's your choice God's not gonna force you to do it but I recommend with all my heart children give God make him your first choice amen serve God with all your heart save yourself from evil and sin and heartache and scars and regret and living with a broken heart save yourself from that and live holy unto God in other words live a happy life praise God right remember we saw that happy is the man who what loves pleasure or fears the Lord fears the Lord look at Austin Church or children look at Austin look how look how sad he was remember when I was sad he was he wasn't fearing the Lord now look look at us what should we do we should fear the Lord and you'll be happy if you fear the Lord amen look at Benjamin look at these ones we differ I'm not calling names on purpose but just that's coming to me look how look how they're not happy but if you fear God you'll be happy Hey amen but God's not gonna force you God God's not gonna force anybody because he's on partnership in other words man you've got a choice to make daughter you got a choice to make I'm not gonna force you to serve me but because I know what you've chosen I can mold and predestinate I can shape and I can plan and the Bible said God says I know the plans that I have for you amen these are good plans plans the prosper playing it plans to bless you well I didn't know that because he knew that Israel would seek God with all their hearts amen hallelujah since that I know the plans I have for you in Jeremiah 33 they're good plans plans of peace and plans of joy amen but he can't plan without partnership you've got a partner with him you got a place you got to shake God's hand you got partner yes Lord I will serve you yesterday I agree I'll give you all my all my life children I hope you do that the youngest age I'll give you give God all my life I'm gonna be happy giving God my whole life and say it was just wants to kill me I don't want to give anything to say it I want to give all the days of my life to Jesus Christ amen now program says this the Bible said gifts and callings are without repentance it's something that God by Sovereign Grace put into the church God does that himself it's in work and an act of God and by for knowledge he predestinate these things to happen see by foreknowledge because he has foreknowledge he can predetermine events now here's Beltran now as I say God is not willing that any one should perish but in the very beginning God knew who would be saved and who would perish for knowledge let him know that if he's the infinite God he's not willing that any should perish but he knew from the beginning he knew every fly flee every person that would ever be on the earth he knew them before the foundation of world because he's uh because he's infinite amen so can everyone understand that brother man I'm saying God is not forcing anybody be saved but he has foreknowledge of who's going to be saved alright now let me find this next one here this is mark of the beast 1961 and if he's infinite he knowed all things from the beginning and so therefore he could elect not because he wanted to but because his foreknowledge let him know who would be and who would not be an even heaven hallelujah did you catch that let me read it again let me make this year God could elect not because he wanted to but because as for now let's let him know who would and who would not be does that help God did not choose and say well I like brother so-and-so I like sister so-and-so I don't like them so much so I'm gonna choose them and not them go dad said God did not choose based upon what he wanted God chose based upon who he knew would choose him I hope that helps somebody and what it does as I said earlier what it does is it magnifies your choice tonight it magnifies the choice that you're gonna make tomorrow about serving God God is not going to force you but the choices you make tonight the choices you make the choices Lord willing if God tells you make next year in 2019 the choices you make are just going to reveal what God already saw before the foundation of the world God's not choosing because oh I want this person I like their hairstyle or like I like their broad shoulders or like I like that woman's smile you know I like that more than the other woman no he's not choosing because he wants to he's choosing based upon what he for knows you're gonna choose that's right he said Jesus came by the foreknowledge of God that knowing that Jesus came to redeem to buy back the church but the preachers like going to the pond and throwing the net and pulling it in the kingdom of God is like an ax man that take a net and went to the seashore when he pulled in he had water spiders snakes serpent frogs and everything else but he had to fish amen so preachers we don't we just throw the net out and whoever comes comes God knows what's in the net amen huh me know that parable that's the seventh and final parable that Jesus told the seventh parable is the dragnet the Bible says that they throw out the net they pull it in and then the angels on the shore are separating the differ kind some get burned and some get kept the Angels know many times we don't know right but the Angels the Bible says will separate just like the wheat and tares members said Jesus says let them both go together until harvest lest you uproot the tares with the wheat or the wheat with the tears rather same thing God's gonna let both grow together and God will determine God will show and prove who is on which side I'm gonna be on the Lord's side hallelujah alright now let me read him one more quote here because I'm finishing up y'all watch oh this is 1961 Abraham and his seed after him jesus said no man could come to the Father except my father draws him and all the father's give me will come that's the reason you just preach the gospel it's plainness yet the elected sheep of God would hear that and catch it real quick and they'll believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost where others will walk away and make fun of it because they were elected to hear it that's all see so you see now why the church itself is an elected and predestinated by God now he says this he says he said the preet he said the word predestination isn't good for the people so here's what he says now to us church it doesn't stumble us I hope I hope the word predestinate doesn't stumble you because you've got you you've got the word god predestinate after he for knows so because god foreknows then he predestinate not the other way around but rancidity better if we use it like this that it was bye for now as God by his foreknowledge could predestinate to his own glory now here's our man says God didn't say now I'm gonna choose you but I'm gonna send you to hell and I'm gonna choose you and send you to hell brother said that wasn't God's idea amen hallelujah that was not God's idea well I'm gonna choose Jesse but I'm gonna send his neighbor to hell because I like Jesse and I don't like the neighbor that was not God's idea he said that wasn't God's idea he wanted all of us to come to heaven but being God he foreknew who would come and who would not come he said that clears up Romans 9 with Jacob and Esau God knew Jacob would want to wrestle with the angel and he would want to walk differently amen hallelujah God also for knew that Esau we want to marry different women right and Esau would want to make his parents mad and marry us a sinner outside of the faith God foreknew that and so God could predestinate based upon those things that he knew in the harvest time 1964 brother Branham says this he says God being omniscient knowing all things that he can be present everywhere because that's the way he predestination us by foreknowledge not because he desired that this person should be saving this one should be lost but he knew who would be lost and who would be saved Amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord the church this is why it makes me so so thankful that we keep choosing God over and over again as the years go by we should not choose the back side on God and give God less we should choose to give God more because whatever we choose will prove what God knew about us before the foundation of the world God doesn't like I said God doesn't want to see God doesn't want to see our church save more than he does the Pentecostal church does everyone understand it's not that God loves us more than the Catholic Church down the street that's not it God didn't choose it like that God based upon who would want to really live the truth who would want to know a real living God amen who would really want to believe the Bible who would want to know the truth of the word of God and God knew who would want that and so then God delivered the truth to them God delivered the truth to you ha ha ha hey man praise God in that beautiful church now that's beautiful let's say into our feet here then I'll just close with that God predestinate sus by foreknowledge not because he desired that this person should be saved or this one should be lost but he knew who would be lost and who would be saved I'm gonna stop right there Lord willing next time maybe Sunday we'll see what the Lord has for us or just way the way I feel led but lord willing on Sunday I want to really preach that thought about I want to preach about the thought where you came from you came from the mind of God and brother Branham said but let me just give you a little preview so that huh this will help stir up your minds and as you listen to brother Branham these next few days maybe you'll catch something brother Branham said the the doctrine of the pre-existence of souls was wrong how many know that brother have said the Mormon doctrine they believe that your soul pre-existed like as a separate body before you came to earth brother man said that's wrong brother man also said it was wrong that so after you die your souls go to sleep and you're just you're just your soul just stays than the grave so brother I'm cleared up both both false doctrines the one about before this life and the one after your life amen hallelujah he cleared up the before and the after praise God so what are you trying to say brother yes I'm trying to say this you did not exist as a person before you were in this life you existed in the mind of God you were a thought of God and that thought was expressed herein the 18 crazy or whenever you came on the scene right or Genevieve OHS 2018 for me it was 1980 2004 2006 2009 when you come on the scene you were not and I know this will go against some people's doctrine well I better not get there but I just better wait on that but Church you you were in the mind of God brother Ram said you went from a thought to a flesh body now after this should go to theophany and then glorified body her brother have said Jesus was thought theophany flesh then glorified body amen so I just want to lay that in there because this all ties in together with predestination you were in the thoughts of God and God manifested you on this on this earth at this time now come now hope tonight Church that wasn't too deep or anything like that I'm just had a burden you know to preach the truth about predestination I think many times it's it's misrepresented like they put it all on God like well God just he just he just called me to be this way I guess I always be this way because God called me to be this way who was I talking to this week I'm starting to somebody this week and they told me that their that's what their their friend who knows the message that's what they say well I guess how if God wants me to go in the rapture I'll go in the rapture and that's the wrong attitude the Bible says whosoever wants to drink a living water let him come and drink I don't know yeah amen and what is the living water the baptism of the Holy Ghost and what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the token for the rapture amen so God's inviting everybody to come and drink of the Living Waters God's inviting everybody the rapture and only those that want to go are the ones that are gonna go amen there's not going to be one person left behind that really wants to go in the rapture because all that wanna go can go praise the Lord how many want to go in the rapture huh then you make the choice tonight and say Lord I'll lay everything aside let me just be a prisoner to do the will of God so I can go in the rapture praise the Lord let's just pray together father in heaven we thank you for your word tonight Lord God or I trusted in and go too high over the heads or hope it wasn't too simple Lord God and it just was it moving enough Florida I hope it stirred the people's hearts Lord so that they can see their partnership with you God you didn't choose us because you liked us more or you want us to go to heaven but you want to send denominations to hell that's not what you did Lord God you don't rejoice when anyone's alone as we saw from the scripture you're not willing that any should perish can go to hell yet millions and billions do go to hell [Music] you didn't say I'm going to choose you Lord in fact what you did you said I'm gonna see who would choose me amen amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord I'm so glad Lord I chose you father you're so glad Lord I chose you Lord those many years ago what an amazing choice Lord God what a eternal choice it was Lord you wanted to partner with me and you would ordained it that the gospel would come to me and each one of us and you knew that I'd received the Lord Lord thank you Lord for letting us choose you dear God hallelujah lord help us to really see this truth Lord God Lord as I said that it will motivate us to be diligent not be lazy lukewarm Christians nor because those are the kind you spew out of your mouth a half-hearted message believer makes you want to throw up Lord it makes you sick someone that will choose you sometimes but not every time some services but not every service some days but not every day it just makes you sick or we don't want to make you sick we want to make you rejoice we want to make you happy Lord God we want to please your Shepards heart we want to please your husband's heart by choosing you every day we're done thank you Lord as Joshua told the people as he died was getting close to dying off the scene he said choose you this day whom you will serve Elisha said the same thing choose which side you're gonna be on who's on the Lord's side or it's a choice and if you knew we'd make that choice more than you would ordained and predestinated everything Lord to work out for your glory if you do not delight in people parachute you do not make a vessel just to destroy it and get pleasure you do not force people to worship you as your Provost said Lord if we raise our hands we break all the gravity laws that's holding our hands down we did it [Music] because we have a partnership with you we have something we can do we can get on our knees we can choose to crucify the flesh mortify the deeds of the flesh and bring these bodies in this objection that's something we can do Lord God and the Lord it's because that one day many years ago we said we surrender fully we want to be a prisoner take control I make Jesus Christ my choice Lord you've been faithful to lead us and guide us ever since we made that choice for God thank you lord thank you for answering our prayers and helping us to be overcomers you're not pushing us through this Lord God where it's you're forcing us but Lord we're allowing you to do it because we love you we trust you you're our Creator you're our God our husband you're the lover of our souls thank you lord help us to make the choice tonight I must make the choice every day to serve you Lord God and to be a prisoner for Jesus Christ but I pray for everyone here I don't have to ask them to raise their hands tonight but Lord for all those who want to be prisoners I pray you help with more God if they don't want to be lord I just pray that they feel ashamed themselves they want to be a prisoner Lord God and they want you to vindicate them as Christians Lord God Granite Lord God we give you thanks on this Thanksgiving Day Lord in tomorrow's 17 years from the day when you predestinated I would hear the message on the Serpent's seat thank

there was very few who actually wanted to keep that who wanted the love wanted to be a partner with Almighty God the church I think that's because the conditions are so strong you've got to lose your
