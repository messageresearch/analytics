[20:49] [Music]
[20:56] he's studying preacher until this last
[22:26] week what okay so it's been about four
[22:38] years course we read through the church
[22:51] [Music]
[22:53] so I think there's numerous scriptures
[22:57] but I think let's go to let me go down
[23:01] here Luke 16 let's just start with there
[23:05] the rich man and Lazarus the parable
[23:07] there let's just look there because the
[23:12] one thing that was surprising to me was
[23:14] to find out that hell was different from
[23:16] the lake of fire that was a tremendous
[23:20] revelation to me so Luke 1622
[23:38] all right so that's Luke 1622 and for
[23:41] times sake like I said we'll just read
[23:42] up let's just read twenty two twenty
[23:47] three already twenty two and then we can
[23:49] all read three for twenty three rather
[23:52] Luke 1622 I'll read this by myself
[23:55] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[23:56] and was carried by the Angels into
[23:58] Abraham's bosom and the rich man also
[24:01] died and was buried let's all read
[24:03] twenty three one two three and in how he
[24:06] lifted up his eyes being in torments and
[24:10] seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in
[24:13] his bosom amen let's have a word of
[24:15] Prayer ever need on your heart just make
[24:16] it on unto the Lord here tonight
[24:18] Heavenly Father were gathered humbly
[24:20] Lord but Lord with boldness and
[24:22] gratitude and Thanksgiving for your holy
[24:25] spirit dear God we thank you for your
[24:27] love and your mercy towards us take this
[24:31] word and we understand it better
[24:33] Lord and this would be a blessing to the
[24:34] Saints Lord I know the young ones need
[24:36] it Lord and it was a great refresher for
[24:38] me Lord God so I pray Lord to be a great
[24:40] blessing to everybody so Lord we ask
[24:42] that your divine presence will be with
[24:44] us open hearts open minds in Jesus
[24:47] Christ's name the church said amen god
[24:49] bless you be in see the praise god I'm
[24:52] gonna get a few tissues
[25:05] yeah it's that time of year you know the
[25:07] germs come all around and you got a I'm
[25:10] battling germs you know I'm gargling
[25:11] with salt water and everything you know
[25:13] so we'll get the victory thank the Lord
[25:18] for His grace now to two great points I
[25:21] just want to make just from the outset
[25:23] of this you know even today I may get
[25:25] numerous emails there's different people
[25:26] listening in from all over the place you
[25:27] know and you know I think I'll just
[25:33] start off by saying there's two great
[25:34] revelations that come in this teaching
[25:37] that I found you know when someone first
[25:41] right away says or someone hears Oh
[25:43] hell's not eternal usually they they're
[25:46] shocked but there's two great
[25:48] revelations that I found that actually
[25:51] you know give a lot of comfort to to
[25:54] God's people the first is God's mercy
[25:57] that God would not punish someone
[26:00] eternally for just a few decades of sin
[26:05] you know it would be so be so cruel for
[26:08] God to send someone and and punish them
[26:12] without end for let's say ten fifteen
[26:16] you know fifty at the most a hundred
[26:19] years of wickedness and how how cruel
[26:23] that would be for a God to punish them
[26:25] without end for that it just doesn't
[26:28] seem doesn't seem like the merciful
[26:30] heart of God
[26:31] you'd be surprised hurts the you know
[26:33] I've gone youtube a lot to listen to
[26:35] sermons you know and the the men that
[26:37] are like really well-known that believe
[26:38] that you'd be surprised the well maybe
[26:41] you wouldn't be the the doctors of
[26:45] divinity and the smart men that teach
[26:47] that and believe that that hell is
[26:51] eternal and God is eternally gonna
[26:53] punish people you'd be some you wouldn't
[26:55] maybe it wouldn't be surprised but I was
[26:57] surprised second the second revelation
[27:00] is that this doctrine emphasizes that
[27:03] eternal life is a person and not a
[27:06] location so those are the two great
[27:09] revelations that come out of this
[27:10] teaching that I have found of course
[27:12] there's probably more I think a third is
[27:15] what I'm going to get into at the
[27:16] and is that God is gonna share this
[27:18] eternal life with plants and animals
[27:22] that's quite striking because he's
[27:26] taking everything back to the Garden of
[27:27] Eden and so God is gonna share this
[27:31] eternal life with animals and ladies
[27:34] it's just it it's a little bit a little
[27:37] bit mind-blowing for our highs but
[27:40] what's that yeah it's good thought yeah
[27:43] I came to me this week I was like wow oh
[27:44] yeah maybe that worm can live eternally
[27:46] because we'll get to that a little bit
[27:48] you know because the horses are gonna
[27:50] live eternally the Tree of Life is gonna
[27:53] be a turner off the line lamb I mean
[27:55] that starts the Millennium that's gonna
[27:57] carry over so God is actually gonna
[27:59] share his eternal life with his creation
[28:01] which wasn't that's so merciful isn't it
[28:03] that's so merciful that he's gonna let
[28:06] them live eternally you know so let's
[28:09] look here now the purpose this is a show
[28:14] that unbelievers will not burn eternally
[28:16] without end in the lake of fire I'm
[28:18] reading off my script here for this next
[28:20] YouTube you know I'm probably recorded
[28:21] tomorrow morning
[28:22] unless I start shout and scream and lose
[28:24] my voice here tonight by the grace of
[28:27] Lord cuz I gotta have some voice so to
[28:29] summarize this briefly for those who
[28:31] maybe they'll listen to the beginning
[28:32] but not the end unbelievers cannot burn
[28:35] or suffer torment for eternity because
[28:37] they do not possess eternal life because
[28:41] eternal life is God's Spirit eternal
[28:44] life is a person eternal life is God
[28:48] because Jesus said God is a spirit
[28:50] according to John 4:24 Lydia can you
[28:52] pull it up there John 4:24 so we'll show
[28:57] it later but God's Spirit is the only
[28:58] spirit with eternal life it is the only
[29:01] one that has eternal life and here's
[29:05] what I was mentioned this morning which
[29:06] has opened up to me a little bit more -
[29:08] I never thought about it unbelievers may
[29:10] suffer in Hell right now because hell is
[29:13] a prison house and they may suffer for
[29:15] thousands brother Graham said maybe even
[29:17] Millions
[29:18] he may let them do that but it will not
[29:22] last eternally and because after the
[29:26] white throne judgment unbelievers may be
[29:28] tormented in the lake of fire
[29:30] for many years but at some point they'll
[29:35] be annihilated and done away with
[29:36] because they rejected the person of
[29:38] eternal life the Lord Jesus Christ God's
[29:41] to merciful and loving to require
[29:43] unbelievers to suffer an eternal number
[29:46] of years without end for only disobeying
[29:48] for one lifetime solidia pull up there
[29:51] John 4:24 God is a spirit and they that
[29:55] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[29:56] and truth so God is a spirit and that
[29:59] spirit is immortal eternal it's eternal
[30:02] life praise God now here's a great
[30:04] statement I'm just gonna I'm gonna
[30:06] reword brother Graham statement cuz he
[30:07] says it in the church age book I'll just
[30:09] read it from the church in you book now
[30:11] if a sinner is going to go to hell and
[30:13] then suffer the same amount of time as
[30:16] you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven
[30:18] then he has the same kind of life you
[30:20] have already in that great I just that
[30:25] was beautiful out my hats I'm gonna put
[30:27] that right on YouTube they need to hear
[30:29] that happen so you know then what then
[30:33] what good is the Holy Ghost if a sinner
[30:35] is gonna burn eternally what good is the
[30:37] Holy Ghost cuz I'm gonna live eternally
[30:39] so they're gonna be turtley too but in
[30:42] the reality we know the Holy Ghost is
[30:44] the only form of eternal life the human
[30:46] soul as we said this morning the soul is
[30:48] the nature of the Spirit that the human
[30:50] spirit can live a very long time it's
[30:53] already you know the oldest ones have
[30:54] already lived 6,000 years right nothing
[30:57] about the demons the demons have already
[30:58] lived many many many years who knows
[31:01] maybe millions if not trillions because
[31:04] their spirit was made to be a
[31:06] supernatural being but that doesn't mean
[31:09] because it that doesn't mean it can't be
[31:10] destroyed though if God created it God
[31:12] can destroy it so it's important to
[31:16] emphasize that if the sinner is gonna
[31:19] burn eternally then he's already got the
[31:20] same life you have but we know he
[31:22] doesn't Amen because the Bible said
[31:25] murderers do not possess eternal life
[31:27] let's read that in first John I believe
[31:28] it's first John three no murderer has
[31:31] eternal life I'm just gonna pull it up
[31:33] here because yeah three fifteen yeah
[31:38] first John 3:15 well let's just go to 14
[31:43] for
[31:44] John 3:14 we know that we pass from
[31:46] death unto life because we love the
[31:49] Brethren see if we should love each
[31:52] other so much right that we always want
[31:56] to help one another we always want to be
[31:57] with one another that's how I know I
[32:00] pass from death unto life
[32:01] I love God's people so that's why John
[32:03] will later say in the same book they
[32:05] went out from us because they were not
[32:07] of us
[32:08] so see the church membership peoples
[32:10] make the light think of that but I've
[32:12] always God's always put on my heart it's
[32:14] a very important thing being a Holy
[32:17] Ghost fill member of a church being
[32:19] faithful to church right and loving the
[32:22] people in your church he that loveth not
[32:24] his brother abideth and death see he's
[32:27] see we're currently abiding in life
[32:29] they're abiding in death whosoever hath
[32:33] his or hated his brother as a murder and
[32:35] ye know that no murderer hath eternal
[32:38] life abiding in him amen see it's plain
[32:41] by the scripture no murder person who
[32:44] had confessed or I'm sorry with
[32:45] unconfessed sin has eternal life you
[32:47] don't have it so you can't burn
[32:49] eternally if you don't have eternal life
[32:52] so very plain scriptures there we're
[32:56] starting with now let's again show how
[32:58] hell and the lake of fire not the same
[33:01] thing hell of course we read that in
[33:04] Luke 16 hell is the prison house so
[33:07] let's read that in first Peter 3:18
[33:09] Lydia 1st Peter 3:18 this is good for
[33:11] the children because they'll wait to see
[33:12] this where's Haven okay there's acacia
[33:15] there's all right there first Peter 3:18
[33:19] I want them to see this we often use
[33:22] this like we said this morning with the
[33:23] resurrection and how Christ preached to
[33:25] the spirits in prison Christ went to
[33:27] hell in the theophany form right with
[33:29] his theophany and then preached to other
[33:31] theophanies for Christ also hath once
[33:36] suffered for sins the just for the
[33:39] unjust that he might bring us to God
[33:40] being put to death in the flesh but
[33:43] quickened by the spirit by which also he
[33:46] went and preached unto the spirits and
[33:48] prison so there it is he went preach
[33:51] this appears in prison which sometime
[33:53] were disobedient when once the
[33:54] long-suffering of God waited the days of
[33:56] Noah while the ark was a preparing where
[33:58] a few that is eight souls were saved by
[34:01] water so prison is another name for Hell
[34:05] okay because he'll of course means the
[34:08] grave we know brother ma'am and the
[34:09] Greek teaches that the grave so we know
[34:12] there's a natural grade but there has to
[34:14] be a place for this the spirit a
[34:16] spiritual grave for the souls and
[34:18] spirits of men and the Bible says right
[34:20] here he went preached to the spirits in
[34:22] prison so the spirit of course remember
[34:24] the soul is the nature of the spirit so
[34:25] those spirits are down there of the
[34:28] unbelievers and Jesus went and preached
[34:30] to them sort of other words Jesus went
[34:32] to hell and preached to them for and
[34:35] rebuke them for disobeying Noah praise
[34:38] God so prison house and the prison is
[34:42] another word for hell and it's located
[34:44] in the heart of the earth that they pull
[34:45] up Matthew 12:40 it's in the heart of
[34:48] the earth now as you're turning there
[34:54] here's a real deep thought now this is a
[34:56] new thought I never had before so Jose
[34:57] and some of you Wendy
[34:59] here's some good here's a good thought
[35:00] for you when Jesus resurrected I'm just
[35:03] saying this I don't know if he brought
[35:04] up all the Old Testament Saints because
[35:07] the Bible and he says many of the Saints
[35:09] and brother ma'am emphasizes not all
[35:11] many so I'm just saying there may be
[35:15] some Old Testament Saints like we would
[35:18] say saw those are that were just barely
[35:19] saved
[35:20] lot they may be still down in what used
[35:25] to be a Rams bosom their spirits have to
[35:28] be somewhere and the spirits think maybe
[35:30] that maybe Jesus might have brought all
[35:31] of them and maybe just let some of them
[35:32] maybe just let the really wise ones
[35:34] resurrect but I'm just going out on a
[35:37] limb here was because the Bible said
[35:40] that the souls under the altar were up
[35:42] in heaven the Jews from the Holocaust
[35:43] days right
[35:45] so there's they the Jews from the
[35:48] Holocaust days they weren't born again
[35:50] but yet they went up not down and they
[35:53] didn't have the baptism the Holy Ghost
[35:55] so that's another thought like it's
[35:57] interesting I don't know if all the Old
[35:59] Testament Saints came up or not I don't
[36:01] know but it's a that's a deep thought
[36:03] and that's about as deep as I'm going on
[36:06] that subject right now so let me know
[36:07] afterwards if you got a good thought on
[36:08] that you do okay good
[36:12] let's talk about that afterwards but
[36:15] here the Bible said for as Jonas is in
[36:17] the three days and three nights in the
[36:19] whales belly so this shall the Son of
[36:20] Man be three days and three nights in
[36:24] the heart of the earth so hell is in the
[36:29] heart of the earth and Jesus descended
[36:32] down there and preached unto them and
[36:34] then the Bible said he led captivity
[36:36] captive we're familiar with that most of
[36:37] the children are aware of that
[36:41] Ephesians 4:9 Lydia's you can pull up
[36:43] there now he that ascended but what is
[36:45] it but he also descended first into the
[36:47] lower parts of the earth so we could
[36:49] call it hell prison house lower parts of
[36:52] the earth the heart of the earth the
[36:54] Bible describes it in numerous ways now
[36:58] while he was down there he took the keys
[36:59] of death and hell because Satan had
[37:03] rights over all the sinners up to that
[37:05] point he could keep them down in the
[37:07] heart of the earth
[37:08] he had rights because Adam was a ruler
[37:10] of the earth but when Adam when Adam
[37:13] fell and purposely sinned on purpose
[37:15] he lost his Dominion and Satan took the
[37:18] Dominion because the Bible said Who am
[37:20] ever your overcome by or held in bondage
[37:22] under that person right that's in 2nd
[37:25] Peter chapter 2 verse 9 I believe I'm
[37:27] not mistaken so because Adam was
[37:29] willingly overcome by Satan then he
[37:32] threw all mankind into slavery to the
[37:34] devil in Hell right so they're all under
[37:38] there Satan's got a hold on them he's
[37:41] got the power of death and that's why
[37:43] that Witch of Endor could pull up
[37:44] spirits because there was no blood of
[37:47] Christ to protect them yeah because
[37:49] Satan had power he had the power of
[37:50] death and that woman being anointed with
[37:52] the spirit the evil spirits she could
[37:55] access with Satan's help she can access
[37:57] those souls my but when Jesus went down
[38:03] his head this morning he paid the price
[38:05] of all the sins and he was worthy to
[38:08] take the keys back amen
[38:10] in other words he'd lived a holy life
[38:12] and so Satan couldn't pin him down and
[38:15] said look I got you jesus said I got you
[38:17] I defeated you and I'm taking those back
[38:20] because I'm a righteous one hallelujah I
[38:23] was an innocent one kill for the guilt
[38:26] praise God and I overcome so he took the
[38:28] keys of death in hell and then through
[38:30] that he could he could call all these
[38:33] Saints and all Brahimi's bosom call them
[38:35] up to the Earth's surface and resurrect
[38:38] them revelation 1:18 Lydia just pull it
[38:41] up so everybody especially the young
[38:42] ones can see it Haven in a case you
[38:44] there everybody can see it I don't know
[38:46] if I taking Malachi and Lydia through
[38:47] this study or not have I just in the
[38:50] church age book revelation 1:18 I am he
[38:55] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[38:57] Alive for evermore and have the keys of
[38:59] hell and of death jesus went down lived
[39:04] a holy life and he had authority and
[39:05] power to take those keys back praise God
[39:10] okay and Matthew 27:51 Lydia let's read
[39:15] about the resurrection he first
[39:17] descended and then he ascended so he
[39:21] went down to hell for us that we don't
[39:23] have to go to hell praise God amen
[39:26] thank you Jesus 27:51 and behold the
[39:30] veil the temple was rent in twain from
[39:31] top to the bottom and the earth did
[39:33] quake and the rocks rent and the grace
[39:35] were open in many bodies of the saints
[39:37] which slept see many for his resume
[39:40] into the holy city and appeared unto
[39:42] many so see not all of course many so
[39:45] that would mean Isis were the wise
[39:46] virgins of their day we're resurrected I
[39:47] imagine they'd have to be and but the
[39:51] foolish it doesn't look like were
[39:52] because the Bible just has many not all
[39:56] all right now I just want to show this
[40:02] though - let's go back to Luke 16 verse
[40:05] 23 this is a point I want to make - when
[40:11] sinners die they go to the prison house
[40:13] in the heart of the earth or hell and
[40:15] there is a level of torment right just
[40:19] like I you know I have a couple of
[40:21] friends that have been in prison before
[40:22] I got one in prison or person right now
[40:24] it's torment he's got to battle that
[40:26] because there's nothing to do really
[40:29] there's no freedom your your your slave
[40:32] and it's just mental torment and he
[40:36] always tells me you got to stay positive
[40:37] he said you got to you got to speak
[40:39] positive things or I'll she'll go crazy
[40:40] in there cuz he's been in there 10 years
[40:43] seeing hell he lifted up his eyes being
[40:46] in torments and seeth Abraham afar off
[40:49] and Lazarus in his bosom next verse
[40:52] there's a fire there - and he cried
[40:55] saying father Abraham have mercy on me
[40:56] and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip
[40:57] of his finger in water and cool my
[40:59] tongue for I am tormented in this flame
[41:02] so he's in a flame and he just wants
[41:05] water right just like today people in
[41:08] prison just want to be free they just
[41:10] like my friend told me I just want to be
[41:12] around nobody cuz he's been in there 10
[41:14] years he's always around somebody no no
[41:16] personal space see we take that for
[41:19] granted don't we then you can lock
[41:21] yourself in your room and just have
[41:22] peace and quiet they can't do that in
[41:25] prison because prison is torment it's
[41:28] made to be that way it's supposed to be
[41:30] that way it's supposed to be punishment
[41:31] so here we see there's a level of
[41:34] torment in hell but it's not the same
[41:36] type of torment that'll be in the lake
[41:38] of fire okay and notice
[41:48] has his human spirit see a lot of people
[41:51] misunderstand that quote brother Ram
[41:52] said when you die your spirit breaks up
[41:54] they they kind of misunderstand that
[41:56] because this man still has his human
[41:59] spirit okay go down to verse 27 Lydia I
[42:02] think that's it yeah cuz he say he said
[42:08] won't you send Lazarus back up to my
[42:11] brother so they can be saved and what
[42:13] isn't that next verse verse 28 what is
[42:17] Abraham's I'm sorry next 1:29 they have
[42:22] Moses and the prophets let them hear
[42:23] them to see he's he still got his
[42:26] insincere mind he still he's still
[42:29] trying to figure things out with his
[42:30] human spirit so his human spirit didn't
[42:32] break up like like we think of that
[42:33] means it may mean something else like it
[42:35] may break up from your body that's maybe
[42:37] what it means but it doesn't like vanish
[42:40] because here a man's in hell and he
[42:43] still has his wrong thinking and under
[42:46] the fifth seal the Jews are crying out
[42:48] for vengeance well that's not the right
[42:49] attitude but their spirits aren't those
[42:52] spirits aren't the right spirits because
[42:55] they want revenge that's the wrong
[42:57] spirit vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord
[43:01] so see the human spirit and soul stay
[43:03] together until the white throne judgment
[43:06] then they get cast like a fire and then
[43:07] its destruction annihilation time and
[43:11] God lets them keep their thinking
[43:12] because that's their character they
[43:14] chose the evil character but we choose
[43:16] godly character amen that's the
[43:18] character we're taking with us
[43:19] hallelujah now now go to Revelation 20
[43:24] verse 13 let's read this now you'll hear
[43:28] you'll see here this was the scriptures
[43:29] I did it for me death and Hell will be
[43:32] cast into the lake of fire I don't know
[43:35] this part I don't understand either I
[43:36] don't know how that how does hell in the
[43:40] heart of the earth get cast and lake of
[43:41] fire
[43:42] I'm not sure about that I'm not sure I
[43:44] don't know how to explain that to the
[43:46] church but all's I know whatever
[43:48] location that is God somehow gonna take
[43:51] it out of the earth and throwed burn it
[43:53] in like a fire I don't know verse twenty
[43:57] thirteen revelation twenty thirteen and
[44:00] this
[44:00] gave up the Dead which were in it and
[44:02] death and he'll delivered up the Dead
[44:04] which were in them and they were judged
[44:06] every man according to their works oh
[44:08] look he'll has to obey the word right
[44:10] the word says deliver up every soul and
[44:13] so he'll obeys this had this I don't
[44:17] know this location or this hole this
[44:18] prison house has to obey and so it sends
[44:21] all the souls to the white throne
[44:22] judgment but then in verse fourteen
[44:25] death and he'll were cast a lake of fire
[44:28] this is the second death so see hell is
[44:33] not eternal and sinners will not be
[44:39] tormented in hell eternally
[44:45] so I hope that's clear now go Lydia
[44:48] Matthew 25:41 now next thought this is
[44:55] the next section the first section is we
[44:58] just went through a hell in the lake of
[44:59] fire kind of defining them the second
[45:01] section is that hell had a beginning but
[45:03] God's children do not God and his
[45:06] children do not have a beginning in the
[45:12] soul that's what I'm talking about
[45:16] so see in Matthew 25:41 hell was
[45:19] prepared or had a beginning so that
[45:22] means anything that had a beginning has
[45:24] to have an ending so the Bible said then
[45:28] he shall say to them on left hand depart
[45:29] from me ye cursed into everlasting fire
[45:31] prepared for the devil and his angels
[45:34] now I'm quoting the church age book now
[45:36] if it was prepared then it wasn't
[45:38] without a beginning it had if it had a
[45:40] beginning then it can't be eternal
[45:42] praise God now the beautiful part is
[45:48] that the Bible said Melchizedek never
[45:51] had a beginning or an ending so Hebrews
[45:55] 7 3 I thank the Lord for the revelation
[45:57] of this message amen Hebrews 7 3
[46:01] Melchizedek without father without
[46:02] mother without descent having neither
[46:04] beginning of days nor the end of life
[46:06] yeah there it is hat neither having
[46:09] neither beginning of days so here's a
[46:12] man who comes down you're guy
[46:14] come down earth he pulls on all these
[46:15] atoms and puts on a flesh body and the
[46:17] Bible said he never had a beginning
[46:20] hallelujah nor an end of life amen
[46:23] because it's speaking of the life
[46:25] underneath that flesh same thing for you
[46:27] and I praise God
[46:28] same thing for you not the life that's
[46:31] behind this flesh never had a beginning
[46:33] so it will never have an ending
[46:35] hallelujah now here is the scripture
[46:38] beautiful first Timothy 6:15 this proves
[46:41] there's only one type of eternal life
[46:44] and that's God's life first Timothy 6:15
[46:48] which in his times he shall show who is
[46:51] the blessed and only potentate the king
[46:53] of kings and Lord of lords here is who
[46:56] only hath immortality amen see Satan
[47:01] doesn't have immortality right
[47:02] the evil wicked side does not end in
[47:05] mortality but only God has that the
[47:07] Bible said who only hath immortality
[47:09] dwelling in the light because he's an
[47:12] invisible spirit which no man can
[47:14] approach unto whom no man hath seen nor
[47:17] can see to whom be honor and power
[47:19] everlasting amen
[47:20] there's a scripture that nails it down
[47:22] only he's the only one with eternal life
[47:25] praise God the way I said there's only
[47:29] one kind of eternal life God has it if
[47:31] we have God we have eternal life in and
[47:34] through him he said see that word
[47:37] eternal or everlasting so when you see
[47:40] that everlasting or eternal he said they
[47:42] can be applied in many various ways but
[47:45] when it applies to God being what he is
[47:48] it has one meeting it is the duration of
[47:50] God you can't apply like that to any
[47:53] other thing God alone is eternal because
[47:55] he lives we live with him praise God now
[48:00] this is familiar to all of us but I want
[48:01] the children to see it here Ephesians 1
[48:04] verse 4 you might say well brother Jesse
[48:08] you had a beginning so you're not
[48:09] eternal now I would say yes my flesh did
[48:12] have a beginning right but my soul did
[48:16] not as far as the Spirit of God in my
[48:18] soul did not because the Bible said I
[48:20] was in Christ in the mind of God before
[48:22] the foundation of the world
[48:24] this means God's thought about us you
[48:27] and me
[48:27] eternal and if it's God's eternal
[48:30] thought it's a part of God because your
[48:32] thoughts are a part of you right but for
[48:36] us you know we can have bad thoughts and
[48:37] good thoughts well God can if we're in
[48:39] God's thoughts in the Lamb's Book of
[48:41] Life then we we always had eternal life
[48:43] will always have eternal life amen
[48:47] seasons 1 4 according he has chosen us
[48:50] in the church nope
[48:52] in the denomination no yea chosen us in
[48:57] him before the foundation of the world
[48:59] amen that we should be holy and without
[49:01] blame before him in love verse 5 having
[49:04] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:06] children by Jesus Christ to himself see
[49:10] every Christian is eternal because they
[49:11] are part of the eternal thoughts of God
[49:15] now let me just stop right here and you
[49:18] know brother Branham says interchange
[49:19] book there God had thoughts in other
[49:23] words there are there was some record of
[49:25] all the sinners that will be lost but
[49:28] they were in the section of the Lamb's
[49:29] Book of Life or the book of life but
[49:31] brother may have said there was some
[49:33] record of them somewhere in the records
[49:35] of life because they lived a physical
[49:38] life but they're not in the part of his
[49:40] thoughts that were for eternal life
[49:42] that's a little bit deeper there I said
[49:44] that's about as deep as I go on this
[49:46] subject
[49:46] his brother BAM said there has to be a
[49:48] record of them somewhere because God's
[49:50] infinite and knows all things so he knew
[49:52] the sinner like Judas he knew Judas
[49:54] would live there had been some record of
[49:56] that you know he knew Judas would come
[49:58] he knew he'd be the son of perdition but
[50:00] he wasn't written in the Lamb's Book of
[50:02] Life and that his name was blotted off
[50:04] the book of life so that's about as deep
[50:06] as we go at least right now and as we go
[50:08] on but perhaps the Lord will open up
[50:09] more to us alright now here let's read a
[50:16] scripture all Christians who are
[50:18] born-again already possess eternal life
[50:20] first John 5:11 Lydia can you pull it up
[50:22] here we already possess eternal life we
[50:24] already went read one scripture about
[50:26] that already in 1st John 3 John 1st John
[50:30] is the book of life here 1st John the
[50:32] book of life
[50:33] thank the Lord and
[50:38] is the record that God has given to us
[50:40] what what has he given to us eternal
[50:42] life and this life is in his son he that
[50:47] hath the son hath WA life must be
[50:52] eternal and he that hath not the son of
[50:54] God hath not life these things have I
[50:57] written unto you that you may that you
[50:59] that believe on the name of the son of
[51:00] God that ye may know that you have
[51:03] you're not guessing an eternal life so
[51:05] you know you have eternal life that you
[51:08] may believe on the name of the Son of
[51:10] God amen
[51:11] John wrote this specifically so we would
[51:14] know we've got eternal life amen but
[51:16] were born again we've got the life of
[51:18] God in us like we said the nature of God
[51:20] within us to always keep us coming back
[51:22] to the Word of God back to the Word of
[51:24] God so see yes Holy Ghost field Saints
[51:28] were in the mind of God before the world
[51:30] was founded a part of the eternal God
[51:32] who had no beginning all right
[51:37] the Bible says let's go to Revelation
[51:38] 13:8 the Bible said the overcomers who
[51:42] overcome the Beast
[51:43] the reason they overcome is because
[51:45] their names were written in the book of
[51:46] life before the foundation of the world
[51:48] so see they were by God's foreknowledge
[51:51] they were placed in this section of
[51:53] it.the the books of life where he knew
[51:55] they'd be overcomers
[51:56] and so that's the record of them
[51:59] revelation 13:8 and all that dwell upon
[52:01] the earth shall worship Him whose names
[52:03] are not written in the book of life of
[52:06] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[52:09] the world amen that's the reason we
[52:11] can't go along with Catholicism or any
[52:14] denomination for that fact amen we can't
[52:17] go along with it because our names are
[52:19] written in the book of life not the book
[52:20] of death the book of life amen
[52:22] revelation 17:8 the Beast
[52:28] sauce was and is not and shall ascend
[52:31] out of the bottomless pit and go into
[52:32] perdition and they that dwell on the
[52:34] earth shall wonder whose names were not
[52:36] written in the book of life from the
[52:39] foundation of the world when they behold
[52:41] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[52:44] so everybody will wonder what happened
[52:45] to this beast now of course this was in
[52:47] the this was during the time of Imperial
[52:50] Rome okay because this is revelation 17
[52:53] here I'm sorry no those revelat know
[52:58] this is real yeah I'm sorry
[52:59] revelation 17 no this is the this is the
[53:01] mother heart I'm sorry yeah that's
[53:03] another heart so I got those mixed up
[53:04] there
[53:04] forgive me yeah going into perdition
[53:06] okay yeah that's that's the mother heart
[53:08] I sorry my fault next section
[53:11] unbelievers are destroyed and they have
[53:14] an ending point they have a time when
[53:16] they'll end or cease to exist
[53:18] this is starts off in 2nd Peter 2:12 so
[53:21] Lydia can you pull it up there 2nd Peter
[53:23] 2:12 I'm trying to watch my time because
[53:26] I got to get Steve back to the haven of
[53:27] Refuge the rest here before 6:45 so I
[53:29] gotta watch my time so neither hell nor
[53:37] unbelievers are eternal they have to
[53:39] have an ending now here's a thought -
[53:43] and let me know what you think about
[53:45] this afterwards I'm not even sure if the
[53:47] lake of fire is eternal but I know this
[53:49] the fire is eternal but I don't know if
[53:53] that lake of fire is gonna be eternal
[53:57] sea because once everything's once
[53:59] everything's annihilated there might not
[54:01] need to be a lake anymore because it's
[54:04] all done away with but the Bible said
[54:07] the fire is eternal because that's um
[54:10] it's a manifestation that's where I'm
[54:12] trying to get to that's the
[54:13] manifestation of God's Spirit see since
[54:16] God's Spirit created these things these
[54:17] unbelievers and angels then God's Spirit
[54:20] has to do away with it and the Bible
[54:23] calls it eternal fire so you get a
[54:25] little deeper here by God's grace so
[54:27] there may be a time when the lake of
[54:28] fires not need any more and maybe that
[54:30] fire just go back to the pillar fire and
[54:33] go back and join the other like slick of
[54:35] fire they're up and I bet the throne in
[54:37] the New Jerusalem I don't know because
[54:39] remember you can't limit God God can
[54:41] have the pillar of fire
[54:42] here at the New Jerusalem and then that
[54:44] same pillar more of that pillar fire can
[54:46] now be that that we down there with a
[54:47] lake of fire
[54:48] oh my second peter do trump but these as
[54:53] natural brute beasts look at this the
[54:55] comic look how the Bible describes it
[54:56] made to be taken in destroyed speak evil
[55:01] the things that they understand that and
[55:02] show utterly perish in their own
[55:04] corruption see they're gonna be
[55:05] destroyed they're gonna have an ending
[55:08] point see not tormented eternally but
[55:12] they're gonna be destroyed and done away
[55:14] with Jesus teaches the same thing in
[55:16] Matthew 10:28 let me pull this up here
[55:19] see it's always destroyed bring to an
[55:22] ending point done away with
[55:24] no more Matthew 10:28 let's all read
[55:28] this ready one two three and fear not
[55:31] them which kill the body but are not
[55:34] able to kill the soul but rather fear
[55:37] him which is able to destroy both soul
[55:40] and body in hell
[55:42] so a body so this is a time where it
[55:45] looks like hell can also mean the lake
[55:46] of fire but we know there's separate
[55:49] things we know you know hell is in the
[55:50] heart of the earth and then the go lake
[55:51] of fire but it looks like sea there's
[55:54] gonna destroy it
[55:55] both soul and the body will be destroyed
[55:58] [Music]
[56:01] Satan will have a time when he no longer
[56:05] exists thank God how many can say amen
[56:07] to that
[56:08] we ought to shout Amen for that as much
[56:11] trouble as he puts us through that old
[56:13] serpent and draggin my filthy devil as
[56:16] much as he puts us through Zico 28:19
[56:20] let me pull it up they're all they that
[56:23] know the among the people shall be
[56:25] astonished at thee thou shalt be a tear
[56:27] and never shalt thou be any more there
[56:32] comes a time when Satan will no longer
[56:34] be there amen and we get to experience
[56:36] the whole thousand years of it in the
[56:37] Millennium amen
[56:39] no Satan but yet we can live Church just
[56:41] like we're living now can you imagine
[56:42] living a thousand years like we can now
[56:44] no devil no temptation you'll never
[56:47] think one evil thought oh we can go for
[56:50] a couple hours you know without the evil
[56:52] thoughts that we could but my a thousand
[56:54] years of peace no evil thoughts
[56:56] Satan has no longer access to our human
[56:58] minds oh what a honeymoon that'll be
[57:01] praise God I'm gonna get back to that in
[57:07] just minute but let's go to Malachi 4:1
[57:12] the Bible said they'll be burnt up and
[57:15] they will have no root that means no
[57:18] chance to live right and no branch no
[57:21] fan the branch what produces fruit -
[57:24] which produces more seed so they will
[57:26] they will come to a spot where there's
[57:27] no more reproduction there's no more of
[57:29] them Malachi 4:1 for behold the day
[57:33] cometh that shall burn as an oven and
[57:35] all the proud yea and all that do
[57:36] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[57:39] and I'm sorry in the day that cometh
[57:41] shall burn them up see burn them up
[57:42] saith the Lord hosts and it shall leave
[57:44] them neither root have roots right if
[57:46] you're gonna live or branch branch
[57:48] produces the seed so see these sinners
[57:51] have none of that go down to verse 3 and
[57:54] you shall tread down the wicked for they
[57:56] shall be ashes under the soles of your
[57:57] feet in the day that I shall do us do
[57:59] this say it's the Lord of hosts
[58:01] now you want a good millennium scripture
[58:03] here let's go to Isaiah to verse 4
[58:05] brother Branham quotes us in 1954 here's
[58:08] a good millennium one not going to be
[58:10] able to read the quote for times sake
[58:15] but I'm still on as far as my book of
[58:18] Revelation series I'm still on
[58:19] revelation 20 I kind of pause right
[58:21] there because I want to put in this
[58:22] kingdom of heaven series but I'm gonna
[58:24] go back to that Lord willing I say it to
[58:26] verse 4 oh you got it
[58:29] thank the Lord Legrand says this is the
[58:32] millennium and he shall judge among the
[58:35] nations and shall rebuke many people and
[58:38] they shall beat their swords into
[58:41] plowshares and their spears into pruning
[58:44] hooks nation shall not lift up sword
[58:47] against nation neither shall they learn
[58:50] war anymore keep that up there hon now
[58:54] did you know do you remember the church
[58:55] age book brother Branham said how
[58:57] important the Millenium was remember
[59:00] that let me pull it up here let me find
[59:04] it real quick I'm just looking I know
[59:06] it's in this note somewhere I like to
[59:09] quote it for you
[59:10] yeah here does see he said the foolish
[59:12] version will miss the millennium which
[59:14] can you can begin and wonderful than we
[59:17] have were believed hey man what's so
[59:20] important about the millennium it's God
[59:22] having his day it's not having the
[59:24] lord's day amen it's God having brother
[59:27] bang his day of rest amen
[59:29] where there's rest for a thousand years
[59:31] but look it's important for you and I to
[59:33] because we finally get to manifest our
[59:37] eternal calling right because we are
[59:39] kings and priests unto God right now
[59:42] spiritual but it's important because the
[59:44] millennium it turns into the natural as
[59:46] well in other words we get to realize
[59:49] brother amen and sister who our purpose
[59:51] on this life in the Millennium we
[59:54] actually become the rulers that God
[59:56] ordained for us to be praise God that's
[59:59] why I says it's more important and
[1:00:01] wonderful than we never thought or
[1:00:03] believed and that's why God doesn't let
[1:00:04] the foolish virgin do it
[1:00:05] because they can't rule right now amen
[1:00:08] they can't rule over sin right now they
[1:00:11] can't rule over the cares of the world
[1:00:13] right now but we've got to be able to
[1:00:15] rule over the world because look he
[1:00:16] judges them among the nations and
[1:00:18] rebukes him so even though there's no
[1:00:21] devil there they still got their human
[1:00:23] spirits I'm talking about the the
[1:00:26] inhabitants of the earth that grow up so
[1:00:28] God needs Holy Ghost field Saints with
[1:00:30] glorified bodies on sorry to rule over
[1:00:35] this world and it's more important than
[1:00:38] we ever knew before because God is going
[1:00:40] to establish this world brother Branham
[1:00:42] said everything in the Millennium is
[1:00:44] gonna be just like it is now except
[1:00:46] there's rulers over there amen
[1:00:48] God's got judges over there God's got
[1:00:50] kings and priests over there hallelujah
[1:00:52] God's got men and women that can rule
[1:00:54] with the rod of iron amen and it's more
[1:00:58] I thought see but we'll have that's why
[1:01:01] I use that illustration and albian I say
[1:01:03] I was using brother Jim shoemaker
[1:01:04] I said well Jim you have to stand there
[1:01:06] the millennium with your rod of iron
[1:01:07] right and they'll be nations come up and
[1:01:10] say we want to plant potatoes here no
[1:01:12] and this one say no we want to plant
[1:01:13] apples and oranges or we want to build a
[1:01:15] road here we want to member it all gets
[1:01:17] burned over it's all started all over we
[1:01:19] want to build a city here and you and I
[1:01:21] if we're really holy goes for the Saints
[1:01:23] wolf
[1:01:24] there and judge and we'll have to rebuke
[1:01:26] some people too and say no even though
[1:01:29] Satan's on here they got the human
[1:01:31] thought remember there there's just
[1:01:32] inhabitants of the earth but the man
[1:01:34] said perhaps God's given the people that
[1:01:35] never got a chance hear the message
[1:01:37] perhaps she's giving him chance to hear
[1:01:38] it now or maybe like I thought maybe
[1:01:40] it's those aborted souls that never had
[1:01:44] a chance to live on this earth maybe God
[1:01:45] will give him a chance to live on this
[1:01:46] earth that's what I think God is so
[1:01:50] merciful and loving remember God told
[1:01:52] Jeremiah before I formed you I knew you
[1:01:54] and I ordained you a prophet amen
[1:01:59] remember David's boy died and he said ah
[1:02:01] he said he'll not come to me but I'll go
[1:02:03] to him so those souls are somewhere
[1:02:06] somewhere amen all those aborted souls
[1:02:09] there were somewhere waiting and I
[1:02:11] believe God will give him a chance
[1:02:12] that's what it's just my opinion but see
[1:02:15] brother Jim and all of us if we're
[1:02:17] really Holy Ghost field Saints we'll
[1:02:19] have to stand there and judge between
[1:02:20] the nation's and brother and said see
[1:02:23] you'll have such a character of Christ
[1:02:25] you'll be able to handle any situation
[1:02:26] that's brought before you the program
[1:02:29] said they may die over there they may
[1:02:31] not because the vows that a child will
[1:02:32] die a hundred years old he said maybe
[1:02:34] there's so maybe there'll be some
[1:02:36] accidents maybe people might die but we
[1:02:38] have to stand there and judge and judge
[1:02:40] it like Christ would amen see it's more
[1:02:45] important than we've ever thought I just
[1:02:48] want to emphasize that tonight before
[1:02:49] we're gonna close in a few minutes but
[1:02:51] one emphasize that it's so important to
[1:02:53] be a part of the millennium because gods
[1:02:57] kings and priests are get to be
[1:02:59] manifested physically on this earth and
[1:03:01] we get to carry out what should have
[1:03:03] been carried out the Garden of Eden amen
[1:03:05] oh Christ finger he brings it right back
[1:03:08] to where it was them at the beginning
[1:03:09] and how spoken word sons amen will be
[1:03:13] the spoken words right will be the
[1:03:15] spoken word sons amen and who knows
[1:03:17] there may be more - we got all eternity
[1:03:19] who knows right all right now I'm
[1:03:22] closing with this not this may be
[1:03:24] helpful brother Craig taught me this
[1:03:27] when I first came in the message there's
[1:03:29] four commonly misunderstood scriptures
[1:03:32] and let's let's close with this there's
[1:03:34] just four of them but you got if you
[1:03:36] look at them and rightly divide them
[1:03:37] then you can honor
[1:03:38] they're not saying that torment lasts
[1:03:40] eternity or eternally
[1:03:42] so the first ones mark 329 let's go
[1:03:44] there sorry I'm battling this cold here
[1:03:50] forgive me mark 329 sorry now this is so
[1:04:02] often misunderstood but he that shall
[1:04:05] blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has
[1:04:06] never forgiveness but is in danger of
[1:04:09] eternal damnation
[1:04:10] now the word damnation does not mean
[1:04:13] torment it means separation judgment or
[1:04:16] decision so it just means they're in
[1:04:19] danger of eternal decision God's gonna
[1:04:23] make eternal decision about them and
[1:04:24] they will have to suffer the danger of
[1:04:27] that right they'll have to deal with
[1:04:28] that it doesn't mean torment so see
[1:04:33] their separation of unbelievers will
[1:04:35] last eternally they'll be eternally
[1:04:36] separated from God but not their torment
[1:04:39] it's just the decision will be eternal
[1:04:42] in other words God's decree will last
[1:04:45] eternally because he's a righteous and
[1:04:47] true judge but their souls will be
[1:04:51] annihilated or destroyed or done away
[1:04:53] with as the scripture says they cannot
[1:04:58] live eternally because they do not
[1:04:59] possess eternal life mark 943 just next
[1:05:03] chapter yeah well now notice this is
[1:05:06] striking but Jesus says this three times
[1:05:08] in this portion three times in a row
[1:05:10] that just struck me this week I never
[1:05:11] really caught that he repeats this three
[1:05:14] times
[1:05:14] mark 943 and if thy right hand offend
[1:05:17] thee cut it off it is better for thee to
[1:05:19] enter into life maimed than having two
[1:05:21] hands to go into hell into the fire that
[1:05:24] never shall be quenched where the worm
[1:05:28] dieth not and the fire is not quenched
[1:05:32] now look there's two thoughts on this
[1:05:34] the first one is the fire see the fire
[1:05:39] may be eternal because it's God's Spirit
[1:05:43] in the form of fire right it's not a
[1:05:47] man-made fire God's not gonna ask you
[1:05:49] know which one of us are landscapers
[1:05:50] well oh yeah
[1:05:52] yeah you burn things guys I got it's
[1:05:57] gonna be an eternal fire a holy fire and
[1:06:00] that's the fire that he's talking about
[1:06:02] this fire will never be quenched in
[1:06:04] other words it's God's Spirit in the
[1:06:06] form of a fire cleaning up all of the
[1:06:09] universe I'll say like that
[1:06:10] glory recycling and cleaning it up and
[1:06:14] purging the universe of all evil amen
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:18] so see that's true the fire will never
[1:06:21] be quenched because that fire like I
[1:06:23] said once it's done burning up all the
[1:06:24] souls and the demons maybe it'll go back
[1:06:26] just to be in the pillar fire hallelujah
[1:06:30] and where the worm dieth not well this
[1:06:35] hat this could have two means two it
[1:06:40] could just mean the worms are gonna live
[1:06:41] for hundreds of thousands of years or it
[1:06:44] could mean that the worms do indeed have
[1:06:46] a form of animal eternal life now now
[1:06:50] listen they don't have a soul but God
[1:06:52] may give them a form of eternal life
[1:06:54] with their animal or insect or whatever
[1:06:57] spirit they have just like other animals
[1:06:59] remember the white horses that arm again
[1:07:02] where they live in that right now where
[1:07:03] are they they're in heaven right there
[1:07:06] in the heavenly realms you think they're
[1:07:09] gonna die I don't think so
[1:07:10] Jesus's horse is gonna die I doubt that
[1:07:13] so see all this nature it all goes back
[1:07:16] to the Garden of Eden and so animals and
[1:07:19] plants and now the plants in revelation
[1:07:21] 22 to the Tree of Life will produce
[1:07:24] fruit every month so plants have a form
[1:07:27] of eternal life so seeing that scripture
[1:07:33] has been new to me oh yeah in the midst
[1:07:35] of the street of it and on either side
[1:07:36] of the river was the Tree of Life which
[1:07:38] bear manner or twelve manner of fruits
[1:07:40] and yielded her fruit every month and
[1:07:42] the leaves of the tree were for the
[1:07:44] healing of nations now some people may
[1:07:47] say this just represents Christ which I
[1:07:48] wouldn't argue against that it's kind of
[1:07:50] a mystery to me but it could look like
[1:07:54] it is a natural tree when brother brown
[1:07:55] talks about it it talks about actual
[1:07:57] fruit and leaves healing nations but it
[1:08:00] could be you know just a figure of
[1:08:02] Christ just like the tree of life in the
[1:08:04] Garden of Eden
[1:08:05] so I just want to keep that in mind and
[1:08:09] show that to you that this word may have
[1:08:11] eternal life but it's not in the soul
[1:08:13] cuz it doesn't have a soul hey man it
[1:08:15] may just be part of the part of the
[1:08:17] thoughts of God that were the Garden of
[1:08:19] Eden that we're gonna last for all
[1:08:21] eternity
[1:08:21] two more here yeah two more and we're
[1:08:24] almost done bear with me here
[1:08:25] Hebrews six - Lydia Hebrews six - this
[1:08:28] is the same kind of Scripture as Mark
[1:08:30] 329 in mark 329 it was a eternal
[1:08:37] damnation here in Hebrews 6 - its
[1:08:41] eternal judgment which is the same thing
[1:08:44] Paul talks about the big the elementary
[1:08:47] doctrines of Christ their doctrine of
[1:08:48] baptisms laying on of hands of
[1:08:50] resurrection Dead and of eternal
[1:08:52] judgment so see there's an unending
[1:08:56] decree or sentence against sinners its
[1:08:59] unending but yet their souls will cease
[1:09:02] to exist but that judgment will last
[1:09:03] upon them eternally they'll cease to
[1:09:05] exist and they'll never come back
[1:09:08] because they didn't love the Lord Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ right see God's never gonna
[1:09:14] change that if they reject his love he's
[1:09:16] not gonna force them to love them he's
[1:09:18] gonna give them what they want they
[1:09:19] don't want to go to heaven so God's
[1:09:20] gonna let that give them what they want
[1:09:21] they want to be separated so God is
[1:09:23] merciful he's gonna let them do that but
[1:09:26] you and I we don't want to be separate
[1:09:27] from Christ we want all of Christ we
[1:09:30] want Christ in us now so that we can be
[1:09:31] with Christ later amen
[1:09:33] we want a spirit in us now so that we
[1:09:36] can be with his body forever amen see
[1:09:40] never says eternal torture or eternal
[1:09:42] torment never says that God's righteous
[1:09:46] judgment about each person's destiny
[1:09:48] will be upheld for eternity unbelievers
[1:09:52] though will cease to exist at some point
[1:09:54] and will never live again proving God's
[1:09:56] judgment is eternal last one
[1:09:59] Jude 1:7 Jude 1:7 here's what I was
[1:10:02] saying earlier the fires eternal Saints
[1:10:04] hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:10:10] Jude 1:7 even as Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:10:13] the cities about them in like manner
[1:10:14] giving themselves over to fornication
[1:10:17] and going after strange
[1:10:19] flesh are set forth an example suffering
[1:10:21] the Vengeance of what eternal fire
[1:10:26] now this scripture needs to be
[1:10:28] understood because in Genesis 19 silent
[1:10:30] gomorrah suffered the Vengeance of
[1:10:32] eternal fire in other words the
[1:10:35] Vengeance of the Spirit of God so
[1:10:38] historically speaking sodom and gomorrah
[1:10:40] stop burning shortly after it was
[1:10:42] destruction right maybe it was a few
[1:10:44] days maybe hours right but the Bible
[1:10:48] said and it's not burning today right
[1:10:49] you can go to that area and I think some
[1:10:51] people have found places that look like
[1:10:52] Sodom and Gomorrah I've seen a few
[1:10:53] videos on YouTube but you know who knows
[1:10:55] I haven't been there I haven't seen
[1:10:57] myself you can't believe everything you
[1:10:58] see on YouTube but it's not burning
[1:11:03] today so the eternal fire it was God's
[1:11:08] Spirit that sparked that fire can I say
[1:11:10] like that
[1:11:10] God's Spirit started the fire and then
[1:11:13] God's Spirit must have left off of there
[1:11:16] and left some natural fire because God's
[1:11:19] one who started the spark of that fire
[1:11:22] so again eternal fire refers to the
[1:11:25] fiery manifestation of God's presence
[1:11:27] just like the pillar fire amen the same
[1:11:30] type of thing it's an eternal fire
[1:11:32] remember God dwells in the light God
[1:11:35] dwells in the fire praise God just like
[1:11:38] Mark 943 speaks of the fire that shall
[1:11:41] never be quenched and remember Hebrews
[1:11:43] says our God is a consuming fire
[1:11:46] hey man mess in our feet and he
[1:11:49] manifests as a holy fire to display his
[1:11:52] holiness and power fire stands what
[1:11:55] symbolizes purification right purging
[1:12:00] purity and so an eternal fire came down
[1:12:02] started the fire Saudi Gomorrah left
[1:12:05] left a natural fire but then that fires
[1:12:07] coming back praise God and that same
[1:12:10] fire will be used in the lake of fire to
[1:12:12] burn up and do away with all the evil
[1:12:14] all the sin for that fire still eternal
[1:12:17] so we got to go back
[1:12:18] that shouldn't stumble any of us you
[1:12:20] know we know how this appeared of God
[1:12:22] moves right changing just changes form
[1:12:24] it's the same God just change his mask
[1:12:26] all the time now is that helpful by
[1:12:29] God's grace hopefully I was a blessing
[1:12:31] to you I tried to add some extra scripts
[1:12:33] and things I'm just looking at my notes
[1:12:34] here anything else I wanted a I'll be
[1:12:40] that's it by God's grace okay that's it
[1:12:42] oh praise God so how many can see how
[1:12:46] God's mercy is great now God's mercy is
[1:12:48] great God's not gonna punish people
[1:12:50] without n for all eternity and God's
[1:12:56] emphasizing the power of eternal life
[1:12:58] it's a literal person that you and I can
[1:13:01] receive right now we can receive today
[1:13:03] and with that life will never die the
[1:13:07] soul will never die amen it'll never be
[1:13:09] separated from the Friends of Christ
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:12] all right musicians let's come here
[1:13:14] let's worship the Lord praise God what a
[1:13:20] great revelation praise the Lord thank
[1:13:22] God for the truth of the message the

[1:14:05] study Lord or consideration with little
[1:14:07] prayer it might sound like that
