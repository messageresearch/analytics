TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the house of the Lord thank God for all the plowers out there I'm sure brother Jose was out there plowing thank you sir for plowing those roads everybody safe today by the grace of God pardon me Matthew 12: 24 I've been studying on a few different thoughts here and I'm going to take a little break from the two series I'm working on I just want to preach a general thought uh today called uh what is blasphemy of the Holy Ghost I kind of want to look at that here today when studying on that and I think there'll be a lot of encouraging things here I found some wonderful quotes from God's Prophet uh brother brandham it just as I've studied this the last few weeks it's given me a a better understanding on this subject Hallelujah now of course you know we are endeavoring to be marked with the mark of God brother Randon preached a sermon called The Mark of the Beast and the Seal of God hallelujah and that's what this topic is about uh and so by God's grace we are sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah we're not Mar we're not part of Satan's family we're part of God's family Hallelujah but it gives us a good understanding here and uh we the understanding is that you know sometimes as as as Christians we we say the wrong thing uh but God gives us Grace Hallelujah even in the midst of our trials our mistakes and uh and and God is faithful so I just thought I'd uh preach this here today as it's been fresh to me uh it's been a a fresh study I had this question and um from this different this this brother I don't remember what nation he's from but he said Satan torments me with this that I that I've blasphemed the Holy Ghost and I thought why would this torment so I started studying it I could see some things here and I I think this sermon will help you I think it it's already helped me Hallelujah and I think it'll help this brother I would like to share it with him eventually but I thought it'd be a good study I don't think I've ever preached just fully one sermon on this by the grace of God so how many enjoy how many enjoy the word of God today Hallelujah enjoy the songs enjoy the worship what a joy to be in the house of the Lord today Hallelujah Matthew uh 12:24 and then we'll skip down to 31 Matthew 12 this is a prominent chapter for uh demonology chapter 12 of Matthew Jesus explains how each one of us is like a house we looked at how we're a temple of the Holy Ghost on Wednesday night Hallelujah the sanctity of the body um but here in this chapter Jesus says exactly how demons come in it's when we let uh an evil thought paralyze our faith when we let a demon come in a evil thought or something like that it'll weaken our it'll completely paralyze our faith and we don't fight back we just accept this evil spirit uh but we know Jesus Christ is stronger than any demon power hallelujah amen and all we got to do is uh brother Ram said all we got to do is uh tell Satan his legal rights Hallelujah because Jesus already condemned all those demons on the cross and so all we have to do is claim our legal rights we have to say Jesus forgive me of my sins forgive me of accepting this evil thought or this evil evil action forgive me and then the demon on legal grounds he has to leave because you are God's Property hallelujah amen glory to God that's what this chapter uh says a great Revelation here in Matthew 12 we've looking at how you know also um you know overcoming the snares of the devil praise God so this will tie really good with that by God's grace Matthew 12 24 here is actually uh an example of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost well I'm sorry blasphemy of the son of man and then Jesus says if they would continue this uh this type of wording when the Holy Ghost came then they would blashe the Holy Ghost so here's blasphemy of the son of man verse 24 but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow doth not cast out Devils but by Beelzebub he it's the prince of the Devils so they called uh basically they called Satan Beelzebub there in this time now verse 31 let's go down there to verse 31 wherefore I say unto you all manner of sin of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be G forgiven him that's why Jesus on the cross said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God today Father God we thank you for the word of God today we thank you that we're born again of the word of God that Incorruptible seed Peter tells us in First Peter 1 123 hallelujah we're born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God in other words we know we're the seed of God we're the children of God and so Lord we come here today Lord God to declare your word to hear your word to be inspired by the word of God hallelujah minister to every need today Lord God and I just pray Lord the uh the inspiration you given to me Lord it'll be shared to the people to streng them Lord as a pastor I come here to feed the flock the word of God Lord God here I stand at my post of Duty and I know you're at your post of Duty Lord God you keep all your appointments Lord God and Lord we know you're here you said wherever two or three in the midst Lord I'll be there as well so Lord we know you're here today Lord Jesus so make your presence known here today we ask you Lord God and minister to all the needs of the church I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you as you're being seated so again you know uh the kind of inspiration behind this was a question on email but this is very related to brother brandom's uh sermon on the mark of the beast and the Seal of God every person think about that all the trillions of well maybe billions all the billions or trillions of people down through the years everyone was marked with something when they died they were marked with unbelief in the soul and they were the serpent seed or they are marked with the Seal of God the holy spirit so every person uh has to be on one side or the other I'm so glad I'm on the side of the king of the king of Heaven and Earth Hallelujah the Lord Jesus Christ I'm so glad he's marked me and made me his own hallelujah thank God for his Mercy now this is a a very good again a very good uh chapter here Matthew 2 I'm sorry Matthew 12 they uh the Pharisees of course blashe the son of man in verse 24 as we read but Jesus instantly corrects them in verse 26 he said Satan cannot cast out Satan because every house against itself is divided Hallelujah and then the kingdom can't stand so there's uh there's a truth there Satan cannot heal uh anyone who's demon possessed with another demon Satan will not cast out Satan a demon cannot cast out another demon only the spirit of God can cast out a demon Hallelujah and so we see it playing the scripture uh by God's grace in verse 29 here we get this this demonology that you and I uh have to fight in our we would say in our minds not our souls cuz our souls are sealed by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and God sealed in Satan sealed out so this this illustration here is the illustration of the human mind now now for those that uh are lost yes then Satan will come into their soul right we know it's Faith or unbelief in other words it's the holy ghost or unbelief the spirit of death right it's either either one because there was just like there was two trees in the garden right life and death Hallelujah so it's one or the other but here in 29 now we get into the demonology how can one enter a strong man's house so think about that when you first believed think how strong you were in the faith oh I love Jesus so much I'm a real Christian now I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to sing I'm going to pray I'm going to testify I'm gonna do everything I can what why was that because you're strong in your house Hallelujah you've got a strength you've got a power in your house but what what do we know happens after a while after A While You Know The Enemy knows how to work on us uh as we preached a few weeks ago for 6,000 years he's watched man and he sees how we get into our routines we're creatures of habit and he sees how he can kind of break into our routine and break into our thoughts and try to distract us and and he always makes sin look so beautiful like oh this will be okay right rarely do we ever sin where we know something awful something just extremely uh Wicked very very rarely is it that case he's got to bring something across where looks like oh it'd be okay to just do a little of that and so that's how Satan Works he tries to get into our house and if he gets into our minds and our thoughts then he can bind up the strong man he can brother M says he paralyzes our faith and so that our faith doesn't work our faith doesn't control the house anymore and think about that someone that uh someone that has a complex or someone that has a evil spear or some like that they don't their house doesn't uh it's not run the right way the strength of the Lord isn't in their life and you can kind of tell they're not as strong as they used to be what happened their face been paralyzed and it could just be in their mind right what do you have to be their soul just in their mind and so Jesus gives us some wonderful teaching here on demonology he first has to bind the strong man Hallelujah and then he'll spoil he'll Rob and brother says uh David didn't lose his salvation he just lost the joy of his salvation so that that that evil spirit that we allow in our minds we get an evil thought or an evil sin that we did if we don't confess it it'll start taking away all of our good things in our life all of our faith our virtue our knowledge our Temperance our godliness our brotherly kindness we're impatient takes all of our patience we're impatient with people now now we've all seen it Church you let's not act like we're Angels today Hallelujah right we've all been impatient at times we've all said the wrong thing we all did and sometimes we didn't show brotherly kindness to our brothers or sisters and what was it it was we open the door uh to our home and we let an evil spirit in and it bound up that brotherly kindness and the only way to get the power back is to confess our sin Lord forgive me I let that evil thought in I harbored that evil action it was my choice it was my own sin and then we pray the prayer of David create in me a clean heart oh God and restore the joy bring the spoils back bring the joy back bring the victory back bring the love back bring the patience back bring it all back let me be strong again for the glory of God so we get a great lesson here on demonology it's so important now verse 33 this is this is why uh in Jesus day it was such a mystery it's still a m mystery today brother Ram said Spirits don't die but men do so these spirits today will be just like well there's brother Chris God bless you sir good to see you brother we I just prayed for you brother Hallelujah verse 33 now look what Jesus says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit oh generation vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so Jesus explaining here this is uh we would say true hypocrisy they speak good things think think of that they speak they speak the prophets quotes they're quoting uh they're quoting Moses just like people today can quote brother brandham quote Paul quote Jeremiah all these wonderful prophets of God they can quote it but they you got to be careful what do the other words say what else are they quoting Hallelujah you got to take inventory of the full P the full actions of the person so see these Pharisees they would speak good things in the temple uh of course they would Minister brother R say oh they had their kind old priest they would let you borrow money uh they would go pray they dedicate your babies they would do all these things kind old priest but then when it come to Jesus and his miracles brother Chris we were texting about that verse today right or this week we were texting about this verse Matthew 12 we read in Matthew 12 but then when they see Jesus do the Miracles they get feared fearful because they see the power of God on Jesus but they don't have it in their Ministry so brother and and remember John 3:2 Nicodemus says we know you're a teacher sent from God so those Pharisees knew God was with Jesus but as brother bam will eventually tell us I'll eventually get to this brother bam said because of their tradition and because they wanted to keep the structure and they wanted to keep the power of their church and their Traditions going they blasphemed the son of man Hallelujah and eventually they would blaspheme the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost Came Upon uh the apostles in the book of Acts Hallelujah we see it multiple times especially in Acts 13 we're not going to read it now but there's Jews that were listening to Paul preach and they blasphemed the things Paul said and Paul said because you blasphemed I go to the Gentiles Hallelujah so it's quite a it's quite a thing here now uh in verse 20 now 36 I want to just deal with this just for a moment here by God's grace look at Matthew 12:36 so Jesus is talking about the very height of hypocrisy are these Pharisees they follow all these laws of the prophets they they act so religious and spiritual but when the word of God the present word of God comes to them they blaspheme it verse 36 but I say unto you that Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment now people have used this the wrong way they've used this against the bride but Church you can't use this against the bride cuz the Bible said who shall lay any charge to God's elect Hallelujah in other words we've U we've all uttered awful words but if we're the CH children of God if we've confessed all of our sins if we have faith in Jesus Christ if we're filled with the Holy Ghost then Jesus has dropped the charges amen he sent all the sins in the sea of forgetfulness Hallelujah no one shall l no one will accuse a child of God in heaven no devil will in fact we'll judge them Hallelujah we just preached it on Wednesday night Hallelujah we'll judge Angels we'll judge the world praise God because we've accepted the the sanctifying grace the Forgiveness the pardoning grace of the blood of Jesus Christ so this is referring uh here uh this is referring to the Pharisees they're the ones that their words will be judged upon them because they failed to receive the word of God hallelujah remember Church don't forget Colossians 2 one of the most beautiful trap chapters on the blood of Jesus Christ the Bible said God took all the handwriting that was against us and nailed it to Jesus's cross and what did Jesus pronounced afterwards he said it is paid in full in other words I paid for all of Austin sins I paid for all of Chris's sins I prayed for all of aaan sins it's paid in full Hallelujah fully paid Hallelujah so any Idol word we speak yes we we'll deal with the the we'll deal with the chastisement of it now but there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah that's right John 5:24 says we have already passed he that believeth on me he said we've already passed from Death unto life am so we won't have to give an account of any Idle Words because we're already forgiven of them Hallelujah there's no condemnation Roman 81 Romans 81 there's no condemnation to them that walk in the spirit and not after the flesh Hallelujah and Romans 8:33 there who shall lay any charge to God's elect no man shall now what I believe church is that though if we utter words and and we say things wrong uh and we get in a really bad awful complex I believe we can lose reward but we can never lose salvation because remember there there's there there's there's a three level of towns Five Towns Two Towns one toal now God has just given us an example there there's all these levels and then the Bible also says uh that we could lose reward but still be saved uh go to 2 John 1:8 a case you can pull it up 2 John 1 ver8 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but we receive a full reward uh also in the church ages I don't know I don't remember the verse but Jesus says uh let no man take your crown so each one of you have a battle to fight Glory right Brothers You Love battles right all you Brothers got a battle to fight you sisters too each one of you have a crown you can win but you've got to fight it the right way you got to fight it by the word of God hallelujah and not get discouraged and not let the enemy steal your reward and and not attack the the family of God or something like that you've got to stay with the word of God and you can earn a full reward hallelujah amen but you can still lose all your reward and still be saved 1 Corinthians 3:16 in case you want to pull that up there 1 Corinthians 3:16 I'm sorry it's 14 and 15 1 Corinthians 3:14 and 15 if any man's work abide which he hath built thereon he shall receive a reward verse 15 if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire Hallelujah now there's a story I don't know if you've heard it it's in one of uh it's in the the book a prophet visits South Africa when brother random first went to South Africa most of us know what happened if we've read through his his his life story he took the wrong itinerary the Holy Ghost had to go to a certain place and just wait there go hunting and then come back to Durban I believe it was but these these uh denominational preachers had we're going to this little church this little church and and and uh brother random actually uh he says he disobeyed the angel of the Lord and in in the in the book The Prophet visit South Africa I think it was brother R told I think it was Sydney Smith I'm not mistaken he said the angel Lord also said I would have given you this whole nation if you would have just kept the right itinerary okay so in other words brother Ram saying brother Ram saying I could have influenced this whole nation more for the Gospel of Jesus Christ but I made a mistake Hallelujah and church we're not doubting brother random we all make mistakes but the point is we have we have such a high reward we can attain to we must be faithful with it Hallelujah let's be faithful remember Saul Saul lost the king forever for Jonathan and his family he lost that forever because of Disobedience so what should we do Church look to ourselves let's look at our lives brother Ram's already lived he's already gained the reward he's already been faithful now it's our turn to do something now it's our ministry God help us to achieve a full reward by the grace of God and think about that all because brother Ram took the wrong itinerary it wasn't drugs it wasn't smoking it wasn't drinking it wasn't women it was he took the wrong itinerary listen Church to he who much is given much is required for those of us in the message we have a higher calling than we'd say nominal churches because we know more of the word of God hallelujah we know the truth of God's word so we must be faithful we must understand that God wants us to obey in every little area in fact that's the test if we can obey the little things God will make us rule over much Hallelujah now we're encouraged by Brother Ram later on remember uh uh Danny Henry speaks in tongues in that cafeteria and said a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee because you've chosen my way the harder way Amen brother Jose Hallelujah God gave him a greater reward in heaven because he took the way with the Lord's despise few that's the way I'm taken today too Hallelujah I know you are too by God's grace Hallelujah now so we can see here I want to um this person asked me what exactly is uh blasphemy against the Holy Ghost blasphemy is speaking reproachfully against the holy ghost in the Greek blasphemy means to speak reproachfully rail at or revile revile means to criticize harshly abusively or insult that's blasphemy of the Holy Ghost it's insulting God or the Holy Ghost it's abusing God's name right it's uh Jesus says blasphemy or criticism of the Holy Ghost is an unforgivable sin God will never forgive a person for that now what I found interesting Church uh I was I watched a ray Comfort video you know Living Waters y'all like Ray comfor he's good for for a good for a non- message preacher he's a pretty good preacher Hallelujah but he he he brought this out the Los Angeles Fire started on January 7th two days before that Hollywood had the 82nd annual Golden Globe awards it's the first time a woman hosted the Golden Globe Awards and after a while I think they had like they they' done through like 15 Awards after a while the host comes up and says let's make a running tally and you can watch the video running tally of all the people that have been thanked the first 11 people thank their co-workers The Producers uh three people thank their mom and the woman said look how many thank God zero and everybody laughed she said how many have thanking God the creator of the universe and everybody laughs and mocks God two days later Los Angeles burns the Bible said God will not be mocked now how many years have they how many years have they mocked God over and over and over and over again brother Chris did you want to share something brother wow wow that's very good yeah yeah you can share it with me too if you get I forget you share it with me very good yeah there certain times God will lay out specific judgments upon individuals because they should know better right by so two days later it's almost uh has like I said 100 no 12,000 buildings think of that 12,000 homes and buildings schools all burnt down to the ground oh yes and I was I watched a video from that Ray comfort and Ray Comfort showed a a a reporter she's driving through the fires and she says it's like we're driving through hell I'm not using I'm using that in the correct way and brother R said brother Ram quotes the scripture where capernium will be brought down to Hell and brother R said Los Angeles you'll be brought down to Hell I just think it's now brother talking about under the ocean but I just think it's very fitting brother said Los Angeles you'll be brought down to Hell and then people go through there it's like we're in Hell see this is the mercy of God give them one more chance this is the heart of God give them another chance give them another chance just like God gives us multiple chances Hallelujah this is the mercy of God this is the love of God hallelujah trying to shake people and wake them up and get them to stop thinking about the temporal things but think about things that are above Hallelujah oh yes let me give you a simple definition of how brother Ram uh defines blasphemy of the Holy Ghost right out of Matthew 12 here brother bam said notice the difference between the Pharisees and the woman at the well in John chapter 4 even in her adulterous condition she'd slept with at least six different men live with them and these Pharisees had been faithful in their marriages their whole lives well maybe we don't know but they at least acted like it publicly and brother yet she knew more about God and recognized Jesus more than all the scribes and Pharisees Hallelujah because when they seen this done by Jesus they declared a Beelzebub a chief of devils that's a fortune teller brother man said my mother used to tell me when I was a little boy blasphemy of the Holy Ghost was to take your own life so brother man's mom would say suicide is the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost brother said well that isn't so we we appreciate mom we appreciate Dad we appreciate Grandma I appreciate my previous Pastor I appreciate all this but we need the word of God hallelujah we can all be corrected by the word of God me too brother man said no the Bible teaches blasphemy against the Holy Ghost it's a speak against the Holy Spirit to blasphemy is to talk about when you see the Holy Spirit do something and make fun of it you've crossed a line that you'll never cross back again it'll never be forgiven you and so Jesus had told them he was telling them how he'd been confirming the word and he was the Messiah and they should have known him because of Deuteronomy 18 the Lord God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me Moses said and that was Jesus he says and brother B said I believe the Pharisees belied him but they did not want to confess it because their traditions because of the Pharisees had said any man or woman that would accept him would immediately be put out of the synagogue that's in the Book of John and they love their Traditions more than they love the Vindicated word of God that's like today most churches they love women painting their faces more than God vindicating his word they love uh marrying two three times being adulterers they love getting drunk uh and still going to church more than they love the truth of God's holy word hallelujah they'd rather have that and some of them don't know it but if they speak against the word of God for their hour they'll blashe the Holy Ghost and not even care now want lay this in I want to tie this together so everybody can see this here plainly I I want to tie in some terminology terminology is very important because brother Ram said I used to think the new birth and the baptism were two separate things now I believe they're one and the same and there's that's still a great confusion in message in some message churches but let me tie some uh terminology together blasphemy of the Holy Ghost is the same as someone taking the mark of the beast it's the same thing brother said Cain's Mark has been here this whole time Cain was marked physically but really he was marked spiritually brother said God's two marks have always been here hallelujah in other words uh Abel was a a Son of God right Seth was a Son of God Adam and Eve all these were children of God they were marked in a spiritual way that's right Hallelujah now after Pentecost that's when you could receive the seal in your soul before that uh it was just you're saved in your spirit Hallelujah because the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shed yet it could not forgive all his sins it just covered over sins we know that and so uh we see it so even from the beginning with Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel both marks have continued on throughout all of history so when brother Rand will say a person he says this has crossed the separating line he's talking about someone who has made their final decision and they're going to become a reprobate and take the mark of the beast and never go to hungering after God ever again so all these three things are the same when someone's blasting the Holy Ghost that's the same as they've been marked with the mark of the beast right it's also the same as you are a reprobate which means a rejected mind Hallelujah that's all those are all the same now in the tribulation yes Satan is going to have the Antichrist lay down the mark of the beast it'll be in the hand or the forehead or you can take the name of the Beast or the number of his Beast there's all these different ways to take the mark of the beast but that's like a physical marker that's like the final Mark but before all these uh judgments get poured out you know uh the trumpets and the vows and the woes and all these things that's that final Mark that the Antichrist lays down but the mark of the beast has always been here thank God the mark of God has always been here hallelujah amen glory to God God's always marked his children amen you now you shall know my disciples because of their love what one for another Hallelujah glory to God if there's someone in here you haven't loved it's time you better go to loving them Hallelujah forgiving them thanking them being a blessing to them be good to them help them out with their needs love one another because that's one of the proofs you're a child of God hallelujah that's right Church Hallelujah now this is a little deeper than of course uh it's a deeper understanding I believe as times goes on God gives us more revelation all right so we can see that the mark of the beast has always been here now one of what I like to do is I like to go over all these uh reprobate scriptures because that's the verse if you need a Bible term for cross the separating line between mercy and judgment right there's this imaginary line in people's lives and they'll come up so far or they'll come so close to to going over to the devil's side or God's side now the people that go to the devil's side most people will go to the devil's side brother said that line when that person makes their final decision they've crossed over from Mercy into judgment and Paul says you've judged yourself a reprobate in other words you've sent yourself to hell and God just allows you to go to where you want to go and the church said but R said God don't send you to hell you send yourself to Hell let's let's read that uh it's acts 13 you've judged yourself Unworthy of everlasting life yeah there it is uh it's verse 46 acts 1346 actually let's go to 45 Paul's preaching on the Sabbath day that was his day to do debates with the Jews is that something the Jews would want to debate every Sabbath Day verse 45 and when the Jews saw the multitudes they were filled with Envy evil spirit right evil spirit of envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting them so if they said Jesus Son of God they say Jesus was beo they blasphemed Jesus Is A Healer no Satan was healing them they blasphemed they contradict him and blaspheme so what does Paul saying verse 46 now church this something I'm going to get to towards the end here when we determin people of blasphemy we must make sure we're led by the Holy Spirit to to know and I I think that's how most of us act I don't hear many of you ever saying well I told this person they blaspheme and I'm not even going to pray I've never heard anybody say that here that's a good thing that shows you're mature right immature babies would try to act like they're prophets and I can judge you to hell and I I I I can determine you don't you're you blasphemed or you'll be saved you won't that'd be someone who immature they're on a power trip they're on a pride trip I'll say like that but thank God there's some mature people were by the grace of God here hallelujah verse 46 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold so see the Holy Spirit waxed bold the Holy Spirit gave him this boldness and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from yourselves and you judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles so here here we see God is showing us they're taking their free moral agency people that want to go to hell they want to go to hell they're sending themselves to hell and all you can do like Paul is just preach the word tell the truth tell the truth and all that the father has given me will come to me Hallelujah and all that's ordained to life will come all those that are ordained to death they'll blaspheme and fall away but by the grace of God we can know we're the elect We're The Chosen we're the children of God and we keep declaring God's words of Life Hallelujah see brother says God don't send them to hell they send themselves to hell look at their Idol words see they'll be judged by their Idol words oh Paul was Blas Paul was contradicting all these Paul was contradicting the Pharisees and all these things they'll be judged for those Idle Words they didn't know what they didn't really know what they were saying all right now we can see it plainly okay now let's read through some reprobate scriptures here by God's grace there's not many I think there's only one two 2 3 4 5 6 7 so Jeremiah 6:30 I'm in chapter in the 40s right now I can't remember which maybe 30s but anyways Jeremiah 6:30 this is the first reprobate scripture there's I think there's eight if I'm not mistaken so okay I'm gonna have you go boom boom we'll get a lot of scriptures here by God's grace Jeremiah 6:30 reprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejected them so see what does repr probate mean rejected mine so God's going to call all those who reject rejected him he's going to call them reprobates rejected right this is uh this is the part I reject right so any unbeliever is a reprobate that's that's God's final term for them in fact brother man tells us God's final term is you're either elected chosen to life or you're rejected and that fits Paul says we're all vessels either unto honor or dishonor hallelujah we're either elect or chosen before the foundation world or we're not or we're reprobate the rejected group oh thank God if God's ever heard your prayer if God's ever given you Mercy thank God you're one of God's elect Hallelujah you were chosen to Salvation if God ever brought you to repentance and you recognize the wickedness of your sin and you felt sorry for your sin and you wanted to follow God's way you ought to thank God that you're elected to eternal life Hallelujah and God didn't reject your life God didn't let you go off into the world but God kept calling you back in fact Jesus went to find you he left the 99 he left the aaran Saints he went to find you and brought you back to the fold hallelujah praise God Amen he leaves a 99 to go get the one Hallelujah not rejected accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah God's accepted our prayers in heaven God's accepted our worship God's accepted our repentance Hallelujah he has not rejected it Hallelujah now Romans 1:28 now this is spoken in context mainly of homosexuals but we've seen I've seen seen a homosexual man come to the truth hallelujah so this just means homosexuals that have already crossed that line that means there's some homosexuals that haven't crossed that line and they're going to run from that line they're going to run to Jesus we just saw it on on Wednesday 1 Corinthians 6 says you were abusers of yourself with mankind you were homosexual you were thieves revivers you were these things but now you're Washed by the spirit of our God and the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's what the gospel does it takes you so far away from that line and it sends you into the Open Arms of the Bountiful father above glory to God now here's here's a sign of someone that has already crossed the line they'll never be saved they do not like God's knowledge in their minds they don't want to think about God truth and they just want to they just want to speak against God see the fact that you love your Bible that shows you're elect of God and you and you want God's Bible to help you that shows you're a child of God I like those amens so see when people re cross that line between mercy and judgment and they make that final line God gives them over in other words God says I've tried I tried I know this is the last time you won it I'm so the Bible says God wishes that none should perish God doesn't Delight the death of the wicked so he says okay I'll give you over and I'm not going to deal with you anymore he gives them over to rejected mind to do those things which are not convenient in this case it's homosexuality not convenient not according to God's design Hallelujah now next one 2 Corinthians 13 5-7 2 Corinthians 13 5-7 examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not that ye our own selves how that Jesus Christ be in you except you be reprobates I love this but I trust that ye shall know that we are not uh reprobates so Paul gives this great word and who gets it the Corinthian Church this church we've been looking at this was one of the most fanatical churches I've ever heard of they had all the tongues brother van all the interpretations all they had so many gifts operation in but yet they got drunk at the Lord's table and men would sleep around with their stepmoms they'd Sue each other they rejected Paul as a prophet almost they were some of the most loose cannons they were some of the most baby Christians you could ever imagine and yet Paul is telling them humble yourself examine your life Christ has to be in you or you're a reprobate so see church we got to open ourselves up and say God pour in your spirit let your spirit be in me I want Christ in me I don't want Satan in me I don't want the demons in me I want Christ in me Hallelujah that's how I know I'm a Child of God when the spirit of Christ is working through me so he says examine look at your life what kind of fruits do you see you see all these fruits of the Holy Spirit love joy peace Temperance patience uh all these fruits or do you see the fruits of the works of the flesh Hallelujah this is how you do it 2 Timothy 3:8 second Timothy 3:8 then we just got one more after that isn't that interesting these are all the times the Bible used the word reprobate now as Janice and jambers withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith now remember earlier it says they're lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commands so these are people that said they love God but they didn't obey the Bible they didn't obey the commands of God and they whed Janice and jambers whed Moses at least three times they could do three things Moses did but after that they could do no more so they W they with stod now church that's what we got to look at our lives look at the people withstanding you trying to get you away from the the the church or away from the gospel that's someone who's Anointed with the evil spirit and you've got to withstand them they're trying to withstand you but you've got to stand up against them with the sword of the spirit praise God hallelujah so these reprobates Janice and jambers see they reprobates that oh we can turn a stick into a snake ah but who snake won Hallelujah uh that one snake looked like it was outnumbered but God's never outnumbered God's always in the majority and death was swallowed up in life Hallelujah so they so that's someone who's got the evil spirit they're resisting your desire to serve the Lord they're resisting your attempts to please God hallelujah that's and someone who loves thems more than they love God that's a reprobate person lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God hallelujah they'll watch a three and a half hour football game on Ohio State but they they won't even come to church and they'll get tired after you preach five minutes they get tired and want to leave and they want to criticize the preacher now nobody does that here right but that's just an example they love Pleasures more than they love God if if they text and say hey come over for the game oh right there but if you text and say let's have a Bible study no they love Pleasures more than they love God hallelujah very simple to see which side we're on thank God we can look thank God we can examine ourselves and see what fruits are growing out of our lives today Hallelujah ah last one Titus 1:16 is the last one Titus 1116 they profess that they know God but in their Works they deny him so see Church don't ever just listen to what people say with their mouth anybody can spew out things about God they honor me with their mouth but their heart is far from me look at the people's works what do they actually do with their lives what are they doing with the gifts God entrusted to them what did balum do with the gift that was entrust him he set aside his prophecy gift and he got out his false teaching gift and taught them oh it's okay to commit fornication it's okay to sleep with people before you're married and 24,000 died he set aside his Prophet gift and got got out a false teaching gift he should have stayed with being a prophet he should have stopped going to those uh susers right those divers sometimes you go to divers sometimes you go to God just go to God church just go to God just stay with God hallelujah see so in their Works they're abom able like Abominations right like murder like crossdressing like blaspheming the name of God how all these Abominations beastiality all these Abominations child molestation all these Abominations but yet they say we we know God we love God the furthest thing from the truth your actions prove what you love they're being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work they're rejected when God wants to try to find someone some of these people to do a good work he can't find them because their works are already abominal they're rejected from doing any good works because they're abominable and so God has rejected their minds therefore God cannot use them to do any good thing how many believe that's the scripture praise God it's the word of God so now church you've read all the rep probate verses in the Bible you've read them right here you've heard them now let me read where brother M says there's only two there's only two kinds this is in the church age book chapter 3 the Ephesian Church age he says let's go back to the beginning for the Book of Genesis in Garden of Eden there were two trees one was good one was evil one produced life the other produced death there were two children who originally offered sacrifice to God let me repeat that they both offered sacrifices to God the serpent seed act like they worship God but they do it in Disobedience the serpents need actually go to church they actually worship God but they deny deny the truth of God they deny the works of God hallelujah but yet they're worshippers that's why Paul said examine your life to make sure you're a real worshipper and then he quotes uh we're not going to read it but Genesis 4 3 through five you know Cain brought forth the fruit Abel brought forth a out of his flock of course would have been a lamb and God respected the blood sacrifice and not the fruit sacrifice Hallelujah why because uh Abel had a revelation blood redeemed my mother and father blood allowed my mother and father to be forgiven and so blood's going to allow me to forgiven Hallelujah fruit can't bleed right there's there's no life there's no real death a real sacrifice in a fruit offering but there is a sacrifice an animal offering a life is taken because life is in the blood this week I your Friday I I taught Bible club to my little Elementary classes and I said did you know in the Old Testament they used to kill animals and the children's mouths literally went like this I'm like oh you guys never knew that oh I'm sorry did I I felt bad at first you know because they're all thinking about their pet their pet dog their pet cat their hamsters and all these things so I had to explain that's what God did and by the end they're like okay okay if God did it it must be okay I said but I know it's still sad but that was the point it's supposed to make you sad so you get sad about your sins praise God and you recognize something had to die in my place how unworthy how filthy I am but thank God an innocent substitute took my place thank God that I can live and greater than all that Jesus Christ the Lamb of God has taken away all the sins of the whole world Hallelujah he said but one was evil that was Cain he was the father of the wicked one the Bible says that Cain was of the wicked one so that means Adam wasn't his father because Adam was a Son of God but Abel was righteous before the Lord again there were two children from the Flesh of the same parents they were twins of Isaac and then there were twins of Isaac and Rebecca later Jacob and Esau one was elect and the other was reprobate so by the end of brother's Ministry now he he he gets these Bible terms the elect are the saved the uh reprobate are the lost and they take the mark of the beast because they blaspheme the Holy Ghost during their lifetime everybody see that all right okay now got about a half hour here by God's grace so now we try to bring this down by the grace of the Lord now go to 1 Timothy 1:13 oh yeah thank you K I'm sorry thank you L now Paul says so if you've ever uh and I'll just have have to share a little test story myself I told it here before but if you've ever blasphemed God or the holy ghost or anything you have to remember that God will still forgive you if you're a child of God God will still forgive you in other words uh everyone has fallen short of the glory of God everyone and I want you to know that because the B Paul says this Paul says he was a blasphemer and he says that I am a pattern to all believers his life of God saving him out of a blaspheming life the fact God could save a blasphemer and even a co-conspirator to murder the fact that God could save him was a pattern for all who should come after him hallelujah amen verse 12 1 Timothy 1:12 and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me for he ha counted me Faith for putting me in the ministry now look God he says Jesus calls me faithful but before I was a blasphemer so in other words Paul said I reviled Jesus I was reproachful against Jesus I spoke I tried to get people to blashe his name that's what the Bible says look at this putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injures so not did he just he just didn't only blaspheme Church church but he actually persecuted Them See words is one thing but physical pain is another he was not just a he just didn't use words he actually used physical persecution took them to jail pulled them and chained them up took them to jail not just a blasphemer persecutor and injures right we see that there verse 13 verse 14 and the grace of our Lord Jesus was what exceedingly abundant oh if Paul got exceeding abundant grace what about us when the capstone's coming back and it says Grace Grace against two portions of Grace Hallelujah double Grace exceeding Grace [Music] hallelujah hallelujah what about us it was ex exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus Jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came in the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief so Paul says I'm the worst of all Sinners why because he was a persecutor injures blasphemer he tormented the Church of God I he said I persecuted the Church of God I'm the chief of Sinners so Church you don't have to worry about being the chief of Sinners that's already taken now you might be pretty low but if God can save the chief God can save anybody else Hallelujah Glory you might have done some really low down dirty things awful things but you're not the chief and how many knows Paul said thus sayith the Lord here how many know this is the written bible this is thus sayith the Lord so if God can stoop down way down for Paul God can stoop down for you this morning Hallelujah like he stooped down for me hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God verse 16 how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Christ Jesus might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe onto him to everlasting life pause the pattern if I can save to the depths of the chiefest of Sinners I can save everybody who didn't sin as much as Paul which of you have ever taken a Christian and forced them to go to jail which one of you got friends at the jail and you and you know the jail guy or the the uh that's what brother Rod that was his job he used to work at the jail were any of you Rod's friends earlier in your sinful life and you try to take somebody to jail or how about hold the coats of people that would shoot Christians we'll just make it modern set of cast and Stones see none of us have ever stooped that low but we stooped low in other ways like for me my testimony was you know I was just a a sinful ignorant abominable teenager and my my brothers and I would sit there and make fun of the people speaking in tongues I sat right there in the back of the somebody's a God church and I'd make fun of it and I didn't know better you know they would always get emotional and and then we would laugh about it we'd Snicker about it think about that God could have struck us down but God looked past the outside God saw the predestinated seed on the inside even though he's mocking and making fun of it even though he's speaking against it and making fun of it there's still predestinated seed in there and one day when I show myself to him then he'll preach it Hallelujah Hallelujah and if God saved the lowest of the low if God saved the chief then God can save me Hallelujah now one time I don't know if if I don't know if you've heard this story but one of the Saints told me one time not here one of the Saints told me they were already saved the message and they said this line and and and understand this and after they said this they battled condemnation for years now they use the word they Ed the word stinking a lot this person would say that person needs to uh stink and get a job if they're lazy they need to stink and get a job or they need to uh stink and pay off their debts they need to uh stink and go on a diet or something like that they would use that right well this person a dear person uh heard about some sending the message and they said that person needs the stinking Holy Ghost now look stinking Holy Ghost and this person came to me in confidence and said brother Jess pray for me I prayed for them and I showed them this verse Hallelujah I showed them this verse where Paul says exceeding Grace came to me I blasphemed but I did it ignorantly so I told the person I said did you do it purposely or ignorantly there it is right there and the person said ignorantly well then of course you're forgiven you are forgiven because all of us the Bible said without the Holy Ghost your mouth is a open grave and all the stink of dead things all the stinky dead words and thoughts all the stinky things comes out that's why God had to put a coal in Isaiah's mouth Hallelujah and burn out that dep and put life in there and what is life except thus sayith the Lord hallelujah amen and when we do things ignorantly God says you're going to pay for it but I'm going to forgive you because I've already saved the chief of Sinners and if I can save the chief that's the pattern I can save to the utmost Hallelujah I can save you if I can save the lowest of the low I can save you who are low as well I specialize in that that's my job I'm the divine Savior I'm the Risen King Hallelujah I'm the Redeemer of souls Hallelujah so I'm not ashamed to say that because I know I have to take everything I do back to the Bible I did it in ignorance and now I pray to God Lord let me speak in tongues but I know that would just edify me right but I desire in other words I desire more of God in my life Lord I want to experience you in new ways I want more of your word and look at just as one example Romans 812 Romans 1 128 I constantly want more of God's knowledge in my mind I'm not trying to get away from the Bible I want more of the Bible's knowledge what about Moses who literally killed a man what about David who despised the command of God had your Rah killed and slept with his wife and after he was already saved see Church there's got to be Grace there's got to be Mercy amen there's got to be saving to the uttermost Hallelujah there's got to be what's called getting back to your first love Hallelujah there's got to be God created me a clean heart and restored the joy of my salvation Hallelujah help me to never do that again and and look I I just appreciated that person was able to confess it brother random said uh he remember he got mad with God and said God you owe me an understanding and church remember brother Ram let his mother-in-law when he first started he let his mother-in-law Hope's mom Mr brumbach he let her call the Pentecostals TR trash and he just walked away okay I won't go preach them he let trash the the people of God were trash and then the 1937 flood came took his wife and his daughter he said that was one of my biggest mistakes in my life he let the people of God be called trash and didn't stand up for them are we going to make mistakes yes is there Grace is there hope for future yes I just showed it to you last Sunday did God give him a new commission yes God wasn't done with him God didn't forget about him God didn't say you reprobate God said you'll pay for it you'll learn your lesson because that's how you learn obedience through the things you suffer but I'm going to give you a new commission Hallelujah I'm GNA give you a new job Hallelujah I'm G to give you a new uh plan I'm not done with you I've got good I've got I've got good thoughts toward you I've got a plan for you I've got good things for you hope in a future Hallelujah the righteous man falls seven times but the Lord raises him up amen so see we see the pattern the lowest wretch of a sinner blasphemer which is unforgivable it was already after the Holy Ghost had fallen he was still doing that after the Holy Ghost because Steph had the Holy Ghost he let he let a holy ghost F man be murdered and say he was following a beel all these things and yet God could forgive him and make him a spokesperson other why to show show his exceeding Mercy in Paul's life Hallelujah now what's interesting I want to say about Paul I don't know if he was just in justification as a Jew or not I don't know because he obeyed the law of Moses right he was a Pharisee of Pharisees he was zealous for the law he was keeping much of the law so I don't know if he was saved or lost at that point I don't know but either way God can uh God can get a hold of someone even if they blashe ignorantly right God can get a hold of somebody help them to repent and get them on the right path by the grace of God hallelujah now what's we also have to balance out is that Judas es scariot was saved his name was in heaven Jesus said so his name was in heaven but then he blasphemed and he left the Lord Jesus right at the end Satan filled his heart so after that he left he must have said something Blasphemous to the Pharisees and Sadducees when he sold him out sorry the Sanhedrin Council when he sold him out and then he got he felt sorry he threw the money back in went out and hung himself so he must have blasphemed something at that point now but remember Church Judas didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't available so see we know someone before they're born again under the first two stages justification sanctification they can fall away and blaspheme but someone that's seal into the kingdom of God uh the Bible said they're sealed until the day of their Redemption Hallelujah so see it's it's quite a deep thought right someone can blashe before they're saved God can forgive them someone can be saved but forfeit it by blaspheming and be lost because they haven't reached the promised land yet amen the Holy Ghost is the promised land the spiritual Promised Land the New Testament so it's quite a thought we got to really get that's why the B that's why Paul said examine yourselves now look church I can't examine you you can't examine me you got to examine yourself you've got to see am I seeking after God am I following after God am I following in the word of God do I love Jesus Christ do I love God's people hallelujah hallelujah only you can examine yourself I can't do it for you you've got to do it Hallelujah now remember the Bible said 1 John 5:16 in case you want to read that or put that up there hun 1 John 5:16 Paul John said there are people you don't pray for when they've crossed the line and they blasing but many times we don't know who they are many times we don't but we know most people will be like this but see then but then we don't know who's going to be saved and who's not so we keep praying for the Lost we keep praying for Sinners so the the idea is keep praying keep praying until God puts on your heart don't pray for that person then you ought to be really sorrowful for that person person to know that they'll have an eternity where they'll eventually be annihilated and never exist anymore if a man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death I do not say that he shall pray for it so there's certain sins you know people do sometimes they may you know you may know it I don't know many times I don't though we don't know when people have gone over into that but once they go over into that then we don't pray for them anymore that's what God told Jeremiah just read through that God told Jeremiah Don't Pray for Jerusalem anymore I've sent them prophet he said Rising early and coming out I've sent Prophet after Prophet they've turned down the words of the Lord he said don't pray for them anymore butam said I don't even pray for the United States anymore now God led him not to but look we prayed for it and God's given us Grace Hallelujah so God told him certain things and see God God knew time was going to go on God knew we'd be here hallelujah in other words brother R had certain people to pray for the sick that God said pray for my sick children that was the Angel's commission pray for my sick children hallelujah oh my Hallelujah now let me read you a few things brother Ram said here's ways to know here's ways to know uh that someone has cross the line between mercy and judgment this is 1958 Jehovah Gyra you say brother brandom I've been so sinful I believe I've crossed the separating line no you haven't or you wouldn't be here tonight brother man makes it plain if you'd cross the line you wouldn't even be here somebody ought to shout amen out there I was hoping somebody would sayen the fact you're here proves you haven't crossed the line God's still dealing with you he wants to strengthen you he wants to fill you with his Spirit praise God look just think of Judas he he wasn't there anymore at Pentecost he wasn't even there because he already crossed the line if you crossed the line you wouldn't be here thank God you're here hallelujah thank God you can hear the preaching thank God you care and you hunger and thirst for the Holy Ghost Hallelujah if you crossed the line you wouldn't even be here say how can he brother man how can he make atonement for me I broke my marriage vows I've done this that the other you've done everything there is in the Bible that you ought not to do besides blasing the Holy Ghost God has a sacrifice provided for you he's Jehovah Gyra he'll alter all your circumstances oh Hallelujah the fact I'm here shows God loves me God's still dealing with me praise God I'm on God's side Hallelujah I'm not reprobate God's dealing with me God's going to use me I'm a vessel of God I'm a Child of God hallelujah glory amen hallelujah that's why John said they went out from us because they were not of us that's one good proof you are rejected is you don't come back to the house of God anymore Hallelujah 1960 two years later it is I Be not Afraid Tulsa Oklahoma brother M said maybe you think you've crossed the separating line that you can't be saved I don't know what your mind battles are I mean every now and then I'll battle this but not not much anymore because I've served the Lord so long he says maybe you think you cross a separating line that you can't be saved brother Bram said that's wrong if the devil told you you can't be saved just say devil that's wrong brother Ram said as long as you got enough God about you to come here to this church tonight then there's hopes for you to be saved as long as the spirit of God still dealing with you Hallelujah Satan wouldn't bring you here if you didn't care anymore you reprobate you wouldn't even be here but you have enough Holy Ghost to bring you to God's house amen so the Holy Ghost can heal you strengthen you deliver you Empower you Hallelujah make you more like Christ Hallelujah give you real Christian character Hallelujah brother R said twice you wouldn't even come to church you wouldn't even be here if youd cross the separating line remember Judas never came back after he left never came back just the fact sometimes you can crawl get in your car and force yourself to go to church just the fact you can press through all think about the layers of devils you know you might be bad on your mind but you press your way through your house then you press through your car you drive all these miles and you finally get through the door just the fact you got in the church proves God's spirit was with you Hallelujah God strengthened you to get here hallelujah devil won't help you get here God's spirit brings you to the house of God that's why he said gather more as you see that day approaching Hallelujah that's right Church Hallelujah glory to God but some of us just need a return of Joy you've lost your joy you've lost the joy of your salvation you haven't lost your salvation you just lost the joy of it how did David lose it he committed adultery and church you might not have committed it adultery physically but you might have committed it spiritually right love something in the world you love something in the world so much that you've uh cheated on Jesus you've given more love to Something in the world more than you give to Jesus Christ and so you come to church there's no joy at your home there's no joy that's your fault you let that uh you let that devil in and spoiled your house but the best part is you can let Jesus back in too amen hallelujah praise God you just got to open the door and confess your sin say Lord there's a devil in here I let him in here forgive me come back in Set Me Free I rebuke Satan and see Satan has to flee Hallelujah that's right I'm going to do a couple more things before I close here uh I'm going to uh read a quote here now this is told in I think at least six or eight places in 19 either 55 or 56 brother Anna met a dean of a Lutheran college and his last name was hegry hegry now I went looking for this guy on Google I couldn't find him this morning but there's churches in Minnesota named hegry church so I would love to see if I could dig and find this guy's history this man wrote brother M a letter in 1956 or 55 and he Saidi the dean of a Lutheran College he said I drove 15 miles last night in a blinding snowstorm thinking I was going to hear a servant of the Lord and what did I find but a polished Up soothsayer This Man Called brother brandham a soothsayer a worker of Witchcraft a Lutheran Dean a doctorate and he said you're theology is Oh my he said 22 pages in the letter you ever get a long text a long email of all the wrongs you've done ah you're just like brother Brandon you're just like the Saints of old that get criticized 20 and and he said he really give me a good one boy I've got a lot of those this week Hallelujah all because I believe there's three more three and a half more years to the tribulation than other people three and a half years brother man said I kept on reading I thought he said uh he said here's what he got me for he said that the Devil Couldn't heal no no he said that I said the devil can't heal and this uh said he said uh he said brother brandom I want you to understand you brag of 25 years of ministry I was preaching the gospel before you was born brother said well now that's okay anybody ever told you that before I've been alive longer than you I I I I believe this i' I've done this longer than you've been alive that's why I tell some of the kids in my class I said you haven't been alive six years I do I do it with all kindness and respect you I've been in here 21 years guys I know what's G to happen you can trust me I'm like eight times older than you but brother ad gets he said I got raped over the the coals 22 pages and he said brother R the devil can heal because I had this experience where I saw the devil heal somebody so brother said I sat down and I addressed him and after he first told me I thought he thought I was a devil a susser I said dear beloved brother look how he answers somebody who calls him a devil dear brother I was glad to get your letter that's not how I feel when I get emails and texts that I don't like or when people call me out on the pulpit like they did last Sunday I don't like that very much I feel angry but brother R must have got past that he said I'm happy to get your letter I'm always glad for friendly criticism it helps me he said it helps you if you'll just take it the right way he said yes sir let somebody criticize you might have some spots that ought to be cleared up I might have some mistakes I need to get cleared up I'm very happy to get your letter you must think something of me or you wouldn't have wrote me that's how I know who really loves me online or whatever when they'll write me and they'll try to correct me that that's way I know they at least care they don't say oh that guy's a rep probate they actually reach out and try to because love is corrective that's why I know these people lot these people that say they love me they don't love me if they love me they try to correct me now I got to do the same to them too I'm waiting on the go God's time in season I can't correct everybody all one day right you wait for the right time in the season he says You must think something of me or you wouldn't have wrote to me and then another thing I admire you for your 50 years of service to the Lord look at him start out with all these compliments you're beloved thank you for the letter you might be helping me and thank God for your faithful service that's what that brother who emailed me last week yeah this week he said brother I've been I I was alive when brother Brandon was born and you've only been preaching for 20 years how could you how could you be right about uh Daniel 70 weeks he was he was claiming because of my experience I know way more than you and then he says well you're a Cain then because you don't believe this I said well line up your math and his math was way off his dates don't even line up it doesn't even make any sense but he's trying to call upon his his experience your experience don't make you a closer to to God unless you draw closer to God in your experience Hallelujah number of years don't always mean you're more wise or more knowledgeable it's what you put in those years he says then another thing you must he said you you must have thought something of the Lord and and love him because you wouldn't have tried to correct me because you love him you don't want his work going on wrong you must love me so brother Ram saw when people C to try to criticize him it was a sign of love that's what we got to receive it as a sign of love that's why I wrote the guy and said may God soften your cold hard-hearted heart because all we do is disagree on three and a half years I agree on the water baptism the Holy Ghost God sent a prophet marriage and divorce we agree on everything else we just disagree on three and a half years now look at this now brother s now the next thing I'm going to do I forgive you for calling me Church do we have the power to do that John 2023a do we have the power if someone has blasphemed us do we have the power to forgive them and will Jesus honor it the answer is yes hallu the answer is yes Hallelujah whoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye retain they are retain brother R had a choice he could have kept the sins on him or he could have remitted them he chose to forgive may God help us to choose to forgive others Hallelujah he could have wrote back you blasphemed the Holy Ghost but see brother had enough understanding you're just a Lutheran you've only got to the first step there's three steps in Grace you're just on step one you're still in first grade yes but there's second grade there's a third grade there's more grade there's levels to go in god so brother looked on him compassion you must love me this could help me uh but uh let me help you out first of all I forgive your blasphemy what a what an act of God's love because he says because remember Jesus said that was doing the very same thing blaspheming the Holy Ghost now I said to straighten you up brother I'd like to ask you something I'm surprised a Lutheran would base his theology upon some sort of evidence why I said even in the Baptist Church remember he was a Baptist Brother start even as a Baptist in the first year of of church we learned to base everything upon the Bible all our theology must come off the Bible and you're trying to base your theology on an experience with a bunch of witch doctors but to settle it to settle this and straighten you out Jesus said Satan cannot cast out Satan Hallelujah he says that settles it he says Satan can't heal he said that's all Hallelujah he said he wrote me back a letter and said Mr brandom I'm coming back for the Christian businessman's International Convention to speak could I have a few words with you and he said all right he said after the dinner I said I want to ask you a question Mr brand he wasn't calling him brother he's call him Mister because you're a sser I said yes sir oh here it comes now from a Lutheran de he says in my oh I'm going to rake by the coals now he said I've been down to the Pentecostals I see them kick the furniture around and everything like that but I want to ask you is anything to it now think about that I've been in a couple Services I think I I'll use this year I've seen a couple Services where I've seen people SE in the spirit they pushed and I hope I don't bother you but they pushed on the Pew they were so in tuned to the Holy Spirit they pushed on the Pew and the Pew was knocked out that was my sister and she got a real visitation from the Lord that night I mean Furniture moved people screaming dancing crying at the altar snotting all over the altar people so under the move of the spirit of God I just got a message from one of Malachi's friends from the youth banquet he said let me tell you about the greatest experience I ever had it was in 2019 we at a youth meeting and all the youth people are running all over the the church and people are getting healed and saved and demons are getting cast out he said but the next night they tried to reproduce that and it grieved the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit didn't want running that night see we got to be led by the Holy Spirit every service has its own unique purpose for it Hallelujah and see the young people just thought well if I ran last night then I got to run every night that's not a mature Christian a mature Christian says I got to do what God wants me to do we got to follow what's God's mind for this service Hallelujah and the way you'll know is the hearts that are being discerned whoever God's speaking to and Discerning the thoughts and Tents of their heart that's their Direction the Holy Spirit wants to go Hallelujah but they got to make it known they got to act on the word either got to come to the altar or praise God or get ask for baptism or something like that or ask for the Holy Ghost they got to make it known they got to act upon the word hallelujah that Luther de said I've seen Pentecostals kick furniture around is there anything to that so he looked and said what what came out of that and brother said yes sir oh there is something to kick in chairs around but man said yes sir so somebody could get so filled with God they could kick around a chair this table could be knocked over on accident remember we were dancing at or it was the night before that meeting in Napoleon we had that great outpouring of the Holy Ghost remember uh I don't know if you remember this we were running around the church and uh not brother Mike derle it was brother the brother from Pennsylvania Mike chister we were all dancing around and I tried to hug him okay and I was squeezing him we all dancing around the church it was the Friday night service when brother Brooks was there preaching I preach a Saturday night and Sunday and uh I hugged him he leaned into me but I let go sooner than I thought and he and he lost his balance and he fell over and we're all running around and I saw some critics there I saw some critics there in the point going you know because he fell over right in front of the church and in my mind I had a mind battle did I just grieve the Holy Ghost so I I tried to pick him up I couldn't pick him up I said Simon come help me Simon I got him back up we worship now we all know what happened the next night God didn't God didn't think any bad thing about it am see we're just so happy running around and a guy falls over or a chair gets kicked or something like that it just it's just you're a child you're just enjoying the spirit of God you're just you're just new to this rather than criticize it get the spirit of it praise God anybody can criticize like Mall Hallelujah anybody getting criticized but Jesus said when you see the waters moving jump right into it Hallelujah in other words you become a part of it you start giving God praise you start worshiping you start giving God praise get in the spirit of worship don't sit there like a dead Wildflower get the Holy Ghost on you get in the spirit on the Lord's Day Hallelujah but ra said yes sir there is it's like a little kid when he gets a toy he just Falls all over the place Zion was playing with a toy yesterday on the couch what' he do fall off the couch where's my buddy all that fun you're just a child you're just learning how to worship he says like Ezekiel now he takes it back what scripture do we have for chairs falling all over the place and people falling all over furniture moving like Ezekiel said in Ezekiel 37 there's a valley full of dry bones can these live thou knowest prophesy to the dry bones and the bones come back together there's a rattling and a shaking of Bones so when people are dancing and praising the Lord and something happens and something a little maybe odd the ordinary happens it's just bones coming back together Hallelujah Skin's going to come on that and then the best part is when life comes in Hallelujah Glory see when life is coming on something there's got to be some noise something has to happen something has to become alive right a stillborn baby's got to be awakened there's got to be a shout amen there's got to be a birth there's got to be a cry there's got to be some noise so we should stop criticizing these things and we should become a part of it Hallelujah restore the joy of our Salvation Church Lord Jesus restore the joy to bride of Christ Fellowship Lord God grant it hallelujah oh we cry out to dry bones come alive Hallelujah God make us live again if you feel like you're not alive God send life again restore the joy clean out my house Hallelujah clean out my house let me rattle let me shake put my life back together it feels like I've been broken or destroyed or dead give me life again give me some movement again put life back in me Lord Jesus Hallelujah when the skin come on the meat come on them there wasn't much noise prophesy to the spirit now see I see them make a lot of noise them bones are coming together it's like that brother told me his name was Sam remember Sam at the youth convention you sat with him he said those were the greatest meetings so when all those young people were dancing all over the place that was the bones coming together now God wants to give you the spirit though hallelujah oh you thought the bones coming together was no no there's more to that there's more than ring and jumping around and shouting and making noise and moving around Furniture there's more to it than that there's Jesus Christ Living in the individual establishing the character of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what it is amen but God's got to bring those things together and give you experiences and then he pours his life in and then you live like a soldier then after that cuz that's what it was a valley of dry bones but it became an army Hallelujah am oh my thank you Lord but the RAM said I think those Dry Bones were coming together brother hegry he said but we're hungry and thirsting for god brother said that's fine he said we want you to tell us how to get the Holy Ghost I he said did you ever read Acts 19 yes he said a mighty good Baptist up there good pastor good preacher his name was ayos a converted lawyer he proved Jesus was Christ by the Bible he said they had a lot of shouting a lot of jumping but they didn't have the Holy Ghost and the Lutheran said but the Bible said Abraham believed God and was imputed him to righteousness what more can a man do but believe brother Abraham said that's all a man can do but you must believe and accept Christ as your savior but remember God gave Abraham a seal of circumcision to confirm his faith and brother Bram said Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption God must confirm your faith if he hasn't given you the Holy Ghost he's never recognized your faith so see you start off by by by becoming a Believer you start having noise and you start praising God but you got to keep going on let God add to your stature let God add all those anointings and then God will fill you with the Holy Ghost so he said okay brother Ram we want the Holy Ghost I thought you're a Lutheran college and you want the Holy Ghost I said what's the Lutheran people going to say now look what his look what his statement is he says we don't care what the Lutheran people say we want God that's when people here will get the Holy Ghost when they say I don't care what my family says I don't care what anybody says I want the Holy Ghost that's when you'll get it when you're not afraid to praise God or worship God or give God glory remember when you get the Holy Ghost you declare the wonderful works of God hallelujah every birth is a mess hallelujah amen you can see it you can hear it the Holy Ghost Falls when you're ready to receive him hallelujah what are the Lutheran people going to say Dean we don't care what the Lutheran people say we want God so I said wonderful he says when do you want it he said right now they're at a prayer breakfast brother B said well scoot your place scoot scoot back your place and they're having a breakfast and I'll pray for you he said they had to scoot back all their plates and their chairs and he said he had each one kneel on their knees on their chair right up against the wall and pray and brother said I prayed for 72 or 71 of them and he said they all got the baptism of the Holy Ghost because they were willing to pray they're willing to hunger and thirst after God they want the real Holy Ghost and God was give God will pour it out God will pour it out on us God will give us the real Holy Ghost hallelujah amen hallelujah and then nobody can talk you out of it and you know you got power to be a witness that's what the Holy Ghost is power to be a witness power to love you know your gifts your your placement your ministry you know what God's placed you and you do God God's work with God's power Hallelujah I said I laid my hands on 72 Lutheran students and they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they got signs and wonders and healings going on in the Lutheran College in Minnesota I'm sorry Minneapolis Minnesota the church said you went the Holy Ghost push all this push all your plate push all your regular life out the way and get down to business praying with God you're going to hear some ring out you're going to he hear eventually some of that hallelujah thank God for it it's the bones coming back it's the body coming back together Hallelujah I'm almost done oh whoa okay well that's kind of the way it's been lately everybody pulling on the word of God see how I put it back on you now everybody's po I'm enjoying it too by God's gra I'm almost done then another question they asked me this this person in fear he said I've been calling the Pope the Antichrist is that blasphemy he said I just didn't know and I said no I said if you call the Pope the Antichrist you've joined Martin Luther that's quite a big name in the in the in heaven John Calvin John Knox all these Protestants William Tindale and William brandham along with many other Saints in stating the obvious truth see look look at this Satan had so worked on this brother oh you've you've blasphemed God by calling the Pope the Antichrist how do you know he's Antichrist because the prophet of God told me because there's no office of Pope in the entire Bible because the pope is the leader of the church who sits on Seven Hills right remember uh Pope Francis put a blessing on the homosexuals remember that last summer you can't bless what God has cursed and you can't curse what God has blessed thank God hallelujah thank God for that Hallelujah that brother still that internet Prophet that false prophet he tried to uh say I put a curse on Jesse Smith that was years ago I said I wrote him back I wrote him 20 20 some pages back I still got the letter and I said you can't curse me because I've already been blessed and church it's been all these years God still blessed me and yes I go through trials doesn't every P Christian go through trials everyone that lives Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution so look at these broad evil spirits of false prophecy oh you're going to be cursed well you can Define that any way you want be more specific devil but they can't be because it's a spirit of a devil it's a lion Spirit that's right Hallelujah you can't curse what God has blessed God's blessed me with a new heart he gave me a new Heart for Jesus he blessed me with a new spirit and then he gave me his Spirit Hallelujah the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen glory to God in closing I don't know Church what you battle like I said I don't know some people battle this more than others I just know this one brother he said this is where Satan battles me extremely hard that I blashe the Holy Ghost and God has done with me so what I told him is you haven't if you if you even have a desire to wonder did I blaspheme that means God's still dealing with you that's the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost helping you examine your yourself to make sure you're in the faith Hallelujah now you don't have to raise your hands but if you battled this thought about have I blashe the holy ghost look what brother R tells a woman I'm closing with this and then Jesus came 1957 that woman was sitting there believing that to be the truth about Jesus watch her now she's weeping she can't help it that light fell right over on her that's what makes her act like that what light is that the pillar of fire see that that woman's been so nervous till the devil's even tried to tell her that she's crossed the separating line so this woman came to brother Bam's service she was all discouraged all downhearted but look God had enough Grace to bring her into the presence of a prophet not just a regular preacher but a prophet Hallelujah and she's calling and she's pulling on brother am's gift and it pulls so much but said that Pillar of Fire will go wherever people are pulling amen other words if you desire God God will come right to your seat Hallelujah and brother I see the light over her she's crying she ought to be she was so nervous the devil was saying oh you've crossed the line does the devil ever tell you that you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not saved you're not a Christian nobody loves you nobody cares about you and notice the word try he tries to tell you that the devil tries a lot of things but he don't seed on it Hallelujah he can try all day long he'll keep trying trying trying Hallelujah he he he's a genius at his job he's quite a conquer remember the white horse rider went forth conquering and to conquer but there's somebody who's more than a conqueror Hallelujah so brother Ram sees this woman and she's pulling on the gift of God she's been all nervous all week have I cross the line God doesn't love me God I Blas him the Holy Ghost and brother said look the light's over you the devil's tried to tell you those things Blackness hangs around her but she's healed now and the Blackness has left her Hallelujah Church what is it when we struggle have we blasphemed has God done with me it's a Blackness it's a spirit that you've let come around you it's a cloud that's come around your Sky Church you got to raise back your shoulders speak the word of God and speak against that Blackness let the light of God shine through the clouds Hallelujah let the holy Holy Spirit shine down upon you give you courage give you strength it'll drive that Darkness away You're a child of God that's why you're here today Hallelujah let's stand to our feet Hallelujah musician can come hallelujah hallelujah the devil will try lots of things to whisper but it's your job not to listen to that devil how do you defeat him with the word of God see I'm tired of feeling nervous I'm tired of feeling bitter I'm tired of the guilt I'm tired of the shame I'm tired of all this I confess it forgive me Lord and I'll go to the person that I sinned against I will do anything I can just let me know that you still love me I'm still your child you're not done with me I haven't crossed over line but I've already crossed into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Allelujah let's bow our heads father God we thank you for today Lord thank you for the patience of your people Lord Jesus Lord we know your spirit brought us to church today it would not have been the devil that would have brought us to church today thank you Lord for your grace Upon Our Lives thank you for moments Lord You've showed us the bones are coming together the shaking maybe the immaturity the the newness of the Holy Spirit Lord we're so happy so rejoicing people falling over furniture moving Lord we know it's the right sign Hallelujah the Army is coming back to life Hallelujah and Lord you want to pour out your life into your army Lord we thank you for today what is the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost it's someone who's finally made that choice to never hunger and thirst after righteousness but Lord the fact that we're still hungry and thirsting despite our trials proves you're still with us we're still your children Hallelujah and just like that Lutheran Dean he was forgiven after being justified and he saw the Holy Ghost fall on his entire Lutheran College Lord may we see the Holy Ghost fall in this humble little church Lord God for your glory Lord Jesus let the people be hungry for it let them thirst for it Lord God may we not care about rallying or shaking but Lord may we desire the life of God to come into every individual I ask all these blessings in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said let's give God a round of applause
