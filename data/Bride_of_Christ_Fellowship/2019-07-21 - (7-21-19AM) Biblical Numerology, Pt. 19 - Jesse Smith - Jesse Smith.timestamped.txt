[29:20] Lord speak the word Lord God live the
[29:23] word and we'll give you the glory in
[29:25] Jesus Christ's name Amen praise God
[29:28] let's take our Bibles this morning I
[29:30] like to go to Luke chapter 10 verse 1
[29:32] Luke chapter 10 verse 1
[29:35] greet you on the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:37] and we had a good time last night went
[29:40] to Albion Pennsylvania for a little
[29:42] youth banquet and got home at midnight
[29:44] but it was well worth it Lydia had a
[29:45] great time and got to hear some good
[29:47] preaching and they did a nice job just
[29:51] kind of ministering to the youth there
[29:54] and really enjoyed it by God's grace so
[29:58] Luke chapter 10 verse 1 as our children
[30:07] get older you know my mind is filled
[30:08] with thoughts about well what should we
[30:10] do for our youth and and that was a good
[30:12] example last night but I also want to
[30:15] have prayer for the youth you know I
[30:16] think I think it's good to have hot dog
[30:18] roasts it's good to have banquets but
[30:22] the main thing we need all of us is
[30:24] prayer so we got to have a time of
[30:27] Prayer and consecration as the Lord
[30:30] leads you know we'll see what the Lord
[30:31] leads us but excited about that by God's
[30:33] grace Luke chapter 10 verse 1 I like to
[30:37] speak to you on biblical numerology this
[30:39] morning and there's a lot of you know
[30:40] thoughts that I know the Holy Spirit
[30:42] will help us with this is part 19 I
[30:46] think it will finish hopefully with the
[30:47] the series all buds been an enlightening
[30:49] series for you it's been a tremendous
[30:51] series for me to see all the the numbers
[30:55] and their meanings in Scripture but also
[30:57] what they mean to me in my life and
[30:59] hopefully in your life as well by God's
[31:01] grace Luke chapter 10 we'll just read
[31:04] verse 1 and 2 we're going to start with
[31:06] the number 60 and then work our way up
[31:08] to 70 and we'll work our way up to 200
[31:11] million today by God's grace so that's
[31:13] at least at least in my notes so we'll
[31:16] see what the Lord has for us here Luke
[31:18] chapter 10 I'll read verse 1 and then
[31:23] we'll all read verse 2 so I'll read
[31:24] verse 1 alone after these things the
[31:27] Lord appointed other seventy also so he
[31:29] had twelve that he sent out and then
[31:32] other seventy also and sent them two and
[31:35] two before his face into every city in
[31:37] place whither he himself would come so
[31:41] the disciples would be the first pole
[31:43] right or the we say the former rain and
[31:46] then Jesus Christ would come and be the
[31:48] latter rain
[31:49] verse two let's read it together on
[31:52] three one two three therefore said he
[31:55] unto them the harvest truly is great but
[31:59] the laborers are few pray ye therefore
[32:02] the lord of the harvest that he may send
[32:05] forth laborers into his harvest amen I'm
[32:09] going to be a laborer in the harvest of
[32:10] Christ everybody is a laborer some our
[32:13] missionary Labor's like this but there's
[32:16] mothers and our laborers there's
[32:17] father's and Labor's grandparents their
[32:20] singles adults you know there's all
[32:22] children can be laborers in the kingdom
[32:24] of God
[32:25] so may God as blessings the reading of
[32:27] his word may be seated here I do have
[32:29] quite a few slides here this is the I
[32:31] have this sermon ready all week just
[32:33] kind of ready to preach it so thankful
[32:36] to the Lord for giving us grace today
[32:38] how many happy to be in the house the
[32:40] Lord today raise it or not I've seen
[32:43] this before
[32:44] Sir Anthony Antony well let's give Andy
[32:50] around pause a little s yes sir
[32:53] we've seen you before correct yeah I
[32:56] thought you look familiar phrase the
[32:57] Lord oh no really it's your first time
[32:59] okay I'm sorry then forgive me I'm sorry
[33:03] my fault you look familiar but God is
[33:09] good praise the Lord well hope you enjoy
[33:11] the worship today and then we had a
[33:13] really good song service this morning
[33:14] thank you musicians for that and we're
[33:17] happy to be in the house of Lord today
[33:19] nor willing tonight though I think I
[33:21] want to look at the kingdom of God in
[33:24] the kingdom of heaven tonight I was
[33:25] doing some studies on that yesterday and
[33:26] just pulling up a bunch of scriptures
[33:28] I've seen some things I just never
[33:30] really looked looked and seen it that
[33:31] way before
[33:32] now we'll preach on that unless we have
[33:35] our visitors like we had last week and
[33:36] then they requested how to know the
[33:39] voice of God and how to hear from God
[33:41] so if our visitors come I'll preach that
[33:43] way and we'll look at you know he that
[33:45] hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit
[33:47] says we'll look at that and how the
[33:49] Spirit always sends a prophet it was
[33:51] always point to the word sow nor willing
[33:53] we can look at that if our guests show
[33:54] up tonight so we'll see we're just happy
[33:56] when people come and want to join us you
[33:59] know and we're just I just get excited
[34:02] you know
[34:03] whether no matter who's here I'm excited
[34:04] to serve the Lord Amen let's look at
[34:06] part 19 and and God will speak to us I'm
[34:09] sure through these numbers so we read
[34:11] our text and we read the text of 70
[34:13] because I have a lot of 70 scriptures
[34:15] and as the numbers have gotten bigger
[34:17] you know I'm not able really to pinpoint
[34:19] down exactly what that number represents
[34:20] but perhaps a later time you know one
[34:24] thing is for sure an eternity God will
[34:26] show us what each one meant but the
[34:28] little ones you know the smaller numbers
[34:30] we can we can clearly see what they all
[34:31] mean
[34:32] as we get to even up to 20 you know in
[34:35] 21 expectation and you can see all those
[34:37] clearly marked in Scripture but as you
[34:40] get bigger there's there's fewer
[34:42] examples and it's a bit more difficult
[34:43] but let's start at 60 you know and from
[34:46] 60 up I don't have a whole lot of
[34:47] meanings but we can at least show the
[34:50] scripture and you can you can start to
[34:52] see maybe what God is saying through
[34:55] some of these numbers so 60 you know
[34:57] Nebuchadnezzar's image was 60 cubits
[34:59] tall in Daniel chapter 3 verse 1
[35:05] Ezra's latter house was 60 cubits high
[35:07] and 60 wide and of course we know
[35:11] remember the glory of the the the latter
[35:13] would be greater than the former right
[35:15] because the the latter would have Jesus
[35:18] Christ amen it was speaking of that
[35:20] Christ would come to the Jews eventually
[35:22] praise God and that would be a greater
[35:24] house than the houses even Solomon built
[35:27] praise God
[35:28] so God was trying to show them don't be
[35:30] so excited about the house because a
[35:32] greater greater house is coming in fact
[35:35] the Bible says in the in the New
[35:37] Jerusalem there will be no temple
[35:39] because Jesus Christ is the temple amen
[35:41] I'll say like this every one of us will
[35:43] be a temple in the head
[35:45] God will eternally abide in you and I
[35:47] hallelujah and so you see you know we're
[35:51] just we just seeing numbers here and
[35:53] let's look at them Solomon this is
[35:55] interesting Solomon had 60 mighty men of
[35:57] valor rather than thirty David at 30
[36:02] Salman had 60 behold his bed which is
[36:05] Solomon's threescore valiant men are
[36:07] about it of the value of Israel of
[36:11] course again showing David and Solomon
[36:13] of course you know Solomon representing
[36:16] the millennia
[36:17] and how great how much greater the
[36:18] Millennium will be than these earthly
[36:20] dwellings praise God these earthly than
[36:22] even the kingdom of God here on earth
[36:24] it'll be so much greater song Song of
[36:28] Solomon 3:8 they all hold swords being
[36:30] expert in war every man had this sword
[36:32] upon his thigh because of fear and the
[36:35] night amen so we see numbers of 60 60
[36:39] was the second highest yield of the seed
[36:42] in Jesus's parable of 60 fold here
[36:45] remember this these are the bride
[36:47] members foolish merging camp bringing
[36:50] forth fruit unto God because they're not
[36:52] fully quickened by the baptism of the
[36:54] Holy Ghost
[36:55] praise God they can be saved but they
[36:58] don't have the incorruptible seed Word
[37:01] of God and that because of the cares of
[37:03] the world they're foolish and their
[37:05] lives get choked out by the cares of the
[37:07] world and they don't bring forth real
[37:09] fruit unto God
[37:10] but 60-fold is also 3/5 which 3 and 5
[37:15] are good numbers there I don't have the
[37:16] understanding I don't want to presume
[37:18] either I want to wait too I really know
[37:20] something or see a pattern so people's
[37:23] lives will Holy Ghost filled saints
[37:26] lives will do thirtyfold sixtyfold a
[37:29] hundredfold upon what they were given
[37:33] praise God and my messages and my
[37:38] heart's been on lately - for you and I
[37:39] to find our purpose in life and don't
[37:42] let anything distract us from our
[37:43] purpose devote ourselves fully in the
[37:46] purpose of God for our lives until we
[37:48] see fruit brought forth and sometimes
[37:52] it'll be a year five years ten years in
[37:55] fact I was talking to the missionary no
[37:58] I'm sorry something - the Evangelist
[37:59] yesterday brother Nathan and he just got
[38:01] back from Uganda and he said for years
[38:04] the the small message churches in Uganda
[38:07] were doing a radio ministry of just
[38:09] publishing brother brands you know just
[38:13] having talking about brother brand
[38:14] playing brother branham in Uganda and
[38:16] for years I think he said 10 or 15 years
[38:19] they got really no response and they
[38:22] were almost ready to give up and then
[38:25] brother Nathan said all of a sudden the
[38:26] Holy Ghost struck the country of Uganda
[38:30] and he said the pastures are coming in
[38:31] from the conference saying we are having
[38:33] churches by the hundreds Pentecostal
[38:37] Uganda churches receiving the water
[38:39] baptism in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[38:41] receiving God's prophet amen and now
[38:45] there he said their radio ministry is so
[38:46] great they can hardly maintain and keep
[38:48] up with all the calls but it just sat
[38:50] dormant for years and years and years
[38:53] and years until the time God said now
[38:56] I'm gonna bring forth fruit
[38:57] see man waters and man plants and man
[39:00] waters and plants and then God gives the
[39:02] increase amen that's what we've got to
[39:05] do you know our churches here 13 years
[39:07] and we just got to keep watering and
[39:09] laboring and planting and even if God
[39:11] doesn't give us a great number I tell
[39:12] you we got great quality here because
[39:17] it's more about the quality not the
[39:19] quantity praise God because you can go
[39:22] down this road 77 and I promise you
[39:24] you'll pass numerous mega churches on
[39:26] the way and they got a lot more quak
[39:28] quak quantity but they don't got the
[39:30] quality of the Holy Ghost amen had to
[39:33] live the real life of Jesus Christ amen
[39:36] so I just want to encourage you with
[39:38] that that was such a blessing to me like
[39:40] mine I just got to keep on the fire
[39:41] lines keep investing keep focus on your
[39:45] calling
[39:46] keep dedicating yourself to that and
[39:48] suit it and soon you'll see the increase
[39:51] and let me even say like this the Bible
[39:53] said those in the Old Testament many of
[39:55] those died and didn't see the fruits of
[39:58] their labors so some of us may not see
[40:02] the fruits of our labors so the thing to
[40:04] do is have a revelation of your purpose
[40:06] in life and dedicate yourself to that
[40:09] and know there's some day there'll be a
[40:10] payday praise God
[40:12] amen there'll be a payday at some point
[40:15] whether on this side or that side amen
[40:18] invest in in the talents God's given you
[40:21] praise God you know I just reminded me
[40:24] of a scripture here let me see if I can
[40:28] pull it up real quick I was just
[40:32] this week where the Bible says some
[40:35] men's sins go before them that's Paul
[40:38] you know st. Paul yeah so right there it
[40:44] is okay Gloria kind of fits right here
[40:45] first Timothy 5 I'm gonna turn there you
[40:47] don't have to turn there unless you want
[40:49] to in your Bible I got to read it
[40:50] straight from my scripture here
[40:52] first Timothy 5 now Paul ends this
[40:55] chapter here
[40:57] first Timothy 5 24 it's not this slide
[40:59] but it is that same chapter but first
[41:02] Timothy 5:20 for some men's sins are
[41:05] open beforehand going before to judgment
[41:08] like you go is use Adolf Hitler ever
[41:11] example and Judas some of the some men's
[41:14] sins are just so obvious and some men
[41:18] they follow after some men and women are
[41:21] not so obvious which side they're on
[41:24] right because my man said there be a lot
[41:25] of surprises at the Day of Judgment a
[41:27] lot of especially right is this applies
[41:30] especially to preachers and in either
[41:32] message churches our denominational they
[41:34] can act all holy like the Pharisees but
[41:37] jesus said you're of your father the
[41:38] devil right they hide their city so you
[41:42] look beautiful on the outside but inward
[41:44] you're full of dead men's bones but some
[41:48] man you know women you can see right
[41:49] away which side there are they're there
[41:51] under the devil's side and and they
[41:53] bring forth all kind of incorruptible
[41:54] fruit but Paul says not all are like
[41:57] that some men we won't see their sins
[42:00] until the day of judgment well verse 25
[42:04] likewise also the good works of some are
[42:07] manifest beforehand glory sometimes God
[42:11] lets you see people's Labor's and their
[42:14] fruits of their labors on this side
[42:16] praise God
[42:17] but there's the part here and they that
[42:20] are otherwise cannot be hid okay so it's
[42:24] the same thing just as some people's
[42:26] sins are so obvious and yet some are
[42:28] hidden so it is with rewards and fruit
[42:30] some men see their fruit on this side
[42:32] and other men see it won't see it on
[42:34] this side they'll see it on the other
[42:35] side
[42:36] how many can say praise the Lord that's
[42:39] right let's go to Hebrews 11 since we're
[42:42] there I just want to pull that scripture
[42:43] up so you can see it again
[42:46] many men died without receiving the
[42:48] promise look at verse 38 I just love
[42:55] reading this is one of my favorite
[42:56] verses in the Bible I think of whom the
[42:59] world was not working you know Church
[43:02] some of the people's testimonies of
[43:04] serving Jesus Christ are so powerful
[43:07] they're full of such sacrifice that the
[43:10] world is not even worthy to be with them
[43:14] they're just so they're just so
[43:16] sacrificial they they give up so much
[43:18] for the kingdom of God that the world
[43:20] isn't even worthy to be around them
[43:22] that's what the Bible said these were
[43:24] the ones that were stoned like Stephen
[43:27] those Pharisees weren't even worthy to
[43:29] be around a man like that amen he was so
[43:32] filled with Jesus Christ that the angels
[43:34] of God the Angels glory shone on his
[43:36] face amen hallelujah a man that could
[43:39] stand in the midst of criticism amen in
[43:42] the midst of rejection in the midst of
[43:45] hatred he could stand there and offer
[43:47] them the circumcision of the Holy Ghost
[43:49] but he says your hearts are
[43:51] uncircumcised and the Bible said they
[43:54] were stoned and they were sawed asunder
[43:55] and they wandered around in sheepskins
[43:57] and goatskins and the wave wasn't even
[44:00] worthy of men and women like that amen
[44:03] they wandered in deserts and in
[44:05] mountains and in dens and in caves of
[44:07] the earth think of Elisha the world
[44:10] wasn't even Jezebel they had won even
[44:12] worthy to be around him right he
[44:15] wandered off to a cave all by himself
[44:17] they weren't even worthy he was such a
[44:19] godly man Amen see sometimes you know
[44:23] sin will cause you the sin of other
[44:26] people will cause you to separate
[44:28] yourself and you'll feel sorry about it
[44:30] but all reality God's saying they're not
[44:32] worthy to be around you amen and I'm not
[44:36] talking pride I'm talking humility
[44:39] praise God you're such an assignment
[44:45] it's separate a purse for your loan but
[44:47] you're really not alone because Christ
[44:49] is with you Amen Alleluia and the wave
[44:52] is not even wave and it was God doesn't
[44:54] want you to be the foul God doesn't want
[44:56] them to try to stain you and tempt you
[44:58] know those things they says I'm going to
[44:59] separate you and we'll have some
[45:01] fellowship alone amen I'm going to
[45:05] separate you into myself hallelujah amen
[45:09] dens and caves where Elijah here that
[45:12] still small voice in the cave Church all
[45:15] by himself God said I wasn't in the
[45:17] earthquake I was in the fire I was in
[45:20] the wind I was in the still small voice
[45:23] I was in that voice when you overload
[45:27] that strengthen your heart I was in that
[45:29] voice amen
[45:30] you thought I wasn't oh the noise and
[45:32] all the chatter and all that but I was
[45:35] actually in that secret place with you a
[45:38] man like the holy of holies Amen very
[45:42] house Elijah's little holiest of holies
[45:45] aren't you glad for those times of the
[45:47] Lord verse 39 and these are having
[45:52] obtained a good report through faith
[45:54] received not the promise their whole
[45:58] lives they were saying I'm gonna reach
[46:00] the promise some day I'll reach the
[46:02] promise some day I'll reach a promise
[46:03] and they get down to the last few
[46:05] minutes and realize I didn't receive the
[46:07] promise but God must have whisper in
[46:09] their ear but you will one day you will
[46:12] see it on this side you'll see it on the
[46:14] other side Oh hallelujah
[46:17] they died not seeing the promise but the
[46:20] Bible said verse 40 but God having
[46:22] provided some better thing for us that
[46:24] they without us should not be made
[46:26] perfect amen they were going to see
[46:29] their promise when we're all gathered
[46:31] together amen well that marriage supper
[46:36] of the Lamb amen they're gonna see that
[46:38] promises then hallelujah that's where
[46:41] they are going to see it hallelujah
[46:43] like we know with Cornelius his
[46:46] memorials were before God his prayer
[46:48] arms and passing that was a memorial
[46:50] before God maybe he didn't see that
[46:52] reward but the angel saw it
[46:54] I wonder which angels of walk around
[46:56] heaven same I look at sister Connie's
[46:58] vow
[46:59] of prayers and good deeds in alms amen
[47:02] and we're like we gotta ever done
[47:03] anything for you but God seen every
[47:05] prayer you prayed amen
[47:07] not seen every person you helped out
[47:10] financially
[47:10] that you hardly hang up there but dad
[47:13] seen everyone Amen if the Angels can
[47:17] witness to us this morning they would
[47:18] tell us don't meet a scourge there's a
[47:20] reward up there amen God sees everything
[47:23] you did and whether you see the promise
[47:26] now later heaven doesn't miss a thing
[47:28] amen hallelujah God doesn't miss a thing
[47:31] although everybody else you may fire to
[47:34] the radar but in God's eyes in fact
[47:36] you're more important than all the
[47:38] preachers even the ladies even more
[47:41] important than the preachers you say
[47:42] prove that by the Bible I love to 1st
[47:45] Corinthians chapter 12 proves it the
[47:47] Bible says those that we see outwardly
[47:49] we give them more honor two and he's
[47:52] talking about the hand and the body but
[47:55] the Bible says God gives more honor to
[47:57] the inward parts who's the real heart
[48:01] and soul of the church is it just the
[48:03] preacher the outward one that everybody
[48:05] sees or is it the laity who's the inside
[48:10] who's the real heart of the church yeah
[48:15] amen who's the real so who's the one
[48:19] that God really really sees who's the
[48:22] real part the most important part is the
[48:24] laity is that right
[48:27] remember what does the Antichrist spirit
[48:28] do but America the Antichrist spirit
[48:30] tries to take all the Holy Ghost up and
[48:33] put it in the priest well the cats in
[48:36] the Catholic Church or the preachers are
[48:39] with me Church which board is more
[48:42] important
[48:43] which part is is it the preacher the ad
[48:45] the loyalty amen is the preacher yes we
[48:49] have an important part but we are not
[48:51] alone everybody must have anointing
[48:54] everybody must serve God everybody must
[48:57] be alive everybody must do their part
[48:59] well Barney praise God you can live
[49:02] without your finger if you get your
[49:04] finger amputated you can live without
[49:06] your arm but you'll not live without
[49:08] your heart amen
[49:10] you'll not live without your lungs
[49:12] you'll not live with out the inward
[49:14] parts of you church you might not see
[49:16] your rewards and your fruit on this side
[49:18] but God sees it amen hallelujah you
[49:23] might not even see in this life you
[49:25] might die in it like your life might
[49:27] look like a disgrace to the world but if
[49:30] you serve God and you invest in the
[49:32] kingdom of God thank God has a great
[49:34] reward for you so the thing to do is
[49:37] invest in the kingdom of God well I
[49:39] didn't plan on preaching that so I thank
[49:41] the Lord for the Hetzer verse 6 see Paul
[49:47] taught a widow is admitted to the
[49:48] distinction at 60 years old and not
[49:50] before
[49:50] that's a real strict requirements to be
[49:52] a widow in the Bible and then he rebuked
[49:55] the women that left the faith just to
[49:56] get married so God God had his prophets
[50:00] say listen you got to be faithful he
[50:01] said you got to wash the Saints feet if
[50:03] you want to be a widow and get daily
[50:05] helping all these things you got to meet
[50:06] all these requirements I don't quite
[50:10] understand that myself but that's what
[50:12] the word says now 66 I'm not sure but
[50:15] there's 66 in the Bible books rather
[50:18] Isaiah has 66 chapters program said
[50:21] Isaiah is a small mini Bible I just got
[50:25] done reading that this year jacob 66
[50:29] people in the egypt just from his family
[50:32] a mother was purified after giving birth
[50:35] to a baby girl 66 days afterward
[50:39] interesting so I really get I can't see
[50:42] all of it you know a Bible the full
[50:45] testimony of God it's interesting so
[50:50] just thought I'd share that with you
[50:51] makes you think as your bridge your
[50:52] gears turning out there 7 now it looks
[50:56] to me like 70 represents laborers or
[50:59] workers that's what it looks like to me
[51:03] from the scripture because Joe Jacobs
[51:06] Souls and and Joseph Souls totaled 70 in
[51:10] Egypt the Bible says and what they go
[51:12] down here they go down there and they
[51:13] got in slavery God put and this is
[51:20] sure God put Moses's spirit on 70 elders
[51:24] that help them bear his burden to work
[51:28] oh god I need help God said I'll send
[51:31] you 70 workers to bear your burden and
[51:34] we know Jesus that God did the same
[51:36] thing for Jesus right
[51:37] he gave him 12 but then he said I'm
[51:39] gonna give you 7 I'm gonna send out 70
[51:41] more hey now you know this group
[51:45] actually became what the Pharisees
[51:46] called the Sanhedrin Council right you
[51:49] know that probably if not now you know
[51:51] it but you know the Jews looked at that
[51:53] you know all those years after Moses and
[51:54] well we should have a saying he we
[51:55] should have a council they called the
[51:57] Sanhedrin Council so 70 was the number
[52:01] of labor the Bible says were given 70
[52:06] years of lengths of years to labor the
[52:10] days of our years are threescore years
[52:12] and ten and if my reason of strength
[52:14] they be fourscore years yet is their
[52:16] strength labor and sorrow for it is soon
[52:18] cut off and we fly away so david says
[52:22] praise the Lord you got seventy years if
[52:23] you're a little stronger the labor
[52:25] you'll get eighty ah holiday yeah I met
[52:31] third I'm almost at 40 church of almost
[52:32] halfway this is 280 oh my life is
[52:36] managing so I want to be serious I want
[52:39] to be devoted I want to be dead yet I
[52:41] want to invest because I know God was
[52:43] Labour's and this kingdom Amen so I've
[52:49] got to take care of my body but I got to
[52:50] eat healthier I got an exercise I got to
[52:52] take care of this body in order to make
[52:54] sure this body can serve Christ 70 years
[53:02] of captivity the Bible said or labor for
[53:05] Israel Babylon because Israel had
[53:07] neglected the Sabbath years so God said
[53:10] because you didn't let the land rest now
[53:12] you're gonna work for seven years as a
[53:14] slave mine that's striking and then that
[53:19] escape from the sword carried he away to
[53:21] Babylon where they were servants to him
[53:23] and his sons until the reign of the
[53:25] kingdom of Persia you have a reading in
[53:27] Jenna Maya Jeremiah prophesied of those
[53:28] seventy years you know that right church
[53:31] he was he was so many times thrown in
[53:33] jail
[53:34] so he was thrown in a miry pit I wonder
[53:37] if that's where we get the song he
[53:38] brought me out of the miry clay I just
[53:40] read that this week gentlemen Jeremiah
[53:42] was thrown in a miry pit and somebody
[53:44] had to say hey he's gonna die he's
[53:46] sinking in the mire if we don't save him
[53:48] to the King Zedekiah said fine go pull
[53:50] him out he threw him in there because
[53:52] his prophesying that Nebuchadnezzar was
[53:55] going to overtake Jerusalem and so they
[53:58] went off and got some old rag rusty
[54:01] rented rags wrapped it together throw
[54:04] him down they put him under his armpits
[54:05] and they pull him up out of the pit
[54:07] that's God's prophet right and preachers
[54:11] thing today well I gotta have a million
[54:13] dollars or God's not with me unless I
[54:17] I'm blessed and notion and not stress
[54:19] I'm stressed and not blessed or whatever
[54:21] they say foolishness whenever you take a
[54:24] stand for God's word you're gonna be
[54:26] rejected amen
[54:28] you're gonna suffer amen he was a real
[54:33] man of God and it was after the first
[54:35] time that he was incarcerated he said
[54:37] God I'm not going to talk for you
[54:39] anymore
[54:40] and he said all of a sudden there was a
[54:41] fire that come up not in the prison cell
[54:44] he was in a prison cell but amen but the
[54:46] fire wasn't in the prison cell he said
[54:48] the fire was shut up in my bones amen
[54:52] yet he's in the middle of a prison
[54:55] getting Starr getting one piece of bread
[54:57] every day amen the fire wasn't in the
[55:00] prison the followers in his soul
[55:02] hallelujah let persecution happen to you
[55:07] like that and me and then then let's get
[55:10] some fire in our souls then let's talk
[55:12] about fire in our souls but now you just
[55:15] have one little trial or then fire I
[55:17] feel the fire in my bones well that
[55:19] might be true but listen the real fire
[55:21] comes when you have a real trial amen
[55:24] these were real men of God these saints
[55:27] that law was not worthy of them how to
[55:29] do you suffered hated beaten locked up
[55:36] they were real men of God and women of
[55:38] God amen
[55:39] our lives pale in comparison as far as
[55:42] the physical
[55:45] this but we got the got the speed of the
[55:48] mind our mind battles are harder but our
[55:50] physical is not harder obviously and the
[55:53] church said so lets god help us or not
[55:56] to complain amen to fulfill the word of
[56:00] the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until
[56:02] the land had enjoyed her Sabbath for as
[56:04] long as she lay down so she kept sabbath
[56:06] to fulfill threescore and ten years my
[56:12] every year the priest would blow the
[56:13] trumpet through it's the seventh year
[56:17] gertrude give the land rest and they
[56:20] leave the church and say yeah right and
[56:23] the next monday morning they get out
[56:25] there around so actually sunday morning
[56:27] they get out there and they go plant and
[56:28] the priests are like I just told you you
[56:30] got a rest he's like well I'm gonna have
[56:32] food next year and the priest would be
[56:34] like but God promised amen
[56:36] trust is the promise of God and they did
[56:39] that for all those years and finally
[56:41] said that's fine God said this land
[56:44] needs rest and if you don't let it rest
[56:47] I'm sending you away for 70 years so
[56:48] this land can rest see how much God
[56:51] appreciates you and I to rest
[56:54] you have got to rest your body and mind
[56:58] you've got to take a vacation amen and
[57:02] spend it with Jesus Christ amen and the
[57:05] church don't leave the church because
[57:06] when people leave a church they get in
[57:08] big trouble
[57:10] now we know the real rest is the baptism
[57:12] the Holy Ghost that's the one we ought
[57:13] to be but Church most of us are born
[57:15] again here and if that's true then you
[57:17] need to rest your your body and not get
[57:20] overworked and stressed out so you can
[57:21] actually come to church and enjoy it
[57:23] [Music]
[57:24] hallelujah praise God program said this
[57:30] is an int do you realize I'm trying to
[57:32] realize this more MORE
[57:33] this is an insane age will go crazy if
[57:39] we don't rest our minds and bodies and
[57:41] shut down the Wi-Fi and shut down the
[57:44] notifications and just spend time
[57:46] meditating on the things of God go crazy
[57:51] the guy was showing this with the land
[57:53] you've got to let that land rest
[57:55] you've got to honor my word amen
[58:01] Jesus Jesus Christ had God in the flesh
[58:05] he was God in the flesh and the Bible
[58:08] said he would take time to leave and
[58:09] leave the multitudes and go up to pray
[58:14] Jesus Christ he had the greatest
[58:16] anointing on him right no man could have
[58:19] a greater 90 and he realized this
[58:21] anointing is great but my body's getting
[58:23] worn out hallelujah and I've got to give
[58:28] my body some rest
[58:29] and I've got to pray to my father and
[58:32] I've got to get a loan now it works best
[58:34] when you're in the prayer closet because
[58:36] that's where Jesus said go pray there to
[58:39] get in a place where you can pray and
[58:40] see God but don't neglect the house of
[58:42] God amen rest your body rest your mind
[58:47] 70 weeks the prophecy of Daniel which
[58:49] was actually 490 years until the
[58:52] culmination of Israel in the Millennium
[58:55] you know this the Bible said seventy
[58:56] weeks are determined upon thy people and
[58:58] upon thy holy city to finish the
[59:00] transgression to make an end of sin so
[59:03] see what's happening there's a lot of
[59:04] work going on here seventy weeks of work
[59:08] make an end of sin make a reconciliation
[59:12] all he's doing all these things and the
[59:14] last thing is annoying to the most holy
[59:16] and program said that's Jesus getting
[59:19] anointed or being the anointed priests
[59:22] in the new Millennial temple amen
[59:24] in Ezekiel 43 if you ever read I read
[59:27] this week that's Jesus being the
[59:30] anointed son of God the Son of David a
[59:33] man taking his position in the new
[59:36] Millennial temple to reign over all the
[59:38] earth for a thousand years amen
[59:40] at the end of the work of God amen
[59:44] that's the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel
[59:47] praise God that's where Israel finally
[59:50] is completed and now God's gonna have
[59:52] his one day with his bride his honeymoon
[59:56] well Jewish and Gentile bride honeymoon
[59:59] amen
[1:00:00] because Christ is now finished Christ is
[1:00:03] anointed most holy in the temple
[1:00:06] praise God we
[1:00:10] this from our text Jesus sends out 70
[1:00:13] additional what were they Labour's and
[1:00:15] he said my there's so many souls out
[1:00:17] there the harvest is great but the
[1:00:19] laborers are few
[1:00:20] remember the Bible said God will not
[1:00:22] lose one if you feel the pole to be a
[1:00:27] laborers do something then you better
[1:00:29] make sure it's God right there's a
[1:00:33] scripture I want to bring out to get
[1:00:35] your Bibles here handy look look at this
[1:00:37] it's in the New Testament let me look it
[1:00:40] up this was so striking to me I just sat
[1:00:46] there and stare at the computer Luke
[1:00:47] chapter 9 jesus' window of ministry
[1:00:52] church was so small that when he invited
[1:00:57] people to join his preaching team will
[1:01:00] say like that or his church they had to
[1:01:03] make a decision on the spot and church
[1:01:06] every times maybe God will may give that
[1:01:09] decision to you
[1:01:10] we're so urgent you have to do the will
[1:01:14] of God right luke 9:62
[1:01:20] but actually let's go to 57 that's where
[1:01:23] we want to go and it came to pass and as
[1:01:25] they went in the way a certain man went
[1:01:26] said unto Him Lord I will follow thee
[1:01:29] whithersoever thou goest now Jesus had
[1:01:31] not sent out the 70 yet so these men
[1:01:35] he's gonna call he's inviting them to be
[1:01:37] a part of the 70 labors oh my goodness
[1:01:40] and this man says I'll go wherever you
[1:01:44] go you go Jesus because he saw the
[1:01:46] miracles he thought prosperity
[1:01:48] prosperity so how does Jesus humble him
[1:01:50] and make him realize this ain't all
[1:01:52] about miracles boy verse 50 and Jesus
[1:01:56] said unto him you're gonna raise the
[1:01:59] dead cast out devils be a millionaire
[1:02:02] the member he's always the word right
[1:02:05] he's always discerning people's motives
[1:02:07] and objectives amen he's like I'll do
[1:02:09] whatever you want
[1:02:10] we got to be careful Church when we say
[1:02:12] that I'll do whatever you want Jesus huh
[1:02:14] sacrifice anything you want you better
[1:02:16] be careful what you say because he's
[1:02:19] going to prove it to you the Bible said
[1:02:22] he proves all the hearts
[1:02:24] look at that foxes have holes so this
[1:02:28] man was thinking about palaces and
[1:02:31] that's what the Pentecostals thought
[1:02:33] about brother branham will take your
[1:02:34] message to the big up-and-up so oh my
[1:02:36] goodness he's there the big nerve
[1:02:39] centers number lookup nerve centers
[1:02:40] let's go to big panic elitism sins
[1:02:46] embracing Jesus though it's not the
[1:02:48] castile pearls before swine he said well
[1:02:50] that's a tough one right there
[1:02:52] see brother Manu many of those
[1:02:54] organizations were only interested in
[1:02:57] money and when it came down to the word
[1:03:00] water baptism so fancied women now
[1:03:02] preach it holiness modesty all these
[1:03:05] things but a man knew that these were
[1:03:07] poles and they would just step on them
[1:03:11] so why does Jesus correct this young man
[1:03:14] has got all this now you would think
[1:03:15] this and for me this would be the kind
[1:03:17] of person I want to come to our church
[1:03:18] well Jesse I'll do anything you ask me
[1:03:21] to do I kind of get excited things about
[1:03:24] that right now
[1:03:25] what have you come up every Church to
[1:03:27] say brother well I'll do anything you
[1:03:29] told me what to do I'll do it and what
[1:03:34] does Jesus say foxes have holes and
[1:03:36] birds of the air have nests but the Son
[1:03:38] of man hath not where to lay his head
[1:03:41] see he's discerning spirits here listen
[1:03:44] if you follow me you ain't gonna have a
[1:03:46] home it ain't gonna be easy it's the
[1:03:49] hard road see the way of miracles we
[1:03:52] want to see more miracles we got to get
[1:03:53] more dedicated to God we have to be more
[1:03:58] dedicated it's a hard road it's more
[1:04:00] it's more sacrifice right it's more
[1:04:03] dedication verse 59 and he said another
[1:04:06] follow me but he said Lord suffer me
[1:04:08] first to go and bury my father
[1:04:11] but Jesus has already said seek ye first
[1:04:13] the kingdom of God amen
[1:04:16] haha he said let me first do this and
[1:04:21] Jesus said no no there's a short little
[1:04:24] window here amen now he knew jesus knew
[1:04:27] seventy we're going to leave him
[1:04:28] eventually too in John chapter 6 when he
[1:04:31] started preaching about you know my body
[1:04:32] is bread and my brother's wine they all
[1:04:36] walked away and said this guy's
[1:04:37] this message is just too much I can't
[1:04:40] handle this sir fancy talk what do you
[1:04:42] mean serpent Apple
[1:04:43] it wasn't an apple what do you mean it
[1:04:44] was a sex act that's exactly right and
[1:04:47] geez didn't even turn around explain it
[1:04:49] he just said go if you get it if you've
[1:04:52] seen all these miracles if you've seen
[1:04:54] me live a godly life amen and if there's
[1:04:58] enough to convince her than faith
[1:04:59] there's a no he turns around say you
[1:05:01] twelve want to go to but he knew those
[1:05:07] that were ordained he knew from the
[1:05:09] beginning who would believe in who
[1:05:11] wouldn't believe he knew there's a
[1:05:13] little flock that would stay with him
[1:05:14] because they loved and that's you and I
[1:05:18] today amen
[1:05:23] follow me sinto you see he put he put
[1:05:26] his family he put a funeral before the
[1:05:28] kingdom now don't get confused I went to
[1:05:32] a funeral this week funerals are part of
[1:05:34] the kingdom sometimes robe and did many
[1:05:36] funerals but Jesus saying you got a
[1:05:40] chance to be one of these seventy
[1:05:41] preachers now look Jesus must have known
[1:05:43] that this guy once he got home and had
[1:05:46] the funeral let's say it was his dad
[1:05:47] that passed away yeah well then who's
[1:05:51] gonna take care of the mom the son is
[1:05:55] that right so jesus knew with you go
[1:05:58] back you ain't gonna go out and preach
[1:06:00] with me and he might thought what Jesus
[1:06:03] is he's so mean who's gonna take care of
[1:06:06] my mom and Jesus said my Heavenly Father
[1:06:10] if God so clothe the grass of the field
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] if God feeds the birds that don't even
[1:06:18] play how much more will God give you
[1:06:21] your needs
[1:06:22] oh ye of little faith they met oh my I
[1:06:26] wasn't expected to preachers today the
[1:06:28] Holy Spirit's here praise God that's not
[1:06:30] even my notes really that's that see he
[1:06:36] knew
[1:06:36] once he gets home he's gonna be
[1:06:38] pressured to stay there and he won't go
[1:06:40] out and be one of my preachers in my
[1:06:42] ministry and look he'd given a straight
[1:06:49] direction he didn't say consider
[1:06:50] following me he said follow me
[1:06:54] he didn't say pray about following me
[1:06:57] we got it's good we almost everything we
[1:07:00] knew we got do pray first right but
[1:07:03] here's the son of God saying follow me
[1:07:05] got one chance and they know was gonna
[1:07:07] be three and a half years or the short
[1:07:08] amount of time and so he says let the
[1:07:13] dead bury the dead he must have known
[1:07:16] they weren't spiritually alive to his
[1:07:18] message in his ministry I wonder if his
[1:07:20] guy was at when the Pharisee family they
[1:07:23] were spiritually dead right let the
[1:07:25] spiritually dead bury their physically
[1:07:28] dead amen Church it goes to show there's
[1:07:32] only life in the message of the hour
[1:07:34] amen glory the rest of them are dead but
[1:07:39] the current ministry we say like this
[1:07:41] the fivefold ministry
[1:07:43] there's only live in the message of the
[1:07:45] or the ministries of Jesus Christ is
[1:07:47] personally speaking through amen let the
[1:07:51] dead bury their dead the priests and the
[1:07:54] Pharisees and the Sadducees let them
[1:07:57] bury their dead follow me glory but go
[1:08:05] down
[1:08:06] reach the kingdom of God I don't think
[1:08:09] we're gonna get to the end of this
[1:08:10] message verse 61 another also said Lord
[1:08:14] I will follow thee but let me first see
[1:08:17] that's the trouble we got with first
[1:08:20] everybody wants to be first above the
[1:08:22] kingdom of God and the church said you
[1:08:25] and I gotta make sure nothing comes
[1:08:27] before the kingdom of God being first
[1:08:30] that's why this church needs to be your
[1:08:32] first not me the church because this
[1:08:37] church is the ministry and it's
[1:08:39] extension of Jesus Christ body that's
[1:08:41] why you put the church before everything
[1:08:44] else
[1:08:45] only if you're a missionary you put
[1:08:48] other churches in front of this church
[1:08:50] hello that's what he says here that's he
[1:08:54] said first see there's a trouble at
[1:08:55] first everybody wants something else to
[1:08:57] be first
[1:08:58] my family's funeral in this case he said
[1:09:02] let me go say goodbye
[1:09:03] and so Jesus must have known when he
[1:09:05] went to say goodbye they were gonna
[1:09:06] plead with him and beg him to stay Jesus
[1:09:09] must have known he didn't have faith
[1:09:10] like Rebecca hahaha I got one chance and
[1:09:14] she said I'm out of here right I'm going
[1:09:16] to see my husband I feel the poor but
[1:09:21] Jesus must have known this guy could
[1:09:23] have been persuaded to stay around I
[1:09:27] can't leave my little brother
[1:09:29] can't leave my little sister I'll preach
[1:09:33] when I'm older no this was the time
[1:09:36] where this was done see God visited him
[1:09:40] in a personal visitation and let me say
[1:09:42] like this when God visits you in a
[1:09:44] personal visitation that's the time you
[1:09:46] just surrender all right so you know
[1:09:53] which are at home at my house sees my is
[1:09:58] his house is more important in God's
[1:10:00] house let me first go to my house and
[1:10:04] say goodbye see God's house has got to
[1:10:06] be number one it isn't my house praise
[1:10:12] God
[1:10:12] Wednesday Sunday is the highlights of my
[1:10:14] week of my life come in the house of God
[1:10:17] being with the body of Jesus Christ
[1:10:18] feeding the body of
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ and to find the body of
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:23] that's we're all here to edify one
[1:10:26] another praise God verse 62 and Jesus
[1:10:29] and him no man having put his hand to
[1:10:31] the plow and looking back is fit for the
[1:10:34] kingdom of God oh my goodness
[1:10:38] see how imported is and church you know
[1:10:42] you don't know it you'll know the the
[1:10:46] moment when God's asking you to
[1:10:48] surrender all you'll know it they would
[1:10:51] have had to known because remember Jesus
[1:10:53] of the certain thoughts intents of the
[1:10:54] heart
[1:10:54] so this man must have been having a mind
[1:10:56] battle here it's just my time to follow
[1:10:59] Christ sir he must been deal with that
[1:11:01] and then Jesus says no you got a you've
[1:11:03] got a work hard and you got to follow me
[1:11:06] and don't look back you must then have
[1:11:08] him battles about should I go back and
[1:11:10] Jesus must have discerned exactly his
[1:11:13] thoughts and so he known my art was
[1:11:16] discern I've got to go with Christ and
[1:11:19] that's what happens to you when you got
[1:11:21] a question in your heart and the Word of
[1:11:22] God comes and you're here sincerely you
[1:11:24] confess all your sin and the Word of God
[1:11:26] discerns your situation you and I need
[1:11:28] to obey the Word of God we know bei what
[1:11:32] the word says you and I should know if
[1:11:34] it's discerning our hearts if you can
[1:11:36] say well there's a greater than Jesse
[1:11:37] Smith here and there always is when
[1:11:39] Christ is here because I'm nothing amen
[1:11:40] no preachers anything bender on or cam
[1:11:43] Smith there's there's no other greater
[1:11:45] you and I should know when Jesus Christ
[1:11:47] is dealing with our hearts amen we
[1:11:50] should be able to say this is the time
[1:11:54] what if that I'm a so member and Konica
[1:11:58] falls in 2006 when I was praying God
[1:12:01] show me if I we should start a church
[1:12:03] and I thought should be the pastor I was
[1:12:06] praying I was just sitting on the toilet
[1:12:08] I think I just you know gave Lydia bath
[1:12:11] and she was there and uh you know she
[1:12:12] sees there in a bath I'm just sitting
[1:12:14] there reading my Bible and she's all
[1:12:15] playing in her towel I think Malachi was
[1:12:18] on the way I said God have been praying
[1:12:21] about this for so long
[1:12:22] should we start a church am i and I
[1:12:24] asked God Lord of mine mature enough to
[1:12:27] be a pastor and I just
[1:12:30] my Bibles - one time I did the Bible
[1:12:32] roulette and I went like this and I open
[1:12:36] it up it was first Timothy let me go
[1:12:39] there real quick so I can quote it and
[1:12:43] that's not the way it works for
[1:12:44] everybody but yes first Timothy 4:12 my
[1:12:47] eyes weren't right - that it was oh it
[1:12:49] wasn't in this Bibles in a different
[1:12:50] Bible it was the only thing highlighted
[1:12:52] on the page my eyes aren't right - that
[1:12:53] let no man despise thy youth but be thou
[1:12:57] an example of the believers in Word in
[1:13:00] conversation in charity in spirit and
[1:13:03] faith and purity till i come give
[1:13:05] attendance to reading exhortation to
[1:13:07] doctrine neglect not the gift that is in
[1:13:10] thee which was given thee by prophecy
[1:13:11] with the laying on of the hands of the
[1:13:14] presbytery amen and I base this whole
[1:13:19] thing on that scripture praise God now
[1:13:23] to me but here that was the moment Jesus
[1:13:26] saying come follow me
[1:13:27] I could have said well let me move back
[1:13:30] home first and start a church I could've
[1:13:34] made all of these excuses wait till we
[1:13:36] get more than just seven people you know
[1:13:38] bang was one of the seven well you're
[1:13:39] one of the original seven praise God
[1:13:41] sevens completion he's one of the
[1:13:44] original pillars and he's still a pillar
[1:13:45] praise God start a church with seven
[1:13:49] people that's what the Word of God said
[1:13:50] Amen that's what God's Way and led us to
[1:13:53] do and that was my moment like either
[1:13:56] turn back or I could follow Christ and
[1:14:00] so I decided to follow Jesus Christ now
[1:14:02] the reason I say that it's not to prop
[1:14:04] me up or this church but to let you know
[1:14:06] there will be times in your life when
[1:14:08] you know God is speaking to you and
[1:14:10] he'll give you a choice either this or
[1:14:12] that and I say surrender Amen neighbor
[1:14:16] for the kingdom of God seek ye first the
[1:14:19] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[1:14:22] all these other things will be added
[1:14:24] that has been my story
[1:14:25] God has added everything I needed since
[1:14:27] I've done that have I had all times sure
[1:14:29] but nothing too hard that the Holy Ghost
[1:14:31] can't give me victory in hey glory
[1:14:36] now if
[1:14:38] the Bible the next yeah so we read Luke
[1:14:41] nine that's how the chapter ends Jesus
[1:14:44] saying that he's calling people to the
[1:14:45] seventy they're saying no I can't go I
[1:14:47] can't go making all these excuses and
[1:14:49] then finally invert chapter 10 he finds
[1:14:51] 70 that he can send out so I'm letting
[1:14:53] you know there's times in your life
[1:14:54] where you'll know God's dealing with you
[1:14:57] and you have to surrender and you won't
[1:15:00] have time to go to your funeral because
[1:15:02] you're doing the will of God praise God
[1:15:05] you won't have time to go back and say
[1:15:08] goodbye because God's got a work for you
[1:15:11] and he's testing your faith
[1:15:13] listen Church you don't know one of the
[1:15:16] reasons Peter got the keys to the
[1:15:17] kingdom
[1:15:17] God knew he was gonna he was gonna deny
[1:15:20] him God knew all these things but one of
[1:15:23] the reasons God saw fit to give Peter
[1:15:25] the keys to the kingdom because when
[1:15:27] Jesus walked by he said Peter follow me
[1:15:30] you know what he did he didn't take his
[1:15:32] nets and say oh let me put these in my
[1:15:35] backpack and I'll go with you the Bible
[1:15:38] said he was in the middle of fixing the
[1:15:40] Nets was he not and the Bible said he
[1:15:42] dropped it like a bad habit and his dad
[1:15:47] was sitting right there amen and John's
[1:15:50] dad Zebedee was sitting right there
[1:15:52] James and John and they literally walk
[1:15:56] away and said I just feel anointed to
[1:15:57] follow that guy and godly look so he's
[1:16:00] gonna have mistakes he's going to be a
[1:16:02] little kind at times but wants to get
[1:16:04] the Holy Ghost he's gonna have the keys
[1:16:06] to the king baby because he lost oh he
[1:16:11] turned and he didn't look back amen
[1:16:13] he saw his face to the prow did he
[1:16:16] stumble sometimes a bird on the ground
[1:16:18] and make a fool of himself yes
[1:16:20] sometimes you will too but never look
[1:16:23] back
[1:16:23] never give up surrender and follow Jesus
[1:16:27] Christ very men are some anointing here
[1:16:30] today amen the vagueness wasn't in any
[1:16:33] of my notes some anointing here today
[1:16:40] these are my notes I don't have any
[1:16:43] other notes you know Saint imitated 70
[1:16:47] know that
[1:16:48] remember this zqa
[1:16:52] God said Ezekiel I'm going to show you
[1:16:54] the abominations in Israel they start at
[1:16:57] the outer gate on the second step they
[1:17:00] go into the image chambers of imagery
[1:17:03] this is the second out of four step
[1:17:06] because remember there's four horse
[1:17:07] riders there's four stages to the
[1:17:09] Antichrist spirit there was the same
[1:17:11] thing in the Old Testament
[1:17:13] just like by man so there's seven church
[1:17:15] age in the Old Testament I got to study
[1:17:16] on that I've never studied on that but
[1:17:17] I'm starting to see mind there's so many
[1:17:18] parallels here there's 70 ancients of
[1:17:22] Israel that burn incense and the
[1:17:23] chambers of imagery as the second out of
[1:17:25] four abominations it seemed to
[1:17:27] impersonate the 70 elders of Moses and
[1:17:33] the Bible said there was there in the
[1:17:36] chamber there was images abominable
[1:17:39] images all over the walls and the 70 men
[1:17:42] they're worshipping see it's Satan
[1:17:46] imitating 70 70 looks good its Labour's
[1:17:49] but see they were laboring for selfish
[1:17:50] gain labor late labor they were laboring
[1:17:54] for the pleasures of sin remember
[1:17:57] Hebrews 11 said Moses chose not to take
[1:17:59] the pleasures of sin for season so these
[1:18:03] 70 must have been benefiting money-wise
[1:18:05] or maybe pride or popularity wise they
[1:18:08] must been benefiting from having all
[1:18:09] these abominations in their church that
[1:18:12] sounds preachers today they let
[1:18:14] abominations go in their church as long
[1:18:16] as they're making the big bucks as long
[1:18:18] as they're being popular
[1:18:20] I say God keep us small keep us little
[1:18:22] do whatever you have to do let the Holy
[1:18:24] Ghost be here that always be filled with
[1:18:29] grace and mercy amen the halls that be
[1:18:33] covered with sin and debauchery and evil
[1:18:36] abominations they'll ever be covered
[1:18:38] with the bread of Jesus Christ amen see
[1:18:43] there were 70 workers but they were
[1:18:45] working for abominable purposes
[1:18:47] abominable
[1:18:49] just remember the last one was Sun
[1:18:52] worship and moon worship idolatry and
[1:18:57] that's a lot a lot what we got today
[1:18:59] people idolized brother branham so you
[1:19:03] got we got apply it to today how is it
[1:19:05] today we can't really idolize Jesus
[1:19:07] really so they got to idolize something
[1:19:10] that's close to Christ they idolized
[1:19:13] something right there so there are lies
[1:19:15] on something that she shouldn't be
[1:19:16] idolizing now in the book I've been
[1:19:20] reading Bellinger skips all the way from
[1:19:23] 70 to 120
[1:19:24] but there's numbers in here I just want
[1:19:26] to lay in here okay bear with me I'm
[1:19:29] just gonna go through here God called
[1:19:31] Abram at 75 the church if you haven't
[1:19:36] got your calling yet just wait on God
[1:19:39] sweet right he knows the right time to
[1:19:44] call you some reason God wanted to him
[1:19:48] to be 75 and then giving a call
[1:19:51] Moses was let older he was Haiti when he
[1:19:55] finally got the call to come down and
[1:19:56] deliver Egypt just you stay at your post
[1:20:00] of duty just keep waiting on the Lord
[1:20:02] you'll know when he's calling you they
[1:20:06] got a TI like this
[1:20:07] they got 80 years of rest after Eva
[1:20:11] delivered them 80 years of rest praise
[1:20:14] God
[1:20:14] I'll say like this church I honestly
[1:20:17] feel people have been asking me as I go
[1:20:18] to different place like cams Church and
[1:20:20] Pennsylvania last night they're like
[1:20:22] how's everything going and like I don't
[1:20:23] really like their asking how's it going
[1:20:25] at the church and what's come to me is
[1:20:26] just we've had a period of rest haven't
[1:20:30] had like major battles right like in the
[1:20:32] church and I think thank the Lord
[1:20:35] because you might not have seen it but
[1:20:37] last year had some major battles it was
[1:20:40] verified by dreams amen and by the word
[1:20:44] and so I look at it as God's giving us
[1:20:47] some time of rest so during the time of
[1:20:51] rest what you do pray enjoy the word
[1:20:53] hear the word feast on the word grow up
[1:20:55] because there's coming to battle church
[1:20:57] that always days we know we don't know
[1:21:00] where but we got to be ready and we got
[1:21:01] to be strong
[1:21:02] we gotta be solid we gotta gather more
[1:21:04] together we gotta be closer together we
[1:21:06] got to be real solid Christians amen
[1:21:09] this program said God got program even
[1:21:12] told the tabernacle God or Saint won't
[1:21:14] let you stay that sweet group he'll send
[1:21:16] somebody
[1:21:17] he'll inject somebody with some poison
[1:21:19] and send him into you so we better watch
[1:21:22] who joins a church in the next few
[1:21:24] months and maybe he'll never said if
[1:21:29] Satan can't inject somebody already in
[1:21:31] the church you'll inject somebody with
[1:21:32] the poison and send them in remember he
[1:21:41] said 80 years of your life if you're
[1:21:42] strong Moses called to 80 and that's in
[1:21:46] there some 80 years of rest Anna was 84
[1:21:50] the prophetess when she gave thanks at
[1:21:52] Jesus circumcision along with Simeon I
[1:21:54] don't know how old Simeon was though the
[1:21:56] own the Bible and tells us she was 84
[1:21:58] and she was a real widow to imagine that
[1:22:01] 84 years but a man she waited and
[1:22:03] finally at 84 she gets the hold the Son
[1:22:05] of God she gets to hold God in flesh my
[1:22:10] 84 years old all those and the Bible
[1:22:12] said what was her ministry church she
[1:22:14] served the God with what prayers and
[1:22:16] fasting what's my purpose in life
[1:22:19] sometimes we wonder maybe it's come to
[1:22:22] the church and praying fast when
[1:22:23] nobody's here
[1:22:24] read your Bible that maybe for a day but
[1:22:28] let's not say that we don't need to do
[1:22:30] that we need to do that maybe that's
[1:22:34] some of your ministry to come here to
[1:22:35] church you got a day off are you
[1:22:37] something like that you come to church
[1:22:38] you pray and fast you shut in with God
[1:22:40] and you make that your ministry your
[1:22:42] reward will come gory just like Anna's
[1:22:46] reward came your reward will come might
[1:22:51] be when you're 84 Caleb was 85 when he
[1:22:55] took his Mountain amen
[1:22:56] and he said I'm just as strong now as I
[1:22:58] was then Moses called me Amen hallelujah
[1:23:02] he had to wait 45 years you know he was
[1:23:05] 45 when they called him now 80
[1:23:11] six Abrams age when Ishmael was born
[1:23:13] blares at eleven there's that 11 because
[1:23:16] 11 can be good loving can be the last
[1:23:17] call 11 can be confusion there was
[1:23:20] confusion right there 11 11 years after
[1:23:22] he was called I don't have time to write
[1:23:25] that down
[1:23:26] all right Jesus left the 99 to get the
[1:23:29] other one and Abraham was 99 when God
[1:23:32] discerned Sarah's heart I'm not I don't
[1:23:34] know how those go together
[1:23:36] 100 Abraham's age when Isaac was born a
[1:23:38] hundred Isaac was blessed a hundred fold
[1:23:41] in career sewing in that land can you
[1:23:44] imagine you put a hundred plants in the
[1:23:48] ground and now you got a thousand one
[1:23:51] hundred fold a hundred fold you multiply
[1:23:55] that our God is great church I don't
[1:23:59] know if those plants multiply like that
[1:24:01] or if God just supernaturally planted a
[1:24:03] hundred times more but that's what the
[1:24:05] Bible says amen 100 we'll give this a
[1:24:10] hundred Israelis would put ten thousand
[1:24:12] to flight in the promised land as long
[1:24:13] as they kept out idols that's wrong it's
[1:24:16] not on it's out idols one hundred
[1:24:21] shekels of silver paid a father for
[1:24:24] bringing evil name upon a virgin so if a
[1:24:26] man a young man came around and spoke
[1:24:27] evil about a virgin and they finally
[1:24:29] lied you had to pay a hundred shekels of
[1:24:31] silver to redeem that name 104 skin saw
[1:24:36] requested of David to marry ICO but we
[1:24:39] know he brought two hundred a hundred
[1:24:40] prophets that Obadiah hid from Jezebel
[1:24:44] well what about him what a man of God
[1:24:46] right there he saved a hundred Souls
[1:24:47] from being slain by Jezebel that's how
[1:24:50] I'm gonna I'm gonna hide people away
[1:24:52] from that Jezebel system a sorry under
[1:24:55] the total number of sheep before one
[1:24:57] left one hundred reward for those who've
[1:24:59] left out for Christ in this world in the
[1:25:00] world to come
[1:25:02] that's what Jesus Peter said Lord at the
[1:25:05] Richard ruler he said Lord we've left
[1:25:06] all what about us and he said you'll
[1:25:09] receive a hundredfold in this life and
[1:25:10] the life to come praise God
[1:25:17] one hundred
[1:25:18] fulness of the seed that fell in the
[1:25:20] ground see how hundreds teams represent
[1:25:21] fruitfulness maybe I don't know there's
[1:25:23] something with that because Isaac was
[1:25:24] 100 percent or 100 fold fruitless or
[1:25:27] fruitfulness hundredfold reward 100
[1:25:30] fruitfulness of the seed a hundred
[1:25:32] pounds of myrrh and aloes that Nicodemus
[1:25:34] brought for Jesus body to be buried oh I
[1:25:37] know he's going to get 100 full reward
[1:25:39] anytime you honor the word God's gonna
[1:25:42] honor you amen glory now I skip right up
[1:25:47] because after 100 them near so I could
[1:25:49] find is 120 there's 120 souls up in the
[1:25:52] upper room on day of Pentecost there's
[1:25:55] 120 is the full length of a human life
[1:25:57] God told that to Manila in Genesis 6 144
[1:26:02] the wall in the future home is 144
[1:26:04] cubits high just the wall and a cubit is
[1:26:08] a man's distance a Israelite man from
[1:26:12] his elbow to his middle finger 144 those
[1:26:14] tall that's just the wall 200 David his
[1:26:18] men brought back 200 foreskins 276 souls
[1:26:20] were in the ship with Paul all escaped
[1:26:22] to land 153 fish caught by Peter and the
[1:26:28] Apostles after Jesus resurrection now
[1:26:30] this is interesting
[1:26:31] 153 is 17 times 9 9 can mean
[1:26:34] fruitfulness because there's nine fruits
[1:26:35] of the spirit that's interesting 17 is
[1:26:38] the bride's number we showed that by the
[1:26:39] scripture for 17 nations there on the
[1:26:42] day of Pentecost 17 that's when God
[1:26:44] birthed its bride and Bollinger nodded
[1:26:50] and I didn't go through all hundred he
[1:26:52] listed all hundred 53 in his book he
[1:26:54] said there's a 153 people that directly
[1:26:56] interacted with Jesus Christ that
[1:26:58] received blessings from him in the four
[1:27:00] Gospels like if he went and he listed
[1:27:02] everyone I wasn't gonna have all the
[1:27:04] time to read all that but that's what he
[1:27:06] says that would make sense because it's
[1:27:07] it's like the people are coming to him
[1:27:09] you know the bride stands before his
[1:27:12] face you know they interact with him
[1:27:13] they're part of the body that would that
[1:27:15] would seem to be spiritual 300 is the
[1:27:18] size of Gideon's army after the final
[1:27:20] deduction remember they went down from
[1:27:22] 23,000 to 300 and they got stronger as
[1:27:26] they got smaller that's how the bride's
[1:27:27] gonna be Church she's gonna be smaller
[1:27:29] and smaller smaller but she's gonna get
[1:27:31] stronger and stronger and stronger
[1:27:33] right because that will give God glory
[1:27:36] big numbers will but a small minority
[1:27:39] that's trusting in the Living God allows
[1:27:42] God to get the glory 300 is the length
[1:27:46] of the measurement of Noah's Ark
[1:27:47] lengthwise 400 years Israel was an
[1:27:54] Egyptian Monday slavery I don't know
[1:27:57] what that's all about sorry about that
[1:27:59] that's not that would be awful Monday
[1:28:01] 400 years in Monday that'd be an awful
[1:28:03] Monday I hope that's not what tomorrow
[1:28:05] feels like for you
[1:28:07] 430 years after going into Egypt God
[1:28:10] gave the law to Moses remember that a
[1:28:12] little extra time because they wouldn't
[1:28:13] accept Moses 450 years Israelite judges
[1:28:17] until Samuel the Prophet came over 50
[1:28:20] years mine 490 times to forgive your
[1:28:25] brother according to Jesus 490 years God
[1:28:30] was giving Israel to the consummation
[1:28:31] 500 one creditor owed five hundred pence
[1:28:34] the other owed 50 though and that's the
[1:28:36] unprofitable servant he was forgiven
[1:28:38] five hundred but he couldn't forgive
[1:28:39] somebody at 50 Church if anybody's
[1:28:42] sinned against you please forgive them
[1:28:44] that's tonight forgive if that brother
[1:28:46] doesn't that friend doesn't come tonight
[1:28:47] we'll look at that this is one of the
[1:28:50] parables of the kingdom of heaven this
[1:28:52] is why people won't be in the bride
[1:28:53] because the bride is for the kingdom of
[1:28:55] heaven is for the bride right you have
[1:28:58] to be a bride member to be a part of the
[1:29:00] kingdom and fill with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] people don't receive the Holy Ghost many
[1:29:03] times because they won't forgive other
[1:29:05] people the Bible said that's roots of
[1:29:08] bitterness see that's a weed and that's
[1:29:10] the third heart condition amen where the
[1:29:12] weeds choke up the plant and it can't
[1:29:16] bring forth fruit this is a parable of
[1:29:19] the Kingdom of Heaven 500 you're
[1:29:23] forgiving 500 miles pray and I started
[1:29:24] crying I was praying up here now as we
[1:29:26] were praying for service and the
[1:29:28] scripture came to me she that's
[1:29:29] forgiving much love much why do you love
[1:29:33] Jesus so much does he forgave Mia so
[1:29:35] much I just got a little bit of
[1:29:38] forgiving to do but he forgave me of
[1:29:40] everything
[1:29:41] oh yeah that's a tenth right that's a
[1:29:47] tenth all right guys I'm asking you
[1:29:48] forgive he's got to given you a parallel
[1:29:51] you just got to forgive a tenth of the
[1:29:52] amount that I got to forgive and you
[1:29:54] won't even forgive somebody a tenth of
[1:29:56] what I forgave you know Jesus was seen
[1:30:00] above five hundred men at one time after
[1:30:02] his resurrection
[1:30:04] interesting Noah was 600 years old when
[1:30:07] the flood started 666 is the number of a
[1:30:10] man that Antichrist be careful a day
[1:30:12] it's the Pope's title 666 john 6:66 70
[1:30:17] of jesus disciples left him solomon
[1:30:21] received 666 go towns in one year and
[1:30:24] look what it did to him Church look what
[1:30:27] it did to him he backs that he married
[1:30:30] all those women the Bible said his women
[1:30:32] turned his heart away from God and the
[1:30:34] wrath of God rested on him he built a
[1:30:37] temple to every Idol that there was
[1:30:40] Church we got to be careful that we
[1:30:41] don't give an hour to this idol an hour
[1:30:43] to that Idol and three hours to the the
[1:30:47] New England Patriots Idol hallelujah
[1:30:51] right or all of our money to the fashion
[1:30:55] store they have the latest fashions you
[1:30:58] must not give it away we must build the
[1:31:00] kingdom of God amen
[1:31:03] see it's it's connected they're the
[1:31:06] Antichrist spirit got in Solomon's
[1:31:07] ministry now just know with Goliath
[1:31:12] these numbers do not add up to 666
[1:31:15] you just have three sixes everyone
[1:31:17] understand this doesn't add up to 666 so
[1:31:20] don't try oh you'll be embarrassed like
[1:31:22] I was he had six years height was six
[1:31:25] cubits six pieces of armor and his spear
[1:31:27] head was 600 so it only adds up to 612
[1:31:30] if you count the numbers but we're just
[1:31:32] sliding the six here and the six there
[1:31:35] and you can see okay Goliath kind of
[1:31:37] represents the Antichrist spirit
[1:31:38] David represents Christ he slays
[1:31:40] Antichrist spirit Nebuchadnezzar again
[1:31:44] this does not add up to 666
[1:31:47] but you see three sixes their height was
[1:31:50] 66 cubits broad and six musical
[1:31:53] instruments mentioned
[1:31:55] and that of course is a type of the
[1:31:57] Antichrist spirit we know that because
[1:32:00] it's the last one of the it was in the
[1:32:01] Gentile kingdoms right they're gonna
[1:32:03] make an image to a man pry the Pope
[1:32:05] could be brother branham right they're
[1:32:07] gonna make a holy man they got a bow
[1:32:10] down and worship him a thousand years of
[1:32:14] peace in the Millennium a thousand women
[1:32:16] Salman had a hundred women who turned
[1:32:18] away his heart a thousand a day with God
[1:32:21] as as a thousand years with man one
[1:32:25] thousand five Salman had this many songs
[1:32:26] the Bible says 1260 days this is the
[1:32:31] same as forty two months or three and a
[1:32:32] half years this is the length of time
[1:32:33] with a Ministry of the two prophets and
[1:32:35] it's also the length of time of Israel's
[1:32:37] time in the wilderness now this is
[1:32:40] interesting I preached us years ago but
[1:32:42] it seems like after the ministry of the
[1:32:47] prophets of Israel after that raptured
[1:32:49] there's more time for Israel to receive
[1:32:51] Jesus Christ as Messiah because the
[1:32:55] Bible says right after this in Daniel 12
[1:32:58] there's a hundred twelve
[1:32:59] oh sorry 1290 days instead of 60 and
[1:33:03] setup so there's like there's like
[1:33:05] another month from the time that daily
[1:33:08] sacrifices to be taken away unto the
[1:33:10] abomination that makes desolate set up
[1:33:13] so seems like Israel be sacrificing
[1:33:16] animals in their temple for three and a
[1:33:19] half years but after the prophets are
[1:33:23] taken away Rome will break the Covenant
[1:33:26] cut off the daily sacrifice and then a
[1:33:30] month later the abomination desolation
[1:33:32] that must be when the Pope walks in
[1:33:33] there I don't know I'm just that's based
[1:33:35] upon quotes I know whether Bram said he
[1:33:38] calls it the Roman domination desolation
[1:33:40] look at a Roman so Rome has to be Pope
[1:33:43] and the Pope's gonna send the temple of
[1:33:45] God saying he is God right so that's
[1:33:49] just my guess I'm just putting together
[1:33:50] I'm not trying to prophesy I'm just
[1:33:52] trying to put it together as a teacher
[1:33:54] you didn't hear me say they'll say at
[1:33:56] the Lord it's not insane now there's
[1:33:59] look there's even a longer time after
[1:34:01] this forty five more days after the
[1:34:05] abomination is set up the Bible said
[1:34:07] blessed is the man who
[1:34:09] for this number of days I wonder if
[1:34:11] that's the day they get borned again
[1:34:12] yeah yeah is the Bible said our nation
[1:34:16] will be born in one day hallelujah but
[1:34:19] they got to weep and more from house to
[1:34:21] house first and that's it we've been
[1:34:22] more than they receive Jesus Christ and
[1:34:25] the nations born in one day amen
[1:34:35] three thousand souls baptized this is
[1:34:38] beautiful on the day of Pentecost when
[1:34:40] the spiritual law was given oh you're
[1:34:41] under a law hey man I am under the law
[1:34:45] of the Holy Ghost you go to the church
[1:34:50] that's under the law of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:53] three thousand souls were saved on the
[1:34:57] day of Pentecost when the spiritual law
[1:34:58] was given up three hundred souls died
[1:35:01] when the natural law was being brought
[1:35:04] down from the mountain and Moses caught
[1:35:06] him worshiping a golden calf now there's
[1:35:10] a revelation in there calf represents a
[1:35:13] pastor because no man said a pastor as a
[1:35:15] ox that's interesting thought they
[1:35:19] exalted this golden calf interesting
[1:35:24] something in there just like there's
[1:35:28] something there's those two sevens the
[1:35:30] seven years of feasts the seven years of
[1:35:33] planning the seven years of famine
[1:35:34] I think that's Israel I think in their
[1:35:37] Old Testament church age God give them
[1:35:39] seven years or seven church age the
[1:35:41] great things but then when got when they
[1:35:43] rejected it now these seven Gentile year
[1:35:45] ages they've been having a famine
[1:35:47] because they're blinded to the gospel I
[1:35:50] could be wrong I'm just sharing that
[1:35:52] with you because first what do I know
[1:35:53] I've been praying for more revelation
[1:35:54] lately I know about you but I've been
[1:35:56] praying for more revelation because I
[1:35:58] want to know the things of God amen
[1:36:02] so 3,000 died when the natural laws
[1:36:05] coming down 3,000 were born again when
[1:36:07] the spiritual law came glory 3,000 prior
[1:36:11] spoken by Solomon 3,000
[1:36:16] Kota mail weighed 5000 shekels of brass
[1:36:19] 5000 men were fed by Jesus America
[1:36:22] besides women and children just met
[1:36:24] 5,000 was the number of believers in the
[1:36:26] early church after the gate of beautiful
[1:36:28] miracles went from 3,000 to 5,000 after
[1:36:31] one miracle
[1:36:32] nah-ha goodness five thousand men Joshua
[1:36:36] set to ambush I remember he started
[1:36:38] battle at the gates and they chased him
[1:36:40] he started running away like he's like
[1:36:42] he's a coward and then after all the
[1:36:45] soldiers got out he blew the horn and
[1:36:47] the five thousand went in there in
[1:36:49] ambush I say hey man would have met what
[1:36:52] a mighty strategic warrior ten thousand
[1:36:56] five unknown words are better than ten
[1:36:59] thousand unknown now you go to penny
[1:37:02] penny Pentecostal church today you're
[1:37:03] gonna hear ten thousand unknown words
[1:37:05] but the sermon where they heard a
[1:37:07] thousand is better than those ten
[1:37:09] thousand there's more than there's ten
[1:37:14] thousand groups of ten thousand the
[1:37:16] Bible said ten thousands upon thousands
[1:37:20] Christ returned with ten thousands of
[1:37:22] his Saints at Armageddon thousands so
[1:37:25] groups of ten thousands come with Jesus
[1:37:28] Christ when he comes back at Armageddon
[1:37:31] 10,000 11,000 Joe owns seven thousand
[1:37:35] sheep three hundred three thousand
[1:37:37] cattles five hundred ox and five hundred
[1:37:38] female donkeys eleven thousand twelve
[1:37:41] thousand Jews sealed in each of the
[1:37:42] twelve tribes forty-four thousand that's
[1:37:47] the Jew sealed a hundred million on top
[1:37:49] of thousands of thousands of angels
[1:37:51] around the heavenly throne and the Bible
[1:37:56] says a hundred million thousand thousand
[1:37:59] and then on top of the thousands of
[1:38:02] thousands of angels round about the
[1:38:04] throne oh man this is the loneliest
[1:38:06] place we're ever going to be hundred
[1:38:10] million angels amen pres thousands of
[1:38:13] thousands of more hallelujah and they're
[1:38:17] all men they're all male angels
[1:38:21] messengers glory I can't wait to go
[1:38:26] open thank him thank you for protecting
[1:38:27] me when I travel last night almost fell
[1:38:30] asleep thank you for the angels of God
[1:38:31] protected me I wonder forget a chance to
[1:38:34] thank them 200 million
[1:38:37] the number of horsemen under the sixth
[1:38:39] trumpet two hundred thousand thousand
[1:38:43] who kill a third of the men by fire
[1:38:46] smoke and brimstone now I showed a few
[1:38:50] months ago if you put the quotes of
[1:38:51] other band together I don't think these
[1:38:53] these demons are already loose that's
[1:38:56] just my personal opinion some people
[1:38:58] think they are but if you put all the
[1:38:59] quotes together Bram said these trumpets
[1:39:00] can't even blow until the sixth seal so
[1:39:05] I don't know I could be wrong but I'm
[1:39:07] just saying that's just my opinion
[1:39:08] I don't think those two hundred million
[1:39:09] million or those tur million are
[1:39:11] actually loose yet but they could be
[1:39:13] they could be all right let's close with
[1:39:17] this oh my god playing time huh praise
[1:39:21] the Lord amen let's look at this if you
[1:39:25] wanna come my statutes and keep my
[1:39:27] commands and do them and you chase your
[1:39:29] enemies I'm sorry you shall chase your
[1:39:31] enemies and they shall fall before you
[1:39:33] by the sword of the word now this is all
[1:39:37] natural I'm I just want to try to bring
[1:39:39] it to a spiritual there's so much power
[1:39:42] by the word that you and I speak and I
[1:39:47] said this earlier like I said last week
[1:39:49] you wouldn't have to be careful before
[1:39:51] we pronounce someone's healing but we
[1:39:53] don't have to be careful when we speak
[1:39:55] against sin in our lives because it is
[1:39:59] always God's will for you to live by
[1:40:01] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:40:02] mouth of God it's never against perfect
[1:40:04] will for you and I to compromise and Sid
[1:40:07] and enjoy the lust of the flesh raise
[1:40:11] God but you better be careful like
[1:40:13] before I pray for other Brian last night
[1:40:14] he's got that degenerate condition his
[1:40:16] hips I stopped them they're about ready
[1:40:18] bow their heads I said brothers hold on
[1:40:19] I said mother Brian is there anything
[1:40:20] you need to confess because I got a lot
[1:40:22] of respect for brother Graham's words
[1:40:24] you can cast a demon off someone but if
[1:40:26] they're not life's not right you'll get
[1:40:28] in trouble with God you don't come back
[1:40:29] on him and go Jim said oh thank you
[1:40:33] Brian said oh yes thank you too he said
[1:40:34] I believe that quote he said my life's
[1:40:36] right with God so I said praise the Lord
[1:40:38] I'm expecting God answer
[1:40:40] Lord willing I'm not saying thus saith
[1:40:42] the Lord I'm saying Lord willing but
[1:40:44] that's the kind of respect for God that
[1:40:46] we have to have how many want that kind
[1:40:48] of respect I want it
[1:40:51] see five of you will chase a hundred I'm
[1:40:56] how many 117 people in here that's been
[1:41:03] baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:05] glory now there's some over there too
[1:41:08] yeah 17 is a good number in here but we
[1:41:11] got some over there we can't leave them
[1:41:13] out there bride to the is Joshua 23 now
[1:41:22] this is when they're in the land that
[1:41:24] you come out among these nations these
[1:41:26] that remain among you neither make
[1:41:27] mention of the name of their gods nor
[1:41:29] calls to swear by them neither serve
[1:41:31] them nor bow yourselves unto them but
[1:41:33] Cleveland the Lord your God as you have
[1:41:35] done this day for the Lord I've driven
[1:41:37] out from before you great nations and
[1:41:39] strong but as for you know that's better
[1:41:41] able to stand before you unto this day
[1:41:44] Joshua is dying and this is what he's
[1:41:45] saying no man has similar for our church
[1:41:49] because we've stayed with the word amen
[1:41:53] praise God
[1:41:54] what enemy are you facing today maybe
[1:41:59] you're a sold piece and the enemy's not
[1:42:00] great but if we're in obedience if our
[1:42:02] church and if your life is right with
[1:42:05] God who can stand before us and we know
[1:42:09] where the Joshua anti-type or the he was
[1:42:13] the type where the anti-type the Joshua
[1:42:15] army the ones were born again that have
[1:42:18] crossed over in the promised land of the
[1:42:20] basses of the Holy Ghost we're supposed
[1:42:22] to be at a for that Amen or anti type of
[1:42:24] that one man of you shall chase a
[1:42:27] thousand so now the number goes up right
[1:42:32] Leviticus was you know this 505 500 now
[1:42:36] it's one of you will chase a thousand
[1:42:40] for the Lord your God he it is that
[1:42:42] fight it for you as he hath promised for
[1:42:45] you amen remember we said it last week
[1:42:47] there's times God fights for you and
[1:42:49] there's times that God wants you to
[1:42:50] fight a little bit
[1:42:53] right there's times gotta knock down
[1:42:56] every foe in front yeah well thank you
[1:42:57] lord thank you lord thank you look I was
[1:42:59] all prepared for this battle this fight
[1:43:01] and God just knocked it out now I think
[1:43:02] but there's times God wants you to pick
[1:43:04] up the sword too
[1:43:06] you want you to stand up for the word
[1:43:08] quote the word believe the word so let's
[1:43:13] look at the equate or the ratios here it
[1:43:16] was 20 times the amount right then it
[1:43:20] was a hundred times the amount and now
[1:43:22] Joshua says it's a thousand times from
[1:43:25] 2200 to a thousand times in other words
[1:43:30] the power gets greater glory your power
[1:43:37] if I'm trying to bring this down just is
[1:43:39] your power to speak against temptations
[1:43:42] in your daily life amen we all have to
[1:43:47] come to church defeated or discourage or
[1:43:49] colder than God we can come to church on
[1:43:51] fire because God promised if you if you
[1:43:56] live clean if you obey the Word of God
[1:43:57] he said when these enemies come against
[1:44:00] you you just take out your Amen and one
[1:44:03] sister Connie can go out you can drive
[1:44:05] out 1,000 even scriptural church that
[1:44:15] look once they got in the land
[1:44:17] Sampson actually achieved the highest
[1:44:19] amount remember he's a type of the bride
[1:44:21] the glory he's through a thousand a dino
[1:44:26] slew eight hundred at one time a buyer
[1:44:29] killed three hundred at one time to see
[1:44:33] all these promises God was with them at
[1:44:36] the right time in season God anointed
[1:44:40] those who were obeying the Word of God
[1:44:41] to drive out the enemies if they would
[1:44:45] just obey the Word of God and here's the
[1:44:50] best one of all Jesus I love this jesus
[1:44:54] got all the Holy Ghost and he gets in
[1:44:57] the promised land and he comes to a
[1:44:59] Legion and the lexicon says there was a
[1:45:02] Legion was six thousand
[1:45:05] under 226 men amen so there's almost
[1:45:09] seven there's old almost 7,000 demons
[1:45:12] and all he says is go talk about
[1:45:17] anything go just sometimes Neil realize
[1:45:21] the power of just saying Satan get
[1:45:24] behind me in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:29] now the kingdom is about ready it's
[1:45:31] switch it over to spiritual Kingdom
[1:45:33] right God doesn't want us to go out and
[1:45:35] drive out you know a hundred Muslims in
[1:45:38] our neighborhood although we'd like to
[1:45:41] in our flesh if they're if they're if
[1:45:45] they're worshipping demons right but
[1:45:49] listen for us they were switching over
[1:45:51] but Jesus is showing us the spiritual
[1:45:54] application for sickness for
[1:45:57] demon-possessed people but also for
[1:46:00] daily temptations amen
[1:46:03] so the highest amount recorded that I
[1:46:06] could find was you'll drive out a
[1:46:08] thousand more with just one but Jesus
[1:46:11] ups to Andy he said it's almost one
[1:46:13] drives out seven thousand and let me you
[1:46:19] know he could've drove out seven
[1:46:21] thousand praise God he could've drove
[1:46:23] out a hundred thousand because he was
[1:46:25] God amen yeah the anointing he was
[1:46:29] always working in pure obedience but God
[1:46:31] is trying to show us the power of using
[1:46:34] this sword of the word against your
[1:46:36] daily temptations we don't have to be
[1:46:40] discouraged we're not to feel lost we
[1:46:42] have to feel we don't feel sorry for
[1:46:43] ourselves we can drive all those
[1:46:46] feelings out in the name of Jesus
[1:46:49] because the Bible said if God be for us
[1:46:51] who can be against us you got seven
[1:46:56] thousand demons and one Jesus Christ
[1:46:57] how can seven thousand be a they're not
[1:47:01] hard for God if God for me these seven
[1:47:03] thousand are really not against me
[1:47:04] they're against God and God will give me
[1:47:08] victory over them that's why these young
[1:47:10] people don't have to be discouraged I've
[1:47:12] heard people say well we're not gonna
[1:47:13] have kids because they're to see us so
[1:47:15] hard what a shame it's like they don't
[1:47:17] even know what the
[1:47:18] Bible says they don't even know what the
[1:47:20] Bible says this is our land amen
[1:47:23] this is not a demon's land this is all
[1:47:25] an amen
[1:47:27] this land is God's land this is the
[1:47:30] promised land whether we are afraid of
[1:47:32] children today have access to more power
[1:47:35] because there's more on religion there's
[1:47:37] more there's more maturity the photo
[1:47:40] particles will be in this world and
[1:47:43] that's the saith the Lord according to
[1:47:45] your prophet amen
[1:47:46] there's most of me afraid of the thing
[1:47:49] to do is get obedient to the Word of God
[1:47:51] and believe the promises of God and
[1:47:54] drive out the enemies before you I don't
[1:47:58] know how people can sit still preaching
[1:47:59] like this where they men I don't know
[1:48:01] when we got the word and we see what
[1:48:04] Christ did what can we do with it
[1:48:07] I've cast out demons out I think seven
[1:48:09] or eight people eight people but shirts
[1:48:13] most people are not going to be like
[1:48:15] that most people are like that don't
[1:48:17] want to be delivered so you're not going
[1:48:18] to catch the devil out of them anyway
[1:48:20] the thing to do is get the devil out of
[1:48:22] your mind amen
[1:48:26] we've got to get the devil out of our
[1:48:28] thinking because the Bible said neither
[1:48:30] give place to the Ephesians 4:23 don't
[1:48:35] give a place to the devil in your mind
[1:48:40] I'm trying to close
[1:48:42] most beautiful chapters in the Bible we
[1:48:43] know that so here's my conclusion I stay
[1:48:45] on our feet here's my conclusion I
[1:48:48] didn't think I'd make it through but I
[1:48:50] made it through praise to the heart I've
[1:48:53] been wanting to finish this series here
[1:48:54] have you enjoyed it as we're closed and
[1:48:58] think of those thoughts on the numbers
[1:48:59] earlier about investing in our our
[1:49:02] calling in life that would seem to be
[1:49:05] really led of the Holy Spirit there if
[1:49:08] you hear the call from Christ seek first
[1:49:11] the kingdom of God you might not see
[1:49:14] your reward by the way I'm on this side
[1:49:16] but if you pray you dedicate your life
[1:49:19] to God do what Jesus said pray in the
[1:49:21] closet fast like Ana you give alms like
[1:49:25] corneas oh you know there's going to be
[1:49:27] a reward in heaven someday praise God
[1:49:33] now my conclusion I just thought these
[1:49:36] numbers just speak to the greatness of
[1:49:38] God brother Brad said God is known
[1:49:41] through his numbers in other words we
[1:49:44] get to know God more and better as we
[1:49:46] look at numbers in the scripture and
[1:49:48] here I'm just closing with this thought
[1:49:50] on the greatness of God God is so great
[1:49:52] the Bible said the steps of a good man
[1:49:53] are ordered by the Lord and he
[1:49:56] delighteth in his way God's got a
[1:49:58] certain order you walked through of your
[1:50:00] life and God delights in your way
[1:50:04] if you walk in his way now look Church
[1:50:08] God even blesses the foolish virgin if
[1:50:09] she'll walk at least a virgin life she
[1:50:13] never walked up to Pentecost but at
[1:50:16] least she didn't walk with the wicked
[1:50:17] praise God
[1:50:19] David said better is one day in your
[1:50:21] courts than a thousand attend to the
[1:50:23] wicked Jesus this is after white throne
[1:50:26] judgment Jesus even say call me blessed
[1:50:27] of my father inherit the kingdom
[1:50:30] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:50:32] the world
[1:50:33] remember they won't have leadership in
[1:50:36] the kingdom of God but they'll be a part
[1:50:37] of the kingdom the Bible said the
[1:50:39] foolish version will bring their glory
[1:50:41] and honor into the kingdom of God but
[1:50:47] because there
[1:50:48] again they don't have the degrees they
[1:50:50] don't have the fullness which can't make
[1:50:52] them earn rewards and it's not that
[1:50:53] we're trying to get rewards but listen
[1:50:54] Church we are trying to be faithful we
[1:50:57] are trying to do the will of the Father
[1:50:59] remember Jesus prayed that God pray that
[1:51:02] your godless and Labor's into his
[1:51:03] kingdom he wants us the labor amen glory
[1:51:06] he want so many that were labor and seek
[1:51:09] first the kingdom of God and that's the
[1:51:13] burden that we have keep laboring
[1:51:14] keep seeking God's kingdom first the
[1:51:16] Holy Ghost baptism the preaching of the
[1:51:18] word the message the hour put that first
[1:51:20] it's the Holy Ghost amen
[1:51:23] but God still blesses the foolish
[1:51:25] version for not dwelling in wicked
[1:51:27] places I'm not gonna read all this I
[1:51:32] kind of quote it earlier not one bird
[1:51:35] falls to the ground without your father
[1:51:37] we we've seen a couple of birds our cats
[1:51:39] been killing birds you know I thought of
[1:51:40] this Scripture I see the little bird
[1:51:42] bodies all around there God knows each
[1:51:44] one of those how much more does he know
[1:51:47] you and I but the very hairs of your
[1:51:52] head are numbered science says you have
[1:51:54] anywhere from ninety thousand to one
[1:51:57] hundred fifty thousand hairs and he's
[1:51:58] got each one of those numbered and each
[1:52:01] one you'll get back brothers or sisters
[1:52:04] usually its brothers 40% of men lose
[1:52:07] their hair each one you'll get back by
[1:52:11] God's grace doesn't this tell you the
[1:52:14] greatness of God's knowledge if he knows
[1:52:17] how many hairs
[1:52:17] each one has here there so nothing cast
[1:52:21] their young nor be barren in thy land
[1:52:23] the number of thy days will I fulfill
[1:52:25] see God will fulfill your numbers of
[1:52:27] days on this earth if you obey and keep
[1:52:31] God's word God let you fulfill he won't
[1:52:33] take you early right like he did some he
[1:52:37] won't let you stay late either he liked
[1:52:38] Hezekiah he won't take your early likes
[1:52:41] all right he'll let you fulfill but you
[1:52:45] got to obey God's Word so teach us how
[1:52:48] many 1 only 1 this teach us to number
[1:52:50] our days how many want wisdom to number
[1:52:51] your days I was saying that I'm almost
[1:52:54] 40 I'm almost there I'm past the half
[1:52:56] mark ii ii ii i'm i've just got i'm
[1:52:59] looking like this man i got half my life
[1:53:01] left to give it
[1:53:02] all to Jesus Christ I just got half left
[1:53:04] I've given him a portion of my first
[1:53:06] half I got saved at 19 from 19 to 35 I
[1:53:09] gave him all those years I got half left
[1:53:12] to do all I can for Jesus Christ to
[1:53:14] meditate on his word to fulfill these
[1:53:16] scriptures and to preach and to teach
[1:53:17] and do everything I can I got half my
[1:53:19] life he left to do it a little less in
[1:53:22] half and if my strength I get 80 praise
[1:53:24] the Lord we already looked at that one
[1:53:31] remember church the Lord will perfect
[1:53:34] that which concerns me that means
[1:53:36] finished perfect means to finish God
[1:53:38] will finish everything that's concerning
[1:53:40] your life if he knows that hairs your
[1:53:43] head
[1:53:43] he knows the steps your order David he
[1:53:46] knows everything about you he'll feel
[1:53:49] perfected and it's the last one
[1:53:52] musicians if you'll come let's go to
[1:53:55] sing god of wonders let's sing that
[1:53:57] because that's what it reminds me of the
[1:53:58] Bible said praise you the Lord for it is
[1:54:00] good to sing praising our God for it is
[1:54:02] pleasant and his praise is calmly the
[1:54:04] Lord doth build up Jerusalem he gathered
[1:54:06] together two outcasts of Israel he
[1:54:07] heareth the broken and how many would
[1:54:09] say at some point your life gods healed
[1:54:11] your broken heart amen and by 'no
[1:54:15] thought their wounds anyone ever been
[1:54:17] healed we should praise the lord for
[1:54:20] that he binds up our wounds he tells the
[1:54:25] number of the stars and he calls them by
[1:54:28] name each hairs got a number you could
[1:54:35] examine that hair right they find like
[1:54:36] DNA on that hair okay it's got a number
[1:54:39] it's got a code god's put a stamp on
[1:54:42] that one so does every star got a name
[1:54:46] stamped on every star and he's talking
[1:54:50] about how he heals your hearts he heals
[1:54:52] your wounds he knows every star he cares
[1:54:55] about every detail of our lives he has
[1:54:58] ordered your steps in the gospel of
[1:55:01] jesus christ the Milky Way galaxy has
[1:55:06] one hundred thousand million stars ten
[1:55:10] to the twelfth power just in our little
[1:55:12] galaxy and Church then there's man's
[1:55:14] upon million
[1:55:16] of galaxies NASA this is NASA's best
[1:55:18] guests I believe it was NASA the number
[1:55:20] of stars is 10 to the 24th power
[1:55:23] remember the Bible said God is
[1:55:25] stretching out the heavens it's always
[1:55:28] expanding so that I mean our little
[1:55:31] machines can you imagine our little
[1:55:33] machines in our little maybe maybe 10 to
[1:55:36] the 24th powers part like 10 to the 115
[1:55:39] million power but each one where the
[1:55:42] Amen has a name that God called Alston
[1:55:45] how much does God know your name - it's
[1:55:49] the greatness of God because the Bible
[1:55:50] said graters our Lord and of great power
[1:55:52] his understanding is infinite he
[1:55:55] understands what you're going through
[1:55:56] church he understands what you desire in
[1:56:00] your life he understands your name the
[1:56:03] hairs on your head the direction of your
[1:56:05] life he understands everything the thing
[1:56:08] we got to do is talk to him so he can
[1:56:09] help us understand our lives
[1:56:11] I say God give me your understanding I'm
[1:56:14] not gonna lean upon my own understanding
[1:56:17] I'm gonna seek the Lord because his
[1:56:20] understanding is infinite and Churchill
