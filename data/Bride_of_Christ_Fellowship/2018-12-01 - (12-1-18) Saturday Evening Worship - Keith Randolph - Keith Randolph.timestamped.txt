[46:33] giving no offense and anything that the

[46:40] approving ourselves as the ministers of
[46:42] God in must patience in afflictions and
[46:46] necessities in de-stresses in strives
[46:50] imprisonments in tumults and Labor's in
[46:53] watchings and fastening and pureness by
[46:55] knowledge by long-suffering by kindness
[46:58] by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned by
[47:01] the word of truth by the power of God by
[47:04] the armor of righteousness on the right
[47:05] hand on the left my honor and dishonor
[47:08] my evil report and good report as
[47:11] deceivers yet true as unknown and yet
[47:15] well known as dying behold we live as
[47:17] chastened and not killed as sorrowful
[47:21] yet always rejoicing as poor yet making
[47:25] many rich as having nothing yet
[47:29] possessing all
[47:31] you may be seated may God add his
[47:34] blessings to the reading of his word
[47:36] it's kind of been on my mind to preach
[47:39] this for a couple weeks I can just put a
[47:43] title to this and maybe this little
[47:46] group here we can get an understanding
[47:49] dwelling and Canaan land dwelling in
[47:53] Canaan land but first of all we see were
[47:56] Paul said beseech you you know the word
[47:59] beseech you what it means call you to
[48:02] one side to teach you you know I believe
[48:06] we've been called to one side in this
[48:09] age and been taught by a prophetic
[48:12] message God came forth and give us a
[48:16] message that taught us helped bring us
[48:20] out of darkness give us an understanding
[48:24] the right understanding and he's called
[48:28] us to one he summoned us Paul said I
[48:30] summon you I summon you to come together
[48:33] that I might teach you but the we saw it
[48:38] said but vain some are vain that means
[48:41] empty devoid of truth coming without the
[48:46] gift one who boast of faith yet without
[48:50] the fruits of faith you know James 2:26
[48:55] says for as the body without the Spirit
[49:00] is dead so faith without works is dead
[49:03] also
[49:05] James 2:22 says see us now has faith
[49:10] wrought with his works and by works was
[49:14] faith made perfect a man that means
[49:18] complete brought it to pass because of
[49:21] Abraham's faith he believed God and came
[49:25] that promise child just as he was no
[49:27] matter what came against him he still
[49:29] believed by faith that's why we're the
[49:32] children by faith of Abraham Abraham see
[49:35] you know Abraham had three sons Isaac
[49:44] Ishmael and Christ we are their
[49:47] spiritual children of Abraham we're not
[49:50] children of the bondwoman see there's a
[49:53] natural scene which is Israel and
[49:55] there's a spiritual sea which is the
[49:58] children of God a Gentile church called
[50:01] out of the world now then we see in 2nd
[50:05] green 6 7 with love unfeigned unfeigned
[50:09] without hypocrisy but yet possessing all
[50:15] things Paul could say that he was he was
[50:19] called everything you can think of
[50:22] everything he went through all this
[50:24] condemned the made him look like he was
[50:27] the wrong person but with all that he
[50:29] knew he was right now we're gonna see
[50:35] some things now some something made just
[50:37] to help you and encourage you now faith
[50:43] now we're talking about dwelling in
[50:46] Canaan land we're going to get to Canaan
[50:48] land in a little bit we realize what
[50:51] Canaan land is now faith must have the
[50:56] right atmosphere to bear its fruits the
[51:01] right atmosphere it's got to have the
[51:03] right we're little creators creating
[51:05] atmosphere every day we create an
[51:07] atmosphere we're creating an atmosphere
[51:11] that that's seed that you plant and the
[51:17] seed that you water the seed that you
[51:20] watch over might bring forth fly and
[51:23] they bring forth life in that right
[51:25] atmosphere now we know that you know I
[51:31] like what brother Ibrahim said in the
[51:33] hidden life he said notice now if
[51:35] refresh from the presence of Lord
[51:37] something about something about real
[51:39] Christians that you love to be around
[51:41] don't you do it and there's a power
[51:44] there after I get to know a little
[51:47] better I won't tell you some things that
[51:49] I know that's happened you create your
[51:52] own atmosphere around you believe that
[51:55] you create
[51:57] and atmosphere he begin to tell the
[51:59] story about the maniac in Portland
[52:01] Oregon you know he came after me you
[52:04] know that man did already not another
[52:06] guy somebody out he and he was coming
[52:09] into the service to attack the prophet
[52:11] of God you know you didn't know what he
[52:13] was going to do to him but he said you
[52:15] know what said I love the man I loved
[52:18] him he created an atmosphere no matter
[52:21] what I love the man and I remember you
[52:25] you will fall at my feet and I remember
[52:28] what the Prophet said he said they said
[52:30] is he delivered no he's not delivered
[52:34] just get him off my feet I know he is
[52:38] not delivered why because he loves that
[52:41] spirit but if you can create the right
[52:44] atmosphere maybe some of these will foot
[52:48] stop liking that spirit that turned
[52:51] whirling in because they see the spirit
[52:53] that is in you a man now you know we've
[53:04] had a token in this day you know when
[53:09] the children of Israel were n go in
[53:16] the death angel was coming through they
[53:21] were told to apply a token and the
[53:25] lentils and the doorpost brother Branham
[53:26] said it made a perfect cross pointing to
[53:31] the Messiah that was to come you know
[53:34] and that it if I see the blood I'll pass
[53:39] over and did everybody in I just love it
[53:47] when the head of the house was there
[53:49] standing everything you know had the raw
[53:55] herbs and all this and the children said
[54:00] daddy what's happening daddy are you
[54:04] sure we're are you sure world K and Paul
[54:08] book could say yes the
[54:10] it's on the door that's what I say papa
[54:13] is everything okay today am i all right
[54:15] it's checking up time and he said yes
[54:18] yes son I'm papa God and the blood is on
[54:22] the doorpost of your heart but that
[54:26] blood was the chemistry a blood of a
[54:30] bull and gold animals don't have a soul
[54:34] some people think they do they think
[54:37] that a little dog goes bow wow wow and
[54:39] he's the smartest little thing - and
[54:41] some of them are smart now but they
[54:43] ain't got no stow it's all by instinct I
[54:45] don't care what you say they ain't got
[54:47] no soul and that in that animal's life
[54:52] when they took the light when the blood
[54:54] was shed that was just the chemistry
[54:58] there was no soul in the worshiper when
[55:02] he would come and all for the sacrifice
[55:04] even when Aaron went into the holy place
[55:07] once a year to offer the sacrifice they
[55:11] were forgiven of their sins but they
[55:13] still had they couldn't get greater
[55:16] guilt and say probably next year they
[55:19] did the same thing in the next year they
[55:20] did the same they come and get over
[55:22] because why because that blood had no
[55:25] life but there was a blood sale that was
[55:29] broke at Calvary and it relief bill a
[55:32] resident released gone what was the
[55:35] blood sale in Jesus Christ it was gone
[55:38] without controversy great is the mystery
[55:41] of godliness God was manifest in the
[55:44] flesh justified in the spirit seen of
[55:46] angels and preached up in the glory hey
[55:49] man that's the Chokin life the token
[55:54] life you know the Chokin places of
[56:07] barriers for the man said it's a barrier
[56:10] and a Satan if you've got to how do you
[56:14] get to talk about the baptism of the
[56:15] Holy Ghost not speaking in tongues that
[56:19] might happen these are the things that
[56:22] the gifts of the Spirit
[56:24] but that's not the evidence it's
[56:25] receiving that word for your age and and
[56:30] it's it's God I lost my track of my
[56:35] fault there for a minute it's been a
[56:36] long day
[56:37] amen we're gonna get back to in a minute
[56:40] but see what happened that blood had no
[56:45] life but on the day of Pentecost that
[56:53] life came back and filled the believers
[56:57] but that token is a barrier brother
[56:59] branham sense a barrier in him Satan a
[57:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost now you're
[57:04] sealed to your day of redemption if the
[57:06] devil tries to put something on you it's
[57:08] a barrier tries to put sickness on you
[57:11] tries to put that on you you just say I
[57:14] don't want that I don't have to take
[57:17] that I don't want it when I let's tease
[57:22] I'm getting ready to celebrate my
[57:23] anniversary
[57:25] two of them in December December 30th is
[57:28] my wedding anniversary we'd be married
[57:29] 51 years and but December 12 is the day
[57:33] that I I think I died in the hospital
[57:36] room and that's my anniversary there but
[57:40] God give me another opportunity to stay
[57:43] on the firing line
[57:45] the stay on the firing line and I can't
[57:48] get away from bad I couldn't pray for
[57:55] myself my wife oh she could say key key
[58:02] key but the token knife was there he was
[58:05] not finished with me if he was I'd be
[58:08] gone it's a barrier it's a barrier it's
[58:16] also turn me to Psalms chapter 147 I'm
[58:26] just gonna preach as I feel led right
[58:28] now Psalm 147
[58:34] of this and verse 13
[58:41] the Bible says for he has strengthened
[58:44] the bars of thy gates he had blessed thy
[58:50] within thee he make it peace in thy
[58:54] borders say borders
[58:57] Holy Ghost puts up borders and filleth
[59:02] thee with the finest of the wheat a man
[59:06] we've got the finest of the wheat I
[59:08] found that in the Philippines they got
[59:12] about three or four different rice the
[59:19] best rice next rice next rice next right
[59:22] the other rice they've got a lot of
[59:23] holes or something in it but he give us
[59:26] the finest of the wheat he send it forth
[59:34] his commandment upon earth and his word
[59:37] run it very swiftly now we think we
[59:43] think well is he ever gonna answer my
[59:45] prayer and once you know the Bible says
[59:47] his word running amen amen amen his word
[59:53] run it very sweet the borders what is it
[59:55] a border it's a territory you know you
[59:59] may think I'm a little bit crazy but I
[1:00:02] am glad that I was raised in a Southern
[1:00:09] Baptist home I had a strict father and
[1:00:16] mother but my daddy was strict
[1:00:19] I mean we didn't there was no car
[1:00:22] planned nothing like that no dancing if
[1:00:26] I was in school and they they were had
[1:00:29] square dancing in school if they found
[1:00:31] out that you tried to make me do square
[1:00:33] dancing
[1:00:34] they'd have this guy with a flat top six
[1:00:36] foot two weight 220 pounds he'd been
[1:00:39] there right away
[1:00:39] his face right in their face it's right
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:45] I'm Anna I I had friends of smoked and
[1:00:49] and my daddy ever said you know he's
[1:00:52] slow he's smoked eyes I was raised
[1:00:55] Southern Baptist Church with a deacon
[1:00:57] smoked but my daddy hated smoking he
[1:01:01] quit smoking there world war two and you
[1:01:04] know that's another thing you know one
[1:01:05] reason why I love the Philippines so
[1:01:07] much my daddy
[1:01:10] during World War Two was in France and
[1:01:16] when it ended there they sent him to the
[1:01:19] Philippines I've got pictures him riding
[1:01:25] a care about with him little old brown
[1:01:28] skin kids he was an old farm boy and I
[1:01:32] figured he must have loved the
[1:01:34] Philippines and I was in in law I was in
[1:01:38] my father's lon I can't help from loving
[1:01:41] the Philippines that's right I'm not
[1:01:46] gonna take too much time I got time Dona
[1:01:48] listen listen you don't think it's
[1:01:51] important what you teach your children
[1:01:55] I've told this story I'm you may have
[1:01:58] heard this story before but I kind of
[1:02:00] loosens me up a little bit I was
[1:02:03] probably about 15 years old something
[1:02:06] like that and my friends were smoking
[1:02:08] cigarettes you know and and I thought I
[1:02:11] was a big guy and so my house
[1:02:15] my house was right here and a road went
[1:02:20] thattaway and a road went thattaway and
[1:02:23] I would walk down the road and go to the
[1:02:27] left and light me up one and I start
[1:02:32] coughing and hacking like crazy and I
[1:02:36] thought man I'm getting ready what ready
[1:02:40] I'm getting away with murder everybody
[1:02:43] know what a complex is or a trauma
[1:02:48] somebody gets head with the trauma and
[1:02:51] they can't remember what happened well I
[1:02:55] woke up one Sunday morning
[1:02:59] at the Randolph home if you didn't get
[1:03:02] up to go to church you got cold water
[1:03:04] poured on your face I think that morning
[1:03:07] I probably had cold water poured on my
[1:03:09] face and I got up at the bed and and I
[1:03:12] got my shirt hanging on the post of the
[1:03:15] bed and put my shirt and pants on and
[1:03:17] went out I could still remember my
[1:03:19] sister standing there and my dad
[1:03:22] standing there and I dropped something
[1:03:26] on the floor and I bent over I forgot I
[1:03:29] had a couple cigarettes in my pocket and
[1:03:31] those cigarettes fell out right in front
[1:03:33] of my dad God have mercy I don't
[1:03:37] remember a thing that happened after
[1:03:38] that that's the truth
[1:03:41] I don't remember and I'm glad I don't
[1:03:44] remember it was such a trauma because I
[1:03:47] I might have been 15 or 16 but I got
[1:03:50] that old nasty old leather belt again
[1:03:52] like I got many times like brother
[1:03:55] Brennan said I thank God for the old
[1:03:57] wood shed and I thank God for the old
[1:04:00] nasty leather belt that would be laying
[1:04:03] on the dining room table and every
[1:04:06] Sunday morning that old belt would be
[1:04:07] and the tithing envelope would be there
[1:04:10] did you know when I was a little boy and
[1:04:12] had a paper route I paid tithes off my
[1:04:14] paper route money and all the boys
[1:04:17] couldn't understand why I always be up
[1:04:19] on the corner market triple-t drinking
[1:04:22] coca-cola and eating candy bars all the
[1:04:24] time
[1:04:24] cause god bless me but if you strengthen
[1:04:30] the bars and the finest sweet is within
[1:04:33] those borders there's nothing impossible
[1:04:36] with God and there's nothing impossible
[1:04:38] with God there's nothing impossible with
[1:04:40] you hey man sets up boundaries Paul said
[1:04:50] I go bound in the spirit in Jerusalem
[1:04:54] not knowing the things that shall befall
[1:04:58] me there he said be not thou therefore
[1:05:03] ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor
[1:05:07] of his prisoner that's why I'm a
[1:05:10] prisoner of love
[1:05:13] a slave to the master I willingly toil
[1:05:19] through the heat and the cold I seek no
[1:05:23] reward in this world below but a pay day
[1:05:28] will come when the pearly gates I'm a
[1:05:33] prisoner of Jesus Christ and if
[1:05:36] sometimes we do things that we don't
[1:05:39] even can't help ourselves we have to
[1:05:41] because we go bound bound by the Spirit
[1:05:45] of the Living God
[1:05:53] the token message Israel coming out of
[1:05:58] Egypt was a type of the anti-type today
[1:06:03] Egypt were the church and Israel
[1:06:05] represented the bride and is Israel come
[1:06:09] out of Egypt so does the bride comes out
[1:06:13] of the church because there has to be
[1:06:16] something there for it to come out of
[1:06:18] and has got to come out of it so it was
[1:06:23] a type the church is in Egypt in the
[1:06:27] world in sin and does not tear a tinker
[1:06:32] about your token they don't believe it
[1:06:36] but Israel loved it for it was salvation
[1:06:41] to them it was salvation see say I
[1:06:48] believe this I go believe I believe the
[1:06:50] messy that's alright that's good but you
[1:06:53] must have the token
[1:06:56] do you hear Branham Tabernacle you must
[1:06:59] have the token displayed without it all
[1:07:02] you're believing is in vain you live a
[1:07:07] good life you listen to what the word
[1:07:09] says you go to church and try to live
[1:07:11] right that's fine but that's not it
[1:07:16] multitudes go to church you have family
[1:07:19] that goes to church but that's not it
[1:07:21] it's the token line it's the seal of God
[1:07:25] Green
[1:07:26] not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you
[1:07:29] are sealed sealed to the day of
[1:07:33] redemption hey man now death
[1:07:45] I don't believe could enter into the
[1:07:48] borders of your token I know natural
[1:07:52] death but not a spiritual death yes yes
[1:08:03] then enter there when we have a need we
[1:08:12] go to him we apply our token because in
[1:08:18] him is no death no worry no sin no
[1:08:23] sickness and if Satan tries to put
[1:08:26] something on you just take your token
[1:08:29] and apply it that you're a purchased
[1:08:32] product of Jesus Christ the token stands
[1:08:36] that you for you speaks for you fight
[1:08:39] your battles and wins the victory stand
[1:08:42] still and no tariffs you ever read the
[1:08:45] Old Testament the battles that was fault
[1:08:50] God fought their battles Uslan the
[1:08:54] enemy's army was so confused they
[1:08:59] discontinued it battle after battle
[1:09:02] stand still and know that I am God he's
[1:09:08] God is and nothing's impossible
[1:09:12] nothing's impossible now I think it's
[1:09:28] come to a time I just share this we go
[1:09:33] bound in the spirit some people they
[1:09:38] think
[1:09:39] I keep going back to the Philippines and
[1:09:41] I say you know a lot of people go to the
[1:09:43] Philippines I mean in America they go
[1:09:46] you can go on Facebook big meetings in
[1:09:50] Manila they're there but I thank God
[1:09:54] that there was a brother came Danny del
[1:09:58] mundo

[1:10:32] to places far places why bound in the
[1:10:40] spirit bound in the spirit

[1:10:47] heard the singing we've not yet entered
[1:10:50] into that word form body theophany body
[1:10:55] but we came here we bypassed our
[1:10:59] theophany we came here to be tested with
[1:11:03] the word to see what we would do with
[1:11:05] the word you know yes but when you get
[1:11:11] my age you even get more looking forward
[1:11:15] to that's theophany body
[1:11:17] young people here maybe cannot quite
[1:11:20] comprehend that amen no more bad knees
[1:11:25] you know no more off right it's in the
[1:11:29] feet you pray for the brother that came
[1:11:32] brother Frank Ward came over the last
[1:11:33] time he's got arthritis as a knees and
[1:11:35] he's having trouble walking I just
[1:11:37] talked to him by messenger but that's
[1:11:42] what happens when you get older so you
[1:11:44] got something look forward to one day
[1:11:47] one day I want you to know I heard from
[1:11:53] a theophany that's right Amen I believe
[1:11:58] when I received the Holy Ghost I heard
[1:11:59] from my feet often II and he said he
[1:12:04] said Keith you know I thought to myself
[1:12:09] when that happened to me in the hospital
[1:12:12] room I told my wife I was standing next
[1:12:16] to her not in the bed I thought I wished
[1:12:21] I had a mirror cut off so I could have
[1:12:23] seen what I look like my my MA whew what
[1:12:34] a glorious thing to look forward to but
[1:12:39] we came here to see what we would do
[1:12:42] with the world would we believe the word
[1:12:45] for this hour where we submit ourselves
[1:12:48] to every word of God we commit our life
[1:12:51] to Jesus Christ without reservation
[1:12:54] believing the whole word of God you must
[1:12:57] believe the whole Word of God I just had
[1:13:02] a I had a brother
[1:13:05] Rodell Mendel ndon I always called him
[1:13:10] my adopted son he actually would have
[1:13:16] been 54 the 23rd of December very very
[1:13:26] close I remember when I first met him
[1:13:32] summer camp 1994 was on top of the
[1:13:40] mountain gold Creek which is an
[1:13:41] abandoned gold quarry use run by
[1:13:44] Americans and you go you go up this
[1:13:48] abandoned gold quarry I remember the
[1:13:50] first time I ever went there and I said
[1:13:55] where's the church he's up on top of
[1:13:58] that mountain
[1:13:59] ain't no Road you've got to walk up the
[1:14:02] top of that mountain and I remembered I
[1:14:05] was a lot younger then
[1:14:07] but my traveling companion brother
[1:14:09] dinner took me up the wrong path and I
[1:14:13] remember when I got to the top I was
[1:14:17] crawling on all fours and I looked up
[1:14:20] and there was this guy with this big
[1:14:23] grin on his face it was brother Rodale
[1:14:26] I'll always remember that but he just
[1:14:29] died December about a week ago last
[1:14:34] Friday had a heart attack and stroke and
[1:14:38] in comatose it's just a shock healthy I
[1:14:42] thought but I thought no more pain for
[1:14:49] him he's an it's the off anybody he's
[1:14:52] there he's there with the Saints even
[1:14:55] fellowship with my brother branham I'm
[1:14:57] sure the Saints of old but he's got a
[1:15:01] wife he didn't get married to his about
[1:15:03] 42 years old he's got a wife and five
[1:15:06] little kids left behind I said my what
[1:15:09] does this happen why does it happen
[1:15:12] but it happened but we got a reunion
[1:15:16] coming someday but you must have the
[1:15:19] token you must have the token now Israel
[1:15:32] slain lamb was a token but there was no
[1:15:36] life in that blood but when that blood
[1:15:41] cell was broke at Calvary oh my I said
[1:15:44] it before most sating in when it was
[1:15:46] broken Calvary it released God and it
[1:15:51] came back jesus said I am he that liveth
[1:15:54] and was dead and behold I am Alive for
[1:15:57] evermore he went down into hail his trip
[1:16:02] Satan of the keys of death and hail
[1:16:04] threat to his side and said I am he that
[1:16:08] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:16:12] Alive for evermore victorious for a
[1:16:15] death hell and the grave
[1:16:20] in that blood shall never lose its power
[1:16:25] it shall never lose its power because in
[1:16:30] that blood was the life of God my thank
[1:16:34] God that I've received that life justify
[1:16:38] repentance being sanctified that's good
[1:16:41] but receiving the life of God through
[1:16:44] the baptismal not not not necessarily
[1:16:46] the way the Pentecostal they were right
[1:16:48] in their age the Baptist's were right in
[1:16:51] their age the Lutheran's were right in
[1:16:54] their age the Westlands were right in
[1:16:56] their age but we went further where did
[1:17:00] we went further we are now in the right
[1:17:02] age turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 31
[1:17:17] in verse 16 I love this thus saith the
[1:17:28] Lord I love that reframe thy voice from
[1:17:31] weeping and thine eyes from tears for
[1:17:36] thy works shall be rewarded saith the
[1:17:39] Lord and they shall come again from the
[1:17:43] land of the enemy and there is hope in
[1:17:48] thine end saith the Lord that thy
[1:17:53] children shall come again to their own
[1:17:56] border amen amen amen they if you train
[1:18:03] up a child in a way you should go when
[1:18:04] he old will not depart from it see
[1:18:07] brother Branham said Canaan questions
[1:18:11] and answers in 1959 Canaan is not the
[1:18:14] type of the millennium because they had
[1:18:17] Wars
[1:18:17] Fighting's killings and everything else
[1:18:19] in Canaan type the Canaan is a type of
[1:18:23] the Holy Ghost
[1:18:24] Egypt is a type of the world that take
[1:18:27] em out of the wilderness is where they
[1:18:29] were sanctified see they had no rights
[1:18:32] and Canaan
[1:18:34] they had no rights while they were
[1:18:36] justified they had no rights well they
[1:18:39] were sanctified a called out Church Cain
[1:18:45] is is where they settled down with the
[1:18:47] Holy Spirit because they still had wars
[1:18:50] and if you don't believe you have wars
[1:18:52] just get the holy spirit once hey man
[1:19:01] what are you doing what did they do in
[1:19:05] Canaan were possessing their rights
[1:19:10] glory
[1:19:12] they were possessing their rights and
[1:19:15] they could not possess the rights till
[1:19:19] they got into Canaan they didn't own
[1:19:22] nothing in the wilderness when they come
[1:19:25] into Canaan then they had rights and
[1:19:27] we've got rights when you receive the
[1:19:30] Holy Ghost you're in Canaan but you have
[1:19:33] to fight for every inch of ground you
[1:19:37] have to fight for it that's the reason
[1:19:44] people say brother Branham you pray for
[1:19:46] me today get over into Canaan once
[1:19:48] brother and you realize you belong see
[1:19:54] just tell that's what you know I always
[1:19:58] like I was like I don't know I think
[1:20:03] I'll repeat it sometimes my wife says
[1:20:05] you tell stories over and over and over
[1:20:07] because I can't remember from one
[1:20:08] service to the next what I told the last
[1:20:10] service
[1:20:11] well the random did the same thing so
[1:20:14] I'm in good company you know yes so you
[1:20:20] know it's like Luther I know
[1:20:32] I believe Luther had the Holy Ghost yes
[1:20:36] under justification because he the hath
[1:20:41] not the Spirit of Christ that's none of
[1:20:42] his and loser I had trouble sleeping and
[1:20:48] sometimes I still do sometimes I get up
[1:20:51] at 1:30 2:30 because of my aching feet
[1:20:57] and legs I don't get up because I want
[1:21:01] to get it but you know Luther was a
[1:21:08] German monk of course German monk stand
[1:21:13] didn't have wives and he started to
[1:21:18] after he came out under the work of
[1:21:21] justification he came out and had like a
[1:21:25] he was uniting priests and nuns together
[1:21:29] because the nuns were coming out and the
[1:21:32] priest was coming out he was having you
[1:21:34] might say Facebook young people getting
[1:21:41] together and that's right that's what
[1:21:44] happened
[1:21:45] and finally anybody thought Luther you
[1:21:50] gonna get married so he met this ex nun
[1:21:54] named Katie Katie and he tried to get
[1:22:01] her married off and Katie said I'll
[1:22:06] either marry you or this other brother
[1:22:11] so they got married but you know what he
[1:22:15] said the devil sleeps closer in bed to
[1:22:21] me than my wife Katie and the devil
[1:22:28] gives me more torment than my wife gives
[1:22:30] me joy that's right you know there's a
[1:22:34] in Wittenberg there is a Inkspot still
[1:22:39] on the ceiling where Luther was studying
[1:22:42] had a temper
[1:22:44] like a buzz saw and I said that Inkspot
[1:22:50] up there it's what he was studying and
[1:22:53] he said the Devils are up in the attic
[1:22:58] eating hazelnuts and he got mad and
[1:23:01] threw that inkwell up there they've
[1:23:03] they've kept that spot far as I know
[1:23:06] it's still there but he said Luther said
[1:23:09] I found a secret my daughter gave me the
[1:23:15] book when I read about quite a book
[1:23:17] quite a few books on Luther and she she
[1:23:20] got she got this book for me I think
[1:23:22] maybe a garage sale
[1:23:23] he said I found a secret yes the devil
[1:23:31] is an exalted creature
[1:23:32] I just turned and looked to the devil
[1:23:36] until the devil devil you're gonna be in
[1:23:41] the lake of fire and you will cease to
[1:23:43] exist
[1:23:45] and he would tell him that because he
[1:23:49] said he's an exalted creature and he
[1:23:51] said the devil would leave resist the
[1:23:53] devil and he shall flee amen that's what
[1:23:56] we still gotta do I found you know what
[1:23:59] I found out it works I mean he just and
[1:24:02] sometimes I forget all about it
[1:24:04] and have to remind myself these little
[1:24:08] secrets from the church age messengers
[1:24:11] from the past I'd rather read about them
[1:24:16] and all these newfangled preachers of
[1:24:19] the day with their charismatic moves and
[1:24:22] all this they're coming
[1:24:38] when we presented token with our prayers
[1:24:45] it shows that you have come to obedience
[1:24:51] to the whole Word of God it shows that
[1:24:54] you obey every word and you and the word
[1:24:59] are one
[1:25:04] well the Brennan said he only recognizes
[1:25:07] the token that is the message of the
[1:25:11] hour that is the message of the day this
[1:25:15] is the message he only recognizes the
[1:25:20] token when I see the token I'll pass
[1:25:26] over you a man hey man I'm trying to
[1:25:35] remember the scripture oh my it was
[1:25:40] morning I'd probably have a better
[1:25:41] memory amen
[1:25:43] I am the resurrection and the life he
[1:25:51] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:25:58] yet shall he live and he that liveth and
[1:26:03] believeth in me shall never die
[1:26:07] Saints don't die they just changed the
[1:26:12] rest hands amen
[1:26:15] so really we should never feel sorry for
[1:26:17] a saint that goes on because they've
[1:26:20] just changed their resonance they're
[1:26:23] resting who resting in a theophany body
[1:26:26] when brother Branham went into that
[1:26:28] other dimension and saw the Saints there
[1:26:31] my can you imagine one that old sister
[1:26:36] that but no no more hug beam and don't
[1:26:41] you know me
[1:26:42] Sharon Rose hug him don't you know me
[1:26:44] and that old sister I think I forget how
[1:26:47] old she was when brother Branham led her
[1:26:49] to the Lord
[1:26:49] so one what merchants she was so
[1:26:53] faithful a man let's see that's you
[1:26:58] we've got it I'm gonna close I think
[1:27:01] we've got to get recognized something in
[1:27:05] our brains I was preaching in a church
[1:27:09] and the message in Indiana and I won't
[1:27:12] tell you where years ago
[1:27:14] and I had an altar service and the
[1:27:17] pastor got up and praying for me praying
[1:27:20] not praying for me but pray for the
[1:27:21] people and you know what he said if
[1:27:22] brother Branham was only here I'm here
[1:27:27] you're here and the bride of Jesus
[1:27:30] Christ that message was for you and me I
[1:27:36] don't believe in a return ministry I
[1:27:38] believe in the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ and I believe it is a bride
[1:27:43] that's going to use that third pole in
[1:27:46] this hour gonna be a lot of surprises
[1:27:52] and I don't get that's another message
