clapping their hands and singing and it was just a a congregational worship and the caption was this is how church used to be everybody was singing nowadays it's just maybe a a choir or praise team or whatever you know and that people in the audience just watching but we come to worship amen we come to praise His name Hallelujah I like to say I I get this from Brother Brooks don't provoke me to worship cuz I will worship Him amen Lord you know we thank God Amen it's always a pleasure being here you know uh uh brother Jesse inspires me just as much as I Inspire him him and his family you know all you guys inspire me so much so it's not with me it's not a small church or or a big church you're just the people of God you know so I love fellowshipping among the people of God and and you guys have been such a blessing to me so I I I thank God for all of you and what God is doing in this area you know and can't wait to spend eternity with you Hallelujah but just know there all of us will be the same I won't be doing any preaching amen we'll all be sitting at his feet enjoying him amen so amen I'll be just like you guys sitting out there worshiping Hallelujah praising him amen amen so we thank god let's just have a word of prayer and um we'll get into the word of God tonight you have an unspoken request you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand amen Lord Jesus father we love you tonight Lord and we're just so grateful Lord to know that we're in the land of the living Lord and there's nothing that we've done but it's all your choosing Lord Lord you you chose us when it looked like there was nothing good in US Lord but you knew before the foundation of the world what we would be Lord through all our mistakes through all our ups and downs none of that could stop that seed from being drawn closer to the light so Lord we just appreciate Lord that you're in control of our lives Lord and Lord we heard all the many requests Lord physical and natural Lord we just pray that you just touch that need tonight Lord and just continue to bless this church Lord and let the words of inspiration touch every need tonight Lord help us to move out of the way and let the gift of God be led by the Holy Spirit tonight in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen amen amen hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's turn to um Galatians the 4th chapter Galatians chapter 4 uh and then we're going to we're going to kind of backtrack we going to go back to Romans 8 Galatians 4 and verse one Galatians 4 and verse one the Bible says Galatians 4 And1 The Bible says now I say that the there as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons amen amen let's go to um Romans chapter 8 familiar verse of scriptures Romans 8 let's start reading at um verse 14 Romans 8 8 and 14 the Bible says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then hes HS of God and Joint hes with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen may the lord to bless the reading of his word you can have your seats amen praise the Lord God is so good amen amen and we thank him for all that he's done and all that he's doing for in everything that God does there's a purpose behind it amen and we know that the Lord is always willing Hallelujah to show himself Mighty and strong in our lives so you know um tonight by the by the grace of God I want to use for subject spiritual placement spiritual placement amen and and you know I just I just want to quote this verse right here something that we all uh uh pretty much is is like a staple in what we call the message as far as scripture is concerned uh Revelations 18 and4 the Bible says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues now that's that's that's that's one scripture that you know we as Believers We Know by heart but you know uh if you look at that scripture what God was saying is you're out of place you know as the believer they were in the wrong spot you know they were worshiping under the wrong Doctrine under the wrong leadership under the under the wrong guidance and God says come out of her my people and as the word be to be preached that word word begin to place that believer in the right place but you know placement is everything and you know as we as we look right here uh in the word of God you know it it talks about a a child and you know in Galatians 4 and and it says that you know that child differs no no nothing than a servant you know until it is it grows up until it gets to the place to where it can take over all the responsibilities that the father has amen but you know in order for that child to get there it has to be taught it has to be HHH trained it has to be weaned off certain things so all the whole time that child is there with with Governors and the teachers the whole thing is working on is his placement amen and you know I believe that what God has been doing this whole time with us the message I even have the quote for it said that this what this message of the hour has been doing is been placing us hallelujah according to God's position Hallelujah but you know placement is everything Hallelujah if I could make it you know I like to use natural types if if if if I could make it real plain and simple you know just think about this placement and we know when something is off just say for instance we came to church tonight and we had all the churches we had all the chairs right here and but we Tu the pull pit and we put it back there in the back and we kept the seats looking forward we' all walk in here and we'll say something's out of place we walk in here and we say why is the pull pit back there and or or we say why don't we turn the seats around because something is out of place and and a lot of times we as Believers we get out of place Hallelujah that doesn't mean we're not in the right place but our position may be out of order Hallelujah and you know you just think about it Hallelujah we want to fix that and put it in the right place amen we' want to either turn the seats around so we could see the preacher preaching or we'd want to put the pull pit back up here in the right place amen so placement is everything to God hallelujah that's why he didn't put Hallelujah brother brandham in Noah's day because God had already put a a preacher there Hallelujah with the right placement of word hallelujah and his word was going to place the people exactly where they needed to be Hallelujah so church for us to be here in this generation and in this time we ought to be thankful Hallelujah because God has spiritually placed Us in this day why cuz we can fulfill Hallelujah the thoughts of God for the end time amen but you know placement placement is everything Hallelujah if you look at a natural body just think about it Hallelujah why are my eyes in the front of my forehead why not on the side because the way I walk I walk straight and forward Hallelujah if my eyes were here I would walk like this and the body's not meant to walk sideways it's meant to walk like this Hallelujah so my eyes are put here for a reason Hallelujah they're there because that's the proper placement for me to get where I need to be Hallelujah and I want you to understand if God call you to to this church it's the proper placement for you to get where you need to be hallelujah amen that's why even when you're going through trials and things are happening you have to say as a Believer nothing's out of place Hallelujah because God knows exactly what he need to do to get the person or the body to the next place Hallelujah and you know if if if if we continue with placement and placement of the body hallelujah what if my mouth was on the side of my neck that'll be out of place cuz I'd be eating like this that that looks crazy doesn't it Hallelujah see sir so when we think about hallelujah how I love this word how strategic God is God is very strategic Hallelujah H the simplest things God puts his hand on he says that's exactly where I want it Hallelujah that's exactly what I want to happen Hallelujah Church even when we look like we're struggling or we're going through things we're praying about we like Lord help me God is strategic he knows exactly what that child is going to do for you in your life hallelujah hallelujah amen God Is So Hallelujah strategic when it comes to placement Hallelujah God let uh he let 10 Brothers get angry with one why because that anger was going to place him oh go Hallelujah that anger was going to place him in a pit Hallelujah because that pit was going to place him oh oh my that pit was going to put him right in the place to where Hallelujah the Caravan could come down and snatch him up and then they were going to take him Hallelujah right up to Egypt Hallelujah right up to where they needed to be Hallelujah and then he was going to get it placed into jaus house placed in the jail house then placed in the throne Hallelujah but it but it looked like all of it was a trial no it was God spiritually placing him in the right place [Applause] Hallelujah sometimes the things that look completely out of order is God working on your position placing and position work together Joseph would have never got to his position if he didn't get to his placement amen but it took hallelujah amen something going against the grain to get him in that place Hallelujah but what was it it was the father making sure that that child could become heir of all Hallelujah listen let's read it again the Bible says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors what kind of tutor the pit what kind of tutor hatred from his brothers what kind of tutor lying from Piper's wife my all these things Hallelujah was positionally placing him to the throne of God oh my he says tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father and you look church I love the I love the life I love the life of of of of of of Joseph hallelujah it's two guys when I get to heaven we going to chop it up Hallelujah that's old South Carolina slang chop it up mean to talk about you know you chopping something up you working with something so we just going to chop it up we're going to sit down we going to chop it up for a million years H but you know I'm going go to Joseph and I'm begin to talk to Joseph Joseph what was it like Hallelujah being in that pit and you knew that it was your brothers who put you there see church sometimes we have to overcome ourselves because it'll be God doing something in your life that you don't understand but God is positionally placing you Hallelujah to a place where you can not only just be a servant but now you can be heir of all Hallelujah by the time God was through with Joseph Hallelujah Joseph was running the whole Kingdom amen but he had to overcome his own thoughts he had to overcome his own bitterness he had to overcome Hallelujah his own complexes Hallelujah to get to his placement Hallelujah and sometimes we have to overcome our own selves Hall the problem is not Hallelujah the person that lied on you the problem is how you're taking that lie right amen because you can react Hallelujah and react wrong and then it's no longer their problem it's your problem Hallelujah so Church a lot of times things happen because God is trying to mature us amen but if you look you look you look at placement placement is everything you think about our lives everything we do deals with placement Hallelujah you don't jump on the passenger side if you going to drive there's no steering wheel there unless you in Europe Hallelujah unless you're in Paris somewhere or or or or in Africa Hallelujah there's no steering wheel on this side of the car all you you're here to be driven Hallelujah not to drive because of the way things are placed but the worst thing you can be is a person over here want to control everything right that's right my God may not have put you in a situation to drive he put you in his in a situation to be driven right Hallelujah so a lot of times we may go through something because it's that thing that's going to drive you hallelujah it's that thing that's going to wake you up it's that thing that's going to give you strength to say God I will come back another day Hallelujah but as long as you are driving you don't feel like you need any help so sometimes God want you to be on the passenger side so you can feel what it's like to be driven amen that's good hallelujah oh Church being driven Hallelujah is a good thing Hallelujah but the worst kind of person you can be is a person who always want to be in control good and when you're not in control you're trying to tell the person that's driving how to drive right yes sir yes sir normally that's a person who's in insecure with the person who's driving yes sir and we all supposed to be children of God Amen we're all supposed to be led by God we're all supposed to be saying God is in control of my life Hallelujah so why are we in so insecure about what you're going through right good brother good if God is in control just strap your seat belt in even if it look like an accident that seat belt is there to keep you tight hallelujah hallelujah you have to trust that you are in the right vehicle you have to trust that the vehicle has been battle tested Hallelujah this gospel has been battle tested this Revelation has been battle tested your pastor has been battle tested and you have to believe it's all right to sit over here with no control and just be driven hallelujah hallelujah there's too many people that want to drive when you need to be driven sit back and relax and just depend on the vehicle Hallelujah because nowadays Hallelujah these vehicles are so equipped they got buzzers and beats for everything it's kind of sickening see I'm kind of old school you know I I'm going to take y'all way back y'all young people ain't never seen a car where you pull the gas plate down and you put gas in from the back yeah we old enough h but some of you young ones ain't never seen that you only seen the placement from the side when you get there you or you get on this side but there was a day Hallelujah where you had to stand at the very back to get what you need Hallelujah and you know sometimes you may feel like you're alone you may feel like Hallelujah nobody's understanding you you may feel like you're in the very back but it was made that way hallelujah hallelujah it was made that way for the benefit of the car because the tank was so heavy it had to be in the back of the car Hallelujah but nowadays they have things so lightweight and so constructed they can put the gas tank anywhere hallelujah hallelujah but as we see times change Hallelujah placement look different but God doesn't change hallelujah amen God deals with situations different but what he's trying to do he's trying to get all of us to a place to where we can take over his spot Hallelujah that's what placement is all about I know it's a hook yeah you know you you you if I can use a natural example for a second everybody all right if you take a team hallelujah what good is a quarterback if he's trying to be Hallelujah a linebacker right he's out of place right he have all the dreams he want about being able to run somebody down and Tackle them he not built for that right he don't have the stamina for that right Hallelujah he never studied to be that so you know what he do he'd fail in that position Hallelujah but if he get in the right position he can take the team to to to to to to to a winning spot Hallelujah he he can take the team to another level in his position but once he get out of position the whole team is subject to failure and it's just the same way in the body of Christ all of us oh let me read you something right quick hallelujah oh my Hallelujah listen what the prophet of God says hallelujah now what I'm talking about is us as Believers in our position hallelujah our spiritual positions according to the direct leadership of God hallelujah not somebody telling you what they think you ought to be right or where they think you are to be place but I'm talking about under the direct leadership of God hallelujah hallelujah you know I've had people ask me you know that that was at my church and maybe saw me years later and they be like uh uh I say years later maybe like five six years later and they be like uh where you where you go to church at now I say I'm I still go to Jesus Christ Tabernacle Anderson I said yeah I'm still with Anderson and they like are you really I'm like yeah it's like wow and I you know I I I filter that sometimes because people think because they left you have to leave or they think because they went through something that caused them to to to to to move on that you ought to move on and my and my statement to that is bro you do what God tell you to do and I'mma do what God tell me to do hallelujah hallelujah you can find all the fault you want in my church but as for me I'm is is a blessing amen hallelujah amen the pastor's Ministry is a blessing to me Hallelujah the worship service is a blessing to me Hallelujah Hall and I'm going shock you now the location is a blessing to me some people say why y'all in aring why not Michigan Brother Paul's over there why not Toledo or or or Pennsylvania where brother so and so is no this is your position God plac you here hallelujah and in your place your inward Spirit man will Thrive Hallelujah you make the mistake Hallelujah you make the mistake to say oh man I just love brother Donnie's Ministry I'm moving down there and if you're not placed there you will get there and die amen with that sitting under that powerful ministry that's right no doubt he's a man of God I love Brother Don I appreciate him hallelujah hallelujah but I know if I make up my mind say you know what I'm sick of South Carolina I'm moving to the mountains I want to be in Happy Valley I'm sick of the miserable Sun I want to be in Happy Valley and I get inspired and my flesh is drawing me away and I said you know I'm going up here and I can sit there Hallelujah the worship service be powerful brother Donnie comes out and he preaches under Revelation Hallelujah under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and because I'm out of place I never grow everybody else around me oh hallelujah boy pastor preaching I'm like man I just I just ain't getting nothing you know why because I'm out of my position am am Hallelujah there's nothing wrong with the ministry there's nothing wrong with the church the problem is me and we see that all over the world Hallelujah people leave churches for convenience people leave churches cuz they want to get married and all these other things what about what God want you to [Applause] do Hallelujah CH we got let me throw this out for sisters that may be listening or get just take we got two sisters at our church Hallelujah that have been recently married under three years or or four years Hallelujah but one of them she sat in our church hallelujah or she sat single serving God for 18 years and she didn't move around say well you know what I'm going go I'm going go down here there's more black people down here I'm going go over here I'm moving back to Africa I'm moving this you know I got there there Christian Brothers over here I'm going to no she stayed faithful Hallelujah she stayed faithful she served God hallelujah and her brother Hallelujah reached out to her and they married and you know what she to leave church he came to our [Applause] church Hallelujah there's another sister in our church Hallelujah she she she grew up in church when she got a certain age she left Hallelujah went out of the world went wild then she came back Hallelujah and she wanted to get married things got tough she left again and she still couldn't find love even when she was in the world she said her life was miserable Hallelujah it was all messed up and the devil was as the devil say to her you going to never find a husband with this testimony you got cuz you didn't did some of everything you all jacked up Hallelujah but you know what Hallelujah a brother came Hallelujah he got witnessed to by some by some more Saints from our church he came from that denomination to our church and when he came to our church that same sister with all that baggage with all that messed up testimony he looked at her and he said who is that Hallelujah church I'm going say something that uh uh Matt Watkins said at our church and I about did a backflip when he said it do you ever hear something the preacher saying and it's it it hits you in such a place of Revelation but the Revelation doesn't give you the big head it causes you to Rejoice H and this brother was preaching and he was talking he preached a message called broken but not bitter Hallelujah if you can find it go listen to that one Hallelujah it'll really help you amen hallelujah it's all this the fivefold ministry amen broken but not bitter he preached it out Church Hallelujah listen church when he was preaching that message he made a reference he said you can look at people's lives and you see their struggling you see all these things and and and because of who we are as Believers we're word people so what we do is we measure things up by the word amen we measure this up by the word we measure that up by the word we measure one another up by the word and he say doing that you can look at somebody and see what they going through and you say that disqualify them for this that disqualify them for this but he said the very thing that disqualifies you qualifies you in the kingdom of God hallelujah oh my peter Hallelujah being the man he was was what qualified him to be the man he was Paul being the man he was was what qualified him to be the man he was hallelujah oh my Church positioning and placing is everything look if we could just get all in our proper place and position tonight H don't worry about nobody else what nobody else doing see what I'm preaching tonight is a fragment of adoption yes because your spiritual placement really deals with your adoption an adoption is you being able to sign the check h write the check sign it and don't have to ask God for anything because you know who you are you said brother is that true yes it's true look Hallelujah you can look in the Bible Hallelujah and you can see men who were adopted in Hallelujah their position where they didn't have to pray yes sir they just spoke it and it happened Hallelujah listen Paul knew who he was in such a place where he would say hallelujah After I'm Gone gous wol was going to come that's right because he knew who he was he knew that nobody would come and challenge him under the inspiration of his position Hallelujah in his position he was unchallengeable God tomighty who who does that sound like that sounds like Christ am Christ was unchallengeable in his position whatever demons and Devils came around Hallelujah they told Jesus we know who thou are Jesus say shut up don't tell nobody nothing see let me tell you something the Devils know who you are in your position nobody else might not know but the devil knows how every every demon power knew who Christ was amen amen the Sadducees and Pharisees they call him be El above but the Devils call him the Holy One of Israel why because they saw him in his position what was his position Lord of [Applause] all and because the Sadducees and Pharisees were out of their position Hallelujah as unbelievers they couldn't recognize God hallelujah and that's why people can't recognize God said the prophet because they out of position yes sir yes sir hallelujah oh my listen to this Oh my he says now try hard Christians to understand that this day that the message has been placing the believer in positionally place listen if every believer any believers in here tonight if every believer in here was in their place if every believer in here tonight yes was in their place now we just say Believers in here hallelujah yes sir oh my if every believer in here was in their place well I'm so thankful that we're whole rows of wheelchairs are set and there's only about two or three in here left if every believer knew their place a lady on a cart the man with the crutches along along there there would not be listen if every person was in their position in this church there would not be a feeble person in this building listen in the next 20 minutes yes sir if everybody was in that position we wouldn't have to come up here with prayer requests right our lives will be the solution to what they need Hallelujah all we have to do Hallelujah is make contact and speak to that Hallelujah situation if everyone was in their position Hallelujah when we come to pray Hallelujah things will happen hallelujah amen because everything in his proper place only speaks of Victory hallelujah hallelujah what happens church when you go to sleep amen your body takes a rest but if everything is working right you wake up again yes sir Hallelujah you say I woke up cuz it was time no you woke up because everything was working right H some people don't wake up why because something happens in their sleep something got off Hallelujah you wake up Hallelujah because God kept everything working right Hallelujah and let me say this if this church continues to have everything working right people in acon will begin to wake up hallelujah hallelujah yes they begin to wake up and realize they're out of position Hallelujah why because everything is working right in this church husbands Hallelujah will wake up wives will wake up children will wake up co-workers will wake up amen hallelujah because everything is working right Hallelujah yes listen you know when you think about being positionally placed I ain't going to be too much longer I'm about to close but Church what I want to for the next couple minutes I want to take a key word and just kind of deal with it for a little bit and the key word where the Bible says you know in in in in in Romans it says the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God yes hallelujah hallelujah and you know there's a quote where the Prophet is is is I believe is wisdom versus Faith where the Prophet says Jesus defeated the devil simply by knowing who he was he didn't have to say Satan leave me alone in the name of the Father the Son the no you didn't have to do none of that that's right he have to I called down power from Heaven because I'm God he didn't have to do none of that Hallelujah he just knew who he was Hallelujah and what did that do that stopped Satan right in his tracks he knew he was the heir of all things Hallelujah he knew amen Satan came and tried to Temp him with bread he's the creator of it Satan came Hallelujah and tried to tempt him Hallelujah with a response to the angels lifting him up he's the creator of it Satan came and he tried to tempt him with having the whole World he's the creator of it Satan couldn't tip him why because he knew his position he knew who he was he knew his place Hallelujah he knew Hallelujah that the Angels were subject to him he knew Hallelujah that the world was subject to him everything will Bow Down at that moment in time so the enemy couldn't move him couldn't make him move off of his position Hallelujah and in his position he was Unstoppable Hallelujah yes sir listen let's look at it let's look at Jes let's look at this is who we serve H we serve Jesus Christ amen they say Yahweh are no Jesus Christ yes amen they say yua Jesus Christ amen they say Allah Jesus Christ when I call on that name things happen it ain't been one time I call on Yeshua and something happened but it been several times I Call On Jesus and something happen Hallelujah but Church in his position you just look at how he operate everybody all right amen you look at how he operated he knew that there was a time he had to give his life that was a part of his placement Hallelujah but look let's understand something nobody could take his life even in his position to die to to to to die to death of the Cross nobody could take his position Hallelujah nobody could take his life Hallelujah because he knew he was and look Judas Judas when betrayed him and Judas said look the one you get the one you come get is the one I kiss Hallelujah so Judas came Hallelujah and his proper placement of the kiss let them realize who he was Hallelujah but look at Christ Hallelujah Christ is such a gentleman he can let himself betrayed by the placement of a kiss oh my oh the placement of a kiss Hallelujah the kiss of death hallah but it was the kiss of death that set us free Hallelujah it was the kiss of death that would change our position forever that's right Hallelujah it was the kiss of death that made you and I Ash to the throne thank God for the kiss of [Applause] death but what was Judas he was in his position that's right because Jesus said hey that what you do go do it quickly so he was right in position nobody else could do it no nobody else even knew that Judas had to kiss of death all they saw was him Healing The Sick and raising the Dead doing the stuff that they was doing but they didn't realize there was going to be in a point of time in his life where he had to have the proper placement to kiss a death man Hallelujah but you look church amen they come to get Jesus and the Bible says they came with stabs and and you know they came very aggressive Hallelujah but Jus say who y'all looking for he knew who he was H and he knew that nobody could take his position amen amen you know what uh somebody could come God forbid and tell the owners of this building I need that other side over there because I want to start a church Jesse don't have to say anything he don't have to ask that person like man why you want to do that don't you see I got a church right here this is my jurisdiction he ain't got to do none of that Hallelujah all he got to do is stay in his position Hallelujah and whoever is called Hallelujah to be under the voice of that Shepherd they won't lose their position Hallelujah they'll stay right in line Hallelujah because they know the shepherd's Voice Hallelujah that's the problem with people that're relocating and doing all these things why because they don't know the shepherd's voice we've heard the story Hallelujah of the shepherd walking through the market with a line of sheep that's right they said they just walking through all these distraction there fruit there's all these things that the Sheep like to eat they ain't they ain't paying attention to none of that what are they looking at the shepherd hallelujah hallelujah there things that there things that uhh they may like to eat there there's all kind of enticing things old they may be other other uh female sheep and all these of another lineage and all these things walking through the market Hallelujah but they got their eyes on their Shepherd hall hallelujah and the story goes as he turn they turn when he stop they stop when he move they move H why they're connected to his [Applause] placement they're connected to his position amen yes and I've come to realize huah amen that there are people all over this world that are connected to my Ministry Hallelujah and there are people in this church that are connected Hallelujah to my Ministry Hallelujah this church is connected Hallelujah to the gift God gave in me Hallelujah and I'm here tonight to place it you say Brother D why are you saying that cuz I want you to understand that this message Hallelujah that's being preached tonight is coming from your inspiration hallelujah it's it's it's it's it's coming from your pool hallelujah what is happening you're pulling and God is placing your thoughts right back in your bom woo wo see I can't study for what you need all I can do is yield and as I yield Hallelujah God will give it and place it right back in your lap Hallelujah seems to encourage you but then you look Church Hallelujah Christ in his position he can look at the enemy right in his face and say I am [Applause] he because he knew who he was and he knew nobody could take his life we can tell cancer tonight I am heal Hallelujah we can tell diabetes I am she Hallelujah we can tell depression I am [Applause] he hallelujah hallelujah because God knew who he was and look here comes the enemy the enemy comes and and they want to take his life but they can't because it's not given to them that's right his life was given for usah so they couldn't take something that wasn't for [Applause] them Hallelujah and look Church they come up and Jesus say why y'all come with stabs and knives and all this stuff who you see he said Jesus B say I ain't no criminal Hallelujah I know I'm supposed to die Hallelujah y'all just ain't GNA make me die it's a choice Hallelujah Glory it's a part of my position H he says he said he said they say who do you seek he said they say Jesus of Nazareth they knew his name and everything they knew exactly who he was Hallelujah but you know one thing about the devil they didn't know how he looked they heard about him Hallelujah they may have seen some people that were healed by him but they couldn't recognize him Hallelujah you know why because they never saw him in his position church and we are people who seen God move as a savior in his position we are people who seen God move as a Healer in his position Hallelujah we people who seen God move in the ministry of a prophet we've seen him in position that's why we can be content because we've seen God in his position we seen him as Jehovah Lei my battle aall I've seen him in position I've seen him in position as Jehovah [Applause] Gyra over and over and over and over and over again Hall so I don't get worried if I'm seen him in that position before Hallelujah he can't move out of it right am Hallelujah GL he can't move out of it until the game is over and the game is still in session Hall these are some long quarters Hallelujah but we see them as Jehovah Shalom Hallelujah GL we seen him as a peacegiver in his position hallelujah oh we going to say something now but you look they say Jesus now you said whom you see he said I'm he and everybody fell down cuz they wern't ready for a man who knew who he was they wern't ready for that kind of authority to say I'm going show you who I am but you still can't touch me God to oh my church about to say something heavy now hallelujah we're showing the world who we are as Believers but the devil still can't touch us amen hallelujah he says I am Jesus they get back up they fall down they he said I'm going ask you again just to show them y'all can't touch me Hallelujah Oh my he said Jesus now everybody fell down there's another spot in the Bible Hallelujah where where the scripture says that they they wanted to throw him off a clear and what did Jesus do in his position he walked right through all of them amen didn't even get touched they didn't even grab his clothes you know why Hallelujah because in his position there's no scripture of him dying off a [Music] [Applause] cliff he's supposed to die on the cross he's supposed to be crucified he ain't supposed to die Hallelujah off no Cliff hly there's no scripture of you and I dying from cancer Hallelujah there's no scripture you and I die from diabetes that's right there's no scripture Hallelujah of me living in poverty [Applause] Hallelujah find your scripture and live by it step into that position of it some of you are out of place you go to the god they say you got D you out of place there's no scripture for me to receive sickness hallelujah hallelujah he walked right through the enemy why because there were no scripture amen there was no placement on his life Hallelujah listen I believe this church sits under a fruitful Ministry amen so I'm going drop something heavy on you if this church sits under a fruitful Ministry nothing in this church should be Barren hallelujah amen nothing in this church should be sterile Hallelujah but everything in this church should bring forth life amen and life more abundantly woo Hallelujah Stop Believing the devil's lies it say in my position I'm supposed to bringe forth life I choose to live and not die yeah what are you saying brother digs I'm saying I am a [Applause] air we are hirs a to the throne oh my listen I'm about to close but listen you take the word air most time we take that word air but before I before I before I go through that let's look at the Life of Christ a little bit more we see Hallelujah in his position nobody could touch him unless he wanted to be touched right listen in this spot Hallelujah they say we come to get Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus say I am he and everybody fall down Hallelujah but then hallelujah that's because he didn't want to be touched Hallelujah he didn't want to be touched by unbelievers Hallelujah but look there was another place Hallelujah where he was sitting down Hallelujah sitting in Simon's house nobody paid him any attention Hallelujah no nobody washed his feet he was there to be touched and nobody would touch him Hallelujah but look there was a woman who woke up that morning Hallelujah and her position was going to [Applause] change she she's going to go from woman on the street Hallelujah to woman of God hallelujah hallelujah she's going to go Hallelujah from a pastor Tru to a wife Gody Hallelujah you never know when somebody's position is changing Hallelujah it can change just like that H sometimes all it takes is the right mindset Hallelujah all it takes is the right thought process and she woke up that morning and said today is the last day I'll be a prostitute and then she stepped in position Hallelujah as a glory Giver Hallelujah she went from prostitution to a glory Giver Hallelujah you say brother what do you mean Glory Giver Hallelujah Church she went Hallelujah she went and bought an alaster box Hallelujah this box was full of all kind ofh scents and and different perfumes and all these things Hallelujah you know there were things in that Alabaster Box Hallelujah that that pointed out the ointments and things that Hallelujah she poured on Christ Hallelujah and you know there are ointments that are a type of Christ Hallelujah so in her position she was even typing out the death bury and resurrection of Jesus [Applause] Christ Hallelujah because you take the orament of Frankincense M and other other different senses deity in service to die right and now here she's come with her ointments in service as a glory Giver H what do you mean Glory Giver Church Hallelujah now she takes these ointments and she pours It On Christ Hallelujah she pours the ointments on him and then she begins to give him her glory she takes her hair Hallelujah and she begins to wash his feet with her hair her tears she became a glory giver and in her position God gave her back what she gave him she gave him glory and he gave her the testimony of Glory [Applause] Hallelujah but listen back to the position cuz you look now there were places in the Bible where he says no man can take my life I lay it down nobody can touch me Hallelujah Jesus walked around Hallelujah under a revelation that you can't touch him unless he wants to be touched Hallelujah now you look at all these men in the house and listen and that and here come this woman Hallelujah couldn't come through the front door probably came through the back door Hallelujah because she wasn't welcome Hallelujah they thought she was out of position then she falls down at his feet and she begin to wash his hair and then they said if he knew who was touching him he wouldn't let her do that catch it Hallelujah in his position that woman full of sins now her heart is changing her position is changing Christ says I want to be touched amen cuz remember here hallelujah he didn't want to be touched Hallelujah he said they say who you see that Jesus Naz everybody fell down they say we going to throw him off a cliff he walked through the cliff how did she get there to touch him how did she get there to put his hands on him because he wanted to be touched and let me say this the only way we are saved is because Christ wanted us to touch [Applause] him the only way we're filled with the Holy Ghost is because Christ wanted us to be filled yeah Hallelujah because if he didn't want us to touch him you wouldn't have touched him brother good amen hallelujah hallelujah Glory am I am I am I closing everybody all right but you look you look at his life and how he walked and the things that he did and Jesus wouldn't even satisfy the thoughts of unbelief amen they come to him and they say are you the king of Jews he say thou say he wouldn't even give him a straight answer what see his life was the unveiling of the mystery the position Hallelujah was a mystery but if you were in your position you could see it unveiled H that's like a real good coach a real good coach knows how to evaluate talent he can look at a player and say that boy right there he'll make a good running back that boy right there he'll make a good wide receiver that boy right there he'll make a good uh quarterback and what he does is he Place those people as he evaluates that Talent Hallelujah and you know what Christ was doing Hallelujah Christ throughout the generations he will evaluating the spiritual Talent of the Believers amen sir sir hallelujah hallelujah he knew Hallelujah I couldn't be born in no's day Hallelujah you know know why Hallelujah because my makeup Hallelujah is not built to go through tribulation amen I ain't built like that I ain't built to get on the boat Hallelujah there were only certain people built to ride through tribulation on that boat Hallelujah I'm built to escape tribulation HJ Hallelujah I'm not built oh my boy I'm going to say something I'm going to shake your booth I'm not built to connect with tribulation I'm built to live above tribulation Hallelujah Church we're not here to go through tribulation we're built to live above tribulation got Mighty hallelujah oh my hey we experience a suffering but not a tribul [Applause] I couldn't be born in Moses day you know why because I wasn't built for 400 years of bondage that's not my placement amen hallelujah I Was Born Free Hallelujah Glory they say you come from Ethiopia no I come from the might of God that's right my ancestors are Heavenly [Applause] ancestors Hallelujah see Jer so you couldn't sit under Noah's Ministry you'd be out of place you couldn't sit under Moses Ministry you'd be out of place Hallelujah you got now I'm going bring it up to our day Hallelujah we talking about spiritual placement Hallelujah you couldn't sit under or Rob's Ministry although Hallelujah they were angels for Our Generation hallelujah hallelujah but that wasn't my placement Hallelujah and you know what El even though Billy Graham was here hallelujah I couldn't sit under his [Applause] ministry Hallelujah there's something inside of us that was [Music] more and what they had although it was good it wasn't [Applause] enough Hallelujah justification is good but it's not enough sanctification is good but it's not enough the gifts of good but it's not enough that's right hallelujah amen so God had to come with a Ministry that could spiritually Place me Hallelujah to reveal everything that was in me and some of us say thank God for the Holy Ghost there's [Applause] more there's more than you just saying I got the Holy Ghost that's right there's more amen but there is a spiritual adoption Hallelujah well your name on the check is just as good as his Hallelujah you take you take brother Jesse and you take his wife Mr Smith Mrs Smith yes and you know for instance go to the same bank they know Jesse Jesse walk in hey Mr Smith how you doing some days he might walk in with his wife they say hey Mr Mr Smith how you doing and if they come in there enough cuz you know they might have a large bank roll they know them by name first name right and they're familiar with them but then the people begin to recognize that they are one and you know what Mrs Smith don't have to do Hallelujah as a wife if she's an air to everything he has right she doesn't have to go into the bank and say honey can I get some money now I ain't I don't know how they operate but what this is a type Hallelujah ain't trying to start no trouble in the home but because she's in position and she's an air to everything he has she doesn't have have to ask for permission unless she want to she can go in the bank under the same Authority with the same checkbook and pull out her identity God [Applause] youright pull out her ID Hallelujah and that ID say Mrs Smith Hallelujah and those people go to the same account that they will pull money out of for Mr Smith Hallelujah and give Mrs Smith what she need why because she knows who she is and if she's really familiar when she comes in the bank the clerks know who she is if she's really familiar they become hey girl girl how you doing how much you need today if she's really familiar and this is happening to me Hallelujah if you're really familiar with the clerk the clerk would begin to identify you before you even step up they know you how by name Hallelujah and there's a place in time there's a place in the world of position where we are known by name Hallelujah you say brother I don't know you're known by name hallah H I got scripture for it the devil say Paul I [Applause] know Jesus I know but then somebody was out of position he said who are you power I know amen I know Malachi I know now you put your name in there in your position Hallelujah there's a world that you are known by name right Hallelujah glory and church our position position is everything spiritual position adoption and listen what does it mean to be an heir the word Heir there's a lot of different things where you could say like um in England Queen Elizabeth died I think last year and her death made somebody else take over the throne right her husband died and she became the queen and she was the queen for years right she got two boys I think yeah she got Charles and I think Charles got boys something like that whatever y'all know what I'm talking about whatever and when she passed Hallelujah Charles became what king but as long as she was there she was Queen and Charles was just supposed to be king it don't work like that in the kingdom of God because of who he is I am hallelujah hallelujah look Hallelujah when the Sadducees and Pharisees start talking they talk Jesus said Abraham Rejoice to see my day Hallelujah see so Jesus was basically telling him Abraham knew who I was even though y'all don't y'all rejoicing about Abraham Abraham rejoiced about [Applause] me Hallelujah so we don't glory in what we can be on this side we glory on what we are in it in the neighborhood of [Applause] christall and you look back to it now Charles has taken over so he's become king why because the queen has died Hallelujah but Church look what I'm about to say hallelujah amen do you realize we were royalty before anybody ever died the Bible says before the foundation of the world Hallelujah I was a child of God I'm to the throne well look the word Heir you know air oh I'm trying to close but y'all pulling so good H you taking air now that son you know you could become the air to everything your your your dad has Hallelujah cuz you take that son who you it has to be the firstborn or whatever blah blah blah the natural laws but when that father passes his time on this side is over with that son steps over to be air of everything he has Hallelujah yes he he has a uh um I can't think of the right word what they call it coordination something like that where they where they introduce him to the throne and everybody see who he is he takes over now hallelujah hallelujah you know from that point Hallelujah he sits in his position and nobody can challenge him because he runs the whole Kingdom but what does air mean there's there's a lot of different uhh ways you can think of air you can think of air of like a a will and you become air to all of the things the natural things he has and this and that and all this stuff you know air you get the car you get the house and all these other stuff but what I want you to understand about being a Heir what an air does is they take possession of what was left to them yes are you with me all right I'm about to close are we HS are we AES all right joint HS with Christ so in our position as HS we take possession of everything that Christ has so tonight I take possession of healing amen tonight I take possession of Joy Hallelujah I take possession of Peace Hallelujah I take possession of my finances hallelujah hallelujah everything that Christ is hallelujah as an air I take over from it Hallelujah so you and I we should be wanting from nothing we should be taking full possession of everything that Christ is hallelujah Christ is a mighty one War I take possession of my life Christ is a conqueror I take possession of things that need to be conquered Hallelujah Christ is a father I take possession of my [Applause] children Hallelujah if you are an air you have a right to take possession of the things that Christ has left youah hallelujah hallelujah that's what it means to be in air somebody say take over it's time for a takeover some of been sitting on the sideline wondering what's going to happen if you are an heir it's time for you to take over it's time for you to get in your position and operate as an air Hallelujah remember Hallelujah Mrs Smith can sign a check Hallelujah just like Mr Smith can what does she do she takes possession Hallelujah and if we are the bride of Christ it's time for you and I to take possession over the things that Christ has left us hallelujah now come on musicians I'm closing now I say that to say you think about what you stand in need of and you ask yourself is Christ the answer and if Christ is the answer to what you need it's time for you to take possession of it amen hallelujah hallelujah don't wait for somebody else to do it don't wait for some special service this night is time for you to step into your position and in your position there is power hallelujah hallelujah in your position there's a an authority that can't be challenged cuz you remember in Jesus position he couldn't be challenged nobody take my life I lay it down sir only to take it again so even when he laid it down the devil still didn't have no Triumph because he laid it down to take it back that's how powerful your position is let's just remember there's a spiritual placement a spiritual Hallelujah adoption for the bride of Christ oh let me read you something right quick before we get out of here oh my I want to show you something you might be saying well I got the Holy Ghost I'm good no the Holy Ghost is a goal hallelujah it's it's essential the Holy Ghost is essential but there's too many people get the Holy Ghost and then they stop they become good church members Hallelujah there's a lot of people on the team but some people sitting the bench and you know those people on the bench they'll get a ring but it don't mean as much as the person who got a touchdown for them to win Hallelujah those per those people on the bench they'll get a ring but it don't mean as much as that person that that hit the three that maybe sent it in overtime Hallelujah so don't be a person who will get a ring but you ain't did nothing to earn it listen the Holy Ghost is essential but you want Hallelujah you want to be placed in such a such a way to you know that God is getting full Usery out of your life listen he said now here we are now this is what hurts Pentecostal a little they say I got born again praise the Lord got the Holy Ghost fine you're a child of God somebody say amen amen I got the Holy Ghost you're born again you're a child of God he says that's right but yet that ain't what I'm talking about so we make so much emphas get the Holy Ghost get the Holy Ghost yes get the Holy Ghost but don't get the Holy Ghost and stop living Hallelujah don't get the Holy Ghost and stop being used cuz remember Hallelujah the holy ghost sets you into service Hallelujah there's another level for this church to meet once the Holy Ghost is in here moving amen Hallelujah yes the Holy Ghost is essential Hallelujah but don't stop living when you get the Holy Ghost he says but yet that ain't what I'm talking about see you were predestinated unto adoption adoption is placing of a son and until you can answer that question to say Lord I know I'm doing exactly what you want me to do because you showed me my place amen you ain't there There Yet the Holy Ghost is good but there's still some more living for you to do Hallelujah there's still something else we need from you cuz remember Moses was born a deliverer but he had to get in position right that's right Hallelujah his mama told him he was deliverer you know all his family told him he was deliverer all this he had he started to feel it when he was in Egypt till he killed the Egyptian all that he was feeling like a deliverer but he was no good until what he got in possession Hallelujah and out of position he was no good to nobody Hallelujah listen Church Hallelujah Jeremiah Was what born a prophet and his battles got so hard one day he said I'mma quit I'm quit I'm just tired of I'm just tired of everybody tired of all these people I'm tired of all this legalism I'm tired of this I'm tired tired of everything tired of messages I'm tired of TI he tried to quit but then something be to happen to him it was so real what God had revealed to him in his position he said I can't help it that's right it's like fire shut up in my bones I got to say something about God Amen that's where we want to be amen where your trials can't stop you where people's murmering and complaining about you can't stop you but there's something inside of you that challenges you to give more of God more to God not only more to God but more to us because in your position we're blessed am Hallelujah let's pray oh my wonderful God lord we love you and we thank you Jesus father father I pray tonight that you just grant the desires Lord of your people and what they stand in need of Lord Lord just let the Holy Ghost Minister unto your people Lord in such a way Lord it'll take us out of our comfort zones Lord cuz one thing about position Lord is is not to be put in a corner but lord it's it's it's a staple it's a stamp Lord and in your position the enemies were defeated and Lord that's what we want to be Lord just as simple like you said Lord you knew who you were and enemy could do nothing with that Lord we pray that you bless this church Lord you continue to feed us and guide us and lead us Lord into deeper depths and higher Heights Lord not for head Lage but for the re revealing of life and life more abundantly Lord we love you and we appreciate you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and church say amen amen can I sing A Chorus for before you guys get into it just a chorus amen this song has just
