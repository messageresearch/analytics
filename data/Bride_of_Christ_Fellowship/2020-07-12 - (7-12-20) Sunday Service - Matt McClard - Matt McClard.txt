god this morning [Music] appreciate you thank you lord appreciate song service amen appreciate the worship amen to enter in invite the presence of god down amen and inhabits the praise of his people i just truly want to thank brother jesse again for the invite we just enjoyed ourselves last night i i told you know if nobody else enjoyed themself i did hey man i just enjoyed the anointing of the lord enjoyed his word amen when he speaks to your hearts he speaks to my heart too amen as you you you get done preaching you're like lord i i want to practice what i preach amen i don't just want to to preach and to say things that according to your word but lord i want my life to match the word too amen and every true minister that's called of god i believe they want the same thing it isn't for just a paycheck it isn't is it for glory it's it's to truly be a part and to let god move in their lives and and see god just bring his bride together amen amen if you have your bibles with you this morning let's turn to genesis chapter 22 and we'll just trust the lord we'll lead this morning if you have a need amen just pull on god this morning i believe he can take my mind and take my thoughts and direct him right to your need amen well that's the god we serve amen he's a discerner of the hearts intense of the heart of the heart and the word of god will go directly to your need amen so you just open your heart say god i have a need and maybe you don't even know what your need this morning but you just say god i want to hear from you amen and god will meet that need amen genesis chapter 22 and this is uh just want to take a thought this morning of the final test the final test how many believes we're in the final test in the face of the earth amen these are coming to the final test and i believe abraham showed us a very good pattern amen that we can put an example to that we can look and study and see if our life lines up to it amen so we look here in genesis chapter 22 and he says and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said said behold here i am and he said take now thy son my only son isaac will now love us and get to the land of the moriah and offer him there for a birth offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went to the place which god had told him and then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place so far off and abram said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you and abram took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering and abram said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a bird offering so they went both of them together don't you love these scriptures amen they're just beautiful and they came to the place which god had told him of and abram built an altar there and laid the wood in the order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and abram stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham he said here am i and he said lay not this hand upon thy lad neither do anything unto him for now i know thou fierst god seeing then that thou hast not withheld thy son thy only son from he and abram lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and abram went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and abraham called the name of the place jehovah jireh and this and it said to this day in the mountain lord it shall be seen this is our hearts turn one more time as we might become father we've read your word lord god we just ask for anointing to come and god that you'd speak your word to your children father god speak to me father lord we're just expecting great things this morning lord god i pray that you pour out your spirit lord there'll be ones of need of healing lord of deliverance father god we are not the healer lord but god you are the healer father so lord we just pray that your presence would come and move on the people's heart move on our minds father god just move us up into an atmosphere to be pleasing to you lord we give you praise we give you glory in jesus name amen and amen you may be seated you know sometimes and this is maybe just me but sometimes you begin to talk about bible characters and you know they seem so big amen they seem like oh abraham noah moses they never had any problems they never did anything wrong they were perfect they were in the bible amen but if you read the bible that's not the truth amen amen if you look at the scriptures you know we hold them in such high regard which i believe we should saints of god but we put their lives so untouchable that we can't live that kind of life but if you look back at abraham's life i'm so thankful that abram came out of the earth the child is why because he was a heathen oh glory he was a gentile how many can identify this morning the bible said brother branham said he was an ordinary man how many can identify this morning not somebody special not some way unattainable thing but he was an ordinary man hallelujah you're telling me an ordinary man can hear the voice of god praise the lord this morning i'm evidence of it i'm an ordinary man but the voice of god has come down in my life hallelujah and god brought it and it matched the word that my story is right there at the end of hebrews 11. it matches right up with them how do you say that brother man because they without me is not made perfect but there is one that has come that has made things perfect and he's come to the ordinary he's come to the small he's come to you and i this morning hallelujah you know sometimes in our mind we get abraham father abraham paul motherboard just so high that it's unattainable the saints of god those examples were written for you and i to show us that it's attainable but it's only attainable by the grace and election of jesus christ hallelujah was abraham looking for god no were you looking for god you said brother man i i went to church i i wanted to notice you who led you to go to church who sent that guy down your way who was it it was the trolling power of almighty god that came that it was the grace of god many has rejected that call but aren't you thankful this morning by the grace of god you're still standing you're still walking you're still going it's the grace of god it was nothing abraham did he was not some special person but he was ordinary saints of god all right makes me feel good this morning i don't know about you i'm nobody amen lord help us to stay that way gentlemen jesse we're nobody but god saw fit that he knocked on our hearts you know young person you might hear me this morning and he might come knocking on your heart this morning you might know not not know what the voice of god is speaking to you right i believe our young people maybe sometimes like samuel hallelujah he didn't know what was speaking to him but let me hear you this morning god comes knocking on young people because i believe there's young people in this message that need this voice of god speaking to their hearts i believe they have it speaking to their hearts and they don't realize it right amen thank you god you young people let me tell you stupid before the scars of the world come down upon you listen to the voice of god with everything that's in my heart you know the one that has a true testimony is the one that never went out in the world hallelujah i believe that yes sir so many times you hear the testimony of young people well i did this and you know all these all these young people hear this testimony of how well he went in the world and i don't have a testimony the one that stayed true to god that's the one that has the true testimony hallelujah you don't have to go this way to be scarred to it but the one that is sealed before they even come into that contact that's the one that has the testimony praise oh do you love him this morning amen he was earl of the child this is where he came from at the end of joshua you know what it says about his daddy he was the worshiper of idols amen i believe it let me read it to you i don't think i didn't write down but it's at the end of joshua 24 i believe it is it says terror he said his daddy was a worshipper of idols amen that's what he said says god do you think you think abraham saw these idols do you think abraham washed up these idols you normally do what your daddy does don't you amen so he was right there in it but there came a call upon his life hallelujah aren't you thankful for that call upon your life amen did abraham make mistakes did god see him read his testimony in the new testament his end result was nothing but the blood [Music] if you go back and you look at abraham's call it was i will i will i will i will i'm thankful for the new testament i'm thankful for a new covenant because the the jews everyone in the old testament showed they could not walk under god's covenant but there came a new covenant that you and i might pass this final test that i will write this upon your hearts amen i will put this in your mind i will never leave you i will never forsake you i will i will i will i aren't you glad will that this morning there might be a bad test out here you might going through a hard trial but my god said he will not leave you hallelujah i'm here to tell you this this morning i don't care what i take you're going to pass this test amen you're going to pass this test thy god that called you is able to keep you my god that brought you from here is able to take it from you that thing in your life you don't think you can overcome you can power brother man by the grace of god by the blood of jesus and by the word of yeah that's right your testimony so don't let your testimony be negative and confess doubt hallelujah don't confess that lord praise the lord you know brother jonathan martin sweet brother one of the things i just love about him he is so positive hey brother we are so i'm brother jesse the same way we're just gonna have a great time tonight i mean he's almost like just coming out of his shoes brother everything is so good i'm thinking man does this guy live on a different planet is he living in the same skin i am no but he's doing what our prophet told him to do amen it doesn't matter how you feel [Music] so about hallelujah i don't feel like coming to church this morning why are you here it was something greater within you moving i said i'm going to overcome that i got a headache this morning you know jesus had a headache too he knows how you're feeling hey man but he also knows you're still sitting in the house of god saying praise the lord anyway bless our sister karen this morning amen i love her with all my heart amen amen amen listen now brother said this i just want to paint this picture of abraham so you can directly identify with abraham so many times we get these characters in the bible and we get them so big that we can't ever identify with them they're so much better than us they they uh they know everything that they didn't have any problems but that is not the truth that is absolutely not true god put weaknesses in that bible so that you and i could see that when they had weaknesses they knew where to go where was abraham consciously going if you watch the life of abraham everywhere abraham did you know what he did he built an altar he knew that altar why because he knew he needed to hear the voice of god for the next move [Applause] you know i saw this thing the other day of baptist preachers telling mother jesse about this it blessed my heart he took a woman there was like probably a uh uh a thousand people in the audience maybe it was 500 to a thousand people a lot of people he took a woman out of the middle of the audience put a blindfold on her and said now follow me and the only thing that she had to follow with it was not her visual sign but it was by the voice and he said follow me he walked away from her real quick he said now listen he said that's not the voice of god the voice of god will give you specific instructions amen so what did she do he started walking her around the audience and the only way she couldn't see she didn't know what was in front of her he put obstacles in front of her but he told her take a high step over this next one with your right foot now hold still now stop and he showed her how god aligns everything the steps are ordered of the lord amen but we walk by faith not by faith amen not by what you see not by your understanding amen so many times we won't take a step because we don't understand what god's doing but that's not how he called you he called abraham by faith he called you by faith amen what did he tell abraham separate from the things of the world separate from your family it's a god there needs to be a separation like never before our lives need to be pure [Applause] and it's not you doing it but it's the holy ghost pulling you i feel the pull lord let me give my all that i may be what you want me amen abraham made mistakes abraham lied that's right it's the truth yes but aren't you thankful for i will i will aren't you thankful for an unconditional covenant that he called you aren't you thankful for the grace unmerited favor i want to do right then amen think about it you don't want to just talk well i can do whatever i want no that's the wrong attitude i question your call at the beginning that's right amen right but when that holy ghost checks you you say oh lord i'm sorry that's what abraham did yes amen he went back to the altar when he went down into egypt what did he go back to he had to come back to the place and god intended him for it and he was back on the altar before god and god doesn't want a lamb on the altar he wants you he wants you on that praise the lord yes that only one foot on the ground either that means get up there that doesn't mean one eye over here you could get up there and let god the consuming fire come down consume every one of those desires consume it all that now that holy ghost that fire dwells within you praise the lord amen yes now listen here in verse verse one we're getting our message now by the grace of god it said it came debase it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham brother said this he says god loves to test his people every child that comes to god must be tested i'll train no exceptions everyone yeah hey how many once that free pass how many likes to go through trials how many likes tests nobody does all right but saints of god without this he must prove his child to show that that faith is rock solid in the word of god he is going to test you if you're going through tests and trials don't think you've done anything wrong don't get discouraged look at the word they're there for you it's for your good you're going to love them you're going to see character that's changed through your tribe [Applause] you're going to see faith that's going to move mountains through your trials hallelujah other people said you're either going 10 2 coming out of one going in you're coming out of one why even so much more now because he said he'd make a quick word that character must be in you to rule and reign and the only way that it's done is to fire but don't lose fellowship in the fire don't lose fellowship in the fire yes when the hebrew children walked into the fire where was god right there with them [Applause] don't lose fellowship in the fire don't get so downhearted that you quit praying that's right don't get so hard in your child that you can't open your bible say brother matt when i open it it just condemns me it makes me feel bad get right in there and read anyway say i haven't been there i've been there do you want to yes right you know abraham probably was that way too when he failed god sure he was human don't make him some something he's not you're human too the saints of god there's a grace of an unconditional love that says i will i will i will he has not given up on his own his elect will make it amen so listen in order to pass this final test you're going to go through trials you're going to go through trainings amen and a final test is accumulative [Music] when you go in high school and you come to that finals it's not just what you learned a week ago it's what you started off on that first journey that you went in that final test how many's ever come to a test before you're like i've been through this before right hey i remember what i did last time what do you do you just apply what god has already showed you to that trial now it might come in a different way the next time but god's testing you and trying to like i i had the answer in the word last i came from the word last time i prayed like that whole night man i just i just got down before god and also and then and then brother jesse came out the next morning said i just can't understand why i got to say this but i got to say this and you're back there going you got to say that because i prayed all that long because god heard me and he uses uses in the mouthpiece to speak to me hallelujah what is it saints of god these trials are to mold your character that you will pass this final test amen amen amen lord i believe this is the final test of abraham it doesn't say anything more about abraham being tested like this amen saints of god we need to pass these final tests of this end time hallelujah and i believe we're going to i believe god said his word said that we would be overcomers praise the lord amen so in order to pass this final test what did he say he said abraham there's significance in the word abraham that is a changed name there's a prerequisite to take this final test you must be born again you must have a change of nature you must not be like mommy and daddy any longer you must have a change name your name doesn't match the word of the world any longer but it matches the word of god line upon line preceptable precept your testimony is found right in the word and your name is not this that or the other but it's misses jesus christ there's an identity that you've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you've taken that name lord amen praise the lord you love him this morning hey man it's good to be in the house of the lord amen take your liberty this morning amen take your liberty this isn't just for brother matt to feel good and preach the word of god this is for you to draw off of him don't you just love him amen with all your heart just tell him you love him this morning lord i love you lord jesus hallelujah hey man you know what he loves you back amen he gives you a hug right back amen you kiss him he kisses you praise the lord amen so what was it abraham he was on a first name basis with god i don't know he said to god you need to know him like that it didn't make me oh i met that guy what's his name i can't remember him depart from me you work of iniquity i never even do you what is new you that goes back to the garden of eden it's an intimacy with god you and god alone now when we say that you think this is what brother matt when he first started preaching i've got to know everything god i got to know what seven seals are i got to know this i can know every mystery i've got to know i've got to know i got to know i got a just tell me lord i'm a preacher you're supposed to tell me just tell me what's it say but that's not how it works you want to know the man christ jesus in such a personal way and that you and him are on a first name basis he says your name and you respond you're in communication with god how did he know his voice it wasn't sarah calling the other room there wasn't some hay guy or somebody else calling from a tent out there but there was a still small voice that said abraham he calls you by name he knows who you are he's always known who you are he knew abraham before he ever got to abraham said brother matt why would he put me through all these things god knows what you need so you'll pass this final test he prepares his people that they will pass this final test you know where he prepares his people right here judgment begins at the house of god amen he begins to test you right here you think the messages that come across this pulpit it's just brother jesse it's just whoever steps behind her no it's the same holy ghost it's preparing his people that they'll pass this final test [Applause] how many has ever heard something on sunday and then by tuesday you're going man look at that brother jesse just told me about that no no it was the holy ghost through brother jesse that just told you about that that's right because if brother jessie could place it just out for you he would probably do his best but that's not the way god gives it to you he gives you a message you come out here and you begin to speak the word of god you begin to pull on god you say things you didn't even know before you get out here when you get out here you can study as hard as you want give every ability you have but god can't use our abilities he just wants a sacrifice vessel to say lord use me he wants you to do the same thing he just wants ones that will say lord use me hallelujah praise the lord so he was on a first name basis with god saint of god that's how you need to know him yes it's not a made me gardener i know about god i know how i'm supposed to be baptized i know so i know i know i know i know i'm talking lord i want to know you hey where was it at jesus speech lord i want to know you when you pick up your bible sometimes it comes i got to read today all right i'll say amen if i have to but as you bow your head and you pray over your food bow your head and pray over your bible amen god give me my daily bread amen hallelujah you know it's not dead word it's a living word amen it's different when the bible becomes living in it that's right that 15 minutes reading turns into an hour can't wait to get back home yes sir yes sir that's how your friend jesus wants to talk to you hey man sometimes we make him god glory he's way up in heaven but he's your friends [Music] friend cares for you yes friend loves you friend sees your problems yes friend wants to talk to you you know my prayer life changed when i started talking to him as a friend i told him all my worries all my doubts all my fears yes sir you know but when i looked at him as oh he he probably thinks i'm an idiot because of that okay i'm just me man i you guys laugh at me i don't care you know when i talk to him as a friend yes i shared my problems yes i shared the real intermediate fails and has so many weaknesses man you talk about a friendship you talk about a relationship you talk about a connection you say matthew that's okay buddy you're down there in that flesh body you know i understand that you're going to have those problems you know did you see over in the scriptures where i i wrote this for you yeah you know what did you see where job went through this did you see where david you know when he was in a point of crisis do you see where he got the urine of dynamite he's just gonna look god said go and take back what a friend we have in jesus name i believe that's the relationship abraham had with god he was not only his ruler his maker his lover but he was a friend of god amen believe the bible says he was yes abraham a friend of god praise your lord thank you didn't you have that my nose amen amen you love him this morning yeah listen he called him abraham so he had a changed name he also had that kind of communication with god he was on first name basis sometimes he has to say matthew hello wednesday did you not hear that that was for you quit pitchforking it on thursday it comes back to your memory you're like then sometimes you gotta get you laying on your back before you really listen that's not type of relationship it's gonna help you pass this final test but listen to the voice of god listen to the teacher listen to the holy ghost that lead you and guide you into all truth amen saints of god you must be able to hear his voice in order to pass his final test hallelujah you must because through the voice of god comes correction through the voice of god comes wisdom through the voice of god comes instruction through the voice of god he gives you encouragement amen amen through the voice of god you know if you if you came up if they told me this morning i had to run 20 miles i'd be like hey there's no way but if i'd listened to somebody that told me six months ago hey you got to run 20 miles on this day and your life depends on it then there'd be a training that would be going on what does the bible say study to show thyself approved amen amen amen study states of god this this word of god this is not just for brother jesse to dig into find everything and just come out feed you yes god does that but what about you at home how many ever has a question when you come into church and the brother preaches something like man what is he talking about write it down yes go and study on that because god put that crush there's where leia comes in [Music] l-a-z-y that's right brother right you get lazy how do you know that brother matt i'll go down there and say amen amen you know the seats of god maybe god wants to tell you something that maybe wasn't in the message that you heard it just that way but he wants to see what you will do with that whether or not you'll go into your prayer closet and begin to pray brother said when there were things too high that he couldn't attain he said he prayed until he came up to him praise the lord amen and there's so much here in this first verse he said abraham what did abraham do he responded to the word of god when god said his name he responded abram what did the angel do to mary he waited until mary said be it unto me according to that word he waited on her he told her what god said but he wants to hear a response from you amen amen when the word of god comes and rebukes you when the word of god steps right into your house into your temple what is that is that oh brother justin just preaching hard on that again he likes to stop on my toes he knows i do that no no he doesn't that's the voice of god amen sometimes because it doesn't come audible or the way it thinks it do or or or if it comes in correction we don't like that but that's the voice of god respond to the voice of god and if the voice of god says you're guilty then just raise your hands and say guilty and say god i put it under the blood amen amen amen lord abraham and he said behold here i am you know this morning i asked you just say here i am lord take no thought for yourself don't think of what you need what you don't need but you say lord here i am all my faults all my failures everything i am lord i am here what is it the bible it says he presented himself a living sacrifice which is what your reasonable service maybe this morning just say lord here i am lord i'm in this final test lord i'm responding to your word here i am lord jesus i believe god has everything you have needed but he's looking for vessels that would open their heart and say lord here i am i can't do this on my own lord i need you lord here i am lord jesus they may be not just here this morning but may hear you tomorrow saying lord here i am i heard your call lord god i see what the word says i want the reality of the word god here i am lord god make me a living vessel i believe in isaiah what was he saying here i am the lord amen you know paul when he came down there and he got blinded it was a nice and an ass you know what he said he said ananias you know what internet said here i am amen that's the kind of vessels my god wants you want to pass this final test you must move according to the word of god you must respond to the voice of god you know a voice if it's a voice there's a light behind it how many has ever heard a dead person talk about it there's no breath of life within it so when the voice of god speaks what does that mean there's a living being behind it amen that is able the word of god will not return lord so when the word comes to you and even if you don't understand it believe the voice of god and it matches the word of god it'll bring forth fruits in your life amen the word of god is a seed then commit it to your ground quit digging it up quit doubting it just water it with your faith in your prayers and with the word of god and watch it come to fruits in your life amen amen praise the lord maybe there's one this morning and just say lord here i am i've tried my best i i've done everything i can then let's just give it all to him this morning the only way you're going to pass this test is with a total surrender hallelujah you're not going to pass this with any of your might you're not going to pass this with any of your strength it's going to be all in all in him it's going to be a total surrendered vessel to him anyone that ever did anything in the bible was one that was totally surrendered to god yes you know god will use there's some that you surrendered this that and the other but this final test is going to be a total surrender [Music] right surrendered his heart to delilah and he gave his strength to god all right he says to god let's don't give a part of us to god god will use anything you give him right but this morning heart body soul everything i am the breath of my life here i am total surrender abraham had come to this place and immature that he was surrendered to god surrendered to god amen amen aren't you thankful for god's long suffering amen there's been times that i wasn't surrendered that way but by the grace of god we're surrendering more and more and more and more i like my brother jesse you know there's more we can die out amen there's more we can die out i was praying to myself i know who i am i know my fault i know my weaknesses but god all i can do is bring it to you and ask you lord to help me amen if i'm to overcome it lord then equip me with the scriptures equip me with the word equip me with the anointing equip me with the faith god that i can fight against this thing and i believe he already has but we need to come to him and surrender ourselves surrender our time surrender who we are and god will help us through this final test what was the comforter for it was said to comfort you [Music] it wasn't sent to condemn you it wasn't sent to beat on you it was said to come for you right praise the lord you love him this morning let's read on now and he said take now thy son the only son i that who thou love us man you talking about a test do you think abraham understood this test no my brother matt he had to understand he was abraham no come on now could you i mean think about this do you think you understood that's why we walk by faith not by sight sometimes we don't understand why we're going why god would tell me that why would god say do this i know what i'm talking about i don't understand sometimes when i go through things but that's where i lean not to my own understanding hallelujah you're not trying to comprehend it with your own mind i love it when god gives you the understanding of things it's easier to walk through it but that's when you've got to have strong faith that your face said god said this that's what i'll do i don't understand it cast down that understanding do you think he had emotions right there this is he waited 25 years for this boy he waited 25 years for this boy amen do you think this boy meant something to him a very prominent promise vindicated from god made manifest in his life how much did it mean to abraham it was the apple of his eye i'm sure he got there morning there he is again look at him and i waited how much joy that he brought to him but now your hero's a word from god and god said take whom thou love us god will test you in a heart hard way amen there's been people who've been through some hard hard trials i think of brother branham think about it now he went through a test when his wife passed away i mean he reads that story and can't stand do it with a dry i can't and his baby but there was a spirit that moved inside of him said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name take him now love us i think of the rich young ruler the rich young ruler god came to him and he knew that one thing in his life that it seemed like he couldn't give up oh glory let god speak to your heart right now i don't know what it is but if god's speaking to your heart if god's coming to you and say lay it down lay it down lay it down lay it down then listen to the voice of god and follow me he's testing you to see whether or not you'll have faith in his word [Music] hallelujah just say here i am lord i give it to you amen so listen he said he says and get thee in the land of moriah offer him there for a burnt offering upon the mountain which i will tell you of here he goes again he doesn't even really know where he's going he tells him to take a step of faith is this not how abraham was called at the beginning he didn't tell him where he was going he said separate yourself yes separate into a land which i will show you saints of god do you think those tests at the beginning they're clementine take the intercede to the things that you had heard that they might not slip amen amen keep practicing the thing that god has told you when he instilled that prayer life in you when he instilled that that reading in you when he instilled that time with the lord and you get back to it amen we just need to worship him let me sometimes just a a time of singing to the lord you know there's healing in music they say i love in my house you ask my family i love for music to be playing almost all the time and it's just an instrument instrumental music in the background just a peaceful setting an atmosphere an atmosphere that god could come atmosphere to be peaceful and sometimes places it's not so peaceful because we're human beings and we've all got our own opinions and set an atmosphere that god would be pleased to dwell in so where it is moses is still walking by faith since god is time we learn we walk by faith not by sight not by feelings glory some people walk in their christian walk like feelings and they're up one day and on their face the other because feelings will lead you astray feelings will lead you contrary to the bible [Music] i'm sure jonah didn't feel well with wells belly right here i don't think he had a lot of room i don't think he was in a lazy boy down there in the wells belly right but he set his face back toward the temple of god amen there's been a temple that was rented on calvary set your eyes on calvary this morning amen i will tell you listen now praise the lord you love him amen listen and abraham rose up early abraham what did he do he began to act upon the word of god do you think abraham slept that night no do you think abraham had mind battles yes but abraham had come to the point that he started to overcome the mouth and he knew what the word of god was saying to him and he put action behind it even though his mind battles even though his thoughts even though his feelings were contrary to what god was saying he had said here i am lord he had sacrificed everything he had you want to pass this final test it's time we get to kicking out some feelings it's time we get to beating some of these mind battles and keep our eyes on the word of god and god's word will take us through you say hi brother matt i don't know how he just said he would he'll do it amen each one of us has a different route to go each one of us has a different trial to go through each one of us have a different test amen but we all go through them amen but god knows how to mold your character to match jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we look just like he in his image it's through those trials and testings it's through the fire seats of god hallelujah you love him this morning amen he rose up early it's time we begin to act upon the word of god amen amen i don't think abraham understood everything that was going on you know i don't i i don't he didn't have it it doesn't say anywhere in scriptures now there's going to be a time that i'm going to show you what you're going to do and he knew every step brother branham himself my wife sent me this quote here recently i love to talk with my wife about the word hey man you want to talk about real fellowship there right there husband and wife talking about the word yes that's one of the first things when we had our phone conversations we talked about one another we how much we like to love but we talked about the word we still do amen by the grace of god she sends me quotes i send her quotes i send their scriptures she says hey listen to this message hey listen to this business hey did you hear this hey but donnie said this and hey i heard this said say that i believe you should do that you draw straight with one another that's my friend that's my buddy that's my everything here on the face of the earth amen it's who god gave me right what is it for help me you're also gonna help her too by the way yes sir it's a two-way street praise the lord amen how do you know that brother matt does god help you see that hard mate right oh somebody thought where's scripture for that look at our help mate does not even protect his wife doesn't he help her amen struggles would not he reach down his very strength and give it forth yes sir was it not his passion that he went to calvary who was that for for the redeemed amen amen that's precious grace lord he loved him this morning abraham rose up early saints of god it's time we put action behind the word of god but man i don't know how to put action behind it then get to pray that god show you that's you putting action behind it yes there are two things the prophet said we can do read pray you want to get closer to god read pray yes read pray read paper repeat read repeat that's you putting action behind it yes sometimes we got to have our plan just laid out just i know people some people are that way i got to know what's there before and if i don't know what's there then we need to plan until we get there until we know huh i got a wife she's a planner once we do this we'll do that we're gonna do this next my son's the same way that what we do next but are we gonna be able to do this in this and now i'm like about to see my pants i will figure it out why are you worried about it god puts that in your nature and a lot of times you try to take that nature and you try to mold it with the word of god that's not how it works that's why you fail so much you can't do that you've got to have faith in what the voice of god is telling you because let me ask you has that voice ever led you wrong no sir well matt but that voice led me to a fiery furnace one time i didn't like that you're looking at it wrong man because from that fiery furnace remember there was bondage that was taken off there were things that those shadrach meshach and abed though i'm now free you realize your freedom comes through those trials free from you freedom from you freedom from your doubt freedom from your character that's ingrained in you he begins to rip it out of you [Music] that's what the blood does the blood changes thank you lord jesus thank you hallelujah abraham rose up early do you think abraham told his wife no he had a little wisdom uh sir i'm gonna kill isaac i'll be back a little bit all right honey we'll be back i'm sure you said the same thing you did for the young man we're gonna go for a journey of worship we'll be back why because he knew what god told him in genesis 12 i will take care of you i will take care of you from him i will raise up a seat from you he begin to look at the word of god saints oh god we look at this word of god you know this word of god will help you through your final test it is the instruction manual amen i don't see it like that ask god to give you revelation and through that revelation he begins to reveal through abraham you see your very walk hallelujah hallelujah glory lord help us to see it like that yeah lord help us to i'm in simplicity now not something big blown up way out of proportion i believe that's why god preached god preached not by the man god preached god in simplicity before he preached the seals through brothers hallelujah it was god through and through why it was to show you don't make it so difficult don't make it so hard in your mind that you can't pass this final test i've called you i've given you i provided everything that you have just stay in my presence stay in my spirit stay in my word stay in your prayer closet and i will bring to pass everything in your life don't doubt my word follow my word even if it doesn't make sense to you walk in my word is that right praise the lord you love me this morning he rose up early and he went about the father's business it was the father that told him say to god what was jesus doing he was about the father's business saints of god it's time we get about the father's business that last seed may be laying right here in akron are you searching for it on your job as you go through your job i believe the steps are order of god it's not there for you to just get money maybe that guy next to you needs to hear amen has he heard if he hadn't heard what's your problem amen let him know ask god to give you an utterance ask god to give you an open door i'm not saying push doors down but ask god to give you an open door my wife was saying the other day i love this it's the right spirit about it amen we should witness but our lives should witness louder than ever our words my wife said maybe i need to witness the debbie debbie's our next door neighbor we become good friends with her amen they watch our house we watch her house she does this we talk to her especially i'm just maybe looking for an opportunity there it is states of god look for an opportunity to give god praise they talk about god but there's a difference when we bring them to the message of the hour amen when you show them who jesus truly is the revealed word for the power i don't believe we should just be slinging it around half-hazard though right amen it says not to cast your pearls before swine amen god didn't give you just eye who cares about that no we should be very careful what god gives us praise the lord you love him this morning amen amen listen now verse 4 it says then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes on the third day what is he was still going on the third day to where god called him how many gets in the trial by day two you're like i quit i'm done quit i'll get down there and say hey man [Laughter] you know brother man i'm an emotional person i just i am who i am i can't be anything else who god maybe i'm fighting against him with everything i got amen sometimes my mouth runs away with me i'm praying about it lord help me yeah amen i have faults just like you have faults amen but i know a god that's bigger than my faults i know a god that's changed me already and he's still working on me and he's still molding me into that character i will not doubt that god's still working on me amen glory but it was the third day i say to you tonight do not stop stay in the word of god that god has given to you don't stop don't stop don't stop i don't care how you feel i don't care what it looks like don't stop keep walking until you get to that intended place don't stop that's what eve did she stop for a moment for a second don't even do it don't let doubt enter it don't let anything enter in move with the word of god move it with the word amen what was it rick did she stayed in the field that god had given her she stayed in the field that boaz and told her to stay in stay in the field stay in the message of the air feed on the cleaning gleam from the words saying so lord stay in that message i don't care who falls away i don't care if your husband i don't care who it is you stay in that message say brother matt but it's hard he didn't call us to a cakewalk there's going to be a reason they said you came from laodicea there's going to be a reason but there's still an overcoming power that is the reason we keep moving amen look watch where abraham's eyes were he was lifting up his eyes i believe there's something there for you say so god look up your redemption drawing night set your affections on things above not on things in the world get them off your problems get them off your feelings he had to get his eyes somewhere else other than what was going on right but here he is walking with isaac think about it isaac doesn't know what's getting ready to happen but abraham knows the plan of god he knows what the word of god told him and he's working to fulfill that out but he you think about that every time you see guys he's like oh lord no do you think he was sad human man come on now he had emotions he's not some fictional paul bunyan big massive person greater than all of us no he's the father of our faith he walked the walk on the face of the world that you and i might take his example and say god beard unto me according to the way he let me have that type of relationship with you when you call my name i respond when your word speaks i might walk in it lord may i cast down doubt man i cast down fear man i cast down emotion man cash down all of it lord is it hard by the way there at times it is sneaking hard i'll just be honest with you it's hard yes but it's a final test but we are overcomers by the blood of the lamb he's not called you to fail all right let me say a minute he's not called me to fail he's called me to pass amen he's called me to take a rapture amen he's called me to be in the very image of jesus christ amen amen let me hurry thank you i'm sorry and abraham took the word listen in verse five and abram said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i in the lab will gather you under and worship and come again to you abraham did not speak doubt he did not speak oh glory be negative he did not let his testimony match his feelings glory he did not let testimony match his thoughts he let his testimony match faith in the word of god and his father that he would take care of him he would fulfill his word that seed would come to fruition amen through isaac amen he begin to look at the promises of god oh saints of god there's where we confess our faith it's right in the promises of god don't confess it on your feelings don't confess it on your body don't confess it on anything else confess it upon the word of god and brother branham told us that if we do that he's the high priest of our confession it's right in the word of god and he will take our confession and let it match the word of god amen the problem is it doesn't happen spontaneously so we begin to doubt but keep confessing the word of god and tell your body your soul your spirit comes in line with the word of god until the greatest battle battle ever fought becomes not a losing battle but one that you overcome and you win amen one the devil i have to go down there and bother that guy again he's got that sword man and that shield man that thing hits me right in the forehead i don't last but 30 seconds he always resists the devil he's already submitted to god every morning every time i step then i hear him when he steps his feet up from his bed and i think oh not me today i believe the devil should be afraid of us i believe the devil knows our name yes sir paul you are jesus i know him but who are you yeah but there's members of the bride he knows brother amen hold that he always says amen i just met him i got teased well the devil's scared when he's called to fight you because he knows he's going into a losing battle hey amen he knows that i don't know that light around him man it just scares me to death he's with you that same anointing deals with samson is with you that same anointing that came on shamgar is with you that same anointing that split the red sea is with you that same pillar of fire that led the children of israel is with you hallelujah it doesn't encourage you to know that this morning it doesn't encourage you to hear that that's god's telling you you're gonna pass this test just listen my word follow my word i'm leading you right onto a rapture one of these days you're going to be like enoch you're going to be following my word talking to me and you're going to take another step and it's not going to be on ground and you're going to take another step and it's going to be a little bit higher you're going to take another step and you're going to flap your wings and leave hallelujah praise the lord listen now what was he was doing he was confessing faith say brother but i really do have these symptoms symptoms lying manatees it's not according to the word of god all right right amen we have a hard time there because we're too grip to feelings a lot of the lord help us to be i'm happy in the lord anyway and it really doesn't matter what comes my way late i'm gonna wear a smile hold my head up high and say i'm happy the lord is simple song in it simple faith in the word of god that what god's word said is the absolute truth everything's contrary is a lie amen amen he didn't call you for a hard under under unattainable right but his simple doing what god what did abraham do abraham from that point going into 40 years of studying to to be able to rightly divide the word be able to do everything i'm not saying we shouldn't do that we should labor in the gospel i'm not saying that but it's not based on your ability to do that it's based on the holy ghost coming down and leading you into all truth right all right praise the lord verse 6 and abraham took the wood and the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac what do you do he took his burden and laid it on the promised son oh glory isaac a perfect type of jesus christ thanks of god if you've got burdens you've got things that just seem like you can't carry any longer then i ask you why are you carrying them like that lay them on an altar and leave them there a lot of times we do this oh i got to pray about this we come here and pray we leave out everybody leaves and you stop right there and you come back up here grab that thing smell better take it with me all right leave it there amen commit it to god amen commit it to god i don't care if the devil comes and says you still got it i gave it to god i've committed it to god brother brahm said one of the biggest weapons we have was a christian committal to god when it's too big for you to understand when it's too big for you to do it commit it to god amen man well i think we got some committing to do when that doubt was in your heart when the devil comes and said you're not bright hallelujah and he does you fail too much you're not bright amen they say so god committed to him said god you've called me lord i want to be and lord i believe you're going to move me to that i commit this to you father yeah amen leave it there leave it there and watch what our god will do with it you'll walk for six months and realize that's gone god will totally obliterate that thing what happened instantly i'm not saying that i'm not sometimes it takes time that's right god wants sometimes you have to suffer long how do you get long suffering you suffer long i don't know any other way do you sometimes you have to suffer but that's so you're a partaker all right so the benefit outweighs the suffering listen when we take that first step on the other side [Music] it'll be worth it amen it'll be worth it all yes oh i just want to make it don't let me you your place here and abram said verse 7 and isaac speak to abraham and said my father my father he said here am i my son listen abraham stayed in the same attitude here i am here i am lord here i am my son how many ever goes through a trial when somebody says something you're like what i'll sit down and say that again you get short yeah go through a hard trial your mind's about done but abraham had come to the point that he wasn't going to let his who he was overcome what god's word what he was going through his attitude remained the same he remained positive he remained positive states of god amen sometimes we get negative amen but he remained positive god's going to take care of me i don't know how it's going to work out but it's going to work out anyway god said it would i believe it it's all through the bible every one of them even job you know that job i love the beginning of job have you considered my servant job have you considered my servant do you think think about this what did god think of job all right he knew job could handle anything the devil threw out of him he knew the things of god you might gonna be going through the hardest trial in your life but you know god probably saying have you considered my servant he knows you can handle do you think job had a hard time yes he had a hard time to the boy he said why am i even born right but at the end he had a personal revelation i know my redeemer liveth he knew he had a place in the rapture hallelujah he knew he was part of the redemption amen amen amen praise the lord amen abram said my son god will provide himself a lamb for the burnt offering so they went both of them together they came to place where god had told them abraham build an altar there laid the wood in order you know god likes things in order i don't know how they put things in order but god likes your life in order god likes details in order details amen details how do you know he likes details go back how they built the tabernacle he gave him details amen go back oh glory what was it abraham was in total dependence upon god amen god gave you details of noah on how to build the ark but he never gave him a detail on how to guide it did he he never put a a wheel in there hey turn it left no why because he says you depend upon me saints of god the only way we're gonna pass this final test is we get in total surrender and total dependence upon god amen amen you love him we know the rest of the story we get down to jehovah worried an angel lord called him in verse 10 and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife and the angel lord called up unto him out of heaven he said abraham abraham and he said here am hi hallelujah praise god saints of god so surrender to the word of god so positive yes whole time was he fighting absolutely he was fighting you can't tell me he didn't have emotions can't tell me he didn't have problems i don't believe that like passions i think elijah said yes right but here he was right the exact place doing exactly what the word told him to do amen did he understand it all no do you think joseph understood all of his life no but didn't his life perfectly tight jesus christ isn't god's thinking higher than our thinking hallelujah then if we've committed it to him and we're depending on him then walk through the trial knowing he's going to take care of you and the angel lord called him him out of heaven how many wants to hear this abraham abraham he said here i am and he said lay not my hand upon the land neither do anything unto him for now i know thou fearest god seeing the house not withheld thy holy son well done thou good and faithful servant amen enter into the kingdom the only way we're going to provide the only way we're going to make it through a spinal test is because of jehovah jairus he will provide amen he already has provided but in our individual lives he will provide amen i'm not talking just naturally he provides there too he said he would he said we wouldn't be begging our bread that's naturally and spiritually i don't believe we'll be doing either one of them amen god will provide for us amen amen amen but in your time of need jehovah jireh walks with you jehovah jireh goes through the fire with you jehovah jireh sees how you'll react in the time of crisis wants to see what you will do he loves to try you he loves to test you and it will be hard but jehovah jireh will provide for you that you will pass this final test keep your faith marching forward keep your eyes on the prize keep your eyes centered on calvary keep your eye at you right keep your confession right let it max the word of god and jehovah jireh will provide amen lord hallelujah you know as we go through tests you go through tests in school you study don't you buddy you want to do good on them you study how many was too good on this test you remember the kid in school that always came to the test and you were like oh god and he's like bring it on oh come on i know these answers why because you spent time in the word of god amen amen i'm busy i've got three kids and i've got a full-time job finished to the gospel i've got a yard to take care of i've got a dog the lord help me study more amen amen you know i begin to realize what truly matters to you what to abraham did isaac matter yeah isaac mattered but what matters most pleasing being obedient to the word of god amen amen amen it mattered more to him than his their side yes sir yes sir beautiful preeminence as we spoke about yesterday yes making him first making him the one and only the one that needs most halloween everyone talking to the bride of jesus christ amen he doesn't want to need save this morning through the holy ghost i believe we're talking to them too amen but i'm believing i'm talking to the bride of jesus christ and do i believe

your own feelings come apart from your own desires come apart from your own understanding come apart from all these things and enter into the holiest of holies with me truly get to know who i am get to know my redemptive plan get to know you're going to go through trials get to know saints of god that you're going to pass them get to know what the back of the book says about you hallelujah amen i'm going to make it jesus himself went through the final exam you know that yeah garden of gethsemane what was the way that he passed that exam my will but thine be done what did he do he died more of a death to his self the rem said this he died more of a death he did regarding the city that he did at calgary that's amazing to you don't you really think about that but why didn't he why didn't he fight against it the whole way up the counter would they stick him imagine and spitting say somebody spit me out instantly your fist is probably like this balled up on you he doesn't you don't knock the spit tail in his ear it's natural you do that but he had died so much to self that's where we're at we need to die ourselves of god each one of us has some more diet to do the other man
