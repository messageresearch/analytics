[4:02] anything let me know i'm happy to help
[4:03] you
[4:04] or larkin or anything about the message
[4:06] we're happy to do that we just want to
[4:08] uh
[4:09] we just want to believe the truth so
[4:10] let's look at this league with the gibby
[4:12] knights this morning
[4:13] we'll try to take a little bit of time
[4:14] and preach on this
[4:16] you know we're coming off as far as the
[4:19] story of joshua
[4:20] we're coming off just a great victory
[4:21] right we looked at chapter 8
[4:23] where they finally got victory over a.i
[4:26] uh they started off of course and i
[4:28] think i'll show this map here
[4:30] they started off crossing jordan right
[4:32] uh went to gilgal so before any battle
[4:34] they had to circumcise the people
[4:37] right the people had to be circumcised
[4:39] which represented the baptism of the
[4:41] holy ghost
[4:42] so crossing jordan and being circumcised
[4:45] were both a type of the baptism baptism
[4:47] of the holy ghost
[4:49] and so see god wasn't in a hurry right
[4:51] god wasn't in a hurry
[4:52] he knew there are certain things that
[4:54] had to be done right he knew
[4:56] all the nations would fall god is in
[4:58] control god's not worried about that
[5:00] god knew the people needed circumcised
[5:02] they knew they needed
[5:03] he knew they needed the reproach of
[5:05] egypt rolled completely away
[5:07] god knows if we're going to be real
[5:08] soldiers today everything from the world
[5:11] has to be cut away
[5:13] praise god we have to we have to realize
[5:16] that we're
[5:16] a new creature in christ we're living a
[5:18] new life
[5:19] your old associates got to be cut away
[5:22] your old addictions got to be cut away
[5:24] praise god amen
[5:25] your own lifestyle has to seem like a
[5:27] totally different lifestyle praise god
[5:29] right you're living a
[5:30] a new life now in christ jesus amen
[5:33] you're ruling and reigning in this life
[5:35] by jesus christ the reproach from egypt
[5:39] the reproach from the world
[5:40] has been rolled away and so they crossed
[5:43] into gilgal
[5:44] and then they went to jericho a flawless
[5:47] victory praise god
[5:48] right they just walked around and they
[5:50] obeyed every word of god
[5:52] god gave them a tremendous victory and
[5:54] then remember they thought
[5:56] joshua the leaders thought well we can
[5:57] just go up to a.i however we want
[5:59] they didn't consult god so 36 men died
[6:03] joshua come back god rebuked joshua
[6:06] right
[6:06] but yet god brought him back into
[6:08] victory amen
[6:10] that's what god will do with us god will
[6:12] be gracious to us he'll correct our
[6:13] mistakes
[6:14] but then he'll lead us into more victory
[6:16] amen
[6:17] and they go up to ai they get the great
[6:19] victory we saw how god did that
[6:22] and then god brought them between the
[6:23] two mountains remember and then
[6:25] the ark sat in between them and god
[6:27] rehearsed all the blessings
[6:29] and all the curses of the covenant
[6:32] so i like that god god gives us
[6:35] victories
[6:36] he helps us through our defeats you know
[6:38] and god is gracious
[6:40] to never leave us or forsake us amen
[6:43] hallelujah and now here we see in
[6:46] chapter 9 that
[6:50] uh in verse 1 it came to pass when all
[6:52] the kings which were on this side of
[6:54] jordan
[6:54] in the hills in the valleys in the coast
[6:56] of the great sea over the lebanon
[6:58] against lebanon
[6:59] the hittite the amorite and the
[7:00] canaanite the perizzites
[7:02] and the hivi and the jebusite heard
[7:05] thereof
[7:06] so after they heard about ai and jericho
[7:08] verse 2
[7:09] that they gather themselves together to
[7:11] fight with joshua
[7:13] and with israel with one accord
[7:17] and when the inhabitants of gibbon heard
[7:19] what joshua had done unto jericho
[7:22] and to ai they did work
[7:25] wily and went and made as if they had
[7:28] been
[7:28] ambassadors and took sacks upon their
[7:31] asses and wine bottles old and rent
[7:34] and bound up okay so i just want to
[7:36] share a few things here
[7:38] after these great victories in jericho
[7:41] and ai
[7:41] all these kings
[7:45] they start gathering but but the people
[7:47] of but the gibby knights there
[7:50] uh choose not to now these were warriors
[7:54] these men were some of the most cruel
[7:56] men you'd ever want to meet right they
[7:57] were bloodthirsty in fact that's why god
[8:00] was going to drive him out of the
[8:01] promised land
[8:02] they were so wicked with their sexual
[8:04] sins and their uh their murderous
[8:06] traits all their characteristics god was
[8:09] going to drive them out of the land
[8:11] but these these gibeonites realize
[8:14] this god must be the true god right they
[8:17] all had their own gods right they all
[8:19] worshiped gods
[8:20] and they thought you know even if even
[8:22] if a heathen king defeated another
[8:23] heathen king they thought well my gods
[8:25] came through
[8:26] but when they heard about israel's god
[8:28] they never heard
[8:30] such testimonies before so they thought
[8:32] well he must be a greater god than all
[8:34] the other ones
[8:36] and all these other kings these five
[8:37] kings they rally against joshua
[8:40] but they give you nice to have a
[8:42] realization and a fear of god and
[8:44] realize
[8:45] if their god has done this to jericho
[8:47] and ai
[8:48] he's certainly going to destroy us as
[8:50] well and so they
[8:52] they concoct this plan on how they can
[8:55] trick joshua
[8:57] okay let me skip ahead now
[9:02] now just so you know i couldn't find any
[9:04] brother random quotes on this chapter so
[9:06] i'm basing it all up off
[9:07] all based on what i know from what
[9:09] brother adam said plus all what i found
[9:11] in history okay so i'm just doing my
[9:13] best to preach this
[9:14] uh this chapter now here the gibeonites
[9:18] work
[9:18] wildly or shrewd or crafty in the hebrew
[9:22] okay and it's in order to deceive joshua
[9:25] and his princes
[9:26] and church look it actually works
[9:29] see because israel asked not counsel
[9:33] at the mouth of the lord okay
[9:36] so here joshua is still the greatest
[9:39] commander
[9:40] he's the greatest general the world's
[9:42] ever seen outside of christ
[9:44] because he's a spiritual general but
[9:47] yeah
[9:47] even joshua coming off two great
[9:50] victories jericho and ai
[9:51] even he as a man was able to be deceived
[9:54] when he didn't consult the lord
[9:58] okay now just so you know in verses
[10:01] three and seven
[10:02] we learned that the the gibeonites are
[10:05] actually
[10:06] hivites and hivites were one of the
[10:09] people groups
[10:10] joshua's supposed to drive out but
[10:12] because they lived at gibeah
[10:14] uh i've seen now i've got to go back to
[10:16] that map so i'm that's the last time i
[10:17] don't go back to the map
[10:18] but because the hivites lived in the
[10:20] that location called gibeon
[10:22] they were called gibeonites okay so in
[10:25] other words
[10:26] these are heathens right that are
[10:29] supposed to be under god's judgment
[10:32] okay but yet god here shows them mercy
[10:35] and we're going to see why here we're
[10:36] going to see why
[10:39] now there's at least a three lessons
[10:41] church we can learn
[10:42] in this text we can learn about the
[10:45] shrewdness of the gibeonites
[10:48] we can learn about israel's failure to
[10:50] seek the lord's counsel
[10:52] and we can also learn about the amazing
[10:54] mercy of the lord
[10:58] all right so first let's look at the
[11:01] shrewness of the giving nights now if
[11:03] you got your bible turn to luke 16.
[11:04] let's
[11:05] let's look at this parable it is one of
[11:06] the most misunderstood parables in the
[11:08] bible
[11:10] go to luke 16 if you would 1-13
[11:16] and i'll tell you i'll be honest every
[11:18] time i read it i'm a little bit
[11:20] sometimes i really i got to go back and
[11:21] say what what was this i could look at
[11:23] my notes what was this all about
[11:25] because the way jesus words it is it's
[11:27] different to us we're not easterners
[11:29] right now to the easterner they totally
[11:30] understand it
[11:31] this is an eastern book this is not a
[11:33] western book praise god
[11:34] this is an eastern book and we're trying
[11:36] to understand it with our western minds
[11:38] so we need constant reminders from
[11:41] hebrew sources
[11:42] and also from the holy spirit to
[11:43] understand it okay
[11:45] so verse 1 luke 16 verse 1 and he said
[11:48] unto his disciples there was a certain
[11:49] rich man which had a steward
[11:51] and the same was accused unto him that
[11:52] he had wasted his goods and he called
[11:54] him and said unto him
[11:54] how is it that i hear this of thee give
[11:56] an account of thy stewardship
[11:58] for thou mayest be no longer steward
[12:01] then the steward said within himself
[12:02] what shall i do for my lord taketh away
[12:04] from me my stewardship
[12:05] i cannot dig so he wasn't he wasn't a
[12:09] i'm ashamed so he didn't want to go
[12:11] into manual labor
[12:13] he wouldn't do another overseeing job
[12:15] and just be like a supervisor
[12:17] right and he didn't want to be a beggar
[12:19] on the street
[12:20] so he's like i'm going to lose my job
[12:22] what should i do
[12:24] verse 4. now here's why jesus praises
[12:27] him
[12:28] he knows he's going to lose his job
[12:29] pretty soon but look at verse 4 i am
[12:31] resolved what to do that when i am put
[12:33] out stewardship
[12:34] they may receive me into their houses
[12:37] so this man is looking out for himself
[12:41] he doesn't want to do manual labor and
[12:43] he doesn't want to live on the street
[12:46] right something pretty simple to
[12:47] understand verse 5. so he called every
[12:50] one of his lords editors unto him and
[12:52] said in
[12:52] the first how much owest thou unto my
[12:55] lord
[12:56] so he meets with the people that he are
[12:59] actually indebted to his master that's
[13:01] going to fire him right so this steward
[13:04] took his master's money i'll lend you a
[13:06] hundred dollars
[13:07] okay right but then when he realized it
[13:09] now he must have stole some of that
[13:10] money too
[13:11] he must have said well i'm gonna take
[13:12] 200 but i'll take 100 for me and i'll
[13:14] borrow 100 to you he must have been very
[13:16] he wasted it he did something wrong
[13:18] we're not told exactly what he did wrong
[13:19] we did something wrong
[13:21] well he realizes i'm gonna lose it so
[13:24] here's what he does he goes back in
[13:25] verse six
[13:26] and he said a hundred measures of oil
[13:28] and he sent him take thy bill sit down
[13:30] quickly
[13:30] and write fifty in other words
[13:33] you owe me a hundred but just pay 50 and
[13:37] i'll write it down that you're paid off
[13:40] okay so is that is that just no
[13:43] that's unjust he's actually cheating
[13:46] his me his master out of money
[13:50] but he's still getting his master some
[13:52] money
[13:53] but not all of it verse seven
[13:57] and then he said to another and how much
[13:58] oh it's thou and he said a hundred
[13:59] measures of wheat
[14:00] he said in him take thy bill right four
[14:02] score or 80.
[14:04] so just pay 80 percent of your bill and
[14:07] i'll let the other 20
[14:08] slide now he's giving them a break
[14:12] on their loan
[14:15] and this is not because he's a
[14:16] kind-hearted person this is because he's
[14:18] a selfish person
[14:21] because remember he's like i can't work
[14:23] i'm not gonna go dig ditches
[14:25] and i'm not gonna beg on the street but
[14:27] i'm gonna give my creditors
[14:29] a discount so that later they'll let me
[14:32] move into their house
[14:37] look at verse 8 and the lord commanded
[14:40] the unjust
[14:41] steward now look the lord comes back his
[14:43] master comes backs and commends him
[14:47] because he had done wisely or truly now
[14:50] this wouldn't be holy ghost wisdom does
[14:52] everyone understand that
[14:54] lying and not paying debts off is not
[14:56] holy ghost wisdom
[14:58] right he said but this is he said
[15:01] for the children of this world are in
[15:03] their generation wiser than the children
[15:05] of light
[15:09] now this doesn't mean they're wiser than
[15:11] christians
[15:14] right as far as godly things but what
[15:17] jesus is saying is that
[15:18] sinners like this take more
[15:21] preparation to make sure they have some
[15:24] future
[15:25] needs met in other words worldly people
[15:28] care more about their future here than
[15:30] christians care about their future here
[15:33] that's all jesus is saying in other
[15:35] words sinners will care more about their
[15:37] future
[15:38] in akron then you and i will
[15:41] right like most for example most worldly
[15:44] churches make sure they own the church
[15:46] but you know what we don't care because
[15:48] it all belongs to god
[15:50] right that's an example but brother but
[15:53] jesus
[15:54] is saying here he's he he's doing more
[15:56] for his future
[15:58] he's preparing more for his future than
[16:00] christians would
[16:04] okay now look at verse nine but before
[16:07] we read that let me say it again
[16:09] sinners are not wiser than us because if
[16:12] you've got the wisdom of god
[16:13] you can recognize that the mark of the
[16:15] beast is going to come out of that
[16:16] mother heart and praise god
[16:18] and because of that you came out of her
[16:20] amen
[16:22] so you've got the real wisdom of god
[16:24] this is just speaking of natural wisdom
[16:27] this is talking about financial
[16:28] shrewdness
[16:30] because i came out of the presbyterian
[16:31] church chapel i came out of that
[16:34] fast as i could because i saw they
[16:36] taught the same things as the mother
[16:37] harlot
[16:38] praise god so see we have to be very
[16:40] careful how we interpret this
[16:42] this parable and i say to you make to
[16:44] yourselves look what he says verse 9
[16:46] friends of the mammon of unrighteousness
[16:48] that when you fail you may receive you
[16:50] into everlasting
[16:52] habitations so jesus actually tells the
[16:55] people here
[16:57] he said you can learn a little bit from
[16:59] this
[17:02] now it looks oh yeah he's speaking to
[17:04] the pharisees ah okay
[17:06] so jesus yeah if you go back to chapter
[17:07] 15 verse
[17:09] five i'm sorry verse two and three he's
[17:11] talking to the pharisees and the scribes
[17:13] that murmured
[17:15] he's actually talking to the scribes and
[17:17] pharisees i'm saying to you make to
[17:18] yourselves friends of the man
[17:19] and of the unrighteousness that when you
[17:20] fail you may receive you into
[17:21] everlasting invitations
[17:23] he's not talking to christians right
[17:25] he's talking to the pharisees in other
[17:26] words
[17:27] pharisees you better take care of your
[17:29] future too
[17:31] right you better prepare for the future
[17:34] like this guy did
[17:35] this guy's like i'm not gonna work i'm
[17:37] not gonna break my back
[17:38] and i'm not gonna beg on the street so
[17:40] i'm at least have somebody to live with
[17:42] i can live with i gave i forgave that
[17:43] guy 50 bucks he'll let me stay for a few
[17:45] days i forgave that guy 20.
[17:47] he'll let me stay for a few days but i'm
[17:49] not going back i'm not going back in the
[17:51] workforce to break my back does
[17:52] everybody understand
[17:54] now look at now here's here's the point
[17:56] of the the parable look at verse 10
[17:58] he that's faithful and which is least is
[18:00] faithful also
[18:01] in much and he that is unjust in the
[18:04] least is also
[18:05] in the much so jesus is not glorifying
[18:08] unjust people
[18:09] he's just saying look at their
[18:11] preparation for the future
[18:13] jesus says though we should have been
[18:15] faithful if we were faithful we wouldn't
[18:17] have lost the stewardship to begin with
[18:18] praise god are you with me
[18:21] this guy was unfaithful so he loses his
[18:23] stewardship
[18:24] if we're faithful we'll be stewards in
[18:26] this life
[18:27] and in the life to come praise god amen
[18:30] if we're faithful and
[18:31] with 10 pounds here we'll rule over 10
[18:34] cities there
[18:35] hallelujah so the point of the parable
[18:38] is to say be
[18:39] faithful and yes prepare for the future
[18:42] that's why i pay insurance and that's
[18:44] why i have life insurance if i die
[18:47] then my wife can pay off the house and
[18:48] have a little bit of money so
[18:50] she has a little time to prepare because
[18:52] i don't know what's going to happen
[18:54] i'm going to prepare for the future
[18:55] praise god
[18:57] right i'm i'm not going to be a fool
[18:59] right and
[19:00] we both we all have life insurance you
[19:02] know some of it's really small but
[19:04] we got a little bit just in case the
[19:06] lord would take one of us home
[19:09] i think there's some wiz jesus says
[19:11] there's some wisdom in that
[19:13] praise god
[19:17] but it's not to be unjust it's not to
[19:20] deceive like this
[19:21] unjust man just to say look at the
[19:23] lengths he went to make sure he had a
[19:25] secure place to live
[19:27] and jesus commends him for that right
[19:31] now the real thing is us to prepare to
[19:33] make sure we have a room
[19:34] in that new city praise god amen our
[19:38] desire should we make sure
[19:39] make sure there's a mansion there with
[19:41] my name on it praise god amen
[19:43] hallelujah thank you jesus
[19:47] verse 11. if therefore you have not been
[19:48] faithful in the unrighteous commandment
[19:50] who will commit to your trust the true
[19:52] witches so see he's not glorifying this
[19:54] unjust
[19:55] man he's saying you got to be faithful
[19:57] with you you need to be a faithful
[19:59] steward now
[20:01] right you got to be faithful with the
[20:02] word now and then god will give you true
[20:04] riches later on
[20:06] amen hallelujah
[20:09] and if you have not been faithful in
[20:10] that which is another man's
[20:12] who shall give you that which is your
[20:14] own
[20:16] see we're all we're all working with
[20:19] god's money are we not
[20:21] who gave you the strength to go to work
[20:23] who gave that big raise
[20:25] i get them too so i thank the lord bad
[20:27] right we all do at some point we all get
[20:28] raises most of us right
[20:30] thank god who gives us that raise god
[20:32] but it's really god's favor on our lives
[20:35] amen
[20:37] but we got to be faithful with that we
[20:38] got to pay our tithes we got to give
[20:40] offerings we got to give to the poor
[20:42] praise god amen
[20:43] and then if we're faithful with god's
[20:45] money he'll make us ruler in the
[20:47] millennium praise god
[20:49] he'll make us rulers over cities and
[20:51] nations the bible says
[20:53] if we're faithful with these men and
[20:55] this mammon here
[20:56] god will make us rulers there hallelujah
[21:01] look he even goes to verse 13 he
[21:03] finishes with this
[21:05] now no servant can serve two masters for
[21:06] either he will hate the one
[21:08] and love the other or else he will hold
[21:09] to the one despise the other you cannot
[21:11] serve god amen
[21:12] so this unjust steward hated his master
[21:14] that's why he wasted his goods
[21:17] and jesus saying don't hate the lord or
[21:19] you need to hate riches right
[21:21] hate the world and love god love your
[21:24] master
[21:25] amen love your savior love your creator
[21:28] he's given you life breath
[21:30] you're being every good and perfect gift
[21:32] church help
[21:33] help us to remember that god's given you
[21:35] every good perfect gift
[21:37] amen we ought to serve god because we
[21:40] love him amen
[21:42] not because we're afraid of him or or we
[21:44] don't we dislike him or something like
[21:46] that
[21:46] he's the faithful householder amen he's
[21:49] the loving householder and i serve him
[21:51] with love in my heart praise god
[21:55] now hopefully that helps you by god's
[21:56] grace because that really helped me
[22:00] so i can see the similarities between
[22:01] the gibeonites
[22:03] and also with this parable because they
[22:06] both have shrewdness
[22:08] and jesus likes that he liked that to
[22:10] some degree
[22:11] because that's what we should be doing
[22:13] with spiritual things
[22:15] we should be laying up treasures in
[22:16] heaven hallelujah
[22:19] i don't think we should be laying up
[22:20] treasures in heaven amen where thieves
[22:22] can't break in where moth can't destroy
[22:24] praise god
[22:26] and love our master the lord jesus
[22:31] remember in verse 4 the the steward
[22:34] found a way to secure future housing
[22:36] christ's emphasis on faithfulness
[22:38] preparedness
[22:39] motivated by love to ensure our natural
[22:42] and eternal destinations
[22:45] that's why he told the parable and so
[22:48] that's what the giving knights do
[22:50] church since now look god accepts the
[22:54] giving night so look at this
[22:56] the word said they should have been
[22:57] killed
[22:59] god's command of joshua's don't let any
[23:01] of them live
[23:04] right but god here spares their lives
[23:08] from judgment
[23:09] you know i just put this this is a
[23:10] little different uh so i said their
[23:12] wiley works do not seem the same as
[23:14] satan's wiles
[23:15] in other words i don't believe that
[23:16] gibby knights had satan's wiles i don't
[23:18] think it was a
[23:20] i personally don't believe that
[23:23] i believe it was god's mercy
[23:26] okay and i'm going to prove that to you
[23:27] hopefully by the end of this you know
[23:29] because the bible said
[23:30] they they were wiley but i don't believe
[23:33] it was the devil necessarily
[23:37] and here's why uh
[23:41] oh yeah in verse nine and ten also in
[23:43] joshua chapter
[23:44] nine the bible said they knew about them
[23:47] so the the gibeonites knew about i'm
[23:49] sorry the bible said they didn't know
[23:52] yeah yeah so here let's go back to the
[23:54] giveaways when the given nights come to
[23:55] them they have moldy bread right if you
[23:57] read the chapter
[23:58] they have moldy bread and uh their
[24:00] clothes are all
[24:01] old and torn and they kind of deceived
[24:04] joshua and the people
[24:05] so in verse 9 and 10. they said from a
[24:09] very far country
[24:10] thy servants are come because of the
[24:11] name of the lord thy god
[24:15] for we have heard the fame of him and
[24:16] all they did in egypt now look
[24:19] they just talk about egypt so they lie
[24:21] they have a partial truth but it's not a
[24:23] full truth
[24:25] but one thing i want you to notice
[24:26] church they feared the lord god amen
[24:30] they fear jehovah elohim praise god
[24:33] and they thought the only way i'll be
[24:35] able to
[24:36] uh live is if i if i trick
[24:40] god's people so my life will be spared
[24:44] this god is so great we fear this god so
[24:46] much
[24:47] he they're destroying everyone all we
[24:50] can do is try to trick them
[24:52] and try to see if our lives can be
[24:53] spared
[24:55] and it worked let me tell you like this
[24:59] church
[25:00] anytime a soul wants to be spared it's
[25:02] going to work
[25:04] i'm going to say it again anytime a soul
[25:07] humbles themselves and repents
[25:10] it's going to work the thief on the
[25:13] cross was mocking jesus
[25:15] for a while but then the holy spirit
[25:16] came and he said i deserve this
[25:18] this man has done nothing wrong he said
[25:20] remember me
[25:21] praise god and god had mercy on him and
[25:24] said i'll remember you
[25:25] you'll be with me this day in paradise
[25:27] amen god remembers god will spare
[25:30] all those who come to him in mercy
[25:32] praise god amen
[25:35] judas didn't do that though judas went
[25:37] and hung himself
[25:39] he didn't come back humbly to christ and
[25:41] repent
[25:44] let me tell you god will accept anybody
[25:46] who comes asking for mercy
[25:52] this is exactly what he did our god is a
[25:55] gracious god
[25:56] we'll show you this i just got a few
[25:57] scriptures on that god is very gracious
[25:59] church
[26:00] verse 10 and all that he did to the two
[26:02] kings of the amorites that were beyond
[26:03] jordan
[26:04] to sion king of heshbon and to ah king
[26:07] of
[26:07] beishan which was at astra so these
[26:10] gibeonites are pretending oh we only
[26:12] know about
[26:13] things before jared they don't even
[26:15] bring up jericho
[26:16] so see they're very wily they're very
[26:18] deceptive uh they have a pretty good
[26:20] plan to trick somebody
[26:22] look church satan satan can trick us in
[26:24] many ways right
[26:27] he could trick us in many ways but
[26:28] sometimes it now i believe this wasn't
[26:30] satan i believe this was actually god's
[26:32] grace to them
[26:33] right but sometimes see god will let us
[26:37] make mistakes
[26:38] to show his mercy on us and other people
[26:42] and that's what this story really
[26:43] magnifies the grace of god
[26:45] so we learn now look here israel fails
[26:48] to seek god's counsel look at verse 14
[26:51] and the man took of their victuals and
[26:53] ask not counsel
[26:54] at the mouth of the lord now look church
[26:57] we learn from this
[26:58] we cannot trust what we see with our
[27:01] eyes
[27:04] praise god amen
[27:08] joshua saw moldy bread he saw tattered
[27:11] clothes
[27:12] all the princess look around what do you
[27:13] brothers think yeah
[27:15] let's forgive them let's spare their
[27:18] lives right
[27:21] but see they never thought we should
[27:23] pray should we pray about this
[27:26] and and and should we look past what we
[27:29] see
[27:30] and should we shall we ask god about
[27:31] this and they only trusted in what they
[27:34] saw
[27:34] church we did the same thing all the
[27:36] time we see something on our phone and
[27:38] we think oh that's going to happen
[27:40] right oh i know that's going to happen i
[27:42] see it i saw the effects of it
[27:44] instead of asking god god is there
[27:46] something i don't see
[27:48] is there something greater than this are
[27:50] you going to change the situation
[27:52] praise god amen now look proverbs says
[27:56] trust the lord with all thine heart
[27:58] lean not on their own understanding so
[27:59] in this case joshua
[28:01] leans on his own understanding it's the
[28:03] second time he's done that
[28:05] a church you read the rest of the book
[28:06] of joshua does god ever get done with
[28:08] joshua
[28:09] and throw him out to the dump and say
[28:10] i'm done with you you failed me twice
[28:14] i'll just get somebody else no because
[28:16] the word of god came to him said
[28:17] as i was with moses so shall i be with
[28:20] thee amen
[28:22] hallelujah hallelujah moses made mistake
[28:25] after mistake
[28:26] after mistake but god never forsook him
[28:29] god will never forsake us
[28:31] despite our mistakes because he loves us
[28:33] he called us we're his covenant people
[28:35] praise god
[28:37] he'll never leave us or forsake us
[28:38] hallelujah
[28:40] but it lets us know there's going to be
[28:42] times that we we learn
[28:44] we're not trusting in god like we ought
[28:46] to
[28:47] so it's a moment of repentance it's a
[28:50] moment of sanctification say god
[28:52] help me to pray next time before i do
[28:54] this because no doubt i'm going to meet
[28:56] more people in the future right no doubt
[28:58] we're gonna
[28:59] we're gonna be tested again god help me
[29:01] to pray next time
[29:02] instead of just accepting this simple
[29:04] answer
[29:06] see in all thy ways acknowledge him they
[29:08] didn't acknowledge god with the gibby
[29:09] knights
[29:11] they just saw the old moldy bread okay
[29:14] sorry
[29:14] we won't kill you and he shall direct
[29:18] thy past
[29:20] and now remember the bible said we walk
[29:22] by faith
[29:23] and not by sight we don't look at what
[29:26] we see praise god
[29:27] we look at what god says right we look
[29:30] at the revelation of god's word
[29:32] we look with spiritual eyes not with
[29:34] natural eyes
[29:38] so see these are great lessons you can
[29:40] learn
[29:42] see verse 14 says they plainly didn't
[29:44] ask for the lord's counsel just like at
[29:46] a.i
[29:47] we do the same thing now church this was
[29:49] an act of god's mercy
[29:50] blessed are the merciful jesus said for
[29:53] they shall obtain
[29:54] mercy let me ask you joshua's merciful
[29:58] to them do you think god was merciful to
[30:00] joshua
[30:01] yeah israel showed mercy to the gibby
[30:04] knight do you think god showed mercy to
[30:06] israel later
[30:07] oh yeah especially after joshua died god
[30:10] kept sending them
[30:11] judge after judge after judge
[30:14] after judge in other words god said god
[30:17] kept sending them
[30:18] deliverance after deliverance after
[30:20] deliverance other words god
[30:22] kept hearing their prayer god never
[30:24] rejected them god was faithful to them
[30:26] if you show mercy to somebody
[30:27] god will show mercy to you it's the law
[30:31] of god
[30:34] see jesus said blessed are the merciful
[30:36] for they shall obtain mercy
[30:39] church i i forget the number of years
[30:40] but i preached on that years ago
[30:41] remember remember
[30:42] when i preached through all the kings of
[30:43] israel remember that it was over in the
[30:44] other room
[30:47] i calculated and i forget the number of
[30:49] years i think it was like 200 or 300
[30:51] 300 extra years uh the southern kingdom
[30:55] judah existed longer than the northern
[30:57] kingdom
[30:58] the northern kingdom had no godly king
[31:00] they had ahab and a bunch of
[31:01] renegades but they were totally
[31:04] uh taken to captivity hundreds of years
[31:08] before judah because judah had god's
[31:10] mercy because they had some faithful
[31:12] kings there praise god
[31:14] they had josiah they had hezekiah amen
[31:17] they had some men of god they had asa
[31:19] they had some good kings and because
[31:21] they
[31:21] had good merciful kings god gave them
[31:23] longer time to dwell in the land
[31:26] until last zedekiah was a heathen
[31:29] basically for israel
[31:30] and they took judah out of the promised
[31:33] land as well nebuchadnezzar took him out
[31:36] so that's just one example if if if
[31:39] if you show mercy god is going to extend
[31:41] mercy for you
[31:42] praise god how many trust in god's mercy
[31:46] today
[31:47] i am i am certainly
[31:50] now here let's look at god's amazing
[31:52] mercy toward the giving nights
[31:56] now church all things work together for
[31:58] good even
[31:59] our mistakes it's like brother jose's
[32:01] testimony i thought just it
[32:02] went in perfectly when we make mistakes
[32:06] now this was a
[32:07] this was a mistake god made it work out
[32:10] for their
[32:10] for their good later on
[32:14] okay we'll get to that in a minute now
[32:16] church look god this also shows god is
[32:18] very merciful to sinners
[32:20] even at the very last moment remember
[32:23] that map
[32:24] remember that map of israel they just
[32:26] got done with ai what was next
[32:28] gibeon was next at the last moments
[32:31] before they're going to be
[32:32] destroyed god showed mercy to them
[32:37] praise god now look here's what i heard
[32:39] a preacher say too
[32:40] god could have revealed that deception
[32:42] to joshua
[32:45] but he didn't church how many times has
[32:49] god shown you things or given you a word
[32:50] from the lord to help you not to be
[32:52] deceived
[32:53] well many times or not to believe a lie
[32:56] or not to look at that or not to do that
[32:58] or not to go there not to say that
[33:00] how many times has god protected us in
[33:02] advance but this time
[33:03] god doesn't reveal to joshua the
[33:05] deception
[33:06] so it shows god was in it
[33:09] god was in it to save lives listen
[33:12] church
[33:13] if god saved all those egyptian lives in
[33:15] the days of joshua
[33:16] what about here pray i'm sorry days of
[33:18] joseph
[33:20] god sent one man joseph to save all
[33:22] those healing lives why
[33:24] because god is rich in mercy here it is
[33:26] god again
[33:28] sending sending these giving eyes to
[33:29] joshua to show mercy
[33:31] anybody that wants to be saved can be
[33:34] saved amen
[33:35] anybody that believes there's a way
[33:36] there's at least one hope to be saved
[33:39] god will save them amen hallelujah
[33:42] praise god there's such hope for
[33:43] salvation praise god
[33:46] and they're now listen they're under the
[33:48] judgment of god but they still seek
[33:50] mercy amen
[33:51] that's just like david when he sought
[33:53] mercy for that first child with him in
[33:54] bathsheba
[33:55] he sought mercy he thought well perhaps
[33:58] god will show grace
[33:59] see because he knew god was a god of
[34:01] grace
[34:03] that's how i want to be i'm going to
[34:04] want to ask for god's grace there's
[34:06] people i know that have called the
[34:08] pillar of fire picture brother ram
[34:09] they've called it the devil
[34:11] and they blast him the holy ghost
[34:13] brother jose i still pray for them
[34:14] sometimes
[34:16] because i don't know if they did it
[34:18] ignorantly or not
[34:20] remember you can blaspheme ignorantly
[34:22] and not know what you're doing
[34:25] okay let's read that that's first
[34:26] timothy chapter one people can blaspheme
[34:30] first timothy 1 13 and not even know
[34:33] what they're
[34:34] doing
[34:39] so for me i wait till i get a definite
[34:41] leading from the holy ghost
[34:42] not to pray for people because if there
[34:45] was mercy for the giving nights
[34:47] there's mercy for the egyptians just not
[34:50] that's just natural life right we don't
[34:51] even know if anyone got saved
[34:53] but just natural life god was showing
[34:55] mercy if there was mercy for all these
[34:57] individuals if there's mercy for saul of
[34:59] tarsus
[34:59] then let's seek mercy for others as well
[35:03] first timothy 1 13.
[35:08] actually let's read verse 12 because
[35:09] it's beautiful i thank christ jesus our
[35:11] lord
[35:11] who hath enabled me for he hath counted
[35:14] me faithful
[35:15] putting me into the ministry now look
[35:16] was he faithful before
[35:18] no he wasn't faithful before the
[35:20] conversion he's faithful after the
[35:21] conversion
[35:22] so god saw the future god saw he would
[35:25] be faithful so god saved him
[35:27] god saw you would be faithful to praise
[35:29] god he wasn't looking at your past life
[35:32] he's looking at what he knew you'd be if
[35:34] you had a chance at mercy
[35:38] when was paul faithful to jesus he
[35:40] wasn't faithful to jesus before his
[35:41] conversion he's faithful after
[35:45] when when he had a real run-in with
[35:47] christ
[35:48] see before he just blasted me in jesus
[35:50] he didn't he didn't really know it was
[35:51] wrong
[35:52] that's why he didn't i'm sorry he didn't
[35:54] know it was right forgive me he thought
[35:55] it was wrong
[35:56] he didn't know what was right but then
[35:57] when he met jesus face to face now
[35:58] that's different
[36:01] now he never blessed him after that
[36:03] hallelujah praise god
[36:05] he couldn't because he knew he was real
[36:07] he knew christ was the lord he said lord
[36:09] lord
[36:10] won't you have me who are you lord he
[36:12] said i'm jesus amen
[36:13] thank god that jesus came to you and
[36:15] said i'm jesus i'm the living savior
[36:17] i'm the living son of god serve me i'm
[36:20] real thank god he shows us how real he
[36:22] is amen
[36:24] from that moment when it became real you
[36:26] never speak against it again
[36:29] let me share this growing up in
[36:30] denominations i blaspheme the holy ghost
[36:33] all the time and i hate to say that but
[36:34] i've shared it before my brothers and i
[36:36] would laugh at the tongue speakers
[36:39] we would laugh and we'd knock and make
[36:41] fun but church
[36:42] it never fell on me so i was ignorant i
[36:45] didn't know what i was doing
[36:47] once the holy ghost fell on me that's a
[36:49] whole different thing praise god
[36:54] and this is and this is the scripture
[36:55] that i hang my soul on if god forgave
[36:58] paul who blasphemed christ and caused
[37:02] many others to blast him if god for he
[37:05] forgave
[37:06] him and gave him a ministry and saw his
[37:09] future faithfulness
[37:10] then god can give me a ministry and see
[37:12] my future faithfulness
[37:15] amen church we have to find ourselves in
[37:18] the bible
[37:18] thank god that we have all these stories
[37:21] because in one of those stories
[37:22] is your story that's why i love paul i
[37:26] feel like he's well he's just like my
[37:27] story
[37:28] cam too you know we're so thankful verse
[37:31] 13
[37:32] who was before a blasphemer
[37:36] paul said god counted me faithful yet
[37:38] before i was a blasphemer
[37:43] and a persecutor and injurist and i
[37:45] obtained mercy because i did it
[37:46] ignorantly in unbelief
[37:47] and i've prayed this many times for the
[37:49] mj i'd say lord jesus forgive me for
[37:51] making fun of those tongues
[37:52] interpretation people
[37:54] i said forgive me i did it ignorantly i
[37:56] didn't know what i was doing
[37:57] how i long though for tongues
[37:59] interpretations today
[38:01] how how i pray for that how i pray for
[38:03] miracles now praise god
[38:05] i pray for words of wisdom and words of
[38:07] knowledge amen
[38:09] i always pray lord let them be done in
[38:11] the name of thy holy child jesus amen
[38:15] see now i see now i can tell that it was
[38:18] ignorantly
[38:18] because before i laughed at it now i
[38:20] crave it amen
[38:22] now ask god for more of it give us more
[38:24] of your grace
[38:25] more of your understanding more of your
[38:26] anointing praise god
[38:30] same thing as paul he hated it before
[38:33] blasphemed it now he loves it now he
[38:36] teaches everybody about it
[38:37] oh thank god for grace
[38:41] hallelujah see it all depends if you do
[38:44] it ignorantly or not
[38:48] let's go to okay go to acts 8 3 acts 8
[38:51] 3.
[38:52] let's look at some of the things paul
[38:53] did before
[38:58] this was really uh just eye opening and
[39:00] kind of refreshing to me i
[39:02] i finished the book of acts a while back
[39:03] a couple months ago and
[39:05] i was just amazed at all that god had
[39:08] forgiven saul for
[39:10] acts eight
[39:13] but if you look at verse one he was
[39:14] consenting unto his death
[39:16] stephen's and at that time there was
[39:18] great persecution against the church now
[39:19] verse three
[39:20] and saw he made a havoc of the church
[39:22] entering into every house inhaling men
[39:24] and women
[39:25] committing them to prison this guy
[39:28] wasn't some
[39:28] internet troll like we fight today right
[39:31] brother
[39:33] like i get youtube trolls like they're
[39:35] just rebuking me name call me
[39:37] this this guy wasn't one of those he was
[39:38] one of those that would break down your
[39:40] door and say let me come in you're going
[39:42] to prison
[39:43] all right that's kind of that's the kind
[39:45] of man this was
[39:47] he wasn't a little zealous he was
[39:49] extremely zealous
[39:51] hatred against all christians he would
[39:55] break down your door brother mj and drag
[39:57] you off to prison
[39:58] right he would he would break down my
[40:00] door and drag my family and all of us
[40:02] to prison in chains because he had a and
[40:05] he
[40:05] he'd have the the law right there he
[40:07] said i've got the written law right here
[40:09] you're guilty you're going to jail he'd
[40:12] break down
[40:12] doors the bible says he made havoc of
[40:16] the church
[40:19] threw him in prison uh go to chapter
[40:23] 22 verse 4 22 4.
[40:31] acts 22 verse 4. and i persecuted this
[40:33] way unto the death
[40:35] binding and delivering into prisons both
[40:37] men and women
[40:38] death i persecute this way
[40:42] unto death in other words like stephen
[40:44] he wanted to see christians die
[40:48] he wanted to see them killed
[40:52] and he saw steven there he held their
[40:53] look at that he held their coats
[40:55] while they stoned him with stones
[40:57] imagine had a big smile on his face
[41:01] he really deserves that that idolater
[41:03] that that blasphemer
[41:05] if the whole time he was the one guilty
[41:07] of blasphemy
[41:09] right church look at verse 5 22 5.
[41:13] also the high priest doth bear me
[41:15] witness that with all the estate of the
[41:17] elders from whom i
[41:18] receive letters in damascus and went to
[41:20] damascus to bring them which were bound
[41:22] unto jerusalem for to be punished so he
[41:25] knew they were going to get
[41:26] beat in the prisons and he was all for
[41:29] it
[41:29] yeah beat them up kick them knock out
[41:31] their teeth
[41:33] bruise them because they're blossoming
[41:35] jehovah
[41:39] look at verse 19.
[41:43] see and he and he basically takes credit
[41:45] for beating them we don't know if
[41:46] paul actually did beat up christians but
[41:48] he takes credit at least because he took
[41:50] them to prison where they would be
[41:52] beaten
[41:53] look at verse 19. and i said lord they
[41:55] know that i'm imprisoned and beat i
[41:57] imprisoned and i beat
[41:59] in every synagogue them that believed on
[42:02] these so he went to every church of that
[42:04] day
[42:05] and and found all the christians took
[42:07] them to jail made sure they were at
[42:08] least beaten
[42:15] chapter 26 verse 10.
[42:21] and in all this church god behind all
[42:24] that anger all that hatred god saw a
[42:26] faithful prophet
[42:29] god saw a man who'd be faithful to
[42:31] preaching and he'd cross the seas to
[42:33] praise amen
[42:34] he'd suffer through shipwrecked and
[42:37] beaten
[42:38] god saw in him he's a faithful man he's
[42:40] just misguided right now by the devil
[42:42] wait till the light of god wait till i
[42:44] shine the light of god wait till i open
[42:46] his eyes
[42:47] he's going to be a real faithful man of
[42:49] god but right now he was a
[42:51] blasphemer idolatrous yes beat him up
[42:54] yes stone him
[42:55] kill them take them to prison those
[42:57] bunch of blasphemy christians
[43:00] verse 10 26 10 and 11. which thing i did
[43:03] in jerusalem and many of the saints that
[43:05] i shut up in prison
[43:06] so it wasn't a couple people he put in
[43:08] prison many
[43:11] many people
[43:15] having received authority from the chief
[43:16] priests and when they were put to death
[43:18] they look at that day i gave my voice
[43:20] against them they sure so they look
[43:22] paul was responsible for more than
[43:24] stephen did you catch that
[43:26] they they were put to death it wasn't
[43:28] just stephen it was numerous people
[43:30] died because of paul and look how god
[43:34] look how merciful god is the very one
[43:37] killing them
[43:38] right when those martyrs died they got a
[43:41] martyr's crown
[43:43] and then when paul gets converted he
[43:45] saves and preaches and then he dies as a
[43:47] martyr gets the same crown as the other
[43:49] ones
[43:51] they both get a martyr's crown the one
[43:53] paul had killed the one spot the many
[43:55] paw
[43:56] had imprisoned and killed that were
[43:57] killed they got martyr's crown and jesus
[44:00] changes his heart shows him his
[44:02] blasphemy he doesn't blast him again
[44:04] and then he's willing to give his life
[44:06] and he gets a martyr's crown as well
[44:12] that's a god of grace that we serve
[44:14] church
[44:16] that's the god of grace that we serve
[44:20] so i know even though i blasphemed and
[44:22] made fun of gifts of the holy ghost when
[44:23] i was younger i know god's forgiven me
[44:25] because i look at my life now and now
[44:28] i'm trying to get people to
[44:29] get to know their gifts right i want all
[44:32] of you to know your gifts
[44:33] i want you to manifest all the gifts in
[44:35] your life amen
[44:36] hallelujah
[44:40] so we can see church we can see god's
[44:41] mercy in here now look god could have
[44:44] re revealed it to joshua but he did it
[44:46] god exalts his grace above all our
[44:49] mistakes
[44:50] so which is greater paul's murder and
[44:52] beating in imprisonments or is jesus's
[44:54] grace greater
[44:56] his grace is much greater
[45:00] now look church good can always come out
[45:03] of our mistakes
[45:06] right think of any mistake you made
[45:09] if you look at it long enough you're
[45:11] gonna see ah
[45:13] like one time i i told this i made a
[45:15] mistake with sister lady i told her
[45:17] yeah it's okay for you to move to iraq
[45:19] uh or saudi arabia and you can still
[45:21] live stream our services that was a big
[45:23] mistake
[45:25] because she had no fellowship over there
[45:26] and she eventually fell away and i've
[45:28] admitted that publicly that's a big
[45:29] mistake i made
[45:30] but now i've learned i've never
[45:32] counseled anybody since then
[45:34] to ever go to any place without a home
[45:36] church because the home church is where
[45:38] the presence of god
[45:39] the living fountains of living waters
[45:42] are flowing out and you and i
[45:43] must feed our souls and drink of the
[45:45] living waters constantly
[45:48] hallelujah i've learned from that
[45:50] mistake
[45:51] and i've always told people now don't go
[45:53] anywhere unless you've got a home church
[45:54] with believers
[45:56] because this is the body of christ and
[45:58] you need to stay around the body of
[46:00] christ because they're going to
[46:01] strengthen you
[46:01] and you're going to strengthen them you
[46:04] need the body of christ
[46:06] so that's one thing i can learn from my
[46:09] mistake
[46:10] but what about moses
[46:13] moses made the mistake of killing a man
[46:15] i imagine he just like took his fists
[46:17] and
[46:17] punched him in the the throat or
[46:19] something or knocked him
[46:20] the man dies he buries him in sand
[46:25] now he's a murderer accident you know
[46:27] maybe accidentally murdered him
[46:29] the next day he tries to stand up he
[46:31] said we know what you've done
[46:32] he runs for his life so moses's murder
[46:35] caused him to run away from the very
[46:37] people he's going to save
[46:39] but in that 40 years of testing and
[46:42] trying
[46:43] god used it to help him god beat out all
[46:46] the egyptian nonsense out of his mind
[46:48] and it just became the mindset of a
[46:50] shepherd
[46:52] just take care of sheep just be cheap
[46:54] just protect sheep
[46:56] god had to get rid of all the education
[46:58] and give him give him sheep mentality
[46:59] praise god
[47:01] and then god gave him a beautiful wife
[47:03] support who would later save his life
[47:08] when he made another mistake god bless
[47:11] him with the wife
[47:12] and god bless him with the father-in-law
[47:14] who told him moses you're taking too
[47:15] much on yourself
[47:17] he said god will take that same holy
[47:18] ghost on you and give it to 70 other men
[47:21] amen so you can rest praise god look at
[47:24] all the blessings
[47:25] and then he and then he gave him the
[47:26] greatest blessing of the pillar of fire
[47:29] the burning mesh experience he learned
[47:31] more about god in five minutes
[47:33] than 80 years before in his entire life
[47:35] because god was now speaking to i
[47:38] am that i am who are you lord i'm jesus
[47:40] amen
[47:43] praise god so even in his murder even in
[47:46] his
[47:46] his fleeing away from his country as a
[47:48] fugitive
[47:49] god had mercy on and god worked it out
[47:52] for his good
[47:54] amen church god will work out your
[47:57] mistakes for good
[47:59] just wait on him just be patient just
[48:01] love him and serve him
[48:02] just humble yourself amen and trust
[48:06] god he got the greatest experience of
[48:09] his life
[48:10] 40 years after being a murderer so don't
[48:13] give up on god church
[48:16] and then god gave him the greatest third
[48:18] of his life the greatest 40 years after
[48:20] the worst
[48:21] first 80 years of his life god gave the
[48:25] god gave him such power for the amen
[48:26] that egypt is like we're done we don't
[48:28] know what to do with this guy
[48:29] this guy lives so close to god i'm
[48:31] throwing out the book i don't know how
[48:32] to deal with this guy
[48:33] get out of here and that's how we can be
[48:36] we can live so close to god
[48:38] satan doesn't know what to do with us
[48:39] because the blessing of god is upon us
[48:41] amen
[48:43] everything we touch can be blessed if we
[48:46] humble ourselves and obey the word
[48:48] of god he won't know what to do with us
[48:54] see god is the great redeemer of
[48:57] mistakes
[48:59] joshua made a mistake no problem god
[49:02] wasn't up there said you
[49:03] you loser you're such a failure god's
[49:06] like i knew it was going to happen
[49:08] i'm going to bless you anyway that's
[49:11] what he did
[49:13] god because god loves his children just
[49:15] like you love your children brother man
[49:18] we love our children so god loves you
[49:20] and god loves us more amen
[49:23] we get tired of our children sometimes
[49:25] or we get impatient with them
[49:27] god doesn't get impatient with us god's
[49:30] love is rich it's divine patience
[49:32] it's long suffering it's merciful loving
[49:34] patience from almighty god
[49:37] amen god god don't get tired of your
[49:40] prayers god loves your prayers
[49:42] he's just waiting well i've let brother
[49:44] jesse make this mistake i can't wait
[49:46] till he comes back i know he's going to
[49:47] come back to me and pray
[49:48] i'm just waiting on him there's no
[49:50] condemnation of jesse he's in christ
[49:52] jesus
[49:53] i'm just waiting for his prayer
[49:54] repentance any any time now
[49:56] anytime right that's how it is with
[49:59] youtube
[50:00] he's not i'm going to get i finally can
[50:02] get rid of this guy and get somebody
[50:03] else in here to get this
[50:04] loser out of here that's not what he was
[50:06] like he's like he's my son
[50:08] he's purchased by the blood he just
[50:10] needs some time to learn a lesson
[50:12] i'm teaching him i'm training any child
[50:14] that doesn't get trained by me is a
[50:15] bastard child
[50:17] he's a real child of god he's dealing
[50:19] with his mistakes he's repenting
[50:20] he's learning he's just like me praise
[50:22] god
[50:24] he's taking my character he's learning
[50:27] how to live like i do
[50:29] he's learning to have the mind of christ
[50:32] instead of the mind
[50:33] of an american can i say like that i
[50:36] don't want the mind of an american i
[50:38] want the mind of christ
[50:45] and david david made the awful mistake
[50:49] of his life
[50:51] he saw a beautiful woman i don't know
[50:52] why she was bathing out there she should
[50:54] not have been bathing on a porch
[50:56] but anyways he took her lay with her
[51:00] sent her back and brought her husband
[51:02] and killed him
[51:03] tried to cover it up all these things
[51:06] yet there still came blessings out of
[51:07] his life
[51:09] now don't get me wrong church the
[51:10] consequence remained he had the sword in
[51:12] his house the rest of his life
[51:15] but out of solomon praise god came the
[51:19] greatest
[51:19] time of israel's history oh my goodness
[51:23] the greatest time because the bible said
[51:26] they had peace
[51:27] all those years it was the august time
[51:31] it was the golden age of israel
[51:34] whereas the grandest temple most
[51:36] beautiful building ever built
[51:38] gold-plated people came from all around
[51:41] the world to see
[51:43] who is this god the queen of sheba came
[51:45] to say is this real or not and god said
[51:47] this is real
[51:48] and your testimony will work on the day
[51:50] of judgment because you came to hear
[51:52] a one like solomon but jesus said a
[51:55] greater than solomon is here praise god
[51:57] in other words god brought the golden
[51:59] age of israel through david's mistake
[52:02] god had mercy
[52:03] on him and his seed
[52:06] remember bathsheba had four sons church
[52:10] salmon was just one of them he was
[52:11] called jedi he was called beloved
[52:15] god loved a child that came from a
[52:18] couple that committed adultery
[52:21] god did grace
[52:24] brother program labor's on it in the
[52:26] message of grace 1961
[52:28] that's the message that has that
[52:30] prophecy about the rapture
[52:32] and about the squeeze that's right
[52:37] so look at that look how amazing god's
[52:39] grace is
[52:40] and then god blesses solomon and he he
[52:43] becomes the type of the millennium
[52:46] no wars everybody's in order
[52:50] all nations look to israel nobody was
[52:53] ever as rich nobody's ever is wise
[52:55] no one is ever as prosperous as solomon
[52:57] no one will ever be as
[52:58] prosperous as jesus christ in the
[53:00] millennium
[53:02] hallelujah and then
[53:05] out of the other three sons nathan was
[53:07] one of them
[53:08] and out of nathan come the very lineage
[53:11] of jesus christ
[53:12] jesus didn't come out of solomon's
[53:14] lineage jesus came out of nathan's
[53:16] lineage
[53:17] so out of bathsheba this adulteress
[53:19] whose husband was murdered
[53:21] out of here comes the greatest age of
[53:23] israel's history
[53:25] and also out of here comes uh the
[53:28] lineage of god's
[53:29] uh god's son jesus christ made of a
[53:31] woman
[53:33] emmanuel comes out of her as well
[53:37] the church don't be discouraging your
[53:39] mistakes and do not let satan
[53:41] beat you down for your mistakes you
[53:44] confess your mistakes
[53:45] and move on to the next battle
[53:49] that's what joshua did praise god he had
[53:51] one little mistake and he made it right
[53:53] they got the sin out of the camp
[53:54] they moved on to the next battle because
[53:56] there's more work to be done in church
[53:58] there's more work to be done we must
[54:00] carry on amen
[54:02] for the good of the lord and the thrill
[54:04] of his glory amen
[54:05] amen we must carry on there's work to be
[54:08] done
[54:09] we don't want to be stopped in one place
[54:11] we want to press all
[54:12] towards the mark of the high court in
[54:15] christ jesus he forgives you
[54:17] he loves you that's why he died for you
[54:19] amen
[54:20] hallelujah that's why he rose
[54:23] to prove that he pondered your sin it
[54:25] wasn't his sin
[54:26] that he died for it was your sin and
[54:29] that's why i rose
[54:30] to defeat your sin amen
[54:35] i can't be condemned for my sin anymore
[54:37] because christ
[54:38] already took the condemnation
[54:43] the price has been paid
[54:47] it is finished
[54:53] satan the case against this church
[54:56] it is finished jesus is bread
[55:00] paid the price it is no longer up for
[55:03] debate
[55:04] jesus christ paid the price the ransom
[55:06] and paid
[55:07] we are free
[55:12] and it's independence day
[55:17] i'm free from my sins i'm free from my
[55:20] slavery so are you
[55:22] we're all free from our slavery through
[55:25] the name of jesus christ i'm free from
[55:26] my blasphemy
[55:28] i'm free i won't be a slave to i don't
[55:31] even remember those things hardly unless
[55:33] one of these scriptures comes across and
[55:34] reminds me but i appreciate that
[55:38] i'm living such a different life now i
[55:40] don't even remember what it's like to be
[55:41] a sinner many times
[55:43] every now and then i get a little
[55:44] temptation you know what i mean but as a
[55:46] christian you live such a new life
[55:49] you're such a new creation in christ
[55:52] that's the only thing that avails amen
[55:54] that's the only thing that will prevail
[55:56] against satan's temptation is a new life
[55:58] we must live new
[56:00] we must live like we're brand new
[56:03] start each day like you're brand new
[56:06] start it new i got a fresh start today i
[56:09] confessed my sin yesterday
[56:11] i got a fresh start i'm his beloved
[56:15] the bible says you're beloved right the
[56:17] bible says we are
[56:18] his beloved just like solomon just like
[56:21] daniel
[56:24] hallelujah thank god
[56:29] good always comes out of your mistakes
[56:32] like like my uncle told me he said jesse
[56:35] the reason your dad left you
[56:36] is because you would never leave your
[56:38] eight children
[56:40] i said that's exactly right
[56:43] had to know what it was like to be left
[56:46] that feeling
[56:47] in order to motivate me to never leave
[56:49] my responsibilities
[56:51] praise god and i wouldn't change a thing
[56:53] about it
[56:55] now i mean it'd be nice if i could but i
[56:56] can't in other words god has to give
[56:59] free will to everybody
[57:00] but because my dad left six of us i'll
[57:02] never leave all eight of mine
[57:05] right because all things work together
[57:08] for good
[57:09] like i was telling the church i said
[57:10] when my dad left i got three more
[57:12] simon came and said him
[57:15] my dad left god gave me three more i
[57:17] didn't know yeah
[57:18] that's how i looked at it right that's
[57:20] how i look at it now
[57:21] that they they they basically went with
[57:24] me to football they went with me to
[57:25] basketball they wanted me to track they
[57:26] were just there all the time anytime i
[57:28] need something sam can i borrow the car
[57:29] cam can i borrow the car that's how i
[57:30] got saved
[57:32] listen to his christian music you know
[57:34] see my dad wasn't
[57:35] he his free will wasn't to save me so
[57:37] god used cam
[57:39] my other dad amen see all things work
[57:42] together for good
[57:44] to them that love the lord i believe it
[57:46] you should believe it we should thank
[57:47] god for it
[57:49] amen so don't let satan discourage about
[57:53] your mistakes or
[57:54] things that happen learn from it move on
[57:57] find the good out of it and if you don't
[57:59] know
[57:59] live live forward and know that god is
[58:02] going to bring something good out of it
[58:04] amen because we're all going to make
[58:06] mistakes even joshua
[58:08] jehovah's our salvation even joshua made
[58:11] mistakes
[58:12] and we've seen two of them playing me
[58:14] right here well i can just defeat ai i
[58:17] don't need to ask the lord how to defeat
[58:18] this enemy
[58:19] they lost 36 lives because aiken sin
[58:24] here's another one another mistake he
[58:25] didn't consult the lord
[58:27] now this one god worked out really for
[58:29] good there's no judgment aiken got
[58:31] judged now
[58:32] this worked out beautifully let me try
[58:34] to close okay
[58:35] what was that yeah i'm almost at the
[58:37] hour here so when i say that that means
[58:39] i got 15 minutes okay so i got 15
[58:40] minutes here
[58:41] i think i said that wednesday that's my
[58:44] new thing when i say i'm going to close
[58:45] that means 15 minutes
[58:46] okay ah all things work together for
[58:49] good now look look what micah says
[58:51] who is a god like unto thee
[58:54] that pardons iniquity see you knew you
[58:57] knew
[58:58] see don't let the devil tell you well
[58:59] you knew not to do it well of course you
[59:01] knew not to
[59:02] that's because you're wise under the
[59:03] word of god but god still
[59:06] pardons your iniquity and the church
[59:08] said
[59:10] hey i i came iniquities too i think
[59:12] things i shouldn't think i say things i
[59:13] shouldn't say
[59:14] i work in it sometimes i work iniquity
[59:16] but god pardons it by the blood
[59:19] amen we all do things we know we
[59:23] shouldn't do
[59:24] when was the last time you didn't do you
[59:26] did something where brother jesse never
[59:27] preached on that i didn't know i should
[59:28] not have done that
[59:29] what was the last time that happened
[59:31] come on tell me after church if that's
[59:32] happened lately
[59:34] when was the last time you sinned and
[59:35] you didn't know you should not have done
[59:36] it
[59:38] see most of us when we come to the
[59:39] message this bible becomes a brand new
[59:40] bible
[59:41] and the holy ghost lives right here
[59:43] church and you make a mistake he's going
[59:45] to let you know right away

[1:00:20] transgression of the remnant of his
[1:00:22] heritage
[1:00:24] god sees your sin he just passes by that
[1:00:26] okay that's right

[1:00:33] there i'm gonna go ahead and bypass that
[1:00:34] as well he said sorry glory
[1:00:38] you know why he doesn't retain his anger
[1:00:40] forever
[1:00:41] because he loves he delights to show
[1:00:44] mercy

[1:01:02] kids out to eat fast food
[1:01:05] or give them ice cream now i don't do it
[1:01:07] too much for the vanguards i'm gonna get
[1:01:08] in trouble
[1:01:11] but i delight in showing mercy there's
[1:01:13] many times i could have spanked my
[1:01:14] children maybe i didn't
[1:01:17] because i delight in mercy if i saw them
[1:01:20] crying and repenting enough there's only
[1:01:22] certain times i would use that the the
[1:01:23] the rods you know we should i have used
[1:01:25] on all of them
[1:01:27] if i don't i use my hand something like
[1:01:29] that i use something like that
[1:01:31] they got to have a church they got to
[1:01:32] have it but there's times i've delighted
[1:01:34] in showing mercy
[1:01:36] to them because i'm their father
[1:01:39] i want them to love me i want them to be
[1:01:41] correct too but i
[1:01:43] i delight many times in showing mercy
[1:01:46] oh you children you didn't get a chance
[1:01:48] to wash dishes that's okay i'll wash
[1:01:49] dishes for you
[1:01:50] i delight in showing mercy i'm not going
[1:01:52] to make you stay up later i'm going to
[1:01:53] let you go to bed remember that lydia
[1:01:55] unless you go to bed i'm going to stay
[1:01:57] up i'll wash dishes for you
[1:02:00] well then i get to save and listen to
[1:02:01] brother brown a little more you know
[1:02:06] like that i delight in showing mercy
[1:02:10] oh malcolm you forgot to take out the
[1:02:11] trash that's okay i got it buddy
[1:02:13] i delight to show mercy i won't punish
[1:02:15] you for that
[1:02:17] right which father here
[1:02:20] doesn't delight in showing mercy
[1:02:24] church micah says he'll turn again he'll
[1:02:27] have compassion on us
[1:02:28] see church even if you feel like god has
[1:02:30] turned his face toward you and he don't
[1:02:32] want nothing with you
[1:02:33] he will turn again and say come back
[1:02:36] i'm just turning my back for a season
[1:02:37] you've offended me but when you seek me
[1:02:40] you'll find me when you seek me with all
[1:02:41] your heart
[1:02:43] he'll turn back to you the bible says so
[1:02:46] he'll have compassion on us
[1:02:47] he'll subdue ah like that amen
[1:02:50] god will help you get victory over your
[1:02:52] addictions or your iniquity
[1:02:54] god will so do it god will take down the
[1:02:56] temptations god will separate you
[1:02:58] from those temptations because he's
[1:03:00] merciful amen he knows you don't want to
[1:03:02] do it
[1:03:02] he knows it hurts you and grieves you so
[1:03:05] god will subdue your iniquities
[1:03:08] he'll take that temptation away out of
[1:03:10] your life
[1:03:13] so you don't have to deal with it every
[1:03:14] day
[1:03:17] and that will cast all their sins into
[1:03:20] the depths of the sea
[1:03:22] see we picture like god's got all this
[1:03:23] list of sins backed up there by the
[1:03:25] throne of god satan's like
[1:03:26] yeah he did this this is she did that to
[1:03:28] that god like takes him
[1:03:30] and he walks over to the cliff and he
[1:03:32] throws them over there
[1:03:33] and they go never to be heard from again
[1:03:38] right that's our god and that's old
[1:03:41] testament church that's before the blood
[1:03:43] of christ came
[1:03:44] what will the blood of christ do now
[1:03:46] praise god amen
[1:03:48] i would say this it's greater because
[1:03:51] the blood of jesus christ
[1:03:52] speaks greater things than that of the
[1:03:54] abel amen
[1:03:56] grace the blood of christ speaks better
[1:03:59] than the blood of animal sacrifices
[1:04:01] that just cleanse the flesh this blood
[1:04:04] cleanses our minds
[1:04:05] this blood washes our soul
[1:04:08] hallelujah that's the god i serve
[1:04:13] that's the god you serve
[1:04:18] he said we refuse to obey nehemiah
[1:04:20] neither we're mindful thy wonders that
[1:04:22] thou dis among them
[1:04:23] harden our necks rebellion we appointed
[1:04:26] captain return to their bondage
[1:04:27] but thou are to god ready i love the
[1:04:30] scripture

[1:04:34] pardon
[1:04:34] the question is are you ready to say
[1:04:36] you're sorry
[1:04:38] because whenever you're i know yeah
[1:04:40] whenever you're ready to say sorry
[1:04:42] he's ready to accept it right
[1:04:45] he's ready he's sitting he's sitting
[1:04:46] there just waiting i wonder when he's

[1:05:00] blessings of god back on your life i'm
[1:05:01] ready to do it i delight in showing you
[1:05:03] mercy
[1:05:04] i delight in taking your load of sin and
[1:05:07] tossing it over the edge
[1:05:09] and watching it just sink into the abyss
[1:05:14] the abyss of god's forgetfulness praise
[1:05:16] god
[1:05:17] i delight in that i delight in
[1:05:21] clearing all the accounts
[1:05:25] and saying like that song says what sin
[1:05:27] what sin
[1:05:28] that's a good song we haven't seen that
[1:05:30] one for a while
[1:05:32] it was forgiven the very moment you
[1:05:34] confessed
[1:05:36] buried in the sea of forgetfulness i
[1:05:38] don't have the words exactly right but
[1:05:40] you show me if i know what i'm talking
[1:05:41] about
[1:05:42] what's in what's in it was gone the very
[1:05:45] minute
[1:05:46] you confess
[1:05:49] what's in what's in
[1:05:54] buried in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:05:58] what's it see we let satan convince us
[1:06:01] like we have all these things
[1:06:02] church as soon as you say sorry god's
[1:06:04] like what's in
[1:06:08] yeah what are you so sorry about it's
[1:06:10] already confessed
[1:06:11] you did this lat you did that last week
[1:06:13] i took care of that last week
[1:06:16] that was in your childhood you confess
[1:06:19] it i took care of that a long time ago
[1:06:21] what sin you talking about i'm i delight
[1:06:24] in mercy
[1:06:26] i'm ready to pardon i will return to you
[1:06:30] when you return to me
[1:06:36] let's finish the chapter
[1:06:39] israel heard the gibbonites lied but
[1:06:42] then
[1:06:44] but let them live because they swore by
[1:06:46] the name of jehovah
[1:06:47] elohim the self-existent one who reveals
[1:06:51] himself the strong one
[1:06:53] that's jehovah elohim the israeli
[1:06:55] congregation murmured against the
[1:06:56] leadership right sometimes that happens
[1:06:59] the prince's though assigned the
[1:07:00] gibeonites to be huwers of wood and
[1:07:02] jawlers of water
[1:07:04] unto all the congregation look at this
[1:07:06] amazing grace
[1:07:09] these are gentile hivite
[1:07:12] heathens that throw themself at the
[1:07:15] mercy of god
[1:07:17] and they say we just don't want to die
[1:07:20] whatever you choose to be
[1:07:22] whatever you choose to do with us that's
[1:07:23] fine just let us live in other words all
[1:07:25] i want is eternal life
[1:07:26] whatever you're calling me to do i'll do
[1:07:28] it i just don't want to go to hell
[1:07:31] right that's exactly what it is that's
[1:07:33] the type
[1:07:35] and so joshua says you know what we're
[1:07:37] going to make you guys
[1:07:38] huge of wood cutters of wood and
[1:07:41] carriers of water
[1:07:44] for the house of the lord
[1:07:48] in other words he doesn't send them away
[1:07:50] to the very uttermost parts of the
[1:07:52] of the kingdom i don't want you anywhere
[1:07:54] close
[1:07:55] because these men wanted mercy because
[1:07:58] they feared the name of the lord jesus
[1:08:00] christ amen
[1:08:01] a brief are they because they had fear
[1:08:03] respect for the name of the lord jesus
[1:08:05] christ he said you can't be in our
[1:08:07] priesthood
[1:08:08] but you will minister to our priesthood
[1:08:12] because you sought mercy from me i will
[1:08:14] bring you close you can't get as close
[1:08:16] as those
[1:08:17] wise virgins now
[1:08:21] you won't be in the priesthood because
[1:08:23] church we are kings
[1:08:24] and priests unto god
[1:08:27] by the baptism of the holy ghost you
[1:08:29] can't be a king and a priest but you
[1:08:31] sure
[1:08:31] can help out the priesthood you can
[1:08:35] chop our wood and pack our water
[1:08:39] and while they were doing that they said
[1:08:41] i'm i'm chopping wood for royalty
[1:08:45] i'm pulling up water for royalty
[1:08:48] i'm serving the royal priesthood
[1:08:51] i'm serving the seed of abraham thank
[1:08:54] god
[1:08:55] god didn't put me to the uttermost parts
[1:08:57] of the kingdom he didn't forget about me
[1:08:59] he let me serve his faithful wise
[1:09:02] servants on the earth
[1:09:04] he let me serve the invincible army
[1:09:09] he let me have a part in helping out
[1:09:12] this invincible army on the earth
[1:09:14] all because i threw myself at the mercy
[1:09:16] god said god just i don't want to die
[1:09:18] i don't want to go to hell just have
[1:09:20] mercy on me and god
[1:09:21] saves them and says i'm going to make
[1:09:24] you
[1:09:25] woodcutters and water packers
[1:09:29] for my invincible army
[1:09:34] now in closing i got four minutes
[1:09:39] look verse 24 says they lied because
[1:09:41] they fear the lord
[1:09:42] they fear judgment they're not the
[1:09:45] priesthood but serve the priests
[1:09:48] joshua cursed them to a life of service
[1:09:54] right but they were happy with life
[1:09:57] rather than death
[1:10:02] they were cursed in their natural work
[1:10:04] but they were blessed to live and serve
[1:10:06] god's house
[1:10:07] remember what david said i heard a
[1:10:08] preacher say this david said
[1:10:10] i'd rather be the doorkeeper
[1:10:14] at the house of god i rather open the
[1:10:16] door than to dwell
[1:10:18] in the tents of the sinners
[1:10:21] hallelujah david said it's a blessing
[1:10:24] just to be near the house of god
[1:10:26] and god takes these gentile healings and
[1:10:28] because they want mercy
[1:10:30] god said i'm going to make you wood
[1:10:32] providers water providers
[1:10:33] so my house can perform the sacrifices
[1:10:37] you will help my house carry on i'm
[1:10:39] bringing you close to the house of god
[1:10:43] i'm bringing you close to my house in
[1:10:46] other words i'm not going to forget
[1:10:47] about you brother amen right
[1:10:49] bro jesse i'm not going to forget about
[1:10:50] you now we don't believe we're forgiving
[1:10:52] a nice type
[1:10:53] but the point is god is not going to
[1:10:55] forget about anyone who desires his
[1:10:57] mercy
[1:11:00] church he saves to the uttermost let's
[1:11:03] say uttermost ready
[1:11:06] he saves you would think the gimme
[1:11:08] knights will be hivites
[1:11:09] oh there's no way they can be saved god
[1:11:11] is rich in mercy
[1:11:12] he's able to save when we think people
[1:11:15] can't be saved
[1:11:16] because he saves to the uttermost he
[1:11:18] goes beyond our thoughts
[1:11:19] his ways are greater than our ways his
[1:11:22] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[1:11:29] god puts them close to the place where
[1:11:31] he would put his name
[1:11:34] now i don't have time church but there's
[1:11:36] so many scriptures in deuteronomy 29
[1:11:38] god says i'm going to bring you into
[1:11:40] covenant he said even the wood choppers
[1:11:43] and the water carriers are part of my
[1:11:45] covenant
[1:11:47] now church god knew the gibeonites would
[1:11:49] do this when he spoke that to moses
[1:11:51] so in other words he was basically
[1:11:52] saying i'm going to bring these heathens
[1:11:54] i'm going to bring these gentiles
[1:11:56] into the covenant they're going to have
[1:11:58] the lowest office they have the hardest
[1:12:00] work
[1:12:00] but at least they're a part of the
[1:12:02] covenant at least they didn't have to
[1:12:04] die
[1:12:04] at least they can have mercy and i'm
[1:12:06] going to bring them close
[1:12:08] to my house they're going to serve my
[1:12:09] purpose they're going to bless my
[1:12:11] priesthood amen
[1:12:13] oh my god thank you jesus amen
[1:12:16] he knew you'd be a faithful servant amen
[1:12:18] he knew you'd be faithful with little
[1:12:20] he'll make you certain or leader or much
[1:12:22] praise god
[1:12:24] if you're faithful in the little that
[1:12:25] god gives you
[1:12:31] the man talks about the foolish version
[1:12:32] so i'm saying the giving knights are
[1:12:34] foolish virgin you know why
[1:12:39] there are god what does he say he said
[1:12:40] there are god
[1:12:42] i thought he said there are god-fearing
[1:12:44] people in here it must be a different
[1:12:45] quote he said god loving people
[1:12:47] they were a help in the work of the lord
[1:12:49] and they'll come up
[1:12:50] at the end time isn't that what the
[1:12:52] gibbonites became they became a helper
[1:12:55] to joshua's army at a time when they
[1:12:57] needed it
[1:12:58] god brought them into it did they ever
[1:13:01] become a part of the priesthood
[1:13:02] no but did they did they faithfully
[1:13:06] serve the house of god yes
[1:13:08] all of history says the gibby knight
[1:13:09] stayed there the whole time
[1:13:11] king after king at leader after leader
[1:13:13] they stayed there serving the house of
[1:13:15] god the whole time
[1:13:18] instead of dying instead of being
[1:13:20] exterminated instead of a holocaust
[1:13:22] god had mercy on them
[1:13:25] and then god blessed them over the years
[1:13:28] notice a couple more things
[1:13:31] so see that's the wise and foolish type
[1:13:33] wise
[1:13:34] wise virgin foolish version now look at
[1:13:37] this church oh my
[1:13:38] god the next slide here yeah check this
[1:13:41] out
[1:13:42] i should say check it out but this is
[1:13:44] amazing thought
[1:13:46] this blessed me yesterday i was telling
[1:13:47] my wife i was like i can't wait to
[1:13:48] preach this tomorrow
[1:13:50] church the gibby knights are a type of
[1:13:52] the gentiles
[1:13:54] being the tabernacle of god until the
[1:13:57] son of david came
[1:13:59] which was solomon right so god was
[1:14:02] having this is god having mercy on the
[1:14:04] gentiles
[1:14:05] if you study a history church gibeon
[1:14:07] became
[1:14:08] the resting place of the ark of god in
[1:14:11] the days of joshua
[1:14:12] all the way to the days of solomon
[1:14:15] so anytime david wanted to go consult at
[1:14:18] the ark you know we had to go to
[1:14:20] gibeon because that became the house of
[1:14:23] god
[1:14:24] that became the tabernacle of david
[1:14:27] until he brought
[1:14:28] it into jerusalem right so
[1:14:31] the gibeon became the house of god for
[1:14:35] 447 years
[1:14:37] that's where the ark stayed at this
[1:14:40] gentile city
[1:14:42] and god let those gentiles just stay
[1:14:44] there the whole time
[1:14:45] and god kept the ark there until and the
[1:14:47] bible said that god
[1:14:48] met solomon in gibeon solomon went to
[1:14:52] give he give me and said i want to build
[1:14:54] a house for you
[1:14:55] and and lord i want something from you
[1:14:57] and the lord said ask anything you want
[1:14:59] he said just give me wisdom and that's
[1:15:00] where god said
[1:15:01] i'm giving because you asked for wisdom
[1:15:03] and not long life and not your enemies
[1:15:05] and not money
[1:15:06] i'm giving you everything where did he
[1:15:09] do that
[1:15:09] at gibeon where the ark of god rested
[1:15:13] amen hallelujah the ark stayed
[1:15:17] there in the gentile city until the
[1:15:19] reign of the son of david
[1:15:22] and he brought it out and brought it to
[1:15:24] jerusalem
[1:15:26] what a beautiful picture of the ark of
[1:15:30] god with the gentiles
[1:15:32] until the time of the son of david i
[1:15:35] don't have that one in my book but
[1:15:36] that'd be a good one to put in there in
[1:15:37] the next revision
[1:15:39] now look god even protected them
[1:15:41] remember saul killed
[1:15:42] many gibeonites and later god gave
[1:15:45] israel
[1:15:45] three years of famine because saul
[1:15:47] touched the gibeonites because
[1:15:49] joshua swore by the name of the lord
[1:15:50] you'll not die
[1:15:53] three years of no rain because saul
[1:15:56] touched
[1:15:56] god's blessing god said
[1:16:00] joshua said you shall live that's thus
[1:16:02] saith the lord in the name of the lord
[1:16:03] you shall live
[1:16:04] and saul killed him so they got three
[1:16:06] years of famine for breaking thus saith
[1:16:08] the lord
[1:16:10] church god keeps his word and look
[1:16:13] god avenges his elect these are the
[1:16:16] foolish version type
[1:16:17] but god still avenges those gibby
[1:16:19] knights church they were hivites
[1:16:22] they were heathens but were granted
[1:16:24] mercy inside the kingdom of god
[1:16:27] for a space and time let's stand to our
[1:16:30] feet
[1:16:31] yeah i better stop right there musicians
[1:16:34] can come
[1:16:49] church i poured out my heart to you
[1:16:50] today
[1:16:53] i want you to know god loves you
[1:16:58] he is ready to pardon you
[1:17:01] delights in showing you mercy first i
[1:17:04] lean i need mercy just like you do
[1:17:08] he delights in it he he's not running
[1:17:10] away he's actually turned towards you
[1:17:13] if that's what it was under the blood of
[1:17:14] blows and goats what is it under the
[1:17:15] blood of christ
[1:17:17] the bible said he ever lives to bring
[1:17:19] you back into reconciliation
[1:17:22] oh that means you don't turn us back to
[1:17:23] us amen hey he's sitting
[1:17:25] on the throne making intercession for us
[1:17:27] now praise god
[1:17:29] satan says well he did that she did that
[1:17:31] he even if you haven't confessed that he
[1:17:33] said well
[1:17:33] he's there saying well she is going to
[1:17:34] confess it later today
[1:17:36] after that sermon from her home church
[1:17:38] she's going to confess it today
[1:17:41] so it's basically already forgiving
[1:17:43] devil because they accused you all night
[1:17:45] because you didn't confess one thing
[1:17:46] they confused you all night he's enough
[1:17:48] they're going to confess in a few
[1:17:49] minutes here just wait a little bit
[1:17:53] god is ready to forgive he's rich in
[1:17:56] mercy
[1:17:59] he's ready to pardon our iniquities
[1:18:01] through anything we've done he's ready
[1:18:02] to just throw it in the sea of
[1:18:03] forgetfulness
[1:18:05] where he'll remember it no more let's
[1:18:08] bow our heads for a moment here
[1:18:17] you play that song that reaches the
[1:18:19] highest mountain
[1:18:21] the blood it's the blood of christ it
[1:18:22] gives me strength
