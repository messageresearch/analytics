[0:01] 1 Peter
[0:02] 4:10 again I'll just be pulling out some
[0:05] highlights you know out of brother Ram's
[0:06] uh sermon
[0:07] there uh and as far as I understand I
[0:10] listened to it many many times but the
[0:12] save thief on the cross was the last
[0:14] individual brother Braham dealt with
[0:16] remember he dealt with Adam and Eve Noah
[0:18] Abraham Israel as a nation Moses David
[0:22] the saved thief on the cross as far as
[0:24] my counting oh that's seven praise God
[0:25] hallelujah that's a pretty good number
[0:27] uh completion by God's grace first Peter
[0:30] 4:10 and I was looking at some of the
[0:31] quotes you know I want to U I want to
[0:33] look at maybe gifts again tonight
[0:34] brother Ben was ministering on gifts how
[0:36] many you enjoyed that by God's grace I
[0:38] sure appreciated that U and I know we
[0:41] got quiet on some things but that's good
[0:43] that means we're thinking about it right
[0:45] Hallelujah by God's grace some things I
[0:47] got to go study out and some things I
[0:48] want to go think about too so that's
[0:50] good I I like to be challenged I like to
[0:52] learn more Hallelujah like I said that
[0:54] was a wonderful uh beautiful sermon both
[0:56] sermons but Sunday morning really was a
[0:58] blessing to me and I did share sh his
[1:00] sermon with that person but I realized
[1:02] it wasn't last week they sent it it was
[1:03] a whole month ago so to me the months or
[1:06] weeks are just kind of flowing together
[1:07] so I didn't mean to uh misrepresent the
[1:10] truth but I found out okay that was a
[1:12] month ago so uh it's still fitting
[1:15] though and I shared the the sermon with
[1:17] uh the person online 1 Peter
[1:22] 4:10 uh so I want to look at here how
[1:25] the gifts of God if we're faithful with
[1:28] them uh we must be stewards of the grace
[1:32] of God so the gifts that are given to us
[1:34] it's God's grace to us and then we want
[1:36] to be a faithful Steward of it so we
[1:38] look at that here tonight by God's grace
[1:40] because you know I guess in my thinking
[1:41] I've always thought this if I have a
[1:43] gift and let's say it's healing right
[1:45] I've I've sh shared that over the years
[1:46] I've Just Seen different people healed
[1:48] you know like even back in Iowa there
[1:50] well then I would think well if I'm
[1:51] going to double that then I should see
[1:52] double the Miracles but is that always
[1:54] the
[1:55] case is that always the case I mean
[1:58] because at what point does it stop
[2:00] doubling you know if you keep you know
[2:02] if I get a five-fold increase you know
[2:05] on my gift well then if there's one
[2:07] Miracle last year I double it or if I
[2:09] have to increase it by five every year 1
[2:11] Time 5 is five 5 Time 5 is 25 you
[2:14] understand what I'm saying I'm trying
[2:15] not to look at this Elementary with an
[2:17] elementary mind although I'm an
[2:18] elementary
[2:19] teacher but I'm trying to look at it
[2:22] spiritually and what does God expect of
[2:24] me because remember as Paul got
[2:27] older uh the everybody thought God had
[2:30] left
[2:31] him they like brother man dramatizes it
[2:34] in the present stage of my Ministry he
[2:37] says well well they looked at Paul and
[2:38] said oh he must not have a gift of
[2:40] healing anymore he's in prison or he
[2:41] must have lost he must have lost his
[2:43] gift well actually quite the opposite he
[2:46] was more devoted there in prison to
[2:47] write letters and write the Bible for
[2:50] us so you know you see how there how God
[2:53] can move you out of one gift and maybe
[2:55] bring in another
[2:56] gift by God's grace so I've tried to
[3:00] apply that to my life too I I just want
[3:01] to be faithful with the gifts I want to
[3:03] be a good Steward of the gifts and so uh
[3:06] let's read this here if we can't hear
[3:07] about God's grace okay let's read on
[3:09] three one two three as every man hath
[3:13] received the gift even so Minister the
[3:16] same one to another as good stewards of
[3:20] the manifold grace of God may God add
[3:22] his a blessing to the reading of his
[3:24] word you can be seated I am going to try
[3:26] to watch the time I'm fully exhausted
[3:28] from uh this last year weeks here and
[3:30] then singing just really took it out of
[3:32] me by God's grace and I forgot singing
[3:34] is a gift of healing so if anybody's
[3:36] been blessed by our songs you know maybe
[3:39] people are just pulling on the gifts you
[3:40] know I don't know by God's grace but I'm
[3:42] just happy to to serve the Lord so again
[3:45] that was the reminder you know I'm sorry
[3:46] the little review you know we looked at
[3:47] the Save thief on the cross last week
[3:49] and it went beautifully in my humble
[3:50] opinion went beautifully right into that
[3:52] Sunday message about uh the secret
[3:54] believer you enjoy that by God's grace I
[3:56] hope that that was a real blessing to me
[3:58] and I got a couple testimonies off for
[3:59] that people were really blessed by that
[4:01] so now I want to read just a a quote out
[4:04] of the message of Grace that has really
[4:05] nothing to do with uh these characters
[4:08] but brother man makes a statement uh
[4:09] I've I've recorded I've recorded over
[4:12] four hours with brother cam about Bible
[4:15] versions uh and I have edited one hour
[4:18] I'm waiting on cam to okay it so I can
[4:20] go public with it and again I think
[4:23] people are just going to call me a
[4:24] fanatic you know like they've called me
[4:25] with these other things oh you're a King
[4:27] James version only you're a fanatic well
[4:29] I I got proof I mean if you take one
[4:31] word away what's the Bible say your
[4:34] curse right your name can to be taken
[4:36] out um and so I just want to respect
[4:39] that verse right I want to respect that
[4:41] verse and so most people if they're even
[4:43] message people if they're using Bibles
[4:45] that have you know I'll just say it in
[4:48] the one book cam showed me this author
[4:51] just chose 257 verses like that's not
[4:53] even the whole Bible that's a very small
[4:55] segment and every Bible version had at
[4:58] least 5% of those missing
[5:00] out of just 257 what about the thousands
[5:03] of rest of them and some of those
[5:05] versions had 97% of those verses
[5:10] missing this is a big
[5:12] deal now can people still get saved in
[5:14] NIV of course I I was one of
[5:17] them I was saved my life was changed
[5:20] reading just reading NIV Bible remember
[5:22] I told you my testimony I saw the guy
[5:23] raising his hands I've told you 100
[5:25] times you you could probably tell better
[5:26] than I can tell it I probably forgot all
[5:27] the details by now
[5:30] uh anybody know what college he went
[5:34] to yeah my wife says yeah Ohio
[5:38] State but you know what did I do when I
[5:40] got home I opened up my NIV Bible what I
[5:43] do I tore down all the evil pictures
[5:44] threw all the way on my CDs my rock and
[5:46] roll and rap and Country CDs and I was
[5:49] reading the NIV Bible I got saved in an
[5:52] NIV Bible but when I started when I
[5:54] learn more oh my we they're missing
[5:56] whole verses
[5:59] and then you know the more the more
[6:02] liberal people get they'll actually
[6:03] change the whole idea and they won't
[6:05] translate word for word they'll
[6:07] translate thought for thought but they
[6:08] got the wrong thought they got the wrong
[6:11] thought about the Greek and so they give
[6:13] you the wrong thought about the
[6:14] Greek right rather than just doing word
[6:16] for word they do thought for thought
[6:18] that's even more dangerous so anyways um
[6:21] so with that in mind all that to
[6:23] background and say this brother man
[6:24] makes this quote it's in paragraph
[6:26] 94 he says uh the Israel Church never
[6:31] come to its full value the grace of God
[6:33] holds us as well so he goes from Israel
[6:35] to us but he wants to get a church
[6:38] that'll obey him a people that'll take
[6:40] his word and say it's the truth
[6:42] regardless of your organization now
[6:45] don't forget let's always bring it to
[6:46] our day brother brandom always brought
[6:48] the message to our day he said let's not
[6:50] keep Pentecostals out of it let's
[6:51] include Pentecostals so let's bring the
[6:54] message churches into it right God wants
[6:57] a message church that will obey him
[6:59] regardless of what message Church you're
[7:00] in Hallelujah right because like I've
[7:03] told I've told you this before any
[7:05] message church that starts a false
[7:06] Doctrine they've now become an a
[7:08] denomination right we see the seven
[7:10] Thunders denomination of Joseph Coleman
[7:12] out of New York um you see Lil's
[7:14] denomination about the Peruan movement
[7:16] that that Peruan means Christ is already
[7:18] here with that so they don't have to
[7:19] fast uh there's you don't have to shout
[7:21] and scream he's already here you don't
[7:22] have to pray you don't have to you don't
[7:24] have to recognize his presence because
[7:25] he's already here that's in Ohio that
[7:27] was in
[7:28] Ohio mind you it's not far from Lima
[7:30] where we were going to church when Chris
[7:32] and I first got into the message and
[7:34] that has permeated churches all around
[7:36] the world okay but that becomes a
[7:39] denomination because it's off the word
[7:41] of
[7:42] God brother R said God wants a people
[7:44] that will not say well I'm just as good
[7:46] as you are I'm Presbyterian I'm
[7:47] Methodist I'm Catholic I'm as good as
[7:49] you are that's not Grace that shows
[7:51] there's something
[7:53] wrong Hallelujah he said but a person
[7:56] regardless that'll read God's word and
[7:59] see that you've got to be born again and
[8:01] filled with the Holy Ghost he says
[8:03] they'll believe that they'll take it by
[8:05] the word they'll take the word exactly
[8:09] what it
[8:10] says hallelujah and what about these
[8:11] people that'll take the quotes above the
[8:13] word of God they'd rather have message
[8:14] books than the Bible right and some of
[8:16] those statements in the message books we
[8:18] love brother BR but some of those
[8:19] statements are not in the Bible so
[8:20] they're actually taking words outside
[8:22] the Bible but brother BR said God wants
[8:24] a people that takes exactly what the
[8:25] Bible says hallelujah then he goes into
[8:27] you know baptism and sprinkling Trinity
[8:30] and all these cutting hair makeup and
[8:32] all these things he says we've been
[8:34] through the church ages and see where
[8:36] they had to do that you know they they
[8:38] had to overcome you know sprinkling
[8:40] because they and Trinity they didn't
[8:41] have the revelation of it in the middle
[8:42] of the church ages right he says but you
[8:44] see God wants somebody that obey him if
[8:46] it's not in the scriptures then it's a
[8:49] man-made Doctrine and not a Bible
[8:50] Doctrine Hallelujah he said so
[8:53] regardless of what the church is how
[8:55] wrong you've been what difference does
[8:57] that make it's how right you can be
[9:00] now God's Grace has shown it to you then
[9:03] walk in it God's grace amen right so if
[9:07] God showed you the truth that's God's
[9:08] grace to you Hallelujah and it's the
[9:11] godhead Revelation it's all the
[9:12] revelations right serpent seed uh
[9:15] predestination Seven Seals seven Church
[9:17] ages the gifts of the holy spirit Divine
[9:19] Healing all these Revelations God has
[9:21] made known to us that's God's grace that
[9:24] we know it Hallelujah so he says walk in
[9:26] it see how right you can be right now
[9:29] amen and then I'm going to read this
[9:31] quote brother Paul Griffin read this
[9:32] quote but he didn't get to read all of
[9:34] it CU he was really pressed for time and
[9:35] I'm glad he didn't because he he had the
[9:37] right he had the right words to say
[9:39] right he had the he had to get us to uh
[9:41] getting our first love back I wonder in
[9:43] our church how many still got their
[9:44] first love I got it amen I got it
[9:47] Hallelujah so I wonder how many got it
[9:49] hopefully everybody has it by God's
[9:50] grace brother's referencing Galatians 1
[9:52] he says in other words if an angel would
[9:54] come to you from Heaven a bright shining
[9:57] Angel and would stand by boy that would
[9:59] be bait for this day wouldn't it a
[10:01] bright shining Angel come here and stand
[10:03] there and say some things that was
[10:04] contrary to the word and they would say
[10:07] Satan get away from me that's right if
[10:09] he's a bishop whoever he is don't you
[10:11] never believe him if he doesn't speak
[10:13] exactly with that Bible word for word
[10:17] how many how many remember brother Paul
[10:18] saying that yeah does it sound a little
[10:21] bit familiar he was quoting this from
[10:23] Christ is revealed his own word it's
[10:25] August 22nd oh that's pretty close to
[10:26] the day uh 1965
[10:30] okay so again both these quotes both
[10:32] quotes I read from me message of Grace
[10:34] and God revealing his own word they both
[10:35] say the same thing God wants someone who
[10:38] take the Bible word for word exactly as
[10:40] it says hallelujah so that's why you
[10:43] know when preachers come or anybody
[10:44] comes or even when I preach it's okay if
[10:46] you're quiet think about it if you don't
[10:47] understand something you don't have to
[10:48] say Amen right now what I do is if I
[10:51] don't understand it I'll wait till he
[10:52] says something right right afterwards
[10:53] then I'll say Amen to that but I wasn't
[10:55] saying Amen to what I didn't know
[10:56] because I if I don't know it I don't
[10:58] know it uh you don't know what you don't
[11:01] know we got that was good now brother
[11:04] said now watch him he'll carry you with
[11:05] the Bible now he's talking about God God
[11:07] will make sure you stay in the Bible
[11:09] he'll carry you to a certain place and
[11:11] then hook it right in there when you see
[11:12] the Bible saying one thing he bypasses
[11:14] that watch him right there he's talking
[11:15] about a false teacher he said that's the
[11:17] way Satan done with
[11:19] Eve
[11:20] okay now here's an another quote on
[11:24] God's grace brother Bram says Grace the
[11:26] grace of God has brought forth a shadow
[11:29] brought uh God brought Grace into our
[11:31] lives by his love for us here's
[11:34] something else great can't Grace Can't
[11:36] Do Grace cannot be bought remember Simon
[11:39] the Sorcerer he said I'll pay you money
[11:42] give me that money so I can be a
[11:44] preacher like
[11:45] you and I people can get the Holy Ghost
[11:48] Peter said your money perish with you
[11:51] right but man says you cannot bargain
[11:54] God for God's
[11:56] grace but I'll say it like this let me
[11:58] go the other side but you can make vows
[12:00] to God which is a type of a bargain for
[12:03] uh for your personal requests they're
[12:06] called vows everybody got it you can't
[12:09] bargain for a gift that's not yours but
[12:11] you can make a promise to God you can
[12:13] make a vow to God for something you're
[12:17] Desiring Hallelujah and remember even if
[12:19] it's something you desire even if it's
[12:21] the permissive will of God God may give
[12:23] it to you even if it isn't his perfect
[12:24] will and you'll you probably suffer for
[12:26] it like Hezekiah
[12:30] right Hezekiah oh he threw himself on
[12:31] the wall remember such a beautiful story
[12:33] he said Lord you know the Integrity of
[12:35] my heart but in the Integrity of his
[12:36] heart he got a little moved by
[12:38] emotion and he prayed and he and God
[12:40] gave him the permissive will will but
[12:41] then his sons got killed he had two sons
[12:44] remember he didn't have any sons to
[12:45] passing on to but the sons died they
[12:46] were awful men the Bible says they did
[12:48] not serve the Lord their God like
[12:50] Hezekiah did right and then he failed
[12:53] with the Babylonian visitors remember
[12:55] the princes that visit him he showed
[12:57] them all that and what they do they went
[12:58] back and then here come here come
[13:00] Nebuchadnezzar to ransack
[13:02] it so what does it teach us we should
[13:05] seek the perfect will of God first
[13:07] before our
[13:08] desires right remember balam failed with
[13:11] it too bam said can I go God God said no
[13:13] he goes back well let me let me try
[13:14] again if there's money involved I'll go
[13:16] ask God again if I can make a little
[13:18] money in this I'll do it God said fine
[13:20] go so thus sayith the Lord change in one
[13:23] day thus say the Lord was don't go thus
[13:25] sayth the Lord go in other words thus
[13:26] sayi the Lord I'm giving you the
[13:27] permissive will of God I didn't change
[13:30] my mind about the first word right but
[13:33] I'm giving you what you want okay so see
[13:36] how you have to rightly divide this
[13:37] quote you can't bargain for Grace if it
[13:41] doesn't belong to you in other words you
[13:42] can't you can't have a gift that that's
[13:44] not yours and you can't bargain to be
[13:46] saved even Esau tried to get it with
[13:49] tears but what does it show it showed he
[13:52] was what he had when he was bargaining
[13:53] for it it was worldly sorrow it wasn't
[13:55] Godly sorrow amen cuz he look he never
[13:58] cleaned up his life
[13:59] afterwards he had he a polygamist if I'm
[14:02] not mistaken uh the Bible never says he
[14:04] repents of some of these murders he did
[14:06] and all these things like that so it was
[14:08] just a worldly sorrow well no wonder he
[14:10] couldn't bargain he was trying to
[14:11] bargain well if I say if I cry enough
[14:14] maybe I'll get it back no you can't
[14:15] bargain like those things Hallelujah you
[14:17] can't bargain with worldly sorrow you
[14:19] got to be really truly sorrowful
[14:22] Hallelujah where you want to repent of
[14:24] that and and make up for your amends uh
[14:26] I'm sorry make amends for your sins Amen
[14:29] brother said that's something else you
[14:31] cannot buy Grace it's from a sovereign
[14:34] one yes sir you cannot bargain for it
[14:36] you can say well God I'll do so and so
[14:38] if you'll do so and so regarding to
[14:40] Salvation he's talking about salvation
[14:41] I'll read you the scripture uh put up uh
[14:44] where's Romans uh 9:16 H let's we have
[14:47] to look at the context of the verse
[14:49] brother's referring to you cannot say
[14:52] God I'll do this if you do this God
[14:53] won't do that you can't pull anything
[14:56] out of God think about that now all
[14:58] these preachers are saying you can pull
[14:59] your healing out of God well what about
[15:01] the woman with the blood issue how she
[15:02] touched it out she pulled out virtue out
[15:04] of God well that's referring to Divine
[15:05] Healing that's not referring to
[15:08] Salvation look at the con you got to
[15:10] look at the context okay what is what is
[15:12] so then it is not of him that runneth
[15:14] nor of him that I'm sorry willth nor of
[15:16] him that runneth but God that showeth
[15:17] Mercy he's talking about the vessels of
[15:19] honor and dishonor Paul's talking about
[15:20] salvation and
[15:22] predestination if you're a vessel of
[15:24] Honor you can't be nothing but a vessel
[15:25] of Honor that ought make somebody say
[15:27] Amen that bring smile on somebody's face
[15:29] tonight if you are always a vessel of
[15:31] Honor in God's mind then you'll always
[15:33] be that Hallelujah if you were that
[15:35] before the foundation word if your name
[15:36] was on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[15:38] the foundation of the world there's
[15:39] nothing that can take it off amen
[15:42] nothing but if you're a vessel of
[15:44] Dishonor like Esau like Judas SC scariot
[15:46] then you're going to sell out the gospel
[15:48] then you're really not going to repent
[15:49] but church if you really repented it
[15:51] shows you've got something you've got
[15:53] some honor in your heart
[15:54] hallelujah hallelujah praise God so this
[15:57] is the verse my Manon God gives it to
[16:00] you by his grace oh he says oh oh my not
[16:03] he that willth or him that rth but God
[16:04] that's showing Mercy that's right so
[16:07] it's like Simon the Sorcerer we don't
[16:08] know if he was saved or not but it looks
[16:10] like he was a vessel of Dishonor he
[16:12] repented got baptized but then he tries
[16:13] to buy it and Peter says uh you're
[16:16] surely you're close to perishing he said
[16:18] pray for me and uh and Peter probably
[16:20] prayed for him we were not told the end
[16:22] of the story we don't know hopefully he
[16:24] got saved hopefully you know he just
[16:25] lived a Christian Life right because he
[16:28] would not he wasn't called to pray for
[16:29] people for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:31] he would not have asked for that if he
[16:32] was called to do it he would not have
[16:34] asked to pay for it with that if he was
[16:35] called to do that
[16:38] right so we we see this here you can beg
[16:41] and plead for God to answer your prayers
[16:43] that's good uh that that's fine but you
[16:46] can't you can't force God to do
[16:48] something you can't make a wager with
[16:50] God like with money right that's so we
[16:53] see that that's what brother Ram is
[16:54] saying here uh you you can't do that you
[16:57] can't bargain for Grace but you can make
[16:59] a vow to God right look at uh uh the
[17:03] great
[17:04] example uh the mother uh Samuel's mom I
[17:07] can't think of her Hannah I can't think
[17:08] of her name Hannah she made a vow she
[17:11] said God if you give me a son I'll give
[17:13] him back to you and she gave him back
[17:16] imagine giving a four or fiveyear old
[17:17] baby and you give him away and you never
[17:19] see him again that's quite a thing but
[17:21] she kept her
[17:23] promise that's why God honored her like
[17:25] she did like he did because he knew she
[17:27] was sincere
[17:29] made a promise to God hallelujah and so
[17:32] church that we're told that brother BR
[17:34] tells us that you can't bargain for
[17:35] certain things with God they're either
[17:37] predestinated salvation and Gifts you're
[17:40] either predestinated or you're not so
[17:42] all you can say is God uh uh and we're
[17:44] going to get to that next all say is God
[17:46] just show me what's in my life show me
[17:48] what your plan is for my life amen don't
[17:51] give me the permissive will give me the
[17:52] permiss the perfect will of God and give
[17:54] me a heart to receive it and wait for it
[17:56] amen because all gifts come in perfect
[17:58] time and season they all come at the
[18:01] perfect time and the perfect
[18:04] season what was uh brother Ben saying
[18:07] about gifts remember he was saying
[18:08] something about oh yeah brother brother
[18:10] Ben even brought it down to it's not
[18:11] even our
[18:13] gift it's God's Gift God gave gifts unto
[18:16] men There It Is God gave gifts unto men
[18:19] the preaching gifts and that's every
[18:20] gift including the the nine gifts of the
[18:22] Holy Spirit and then remember core and
[18:24] daythan they thought they had a gift to
[18:26] do something and they were trying to get
[18:28] to a gift that they didn't have that was
[18:29] preached Us by Brother
[18:31] McBride right there were they wanted
[18:33] they wanted their Ministry see how see
[18:35] how this was all tied together with
[18:36] brother uh McBride and and brother uh
[18:40] Ben I'm I'm tired tonight forgive
[18:42] me wake up brother wake up wake up uh so
[18:46] we can see how it's all tied together
[18:49] and then uh brother Bram brings this out
[18:51] you can't bargain a gift out of God you
[18:52] can't even bargain salvation out of
[18:55] God you just come you come God's
[18:58] provided way you take God's word brother
[19:00] man said uh you're not saved because of
[19:02] your Works he said you're saved because
[19:04] you met God's
[19:05] conditions God said repent and you
[19:07] repent now you're saved amen hallelujah
[19:10] you came God's provided way Hallelujah
[19:12] not by your works by him that willth or
[19:14] him that runneth but it's God that shows
[19:16] Mercy
[19:18] Hallelujah now let's get into gifts
[19:20] again just a little review because
[19:21] seemed like God was speaking to brother
[19:23] Dennis on it I'm sorry brother yeah
[19:24] brother Dennis and brother Ben my
[19:26] goodness gracious I'm probably trying to
[19:27] go too fast
[19:30] people brother man said people lay on
[19:32] their faces this is in uh the message of
[19:34] Grace and some men come to me I believe
[19:37] I seen one of the boys back here in the
[19:38] building today a Methodist boy just come
[19:40] in he received the Holy Spirit and them
[19:42] boys come to me and said now brother
[19:43] ramam now that we have been G I'm sorry
[19:46] now that we have been saved and received
[19:47] the Holy Ghost shall we go to seeking
[19:49] gifts and I said don't do it don't do it
[19:53] how many heard that quote before I've
[19:54] heard it for
[19:56] years people say don't worry about the
[19:58] don't worry about about the gifts but I
[20:00] preach this verse put up 1 Corinthians
[20:03] 1231 because people have misunderstood
[20:05] the context of brother Ram's quotes they
[20:08] do this many times they do this many
[20:10] many
[20:11] times because church this is what I
[20:13] found if people say they got the Holy
[20:15] Ghost then they stop seeking God and
[20:16] their life their life gets uh it gets
[20:18] cold on God but what does the Bible say
[20:22] I'm sorry this is not the sorry it's not
[20:25] 31 uh put up uh I got maybe I it down is
[20:29] it 141 yeah it's 141
[20:32] sorry I better go back to my Bible my
[20:34] studying today I must have typed the
[20:36] wrong
[20:37] one had a good day though by God's grace
[20:39] really good
[20:45] day oh yeah yeah yeah that was right
[20:49] 12:31 yeah put up 12:31 then we'll go
[20:52] back to this one yeah I had I said it
[20:55] wrong but yeah earnestly covet the best
[21:00] gifts and yet show I unto you a more
[21:02] excellent way this is what I've seen
[21:05] people tell me they have the Holy Ghost
[21:06] or we we hear people say that Holy Ghost
[21:08] and if they don't go seeking gifts
[21:10] they're going to get cold on God that's
[21:12] going to open them up to a lot of Mind
[21:13] battles because you stop seeking God you
[21:16] know when you remember back when you're
[21:17] seeking the Holy Ghost what do you do
[21:18] it's all about prayer and everything's
[21:20] on God everything and people lose that
[21:22] when they get an experience I'm talking
[21:24] to our young ones too because we've had
[21:26] some good experiences last year was a
[21:27] year of experiences wasn't it
[21:29] that was awesome awesome but you can't
[21:31] stop because if you stop seeking God
[21:34] you're going to get cold on God Amen
[21:36] you're going to lose the fear of the
[21:38] Lord which I might preach on Sunday
[21:40] because I've been studying on
[21:41] backsliding because somebody asked me on
[21:43] the internet if you can you make a video
[21:45] on backs sliding I'm like yeah I'll
[21:46] start studying on that I'm like my
[21:47] goodness I was hoping to preach it
[21:48] tonight but there's no way I want to get
[21:49] to it tonight I got too many notes it
[21:51] ain't going to happen tonight no
[21:55] never But but so so brother says oh
[21:57] don't do it don't don't seek gifts but
[22:00] they don't read the rest of the quote
[22:02] not surprised most people don't right
[22:04] most people don't read the rest of the
[22:05] quote but what does Paul say covet
[22:08] earnestly that means covet like in the
[22:10] good way like my I want to see God use
[22:13] Malachi I want to God see God you sister
[22:15] Zur I want to see God you sister Naomi
[22:17] and sister Christen and I want to I I
[22:19] want I want to see God use their gifts
[22:21] that's what it means I want God to use
[22:25] them why so we all get edified amen amen
[22:29] so we can see God's Among Us a we're
[22:31] just not here on a social Gathering
[22:33] God's here
[22:34] amen like we seen with brother McBride
[22:36] and brother Dennis I mean all the
[22:37] brothers brother Ben all the brothers
[22:40] brother Paul brother Aaron I'm just not
[22:42] I'm just bringing them up because
[22:42] they're the most ones on my mind most
[22:44] recently but see covet these he's
[22:46] talking to people that have all kinds of
[22:48] gifts he said but covet the best gifts
[22:51] earnestly and yet show I unto you a more
[22:53] excellent way now go to 141 how could
[22:55] brother Ram say don't seek gifts don't
[22:57] seek gifts but the bble says it because
[22:59] people don't read the rest of the
[23:01] quote follow after charity and desire
[23:04] spiritual gifts but rather that you may
[23:06] prophesy see we should desire them
[23:09] everybody say desire ready desire you
[23:12] should come to church and desire boy I
[23:13] hope somebody has a Word of Wisdom
[23:15] tonight I hope somebody has a a word of
[23:17] knowledge tonight I hope somebody gets
[23:19] divinely healed tonight amen right
[23:22] that's just three of them there's six
[23:23] more I hope God give somebody the gift
[23:26] of faith like brother Ben said he he
[23:28] said when they were having that Bible
[23:29] study remember he said somebody was sick
[23:31] and he said who's got to get the faith
[23:32] go lay hands on them and pray for
[23:35] him because God might God might anoint
[23:37] that person's faith and God might move
[23:39] upon that person's faith and heal
[23:42] them right and the least at the least
[23:45] just come up for prayer you know have
[23:47] the preacher pray for you at the least
[23:48] you know if you have a need call on God
[23:50] you never know when God's going to move
[23:52] like that Danny guy with you know he
[23:53] could barely walk out there I didn't
[23:55] know I didn't feel I don't remember
[23:56] feeling anything when I prayed for him
[23:58] but God didn't move right away God moved
[23:59] uh uh 30 minutes after service when he's
[24:01] in the car and he felt the numbness
[24:03] leave he said I'm Healed she said praise
[24:05] the Lord that's what we need to do
[24:06] praise the Lord amen hallelujah so
[24:10] follow after charity desire spiritual
[24:12] gifts but rather that you may prophesy
[24:15] uh can you put up verse 39 in that same
[24:21] chapter yeah wherefore Brethren covet to
[24:25] prophesy God tell us the future is this
[24:28] the time of the squeeze we should desire
[24:29] that right like I've told you before I
[24:32] want to know if I'm going to be raptured
[24:33] or if I'm going to live to the Rapture
[24:34] or if I'll die I'd like to know that but
[24:36] I need to seek that more that's just one
[24:38] example I can easily bring up like we
[24:40] should desire some prophecy a dream to
[24:43] tell us what's going to happen next amen
[24:45] or a preacher to come in and prophesy
[24:47] through the
[24:48] sermon man it's a reality it happens and
[24:52] forbid not to speak with tongues I just
[24:54] gave you three Amen in the mouth of how
[24:56] many witnesses should every word be
[24:57] established to
[24:59] I just gave you three they're just in
[25:00] the same two chapters right 12 and 14
[25:03] now let me read the rest of that quote
[25:04] so now people can understand why it's so
[25:09] misunderstood brother man said don't do
[25:10] it don't don't do it he said God gives
[25:13] his gifts
[25:15] sovereignly gifts and callings are
[25:17] without repentance Romans 12 I'm sorry
[25:19] Romans 11 sorry my fault now look
[25:22] brother man says the first thing you
[25:25] know you go to seeking something and say
[25:27] God you just make me a preacher oh now I
[25:32] understand what brother Ram's
[25:33] saying he said when people start seeking
[25:36] God for gifts he said they basically say
[25:39] God this is the gift I want give me the
[25:41] gift I want that's what was going on
[25:43] because they were all saying you got to
[25:44] speak in tongues and the church
[25:47] said oh so now now I understand brother
[25:49] R okay now I see what the Bible says
[25:52] brother Ram's not in disagreement with
[25:54] the Bible brother Ram's just saying the
[25:56] mood of that day was make me this make
[25:58] me this how many times you seen on these
[26:00] uh YouTube videos somebody made me an
[26:02] apostle somebody made me a pastor
[26:03] somebody made me a prophet and they
[26:05] never prophesied one time amen they
[26:07] never traveled overseas one time to a
[26:09] nation that didn't have Christians and
[26:10] actually uh made a convert and started a
[26:12] church they never did it one time they
[26:14] don't even know what they're talking
[26:15] about they're going through what brother
[26:17] BR was warning the people about praise
[26:20] God and now let's keep reading let's
[26:23] keep listening to brother Brandon he's
[26:25] God you just make me a preacher you just
[26:27] do this to me
[26:29] and what are you going to be a big
[26:31] stuffed shirt so prly say God let me
[26:35] speak in tongues and God might let you
[26:36] do it because remember gifts can just
[26:38] fall on people just for one a few times
[26:41] right they can do that and you just have
[26:43] that gift right uh like brother Ben said
[26:45] he's seen all nine gifts of the holy
[26:46] spirit in his life but I'm sure there
[26:48] are some more than others in the church
[26:51] that right I mean God doesn't promise
[26:54] how many times he's going to use you in
[26:55] that gift but if go but Glory if you're
[26:58] a yielded vessel he can use you for it
[27:00] for that moment amen hallelujah for that
[27:04] moment
[27:07] Hallelujah a big stuffed shirt that's
[27:09] all you'll go to some man's theology in
[27:11] some organization like Pentecostal
[27:13] speaking in tongues and there you'll
[27:15] pillow yourself down in canker well I'm
[27:17] a prophet or I'm a preacher when you
[27:19] really weren't you said God make me it
[27:23] we got a lot of preachers acting like
[27:24] they're preachers and they ain't
[27:25] preachers now ain't not the good word
[27:27] but they're not preachers amen why cuz
[27:29] they get off the word of
[27:32] God he said let God do the
[27:36] calling see so in brother's day he said
[27:38] all these people seeking things but they
[27:39] were they were claiming things or trying
[27:41] to pull things out of God brother said
[27:43] just let God do the calling God will
[27:45] call you God will sanctify you God will
[27:47] give you what he what he'll I'm sorry
[27:50] what he has need to give you you can't
[27:52] bargain for Grace amen he's still in
[27:54] that thought you can't bargain say God
[27:57] make me a preacher make me a millionaire
[27:59] that's how these people get millionaires
[28:00] they sell their souls to the devil I
[28:03] just seen another video on all these
[28:04] people Katy Perry Bob Dylan uh Kanye
[28:07] West said he sold his soul for the devil
[28:09] To Be A Millionaire or whatever
[28:11] billionaire whatever they are they sell
[28:13] their souls out see because they want to
[28:16] be something that God's not called them
[28:18] to
[28:19] do thank God we've given our souls to
[28:22] Jesus Christ
[28:23] Hallelujah right we didn't sell our
[28:25] souls but we accepted his love in our
[28:28] Souls amen we gave ourselves over to him
[28:31] Jesus is the one who sold himself into
[28:33] sin hallelujah amen he's the one that
[28:36] took all your sins all my sins on him
[28:39] he's the one that made his soul an
[28:41] offering for sin Hallelujah and our
[28:42] souls can now be born again
[28:45] hallelujah
[28:47] amen can't bargain for Grace you can't
[28:50] be sold it can't be bargain for nor can
[28:52] it be bought can't be traded for you
[28:55] can't say well now Lord I'll just go

[29:01] message or this big Pentecostal church
[29:03] or this big nazarine church I'll do this
[29:05] if you'll just do this for
[29:08] me see remember some people are called
[29:10] to be rich and some people are called to
[29:11] be what poor it's not your choice it's
[29:15] God's choice see talking about money and
[29:17] influence oh give me this gift so I can
[29:19] be a big guy give me this gift so I can
[29:21] be a big woman somewhere well what about

[29:30] sir yes Lord yes Lord whatever you have
[29:33] for me I'm nobody you save me I didn't
[29:36] save myself I don't care what my life uh
[29:39] I don't care my my net worth as long as
[29:42] I have the worth of Jesus Christ blood
[29:44] amen that's that's only not worth I'm
[29:46] counting amen how many uh Heavenly
[29:49] possessions do we have well at least we
[29:50] know we have eternal life hallelujah
[29:53] amen we got a uh we got a theophany
[29:55] waiting over there a house Eternal not
[29:57] made with hands waiting in the heavens
[29:59] hallelujah how valuable is that church
[30:01] can any can anybody put a a a a net a
[30:04] net value on that praise God or net
[30:06] worth who can put a net worth on a on a
[30:09] theophany body ah it's without number
[30:13] it's without money or cost amen

[30:19] bargained no sir all that the father has
[30:22] given me will come to me and no man can
[30:24] come to me except my father calls him
[30:26] first
[30:29] remember you can you can have all the
[30:31] gifts without the love of God let's go
[30:33] to 1 Corinthians uh 13:1 just as a
[30:36] familiar reading I got yeah I got at
[30:38] least half hour I can preach by God's
[30:40] grace now the word profit means to be
[30:43] useful or have an advantage 1
[30:46] Corinthians 13:1 do I speak with the
[30:48] tongues of men and angels and have not
[30:49] charity I become as a a sounding brass
[30:53] or a tinkling symbol just a noise maker
[30:56] noise maker noise maker noise maker
[30:58] right so think most churches are like
[30:59] this they just make noise they don't
[31:00] have the real love of God to believe the
[31:02] word of God Jesus said if you love me
[31:04] what you do keep the commands not take
[31:06] words out of the Bible you keep all the
[31:08] words in the Bible amen like brother
[31:10] said you do exactly what the word says
[31:11] word for word that's what God's looking
[31:14] for a church that'll take the word of
[31:16] God word by word exactly with the word
[31:18] praise
[31:20] God two you're so good and though I have
[31:25] the gift of Prophecy and understand all
[31:26] Mysteries which we do I I still want to
[31:28] preach a sermon on this we understand
[31:30] all the Mysteries if it's called a
[31:32] mystery we know what it is because
[31:34] there's only 12 of them it's pretty easy
[31:36] there's only 12 that are actually called
[31:39] Mysteries and we know all of them so
[31:42] this is speaking directly to us even if
[31:44] you understand all the 12 New Testament
[31:45] Mysteries or some people say 11 whatever
[31:47] you want to say I didn't say thus say
[31:49] the Lord and all knowledge and so you
[31:52] see understand that's understand you
[31:54] understand everything in the Bible
[31:54] everything in the message which is the
[31:56] word of God that's being revealed today
[31:58] it's not just every word on the tape
[31:59] it's the scriptures being fulfilled
[32:01] today praise God I got 30 verses on that
[32:05] and I have all Faith so I could remove
[32:07] all the mountains of my life I can just
[32:10] speak to every obstacle whether it's
[32:12] building a church or getting over the
[32:14] government or or speaking to fig trees
[32:16] or whatever it is I can speak to storms
[32:18] if I can do all that and I don't have
[32:20] charity I'm
[32:22] nothing right and charity is in the
[32:26] Greek it means affection or benevolence
[32:28] which is well-meaning or kindness amen
[32:32] you just want the well or you just want
[32:35] good for everybody else you don't want
[32:37] to fight against people divide people uh
[32:40] uh pit people against each other you
[32:42] just want the best for everybody oh
[32:44] Hallelujah that's charity amen so let's
[32:48] ask ourselves that as a message church
[32:49] I'm probably getting into my sermon then
[32:51] what I want to preach you know kind of
[32:52] preaching it again or preaching it early
[32:55] so I can understand all the Mysteries as
[32:57] message people but is my heart for all
[33:00] the other message people and non-
[33:02] message people is my heart is my heart
[33:04] saying I want the best for them or do I
[33:07] wish they
[33:08] would receive judgments of
[33:12] God that should give us a good idea if
[33:14] we got the love of God now don't get me
[33:17] wrong there are times where you know
[33:19] Paul Paul said that Alexander he'll get
[33:22] what God's got for him you he's going to
[33:24] be judged there are times where God can
[33:25] reveal to you that's not some talk about
[33:28] maybe so much but in most cases we got
[33:31] we have to think we want the best for
[33:32] people boy I sure hope they get
[33:34] forgiveness I sure up they get over this
[33:37] depression I sure up they get over this
[33:38] uh lust I sure up they get over this
[33:40] greed and the church said like you want
[33:43] the best for people that's charity
[33:47] well-meaning it's also called a love
[33:49] Feast so see you have you provide food
[33:52] everybody come on in and eat you just
[33:55] you just want to help people you just
[33:56] want to be good to people people amen

[34:04] kindness
[34:06] affection
[34:08] right all right so we can see that so it
[34:11] it it doesn't profit us verse three yeah
[34:14] the word Prophet must be in verse three
[34:15] is it and though I bestow all my goods
[34:17] to feed the poor and though I give uh my
[34:19] body to be burned now remember even this
[34:21] year Church there was a Democrat guy who
[34:23] burned his body right there uh by the
[34:25] Supreme Court if I'm not mistaken cuz he
[34:27] was upset about some ruling they had
[34:29] about President Trump he burned his body
[34:31] for the Democratic party but the Bible
[34:34] said if he didn't do in love it doesn't
[34:35] profit him
[34:38] anything see that people people think
[34:41] this will this this shows my real love
[34:43] but that's not real
[34:47] love and have not charity it doesn't
[34:49] profit me anything did that guy want the
[34:51] best for Donald Trump you don't have to
[34:53] answer
[34:54] that do he want the best for Joe Biden
[34:58] let's bring it to let's bring it down
[35:00] home who you want the best for Camala

[35:19] whatever you know they don't say Force
[35:20] but make make me speak in tongues or
[35:21] make me a preacher or whatever make me a
[35:24] prophet but said you just become a
[35:26] member of that big church that's all you
[35:28] won't be saved Grace has to save you
[35:31] amen our talent doesn't save us our
[35:33] talents that we have cannot earn Grace
[35:36] by
[35:37] talents right Judas was talented in
[35:39] other words gifted he could cast out
[35:41] Devils heal the sick raise the dead read
[35:43] Matthew 10 if you haven't lately he
[35:45] could do all those things but he lost
[35:47] salvation because you're not saved by
[35:49] gifts you're saved by grace
[35:51] amen hallelujah you have to accept God's
[35:54] grace for your life Hallelujah
[35:58] if God made me a preacher that don't
[36:00] show his grace has been with me no no
[36:02] it's his grace alone that saved
[36:05] me not because I preach the gospel I'm
[36:08] saved no not because you speak with
[36:10] tongues you're saved no not because you
[36:14] preach not even saved just because you
[36:16] preach you're not saved because you
[36:17] speak with tongues you're not saved
[36:18] because you do any of these things 1
[36:20] Corinthians 13 proves so though I speak
[36:23] with tongue of men and angels though I
[36:24] understand all the mysteries of God a
[36:25] preacher though I do all this and have
[36:27] no I'm sorry have faith to move
[36:29] mountains I am nothing until charity
[36:30] comes in which is love love is Grace gra
[36:33] the grace of God does it all
[36:35] amen I love this message it's a great
[36:37] sermon here by God's grace this a this a
[36:39] masterpiece if we ever heard one amen
[36:42] the the message of Grace it's only a
[36:43] short sermon it's only uh it's only like
[36:46] an hour I got the numbers down here
[36:48] later it's only like an hour and 40 I
[36:50] think and then he prays for like 30
[36:52] minutes
[36:54] afterwards he said God's grace cannot be
[36:56] bargained for
[36:59] Talent cannot be bargained for it's
[37:00] Sovereign Grace nothing and he quotes he
[37:02] quotes A Hymn nothing in my arms I bring
[37:05] simply to thy cross I cling and the
[37:06] church said see not not God you make me
[37:09] this no I just come to the I just come I
[37:12] just come to Jesus clinging to the cross
[37:14] I don't come saying make me a big
[37:15] somebody make me Rich make me famous
[37:17] make me part of a big church make me
[37:18] popular uh no just come and take hold of
[37:22] the cross of Jesus Amen Hallelujah and
[37:24] and take up your cross and someday
[37:26] you'll lay it aside and you'll receive a
[37:28] crown someday I'll receive a crown
[37:31] you'll receive a crown by God's
[37:33] grace brother said wait uh naked wounded
[37:36] I just come to him as I am just as I Am
[37:39] Without One Plea but that thy blood was
[37:41] shed for me and that thou bids me come
[37:43] to thee Oh Lamb of God I come he quotes
[37:45] the P the I'm sorry the
[37:47] hymn now let's briefly go through
[37:50] this nine gifts briefly the word of
[37:53] wisdom now I got these in my book in the
[37:55] 12 New Testament Mysteries book it's
[37:56] been a while since we went over this is
[37:58] basically sound advice and it's
[38:01] discretion And Timely decision making
[38:03] Jesus said wisdom is Justified of her
[38:05] children so a gift of wisdom will be
[38:07] manifested by the results if you gave
[38:10] somebody a Word of Wisdom you'll see
[38:12] what happens they'll come back and say
[38:13] that was the right thing to do at the
[38:15] right
[38:16] time Jesus gave a word of wisdom about
[38:18] paying taxes to Caesar but also giving
[38:20] money to God that was the right thing at
[38:22] the right time produce the right results
[38:24] right Rome didn't come down and kill you
[38:25] because you didn't pay your uh pay your
[38:28] taxes the wise virgin prepared extra oil
[38:31] in the case of the bridegroom carried
[38:34] while the foolish virgin neglected it
[38:36] that was wisdom because it's very timely
[38:38] look if you don't got the oil you're
[38:39] missing the the bridegroom's coming
[38:42] timely wisdom prepare
[38:45] oil because there's a there's a time you
[38:47] have to be ready at the right
[38:50] time Paul shared that his belief in the
[38:53] resurrection in front of the divided
[38:55] angry Jewish Council saved his life and
[38:57] in Acts 23 it was the right word of
[38:59] wisdom at the right time saved his life
[39:01] he had to have it there or they were
[39:03] going to the Mob was going to kill him
[39:05] remember that Word of Wisdom he brought
[39:07] up this issue and divided the crowd and
[39:09] then he could get out amen
[39:12] hallelujah now I and then I give
[39:14] examples from our church a minister said
[39:16] I gave him a Word of Wisdom on how to
[39:18] handle extracurricular activities of his
[39:20] children because another preacher
[39:22] wrongly accused him of being a bad
[39:23] father and that brother called me up and
[39:24] said you gave me the word of wisdom
[39:26] brother Jesse I need that word at that
[39:28] time because I've been accused of being
[39:30] an unfit father another brother said I
[39:33] gave him a word of wisdom to continue in
[39:34] his ministry when he was he said he came
[39:36] to that church that I still remember
[39:37] that morning too I came to his church
[39:39] and I preached and he said that morning
[39:41] he decided I'm not going to preach
[39:43] anymore and my whole sermon was on being
[39:45] diligent with your gifts I remember I
[39:47] looked right at him I I remember I
[39:48] looked right at him and I said brother
[39:50] you keep preaching God's word something
[39:52] long time I said you keep investing God
[39:54] will bless it
[39:55] Hallelujah and he repented he said I a
[39:57] word of wisdom right after that
[39:59] Hallelujah now I wish I had some more of
[40:02] those amen right I I wish I could just
[40:04] double them all the time right but see
[40:07] it's not the right thought on gifts it
[40:10] means we're more yielded for it right
[40:12] and then God can use us in the future
[40:14] that's what it means you Faithfully
[40:15] invest in it and God can use it in the
[40:20] future now the word of knowledge is
[40:23] um understanding when you understand
[40:26] something now the ones we know tongu
[40:27] interpretation those are going to be
[40:28] really easy to talk about um but the
[40:31] understanding Jesus calls understanding
[40:34] a key of knowledge I'm sorry yeah he
[40:36] calls knowledge a key of
[40:38] understanding and a key a word of
[40:40] knowledge helps you enter into something
[40:42] you didn't you couldn't see
[40:43] before right so when you have knowledge
[40:45] you can enter into something now I see
[40:47] it and it's got to be the Bible
[40:49] knowledge right it won't be something
[40:50] outside the Bible it's got to be in the
[40:52] Bible so Peter and Philip gave
[40:54] scriptural knowledge they cited Joel to
[40:57] 28 and Isaiah 53 allowing 3,000 souls to
[41:01] get saved and baptized and the Ethiopian
[41:04] unic to enter in the door of Salvation
[41:07] amen he gave them the key the scriptures
[41:10] this is talking about Jesus this is
[41:11] talking about Joel praise God Amen and
[41:14] now they could enter into the baptism of
[41:15] the Holy Ghost or enter into salvation
[41:17] they could enter into something praise
[41:18] God
[41:22] Amen now I also believe that brother
[41:25] Dennis and brother uh Ben and even
[41:27] brother Paul and brother Aaron gave us
[41:29] some of these words of understanding and
[41:31] discernment judging Spirits right
[41:34] because what they what what did brother
[41:35] denst preach on
[41:37] Spirits right I still remember the
[41:39] titles I don't know why this is a
[41:41] special weekend the perfect man tame in
[41:43] the
[41:44] tongue Spirit of a tail
[41:47] Bearer Spirit of resentment I've never
[41:49] heard a preacher take titles of evil
[41:52] spirits
[41:54] never in 20 24 years in the message I've
[41:59] never heard that that was so
[42:02] Discerning right I mean right he fasted
[42:06] all week prayed all week he he didn't
[42:07] even fellowship with us on Saturday so
[42:09] he could bring the word he wanted to be
[42:10] so consecrated to God
[42:15] hallelujah Acts 19 Paul opened the door
[42:18] of baptism to the 12 Ephesian Believers
[42:21] see they needed a a word of know they
[42:22] needed knowledge they need to know there
[42:23] is a holy ghost and a new baptism amen
[42:26] our lord Jesus Christ baptism and when
[42:28] he did that what happened the Holy Ghost
[42:29] fell right on them after they were
[42:30] baptized they entered into something by
[42:33] understanding the word hallelujah like I
[42:36] told you uh did I write it yeah yeah
[42:38] when I was trying to overcome tobacco I
[42:39] couldn't overcome it until I saw 1
[42:41] Corinthians 6:12 which says I will not
[42:44] be brought under the power of any and
[42:46] that verse was a key to me I oh now I
[42:49] understand now I don't have to keep
[42:50] chewing tobacco I'm under the power of
[42:52] it but I don't have to be praise God and
[42:55] now I could enter into my deliverance
[42:56] and I've been in this room ever since I
[42:58] like this room I'm not going I'm not
[42:59] leaving this
[43:00] room I like this room it's a clean room
[43:02] amen it's a nice room it's a cheaper
[43:04] room too by God's grace sure was a
[43:07] cleaner room I know that I'm sure my
[43:08] wife appreciates that too Hallelujah and
[43:12] then I said my wife gave me a word of
[43:13] knowledge I shared with a struggling
[43:14] brother now you know this brother Brian
[43:16] Hawkins about whether he could be both a
[43:18] preacher and a deacon and when I gave
[43:20] that verse it said him free he cried on
[43:21] the phone I still remember him crying on
[43:22] the phone and he's free been free ever
[43:24] since he entered into that freedom
[43:26] through a scripture
[43:28] word of
[43:29] knowledge faith is a substance it's an
[43:32] inner substance it's power it's God's
[43:35] desire and power to move obstacles
[43:37] problems sicknesses
[43:40] adversaries sometimes called mountains
[43:43] metaphorically okay Jesus said the Roman
[43:46] cian's Faith was a great faith it moved
[43:48] the mountain for his servants
[43:51] healing Paul and a crippled man in
[43:53] elisher both had faith for healing
[43:55] causing Paul to L loudly command the man
[43:57] to walk for the first time Faith God's
[44:01] will I know God's will I have a
[44:02] revelation of God's will it's going to
[44:03] move this Mountain's going to move now
[44:05] or it could even be this Mountain's
[44:06] gonna move tomorrow or you know
[44:07] something something powerful right it's
[44:09] Faith it's G to happen right that's you
[44:12] have faith you you have the Revelation
[44:14] you have uh the substance you know
[44:16] because you have the substance you know
[44:17] what's going to happen praise God all
[44:23] right okay this was about Jose and I
[44:26] Jose when we went to pray for that that
[44:28] couple and his family Jose said God
[44:30] heard your prayer and you're going to
[44:31] have a child and I was really nervous in
[44:33] that moment but God God didn't give me
[44:35] that faith God gave Jose that Faith uh
[44:37] the next November that baby was born on
[44:39] my birthday that was Faith he pronounced
[44:42] it right there and I was like I'm really
[44:43] nervous brother Jose Ro crying he's got
[44:44] his acoustic guitar playing I was kind
[44:47] of nervous but God brought it to
[44:50] pass one morning I spoke to that uh
[44:52] mountain of baress and not many days
[44:54] after that I got the text saying we're
[44:57] pregnant and then then they had the baby
[44:59] and then she I said I met her out there

[45:37] we can cast down spirits and and uh the
[45:39] devil gets in your mind people were

[45:43] study I just took it like a took it like
[45:44] a saint I'm like well I'll tell her
[45:46] later I'll share the verse later I just

[45:55] now right God has h their prayers amen
[46:02] hallelujah oh yeah and that one time uh
[46:04] there was a critical couple in this
[46:06] church I stood by their chair on a
[46:07] Saturday a it was after a brother had
[46:09] preached that we can command evil
[46:10] spirits it might have been Brian Hawkins
[46:11] I don't know one of these brothers I I
[46:14] was praying right here on a Saturday and
[46:15] that came to me I thought well I'm going
[46:17] to rebuke that evil spirit I rebuke I
[46:19] went right to their chairs right back
[46:20] there I rebuke that chair in the name of
[46:22] Jesus Christ I command that Spirit to
[46:23] leave 11 days later they left
[46:27] I said it's going to go in the name of
[46:29] Jesus Christ I had Faith to speak it and
[46:32] God backed it
[46:33] up and then one of them repented to me
[46:36] about for five things they did against
[46:38] me God's God's word is always
[46:42] right and then Cam's hunting trip cam
[46:44] told that brother you speak whatever you
[46:46] want he said I want an eight point buck
[46:47] he got it the next day that's Faith Cam
[46:50] said it hasn't happened since cam he
[46:51] keeps he keeps reminding of us though
[46:54] you you don't know what's going to
[46:55] happen you's got to be led by the Holy
[46:58] Spirit now I know for sure cam was
[47:00] really seeking God during that time CU I
[47:01] don't think think he was married yet
[47:03] yeah he wasn't married yet cam was in
[47:05] the word all the time preaching studying
[47:07] he was staying the word of God and God
[47:09] led him to speak that and the brother
[47:11] called him up and said hey brother cam
[47:13] he said uh how you enjoying that eighto
[47:16] buck he said it's it's wonderful brother
[47:18] cam Hallelujah I like that now guess a
[47:21] healing remember uh Saul's mental
[47:23] torment was cast out by David's music
[47:25] that's why music's important
[47:27] right if You' ever been uh delivered
[47:29] from music that's the healing in our our
[47:31] musicians Ministries that's the gift of
[47:34] healing you ever got joy ever got
[47:36] Victory ever got peace through the song
[47:37] that's the gift of
[47:39] healing you can also be healed naturally
[47:41] I wonder how many times my wife has help
[47:43] me with this because figs were used to
[47:45] heal boils in Ezekiel I'm sorry in 2
[47:47] Kings 20:7 and Isaiah
[47:50] 38:21 sometimes there's a natural
[47:51] healing through uh you know God's
[47:55] plans Jesus said said lay hands on the
[47:57] sick and they shall recover that's a way
[47:59] for
[48:03] healing two women I prayed for that said
[48:06] they couldn't move their arms after I
[48:08] prayed for them uh said they could
[48:10] brother Jim told me about one of them
[48:11] and then the sister that was here always
[48:13] can never remember her name Tanya thank
[48:15] you I know I can never
[48:17] remember she's like brother Jesse I love
[48:19] your preaching but I just want to keep
[48:20] cutting my hair she said I like having
[48:21] short
[48:23] hair she said I know it's the word of
[48:25] God but I just want to have short hair I
[48:27] said well sister just pray about it and
[48:29] we see what happen is that is that
[48:31] something they know it people know it
[48:32] Church
[48:34] know you know that was really sweet of
[48:36] her to drive all that but you know comes
[48:39] down it comes down to the word you love
[48:40] the word or don't you love the
[48:46] word okay you you know most of these um
[48:50] get some Miracles is something that
[48:51] happens immediately casting out demons
[48:54] is called a miracle in Mark 83839 I've
[48:56] seen that at least seven I think six
[48:58] times I always get that number mixed
[49:00] up um Jesus caused a lame man to walk
[49:03] and leap by the hand of Peter and John
[49:05] in Acts three handkerchiefs that are
[49:08] given out and healing comes uh that's
[49:11] Acts 19 11 through2 that's called a
[49:13] miracle a special Miracle the Bible
[49:14] calls that my mother was healed of
[49:17] cancer when my dad rebuked the the
[49:18] spirit there she still alive
[49:21] today uh praying for that sick woman in
[49:24] Guyana I prayed for her and the the um
[49:26] the kidney stone instantly left as she
[49:28] sat back there and held her baby and
[49:29] praised the Lord and she come up so
[49:31] happy crying weeping after the
[49:33] service prophecy is foretelling the
[49:35] future brother brandom says if there's
[49:37] no prophet in the land he said God will
[49:39] give you prophecies through
[49:40] dreams right dreams and also just a word
[49:44] from the Lord like I believe the Lord is
[49:45] going to do this I believe this is and
[49:47] you don't have to say thus sayth the
[49:48] Lord you can say this is from the
[49:50] Lord and then if it comes to pass it's a
[49:52] prophecy now for us most time it's going
[49:54] to be a dream
[49:58] all right Jesus for told Peter's three
[49:59] denials agabus prophesied of a famine
[50:03] and don't forget we're coming up on
[50:04] another election in 2020 all those
[50:05] preachers said Trump was going to win
[50:07] with thus sayi the Lord and they all
[50:08] missed it Liars false prophets now I'm
[50:13] going to listen to him hopefully I'm
[50:13] gonna listen to him in the next few
[50:14] months here and I know exactly what they
[50:16] say probably be the opposite now
[50:18] probably right probably because God
[50:20] might I mean they got a 50%
[50:23] chance right a clock's right at least
[50:25] twice a day my wife says clocks r at
[50:27] least twice a day right it' be it'd be a
[50:31] good deception too J it'd be a good
[50:33] deception for that uh last day deception
[50:35] the
[50:36] Antichrist remember they're all going to
[50:39] unite through music remember uh remember
[50:42] uh Shad M abedo what was it music
[50:44] they're all going to have the same
[50:45] Christian music right they're all G
[50:48] that's how they're all that's they're
[50:49] already uniting that
[50:50] way
[50:52] right maybe I should say that maybe I'll
[50:54] hold
[50:55] the that Brandon Lake thing my brother
[50:57] went to a Brandon Lake and Phil Wickam
[50:59] concert and my brother said Brandon Lake
[51:01] was Pro LGB whatever QT whatever that
[51:06] scares me so we got to
[51:10] pray got to pray for people like that
[51:12] that's if you accept that the Bible says
[51:14] you have a reprobate
[51:17] mind that means a rejected mind now can
[51:20] God deliver of course we we remember we
[51:22] had uh MJ come he got
[51:24] delivered I don't know why he stopped I
[51:26] I keep texting him he never text me back
[51:28] probably change his number but we have
[51:31] to be mindful of those things
[51:34] mindful uh Philip had four virgin
[51:36] daughters who
[51:38] prophesied and in 2013 a pastor friend
[51:41] of mine to foretold the passing of the
[51:43] way of numerous preachers he said
[51:44] there'll be many uh well-known preachers
[51:47] in the message passed away that year I
[51:48] think there was four of the biggest
[51:50] names in the message Joseph Coleman
[51:52] Lonnie
[51:54] Jenkins couple others I can't remember
[51:56] now
[51:57] might have been Perry green might have
[51:59] been some of the biggest names of the
[52:00] message that
[52:01] year
[52:04] died and then my wife and I have we
[52:08] believe have had prophetic dreams that
[52:10] came to pass almost exactly or uh
[52:13] spiritually
[52:15] symbolically like I told you about the
[52:17] guy uh about tennis and games and then I
[52:20] told him about it and then I it was a
[52:23] spiritual dream with symbol spiritual
[52:24] symbolism but then naturally he's there
[52:26] on Facebook playing tennis with his
[52:28] shirt off his wife is sexy dressed after
[52:30] leaving the message like look like
[52:32] wearing a bikini and left the message
[52:34] and I told him Advance it's going to
[52:36] happen my wife told his sister are
[52:38] you're going to cut your hair and wear
[52:39] your pants or was it just pants shorts
[52:41] shirts she laughed about it said oh I'll
[52:43] never wear shorts few years later she's
[52:45] wearing
[52:46] shorts and really in almost insane
[52:49] almost insane see it just takes we just
[52:51] got to stay true to the Holy Spirit I'll
[52:53] say like this you got to have the
[52:54] courage to tell somebody when you have a
[52:56] dream like
[52:57] I've told people dreams that I was
[52:59] shaking when I told them now they
[53:01] haven't come to pass yet so I don't know
[53:02] if they're right or not but I dream of a
[53:04] precious brother doing something really
[53:05] awful I had to tell
[53:07] him I I don't know I hope it don't come
[53:09] to pass but I prayed about it I fast
[53:11] about it wait on the Lord see that's a
[53:13] spirit of what Spirit of
[53:15] Prophecy right and if you don't know
[53:17] just say I don't know this is just what
[53:19] happened I'm just saying it
[53:21] humbly now Discerning of spirits that's
[53:24] judging where the where the word comes
[53:26] from is it from God or from Satan that's
[53:29] that's what discernment is Salon used
[53:31] discernment to reveal the good
[53:32] intentions of the real mother of the
[53:34] baby when another woman falsely claimed
[53:35] it to be the mother right he he judged
[53:38] the spirits he gave a word and that word
[53:40] judged which side they were on Jesus
[53:43] discerned Nathaniel's guess Spirit and
[53:46] the woman at the Well's sexual
[53:47] immorality with six men Jesus discerned
[53:50] that go get your husband I don't have
[53:52] any I know how many you had six right
[53:54] the one you're living with now is I'm
[53:55] sorry you had five the one you're living
[53:57] with now not not your husband see he he
[54:00] discerned it he judged it Peter
[54:02] exercised discernment by by revealing
[54:04] anan's secret lie and Simon the
[54:06] sorcerer's Wicked heart condition Peter
[54:08] discerned
[54:11] that Paul says Sinners will recognize
[54:13] God's spirit is in a local church when
[54:15] the secrets are revealed through the
[54:17] gifts of Prophecy interpretation and
[54:18] discernment amen glory
[54:21] amen when we have these preachers come
[54:23] in and it discerns a situation or
[54:25] discerns something going on church we
[54:26] can say the spirit of God is
[54:29] here amen
[54:32] hallelujah that's how I know that's
[54:34] that's how I'll just say like that's how
[54:35] I can keep coming back to church and
[54:36] being a pastor of a small church because
[54:38] I know God's spirit is with
[54:39] me because those that come against me
[54:42] not every time but almost every time
[54:44] their Folly is
[54:46] exposed that's why sometimes I'll tell
[54:48] you about it so you know right and then
[54:52] I'll tell you all the good things too
[54:53] amen the hard things aren't always the
[54:55] fun things to talk about
[54:57] but it proves it judges which side
[55:00] you're on praise God Amen it judges the
[55:03] spirit of truth because that's the Holy
[55:04] Ghost
[55:05] Hallelujah Spirit of Truth like I said
[55:09] you know how many miracles do you need
[55:11] uh until you have enough until you have
[55:13] enough
[55:14] Supernatural how how many do you
[55:17] need see what you need is the spirit of
[55:19] Truth and then God will give you as many
[55:21] miracles as he wants you to have praise
[55:23] God but if you don't have the spirit of
[55:25] truth then you just got gifts and you
[55:27] might be lost you might not be
[55:29] saved because if you're saved you'll
[55:31] obey the word of God hallelujah and
[55:34] you'll stand with the spirit of truth I
[55:35] didn't mean to preach like this this God
[55:36] I think it's 8 o'clock so I'm about
[55:39] done
[55:46] by okay and then we've had dreams in our
[55:48] church that discern certain situations
[55:51] very
[55:53] helpful and then other other other
[55:55] dreams
[55:57] uh and Discerning people's Spirits right
[56:00] we've had other things like that I'm not
[56:01] going to get into that one too much of
[56:03] now diverse kind of tongues and
[56:04] interpretation those are the nine gifts
[56:06] so is that a good review by God's grace

[56:39] peace right was that six years that's a
[56:43] pretty good season I'll take six years
[56:44] of peace and love and happiness and
[56:46] God's love and joy and everybody dancing

[57:33] had all this backsliding sermon but I'm
[57:35] going to save that for Sunday by God's
[57:37] grace now brother R preaches he he does
[57:41] an altar call he tells that story of the
[57:43] King's son that I shared last week he
[57:45] closes with that he's done preaching at
[57:47] an hour
[57:49] 27 um but there's still 48 minutes left
[57:52] so he does the altar call he sings for
[57:53] 13 minutes and then for the last last 26

[57:58] discernment in Luke I'm sorry in John 1
[58:00] with with Nathaniel in John 4 with um
[58:03] the woman at the well and he's getting
[58:05] the people ready because he's going to
[58:07] do discernment back at the Brandon

[58:11] while and so he's teaching the people
[58:13] again about how discernment
[58:15] Works Hallelujah and he he goes to how
[58:18] Jesus the high priest of our confession
[58:20] the woman at the well story who touched
[58:21] me story in other words you're you're

[58:32] Jesus she already had the Revelation
[58:34] amen see that and what is that that's a
[58:37] gift of faith there it is there it is

[58:51] it's a revelation gift of
[58:54] faith and then at the 2 hour and six
[58:57] minute Mark brother brother said I only
[58:59] want strangers to pull on the gift for
[59:01] discernment and he says I'm stalling
[59:03] because I'm waiting for him because it's
[59:05] a different anointing than preaching
[59:07] discernment was a different
[59:10] anointing and that and that at the two
[59:13] hour and seven minute mark one minute
[59:14] before it's over he says the angel is
[59:16] here the angel of the Lord is here then

[59:46] people get
[59:47] healed how many thankful for God's
[59:50] grace brother Ram had an angel just like
[59:53] Moses had an angel commissioned by an
[59:54] Angel and Paul had an
[59:57] angel that angel was commissioned to be
[1:00:00] with them because they were messengers
[1:00:01] of the Covenant amen hallelujah how was
[1:00:04] brother a messenger of the Covenant God

[1:00:12] restoring the promises of the New
[1:00:14] Testament Covenant at the end time he's
[1:00:16] restoring the New Testament Faith he's
[1:00:18] finishing the mystery of God he's

[1:00:32] for his grace I hope something was said
[1:00:35] tonight as I as just before I came out
[1:00:37] here I felt that was the direction God
[1:00:39] wanted me to go with gifts because we
[1:00:41] had it preached to us this last
[1:00:43] weekend don't put pressure on yourself
[1:00:45] for a certain gift but yes it's a good
[1:00:48] idea to seek God for a gift right covet
[1:00:50] earnestly the best gifts pray God send
[1:00:53] us a prophecy God give us a a
[1:00:55] discernment God give us a a a
[1:00:58] healing those things are good to seek
[1:01:02] after we just don't want to say God I
[1:01:05] have to have this I have to be this type
[1:01:08] of person with this much money I have to
[1:01:10] be I have to be this go to this big
[1:01:12] church or something like that just be
[1:01:14] thankful that God saved you praise God
[1:01:17] and just be open to saying God make me
[1:01:18] whatever you want me to be no matter how
[1:01:21] famous or how little I
[1:01:23] am you know and I hear these famous
[1:01:25] messages preachers they say it's not all
[1:01:27] easy all the
[1:01:29] time the more influence you have also
[1:01:32] the more responsibility you
[1:01:34] have
[1:01:39] right I think we understand by God's
[1:01:41] grace how many understand let's bow our
[1:01:43] hearts here as we
[1:01:44] pray oh just a wonderful atmosphere I
[1:01:46] appreciate everybody having a good
[1:01:47] atmosphere and pulling on the word of
[1:01:48] God nobody fell asleep tonight nobody's
[1:01:51] uh giving me smirks nobody's uh nobody's
[1:01:55] staring me down with Angry Eyes like
[1:01:56] I've had sometimes in the past so I
[1:01:58] appreciate that and that's when God's
[1:01:59] spirit can really move just in the
[1:02:02] Simplicity Jesus said if two or three
[1:02:04] are there there I am in the midst Jesus
[1:02:07] Christ is here
[1:02:08] tonight I believe with all my heart
[1:02:10] father God we thank you for today Lord
[1:02:12] God thank you for this opportunity Lord
[1:02:13] we trust in God our
[1:02:15] savior the one who will never fail us
[1:02:18] Lord God lord I've been here at the post
[1:02:20] of Duty 18 years I've never seen you
[1:02:22] fail
[1:02:23] me Lord nothing could ever fail Lord if
[1:02:27] you're behind it Lord
[1:02:29] God usually Lord I just got to wait for
[1:02:31] your time and season there are times I
[1:02:33] failed you Lord so I know I've always
[1:02:35] asked forgiveness for that Lord God but
[1:02:36] I know you have never failed
[1:02:40] Hallelujah Lord help our hearts to be so
[1:02:43] humble tonight that we don't try to get
[1:02:45] the gift that we
[1:02:46] want or get the certain social status or
[1:02:49] financial status that we
[1:02:51] want help us to covet the best gifts and
[1:02:55] help us to covet the perfect will of
[1:02:58] God lord and now remember godliness with
[1:03:01] contentment is a great victory in our
[1:03:03] lives character is not a gift Glory
[1:03:06] character is a
[1:03:10] victory and power without character is
[1:03:12] satanic gifts without the right
[1:03:15] character could be
[1:03:16] satanic like balum we can clearly see
[1:03:18] with
[1:03:19] balum yes his gifts operated but the
[1:03:22] gifts also led him into this position of
[1:03:24] teaching false things
[1:03:26] the doctrine of balum to the Israelites
[1:03:28] to get them to commit fornication so so
[1:03:31] Lord you'd have to punish
[1:03:34] them his gifts help let him lead him
[1:03:36] astray Lord God oh Lord God help us Lord
[1:03:39] Jesus to never make ourselves a stuff sh
[1:03:43] to try to exalt ourselves into some
[1:03:44] ministry that's not ours Lord
[1:03:47] God but help us also Lord to covet the
[1:03:50] best
[1:03:51] gifts as the scripture tells us we know
[1:03:54] your prophet pointed us to the word of
[1:03:57] God he wasn't perfect but in his major
[1:04:00] doctrines and many minor doctrines Lord
[1:04:02] he pointed us directly to the word of
[1:04:04] God which I'm thankful for Lord God I
[1:04:06] always be thankful for it my life is
[1:04:07] based upon that Lord God the prophet of
[1:04:10] God pointing us back to the scripture
[1:04:12] fulfilling Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 ma
[1:04:15] Matthew 17:11 Hallelujah glory to God
