[0:05] 2 Chronicles 28 verse 24.
[0:09] Then uh girls perhaps do some reading
[0:11] tonight for me. See how that goes by the
[0:13] grace of God. 2 Chronicles 28:24.
[0:26] So, this is a little topic I'm going to
[0:27] call uh the abandoned temple. I put out
[0:30] a video about this last week, but I
[0:31] never really preached it.
[0:34] But the abandoned temple. So, this is in
[0:36] the Old Testament
[0:38] where we see the house of God was
[0:40] totally shut and closed and it was
[0:44] completely abandoned.
[0:46] 2 Chronicles 28:24.
[1:07] Hallelujah. So, let's read this one if
[1:09] we can. On three. One, two, three. And
[1:11] Ahaz gathered together the vessels of
[1:15] the house of God and cut in pieces the
[1:18] vessels of the house of God and shut up
[1:22] the doors of the house of the Lord and
[1:25] he made him altars in every corner of
[1:28] Jerusalem. Let's have a word of prayer.
[1:30] Let's bow our heads here tonight. Father
[1:32] God, we're thankful for the word of God
[1:33] here tonight. Thankful for the songs we
[1:35] can sing. Thank you, Jesus. You dropped
[1:36] the charges. Lord, you forgave all of
[1:39] our sins. Lord, if we truly confess,
[1:41] then you truly forgave each and every
[1:43] sin. We're thankful for that by the
[1:45] grace of God. Lord, we look to the Holy
[1:47] Spirit here tonight. Lord, I just kind
[1:48] of felt an uncction to preach this here.
[1:50] I trust it to be a blessing to your
[1:52] people. And so, Father, help us here,
[1:54] Lord, for the glory of God's sake, God.
[1:56] Let your spirit minister to the needs of
[1:58] your people. And Lord, uh may we never
[2:00] abandon you, Lord God. Hallelujah. May
[2:03] we stay with you, Lord God, through
[2:05] thick and thin, we'd say, through the
[2:06] fiery trials of life, as the scripture
[2:08] tells us, Lord God. The test of faith,
[2:11] Lord God.
[2:13] the temptations, the trials, Lord, that
[2:15] we go through, Lord, when we're
[2:16] surrounded by fears within and fears
[2:18] without, as Paul said. Lord, may we stay
[2:21] with you, stay with your word. May we
[2:23] not abandon you, but Lord, may we run to
[2:25] you, Lord. And we know you'll never
[2:26] abandon us, Lord. For you said you would
[2:28] never leave us nor forsake us. So,
[2:31] Father, we give you all the glory
[2:32] tonight. Help me, Lord, and help your
[2:33] people by the Holy Ghost. We ask it in
[2:35] Jesus Christ's name. And the saint said,
[2:38] "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[2:39] seated. Praise God.
[2:43] So, we want to look at this here
[2:45] tonight. Trust us to be a little simple
[2:48] Bible study here. And we'll ask the
[2:50] children here to help us out.
[2:53] I think most of us are pretty familiar
[2:55] with the scriptures that tell us about
[2:57] uh
[2:59] going to church. But if not, let's read
[3:01] a couple. So, let's get uh uh nature.
[3:04] You want to get uh Luke 4:16.
[3:09] And then Caris, you want to get Hebrews
[3:11] 10:24 and 25.
[3:15] Victoria,
[3:17] let's see. What's the other one I was
[3:19] thinking of?
[3:23] Oh, yeah. Victoria, Acts 20 verse 7.
[3:30] So, we look at uh three portions of
[3:33] scripture that clearly show us we should
[3:36] uh gather more together as we see that
[3:38] day approaching.
[3:41] Brother Chris,
[3:44] yeah, that's the title for today. I'm
[3:45] just going to do a little Bible study on
[3:46] the abandoned temple uh to show just a
[3:49] type of the temple being abandoned the
[3:51] Old Testament and then it kind of
[3:53] represents how people abandon the house
[3:55] of God today.
[3:58] God bless you, Sarah. Good to see you.
[4:01] All right, so we'll start here just with
[4:02] the foundation of how we should gather
[4:04] more and assemble in church more as we
[4:06] see that day approaching. Here's what
[4:08] the video looked like I put out last
[4:10] week. That was the cover for it. I don't
[4:11] know. Did anybody see that by God's
[4:12] grace? Anybody watch that? All right.
[4:14] Good. Well, that's all right. Yeah.
[4:15] Amen. Then I can preach it. If you are
[4:16] nobody saw, then I can preach it. I kind
[4:19] of felt led to look at this one here
[4:20] tonight. uh some nature. Uh Luke 4:16,
[4:24] Jesus, in this verse, Jesus always
[4:26] attended the synagogue. Now, the
[4:28] synagogue was like a little church that
[4:31] they would go to to hear the law of
[4:33] Moses uh when they couldn't make it to
[4:35] the temple, and they would gather there
[4:36] weekly. Three times a year, they had to
[4:39] go to the temple, uh especially the
[4:41] males, especially in the Old Testament.
[4:43] But when they didn't go to the the the
[4:45] temple or the tabernacle of Moses back
[4:47] in the days of Moses, they'd go to the
[4:49] synagogue. Uh, so nature, you want to
[4:51] read that? Luke 4:16.
[5:05] Amen. So Jesus's custom or his habit or
[5:09] his religious tradition which was godly
[5:12] was to go to the synagogue and then they
[5:14] would read the law of Moses. So Jesus
[5:16] always went to church. You know why he
[5:18] went to church? because his father asked
[5:20] him to go to church and he was a fully
[5:23] obedient son. Hallelujah. So if you'd
[5:25] have been alive during the days of Jesus
[5:27] and it was Saturday, where was Jesus? He
[5:28] was in the synagogue. Hallelujah. And
[5:31] remember even when traveling on the
[5:32] Sabbath when after he leave the
[5:34] synagogue, remember sometimes he'd walk
[5:35] through the fields and they'd pick corn.
[5:37] So sometimes they have to eat, they
[5:39] would didn't have food, so have to pick
[5:40] corn. And the Pharisees, they found
[5:42] something wrong with that, right? They
[5:43] they they were always trying to find
[5:44] something wrong with him. But they
[5:45] couldn't find it wrong that he went to
[5:47] church. He was always in church.
[5:49] Hallelujah. He was never accused of
[5:50] skipping church. Hallelujah. So Hebrews
[5:53] 10:24 and 25. Uh Caris
[6:15] Amen. So, the Bible says, "Gather more
[6:18] as we see that day approaching." Praise
[6:20] God. Now, we know we're not to gather
[6:21] every single day. Now, we might have to
[6:23] once once the squeeze hits or once the
[6:25] rapture gets near, we might have to do
[6:27] that. Uh but it just means keep this
[6:29] constant gathering together, right? Uh
[6:31] gathering in homes and gathering in the
[6:33] church. And the Bible said when you do
[6:35] that, you provoke one another. Right?
[6:36] Austin and I met yesterday. I felt like
[6:39] a better Christian after we met,
[6:40] brother. I don't know about you, but I
[6:41] felt I felt closer to God. I had a
[6:43] better day today because we met
[6:44] yesterday. Right? Hallelujah. Uh the
[6:46] Bible said when you do that, you
[6:47] provoke. And we use that Old Testament
[6:49] scripture that iron sharpens iron.
[6:51] Right? We get closer to God when we meet
[6:53] together with sincere hearts. As long as
[6:55] our hearts are sincere, we get closer to
[6:57] God every time we gather together.
[6:59] Hallelujah. And exhort means to build
[7:01] up. The Bible said you exhort one
[7:02] another. So you build each other up.
[7:04] That's why we're not to condemn each
[7:05] other. Now if we if somebody sinned
[7:06] against us, you go to them and say,
[7:07] "Brother or sister, you sin against me."
[7:10] But even in that, if as long as they
[7:12] repent, you're actually building each
[7:13] other up, right? You're making things
[7:14] right. You're becoming closer to God,
[7:17] walking closer with God. And so that's
[7:19] what we do. We we come together, we
[7:20] provoke each other, we sharpen each
[7:22] other, and we actually build each other
[7:23] up. Praise God. All right. So, Victoria,
[7:26] Acts 20:7 says that the Paul Paul
[7:30] gathered with the saints and disciples
[7:32] on the first day of the week, which was
[7:33] Sunday. So, you want to read that, uh,
[7:35] Victoria?
[7:50] All right. And he preached till
[7:52] midnight, right? So, uh, Paul gives us
[7:54] the example, we go to church on Sunday,
[7:56] and it's nice. We get a special
[7:57] gathering on Wednesday, right? We don't
[7:58] see that in the Bible, but the Bible
[8:00] doesn't say they worshiped on Wednesday,
[8:02] uh, but we get an extra day to worship
[8:03] the Lord, right? So, that's a blessing
[8:05] for us by God's grace. Now, uh, I want
[8:09] to get to this thought on the abandoned
[8:11] temple, but remember, everything in the
[8:13] Old Testament was written for our
[8:14] learning. So Malachi, you want to read
[8:16] that? 1 Corinthians 10:11.
[8:19] And then I'm going to find another one,
[8:20] brother Austin, for you. I think I can
[8:22] find it in 2 Timothy if I'm not
[8:24] mistaken.
[8:30] Malachi, when you're ready, uh 1
[8:32] Corinthians 10 and it's uh 11.
[8:43] Amen. So Paul's talking about the Old
[8:46] Testament in Israel. They were all
[8:48] written for our examples and our
[8:51] admonition.
[8:53] So our edification, right? Our building
[8:55] up all. So we must learn from the good
[8:57] examples from the Old Testament and we
[8:59] must learn from the bad examples from
[9:01] the Old Testament. Okay. Now let me
[9:03] look. I'm trying to find that all
[9:05] scripture was uh give was God breathed.
[9:07] And that might be in second Timothy. Um,
[9:11] I'm just kind of going off my uh memory.
[9:16] Yeah, there is. Okay, brother Austin,
[9:17] can you can you read 2 Timothy 3
[9:21] uh 15 and 16?
[9:25] 2 Timothy 3
[9:27] 15 and 16.
[9:38] Allure given by inspiration
[9:42] for
[9:47] Amen. Can you read 17 as well, brother?
[9:48] That's a good one, too. The man of God
[9:50] may be perfectly furnished.
[9:53] Amen. Thank you, brother. Praise God.
[9:55] So, two, there's two witnesses. Paul
[9:57] wrote both these, but Paul's saying
[9:58] every single thing in the Old Testament
[10:00] was written, it was inspired by God,
[10:03] right? It was all inspired by God. And
[10:05] this, if we just read the Old Testament,
[10:07] it'll make us wise to salvation.
[10:09] So, you'll get closer. You'll get closer
[10:11] and closer. If you're not saved yet,
[10:12] you'll get closer and closer to being
[10:14] saved. Hallelujah. The more you're in
[10:16] the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[10:18] You got to learn from both. Praise God.
[10:20] It's all it's all good for doctrine,
[10:22] which is instruction for reproof,
[10:24] correction, and how to be more
[10:26] righteous, instruction, and
[10:27] righteousness that you may be perfect or
[10:29] mature.
[10:30] Okay. Now, a few weeks ago, I was I was
[10:32] making a script for a video about u some
[10:35] of the sins coming out of Brandom
[10:36] Tabernacle, which is which is run by
[10:38] Brother Ram's youngest son. And I've
[10:40] reached out to him numerous times to try
[10:42] to help him. But I was I was just I was
[10:44] just writing down at my computer. I was
[10:45] like, "Yeah, that's right. They don't go
[10:46] to church." And I felt like a voice
[10:48] inside of me say I felt like it said,
[10:50] "Where did that ever happen before in
[10:52] the Bible?" And it was just one of those
[10:54] strange moments, one of those God
[10:55] moments. I'm like, so I got out Chat GTP
[10:58] and I said, I said, 'Chat GTP, was there
[11:00] ever a time in the Bible when they
[11:01] closed the temple? And it said, 'Yes,
[11:02] during the days of King Ahaz.
[11:05] I'm like, oh, I'd forgotten about that.
[11:06] I preached that way at the beginning of
[11:08] my ministry 20 years ago, I was
[11:10] preaching that about Hezekiah uh came
[11:12] after Ahaz. And so I started studying
[11:15] it. And as I studied it, I saw all these
[11:17] similarities
[11:19] uh to what Ahaz did to what current
[11:21] bride tabernacle is doing right now.
[11:24] Mhm. And so I thought that, wow, that
[11:26] was such a striking thought to me. I
[11:28] felt it was the Holy Spirit because what
[11:29] would the Holy Spirit always do, church?
[11:31] It'll direct us to the word of God.
[11:34] It'll guide us to all truth. Well, what
[11:35] is truth? Thy word is truth. John 17:1
[11:39] 17 says that sanctify them through thy
[11:41] truth. Thy word is truth. Hallelujah.
[11:45] Okay, so um this is a picture of
[11:48] Solomon's temple if I'm not mistaken. It
[11:49] could be the temple of Herod as well.
[11:51] But we get the idea here uh about
[11:53] Solomon's temple. This is the court of
[11:56] the women. And then you had the outer
[11:58] court. And then in here was the holy
[11:59] place and the holiest of holies. So this
[12:01] is where women could come. Jewish women,
[12:03] Gentiles had to stay. This is the court
[12:04] of the Gentiles outside. But the women,
[12:07] the Jewish women and men could come in
[12:09] here. Sacrifices were made in this
[12:11] court. And then the holiest and the
[12:12] holiest of holies in there. And it was
[12:15] abandoned uh in the 8th century BC. So
[12:18] about uh 700 to 800 years before Christ,
[12:22] it got abandoned by one of the kings,
[12:25] King Ahaz. And now, as I said, current
[12:28] this one is abandoned, except they do a
[12:30] silent prayer meeting on Wednesday
[12:32] night. So they're meeting there tonight,
[12:34] but no singing and no praying out loud.
[12:36] They just go there like quiet little
[12:38] mice, I guess, something like that. It's
[12:41] open on Wednesday night only for for
[12:43] prayer meeting, but there's no singing.
[12:45] Uh there's no out loud prayer. It's
[12:48] silent. It's like a museum,
[12:51] right?
[12:53] No, they canceled them. And then uh they
[12:57] built this addition many millions of
[12:59] dollars a few years ago because they had
[13:01] a thousand people in their congregation.
[13:04] And this is sat empty for at least two
[13:06] or three years because the the pastor
[13:08] doesn't feel led to open the church.
[13:11] Now, we just read all those verses.
[13:13] Based upon those verses we r we read
[13:15] children what do you think should we
[13:17] feel led to gather more as we see that
[13:18] day approaching? Yes. So the spirit of
[13:22] God is leading us to gather more. So
[13:24] what spirit is leading this church to
[13:26] not gather and they haven't gathered for
[13:28] five years. They shut this down in well
[13:31] no that's why they were meeting here in
[13:32] March of 2020 because of COVID. They
[13:35] shut that down and ha even though it's
[13:37] all finished they have not opened it
[13:39] back up yet. So, what spirit is leading
[13:42] them to not gather more as we see that
[13:44] day approaching when the Bible tells us
[13:46] to gather more? Does everybody see what
[13:47] we're talking about? Like, it's so
[13:49] simple, right? It's it's either one or
[13:50] the other. It's either the right spirit
[13:51] or the wrong spirit. The It's the wrong
[13:54] spirit. The wrong spirit tells you not
[13:57] to gather more as you see that day
[13:58] approaching. Remember, we preached on
[14:00] that series of isolation a few years
[14:02] ago. The devil always wants to isolate
[14:04] you away from other believers because
[14:06] those are the ones that are going to
[14:07] sharpen you and make you more like
[14:08] Christ.
[14:10] And Satan doesn't want you to get better
[14:11] as a Christian. Satan wants you to get
[14:13] worse. Want you he wants you to try to
[14:14] quit and he wants you to abandon the
[14:17] people of God. It's just like years ago.
[14:19] I don't know if you remember that video
[14:20] Malachi and Lydia. I show that video
[14:22] where a wolf came in and started
[14:24] attacking a bunch of sheep. You remember
[14:25] that? And what did the wolf do? The wolf
[14:28] will run around until one of them gets
[14:29] away from all the others. And then the
[14:32] wolf will jump on the one that's uh
[14:34] that's uh separated and isolated from
[14:37] everybody else. Well, that's what Satan
[14:39] does, right? Satan will wait till
[14:41] somebody's isolated and then they'll uh
[14:43] then he'll attack them and of course try
[14:45] to take all their spiritual life, you
[14:47] know, because it's not a natural thing.
[14:48] It's a spiritual thing. But that's what
[14:50] Satan likes to do. And then the people
[14:52] abandon the the the people that are in
[14:54] their snares, they abandon the church.
[14:56] They abandon the house of God oftentimes
[14:59] physically. Hallelujah. All right. Now,
[15:03] that's what it currently looks like.
[15:04] Last summer, we out there. Uh, Victoria
[15:06] and Caris and I were out there. I took a
[15:08] picture. I don't think I can zoom in,
[15:10] can I? No,
[15:12] I guess I No, I can't do that. Okay,
[15:15] it's not showing what I was what I'm
[15:17] seeing. So, I mean, they got a beautiful
[15:18] playground. Man, I mean, there's over
[15:21] five I think there's over 300 or 400 uh
[15:24] spaces for cars to park in the beautiful
[15:26] brand new paved parking lot and nobody
[15:28] uses it. I thought abandoned. Has that
[15:31] ever happened before in the Bible? Yes,
[15:34] it has. Amen. So, uh, here's a list of
[15:38] the kings. I know you can't see it, but
[15:39] I can get this if you want to copy, but
[15:41] Ahaz is down here. I'll zoom in later.
[15:43] So, he was the 3, four, five, 6, 7, 8,
[15:46] 9, 10, 11, 12. The 12th king uh after
[15:50] Solomon in Judah, because remember after
[15:53] Solomon died, uh, Israel was divided
[15:55] into two parts, right? Northern Israel
[15:57] and Judah was the southern part. Okay?
[16:00] So the northern the northern kings never
[16:03] had one good king,
[16:06] right? But Judah had numerous good
[16:08] kings, okay? Like Asa, Jehoshaphat,
[16:13] Joash, I'm no, I'm sorry. They were in
[16:15] between. Uh Hezekiah, and Josiah, they
[16:19] had a few good kings in Judah, but not
[16:21] many. Okay. And so Ahaz is right here.
[16:26] And notice they got not so good, not so
[16:27] good. Well, some bad ones. Wow. There's
[16:29] a long time between a good one and
[16:31] another good one between Jehoshaphat and
[16:34] Hezekiah.
[16:36] There's a lot of not good and in between
[16:38] ones.
[16:40] But that's where Ahaz Now we come to
[16:41] days of Ahaz. Now notice it's been a
[16:43] long time since they've had a good king.
[16:46] So what does that mean? They've had a
[16:47] lot of years of lukewarmness where their
[16:50] sins weren't being confessed.
[16:52] Hallelujah.
[16:54] All right. And so uh here's just a
[16:57] summary. He was the evil king who
[16:58] reigned during the 8th century. So about
[17:00] 700 years before Christ, he was king of
[17:04] Judah. He was the only son of King
[17:06] Jotham and the father of Hezekiah. His
[17:08] reign is described in several places in
[17:10] the Old Testament. He's especially known
[17:11] for idolatry, making alliance with
[17:13] Assyria, and desecrating the temple of
[17:16] the Lord. And here's the key verses.
[17:18] Okay, now if you got your Bibles, let's
[17:20] all turn there. Everybody got their
[17:21] Bible? Let's all go to second uh Kings
[17:23] 16. Then we can read some of these. I
[17:25] think it's virtue's turn. a virtue. Can
[17:27] you get 2 Kings 16? Everybody else, you
[17:29] can go there. But if you want to go to 2
[17:31] Chronicles 28, you can do that, too.
[17:34] So, 2 Kings 16,
[17:42] Kings, Kings, Chronicles, and
[17:43] Chronicles. 2 Kings 16 1-4.
[17:56] All right. Uh, virtue, how you doing?
[18:02] Second Kings 16:1. I'll start reading
[18:04] and then you can pick up when I get
[18:05] there. So, verse one. In the 17th year
[18:07] of Pika, I'm not sure if I say that
[18:09] right. The son of Remaliah, Ahaz, the
[18:12] son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to
[18:14] reign. 20 years old was Ahaz when he
[18:17] began to reign. And he reigned 16 years
[18:19] in Jerusalem and did not that which was
[18:22] right in the sight of the Lord his God
[18:24] like David his father. We've been
[18:25] looking at David, right? Was David
[18:26] perfect? Not by any means. But did he
[18:29] want a perfect heart with God? Yes.
[18:33] Okay. Uh verse three, Richard, you got
[18:36] it. Okay.
[18:50] heathen
[18:52] for whom?
[18:58] All right. Very good. So, he he had one
[19:01] of his sons aborted, we'd say today.
[19:03] That's the equivalent for today. But he
[19:05] had one of his sons burned in the fires
[19:07] to a false god. That's how much he was
[19:10] into false gods,
[19:13] right? And then verse four, and he
[19:15] sacrificed and burnt incense in the high
[19:17] places and on the hills and under every
[19:20] green tree. So that was an abomination.
[19:22] God hated when he gave up his son to the
[19:24] gods. Right? God hates when anyone
[19:27] mistreats a child, right? Didn't Jesus
[19:28] say it'd be better that a millstone was
[19:31] hung around your neck and tossed in the
[19:32] sea than to offend one of these
[19:34] children? Right? So God hates it when
[19:37] people mistreat children or take their
[19:40] lives.
[19:42] Okay? And so then he made every he shut
[19:44] the doors of the temple, but he made
[19:46] every uh tree and all the all the trees
[19:50] in the land. He made them basically
[19:51] places for idol worship and for uh
[19:54] basically God's name to be defiled, we'd
[19:57] say. Okay. Now, let's go to 2 Chronicles
[19:59] 28 verse 1-4. Brother Chris, can you get
[20:02] that, brother? 2 Chronicles 28. And
[20:06] could you read uh 1-4, brother? Would
[20:09] that be all right?
[20:12] Yes, sir.
[20:27] 2 Chronicles 28.
[20:30] Take your time there, brother. Uh, while
[20:32] he's getting there, I'm going to read
[20:34] verse uh 19. Now, look at the moral
[20:37] look at the moral depravity of this
[20:39] king.
[20:42] For the Lord brought Judah low because
[20:44] of Ahaz, king of Israel. For he made
[20:47] Judah naked.
[20:49] Sound like uh they struggle with modesty
[20:51] in those days,
[20:54] right? Like we got a lot of half- naked
[20:55] women running around today. That see
[20:58] that's today's nothing new. It's all
[21:00] been done before, right? He made Judah
[21:03] naked and transgressed sore against the
[21:06] Lord. So now we know it was a time of
[21:08] immodesty. Okay, brother Chris, you got
[21:11] uh 2 Chronicles 28. Okay. Can you do
[21:14] one, two, three, and four?
[21:56] Thank you, brother. So, here we see not
[21:58] just one child, but children. So, if the
[22:01] Bible said his son and then children,
[22:03] perhaps daughters as well. We don't
[22:05] know. So, church, isn't it just amazing
[22:07] that God spared Hezekiah's life?
[22:10] Hezekiah was his son, but this evil king
[22:13] had basically uh ended the life of
[22:16] numerous children by way of we'd say
[22:19] abortion today or something like that.
[22:21] So this was a very very wicked man.
[22:25] Okay. Now verses uh 22- 25. And notice
[22:30] in this passage when he got in trouble
[22:32] with other nations, he became even more
[22:34] wicked. Now church, when we get in
[22:35] trouble, what should we do? Humble
[22:38] ourselves. go pray, right? Go get in our
[22:41] closet and pray and weep and cry when we
[22:43] sin. That's not how Ahaz was. Ahaz just
[22:46] did more wickedly when he got caught or
[22:48] more wickedly when he got in trouble.
[22:50] Right. Uh verse 22. So I'm going to come
[22:53] back up here to or Lydia, you got it,
[22:55] hun? You got your Bible? So can you read
[22:56] uh 22 23 24 25?
[23:36] Amen. Everybody see that? What were
[23:39] these idols for him? They were the what?
[23:41] The ruin of him. So, he thought these
[23:44] sins and these idols would help him, but
[23:47] they actually were his ruin. Now, let's
[23:49] be honest tonight. Any sin you might
[23:50] struggle with is going to be your ruin.
[23:53] The Bible said it'll be pleasurable for
[23:55] a season, right? It'll feel good for a
[23:58] while, but pretty soon it'll lose all of
[23:59] its pleasure
[24:01] and it will be the ruin of people.
[24:03] Hallelujah.
[24:05] See, things that seem pleasurable now,
[24:07] they don't remain pleasurable and then
[24:09] they they destroy our lives.
[24:13] And then he got so mad, he shut the
[24:15] doors of the house of the Lord. It's
[24:17] kind of like the it's kind of like his
[24:18] final step, his final defiance against
[24:20] God. He shut the doors and wouldn't let
[24:23] people in. And I I thought it was so sad
[24:24] about uh Brandham Tabernacle, you know,
[24:27] uh so church like here like brother
[24:29] Brandham said, brother Brandham said one
[24:30] day the one world system is going to
[24:32] come and shut our doors.
[24:36] But it wasn't even the enemy. It wasn't
[24:37] even the one world system that shut
[24:39] these doors. It was from God's own
[24:41] people, we'd say. How sad is that,
[24:45] right? But that's what happens when
[24:46] people start breaking one word. It's
[24:48] easier to break the next word, the next
[24:50] word, the next word. If there's no
[24:53] repentance, that sin will be the ruin of
[24:56] them. That's right. Now, here's the main
[24:59] part of what I did on the video. So,
[25:00] Malachi, I think we're up to you. Area,
[25:02] are you able to read, hun? Okay.
[25:05] So, they uh what they did was they did
[25:08] idolatry. Now, can you read 2 Chronicles
[25:10] 28 again, verses 2 and 3?
[25:31] Thank you. Now, there's five attributes.
[25:33] The first one is they got into idolatry.
[25:36] Now, the way the current brom tabernacle
[25:38] is idolatry, they say, brotherh, I don't
[25:41] know if you know this, but they say
[25:42] every word brother Brandham said is thus
[25:44] sayith the Lord. That's the idolatry
[25:47] that they they they say it. They say it
[25:49] plainly. They say it on their blog
[25:50] posts. They say it on videos. They say
[25:53] it everywhere. They worship brother
[25:55] Brandham. So that means they're filled
[25:56] with demons,
[25:58] right? Lying demons, idolatrous demons.
[26:02] I want to I want you to here's brother
[26:03] Ram talked about this in 1962. He said
[26:05] there there's some brethren up in
[26:07] Michigan.
[26:09] They're getting scrupled up, which means
[26:10] messed up.
[26:12] He said, 'They claim that I sent them up
[26:14] to Michigan and they're preaching that
[26:16] men should leave their wives and hunt
[26:17] for their spiritual mate. In other
[26:18] words, they're saying it's okay to
[26:19] commit adultery and that I am perfectly
[26:22] infallible and there's oh some of the
[26:25] awful things you ever heard. So, Brother
[26:28] Random said this years ago back in ' 62.
[26:32] It's so it's one of the most awful
[26:34] things you could say that every word is
[26:35] thus sayith the Lord.
[26:38] And yet I sent I sent this quote to the
[26:40] pastor. I don't hear nothing back, but I
[26:43] sent it to him. So, he's he's
[26:44] accountable, right? God's going to hold
[26:46] him accountable. It's And then later on,
[26:49] he calls it Tommy rot, which is just
[26:50] filth. It's filthy to say that one man,
[26:53] Brother Brandham, was perfectly
[26:55] infallible or every word he said was
[26:57] thus sayith the Lord. That's idolatry.
[27:00] Well, no wonder they shut the doors to
[27:02] the house of God, right? The second one,
[27:05] they closed the doors. Okay, we've
[27:06] already gone through that. Uh they have
[27:08] not had in-person service in over five
[27:11] years. Church, how strong would you be
[27:13] if if you didn't see me for five years?
[27:15] How or if I didn't see you for five
[27:17] years? How strong would you be in the
[27:18] faith? Not very strong, right? We see
[27:22] people fall just falling out of our
[27:23] church come into church, right? And they
[27:25] still fall out because they let demons
[27:27] in their lives, right? How much more do
[27:29] we need God's strength and power to stay
[27:31] in the house of God? Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:34] So they have idolatry. They close the
[27:36] temple.
[27:38] Third, they stopped worshiping. And we
[27:40] see this in 2 Chronicles 29:7 when
[27:42] Hezekiah gets back into service. Uh so
[27:46] Malachi, did you read already a second
[27:48] time? Okay. Can you read verse 7? Uh
[27:51] 29:7. 2 Chronicles 29:7.
[28:03] Okay,
[28:06] now that's not the right one. So, I'm
[28:08] sorry. I had to look up the other one.
[28:14] Can anybody seen that chapter where the
[28:16] uh the singers were re
[28:19] uh they were uh restored? Oh, yeah.
[28:23] There it is. I'm sorry, M. Read verse
[28:24] 28. Yeah, I did that one wrong. It's
[28:26] verse 28, not verse 7.
[28:33] All right. So, see, once Hezekiah gets
[28:35] back in, he starts putting singers in
[28:38] there. Worshippers,
[28:40] right? But what happened with Ahaz? He
[28:42] stopped the singing. No more singing,
[28:44] right? No, no, no more worship to
[28:47] Jehovah.
[28:48] And that's what's happened. Like I told
[28:50] you, that's what happens here. They
[28:52] don't meet and it's all silent prayer.
[28:55] There's nobody expressing, "Oh God, we
[28:56] love you. Thank you for your mercy,
[28:58] Jesus. We give you glory. Almighty God,
[29:00] glory, honor. Holy, holy, holy is the
[29:02] Lord God Almighty." It's silenced
[29:06] just like in the days of Ahaz.
[29:09] Hallelujah. Think about that, brother.
[29:11] All those song leaders, they just bury.
[29:13] It's like they took their their shovels,
[29:14] their spiritual shovels, and they buried
[29:16] their singing gifts in the dirt. And all
[29:19] the preachers, they took their preaching
[29:21] gift and they buried it in the dirt and
[29:23] it's not getting any value. They're not
[29:26] growing. They're not getting closer to
[29:28] God. They're not using the gifts God
[29:30] gave them. And what did Jesus call them?
[29:32] He said, "You wicked and lazy servants."
[29:35] Because you didn't use your gifts. God
[29:37] help us to use our gifts. Hallelujah.
[29:40] That's right.
[29:42] So see that it's so important uh to let
[29:45] the worship continue. Now the priesthood
[29:48] was neglected. So brother Austin, could
[29:49] you read verse 11? Yes.
[29:54] 29:11 whenever you got it.
[30:05] Very good. So these are the priests. The
[30:07] priests would cut the animals in the
[30:09] outer court, wash their hands. Then the
[30:11] priest would go in and light the uh the
[30:13] candlestick. the the priests would eat
[30:15] the bread and they would offer the
[30:17] incense the priests. Okay. So what what
[30:21] did uh what what did Ahaz do? The
[30:23] priests were neglecting their ministry.
[30:25] And what does Brandham Tabernacle do?
[30:27] The preachers don't preach. They press
[30:29] play.
[30:31] Right?
[30:33] So the priesthood the preachers are
[30:35] neglecting their preaching gifts.
[30:38] All right. Can everybody see that? Now
[30:40] how many how many believe I was inspired
[30:42] to get this thought? I thought I was
[30:44] inspired because something inside of me
[30:46] asked me, "Did that ever happen in the
[30:47] Bible?" I just felt it come up nature. I
[30:49] can't felt it come up like a like living
[30:51] waters.
[30:53] Hallelujah. Like that's right. I never
[30:55] thought about that. Where that did that
[30:56] happened in the Bible before? Yes, it
[30:59] did. Now, this one's a little bit of a
[31:02] not as a direct one, but I want you to
[31:04] see it anyway. 2 Chronicles 28:19. Uh,
[31:07] nature. Can you get 28:19
[31:12] if you got it? Let's see.
[31:19] That might not be it.
[31:22] Transgress the covenant. That might be
[31:25] wrong. Nature
[31:35] 2 Chronicles. Give me a second here.
[31:37] Seems like once a service I lose track
[31:39] of where we got to find my verse here.
[31:41] 28 or 29. Okay.
[31:47] Okay. We have to do the opposite. Uh we
[31:49] have to do the opposite. So 2 Chronicles
[31:51] 29 nature verse 10 where Hezekiah renews
[31:56] the covenant. Remember a covenant is an
[31:58] oath or a promise.
[32:01] So Ahaz broke the promise and covenant
[32:04] between God and the people. Hezekiah
[32:06] restores the promise. Now how many how
[32:08] many have promised to serve Jesus till
[32:10] you die? Amen. So you and I have a
[32:13] covenant. Praise God. We have a better
[32:15] covenant because Jesus sealed it with
[32:17] his own blood and sent his spirit to
[32:19] help us keep the covenant. Hallelujah.
[32:21] So nature 2 Chronicles 29 verse 10. When
[32:25] you got that?
[32:45] Amen. Praise God. So Hezekiah knows I
[32:48] got to make a promise to God because my
[32:50] dad broke the promise with God. Now what
[32:53] Brandham Tabernacle did and I can I I
[32:56] got the videos if you want to listen to
[32:57] it. Brand Tabernacle said uh the
[32:59] preachers got to catch the vision. They
[33:01] got to play the tapes. He said they're
[33:03] the token and the token is the sign of
[33:06] the covenant. So see how see how Ahaz
[33:10] broke the covenant but Brandham
[33:11] tabernacle has changed the covenant. Now
[33:14] it's not the Holy Ghost. Now it's I
[33:16] pressed play. Now I've got the I've got
[33:17] the Holy Ghost. I mean that is that is
[33:19] so absurd. But that's what they say.
[33:23] They say because they because they got
[33:25] the Holy Ghost the the token of the Holy
[33:27] Ghost they're born again. That's why
[33:28] they press play and the preachers sit
[33:30] down. And exactly the opposite is true
[33:34] because they're wicked and lazy
[33:35] servants. The Bible says they don't use
[33:37] their talent to preach. That's what the
[33:39] Bible says. Hallelujah. All right. Now,
[33:43] I don't know how I'm I'm not going to be
[33:44] very long. I've already preached uh 35
[33:46] minutes, so I'm not going to be too long
[33:48] here tonight. I'm trying to be cautious
[33:50] with Malachi's work schedule like I was
[33:51] when I uh Austin went to work at the
[33:53] factory.
[33:55] Okay. Now, now I'm just going to give
[33:57] you a few general quotes from Brother
[33:59] Brandham. People say I can stay at home
[34:01] and be just as good of a Christian as I
[34:03] can at church. You can't.
[34:07] I said you can't.
[34:10] Hallelujah. That's why I always come to
[34:12] church because I'm not going to be good
[34:14] as a Christian if I stay at home. The
[34:16] Bible said Hebrews 10:24 and2 not
[34:20] forsaken our assembling of ourselves
[34:21] together and that much more as we see
[34:23] the time coming. If you're a Christian,
[34:25] you long to go where other Christians
[34:27] are. So I ask you, are they Christians?
[34:29] if they don't long to go to church.
[34:32] God's going to have to answer that one,
[34:34] right?
[34:38] And fellowship with other Christians.
[34:40] So, you cannot stay away from the church
[34:42] and live the same life.
[34:45] You can't do it because it's like, I'm
[34:47] hungry, but I never go to a table. So,
[34:49] as a Christian, you're hungry to hear
[34:50] the word of God, right? You have to eat
[34:53] or you're going to die, right? In the
[34:54] natural. So, it is in the spiritual.
[34:58] So that so let me ask you again. Are
[35:00] they alive or dead spiritually?
[35:03] If they're not hearing the living men
[35:05] preaching the living word of God, are
[35:07] they alive or dead? According to this
[35:08] quote, according to this quote, they're
[35:09] dead or starving and almost dead.
[35:14] And we have to wonder, are they a
[35:16] Christian? Because Christians can't wait
[35:18] to go to church and see their brothers
[35:19] and sisters.
[35:21] Hallelujah.
[35:23] He says, I just ain't going to do it.
[35:24] Well, you've got to go feed on the word
[35:26] of God and fellowship with one another.
[35:31] We need one another now more than ever
[35:33] we did in each other is now.
[35:36] When you get yourself singled out from
[35:38] the rest of the making yourself just a
[35:40] little different. You don't want to
[35:41] associate with them because they believe
[35:42] this and don't want to associate with
[35:43] that. You're getting on dangerous ground
[35:46] right then keeping away from church
[35:49] because remember Jesus went to church
[35:51] and brother Brandham said they asked
[35:53] brother Bham should I go to churches if
[35:54] if they differ with you brother Brandham
[35:56] and brother Brandham said yes Jesus did
[35:59] and the church said every synagogue
[36:02] Jesus went to do you think they believed
[36:03] he was the Messiah do you think so
[36:05] probably not so did he go to churches
[36:08] that disagree with him yes and that's
[36:10] what brother Ram said yes if you if you
[36:13] don't have a Uh uh if you don't have a
[36:14] church close to you that preaches what
[36:16] brother believes, he said, "Go to it
[36:18] anyhow. Let your light shine." He said,
[36:19] "How do you know you're not sending
[36:21] there to save some souls out of there?"
[36:23] Praise God.
[36:28] Find the one of your choice and remain
[36:30] there. And no, look, remain there. Don't
[36:32] stay at home. And be a Christian,
[36:34] brother, to all of them. All
[36:37] that's the way to be a real Christian.
[36:39] Oh, brother Jess, how do I be a real
[36:41] Christian? Go to church and be a real
[36:43] Christian to other people. Amen.
[36:45] Hallelujah. That's the way to be a real
[36:48] Christian. Then we got to then we got
[36:50] fellowship. We got protection. People
[36:52] love you and pray for you. So see, I
[36:55] appreciate it. When you pray for me, I
[36:57] appreciate it. What am I doing? When you
[36:59] pray for me, God protects me. When I
[37:01] pray for you, God protects you.
[37:04] Hallelujah.
[37:06] That's the success of brother's
[37:08] meetings. He says, "Because real godly
[37:09] people pray for me." Okay, now I'm going
[37:11] to skip because of time. Now, I love
[37:13] this quote. This is right before brother
[37:14] Ram died, one month before he died. He
[37:17] said, "If I lived in a city like Akan
[37:20] and they had nothing there but well,
[37:21] some church." Now, in Akan, we got a
[37:23] message church. He says, "And I don't
[37:25] want to call any name, but just any
[37:27] church. If they only believe one thing,
[37:29] that Jesus was divine, all the rest of
[37:32] it was wrong, I'd go to that church."
[37:35] Amen.
[37:36] If I can't get a whole loaf of bread,
[37:38] I'll take a slice.
[37:40] So, let me ask you, is anybody getting a
[37:43] slice of bread by staying home pressing
[37:45] play? No.
[37:47] They get no fresh bread from the
[37:50] five-fold ministry. Hallelujah.
[37:53] So, are they Christians? Do they have
[37:55] any are they dead? Do they have any
[37:57] food? Seems like no, according to these
[38:01] quotes.
[38:04] See, I'll go listen. I'll worship the
[38:06] Lord. See, you got to go. And you got to
[38:08] listen. And you got to give God praise
[38:10] because God loves to be worshiped.
[38:13] And I'll show him. I'm doing my part.
[38:16] Some people wonder, "Oh, am I doing my
[38:17] part?" Go to church and worship.
[38:20] Do your part for God. Hallelujah.
[38:25] I want him to know I'm alive. Oh, thank
[38:28] God we're alive tonight. We love Jesus.
[38:31] Hallelujah. Amen. I'm alive.
[38:34] I want every everybody to know which
[38:36] side I'm on. I'm on the King's side, the
[38:40] King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[38:44] I assemble with the Christians and their
[38:46] worship and I serve the Lord.
[38:48] Hallelujah.
[38:51] Yes. Brother Brandham, is it true nobody
[38:53] should preach but you? We've seen you
[38:55] ordain men. We don't believe you would
[38:57] do that if they were not to preach
[38:59] because Brandham Tabernacle is saying
[39:01] we're not to preach today. But they
[39:03] asked Brother Brandham, should pre
[39:06] should preachers preach other than you.
[39:08] Mercy, brother, sister ever who told you
[39:11] that nobody's to preach but me. I'd sure
[39:12] be a poor subject to God with all that.
[39:14] No. No. Is Brother Ram the only
[39:17] preacher? No.
[39:19] Every man that feels a call of God upon
[39:22] his life, get into the ministry and
[39:23] start pressing play.
[39:26] No, I didn't read that right. Did I
[39:28] start preaching? We need them.
[39:33] Hallelujah. I love Oh, see, when I press
[39:36] play, I hear a lot different than what
[39:37] they hear when they press play. Church,
[39:40] they don't even hear the spirit. They
[39:41] just listen. They're But they're
[39:43] blinded. They're spiritually blinded.
[39:45] And their ears are spiritually deaf to
[39:47] the word of God.
[39:51] Because that when I press play, Brother
[39:52] Austin, it tells me we need more
[39:54] preachers.
[39:57] Men of God are anointed all over the
[39:59] world to press play. No. To preach the
[40:02] gospel. See, I'm just one little pebble
[40:04] on the beach among many big stones.
[40:06] There's just many more that's more
[40:08] eligible, more worthy, more of anything
[40:11] to preach to me. I'm just one little
[40:12] humble person lay out out there. I'm one
[40:14] grain of wheat and a whole garner. You
[40:16] know what I mean? Any man that's called
[40:18] of God needs to preach the gospel.
[40:21] Hallelujah.
[40:23] I got one more here before I get to the
[40:25] the closing part of this. I'm almost
[40:26] done. Look what Brother Abraham says in
[40:29] the church age book. How careful we must
[40:31] be to hear one voice. And the voice is
[40:34] the Bible. It's the Holy Ghost speaking
[40:36] through the Bible. For the spirit has
[40:39] but one voice. Now notice he doesn't say
[40:41] himself
[40:42] which is the voice of God. Paul warned
[40:45] them to say what he had said even as
[40:46] Peter did likewise. He warned that even
[40:49] he Paul could not change one word of
[40:52] what he'd been given by revelation.
[40:56] Oh, how important is to hear the voice
[40:58] of God by way of his messengers
[41:01] and then say what's been given to them
[41:03] to say to the churches. And there's a
[41:06] quote in 1960. Brother Brandham said,
[41:08] "You preachers are just as much
[41:10] messengers as I am." That's what he
[41:12] says.
[41:13] So, I'm just saying what Brother
[41:15] Brandham said. I'm just as much of a
[41:17] messenger, he said. He said, I'm in this
[41:19] just as much as you are. Brother
[41:20] Brandham says, now we know there's only
[41:22] one church age messenger, but brother
[41:24] Brandham's saying all the preachers are
[41:26] messengers of the message.
[41:30] And church, how many words can we
[41:32] change?
[41:33] Zero. So, somebody show me where Paul
[41:36] said, "We won't need the five-fold
[41:37] ministry in the Leoian church age."
[41:39] Somebody show me that. You're not going
[41:41] to ever show me that because it's not in
[41:42] the Bible. I've already read this cover
[41:44] to cover, church, and I'm going to keep
[41:46] reading it cover to cover so no man can
[41:48] deceive me.
[41:50] Okay? All right. Now, church, hope came
[41:55] in the next generation.
[41:58] Hallelujah.
[42:00] For all those years, the house of God
[42:02] was closed. Is this ever going to
[42:03] change? It's kind of like CO, right? We
[42:05] always wonder, when are we going to get
[42:06] these masks off? When are we going to
[42:09] get back from doing the six feet of uh
[42:11] social distancing? when are they going
[42:13] to open back up the schools and all
[42:15] these things like that? Well, eventually
[42:16] it happened, right? Thank God it wasn't
[42:18] a generation later.
[42:21] But it was in the next generation
[42:24] Hezekiah started restoring the day after
[42:27] his dad died and he became king. That
[42:30] very next day he started opening the
[42:32] church. Hallelujah.
[42:34] So, see, there's hope, church. Even if
[42:37] there's a bad leader, there's hope.
[42:38] Maybe the next generation will get right
[42:41] with God. Hallelujah. Amen. Now church,
[42:43] what does that mean? The day after his
[42:46] dad died, he did the act exact opposite.
[42:48] What does that mean? That means he was
[42:50] waiting for his time.
[42:53] That whole time his dad had closed the
[42:55] church. That means, brother Chris, he
[42:56] was walking by sad like, I can't believe
[42:58] it, but I can't do nothing. I'm not
[43:00] there yet.
[43:02] Ah, but when it became his turn, the
[43:05] very first day he was king, he opened
[43:07] the house of God and he he cleaned out
[43:10] the house of God and he started getting
[43:11] it ready so people could worship again.
[43:14] And church, that's how it is for every
[43:15] believer. When you know what is to do to
[43:18] do right, do as do it as soon as you
[43:20] can.
[43:22] Hallelujah.
[43:24] And church, as you know in this church,
[43:26] if I'm wrong, then the Bible said, "You
[43:28] come to me oneon-one. show me where I'm
[43:30] wrong. And if I don't repent, then you
[43:33] go somewhere else. Hallelujah.
[43:36] That's what Hezekiah did. He waited. He
[43:38] waited till until it was his turn. And
[43:40] then when he got in leadership, well,
[43:42] now you bring the people back to God.
[43:44] And by the help of God, by God's grace,
[43:45] for 19 years, I've tried to point
[43:47] everybody to get right with God.
[43:49] Hallelujah. Serve God, love God, devote
[43:53] your life to the scripture. Give your
[43:54] life to Jesus Christ. Confess all your
[43:56] sins. Do it now. Hallelujah. Amen.
[44:00] Now, we're not going to go through all
[44:02] this,
[44:04] but he was ready and waiting. He
[44:06] couldn't wait to restore worship. And as
[44:08] soon as on day one, he got just like
[44:10] kind of Trump or Biden, you know, the
[44:12] first day they get in to do all those
[44:13] executive orders,
[44:15] right? That's how Hezekiah was. I'm
[44:17] ready. As soon as I get in there, I'm
[44:19] opening the house of God. I'm going to
[44:22] change things. And let me tell it to the
[44:24] young people. Young people, if there's
[44:26] any sin in your family, wait till you
[44:29] get your family, then you can make it
[44:30] right.
[44:32] If your parents got anything wrong, I
[44:34] guess I'm not saying this so much to us,
[44:35] but to the live streamers, right?
[44:39] Once you get your or young adults, as
[44:41] soon as you get your own place, if
[44:42] anything's wrong, you can make it right
[44:44] right there. But I don't think there's
[44:46] anything wrong in my life. But if there
[44:48] was and my children couldn't correct it,
[44:50] then they as soon as they get their own
[44:52] place, then you show God what you
[44:54] believe. Amen. This is probably good for
[44:56] brother Chris, right? Brother Chris, as
[44:58] soon as you get your spot, that's when
[44:59] you can you can lay down all the glory
[45:02] for God. You can you can design your
[45:03] whole life to glorify God. Hallelujah.
[45:06] Right, brother Austin? Amen. There's 45
[45:10] minutes. M already 45 minutes. So, what
[45:12] I'm saying is that if anything's wrong
[45:15] where you are, you wait for your chance.
[45:17] And when it's your chance, you get the
[45:19] people right with God. And God will call
[45:22] you blessed.
[45:24] Hallelujah. God will call you a great
[45:26] king or a great queen. Hallelujah. God
[45:28] will call you a king and priest unto
[45:29] him. He'll say, "Well done, good and
[45:31] faithful servant."
[45:33] So notice, he commands the priest to
[45:35] clean everything up. He makes a covenant
[45:37] with God. He cleanses the temple
[45:39] immediately. And church, I love, go to
[45:41] 29:20. 2 Chronicles 29:20.
[45:45] Look at this man. He was a leader.
[45:51] Then Hezekiah the king rose up early and
[45:54] gathered the rulers of the city and went
[45:56] up to the house of the Lord. So he got
[45:57] up first and said, "You follow me. Let's
[46:00] go to church and clean it up." Praise
[46:01] God.
[46:03] And church, what did he do to go down to
[46:05] verse the last verse of the chapter? Go
[46:06] down to verse 36. Ly, you want to read
[46:08] that? You got it. Okay, I got it. No
[46:10] problem. Verse 36. And Hezekiah rejoiced
[46:13] in all the people that God had prepared
[46:15] the people for the thing was done
[46:18] suddenly. In other words, when you get
[46:20] your chance, do it quickly. Praise God.
[46:24] Hallelujah. If anybody's doing wrong and
[46:26] you can do nothing about it, wait till
[46:28] you get in there. Then you can do
[46:29] something about it. Praise God.
[46:32] Hallelujah.
[46:33] Kind of like when I got first saved, I
[46:35] saw things at the chapel I didn't like.
[46:37] Brother Chris, I went to the chapel and
[46:38] I said, I thought, my why don't they fix
[46:40] that? Well, you know what? Once I became
[46:42] a pastor, now I have no excuses.
[46:46] Right? For example, they would play they
[46:48] would play snippets from movies with
[46:50] cuss words in the service
[46:52] like Fight Club. I don't know if you
[46:54] remember Fight Club by Brad Pitt. They
[46:55] played some of that and there was
[46:56] cussing and they let I'm thinking like
[46:58] what? This should not happen. But you
[47:00] know what? I couldn't change it. But you
[47:01] know what I can do? I can change things
[47:02] now because now it's my time. Now it's
[47:06] my it's my time to rule and reign.
[47:08] Praise God. Spiritually.
[47:11] See that? Then when you get your own
[47:13] place, you can make a you can make your
[47:15] house a sanctuary for God Almighty.
[47:19] That's right.
[47:20] Hallelujah.
[47:23] All right. I'm trying to close my So let
[47:25] me let me ask you this in closing.
[47:29] See, I've been preaching on brand
[47:30] tabernacle, but we got to bring it back
[47:32] to ourselves. It's no good just to
[47:34] preach about other. Yes, we can learn as
[47:36] we said. We can learn from the Old
[47:37] Testament, Ahaz. We can learn from
[47:39] people like Jesus said, "Remember Lot's
[47:40] wife. We can we can learn things from
[47:42] people that fail, but we also got to be
[47:44] accountable to ourselves.
[47:47] Let's not worry about other people so
[47:49] much. Now, let's think about our lives.
[47:52] All right? Because what the Bible say?
[47:55] The Bible says you're the temple now.
[47:58] Amen. So, let me ask you this. Have you
[48:00] ever shut up your temple and not worship
[48:02] God as much as you should?
[48:05] Right?
[48:06] Have you ever denied God any praise or
[48:08] I'm not going to raise my hands? I'm not
[48:10] going to sing. I'm not going to worship.
[48:11] I'm not going to give God glory. I'm not
[48:13] going to testify. Have you ever shut up
[48:14] your uh your temple?
[48:17] So, see church, we can relate to this
[48:19] because we all fall short of God's
[48:20] glory. Amen. We abandon God's temple
[48:24] sometimes, too. Right? In other words,
[48:25] the praise for for from our temple to go
[48:28] out and glorify God. Hallelujah. Now,
[48:32] I've never been guilty of of skipping
[48:34] church and staying at home. I've never
[48:35] been guilty of that. But I have been
[48:36] guilty of maybe not testifying when I
[48:38] should have. Right? Or maybe I've been
[48:41] guilty of not praising God with with
[48:43] real sincerity in my heart like I should
[48:45] have. Hallelujah.
[48:48] Right? We've all been guilty where the
[48:51] temple of God is not in the right
[48:52] condition. But thank God we can change
[48:55] it. We can bring out the spiritual
[48:57] Hezekiah. Oh, it's time for revival in
[49:00] my life. Amen. Oh, Hezekiah brought
[49:03] revival. Remember the church? He stomped
[49:05] out the He stomped out the idols to dust
[49:07] and then he threw the dust in the in the
[49:09] river. He got rid of every trace of sin
[49:12] in the camp and the church said, "Amen."
[49:15] That's what we got to do. Get rid of
[49:17] every trace of sin in our lives. Then
[49:19] we're going to have revival. Hallelujah.
[49:22] Now, church, what does the word grieve
[49:24] mean? To offend. So, we abandon God
[49:26] sometimes because we offend the Holy
[49:28] Spirit. And what do we do? Lying offends
[49:31] the Holy Spirit.
[49:33] anger that's not uh you can be angry and
[49:35] sin not. But anger where you're upset
[49:38] with somebody and it's it's not
[49:40] justified. That's sin.
[49:44] You can if you you can be angry like you
[49:46] can be angry at somebody that uh well
[49:48] you can be angry at the politicians that
[49:49] allow abortions, right? Because that's
[49:51] justified.
[49:53] But you don't act on it, right? You
[49:54] don't you don't say evil words and you
[49:56] don't you don't wish evil against them.
[49:57] But you can be angry at the sin,
[50:00] right? But when you start acting on it,
[50:02] call them names or all kinds of things,
[50:04] that's when you get wrong.
[50:07] Stealing, hallelujah,
[50:11] stealing grieves the Holy Spirit of God.
[50:13] Corrupt words, bitterness against other
[50:15] people, and wrath against other people.
[50:18] All those things offend the Holy Ghost.
[50:20] And then the temple of God is abandoned.
[50:22] It's not giving the worship it give.
[50:26] Everybody with me?
[50:28] 1 John 2 uh9. Uh Caris, you want to get
[50:31] that? 1 John 21:19. That's our last one,
[50:34] I think. Yep. Because I used this slide
[50:36] uh back in February with our brother
[50:38] because it's it was just in the same
[50:40] file.
[50:43] 1 John 21:19.
[50:45] And so, see friends, if brothers and
[50:48] sisters, if we don't confess these, we
[50:49] will physically leave the church because
[50:51] we just saw that.
[50:53] Just saw that in February. If we don't
[50:55] confess, we'll grieve the Holy Spirit.
[50:57] so much that God will say get that
[50:59] leavenan out from among you that you can
[51:01] be a new church a new love
[51:03] right and what then see when when they
[51:05] spiritually abandon God's temple then we
[51:08] have to physically remove them from
[51:10] God's temple any Bible reader knows that
[51:13] uh I want to read that caris go ahead 1
[51:15] John 21:19
[51:23] I'm sorry hun it's first John that's the
[51:26] gospel Gospel of John. Sorry. Did I say
[51:28] John? If I did, I'm sorry. First John,
[51:31] I'm sorry. 219.
[51:43] You know what? Before you read that,
[51:44] I'll read 18. Little children, it is the
[51:46] last time. Now, look at it. Was the last
[51:47] time 2,000 years ago. Where are we at
[51:49] today?
[51:51] Right? That means the last 2,000 years.
[51:53] Because the Bible said the last days
[51:55] I'll pour out my spirit because a day
[51:56] with God is a thousand years, right? The
[51:59] last time, the last days, little
[52:02] children, it is the last time. And as
[52:04] you have heard that antichrist shall
[52:05] come, even now there are many
[52:07] antichrist. If there was many antichrist
[52:09] in 90 AD, there must be just billion
[52:12] millions of antichrists now.
[52:15] Whereby we know that it is the last
[52:17] time. They're anti-word or anti- message
[52:20] or anti-revelation of the Bible. They're
[52:23] against the revelation of scripture.
[52:25] Okay, Caris. And you want to read verse
[52:26] 19.
[52:44] Amen. Did you catch that? The Bible
[52:46] says, "No doubt if you are a Christian,
[52:48] you'll stay with other Christians."
[52:51] There's no doubt about it. So, I
[52:53] recommend church, whether you feel like
[52:55] it or not, you come to church. Praise
[52:57] God. Whether you're on top of the
[52:59] mountain or not, you come to church
[53:01] because this is an opportunity to
[53:03] confess your sins and have a revival.
[53:05] Bring your life closer to God.
[53:06] Hallelujah. This is a chance for you to
[53:08] sharpen somebody else. Somebody sharpen
[53:10] you, provoke somebody, inspire somebody
[53:12] to do something. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[53:16] There's no doubt if you're a Christian,
[53:18] you'll continue with other Christians.
[53:21] Verse 20, but we have an uncction or we
[53:23] have an anointing or an inspiration from
[53:26] the Holy One and we know all things.
[53:28] Why? Because the Holy Ghost guides us
[53:30] into all truth. Let's stand to our feet.
[53:32] Musicians can come.
[53:37] So friends, that's the picture up here.
[53:38] The picture is abandoned, right? But we
[53:42] can't leave ourselves out there. We
[53:45] could abandon God, right?
[53:47] If we refuse to give him praise, refuse
[53:49] to confess our sins if we let idolatry
[53:51] in our lives, we can be the ones that
[53:54] abandon God. But let's not abandon him.
[53:56] Let's run to him. Praise God. Let's
[53:58] confess our sins, confess our iniquities
[54:00] because the blood of Jesus Christ, Jesus
[54:03] ever lives to make intercession for us.
[54:06] Let's bow our heads. Father God, we're
[54:07] thankful for tonight, Lord God.
[54:09] Hallelujah. We just give you glory in
[54:11] this little study, Lord. I trust it was
[54:12] a bing to your people, Lord. That list
[54:14] there in the book of Ephesians, Lord, is
[54:16] so important. Lying, stealing, corrupt
[54:20] words,
[54:22] wrath, bitterness,
[54:26] all these grieve your Holy Spirit. Oh
[54:28] God, help us Jesus today. Lord God, help
[54:31] us Lord God to stay with the church.
[54:33] Lord God, help us Lord to stay with your
[54:36] anointing, that uncction that we know
[54:38] all things from the scripture.
[54:41] Help us, Lord, to stay with that
[54:42] anointing, Lord God. Confessing our
[54:45] sins, pleasing the Holy Spirit
[54:50] because we're sealed by the Holy Ghost
[54:51] to the day of our redemption, Lord God.
[54:56] Lord, I appreciate the word of God
[54:57] tonight. Thank you for a man like
[54:58] Hezekiah. Lord, may we be spiritual
[55:01] Hezekiah. Hallelujah.
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] Lord, under the uncction or the
[55:07] inspiration to do it quickly, to get our
[55:10] lives lined up quickly with the word of
[55:12] God because now we are the temple.
[55:15] Hezekiah did the natural temple, but
[55:17] Lord, we've got to keep the spiritual
[55:19] temple open for worship, for praise, for
[55:23] singing, for clapping, for saying amen,
[55:26] hallelujah,
[55:28] for agreeing with the word, mixing faith
[55:31] with what is preached. Dear God, grant
[55:34] it. Lord God, may our lives not abandon
[55:38] the Holy Spirit, but may our lives
[55:40] welcome the Holy Spirit, be open to the
[55:42] Holy Spirit's move each and every day of
[55:44] our lives. Grant it, Lord Jesus. Help us
[55:46] to sharpen one another, Lord, for the
[55:47] glory of God. Provoke one another, edify
[55:50] one another, build each other up for the
[55:52] glory of God.

[55:55] I thank you for the inspiration, Lord. I
[55:56] still remember sitting at my desk and I
[55:58] felt that question kind of come up in my
[55:59] heart.
[56:01] Did abandoning and closing the church
[56:03] ever happen before in the Bible? I felt
[56:05] that was inspired by your Holy Spirit,
[56:07] Lord God. And I believe it's vindicated
[56:09] now here with the word of God and the
[56:11] quotes from your true prophet, Brother
[56:13] Brandham.
[56:15] Lord, we want to be the best Christians
[56:17] we can by coming to church, feeding on
[56:19] the things of God, fellowshipping with
[56:20] the saints, sharpening, provoking,
[56:22] edifying one another. Grant it today,
[56:24] Lord Jesus. We thank you, Lord God.
[56:27] Hallelujah. Be glorified and magnified.
[56:30] We ask all these blessings Lord
[56:31] especially repentance and we can have
[56:33] personal revival in our lives in Jesus
