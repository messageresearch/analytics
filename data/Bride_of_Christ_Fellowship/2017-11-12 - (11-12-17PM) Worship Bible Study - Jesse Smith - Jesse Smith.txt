said refresh your own worship that is really good I know my voice is new matter because I felt like I had a better voice this morning but I got kind of relaxed you tonight me some of those enjoyed the message in the word fellowship this morning Gordon 22 you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth we see it's a requirement it's a must you must have pure heart so let's pray for lease to request here Tom's father and family let's just take these heavenly father's a privilege to come in your presence one picture of my mind right now

and may they find comfort in the promises of God of your of your son Jesus oh god we thank you Lord God unless I go study here tonight let every heart and soul that came out of the Lord are so thankful for those that are hungry and nursing for the word of God or we're just happy to be in your house or God we thank you or let this time be so valuable like the tent-like with with with Mary and orders you told Mary all that you've received will not be taken from her everything we received tonight we know will not be taken from us we thank you for these revelations now Jesus Christ's name Hunter said in other she beans I did get another email though I like sharing these YouTube testimonies here so I got another YouTube testimony a family out in California found our YouTube videos and said I'm very happy I found your YouTube video actually tried to watch every video you have about God it's a high opener for me and my kids thank you for creating the video you will save a lot of our brothers and sisters that are lost right now especially me she said so we're thankful you know God you know God using whatever he uses you know to save souls you know that's just really blessed my heart so you know just thankful you know and I saw that we had 25 people view Wednesday service so I was thankful like well praise God you know God can use that and but we're do is just grateful you know to you know see little testimonies and so they want to be baptized they watch our baptism you know they want to be baptized so they said you know a preacher in California I don't so I gave him I gave them brother Brooks his number and brother rich cob he lives in Oregon so I gave them two numbers hopefully they'll be able to get baptized they said we really want to get baptized so no are the iron's hot you know hopefully they'll find a preacher out there that can baptize them in the name of Lord Jesus Christ so just got that this week and yesterday so encouraging by the grace of the Lord so let's look at this like I said I just want to take about a hour here and I would like to look at worship again it just you know it we became fresh to me as I was studying this week and just this idea of you know approaching God like like a little dog and we saw you know sister Connie's dog out there and like that's perfect you know the dog just runs up to the kids and jumping all over the kids and you know at this tongue all out like we talked about it was really really sweet you know he's so fast too so just it just reminded me of that you know like God wants a cheerful worshiper you know I know we all come here sometimes dragon I came here so tired Wednesday night but by the time I left I forgot all about my tiredness you know the how the Holy Spirit was moving in and encouraging us and blessing us it was just you know in my in my own body this is when I was my own body felt like just just call off just call the service off and I you know if you know me I rare I never do that but my body was so tired it's like the people understand you know you're just so tired but by the time I have got through his service you know it's such a good service and just so encouraged and now I had strength Thursday you know so it just goes to show that there's times you know when we're sick we need to stay at home you know but but that was one of those times where I just had to press through and the anointing really gave me strength that was I was really thankful for that because everything in my mind was telling me they'll understand you know you just need your overworked you know it's my own fault if I'm overworked I've got to do a better job balance in it but anyway just really blessed you know I just thought that would encourage you and that really encouraged me so I want to start like I said John 4:24 and I just want to go over those meanings again okay so woo I want to look at verse 23 again so true worshipers worship in the spirit now that's in the holy spirit and in the truth now there's lots there's a couple different interpretations of that you know we talked about some people have the anointing but don't have the revelation of the message of the hour you know that we need to believe that like we'd say like the latest message before ours was Pentecostal and those denominations certainly I've seen it my mom was healed of cancer in the church you know so I know the anointing comes upon them no doubt about that but lacking a little bit of truth you know lacking the message of the hour so we want the power of the Spirit and we want the truth of the word we've got to have both and I know that's familiar to us but I just want to remind us of that and I want to look at that word seeketh seeketh such to worship so that word actually means crave you probably heard me pray earlier God craves a true worshiper can you can you try to relate to that what have you craved it recently like in usually that mornings I crave coffee you know or crave something else you know just crave this well that's what God he's craving someone that will worship in spirit and in truth oh my so I thought that would be a help to you there he's craving someone that will have the right the right truth of the word but also true and church we should feel thankful that were that were the ones who can most easily meet these requirements because we have the word of the hour a scripture just came to my mind so bear with me and I want to go to that okay that's where there James for five let's go there James for five the scripture just came to my mind remember in verse four James tells us not to have friendship with the world so don't make friends you know like BAM said flirting like like Sampson don't floor it with worldly things don't play around with worldly things but verse five this is that same idea of craving God craves and it's that godly jealousy that the Holy Spirit has okay so here's a scripture do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy so God is craving right and has is craving our worship so much that the Spirit of God gets jealous inside of us we had friends over that woman I baptized in August the family from Copley we had them over Friday night had some really good fellowship gotten to witness to them and they said you ever miss football I said not really I said I just have a lot of zeal and jealousy now because I see all these people worship in football and and they won't even shout for Jesus and they're they just not like yeah yeah they they can see that well that's what the spirit does the spirit now covets it craves your worship and and that that's what you and I feel right we feel that when when we see people worshiping other things that there's just like this godly jealousy that you should be worshipping Christ does everybody feel that oh my that's what that's what Jesus says the father is craving that he's craving our worship he can't wait til we all gather here and worship and sing his songs and glorify Him and then remember that last one there in verse 24 they must worship Him so not only it's not an option like we said this morning it's not an option well it's an option if I can do this it's an option if I can obey this it's well maybe I have this option there's no options there's one requirement and that's spirit and in truth as there's there's no other options we have to meet this requirement and I want to echo this here in more Scripture so John 9:31 let's go there John 9:31 I'm gonna try to be moving pretty quick John 9:31 cuz I got a whole lot like I said there 73 whit worship scriptures in the New Testament there's no way I can cover all of them but I'll definitely hit the highlights if the Holy Spirit will help me here tonight so John 9:31 Malachi can you read that for me sir this is the man that was healed of his blindness I believe or Jesus had touched him I believe and he knew this so this man had common knowledge God doesn't hear sinners right but if any man's a worshiper of God and does his will Himmy here this is a true worshiper we've got to do his will like Jesus said in Matthew 7:21 only he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven will inherit eternal life but he also must be a worshiper so in order to do the will of God we must worship God in spirit and in truth and it's clear every time in the Bible now let's go to Philippians 3:3 and sister Wendy do when I read that when you get a chance I know you're right in there so part of me I know you're really good at fast a turn in there Philippians 3:3 I thought you liked this you know it's nice to see Paul write this in the scripture and whenever you racist hey man praise God don't you like that it's the same idea we worship the father in spirit and in truth Paul said that's what we are we are the circumcision we worship God in the spirit we rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh that's why we crucify the flesh that's why we bring the flesh under obedience to the Word of God we our temper in all things amen we're self-controlled praise the Lord I thought you like that it goes right along with Matthew 4:20 for the next one is lydia and acts 1614 I just thought I'd read that when I thought that was she was a worshiper of God and because she was a true worshipper God opened her heart and let her hear the prophet of the hour hey man Paul because she was a true worshiper I can say that from my experience you know when God found me I was truly worshiping and in my denominational Church or whatever independent church I was truly worshiping I was I was trying to worship in spirit and truth and then when the message came around I was ready to receive it by the grace of the Lord so verse 14 and a certain woman named Lydia cellar purple and of the city of Thyatira which worshipped God heard us whose heart the Lord opened and she attended unto the things which were spoken of by Paul Amen I just got a I just got a call from sister Karen Sanders so it's interesting she was she normally doesn't call me unless there's a prayer request so maybe after this service I'll check that hope everything's okay okay so see she is she worshiped God so she had to been a true worshiper because God was craving a worshiper so God sent Paul there - he was craving more Souls God sent Paul there and a true worshiper received the word and the Bible said the Lord opened her heart amen and God opened her heart because she was a true worshiper and poured in the oil and wine can I say like that part of the oil and wine amen so there you go there's another example of a true worshiper okay now let me just briefly go over this definition again true worship is I'm sorry worship means to kiss the hand token of reverence to fall on the knees to touch the ground profound reverence prostration to do homage to make obeisance a way to express respect or make supplication so I wanted to show all the scriptures that use this word like I said most of the words in the New Testament are this word and it's Pross Canio Pross cuneo okay I just got a voice text from sister Kara I just want to make sure it's nothing serious we need to pray for right now oh no she just congratulating us on our seventh baby praise the hard house very nice bless her heart so that's Prosecco neo worship I want to be a prosecutor worshipper Amen a true worshipper someone who comes to Lourdes like a dog comes before master and that as you know I forgot about it but remember the word caleb means dog remember that a Joshua and Caleb Caleb means dog and and so dogs member are connected to Gentiles in the in the in the instance of Caleb and then the instance of the Canaanite woman who approached Jesus so we have two examples there of of individuals that are typed as dogs worshiping God and we know with Caleb the brother branham said Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua amen and he probably said Joshua represents the seventh day messenger which of course was brother Rams ministry so we we are the ones that are staying true so the dogs will stay true to the prophet of the hour amen and next the Canaanite woman let's go to that Matthew 1525 she called herself well after Jesus called her dogs she agreed she said yes Lord I am just say I'm just a dog I'm just a worshipper that's how we see it's not what you feel I'm just the worshipper I'm nobody special I'm nobody you know that we would think oh this person's really special I'm just a dog I'm just one of them just a Gentile worship or praise God that's all I am now Matthew 15 25 I like that praise God Lydia do you want to read let's see 25 and okay remember she was crying after Jesus that's true worship praise God could not be turned away Jesus says I'm only come to lost sheep of the house of Israel and why don't you read 25 and 26 hon all right and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table so she agrees with the Lord we must always agree with the word and recognize whatever God calls us that's what we are if he says we're a dog we're a dog amen we're just a worshipper a Gentile worshipper and they eat the crumbs and Jesus said gray is your faith don't let anything to scourge you don't let anything make you doubt just understand I'm a Gentile worshipper and we get the blessings of God amen this and Jesus calls that great faith that's what I'm saying I'm trying to encourage you I'm trying to let the word encourage me be encouraged take would just realize God has something for us it might not be what we envision but so we just need a brainwashing amen we need to have the brain washed by the waters of the word like you know for me I thought you know God would you know save 100 souls in Akron or maybe 200 you know I just we have all of our ideas but we got to be submissive to the will of God and realize we're nothing amen so it's great faith that realizes even dogs get crumbs even worshippers even the most insignificant worshiper gets a crumb from the master's table great faith and great faith we'll hang on to that that's why we're hanging on here in Accra that's why we're hanging on that's why you're hanging on to the promises of God because you have great faith how many how many say that by God's grace if you got even a mustard seed of grain of faith you got great faith does that move mountains absolutely okay so there's that connection to dog kind of getting back to that definition now let's go through the process we're shipping here to the New Testament you know what I'm sorry before I get to that let's do vain worship first let's go back to matthew 15:8 let's do vain worship because we showed true worship and now let's show vain worship we're gonna see a few of those let's look at some vain worship matthew 15:8 through nine yeah we're right there that's actually really really good now remember in this context the Jews had the Pharisees had made this false doctrine you remember the false doctrine they said you don't have to take care of your parents you can just pay the money you would have took care of them with and just give it to the temple so in other words who's getting rich the Pharisees and that was a scriptural that was a tradition of man that was a tradition of the Pharisees right so Jesus rebukes them see how they're always concerned about your money mercy goodness oh my verse seven okay let's go to verse eight yea this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men how see you we just have to recognize that it's so serious what we teach we have to make sure everything lines up with the Word of God because soon as it becomes a tradition well we just do this because then it loses it sincerity it's no longer accepted but it's rejected you know Ave means it actually means fruitless so see once once we inject if people inject their own thoughts then there's no more fruit to the ministry there's no more fruit to the preaching right the fruits of the spirit the soul saved right the the supernatural as soon as people inject their own thoughts and their own traditions there's no more fruit but that's why we love the fruit of God because it shows we're staying true to the word amen that's right and notice this to reap recall that it's our words that draw nigh unto God did you see that he said with your mouth you draw nigh there's not really it's not that they were not drawing nigh to God there actually your words will actually get you closer to God and what is this this is thought it's the thought brother Branham says if you talk about him he comes around amen right like on the road to Emmaus they start talking about him and who steps out from behind the bushes the Lord Jesus it was me it was me that song says it was me I was always all that I was the rock in the wilderness I was everything I was the all and all I was the token I was everything amen but see that's how we draw tonight we got to say thank you Jesus Oh God did this and God's gonna move today and I've got expectation the Holy Spirit you know we have to honor him with our lips that's what true worshipers do and draw an eye with our hearts our hearts our passions the Greek word means a passion a desire the centerpiece of our being it says so we draw an eye with our hearts and our lips so see vain worship doesn't include your passion see we always got to make sure Jesus is in our passion he has to be our passion that's why coming to church always has to be the passion if it's it was when we all started right wasn't it so what's keeping it from being it that's why we got to get rid of anything that keeps this from being our passion hallelujah because these people went to church these these people sacrificed more than we did right we know Bible says all that all those things about him like that they would they would be stoned if they made one mistake here but the idea is our heart must have a passionate desire for the word of God amen now we don't have to read this but in mark 1519 the Roman soldiers pross knew a process but it was done in mockery remember they bowed down and they worshiped in saying hail king of Jews so see they had the right physical motions but it was a mockery worship and so see God recognized they have and it's the same Greek word so they actually went through that they went through the motions but it was on mockery so that's vain worship again they had the right they had the right actions but it was done by mockery and not from the heart it was vain worship so I just thought that was interesting he used the same Greek words so Church should we fought on on our knees oh yes should we raise our hands to heaven oh yes the Bible's that lift up holy hands right lift up holy hands unto God but that's done in mockery now let's go to let's read this one acts 17:23 this is ignorant worship so we have vain worship we have mockery worship here's ignorant worship in acts 17:23 which is the word ignorant means mistakenly or mistaken worship so acts 17:23 Lydia could you read that honey whenever you ready isn't that something outside of vain worship and outside of mockery worship you have ignorant worship which mistakenly they weren't really trying to worship the true God they just mistakenly did it they mistakenly did it and Paul said it wasn't right now interesting go to verse 25 and Acacia could you read 2517 25 sweetie yeah 1725 amen so not only was there mistaken worship but Paul has to kind of straighten him out and said God's not worship by your hands God's worship from your heart praise God so you guys not worship with your hands what man can do and these these people had all kinds of idols with their hands and but it was a mistaken ignorant worship they were they were just shooting in the dark they're worshiping everything and anything in church we're not just our prayers just don't go off to the dark our prayers go straight to the throne of God amen when our hearts condemn us not the Bible said we ask the court in his will he gives us what we asked for it's not a mistake it's not ignorant and it's not so much our hands it's not he's not worship with our hands he's worship from our heart hallelujah amen thank you lord now we can go through some of these price Kunio scriptures here now I'm not gonna read these because we're familiar with these but if you want to run down Acts 10:25 Cornelius tries to prosecute NiO Peter he tries to run up to him like a dog and worship Him and Peter says you don't worship me worship Christ and then you remember a revelation 19:10 in revelation 22 8 and 9 where John tries worshiping this angel and one time it's angel in 19 and chapter 22 it's a prophet he said I love the servants of the servants the prophets and each case John tried to prosecute neo a prophet or an angel and they said don't do that don't do that don't give that type of love and that type of respect or homage don't give that to a man give that to Christ amen okay so let's go through a few more here let's go to Matthew 2 verse 2 here's the wise men worshipping I don't know how far a dog will run to find its master but these wise men traveled all the way from Babylon right to Israel they came like dogs here to worship the Lord Jesus amen what faithfulness what devotion these these dogs had we'd say they came to prosecute they came to worship real worship Christ so Matthew 2 - how are we done saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have Tina star in the east and we are come to worship Him amen look at verse 10 when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh so see just like just like Lydia they open their heart right their heart was open and they gave gifts they gave worship and praise out of their hearts I like that amen so they're seeking here's real worship you'll see Kenny you'll see Christ at any distance you'll follow his light for any distance you'll pack gifts you'll prepare gifts and fall down worship and rejoice in his present that's a true worshiper amen worshiping in the spirit and truth amen here let's go to Luke four seven now Luke four seven true worship must be reserved of course only to God this is when Satan tempted Jesus to worship Him Luke four seven I believe maybe verse eight to Luke for seven and eight yeah I brought this one I like this one a little better because it says get thee behind I like how Jesus said get behind me so in other words he speaks the EE tells the devil what to do so this is enough this is a man who has Authority and church that's what we want to tap into that's what we want to have we want to tell those evil thoughts where to go we want to tell that sickness where to go right we want to tell that temptation where to go behind you away from you amen Luke four seven and eight Malachi can you read four seven eight sir Amen remembered you remember this this is where brother branham dramatized it and said he was telling Jesus you don't have to go the cross you don't have to bleed you don't to die you don't to be mocked and stripped and beaten you don't have to do that I'll just give it to you now just fall down and Pross you neo me just worship me like a dog would worship his master just show me this love see how Satan he wants the same thing God once he's so hungry he's so craving that but God's craving him or amen and God deserves it more amen and Jesus says get behind me the word get means depart it means go away go behind me depart from me leave me and Jesus tells the devil where to go I like that so when some things get in our way to worship not let's say it's family members you know I couldn't come to church or I couldn't read my Bible because of family I couldn't read my Bible because of this temptation or that temptation I couldn't come to church for these reasons we need to speak to that with authority in the name of the Lord amen I'm not gonna worship anything else I'm not gonna give a higher value to anything else except Christ Jesus amen get deep heart go away and get behind me Satan amen let's go to Matthew 8 verse 2 Matthew 8 verse 2 here's the leper and this is a beautiful example it's about telling brother Benjamin in a Bible study this week beautiful example of you have to find the will of God first for every situation this is the perfect example I remember reading this in for the bahs bahs worse Christ the healer book and it really meant a lot to me this was a really wonderful scripture ok so Matthew 8 - and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou will thou canst make me clean so this I thought this was a good example for us to remember well you know what when we're sick or when we're struggling or when we're in a difficult situation say Lord let your will if it's your will you can do it if it's your will remove this obstacle out of my life or please remove this trial if it's your will and I like what Jesus says Jesus says touching him and said I will in verse 3 be thou clean but member what did Jesus tell Paul no I'm not gonna take away this infirmity from your eyes it's to Humble you my grace will be sufficient in your infirmity but this is a beautiful example let's find the will of God first and let's receive that and then when we have the will of God we can have all the joy and peace in our lives don't have to worry about anything praise God find the will of God first and see and how do you do that you worship Him worship Him first and then he'll show you his will ask for his will he'll give it to you amen we're not going to go through these but Jarius you know before his daughter was raised from the dead he worshiped Jesus first he worshiped he came like a dog before the lord and worshiped him remember he was leader of the synagogue he could have got expelled for that he could have got kicked out of the church for that but yet he was willing to come and worship Jesus in spirit and truth and God honored him by raising his daughter from the dead in Matthew 14:33 the disciples worshiped Jesus after he calmed the sea I think we can all relate to that one boy we would have done that too right our lives were in jeopardy and and don't you do that when you almost get in a car accident a few weeks ago I almost got in a car accident I wasn't paying attention I went over to get in the right lane and a car just blew right by me and honked at me and and I was just you know listen to sermon I was doing everything right listen the server's driving not paying attention and I just worshiped I said thank you you don't thank you Jesus you protected my life and that's how this that's what every Christian does amen when God spares our lives when he calms our see Amen we just fall down and worship Him and say thank you lauren lee you could calm this see alright there's a few more of these I'm doing pretty good on time by God's grace okay Matthew 18 26 let's read that one just briefly this one ties in with Luke 11 and the woman who washes feet and was forgiven this one kind of ties in with that Matthew 18:26 this is the parable the man who was forgiven all of his debt but then couldn't forgive somebody else I just want you to I'm gonna point out the price kunio the worship when he actually received forgiveness at first he actually came worshiping and that's the same thing the woman who washed his feet she came there worshipping everybody else stood there and but from the time she got there she didn't cease to to worship Jesus and her tears wash his feet and anoint his head she just kept going on and she was very generous and liberal with her worship amen it was extraordinary worship can I say like that hallelujah so Matthew 18 26 I'll read that one sorry the Sermon therefore fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay diol so we're talking about just real sincere worship aren't we it's got to be sincere all these examples are people really falling down and all these examples Jesus meets their request in all these examples he loves he craves somebody that's sincere I'm on my last rope for I'm desperate and brother Graham said God always answers you when you're desperate praise God and it's a shame but sometimes it takes desperation to get us to that true worship but it's the true worship that God craves I went over this one we're not gonna read this one but in Matthew 20 verse 20 James and John's mother the wife of Zebedee she worship first and then desired a certain thing so she worship first and Jesus received that worship and said you know you have a good request but I can't give that to you only the father can give you or give that right hand in the left hand only oh that's that's predestinated who's on the right hand of Christ and the left hand of Christ that's predestinated but he never rebuked her because she came the right way she came through worship she came sincerely I've got a real sincere need she worship first now matthew 28:9 the women this is after Jesus was seen by Mary Magdalene member Mary Magdalene saw him first and she went to touch him and he said touch me not so after that he ascended and came right back down and now the women see him again and they grab ahold of him by his feet in matthew 28:9 and the bible said the women held Jesus by the feet and worshiped him so they poured out worship to the risen Christ I like that so just again showing this work this is how it you know if GE you know when Jesus I'll just let's just type it when Jesus appeared to you and showed he was alive and risen from the dead didn't she do the same thing fall down and worship saying there's a Living God amen Jesus Christ is alive hallelujah and you did the same thing you fell down at his feet and there came a peace so sweet there was that song is that a Miss he says oh now the comforter abides with me there it is right there he abides he abides hallelujah he abides with me Amen yes now this is interesting I Matthew 28 17 let's read that one kind of gets into the three kinds of believers in every gathering even when Jesus ascended to heaven there was doubters there some people were worshiping some people were doubting that's why you know I went even when we come to worship no matter where I'm at I have to remember there's always gonna be three kinds of believers but I can't let that hinder me I can't be discouraged by the doubters I've got to be a true worshiper amen hallelujah and I'm growing that way too you know sometimes I get discouraged if you know I can tell people are upset with me or they don't like to preach and you know visitors or whoever sometimes I got but I got to get past that and I just got to be a true worshiper I have to forget doubting forget vain worship right people that just go through the motions they're just singing you know they're just singing along it's not from their heart and I've got to let it flow from my heart so Matthew 28 17 lady can you read that for me darling there it is my a risen Christ can you imagine a risen Christ and still doubting the same thing today we have the Holy Ghost among us and people still doubt is Jesus alive or they doubt your testimony are you sure that happened you sure hi how do you know God healed that person right how are you sure that happened and they still doubt a resurrected Christ so god help us not to doubt help us just to believe amen but see you have that you have three types of believers but the true worshiper God helping us we press through any doubt and we believe the Word of God I love that I thought that was beautiful and here's something we've seen you know a few times first Corinthians 14 25 I think of you know and brother Amen came to the message first Corinthians 14 25 and I've heard different people you know not in the message with some of my friends tell stories about this like they came to church they were sinners and then it felt like the preacher was preaching right to them and what was it it was God discerning their heart God knew they wanted to be true worshipers right and it's like the whole sermon was directly to them glory that's God revealing himself and you and I have been there but I just thought you know with our church we've seen it happen to brother amen and I'm trying to think of a few others but we've seen it certainly happened where they fall on their face and I remember where they men fell on his face and it worship 1425 sis their money could you read that for us please amen to see how important is when you know no matter who's here but especially when visitors are here when unbelievers are here that's the time we really need to pray and really pull on the word of God even more so I mean for a Christian there's no service you can take off right but if there's unbelievers that's the time we got to pull and say God oh Jesus reveal yourself to them so they could actually fall in worship for the first time in their life because they were unbelievers before but now they're giving the prosecutor cheb now they know oh gods hear the word answered all my questions and now I'm a true worshipper Amen my hallelujah I'm glad it happened to me Amen by God's grace I remember falling down worship Me thank you Jesus amen I remember laying at the altar in Lima Ohio by God's grace hallelujah that's right it's so important that discernment of the word the preaching of the word can bring forth true worship now I want to show you this scripture before we finish revelation 13:15 you're familiar with this this is the mark of the beast chapter and this kind of ties in again with the the Roman soldiers Oh interesting Roman their Roman they had the exact same worship except it was a mockery and now here we see the bee system will have the exact same worship except it's false worship let me say like this it's actually will worship that's the one I forgot to get to this is will worship and I'll show you what that is it's pretty simple revelation 13:15 [Music] yes okay are we done and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed that's price you neo it's the same worship but it's will worship okay it looks the same and brother Branham gives that a beautiful example the church age book he said remember remember he said how the world loves to go to ball games remember he said they just don't sit like wallflowers he said they'd get in the spirit they paint their face some of the real fanatics paint their bodies to their real fanatics their real worshipers they paint their bodies and other Bram said that's how we he said we've got to get right into the feel of things we've got to come in to church and be a real worshiper getting the feel of it getting the feel of the song special getting in the feel of the worship service be a true worshipper amen but see it's the same worship except it's will worship and will worship is found in Colossians let's go there Colossians where man okay they're discussions 2:23 and Scofield connects this to Cain Cain did will worship you can you can put anybody in there you know that like Korah they were worshiping according to their will and not God's will like Cain said oh it's my will to bring fruit but God said blood so it's will worship thanks Malik I can you read that buddy up there for us thank you sir okay now if you read above this is speaking of they actually worship angels in the city of chaos they worship angels that's what he's talking about see they have a show of wisdom and we'll worship they look really smart it look like they're doing the right thing but it's will worship and will worship means worship which one prescribes and devises for himself so see they take their their own prescription rather than the eternal prescription Aaron is Amen Peter gave the eternal prescription repent and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ well anything outside that is self prescribed they didn't take the doctors fresh prescription all that you and I took the dr. Peters prescription glory amen I didn't catch that so right now thank you lord worship which one prescribe see their doctorate there you go there's a doctor dr. D lld and all these things PhD ll D we just want to go to the school of neurology amen that's all we want to be with the degrees of neurology so and it means contrary to the nature of faith in Christ so worshipping angels goes against the nature of Christ because the Bible said angels bow down and worship Christ but here we see with the B system their their worship looks exactly the same it has falling down and praises and hands raise and worship how many seen it on YouTube you know we all we all stream worship songs we like you know I'm sure we all do but you know the woman's got paint on it's a beautiful song and but then we like to we like to give our version of it here right and they have they might have a nice anointing you know women in pants and or a man who's you know not a very good man you know you understand what I'm saying but see we bring that that song has anointing it's inspired but they're using it through will worship and then weak because they prescribed their own worship to it you know they still cut their hair they're still wear makeup they still smoke cigarettes they still watch dirty movies you know but see but they have will worship their own prescription but when we bring that song into our churches it oughta glorify God and it does amen you see it's worship in spirit and in truth so there's those all kinds of vain worship there's vain worship mockery worship ignorant worship and we'll worship that's the third one I forgot will worship your own prescribed and that's Church and you understand in the message isn't that what a lot of people do they prescribed their own way to serve God they can say they follow brother branham I just heard brother I'm saying the token message and you've heard it but program says oh I believe every word you say brother Brown he said that's just being able to read I believe every word of God that's just being able to read the Bible he said get the token inside of you get Christ inside of you and your life will punctuate every word with an amen your life what you do your actions I'll bunk schooi ated the word with an amen okay so see it's the same worship in the bee system except it's misguided it's will worship and our worship is true worship by the Word of God so if you don't price Kony ho the Beast you die but we will not worship that we will prosecute near the Lord Jesus Christ now let me close with these two things here I think I got I mean I got plenty more I got plenty more scripture I could go on but I think I'll stop right here hmm well let me go I got way I still got 17 minutes for a full hour so yeah let's go to these now we're not gonna read this but in Exodus 15 verses 19 to 21 there was song of Moses and dancing by Miriam after the victory over Pharaoh true worship right true believers worshiping in spirit in truth well Graham said if I ever saw a Pentecostal meeting it was there that's what he said down at the Red Sea's yours Miriam on the tambourine come on sisters follow me around let's go worship let's go praise the law or follow me come on that's what I hope one of my daughters will be a Miriam amen you'll lead to work you'll relieve the sisters in worship a matter somebody we need brothers out words like sing like Moses amen hallelujah see that's a Pentecostal experience hallelujah now I don't know if you knew this my preaches years ago it's got a micah chapter 6 now remember Micah was a prophet I believe during the days of Joel or right after Joe if I'm not mistaken which was right by King Josiah so in other words at the end of the time of Israel's time in the promised land before they're dispersed so this is like almost in times of the judgement now Micah 6 1 to 8 Micah 6 we won't read all this I just want to hit the highlights I think this will encourage you know everybody in other words if in verse 2 God had a controversy against the people in other words he had a case against them they had not served the Lord look at verse 3 all my people what have I done unto thee and where and have I wearied thee testify against me I look at God saying where have I worn you out have I worn you out to do the Word of God people say I'm too tired to worship I'm too tired to serve God God is like where if I worry we read you see the thing as people wear out themselves I've got to be careful I don't wear out myself right God doesn't wear us out God wants us to serve but God's not the one wearing us out he said where did I were you what if I asked you to do that so hard right look at these now here's what I want to get to verse four before I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of my servants and I sent before thee look at this Moses Aaron and who Miriam God said Miriam sisters my children my little girls God can send you to be a leader in worship do you see that I'm not talking about a song here at the pulpit I'm talking about somebody that gets in the spirit and worships you see that God sent Miriam to the people of course Moses and Aaron the prophet in the priesthood you know the Prophet and them for other preaching gifts we'd say but Miriam was sent to them to God wanted the women to see somebody who was free in the spirit praise the Lord a true worshiper a man Oh hallelujah thank you lord that's thought I'd share that with you that really blessed my heart that was beautiful now go down to verse 8 God has showed the oh man what is good and what does the Lord require thee but to do justly to love mercy to walk humbly with that God God's not the one wearing us out we wear ourselves out we don't slow down right we schedule too much I schedule too much we schedule too much is not God wearing us out all God requires us to live justly love mercy and walk humbly I just want to show that God sent Miriam she was a prophetess too I believe if I'm not mistaken I'm not real familiar on that don't have to look that up but also as a worship leader a true worshipper was mirrored that's why I like when Lydia nikkei she would play the tambourine I like that I like that get him worshiping you know get them phrasing the Lord because you never know how God's going to use you you never know you never know so God sent her as an example of true worship you know this story but in 2nd samuel 6 14 to 23 david was dancing before the lord when the ark returned and Mike our Mikkel Mitchell I'm not sure how to say that Michael may be Dishonored David and because she was scorned full member the Bible said she said to see the scornful because she was scornful she couldn't bring forth life and see when we don't get free in the spirit when we're not generous in the spirit people we die spiritually right people die spiritually because they they they disregard the worship Jesus wants to be worshipped Jesus craves our worship he craves it he wants someone that will worship Him prosecute I will bow before him run up to him love him love the master worship the master be unashamed to worship the master and if not he makes them barren he doesn't give them the Holy Ghost he doesn't give them life right no new births you see that that's true no new births no births at all for Michael all right now let me close with this here I think I'm yeah I'm ready close down now I've got through most of scriptures but not all of them most of them but not all all right let's go to Hebrews 13:15 this is getting back to kings and priests this thought on kings and priests I just want to close with this and I so appreciate you coming out to the house Lord tonight and so appreciative for your sacrifice and hearing the Word of God and we're never disappointed not I've never been this one one time where I've ever gone to church God's never let me down I've never been disappointed just like the Prophet God said I just want to close with this thought about kings and priests to get so I think it'll be a blessing to you okay so Hebrews 13:15 Malachi can read that for me sir amen so I'm closing with this thought just continual worship God loves continual worship continual worship and what does it look like our lips remember we got his word in our mouth we're constantly giving him thanks thank you Jesus thank you for this trial thank you for this victory amen thank you for everything and last one let's go to the last one Luke 24 52 and 53 Luke 24 52 and 53 Luke 24:52 why don't we stand on our feet that will help us to be refreshed a little bit by God's grace okay so this is after the resurrection this is after Jesus ascended to heaven so this is what Holy Ghost filled apostles do so we know if they did it we know we'll do the same thing and so it's encouraging that we're here tonight on a Sunday night doing the same thing they would do and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy next verse and we're continually in the temple praising and blessing God amen these are men and women that were filled with the Holy Ghost you note the word continually means constantly it means always where sister Connie where sister Wendy always in the house of the Lord where's brother Jess where's where's where's Malcolm Bang where they at they're continually in the temple praising God giving them glory you like that worshiping him God loves continual worship I thought how do we prove our love to him this isn't chapter four of the church age book does Jesus love us oh yes but how should we know we should know because he said so and manifested that he did love us or he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sucks how do you know he loved me because he went out and found you brought you to the message that's how he you know he loves you and on top of that he said so and I love this this is what I needed to hear that's why we need to write my journal and how shall I prove my love to him how can I show Jesus I want to worship by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass Oh Lord this trial you allowed it it helped me to be joyful them itself I know you love me and I want to show you I love you so help me to have joy in the midst of this trial because I know you wouldn't allow anything to come into my life except when it helped me in the end and when you know that you can worship God praise the Lord you like that study I was beautiful I really stirred me up I just want to be a true worshipper the grace of God trusting the word that was preached this morning help the church helped you by the grace of God I really felt strongly about that message this morning amen let's just sing a song here as we close worship the Lord here what you see majesty worship [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
