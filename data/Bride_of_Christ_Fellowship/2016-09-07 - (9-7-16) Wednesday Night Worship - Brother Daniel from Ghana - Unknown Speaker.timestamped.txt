[44:44] me rogers first be the name of our Lord
[44:46] or no wonder Rory I like you the way
[44:50] Paul put it is it also pointed to be a
[44:54] light unto the Gentiles right
[44:57] yesterday I was a party our glory oh can
[45:00] we just read a scripture quick yes I
[45:02] think it's an octa our tech team after
[45:10] 13 and out in relief from this for
[45:14] football yes her worried when after
[45:21] detecting oh sorry mm-hmm yes actually
[45:33] 30 verse 44 is it and another birthday
[45:36] came almost the whole city together to
[45:39] hear the word of God but when the Jews
[45:42] saw the multitude they they were filled
[45:46] with envy and spec against those things
[45:50] which were spoken by porta dos por was
[45:52] produced something that seem contrary to
[45:55] the Jewish belief yes but they did it
[45:58] know that Paul has meant a pillar of
[46:01] fire on the way to Damascus worry and
[46:04] now say that the tender he studied
[46:07] previously he has through all of them
[46:09] away right now it is what the Holy
[46:13] Spirit tells him to that is what he does
[46:16] yeah so did not understood him and gay
[46:19] where Phil would envy contradict him and
[46:23] blasphemy yes whatever Polebridge to
[46:27] contradict it yes and back on track
[46:30] victim is also the glass him the Word of
[46:31] God first four assists then Paul and one
[46:35] of us walks board and said it was
[46:38] necessary that the word of caution fest
[46:41] have been poking to you but seeing here
[46:44] put it from you and Jay yourself
[46:47] unworthy of everlasting life no we pin
[46:50] to the Gentiles for this heaven is
[46:53] therefore saw her the LORD commanded us
[46:55] saying i have said deed to be alike of
[46:59] the gentiles worry the dog should have
[47:02] beef was out version all to the ends of
[47:05] the earth and when the jack does have
[47:08] this they were glad and glorify the word
[47:11] of the Lord

[47:20] are about there is a God say that about
[47:22] part able to be a light unto the
[47:25] Gentiles power gonna get a sausage right
[47:29] but because the Jews themselves did not
[47:32] you know to not take the revelation of
[47:35] Christ through Paul was given to death
[47:37] is it no the loss that I should come to
[47:39] the Gentiles because they are nothing
[47:41] alike on today right so Paul well the
[47:44] first man to take that light yes and got
[47:47] into the darkness of the judge else we
