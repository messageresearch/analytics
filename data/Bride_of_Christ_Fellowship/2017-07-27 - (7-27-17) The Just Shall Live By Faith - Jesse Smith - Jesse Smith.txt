the way be stormy will praise though I start with thorny amen though all the way be thorny we [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] our Bibles this evening by the grace of Lord and try to be mindful the time the grace of the Lord we have a couple portions of Scripture I'd like to read from tonight I just want to take the thought I never finish it last week about the just shall live by faith I want to preach on that tonight by the grace of God I look at that thought and kind of look at look at salvation again by the grace Lord and justification we look at that if we can by the grace of God so there's numerous scriptures here let's go to Romans 5:1 let's just read that by God's grace [Music] you know we looked at the Sardis Church age last Wednesday and saw how Martin Luther was the messenger and his main message was the just shall live by faith now didn't you hear brother Craig preach on that on Sunday morning he brought him out with Martin Luther on Sunday morning I thought well praise the Lord he kept hitting the church ages and he doesn't listen to our services so it was just it was God encouraging us right it's God encouraging us that we got to stay right with the word you know we got a pay attention that all the all these things are important everything God has given us the same thoughts the same thoughts all the time so after he preached out I just felt that I just really want to go look at the just shall live by faith and look at faith again salvation again because how many know that the Bible said that David lost the joy of his salvation he didn't lose his salvation he just lost the joy of it I mean no the Bible says that in Psalms 51 so we want to look at that again tonight and because brother Graham said truly if the Lutheran's would get back to doing what Luther said and what he taught they would be acceptable unto God today if they got back to that so I want to see how important that is for us tonight and look at the just shall live by faith Romans 5:1 if you have your Bibles there Romans 5:1 let's read let's the read verse 1 together and now read verse 2 let's read verse 1 let's begin one two three therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ and I'll just read verse to myself by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God so are we standing in grace tonight or in works tonight we're standing in grace tonight and how do we have access to that we have access by faith through grace to Lord Jesus Christ through his blood amen let's just bow our heads if ever needed on your heart just making known unto God as we preach his word here have any father we love you tonight Lord we've sung your songs though the way be stormy or thorny will praise the Lord dear God we all worship you will sing to you will rejoice Lord God rejoice children say yes servant Lord I love that that verse there say yes servant say yes say yes say yes Lord so our hearts say we'll keep serving we'll keep loving is one day we want to fly away Lord with you dear Jesus that's our desire whether it be Lord through death and the body change Lord or just through the body change while we're living the quicken made alive Lord the quicken swallowed up Lord and life - your God either one father we want to fly away to our ternal home Lord fill with the Holy Ghost and pleasing you Lord God speak to us here tonight Lord God I pray have your way help me to get out of your way Lord Jesus and father bless the hungry hearts that are here help us have the right attitude lord help us to get in your presence and have the right approach we thank you for every soul and Lord every opportunity to hear your word in Jesus Christ's name in every said Amen god bless you mean see the praise the Lord someone look at the just shall live by faith and so I want to just take that thought like we left off last week [Music] Luther before we get into the rest of the Sardis Church age I just want to stop and look at are we living by faith and do we feel justified tonight at the end of the message that's what I want you to ask yourself that as we go through and at the end I'll remind you do you feel justified tonight do you feel righteous that means righteous and if you don't hopefully by the end you do by the grace of Lord that's what I want everybody to be able to to grasp here tonight because how many ever how many fights ain't real hard this week anybody fights ain't real hard and you and you feel that you tries to make you feel discouraged he tries to make you doubt he tries to make you fear he tries to discourage you in any way you can but the just live by faith not by their feelings but by faith in the Word of God so we're look at that tonight here by the grace of God the just shall live by faith remember this was Martin Luther's main message he he did a lot of teaching a lot of the writing he was uh he was a very famous author in his day he was like what we call like a Joel Osteen today or a TD jakes or somebody that's like Oprah Winfrey except oddly person right a godly rogue alley person he was a top seller his tracks and the pamphlets and the papers that he wrote was the best-selling he was the most sought-after preacher he was the the most popular writer as well because he was giving people the revelation of the hour amen and so let's look at this here are we you didn't actually I didn't do that text I forgot to change that screen so that's my phone I forgot to change it but here's where we left off last week but for all that God used Martin Luther let it not be said that his intentions were wrong let it only be said his judgment failed and remember they failed with the peasant wars now brother Craig even mentioned that on Sunday morning too brother Ram said there's history that the peasants or the poor people that heard Martin Luther teach and was reading his tracks they kind of got upset and they wanted rights so they all form like a militia and he started fighting against the government and thousands of them were slain by the government and so brother Branham said that history says that Martin Luther had part of the responsibility of stirring them up and so that's what we read last week we actually read that last week as well they were called the peasant Wars you can read that in history during the Reformation there so so Martin Luther was not a prophet but he was a godly man remember he had all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit what about what of what a testimony that is to say that all nine gifts of this Holy Spirit have flowed through me my I've only had a few you know but he had all nine flow through him what a man of God well here's the statement I want to focus on truly if the Lutheran's get back to his teaching and serve God as this gracious brother served him then that people would surely be a credit and praise to the great God and Savior Jesus Christ help me believe that well Graham wrote that in 1965 and he's saying if the Lutheran's got back to what Martin Luther actually preached they would be us they'd be a blessing to the kingdom of God now if they just stay with Martin Luther would they be fill with the Holy Ghost no but would they be justified you better believe it they'd be justified because that's why God needed the star of Martin Luther the brightness of Martin Luther's message which was a just shall live by faith so I want to bring this out does anybody know what Luther taught you know what he actually said here's what he actually said now by the end of eight or 15 18 according to most scholars Luther reached a new understanding of the pivotal Christian notion of salvation or reconciliation with God over the centuries the church had conceived the means of salvation in a variety of ways but common to all of them was the idea that salvation is jointly effected by humans and by God by humans through marshalling or mastering their will to do good works and thereby to please God and by God through his offer of forgiving grace Luther broke dramatically with this tradition by asserting that humans can contribute nothing to their salvation glory salvation is fully and completely a work of divine grace I mean like that the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican and all the churches that are broken off they had all mixed works back into salvation that you you know you've that God is offering it but you've got something to do it and if you do the right thing now you're righteous because you did it and Martin Luther breaks from that and said man has no part in his salvation it is God giving him the gift to salvation amen and we're gonna find out that our messenger said the same thing aim ahead Martin Luther said you it's God's divine grace you can give nothing to God right member the Bible said what house will you build me as beautiful and building a Solomon could built really was that beautiful to God no because in a few years what it fell apart and member God does not need the works of our hands God doesn't have to have you know our efforts for us to get to heaven God doesn't need that does God make us like we talked about at the youth group tonight there's God want us to do good works yes he created us to do good works but he doesn't need our works for us to get to heaven all's he needs is just for us to say yes and believe in his free gift that's all i need's so we have nothing that we can give for our salvation it is fully a gift of God now Martin Luther came to this understanding after a long inner conflict in which he agonized even despair over his inability to marshal his will adequately to do good work so even as a Catholic priest Martin Luther just couldn't master his his will very well and he's always had this inner conflict while meditating on Romans 1:17 so let's go there real quick let's go Romans 1 I'll just pull it up real quick here Romans 1:17 I think I forgot to put the slide in there so he was meditating on Romans 1:17 and he had what he called like heaven opened up to him for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith so Martin Luther is meditating on this this is what the history says about him the righteousness of God is revealed to man from faith to faith in other words God will give you a revelation for salvation and then it'll give you a revelation for the next step but all the time it's God revealing it to us it's not us working our way into it it's God revealing it amen it's God showing us so here he he's meditating upon this and look what it says he experienced an illumination that he later described as a kind of conversion it was if the very gates of heaven had opened before me Amen I'm not earning my salvation God showed me I'm saved God God revealed to me the faith to be saved amen I didn't work for it God gave it to me God showed me I'm saying isn't that how you felt when you first gave your heart to the Lord oh God's always wanted me to be saved this is his gift to me he was always chasing me all those years then he was always near to me he was always guiding me he always loved me and finally I've surrendered and he's revealed faith to me Amen that's right glory the dramatic and intensely personal nature of this experience helps to explain Luther's determined refusal during the indulgences controversy to recant his theological views because remember in his day people would go to the priests and pay money and then the priests would write out a piece of paper yes you're already forgiven for the sin you're going to do and they would go to the sin like they would rape rape a person or they would murder or they would steal or they would slap somebody or they would do something evil they would steal from someone they had the paper that says you're already forgiven for it because they paid money for it and luther saw this and just had pain in his heart until he read this and realized my heaven is open here i can't pay for salvation i can't pay for forgiveness god already paid for an amen god i already paid for my salvation we can't pay money for it but god already paid for through his son jesus amen but see he was seeing all the indulgences and he had to god had to show him it's not by man's contributions it's what God did it's God revealing to man the faith that he needs to be saved aren't you glad you have faith to be saved amen it's a gift of God the Bible said so what about the brand embrace your brother Brandon preached that well you know you got you're saved if you do the right works you're only saying if you God will save you if you do the right works no that's not it brother and said now works are fine but they don't save you oh because you stopped smoking Beau Geste I'm gonna save you no no that's not it it's not by my works they don't save me they don't even make you perfect right because you can do nice things you can fast and pray and give to the poor that doesn't make you perfect you still straddle a sin the sin that dwells within you right it is Christ or perish it is not even Christ and works like like like Luther was seeing it is Christ alone this age began the years of Arminianism that does not believe in Christ as the reality it not seeing of nothing but the blood force things nothing but the blood and my own conduct would that be an awful song nothing but Jesus blood and all my good conduct all the good things I do what we'll see now I've got a part in Salvation but that's not what the song says the song says nothing but the blood hey nothing but the blood of Jesus this is all I see this is all my hope and peace nothing but the blood of Jesus I love that now I believe in good conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus Plus well I'm saved by the Amen because I go to message Church no I'm say brother Adam because I'm a preacher and I've given God all my life no that's that's a lie I'm saying because Jesus died for me and God gave me the faith he revealed the faith for me to be saved and that's why that's why I'm saying because he revealed it from faith to faith the just shall live by faith amen not my works not because I have six kids or not because I treat my wife good or because I work hard and pay my tithes and offering that's not why I'm saved i'm saved by jesus's efforts amen it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord and don't you think how many need reminders of this sometimes I do I beat myself up more than anybody I criticize myself more than anybody I get all myself all the time and this is what we need reminders of that we must live by the faith that's inside of us we live by that and our faith is in God's Word amen from start to finish that means even right now tonight it is all God amen let his life be in me the only way I'll do anything good is if I let his life flow through me I just got to heal I just got a surrender let it be his blood that cleanses me I love this life in me blood cleanses me let his Spirit fill me hallelujah let it be his stripes that heal me amen hallelujah glory let it be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness which I've done no sir Christ is my life amen that's what the Philadelphia Church cake we're not quite there yet we're one church age away and remember the scripture if I for by grace are you saved through what the faith and that faith is not of yourself that faith is even a gift from God because already showed you it's revealed from God from faith to faith that faith is a revelation and not of works lest any man can boast so when it comes to salvation nobody can brag and say or not and I've just put it up here so you can understand brother Branham cannot boast about being saved well I went around the world seven times brother and I saw visions 80% of my life was in visions he can't boast on that hears nothing he can boast of Paul labored more than all the other apostles right he labored more than all of them he can't say well I'm saying because I'm the apostle to the Gentiles look how wonderful I am and and look what I'd done he there's no bragging in heaven amen can you say amen to that there's no there's not gonna be any pride in heaven right it's gonna be Jesus getting all the glory amen and the Bible said it's a free gift you are being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ but the Hosea was talking on the way to Jeffersonville yesterday and he said this he said if we had a sign free food everybody would stop cuz they love free stuff right but then he said if anyone wants free salvation through Jesus Christ nobody would stop right because they don't they don't love Christ or I say like this it hasn't been revealed to them or they're running away from what's God is trying to reveal them because remember the Bible said God's Christ is knocking on the church let me in the church I want to fellowship with you I want to take you out to eat I want to order to meet with you I want to be I want to I want to fellowship I want to be your friend they want free natural things but they don't want what free and it's the most valuable thing but church we should rejoice in this justified freely by His grace amen amen he declared me righteous and I didn't have any I didn't pay anything for it he freely gave it to me right by his unmerited favor grace that's just his favor to me he wanted to do us a favor right that's grace we're justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah can we say praise the Lord we said praise the Lord Amen free it's a free justification a free gift you know if you do anything you just have to receive it and say Amen I believe it how did Christ freely justify us let's go back and get some of these wonderful scriptures he shall see the travail the so in Isaiah 53 one of those beautiful chapters in the whole Bible like I told my wife and family I think I told my wife that if I pass away read Isaiah 53 at my funeral because I was wounded for my transgressions and with His stripes I'm healed amen freely not because I what I did freely by his blood amen I'm I'm healed freely by him hallelujah because I love it because we love him because God revealed faith to us amen Gouri he shall see the travail so God will see the travail of Christ's soul and shall be satisfied with it by his knowledge shall my righteous servant and justify many see Jesus Jesus had knowledge that he had to go to the cross remember Elisha Moses come told him about it you've got to go to the cross they spoke of his decease coming he had knowledge and he had to obey that he had to go to the cross and by doing that he would justify many people for he shall bear their iniquities so how does Jesus make us justified or righteous he took our sins amen Romans 5:19 for my one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous so Satan's trying to accuse you of your sins and I tell them no Jesus took it praise God Jesus took it Jesus already bore mice I'm not going to hell I'm not gonna pay for my sin Jesus already bore them amen freely freely freely gave me the gift freely saved me it's not Jesus plus I'm in the message or Jesus plus I memorized this book of the Bible or that quote it's not Jesus plus that it's Jesus alone amen whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God there's a lot of important things in there to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus how many believe in Jesus if you believe in Jesus he's the judge he's your justifier amen he's the one that will make you righteous praise God where is boasting then who's gonna brag that his brother Brad I'm gonna brag brother Jesse your brother Craig your brother Jose didn't anybody here gonna brag about what they've done there's no boasting it is excluded by what law by or works nay but by the law of faith God gives you the gift of faith and now you operate by the law of this face substance inside of you it's a gift of God freely given to those who believe now propitiation has two meanings Jesus is made God the propitiation through faith in his blood that's a big fancy word remember how many remember what it means another word for is mercy seat God made Jesus to be a mercy seat for us okay and I'm gonna show I'm just gonna jump ahead for this because this might review for some of us but the Ark of the Covenant this lid is the mercy seat everybody familiar with that the only way so so so the law the law was against God's people so God designed this this Ark in a way where the law would be covered up the law had to be cover up for God to fellowship with any man how many understand that because all men had sinned so God could have no fellowship unless he put a cover on the law because we can't stare the law in the face and said I'm I can keep all that law we need that law covered up and not only covered up but somebody has to be covered up and then someone has to pay the price for our sins for us to even hear from God because the Bible said God said Moses I'll speak to Aaron from above the mercy seat right but before he can do that there has to be seven drops of blood on the mercy seat that's why I drew seven drops there I just drew those with fellow illustrator and then remember the type there it was seven seven drops so it was ephesus simona Pergamos Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea amen there was seven measures of blood there was seven measures of blood or seven measures of life that was paid there was blood for every age Amen there's a sacrifice for every age other words that means Jesus was going to sit in heaven at the throne of God as an intercessor for seven church ages and the blood of Christ would last for all seven Church ages hey man that's right so look at that picture Christ is the mercy seat he's the cover and then we must have faith in that blood when we have faith that God accepts that blood now God can talk to us in the holiest praise God now we can hear God's voice saying oh yeah you should do this yeah I'm gonna lead you to do this and your life is going to be this for this this purpose but first we have to know Christ as our mercy seat he's our cover and we must have faith in Christ's blood do you see any of Aaron's works here you see anything Moses did here so God can talk to them there's nothing they did it wasn't their blood it wasn't their sacrifice they just brought the blood that was sacrifice into the place and sprinkled it and that's all we've got to do we've just got to bring of the blood of an innocent one into God's presence and got to receive us amen that's all we got to do it's not our works it's not well I fasted this long or I did this we should do that should pray but it should be God leading us to do that it's not well I attended this many services so now God's gonna answer my prayer it's not by our works were saved it's by his blood amen now you see this word propitiation a few more times in the scripture first John 2:1 my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not so he would write them letters so they wouldn't sin praise God and if any man sin we have an advocate which means that defense counsel a lawyer write a defense lawyer if any of you sinned you have a defense counsel with the father Jesus Christ the righteous so now Jesus Christ is not only your mercy seat he's also your defense lawyer so if you're getting accused of something in the court of God if saint is accusing you day and night you can talk before you talk or before they call you to the stand you can talk to your lawyer in other words your lawyer will talk for you because your lawyer knows the law is pretty good right your lawyer works in the court system he understands all the law he gets paid the big bucks he knows all about the court system and you've seen it you've probably seen it on TV or the news where the lawyer will talk and the defendant just sits there he just sits there the lawyer talks Church I hope we can do that by God's grace I hope we can let the word talk for us amen hallelujah now try to make excuses where I would have done this or I should have done this all right but let Christ the word speak for us amen because he's our defense counsel hallelujah and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world but they have to believe and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commands he that saith I know him and keepeth not his commands is a liar and the truth is not in him so how could you say you know God and know the blood and then don't deny what that voice is saying above you can't John says if you love God you'll keep his commands because he has his Mercy's forgiving us it like that he's giving you the mercy seat so I added some words can you see the words I had there Christ the Advocate our defense attorney the mercy seat all right and the law is the judge we'd say this is a court system the laws the judge but we have a defense witness we have a defense counsel we must have faith in Christ's blood and then God speaks to us from there how many know that the Bible said the church is a judgment is a courtroom remember we preach on that first John I'm sorry first Peter 3:17 that judgment begins we're at the house of God every time we do or don't come to church this is the courtroom right here by God's grace how many understand that God will speak to us and like that sometimes I just like to step off to the side because it's not me if God speaks behind this desk or this pulpit this is where God speaks right through the fivefold ministry so if we believe Christ is our defense and we have faith in Christ blood and we accept what God is saying then God's life will speak to us and we can't say we know God and not keep the commands for what he's saying up here we can't do that because we love the word so much we love God so much that anything this anyone that would forgive me and spare my life I would do anything to serve them and that's how it is with Christ if he spares us and eyes for us then we should live for him I think there's one more in perpetuation first John 4:9 and this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him here in his love and that we loved God I'm sorry here in his love not that we loved God it was he's not our works but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation of our sins so the cover beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another so in God's courtroom only Christ has righteousness you and I we have no righteousness we can bring praise God because second Peter 1:1 tells me that Simon Peter a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen you've obtained faith through whose righteousness how did you get righteous in God's courtroom it was Christ's righteousness amen so if grace and justification is free how are so many lost if this is free and such a powerful gospel why are so many lost well the Bible says they fall back or retreat from the gift of God in other words they turn their back and run from the gift of God or they turn their back and run away from the preaching of the gospel that's what the Bible says that's why so many will be lost they won't just sit and listen and let faith but faith cometh by what hearing they won't even sit and hear the humble word of God Church you're so blessed if you're here in the humble Word of God tonight and you're receiving it praise to the heart you're so blessed it's not Jesus plus it is Jesus alone amen look at I saw the Bible said he failed grace he failed the gift of God and God hated Esau looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God lest any root of bitterness we talk preach on that recently springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled member or East always bitter towards his parents bitter towards Jacob how was he bitter well he was bitter anyone to kill Jacob so he had a murdering spirit on him instead of giving grace to Jacob and grace towards his parents he was bitter toward them right he in other words he turned his back on the gift of God the grace of God he said I'm gonna just I want to murder I want to just I want to marry as many wives I would be a fornicator I'm not gonna marry a Christian we'd say I'm not gonna wear a Jewish woman I'm not gonna I'll just do despite God's grace so he turned his back on the gift of God so see when we turn our backs on the word of god we're turning our backs on the grace of god the grace of god remember the bible said this now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the same you save me of the souls that help by God's grace you see that's how so many people will be lost it's so free God is offering his arms wide open he wants everybody to be saved why are so many lost they know what that they don't want it they draw back they'd rather live and have these feelings and and do their will then humble themselves and believe on God's gift look what drawback means Church it means a timid the timid timidity of one stealthily retreating so it's retreating right it's a it's a soldier who retreats in there in the midst of the battle it's someone who gives up fighting we have no part in shrinking back we are free from coward cowardice of etc how many brave Christians we got in here you better be brave you better stand be brave and gainst all evil right that's always sing glory because cowards turn their back for fighting and contending and believing for Christ they turn their back on that and they retreat from the war right that we're called to the battle that were called to what did Paul say he said I fought the good fight of faith I didn't retreat I didn't give up fighting I fought the good fight so that's the illustration that we see with salvation it's a fight right God gives it to us but we got to fight for it like the promised land lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and as profess a good profession before many witnesses Jude 1:3 says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend or fight strongly for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints so when you see salvation you so fall in love with God that you want to fight against God's enemy does everybody see that but those who are lost say well oh I want it's okay for me to live in sin and I want to live in sin I want enjoy the pleasure of the world so instead of fighting for God and fighting for Christ they actually retreat from from Christ and they go to the devil side we say here's another illustration Israel Israel leaving the Egypt but not possessing the promised land that's another illustration so the illustration is journey to the promised land it's the make believers or the mixed multitude that came out in Exodus 12 38 Jude says for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lawlessness right lasciviousness live any way you want you're under grace and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having say the people I land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not right why do you destroy them because they drew back instead of like Joshua and Caleb saying we can take the land we can possess the land God is with us God loves us God will help us to defeat our enemies how many feel that way tonight God will help me to feed my enemy amen God will help me overcome I'm more than able not me but because God's with me amen if I keep the Word of God there doesn't have to be a Red Cross in this camp in this church like Graham said we have to have a hospital in this church no one's going to get hurt if we just keep the loving words of our Savior amen that's the illustration for salvation they draw back and say we can do it I can't overcome smoking and drinking I can't overcome lust and I can overcome this and so they stopped fighting the good fight of faith and they draw back they're cowards and they are be brave and say I can do this because I can do all things through Christ who's in me but maybe Christ isn't in them because they're not they're not hungry for God they're not grateful they haven't that they sold out the faith or something like that right now I just thought I'd drop this in here because whether Ram brings this thought out and it deals with attitude like brother Craig preached on Sunday attitude our attitude and I want to look at our attitude just towards being saved and just being just coming to church and our attitude towards the house of God and and loving God I want you to see what brother Branham talks about this now the illustration is that Israel came out of Egypt but most of them didn't make the promise then we know that and numbers 21 said the people spake against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul oh this is like bread now wants to notice did they have bread yes they were just tired of God's bread can buddy see that they had God's bread but they just got tired of it what was wrong their attitude praise the Lord or their taste buds they're a little bit picky a little bit complacent the the bread that they once loved that was the answer their prayer is now common ly used to love it now it's common I've had it so many times I just can't we gotta have something else and the Bible said they hated this light angel bread this angel bread and the Lord swore the Lord do Oh bless your hearts you didn't mean that no he actually chasing them he sent fiery serpents among the people they bit the people much people of Israel died and then they repented after this and verse 7 they repented and God forgave them so in other words when we complain about what God has called us to do when we complain about our situation God might give us a little spankin God may God give us a little correction but we got to come back and say I'm sorry I got to change my attitude so brother here's what brother Aaron says about loathing this light bread program compares it to coming to church and I'm not making this up that you can really listen this but man said then in their chatting well we wish we were back in Egypt our souls loathe this light bread in other words if I take it historically now that's what they said now in the modern day this would be oh every Wednesday night prayer meeting every Sunday morning back to church what do we hear the same thing the preacher stand up and preach songs he said go on back so what does a prophet how does the Prophet try to relate loathing your light bread to come into church and getting tired of coming to church just the same thing see that complaining attitude right how many believe it was a prophet how many believe you know what he's talking about see then you're just going line-of-duty see it's no longer love now it's lost your love you're not a worshipper then a worshipper goes there to worship to express himself before his God to praise God for His goodness to every word he hangs on to it remember I was I'm gonna do my next video after a revelation I'm gonna do my next video on Ty's money and the Bible and God told those men he said when you come to church you got to come three times a year think about that only come to church three times a year we wouldn't get very close to God would we we get tired we get lazy right we all do it right but he said you come three times and he said don't come empty he said bring something with you now think about that is that how we come today I come here with something in my heart to give to Jesus Christ did you come that way today my RAM said if we just come and complain about coming to church he said that we're not worshiping the right way our attitude has to be I'm coming to bring Jesus praise tonight for whatever he gave me a week of work he provided for my needs he gave me this sir he's on this he died for me amen if you have nothing else he died for you praise God if you've lost all your natural blessings in your job you can say truly the Lord gives and the Lord takes away he could say blessed be the name of the Lord amen he gave me salvation through Jesus Christ so that's how brother branham relates people complaining oh another Wednesday night service all's we do is sing and pray and this isn't here preaching again another Sunday service be careful Church just be careful spiritual Israel you don't want to loathe the bread of God but see a real worshiper hangs on to every word I'm gonna need this now listen church someone might need this tomorrow you're gonna talk to they might be so discouraged and you might be the vessel God's gonna use to bring that to them right like on Sunday Monday we had a guy work come and put some windows in for us and I was so stirred up from Sunday I had a word just a witness to him I got the witness to him he never called me back I gave my car and everything like that but I was just so stirred up I said are you a Christian and I started telling my I said I'm a Jesus fanatic you know I'd go to church three times a week and we love the Lord and jesus healed my amount of cancer and it was just flowing out see because I had something to give the word that I heard had impacted me and I want to give it out to somebody and that's what we have to be so I'm saying the word tonight well it might be something you need for tomorrow how about when Satan tries to discourage you tomorrow what can you say I'm not saved by my works I want to do better Christ will help me do better I'm saved by grace I am going to heaven because he freely gave me the ticket to heaven praise God I believe in Christ he freely gave me freely justified me I'm justifying the sight of God amen bromance is just like a love affair so he compares coming to church as the love affair if you was going with the girls who talks about a boy courting a girl because you knew it was a duty or you're going with the boy when you were young mama wants me to go with this guy but I just can't stand them imagine a arranged marriage aren't you glad you don't have arranged marriages it's what if you really didn't like that person that's her brother Brahim says that's what he compares about your attitude to coming to church well I guess I got to go to church he that's like a girl this is when I guess I got a date this guy I guess I got a court this guy I don't really like him he said you don't get nothing from him you don't get nothing of him coming to see you why does this guy keep coming to see me why is this why do I keep coming to see this girl my mom wants me to come date this girl or be with this girl he said that's your attitude you go with her but she bores you mama wants you to go with her because she's the type of girl that mama likes see it bores you there's no love affair but you don't care you don't want to clean up you don't want to go see her why it's a horrible thing and when he's coming to see him I just wish he'd hurry and go home that's not how I was with my wife I I took a shower you know before I go see my wife you know comb my hair I got my nicest shirt on sprayed some Cologne on I wanted to impress her I want to know that I cared about her I was in love with her that's the same way it is with you why does he preach so long because that's when I go this with what I battle all the time right as a preacher why does he gotta preach so long again tonight that means you're not in love with me or you're not in love with Christ but brother Han says you need to be in love with the Christ inside of the person well Jessie might have some problems I might I must i-i've said inside but you should still love the Christ inside of me see so same thing getting ready to be married coming to church same thing and I'm not making this up listen to this tonight it's 1961 July 23rd he said see you're not loved what about all this stuff you see but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning hanging on every word that might be what he's has been talking to you about holding on its eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church this and under any circumstance if we could just see that church I think it'd help our attitudes wouldn't it if we could see every time I go to church it's a joy I remember brother Ram said he never went to church and regretted one time he never left saying oh I knew I should not I went you know because it's not between him and the people it's between him and God right in other words his love he loved the people but his main love was he's going there to see Christ and to hang on every word for eternal life amen see it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance whether it's hot cold indifferent whether people are fussing growling whatever they're doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord then you're in love with Christ and you love to go to church well honey here at Sunday morning again I guess we have to wash up the young ones and get down there my it's bore 'some he said you're not loved but if you really love you just can't wait til Sunday morning comes and you've got to get down there with them and we get and we leave the people of God they don't bore you why they're brothers and sisters as I used to say you get as thick as sorghum molasses on a cold morning it don't run it just stays together you know clings tight now that's a rude expression but it's trying to let you know what I mean you see you stick together the colder gets the tighter they stick that's the way it ought to be with us the harder it gets as the years go on the more we should stick together right because we're the family of God and here's where he says that and what we love is each other it's not because that we're somebody because it's the Christ in one another that we love I love the Christ in you you should love the Christ in me right and not complain about what's going on right if something's wrong it's called talk to the person correct it if not hang on every word and try to see what Christ is trying to get you to see tonight that's right weatherman talks about how we should have the church atmosphere well Graham said I travel around the world a lot this is from Israel the church 1953 and the stickiest nastiest places the lay down is in the desert everything there has got a sticker on it you know why every kind of little old weeds a cactus you can't lay down know where it's sticking you the reason of it is then don't got no water water makes it soft where there's lots of waters you don't have any thorns and thistles where there's lots of water and I tell you brother you take an old church that's dry this bone and no Holy Ghost in it and no salvation no divine healing no power of God no shouting no joy and it's always this oh she did this and he done that and he then this sticker sticker sticker see when people are complaining well add them to this and Lydia did that and brother Jesse to that when people are complaining about one another there's no real joy there's God's Spirit can't move there's no water there right but we need water we need rain to pour out on us tonight Amen that's right what you need is a good old-fashioned out a gusher of the Holy Ghost to soften up a little bit in other words to love people a little bit love them that means so be it but now look brother branham Tabernacle needs a good dose of that - that's right so look he tells the church that he's pastor we need a dose of that what if I said we need a dose of a Holy Ghost gusher in here would you agree well would you pray for that so let's see it's a pass or telling the church we need the water of God we need the Holy Spirit we need some salvation in here amen we need some we use some Holy Ghost power we need the vine healing in here we need a power of God we some shouting in here we need some joy in here we need some love in here amen hallelujah amen you know like I said you know we've had people come in recently and then leave and you might have saw me so joyful and yes and I'm so sorry the people left but I can still have joy even when people leave because I've got salvation glory you have salvation we can even if people leave and they don't receive it or they fall away or their ground is stony or their ground is full of thorns we can still have joy in our salvation and we can still pray and intercede for them because remember you are a priest you are supposed to intercede for them I did talk to one of the brothers have left I talked to his mother this week so keep them in prayer they're going through some hard times keep them in prayer by God's grace but see that doesn't take away our joy we can still have joy in Christ God saved us God can save them let's not be too feeding to complain let's have a Holy Ghost gusher amen let's be happy about it amen happy about what Christ has done for us you say you're happy brother Ram sure I'm happy how can I keep from being happy and know what I know hallelujah how can we know what we know and not be happy how can we know God has loosed the seven seals and not be happy about that how can we know that we even baptized the right way we're not sprinkled and it's not the titles we even baptize the right way and not be happy about it Corey went over 1 million people having baptized is wrong you and I should be happy about it Amen to know what we know we know ro we know the position of the bride and the the Jews we know all these things how can we not be happy Church Oh hallelujah glory he said Christ save me and fill me with the Holy Ghost give me a ticket to heaven I'm just having a big time go and say come on all of you yes sir hallelujah don't you love the Lord tonight Church Oh My thank you Jesus how can I know what I know and not be happy tonight amen that's beautiful church that's beautiful just getting back to the joy of our salvation mmm salvation is by faith it's a revelation right we said this earlier I'm not ashamed the gospel it's the power of God t that believeth for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith the preaching of the word the gospel the good news Christ is here to save us Christ here to fill us Christ is here to heal us to give us joy he was victory that good news is revealed to us through the preaching right and that brings a righteousness to us and it goes from faith to the next revelation from the first revelation to the next revelation to the next revelation as it is written the just shall live by faith how many hungry for another revelation brother Ram said the thing you pray for the most is what revelation which is faith how many need a how many need a fresh vision from the Lord I mean a fresh revelation of am I gonna be healed or is this person gonna be saved we should that's why we come to hear the word of God so we can go from faith to the next faith to the next revelation to the next understanding that's how we approach the Lord so now I added I added just a few words here faith in Christ blood this is the only righteousness at church is Christ's righteousness praise the Lord we still have crises our defense we've got the law we're guilty of the law but we've got a cover for the look our selves Christ is our cover Christ is our cover but the only thing righteous about this place is Christ Jesus hey man and then God will speak to us if we come that way hallelujah hey men first Peter 2:24 said who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness to see if Christ is our righteousness and we should try to live righteous by whose stripes you were healed so Christ bore our sin so we should and will live unto righteousness the word righteous here I believe the right meeting there's three me I'm sorry one two there's four meetings I believe it's this one we should live unto righteousness in tegrity virtue we should have strength with virtue means strength purity of life rightness correctness of thinking feeling and acting we should live if we have Christ's righteousness we should live a righteous life we should have a strenght strong life a life of integrity little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous amen and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ of Son Living God and Jesus answering said him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father so faith was a revelation he same into that faith was a revelation we have no works that justify us before God Galatians 3:10 tells us this for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident or it's some clear no man is justified by the law but works for the Josh I live by faith hey hey man we live by faith substance inside of us we live by that praise the Lord Romans 4:3 for what saith the scripture abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness just just by believing he believed what God said God made him righteous now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness so can I use a quick illustration here the thief on the cross here's the scripture about the thief on the cross they just use a quick quick quick illustration he was a murdering thief is everybody understand that that's why he was dying that's why he was crucified he was a murderous thief right so yeah and the Bible said no man that murders has eternal life so he didn't have eternal life he was a murderer but Jesus gave him salvation and justified him just by his attitude that's what brother Craig was preaching that's a brother branham's preaching just your attitude determines your eternal destination right your attitude towards the gospel well so what was his attitude he rebukes the man that's rebuking Jesus and says don't you fear God seeing thou are in the same condemnation so what did he have Church he had fear of the Lord and fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so see he had the first step to being wise he had fear of God don't you fear God and we indeed justly so we deserve this for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man had done nothing amiss so he feared God and he also recognized that God's servant was a true servant he's done nothing wrong he considered his sacrifice a righteous sacrifice right a pure sacrifice he's pure I'm impure how many can say that tonight I'm impure but Christ is pure amen I do things that are impure and of course when I confess them yes then my mind is pure yelling and there's no accusations against me in heaven but overall we do impure things but Christ is always pure amen and so and he said unto Jesus Lord so look even calls him Lord you're my ruler Jesus is my ruler I fear God Jesus is perfect hey men he's my Lord and he gives a simple request remember me when you come into your kingdom how many want Christ to remember that may men I always wanted to remember my prayers remember my my love for him remember me Jesus and without coming into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him in a matter of minutes verily I say in you today thou shalt be with me in paradise praise God how is this man justified was it his works all's he did was look at the blood of Jesus and say this man is perfect I fear God right he says remember me when you come into your kingdom you're pure you're the word I'm guilty and Jesus said you're saying Amen you're justified hallelujah because your attitude towards the word was the right attitude aren't you thankful for the Word of God amen this gives us such great hope see we we become the righteousness of God when we're believing in Christ we become his righteousness free I've made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him see we've got to be in Christ we got to have faith in Christ and then we become the righteousness of God when we're believing in Christ and this was seen on the day of atonement remember the day of atonement Aaron had to lay both his hands on the the goat the live goat in this case not the scapegoat but the live goat and when he laid his hands on him he confessed all the knick Matiz of the children of Israel and all their transgressions and all their sins and they're put on the head of that goat right david Tolman remember this was this was on top of all the other sacrifices they had knew right so if the Jewish priest rabbi was reading this the Torah and he said you've done this sin you have to do this sacrifice they had to go to that sacrifice but once a year God said if you miss any sins I'm gonna put it all on this goat right here if you've forgotten to make any sins and Church how many of us forget sometimes they do think we should do we forget we forget to make this rider forget to do that so God said because of that I'm gonna take one day and I'm gonna put all the sins of everybody on this one goat and the Bible said they kill the goat now I'm skipping verse 29 but it says for on that day show the priests make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before God so God foreshadow this all the sins of the sin all those sins of the people were on the live goat that would be killed and then the people were then righteous how many thankful that all your sins were placed upon Christ are you thankful for that tonight amen and now you are righteous you are clean through what he did are you living my faith tonight the just shall live by faith tonight amen when are we made the righteousness of God when we have faith or believe as soon as you believe the Bible said God imputes it to you for righteousness right and the scripture is Romans 4 with with Abraham come with this blessing us upon them the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision only for we say that faith was reckoned or imputed to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned how was it given to Abraham when he was in circumcision or uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision we know that when was Abraham righteous was that once he got circumcised and got the token or was it when he first believed the Bible said when he first believed he was already righteous before in other words before he got the baptism the Holy Ghost he was already righteous in the sight of God Amen that ought to be an encouragement and he received the sign of circumcision which is the type of the Holy Ghost a seal see a type of the Holy Ghost a seal a seal the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised okay hope everybody can see this I didn't I should have put a picture of this up there but abraham believed God so when God called him and he believed now he's righteous in the sight of God he became the righteousness of God he was a righteous person it wasn't when he got circumsized a few years later and got the token it was as soon as he believed so for us that means we are righteous in the sight of God as soon as we repent me baptize and as soon as we believe were righteous how many understand that by God's grace we are righteous and God recognizes that before you're born again because look what I said about lot the Bible said and delivered just lot justified yet he was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with her unlawfully deeds so here's lot living among homosexuality and God said he was already righteous because he believed God did he live as high as Abraham not even close but did God forgive him and it was he saved he was saved so remember I preached this back in November of 2016 the foolish versions are saved but there's going to be few of them they're gonna be safe what's the word foolish mean it means foolish and pious or godless now it's not godless because they do have God working in their lives but they're foolish they don't take the time to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost what's a virgin mean there's two definitions this is the one that works for us best because spiritually we're kind of foolish virgin a man who has abstain from all uncleanness and whoredom attendant on idolatry has kept his chastity one who has never had relations with women but we're looking at the spiritual foolish virgin they don't have any uncleanness or any idolatry they just never got borned again program said virgin means purity they were all good people every one of them burgeoned sanctified vessels of god he calls them but those who had oil in their lamps went in and the others was left out they were all virgins everyone people that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong look at that church look at that then they they everyone believe in the coming of the Lord they are ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil go out my butt man and said don't let that be your case don't let your oil go out keep oil in your lamp oil is the spirit the Holy Spirit never let it drain from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to Christ and to the cause quickly go to him who has the fountain of oil and buy for yourself a filling of the Holy Spirit hallelujah you see that by God's grace a foolish version is pure to everything you know he said you can't put a finger and say at work he compromised at work I got him there you can't put a finger on it oh he compromised at church I put it I got him there at church I put his thing oh there at home he come for my ice at home you can't put your finger on him that's how close they're living to God how many believe that honey bee program said that my program said the sleeping version that went out to meet the bridegroom they let the oil gather lamp they never entered into this the baptism Holy Ghost they never let Christ take control so he could work miracles and speak with tongues and do wonders and things to prove that he lived in his church honey want Christ to take control oh we should all desire that Christ take full control of my life take full control of me tonight every night so you can manifest yourself and me to your glory the foolish version doesn't do this they don't give Christ all the control in their lives we got to give him all the control of our lives amen now look about and says here this is questions and answers he's talking about at the time of the tribulation the Gentile bride is in heaven the sleeping version the Gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but she's been rejected in the bride so the reason I read that is that so you know there are people walking around in the nomination today and also message churches that are saved but they're not born again but they are righteous in the sight of God amen they're justified in the sight of God because God justifies them as soon as they believe and as long as they're living all that they know then they are a virgin to the word aren't you glad they're pure to the word honey want to be pure to every word that no matter what's being preached to me when Craig's preaching in her brother cam wherever that when I hear I'm pure to that and I say yes Lord I want to live that or I believe that I want to be pure to every word of God amen remember said the first virgin she's already saved see because as soon as they believe just like Abraham they're already righteous they're righteous because the Bible said God gives them faith and when they have faith are trusting in the blood Jesus Christ their righteous brother Graham goes on to say this now look she's not saved during that time the tribulation she's saved now from the eternal death so the booze version is not saved from going through the tribulation but she is saved from the lake of fire can I say like that they were under sin that I just want to make sure you see that the foolish version walks around saying I believe the foolish version a lot of them since there's very few of them I believe a lot of them are in the message churches that's hard to say because there are so many people and in churches but you have to live all the word you have to love God so much that you live everything that he tells you most people have turned their back on the word right they go to church but when the word says this they turn their back on it or so most of the preachers the preachers turn their back on the word and they won't preach the word the truer to the people so that's hurting the people we don't hurt the people we want to save the people praise God we want to help the people we want to preach the for word of God [Music] alright I'm gonna skip past that quote yeah here brother have said they're just gonna be a few of them go in a few foolish version we know that as was the days of Noah eight souls were saved so shopping the coming of the Son of Man there's just a few soul saved I don't say eight might be eight hundred I don't know how many eight thousand I don't know might be eight million so look it's gonna be a small number compared to the number that are lost very few people's in other words very few people love Christ so much that they want to live all the Word of God that's why we can say what seven slowly ghosts remember it's living all the word for your age that's the true evidence the proof that you're a holy ghost feel description you live all the word you love all the word for your age hey now what brother Adam say his message was he said my message is exactly today what is this message justification sanctification the baptism Holy Ghost did he leave out justification no that's still part of his message right sanctification is still part of I'm glad brother branham preach sanctification so I could be sanctified he just preached on the Holy Ghost all the time he pries justification sanctification and the baptism Holy Ghost Luther just preached basically justification but that's the message that's our message aren't you thankful for that message you thankful for that amen I got a few more here let me close I want you to see that I had all these other scriptures he had all these other scriptures I want to read through I never ever have enough time to preach all I like to preach so let's just let's just go here and we have a couple more slides now remember I've taught this and I believe this is the revelation of the hour the statue perfect man is listed over here the three works of grace are next to it side by side when a person gets justified they're righteous they receive faith right because they go from faith to faith they get baptized when they get baptized they're justified and then the Holy Spirit sanctifies them through these six works then they get the baptism Holy Ghost then in the eyes of God their holy but the Bible said they're righteous down here does everybody understand that by the grace of the Lord that's what the teaching is for our day he says my message justification same occasion the Bachelors of Holy Ghost and they said you can't be born again do you have all the virtues flowing through you you so you can't have charity until all the virtues are flowing through you O God flow through me amen Holy Spirit flow through me hallelujah in closing go to first Peter chapter I'm sorry 2nd Peter chapter one let's go there 2nd Peter chapter 1 let's look at that stature I know I know a couple months ago I into the Sermon on the statue over man but remember Peter said I'm always gonna remind you of this even after I'm dead I want you to remember the statue of a perfect man that's how important this is because if you love Christ and if you're really saved you want to go on you want God to use you and you want to go on and add more of Christ your life more of Christ more faith from faith to faith how many believe that amen glory I like that so the statue of man is just like adding from faith to faith and on now verse 3 if anybody lacks any spiritual thing in here tonight I just want to remind you that you can have it you might lack it now but you can have it praise the Lord because the Bible says right here verse 3 accordin has divine power is given unto us what all things anything you're lacking all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue so you if you're lacking some tonight stay pray and say God you promised I can have this and I'm hanging on to your promise you're gonna give it to me you said I have all things I need for godly life amen and be like Israel I'll go take the land I'll walk my way to that I'm gonna believe my way to that and God's gonna give it to me exactly right and how do you get at verse 4 by promise you've got to claim the promise you and I I have to claim the promise we all have to claim the promise for what we need whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious what promises that by these can number say by these can we say that by these by what by the promises by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so see that you and I are not going to express divine power of God without believing God's promise hey you got to believe it you and I have to believe it I have to believe God's going to give me a victory over let's say temper or God's going to God has brought me the victory over lust or greed or arrogance or pride and if I claim that promise then God is going to allow that promise to come to come to manifestation or material in my life amen that's how I partake of divine nature through the promise of God amen verse 5 I lose my voice I'm I got to stop here in a minute mercy and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance temperance patience and to patience goddess and godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now look at verse 9 that's what I want to get to but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see far off and he has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin he forgot he was justified if people aren't constantly yielding to the Holy Spirit and having faith and virtue and letting all these they forget they have spiritual amnesia I forgot that I was a messege believer I forgot that I'm living the word for the hour I forgot I was even saved I forgot what how glorious my baptism was like I forgot how glorious the preaching used to feel to me they forgot and it's not God's fault it's their attitude right it's their attitude their loathing the life the bread their loathing God's bread instead of hanging on and believing every word just becomes common and usually that's why because they're flirting with Delilah they're flirting with the world they're feeding on other things so the word of gods doesn't seem as doesn't seem as exciting as it used to feel and then when that happens we get spiritual amnesia we forget what we should be and we forget we're even even justified the Bible said you forgot you were purged from your old sins you forgot you were justified forgiven for so an entrance shall be ministered under you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always and remembers of these things Peter was always gonna remind them about the stature of man though you know them so see you've already heard it preached and be established in the present truth yeah I think at me as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus has showed me moreover I will endeavor that he may be able after my decease to have these things always and remembrance let's say into our feet Peter said I always want you to remember this there will be an entrance to heaven for you if you keep believing if you keep going from faith to faith from revelation to revelation hungry on every word of God feeding on every word of God rising in spiritual things amen I'm glad I want to rise in spiritual things Church I want to rise I want to grow in spiritual things so just ask yourself do we believe Luther's teaching our justification absolutely I'm saved not by my works I'm saved by the grace I'm saved by the blood of Jesus Christ it's not my blood on the mercy seat it's Christ's blood on the mercy seat it's not what I did it's what Christ did and do we feel justified tonight that's why I want you to think about for a minute let's just bow our heads here let's just take a few minutes and talk to Jesus do we feel like Christ has taken all of our sins or have we forgotten what the cross actually did have we forgotten how free it was and we don't have to work our way into it we just have to believe the promise have we forgotten these things let's take a moment and think about that with our heads bowed let's think about this here just for a moment it's worth our time it's worth any effort and any remembrance that we can put into these spiritual things it's so valuable where we have to hang on every word Heavenly Father Lord tonight we thank you for this night dear Lord we thank you for the word that we've heard the just those that are justified or righteous will live by faith hallelujah and faith is a substance hallelujah inside of us Lord God tonight Lord we thank you for the remembrance of these things Lord God as a pastor Lord I feel like it's my responsibility Lord God as Peter did to remind the people Lord that we never forget or we never get negligent we never neglect our spiritual lives because we don't want to forget how much you've done we don't want to forget the cross we don't want to forget how the blood paid the price for our sins we don't want to get prideful we don't want to get distracted we want to be forever Lord remembering what you've done for us Lord that will give us joy in the house of God that will make us hang on every word when we hit when we realized I'm not saved because I'm a preacher I'm not saying because I quit chewing tobacco I'm not saying because I did anything I'm saved by God's love by His grace for me father let it be a reality tonight Lord God I believe every now and then Lord the Holy Spirit leads us Lord God to go back and look at that as Peter said go back and look how do we feel do we feel justified do we have that peace with God that we talked about Lord and I thank you for the peace of God tonight Jesus I thank you for that that we can have that with you Lord as we walk in the light we talk with you we fellowship with you Lord God we discuss our lives we discuss what we've gone through what we've seen what we've heard what we've done we talk it over and you freely forgive us because you're our defense counsel you're our lawyer there you're the one who gives us the advice you're the one that gives us our coverage you speak for us Lord God your word speaks for us and we're grateful for that Laura let us not draw away from this good fight of faith fighting for Christ Jesus fighting for the gospel fighting for holiness fighting for the truth fighting for the mysteries revealed fighting for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we not draw back and give up Lord we don't want to draw back Lord God we don't want to be cowered spiritually we want to stand and testify and if no one else believes that we want to stand and be brave and believe it Lord God firts your promise and we're partakers of the divine nature through the promises you left to us granite Jesus hallelujah help us to stand help us to be strong and brave Lord God hallelujah Lord we thank the Lord tonight Lord I'm humbled Lord in your presence Lord God I'm humbled by your word thank you for these beautiful reminders about
