tonight at Jesus Christ II never said Amen god bless you may be seized here but I'd like to come give us a special surprise the Lord Amen let's give you a round pause a minute please guys thank the Lord God is so good to us so like I was saying earlier you know when we get the Bibles in and the message books and the church age books feel free to take whatever you want you can take any books tracts you went out there by God's grace or bless you buddy bless you sir amen praise God as long as I've been going to this message Church maybe two or three years I've always known that I belonged here but I never knew what my calling in life go soon or what what I needed to do in my life and God just answer that today I mean it's very very got a simple thing but uh you know I was always looking at up oh look I needed to administer or something I just needed something that to serve God you know but I was looking at it wrong and uh today up God spoke to to my wife during service Sangha seek him home today and she told me that God spoke to her and that that soon as opposed to tell me what my personal life loss and that is very simple it was just disturbed me and I look past that so many times always think you had to do something for him but it was this there and put in my eyes speak out revelation rang in your eyes but then you know no it's a guy reviews it to you I just feel refreshed and ah dude I got a purpose in life now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] appreciate that testimony let's go around

[Applause] [Music] thank God amen thank you sir let's do our feet praise God yeah I thought that was the one where I'll go with him to the garden you know so I thought so thank you sir appreciate it amen praise the Lord okay let's go to Revelation chapter 3 I want to continue on the church ages tonight when I studied yesterday in prayer I just felt like I want to try to get a little bit further here try to finish this up I have a couple series lined up I'm gonna do Lord willing as soon as I get done with the church ages I've had this burden for a couple years now to preach a series on the entire life of Christ I know that's a pretty big series that kinda that's why I know it's not me because I wouldn't approach that thought it's gonna be it's got to be God you know because you know we spent so much time on our message doctrines which was great we've covered many of them I was looking at the series a brother branham John preach on demonology and so I've just been feeling led because brother none makes a statement where the bride has her ministry has to match Christ's ministry earthly ministry before the rapture and so if we examine Christ's ministry I think we can gain a lot of wisdom because no one ever lived like him and I don't live like Jesus so I've that's where I've been I'm writing down all these thoughts you know and just trying to prepare for this tremendous series yeah maybe it'd be short I don't know but I've had a burden to look at that series and I want to finish the ephesians 1 let me go back to the david series as well i never finished that series but i've surely been enjoying this church ages this is but i've got so many of us say the lord to me personally i feel like i've received so many of the seit the lord's and I can see why brother BAM said it was so necessary for us in this hour now Wednesday night Lord willing or by God's race when the night we looked at the open door and I finished the open door by God's grace head alright four or five services just on the open door there's so much in there so we're gonna go to revelation 3:9 everybody men you have to leave at five brother for your work but you know work tonight well glory amen you know I've been texting back and forth and some nights he has to work at six so I told him I said if you come from four to five I'll try to close right at five so he doesn't miss anything you know and that just gives me a little break to I don't know if you noticed but my voice has really come back you know God has given me some grace and my voice has come back so I'm very thankful to the Lord for that and I kind of overdosed on my wife made me some cough drops and they had nits in them and I hope they are I overdosed on him but they really helped me but now I got like a rash you see I you could see like a red rash around my mouth cuz I had too much meant but it really helped my throat so I'll take this because my throat feels really like it comes back like I was screaming and preaching in North Carolina and then the next day you know it came back a little bit so I do want to thank the Lord for that revelation 3:9 but we just want to thank the Lord for all the Saints coming out to the house of Lord tonight in God will bless you for your service as we as we try to seek more revelation tonight's message you know in the church age book is going to deal with the false Jew we're look at the judgment of false Jew and it's always good to look at the false so you can know the true that's why it's so important you remember a couple well I should say three weeks ago I preached on the dole hearing did I don't had him over here I think sister when he was here you know Connie was here but I'm not sure who was able to hear it but brother Branham makes a statement he said what is me preaching and me preaching he took us back to Hebrews 10 you remember that where he said those people that partake of the word of God and then trample on it he said that's the me preaching that's like Judas so when we can show when we can show what a real Christian looks like that's deep preaching but we have to contrast that to someone who hangs around because a make believer I'm sorry because unbelievers not gonna deceive the elect in other words there won't be it's easy to pick out an unbeliever you know I could Pharaoh or something like that it's easy to pick that out it's more challenging to identify that tear and so what we want to see we want to look at our lives and not point at people and say there's a tear there's a tear but it's Lord help me to learn from this situation like jesus said remember Lot's wife stir up my mind by remembering me reminding me what I must live like and what I must avoid that's why we want to look at these things program so this is me preaching so he also called me preaching trying to got a service without doing his will so that's making sure every single thing in our life lines up with God's Word that's beautiful amen hallelujah relation 39 behold I'll make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I'll make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I love thee and we know thing that we've already preached little bit on this the way that they know Jesus loves them is because Jesus lets them sit on the throne with him amen that's how we're to prayer every need on your heart just making known unto God tonight Heavenly Father God we just stand in awe of you we thank you for your mercy thank you for the word that you're still revealing today we realize lord god there's so much word that we can still learn there's still much there's much growth we can have in our lives if the rapture has been pushed back Lord God or if the rapture isn't for however many days or months or years that means there's time for us to bear much fruit lord help us to bear much fruit we know every man will be judged according to his works Lord God we know that because faith is produced I'm sorry because faith produces works and every man has to have faith so Lord just take this time make it real special to us we pray speak to our hearts Jesus Christ name the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God so now I can switch over when you're ready all right so we're reminding ourselves it's the Philadelphia Church age and then messenger John Wesley seven his life was 1703 to 1791 praise the Lord now I didn't have a chance to put the date up there cuz I was wondering yesterday if I was gonna preach it or not but it's Sunday January 7th p.m. so I'll add that have to add that later but this is part 51 in the series so I'm thankful to the Lord for giving us these numerous messages praise God okay so let's look at the judgment of the false Jew you'll find this in the church age book this is page 310 in there by the grace of the Lord now we read our scripture there and the part we're going to focus on in the scripture is that yellow part which say they're Jews and are not but do lie behold I'll make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I love thee so Jesus is he promises them if you overcome I'm gonna make all these liars recognize that you're the ones that I actually loved now don't get wrong he had God had a love a sovereign love that he died to save everybody but there's only the only the elect have a special kind of love because only elect really know him through the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're the only ones that really know because remember he told the Matthew 7 he told those people he said I never knew you depart from me that work iniquity so they never they never came in to know Christ he never came into a personal relationship into a filling of the Holy Ghost it never came into that aren't you glad you know Jesus aren't you glad Jesus loves you and one day he's gonna show all these lying people that say they're Christians all the liars now we don't know who they are necessarily we have a lot of we have a lot of corrupt fruits we can see and identify but really we don't know until the day of judgment really and so he's gonna make them to know the ones that he did love now the the profit rights now we can note immediately that this problem of the false Jew or false believers was already in existence in the Second Age I don't know if you remember that those who falsely call themselves Jews appeared right after the first outpouring of the first age and now they appear again in the second age after the Reformation did you notice that in the church age book I made these yellow they had to battle the synagogue of Satan remember that and then now it's repeated if you read in that even the scripture it says that they both had the battle the synagogue of Satan and the brother Graham said it's because God first at outpouring in that previous age God outpour up horde the day of Pentecost so Satan sets up his synagogue and then brother have said God poured out his Reformation period in the time of Luther so Satan comes around and mimics it again with his own church which say they're the believer but they're lying okay so that's that's a great observation the Prophet makes you know outpouring and then Satan mimics he's always impersonating but man so this is hardly an accident indeed it is not accident it is the principle of Satan so now you know the principle of God he's the same yesterday today and forever and now you know the principles Satan that principle is to organize so see make a Creed get a belief system that you cling to and you don't receive anymore new revelation that's that's his that's his principle try to get the people to organize around what they know right now so see so that means they're not hungry for more of God they just want to stay lukewarm in their current beliefs they're not open to God giving them more see and they claim originality and therefore they feel like they're entitled to special rights and privileges let me show you back there in the Somerton age these people lied and said they were actually jews or believers when they were definitely not they were of the synagogue of satan they were satan's organized crowd for it was in that age we saw the start of men in the ministry taking an unwarranted leadership over there ministering brethren bishop set up in districts over elders okay so hopefully we don't never see this in the message where brother Jesse tries to be the bishop over the other churches that's that's praying ask God for that never to happen that was the synagogue of Satan because now man is in control of man but God wants the Holy Ghost in charge of man that's why as much as I love brother Brooks or brother Craig they're not the pastor I'm the pastor you know I can gain wisdom from them but I don't call them up and ask them how to run the church I pray and ask God I guess God for the word of God and I've had to learn that you know to slowly learn that you know just to just pray you just pray myself I can ask for advice and things like that but I've learned that you know but this is how it was manifest the principle of Satan get man over man get men leading man get men trustee and men more than the power of God that something Paul said I when I came amongst you I didn't try to no impress you mess with my words he said I tried to know Jesus Christ and him crucified that your faith was saying the power of God amen the power of the Holy Spirit not the wisdom of man that's right he said they were he said the next thing we saw was that in the Third Age there was definitely a place called Satan's seat which was the literal city of Pergamos remember he went from the city of Babylon to Pergamos that neuroma number we learned on the church age it's a literal seat of Satan because the Bible said the Vatican is the cage of unclean and hateful bird that age gave us church and state marriage with the power of the state behind her the church was literally physically invincible now sometimes we complain about the time we live in church but we've actually got it pretty good because they could literally kill you now we know what's coming to that but its members happen this second age we have the revival here Satan mimicked it with a sin of Satan with false Christians they were claiming to be original claiming to be the true church and then after that what came marriage of church and state and now we're gonna see the same thing happen next remember the open doors Godhead Jesus is named the word all the things we enjoy today hey I'm so glad we got the name of Jesus say hallelujah now I have another slide with the Philadelphia facts next but God broke the hold in spite of the power of the state and the Reformation brought great light but what happened the Lutheran's organized and join with the state and again we see the synagogue of Satan manifested in the six-h now of course the synagogue group wouldn't say they are Satan like I'm an email this guy this Baptist about the the Godhead this week and he said all denominations are good I said every denomination is gonna take the mark of the beast I said they're all of Satan and I'm telling a guy there's on the email because they limit the Word of God they receive I'm sorry they will not receive any further revelation thought no one to say after that pardon me yeah and then he and I was I basically said that to him I said the deceived ones never know they're deceived right they never know his brother I'm saying it's the same thing here they don't know their deceit they think they're right but remember the Bible said God will give them a lie if they won't take the truth God will let them believe a lie and just so you know you know I was really struggling with this Trinity guy this week I just wanna let you know God brings fresh revelation or you can bring back previous revelation and it's just as fresh let me give you the example the gentleman in the email said he said see God is three persons in one being I said that's nonsense and so I'm sitting there you know just praying and typing and all of a sudden I felt I felt like something dropped down from heaven every now not like him that happens and the scripture came to me Hebrews 1:3 he one three humor what it says Jesus Christ is the Express image of his person so Jesus Christ is the exact duplication or replication of the person of God so the person of God is Invisibles the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ is the image of that one person not a second person he's the visible image of the person and so I said sir the literal Bible calls God one person and you're so you're saying there's three persons in one person you make God a psychological basket case because there's three person he says three persons and but the Bible said there's one person so he's noticed his words three persons in one being he won't say what the Bible said the Bible said there's one person he won't say three persons in one person because we'd all know that's blasphemy we all know that's a constant contradiction but when that dropped out I said how do I just I got real excited I called Simon Estes Simon this just dropped down from heaven I forgot all about this this is right because he can't add to the Bible the Bible says one person and if you add a Creed if you have that add the Athanasian Karina says three persons if you add that then it has to line up with the Bible if it's right but we know what's wrong so you can't say he's three persons one being you have to say he's three persons in one person and now you've got some type of mixed-up God you've got it try theism which is the worship of three gods they met and he said I think you're low confused I said you're the one that's confused I'm not gonna be used I said I'm not adding anything to the Word of God you're adding to the Word of God so that was a blessing and then Simon brought out of Scripture in job you might if we turn there real quick job thirteen I believe it's job thirteen seven I could be wrong on that but don't quote me on that let's go check it out there's a couple times the Bible said God only has one person and that beautiful the Bible it defends itself yep there it is now look at verse three surely I would speak to the Almighty and I desire to reason with God but ye are forgers of lies his three miserable comforters you guys produce lies here all physicians of no value oh that you would altogether hold your peace Oh wish you close your mouth and it should be your wisdom how I'm sorry here now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of ellipse will you speak wickedly for God and talk deceitfully for him will ye accept his person will you will ye contend for God so what his job say job was a prophet the job call him person's will you accept his person's no he said will you accept his person do you how the Bible has two or three witnesses and the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now while you're there go to Isaiah 28 because I had the same thing happened twice in one day I was so happy I that's what I called it both silent said Simon I had to striking moments just with the scripture I turned on the court of the day on that app that the voice of God sent out I try to do that and listen to the court of the day programs preaching about how the rest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he quotes Isaiah 28 because I've been in another email of a kind of battle with this other sabbatarian guy who keeps going back and forth with me on the Sabbath look at verse 11 isaiah 28:11 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear a brother branham in that quote brother BAM screamed it out he said this stammering lips and another tongue when I speak to the people he said this is the rest he said it's not a Saturday it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my just it was like you know it was just like all the burden of that email just dropped off me because we can see right here God is saying this is the rest it's the Holy Spirit amen now if you got your Bible go to first Corinthians 14 because I want you to see that in the scripture that just really helped me you know because as you know as a Christian why sometimes I forget the scriptures it was such a relief all right it's kind of hot in here is anyone else hot in here yeah can you turn and open that window again brother bang thank you sir sorry about dad know you're busy it's not good to turn the air on hot and cold you know it's got it's bad for the furnace so if we just opened the window hopefully that's okay I don't anybody fall asleep now after their supper because I I could do yesterday I did fall asleep after eating my lunch I was so tired first Corinthians 14 21 in the law it is written without with men of other tongues and other lips will I speak under this people and yet for all that they will not hear saith the Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe so verse 21 is a quotation of Isaiah 28 can you see that with stammering lips and other tongues as I speak to my people this is the rest and so Paul quotes a scripture and says with stammering lips I'll speak to this people it was the Holy Spirit praise God it was the tongues that fell on the day of Pentecost amen all right I hope you can see that now I kind of got off track there but I hope that's okay yeah they will not say they're up Satan they would never say that their say their have God but they lie for he that is a true Jew that which they claim to be as one whose Jew inwardly in the spirit so then if they are false Jews it means that as I'm sorry it means that they are as Jude 19 says having not the spirit children of God are born of the Spirit these have not the spirit and therefore they are not children of God no matter how fervently they protest and to what lengths they go to try to prove that they are Wow striking so let's look at this so we saw this earlier this repeats down here because we have the synagogue of Satan but actually comes later first the the organization of Lutheran's produce a marriage of church and state and then brother Branham said then the synagogue of satan' came in the next age so you have the same thing happening say it's Satan's principle wherever there's a wherever there's a revival what does he try to do he tries to raise up people that are not born again that are really not revived right and get them to claim that they are revived but by their works you shall know them by the word you'll know them amen now remember the false will always separate themselves from the true just like Judas Judas eventually left the true Church and that's what Jude 19 says let's go back to there Jude 19 remember this is important for us to know so we must always remember this here verse 18 Jude 18 how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit to see the Judas of our day the sinners of our day that pretend to be believers they're gonna separate themselves from the true believer right and they're gonna do it based upon the principle that they're original and then they're gonna live in their lusts praise God we got to make sure our flesh doesn't get too comfortable in this world praise God and make sure we got to do we got to go to great lengths to make sure our flesh doesn't get too comfortable and that we are able to let me say I this move up with the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit says move up dedicate more sacrifice more like this morning we got to be able to respond and say yes even if it means leaving the comfort of your life last night my wife and I were in the kitchen we were listening to what house will you build me when Perry green was dedicated orbs are ordained as the pastor there and brother Branham says he said that's what he said that's what God does he said I had everything in jeffersonville he said we had a great church revival going he said we had all these things and God had me leave all of that to come out he said to SOT he said was a spiritual desert he said I'm sure it was good while you guys were there I don't know what it is now hopefully it's a blessing now but he said all the ministers were against everybody he said it was high cost of living there wasn't good wages he said but God has to do he said sometimes the Spirit of God will cause you to do different things than you would thought and so we have to be mindful have that too that we don't get too comfortable it's the Holy Spirit wouldn't let brother Brandon get too comfortable he said around his people and with no bills and nothing to pay off the Holy Spirit wouldn't let him get uncomfortable his flesh and we must pray the same thing Lord help me to remain a faithful servant keep me from becoming comfortable in this world keep me looking to try to get out of here someday by God's grace this world is not my home right this what I mean is that Laodicea is not my home but I'd say like this this world is my home because the New Jerusalem is coming down to this world it's in one way the Kosmos are not my home but this world is my home amen my eternal home now sinners their home is lake of fire they're gonna be ultimately abolished and done away with but our home is this earth but it'll be our new earth by God's grace new heavens and new her Alleluia all right so as program said they're dead they're sensual they only know they want to live in their lusts and have the preachers and their congregation say it's okay to live in your lusts and they'll separate themselves from the true Holy Ghost filled group but barbra have said they're dead they're children of organization and the true fruits are missing see something's always going to be missing they're gonna lacking their me lacking things they're built upon their own creeds dogmas and doctrines and the truth is not in them for they have taken their own councils above the Word of God praise the Lord like brother Branham said anytime you find me off the Word of God he said meet me privately he said let's search that thing out so we can get it right do we have any doctrines at the Bride of Christ fellowship that that are off the word I hope not I don't see any but see that's how Satan slips in where we start exalting our thoughts above the Word of God we must never do that we must always have the true fruits of the Holy Spirit now he says let me show you what I've been trying to teach all along about the two vines which come from two different spirits take the example of Jesus and Judas so brother has been trying to teach us this the whole time during the church ages these two spirits two vines take the example of Jesus and Judas Jesus was the son of God Judas was the son of perdition God entered into Jesus Satan entered into Judas Jesus had a full Holy Ghost ministry because the Bible said God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him now says of Judas for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry so he had a part in the ministry but he wasn't in it all the way he wasn't fully dedicated into it there was areas of his life that were really sold out to God which was money right that's well get to so he had a part and when he called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and he all manner of sickness and all manner of disease so Judas had this power given to him he had power over all manner of sickness and all manner of disease he had a part in the ministry now I'm sure you've noticed though I'm going back to the start even so I was I'm Philadelphia I'm pulling this quote back out about Judas I'm sure you've noticed those whose names were in the book of life were a part of the religious order of the day that centered around the true God and the worship of him though they did not worship according to the truth everybody catch that Judas is gonna be right around us everybody everybody okay with I mean okay but everybody familiar with that I'm not okay with that but it just has to be that way Judas is gonna hang around he's gonna hang around he's never really gonna get cleaned out maybe if I have time I'll dig up that falsely adjustable justification quote there's a quote rogram said Judas genuinely went through justification sanctification and there's a quote where he says he did it he never did it he never believed so you have you have thoughts on both sides now scripturally I don't see how he could have generally been justified or sanctified scripturally but we have quotes on both sides so we just have to trust the Lord so we have to have Judas right amongst us somewhere and I'm not saying tonight hopefully not tonight by God's grace we don't want anyone here to be a Judas but here's what Judas didn't do he didn't go all the way with the word he left like the Bible said in Jude he separated himself he didn't have the Holy Spirit and yet he wasn't going to go to receive the Holy Spirit see how Judas was chosen of God he's instructed in truth he shared in the knowledge of the mysteries like we've seen preachers that have preached the mysteries but then walk away see it's so dangerous I'm not calling them Judas I'm just letting you know this is what Judas did he had a part and some of these guys had people I know like I heard them their testimony they prayed for people that were dead and came back to life and then left a message yeah I mean this is it's so important that we stay with the Word of God stay in the Word of God but see like Judas they walk away that's why our hearts go out that's why a lot of people I'll be honest that's why a lot of people don't reach out to people that leave the message because they're concerned it might be a Judas now should we go after the sheep of course do the Shepherd's grab for the Sheep of course every person that left this church I've gone after them now mostly for good reasons I don't have to go after that but when somebody leaves the message or goes back in the world you better believe I go after them I try to call them I try to visit them my wife told me one time gee I'm gonna say oh I'm gonna go show up at this person's house and just be waiting on the porch when they get home and she's like Jesse you better be careful you know you don't upset people I'm like yeah you're right just because I I just want them to know like I just want to save them you know what I mean I just want them to know how much I love them but I always want to respect their privacy too like can you imagine if you went to your house and somebody's waiting there to or for you sitting on your porch with the Bible you know I want to use wisdom but that's why I believe many people when you see the truth of God and then walk away they're concerned this might be a Judas and and people I think people out of concern don't maybe don't go after them because they don't want that person that person might try to influence them and pull them out so see and the Bible says that the Bible says you have to be very careful the Bible said you must approach somebody who's wrong in meekness and be careful that spirit doesn't get on you that's in Galatians 6 chapter 1 I'm sorry chapter 6 verse 1 - you have to be so strong and yes so humble when you approach someone who's overtaken lies and you'd be careful that spirit doesn't get on you because whatever here's what I've seen with people that left there so anger is brother branham they're so angry with people in the church that that spirit of anger can get on you and then you can say they'll say something bad about somebody and if you're not careful you'll pretty soon you're started greed and what happened that judgmental critical spirit just jumped on you and so you got to have enough boldness to either reject that or just say shame on you yeah that's hard that's hard key people don't like doing that and so see some message people I could understand there might be some wisdom and some of them if they feel like I'm not meek enough I don't have enough strength to go out for them but what can they do Church that God will see they can pray they can pray if you don't feel strong enough to go after somebody you pray for them so we see that Judas healed the sick cast out Devils but when the showdown came showdown he sold out for gold and political power now what was his showdown his showdown was look Wow Jesus is here he's here in Jerusalem these Jews offered me some money it's get out Jesus is not out the winners Jesus is here in the city I can make a few dollars and Jesus he'll do miracle and he'll pass right through the Judas coulda said that I'll see him pass right through the crowd just like he did the one time and they tried to stone him and look it's all it's all perfect I could make some money I can you know show I'll just deny the word for a little bit you know because we know he repented afterward right he just repented the wrong people see just that was the showdown ah I can make a little money here but I can also slip out from the church for a little bit make a little money I'll come back no you won't know you will mercy and judgment the showdown the showdown when the showdown came he sold out for gold and political power now being in politics won't send you to hell but it'll get you really close because remember a lot lot sat in the gate of Sodom lot became a mayor brother Brahim said but look even the mayor got saved but barely barely other man said every person I know that goes in politics gets corrupted but God can save on the political system he saved lot but see there's always that intermixing of money power money power and you just thought my okay I can make a few bucks here just gotta be little gotta you know give away some of the secrets oh my so he did not go for the Pentecost to receive the Spirit of God he was devoid of the Spirit he was sensual see he was more concerned about money rather than God's word you know being fulfilled following the Word of God now recall never remember the three showdowns number three shots preach on that last year or was it two years ago I can't remember not at times going so fast our showdown is against what the organizations and their denominations and their Creed's I feel like I'm in a little warm-up with all these emails you know these denominational matters they the one guy just called me up and I was at I didn't take it he left me two voicemails of three minutes long so six minutes of just rebuking my video on the Trinities ride and you're leading people to the pit did all these things like guys I'm leading them to the word brother I don't know if he's my brother but I said show me where I'm outside the word he could never do that because bro gram didn't bring us a denomination he brought us the word he brought us the word so there's three showdowns remember there's the mark Mount Carmel which was a physical Mountain Mount Transfiguration was physical mountain but Mount Zion is a spiritual mountain the first showdown I don't know I don't know if there was a forerunner you know I don't know but Elijah was the messenger and the showdown was with the Bale denomination's brother him said and pick up your pen and write the Mount Transfiguration was the next showdown where the man said the 4runner was John the Baptist he was the former rain Jesus was the messenger the latter rain for that age he rebuked organization and Jesus had a showdown with denominational spirit did Jesus one the word will always win amen we're always gonna win because we're walking the spirit not in the flesh now brother Brandon tells us when he says the Holy Spirit picked up your pen and write you told him that boy spirit said that seven church age messengers the forerunner brother Branham his former reign his teaching ministry Jesus will bring the latter rain which is rapturing faith brother Graham rebuked organization and brother Branham then the Holy Spirit said showdown our showdown is with denominations and Creed's because number remember revelation 13 what are they gonna do you're gonna get the mark in the hand or the mark in the forehead or the RAM said the forehead is to think their doctrine the hand was to do the will of the world system Academical system remember brother Ram the Holy Spirit said the bride is going to be forced to stop preaching so we know it's prophecy I think we talked about that it's prophecy if we're the true bride that world economical system is going to shut us down but listen Church they'll never shut down the Church of the Living God we'll just go somewhere else if if we live to see it I hope we do if not we'll praise the Lord and maybe our next generation but they're gonna they're gonna force the bride to stop preaching the Word of God they're gonna force her to stop but she really won't stop she's gonna keep preaching just in a different angle a different ministry and we know that's called the third Pole praise God brother Graham said the third Pole we'll sit quiet for a while until that persecution picks up till the squeeze comes on then he said what you've seen in a minor way will manifest in a greater way think about the minor healings like brother Cobb I was talking about he had a cane he couldn't walk upstairs when I can run upstairs we've seen the third pole operate in a small level right K I'm talking with the brother about you speak the dear gonna get tomorrow and he got an 8-point dear it was thus saith the Lord we prayed for a sister with the blood issue and God healed her right there on a spot you know you see it operate in small way I spoke twice to mountains of infertility and they moved twice in one year and both couples had children you know it's just speaking by the leadership of the Holy Spirit we've seen it in a minor way but brother BAM said it'll pick up in a great way once this squeeze comes on amen that's right so there's three showdowns so Judas fell in his showdown so see that denominational spirit he fell well Graham said make no mistake about a person that's truly how many one to be truly baptized I don't want to be like maybe baptized how would it be truly baptized well maybe he's got the Holy Ghost no I want to have all the Holy Ghost amen into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the Spirit will be in the word all the way a really Holy Ghost real person loves the word cuz Christ is the one hurting that the word was made flesh and one among us a man when he comes back he's got a name on his vesture it's the Word of God hallelujah the Bible said he'll have a name which no man will know but then the Bible said his name is the word of God hallelujah Christians love the word they can't get enough of the word amen because Christ is the word that's the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fell right there and when they failed to go on that word their names are taken off the book of life oh it's such a great thing to be called to the gospel but it's also a serious thing too because if you fail to go on that's where denominations fail if they fail to go on and make idols their names get blotted off the book of life that's right remember Jesus Jesus said this is that one soul he goes he said when the spirit of truth comes he'll guide you into speaking in tongues no sir he'll guide you into all truth the truth and then you'll live the truth you will manifest the truth and Jesus said thy Word is truth now let's not be discouraged you know Christ is slowly purging our lives how many can say amen to that the word is slowly purging you might battle with something for weeks or months or a year a couple years but God is eventually he's gonna purge that out of your life and you're gonna be free from that how do you know what I'm talking about maybe pressure maybe it's a pressure from this family or a pressure here at the job or or just maybe fears and all these things you all these problems or all these maybe bad habits or something but if you stay with God long enough the word will take effect and the word will move that mountain it has to amen because the word cannot be defeated hallelujah we just got to stay with him the word is truth that spirit that was in Judas now we're back to Philadelphia the spirit that was in Judas went right along through the Ministry of Jesus then they both came to the cross Jesus was hanged upon the cross gladly giving his life for sinners and commended his spirit to God his spirit went to God and then was poured out into the church at Pentecost but Judas hanged himself and his spirit went back to Satan but after Pentecost that same spirit that was in Judas came back to the false vine and that grows right along with the true vine that's right with us it's right among us but notice Judas spirit never got to Pentecost it went up to receive the Holy Spirit it could not do it I'm sorry never went up to receive the Holy Spirit see how it important is see when people just come up for the Holy Spirit sorry right time or if people just come up for the Holy Spirit you can already say I've done something Judas never did Judas never went up to receive the Holy Ghost oh my how that ought encourage us amen if you come up for the Holy Ghost if you've got on your knees for the Holy Ghost if you've cried out for the Holy Ghost you've already showed you're not a Judas because he never went up to receive it but you and I go up to receive it amen that's exactly right he never went up who seemed got to humble ourselves say I want the Holy Ghost I want to be filled with power under me fill with God's love I want to be in the very image of Jesus Christ Judas never did that Judas never was humble enough to say I want to go up to Pentecost money was his thing money it was all about money now one thing I want to say too I heard a preacher preach on it that spirit went right along through the ministry of Jesus I heard a brother say this and it was quite striking and Loras and Karen might know a lot about this but a lot of the people that were around brother Branham when he was on earth a lot of them not saying all of them not all of them many of them many of those people were the ones who started false doctrines later on down the road I mean I heard a preacher preaching and he named about seven false doctrines that came out of people that were right there with brother Branham members tape boys they went started to what was that a camp his tape boys started to camp out in Arizona gee I'm sorry Leo and Jean and they turned out to be homosexuals and yet they they help brother branham in the ministry for years and years some of these other brothers brought frost doctrines about Peru's or the Friends of God we don't need the Holy Ghost anymore the Holy Ghost is already here and it just killed the churches some of these churches that accept these doctor no more praying for the Holy Ghost no more fasten no more power of God and they denominator and die and start compromising cutting their hair wearing makeup cussing and bringing TVs in their home and living off the things of the world it's people that were right along with brother Branham but see give it some time and every seed will produce of its own kind amen glory that's why so thankful as time goes on we're seeing the fruits of all these people we can look at the fruits and see what is this producing what is this producing and church that's look at our life let's see what fruits were producing can we look back 10 years ago 5 years ago what fruits are we produced since then there's our life look more like the word or we getting off into things we shouldn't get into that's striking to me that's striking some of the brothers that brother branham ordained to preach got into some terrible false doctrines terrible awful false doctrines maybe I shouldn't say that but one of one of the brothers started a church there in New York and when he died they prophesied and this is what I told this what I was told by the brother Yvonne in New York his followers said he prophesied before he died he thus saith the Lord he would rise again in three days and so they waited in New York at his gravesite and he never rose again he never but this was the this was the spirit see wherever there's false doctrine there's going to be spirits around there because that's what it produces false doctrines produce a wrong spirit and so now they follow some somebody else in that organization or denomination and this was a guy who sat on her brother branham and brother BAM ordained and agreed preacher you it goes right along with it but by their fruits they'll be known no amen god help us to have the right fruits and I'm not calling names or I'm not trying to be critical you understand I'm just trying to show you the reality of this we've got to be very careful let me try to finish I'm losing time losing track of time because I'm just having a good time but what did that Judas spirit go for Church it always it went for the bag of gold how it loved money that's what I was saying earlier if people get more excited out here in a fellowship or I just got some more money or yeah I feel if they get more excited about money than worshiping Christ well you better watch that person this is what he loved he loved to hold the bag for the ministry the money nice to feel bad for John because he was the treasurer you know but now I'm the treasurer and the treasurer hold the money but I don't love it God knows that I don't love it I don't love to hold the money but Judas loved money he said his spirit still loves money today if it goes about doing in the name of Jesus doing things holding great meetings that still makes more of money and buildings and education everything with the material concept in mind so what do these people get most excited about big buildings education educational systems money big meetings can everybody understand that the Judas spirit doesn't get excited about a small little fellowship where they're clapping singing praising the Lord they want to see big they want to see money they were to see big lights they want big big big money money money that's why God reveals himself in little things simple humble things I found the core brother Graham said as soon as you build a new church he said that people fall away because they just get excited about the building something to consider now I don't you're wrong I'd like to have a bigger Church you're talking about that lunch I'd like to have a bigger Church you know our own church building then you got all the expenses you know new roof and new all that stuff like that but that ramp said that's the reality because we're just human and if we're not careful if we're not spiritually on our toes st. will start tricking us to think well we're better because we got a bigger building has nothing do with the building it has everything to do with obedience of the word we must love the holy spirit and not love money in other words what the Holy Spirit brings repentance because jesus said the Holy Spirit will convict you of all things when he comes healings salvation sanctification we don't like to say that all the time but that's right it's gonna sanctifies it's gonna cut us it's gonna purge us Judas didn't like that because he never got it purged out of his life he loved money and big things and big campaigns and bigger big buildings he loved the big money stuff more than he loved just the Word of God there's nothing wrong with big meetings every now and not their own with that but when people get more exciting that big things money things then the word of God something's wrong with their life see just watch that spirit watch it that's why I say if anyone ever seems like they got the wrong spirit just watch him for a while it's gonna manifest the seed inside of every person who's gonna manifest you just sit there and watching you make sure your fruits are the right kind of fruits don't be fooled he said don't be fooled Judas went about as one of the twelve and did miracles too but he did not have the Spirit of God he did have a ministry though he never got to Pentecost as he was not true seed he was not a true child of God no sir and is that way right now in the synagogue of satan' no be fooled you won't be fooled if you're the very like Jesus said you wouldn't be fooled yes these folks say they're Christians but they aren't look at you 111 woe unto them for they have gone the way of Cain so Jude lumps all these guys together Cain Balaam and Korah and they ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward now what does reward mean look at this church reward means wages higher and think of all the brothers or even sisters that sell out God just for more money just a bigger job make more money it's just the wages just wages it's just higher they sell a run greedily after more money rather than staying with the Word of God oh goodness perished in the gainsaying of korah remember core came in what accord you core came against the prophet in the priesthood and said we can all minister with with incense we can all go in there and God said no you can't only those who are called the Friends of God can go in the presence of God and that day you had to be born into it in this day you got to be born into it too but it's born by the Holy Ghost just and not anybody can go in there any old way you got to come God's provided way see lumps all these people together Kane what came to Kane went with beauty rather than blood Balaam went with money more than Holy Spirit Holy Ghost living you want to get people to fornicate when to make some money one to try to curse Israel now you couldn't do it so he tried to do it through there he knew God would curse them if they sinned in fornication he tried to teach them false doctrine to make a little money and then kora came against the prophet in the priesthood that's why I be careful if someone comes against the fivefold ministry or comes against brother Branham watch that spirit that's a core spirit his core came against both not just one came against both that's exactly right I'm almost done here I know I know it's getting late I want to preach my voice out I'll be praying God hear my voice again you know my voice again well why'd you preach so long all right thank you Lord I'm almost done yeah I only got three more slides is this helpful tonight I hope it's a good reminder remember the Bible said so simple the way to get stirred up is remember remember stir up your minds by way of remembrance remember what a Holy Ghost life is like it's not in love with money it's in love with righteousness it's in love with the Word of God and you go up to get the Holy Ghost you go up you make you cut everything off like we said this morning cut everything off in order to be clean and be used by God but he that lack of these things is blind this is the stache perfect man and cannot see afar off have forgotten he was purged from his old sins he forgot he was forgiven so it's dangerous when you don't feel forgiven it's dangerous it means you're not it means you're not letting the virtues of the Holy Spirit flow through you you've got a clog you've clogged up a flue there's some sin got in there and the life of God is not flowing out of you if we forget we're forgiven which goes along with this morning's message about being cut off wherefore the rather brethren give diligence now that means all you're after all your interests give all your interest to make your calling and election Shore which means stable and firm see this is what we wanted right a Christ fellowship we just want stable believers we want firm believers believers that love the word that's all we want because that's what a real Christian life produces people that want to live on everybody no unstable in Christ Jesus I am a firm I'm unmovable in the Word of God hey man let's Satan bring in floods and storms and all these things against me I'll stand there like a soldier I'll stand there like a statue amen my brother and I'll stand there like a weathervane amen I'll just stand there and I'll do every rain and and do every hardship and do every struggle because I'm making my election sure I'm letting the devil know that I'm elected amen and I'm gonna give all my interest to show them that I am elected hallelujah see we must do faith we must do virtuous things we must do knowledge we must accept patience we must accept temperance God is really kind of cherrywood we must do these things if we do these things will never fail we must do the word if I preach something try to live it that night try to live it that Monday don't forget about it and that same thing for me what I preach I must go home and live and then I'll never fall to Satan's devices gotta let that flow through me I've got to stay true to the word gotta stay humble I gotta love Jesus more than money we all have to do that alright last few here seemed like there was something I want to say to maybe how Jesus maybe there's something I thought I forgot I just feel like I was wanting to bring something else out Philadelphia Church H okay yeah this the last one there's two more this is the last thought so this is the part about worse coming to worship and remember a couple months ago I preached on this on all the events after after the rapture was after Armageddon yeah all the events yeah like the mayors suffer all the events after the marriage supper like being introduced by the Prophet then rewards given out memory preached on that coming back at Armageddon and then the white throne judgment we preach on all those different the order of events the possible order of events I'll make them so that's the Faust you come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee and the Bible said do you not know that the Saints should judge the world you know when I think about a church think about how many people I may have to judge how many people have come in and sat in this church and left in disobedience how many people I may have to judge I don't want to judge people I don't want to have to stand there like the Queen of the South and I you know in other words I don't want to see people lost of course I'll have to stand there and say yes I was able I was able to live a Christian life with six or 7 children I was able to put God first and I was able to serve the Lord and be a pastor and have a full-time job whatever testimony God wants to get out of me I'll be able to stand there and say I by God's grace he helped me do it but I don't want to see people don't want to see people lost but this is what the brother have said this is how God will do it God will show these false Jews these are the ones I loved because they live such a life on earth they're worthy to judge now and that's because they judged rightly while they were on earth and we must judge rightly right now not only will there be 12 apostles on twelve Thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel but the Saints also will judge the world that is when those who claim to belong to God and claim that God loves them will find it exactly who is the child of God and who is loved of the son don't you see it with your friends see on Facebook all the time God loves me God loves me God loves me and I say I don't know I don't know if God loves them it depends what they did the foss you think God loves them I don't know if that was between me between them and God did they really love God because member both groups say God loves me God loves me but God really only loves one of them yes that day is coming when it will be made manifest he said I'm gonna come show the false Jews the ones that I love that I really loved you those who are now ruling the world in a measure and who during the last age will build an image to the Beast whereby they will actually rule the world will one day be humbled when Jesus comes with his Saints to judge the world in righteousness that's exactly what we saw Matthew 25 and all the ones who missed the first resurrection will stand before the judge in his bride oh my okay let's say to our feet here I'm gonna look up this quote stay stay on here Malachi I told you I was a that's what I was going to I was look at that Judas quote from the Philadelphia Church age I think he said you falsely yeah there it is Lauren okay yeah there's paragraph 224 in the photo features a Judas when he was here on earth he met up with Jesus made a confession that he was a believer in Jesus and become the treasurer packing all the money is that right you all know that now if he believed on Jesus Christ he accepted falsely justification in the seat of discrepancy brother Bram said Judas never had faith to begin with he had a pretend faith is that right Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith that's right he said all right falsely because the member of the Bible said this I said earlier he thus justified he's already glorified I mean grd have a glorified body yeah whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen that's why I leaned to that side Judas never really was justified to begin with he never really was sanctified brother Bram said you can walk through the stature of a man and just have a human faith a human virtue a human knowledge of human temperance our human patience which the Buddhists do they are very temper they're very patient people we've met some of them one time see they can mimic those things but if God justifies you there's a glorified body waiting for you hey man there's an eternal body waiting for you in the heavens hallelujah do you just love money he never really loved Christ he loved the money that followed Christ instead of loving Christ oh how we should love Christ Church how we should love this word no matter what happens to us financially if God blesses our businesses or model our lives and we get more finances praise God but if not would you still serve Him of course of course oh he slay me yet I'll trust him praise God hope this was a blessing now if you look in your church age book here I got the eulogy in the promise that's one two three pages the promise to his own is one two three four and the final admonition is half a page you got four more pages to get through this glorious chapter so I am really excited I'm really excited to preach the church ages because I know I knew what a tremendous revelation it was from God I was just waiting for the right time and I believe God has given many of these things that I said to us at the right time I really believe that and I'm thankful for that so let's just sing a few songs here does anyone desire prayer is all hearts and minds clear tonight by God's grace anyone else nobody any prayer requests tonight amen who's thankful to know more about Christ
