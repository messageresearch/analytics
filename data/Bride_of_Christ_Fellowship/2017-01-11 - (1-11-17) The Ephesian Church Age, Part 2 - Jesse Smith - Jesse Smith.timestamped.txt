[47:39] Revelation Chapter 2 uh verse
[47:42] one want to look at Ephesians Church Age
[47:45] part two tonight these are just such
[47:48] special words I really believe this is
[47:50] a a crucial book to understanding the
[47:53] end time
[47:54] message you know the prophet of God said
[47:56] you can't even understand the seals
[47:58] until you first understand the church
[47:59] ages he said and after you get to the
[48:01] church ages then the seals he said then
[48:03] the trumpets then the woes then the
[48:05] vials work your way through how many
[48:08] enjoying this church ages amen I'm
[48:10] surely enjoying I've waited years and
[48:12] years I just wonder why I haven't had
[48:13] this inspiration to do it but now I got
[48:14] the inspiration to do it so I'm GNA stay
[48:16] right with it by God's grace Revelation
[48:18] chapter 2 verse
[48:21] one like I said whole you know whole
[48:24] entire churches and Ministries have been
[48:25] built upon the teachings of the prophet
[48:28] of God from this series and God has
[48:30] blessed those Ministries tremendously so
[48:32] we know there's many many great truths
[48:35] in this teaching here Revelation 2 verse
[48:38] one Lord willing we'll just read verses
[48:40] one and two I I don't really think I'll
[48:41] get much further than that tonight by
[48:43] God's grace uh as I read through this
[48:45] book and study the church age book I
[48:47] just can't leave some of these things
[48:48] out they're just so dear and precious to
[48:51] my heart and uh important for us to
[48:54] understand it so if you're live
[48:56] streaming here or if you're here and you
[48:58] haven't read the church age book I think
[48:59] it's good for us to go slow slow through
[49:01] it and a lot of these truths you know
[49:04] you'll see they're completely scriptural
[49:05] you know of course but uh uh if if you
[49:08] haven't uh studied that and learned it
[49:11] and uh gained that knowledge of Christ
[49:13] in your life then you need it you really
[49:15] need it and it's always good for us to
[49:16] remember it if we have read it and be
[49:19] refreshed by it praise the Lord so
[49:21] Revelation 2 verse
[49:23] one I'll read verse one and then we I'll
[49:25] read verse two unto the angel of the
[49:27] Church of Ephesus write these things
[49:29] saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in
[49:31] his right hand who walketh in the midst
[49:34] of the seven golden candlesticks now
[49:36] let's read verse two 1 2 3 I Know Thy
[49:39] works and thy labor and thy patience and
[49:43] how thou c not bear them which are evil

[49:52] them Liars amen let's bow our heads in

[50:44] tonight Lord we love you in Jesus
[50:46] Christ's name and the church said amen
[50:49] God bless you being seated praise
[50:51] God so want to uh look at part two here
[50:55] so Malachi when you're ready we'll
[50:56] switch over here and I'm going to try
[50:58] this uh high-tech remote brother van
[51:00] gave me here so I'm going to try it by
[51:02] God's grace and we'll see if it'll
[51:04] work uh by the grace of the Lord for our
[51:07] live streamer so Malai just watch that
[51:08] screen in a moment once we get connected
[51:11] here and uh brother lur said it worked
[51:13] great on Sunday so I want to thank
[51:14] brother bang for
[51:16] that it worked really good on
[51:19] Sunday so brother Vang told me to do
[51:23] this how'd that okay Glory
[51:26] see even I can even you can teach an old
[51:28] dog an old Eagle New Tricks I'm not a
[51:30] dog you can teach an old Eagle New
[51:33] Tricks Eagles renew their strength
[51:36] amen praise the Lord I like technology
[51:38] anyway so I'm not too far out of the mix
[51:41] you I can't I can't build much online
[51:43] but I sure like computers you know amen
[51:46] so let's look at this Ephesian Church
[51:47] Age part two I think you'll really be
[51:49] blessed uh tonight by God's grace so
[51:52] let's look at this here now our full
[51:54] text for the of course the the church
[51:56] age is 1 to
[51:58] 7 and uh we want to look at how and
[52:02] we'll notice this as we go through this
[52:03] in the next few months Lord willing if
[52:05] God carries and if I keep feeling led to
[52:07] do this on this topic uh but brother
[52:09] ramam said Jesus starts every Church age
[52:12] out by introducing
[52:14] himself to the church
[52:17] age uh so we we want to look at tonight
[52:19] how he introduces himself by the grace
[52:22] of the Lord so uh let's look at our
[52:24] scripture uh unto the angel of the
[52:26] Church of Ephesus right now we did that
[52:29] on Sunday so we I I got through about
[52:31] onethird of the verse on Sunday because
[52:33] there's so much in there to learn from
[52:36] from the prophet of God uh God's servant
[52:39] the prophet brother Brandon so the angel
[52:41] of course was the messenger we know was
[52:43] St Paul because every man even Peter had
[52:46] to submit to St Paul because St Paul had
[52:49] the greatest Revelation for that age he
[52:52] was the man uh that God would use as an
[52:55] example all preachers aspire to be like
[52:59] St Paul amen I'm aspiring to be like St
[53:01] Paul like this one time I'm like this uh
[53:05] remember the Bible said Paul saw a man
[53:07] who was uh he was crippled and the Bible
[53:10] said Paul saw faith in him to be healed
[53:12] he just saw it so he said with a loud
[53:14] voice stand up upon your feet and be
[53:16] made well I like to do that by God's
[53:18] grace uh that's the kind of Faith we're
[53:20] looking for amen uh Rapture in faith by
[53:23] God's grace but that's a we want a model
[53:26] want to see the Christ in Paul you want
[53:29] to see it in our lives amen so he's the
[53:32] angel or the
[53:34] messenger uh to the the church and
[53:36] Ephesus we saw was a very rich city a
[53:38] very important city uh economically but
[53:42] Also spiritually it's called the third
[53:43] Christian Church as we went over um and
[53:48] the word means aimed at and relaxed as
[53:50] we saw uh aimed at now what you could
[53:53] use aimed at in both ways they were
[53:54] aimed at by the devil but they were they
[53:56] at the beginning they were also aiming
[53:57] brother B said at the High Calling of
[53:59] God in Christ Jesus they were striving
[54:01] to be uh just in the very depths of God
[54:04] the heights of God they could go and the
[54:06] powers of God they were aiming at it but
[54:08] then they got relaxed as time went on
[54:11] and that's what we must not do we must
[54:14] uh we must be in this for the Long Haul
[54:16] praise God uh you know some people get
[54:18] discouraged if the Rapture don't come
[54:19] each year I don't get discouraged I just
[54:22] know I'm one year closer to it by God's
[54:24] grace uh if it don't come this year
[54:26] praise God hopefully it'll come next
[54:27] year if it don't come in my lifetime
[54:30] praise the Lord I hope it comes in the
[54:31] next lifetime but I'm going to be
[54:32] serving one thing I'm going to be ready
[54:34] whenever it comes amen whether I got to
[54:36] get a resurrected body and come that way
[54:39] by the grave and get a glorified body to
[54:41] catch my theophany with or if my body
[54:44] gets swallowed up in life amen While I'm
[54:47] Alive if that happens hallelujah amen
[54:50] but there's one thing for sure I'm going
[54:52] to be a part of it by God's grace I'm
[54:53] believing that with all my heart amen
[54:56] uh and Ephesus started out on fire but
[54:59] they many of them fell away not
[55:00] everybody because remember when when
[55:02] brother bam says this when Jesus is is
[55:05] WR is uh speaking this to the church age
[55:07] he's talking to two churches he's
[55:09] talking to the true church and the
[55:10] church that falls away praise God so the
[55:14] message goes to both the true church
[55:16] will receive the correction and stay
[55:17] with the word and then the false church
[55:19] WIll backside and fall away right so he
[55:22] said the message goes to both because
[55:24] remember they're both intertwined we
[55:25] went over that a few Wednesdays ago both
[55:27] churches the true church and the false
[55:28] Church they're intertwined
[55:30] amen now I got this thought here from I
[55:33] was listening to the sermon in 19160
[55:35] brother B said I want you to notice
[55:37] every time that he introduces himself to
[55:38] a church age he puts forth something of
[55:41] his deity so he starts revealing more of
[55:44] himself now remember in chapter one he
[55:46] already did the Sevenfold Glory of his
[55:48] his person as a judge but during the
[55:50] church ages here he's showing more of
[55:52] his glory to the church ages okay he
[55:56] said that's the first thing he tries to
[55:58] make known to the church that's his
[56:00] deity he's God Amen Jesus Christ is God
[56:04] Amen so I'm been doing of course a lot
[56:06] of reading here as I just feel led of
[56:08] the Holy Spirit I'll stop and make a few
[56:10] comments uh and maybe read some
[56:12] scriptures I got a few on my heart I
[56:14] just want to make sure I I flip there
[56:16] before I forget so uh the next portion
[56:20] here we'll see this in just a moment
[56:22] read that in just a moment
[56:26] so
[56:28] uh let me find a notes in Genesis just a
[56:31] moment here you can start reading on
[56:33] that if you'd like
[56:37] there
[56:43] okay all right well I miss I have to
[56:45] look for that I have to look it up on my
[56:46] phone I was looking for the scripture
[56:48] about Esau we'll get to that in just a
[56:50] moment now he says after he gets to the
[56:53] Angel and the the the messenger here and
[56:55] the empis now he gets into the rest of
[56:57] the scripture this is the last
[56:59] two-thirds of it these things saith he
[57:01] that holdeth the Seven Stars in his
[57:03] right hand who walketh in the midst of
[57:05] the seven golden
[57:07] candlesticks so this deals with
[57:09] something about the deity of Christ so
[57:12] through this we can see that Christ is
[57:14] God as we know Christ holds seven stars
[57:17] Christ holds those Messengers he was
[57:19] holding brother brandom in his hand how
[57:21] many you to believe that and then he
[57:23] walketh that means he's currently he
[57:25] walketh walks in the midst of the seven
[57:28] golden candlesticks he's right amongst
[57:30] the church today how many see him in
[57:32] your life today you see him you see him
[57:33] walking in your life amen we ought to
[57:36] because he's walking in the church amen
[57:38] he's walking in the midst of the golden
[57:39] candlesticks he he should be walking in
[57:41] our
[57:42] lives this is he of whom it said this
[57:45] this same Jesus is both Lord and Christ
[57:47] he's the ruler and he's also the
[57:50] Messiah there he is the one and only
[57:52] Lord God Almighty beside him there's no
[57:54] other there he is the savior
[57:56] salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9
[57:59] walking in the midst of the seven of the
[58:01] churches throughout the Seven Ages now
[58:04] I'm skipping down to the white what he
[58:06] was in the first age he is in all ages
[58:10] to every believer he is Jesus Christ the
[58:12] same yesterday and today and forever
[58:14] what he did once he's still doing and
[58:17] will keep doing
[58:19] amen now you'll notice that Jesus is
[58:21] walking alone now now brother Ram's
[58:23] goingon to break this thought of how
[58:25] he's walking there but he's walking all
[58:28] alone in the midst of his churches
[58:30] there's no one else with him now why
[58:33] isn't there anybody with him here he
[58:34] tells us why neither indeed can there be
[58:37] there can be no one with Jesus as he
[58:39] walks in the church for he alone wrought
[58:42] her salvation or or worked for it and
[58:45] having purchased her with his own blood
[58:48] he owns her how many know your property
[58:50] of Christ
[58:51] tonight he if any if anybody would take
[58:54] good care of their property who who
[58:55] would it be
[58:56] Jesus Jesus would take care of his
[58:59] property he said he is her Lord and
[59:02] Master she gives him all the glory and
[59:06] that Glory he will not share with
[59:08] another amen I want to make sure he's
[59:11] all alone because he alone bought her
[59:14] okay now look he says there's no Pope
[59:17] with him how you know that there's no
[59:19] Archbishop with him Mary the mother of
[59:21] his Earthly body is not with him glory I
[59:25] I love this this is so such a blessing
[59:26] to my heart I almost shouted he does not
[59:28] speak and turn to a father for he is the
[59:32] father he is the image of the invisible
[59:35] God
[59:36] Amen he does not turn to give orders to
[59:39] the holy spirit for he is God eternal
[59:43] spirit amen that Eternal spirit's giving
[59:45] him life it's inside uh the fullness of
[59:48] the godhead bodily dwell in him bodily
[59:50] right so the spirit's inside of him he
[59:52] is the image of the invisible
[59:54] father I love it and it is his life
[59:57] that's flowing and pulsating in the
[1:00:00] church you feel life in your in yourself
[1:00:02] tonight Church you feel life in yourself
[1:00:04] amen pulsating in the church giving her
[1:00:06] life and without him there would be no
[1:00:09] life salvation is of the Lord I hope you
[1:00:11] can feel the pulse of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:13] tonight amen giving you
[1:00:15] life if we if we hooked you up to a
[1:00:18] natural uh EKG machine right or whatever
[1:00:21] machine they have we could get your
[1:00:22] pulse right You' hear you feel the
[1:00:24] pulsation what if we hook you up to a
[1:00:26] spiritual machine could we feel the
[1:00:28] pulse of the holy spirit in your life
[1:00:30] amen we wouldn't want to be a dead
[1:00:31] church we want to be a living church
[1:00:33] amen that we're living and breathing and
[1:00:36] pulsating we've got life here amen
[1:00:39] hallelujah we were dead before if you
[1:00:41] checked me brother amen if you check me
[1:00:43] when I was in high school I was dead no
[1:00:46] life no Pauls oh but when the love of
[1:00:49] Christ Came Upon me hook it up now and
[1:00:51] see you'll see there's life in the body
[1:00:53] amen there's a Paul there's something
[1:00:55] there's a life PA F ating to serve
[1:00:57] Christ and love Jesus
[1:00:59] amen and look he still goes on with how
[1:01:01] he's all
[1:01:03] known there was no one with him when he
[1:01:06] trod the fierceness of the Wrath of the
[1:01:09] fiery furnace nobody nobody walked with
[1:01:12] him when he went to
[1:01:13] Calvary was not another but him who hung
[1:01:17] on the cross and gave his blood he's the
[1:01:19] author and finisher of our faith he's
[1:01:21] the Alpha and Omega of our Salvation
[1:01:23] we're spoused to him and not another we
[1:01:27] don't belong to the church did you
[1:01:29] notice that you don't belong to this
[1:01:32] church praise the Lord you don't belong
[1:01:34] to any church you belong to Christ amen
[1:01:37] we belong to him his word is our law
[1:01:41] Creeds dogmas bylaws and constitutions
[1:01:43] have no effect upon
[1:01:45] us yes it is Jesus alone who walks in
[1:01:48] the midst of the churches it is God in
[1:01:51] her I like this willing and doing of his
[1:01:55] good pleasure never forget that so when
[1:01:58] you see somebody walking in the spirit
[1:02:00] and they're turning down pleasures of
[1:02:02] life and lust of the flesh uh that is
[1:02:06] God doing his will in our lives amen
[1:02:10] it's God's pleasure you think oh this
[1:02:12] person uh like for example like we
[1:02:14] talked about with marriage oh this
[1:02:15] person's divorced and they got oh
[1:02:17] they're not allowed to marry again
[1:02:19] because they got a living spouse how sad
[1:02:22] no don't be sad for them if they're
[1:02:24] walking in truth be happy that they're
[1:02:26] keeping the word amen that's God's will
[1:02:29] uh you'll have more pleasure and more
[1:02:31] love and more life In You by keeping
[1:02:34] God's word rather than transgressing
[1:02:36] God's word amen God is giving us his
[1:02:41] good pleasure his pleasure is his word
[1:02:44] and we live we live for that he said
[1:02:46] never forget
[1:02:48] that you have only one relationship to
[1:02:51] God and God has only one relationship to
[1:02:53] you that is Jesus and Jesus alone amen
[1:02:57] all right there he stands now he goes to
[1:02:59] the Stars okay so there he's talking
[1:03:01] about walking the midst now he moves to
[1:03:02] the next part of his deity is the the
[1:03:05] the stars there he is with seven stars
[1:03:07] in his right hand the right hand or arm
[1:03:10] signifies the power and authority of God
[1:03:14] Psalms 44:3 for they got not the land in
[1:03:17] possession by their own sword neither
[1:03:19] did their own arms save them but thy
[1:03:21] right hand and thy thine arm and the
[1:03:24] light of thy countenance because thou
[1:03:26] Hast a favor unto them in that right
[1:03:30] hand a power of seven stars who
[1:03:32] according to Revelation 1 120 are the
[1:03:35] seven Church age
[1:03:36] Messengers amen how many know the right
[1:03:38] hand represents power and authority most
[1:03:40] people as we know this most people
[1:03:42] picture God in heaven and he's got a
[1:03:44] physical right hand and then Jesus is
[1:03:46] right there on his right hand that's not
[1:03:48] what it means it means the right hand of
[1:03:50] authority praise God uh so in other
[1:03:53] words in other words the invisible ible
[1:03:56] Spirit the visible Spirit doesn't have a
[1:03:58] physical right hand because it's
[1:03:59] invisible right but the next in line of
[1:04:03] power is that body of Jesus that's what
[1:04:06] that means amen all the authority of
[1:04:08] that invisible is in that body of Christ
[1:04:11] how many you understand that by God's
[1:04:12] grace so it's as if that Christ is at
[1:04:15] the right hand of the power all power
[1:04:17] and authority Jesus said is given unto
[1:04:19] me not a physical right hand now Jesus
[1:04:22] has a right hand his own body but that
[1:04:25] eternal spirit doesn't have a a physical
[1:04:27] hand uh but it shows that Christ is
[1:04:31] operating Under full of power and
[1:04:32] authority of the eternal spirit
[1:04:34] amen glory hope that's
[1:04:39] understandable so this right hand
[1:04:41] signifies the very power and authority
[1:04:42] of God are behind his Messengers to
[1:04:44] every age they go forth in the fire and
[1:04:47] power of the Holy Ghost with the word
[1:04:50] they are stars because they reflect
[1:04:52] light the light they reflect is his
[1:04:54] light they have no no light of their own
[1:04:57] they Kindle not their own fires that men
[1:04:59] may walk in the light of their Sparks
[1:05:02] let's read that I let's go to Isaiah 50
[1:05:04] I didn't read that one 50 vers 11 I like
[1:05:07] to read
[1:05:09] that they don't kle their own Sparks
[1:05:12] okay Isaiah
[1:05:17] 50:1 behold all ye that Kindle of fire
[1:05:20] that Compass yourselves about with
[1:05:23] Sparks okay so see how they're building
[1:05:25] their own fire
[1:05:26] walk in the light of your fire and in
[1:05:28] the
[1:05:28] Sparks that ye have kindled this shall
[1:05:32] ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down
[1:05:35] in sorrow okay so see they have no light
[1:05:39] of their own so God is telling them to
[1:05:40] walk in the Sparks of your fire that
[1:05:43] you've
[1:05:44] kindled all right and that's just like a
[1:05:46] fiery messenger praise God God gives a
[1:05:48] Believer a fire in their life walk by
[1:05:51] that fire in other words walk by your
[1:05:52] testimony praise God never forget what
[1:05:55] God's done for you never forget what
[1:05:56] God's done for this church you must you
[1:05:59] overcome Satan what by the blood of the
[1:06:01] lamb and the word of your
[1:06:03] testimony always remember the testimony
[1:06:05] that's why every time I meet somebody
[1:06:06] like I saw Lucy remember on Sunday what
[1:06:08] do I do I tell her testimonies about the
[1:06:09] church testimonies about what God's
[1:06:11] doing in the church to keep them
[1:06:13] inspired because that's what we overcome
[1:06:15] by is our testimonies if we don't repeat
[1:06:18] those what happened the same thing will
[1:06:19] happen like happened to Israel remember
[1:06:21] after Joshua died and a few Generations
[1:06:23] later they stopped telling about what
[1:06:25] Joshua did did they stopped telling
[1:06:26] their children about the power of God
[1:06:28] that's why want tell Lydia and Malachi
[1:06:30] and AAA and all my children and if God
[1:06:32] gives you children God gives everybody
[1:06:33] children whatever more you want to tell
[1:06:36] them about what God has done never
[1:06:37] forget because he's the same yesterday
[1:06:39] today and forever it's our job to train
[1:06:43] the Next Generation in the fear of God
[1:06:45] Amen that's what I love telling
[1:06:46] everybody about my mom being heal of
[1:06:47] cancer I didn't see it happen but I saw
[1:06:49] her go from lying in a hospital with my
[1:06:51] very eyes to just a few weeks later out
[1:06:54] of there and cooking me breakfast listen
[1:06:55] now I'm still alive today nobody can
[1:06:58] tell me that didn't happen amen I saw it
[1:07:00] I was there and I um those Sparks that
[1:07:03] God has given me in in my life like the
[1:07:05] Bible said here walk in the light of
[1:07:08] your
[1:07:09] fire amen walk in the light of your
[1:07:12] testimony
[1:07:13] Hallelujah and thank God for the fire
[1:07:15] that he started in your life amen never
[1:07:18] forget keep that fire burning praise
[1:07:22] God now look it is night because for
[1:07:25] that is when the stars come out so Jesus
[1:07:27] has those Seven Stars it's night time we
[1:07:29] went over this a little bit but he
[1:07:30] repeats it it is the night of the
[1:07:33] Blackness of sin for all even the whole
[1:07:35] world have sinned and are constantly
[1:07:37] falling short of the glory of God now
[1:07:40] that's of course you know Romans 3:23 we
[1:07:42] know that all sinned and fallen short of
[1:07:44] the glory of
[1:07:46] God now these seven Messengers are
[1:07:48] making God known to the people has
[1:07:50] brother Ram done that to you when you
[1:07:51] listen to his sermons does he make God
[1:07:52] known to you he ought to if you're a
[1:07:55] Believer he will make it known to you
[1:07:57] praise God I remember the first time
[1:07:59] when I went to
[1:08:00] Guyana uh because of what brother Ram
[1:08:02] taught through the scriptures and things
[1:08:04] God became known to me when I was
[1:08:05] casting out demons there I I never done
[1:08:08] it before but God became known to me
[1:08:10] through what brother brandom taught me
[1:08:13] because I just follow what brother Bram
[1:08:14] said which just was already in the Bible
[1:08:15] it was already there no glory to brother
[1:08:17] brandom he just repeated what the Bible
[1:08:18] said but that's God's vessel I repeated
[1:08:21] that and I did exactly what the Bible
[1:08:23] said and I got the same results amen
[1:08:26] it became and that's what I told people
[1:08:28] the power of God became real to me after
[1:08:30] taking those trips before the word was
[1:08:32] real the Revelation was real but the
[1:08:35] power became real after that amen
[1:08:38] because I heard brother Ram say it and
[1:08:39] then I repeated the word and it happened
[1:08:41] for me the same way amen so I'm very
[1:08:44] thankful for that now I like this let's
[1:08:46] go to John 13:20 this is such a powerful
[1:08:50] thing and this means so much to me
[1:08:56] John
[1:08:58] 13:20 beautiful red letter words
[1:09:01] amen uh Austin's mom asked me this week
[1:09:03] in the car she said why is there
[1:09:05] red-letter words in the Bible aren don't
[1:09:08] you love those little questions like
[1:09:09] that she said she's gonna clo she might
[1:09:11] want to serve the Lord someday which is
[1:09:13] good we're witness we're praying for her
[1:09:14] at home and everything and I said well
[1:09:16] sister those are the words of Our Lord
[1:09:19] the literal words quoted of the Lord
[1:09:21] Jesus Christ and she said oh I never
[1:09:22] knew that said my Bible doesn't have
[1:09:25] your Bible has r letter words mine
[1:09:27] doesn't and I said those are precious
[1:09:29] words amen verily verily I say unto you
[1:09:32] he that receiveth whomsoever I send
[1:09:36] receiveth me and he that receiveth me
[1:09:40] receiveth him that sent me who sent
[1:09:43] Christ the Father the eternal spirit
[1:09:46] praise God so it's a great chain right
[1:09:48] it's like a domino effect if you receive
[1:09:50] the one in front of you preaching to you
[1:09:52] then you receive Christ because Christ
[1:09:54] sent them and then if you receive Christ
[1:09:55] they receive the eternal spirit praise
[1:09:57] God so when I receive brother Isaiah
[1:10:00] Brooks I receive
[1:10:01] Christ when I receive Craig Boer I
[1:10:04] receive Jesus Christ amen well you could
[1:10:07] take it back to brother brandom you know
[1:10:08] you take it back all the way all the way
[1:10:10] to Christ and then because I receive
[1:10:12] them I receive God and God will receive
[1:10:15] me praise God and if you if you receive
[1:10:17] me as God's messenger then you receive
[1:10:20] Christ hallelujah it's exactly right
[1:10:22] every preacher is like that for each age
[1:10:24] if you receive Martin Lu Luther then
[1:10:26] then you receive Christ amen
[1:10:29] hallelujah he said they speak and act
[1:10:31] upon his authority he stands behind them
[1:10:34] with all the power of the
[1:10:37] godhead Glory let's read that Matthew
[1:10:39] 28 these are just things we cannot
[1:10:42] forget we must remember
[1:10:52] these Matthew 28:18
[1:10:55] now we know verse 19 is the most
[1:10:57] misunderstood scripture in all of
[1:11:00] christiandom they call
[1:11:01] it but what the people ask me they say
[1:11:04] was that what was that Jesse why why
[1:11:05] does it say like that Jesus is speaking
[1:11:07] in a
[1:11:08] mystery remember the Bible said he would
[1:11:10] speak in Mysteries the Bible said he
[1:11:12] would speak Mysteries that were kept
[1:11:13] secret from the foundation of the world
[1:11:16] and this was one of those Mysteries how
[1:11:18] could God be both or all three of Father
[1:11:20] Son and Holy Ghost how could he he could
[1:11:22] do it by becoming in his son amen could
[1:11:25] be the father Son and the Holy Ghost all
[1:11:27] in one person amen not three persons one
[1:11:31] person that's a mystery he was he would
[1:11:34] speak that would be kept from the
[1:11:35] foundation of the
[1:11:36] world all right
[1:11:39] um and just a real quick testimony
[1:11:41] before we read this a person saw my
[1:11:44] YouTube video today on water baptism and
[1:11:46] he lives in North Carolina he lives in
[1:11:48] Kings Mountain I preached there before
[1:11:50] and he said can I be baptized in the
[1:11:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said yes
[1:11:53] sir and he just emailed me and said give
[1:11:55] him my phone number he said
[1:11:59] uh he said I'm looking forward to
[1:12:01] hearing from you or your friend thank
[1:12:02] you in his name praise God so looking
[1:12:05] for another good testimony those videos
[1:12:07] being online we've seen people just this
[1:12:09] month a woman said she'll stop cutting
[1:12:10] her hair stop wearing makeup now this
[1:12:12] gentleman wants to be baptized and I
[1:12:14] just got in touch with Tim Myers tonight
[1:12:17] uh sister AO remembers Tim I don't know
[1:12:19] if you guys met Tim or not but he saide
[1:12:21] we'll be happy to baptize him because
[1:12:22] that's where their church is in Kings
[1:12:24] Mountain so God knows amen just thankful
[1:12:27] we're trying to spread the word if I
[1:12:29] can't go overseas or whatever I can at
[1:12:31] least put a video on the internet amen
[1:12:32] and preach so one little soul Who's
[1:12:34] hungered On YouTube can find the word of
[1:12:37] God
[1:12:39] Amen okay so Verse 18 and Jesus came and
[1:12:43] spake on them saying all power is given
[1:12:44] un me in heaven and earth see he's deity
[1:12:47] all everything we have a portion of the
[1:12:49] power but he's got all
[1:12:51] power go ye therefore and teach All
[1:12:53] Nations baptizing them in the name name
[1:12:55] not names the name the one name of the
[1:12:58] father and of the son and of the Holy
[1:13:01] Ghost brother BR brother B emphasized
[1:13:04] the of the of the father of the son and
[1:13:09] of the holy ghost He said if it didn't
[1:13:10] say of the he said then it would be the
[1:13:12] titles he say in the name of the father
[1:13:14] son Holy Ghost he said but it's Jesus
[1:13:16] makes sure that all three have ofthe
[1:13:19] because all three point to one name of
[1:13:22] the father of the son and of the Holy
[1:13:26] Ghost there's a name in other words
[1:13:27] there's a name of the father a name of
[1:13:29] the son and the name of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:30] and they're all Jesus Christ see brother
[1:13:33] man said every word's critical in the
[1:13:35] Bible that's exactly
[1:13:36] right teaching now verse 20 this is what
[1:13:38] we're doing right now in Aran Ohio in
[1:13:40] 2016 we're teaching all of us to observe
[1:13:43] all things whatsoever I've commanded you
[1:13:46] and lo I Am With You
[1:13:48] Always even unto the end of the world so
[1:13:51] will he be with us Church
[1:13:53] yes and as we will'll receive as much of
[1:13:56] Christ in our lives as we'll give
[1:13:59] him he will manifest other words he'll
[1:14:01] do as much in our lives as will
[1:14:04] believe hallelujah amen that's right
[1:14:08] because Jesus told him he said be it
[1:14:09] unto you according to your faith praise
[1:14:14] God be it unto you be it unto us
[1:14:17] according to our faith so I say let's
[1:14:18] raise our faith amen let's believe let's
[1:14:21] pray Lord increase my faith
[1:14:23] Hallelujah Glory let me believe believe
[1:14:25] and have assurance and Revelation that
[1:14:27] all things are possible Glory now go to
[1:14:31] Matthew 13 because I believe this is
[1:14:32] where the scriptures at where it says he
[1:14:34] would utter things uh from the
[1:14:36] foundation of the
[1:14:40] world and give me just a
[1:14:42] moment because I'm going look it up in
[1:14:44] my
[1:14:45] concordance if anybody finds it let me
[1:14:47] know but I know the scripture said he
[1:14:49] would uh secret what was it 35 bless
[1:14:52] your heart
[1:14:55] hallelujah thank you darling all right
[1:14:58] yes and lyd's almost through reading her
[1:15:00] Bible one time through God bless her
[1:15:04] amen Matthew 13:35 that it might be
[1:15:07] spoken look so Jesus preaches these
[1:15:09] seven Parables then he goes to verse 35
[1:15:11] that it might be Pro fulfilled which was
[1:15:13] spoken by the prophet saying I will open
[1:15:15] my mouth in Parables he said I will
[1:15:18] utter things which have been kept secret
[1:15:20] from the foundation of the world Amen
[1:15:23] look at that see he would that's when he
[1:15:24] said Holy Ghost that's what he was doing
[1:15:26] he was uttering a secret that there'll
[1:15:28] be one name to the father son Holy Ghost
[1:15:32] right that was a secret and if you
[1:15:34] search all the Bible you'll find that
[1:15:36] there's one name and that's the Lord
[1:15:37] Jesus Christ now let's prove it again
[1:15:40] just bear with me just a little bit um
[1:15:42] John 5:43 I think I'm just going by the
[1:15:45] unction of the Holy Spirit my memory
[1:15:47] John 543 if I'm wrong I have to look it
[1:15:50] up
[1:15:57] yeah that's right yep yep there it is
[1:15:59] brother amen can you read that when you
[1:16:00] get that John 5:43
[1:16:04] sir I am
[1:16:06] father
[1:16:11] re amen so Jesus said I didn't come in
[1:16:14] my own name I came in my father's name
[1:16:17] what was your name Jesus well the angel
[1:16:19] said call him Jesus amen the son's name
[1:16:22] you'll have a son who'll be born of a
[1:16:24] virgin
[1:16:25] uh Mary you're be a virgin he said call
[1:16:28] him Jesus amen Jehovah is our
[1:16:31] Salvation so there's a scripture that
[1:16:33] proves the name of the father is Jesus
[1:16:35] is that right okay you don't have to
[1:16:37] turn there but Matthew 1:21 that
[1:16:39] scripture proves uh Gabriel told Mary
[1:16:42] call call the son
[1:16:44] Jesus now here's the name of the Holy
[1:16:46] Ghost is Jesus John 14:26 if I never
[1:16:49] taught you this now you got it tonight
[1:16:51] 142 this is just a bonus tonight by
[1:16:53] God's grace extra blessing John 14:26
[1:16:58] this proves Matthew
[1:17:00] 28:19 that the father son Holy Ghost all
[1:17:03] point to one name father's not a name
[1:17:05] son's not a name Holy Ghost is not a
[1:17:07] name if you never understood this now
[1:17:09] you can catch it here okay John 1426
[1:17:11] does anybody want to read that oh
[1:17:13] Malachi okay go ahead sir
[1:17:26] now this is a great scripture for the
[1:17:27] baptism Holy Ghost but it's also a great
[1:17:30] scripture for the name of God what name
[1:17:32] does the Holy Ghost come in not his not
[1:17:34] not the title Holy Ghost he comes in my
[1:17:36] name who's who's talking there Jesus so
[1:17:39] if you want the Holy Ghost you got to
[1:17:40] cry Jesus Jesus come Lord Jesus fill me
[1:17:44] Jesus because the Holy Ghost comes in my
[1:17:46] name
[1:17:47] amen cripples were healed in in my name
[1:17:50] the name of Jesus Christ right uh uh
[1:17:53] dead were raised in the name of of Jesus
[1:17:55] Christ everybody was baptized in the
[1:17:57] name of Jesus Christ so that proves
[1:17:59] right there and this was such a great
[1:18:00] Revelation for me John 543 John
[1:18:04] 14:26 they all say that the name of the
[1:18:07] father Son and Holy Ghost is Jesus
[1:18:08] Christ all right now that's just a
[1:18:11] little bonus there for you let's let's
[1:18:12] continue going on by God's grace and I
[1:18:14] promis myself I'll be done in about uh
[1:18:17] okay I got 30 minutes all right I don't
[1:18:20] want to preach too long because my voice
[1:18:21] I'm just finally starting to get my
[1:18:22] voice back
[1:18:25] so there they are full of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:27] and Faith talking about those stars on
[1:18:30] fire with the fire of God how many love
[1:18:31] that by God's grace want to be on fire
[1:18:34] with the fire of God holding forth the
[1:18:36] word of Truth and there he stands to
[1:18:37] back them up Hallelujah I got church
[1:18:41] like like brother man said when you're
[1:18:43] an ambassador for Christ he said uh uh
[1:18:46] he said You' got all of Heaven backing
[1:18:48] you up amen well people say I can't do
[1:18:50] this or I can't stand up to my family or
[1:18:52] I can't stand up to my boss you can't
[1:18:55] you've got all Heaven backing you up
[1:18:56] amen you might lose and forfeit a few
[1:18:59] things on this Earth but you've got all
[1:19:01] Heaven behind you to lead you to the
[1:19:02] next Open Door amen sacrifice everything
[1:19:06] for Christ amen he'll make it turn out
[1:19:08] good if we just realize who's behind us
[1:19:11] amen who's backing us up Hallelujah
[1:19:13] who's behind Stephen who was backing up
[1:19:15] Stephen when he got stoned that day
[1:19:17] Christ all heaven was backing him up it
[1:19:20] was God's will for him to die as a
[1:19:22] martyr amen but all heaven was backing
[1:19:24] up how how do you know because Jesus
[1:19:26] stood up he was sitting down at the
[1:19:27] right hand of majesty he stood up to
[1:19:29] receive him and salute him as he came to
[1:19:31] Heaven Hallelujah he raised there to
[1:19:34] receive him and he said receive my
[1:19:37] spirit and no doubt Christ did
[1:19:39] amen
[1:19:41] exactly all Heavens backing you up and
[1:19:43] he backed him up so much that he didn't
[1:19:45] even feel the the pain of the
[1:19:46] stones right the Bible said he went to
[1:19:49] sleep before he got hit with the stones
[1:19:51] hallelujah amen because all heaven was
[1:19:53] backing him up
[1:19:56] I love this let's let's pray this is a
[1:19:58] reality this next what I got here in
[1:20:00] yellow brother Ram's words and think of
[1:20:03] it not one
[1:20:05] believer of any age needs cry in his
[1:20:08] heart oh that I might have been back
[1:20:11] there in the first age when the apostles
[1:20:13] were first sent
[1:20:15] out he said there is no need to look
[1:20:17] back look up isn't that such a isn't
[1:20:21] that such a faith raising statement
[1:20:22] there we don't have to look back and say
[1:20:24] oh I wish we were in the days of the
[1:20:25] Apostles brother BR said just look up to
[1:20:27] heaven praise God don't look back and
[1:20:31] say oh I wish we could have did that
[1:20:32] there look up and say he's the same
[1:20:35] yesterday today and
[1:20:37] forever Behold Him who is
[1:20:40] now walking in the midst of the churches
[1:20:43] throughout all ages say Lord we're
[1:20:45] looking up to you you're walking in our
[1:20:47] lives right now you're walking in this
[1:20:49] church in our Humble Church you're
[1:20:50] walking our humble families and our
[1:20:52] humble lives we look up to you we ask
[1:20:54] you to move upon the scene that simple
[1:20:56] humble childlike faith God will honor
[1:20:59] childlike
[1:21:01] Faith praise
[1:21:04] God Behold Him him who is the same
[1:21:07] yesterday today and forever and who
[1:21:09] never changes either in essence he said
[1:21:13] or in his
[1:21:14] ways where two or three are gathered
[1:21:16] together in his name there he is in the
[1:21:18] midst he's here tonight amen glory and
[1:21:21] not only in their midst as a complacent
[1:21:23] onlooker
[1:21:25] or as a recording Angel but there he
[1:21:27] stands expressing exactly what he is the
[1:21:31] life and sustainer and Giver of all good
[1:21:35] gifts to the church Hallelujah so Jesus
[1:21:38] is not just here taking notes I wonder
[1:21:40] how Adam and Bo are gonna behave tonight
[1:21:42] I wonder how brother Jesse is gonna
[1:21:43] behave and just standing back he's
[1:21:46] actually standing here like trying to
[1:21:48] offer and give us something brother bam
[1:21:51] said Remember the Holy Spirit goes to
[1:21:53] every aisle and once to minister to
[1:21:55] every aisle like what do you need
[1:21:56] brother amen what do you need Lydia what
[1:21:58] do you need Saints you know he's here to
[1:22:01] give you something here tonight he's not
[1:22:03] just watching and just making sure you
[1:22:04] know you're behaving and you're you're
[1:22:06] nice and you're in church order more
[1:22:08] than that he wants to give you life he
[1:22:10] wants to strengthen you he wants to
[1:22:12] sustain you tonight because he wants to
[1:22:14] give you all good
[1:22:15] things praise God I like that not just
[1:22:18] onlooker not just observing but he wants
[1:22:20] to be a part of the worship amen wants
[1:22:22] to be a part of your experience tonight
[1:22:24] don't you love him for that
[1:22:28] amen so
[1:22:34] now all
[1:22:36] right how meaningful are those words he
[1:22:39] walks in the midst of the seven
[1:22:40] candlesticks viewed when viewed in the
[1:22:42] light of scripture which describes him
[1:22:44] as Christ who is our life for Christ
[1:22:48] indeed is the life of the church she has
[1:22:50] no other life and look at this without
[1:22:52] him she's simply a religious Society
[1:22:55] a club a meaningless Gathering of the
[1:22:58] people so those without the anointing
[1:23:01] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:02] without the true word of God it's just a
[1:23:05] simple religious Society or Club a
[1:23:09] meaningless Gathering of the people so
[1:23:11] the worship is done in
[1:23:13] vain let's go to Matthew 15 you remember
[1:23:15] when Jesus said
[1:23:17] this any church or any Gathering any no
[1:23:20] matter how mega church or how small it
[1:23:22] is anyone who denies the word it becomes
[1:23:25] just a meaningless Gathering of
[1:23:27] people uh their Gathering is in vain and
[1:23:30] that's hard to say but it is the truth
[1:23:32] so we must make sure we never limit the
[1:23:34] Holy Spirit we must know that all things
[1:23:36] are possible we must not break the
[1:23:39] word all
[1:23:42] right all right let's read verses eight
[1:23:44] and nine anyone want to read eight and
[1:23:45] nine brother Adam yeah you want to read
[1:23:46] eight and nine thank you
[1:23:48] sir this people unto me with their mouth
[1:23:53] and hon me with their lips but their
[1:23:56] heart is from me but in V they do
[1:24:00] worship me teaching for do the
[1:24:03] Commandments of man amen thank you sir
[1:24:06] anytime someone teaches their own ideas
[1:24:09] and makes it seem like it's the commands
[1:24:11] of God they've entered into vain
[1:24:13] meaningless Church
[1:24:15] worship God does not receive
[1:24:18] that
[1:24:20] right so we must take the and this is of
[1:24:22] course the Pharisees of the day they
[1:24:24] were saying oh you know you can remember
[1:24:26] that remember they told the the the
[1:24:28] children oh you don't have to support
[1:24:29] your parents when they're old just give
[1:24:31] that money that you're going to give to
[1:24:31] your parents don't support them give it
[1:24:33] to the church just as an offering and
[1:24:35] Jesus said you worship God in vain
[1:24:38] that's not keeping the word of God
[1:24:40] you've changed the word and you
[1:24:42] perverted it and now it's a meaningless
[1:24:44] Gathering I don't want to be a part of a
[1:24:46] meaningless church I want a church
[1:24:48] that's pulsating with life amen you can
[1:24:51] feel the life you can feel the love for
[1:24:52] Christ people hungering for more of the
[1:24:54] word I want to grow deeper in Christ
[1:24:56] brother Jesse I don't want just a
[1:24:58] society I don't want to be bride of
[1:24:59] Christ Society I want to be bride of
[1:25:02] Christ True Fellowship amen Spirit
[1:25:05] anointed Fellowship not Club Fellowship
[1:25:07] not Society Fellowship not meaningless
[1:25:09] Fellowship but Life Fellowship
[1:25:12] amen see as a corpse and this is quite a
[1:25:15] picture as a corpse be jeweled and
[1:25:18] dressed is still a corpse so the church
[1:25:21] no matter what her programs and her
[1:25:23] gracious efforts might aeve achieve
[1:25:24] without Christ she is a corpse also
[1:25:28] that's quite a statement but the
[1:25:30] scripture says it right here when you
[1:25:31] take the commands of God and change them
[1:25:34] to commands of men you've already
[1:25:36] entered into vain worship now we don't
[1:25:38] know who get saved in those churches
[1:25:40] right because it all depends on how they
[1:25:41] treat the True Believer that determines
[1:25:43] their salvation at that point if they
[1:25:45] turn down the Holy Ghost if they turn
[1:25:47] down the word how they going to get the
[1:25:49] Holy Ghost when they can't even get
[1:25:50] Sanctified and get the sin out of their
[1:25:51] lives how they G they can't it's
[1:25:52] impossible they Cru they crucify the
[1:25:55] effects of the word to the
[1:25:58] people
[1:26:00] right and so that's what we see we
[1:26:03] cannot become a club we have to have the
[1:26:04] Life of Christ he is my life that's the
[1:26:07] reason I'm here because I'm living I'm
[1:26:09] on fire for him amen okay the white but
[1:26:11] but with him W with him in her midst I
[1:26:15] like this with him motivating her what's
[1:26:17] your motivation tonight I hope it's
[1:26:19] Christ motivating you it's not like well
[1:26:22] I don't want the pastor to email me or
[1:26:23] text me where' you you should have come
[1:26:25] to church how come you're not at church
[1:26:27] that's not your motivation your
[1:26:28] motivation should be I'm here to love
[1:26:30] Christ I'm here to receive something
[1:26:33] from the sustainer I'm here to receive
[1:26:35] something from The Giver I want to be a
[1:26:38] receiver tonight remember at the same
[1:26:40] time you can be a giver too give him
[1:26:41] some praise give him some worship give
[1:26:43] him some love give him some real praise
[1:26:46] from real lips not just honoring God
[1:26:48] with your lips but real praise from your
[1:26:51] lips amen because my heart is not far
[1:26:53] from him my heart is close to him amen
[1:26:56] he's in my heart hallelujah amen
[1:27:00] yes he's my motivation that's why I'm
[1:27:03] the first one to church that's why I'm
[1:27:04] the last one to leave that's why I'm the
[1:27:06] one praying or that's why I sing or
[1:27:07] that's why I raise my hands he's
[1:27:09] motivating me to worship amen he's my
[1:27:14] motivation so with Christ in the midst
[1:27:17] of the church the church becomes a
[1:27:20] wonderment the people wonder at her of
[1:27:23] all his body the fullness of him that
[1:27:26] filth all in
[1:27:29] all and this very hour he's walking in
[1:27:32] the midst of the last ages golden
[1:27:34] Candlestick that's us when he was I'm
[1:27:38] sorry when he was as he walked in the
[1:27:41] first age he is even now in this last
[1:27:44] age so as he was then he's now Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[1:27:50] forever amen
[1:27:54] all
[1:27:59] right next one okay doing pretty good I
[1:28:01] got about 15 minutes that'll be
[1:28:03] good now he goes back to the golden
[1:28:06] Candlestick see that he walks now he
[1:28:08] gets back to the gold I preached a
[1:28:09] little message on that remember about
[1:28:11] the golden candlesticks but here he
[1:28:13] brings it out again he brings out a
[1:28:14] little more on this about how we're
[1:28:16] liking on the golden
[1:28:19] candlesticks Exodus 25:31 and thou shalt
[1:28:22] make a Candlestick of pure
[1:28:24] gold of beaten work shall the
[1:28:27] Candlestick be
[1:28:29] made his shaft branches his bowls his
[1:28:33] knops and his flowers shall be of the
[1:28:36] same so now he gets back into giving his
[1:28:39] comments these are a prophet's inspired
[1:28:41] thoughts about uh this beaten pure gold
[1:28:45] Candlestick the True Church of Jesus
[1:28:47] Christ the bride is likened to pure gold
[1:28:50] her righteousness is his
[1:28:53] righteousness her
[1:28:55] attributes is I'm sorry yes her
[1:28:58] attributes are his own glorious
[1:29:00] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:29:03] what he is she is to reflect so other
[1:29:07] words however he lived his life that's
[1:29:08] how we live our
[1:29:11] lives what he has she is to manifest
[1:29:15] amen there's no fault in her why because
[1:29:18] she walks in the light she confesses her
[1:29:19] sins She Walks In The Blood amen she is
[1:29:23] all glorious within and without so she
[1:29:27] has a pure heart and she lives pure
[1:29:29] before
[1:29:30] man because she's being
[1:29:33] washed from beginning to ending she is
[1:29:35] the work of her
[1:29:37] Lord and all his works are
[1:29:40] perfect in fact in her is summed up and
[1:29:43] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:29:45] purpose of God how can one fathom it how
[1:29:48] can we understand this how can one
[1:29:50] understand it though we cannot do that
[1:29:52] we accept it by faith for God has spoken
[1:29:55] into it in other words Christ is going
[1:29:57] to pound on our
[1:29:59] lives Christ is going to beat on our
[1:30:01] lives till all people see in US is gold
[1:30:04] all people see in US is the word praise
[1:30:07] God but we got to lay there brother said
[1:30:09] you gotta lay there and get
[1:30:12] beaten you imagine if the gold jumped
[1:30:14] off the gold Smith's you know
[1:30:16] table you's got you gotta you got to
[1:30:18] chase that gold around and get it bring
[1:30:20] It come back here well that's what we do
[1:30:21] if we don't take the word of God if we
[1:30:24] don't come and hear the word and apply
[1:30:26] the word to our lives we got to lay
[1:30:28] there and let Christ beat us until all
[1:30:31] the dross all the dirt gets out of our
[1:30:36] life but not only is the Candlestick of
[1:30:39] gold it is a beaten
[1:30:41] gold handcrafted a beaten gold according
[1:30:43] to her blueprints which were
[1:30:46] spirit-given remember where did Moses
[1:30:48] get the the the the pattern he got it
[1:30:50] from Heaven the Holy Spirit showed him
[1:30:51] the Candlestick in heaven so he built it
[1:30:53] on Earth
[1:30:55] Glory outside of her Lord and Master
[1:30:58] Jesus Christ was ever a people so beaten
[1:31:01] and purged as the bride of
[1:31:04] Christ can you think of anyone else
[1:31:06] being beaten and purged as much as the
[1:31:08] bride of Christ surely she's filling up
[1:31:12] the sufferings that Christ has left
[1:31:15] behind remember uh SS schmucker's
[1:31:19] glorious Reformation I think he wrote it
[1:31:21] in the
[1:31:22] 1800s uh they calculated at least 68
[1:31:24] million Martyrs and I've heard bigger
[1:31:26] numbers than that from different
[1:31:28] historians at least 68 million
[1:31:30] Christians were killed uh from around
[1:31:33] 300
[1:31:35] ad um what's that man St Augustine of
[1:31:38] Hippo that's it right there it's coming
[1:31:40] back to me now St Augustina hippo was a
[1:31:42] a Roman Catholic priest and he said uh
[1:31:45] shouldn't we compel people with Force to
[1:31:49] bring them into the um uh to bring them
[1:31:52] into the Catholic Church
[1:31:54] he said because if we do that he said
[1:31:56] then they'll be saved from hell so
[1:31:59] through that letter and I can show you
[1:32:00] the letter brother it's in the books
[1:32:02] it's recorded in the books brother BR
[1:32:03] recorded as well through that letter
[1:32:05] they started taking that letter from
[1:32:06] that Pope or not Pope Cardinal Bishop
[1:32:08] whatever he
[1:32:09] was and they started persecuting
[1:32:11] Christians and from that time in 300 ad
[1:32:14] all the way up uh to the 1800s at least
[1:32:17] 68 million at least
[1:32:19] recorded and that was the true church
[1:32:22] see that's Christ letting his church be
[1:32:24] beaten praise God beaten that's a beaten
[1:32:27] Church they got to be killed they got to
[1:32:29] go through suffering they got to lose uh
[1:32:31] their very
[1:32:33] lives but was ever a body ever beaten as
[1:32:35] much as the body of Christ brother said
[1:32:38] no the body of Christ has been beaten
[1:32:40] and purged more than any other
[1:32:42] people think about that now remember how
[1:32:45] many Jews were killed in the Holocaust
[1:32:47] seven or eight
[1:32:49] million look at this with Christians
[1:32:51] look at this Christians over this course
[1:32:53] you see that was ever a church ever
[1:32:55] beaten so much as the bride of Christ
[1:32:58] look at this her goods are despoiled her
[1:33:03] life is in Jeopardy now not ours at
[1:33:05] least in the US not yet she's accounted
[1:33:09] as sheep for the slaughter she's killed
[1:33:11] all the day long she suffers much but in
[1:33:14] it all retaliates not neither does she
[1:33:17] cause others to
[1:33:19] suffer so that that's what we got to be
[1:33:21] careful of when we're hurt what do we do
[1:33:23] many times we lash out other people for
[1:33:24] not careful right but a Christian when
[1:33:28] they get hurt should not lash out at
[1:33:30] others but just give commit that unto
[1:33:32] God say God you take that pain I don't
[1:33:35] want to I don't want to uh cause anyone
[1:33:38] else pain I'm going to give that pain to
[1:33:41] you I'm gonna cast that care upon
[1:33:43] you just because somebody hurt me
[1:33:45] doesn't mean I have to hurt somebody
[1:33:46] else I'll take that hurt and I'll give
[1:33:48] it to Jesus and that stops the
[1:33:51] cycle amen
[1:33:57] worthy of the Gospel is this lovely
[1:33:59] bride of Christ amen and as gold is
[1:34:03] malleable or which means shapable
[1:34:05] bendable whereas brass will break with
[1:34:07] the beating this gold of God will bear
[1:34:10] her suffering for the Lord so notice
[1:34:11] we're not called an iron or brass Church
[1:34:14] we're called a gold
[1:34:15] church because we can be shaped and
[1:34:17] molded by the pounding and beating of
[1:34:19] God's word
[1:34:22] hallelujah not bowed not broken not
[1:34:26] destroyed but formed as a thing of
[1:34:28] beauty and a joy Forever by the trials
[1:34:32] and testings of this life praise God
[1:34:35] I've got about 10 minutes I want to
[1:34:36] bring these quotes back to you now for
[1:34:37] some reason USA citizens will suffer at
[1:34:41] some point remember there's about four
[1:34:43] or five quotes in the church age book
[1:34:45] brother Bram said the bride will be
[1:34:46] forced to stop
[1:34:47] preaching um that's I think I taught
[1:34:49] that a few weeks ago and I told I I
[1:34:51] share with you what I feel has to be uh
[1:34:53] has to take place before the Rapture and
[1:34:56] that's part of it the political system
[1:34:57] has to come down I believe on the True
[1:34:59] Believer and has to put pressure or a
[1:35:02] squeeze upon them brother bandam said he
[1:35:05] he thought the Holy Spirit told him that
[1:35:07] the bride would be forced to stop
[1:35:08] preaching in
[1:35:09] America uh so at some point this
[1:35:13] suffering we may experience some
[1:35:15] suffering but church that that that this
[1:35:17] will be nothing compared to the
[1:35:18] tribulation period in the tribulation
[1:35:20] it'll be so awful that they'll be
[1:35:22] crawling in aves just seeking to die and
[1:35:25] they won't be able to die that's
[1:35:29] tribulation and us if we if we can't
[1:35:31] have this building anymore and I can't
[1:35:33] preach and and you can't come and sing
[1:35:34] together anymore that's nothing compared
[1:35:36] to what they'll go through that's not a
[1:35:38] tribulation that's just a
[1:35:41] squeeze that's just a little bit of a
[1:35:43] squeeze like squeezing the orange you
[1:35:45] know that's not
[1:35:47] tribulation they'll be so brother said
[1:35:49] they'll be in insane he said thus say
[1:35:51] the Lord they'll be so insane they'll be
[1:35:53] be so insane they won't even be able to
[1:35:54] kill themselves anymore no guns knives
[1:35:57] drugs they'll be so insane they won't
[1:35:59] even be able to kill themselves they'll
[1:36:00] be just scratching and crawling to be
[1:36:02] able to die and the Bible say they won't
[1:36:04] even be able to find Death that's the
[1:36:06] tribulation they're going through we'll
[1:36:08] see nothing of that how many you believe
[1:36:10] that and brother baham said in 1953 he
[1:36:13] said thus say the Lord he said before
[1:36:15] any soldiers and he said Russian but he
[1:36:17] didn't say Russian soldiers he thus say
[1:36:19] the Lord he just said soldiers he said
[1:36:20] before any soldiers would come to this
[1:36:22] nation and uh rape our women or or do
[1:36:25] anything like that he said the church
[1:36:27] will be gone he said thus sayith the
[1:36:28] Lord so we have nothing to worry about
[1:36:31] that anything evil like that the church
[1:36:33] will be gone before that he said thus
[1:36:36] sayi the Lord I can show you that it's
[1:36:37] on the video if you want to look it up
[1:36:38] on our YouTube channel uh the future
[1:36:41] Prophecies of brother Brandon thus
[1:36:42] sayith the
[1:36:43] Lord but here's the quotes where at some
[1:36:45] point there will be some suffering and
[1:36:47] some persecution okay now but not for
[1:36:50] the bride now the bride will be squeezed
[1:36:52] but it ain't tribulation it's not like
[1:36:54] what we're talking
[1:36:55] about now see I copied this from the
[1:36:57] website and I put all this white on
[1:36:59] there hope that don't hurt your eyes but
[1:37:01] did you notice the Beast that come up
[1:37:02] out of the sea now I taught him that
[1:37:03] that's ma that's Revelation 13 that
[1:37:05] Beast is the same Antichrist power that
[1:37:08] was in Pagan Rome 2,000 years ago The
[1:37:12] Same Spirit behind that is now in Papa
[1:37:14] roome right and that Papa roome Spirit
[1:37:17] has risen up here in the United States
[1:37:19] it got a president there JFK and now
[1:37:21] most of the I think a third or
[1:37:23] two-thirds of the Senators and so forth
[1:37:25] are
[1:37:26] Catholic that's
[1:37:29] right and when you see the Beast coming
[1:37:31] up out of the sea that's uh the the
[1:37:34] spirit the Antichrist Spirit coming up
[1:37:36] out of Rome it's meant that this power
[1:37:39] was raising up amongst the people but in
[1:37:41] Revelation 13 when this lamb came up he
[1:37:44] came up out of the earth no people
[1:37:46] United States right we went over that he
[1:37:50] come up out the land that was United
[1:37:51] States so the Antichrist Spirit United
[1:37:52] States
[1:37:54] he says' but then after he had two
[1:37:56] little horns civil which is political
[1:37:59] government and ecclesiastical which is
[1:38:01] church powers that little
[1:38:03] Buffalo civil political and church
[1:38:06] Powers he's got two
[1:38:08] powers and then he received power and
[1:38:10] spoke like the dragon did before him now
[1:38:14] look what he says so you just got to
[1:38:16] mark it down I'm not I'm not going to
[1:38:18] tell you to mark it down your Bible but
[1:38:19] I'm going to tell you I'm marking it
[1:38:20] down in this PowerPoint right here it's
[1:38:22] marked down
[1:38:24] you mark it down we're coming into
[1:38:26] religious persecution with the same
[1:38:29] things that they did in Pagan Rome many
[1:38:31] years ago for it's thus saith the
[1:38:35] Lord we're not experiencing we're not
[1:38:37] seeing we're not we're not slaughtered
[1:38:39] like sheep right in America but some
[1:38:42] countries do have to battle
[1:38:45] that brother Craig just got back from
[1:38:47] Gana I'm sorry Uganda in Africa and he
[1:38:50] said they have to pray every day just
[1:38:51] for their safety because Christians get
[1:38:52] killed every day there there and there
[1:38:54] they are preaching amongst you in Uganda
[1:38:57] I think it's right near the Horn of
[1:38:58] Africa if I'm not not mistaken a very
[1:39:00] poor poor country he said but you he
[1:39:03] said you should hear those people sing
[1:39:04] and the faith they have to see Miracles
[1:39:06] and he said they barely have any food
[1:39:08] but they pray every day and God sends
[1:39:09] them food
[1:39:11] somehow he said now look at our lives
[1:39:13] are so uh so much
[1:39:16] different and so he says we must not get
[1:39:19] weak in faith we must remember them we
[1:39:21] must be strong in faith because at some
[1:39:24] point it's coming to us we'll get
[1:39:27] squeezed but not not tribulation
[1:39:30] material all right now that's if we live
[1:39:32] to see it we could live out and we might
[1:39:34] not even see the persecution but it sure
[1:39:36] looks like it's going to come soon it
[1:39:38] sure looks like it the way they're
[1:39:39] letting homosexuals and transgender and
[1:39:41] all these things like that it sure looks
[1:39:42] like it'll be soon but we don't know it
[1:39:44] could be another hundred years we don't
[1:39:46] know that was in 1958 he says it again
[1:39:50] in 61 three years later now you see why
[1:39:53] my voice is going to be stopped pretty
[1:39:54] soon somebody's going to know yes why
[1:39:57] Revelation 2:20 she called herself a
[1:40:00] propheus that's speaking of course the
[1:40:01] spirit in the Roman Catholic Church you
[1:40:03] just watch the wave of sin happen
[1:40:06] now you watch Core Go Plum to the core
[1:40:09] haven't we seen it look at that that was
[1:40:10] 1961 hasn't it gone uh Plumb to the core
[1:40:15] of sin and rotness that we see now it is
[1:40:17] to the core it's rotten to the core this
[1:40:20] nation is rotten to the Core there's no
[1:40:24] hope for this nation it's so in love
[1:40:26] with sin and drunken with sin and evil
[1:40:29] spirits there's no hope for the nation
[1:40:31] but there's light for the church because
[1:40:33] Christ is walking in our midst amen
[1:40:36] glory Christ walks in our midst to save
[1:40:40] souls in this hour to heal Hallelujah to
[1:40:42] forgive uh to restore Hallelujah to
[1:40:46] prophesy he's right here in the midst
[1:40:48] tonight
[1:40:49] Hallelujah for those that love him you
[1:40:52] watch my monistic watch ungodly things
[1:40:55] happen to the churches and finally there
[1:40:57] will come a persecution the Bible says
[1:40:59] so thus sayith the Lord he says
[1:41:02] certainly there will
[1:41:04] be all right he says again
[1:41:07] 1954 someday thus saith the Holy Spirit
[1:41:10] here's a real man of God who knows how
[1:41:11] to use thus sayth the Lord out of the
[1:41:14] word of God that America there had been
[1:41:17] a whole turning of God down and America
[1:41:20] will receive the mark of the beast
[1:41:21] according to Revelation the 13th chapter
[1:41:23] and we're moving into it God cannot let
[1:41:26] any Nation he goes dot dot dot he kind
[1:41:28] of goes off on a different thought so
[1:41:30] there it is there's thus sayth the Lord
[1:41:31] America will take the mark of the
[1:41:33] beast which brother brand said was
[1:41:35] unionized religion we went over that
[1:41:37] unionized
[1:41:38] religion okay I got about two minutes
[1:41:40] here so let me you know look at this
[1:41:43] next one I thought I would get that far
[1:41:46] but let me just go a couple can I just
[1:41:47] go a couple more uh by God's grace
[1:41:49] something else I wanted to show let me
[1:41:52] uh
[1:41:55] yeah let me let me uh stop with one more
[1:41:57] let me go one
[1:41:58] more
[1:42:01] uh let me go two more slides yeah two
[1:42:04] more slides these are just some just I
[1:42:06] want to close these beautiful quotes
[1:42:09] here of Revelation 2 verse2 I want to
[1:42:11] close with this this just was really
[1:42:13] encouraging to me and this is how I want
[1:42:15] to run the church as the shepherd I want
[1:42:17] to run the church by the spirit like
[1:42:19] Christ does and like brother Bram told
[1:42:21] us to run the church Watch How I want
[1:42:23] you to watch this is how you're supposed
[1:42:24] to run the church and your family so now
[1:42:27] we're starting to get some fam some
[1:42:28] married couples amen some more you know
[1:42:31] by God's grace if God terries have
[1:42:33] little children running around
[1:42:34] here that's why I told brother amen we
[1:42:36] got to pray and maybe God would have us
[1:42:37] to build a church you know because if
[1:42:38] God terries we need a place for your
[1:42:40] children you know we need a Sunday
[1:42:41] school and it'd be nice toh not pour the
[1:42:44] money into you know just the renting it'
[1:42:47] be smart if God carries and there's two
[1:42:48] or three more Generations you know
[1:42:50] before the Rapture it would just might
[1:42:51] be a better investment but the point is
[1:42:54] if God gives us families and children we
[1:42:57] must raise them in the fear of God they
[1:42:59] need to be taught the word of God and we
[1:43:01] must run our homes and this church the
[1:43:05] way Christ runs the church age so I want
[1:43:08] you to see this scripture as as we as
[1:43:11] odd as it might seem this scripture
[1:43:12] shows how Christ runs the church right
[1:43:15] here which means he starts out with a
[1:43:17] compliment how many like to hear a
[1:43:20] compliment well you know your your wives
[1:43:22] husbands husbands got to tell your wies
[1:43:24] honey you look real pretty tonight you
[1:43:25] you you look real beautiful you know oh
[1:43:27] this was a beautiful it was a delicious
[1:43:28] meal honey you know you got a compliment
[1:43:32] her right Brothers like to hear
[1:43:34] compliments oh honey thanks for doing
[1:43:35] that thanks for taking out the trash or
[1:43:37] thanks for paying the bills or thanks
[1:43:38] for going to work I appreciate you you
[1:43:40] know uh everybody likes to hear
[1:43:42] compliments well that's what Christ does
[1:43:45] Christ compliments his wife amen and
[1:43:48] that makes me humble because I would
[1:43:51] love to hear him compliment me or
[1:43:53] compliment our church or compliment our
[1:43:55] families in the church would you love to
[1:43:56] hear that because so often we just think
[1:43:58] condemnation or wrath wrath or judgment
[1:43:59] judgment but really Christ always starts
[1:44:02] off with
[1:44:04] compliments because that's how he starts
[1:44:06] off the church age he says listen here's
[1:44:09] the one who has seven seven stars in his
[1:44:12] right hand I'll use my right hand and
[1:44:14] walks in the churches and he starts off
[1:44:16] with a compliment I
[1:44:17] know your Works your labor brother amen
[1:44:21] I know your labor brother Adam I know
[1:44:22] your labor you sisters I know your labor
[1:44:25] and I know of your works and your
[1:44:28] patience and I know how you can't bear
[1:44:31] them which you're evil now let's get
[1:44:33] into this these last two quotes I got
[1:44:34] two more slides and we'll stop because
[1:44:36] that is about an hour I told my wife I
[1:44:37] said if everything works out I'll just
[1:44:39] preach hour I'll end at 8:30 and it's
[1:44:41] 8:32 so we're doing pretty
[1:44:44] good look brother bam says us how
[1:44:47] beautifully the Savior praises and
[1:44:50] commends or compliments his children
[1:44:54] so Christ always starts off with an
[1:44:56] encouragement how many you like to be
[1:44:58] encouraged remember one of the benefits
[1:45:00] of coming to church is that you
[1:45:01] strengthen other people just by coming
[1:45:03] to church like I told you when I see
[1:45:05] everybody come to church I am so
[1:45:06] encouraged I could I don't care if I'm
[1:45:08] just preaching to two of you if two
[1:45:10] people come I just get so encouraged
[1:45:11] hallelujah we're gonna have church amen
[1:45:13] we're gonna we're gonna glorify God
[1:45:15] we'll sing and clap and shout and
[1:45:17] whatever because it builds people up
[1:45:19] just to see you gather together in faith
[1:45:22] to experience God's spirit amongst
[1:45:25] us it's
[1:45:27] true look at this how beautifully he
[1:45:30] Praises them so that's why everybody
[1:45:33] likes to be complimented because that's
[1:45:34] what Christ does Christ compliments his
[1:45:36] people he takes full account of their
[1:45:38] fine spiritual attitudes and behavior
[1:45:41] he's watching your attitude your good
[1:45:43] attitude about the reading the word and
[1:45:44] praying and and listening to the
[1:45:46] messages he likes your attitude
[1:45:49] Hallelujah he likes your good behavior
[1:45:51] he knows that there is a weakness
[1:45:53] amongst them but as yet he does not cry
[1:45:56] out against it you see that he he knows
[1:45:58] they got everybody's got weaknesses but
[1:46:00] he starts off with a
[1:46:03] compliment isn't that just like the
[1:46:06] Lord isn't that just like Jesus he knows
[1:46:10] how to encourage Us in the right
[1:46:12] matters and discourage Us in the wrong
[1:46:17] matters we could all learn a good lesson
[1:46:20] right here in running the church and our
[1:46:24] families now as a man as a
[1:46:28] husband as a father of six
[1:46:31] children I've learned that this is the
[1:46:33] best way to correct my
[1:46:35] children it's not just to shout and
[1:46:37] scream right away the first time
[1:46:39] somebody spills something what are you
[1:46:42] doing how could you spill
[1:46:45] that or if you see them doing something
[1:46:47] wrong the first
[1:46:49] response shouldn't always be negative
[1:46:54] we have to ask the holy spirit to guide
[1:46:56] us and so many times you want to start
[1:46:58] with a positive before you bring up the
[1:47:02] negative right because that's what
[1:47:03] Christ does with the church Christ
[1:47:05] doesn't come out and say you bunch of
[1:47:06] backsliders and you're all fallen short
[1:47:09] and you left your first love that's
[1:47:11] later he starts with a compliment to the
[1:47:15] church he shows them as D I am God I'm
[1:47:18] walking in the midst of the candlesticks
[1:47:20] I've got seven stars in my hand I
[1:47:21] control The Messengers I control the
[1:47:23] word for each age and he said I know all
[1:47:26] about your works and your good
[1:47:28] behavior I want to praise you for
[1:47:31] that that's what he says and that's a
[1:47:34] good lesson so sometimes in my family or
[1:47:36] if I see something wrong in someone's
[1:47:38] life I'll wait a little bit before I
[1:47:39] talk to them about it because I want to
[1:47:42] see I don't want to just be like a a you
[1:47:45] know a strict judge you know as soon as
[1:47:46] I see like a Catholic nun like my dad
[1:47:48] said he said if they were messing around
[1:47:49] in the school they'd walk over there
[1:47:51] with a a a ruler and s slap them on the
[1:47:54] knuckles if they're playing inside their
[1:47:56] desk they' slap them like that with with
[1:47:58] rulers with wooden rulers and till they
[1:48:01] bleed no mercy just
[1:48:05] correction and that's why you know
[1:48:07] that's why I try to be like that I try
[1:48:09] to be more start with a compliment
[1:48:11] before you bring the
[1:48:12] correction praise God start off with a
[1:48:15] handshake and a hug and then say well
[1:48:17] brother or sister can I can I talk to
[1:48:18] you about something by God's
[1:48:20] grace start with a commment start with
[1:48:22] love to let the person know that you
[1:48:24] love him now are there times that God
[1:48:26] has to ball people out of course yes
[1:48:29] eleazer remember when he took the the
[1:48:31] spear and and thrust it through that man
[1:48:33] and the msh woman you know to stop the
[1:48:35] plague in the days of Moses there's
[1:48:38] times yeah there are times to lay the
[1:48:39] hammer down but when Christ address
[1:48:42] addresses the church he starts off with
[1:48:46] encouragement and we could all learn a
[1:48:48] lesson by running our churches and our
[1:48:50] marriages and our fames
[1:48:53] by encouraging
[1:48:55] us first before we do the correction how
[1:48:58] many can say Amen to that does that does
[1:48:59] that make sense Christ starts off his
[1:49:02] greeting to the church I know your works
[1:49:05] I know your
[1:49:06] labor he said and better still we could
[1:49:09] all learn a good lesson and that God
[1:49:11] deals with each one of us in exactly
[1:49:14] this way so not just to the church ages
[1:49:17] do Christ treat us this way it's every
[1:49:20] one of us as taught individually so on a
[1:49:23] whole church scale a whole age scale he
[1:49:25] treats them all that way but also on an
[1:49:27] individual
[1:49:29] scale well I really appreciate he might
[1:49:31] whisper this in your
[1:49:32] heart I really appreciate your worship
[1:49:34] and coming to church
[1:49:35] today but we really need to work I
[1:49:37] really need you to repent of this area
[1:49:40] and get this area cleaned out of your
[1:49:42] life praise God that's our Gentle Savior
[1:49:45] praise the Lord he knows how to
[1:49:47] encourage Us in the things we're doing
[1:49:49] right and he knows how to discourage us
[1:49:51] say this is is not pleasing to me this
[1:49:54] hinders the move of the Holy Spirit when
[1:49:55] you do this but I really appreciate your
[1:49:58] service you're really growing as a real
[1:50:01] Christian amen don't you like that he
[1:50:04] starts off with a
[1:50:06] compliment and then he brings forth the
[1:50:08] correction so especially the brothers
[1:50:10] you know because the brothers are the
[1:50:12] ones that to lead in the family
[1:50:14] now if they got to bring correction to
[1:50:16] the wives or children or anything like
[1:50:18] that they want to do it in love they
[1:50:20] want to bring love and then they want to
[1:50:22] bring
[1:50:24] correction all right but remember too
[1:50:26] sisters there's a way to bring Godly
[1:50:29] correction to the husband it's live a
[1:50:31] Godly life in front of him that's what
[1:50:33] the Bible said if your husband's not
[1:50:35] obeying the word then you without the
[1:50:37] word correct them with your
[1:50:39] love and I'll tell you there's a quote I
[1:50:41] found too brother Braham said this
[1:50:43] brother Braham said he said Brothers you
[1:50:44] know how your wife is your correction he
[1:50:46] said he said my wife ma is my
[1:50:49] correction did you know he said that
[1:50:53] I have to bring that quote on Sunday so
[1:50:55] you can see it and I found the same
[1:50:57] thing in other words my wife many times
[1:51:00] in other words I'm the one who offends
[1:51:01] my wife more than she offends
[1:51:04] me praise God I'm not getting many amens
[1:51:07] but that's okay I don't need many amens
[1:51:09] I'm just I'm just telling you what
[1:51:10] brother Ram
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:12] said so in other
[1:51:14] words uh
[1:51:16] maybe maybe it seemed like from Brother
[1:51:18] Bram his wife his wife's Godly character
[1:51:22] correct him more than his cor character
[1:51:25] corrected
[1:51:26] her interesting but I'll show you the
[1:51:29] quote if you want it I show you the
[1:51:30] quote he said why and he even makes a
[1:51:33] joke in the 64 questions answers and he
[1:51:35] says he says honey or he said which
[1:51:38] one's better if I'm close to the mic
[1:51:39] like this or far back and his wife said
[1:51:41] close to the mic he said but he stepped
[1:51:43] back and said and everybody said oh it's
[1:51:45] further away he said honey I finally got
[1:51:47] one thing on you I got one wrong against
[1:51:48] you
[1:51:49] now he's just making a joke like because
[1:51:54] normally the godliness of sister M would
[1:51:56] correct brother
[1:51:58] bradam right because Brothers tend to
[1:52:01] get a little loose sometimes you know
[1:52:02] but yet they're called to
[1:52:04] lead but God uses The Godly character
[1:52:07] not the preaching of the wife right not
[1:52:10] the quoting of the scripture and let me
[1:52:12] tell you something it's The Godly
[1:52:14] character and the prayers and The Godly
[1:52:17] nature of that
[1:52:18] woman that is often a man's correction
[1:52:23] but when he's got to bring correction he
[1:52:25] needs to do it with
[1:52:27] love bringing bring
[1:52:30] compliments and then you bring
[1:52:33] correction and better still we could all
[1:52:35] let's say nor feet I'm already going
[1:52:37] over an hour and 10 minutes we better St
[1:52:40] hope that's helpful by God's grace we
[1:52:42] could all learn a good lesson and that
