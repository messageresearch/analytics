let's take our Bibles here thank you Malachi I kind of went off on a different script there at the end thank you sir nothing he can't handle Hallelujah Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 I like to get back to the Family series this is just a part three I haven't got too far on it but like to look at uh the Christian family again here tonight by God's grace Ephesians 3:14 and 15 so it's the only time in the New Testament the Bible uses the word family so I just like to emphasize that one looking at the spiritual family of the Lord Jesus how many grateful be a part of that family tonight hallelujah amen amen hallelujah read that if we can on three then we'll just have a short word of prayer on three one two three for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known to God with a raised hand or just a humble prayer in your soul here father God we thank you again for tonight Lord fill our way every day with the love of Christ may we walk with that Heavenly Dove Lord God if we don't have a smile Lord or Lord if

Lord God let your word Lord Speak Life to us and strength and Grace Hallelujah and father God we'll be blessed as we leave this place Lord because we're in the house of God hallelujah it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah and we're grateful to be here tonight Lord let your Holy Spirit have its way we ask it in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God hope you had a good week in the Lord um you know I put out that seven Thunders video uh you know yesterday and I got some good feedback course there's some uh you know disagreements too but on this one I'm open to disagreements you know and I've had good conversations with others you know that uh that we know that personally disagree and it's all been good and um reminds me of the book of Acts you know Paul and Barnabas were like I'm not taking Mark and I'm taking Mark and they just the contention was so uh was was so real that they just decided not to go together so we can have Holy Ghost filled saints that just don't see things uh you know the exact same way but how many know the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth praise God hallelujah I believe that by God's grace and so we just want to keep a right Spirit praise God and as you've as you've heard me say you know I just want to be open to all the Revelation that the Holy Ghost has for us praise God church if I know if I'm on my knees every day asking God for Revelation to forgive my sins and reveal yourself to me I believe you'll give it to me praise God don't you because the Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything else will be added unto you praise God so I just believe that with all my heart if we're really in in one Accord with the Holy Ghost and our lives are cleaned out and surely God will reveal more of himself to us Hallelujah so you want to look at this here uh by God's grace the Christian family now part one we looked at the father as the commander he's the blessed man who seeks God first uh he seeks the right way for the family of course the wife's a part of that but he's got to be the leader the husband meets the wife's needs by love he's he's moved by love as Christ loved the church amen and then we looked at the calling uh for children with couples some are called to have children lots of children some medium and some none we saw that from the scripture then we looked at the responsibility of the children they have a responsibility before God in part two we looked at our house uh our houses should serve the Lord Joshua said as for me my house will serve God in other words we're producing something right we should produce faith in Christ we should produce Onward Christian Soldiers amen hallelujah uh as Jesus said the Bible said about Jesus I must be about my father's business so we're in a spiritual business our homes are producing something for the glory of God hallelujah and it's spiritual Warriors in this life and then we looked at how one thing we should seek in our homes is peace in Zechariah remember it said uh have peace in your Gates and judgment and in your Gates so we must have peace in the home in other words able to forgive Hallelujah able to uh not let uh evil feelings right get uh complexes on us right we must not get complexes or strongholds we must cast them down for the glory of God Amen and the Holy Ghost brings three things one of those is peace the other one is righteousness and the other one is Joy right it's not the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink those are all Shadows right those are all things that uh that we must do you know we must have some type of a health and diet and so forth but the real kingdom of God is in righteousness peace and joy Hallelujah that's what it produces and then we finish part one by looking at the five needs of the husband that the wife should meet by the Holy Spirit right and we saw all those from scripture now there could be more than five I think five is a good number it's late laboring Grace Hallelujah and as couples they should labor to love one another by God's grace amen now here we let's look at part three that's a very short summary I'm going to try to keep those shorter by God's grace I want to look at a little more on uh the role of parenting here tonight and then just I want to look at a few more thoughts and I like to close with those thoughts I mentioned on Sunday about brother Dennis McBride's sermons some scriptures that he brought out and then some other ones that as I've studied uh I found to be uh very helpful uh by God's grace so let's go to Proverbs 226 most of you if I start reading this you know you'll be able to recite it right the Bible said train up a in the way that it he should go and when he's old he will not depart from it praise God so I just want to start with that verse there and look at the training uh you know it just means to train uh in the Greek or in the Hebrew rather it's just a simple word doesn't have many different definitions it's to train and of course that means to teach right to show by example Hallelujah and that's what you know that's how the oldfashioned days were you know before this modern Industrial Age most people were agricultural right as Agricultural Society so the children would just grow up and the the brothers or the boys would take on the role of the father right and the mother or the daughters would follow the role of the mother very simple lifestyle right you uh we see it kind of in our former Amish friends at least I do when I go down there to visit them you know the girls they just mimic everything the mother does and the boys they mimic everything the father does and it's neat to see that kind of that old-fashioned way it's a lot different than the modern city people right where Dad goes off to work and the children go off to school and mom goes off to work and they hardly ever see each other till the end of the day right uh they got babysitters all in between and dayc carees all in between and all kinds of things uh doesn't resemble uh what God had in mind God had training in mind because God told him uh write the word of God in your homes and uh write it everywhere wear it on your clothes you know he said put it on your foreheads he said talk about it all the time when you when you raise up when you when you lie down talk about at the table uh focus on the word of God at all times amen hallelujah so we see training was an important part of course of the Hebrew family and of course the Christian part or the Christian family as well uh by God's grace now as I've said before I want to bring this out again remember Esau was likely just as well trained as Jacob right but Esau was hated now we looked at that a few month or a few weeks ago that just doesn't mean God literally hated him like he didn't have any compassion the Bible said God's compassionate to all the wicked God's compassionate God doesn't want to see any wicked perish right he even looked at Judas when he betrayed him and said friend you betray me with a kiss he called him friend to the very last moment and the Bible said he knew the whole time he would betray him now that's love right if you knew this whole time someone's going to betray you and be one of your closest friends and I think you'd have a hard time loving them right but yes Hallelujah wash his feet even uh offered him the bread there and all these things and so it trained him up and that's what I that was my next example brother r no it's no that's good that's a good sign you know if and my next point was Judas is scarrett well maybe he didn't have the best we don't know about his child life but for sure he had the best adult train it was perfect training for three and a half years each one of us can look at our parents say well they they might have failed there as much as we love our parents right they might have been a little bit LAX here or maybe to too strict there too legalistic there but Judas could have never said my master wasn't perfect for me he never he never could have said well I didn't have the right training for three and a half years no you had the perfect training and you still sold it out for miserable pieces of money right 30 pieces of silver miserable then threw it down in the temple but based upon conviction that he sold out the Son of God and so you know we just look at those two examples there you know I've heard different preachers say you know and I don't know I don't know how much this is true but just it would just caught me with this idea of Jacob and Esau it could be true but I've heard different preachers that are way more experienced than me say they know some parents whove tried to do everything right and yet still their children turned out wrong right and that would fit the Esau example you know right uh it would just seemed like it would fit that you know Isaac and Rebecca don't you think they were pretty good parents I imagine you know Isaac was a wonderful man of God we only see really one one or two in his life he lied you know but then of course he would have had to repent and make it right but he was blessed in everything he did he was a son of a prophet you know he was we have everything good about him and Jesus even said you'll sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob Hallelujah so that man was a a good man Hallelujah but then his son Esau as we looked at it uh he probably did you know his Jewish history says he probably did five evil things just in that one day when he sold out his Birthright but yet he was trained very similar to Jacob he could and he in church he could say I was trained by a prophet right Abraham Isaac Jacob prophets right the Patriarchs he could say my daddy was a prophet he raised me to be a prophet my daddy's a child of the promise he ain't no child of the Bond woman you know he could have said all these great things is because es remember Jacob was loved by his mom Esau was loved by his dad well my a prophet loves me that don't mean nothing right didn't Jesus love the Rich Young Ruler yet the Rich Young Jesus the Bible said Jesus looked at him and loved him he kept all those Commandments but he wasn't willing to give up the money right he wasn't willing to sell out when Jesus asked him to sell out and become an apostle become a missionary so we see here you know we're given uh a probability if you train up the children when they're older they won't depart from it but we know it's probability know each person has a different uh Destiny based upon their desires and God pre designates based upon that desire because God can't force somebody to go to hell I just read it this week in in Ezekiel the Bible said Satan is the god of force and brother random repeats that in the church age book Satan forces people Satan puts all that pressure on them right Satan's a god of force but God God just offers just like he did in the Garden of Eden here's the Tree of Life here's the tree of knowledge and evil you make your choice and even told him what to do he even told Cain do this be like your brother don't do that but because of the love of evil and because of the love of of of of of sin Cain still disobeyed the word of God but may God help us to obey the word of God to be real children of God hallelujah so you can have training as a child and can be good and people can still fall away right how many people do we know around the message that were trained right but then fell away from the truth they they've taught all these things Naomi knows them right I people that Chris and I knew and came in the message they Fallen away and they they knew it they knew all the truth this whole time and yet still fall away you know we had numerous friends my wife and I that they were raised in the message and everybody thought they were all holy but then they went out and you know lived immorally and had children out of wedlock yet they were taught their whole lives about these things now thankfully a couple of them come back and repent and serve God and they don't marry again and they just they just rais that child that's a that's a real sincere person but the person knew it the whole time I mean they were trained the right way and God will still let them go go because God's not going to force you to do it you've got to want it you got to have a greater love for God than we have for the world Hallelujah so as a Christian family we do our best to train them to show them this is how you do it this is how you uh study the Bible this is how you pray this is how you repent and that's why I thank God for a wonderful wife like my wife you know when I'm at school working she can teach them how to repent she can teach them how to live live right and Lydia Malachi and Nia said amen all right praise God Mom has those good conversations right many times my wife has told me and it's true as a mom you know she might be busy with you know homeschool or some other things might be right in the middle of something but if somebody there's a problem she's got to stop that and she's got to talk it out explain this is why this is wrong and this is the punishment right and that's what a Godly mom does that's what a Godly father does right the training you got to have the train training there Hallelujah and so the Christian family is one of training I can say like this I know our children our our church we're training our children to go to church as more as we see that day approaching right Hallelujah and we should also be training them at home you know to study the word of God to pray every day to sing and worship every day of their lives Hallelujah that's the training that they need and model that before them Hallelujah now also another important point and this is you know just relating to my experience you know last time I shared a little bit about my at the end of the sermon I shared a little bit about my childhood growing up um but this is one thing that um you know Eli got in trouble for and I've said this before he he might have train them but he didn't restrain his sons so 1st Samuel 3:13 I just want you to see what a what a strict severe uh consequence God put on Eli first Samuel 313 you know the more responsibility you have with God the more accountable you are James says that preachers will be the most accountable so I really got to watch my life I want my wife to watch my life I want my children to W watch my life I want the church to watch my life because if anybody's going to be judged harshly it's going to be me because I'm the one preaching the word of God I'm either giving you a key to enter in or like the Pharisees I'm keeping you out I hope God's grace you've seen the key I'm trying to help you to open up Hallelujah open up the door open up the Jesus is the door Hallelujah I'm trying to show you as as i' as God has sh me doors to open and and victories to win and areas you can conquer and overcome I'm trying to show you here's the keys to do it the keys is the knowledge the Bible Jesus said the key of knowledge and knowledge of the word of God hallelujah like I prayed on Sunday I was trying to show everybody here just Again by rehearsal through fasting in prayer you can undo every heavy burden you don't have to leave here with burdens I'm trying to show you that's the key fast right and I'm we're going to hopefully close at that at then you know you can loose every band of wickedness you don't have to leave here feeling like you got a A Band of wickedness you can be free from that praise God Amen through confession repentance and then fasting and seeking God you can be free God gave us the keys of Isaiah 586 hallelujah amen and that's why we preach that that's why we believe that I'm sure brother Rod's church is he's gone to believe in Deliverance Ministries amen we even Believers got to be delivered sometimes Hallelujah but we got to want to be delivered Hallelujah remember the Bible Paul said that you know Satan takes people captive by his own will but the Bible says we're to go to those people and in meekness instruct them that they might recover themselves out of the Trap of the enemy see they've got to want they've got to acknowledge what God is they got to acknowledge the word of God and then they'll get free from their bands of captivity but the individual has to want to be free hallelujah amen now here was the awful sin of Eli now it seems like Eli was saved you know God did use him in some Supernatural ways remember he's the one that looked at Hannah and said the Lord has heard your prayer and she had a Samuel that's quite a thing to say telling a woman who's never had a child before other words the Lord heard you thus sayith the Lord you're going to have a child that's the thing to say hallelujah so and he he had a heart he had a heart for the ark now look at that you can be spiritual you can speak the word of God you can have a when he heard the ark was taken it so made him so sad you know he was overweight but he lost his bounds threw his head back hit his head and died he was he had some compassion for God but he didn't have enough desire to keep his his children cleaned out he didn't have enough desire for God's word to apply it to his children and the God said you honored your children your sons more than you honored me see you can have a tender heart for brother brandham or John Wesley or Charles finny like brother rod and I want to go see his grave but any man of God that you admire any saint you can have a tender heart for them but the main thing is apply it to your family Hallelujah apply what we know to our house Hallelujah that's kind of what I want to get to at the end it's a sin to just hear the word and not do anything about it it's a sin that's why every sermon is important especially when you see it's timely like you weren't expecting to hear that and God just shook you and he spoke that's God that ain't brother so- and so that ain't brother it's God like I told you that one time Simon preaching I I texted him nine things you just discern my life in nine things I've never had a sermon like that nine secrets of my heart nine things I've already studied nine things I was praying about nine things I went through I said that's god brother Hallelujah never had that before because Jesus is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of our hearts Hallelujah and it won't push you to to sin and recklessness it'll push you to humility and repentance Hallelujah it'll bring you closer to God but here's the sin the awful sin of Eli for I've told him that I will judge his house forever now look look at the responsibility he was a priest the high priest if I'm not mistaken for the iniquity which he knoweth because he made because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not he had the authority to take them out of the positions of power and he didn't do it that's why I've always said if any of my children disobey God and they're in any positions I've got to remove them God forbid right but you also got the authority if I get out of line you got to remove me and the church said right I I can I can have the authority too I can I can kick people out of church too Bible said get that leaven out from among you there's a way to do it yes go to them one1 then take somebody else yes there's a way to do it Matthew 18 but in other words we're all accountable for each other now let's hope that never happens by God's grace right let's live All Pure before god let's live holy Hallelujah let we overcome our trials by God's grace one step at a time Hallelujah but the Bible said that that he honored I'm sorry he restrained he failed I'm sorry he re failed to restrain and then look how the Judgment lasted it was forever now it actually the Judgment didn't actually happen to the days of Solomon so look how merciful god was it was Generations later and then Solomon finally ended that lineage of Eli it's quite a thing to see that he honored and I don't have the scripture there I didn't actually look find that one but I know the scripture says that he honored uh his sons more than God did anybody see that scripture just by chance if you saw it all right well I couldn't find it there but uh the Bible said God will honor all those who honor him amen hallelujah so now we can see we must train our children and I'll say like this train ourselves Hallelujah because the Bible said Paul said I beat my body I train my body and I bring it under subjection to the word of God and then as parents we must restrain our children now that's one thing I just want to lay this in you although my dad wasn't there I I can say one thing about my mom she did restrain my brothers and I and my sister my sister and I that's one thing she would do you made her mad she get out that baseball bat I told you about she get out that soap and sneak around put that soap in my mouth she get out that wooden spoon brother Austin and she started hitting me because I deserved it and you know sometimes I'll say just try to be real General when certain family members were staying out too late she would drive over to where they were and I don't care what time of night it was and honk on that car horn until they came out don't you know that was embarrassing sometimes but what was she doing restraining the wickedness now what if you had four teenage boys what kind of mom would you or Dad would you be they're running all over they don't love Jesus they they don't like going to church now three of them are preachers because she restrained them Hallelujah the best she could one woman without a without a husband there see God honors those who honor him praise God I just share that you know I like to share what I've seen just God do and again remember my mom every morning before we go to school we didn't want to we weren't like oh let's pray mom we're like come on Mom I got to get to class no we're praying she'd stand she would stand by the door guard the door like this we're praying I'd try to push back like come on I'm going to be late well that's cuz I slept in too long that's my fault and she stand there and say no let's pray and we would pray and boy I was many I was late many times in high school but it was my own fault but you better believe every time I got a prayer before I went to school and what did I see I saw the grace of God upon my life God he God hears the prayers of his humble servants that's right church so it's our duty to train ourselves and our our children and also restrain them if we see evil we need to restrain it like I've told my children if I catch them doing evil things on their phones and tablets I'm GNA take it away my wife catches it we can do that we got to restrain them right from Evil we got to do it I respected parents when I see them do that that's a very good thing to do whatever trouble they're in it's our duty as parents to restrain them all right and that's just a brief I just want to just rehearse that briefly because that's what the Christian family does a Christian family has rules and boundaries that shows the love of God hallelujah boundaries are the protection of God they're the love of God you stay Within These boundaries and I'll protect you pray praise God hallelujah now I want to look at a few things here um let's look at the positive first then we'll look at the negative so Hebrews 117 in case if you pull that up there whenever get a chance I like how you're taking notes there notes and the computer double duty bless your heart it's good training Hebrews 11:7 let's go at Noah just briefly by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet now see church if he got a warning about judgment AR don't you think we'll get a warning about judgment the Earth's coming under judgment as it was in the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the coming of the son of man he was warned judgment's coming so what does he do the warning should motivate us to action praise God we can see brother bam told us the United States is in Revelation 13: 11 to1 18 the Beast out of the out of the land is the United States of America she's got power to bring fire down from heaven that's the atomic bombs in 194 45 it's easily seen and the devil's going to use that Beast to lay down the mark eventually right it's prophecy right it's it's it's prophecy so we've been warned right and brother R told us thus sayith the Lord because it's the Beast United States would do the same acts upon Christians that Rome once did because it's the same spirit that dominating Spirit upon the Earth right Daniel saw the four parts of the the image like I we went over a few weeks ago and that's the spirit of Rome is in the United States of America trying to Lord over all right I mean there's so many parallels I've gone over them many times you know the the most education the most freedom of religion uh the greatest military but they're spreading their military out too much right see Noah was he was warned of God so if God loves you he gives you a warning Hallelujah he'll give your house a warning hallelujah thank God and what he do he moved with reverence for God so he reverently built that Ark he PR prepared an ark to the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith now everybody knows Noah could not have built that Ark all by himself it's just literally impossible if you don't believe that go down and see the ark there in Kentucky which we have not one man built that it was a team of Amish people built that right it wasn't just one man so Noah of course would have had his three sons and probably a bunch of other people helping him throughout the years now some say it was was 60 70 years some say 120 doesn't really matter he built it he kept the word of God so see what did he do once he got the warning it brought reverence for God and he prepared away he trained his family so they could be saved God didn't force any of them to go in they all had to go in by themselves by free moral agency praise God so but notice the family worked together the family stayed together the family was serving a purpose Hallelujah as for me in my house we'll serve the Lord we'll bu build an ark we'll be saved we'll obey the word of God hallelujah all the other world rest of the world can laugh at it they can take they can reject the warning they can do whatever we want but the Bible said he was a preacher of righteousness amen and he found Grace in the sight of the Lord hallelujah amen let's live righteously that's the part of the Holy Ghost Kingdom right peace righteousness Joy Hallelujah that's the kingdom of God on Earth and then because of that he became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith Hallelujah he inherited righteousness amen see they stayed together they labored together they worked together Hallelujah but one man motivated it all and so as husbands and fathers that's what we need to be the motivator the leader behind it Hallelujah keep and the way to do that is keep our lives clean first and then love our our wives right and then train our children restrain our children if need be Hallelujah so see the family must labor together stay together and it's like that spouse we looked at in 1 Corinthians 7 where a a a believing spouse can sanctify her husband or vice versa a believing husband can sanctify his unbelieving wife see because the power the power of the believer moving by the movement of the Holy Spirit can create such an atmosphere now that's what Noah did he created such an atmosphere preach righteousness he told him thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah he put his a his faith to action and build a build a a house of protection and because of that the seven people followed him into the ark amen what a church of eight people amen I like that amen hallelujah we start our church with seven so we're very similar to Noah Hallelujah glad we're more than that but just a just it's a simple type there how you know he lived it he put all his energy all of his efforts into it to save seven Souls you think it was worth it Church you know it was worth it when the people are knocking saying let us in let us in and they say we can't God shut the door Hallelujah it was worth it then hallelujah all the labor all the all the mocking all the persecution all the aloneness and all the frustration all whatever it may be all the mocking the teasing it was all worth it then because they moved according according to the word of God hallelujah now what did she do now I'm sorry what did uh what did he do or what did these spouses do the Bible said you build your house by wisdom not by the greatest building materials because not of all of us can hardly afford it especially now with with the prices of wood someone said well they went down a little bit I know and we know that and they know that too but for us it's still like they're what four or five times the amount they were they're still thank God they're going a little bit but still extremely expensive go to Proverbs 9:1 so Noah he built the ark by the wisdom of God and that's how we must build our daily lives our our home life we only have a short time to do I think of Lydia is 19 I said 20 but it's 19 sorry L I didn't want to add a year to you I never want to do that with sisters Malachi 17 qua 15 right 14 ah 14 why always do it to the sisters forgive me but you know it seems so short like it went so fast where did all these years go I put Lydia's uh picture slideshow together for the graduation I'm like where did all these years go it's just like she went from a little one to now she's a growing up one I cried like where did all this time go why is it it go so fast my but what did we do we built a spiritual house for her to live in that's what we all must do wisdom hath builded her house and she hath heun out her Seven Pillars heun out chopped out and the Bible says the prophets chopped out the People by the word of God so that's that that's what the the symbol is in here you got to chop down the right pillars to build up your house other words you got to work if you want the pillar of Faith you got to BU you got to chop that out you got to put some effort into it some labor if you want worship if you want your children to love the Bible or love to sing you got to work on that you got to heue that out Hallelujah you got to set up that pillar amen that's how wisdom does it it cuts it out in other words I'm GNA cut time out of my schedule to make sure we worship God hallelujah I'm gonna make time for God hallelujah that's what wisdom does know had to make time to go cut out the pillars right the foundation of the Ark you to make time for that you got to cut it out Hue hued out Seven Pillars seven Church ages seven attributes hallelujah amen Seven Seals amen seven Thunders hallelujah amen seven the complete number she hath mingled her Beast so now we're getting into sacrifices sheath mingled her wine that's stimulation The Joy sheath also furnished her table the Feast of the word of God she hath sent forth her maiden she crith upon the highest place of the city who so simple that now that means humble who so is humble let him turn in hither as for him that WTH understanding she said to him come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which I have mled come to church hear the word of God hallelujah come hear it forsake the foolish don't live like them leave them behind they're not your real friends Hallelujah live the truth believe the word of God follow the word hallelujah and live and go in the way of understanding he that reproveth a scorner GTH to himself shame and he that rebuke a wicked man GTH himself a blot reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee that's what I was saying on Sunday right or anytime if you rebuke somebody and they really love God they'll say thank you it might burn their hide but they'll say thank you they're not going to get upset at you now they might inside but if the Bible says if you rebuke a wise man he'll love you Hallelujah scriptures give instruction to the wise man and he will be yet wiser teach him just man and he will increase in learning that's right the fear of the Lord is beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased Chris and I have seen our some high school friends die of drug use early I mean she's 41 I'm 43 I mean where see they didn't get the long life because they didn't take heed to the word of God now I know the Bible says some men's sins go before them and some are hidden till later and I know it's probability but they're just clear plain examples verse 12 if thou be wise Thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear Hallelujah so see we see this here if we want the wise life if we want a home that really glorifies God it must be h out it must be cut out right we must uh we must make it happen in other words Hallelujah we must surrender to the Holy Spirit we must do what the Lord says hallelujah amen now what what I find in America and I want to shift gears a little bit here what we find in America is the prosperity trap because that is the the temptation of today notice in the first six Church churches in Revelation 2 and 3 it don't say anything about riches but then that final Church it speaks of riches let's go to Revelation 3:17 and I believe those those have three applications they apply directly to those seven churches back there around 100 AD they apply to the individual in other words you and I know what it's like we need our first love back sometimes and then it also applies prophetically to the Future Church ages because Paul said there would be ages there was past ages there's future ages there will always be ages Hallelujah that's not skim milk Hallelujah Revelation 3:17 this is a trap we got to be very careful not to fall into a trap of uh Prosperity because thou sayest I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that's time tested Faith according to Peter that thou mayest be rich so spiritual riches and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isow that thou mayest see amen hallelujah see I can't help but I'm not amen myself I'm Amen in the word of God hallelujah I just can't I've always been that way amen Hallelujah just love the word of God but notice riches increase with goods and we got to be careful in this culture in this uh Financial condition if we increase our riches and goods we must always still have a great hunger for God if Abraham did it if David could do it we can do it praise God and they didn't even have the Holy Ghost amen I say this if Lydia could do it we could do it because Lydia was rich with purple Hallelujah that's right amen if God could turn a rich woman's heart God can turn our hearts back amen of course they are but I'm saying is keep our hearts pure that's what I'm saying keep our hearts clean Hallelujah keep our hearts hungering after God remember brother said what's the pressur of this day soft living riches and nervous tensions how many fell all three this week you don't have to raise your hand I did right oh I want remember one time I'm I'm G to laugh around with brother digs about this remember brother digs said oh you're going to be a millionaire I'm like there's no way I'll Be A Millionaire I appreciate your love for me brother but I'm going to joke around with them about that there's no way unless God pour something out Mercy impossible and but you know we get those Temptations you know we hear podcasts or things you know Austin I talk about podc how we can have a side income a side hustle and but we're tempted by those riches and soft living right just make your life easier easier easier but church it's okay to have some nice things but is your spiritual connection with God is it still strong what I mean is you might have a softer bed right but are you sleeping in and not praying enough everyone understand what I'm saying soft living right you might have a microwave and you know the food gets done faster but what are you doing with your free time you know are you we got laundry you know we got washers we got a PR level washer because we got eight kids you know boy we sure needed it too you know that gives us more time but what are we spending with the rest of our our time rich and increased with Goods I don't need more of God every one of us should say I need more of God hallelujah and brother R said brother R tells us what does and he used uh the history writers brother Rod like men like finny he said what does on fire look like he said it's a fervent desire to please God and he got this from some of the other preachers he listed some of them like Albert Barnes and uh John Gil a fervent desire to please God a passion to know his word means you really like hearing the preaching and third you reach out in the Holy Spirit asking God to do things amen I love that hallelujah how do you know you're on fire you're doing those three things Amen in other words I got a fervent desire to please him I'm not going to allow sin to ruin my day hallelujah or my week or my month or my year amen or my life hallelujah amen I've got a fervent desire to please God I've got a passion to know his word I want to get in the Deep things of God we just heard uh what former it was Franklin delanor Roosevelt we we're reading through this book about the founding fathers of America boy they talked a big game I don't know how much they lived it but some of them lived it some of them didn't you know but FR Franklin Delo Roosevelt said he said everything good in life is in the Bible he said if you want to be entertained you want some excitement read the Bible he said if you want to be smarter uh knowledge and science read the Bible he said you want to hear good stories read the Bible every single thing everything that you could possibly want whether it's entertainment or or or knowledge or wisdom he said get in the Bible Hallelujah one of the first first acts of Congress I'm sorry the first book Congress uh printed in America was the Bible amen God bless you sir love you buddy my precious brother I do that to all of you if you were late you know so well the brothers now Glory but every you know think think the devil has all these things that try to take us away just from the simp Simplicity of enjoying the word of God it's laying here with all these ammunition all this ammunition we say a sword all these wonderful blessings are laying right here and it's the enemy's job to give us so much Prosperity that we forget about the needful thing I have need of the word I have a great need of that it's always Pride right the B and brother bam uses Uzziah as the example he was a tremendous King until the very end he had great inventions brother you know he had battle inventions and he was whipping Every Nation he was a man he was known around the whole Known World until the very end the Bible said I I still believe he was saved it's looks like he was saved he just got off at the end just like David and Solomon and some of the other ones now David wasn't as bad as Solomon he said but when he was strong in 2 Chronicles 2616 when he was strong his heart was lifted up in to his Destruction for he transgressed against the the Lord is God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense pride and what do we battle lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life that's why Jesus could understand every Temptation man or woman because it's in all three areas brother raham said he talks about this he talks about Uzziah he said uh he said Uzziah got lifted up he said so many today you take a family of people will start going to church and God will heal the little family he'll bless them and give them the holy spirit in their life the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed mother and father will join hands and pray and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family now I've told you some testimonies of families giving up the family prayer time I'm not rebuking anybody that's what these people told me I love all these people love all the people that tell me things but I share with you to give you a warning because I love you and I've got to apply that warning to my life too well R said if you do that you'll stay a family he says but you let the first thing you know they didn't have nothing an old junk car maybe riding around or maybe walking anybody got a junk car you don't got to say amen he said finally they'll get a good car A Better Home and the first thing you know they want to get what they do the world calls a better class say so associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in there they find out they become influenced by the wrong people now I know a lot of good Christians that move into a good neighborhood but they don't get influenced by the neighbors that's what we did we left akaran you know I mean a has some good parts don't get me wrong but the parts we were in not so great especially when we first got married but we didn't let our neighbors influence us we try to influence the neighbors right just like Daniel Amen Daniel was right there in the midst of Babylon and he wouldn't let them influence him he was going to pray every day hallelujah amen what was going to eat their their sinful diet he was going to keep the word of God and God visited him hallelujah amen you must he says You must always stay where the kingdom of God is being poured out where the glory of God is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night and the first thing you know he said but the first thing you know separation come comes in the home worldliness and they get lifted up in Pride okay so just some simple reminders here remember wisdom has to cut out you got to cut out the pillars of your life it's going to take some effort diligence is the Bible word right the Bible even says in Hebrews labor to enter into the promise got to cut down some pillars Hallelujah so Al every everybody tonight you're going to go home and you can cut out make sure you have a little prayer time before you go home maybe say a prayer before you go to bed maybe read your read a chapter listen to a chapter on the way home do something but make sure you make sure that pillar is in its right position if you haven't cut that out cut it out set it up so you got that pillar set up and then the house can stand amen hallelujah Glory but it's a Prosperity trap many times of course in leoa but this was all through the Bible get your Bibles ready let's do some uh quick reading here Deuteronomy 8:11 God warned them ahead of time and they still fell into it of course it wasn't the that generation it was later generations beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God and keeping his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I command thee this day lest when thou has eaten and art full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when thy herds and thy flocks m multiply thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied and all that thou Hast is Multiplied look everything God blesses every are of their life and you would think my they stand back and say thank God but instead Israel forgot about God after God blessed them with all this they forgot about him verse 14 then their heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage amen who led thee through the great and terrible Wilderness wherein were fiery serpents scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of Flint my they got so much blessing so much Prosperity they forgot about the serpents the Scorpions the drought the hunger Church never forget where you came from Hallelujah I'm looking at you buddy CU you and I got a similar thing testimony don't forget where you came from Hallelujah I purposely bought a sign that says I still remember the days I prayed for what I have now I saw that online when I was on Facebook I'm like I'm buying that cuz I remember I never thought I'd have a happy home never thought I'd have a garage I never thought I'd have a garage that's how poor we were growing up and that's why I bought that I prayed for all these things or how about a new kitchen I never thought I'd have a renovated kitchen I'm like how how am I going to afford that I don't have enough money for that how am I going to do that well God knows what we pray Hallelujah God hears our prayers amen but that's not an occasion to forget about God we must remember where we came from we must remember the testimonies we must continue to bless God and call on his name not get lifted up but get humbled before God that's what that's what fasting does humbles us the Bible said it afflicts your soul got to be very careful for the prosperity trap brother Braham said it numerous times now it's not absolute for everybody but it's just a good thing brother Braham said as soon as a church will build a great big church then they'll get real they'll get real LAX on God because they got this fine Church everything's fine and dandy look what we got look what we got and they forget about the main thing they forget about building the spiritual house they're so interested in the natural house they forget about the spiritual house now can it be done sure it can be done if if Solon did it at the beginning well that people could do it in the New Testament too Hallelujah uh let's say in the Old Testament there Nehemiah 9:25 and 26 9:25 and I found all these just by flipping through my Bible remember I'm transferring all my notes into my newer Bible is that home Nehemiah 92526 and they took strong cities in a fat land and possessed Houses full of all Goods Wells dig Vineyards and Olive yards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness see God shares his goodness with us but he doesn't want us to forget where it came came from remember Ecclesiastes said it's a gift of God but don't let a gift of God get your eyes off The Giver of the gift amen nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations so the very God that sent them prophets and all these things they turned their back on the word of God after they had all these blessings blings what a shame Hallelujah uh Jeremiah 5:27 so I just made it I'm almost at the end of Ezekiel I'm started in Genesis I'm almost to the New Testament here transferring all these good notes over Jeremiah 5:27 as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of Deceit wherefore they become great and wax and Rich they're waxing fat they shine yay they overpass the Deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they Prosper right David was upset with this one time how why did the wicked prosper and he said I wondered about it until I went to the house of God and God showed me their end right God showed me the end of their life their despair at their death or he also showed them where they'll end up in Hades the regions of the lost the regions of the the prison house and the right of the needy do they not judge shall I not visit for these things sayith the Lord shall not my soul be Avenged on such a nation as this a again all these great blessings all these great blessings but they don't apply the wisdom of God to their daily life Hallelujah I seen it this week or you know I talking to this guy at taekwon do practice and he he's building a new house his dream house he's in his 60s and one company did him wrong and you know he's got he he's got the the proof he could sue them he's got that you know he's got he's got that option but I said brother I said pray about it first before you send that letter c that certified letter I said send the right certified letter send a send a certified prayer up to God before you do that right I mean so rich and so so much power to do these things and the Bible said Christians shouldn't even do things like that right taking people to court and everything like that my it's just it doesn't fit the character of God they become great and wax and Rich and they're they're so uh encompassed with the cares of this world now personally I think it might have been a mistake to build that dream house personally right that's just I don't know you know what's going to happen I mean you might live five more years you get to Joy for 5 years 10 years what could have been done want that money for the kingdom of God you know I don't know it just I just things you wonder you know was God in that you have to seek God for each one right Jeremiah 44:17 but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense under the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers and our Kings and our princes in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem for then they had plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evil so see when they had plenty of food and everything was good they saw no evil that's when they were LED astray into idolatry right in church I've showed this before which church in the message is the most idolatrous brandom Tabernacle who's got all the money brandom Tabernacle hundred over hundred million dollars right and they idolized brother R they idolized tapes doesn't seem famili may do that seem premor right just because some people got a lot of money a lot of fing that don't mean they're right with God right it don't mean nothing right and many times that's when they start falling away when they get so much such money such influence like we've seen a lot of these 24 false doctrines that's just what I found they started coming out after they've got all this money it wasn't when they were small come on Church they just they were just they were just encouraging the preacher to to give give people tapes well then when they got big now they start pushing their agenda you don't need the preachers you just need one voice I tell you you need the voice of Christ through the bride amen because the spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah the bride has a voice too Hallelujah you can see it Jeremiah 49:31 see I've been combing through Jeremiah and all these nuggets in here arise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without care sayith the Lord which have neither Gates nor bars which dwell alone then God's going to destroy them see they dwell without care no cares in the world except God's going to send in a surprise surprise chastening to them there no cares in the world everything's going fine everything's going good that's when God's going to bring correction right rich and increased with Goods have need of nothing it's the prosperity trap we've all got to be careful of that's right church that's right it say trap uh Jeremiah okay we did that one okay Ezekiel 1649 I'm trying to bring this down here Ezekiel 1649 I felt inspiration when I read these behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom Pride fullness of bread and abundance of ESS was in her and her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy so rich and and and and so blessed right so prosperous yet not even able to lift a finger to help the needy right see this and of course then all of course this chapter is about the two daughters uh I'm sorry the Two Sisters right that were Wicked before God Israel and Samaria and they had all this idolatry they forsook God idolatry again Idols in their lives something became more important than God all right so it's this Prosperity trap job said it too job 16:12 go put that up there Casa job said when I was at ease that's when the trial came ease he hath broken me aunder he had taken me by the neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his Mark but remember God's in heaven saying you're perfect job devil look at Job look at job but on Earth he needed correction he still needed to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord right as much as God was using him and blessing him he still needed a further revelation of God he was at ease remember the Bible said job said everything I feared Came Upon me so he was at he had fear battles right battle fear and then he was at ease everything was too loose and too easy so I my prayer say God keep me on my knees keep me humble before you keep me seeking your face wanting more of you Hallelujah and please keep the idols out of my life amen um let's do a couple more verses I probably have to save this for I'm not preaching Sunday next Wednesday by God's grace but let me do a couple more verses Hallelujah I thought I'd get the different some different verses here hallelujah all well uh Jeremiah 10:25 Jeremiah 10:25 this goes back to whatever you do as a family church do it together now wait maybe that's not the right verse let me see I'm reading that Jeremiah 10:25 did I write that down says pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that Know Thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name yes families that call not On th name for they have eaten up Jacob and devoured him and consumed him and made his habitation desolate see the family has to call upon the name of Christ each one of us even little children can call upon the name of Jesus Hallelujah we saw it last year and at least we Napoleon right I saw Haven calling upon the name of Jesus I saw AAA calling upon the name of Jesus right Hallelujah the families got a call but God I'm saying he says I'm bringing my wrath and fury on the families that do not call upon the name of God no one his family called upon the name of God and the other families that don't God brings wrath upon them so all of our families must call upon God so so so uh you know like even this week Lydia God let things come upon us so we'll call upon God hallelujah go through trials go through sufferings go through difficult situations why so it'll teach you to call upon God that's exactly right so it's you learn it as a family you go through it together as a family you overcome by the grace of God ah help me Jesus not sure how I should close this here by God's gra help me Lord um I want to I'll just close with two more verses and maybe I'll preach a full sermon on this next time um so brother Dennis took us to Isaiah 58 remember so let's go there I'll just briefly read this over let me just give a humble warning because I need them too Isaiah 58 1-6 and again I'm sharing this just you know from my heart I truly believe look at at brother Dennis's life he's on fire now if you're born again your Soul's on fire but if you're going through a trial your mind might not be on fire you might have complexes strongholds the Bible says but when I looked at him when I heard him preach brother amen I'm like that guy's on fire he's blasting out sin he's rebuking it it's a different sound Hallelujah cry aloud spare not verse one lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgressions and the house of Jacob their sins show them their sins yet they seek me daily look at this every day they seek God so church we got to go more Beyond just saying well I sought God today we got to make sure we got the sins out of our lives this is what I was so brother Dennis showed this to me while we were at Aladdin and they didn't have rock and roll on yeah they seek me daily and Delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God they ask of me the ordinance of Justice they take Delight in approaching God so every day they delight in God every day they enjoyed it right don't you think the Pharisees enjoyed some element of their worship don't you think the music was nice don't you think they had a good worship service I doubt they had bad music don't you think they don't you think they enjoyed lifting their hands sometimes and seeing the sunrise and looking at the temple and thinking wow God is so good don't you think don't you think they enjoyed part of that but yet when Jesus came and they blasphemed him Jesus said you're full of dead men's bones right and church they fasted twice a week see that proves and you know fasting is popular now TED Talks made it popular I saw it they got like 30 million views now everybody's fasting now and they're not even believers they ain't going to get the same benefit right A little exercise profit you little but they're not going to get the spiritual benefit of fasting the way God says to fast see so they got sin their lives yet they seek God every day and they have enjoy approaching God through prayer worship and sacrifice wherefore Hast we fasted say they and thou seest not so they felt like God wasn't hearing their prayers wherefore have we Afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure and exact all your labors now he's going to tell us why verse four behold you fast for strife and bait and to Smite with a fist of wickedness they were fasting in order to gain some type of uh victory over their enemies in a debate right for selfish reasons because they still had sin in their lives their motive was not to have the heart of God toward their their enemies but it was just to be right and overcome their enemies see that then when they were fasting they weren't saying God created me a clean heart they were saying God give me ammunition to strike down my enemy to win this debate or to win this argument or to make myself look like I'm right and yet they went to church every day they they saw they read their Bibles every day church this is amazing portion of scripture and to Smite with the fist of wickedness so they would hit the people that were righteous they'd hurt the righteous people this is why they fasted so they could find a way to hurt the people right with in a wicked way I'm going to preach on that eventually I'm going to preach on the the whole all the scriptures on uh slander and railers because I've been slandered a lot lately of course these last few years but especially these last few months I've been slandered and railed on and Paul said if you Rail and slander on people you will not inherit the kingdom of God and that's what they were fastened for to win a debate to Smite somebody to really knock them down and show them who is right ye shall not fast as you do this day to make your voice to be Heard On High see they wanted their their ideas their uh their argument to be heard verse five is this a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bull rush and to spread sackcloth and Ashes under him will thou call this a fast and acceptable day of the Lord God said is this why is this what I call a fast so you could just win an argument that God said no verse six is not this the fast that I have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness now what did Brother McBride say he was fasting for for his children not for himself for his children to serve God to get saved to get the Holy Ghost to marry the right person fasting for other people but see the the the Israel here the S they were fasting just for their own voice to be Heard On High make me exalted make me win something right make make me look like the great person but when you fast the right way it's fasting for other people but then if you do that like brother McBride said then you'll get some blessings for yourself you live for others God will bless you to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed Go free and ye that you break every yoke verse 7 deal bread to the hungry bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when th seest the naked cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh then shall thy light Break Forth as the morning and thy hell shall spring forth feely or speedily and thy righteousness shall go before Thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy real reward then Thou shalt call and the Lord shall answer Thou shalt cry and he shall say here am I if thou take away from the midst of Thee the Yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking Van Vanity look at verse 11 and the Lord shall guide thee continually it's like God blessed every decision in your life he guided me here he guided me there he's guided me everywhere amen hallelujah and satisfy thy soul in the drought isn't this a time of spiritual drought the Bible says that in Amos they'll run forth to and fro and it's a drought Hallelujah but God's people will have the word of God hallelujah and make thy bones fat and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose Waters fail not verse 14 then shalt thou Delight thyself in the Lord I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it so again I just I love how brother Dennis showed this to me the most religious people every day seeking God delighting to praise God and go to church and yet they had sin in their hearts and they were fastened for the wrong reason so they got the wrong results but if you fast the right way you get the right results now my last verse let's stand my last verse Ezekiel 37 Malachi can come 31 and 32 Ezekiel 3731 I read this this week and I was like oh my goodness what a beautiful verse Ezekiel 3731 and 32 Ezekiel 3731 and 32 wait no I'm sorry it's 33 sorry I got bad chicken scratched there Ezekiel 3331 and 32 sorry now why this applies to us churches because I hear myself preach right and I think about what I preach and I'll say something like this we've got to draw a night to God right we got to get closer to God but sometimes I just say that church and sometimes I don't do it like I ought to and if you're all honest you would say Amen but you don't have to I'll say amen amen right we talked about we talk about seeking God for the Rapture seeking God for gift seeking God for all these things now who's going to do it it's e it's so easy to say it but then who's going to do it and it goes back to the condition of the house are the pillars set up in the house so you can do that look at this verse look at these verses and they come unto thee as people cometh and they sit before thee as my people my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them like James says don't be just a hearer of the word be a doer of the word in other words if you heard the word of God tonight then have a passion to hear more of it have a fervent desire to please God and reach out in the Holy Spirit that's how you know you're on fire amen hallelujah do it for with they with their mouth they show much love oh God's so good we're the bride we got the Holy Ghost that's I'm talking about things I say I'm not I'm not saying you I'm me me I say all these things as a Preacher Brother Austin but if I don't do it it don't do me no good and I can become cold on God too I can go through difficult Seasons right we say all we we sing brother amen can put all the right songs up there I'm I'm a Child of God yes I am you know I'll see you in the rapture we we see all the with with our mouth we show all this love to God but are we doing what the word of God tells us to do but their heart goeth after their covetousness now let me let me just be honest if I've got something I need let's say uh what do I order recently on Amazon I just need something like for the house on Amazon and let's say I think of that in the morning church I could be tempted well I better get this on Amazon because my family needs this tempt to do that rather than pray or maybe it's I need a new something for my computer like a a mouse or something right what does our heart go after but I got but just but just you have other Mouse you don't actually have to you don't have to have a mouse I'm not saying I do that but I'm just trying to think of an example I've been tempted to do that right see with our mouth we show all this love to God but then when it comes down to it what are we really doing hallelujah what are we following after this a real good striking cutting message here tonight I didn't I didn't Envision this brother amen I this is not the way I picture this sermon not at all just kind of came out that way because I'm just trying to be honest I'm trying to look at these scriptures as I've been reading through these here and but brother Dennis is sharing with us there's a reason God had us to hear these sermons verse 32 and lo Thou Art unto them as a lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not oh it sounds so lovely oh the singing and doesn't that remind you of Isaiah 58 daily they seek me daily they Delight approaching unto me they even fast but it's all for the wrong reasons so see you have people like Leo deia I don't have need of nothing I never seek God well that's probably not you and I right we'll at least read our Bible pray we'll listen to a sermon or something something that's not us this is something that would be more easily to tempt us where we might struggle and the church said I like to hear good amen at the end Hallelujah that sermon was not in vain Hallelujah somebody's going to be blessed tonight Hallelujah let's bow our heads here tonight Hallelujah this really struck my heart I read that this week and I wrote down my people he but they will not do with our mouths we show we show so much love but we're Covetous at times I said God be merciful to me I want to be a man that if I speak all this love for God I'm going to back it up with my life how many raise their hand say Lord let that be my life too my my hands are up let's pray to together play Lord I need you every hour I need you Lord I come I confess Heavenly Father Lord we're looking at the family tonight Lord God and Father you know how you show me these verses dear God I wasn't even looking for these dear God and in those early morning hours God as I'm turning those pages and reading these holy words these scriptures strike my heart and I can see how we're living in leoda and Lord we have prosperous things Lord we we get better everything Lord God all the time but Lord what you want us is prosperity for the soul is what you want us to have I would that thy Health Prosper as our souls Prosper Lord I believe you sent brother McBride to this church to preach that Lord God and I I was fasting I think when I met with him before we actually ate that morning Lord I felt your presence in that restaurant Lord God I know Lord we just need reminders from time to time so thank you for this reminder here tonight Lord God that Lord we need a fervent desire to please you a passion to know the word and a reaching out in the holy spirit that we need to cut out pillars stabilizers and set them up in our lives this is what's going to keep us stable Hallelujah this is going to keep my house standing Hallelujah train me Lord God train me if I'm an adult train me if we have children God use us to train our children dear God that we might train them and restrain them for the glory of God lord as as Paul said oh Wretched Man that I Am Lord there's many days I can say that I felt like Paul Lord I can be ashamed of myself at times dear God lord may your praises and these these words of worship may

we surrender to the leadership of the holy spirit in every area of Our Lives God may we cut out that pillar of time that pillar of Fellowship that pillar of prayer pillar of Bible reading that pillar
