[39:01] whatever you require Lord that's what
[39:03] we'll do
[39:05] amen praise God let's take your Bibles
[39:07] let's go to Colossians chapter 1 as I
[39:09] said on Sunday I like to preach on
[39:11] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[39:12] and I just kind of felt led strangely I
[39:15] just kind of felt led to go there let's
[39:17] go to caution chapter 1 we preaching out
[39:19] of there tonight by the grace of the
[39:21] Lord you know this is such an important
[39:27] message you know there's so many
[39:31] important quotes you know that that
[39:33] preachers get I'm sure that you've heard
[39:35] and that you enjoy from this series by
[39:37] God's grace so I'm sorry this for our
[39:40] sermon by the man preached for our
[39:43] sermon and it's so critical and so I
[39:46] just want to kind of go slowly through
[39:47] this I just kind of felt burdened here
[39:49] to go through this with you I've done
[39:53] this before you know
[39:54] I think I preached three or four
[39:56] messages on spoken words the original
[39:58] seed a few years back and numerous
[40:01] series you know we just gone slowly
[40:03] through different series we preach the
[40:05] old church age book you know we know
[40:06] that it's good you know I found in
[40:10] church I found it's good to men
[40:12] take on something when you just go
[40:13] slowly through it you meditate upon it
[40:15] and it really renews your strength
[40:17] praise God how many can be a witness to
[40:19] that you just meditate on something it
[40:21] really becomes a reality and it's such a
[40:23] tremendous blessing here to meditate
[40:26] upon these things so Colossians chapter
[40:29] 1 by the grace of the Lord let's read oh
[40:51] there's such a caution is one of such a
[40:53] tremendous chapter let's just go to
[40:57] verse 12 and then worry down to 18 12 to
[41:03] 18 verse 12 giving thanks unto the
[41:15] father which hath made us meet to be
[41:16] partakers of the inheritance of the
[41:18] Saints in light let's read 13 together
[41:20] ready 1 2 3
[41:22] who had delivered us from the power of
[41:24] darkness and hath translated us into the
[41:27] kingdom of his dear son now I'll read
[41:30] I'll read 15 16 17 and will read 18
[41:33] together who is the image of the
[41:34] invisible God the firstborn of every
[41:36] creature for by him we're all things
[41:39] created that are in heaven and that are
[41:41] on earth visible and invisible whether
[41:43] they be Thrones their dominions or
[41:45] principalities or powers all things were
[41:48] created by him and for him and he is
[41:52] before all things and by him all things
[41:55] consist
[41:56] let's read 18 together 1 2 3 and he is
[42:00] the head of the body the church who is
[42:02] the beginning the firstborn from the
[42:05] dead that in all things he might have
[42:07] the preeminence amen he's before all
[42:10] things all things consist or continued
[42:14] because of him amen and you know the
[42:16] what what you know what the one thing he
[42:18] wants is he wants me first in your life
[42:20] that's what this message is all about so
[42:23] let's just bow our heads if you have a
[42:24] need on your heart just make it known
[42:25] to God as we try to preach this again
[42:28] Heavenly Father thank you Lord for your
[42:30] mercy Lord we're going the distance
[42:32] tonight Lord God we've set aside
[42:33] everything else and we gather in your
[42:36] house to worship you this House of
[42:37] Prayer this house of reaching this house
[42:40] of love this house of light this house
[42:42] of hope Lord God this is your house come

[42:47] presence O God and be magnified amongst
[42:49] your people bless us Lord as we read
[42:52] your word and preach these things Lord
[42:53] God no doubt it might be review to some
[42:55] a Lord just Lord refresh it to our
[42:58] hearts Lord God Lord you bring out of
[43:00] your treasures both things new and old
[43:02] so I pray you do that tonight I receive
[43:04] all the glory in Jesus Christ name the
[43:07] Saint said Amen god bless yous being
[43:09] seated praise the Lord how many have
[43:24] listened to this lately is anyone
[43:26] listening to Christ the mystery God
[43:27] revealed lately all right well good is
[43:30] gonna be a fresh then for everybody
[43:31] praise the Lord it's been fresh to me it
[43:34] been a while since I listened to it and
[43:36] I'm still not even done you know I'm
[43:38] just been going real slow to kind of
[43:40] take everything real slow it's one of
[43:43] the most well well known and well quoted
[43:45] sermons and tonight I think we'll see
[43:47] why because I'm just going to be able to
[43:49] hit the highlights of it
[43:53] you know it's a four-hour recording
[43:55] program starts with a baby dedication at
[43:58] 28 minutes though so about a half hour
[44:00] into it he still has not taken his text
[44:02] yet and then about 28 minutes he starts
[44:06] the word to the church I remember the
[44:08] word to the church I want to read that
[44:10] again because it kind of ties in with
[44:13] you know what we preach on recently with
[44:16] the Ephesian Church age let me just make
[44:18] sure okay everything is good to go all
[44:20] right
[44:21] well Graham said I want you to remember
[44:23] that brother Neville here in left in the
[44:25] church in the charge of this Tabernacle
[44:28] under the Holy Spirit that he is left
[44:31] here and he believes the message and
[44:33] teaches it just the same as I do
[44:38] and anytime that you'd want to you can
[44:41] see fit to come here brother Nevel he
[44:43] certainly would do you good I'm sure
[44:44] he's a great servant of Jesus Christ so
[44:48] I just want you to notice every brother
[44:50] Ram said brother Nevel and him were on
[44:53] the same page a hundred percent they
[44:55] believed the message the same way now I
[44:57] want to say that because the last time I
[44:59] preached on the Ephesian Church age I'm
[45:00] sorry the book of Ephesians we talked
[45:03] about how the move in Jeffersonville
[45:05] today is to take pastors out of the
[45:07] pulpit but when brother Branham was here
[45:10] he left brother Neville in charge of
[45:13] preaching to the people and it was not
[45:15] playing a tape it was preaching live
[45:17] sermons and he believed the same thing
[45:20] brother Brandon did they would no other
[45:22] words we'd say they're there they're
[45:24] preaching dovetail together and he was
[45:27] under charge by the Holy Spirit so the
[45:30] Holy Spirit was leading brother Neville
[45:31] to preach every service program says
[45:34] I've known Ormond Neville since I was a
[45:36] little boy and he hasn't changed one
[45:38] speck only got closer to God how many
[45:41] would like someone to say that about you
[45:43] you haven't changed except the only way
[45:46] you've changed now you're more like
[45:47] Jesus amen hallelujah brother Branham
[45:51] said he was invited to it brother
[45:53] Neville's Methodist platform and when he
[45:56] came back after preaching a brother
[45:57] Neville's Methodist Church he said
[46:00] someday I'll baptize him in the name of
[46:03] Jesus Christ and here he is with a
[46:06] message now a real gallant servant he
[46:10] says and brother Neville goes through
[46:11] many strains and heartaches he doesn't
[46:14] show it here at the Tabernacle but being
[46:17] that the Lord let's me have a little
[46:18] sight into people's life I know what he
[46:20] goes through a lot of it see and he
[46:23] certainly goes under a lot of labor and
[46:25] strains and things and you people here
[46:26] hold him up like Joshua and Caleb
[46:29] held up the hands of Moses as he's
[46:32] bringing the word amen
[46:34] that's what I'd like you to do hold me
[46:36] up in prayer whoever comes there brother
[46:38] Bednar on hold him up in prayer keep all
[46:40] the services in prayer pray for
[46:42] everybody that's your duty to hold up
[46:44] the preacher's hands amen we cannot have
[46:47] any success in our services unless
[46:49] everybody's praying everybody's bringing
[46:51] oyel praise the god we preach on that
[46:53] that's the only way we'll have good
[46:55] services if everybody's doing their part
[46:58] praying asking God to bless us in his
[47:00] presence amen
[47:02] and it was actually a member was Joshua
[47:04] and her not Joshua and Caleb but just
[47:07] those you know who know your Bible
[47:08] brother BAM said take everything back to
[47:10] the word right so just to show that
[47:13] brother Rams a man now brianna hears the
[47:16] word to the church and I've seen I've
[47:17] walked in pastors offices and they have
[47:19] this whole thing on a plaque hanging up
[47:21] in their office but man says love one
[47:23] another above everything we love one
[47:26] another no matter what the devil tries
[47:28] to say now you're all one great sweet
[47:30] group now but remember my warning
[47:32] Satan won't let you stay that way no sir
[47:38] he'll shoot he'll shoot everything if he
[47:41] has to bring somebody in to make his
[47:44] target so if we least say if all of us
[47:46] say pure Satan can't shoot us with a
[47:49] dart right so he'll have to send
[47:51] somebody in that he can zyou with the
[47:53] dart and caused him to fellowship with
[47:56] you under the quietness and things and
[47:58] then I'll shoot that guy with some comic
[48:00] kind of a poison stuff and it'll start
[48:02] through the church with it don't take
[48:04] sides with it don't have nothing to do
[48:06] with anything else you stayed right
[48:08] loving and sweet and kind of one another
[48:10] pray for that man that he'll be saved or
[48:12] that woman whoever it is just pray for
[48:14] them and stick with another he says
[48:18] praise God and stay with your pastor
[48:22] he's the Shepherd I like this quote and
[48:25] you give him respects which you do you
[48:28] all do he'll lead you through because
[48:31] he's ordained of God to do so now I do
[48:35] remember that he says the enemy will
[48:36] come he says and when he does just
[48:38] cleaning that much closer together and
[48:40] the one that the devil is using fer to
[48:43] enemy will either get out or come in and
[48:46] be one of you that's all hey man I like
[48:50] that praise God November let me just
[48:53] tell you that story that brother Simon
[48:55] told there was a message pastor down in
[48:58] North Carolina somebody came in the
[49:00] message said he believed all the message
[49:02] he got baptized he hung around for a few
[49:03] years and then he was
[49:05] riding in the car he started being the
[49:06] buddy of the pastor he was riding in the
[49:09] car and the the buddy was telling the
[49:11] past you know you need to change this
[49:12] you should stop doing this stop saying
[49:14] the name brother branham stop doing
[49:16] these things top you know stop having
[49:18] the prayer meetings and all these things
[49:19] like that which we have prayer meetings
[49:20] every service everybody's welcome to
[49:22] come before the prayer meetings
[49:23] half-hour before every service we still
[49:25] have prayer meetings just so you know
[49:27] but the the man was telling the pastor
[49:31] to do this and this is a pastor that was
[49:33] raised in Branham tabernacle new brother
[49:35] Branham and the Holy Spirit said this
[49:38] man's a Jesuit to the pastor and the
[49:40] pastor said are you a Jesuit and he said
[49:42] let me out of the vehicle and this is a
[49:44] pastor that's told me this story face to
[49:46] face and he said so he let him out and
[49:49] then he just drove away you don't know
[49:50] what would ever happen to the man but
[49:52] that's a good example of somebody that
[49:54] comes in the church and acts like
[49:56] everybody else he act like he believed
[49:58] the message but see because no one in
[50:01] the church would take a live spirit
[50:03] Satan had to send somebody in with a
[50:06] lying spirit and then had to inject him
[50:08] with a little seed of discrepancy I like
[50:11] that I like how the man stayed true to
[50:14] what he believed he stayed true to the
[50:16] message and then pretty soon that person
[50:18] either get converted or that person will
[50:20] leave by God's grace amen and so the
[50:23] same thing is true for us I think we've
[50:25] seen it in the last you know we of
[50:27] course as a pastor I've seen it for the
[50:29] last 12 years but people will come in
[50:31] they'll either be a part of us and stay
[50:33] and stay true to God or God will take
[50:36] them out and that's what we want we
[50:39] don't want any leaven in our lump
[50:41] we only want unleavened bread here
[50:43] praise God and so what we've got to do
[50:46] is in the hard time so you've just got a
[50:47] clean closer together don't take sides
[50:49] with anybody just take sides with Jesus
[50:53] amen so I just want to reiterate that
[50:57] that that's what Satan's going to do if
[50:59] everybody feels happy now guess what
[51:00] Saints gonna do he's trying to get it to
[51:02] trying to anoint somebody in here or
[51:04] inject somebody to kind of dislike
[51:06] somebody else
[51:07] Satan's always trying to conquer the
[51:09] land team but I'll say like this we've
[51:11] got to conquer Satan with the love of
[51:13] Jesus Christ we've got to overcome any
[51:16] evil we got to overcome any Eve
[51:19] with good that's right the program says
[51:22] you've got tapes
[51:23] so what b-but we believe you got tapes
[51:25] on discipline the church and how to
[51:26] behave yourself in the Church of God how
[51:29] we got to come together and sit together
[51:30] in heavenly places he says don't stay at
[51:32] home if God's in your heart you can't
[51:34] hardly wait for them doors to open to
[51:37] get there to fellowship with your
[51:39] brothers if you don't feel that way then
[51:41] I tell you it's time you got to prayin
[51:44] because we're in the last days and the
[51:47] Bible exhorted us much more so you see
[51:49] that they approach him to love one
[51:50] another with Christian love and divine
[51:52] love to assemble ourselves together in
[51:54] heavenly places in Christ Jesus and to
[51:56] love one another this will all men know
[51:59] you're my disciples when you have love
[52:01] for one another he said stay right
[52:04] together see when you see people start
[52:08] skipping church or falling away from
[52:09] church you know you only have to wonder
[52:11] you know that's the devil because
[52:14] brother Graham tells us the Bible tells
[52:16] us we're a cruel Christians we'll gather
[52:18] more as they see that Day approaching
[52:21] amen
[52:22] program said you just wax that much
[52:24] closer together he said take the buckle
[52:27] he says and that buckles the whole armor
[52:30] of God just pull her on tighten her up
[52:32] remove right close up one to another
[52:35] love one another anyhow talk nice about
[52:37] one another say nice things about one
[52:39] another then God will bless you now then
[52:45] he talks about taking the message now he
[52:48] says now he sees praying is that lord
[52:50] help me this morning as we read your
[52:52] word may the Holy Spirit revealed to us
[52:53] that the church might be fully
[52:55] established in the faith that was once
[52:57] delivered to the Saints to hold them and
[53:00] may as you gave vision some two years
[53:02] ago to store up the food fine
[53:05] healthy-looking vegetables that I saw in
[53:07] the vision being stored up here in the
[53:08] tabernacle may we today receive a whole
[53:11] barrel full of that granite Lord or a
[53:14] tape load he says that it might reveal
[53:17] Jesus Christ to us in the hour that we
[53:20] live to give a sustaining strength the
[53:23] spiritual strength for the task that
[53:25] lays ahead oh I can say amen to that
[53:29] this is a real tape load of spiritual
[53:32] food praise
[53:32] God Hey hallelujah remember at 62
[53:36] brother had a vision he said vision said
[53:39] stay in the tabernacle and store up
[53:41] vegetables Thorpe tapes in other words
[53:43] preached these long sermons so that the
[53:45] Saints will have food later on and I'm
[53:47] glad he did because it's what we're
[53:48] feeding on today I'll tell if there's
[53:51] one thing we need to feed on today it's
[53:53] loving Christ and loving one another
[53:56] because only divine love will make it
[53:58] over in that dimension hey I don't know
[54:02] you as some we have to feed on
[54:04] constantly love one another love one
[54:05] another we've got to keep feeding on
[54:07] that by God's grace now here's one of
[54:11] the most striking things I heard so far
[54:13] on the sermon but medicine I want you to
[54:16] Kurt turn to Colossians 1 while I read
[54:18] this morning he says now just be as
[54:24] patient as you can so as I preach this
[54:26] just be as patient as you can with me I
[54:29] know I'm gonna be reading a lot of
[54:31] quotes but listen I'm not one that
[54:33] quotes you all the time
[54:34] I don't you know I often know preach
[54:36] like this right what I like to do is I
[54:38] like to read fresh scripture and then I
[54:41] could read new things I've never for
[54:43] preached before and as I read it I let
[54:45] the Holy Spirit bring other scriptures
[54:47] and quotes to my remembrance I like to
[54:49] preach that fresh revelation like with
[54:51] the book of ecclesiastes that's how I
[54:53] like to preach many times not always
[54:54] like I said I can go through the whole
[54:56] church age book I go through the whole
[54:57] book of Ephesians I can go through you
[55:00] know the spoken word original seat all
[55:01] these different messages I've preached
[55:03] on but let's go real slow let's just be
[55:06] real patient and brother have said I
[55:09] feel that in here if God will help me
[55:12] will reveal and bring into your mind all
[55:16] these things that I've talked about on
[55:18] all through the days of the tabernacle
[55:21] now this is from before 1933 brother
[55:24] hams talking about so every saying
[55:27] everything I've done from the tabernacle
[55:30] from the beginning till this point 63
[55:33] brother am saying all of that he says is
[55:37] why I've said what I've said and why
[55:40] I've done what I've done he said this
[55:42] sermon is why Amen hallelujah
[55:46] so it was let's see 33 43 53 63 over 30
[55:51] years of the tabernacle he says the
[55:53] reason I'm preaching this message this
[55:54] message Christ is the mystery of God
[55:56] revealed we'll show you why I've done
[55:59] what I've done for 30 years as a prophet
[56:02] hallelujah amen
[56:04] and it's very simple it's not going to
[56:06] go over your head Church it all boils
[56:08] down to this the token the baptism of
[56:10] the Holy Ghost I know yeah
[56:14] praise God you know it's so simple it
[56:17] just boils down to this the reason he
[56:19] ran the tabernacle that way did the
[56:21] reason he had services set up the way
[56:23] did the reason he had brother never
[56:25] preached the Word of God delayed it the
[56:27] reason why he went on the fields and it
[56:29] evangelist his work to spread the
[56:30] message around the world seven times the
[56:33] reason he did that was to reveal Jesus
[56:35] Christ of the people that Christ might
[56:37] live in them by the baptism of the Holy
[56:40] Ghost uh-huh and now we're beneficiaries
[56:43] because Christ is now living in us in
[56:45] Akron Ohio a day it spread from
[56:48] Jeffersonville to Lima to Akron and here
[56:51] we are today with the same Christ the
[56:54] same holy living in us that lived in
[56:56] God's prophet amen and we're preaching
[56:58] the same word amen and you know like I
[57:02] know too
[57:02] the Holy Ghost will come unless you
[57:05] preach the same word haha amen
[57:08] all the other denominational churches
[57:10] yes they've got miracles they got
[57:11] testimonies but the Holy Ghost doesn't
[57:13] hang around for that long he only hangs
[57:16] around when they finally have a good
[57:17] service and they can get a little
[57:19] annoying thing somebody gets healed
[57:20] somebody gets blessed some like that but
[57:22] then after that they go right back to
[57:24] their old worldly ways and the church
[57:27] said hallelujah the same thing was true
[57:30] when I was growing up I was in a
[57:32] Pentecostal church and we would see the
[57:33] Holy Ghost fall people get healed
[57:35] speaking in tongues interpretations but
[57:37] as soon as we got out of the vehicle
[57:38] people went back to listen to their rock
[57:41] and roll I know I did because I was a
[57:42] sinner people go back to their homes and
[57:45] watch movies and watch sporting events
[57:47] and all these things and waste all this
[57:49] time but when those denominations could
[57:51] get in there and just for a few minutes
[57:53] confess all their sins and
[57:55] give the right sacrifices the Holy Ghost
[57:57] would fall but the Holy Ghost wouldn't
[57:59] remain what am I saying the Holy Ghost
[58:01] should remain with us a day amen because
[58:05] it should not just be an anointing for a
[58:07] little while it should be a seal not to
[58:09] the next revival not to whether James
[58:12] comes back but a seal to the day of your
[58:14] Redemption when you get a new body amen
[58:17] that's the difference Church that's the
[58:19] difference just like my mom got healed
[58:22] my momma cancer but then she goes back
[58:24] and cuts her hair and the Bible says God
[58:26] don't hear prayers and my mom has told
[58:28] me I love my mom and it's occasions this
[58:30] I don't have a problem of that but she's
[58:31] told me herself
[58:32] she said I don't know why God healed me
[58:34] of cancer but then when I pray for so
[58:35] many people God don't hear my prayers
[58:37] I've had my old mom tell me that it's
[58:42] really striking but it shows that the
[58:45] anointing is there for a while but then
[58:46] when they disobey the word God can't
[58:49] bless that amen
[58:51] I know that's rough I know that's my own
[58:54] dear mother the one I love the one that
[58:55] nursed me and the one that had me on her
[58:58] lap and just and raised I know that's
[58:59] but but church this is the word we're
[59:01] talking about this is eternal life we're
[59:04] talking about they get an anointing and
[59:06] it lasts for the lahu good service good
[59:08] service and they go back out and live
[59:10] like the world we've got to live like
[59:12] Christ all the time not just in the
[59:15] service at a whole we got to make
[59:17] sacrifices the pleasing unto Christ all
[59:20] the time we want to feels presence
[59:22] everywhere we go
[59:23] that's what should make us different so
[59:27] this sermon is brother I'm explaining
[59:30] why he's done everything he's done at
[59:32] brendham tavern Oh hallelujah now it's
[59:41] one of the most amazing statements I've
[59:43] heard in a long time from brother
[59:45] Brennan because there's also simple so
[59:48] see the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[59:50] key to everything it's the only way to
[59:52] have Christ live through you to manifest
[59:54] his word and see this is
[1:00:00] proves to me that's why I live preaching
[1:00:02] is more powerful than playing the tape
[1:00:03] playing the tape can be powerful but
[1:00:06] that's not God's provided way God's from
[1:00:08] by the ways through live preachers
[1:00:10] because that's what the Holy Spirit led
[1:00:11] brother Evan do for all of his days upon
[1:00:13] this earth amen that's exactly right oh
[1:00:17] just a little update after we left voice
[1:00:19] of God brother air and said you know you
[1:00:20] should contact those remember I preached
[1:00:22] out a little bit on the jeffersonville
[1:00:24] he said you should contact that brother
[1:00:25] well I put out on my to-do list but I've
[1:00:27] been so busy but that's the thing I love
[1:00:30] about to-do lists the electronic ones I
[1:00:32] never lose it it always stays on there
[1:00:33] so I eventually got to it this week and
[1:00:36] I text are emailed the voice of God and
[1:00:39] I got ahold of Gentlemen and today I
[1:00:41] sent him the quotes that we made
[1:00:44] disagreed on and I said him a link I put
[1:00:46] a link in there here's my sermon if you
[1:00:47] want to listen to a preacher I don't
[1:00:50] know if they will because they don't
[1:00:50] listen to brother Branham but maybe God
[1:00:52] open their hearts but see that's that's
[1:00:54] the one thing church that we've got to
[1:00:56] do we've got to have so much love if we
[1:00:58] see somebody in there we should say God
[1:01:00] lead me to try to help them lead me to
[1:01:04] try to help them it may take three
[1:01:06] months but in your heart if you want to
[1:01:09] help somebody God's gonna help you help
[1:01:10] them August September October four
[1:01:14] months four months if you've got a burn
[1:01:17] if you want to do something good if you
[1:01:19] want to help somebody Church God is
[1:01:20] going to help you do it because that's
[1:01:23] God's heart what if we just would've
[1:01:25] walked and say walked away and say it on
[1:01:27] a bunch of a bunch of people under false
[1:01:29] doctrine oh who cares about their who
[1:01:30] cares about their souls we care about
[1:01:32] their souls we care about people we want
[1:01:35] to see people set free hey there's a lot
[1:01:38] of good churches over there by Jefferson
[1:01:41] mill I can't remember the name of the
[1:01:44] church but there's one there in Kentucky
[1:01:45] Louisville yeah there's a really good
[1:01:47] Church there brother Brooks has preached
[1:01:49] there I can't think of them the
[1:01:51] minister's name right now but they got a
[1:01:52] really good church over there and
[1:01:53] produced some ober giuse Burgess there's
[1:01:56] a church in Louisville a pastors name is
[1:01:58] Burgess last name beautiful wonderful
[1:02:01] church that loves the Lord there's a lot
[1:02:03] of churches you know there's so there's
[1:02:04] a lot of that believe there's a lot that
[1:02:05] don't but we know we want to be the
[1:02:08] believers praise God
[1:02:09] now brother Branham starts this sermon
[1:02:12] with something you're very familiar with
[1:02:14] most of you he begins by talking about
[1:02:19] God's secret before the world began he
[1:02:22] goes over what happened in God's mind
[1:02:24] before the foundation of the world he
[1:02:29] said now back in the beginning before
[1:02:31] the world began in the back part of
[1:02:34] God's mind so picture that the back part
[1:02:36] of God's mind there was something he was
[1:02:39] trying and was going to achieve and he
[1:02:43] had a motive in doing it in order to let
[1:02:45] himself be expressed so God's in the
[1:02:48] back of the mind thinking I just want to
[1:02:49] express myself I've got so many desires
[1:02:53] in here I want to show people I had he
[1:02:57] too made him yet he's but I want to show
[1:02:59] people this in the back of his mind I
[1:03:01] want to show people all that's in my
[1:03:03] heart amen
[1:03:06] he said because first there wasn't even
[1:03:09] a moon a star had a molecule anything he
[1:03:12] was God but he wasn't exactly God at
[1:03:14] this time because he wasn't being
[1:03:16] worshiped yet now church Danka don't get
[1:03:19] it wrong he was God but he just wasn't
[1:03:21] being worshiped some people
[1:03:23] misunderstand that quote oh he wasn't
[1:03:24] God well what was it what was he then if
[1:03:26] he wasn't God what could he be he had to
[1:03:28] be God but he just wasn't being fully
[1:03:30] worship like a God should be worshiped
[1:03:33] so brother Ham said to the first thing
[1:03:35] of my opinion he made was angels he said
[1:03:39] God in his great mind one of these
[1:03:41] attributes to be expressed in him was
[1:03:44] love in him was to be father and it was
[1:03:46] to be son and it was to be Savior in him
[1:03:49] what it was to be healer all these great
[1:03:51] attributes that we are that we see how
[1:03:53] hard to express they were in God praise
[1:03:57] God now he says now God had a purpose
[1:04:00] and a hidden mystery and that's what I
[1:04:03] want to speak on to the church this
[1:04:05] morning the hidden mystery of God that
[1:04:08] he had his mind before the world ever
[1:04:10] began and how that it's unfold itself
[1:04:13] right down to this present hour that
[1:04:15] we're living then you will understand
[1:04:17] clearly then you you see on I believe
[1:04:21] what is being done so by preaching this
[1:04:25] sermon brother Aaron was telling us what
[1:04:27] was in
[1:04:28] mine and then now that we can figure out
[1:04:30] what's in God's mind we can see what's
[1:04:32] being done today an acronym ahead oh
[1:04:35] yeah hey man so at the conclusion of
[1:04:39] this tonight we should know what God
[1:04:41] wants to be done in Akron Ohio and I'm
[1:04:43] gonna tell you I'm not gonna get close
[1:04:44] to finish it but we should know what
[1:04:47] what is God trying to do in Akron Ohio
[1:04:50] because that's what he says you'll see
[1:04:53] what's being done right now now brother
[1:04:57] Branham is talking about how God's great
[1:04:59] mysteries are secret and he kept it a
[1:05:01] secret
[1:05:02] he said nobody know nothing about it now
[1:05:04] even the Angels didn't understand he
[1:05:06] said that's the reason under our seventh
[1:05:08] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:05:11] there was silence Jesus when he was on
[1:05:13] earth they wanted to know when he would
[1:05:15] come he said even the son himself don't
[1:05:17] know when it's going to happen see God
[1:05:19] has this all to himself it's a secret
[1:05:21] and that's the reason there were silence
[1:05:23] in heaven for a space of a half-hour and
[1:05:25] the seven thunders under their voices
[1:05:27] and John was even forbidden to ride at
[1:05:29] sea the coming of the Lord that's one
[1:05:32] thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he
[1:05:34] will come and when he will come it's a
[1:05:36] good thing that he doesn't alright
[1:05:40] so Bertram says God still has secrets
[1:05:43] aren't you glad God's hiding that from
[1:05:45] the devil there's a lot of preachers
[1:05:48] that want to know - I know well they're
[1:05:49] after me so then I can live like a devil
[1:05:51] until the rapture comes oh that's not
[1:05:55] how we live though we're ready all the
[1:05:58] time for the rapture
[1:05:59] I'm ready tonight amen hallelujah I'm
[1:06:03] not waiting to get my life right well in
[1:06:05] 2019 or every year somebody preaches
[1:06:08] like or somebody makes it sound like
[1:06:09] well the Lord's coming this year the
[1:06:11] Lord's and they all try to make these
[1:06:12] predictions to get people to believe
[1:06:14] them and try to try to make themselves
[1:06:16] look more spiritual listen church well
[1:06:17] we're not being more spiritual when we
[1:06:19] make false predictions we're being less
[1:06:21] spiritual we're trying to move the
[1:06:24] people by fear and set up by love what
[1:06:27] we should do is try to move the people
[1:06:28] and say how much you love Jesus now how
[1:06:31] many will love Jesus more praise God it
[1:06:34] should move where we're not trying to
[1:06:35] scare people in the rapture we're trying
[1:06:37] to get people to love God into the
[1:06:39] rapture it's a
[1:06:41] that's gonna put you in the rapture
[1:06:42] outfit here it's love and we've got to
[1:06:45] learn to love Jesus even though we don't
[1:06:47] know that they're our we've just got to
[1:06:49] love that he's coming back amen
[1:06:52] it's exactly right so God still got
[1:06:57] these secrets and he's not telling
[1:06:59] nobody he didn't even tell his son Jesus
[1:07:03] because the but that's what Jesus said
[1:07:05] the son himself don't even know the
[1:07:06] rapture the Angels don't know God likes
[1:07:10] to keep secrets Oh hallelujah thank you
[1:07:15] Jesus oh my now program said God's goal
[1:07:24] God's goal in the back of his mind to
[1:07:26] express himself but the RAM said is in
[1:07:29] every type that's in the Bible so in
[1:07:33] every type of the Old Testament you will
[1:07:35] see God's goal which there's a three
[1:07:38] part goal will read it in a little bit
[1:07:39] from brother branham petrm said he has
[1:07:42] showed it in every type that's in the
[1:07:43] Bible therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:07:47] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[1:07:50] that's why brother Aaron sister Connie I
[1:07:53] can preach on Ecclesiastes and people
[1:07:57] might say well look on the internet go
[1:08:00] to sleep on that one or maybe they'll
[1:08:03] say oh look at the title Ecclesiastes
[1:08:05] that's the Old Testament that has
[1:08:06] nothing to do with us but program says
[1:08:09] the mystery of God is hidden in every
[1:08:12] book of the Bible that's why I can take
[1:08:15] the book of Ecclesiastes and it might
[1:08:17] not seem it means reached or it might
[1:08:19] not seem very much but in Ecclesiastes
[1:08:22] is part of the mystery of God and I hope
[1:08:26] you saw as we preached Ecclesiastes amen
[1:08:30] which is what fear the Lord amen fear
[1:08:33] God keep his commandments that's what we
[1:08:35] see from Ecclesiastes everything is
[1:08:38] temporal except the word Amen that's
[1:08:42] what the conclusion of the preachers
[1:08:44] don't put your don't invest all in these
[1:08:46] temporal things invest put your time
[1:08:49] energy or your money everything that you
[1:08:52] have put everything into the gospel of
[1:08:54] Jesus Christ
[1:08:55] very mad he says the entire Bible is the
[1:09:02] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[1:09:04] the entire Bible is an expression of the
[1:09:07] one goal God had one purpose he wouldn't
[1:09:10] achieve in the entire Bible all the acts
[1:09:12] of the believers in the Bible has been
[1:09:13] in type and expressing what God's great
[1:09:16] goal is and now this last day he's
[1:09:18] revealed it and shows it and by God's
[1:09:20] help we'll see it this morning what the
[1:09:21] Lord has had in his mind all along and
[1:09:24] has expressed it ah ha ha ha and this is
[1:09:28] one servant we should be able to see
[1:09:31] everything that God is in except for the
[1:09:33] secrets right we never see everything
[1:09:35] God had in his mind about wanting to
[1:09:38] express himself
[1:09:39] oh my thank you lord
[1:09:47] now the first scripture brother Ram
[1:09:50] preaches is Luke 24 so let's go there of
[1:09:54] course you know it clashes one is this
[1:09:56] text you know that let's go to Luke 20
[1:09:59] look 24 so the very first scripture he
[1:10:04] references Luke chapter 24 let me get
[1:10:11] the verse now the road to Emmaus you
[1:10:17] know the story this is after the
[1:10:19] resurrection on Sunday the Resurrection
[1:10:21] Sunday Jesus steps out and he begins
[1:10:24] walking with Cleophus and his friend and
[1:10:28] the Bible says as they were going along
[1:10:31] Jesus stepped out and he talked sauce
[1:10:34] talk starts to ask him what's what's
[1:10:36] going on now in verse 25 now look how he
[1:10:40] talks to believer
[1:10:42] look how Jesus the resurrected Jesus in
[1:10:45] a perfect glorified body that looks like
[1:10:47] a human body except it's glorified look
[1:10:50] how he talks to them in verse 32 25 and
[1:10:52] then he said to them o fools wait did I
[1:10:55] read that right Oh beautiful bride
[1:11:00] precious Gentile or sorry Jewish bride
[1:11:04] of the message of the hours that how he
[1:11:05] says it to them
[1:11:07] Oh fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:11:14] all that the prophets have spoken art
[1:11:18] not Christ to have suffered these things
[1:11:19] and to enter into his glory and
[1:11:23] beginning at Moses and all there it is
[1:11:26] SOTA have says all the prophets he
[1:11:28] expounded unto them in all the
[1:11:29] Scriptures the things concerning himself
[1:11:33] little Bram said in the book of st. Luke
[1:11:35] 2:24 tapped err we find out Jesus
[1:11:38] stepped out on their road to Emmaus he
[1:11:44] says and they were going along their
[1:11:46] weeping and he stepped down and began to
[1:11:48] talk to them about Christ what was he
[1:11:50] doing identifying himself to these
[1:11:53] apostles that all the prophets all the
[1:11:55] Psalms everything was him expressed amen
[1:11:58] glory Jesus in order to get them to see
[1:12:03] who he was he's got to point them back
[1:12:06] to the word because the word the Old
[1:12:08] Testament word tells them who Jesus is
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:13] hallelujah so we see Jesus in
[1:12:15] Ecclesiastes I'll just keep stay on that
[1:12:17] one we see Jesus in there that
[1:12:21] everything we're going to do is going to
[1:12:22] come under judgment remember the Bible
[1:12:24] said every idle word that spoken will
[1:12:27] come under judgment I'll remember that
[1:12:29] every idle word so guess what we better
[1:12:32] when we pray at night we better say Lord
[1:12:33] forgive me of every idle word I spoke at
[1:12:35] us and then it'll be under the blood
[1:12:38] because people people that don't confess
[1:12:41] that will answer to God for every idle
[1:12:44] word that they spoken every single idle
[1:12:47] word God forgive us now amen Jesus
[1:12:51] forgive us Jesus of every idle word geez
[1:12:55] don't baby around say oh you precious
[1:12:57] message believers that oh yeah I love
[1:13:00] you so much and you're just you're just
[1:13:01] so sweet and kind and he says Oh fools
[1:13:04] and isn't that red-letter where's church
[1:13:08] see God is a God of grace but he's also
[1:13:11] God who demands responsibility praise
[1:13:16] God

[1:13:19] did everybody hear the testimony from
[1:13:20] Brenda anybody hear that on Sunday night

[1:14:52] the Holy Spirit begin to answer her
[1:14:54] prayer amen

[1:15:04] atmosphere praise God we got to take

[1:15:56] screamed and shouted for fifteen to

[1:16:12] reigns amen he wants to express himself
[1:16:14] as a healer amen
[1:16:18] remember when we pray for out there
[1:16:20] remember we pray for her and I told you
[1:16:23] about she said she felt angel's wings
[1:16:24] around her she was passed out in a
[1:16:27] seizure and I went pray there I said
[1:16:29] amen let's go pray for and as soon as I
[1:16:31] said Amen she opened her eyes and then I
[1:16:35] started talking about GC start thanking
[1:16:37] me for preaching the Word of God
[1:16:39] bragging on Jesus and all these things
[1:16:41] and saying how close she's got to God
[1:16:44] since she came to our church and Karen
[1:16:46] asked her about later she said she
[1:16:47] didn't remember one of it she didn't
[1:16:49] remember any of that
[1:16:50] so was the Holy Spirit speaking right
[1:16:53] through her to me amen
[1:16:56] she don't remember because it was God
[1:16:58] anointing her to speak and all she was
[1:17:00] saying was testimonies about how good
[1:17:02] God how good God is and how God was
[1:17:04] gonna heal her and just a few short days
[1:17:06] after that God began healing her praise
[1:17:09] God amen let's be mindful of whose
[1:17:13] presence were in tonight there's no none
[1:17:15] of us that's important it's our Lord
[1:17:17] Jesus that's important not even that
[1:17:19] picture but I just pointed that picture
[1:17:21] so we'll think about his Holy Spirit
[1:17:22] among us praise God God's here in our
[1:17:27] prayers Church we just got to be sweet
[1:17:30] and loving to everybody
[1:17:31] we just got to make sure the devil don't
[1:17:33] annoy just inject us with some poison
[1:17:36] right so Steve
[1:17:43] Jesus to get clear pissed to see who he
[1:17:47] was pointed him back to the Old
[1:17:48] Testament word but when he talks about
[1:17:52] how the Psalms I'll speak of Jesus my
[1:17:54] God my God why hast thou forsaken me in
[1:17:56] Psalm 22 now brother Ram breaks off from
[1:18:04] there and he he starts preaching on how
[1:18:06] God hides his thoughts from the scholars
[1:18:09] only the predestinated hear the word of
[1:18:11] God amen glory
[1:18:17] Lorain have said so see the very thought
[1:18:20] that God had in his mind he said he hid
[1:18:23] from all those scholars just a number a
[1:18:26] selected predestinated number of
[1:18:29] predestinated people was the only ones
[1:18:31] that heard it and I searched back down
[1:18:33] to the scripture that through the age of
[1:18:35] the prophets and see if it wasn't the
[1:18:37] same thing Korie amen he said in Jesus
[1:18:43] this time though he said those Jewish
[1:18:45] teachers rabbis doctors of the law the
[1:18:48] professors had did exactly like they've
[1:18:50] done before they had the Psalms they had
[1:18:53] the prophets and still they missed Jesus
[1:18:55] Christ for their day program quotes
[1:18:59] Jesus in John 5:43 he said searchy the
[1:19:03] Scriptures for in them you think you
[1:19:05] have eternal life and they are they
[1:19:07] which testify of me amen
[1:19:10] how many one know Jesus search the
[1:19:13] Scriptures right jesus said if you would
[1:19:17] know me search the Scriptures because
[1:19:19] they testify of me
[1:19:21] amen that's why we every that's why we
[1:19:25] always preach the word and my man says
[1:19:27] you see it's got to come back to the
[1:19:29] word because the word is God Jesus
[1:19:35] declaring the same that the word is him
[1:19:38] you can't make the scripture contradict
[1:19:40] itself in the beginning was the word the
[1:19:42] Word was with God the Word was God the
[1:19:43] Word made flesh amen
[1:19:47] so when I'm preaching Ecclesiastes I'm
[1:19:50] preaching part of the word I'm preaching
[1:19:52] part of Christ and it's revealing the
[1:19:55] mind of God you and I
[1:19:57] how many can say amen to that no matter
[1:19:59] which scripture I preach over any
[1:20:01] preacher it's revealing to you part of
[1:20:04] the mind of God and you get to know God
[1:20:06] a little better praise God he says
[1:20:10] everything has got to come back to the
[1:20:12] word that's why all these movements
[1:20:13] today don't come back to the word making
[1:20:16] certain people prophets take them
[1:20:18] preachers out of the pulpits you never
[1:20:19] find that in the word so that's not part
[1:20:22] of Christ mind that's the part of a
[1:20:24] man's thinking not part or men or women
[1:20:27] that's not part of the word so what do
[1:20:29] we love more do we love people more you
[1:20:31] love the learn more all of our
[1:20:33] allegiance is to the Word of God that's
[1:20:36] why we don't add to the word we don't
[1:20:38] take anything away from the word program
[1:20:40] said the pattern of the book of Acts and
[1:20:42] st. Paul will always remain the pattern
[1:20:45] until Jesus Christ comes in the rapture
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:50] it's not gonna change it's the same
[1:20:53] yesterday today and forever
[1:20:55] oh my thank you lord
[1:20:58] now the RAM said oh it looks like it
[1:21:02] can't be any plainer search the
[1:21:04] scriptures he said Moses and all the
[1:21:06] laws all the prophets all the Psalms
[1:21:08] spoke of him and again he said the
[1:21:10] scriptures testify of him hey hallelujah
[1:21:15] now I think what I'll do because I'm
[1:21:21] seeing that clock let me yeah let me let
[1:21:27] me go through this here only the
[1:21:29] predestinated will see it how many
[1:21:31] believe you're a predestinated child of
[1:21:32] God hallelujah how come you can see it
[1:21:37] and your favorite or maybe your friends
[1:21:39] or family couldn't see it how come you
[1:21:41] can see it because your predestinated
[1:21:43] it's always a small group God chose you
[1:21:47] how come the word means so much to you
[1:21:49] now when before did it mean anything to
[1:21:51] you why does it do that because you're
[1:21:53] one of God's children you were in his
[1:21:55] mind you were part of that word before
[1:21:58] the foundation of the world
[1:22:02] hallelujah thank you Jesus amen
[1:22:06] that's not skim milk to me that's steak
[1:22:09] and eggs to me
[1:22:11] that's neat that's rich I never heard
[1:22:14] that growing up in denominational church
[1:22:15] that God chose me in Christ before the
[1:22:19] foundational world you never heard that
[1:22:21] before until God sent a prophet event
[1:22:23] and God keeps telling us that so it
[1:22:26] encouraged us to live like the word
[1:22:28] because we came from the word and we're
[1:22:30] going back to the word program said he
[1:22:37] is the principal theme of the entire
[1:22:38] Bible so see I'm getting this a most of
[1:22:41] our favorite quotes right if you read
[1:22:44] the Bible don't see Christ in every
[1:22:45] verse of it go back and read it again
[1:22:50] thank you Lord huh so I can preach on
[1:22:54] Ecclesiastes chapter four or five or six
[1:22:56] or seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[1:22:57] and if you don't see Christ in it you
[1:23:00] need to go back to read again that's
[1:23:04] right church he says because you've
[1:23:07] missed something how many would be
[1:23:09] honest to say sometimes I miss things
[1:23:10] yeah amen my hands are up - amen
[1:23:13] double amen for me I miss things he says
[1:23:17] the Bible is Christ he's the word when
[1:23:19] you read it in the beginning God created
[1:23:21] there's Christ he says from the Amen -
[1:23:26] revelation 22 every word testifying of
[1:23:29] Jesus Christ that's why these added
[1:23:34] books of the they call the second book
[1:23:35] of daniel in the book of macabees and
[1:23:37] the purgatory it's not spoke of in the
[1:23:40] rest of the scripture see it doesn't
[1:23:45] theme up with the rest of it there's no
[1:23:46] place to find purgatory in there there's
[1:23:49] no place in for the intercession of
[1:23:51] saints and these things there's no place
[1:23:53] in there for that there's no place for
[1:23:54] denomination there's no place for
[1:23:56] Creed's outside the Bible so when you
[1:23:58] see these things they just don't come
[1:24:00] into the picture and that's why people's
[1:24:01] added those and they're jigsaw puzzles
[1:24:04] all mixed up
[1:24:05] see they can't make it right the same
[1:24:08] yesterday today and forever on oh yeah
[1:24:14] aren't you glad when you come to church
[1:24:16] you get to come to church and you're
[1:24:20] jigsaw puzzle it's all laid out there
[1:24:22] and every piece is in perfect order
[1:24:24] you know most people come to church and
[1:24:26] it's like the preacher just poured out
[1:24:28] the jigsaw boxes and all the pieces just
[1:24:30] scatter all over and say okay Church
[1:24:32] here's your picture of Jesus they didn't
[1:24:36] cut their hair in the Old Testament but
[1:24:37] you can cut it now women they never paid
[1:24:40] in their face in the whole Bible but you
[1:24:42] could eat your face and that's what
[1:24:46] their jig that's their jigsaw puzzle if
[1:24:49] the piece of just all laid out and said
[1:24:51] here's a beautiful picture of Christ but
[1:24:54] you and I can come to church and every
[1:24:57] piece fits perfectly the Old Testament
[1:25:00] dispensation of flowing in the New
[1:25:02] Testament or the same god of grace the
[1:25:04] abominations of cross-dressing
[1:25:05] is still Bominable today praise God amen
[1:25:10] it fits together perfectly because he's
[1:25:13] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:25:14] said I am the Lord God I don't change
[1:25:16] one bit
[1:25:18] amen I'm glad my jigsaw puzzle is all
[1:25:23] placed together by the Holy Spirit
[1:25:25] that's right
[1:25:29] he says if the thing is put together
[1:25:31] right there's an entire picture of the
[1:25:34] fall and regeneration the whole picture
[1:25:36] of creation God's whole plan revealed
[1:25:39] right in Jesus Christ amen he said
[1:25:42] that's the whole picture set together
[1:25:43] every little crook and corner he says
[1:25:47] it's just like putting a jigsaw puzzle
[1:25:49] together that's what I you know that's
[1:25:53] when I preach on please ask these I
[1:25:54] don't I keep saying that but I'm just
[1:25:56] giving examples I didn't understand even
[1:25:58] the book of Proverbs I didn't understand
[1:26:00] a lot of that until I preached it and
[1:26:01] now I can place it by the Holy Spirit
[1:26:03] and I can understand that
[1:26:05] I can understand these different things
[1:26:07] I've read over how come he says we
[1:26:09] should be misery man's miserable we get
[1:26:11] the Bible says it's joy unspeakable and
[1:26:13] full of glory if you put the jigsaw
[1:26:15] puzzle to the right way you'll see well
[1:26:17] Solomon was a backslidden King that's
[1:26:20] why he's depressed about life but you
[1:26:22] and I have Jesus promise Jesus says he
[1:26:26] says I'm leaving my joy with you now I'm
[1:26:28] not leaving SAW with you do not despair
[1:26:30] he said but have joy because I've
[1:26:32] overcome later the CIA men
[1:26:37] never to see I praise God he promised it
[1:26:39] he said I'm leaving my joy with you
[1:26:41] Malachi amen he said I'm leaving Lydia
[1:26:46] of leaving you my joy says you don't
[1:26:48] want to be despair you don't to be
[1:26:50] discouraged I believe in you joy you
[1:26:52] just got to receive it when when my wife
[1:26:58] and I leave Christmas presents

[1:27:19] now it's the time to understand the win
[1:27:21] of God for your life now is the time to
[1:27:23] make a move about this now is the time
[1:27:25] because remember our children are really
[1:27:27] good about about it as far as I know I
[1:27:29] don't see them cutting out the wrapping
[1:27:31] paper to peek in there at least I've
[1:27:34] never caught him and if I catch you I'm
[1:27:39] gonna tell you to tape it back up but
[1:27:43] see God that's how it is like God
[1:27:45] we got to wait to the time the right
[1:27:46] time as soon as we say okay let's start
[1:27:48] with the young let's start with the
[1:27:49] young ones and then when pretty soon
[1:27:51] it's a Katia's turn and it's Lydia mauka
[1:27:53] they all get their turn and there's time
[1:27:55] to open it up and that's what we have to
[1:27:57] do with God's Word it's time for this
[1:27:59] word to open up to us amen and let me
[1:28:02] tell you some of these scriptures have
[1:28:04] to open up for us to get a body change
[1:28:06] to go in the rapture praise God it's
[1:28:08] already written here it's not gonna be
[1:28:10] something outside the way or something
[1:28:12] over our head it's already written here
[1:28:14] we've just got to open up and let the
[1:28:16] Holy Spirit open up these great presence
[1:28:18] in his word amen
[1:28:22] we just gotta let God tell us it's time
[1:28:24] to open up that word for the rapture
[1:28:26] it's time for a body change and the
[1:28:29] church said no get me wrong it'll be
[1:28:31] right on time it'll be right on time I
[1:28:35] know people have brothers try to peek in
[1:28:37] and try to make guests as a whole I
[1:28:38] think I know what that is that's a GI
[1:28:42] Joe set and the whole time it may be say
[1:28:47] it's like pair of jeans or something
[1:28:48] like that
[1:28:49] they're just trying to make these
[1:28:51] guesses Oh remember the one we read
[1:28:53] remember the one we read earlier at the
[1:28:54] beginning this year about how they said
[1:28:57] 27 2018 is 70 years for since Israel has
[1:29:01] been a nation and that online preacher
[1:29:04] he made it sound like this is the time
[1:29:06] the 144,000 are coming back now he's got
[1:29:08] about two months to make his prediction
[1:29:10] right and I can hope that quote I know
[1:29:13] where it is that I know which I know it
[1:29:15] is in my church age series and they put
[1:29:18] all these pressure see it's at 70 years
[1:29:20] God's going back to the Jews this year
[1:29:21] is it what if it comes and goes and it's
[1:29:23] not just giving people false hope just
[1:29:27] guessing all these guesses but God is
[1:29:30] not a guesser God's not like I wonder if
[1:29:33] Jesse would like to hear the message or
[1:29:34] not I wonder brother Aaron would want to
[1:29:39] receive the Word of God
[1:29:39] I wonder if Connie does believe in
[1:29:42] healing and I wonder if she'll receive
[1:29:44] that or not God's not sitting there
[1:29:46] wonder God knows and so because he knows
[1:29:49] he predestined that you'll receive all
[1:29:51] this presence amen almost said Christmas
[1:29:54] presents but we know every day is
[1:29:57] Christmas for us hallelujah worshiping
[1:30:01] Jesus every day you see oh I'm so glad
[1:30:07] our pictures not ruined by
[1:30:09] denominational things because you know
[1:30:12] when I was going to church you know they
[1:30:13] told me when I was growing up their
[1:30:15] picture like putting an elephant on top
[1:30:17] of a tree they said well you can speak
[1:30:20] in tongues as long as you speak in
[1:30:21] tongues then you got the Holy Ghost then
[1:30:23] you can be a part of our church and then
[1:30:26] even if you fall away you're still saved
[1:30:28] because you spoke in tongues as long as
[1:30:30] you spoke in a tongue you're saved you
[1:30:35] can live like a devil you're still safe
[1:30:37] because you spoke in tongues oh that's a
[1:30:39] bunch of tommyrot that's a bunch of
[1:30:42] jigsaw pieces scattered all over the
[1:30:45] place that's why when I sat in that
[1:30:47] first meeting I was about 19 years old I
[1:30:49] just gave my heart to the Lord and I
[1:30:52] heard that and I ask a question I said
[1:30:54] well what about this to that they said
[1:30:56] well that's the passivation said that's
[1:30:58] just what we believe i sat there that
[1:31:01] day when I said I'm never coming back
[1:31:03] here
[1:31:03] I'm not doing this Church and I didn't
[1:31:07] even know the message yet was that it's
[1:31:10] sure there was some seed already in me
[1:31:12] praise God amen
[1:31:14] there's some seed that was that was
[1:31:16] rejecting something that was outside the
[1:31:18] word because that seed is the word of
[1:31:20] God amen
[1:31:22] it was a dormancy just waiting to be
[1:31:24] quickened by the message of the hour
[1:31:27] holiday yeah so even at that age I don't
[1:31:31] even know the message I couldn't give
[1:31:33] into that because there was something
[1:31:34] inside of me said that puzzle is all out
[1:31:37] of whack
[1:31:38] just like you can look at a puzzle and
[1:31:40] say all that piece is wrong look how the
[1:31:42] cow it'll say look how Haven or
[1:31:44] character look how well the little ones
[1:31:46] trying to jam that piece in there oh
[1:31:47] look it's all dead no it's not
[1:31:50] something's wrong with that it needs fix
[1:31:52] and these fixed by somebody who
[1:31:54] understands how to put the puzzle
[1:31:55] together to make the picture look right
[1:31:57] and that person is here tonight he's the
[1:32:00] Holy Ghost amen
[1:32:01] he's the only one who could interpret
[1:32:04] his word hallelujah that's exactly right
[1:32:09] he said that's why we got pictures today
[1:32:12] that looks horrible
[1:32:14] that's a horrible looking picture well
[1:32:18] Graham said an elephant sitting on
[1:32:19] standing on top of a oak tree or
[1:32:21] something like that can you imagine that
[1:32:23] you might see that in dr. Seuss book but
[1:32:25] you won't see that in real life I showed
[1:32:28] you what kind of dr. neck I had a jigsaw
[1:32:31] puzzle was all mixed up that's right he
[1:32:36] says they say we're believers and the
[1:32:38] cow is picking grass up in the top of
[1:32:41] the tree
[1:32:41] that don't work then they say yeah he's
[1:32:43] every way but just a certain he's the
[1:32:45] same yesterday today forever all but a
[1:32:47] certain thing then you ruin your picture
[1:32:51] well God used to require that God
[1:32:54] doesn't require that anymore but the
[1:32:58] Bible said he's the same well he was he
[1:33:03] wasn't that age he says there you got
[1:33:05] your picture wrong wrong again
[1:33:07] you got a man fishing out in the desert
[1:33:09] for fish in a bunch of hot sand where
[1:33:11] there's no fish in huh yeah
[1:33:16] Oh searches we were raised and that's
[1:33:18] what the picture they were giving
[1:33:20] they've got you out in the boat fishing
[1:33:23] in the desert say here fishy fishy fishy
[1:33:26] fishy fishy all pretty soon we're gonna
[1:33:29] catch the big one we're gonna go in the
[1:33:31] rapture let me put my sis let me uh
[1:33:34] knock off the ashes off my cigarette
[1:33:37] real quick oh but I spoke in tongues or
[1:33:41] I prophesied or I got slaying the spirit
[1:33:43] so I'm good I'm gonna have a little
[1:33:45] social drink I'll go to rock n roll
[1:33:47] party that's okay cuz I I spoke in
[1:33:50] tongues now I keep using that so sister
[1:33:51] yeah take any offense of that but
[1:33:53] because I know you speak in tongues but
[1:33:54] don't take any offense of that I'm just
[1:33:56] using examples well I got slain the
[1:33:58] spirit or I had blood come out of my
[1:34:00] palms like my man said they had a a a
[1:34:01] ons meetings he would say no that's the
[1:34:03] evidence now blood coming out of the
[1:34:05] palm can you imagine that program
[1:34:08] disagreed in a kind way but what they're
[1:34:10] doing is saying oh we're gonna go in the
[1:34:12] rapture we're the true Church of God or
[1:34:14] the true Bride of Christ and they're
[1:34:16] fishing in a desert oh my well you and I
[1:34:22] were fishing in a lake and thank God we
[1:34:26] caught some rainbow trout here in Akron
[1:34:30] amen thank God we cast a little read out
[1:34:34] there and a little fishy named van gang
[1:34:37] caught on to it I should say a big trout
[1:34:40] rather I'm sorry not a little fishy a
[1:34:42] big trout he's probably listening right
[1:34:44] now cuz he live streams aren't services
[1:34:46] so brother Hank no laugh too hard don't
[1:34:48] don't mess up your job there I don't
[1:34:50] want to get in trouble for losing a
[1:34:52] thousand dollars on your tool piece
[1:34:53] there but we throw it we went fishing in
[1:34:57] a river amen
[1:34:59] I'll say that this it's the rivers of
[1:35:01] life ha yeah amen
[1:35:03] I was fishing the rivers of life and
[1:35:05] divine caught it but then he he said
[1:35:08] Amen come over here hear the word of God
[1:35:10] and through it again and it caught bang
[1:35:11] amen hallelujah and God brought that
[1:35:14] rainbow fish right into my boat amen and
[1:35:19] now we got some other ones because of
[1:35:21] that glory it's exactly right
[1:35:29] you got to make the picture look right
[1:35:31] he said it's God's great picture there's
[1:35:35] only one way you'll see it that's when
[1:35:37] you see Jesus Christ there's the entire
[1:35:39] Bible he's the principal theme of the
[1:35:41] Bible now let me close with this I'm
[1:35:45] just gonna close right here let me do
[1:35:46] three more paragraphs he's the principal
[1:35:48] theme of the Bible he was in the
[1:35:50] prophets he was in the Psalms he was in
[1:35:52] the history of the Bible the Bible is a
[1:35:54] prophetic book it's a historical book
[1:35:56] it's the book of love it's a book of
[1:35:58] songs it's a book of life and in there
[1:36:00] you find Christ and he was in the
[1:36:03] prophets he was in the Psalms he was in
[1:36:05] the history and he was also in the Bible
[1:36:07] is the thing that is to come amen
[1:36:09] Larry so Jesus was past present future
[1:36:14] he's everything in the Bible amen and
[1:36:17] when you inject something there that
[1:36:19] doesn't make him the same yesterday
[1:36:20] today and forever
[1:36:21] he said brother Lee where'd he go to you
[1:36:23] got an awful picture there he was the
[1:36:27] history he's the prophet he's the Psalms
[1:36:29] he's everything and if you can't make
[1:36:31] him everything in the same they're what
[1:36:33] your picture look like you see all right
[1:36:35] is Jesus Christ Church is he the same
[1:36:39] yesterday today and forever is he the
[1:36:42] same today amen then we need to have
[1:36:45] more faith in our lives to see more of
[1:36:48] him praise the Lord we've got to he is
[1:36:52] the thing he was the prophets he was in
[1:36:54] them he was in the Psalms he was in the
[1:36:57] history he isn't things that come the
[1:36:58] same yesterday today and forever Hebrews
[1:37:00] 13:8 he should be then he should be the
[1:37:04] principle if that's what he is we
[1:37:06] believe it don't we
[1:37:08] then he now here's the standoff here I'm
[1:37:11] gonna cook let's say no Fe listen let's
[1:37:13] dismiss is beautiful let's go through
[1:37:14] this he should be the principal theme of
[1:37:17] our talking our thinking our singing of
[1:37:23] our walks for the RAM says he should be
[1:37:28] the principal theme of our life if he's
[1:37:32] the principal theme of the Bible and the
[1:37:35] Bible's in us then he should be the
[1:37:37] principal theme of everything we do
[1:37:39] say or think should be Christ a is that
[1:37:46] beautiful church some of these quotes
[1:37:48] we've heard for all these years some of
[1:37:50] the most beautiful quotes come right out
[1:37:52] of here he's the principal theme of all
[1:37:56] of our lives now let me just close with
[1:38:00] this thought brother branham said that
[1:38:05] God in his mind had a three-fold purpose
[1:38:07] to express himself and you probably know
[1:38:09] it but listen anyway the first was to
[1:38:12] reveal himself fully through Jesus
[1:38:15] Christ the church guess what it took
[1:38:18] 4,000 years for him to accomplish that
[1:38:19] first purpose he's so patient just took
[1:38:23] him four days because that one day with
[1:38:25] the Lord as the thousand years with man
[1:38:27] scepter four days he finally
[1:38:29] accomplished his purpose and fully
[1:38:31] expressed himself in Jesus Christ
[1:38:33] now his second purpose program said is
[1:38:35] for God to live in the people that
[1:38:38] they'll give him preeminence and he's
[1:38:41] been doing that for the last two days
[1:38:43] and his third purpose was to bring his
[1:38:49] bride back to the Eden conditions they
[1:38:52] had at the beginning praise God and he
[1:38:57] says Baretta says this is why I've run
[1:39:00] the tabernacle why have for thirty years
[1:39:03] because this is God's purpose and right
[1:39:07] now what does God trying to do right now
[1:39:09] is he trying to get permits in Christ
[1:39:11] right now no he's already got that
[1:39:13] what's he trying to do now he's trying
[1:39:16] to get preeminence in our lives
[1:39:18] he wants to fully express himself in
[1:39:22] each one of our lives how much you come
[1:39:25] look the piano here how many enjoy this
[1:39:30] tonight we just got through the first
[1:39:33] maybe 40 minutes of the sermon there's
[1:39:35] for our sermon oh it's so beautiful now
[1:39:43] with that in mind how many want to see
[1:39:45] more of Christ in our myths praise God
[1:39:47] we should never get tired of say in that
[1:39:49] church I honestly my heart I don't get
[1:39:51] tired of saying that
[1:39:52] I always want to see more of Christ
[1:39:55] think about we've said that for years
[1:39:57] and think about now we just heard Sunday
[1:40:00] that now God is talking to people right
[1:40:02] in their homes they're getting healed
[1:40:03] right in their homes amen
[1:40:09] more we want to see them more in our
[1:40:12] lives I want to go home and I want to
[1:40:18] hear my children say the Lord spoke to
[1:40:20] me in a dream I heard the voice of God
[1:40:24] how do you want to hear that praise the
[1:40:26] Lord we want to hear more we want to see
[1:40:30] more of the Word of God we want Christ
[1:40:34] to be the principal theme of everything
[1:40:35] we say all day
[1:40:37] he's the theme behind it everything we
[1:40:41] do all of our Christian walk he should
[1:40:43] be the theme behind all of it when I go
[1:40:47] to teach the real the theme hi my
[1:40:50] teaching is to present Jesus Christ to
[1:40:52] the children when I come to church and
[1:40:56] preach my desire my theme behind that is
[1:40:59] the preach to you Jesus Christ when I go
[1:41:04] home
[1:41:06] kiss the children goodnight my theme
[1:41:09] behind that is to present them Jesus
[1:41:12] Christ babe glory and this is our desire
[1:41:19] aren't you glad your pictures all placed
[1:41:21] together right thank you
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:31] hallelujah no puzzles puzzles can be
[1:41:36] very frustrating can't they especially a
[1:41:41] thousand Peter but you just give a
[1:41:45] little time just keep looking at the the
[1:41:49] completed picture keep looking at the
[1:41:50] box cover and start finding those
[1:41:52] patterns and pretty soon you'll start
[1:41:55] seeing the patterns that's what I do
[1:41:56] when I read the Bible I read over there
[1:41:58] in Ecclesiastes that's an interesting
[1:42:00] pattern I look over there to the the
[1:42:03] picture of Jesus Christ ah I can see
[1:42:05] what's happening there I understand now
[1:42:08] yes fearing God keeping the commandments
[1:42:10] that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:12] did you catch that on Sunday the whole
[1:42:15] conclusion of man the whole conclusion
[1:42:18] is to fear God and keep his Commandments
[1:42:20] you and I can't keep any word unless
[1:42:23] we're born to get amen
[1:42:24] we'll never keep all the Word of God
[1:42:26] we'll never fear God all the days of our
[1:42:28] life we're born again it's the principle
[1:42:34] theme with the Bible Jesus Christ is the
[1:42:37] principal theme in the Bible probably
[1:42:39] want to be the principal theme of your
[1:42:40] day tomorrow
[1:42:43] me too I want to be the principal theme
[1:42:46] of tomorrow this weekend services
[1:42:48] another bender on next Wednesday night I
[1:42:50] want to be the principal theme of next
[1:42:52] Wednesday night all the preaching all
[1:42:55] the singing is to do one thing to
[1:42:56] worship Jesus
[1:42:58] to make it more go in our lives let's
[1:43:04] bow our heads if you had a need just
[1:43:05] make it known unto God Heavenly Father
[1:43:08] we just bow our heads Lord Lord you're
[1:43:10] the principal theme of our lives the
[1:43:13] principal theme of this church Lord God
[1:43:16] the principal theme of our thoughts
[1:43:18] right now our songs we're going to sing
[1:43:20] you're the whole purpose behind it and
[1:43:22] not to hear how good our voices sound we
[1:43:27] didn't come here to hear about how good
[1:43:29] we are we came to hear about your
[1:43:31] promises amen
[1:43:33] your word your grace to us as we know
[1:43:37] we're all wretched of our own ability
[1:43:40] we're all sinners but we are all saved
[1:43:43] by your amazing grace amen
[1:43:45] Alleluia our picture Lord is placing you
[1:43:51] Lord at the very centre everything's
[1:43:55] lined up perfectly we see we're in the
[1:43:58] Laodicean Church age we're see we're at
[1:44:00] the very end we see we're in a lukewarm
[1:44:02] age that's rich Ms Brown increased with
[1:44:06] Goods and hasni to nothing but we're the
[1:44:08] ones that have repented were the ones
[1:44:10] who are zealous repented and were the
[1:44:13] ones that are hungry for more of God the
[1:44:15] churches say we've got enough mayor
[1:44:17] we've got enough preaching as our sister
[1:44:21] Karen said they preached a 12 minute
[1:44:22] sermon on Sunday at the Methodist Church
[1:44:25] Oh God thank you Lord that the people
[1:44:27] were so hungry we can preach two hour
[1:44:30] long sermons Lord and they can keep
[1:44:33] feasting on and keep enjoying it keep
[1:44:35] living off the word of God because it is
[1:44:38] their life how to do you my father were
[1:44:42] not promotion but we're just thankful
[1:44:44] Lord that our picture looks right that
[1:44:47] you allowed us to see the picture the
[1:44:49] right way you placed each piece of the
[1:44:52] puzzle in its right position and Lord
[1:44:55] now we ask that you have the preeminence
[1:44:57] in our lives dear
[1:44:59] I'm not ashamed to say Lord take more
[1:45:02] preeminence my life Lord thank you for
[1:45:06] speaking please or people in our church
[1:45:08] in an audible voice in our homes dear
[1:45:11] God that it Lord to me that's the
[1:45:14] treasure that Solomon wrote about in
[1:45:16] Proverbs we said treasures in the
[1:45:18] chambers
[1:45:19] I wonder what chamber our sister was in
[1:45:21] a bed and in that treasure she did find
[1:45:25] the Lord God that you would abandon her
[1:45:27] she found the treasure hey man
[1:45:29] she found the treasure of the oil of the
[1:45:31] Holy Ghost speaking to her answering her
[1:45:36] prayer that we agreed on in this church
[1:45:38] dear God amen hallelujah may you always
[1:45:43] be the principal theme of our church of
[1:45:46] our prayers of our songs that you be the
[1:45:51] very focus may you be the very heartbeat
[1:45:54] of our lives may we love one another
[1:45:57] dear God
[1:45:58] may we not let Satan inject any poison
[1:46:01] that would divide us but may we clean
[1:46:03] that much closer together as we see the
[1:46:06] Day approaching give your people Lord a
[1:46:09] submissive heart give me a submissive
[1:46:11] heart that we might put you first in our
[1:46:14] lives more dear God one of these days
[1:46:18] you're gonna tell us to open that
[1:46:20] present for a body change Lord God it's
[1:46:23] a secret right now but one day it's
[1:46:25] going to be come around it's laying
[1:46:26] right here in this Bible and our eyes
[1:46:28] just haven't really seen it the way we
[1:46:30] ought to see it yet it's not truly
[1:46:31] revealed to us Lord something we're
[1:46:34] missing but Lord and your perfect timing
[1:46:36] it'll be time to open that father we
[1:46:40] look forward to that help us to stay
[1:46:42] faithful Lord God until that time
[1:46:45] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[1:46:48] said amen praise God hallelujah honey
[1:46:53] love the Lord tonight this is the reason
[1:46:57] brother Ram did all he did for all those
[1:46:59] years was God's great mystery he wanted
[1:47:03] to reveal what was in God's mind showing
[1:47:06] us that we just got to put Christ first
[1:47:08] in everything we do praise God
[1:47:12] thank you Jesus Lydia pop those lyrics

[1:47:28] of the puzzle we don't see yet that's
[1:47:31] got to be the rapture right that's the
[1:47:34] RAM said he said as far as I can see the
[1:47:36] only thing that hasn't been fulfilled
[1:47:37] yet is the rapture
[1:47:39] maybe the squeeze there's probably some
[1:47:40] things about the squeeze maybe not
[1:47:42] fulfilled yet but almost the entire
[1:47:44] picture is it all plan except a few
