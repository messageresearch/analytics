our feeble efforts Lord God and may your spirit come anoint us and strengthen us Lord God we thank you for nor the songs that we can sing the guiness of the right atmosphere in us in the right mood spiritually Lord to receive your word thank you Lord God now Lord as the word comes forth may we have a good heart in the hottest heart Lord a hungry heart that these seeds can fall upon and Lord let the waters of the Holy Spirit all on our ground and it might water seeds we've we heard on Sunday and lower last Wednesday in the years past Lord that this rainfall Lord that a water and bring forth fruit Lord God to thy great name Lord how we love you tonight Lord anointing every person here Lord and those livestreaming Lord we trust you'll do it God for your great namesake in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen praise God god bless you let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 here tonight hopefully everybody got my text today about this weekend's schedule sorry didn't get out sooner just kind of forgot about it but by God's grace we got it but like - I said do a Bible study tonight but I was before I knew brother any men was coming then when he comes it feels like we just need to have a service you know cuz he does such a good job at song leading so but I did say I'll try to keep the sermon a little shorter here tonight by God's grace personally I just got to watch you know my physical health as I tell you many times when my voice went out a couple years ago is actually on Easter when my voice went out a fuse we miss some some of you might remember that I was preaching like this for Easter and I told the Lord I said lord if you let my voice come back I'll try to do a better job of taking care of my body and so I've been trying to do that I preached twice on Sunday I preached Tuesday morning a Bible Club gotta preach tonight free Sunday for each Friday so three four five six times this week okay two three four five yeah six times this week so all things are possible God's with me I just gotta say God give me grace there's nothing we love more than the Word of God so it's a privilege for me to do it I just gotta take care of my temple and I know it's a privilege for you to hear God's Word as well because there's nothing good I can say only if Jesus would would inspire me to say it so let's go to Ephesians 5 let's go to verse 10 I want to look at part 17 here on purpose again and we'll just look at redeeming the time again you know we spent both services on Sunday you know looking at redeeming the time and I want to get a little bit further on this and hopefully it'll be a blessing tonight I don't have any slides salud a little you know if we're about switching over I didn't have time to get slides up there he is five verse 10 and this way I like to do I like to do verse 10 don't you we like to prove what's acceptable to God that's why we preach and study is to prove this is the perfect will of God and that's the permissive will of God but we're gonna do the perfect will of God seasons 5:10 proving what is acceptable unto the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it's a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light now that's quite a statement there anytime your life shines on people's lives and they say mine I didn't know that you know you shared that with me and I was I'm in sin anytime you do that you are manifesting the light of God or someone says mine maybe they don't say it out loud but they get convicted alright this brother lives like this this sister lived like this I'm convicted anytime you do that you are the light of Christ manifested see whatever makes manifest is light verse 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give the light he men now that reminds us of the foolish virgins right the wise and foolish virgins they're waking from their sleep right and that God Christ has given us light see then that you walk circumspectly that means precisely not as fool's but as wise to see foolish virgins they just kind of from here wander to here wonder there a lot of them just wonder from this church to that church to that church it's different if God's calling you but it's it's foolish if it's just well I don't like that too much and I'll just try something else you know without a divine call from the Holy Spirit redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will the Lord is and be not drunk on wine which it wearing is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord wow this is a real wise Christian life right here talking about the word talking about songs spiritual songs making melody in your heart to God and now you're wise um like this giving thanks always for all things unto God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ let's have one more word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord take this word Lord we've opened it we've read it break it to your people break it to me and father just continue to minister to us Lord hears we've heard the songs and here we're here to be finding our weak spots as your prophets said Lord and become better Christians and so father we just ask that your Holy Spirit will take control I yield myself to you Lord just may be a faithful servant in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you didn't see - praise God so got a little outline you know what like I said I don't have slides today but I got a little outline like I like to preach on this is quite a great text you know Ephesians chapter 5 it's building and of course this all these scriptures built into the marriage scriptures and so it's quite it's quite wonderful to see how paul is led of the Holy Spirit to get into this before he gets into marriage and how a marriage glorifies God he starts by saying your life will manifest the light of Christ and you you by your life you will either you'll manifest the people what's right and what's wrong you are the light of the world and then he goes in this showing how we must walk of our all of our decisions must be effect which means precise so we should know precisely what God wants us to do praise God but in the moment I remember remember have said though the will of God is a mystery right God's will is a mystery so that's what we must seek out and God kind of plays this hide-and-seek kind of game right God now it's not a game but it's a hide-and-seek romance can I say like that you see it in the Song of Solomon you know they get married and then the Bible said in a couple of chapters she wakes up and wants to find her beloved so she goes out looking for her beloved have you seen my beloved where is he and they said oh he's gone down to the garden right so she's got to seek him out there's other times at one time he's knocking at the door and she doesn't want to get out of her her bed she's a little slothful by the time she gets there she opens the door he's gone right and then she has to say she's sorry I preach on that a few years ago a little series on but it's like this hide-and-seek romance and that's how God is like Jesus said God hides it from the wise and the prudent but reveals it to babe's such as we learn it's a great hide-and-seek romance but once you find Christ then he reveals his will to you and he reveals what we should do of course I'll never forget when I asked God to show me or am I supposed to preacher not just vindicated to me so I know and I didn't really realize the brother he meant but I was actually asking God is this your will for my life or not I didn't really realize it but in that when I prayed him fasted and asked him for the vindication God gave me the vindication and I never had a doubt after that I've had some doubts or some fears you know from time to time we go through that but I never had to doubt after that because God had vindicated to me and we've got to remember like David the times God has answered our prayer like when David's through the line when David's through the bear he had to remember to use those testimonies for his next battle and that's what we've got to do too we've got to use our previous victories as as evidence and encouragement to go into our next battle and that's what I'll do it was times I struggle I look back and the a spirit will bring to remembrance remember when I did that remember when I blessed you there when I remember when I answered your prayer there remember what I gave you an amen to your ministry I guess I'm picking on you today but I'm sorry don't want to pick on anybody but I know he can take it but God you know God so we look back and we remember when when God does things we've got to use that and then that gives us strength going forward so God will reveal his perfect will to us if we just ask him but then we got to really ask right in faith believing and you have to see God with all your heart and then you'll find him that's the trouble when people don't know the will of God it's because they haven't sought it with all their hearts they've given 50 percent of their effort maybe you know 70 percent their effort 75 but we want to give a hundred percent effort to say lord I really need to know show it to me help me to lay aside everything that I might know your will for my life that's one of the twelve mysteries of the New Testament if you count those up that's one of the mysteries because Paul said in Ephesians 1 he's made known to us the mystery of his will so wise virgins walk circumspectly redeeming the time and that's I looked it up again today that's the only time the word redeem sorry that's the only time the word redeem is ever used with something connected to us and not to Christ look in your concordance sometime look up redeem its word redeemed by the blood we're redeemed by the Savior redeemed by it's always referring to Jesus but there's one time right here where Paul says you and I have something to redeem and that's the time the precious time that God gives us now Paul says when you when you understand God's will you're wise you'll buy back that time so in order to buy something what do you got to do you got to give up something right how many want to redeem the time how many want to buy the time back well you got to give up something for that right so let's go to Colossians I believe it's chapter power yeah the Colossians 4 sorry verse 1 and next we'll look at Holy Days and Holy Week you know on Facebook I'm a friends a lot of people family members and they put up all these things about Oh Holy Week Holy Week best week of the year now programmed it's a it's a holy time of the year but the trouble there's a lot of people that emphasize that the rest year they go hog-wild with the world and I'll be honest the people that I've seen pump up holy day they pump up Buckeyes football more than Holy Week right or they they pump up Halloween or Thanksgiving or Christmas they pump up Santa Claus more than they pump up Holy Week so see you really find out which one you really love more by your fruits right by your fruits you know them by their actions like I don't see them saying oh there's let's do a countdown there's 97 days till Holy Week no but they'll post there's 120 days till kickoff of the football season Church by their fruits they're known right we see and we'll get to this a little bit it's okay to have special times of seeking the Lord that's fine but and that that's a great Christian Liberty we have but we've got to make sure that every day and every week is a holy day and that there's just some that are more holy than others right I mean we got to give a little more effort sometimes than others so Colossians 4 1 and there's a great balance that and I kind of want to look at that tonight oh and I forgot there's one great prayer I need to remember at the end I talking to a school employee and they said there they work at the middle school and they said some of their their students have gone to the high school and now they're they have no gender they've changed their name so they're genderless and they just told me with with almost like sadness like can you pray for them I'm like yes so I had a reminder on my phone but I forgot well let's remember try to remind me to pray if I forget let's pray for those that we can if I can talk to them that's what I want to try to do I want to see if I know some of them so I can talk to them about it but I was able to get booked and she said yeah I'd be happy to read that so I'm really thankful Colossians 4 1 masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that you also have a master in heaven continue in prayer and watching the same with Thanksgiving with all praying also for us that God would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ for which I'm also in bounds the bonds that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak so here's a man then I love this scripture this scripture means a lot to me Paul says pray for me that I'll have more boldness and that God will open a door of utterance all right that I may speak the mystery of Christ which is the Godhead right the mystery of Christ because he mentions that in Colossians chapter 2 and he says I ought to speak like this so that we ought to take courage that sometimes even a prophet of God isn't as bold as he needs to be they don't encourage us to know that he's human and a prophet a sort of lie upon more Holy Spirit just like you and I need to rely upon more of the Holy Spirit prophets go through up and downs prophets goes through hills and valleys and if prophets goes through hill and valley then the rest of the bride goes through his and valleys the rest of the rides needs to pray God give me strength give me grace open doors to me help me to be more bold he said pray for me Church you church in Kalasha brave for me that I'll have doors open in the verse 5 walking wisdom toward them with our that are without redeemed the time remember wisdom means deep understanding if you look up the Greek it means a deep understanding of the word of God not just a superficial but a deep understanding to know what God wants done with the word and here's how you do it verse 6 let your speech be always with grace you know we shouldn't go around condemning people I know you don't but just a reminder right we got to be careful let there be grace God may have see on these children you know or these high schoolers that are getting confused with gender you know that's a right may God have mercy they gotta have mercy on my dad or my mother they got God have mercy so we should always speak with Grace in our hearts seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man at church I'll be honest you can do that if you watch the Scriptures you read in the morning before you go out and talk to people watch those scriptures because God many times will use some of those and reminding you what to say when you see people that day how many how do you ever see Matt what happens all the time when I go to Bible club with middle schoolers or the elementary it'll be something I read and one of the children will say something about it or the one of the leaders will say something about it like I just read that this morning it happens like constantly so watch what you say because there's a reason you read your Bible every morning so that scripture is on your heart it's ready to go and then you'll know how to answer every man now I just want to stop right there so there's really just two times in the Bible where it says you and I can redeem something in the New Testament okay and that's what it is redeeming the time buying back that time so if you're buying something you got to lose something and the thing you lose is your own will of what you want to do with your time you gotta say God show me how should I spend my time this morning or God how should I spend my free time right how should I spend my day off how should I spend my again how should I spend my Saturday how should I spend my evening after work we gotta have enough wisdom right we gotta have enough circumspect circumspect steps right precise steps we got to know precisely what God would have us to do amen I know that's saying a lot Church I know it is remember you need to you need to rest your body right you got to take care of your body you got to take care of your mind you need that you need to take vacations you do you do brother Rancic occasions jesus took vacations short ones but you and i need to take vacations in this rest get our strength back get our meditation back invest invest in time with god almighty remember that's what remember that Daniel did that remember when he got that 21 week or sorry 21 day prayer answer the Bible said he prayed and fasted for three weeks and he was 70 years old I saw that this morning I was going through my notes a 70 year old servant to the government said can I take a three-week vacation and they gave it to him so he could go fast and pray by the river Ahava what a vacation huh that's a prophets idea of vacation you thought what maybe a cruise well maybe got to lead you on that I'm not said I'm not here to say you wouldn't but I'm saying is that look what look what he desire he desired God in my free time I want to know you tomorrow now you can go on a cruise and see God more but you better be careful of all the all the riffraff can I say like that of all the temptation you got to have a real spiritual mind see because a lot of people on that cruise ship are not seeking God and that's not a very good atmosphere so I'm just trying to share some basic thoughts about redeeming the time by God's grace and those are the only two those are the two scriptures where you and I can redeem something now let's go to romans 14:5 i want to just balance this out to you know every year i got to battle this you know like i said i'm when i'm on facebook or i talked to my friends and well I'm doing Lent and that's just a short battle sent a long battle what's a short battle because people they seem to be so sincere and they seem to me sacrificing but in all reality it's not it's not a real genuine sacrifice because it's just a temporary sector except for sacrifice right forty days and who knows if all those people actually make it through the forty days they probably got to repent many times and say okay God forgive me and they're giving up things like Facebook or chocolate or like a sugary drink they're giving up pop like the zakat you I mean yeah it's good to take care of your body but does that get you closer to the kingdom of God given up Diet Pepsi for 40 days of course not but see look at the Bible says here one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day like let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind so let's the Christian liberties are our decisions you have and whether you do it or not it doesn't it's not sin and Paul says respect people who make one day holy and another day not holy Paul says respect them okay I'm not going to go through maybe all the scriptures I pulled it up in chapter 5 of my book I have a whole long section on Christian liberties so if you like to understand it I think I gave everybody copy you could read that if you want to but the main thing is that no matter what it is look at verse 6 the main thing is be thankful so when you see churches all we're really going to dedicate this week to God you should be thankful for that hopefully you know they're sincere enough where God can speak to him he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and He that regardeth not the day to the Lord he not does not regard it he that eateth eateth to the Lord where he for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to Lord he give I'm sorry he eateth not and giveth God thanks let's read verse 7 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself so the main thing church is that we give Thanksgiving from what I remember from from the text on Christian liberties the main thing is that you give thanks so when you hear o my church is having special meetings thank the Lord when our church has special meetings thank the Lord and hopefully you do hopefully when we have guest ministers in or like this Friday we have a special Friday service hopefully you consider a time where I can draw closer to the Lord I'm going to try to live closer to Lord but if not be thankful that some people are right because that's what Paul says it's your Christian Liberty because the Bible does in the New Testament doesn't give us specific holy days where you need to live more holy on the new moon you know or you need to live more holy around Easter time the fact is if you got the Holy Ghost you're living holy all the time that's what the new birth is all about him that's what the Sabbath is all about as we went over last week right that's the true rest you rest from sinning and you're living to righteousness that's what the new birth is all about now go to Colossians here let me pull it up cautions 2:16 and this is the one where you know I've just been able to I've been able to stand on this when the Saturday Sabbatarians trying to corner me I said well you know this is what Paul said look what the Word of God says verse 16 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or the Sabbath days so you don't let somebody judge you so you don't don't feel judge like oh I'm not keeping Saturday like I ought to verse 17 which are shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ see those are all shadows sabbath days holy days those are all shadows but the reality is Christ in other words a day doesn't make you holy Christ makes you holy that's what makes you holy it's Christ because those are all shadows Church they would take can you imagine being a Jew would be a blessing in some ways you had seven days for unleavened bread and you'd have to didn't have to work right and then in August and September you have like 14 days off for David oh man you know a Bernanke's yeah you have all these holidays note on your schedule some dives were a little bit spiritually jealous of that but not really because we got the blood of Christ right you understand I'm see it's cuz it though really is it's Christ Christ makes us free and we don't have to wait til boy I can't wait to that one day in September when I can be forgiven ah I can be forgiven right now of all the years past sins and my failures I can be forgiven now because the true retirement is now on the throne of God and I don't need pastor Jesse or if I had just been there out I don't need in this house offer the sacrifice for me because my high priest Jesus Christ Artie did it amen of course you appreciate the prayers of your pastor evangelist but they can't is it's not their sacrifice it's God that Christ is the one mediator between God and man to see it's it's uh it's it's something that we must guard our hearts and not feel condemned or judged because we don't have candle light services like other churches right which that's fine but a candle I see a lot of people that have the natural candle but don't got the spiritual candle that's right they then write that candle goes out they got their custom drinking get drunk and all that kind of things like that and as soon as Easter is here brother Haven they get right back to their diet soda or their chocolate or coffee or whatever they give up and they think that's real Christianity not Church you and I know that's not real Christianity but we should give thanks if somebody esteems this this is all the time thank god they're trying maybe one day God will open their eyes and they can see that you can give up chocolate forever or you can give up whatever the main thing is to give up a desire to sin give up a love for the world and have a love for the word of God Jesus Christ that's the main thing that people got to do we all got to do it now so I hope you can that through the scripture when we redeem the time we make every day a holy day in fact I I never I'll be honest I never feel any different on Easter Sunday than any other day I'm fasten user Sunday morning I'm passin usually every Saturday morning I'm fasting I mean it just it feels the same to me now sometimes you've seen it too sometimes I'll come in here I feel more annoying to than others right you too sometimes you're more anointed than other times and we thank God for those but it's not something we religiously mechanically have to schedule out now let me say this God honors though routine sacrifice like look at the Louisiana camp how many ever heard of that they have it right around Easter every year I mean hundreds of people say they get the Holy Ghost they're young people and it's not like a world well I mean people stream it worldwide people from all over the United States go there they're probably on their way right now Wendy's been there many times brother Brooks been there Simon and cam have all been there people get great experiences there because there's such expectation now God honors that every year not because they say this is a holier day than others but God honors it because there's so much sacrifice built into it they pray up to it there's people that sacrifice you know letting people say it their home there's extra prayers going into it people that cook for other people there's all these sacrifices in church God will honor anyone that sacrifices with a sincere heart God will honor those who honor him that's what God told Samuel even as a young child God told Samuel that I'll honor anyone that honors me so we must remember that too and there are times to seek the Lord more closely obviously and God will honor our sacrifice now one of they've got a few examples here so you can see this here about diligence and redeeming the time oh and look at these again now let's go back to 2nd Peter chapter 1 let's go over the statue for a man just again here I want to lay the out as a reminder second Peter chapter one like I said I try to do little Bible study right now I think I like to start a verse let's just get right to it at verse verse five yeah sorry verse 5 2nd Peter 1:5 and beside this giving all diligence now that means earnestness how many ever been earnest for a meal you've been really hungry anyone ever been earnest how about earnest for a celebration like or how about a wedding well I can't wait for this wedding of my wedding I was pretty earnest for my way very earnest so that's what the word earnest means excited anticipating it so Peter says giving all earnestness in verse five add to your faith virtue that means you say my I can't wait God give me virtue you've given me faith Oh give me virtue Lord I'm so earnest for it I'm hungry for it amen and this is redeeming the time right and your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge to your knowledge temperance to temperance patience and patience godliness and the godless relic kindness and a brotherly kindness charity for these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ so see you need the virtues of sanctification glory and the baptism only goes charity in order to produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit all right but he the lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten the knee was purged from his own old sins the people can forget that they're forgiven they can at one time believe I've forgiven thank God but if they don't keep growing and earnestly hungry for more of God and that they get stagnant they'll feel like sinners again right so we've got to be careful that if we ever feel like we're a sinner again it's because we're not saying God add to me add to me see we're not hungry on the thirsting for the things of God we must have just been whether we you know whether we tried to or not or you know whether we got tricked or deceived or whatever we were just feeding on the wrong thing we got a fiend say God add to me earnestly Lord I need more of this more patience more virtue more knowledge give me more faith we if we feed on that and if we're diligent for that then we'll produce the right fruit but if now we'll feel like am I even saved am I even forgiven I hope you've been praying your prayer closet it's been good for me this week like last week I put on the helmet of the salvation I know I'm saved because I met God's requirement I've repent and I've been baptized in Jesus Christ's name fill with the Holy Spirit say again tell me I'm not saying brother because I got the helmet of salvation on I know I'm saying you got to have that on but see if we don't if we don't constantly see desire lord give me more of yours it's Wednesday night I'm tired I worked all day that's fine no one give me more of your word help me just forget about my flesh for a couple hours so I can earnestly and diligently receive from you you see that's why people forget they're saved they forget what it felt like to be baptized do you member what it's like does everybody remember what it's feel it felt like when you got baptized the right way Oh glory you ought to felt good did you forget I hope you didn't forget that means you're not adding right we need to remember what was that like oh oh like I was bribe and now I see you praise God yeah like I always used to be a leper but I lost all my leprosy and now I'm clean in Jesus name I used to feel odd and dirty around people like bo-ram said before your your sanctified you just kind of feel dirty around the believers and you try to fit in but when you've been washed you just fit in with everybody you're saying oh it's just those if we can all talk and have a good old see you're not ashamed because you've been washed you've seen the spots this all they men you've seen your leprosy healed and you know I'm one of them you're not wondering am I even saved I'm Ivan the messenger does God even love me right you know you're not worried about that you know you've been saved you've seen God do it you've seen God find you as a little lamb put you on his shoulder bring you into the flock here just be with all these other humble sheep mad man and we all just fellowship all together as a great flock of God amen you remember the view from up on the shoulder you remember that glory look at me I'm flying up in the heavenlies brace God look at this view I'm oh I'm an earthbound creature look I'm flying up here like an eagle glory not the mixed thing you know you're both Eagle and lamb right you know you're both of those you're kid like a lamb daily but then you got the noid thing of an eagle right now look verse 10 therefore for the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling election sure so see your eagerness to do something for Christ will prove to everybody which side you're left on which side you're chosen on amen but man there's a quote maybe I can pull it up well Graham said there's one thing I know it's a real proof someone's born again they just have a great desire to do something for the Lord praise God and that's what the scripture is saying give diligence to make it sure in other words prove to everybody that you're a bride member prove to them you're not foolish proved by your life give all your earnestness give all your effort give all your diligence all your strength to prove to everybody which side you're on prove to everybody that you've got oil in your lamp and you're not saying oh brother Amen can you give me some errand can you give me some of your anointing please sir please please would you would you would you give me some of your anointing here you know you have to go up and ask people about that because you've already gone to Jesus and got the anointing or you go get a fresh anointing every morning or every night whenever you have your prayer time see you're not leaning upon anyone else you're leaning upon Christ see and that proves to everyone prove to them that you're called to be a preacher prove that you're a song leader prove to everybody which get this in your life prove it and the way you do that is by giving all human effort to that that's right and that's what we'll see just next in a moment but look at this for if you do these things you'll never fall see if you constantly just focus on what God called you to do and give all your energy give all your attention to that the Bible says you'll never fall from grace hey man hallelujah look at brother Branham he never quit me in a profit right Satan tried to trick him with that complex we looked at on Sunday night Satan tried to trick him to get out of give being more diligent he wanted to just go up in the mountains cuz he thought you know Old Testament prophet I should be up there but God said no you stay amongst the people aren't you glad yeah if you do these things if you constantly just pour into the ministry God gave you then you'll never fall that's right Church so you've got to be careful that God doesn't I'm sorry that we don't let Satan distract us from our calling in life so let's go to first Timothy 4 and look at this a little closer first for now while you're turning there just remember that Peter ends that chapter by talking about if you do this you'll have an entrance into heaven so God will open up heaven's gates to you if you just focus on doing God's will for your life just pour yourself be eager to do God's calling and say God add to me God I need more of you if you do that God's got to open heavens doors for you and then he says I will put you always in remembrance even though you know these things I'm trying to stir you up by putting you remember members of these things that's what I'm trying to deny stir the people up praise God remember this is what you're calling to be this is what a Christian should be you don't want to fall you want to keep standing you don't want to fall off that that highway to heaven amen you don't want to fall off the way of holiness you want to let the right Road stir you up keep earnest be diligent focus on what God's called you to do and if you need a ministry let me know if any of you guys I should say guys forgive me if any brothers or sisters sorry sometime gonna get a little flesh you know many of you Saints here help me Lord a little tired you know I got up at 4:30 this morning help me Jesus try to drink coffee and my flesh but if any of you saves in a ministry let me know I mean one ministry I have is you can pray for me another ministry is you could mail out books I mean I've I have a list of people with addresses to mail out books if anybody needs a ministry and I'll pay you for your time you know whatever or if you need a ministry I could help you out on that because one the Bible said we should have we should be addicted to the ministry of the Saints I believe I believe in setting postcards out the sinners we did that last year but there's something about a ministry to the Saints that God loves as well because a lot of those people are never gonna be saved we've got to give them a chance but there's something about God loves when we're so focused on his children because remember Jesus and I won't even pray for the sinners remember he said that in John 17 he said I don't pray for the world I pray for them that has heard the word through me so Jesus wouldn't I he wouldn't waste his prayers on now sinners now we're not Jesus so we don't know who's gonna be saved so we should pray for all men the Bible said Paul said pray for all men prayers for all men the Bible says so I'm just trying to bring a balance now 1st Timothy 4 let me turn the airside I just got the surrounding scripture now if you know this this is like Paul's word to the young preacher Timothy Timothy was an evangelist now brother Graham called him a pastor as well but in this book Paul calls him an evangelist he's that member do the work of an evangelist but look at verse 12 first Timothy 4:12 let no man despise thy youth well I'm too young I can't really serve the Lord Paul said don't let anybody despise your youth don't worry about people looking down upon you he says but instead be an example of the believers in Word in conversation and charity and spirit and faith and impurity till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation and to doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given me by prophecy with laying on of the hands of the presbytery now let's stop right there Timothy has a gift of preaching and the church said he has a gift of preaching so Paul tells him here give attendance don't don't let people tell you that you can't live closer to God don't let people tell you that only you know you'll be an example once you're 10 years in the message or 30 years in the message you know wait till you got about 30 years on your bell as a pastor and then then then you'll really be an example then no Paul said take the attitude that I need to be the example right now amen live your life like you are an example of pure Christianity live your life like if there's one person that makes in the rapture it's gonna be you yeah that's right he says you be the example and he said give attendance to what reading preachers need to read apparently Paul thought preachers need to read well I'll just pray all the time and not read and I'll look for inspiration no that's not what he told Timothy you got it you got to do all of that right if you Timothy if you want your gift to grow you've got to read the word to exhortation and the doctrine exhortation is the preaching teaching instructing and the doctrine doctrine is your instruction exactly what you believe remember Jesus preached a lot of doctrine remember his first doctor was the Holy Ghost baptism in John chapter 3 if he does that if he reads preaches and gets doctrines ready then he is not neglecting his gift then he's taking care of his gift he's stirring up his gift yeah now look at verse 15 meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that's what I want to to that thy profiting may appear to all a church this is the real heart of this series of purpose is that you and I will be able to recognize what gift has God place in my life and then you will be so determined to use that gift for God that you'll give yourself wholly to that gift so if you have a gift of divine healing you'll go to your Saturday or Friday before the church services on Sunday you will be praying God used me Lord if I'm there go lay my hands on somebody or use me Lord or if you got to get the music you'll pray and say God just give me the songs that these songs glorify it your your focus is on one thing and that's the glorify God with the gifts in your life like our sister speaks in tongues right she should be she should be praying that Lord if you have a message help me to be ready to receive it just like I got to get my cause if I'm a preacher or if people been heal when I pray for them god I need your help I don't have any thoughts give me your thoughts to feed your people and I've got to give myself wholly to that praise God why that you're profiting may appear to all in other words everybody's going to know whether I'm investing in my gift or not ever he's going to know that right sister Beatrice sister Beatrice been a lot around a long time the message right she knows whether her pastor former pastor current pastor she knows whether he's been investing in his gift or not because the Bible said it appears to everyone praise God and sure let me say this it's not just for pastors it's for everybody if everybody has a gift the court of the Bible then everybody sees if you're investing in that gift or not what if brother let's just use Amen for picking on him tonight let's say he comes to church and he doesn't never do any new songs and then you never when you talk to him you know hey brother hey man you been fax any new songs no I've been going to the baseball games you know it's Indian season and he always wants talk about his Indians not look at this guy hits a homerun nah he's a picture look at this guy under miles per hour you know then you then you and I could tell Oh obviously he's not investing in his gift right but if he's meditating on those things God used me I'm a I'm an instrument you know I'm an instrument to play the instruments so God's people can worship if he's investing into that then his investment will be seen by everybody that's right so will money so will yours when you invest in the gifts God given to you everybody sees it not some but all everybody knows whether you've been praying or not everybody knows whether I've been studying or not that's right church but man said a man that hasn't been studied he'll get there and get all confused he said he won't know where he's going right because he hasn't been studied he hasn't been reading the word like you ought to so remember now this is this is the one thought I had that was new to me here as I was preparing not only does your profiting or not only do the fruits your gift not only are they seen by everyone the church but they're seen by Jesus when you meet him right cuz he's gonna say well done and I gave you five and you now you got ten I gave you two now you got four I gave you one now that guy didn't have any right but that was such a blessing to me you know we should we should in other words we should have an idea because we see the fruits of people's gifts here we should have an idea what Jesus is going to say to them because we should see that people's gifts property now amen uh he's really grown as a song leader but he's really grown in their gift of prophesy or she's really grown in her gift of wisdom or knowledge and understanding boy they're really growing with their gift of miracles how about that these are all these are the nine gifts and all these spirit and once you find your give once you God reveals this gift to you then you've got to invest in that and give yourself wholly to it and then everybody will see you profiting in that area we'll see now that takes all the pressure off of me and puts it on everybody and that's the opposite of the Nicolaitans spirit because the nickel and spirit divides the it puts the lantee versus the preachers and now just the preachers got to have an orgy come on brother give me some anointing tonight come on is that all you got like but you don't realize like the Holy Ghost ones anoint you so you agree with that and you pull on that until you pull something fresh from heaven like it's everybody working together it's everybody with an anointing not just me it's you anointed me anointed and it's heaven's anointing coming down on everybody but see Satan wants to put it all on the preachers and that's wrong it ought to be on the preachers it ought to be on the laity too and that's what that scripture says it's telling evangelists now if a van just need it well then the apostle needs it right and if the apostle needs it then the speaker and tongue needs it then the miracle worker right that's what the Bible says miracle workers who works miracles among you that's in Galatians chapter 5 how do they do that they do it by the Holy Spirit so see that's what I'm openness now that's the core that's that's the whole hope behind this because I want you to meet Jesus Christ and Jesus say I gave you these sounds you doubled them enter the joys of the Lord but I don't want you to go to heaven not knowing why I wonder what my gifts are Laura I wonder what tells you didn't give me I don't want you to meet Christ like that I want to preach to you that you can go to Christ now find out your gifts and you can invest in them and then he'll say well then you've doubled them your profit has appeared to everybody in the church your fruits are obviously in church now they're obvious to me - well hallelujah glory to God amen thank you Jesus it's not just preachers Church they got an answer it's not just preachers everybody's got an answer that's proven my Lot's wife God had to given her something but when the time for separation came to really start manifesting her mother gift right she had to have a mother's gifts she had daughters when it came time to really manifest that and separate from the world she didn't want to separate from the world and she's turned to a pillar of stone or Spiller salt looking back that's where my that's where my treasure is the treasure wasn't there the treasure was in Abraham's camp amen the promised son the coming said the Isaac are the type of rapture amen the body change amen that's where the treasure was at hallelujah I thought I'll just do a Bible study tonight oh yeah there you go pulling again that's good that's the way to do it see so this scripture proves an amen I've been texting a little bit about this over the months now we didn't talk about this tonight but whatever gift you have you got to give yourself full attention to that right you got to pour yourself into that he said give yourself wholly to it not partly wholly don't get part of your time to your gift give yourself wholly to it notice let me give you example you know when I first got the message that after I started pastoring I just needed a hobby and that was one reason I started doing the YouTube videos because I needed a hobby well I found out now is more of like a burden for outreach I called it a hobby at first cuz I just needed something to do in my extra time you know but and I like I like the technology I like doing videos and now the makeup videos got almost 240 thousand views on it there's almost 8000 subscribers and you know the testimonies are in the book they're people saying you saved my soul I fasted three days to know about makeup and there it is you pop up on my YouTube channel and now the book you know I'd spent a year and a half on that book and now one of the pastors about fifty copies one for every family in the book a couple pastors have done that they bought a copy forever in their in their book and so well I'm trying to see is that if I just focus on the Word of God teaching the Word of God that God will take that gift and multiply it and now the influence or the revelation God has given me I believe it's the right revelation can now go forth and it can speak and multiply and spread and the influence the fruit can be greater because all those things I wrote in there I already preached to you and hopefully the pastors will pick them up if there are things that I feel helpful and they can preach you their congregation and then hopefully that would be some fruit on the day on the on that day the day of hope by God's grace that's all I'm trying to say but see this this is what I try to apply this to my life give yourself wholly to it he ever give all your free time to focus on the gifts God given to you that they're profiting will appear to everybody all right so I'm just giving you a just a simple example in my life how I try to see that manifest in my life because listen church you know I'm sure Beatrice can say Amen and County cos Amen they you know you you say in a church long enough and you can see which people are really there and investing in the things of God right you can see the ones that are withering away but you can see people that are feeding and growing and and growing closer to God amen because they're profiting their their fruits appear to everybody everybody and I don't want to be one of those church members or pastors that it's getting hard and hard to preach well I can't preach tonight you know my stomach hurts from eating too much I can't do that you know well I didn't pray and study all week I don't have any revelation let's just play a tape play sit down it's okay to play from time to time I'm not condemning that what I'm saying is that we've got to invest in what God's called us to do be faithful and then the fruits and the profiting appears to everybody and I'm hoping that God shows you your gifts if you don't know your gifts already that God shows you them and you can focus on those I want you to have a narrow focus right I want you to have tunnel vision right I got one thing to do that's to serve my purpose to use the gifts God gave me and everything else I'll be I'll be like those Amish horses right with the blinders I'm not gonna see anything else outside that I'm just gonna see God's will for my life and I'm gonna do what God called me to do amen because your eyes are illuminated by Christ you can see now you're not a foolish person you know what God's got the gifts God giving you and your focus on those and you want to use those for God's glory I tell you hi Laura I'll say like this Lord haste the day when everybody in our church knows their gifts and then they're investing in them every week Oh Bob we're gonna have a real book of Acts search of Enter key Oh when easy the other ones and us older ones and all of us when we can get focus on the gifts God give and just think about that somebody's got to get the maracle's mine if they get dialed in and folk and they invest in miracles we're gonna see more miracles if it's God's season somebody's got to get the prophecy to say thus saith the Lord this is this is gonna happen next week or next year or get tell the body guys Bob think about that the blessings we could see but yeah how rarely has it happened in message churches because is everybody investing in their gifts or not mercy the last time we seen in here we're actually told something was mm I can't remember the year 2009 or 10 maybe 11 where the brother said thus saith the Lord some people are dying spiritually I went and asked the people out for that and three people said they were felt they were dying spiritually that was back at the other Waterloo place and I know at that time that brother was really investing in praying and the gift of tongues and interpretation his life he was really investing in that and that one hit exactly that was right on so see that's what I want you that you and I to do we got to be so focused on what God's called us to do that we can just also we can see in our life yeah I got to go to work I want to take care of my family oh but after that I just want to do what God is I don't invest in the gifts God's given me and mainly church that's just in prayer meditation you know and your free time you don't listen to look at other things you just try to zoom in and focus on what God's called you to do see there's one thing you need for your gift to work let's go to Daniel 2:16 there's one thing you need and I've already said it but let's read it anyway there's one thing you need Church for your gifts to operate Daniel 2:16 Daniel really needed his gift to operate or else Nebuchadnezzar was going to kill him so let's see what what does Daniel do when he's got lights life and death earlier well my liver died god I need you to show up what's one thing he asked for then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him millions of dollars that he would show him that king the interpretation wasn't money Church it wasn't money Daniel said I need one thinking my life's on the line I need one thing I need time with God what do you need more of Trisha time with God I don't have to ask aren't to speak God and say well wonder what the people need it brought a Christ fellowship people need time with God when you're dedicated in prayer seeking God spending time your free times all about the Lord your Redeemer the time amen you brought it back there's one thing Daniel needed he said King give me time the King said sure I'll give you time let's see if this Holy Roller can get it and he sure did save his life and his three friends live amen glory that's what we want to do we would invest in our gifts to save lives to get people filled with the Holy Spirit to get people's eyes on the gospel think what God's called them to do it's one thing he needed to save his life time time with God that's why Paul says redeem the time be wise ah he could have went out he could have went to though he were could've went to somebody else to say help me guys help me he could went to anybody else but he said I needed but the real reality was I got to get alone with God and we get the answer to this this mystery God's gonna reveal the mystery to me yes glory God will reveal to you Church God will reveal all these mysteries to us we just humble ourselves all right let me said timer boy I'm gonna just forget about all that I'm not careful I'll forget about those promises I made to the Lord I don't want to I don't want to do that that's for sure I got numerous scriptures here but let me try to find a place to I might want it closed here so can everybody this all's Daniel needed was more time but how many know what was his testimony he was disciplined right he had his body he made his body pray how many times a day everybody knows three you'd have to wonder how many times of Daniel prayed a you knew because the Bible says so he was so disciplined he morning prayer above everything else he put noontime prayer above everything else when it came to evening he made sure evening prayer was more important than everything else did God make it God make everything else fit into his schedule yeah sure did how'd he know cuz heaven called him beloved that's how you know he said all day to the angels and all day and you'll greatly beloved of the Lord I had to wrestle 21 days but now your answers here amen God sent another angel Michael to help me up so I could answer your prayer heaven loves you heaven sent extra backup support to get me your answer amen hallelujah that's what we need we need backup support from angels amen but first let's have a disciplined life praise God first let's know what gifts have you given me god what on earth am I here for amen and let me invest in that so I can do something for your kingdom so know this a lot of this is review church but I wonder how many of us are living this right how many one live all this by God's good that's my heart's desire then I can count everything else is done it's all done it's awesome it's a it's all just evil it's all unpleasant anything from the world's unpleasant but what's pleasant to me is Christ and the gifts he's placed in my life remember church see a brother BAM said gets the greatest rebuke because they got slain not by evil rulers and getting their heads cut off but he said they got slain by riches and cares of this life can you imagine it and slain by riches and and cares of this life that's what killed your spiritual life oh I want to have more money I want to have an easier life and so you gave your full attention to those things and neglected the spiritual gifts God gave you and that's what Jesus rebukes them and has nothing good to say about this age because most people have sold out their gifts and they're gone after natural gifts money okay you know easy living soft living the convenience is luxuries in life and so Jesus said they get the worst rebuke and the early church you know they had to die for their faith and now look we we just got we can live however yeah we can live as close to God as we want we'd have to worry about losing our lives thank God for that we've got to make the most of a church I hope you want to make the most of it cannot forget that let's share something here for the sisters let's go to back to Luke 236 here you know we're a church with a lot of sisters and we appreciate that I thank the Lord I got a lot of sisters in my little house there God's will for us Luke 236 maybe God's gonna raise up some Myriam's around here with some tambourines and we'll have a sister's train of tambourine players and dancers are out here don't worry lots I'll take that amen I'll take that above a five girl basketball team any day of the week or a six six girl team volleyball team I could care less about that let's get those tambourine players and dancers amen hallelujah if it worked for Moses it'll work for us Laurie Luke 236 and there was one Anna a prophetess the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of ah sure she was of a great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity next thing and she was a widow about fourscore and 84 years old which departed not from the temple but served God with fasting and prayers night and day now Paul's right there so get it you know she lived very faithful to her husband so she was faithful to her family faithful to her husband who and her husband died she said fine God's taking that ministry from me now I'm gonna live at the house of God oh my how would we like that oh not tonight you don't believe you can just stay in the house of God and now her ministry went from family husband it went to God through prayer and fasting this is now her ministry did she give herself half-heartedly to it or did she give herself wholly to it holy you can say well I'll move a little closer to church now that's what that's actually good thing we could do Simon is trying to move closer to this church you know the scam church he's trying to sell his house now move closer that's a good thing sometimes I think about that too but I never you know I don't know how to pray about that don't really like our house but she said fine since God's God's finished God has closed this ministry and now I've got a different ministry and I'm gonna serve God with all I with all my heart and look how God blessed her her ministry was prayer and fasting just helping out the church helping out the church nothing fancy and you know there wasn't many people praying and fasting there's not many people praying and fasting today and if I wasn't many people praying and fasting then that's not the ministry like I got to tell people oh no we got plenty of people praying and fasting you don't worry about that right right Church we could use some ministries like that we could use some of that look at the next verse verse 38 and she come in that instant gave thanks likewise and Lord and spake of him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem next scripture and when they had all performed all things according law of the Lord they returned to Galilee to their own City Nazareth now I must have missed it there because we know she got to see the Lord yeah she got to see the Lord before yeah I think she said that was Simeon okay simians yeah verse 25 Simeon was the one who sees the the salvation of the Lord and here Anna yeah come Anna give thanks to the Lord the look for the redemption of Jerusalem so Simeon sees the Lord and then comes and said in other words this day the Scriptures fulfilled amen we see God's salvation salvation is here so all those prayers all those fastings God heard in heaven and they were building up to this moment and God used her as those second witness Simeon was the first witness and then God uses Anna as a second witness the salvation has come amen Oh hallelujah the church each day that we focus on our gift is just a building block when we talked about that on Sunday night each day you each time you obey God each day you serve God prayer fasting or just praying reading your Bible it's building a wall of separation amen it's building a law of character a wall a separation is keeping Satan out and keeping God in amen each each day of diligence is a wall you build up and pretty soon your characters protected behind the protection of God's grace amen I knew you and then God can use you in a great way like this look God can use her in a great way how many women didn't get to see the Messiah how many women laughed at Mary that day how many women blast him the Holy Ghost that day but because she was dedicated to prayer and fasting and knew a God Carter knew she not only gets to announce that salvation she gets to see the salvation of the Lord hey man let's say to our feet I better stop there I'll preach no longer here see she had the revelation because she was in her position and she read because she never gave up she knew what God's called me to fast now I know these other doors God has closed I don't of the family ministry anymore and now my ministries for prayer and fasting and because she was faithful all those years God let her see Jesus Christ God let her see that little Christ child the greatest gift that was ever on the face of the earth does that right Church God's God's wrapped gift amen hallelujah all because she was faithful she was diligent how they lujah how many want to redeem the time church I just feel burdened to stay on this because I want to see everybody whether you tell me or not I just want to see God vindicated that each person is investing in their gifts and then your your investment is seen by everybody now if you've got a ministry like praying and fasting like that then maybe just from time to time we'll see well soon you know of course we'll fee all your love for God but then from time to time you have a great merit core or great something or great testimony but each time you'll be here you just you're happy you're thankful to serve God you're hungry for more of God you're not battling am I saved or not am I filled with the Holy Ghost enough to buy cause you're you're earnestly every day you go down to prayer God renew me today make me fresh again today revive me today amen your earnest your diligent your giving all diligence to make everybody know which side you're on praise God you don't take days off you don't take weeks off serving God every day it's like Daniel every day I'm investing in this every day I know what God's calling me do how many know what God's call them to do may God revealed to us let's have the musicians come if you don't know may God reveal it to you you seek him with all your heart you'll find them see that's why you know I care so much about the house of God that's why I'm usually the first one here usually not tonight and a little fever you know the fever threw off everything at home usually I'm the first one here usually last one leave not always but why is that because I realized my my gift is here this is my gift I've got to invest and give everything I can give myself wholly to this and everybody can see that I'm profiting everybody can see that I'm dedicated to this I'm giving all my diligence to this I had this last thought I'll share Judas was condemned because he sold out the word for the world we've got to sell out the world for the word and we both have the highest calling he had the highest individual calling apostle there's no higher calling than that [Music] and that's why brother branham said people shudder when they hear Judas name because he had the highest calling in the Bible but he sold it out for money but thank God we can sell out the world and we have the highest calling for the church which is the bride of Jesus Christ praise God hallelujah it's okay if I'm not an apostle as long as I'm his wife because he's the priest an apostle of our faith I just want to be married to that high postulate she's not that's the battle the battle is always gonna be are you giving all your diligence are you selling out the world are we selling out our calling if you buy something you got to give it up we've got to give up our free time we got to give up whatever is taken away from us investing in our gifts give ourselves wholly to God's Word that are profiting they appear before all let's bow our heads I'm not going to even you look around but just in your heart you don't to raise your hand but how many would say Lord as you're whispering a prayer lord help me to sell out everything that I can invest and give myself wholly to the gifts you give me how many would in your heart say yes Lord that's my desire my hands are up the church I understand my mind is probably the easiest to see just cuz that's the nature of the job pastors up there every every week every service he's up there that's the nature everybody can see mine but yours is just as important how many believe that your gift is just as important as mine buh-bam said every believer should be just as interested in their gift in being positioned in the house of God as the pastor is it is good let's have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father you saw the hearts that were lifted I I didn't ask the hands benefit tonight but the heart's a simple message kind of review but all I hope that people can catch the inspiration behind it the Lord if we can just focus on our gifts invest in our gifts and our calling in life then the profiting will be seen by all the church members and of course our family and friends as well if we can just give ourselves so what you've called us to do so will I pray if your people here if they don't know your will may they seek you today find it may they get in their prayer closet as Jesus said may they give some time to it one thing that you'll need in time that's one thing we need to do is to make the time we need to get it all with God may your people get alone with you in Jesus Christ's name but they can know the gifts know the calling know the hope of their calling and invest in those gifts for God oh that's my desires and creature as I said that Lord when we answer on that day each member of our church can can go before you and say Lord I knew it you called me to do our best the gifts here's the fruits of the labors and you'll say well done good and faithful servant you've invested in your gift and here's the reward back he said well done entering the joys of the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world we don't want a withering church we want a flourishing growing village an eager church wants to do something for you fathers were upon this holy week we know it's just as holy as any other week but Lord it's a time we remember of your great sacrifice your whole purpose of your life was wrapped up in Calvary resurrection morning amen thank you though for your great life your great death and your great resurrection without that we have nothing we have no hope but because of this week we have hope Lord done and the hope from this week fuels us for the rest of the year a memory in fact that Resurrection Day 2,000 years ago has been fueling us to this day Lord God that's just now Lord as we sing these songs father may we really make a desire to our heart Lord to redeem the time so that everybody can see our prophet so that we can Lord fulfill the scripture that says make your calling and election sure prove to everyone that we're a wise virgin not a foolish but we're wise we walk circumspectly precisely we know the precise will of God that our influence will be like a rock dropped in a pond in the wave the ripples of the waves go all the way across the pond a man glory the effects of our testimony go outside of us to our family or work or church amen and they go from from from town to town Lord the effects of the Holy Spirit our lives amen granite Lord

friend in Jesus Christ's name Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Great Scott thank you Lord let me have the right spirit Lord hallelujah renew a right spirit a right attitude towards the gifts you've given me let me see them as jewels like the gifts that Eleazar gave to Rebekah but your prophets said were spiritual gifts how many know that Rebecca didn't turn down any of those jewelry gifts how we know that Aram said that's the church receiving the spiritual gifts that God pours a partner a oh god help us to receive our gifts for God first we feeling the Holy Ghost

hallelujah if you're gonna redeem something there's got to be something they've got to be lost right lose something in order to gain redeem it back praise God how many willing to lose whatever you have to lose to carry the cross of Christ praise God let's just close with a word of Prayer here by God's grace Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this word tonight Lord God thank you for these songs lord help us to remember when we first got saved that joy that we have let it be new every morning Lord God in earnestness may we say Lord I want to be diligent I want you to add to my character
