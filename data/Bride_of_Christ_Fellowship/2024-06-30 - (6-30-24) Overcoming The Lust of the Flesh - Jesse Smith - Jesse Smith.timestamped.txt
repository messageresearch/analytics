[0:05] so looks like we're live by God's grace
[0:06] so God bless all the live streamers and
[0:09] God bless the Saints here in the house
[0:10] of the Lord today uh Wednesday just for
[0:13] the live streamers uh you know we uh
[0:15] didn't have internet access on Wednesday
[0:16] it wasn't working we looked at uh the
[0:18] third sermon on the seven dimensions
[0:21] maybe have one more sermon on that but
[0:23] if you'd like a copy that or recorded
[0:24] the audio just you know email me or
[0:26] something like that uh so we'll be able
[0:29] to share that but today we want to look
[0:30] at a different topic I guess you know
[0:32] I'll share why but this has just been U
[0:34] kind of on my heart these last few weeks
[0:36] I want to look at overcoming the lust of
[0:37] the flesh healthy eating so it's more of
[0:41] a a message you know that we would say
[0:43] this is a sanctification message but it
[0:45] really involves the leadership of the
[0:47] Holy Spirit In Our Lives it really does
[0:49] uning to the holy spirit so 1
[0:51] Corinthians
[0:54] 6:20 let's read that if we can on three
[0:56] 1 2 3 for ye are bought with a price
[1:01] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:04] in your spirit which are Gods amen so if
[1:08] you go now to Luke
[1:10] 21 you know Jesus prophesied that we'd
[1:13] have to overcome the lust of the flesh
[1:15] here of course at the end time now we
[1:18] know of course the lust of the eyes and
[1:20] the pride of life as well but this area
[1:23] you know impacts us a lot you know in
[1:25] America where we have so much
[1:28] Prosperity uh naturally and so forth so
[1:32] it was prophesied by Jesus that it would
[1:34] be a snare OV eaing and over drinking
[1:37] would be a snare that people would get
[1:40] caught
[1:40] into and uh the only way we can overcome
[1:43] it is by watching and praying the Bible
[1:46] says so watching and praying of course
[1:48] the Bible says praying is building up
[1:50] the spirit of God in your life right
[1:52] it's Jude chapter 1 building up your
[1:54] Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy
[1:56] Ghost so in in a country where we have
[1:59] so much naturally uh we have so much
[2:02] spiritually it's a snare Satan sets a
[2:04] trap that will feed our flesh too much
[2:08] and of course in this modern day feed it
[2:10] the wrong
[2:11] food and wrong drink so I just want to
[2:14] uh preach on this this morning as I I'll
[2:16] share why in just a moment but uh I'll
[2:18] read uh I'll read 34 and 35 and then
[2:22] we'll all read 36 Luke
[2:24] 2134 and take heed to yourselves lest at
[2:27] any time your hearts be overcharged with
[2:30] surfeiting now that means
[2:32] headaches headaches so sometimes people
[2:34] get headaches you know from overeating
[2:36] and so forth and there's all kinds of uh
[2:39] all kinds of uh we'd say uh problems
[2:42] that come by not eating the right Foods
[2:44] or not having the right
[2:46] diet and drunkenness of course we life
[2:48] too much alcohol and cares of this life
[2:53] so and so that day come upon you
[2:55] unawares so Jesus says the natural food
[2:58] and then the cares of life will make
[3:01] people forget about the
[3:03] Rapture verse 35 for as a snare shall
[3:06] come on all them that dwell on the face
[3:09] of the whole earth this is a worldwide
[3:13] battle right that we're going to have to
[3:15] overcome how many glad you can overcome
[3:17] it by God's grace let's read verse 36
[3:19] brother amen mentioned this verse to me
[3:21] a couple weeks ago I thought wow this
[3:22] tied in really good with this so let's
[3:23] read this PSM 3 1 2 3 watch ye therefore
[3:27] and pray always that he may be accounted
[3:30] worthy to escape all these things that
[3:33] shall come to pass and to stand before
[3:37] the son of man God bless you you may be
[3:39] seated may God has blessing to the r of
[3:40] his
[3:46] word uh you know I had slides to show
[3:48] but I'm not going to show them today
[3:49] because uh you know Wednesday we had
[3:51] problems I don't know why we are having
[3:53] problems I turned it on and it was you
[3:55] know instantly showing like uh cable
[3:58] stations it was really awkward and
[4:00] really sad so I'm going to wait you know
[4:02] for the second service I'll probably
[4:03] preach a part two on this this
[4:05] afternoon um and then I'll you know
[4:08] between Services I can kind of play with
[4:10] it try to get it on the right setting so
[4:12] we don't see like any like they had you
[4:14] know a late night talk show on there it
[4:16] was just cartoons and nonsense so I
[4:18] don't want to have to go through that
[4:19] this morning so I I'll just not I'll
[4:21] just avoid that and then I can show the
[4:23] visuals you know this evening by God's
[4:25] grace so I want to look at overcoming
[4:27] the lust of the flesh that's the title
[4:29] and the sub topic is healthy eating and
[4:32] drinking
[4:34] um as far as I know brother Adam never
[4:37] preached a full sermon on this topic but
[4:39] he did of course mention it quite often
[4:42] and I guess you know the reason this has
[4:44] been on my heart the last few weeks is
[4:45] because we've had numerous uh deaths you
[4:48] know in our friends and different ones
[4:49] we've uh you know been associated with
[4:52] and I was tell my wife yesterday just
[4:53] you know uh our mortality has been more
[4:56] apparent recently you know with we had
[4:59] three friends lose their spouses in the
[5:02] last few
[5:03] weeks and you know I lost my coworker 54
[5:07] years old and uh I was extremely sad she
[5:10] had breast cancer twice and then uh oh
[5:13] you know beat that through chemo but
[5:15] then this last time I forget the name of
[5:16] the cancer uh but she passed on because
[5:20] of that then you know brother mua's wife
[5:22] you know lost his wife with a heart
[5:24] attack and then uh Wendy you know uh
[5:28] Austin Lena friend her husband passed
[5:31] on and he was in his 50s I'm not
[5:34] mistaken so you know that that's been
[5:36] kind of all my uh I me we've been
[5:38] praying about that a lot right we've
[5:40] been praying for that every service
[5:41] we've been praying for these people that
[5:42] have lost spouses and uh you know then
[5:44] my wife's been having some health events
[5:46] which I like hearing about and she tells
[5:48] me about and I actually got to speak at
[5:50] one last year that was a blessing uh and
[5:53] I'm going to share a little bit about
[5:54] that you know today as well of
[5:57] course and then you know brother irin
[5:59] Miller the the uh he's the Elder he's
[6:01] not the pastor but he's the Elder down
[6:02] there in Junction City you know they
[6:04] they've had a few visitors recently and
[6:07] uh you know the the visit one of the
[6:09] visitors was trying to bring in the
[6:11] spirit of
[6:12] legalism into the church and he was
[6:14] saying you know you can't eat pork you
[6:16] can't eat shrimp you know he's basically
[6:18] trying to take them back to Jewish laws
[6:19] and I said brother that's the demon
[6:21] Spirit of legalism I said do not accept
[6:24] that he said Hallelujah he said the same
[6:25] verse I gave him is the same verse God
[6:27] gave him Hallelujah we'll look at that
[6:29] and so food has been on our you know
[6:31] Minds then I've listening to different
[6:33] preachers there's a preacher uh who has
[6:35] stage four cancer and he was saying you
[6:37] know how sugar feeds cancer so he's had
[6:39] to stop eating
[6:40] sugar which is a good thing right and
[6:42] that that's one of the main problems
[6:44] here in America is sugar intake so I
[6:46] heard him say that I thought this
[6:48] weekend I thought wow I'm getting all
[6:49] these thoughts on this
[6:50] and
[6:54] um uh and so and then you know I was
[6:56] listening to different
[6:57] things uh just sermon and it was kept
[7:00] coming up about you know taking care of
[7:02] your temple the Bible said your body is
[7:03] the Temple of the Holy Ghost and so I
[7:05] just thought I would take a Sunday on
[7:07] this and uh I felt you know numerous
[7:10] things kind of pushed me towards this so
[7:12] if you have your Bible you know we're
[7:13] starting in 1 Corinthians 6:18 where we
[7:16] were uh we read our text now in the
[7:18] context of 1 Corinthians 6:20 glorify
[7:22] God in your body and your spirit which
[7:24] are Gods the context is sexual
[7:28] immorality because in ver Verse 18 He
[7:30] says flee
[7:31] fornication sexual sin is a sin against
[7:34] your own body so somehow God will punish
[7:37] people in their bodies when they uh sin
[7:40] sexually so there's awful repercussions
[7:43] to that and so especially our young
[7:46] people uh it's so important to have the
[7:49] self-control of the Holy Spirit to save
[7:52] yourself from
[7:54] marriage in other words don't get
[7:55] involved with a man or a woman you know
[7:57] the opposite sex don't get involved with
[7:59] anyone until you are married by God's
[8:01] grace in the Physical Realm Of course
[8:03] before marriage is courtship Hallelujah
[8:06] and we've had a lot of good questions on
[8:07] that over the last few years and you
[8:10] must follow God's courtship guidelines
[8:11] before you get
[8:13] married but I just love what Paul said
[8:15] you are bought with a price your body is
[8:17] not your own you can't do whatever you
[8:19] want with your
[8:20] body right you have to do what the Lord
[8:23] says to do with your body and because
[8:26] your body is not yours you you must
[8:27] glorify God with your body
[8:29] and your spirit and your soul which are
[8:32] Gods amen and so often you as I've told
[8:35] you I focused on as a I think all
[8:37] pastors have to do it we focus on the
[8:39] battle of the mind right we focus on
[8:40] glorifying God with your mind yes
[8:43] because once you're born again your soul
[8:45] is sealed right and what you've learned
[8:47] what you need to learn to do after that
[8:48] is to listen to the spirit of God in
[8:50] your
[8:51] soul that's why prayer is so important
[8:53] and uh reading the word of God you know
[8:56] we've all felt it you read your Bibles
[8:58] and it's like something strikes you it's
[8:59] like
[9:00] something just strikes up it comes up
[9:01] and that's right I need to do that you
[9:03] know it's God speaking to you through
[9:05] the soul but the trouble is or I say the
[9:08] battle is I shouldn't say trouble I mean
[9:10] our whole lives are trouble sometimes
[9:12] but the battle is that we get in the
[9:14] flesh and we get our we get our minds
[9:16] thinking about our flesh too much
[9:18] because remember brother R says your
[9:20] soul has a thirst that's that's that's
[9:23] scriptural Amen in the Book of Psalms
[9:25] David or David says my soul thirsts
[9:28] after the Living God amen and then in
[9:30] Ephesians chapter 2 uh the Bible said
[9:32] you have desires of the Flesh and of the
[9:35] Mind mhm and so it's a great Revelation
[9:38] it struck me a few years ago but all
[9:40] three parts of your body your being are
[9:42] calling out for something so all day
[9:44] long your soul saying feed me the word
[9:46] amen all day long your body's saying
[9:48] feed me
[9:50] food right well most of the day and all
[9:53] day long your mind is like give me
[9:54] something to think about give me
[9:55] something to learn
[9:57] about right and you're either going to
[9:58] give it something or not give it or give
[10:00] it too much but we want to have the
[10:02] right balance of the holy spirit amen
[10:05] you should want to learn that's the
[10:07] Bible said desires of the mind you
[10:08] should want to grow in Grace and
[10:10] knowledge of the Lord amen right your
[10:12] Soul's not going to grow that way your
[10:14] Soul's sealed your soul is the uh it's
[10:17] it's the it's the home of the Holy
[10:19] Spirit hallelujah it's the inside of the
[10:21] inside it's your nature hallelujah amen
[10:24] but it needs fed the word of God as well
[10:26] it needs strengthen Hallelujah
[10:29] but you know so often you know uh you
[10:32] know we got to be careful especially in
[10:33] America to make sure we give our body
[10:35] what it needs it's very important I
[10:38] learn it the hard way and I I'll say
[10:39] like this I still learn it the hard
[10:42] way um and so you know it's very
[10:46] important to review this from time to
[10:50] time now if you have your Bible uh 1
[10:52] Corinthians 3 already in six if you go
[10:54] to chapter three know you not that verse
[10:56] 16 know you not that you are the temple
[10:58] of God and that the spirit of God dwells
[11:00] in you if any man
[11:03] defile the temple of God him shall God
[11:05] destroy we know lots of people die
[11:07] prematurely because they misuse their
[11:09] body either sexually or what they eat or
[11:12] drink right drunkards dying in car
[11:14] accidents right that's an easy example
[11:16] people overdosing on drugs and dying
[11:18] right they God allows them to be
[11:20] destroyed because they've chosen to
[11:21] destroy their own
[11:23] body
[11:24] right for ye are the temple of God and
[11:27] the temple of God is Holy which Temple
[11:29] ye are amen amen now the word defile
[11:32] means to ruin or corrupt amen so God
[11:36] doesn't want us to ruin our bodies
[11:38] they're they're slowly you know once you
[11:40] hit 21 it's slowly downhill so enjoy it
[11:42] before you're
[11:44] 21 after that you're just trying to
[11:47] maintain I'm 43 and every day I wake up
[11:49] like oh I got to maint I got to stretch
[11:50] out this this body it gets tighter every
[11:53] day right so I got to stretch it out
[11:54] every day and every day I'm asking
[11:56] myself why do I got to get old you know
[11:59] I don't like it used to feel so good so
[12:01] much better I don't have to stretch out
[12:02] so much but uh we don't we don't want to
[12:06] ruin our bodies purposely ruin them
[12:09] right we don't want to purposely corrupt
[12:11] them right because it's God's Temple
[12:13] hallelujah amen and we cannot glorify
[12:16] God if we're destroying our bodies right
[12:19] it it actually it does a dishonor to God
[12:22] and you've heard me say before you know
[12:24] people will treat their bodies the wrong
[12:26] way and uh eat the wrong things drink
[12:29] the wrong things they'll get sick and
[12:30] they'll say the devil did this to me no
[12:32] you did it to yourself right because of
[12:35] the lust of the flesh I'm talking about
[12:37] now the main thing is too much sugar in
[12:39] America they just overeat sugar right
[12:42] like I said these last few months I've
[12:44] had preachers we've had preachers come
[12:45] in and say that's what they battle is
[12:48] eating the wrong foods and they uh God's
[12:51] trying to help them God's showing them
[12:52] that they need to eat the right
[12:55] Foods right so we've had preachers admit
[12:58] that over the pulit
[12:59] that that's where they battle you know
[13:01] lust of the lust of the flesh is their
[13:03] biggest battle but there's also lust of
[13:04] the eyes and there's pride of life and
[13:07] we battle all three but there's times
[13:09] you know Seasons we battle one more than
[13:11] the other right but we cannot you know
[13:14] so the preacher is basically saying Lord
[13:16] Lord help me and Saints pray for me
[13:18] because I need to overcome the lust of
[13:19] My Flesh amen right and who doesn't need
[13:23] prayer sometimes we all need prayer when
[13:26] I'm down I want somebody I want Jose to
[13:28] come pray for me amen
[13:29] when I'm struggling I want Haven to come
[13:31] bring me another verse
[13:33] amen hallelujah I'm happy now that's why
[13:35] I can say it with a smile when I'm
[13:37] struggling I can't really say it like
[13:38] that I'm angry or frustrated you I saw
[13:41] another YouTuber got he got his account
[13:43] hacked too so I didn't feel so bad he
[13:45] said for three months he battled an
[13:47] angry spirit I said I can relate to
[13:49] that I thought wow I'm glad I'm not the
[13:51] only one devil tries to make you feel
[13:54] like you're the only one battling you're
[13:55] not the only one there's Grace and but
[13:58] God's grace is efficient to help us
[13:59] overcome
[14:01] Hallelujah I want to look you know of
[14:02] course at gluttony and drunkenness of
[14:04] course now for us it's not going to be
[14:06] drunkenness like you know most of us
[14:07] don't come to CH none of us would ever
[14:09] come to church drunk I've never seen a
[14:10] person come to church drunk uh for well
[14:12] maybe met brother yeah there's a brother
[14:14] that used to come years ago he came
[14:16] maybe once or twice he came to church
[14:18] drunk I just had to bear with
[14:22] him but you know uh the the first uh
[14:25] instance of of drunkenness of course was
[14:27] Noah but then the first case of gluttony
[14:29] is Deuteronomy 21: 20 and they shall say
[14:32] to the Elders of his City this is our
[14:34] son he's stubborn and
[14:37] rebellious and he will not obey our
[14:39] voice he's a glutton and a drunkard so
[14:43] you know this is not just one problem in
[14:45] This Boy's Life right Glutton is just
[14:48] gluttony is just a uh it's just a
[14:50] outward uh expression of what's
[14:52] happening in his life he's he's got a
[14:54] rebellious spear right he's disobeying
[14:56] he's got a prideful Spirit he's not
[14:58] listening to his father father and
[14:59] mother mhm and so because he's
[15:02] rebellious he's stubborn and he's uh
[15:05] drunkard and Glutton and the Bible said
[15:07] in case like that a a little or sorry a
[15:09] son that wouldn't do that he gets
[15:11] stoned now we don't have any records of
[15:13] that of that actually happening but that
[15:15] was God's punishment under the law and
[15:18] what was the law the law was a teacher
[15:19] to point you to Christ in other words if
[15:22] you got a rebellious Spirit take it to
[15:24] Jesus amen got trouble with gluttony or
[15:27] drunkenness take it to Jesus hallelujah
[15:29] amen
[15:32] amen then we see it again in Proverbs
[15:34] 23: 211 for the drunkard and the Glutton
[15:37] shall come to Poverty so we see people
[15:40] that Focus too much on their flesh and
[15:42] give their flesh the wrong thing they
[15:44] end up poor many
[15:46] times and drowsiness shall close a man
[15:50] with Rags yeah so drunkenness and
[15:52] gluttony brings poverty many times not
[15:55] always you know we see a lot of rich
[15:57] people that are overweight or get drunk
[15:58] and have trouble with alcohol but it's
[16:01] just a it's just a proverb right it's a
[16:03] likelihood this is likely what's going
[16:05] to happen a person overeats over
[16:08] drinks and of course you know we get
[16:10] this in uh we get this from 1 John 2:16
[16:14] for all that is in the world the lust of
[16:16] the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[16:17] the pride of life is not of the father
[16:20] but is of the
[16:21] world
[16:23] Hallelujah so this topic again of course
[16:25] has been on my heart and mind and you
[16:27] know we've seen these young people
[16:28] people young people 54 59 seeing these
[16:31] young people pass away just makes me
[16:33] want of a good reminder I want to treat
[16:35] my body the right way amen amen
[16:37] hallelujah I don't want to I don't want
[16:39] to defile what God has given to me
[16:42] because I have defiled it before and I
[16:44] want to uh I want to see all of us treat
[16:48] our bodies in the right way praise God
[16:51] hallelujah it's a good reminder
[16:53] Hallelujah you my wife would just tell
[16:54] me you know I used to go just a few last
[16:56] year I used to come home and most days
[16:58] after school I just get out that organic
[17:00] bag of blue potato chips and just eat
[17:02] half the bag you
[17:04] know but then I found out all the
[17:05] ingredients aren't very good in
[17:07] there but I stopped doing it I did not
[17:10] do it this whole since January maybe
[17:13] before that so what I'm saying is that I
[17:16] sometimes I have bad habits but God
[17:17] helps me to get the better habits
[17:18] Hallelujah I've been eating more meat
[17:20] and cheese you know healthier things by
[17:23] God's
[17:26] grace and my wife taught me just cuz it
[17:28] says organic doesn't mean it's
[17:30] healthy right I I can't take you very
[17:33] deep on that but that's true because
[17:35] what I mean is you know you look back on
[17:36] the back of the package you know there's
[17:38] soy and bad things for your body in
[17:40] there and I'm no doctor but I am a
[17:42] preacher Hallelujah if the Bible says
[17:44] don't destroy your temple I can tell you
[17:46] that praise God then you can search for
[17:49] some more help on the details of that
[17:57] Hallelujah and so you know we see this
[17:59] and this is what you know I preached uh
[18:01] at the health event you remember where
[18:04] that was was that Orville or Kindred so
[18:07] uh it was April 1st and it was no April
[18:09] fools it was April 1st in 2023 I taught
[18:12] just an hour lesson on uh eating healthy
[18:14] and living healthy just straight from
[18:16] the Bible and it was nice it was
[18:17] encouraging one woman come up and said
[18:19] or she wrote a letter and said I was her
[18:21] favorite teacher that day so of all the
[18:23] classes so I was sent to that one person
[18:27] that that that event had hundreds of
[18:29] people but one person needed to hear
[18:31] that and that's how God works you know
[18:33] it might not be for everybody but
[18:34] there's one thing that you need that
[18:37] encouraged me but uh my my main point in
[18:40] in that was that we're in a a generation
[18:43] of excess of everything and all these
[18:46] Temptations of the flesh but we've got
[18:48] to have the Holy Ghost to Turn Down The
[18:51] Temptations for the Flesh and it's
[18:53] called Temperance so second Peter 1: 15
[18:57] says giving all diligence so if we want
[19:00] the anointing of the Holy Ghost we got
[19:01] to be diligent about casting down
[19:03] Temptations
[19:05] amen add to your faith virtue so first
[19:08] we need Faith which is Assurance
[19:11] Hallelujah so first we have to have
[19:13] faith which also is a revelation it's
[19:15] anointing of the Holy Ghost and after
[19:17] that you need virtue which is strength
[19:19] strength to publicly lead the I'm sorry
[19:21] to live the word of God so see when a
[19:24] person gets saved you know they they
[19:26] have the Holy Ghost anointing a little
[19:27] bit of anointing but they're not filled
[19:28] with the Holy Ghost because they'll
[19:30] still go to school or they they'll still
[19:33] go to work and and they can't really
[19:35] live all the word of God in front of
[19:37] their co-workers but when you get the
[19:39] anointing of virtue now you can live it
[19:41] in front of people amen and that's like
[19:43] Ruth Ruth lived the Hol the Holy Spirit
[19:46] anointing of the Old Testament she lived
[19:48] in front of all those men out in the
[19:49] field Hallelujah all those women out in
[19:51] the field and their dirty jokes and the
[19:53] complain about the weather all those
[19:54] things the Bible said the whole city
[19:56] knew she was a virtuous woman Hallelujah
[19:58] amen see CU she could live it she could
[20:01] live it in front of the Sinners
[20:02] hallelujah amen that's how you know you
[20:04] got the virtue anointing and then
[20:06] knowledge which is understanding then
[20:08] you got to have understanding of why
[20:10] women don't cut their hair why men don't
[20:12] uh wear shorts you need understanding
[20:15] because we don't show off our nakedness
[20:16] the Bible says and just you know
[20:19] understanding about all these uh
[20:20] sanctification teachings why we don't
[20:22] smoke cigarettes why we don't drink
[20:24] alcohol in public all these you need
[20:26] understanding on the word of God amen
[20:28] amen and then after that you need the
[20:30] anointing of temperance which is
[20:32] self-control over bodily
[20:35] passions right so preachers that you
[20:37] know will get drunk it shows they don't
[20:38] have the anointing of
[20:40] temperance right uh women or men that'll
[20:43] get drunk or uh or even uh sexual
[20:46] immorality all these have you seen these
[20:48] last few months all these preachers are
[20:49] fallen in sexual immorality it's because
[20:51] they never got the anointing of
[20:53] temperance or I say like this they had
[20:55] it but then they lost it yeah right
[20:57] because you can lose the anointing in
[20:59] just like you can gain the anointing you
[21:00] can lose the anointing anybody knows
[21:02] that Hallelujah someday your mind just
[21:04] thinks about God all day amen it's like
[21:06] you're walking on clouds amen go the
[21:08] next day you wake up with a evil spirit
[21:10] right an angry Spirit or something like
[21:12] that or you got a Creek in your neck and
[21:13] then that makes you
[21:15] angry like the other day I woke up and I
[21:17] got this back pain what happened you
[21:19] know it can make you cranky but you got
[21:22] to cast it
[21:23] down but see that's where many people
[21:25] fail in this area and Jesus said Satan
[21:28] would the snare in this day of too much
[21:32] eating too much
[21:33] drinking right it's a snare for this day
[21:36] so we can see Satan is trying to get
[21:38] people to stop at
[21:40] Temperance right yeah and so Satan's
[21:44] working really hard so people don't get
[21:45] self-control and what's after
[21:46] self-control
[21:48] patience people get a impatient with
[21:51] preachers impatient with churches
[21:53] impatient with their mom impatient with
[21:54] their dad they're just impatient so if
[21:57] you don't got that anointing of
[21:58] temperance you'll miss patience and then
[22:00] you'll miss godliness being like God
[22:03] right which is loving the unlovable
[22:04] loving the Sinners
[22:06] right and then you won't get brotherly
[22:08] kindness which is the anointing to treat
[22:10] others in this church with extreme
[22:12] kindness and love amen I just read this
[22:15] week where Paul said Paul said when I'm
[22:17] amongst you I'm like a nurse that
[22:19] cherishes her
[22:20] children I've ever seen a real sweet
[22:23] everybody had a real sweet nurse before
[22:24] when you went to the doctor I mean a
[22:26] real sweet nurse that's what Paul said
[22:28] Paul said we were gentle among you like
[22:31] a nurse would cherish the
[22:33] children
[22:35] Hallelujah that doesn't mean there's not
[22:37] a variety sometimes you got said there's
[22:39] real dogmatic people you know sometime
[22:41] uh there real strong strong willed
[22:43] people there there there can be a
[22:44] variety not everybody has to be that
[22:46] we're not cookie cutters all the time
[22:47] but just the idea of having brotherly
[22:49] love and patience and and goodness and
[22:51] kindness to our church family we should
[22:53] have it if we got the Holy Ghost
[22:55] hallelujah amen and then after that
[22:58] brother bam said and the Bible said God
[23:00] caps you off or seals you off with
[23:02] Charity which is the love of God
[23:03] hallelujah
[23:05] amen for if these things be in you 1
[23:07] Peter 1 18 and abound they shall they
[23:10] make you that ye shall be neither Barren
[23:12] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[23:15] Lord Jesus
[23:16] Christ so see all these anointings make
[23:19] you a fruitful Christian people can see
[23:22] the fruits of your life hallelujah amen
[23:25] and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[23:27] Christ that makes people can see your
[23:29] knowledge wow you really understand the
[23:31] gospel Hallelujah you understand the
[23:33] word of God Amen because you constantly
[23:36] have these anointings anointing you and
[23:38] and guiding you what's the anointing to
[23:40] do the anointing is to break the yolks
[23:42] amen hallelujah amen people see your
[23:45] life is free from bondage amen they see
[23:47] you're free you're a a Christian you're
[23:50] an eagle who's flying above the world
[23:52] Hallelujah they can see that this
[23:54] person's free indeed hallelujah amen see
[23:57] the anointing bre breaks the Yoke of the
[23:59] enemy
[24:00] Hallelujah
[24:02] Glory now it's a worldwide snare as I
[24:06] said like all other Temptations eating
[24:09] and
[24:10] drinking right so in order for us to eat
[24:12] and drink right we need sincere prayer
[24:15] because Jesus said watch ye therefore
[24:17] and pray always in Luke
[24:24] 21:36 and we have to remember Satan has
[24:26] set a a trap to try to give us this
[24:29] surfing this headaches and this uh I
[24:31] would say I think a modern term might be
[24:33] all this results of
[24:35] inflammation all these uh attributes of
[24:38] inflammation now I'm no doctor so
[24:41] don't don't consider me a doctor but you
[24:44] know I've gone through the some of these
[24:46] effects I know what it's like you know
[24:48] the headaches and the uh for me it was
[24:50] rashes and things like
[24:52] that stomach aches and all kinds of
[24:54] things and uh feeling uh uh no energy
[24:58] you know
[25:00] MH and so that's a trap Satan is uh
[25:04] setting and it's to get the people to
[25:06] stop praying to stop watching for the
[25:09] coming of the Lord and then if they're
[25:11] not watching for the coming of the lord
[25:12] it's just like well we might as well eat
[25:13] drink and be married the Bible says
[25:15] right remember that verse oh if the
[25:18] Lord's not coming we'll just eat drink
[25:19] and be married we'll just eat up and
[25:21] drink up and no we've got to live like
[25:23] he's coming Hallelujah remember brother
[25:25] amen had that dream he's coming and and
[25:28] every I saw that in the scripture every
[25:29] generation should have that Paul had
[25:32] that Paul thought Jesus was coming in
[25:34] his day Hallelujah so did Brother random
[25:37] you know so did the uh the early church
[25:39] they they thought he was coming so we
[25:41] have to live like that amen so see it
[25:44] involves sincere prayer and Lord I want
[25:48] to escape these Temptations I don't want
[25:50] to be caught in these Temptations I
[25:52] don't want to be caught in that I want
[25:53] to escape Hallelujah it takes sincere
[25:56] prayer Lord I don't want to be caught up
[25:58] in uh feeding my flesh too much I want
[26:00] to I want to crucify the lust of the
[26:03] flesh amen I want to bring my body into
[26:05] subjection to the word of God hallelujah
[26:07] Paul said if I don't do it I might be a
[26:09] Cast Away
[26:10] Hallelujah that's exactly right and look
[26:13] at these preachers falling away you know
[26:14] they're Cast Away in one way right they
[26:18] uh they fallen off the ship right
[26:20] because the lust of the flesh lust of
[26:22] the eyes pride of life Hallelujah
[26:25] because they didn't uh they didn't they
[26:27] didn't run the race the way they're
[26:28] supposed to run it hallelujah amen you
[26:31] can't run the race giving into the flesh
[26:33] you can't run the race giving into Pride
[26:35] you can't run the race giving into the
[26:37] lust of the eyes you can't run the race
[26:38] that way we've got to escape it by
[26:40] watching and praying hallelujah
[26:43] amen
[26:47] glory now it's a parallel passage in
[26:50] Matthew 24:37 but as the days of Noah
[26:53] where so shall be also in the coming of
[26:55] the son of man for as in the days that
[26:57] were Before the Flood they were eating
[26:59] and drinking marrying and giving in
[27:01] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[27:03] the Ark so we see the same thing eating
[27:05] and drinking right and of course we know
[27:08] the other aspect of Luke 17 was days of
[27:12] Noah and days of lot now thank God most
[27:14] of us don't battle with the days of lot
[27:17] but there are such things as homosexual
[27:19] Spirits right we know that there are uh
[27:22] sodomite Spirits I met a few I prayed
[27:25] for a few people that battled that but
[27:28] we can't act like uh these things aren't
[27:30] real that's it's the it's the sin of the
[27:32] hour it's the temptation of the hour and
[27:34] we must have compassion on people
[27:36] hallelujah to know that they're just
[27:38] they're wrestling against spiritual
[27:40] wickedness in high places but we can
[27:42] help them wrestle amen we can help them
[27:44] overcome by the grace of God hallelujah
[27:47] all these spirits of people are battling
[27:51] yeah but I found you know uh as as a
[27:54] pastor and I told you this before but
[27:56] you know we start off how many how many
[27:57] start with a lot of zeal for the lord
[28:00] well a little time goes on and time your
[28:03] Zeal runs down a little bit and the
[28:05] church
[28:07] said you know we all can't live on the
[28:09] mountain all the time sometimes you know
[28:12] God allows time just to test
[28:14] us right and we have to make that choice
[28:17] like I just KN emailed numerous people
[28:19] this week we you got to the the sister
[28:21] said you know brother Jesse I don't like
[28:23] listening to the message anymore I I
[28:25] don't I don't like reading my Bible
[28:26] anymore she said what's wrong with with
[28:28] I said nothing's wrong in one way you
[28:30] just left your first love in other words
[28:32] you're not having lost your salvation
[28:34] you just lost your first
[28:35] love you know what I mean like I'm not
[28:37] going to tell somebody they're they're
[28:38] lost just because they don't like that
[28:40] anymore what happened is they got their
[28:42] mind off the word of God I say this that
[28:44] God caught up in one of these snares
[28:46] amen and that person doesn't have to
[28:48] tell me what they're battling or what
[28:50] you know but they have to think about
[28:51] that before I used to give my time to
[28:53] God I used to give my mind my body my
[28:55] soul to God what are you giving it to
[28:57] now yeah right cuz the Bible said his
[29:01] mercies are new Every Morning the Bible
[29:03] said that becomes new every day
[29:05] Hallelujah the Bible said your mind can
[29:07] be transformed every day Hallelujah
[29:09] right your mind can feel renewed every
[29:12] single day if you take the time to do it
[29:15] Hallelujah I told her I said you just
[29:17] got to repent and Jesus say it's very
[29:19] simple just go do your first Works do
[29:22] something about it church amen that's
[29:24] right just do what you used to do
[29:26] Hallelujah bring your body subjection
[29:28] the way you used to and you can get it
[29:30] back hallelujah amen amen so I'm just
[29:34] using that as an example if you used to
[29:35] use read the church age book I'm just
[29:38] say as an example and you felt really
[29:39] close to God well read it
[29:41] again or if you if you used to pray for
[29:43] 15 minutes in the closet or used to go
[29:45] to this one certain place or read your
[29:47] Bible for this many go back and do it
[29:49] praise God Amen Jesus said if you go do
[29:52] the first works you'll get your love
[29:54] back hallelujah amen hallelujah
[29:59] oh it's a reality Hallelujah now brother
[30:02] Ram quotes this scripture about Noah's
[30:05] day he said Noah the prophet of
[30:08] righteousness going forth with his
[30:10] message there was an episode of
[30:12] immorality so brother calls an episode
[30:14] of immorality when people eat too much
[30:16] and drink too much right as the Bible
[30:20] said eating drinking marrying giv in
[30:22] marriage we find out brother man says
[30:23] gluttonous and immorality and so forth
[30:26] taking place in that day the world fell
[30:29] apart because they people rejected the
[30:31] message of God for that day amen now
[30:35] honestly Church think about this most
[30:37] churches have rejected brother an's
[30:39] message of the statute of a perfect man
[30:41] have they
[30:42] not if they would accept it they'd get
[30:45] some real Holy Ghost Temperance that's
[30:47] right and they wouldn't drink
[30:49] alcohol right when they go out to eat
[30:52] right they wouldn't do that because it's
[30:54] not good for them most of that alcohol
[30:56] goes right to their what do they call
[30:58] that they go right right to their
[31:00] midsection right it's going to go to fat
[31:02] right that's right right it it's just
[31:06] they're not under the anointing of the
[31:07] Holy Spirit Hallelujah right so see they
[31:10] rejected the message of this day they
[31:11] rejected brother's message on the
[31:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost yes like most
[31:17] people that left the message you know
[31:18] accus their brother Ram they now believe
[31:20] you got the Holy Ghost as soon as you're
[31:22] saved What a Sad deception What a Sad
[31:25] state that
[31:26] is all you've done is all you've done is
[31:30] thank God but you just got saved you
[31:33] don't have your habits cleaned up you
[31:34] don't have your mind cleaned up right
[31:36] you don't have a a Godly life you don't
[31:38] have the all these anointings of the
[31:41] Holy Spirit there's so much more
[31:43] anointing they're missing out on the
[31:45] anointing of God but we've been taught
[31:47] we can have the anointing of God
[31:49] hallelujah in other words they're still
[31:50] yoked up in many ways but we can break
[31:53] the Yoke hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[31:56] remember church this was a time when
[31:59] their imaginations were only evil
[32:01] continually so think about this they
[32:03] only had an evil imagination about food
[32:06] that's right right so that their all
[32:09] their approach to food was an evil
[32:11] approach well I want this this and food
[32:13] so it will do this to me other words I
[32:15] only want to eat the sugar I'm say I'm
[32:17] going to apply it to our day they only
[32:19] want to eat the food that tastes good
[32:21] yeah and the church said amen that was
[32:23] their approach to alcohol I'm only
[32:25] looking at alcohol with this we look at
[32:26] it like well we only use at Communion
[32:28] time that's the way you should look at
[32:30] it Paul said I won't drink wine or do
[32:32] anything while the world standing
[32:34] Hallelujah if it would cause one person
[32:36] to stumble praise God Amen so see their
[32:39] their their attitudes towards food their
[32:41] attitude towards uh alcohol it was only
[32:45] evil they they only saw as a way uh to
[32:48] give into the lust of the flesh
[32:51] amen butam also
[32:53] said he was talking about I may have
[32:56] read this years ago I can't remember
[32:59] but man talking about having a Revival
[33:00] in Oregon and he says I think what the
[33:03] people is let the spirit of the Lord
[33:05] lead we don't know what he will have us
[33:08] to do but if we'll just keep ourselves
[33:10] prayed up don't
[33:12] overeat or eat the least you can and
[33:15] pray call people on the phone get
[33:17] somebody to come attend every meeting
[33:20] you possibly can and I'm sure with all
[33:22] that effort everybody say effort
[33:25] effort it's an effort not to eat
[33:28] it's an effort to invite people to
[33:30] church right amen I invited brother M to
[33:34] church I don't know if it'll come but I
[33:36] I invited
[33:38] him I said want some fellowship you can
[33:40] have some fellowship with the Saints
[33:42] here
[33:44] Allelujah he said with all that effort
[33:47] God will meet us more than halfway on
[33:49] the ground he said I believe that so how
[33:52] many want to meet God
[33:54] halfway now that's with your health too
[33:56] I want to meet God halfway in other
[33:58] words I want to do my part and I know
[34:00] God will do his part
[34:01] [Music]
[34:03] hallelujah amen can't say God do
[34:06] everything for me that's a calvinistic
[34:09] view calvinistic uh they they they major
[34:13] too much on the sovereignty of God right
[34:16] well if if God wants me to do it then
[34:18] God will make me do it right God wants
[34:21] them to be saved and God will save them
[34:23] and you don't do nothing about it you
[34:24] don't pray about
[34:26] it what about all the other commands in
[34:28] the Bible where you should pray you
[34:29] should witness you should be alive they
[34:32] that are wise win souls
[34:34] hallelujah what about all those verses
[34:36] so see they major now brother calls it
[34:38] the extreme of Calvinism there's some
[34:40] truth in Calvinism as far as the
[34:41] sovereignty of God but brother said the
[34:43] sinful part is the extreme of it yeah
[34:45] like I showed you one time we had a
[34:46] brother coming here he don't come
[34:47] anymore but his excuse for not coming to
[34:49] church now is uh well it's predestined
[34:52] anyway if I'm going to go in the Rapture
[34:53] I'll go whether I stay at home or not
[34:55] that's a lie right cuz the B said if you
[34:58] if you're a part of the church they went
[35:00] out from us because they were not of us
[35:02] amen and the Bible said gather more say
[35:04] see the day approaching so the Bible
[35:06] tells us you've got something to do
[35:07] about it praise God that's the sinful
[35:10] extreme of it now the Other Extreme of
[35:13] the Armenian ism is uh you save yourself
[35:16] well I'm saved because I go to church no
[35:18] you're not amen I'm saved because I pay
[35:21] tied no you're not you're saved because
[35:24] of the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:26] Hallelujah see TR to meet God
[35:29] halfway not brother said I'll go with
[35:32] the Calvinism out on the branch as far
[35:34] as the Bible goes on that Branch amen he
[35:37] said I'll go as far as the Armenian uh
[35:40] arminianism I'll go as far as they go as
[35:42] long as I stay on the branch of the
[35:44] Bible but see they go too far and they
[35:47] fall off the branch that's right so B
[35:51] says you know if you want to have
[35:51] Revival he said don't overeat or eat the
[35:54] least amount of food you can brother
[35:56] said in 196 usually Fridays a fast day
[35:59] for me I eat I'm sorry I don't eat
[36:03] sometimes on Tuesdays and Fridays till
[36:05] sometime in the afternoon so catch that
[36:08] and he tells us what time he eats about
[36:09] 3 p.m. so on Tuesday and Friday brother
[36:13] R want to eat until after 3 p.m. is that
[36:15] something that's what doctors say is
[36:17] good for men to fast in the fast all
[36:19] night and fast in the morning of course
[36:20] you're going to fast while you're
[36:21] sleeping I've never seen Malachi wife
[36:23] sleeping chugging down
[36:25] the uh the chicken or whatever more
[36:32] cheese he said Till sometime afternoon
[36:34] that that's not a regular fast that's
[36:36] just a couple days a week to
[36:39] fast so B said it's you should get in
[36:41] the habit of fasting a couple days a
[36:43] week at least till like the
[36:45] afternoon you know because the Bible
[36:47] says there's great benefits of fasting
[36:50] read Isaiah 58 I preach on a few weeks
[36:52] ago or a few months ago after brother
[36:53] McBride
[36:56] kick brother Ram said but a long fast
[36:59] comes in more
[37:01] days so if you fast past 3 p.m. that's
[37:04] called a long fast or if you go into a
[37:06] second day of fasting that's called a
[37:07] long fast according to brother
[37:10] Brandon he says when the Lord puts it on
[37:13] you ever felt that the Lord put a fast
[37:16] on you you need to fast see the Lord
[37:19] will put it on you when it's your time
[37:20] to fast amen
[37:22] hallelujah but that's just in respects
[37:25] and honor look not for salvation that's
[37:27] your respect and honor to God's Great
[37:30] Memorial to us the fasting a
[37:34] command fasting and praying and giving
[37:36] of arms is a memorial that's what the
[37:38] angel told Cornelius amen remember I
[37:41] just preached that last week I didn't
[37:42] see that to right now Glory I like how
[37:44] those those little connections just fall
[37:45] into my sermon notes somehow amen the
[37:48] angel said your fasting and prayers and
[37:50] giving of alms are come up as a memorial
[37:53] before God hallelujah amen in other
[37:55] words God wants to see you fast pray and
[37:57] give arms and God Honors that up in
[38:00] heaven you know our sister Melinda got
[38:02] healed when I prayed for her I know I
[38:04] was fasting that morning cuz we at the
[38:05] hotel and I really wanted to eat some of
[38:06] that hotel food some of those sausages
[38:09] smelled so good they my wife shaking her
[38:12] they probably weren't healthy sausages
[38:14] were they I have some MSG inm or
[38:16] something like that well you know my
[38:18] flesh wanted to eat some that morning
[38:20] but I said
[38:22] no I'm not saying that's the reason to
[38:24] Sister God he I'm just saying that I
[38:26] wanted to keep my regular routine of
[38:29] fasting and so God heard my prayer and
[38:31] that's just God's grace but I'm just
[38:34] letting you know like we're all tempted
[38:35] at times but there's times God will put
[38:37] it on you
[38:41] Hallelujah but we should fast as a
[38:44] memorial to God we should fast out of a
[38:47] respect to God that's showing God
[38:50] respect
[38:52] Hallelujah brother said and so after
[38:54] 3:00 you should have something little
[38:57] like he said like a
[38:59] sandwich so on his fast days he wouldn't
[39:02] eat till 3:00 and then just go get a
[39:04] sandwich that was Tuesdays and Fridays
[39:08] were fast
[39:10] days now this is just interesting
[39:13] brother Ram said a uh a friend of his
[39:15] named brother Roy it might have been Roy
[39:17] Roberson he said one day you overe eat
[39:20] on corn and when you did you fell
[39:23] violently ill and your mother put you on
[39:25] bed and started you with and that
[39:26] started you with epileptic fits and he
[39:29] said you've had them ever since and then
[39:30] brother BR prayed for him so I don't
[39:33] know if the overeating was causing the
[39:35] epilepsy or not but I'm just saying it
[39:36] was part of the story okay so I looked
[39:38] up the overeating quotes brother man
[39:41] said now when a person gets overfed gets
[39:43] drowsy or lazy we can all say Amen to
[39:45] that right eat too much at the buffet or
[39:47] eat too much at home you feel lazy and
[39:50] so we know it's a snare it's a trap to
[39:52] try to get us lazy for the
[39:54] Lord right brother even said this
[39:58] himself he was he went traveling and
[40:00] preaching up in
[40:02] Arizona he said I I ran myself down by
[40:06] overeating with overk kindness of the
[40:08] people down in the mountains I got sick
[40:10] so I haven't felt good this week and the
[40:12] brother makes a joke and said you ate
[40:14] too much a possum brother
[40:16] brandom and brother BR laughs he says
[40:18] brother Carl Williams with his sense of
[40:20] humor he he says I think we read need it
[40:23] right now because he wasn't feeling
[40:25] good and brother R said no well he said
[40:28] uh I don't know about that brother Carl
[40:30] but a whole lot of squirrels and then
[40:31] brother random
[40:34] laughs but look what brother says so I
[40:37] want you to pray I'm sorry so if you
[40:39] want to pray for someone this morning I
[40:41] certainly would appreciate it if you
[40:43] pray for me because I need it now let us
[40:45] go quickly to the word so brother Ram
[40:48] admits I overate because the people kept
[40:50] giving me food but it's now made me sick
[40:52] and I need your
[40:54] prayers right but you can have a little
[40:56] humor in there EA too much squirrel
[40:59] meat but look look what it he he
[41:01] experiences
[41:02] himself right that's why the Bible said
[41:05] have Temperance have self-control praise
[41:09] God now my outline and I I'll show this
[41:12] this afternoon I probably preach two
[41:14] sermons on this I didn't even set the
[41:15] timer so um my fault but my outline was
[41:20] just to start with Grace you know if I'm
[41:22] going to teach on health through the
[41:23] scripture you know eating healthy
[41:25] doesn't get you saved right eating
[41:27] healthy is a wise thing to do but that's
[41:29] not what saves you right cuz that's
[41:32] legalism well I'm saved cuz I eat
[41:34] healthier I'm saved because I don't get
[41:35] drunk now you're a legalist you're saved
[41:38] because you repented of your sins and
[41:39] you're trusting in the blood of Jesus
[41:40] Christ to forgive your sins the last
[41:43] thing I want to do is bring to these uh
[41:44] Amish people or some of their menite
[41:46] people the last thing I want to do is
[41:48] bring them into back into legalism some
[41:49] of them are already probably bound to it
[41:52] but I want to show you this is a message
[41:53] of Grace amen the Bible is a message of
[41:56] God's favor to you
[41:57] Amen in other words God loves you so
[41:59] he's given you wisdom on how to treat
[42:01] your body hallelujah
[42:03] amen right we're saved because of John
[42:06] 3:16 because God gave us his only son
[42:09] amen and then we have we're saved by
[42:11] grace through faith it's a gift of God
[42:14] not that any man should boast it's not
[42:16] by works that we're saved it's by grace
[42:18] that we're saved amen but then the Bible
[42:20] said you're created unto good
[42:24] works so see you're God's workmanship
[42:27] said you're God's Masterpiece and look
[42:28] at the Bible said you're fearfully
[42:30] wonderfully made I told one of my girls
[42:32] that this week I said honey you're
[42:33] fearfully wonderfully made who was it
[42:35] was it Haven all right well all of you
[42:37] are fearfully wondering
[42:39] made you're all God's
[42:42] Masterpiece and God created your body to
[42:45] be used by his Spirit to do
[42:47] something right to glorify him not to
[42:51] destroy your body but to glorify your
[42:54] body or I'm sorry glorify God through
[42:55] your body living a Godly life amen am
[42:59] and here's the verse many people forget
[43:00] you know the people that I you know I
[43:03] get people all the time accuse me of
[43:04] being a legalist right I get people all
[43:06] the time or they call me Pharisee this
[43:08] one internet preacher calls me the
[43:09] Pharisee from akan well there's a lot of
[43:12] Pharisees in akan but I'm not one of
[43:13] them
[43:14] amen because I don't teach Commandments
[43:16] of man I teach the Commandments of God
[43:20] you know why I called me that cuz I said
[43:21] you don't have a pastor and you don't go
[43:22] to church like the Bible says oh you're
[43:24] a Pharisee okay I see as a real Pharisee
[43:27] he's the real Pharisee cuz he's now
[43:28] created uh loopholes where he don't have
[43:30] to go to church and he don't have to
[43:31] have a
[43:32] pastor see the devil always does that
[43:35] whatever he accuses you of that's what
[43:36] he's guilty of right always like that
[43:39] always that's right you can always
[43:40] whatever they're accusing you of that's
[43:42] what they're guilty
[43:43] of like I had people accuse me of years
[43:46] ago they accused me of money things I
[43:47] wonder if they were using their money
[43:49] the right way why are they so interested
[43:51] in the money cuz some maybe they got
[43:53] lust of the money right maybe they're
[43:55] lusting over money maybe they got the
[43:56] Love of Money is the root of all evil
[43:58] amen and the church said I should have
[44:00] asked him about that if I got another
[44:02] chance I'll ask him about
[44:04] that but the the people fail to see the
[44:07] preaching on
[44:09] sanctification look at 2 Corinthians 7:1
[44:12] having therefore these promises dearly
[44:14] beloved now look beloved you're God's
[44:17] beloved let us cleanse ourselves from
[44:20] all everybody say all all filthiness
[44:23] which is
[44:24] defilement yeah so if we know defiles us
[44:27] now for me fast food I found out fast
[44:30] food defiles
[44:32] me I need to cleanse myself from all
[44:36] defilement of the Flesh and the
[44:39] spirit because this perfects Holiness in
[44:42] the fear of God Amen in other words I
[44:46] Fear God I don't want to defile the body
[44:48] that God gave me and so I'm going to
[44:51] grow uh in how to treat my body and my
[44:55] spirit in other words especially for for
[44:57] us I'm not going to look at those
[44:59] websites I'm not going to listen to that
[45:00] YouTuber I'm not going to listen to that
[45:02] podcast anymore we got to be very
[45:04] careful what we do with our flesh and
[45:07] our
[45:09] spirit right none of us here thank God
[45:11] none of us are going to Soul or sell our
[45:12] souls to the devil like these evil
[45:14] celebrities they they actually say it
[45:17] right uh who was it Bob Marley said he
[45:21] sold his soul to the devil uh Katie
[45:24] Perry said she sold her soul to the
[45:26] devil m Snoop Dog said he sold his soul
[45:29] to the
[45:30] devil none of us are going to do that
[45:33] right and and look at their lives their
[45:35] lives prove they have but look at our
[45:37] lives our lives prove the spirit of
[45:39] God's in our soul amen CU I'm a new
[45:42] creature in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I
[45:45] walk after the spirit and not after the
[45:47] flesh Hallelujah right but see the Bible
[45:50] says see we need to be mature in other
[45:51] words let's clean out all the defilement
[45:55] in our bodies and our spirit because we
[45:57] want to show reverence to God we want to
[46:00] show fear of God Amen I heard brother
[46:02] man just say it yesterday brother said
[46:04] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[46:05] wisdom that's just the beginning he was
[46:07] emphasizing that I've been listening to
[46:09] the message of Grace 1961 I thought I
[46:12] was going to preach it this morning but
[46:13] I thought I'd preach this
[46:17] instead brother said that's just the
[46:19] beginning so when you when you and I
[46:21] finally get to the spot like oh I better
[46:23] not eat or I better not drink this or I
[46:24] better not do that when we finally when
[46:26] we finally get to that spot like I maybe
[46:28] I shouldn't do this because God might
[46:30] not like it now you're just at the
[46:32] beginning of wisdom and the church said
[46:35] that's just the
[46:37] beginning now what's the advance the
[46:39] advanced day is you deny yourself of it
[46:42] eternally or forever right what I mean
[46:45] by that is uh I won't uh you know I used
[46:49] to smoke cigarettes as a sinner I used
[46:51] to chew
[46:52] tobacco and now I won't do it anymore I
[46:55] I will always deny myself of that
[46:57] I thought about it today I just realized
[46:58] the last Pop I drank was in
[47:01] 2012 so I've been free from pop for 12
[47:04] years
[47:05] now and that was only because they had
[47:07] nothing else at the church I was
[47:08] preaching in Guyana it was like 100
[47:10] degrees well at least I felt I'm
[47:12] probably exaggerating right I preached
[47:14] two hours straight and I'm like you guys
[47:16] got anything to
[47:17] drink and they hand me a can of pop I
[47:19] said do you have any
[47:20] water okay I'll drink this just cuz my
[47:24] throat was burning and dying I felt like
[47:25] I was dying
[47:29] but see you you cleanse yourself from
[47:30] that's the mature State I'll never drink
[47:32] that again as long as I got the
[47:34] choice cuz I got a healthy pop now it's
[47:36] called
[47:38] Kucha that's the reality of it it tastes
[47:42] better than b
[47:45] Hallelujah but see God always has a
[47:47] better choice Hallelujah but see we have
[47:49] to be committed to that and we have to
[47:51] be willing to grow in Grace amen and
[47:54] grow in knowledge oh now I've grow now I
[47:56] understand understand why I shouldn't
[47:57] eat this I shouldn't drink that I
[47:58] shouldn't go there I shouldn't think
[48:00] that I shouldn't say
[48:04] that so see it's it's all part about you
[48:06] know why don't the churches when when
[48:08] they call me uh a Pharisee why don't
[48:11] they look at this scripture they they
[48:13] won't right right because they're
[48:15] willingly ignorant of the word of God
[48:18] the Bible said you need to perfect
[48:19] Holiness think about it you should be
[48:23] mature in
[48:24] Holiness you should have an advant state
[48:27] of
[48:28] maturity you shouldn't just give
[48:30] yourself over to the lust of the flesh
[48:32] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[48:33] life you should be ring against Satan
[48:35] hallelujah amen glory you shouldn't be a
[48:39] baby where you can be pushed around
[48:40] right or a child push Satan can push you
[48:42] into all these Temptations you should
[48:44] have a backbone brother Ram
[48:46] says and stand up to the devil
[48:49] Hallelujah and know where I'm standing
[48:51] Hallelujah you should perfect Holiness
[48:54] in the fear of God Amen
[48:57] like the angel told Brother randam don't
[48:59] smoke or drink or chew or defy your body
[49:02] in any way there's a work for you to do
[49:04] what about us there's something God's
[49:06] called us to do
[49:07] hallelujah amen you know I'll just say
[49:11] this my grandfather died because of the
[49:13] complications because of
[49:15] diabetes he lost years of his life
[49:17] because too much sugar and too much fast
[49:20] food I prayed for him the one time he
[49:22] had numbness in his leg because of
[49:24] diabetes I prayed for him and he said
[49:25] all the numbness left him I don't know
[49:28] how long that Victory lasted imagine if
[49:30] he went back to eat his favorite was
[49:31] White Castle hamburgers I wonder if he
[49:34] probably went back to White Castle
[49:36] hamburgers he that numbness probably
[49:37] came
[49:38] back but he had to live his the final
[49:41] last Decades of his life as a
[49:43] diabetic yeah and he just lost out and
[49:46] he even told me he lost out he wanted to
[49:48] travel to preach but the diabetes kept
[49:49] him from
[49:51] that See You Know The Enemy tries to rob
[49:53] us of the Ministries God has for us
[49:56] remember our our dear precious brother
[49:58] the late brother James I told you this
[50:01] you know I asked him brother you know
[50:02] what what's one advice you give me as a
[50:04] young preacher over there on
[50:06] Waterland and he said uh he said I ate
[50:09] too much fast food and I didn't take
[50:11] care of my body I never
[50:13] exercised he said now I have heart
[50:15] problems because of that and he just
[50:16] died a few years after
[50:19] that so I'm trying to take these to
[50:21] heart you
[50:23] know that we have a limited amount of
[50:26] time and I want to apply my mind to
[50:30] wisdom I want to fear God Amen now
[50:34] Church let's be honest sometimes
[50:35] Temptations come your way and you will
[50:38] turn down a Temptation because you're
[50:41] afraid but it's Godly fear right amen
[50:45] right a temptation's say let's say a
[50:48] Temptation comes around for you to lie
[50:49] or steal or cheat yeah and it's good if
[50:53] you're afraid to do that amen cuz that's
[50:55] Godly fear hallelujah thank God for
[50:58] Godly fear hallelujah
[51:01] amen like what would happen if if uh
[51:04] what would happen if I did this oh then
[51:06] that would happen it bring reproach upon
[51:07] my family it bring reproach upon the
[51:09] Church of course thank God that's built
[51:11] into us hallelujah the spirit of God
[51:13] puts that into
[51:15] US amen I'm thankful for we ought to be
[51:17] thankful for it Hallelujah sir to keep
[51:20] us from bringing a stain upon the the
[51:22] body of Christ that's right but when you
[51:25] got that that's just the beginning of it
[51:28] amen that's the beginning of it Hebrews
[51:31] 12:28 wherefore we re receiving a
[51:33] kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[51:35] have Grace whereby we may serve God
[51:37] acceptably with reverence and godly
[51:40] fear so acceptable service to God is
[51:44] having reverence and godly fear towards
[51:47] God
[51:49] Amen Hallelujah so I so in my case you
[51:52] I've even heard my brother talk about it
[51:54] uh diabetes if if it runs in my family
[51:57] my uncle's had it my uncle my other
[51:59] uncle died of
[52:00] cancer that's on my mom's side on my
[52:02] dad's side they're all addicted to
[52:04] either alcohol or cigarettes or all
[52:05] kinds of all kinds of addictions if I
[52:08] know that's those are the spirits that
[52:10] are about me well I better have Godly
[52:12] fear and not even give any of that an
[52:14] inch Hallelujah of course I wouldn't
[52:15] because I got the Holy Ghost but I'm
[52:17] just talking logically Hallelujah
[52:20] logically that runs in the
[52:23] family see and that that and I'm glad
[52:26] that does scare me I don't want to be a
[52:29] diabetic right I don't want to
[52:32] be uh filled with cancer because it's my
[52:35] fault you know right
[52:39] Hallelujah I love 1 Corinthians 10:31
[52:42] whether therefore you eat or drink or
[52:44] whatsoever you do do all to the glory of
[52:47] God Amen so the whole point of this and
[52:49] this is the word I should have youed
[52:50] sooner but the whole point of this is
[52:52] stewardship you're a steward or overseer
[52:55] of God's body that he gave you everybody
[52:58] understand that so it's not really yours
[53:01] right it's God's body he purchased it
[53:03] with his blood and you're just taking
[53:05] care of it
[53:09] Hallelujah you're a steward of it right
[53:11] and the good example is I'm a school
[53:14] teacher so who's the steward of the
[53:16] school the superintendent the
[53:18] superintendent is the steward you know I
[53:20] I the last time I looked I think our
[53:22] district I can't remember now but I'll
[53:23] just give a broad number our district
[53:25] gets $50 million of taxes every year and
[53:27] he's got to decide where does that 50
[53:29] million go he's a steward of it yeah
[53:33] right now now we know how all these
[53:34] politicians they're bad stewards because
[53:36] they fund all this money to themselves
[53:38] and their
[53:39] friends see that's a that's a bad
[53:41] Steward
[53:43] yeah I'm a steward right I'm a steward
[53:46] as a pastor tithes and offerings I'm a
[53:48] steward of that y
[53:51] right each one of us are stewards of
[53:54] what God has given to us and each one
[53:56] one of us will answer the Bible said for
[53:58] the Deeds Done in the
[53:59] body so we all know Jesus said we all
[54:03] know we all got to stand before Jesus
[54:04] and give an account what' you do with
[54:05] your money he's also going to say what'
[54:07] you do with your your
[54:08] health right what' you do with your
[54:10] thought life what you do with your
[54:12] marriage what you do with your children
[54:13] the church said all the talents all the
[54:16] things all the blessings he G you what'
[54:18] you do with it amen hallelujah amen it
[54:21] was yours anyway that's why I'm going to
[54:23] I'm going to serve with reverence
[54:24] Hallelujah mhm I'm to serve with Godly
[54:27] fear cuz I know one day I've got to
[54:29] answer for it praise
[54:33] God so it's stewardship your health is
[54:36] stewardship your time is stewardship y
[54:40] amen right remember that story brother
[54:42] cam he told him when he was here when he
[54:43] first became a pastor there was these uh
[54:45] there was this couple that just kept
[54:46] stealing all his time wanted to talk to
[54:48] him about every single thing right and
[54:50] he said as soon as he uh tried to
[54:52] correct it they left the
[54:55] church right maybe that's not the right
[54:57] way right way but anyways as soon as he
[54:59] brought some correction to it like you
[55:00] know I I can't give you this much time I
[55:02] can only give you a little time that
[55:03] person left and brother cam took it as a
[55:06] learning experience I've got to protect
[55:07] my time I've got to be a steward over my
[55:10] time God's got to have my time first yes
[55:14] right and all preachers and all dads got
[55:17] to learn that right all
[55:20] uncles all aunties and Grandpa grandmas
[55:23] we all got to learn that we're stewards
[55:26] of of all the blessings and gifts that
[55:27] God gives us praise God Amen so see a
[55:30] good Steward takes care of what God
[55:32] they've been given and we've been given
[55:34] a body Soul and Spirit along with that
[55:37] we've been given money time food drink
[55:40] all these
[55:42] things now at that point in my talk I
[55:45] went to self-control as a fruit of the
[55:47] spirit uhuh and I just I say this if
[55:50] we're eating and drinking in an
[55:52] unhealthy manner we forsaken the
[55:54] anointing of the Holy Spirit and that
[55:56] means we're feeding the lust of the
[55:59] flesh so we got a we got a evil spirit
[56:02] like we're just giving into it maybe
[56:03] it's laziness or maybe it's uh something
[56:06] like that but it's not like you're
[56:08] possessed by a devil right but it just
[56:10] means that we we're we're surrendering
[56:13] to the wrong thoughts right we're
[56:14] accepting the wrong thoughts remember
[56:16] the Bible said neither give place to the
[56:18] devil I just looked up this week
[56:19] Ephesians 4:27 you're giving the devil a
[56:22] thought or a place in your mind you're
[56:24] thinking the devil's thoughts but we
[56:25] don't want to think those dirty thoughts
[56:27] amen amen we don't want to think those
[56:29] filthy thoughts we want to think the
[56:30] pure thoughts of God the the fearful
[56:32] thoughts of fearing the Living God
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:35] amen that's
[56:38] right and church you know we've all been
[56:40] guilty of you know brother said I think
[56:42] I said I texted this to brother not
[56:44] brother Nia maybe oh brother uh brother
[56:47] Howard I sent brother Howard a text
[56:49] Brother R said the devil always fights
[56:51] me when I'm tired and overworked that's
[56:53] when I get the hardest Temptations right
[56:55] and we all know we're tired or something
[56:57] like that that's when we'll compromise
[56:58] on our diet right or or sometimes maybe
[57:02] even
[57:03] sin right so we have to we have to know
[57:06] that we can't give the devil a place
[57:09] right like I said we got to speak the
[57:11] word of God we got to rebuke Satan
[57:13] Hallelujah got to say Satan get behind
[57:15] me get thee behind me Satan Hallelujah
[57:17] in the name of Jesus
[57:19] Christ
[57:21] Hallelujah now self-control is a fruit
[57:23] of the spirit we saw in uh second Peter
[57:25] 1:6 about Temperance Paul calls
[57:27] Temperance a fruit of the spirit
[57:28] Galatians 5 22-
[57:31] 24 Paul said I have to have it in 1
[57:34] Corinthians 9: 25- 27 or else I'll be a
[57:40] Castaway uh we're gearing up for the
[57:42] Summer Olympics right no not us but the
[57:44] people are gearing up for the Summer
[57:45] Olympics any Olympian knows you have to
[57:47] train 20 you have to train 365 days a
[57:50] year for years if you want to be in the
[57:52] Olympics if you want to be the best of
[57:54] the best you got to be diligent that's
[57:56] why Peter said give all diligence
[57:59] Amen to make your calling election
[58:02] sure Hallelujah and that's natural
[58:05] Olympics and Paul said they do it to to
[58:07] win a you know a gold medal that they
[58:10] can take a picture and they can bite it
[58:11] like this
[58:13] they that's why they do it to gain a
[58:15] piece of gold but we do it to gain
[58:18] eternal life Hallelujah a white robe
[58:20] Hallelujah that's why we do it amen amen
[58:23] we do it to gain a white robe by the
[58:25] Holy Spirit
[58:29] remember the Bible said God would
[58:30] Prosper I'm sorry God would that we
[58:32] prosper in health even as our soul
[58:35] prospers we can't Prosper if we're not
[58:37] fearing god with what we eat and what we
[58:39] drink
[58:42] hallelujah hallelujah remember lust of
[58:44] the flesh this this scripture
[58:47] here now I just want to give a few
[58:49] things here now I'm kind to get into
[58:50] some uh just some generic statements
[58:54] here but you know in the Bible days they
[58:56] didn't they weren't living in the days
[58:58] we are we're living in the
[59:00] industrialized Society right so in the
[59:04] Bible days they only had real bread but
[59:07] today most of the bread on the store
[59:08] shelves is not real
[59:10] bread right it has bleach flour
[59:13] preservatives it's not fermented long
[59:15] enough and there's many more problems in
[59:17] the bad
[59:18] bread right
[59:20] church so the Bible diet is different
[59:23] than today's diet unless we make efforts
[59:25] to have the right
[59:27] diet and they had of course real meat
[59:30] now we got to be careful with the meat
[59:31] we buy today mostly the worst meat is
[59:33] fast food
[59:35] meat
[59:37] right like I was looking at something
[59:39] online and um even Chick-fil-A they put
[59:43] this coating on their meat it's all
[59:46] chemicals and they inject sugar into
[59:48] their meat but if you go to the store
[59:50] and buy meat you know from the the
[59:52] poultry Department there whatever
[59:54] they're not they don't have they don't
[59:55] inject sugar sugar into their meat so we
[59:58] got to be selective about what we eat
[1:00:02] right so have to remember they had real
[1:00:04] bread they had real meat and we must do
[1:00:07] our best to have the right Foods
[1:00:10] Hallelujah you know most of today's
[1:00:12] fruits and vegetables are sprayed with
[1:00:13] pesticides we got to be careful there
[1:00:15] too right and they also have less
[1:00:17] nutrient content right because they're
[1:00:20] uh they're genetically modified so they
[1:00:22] can sit there on the Shelf
[1:00:24] longer right so they don't get they
[1:00:26] don't ride out faster yeah that's why
[1:00:28] it's good to get fresh
[1:00:30] produce right so
[1:00:34] Hallelujah do I understand everything
[1:00:36] I'm saying not
[1:00:37] exactly I'm just trying to learn from my
[1:00:40] wife IAH think about the Bible days you
[1:00:43] know Bible days didn't have all those
[1:00:45] sprays
[1:00:49] right now I wish I could yeah
[1:00:53] now try not to go too fast today
[1:00:57] now when I taught at that uh event there
[1:00:59] back in uh April 23 I just gave five
[1:01:03] guidelines and I gave some warnings I'm
[1:01:04] just going to go over that here for a
[1:01:06] few minutes here I'm already at 11:30
[1:01:08] okay okay so about to preach about an
[1:01:10] hour okay I'll go a little bit further
[1:01:12] and then I'll finish here tonight by
[1:01:14] God's grace just let's just take one
[1:01:16] Sunday and overcome the lust of the
[1:01:17] flesh a good good reminder on the lust
[1:01:19] of the flesh amen amen I need it I know
[1:01:22] you do too I'm sure you do do it I need
[1:01:23] it often from time to time so I gave
[1:01:26] five guidelines the first guideline is
[1:01:28] that the uh eating meat is a good thing
[1:01:32] as long as it's the right kind of meat
[1:01:33] like I said you don't fast food meat is
[1:01:35] probably the worst kind yeah it depends
[1:01:37] what they do to it right depends what
[1:01:39] they do to
[1:01:41] it uh that's in 1 Timothy 4 let's go to
[1:01:44] 1 Timothy 4 these ones I don't have on
[1:01:46] my no I do yeah 1 Timothy
[1:01:50] 4:3 now remember in context Paul says
[1:01:54] seducing spirits will anoint people to
[1:01:57] say you can't eat meat that's why I told
[1:02:00] that brother Irvin I said that's from
[1:02:02] hell that's from the devil trying to
[1:02:04] tell you you can't eat pork now maybe
[1:02:06] you got to eat it moderation right and
[1:02:08] make sure it's the right kind of pork
[1:02:09] from the right kind of farms and so
[1:02:11] forth and you don't want to overeat on
[1:02:13] certain types of meat of course but the
[1:02:16] the the Bible says forbidding to marry 1
[1:02:18] Timothy 4:3 remember doctrines of devils
[1:02:21] so a devil will say you can't marry
[1:02:26] right there was a scandal I'm just going
[1:02:28] to briefly share this there's a scandal
[1:02:30] not far from here if I'm not mistaken it
[1:02:32] it was kyoga Falls I'm not mistaken
[1:02:34] about 10 years ago and the ministry was
[1:02:37] telling the people the preachers were
[1:02:39] telling the people don't get married
[1:02:40] because the Rapture is too close and you
[1:02:43] don't want to raise kids in this uh this
[1:02:45] wicked
[1:02:46] world that's
[1:02:49] foolishness that's
[1:02:50] foolishness that was a doctrine of a
[1:02:53] devil that's so selfish yeah right and
[1:02:57] it also goes against God's command to be
[1:02:58] fruitful and
[1:03:01] multiply and later that church had
[1:03:03] scandals about
[1:03:05] abuse sexual abuse with the
[1:03:08] leaders see wherever there's leav I'm
[1:03:11] going to preach on that here pretty soon
[1:03:12] by God's grace if they don't clean out
[1:03:14] that leaven it's only going to grow yeah
[1:03:16] it's going to cause some type of sin in
[1:03:18] the F in the church the church family I
[1:03:20] say like
[1:03:21] that but the Bible said don't give heed
[1:03:24] to it don't accept it the Devils that
[1:03:26] say forbid to marry or command to
[1:03:29] obstain from
[1:03:30] Meats right vegetarian only well you're
[1:03:32] missing out if you're a vegetarian I'll
[1:03:34] tell you that we had my wife make some
[1:03:36] lamb man my goodness you're missing out
[1:03:39] if you're a vegetarian I just can't stop
[1:03:41] licking my fingers after eating that
[1:03:44] lamb like man this is the best meat I've
[1:03:46] ever had in my life no wonder God gave
[1:03:48] them lamb
[1:03:52] Hallelujah which God hath created to be
[1:03:54] received with Thanksgiving God said you
[1:03:56] should receive it with Thanksgiving amen
[1:03:58] which believe and know the truth
[1:04:01] remember God came down in Genesis 18 and
[1:04:03] abrah get said go get some meat go go
[1:04:06] get some beef and give God some beef and
[1:04:07] God ate it Hallelujah you had some milk
[1:04:10] you had some cheese there and some beef
[1:04:13] from Abraham and Sarah so Sarah did a
[1:04:15] good job with that meat Hallelujah she
[1:04:17] could really cook that meat God liked it
[1:04:21] for every creature of god let's say
[1:04:23] creature of God ready creature of God
[1:04:27] every creature of God is
[1:04:29] good right and not nothing to be refused
[1:04:32] if it be received with Thanksgiving but
[1:04:35] a lot of foods you buy going out to eat
[1:04:36] those aren't creatures of God or they're
[1:04:39] modified creatures of
[1:04:41] God so you got to be very
[1:04:45] careful right so you see most fast foods
[1:04:48] are not creatures of God y but Paul
[1:04:52] gives us the freedom to eat the right
[1:04:53] kind of meat MH and this related of
[1:04:56] course to the brother Irvin situation
[1:04:58] down there the battle against
[1:05:00] legalism I said brother don't let that
[1:05:02] demonic legalism come back and don't let
[1:05:04] it come on your church that's the same
[1:05:07] Spirit they overcame it's the fear of
[1:05:09] man y they in the Amish community
[1:05:11] they're under the fear of man and then
[1:05:13] by the grace of God the message Has
[1:05:14] Lifted it off them and then Satan sends
[1:05:16] this guy in there to try to bring them
[1:05:18] back under bondage right but what what
[1:05:21] the Bible say be not entangled again
[1:05:23] with the Lo of with the yok of bondage
[1:05:25] Hal
[1:05:27] but you're God's free servants you're
[1:05:28] the people of God
[1:05:31] hallelujah that's interesting you know
[1:05:33] even a day like this Satan's still
[1:05:35] trying to bring legalism back into the
[1:05:36] churches yeah with diet oh you shouldn't
[1:05:40] eat meat you shouldn't eat shrimp or you
[1:05:42] shouldn't eat pork like we
[1:05:44] said now the second point I made was you
[1:05:46] know you might want to do a vegetarian
[1:05:47] diet for a temporary
[1:05:49] time but if you go vegetarian the
[1:05:52] fulltime you're going to miss out on a
[1:05:53] lot of important nutrients and meat you
[1:05:56] saw that with Daniel remember Daniel
[1:05:57] 1:12 Daniel said give us 10 days we're
[1:06:00] just going to eat vegetables and drink
[1:06:02] water and after 10 days they look
[1:06:04] healthier in the face than all these
[1:06:06] people eating meat yeah
[1:06:10] right and then he said then when Daniel
[1:06:12] fasted in Daniel 10:3 he said I ate no
[1:06:15] Pleasant bread I don't wonder what that
[1:06:16] Pleasant bread means I looked it up and
[1:06:18] I didn't know what it
[1:06:19] meant neither came flesh nor wine in my
[1:06:23] mouth so when Daniel fasted he also
[1:06:25] didn't eat flesh neither did I anoint
[1:06:28] myself at all till three whole weeks
[1:06:30] were fulfilled that's quite a fast there
[1:06:33] yeah and that's when God remember God
[1:06:35] sent the angel we looked at that how the
[1:06:36] Angels wrestled right Michael come
[1:06:38] around and said let me fight this Prince
[1:06:39] of Persia and then the angel could get
[1:06:41] down there and delivered to Daniel
[1:06:44] Hallelujah so pul means vegetables
[1:06:47] that's why you know you've heard uh Rick
[1:06:49] Warren of course he's a false teacher
[1:06:50] he's he's in cahoot with the Pope but he
[1:06:53] did a series on uh the Daniel diet it
[1:06:55] helped I I forget how many thousands of
[1:06:57] pounds the people in a church lost they
[1:06:58] added up all the pounds they lost well
[1:07:01] the first of all they're probably eating
[1:07:02] really unhealthy right so if you go back
[1:07:05] if you go to a vegetarian diet for a
[1:07:07] short time yes you'll lose a lot of
[1:07:08] weight but you'll also miss out on some
[1:07:11] nutrients so yes you'll see effects of
[1:07:13] that there's wisdom of course the Bibles
[1:07:15] fill with the wisdom of
[1:07:17] God but remember it's a trap it's a
[1:07:19] snare Satan's trying to get you to focus
[1:07:21] too much on enjoying the lust of the
[1:07:24] flesh
[1:07:26] the lust of the eyes the pride of life
[1:07:28] These are snares these are traps and
[1:07:30] God's given us Grace to see the traps so
[1:07:32] we don't fall into them praise God Amen
[1:07:34] Hallelujah that's what the Bible said
[1:07:37] um L Satan should have an advantage on
[1:07:40] us we know Satan's devices I I kind of
[1:07:43] repeated that or switch that verse
[1:07:44] around but we're not ignorant of Satan's
[1:07:46] devices we know how Satan tries to trap
[1:07:49] each one of us how many how many can say
[1:07:50] Amen to that you've seen Satan try to
[1:07:52] trap you in this lust or this this Pride
[1:07:54] or whatever more you've seen it and so
[1:07:56] we got to we got to take advantage over
[1:07:59] Satan and live a Godly reverent fearful
[1:08:01] life Hallelujah not evil fear but Godly
[1:08:06] fear you'd be surprised somebody will
[1:08:08] take that clip and they'll say well
[1:08:09] brother jusie believes we should be a
[1:08:10] fearful
[1:08:11] people you
[1:08:13] devil leave me
[1:08:16] alone it's sad I should say God forgive
[1:08:20] them but see you know there there is a
[1:08:22] there is a time where this is what I
[1:08:24] call a natur natur cleansing this is the
[1:08:27] cleansing you people should do if they
[1:08:28] want to be cleansed right go to a really
[1:08:31] healthy
[1:08:32] diet okay that's what Daniel did as a
[1:08:34] cleanse now the third part I said was
[1:08:36] fasting Again Church fast uh D remember
[1:08:39] Daniel just drank water and had
[1:08:40] vegetables for that was a 21-day fast
[1:08:43] water and vegetable
[1:08:44] fast okay but brother R you know said
[1:08:47] normally I fast Tuesday Friday all night
[1:08:50] and into the morning till 300 p.m.
[1:08:52] that's my fasting but sometimes God will
[1:08:53] put me on a longer fast I'll fast all
[1:08:55] day or I'll fast uh two days or three
[1:08:57] days
[1:09:00] MH so so fasting cleanses you
[1:09:03] automatically right fasting is a natural
[1:09:06] cleansing for you right to cleanse your
[1:09:09] body and then the fourth point I brought
[1:09:11] out in uh uh that town I can't remember
[1:09:14] now what was that kidon there you go
[1:09:17] kidon was about wine uh trying to not
[1:09:20] drink wine out in public just uh drink
[1:09:23] it at Communion right I would not even
[1:09:26] advise it drink it in your home because
[1:09:27] most of the wine today has way more
[1:09:28] alcoholic content than in the days of
[1:09:30] Jesus like the wine they would drink at
[1:09:33] a wedding or something like that it had
[1:09:35] to have way way today's wine has way too
[1:09:38] much alcohol not even the same okay and
[1:09:41] then the last part I brought was balance
[1:09:43] I said you you just have to bring
[1:09:44] balance to your diet because remember
[1:09:46] when John the Baptist was here in Jesus
[1:09:48] they one of them was mocking uh Jesus
[1:09:50] because you're they say you're a wine
[1:09:52] Biber and then they were mocking uh um
[1:09:55] they're mocking John the Baptist right
[1:09:58] well they fast too much well you drink
[1:09:59] too much well I can't please I you can
[1:10:01] never please a devil amen you you can
[1:10:04] never please accusers of the Brethren
[1:10:05] you'll never please them because their
[1:10:08] whole focus is to find fault with you
[1:10:10] amen hallelujah remember that critical
[1:10:12] spirit scripture the Bible said a
[1:10:14] critical spirit a frower heart findeth
[1:10:16] no
[1:10:18] good right so you know somebody has a
[1:10:20] critical spirit when they say nothing
[1:10:22] good about you they only want to find
[1:10:23] fault with you
[1:10:26] Hallelujah right that's so you got to
[1:10:28] have the balance remember Paul yeah
[1:10:30] that's a good one Paul said in
[1:10:31] Philippians 4:6 let's read that
[1:10:32] Philippians 4:6 and S that's a good
[1:10:34] scripture for this right here I just
[1:10:36] read this weekend did uh maybe didn't
[1:10:40] think about emphasizing this I like to
[1:10:41] emphasize this Philippians 46 and
[1:10:50] 7 do it on time okay
[1:10:56] now actually let's read verse 5
[1:10:57] Philippians 4:5 let your moderation be
[1:10:59] known unto all men the Lord is at hand
[1:11:01] see moderation that self-control bodily
[1:11:04] uh humiliation bodily sanctification be
[1:11:07] careful for nothing be anxious for
[1:11:09] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[1:11:10] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:11:12] requests be made known to God and the
[1:11:13] peace of God which passes all
[1:11:15] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:11:16] Minds through Christ Jesus how many
[1:11:18] times do that helped you
[1:11:20] Church
[1:11:22] Hallelujah now Paul go down to verse
[1:11:25] 11 not not that I speak in respect of
[1:11:28] what for I have learned look Paul's a
[1:11:30] grown man I think he died at 65 if I'm
[1:11:32] not mistaken but he's still learning as
[1:11:34] he's in his 50s and 60s I have learned
[1:11:37] in whatsoever State I am there with to
[1:11:39] be
[1:11:41] content church I'm sure you and I we're
[1:11:43] still learning to be content in
[1:11:48] 2024 remember that was brother ad's
[1:11:50] father-in-law told him you know when he
[1:11:54] married hope brother man said I'm really
[1:11:56] poor I can hardly make her a living but
[1:11:57] I'll do everything I can and what did
[1:11:59] the father-in-law say the father-in-law
[1:12:01] said be content with the things that God
[1:12:04] has allotted you in
[1:12:05] life just learn to be content with what
[1:12:08] God has allotted you in life amen other
[1:12:10] words if God want you be rich he would
[1:12:11] have made you rich God wanted to make
[1:12:13] you middle class thank God God want to
[1:12:15] make you poor he might do that but the
[1:12:18] thing to do is be content in whatever
[1:12:20] state you find yourself in praise
[1:12:23] God right now look at verse 12 now look
[1:12:27] he had Paul had to learn I know how to
[1:12:29] be
[1:12:30] abased which means humbled and how to
[1:12:33] abound have lots of things y now this is
[1:12:36] inflation season so we're we're learning
[1:12:39] about being AB based most of
[1:12:42] us praise God if you're
[1:12:44] not see we have you know other time
[1:12:48] periods there's a lot more money
[1:12:49] inflation was down we're able to save
[1:12:52] more well this is a different time you
[1:12:54] have to learn to be content whatever
[1:12:55] time you're living in amen everywhere
[1:12:58] and in all things I'm instructed both to
[1:13:00] be full and to be hungry so see he knew
[1:13:04] how to be full right to eat he knew how
[1:13:06] to be hungry he knew how to
[1:13:09] fast both to abound and to suffer
[1:13:13] need so Paul could be in a spot where
[1:13:16] I'm suffering because I'm lacking but
[1:13:18] I'm still content amen now most of us
[1:13:20] don't have to deal with that most of us
[1:13:23] right like I don't have food I don't I
[1:13:25] don't have clothing I don't have
[1:13:28] transportation but Paul said I've
[1:13:30] learned that that's something the Holy
[1:13:31] Spirit has had to teach me so friends
[1:13:33] I'll just say like this whenever
[1:13:35] whenever we find ourselves discouraged
[1:13:37] let's pray God help me to be content in
[1:13:39] this situation am because I know you'll
[1:13:41] bring me out praise God Amen
[1:13:44] Hallelujah and church this is a prophet
[1:13:46] of God God God let a prophet who see
[1:13:49] Jesus who saw visions and dreams was
[1:13:52] caught up to the third heaven Hallelujah
[1:13:54] God let him be a spot where he was
[1:13:56] hungry and didn't have
[1:13:57] food only had one more coat left he only
[1:14:00] had one cloak Hallelujah and yet God
[1:14:03] could teach this man Godly fear and
[1:14:05] contentment I know God can teach us that
[1:14:07] as well how many believe that amen glory
[1:14:12] so I just taught the saint or not the
[1:14:13] Saints I I taught the people there the
[1:14:15] kidon balance so eating meat's okay
[1:14:19] right everything in
[1:14:21] moderation a vegetable diet can can be
[1:14:24] like a natural cleansing but don't don't
[1:14:26] just go all vegetables and then fasting
[1:14:29] and and limit your wine consumption for
[1:14:32] us it's only uh communion and then
[1:14:35] having a balance there's times of fast
[1:14:37] and there's times to there's time to
[1:14:38] enjoy a feast there's times for that as
[1:14:40] well we do that too much let's be honest
[1:14:41] we do that too much in America there's
[1:14:43] too much feasting didn't Jesus say or no
[1:14:46] Ecclesiastes said it's better to go to
[1:14:48] the house of morning than the house of
[1:14:51] feasting right like like that joke uh I
[1:14:53] forget who said that might have been
[1:14:54] brother cam
[1:14:56] the cam said you invite the church over
[1:14:57] for Fellowship uh everybody will come
[1:14:59] over for food you invite them to a
[1:15:01] special prayer meeting very few people
[1:15:03] come brother Williams laughing I've
[1:15:05] heard that for 20 years I've always
[1:15:07] thought was
[1:15:08] funny because people are always picked
[1:15:10] to go to the uh the natural blessings
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:15] the God help us
[1:15:22] amen now what I'll do is I'll
[1:15:27] um I'm going to close with
[1:15:30] this I I just want to show this to the
[1:15:32] church just for a moment
[1:15:34] here so here was the Tipping Point when
[1:15:37] I was I was abusing my body this is a
[1:15:39] sample of what it was like those are my
[1:15:45] feet I wanted to put that up on the
[1:15:47] screen there this was about 2012 I
[1:15:50] looked it up today it was
[1:15:52] 2012 and this is why this this topic is
[1:15:55] important to me cuz I've been through
[1:15:58] it
[1:16:00] okay and I've had to learn you know uh
[1:16:04] so you know growing up we were poor but
[1:16:06] whatever little money we did have every
[1:16:07] Friday you know my mom would buy us you
[1:16:09] know pizza and Coke that was our uh
[1:16:12] celebration because we made it through
[1:16:13] another week y'all know Grandma
[1:16:16] Ruby my children to celebrate you we
[1:16:19] made it through another week the bills
[1:16:21] are paid the lights are still on the
[1:16:22] water's still on the electricity is
[1:16:23] still on she was flurge a little bit and
[1:16:25] get all six of us some pizza and some
[1:16:27] coke you
[1:16:29] know you know but the the sad part is I
[1:16:31] got older I just got into the habit of
[1:16:33] going out to eat a lot McDonald's
[1:16:35] Wendy's Taco Bell you name it you know
[1:16:38] now when I got to college I was on
[1:16:40] scholarship so I got all these checks I
[1:16:43] was like a rich
[1:16:44] man I had more money than I even know
[1:16:47] what to do with cuz I was a poor boy
[1:16:50] well I got into really bad habits in
[1:16:52] college and I'd go to McDonald's for the
[1:16:54] Eggman muffin every
[1:16:56] morning then if I was out for lunch I'd
[1:16:59] get a a Wendy's Burger the Baconator
[1:17:02] well before whatever it was before the
[1:17:04] Baconator and then some nights I go get
[1:17:07] Chinese and uh yeah I was just ate way
[1:17:10] too much fast food and my favorite drink
[1:17:12] was Dr Pepper my H my wife probably
[1:17:15] remembers me buying that Dr
[1:17:18] Pepper and I didn't church I didn't
[1:17:20] realize that this was a snare of
[1:17:23] Satan right it's a snare of
[1:17:27] Satan and when it became a snare was
[1:17:31] around this time as soon as I would eat
[1:17:33] the fast food these red and that's just
[1:17:35] what was on my feet I told you it was
[1:17:37] all over my uh midsection loins and
[1:17:41] everything like that
[1:17:43] thighs short shortly after I eat a a
[1:17:46] Wendy's Burger I break out and it was
[1:17:49] itchy like I I sometimes I have to go in
[1:17:51] the bathroom just to
[1:17:53] itch right and I met another brother one
[1:17:56] of brother Brooks's children had the
[1:17:58] same thing but it would it manifests in
[1:17:59] their hands and they get red all these
[1:18:02] red dots over their hands and itchy
[1:18:04] hands
[1:18:07] okay and so uh I would lay at the altar
[1:18:10] my wife that altar out there that
[1:18:12] platform and that well this one but the
[1:18:14] platform I lay the Altar and say God
[1:18:16] give me Miracle God give me a miracle
[1:18:18] God give me a miracle brother Jim prayed
[1:18:19] for me numerous times for that
[1:18:21] Miracle well God didn't give me a
[1:18:23] miracle God gave me a wife
[1:18:27] said you're eating too much fast food
[1:18:29] drinking too much
[1:18:32] sugar and I went on like a 20 someday
[1:18:35] fast from
[1:18:37] sugar and now it's all I mean it's all
[1:18:40] gone but I had to maintain I I never get
[1:18:42] this anymore I never get this anymore I
[1:18:44] had to maintain that now this would hurt
[1:18:46] me uh I couldn't sleep at night some
[1:18:49] some nights I had trouble sleeping I
[1:18:52] wake up
[1:18:53] scratching now this hurt me the the most
[1:18:55] when I went over to you uh Guyana
[1:18:58] because they ate a lot of processed
[1:18:59] foods like you know foods that were not
[1:19:02] whole food just like food in a bag or
[1:19:05] food in a box you know all the
[1:19:08] preservatives all the chemicals in there
[1:19:10] all the pop they would give
[1:19:12] us this was FL it would flare up I took
[1:19:14] I actually took that picture in Guyana
[1:19:17] and because this would this would hinder
[1:19:18] me from you know just feeling good right
[1:19:22] feeling
[1:19:23] good and so that was the Tipping Point
[1:19:25] for me and then uh through the help of
[1:19:28] my
[1:19:29] wife you know I was able to learn how to
[1:19:32] uh and I'm still learning but I was able
[1:19:34] to learn some of these uh
[1:19:36] guidelines and so in the evening service
[1:19:38] I'm going to go through some guidelines
[1:19:40] on that and then I'll do like a Bible
[1:19:41] study and so forth uh by God's grace the
[1:19:44] last verse I want to read though is um
[1:19:46] you got your Bible Psalm 90 vers2 Psalm
[1:19:49] 90:2 I'm going to close with this I've
[1:19:50] already been an hour and a half has it
[1:19:51] felt like that has it hope it hasn't
[1:19:53] felt I've already seen pretty happy I
[1:19:55] don't see anybody sleeping so that's
[1:19:57] good by God's gra but if you need a rest
[1:19:59] get your rest
[1:20:00] amen Psalm
[1:20:03] 90:12 it's more of a lighthearted kind
[1:20:05] of message but still important super
[1:20:08] important if you if you're honest with
[1:20:09] yourself it's super
[1:20:10] important because it's a
[1:20:14] snare it's a trap of the devil to get
[1:20:17] your body sick right Satan wants to get
[1:20:19] your body sick so why so your body can't
[1:20:21] serve
[1:20:23] God right
[1:20:25] that's why and look and then people can
[1:20:26] lose their lives
[1:20:29] prematurely you know so then their loved
[1:20:31] ones will be without a a family member
[1:20:33] because they were caught in a snare
[1:20:36] that's especially apparent with drunk
[1:20:38] and driving and drugs now thank God
[1:20:40] those didn't don't impact Us by God's
[1:20:42] grace but you can easily see how it
[1:20:44] impacts people in that
[1:20:46] manner Psalm 90:12 so teach us what'
[1:20:49] Paul say Paul said I'm learning to be
[1:20:51] content as a grown man amen
[1:20:55] right a grown man like
[1:20:58] me so teach us to number our
[1:21:02] days so I had a a I had a
[1:21:07] uh sorry coworker died at 54 that's just
[1:21:11] 11 years older than
[1:21:13] me right brother mu's wife that's 15
[1:21:16] years older than
[1:21:18] me brother Cam and Simon just turned 45
[1:21:21] couple last week right my brother's
[1:21:24] Simon's
[1:21:25] 47 teach us to number our days that we
[1:21:28] might apply or give our hearts unto
[1:21:31] wisdom amen praise
[1:21:35] God and remember Church you know I
[1:21:37] always think of you know these examples
[1:21:38] you know God didn't call Abraham till he
[1:21:39] was
[1:21:40] 75 Moses finally got God finally got a
[1:21:43] hold of him at 80 years
[1:21:44] old brother Bosworth said I really
[1:21:47] didn't start my Ministry till I was in
[1:21:49] my 80s when I heard brother brandom
[1:21:50] preach yes but what if somebody
[1:21:53] mistreats their body you know like my
[1:21:55] grandpa or brother James like we talked
[1:21:56] about I don't know but they they
[1:21:59] admitted they missed out on missionary
[1:22:01] work because they didn't treat their
[1:22:03] body the right way friends I don't want
[1:22:05] to miss out on what God has for me
[1:22:07] because I don't have the wisdom to live
[1:22:09] it now amen you understand this is an
[1:22:12] awful snare if people don't treat their
[1:22:15] bodies the right
[1:22:18] way and so what we need is wisdom of the
[1:22:20] Holy
[1:22:21] Spirit to glorify God in our body and
[1:22:24] our Spirits which are Gods amen I have
[1:22:28] six kind of guidelines we'll go over uh
[1:22:30] this evening by God's grace but let's
[1:22:31] stand to our feet and musicians can come
[1:22:33] by God's
[1:22:39] grace a little different topic you know
[1:22:41] I've been preaching on the dimensions
[1:22:44] and I had another sermon ready to go but
[1:22:46] I just thought you know I'll just take
[1:22:47] all day today we'll look at the lust of
[1:22:49] the Flesh and overcoming that by the
[1:22:52] grace of God how many were helped today
[1:22:53] by the word of God
[1:22:55] God Amen let's bow our heads here for a
[1:22:56] word of
[1:22:57] prayer what did Jesus say Saints what he
[1:22:59] say he said Watch and Pray
[1:23:02] always that you don't get caught up in
[1:23:05] some type of
[1:23:07] lustful Trap Of Satan lust the Flesh and
[1:23:11] now it's also of course lust of the eyes
[1:23:13] pride of
[1:23:16] life These are snares Satan sets out and
[1:23:20] we've got to have the wisdom of God to
[1:23:23] overcome it and we will if we're
[1:23:25] watching and if we're praying amen so
[1:23:28] let's have a word of
