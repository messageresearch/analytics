all the way to the end amen let's think our Bibles tonight let's go to Colossians chapter 1 I like to preach a part 5 on the Christ and mystery of God reveal and I think this will be the final part and then we'll start get back and other messages Lord willing next week next Wednesday caution chapter 1 like to start there 17 the Bible says and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for please the father that in him should awfulness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled glory in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of i paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church where of I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his Saints now we know this mystery who was hid for 4,000 years to whom God made known or would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily hey men they God has blessed things of reading of his word may be seated praise God what a chapter huh what a way to end a chapter alright we'd like to finish this part here this part five here with this look at the stature I'm sorry no such crisis a mystery of God revealed we've looked at numerous parts of this but the main focus has been predestination and revelation and I think tonight we'll just look at a little bit more of each one and then it finishes with preeminence whether random ends this message with preeminence so I think we'll finish with that tonight by the grace of the Lord now I'd like to look at a few scriptures let's go brother branham quotes Matthew 11:25 so let's go there Matthew 11:25 we'll start a little more with revelation Matthew 11:25 now we ended Sunday night by looking at how everybody who is around the message necessarily doesn't really have the revelation of the message they have an intellectual understanding because their life and the fruits of their life expresses if they have the revelation or not whether someone would commit adultery or someone would almost commit adultery and flirt with other women yet they're married or if it's if it's women flirting with men or we saw perhaps how how people will let the TV in as we looked at or as we mentioned they're on Sunday night and and they'll just let the world back in they they kept the world out for so long but but then they let the world back in which is the lust of the eyes and the know the private life and it's that pride saying well III can still be in the message or I can still be a believer and I can still partake a worldly things well that's a diss section you can't you cannot flirt with the world and still be married to Jesus Jesus is not going to come back and rapture a church who's flirting with the world he's God he's that you wouldn't marry somebody like that right you wouldn't marry a flirter who would flirt with other people and so we see we ended with that people's lives eventually we'll prove Jesus said it's it's it's not difficult a tree is known by its fruit and it may take a long time to see people's fruit but pretty soon you're gonna see the fruit of their life amen and so we want our fruit to be godly fruit we want it to be christ-like fruit day men and brother have said see God holds the key to this revelation of Christ himself schools of theology can never find it jesus said so and brother man have said let's if you want to read it now he said Matthew 11:25 so I'm going to read that here and at that time jesus answered us and I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has to reveal them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight amen if you really love Jesus Christ and I mean really love him if he's really the love of your life then God sees you as a little babe he sees you as a little child but see if not if not if we really if there's something around the message but don't really love Jesus with all their hearts that God sees them as a stuffed shirt they just think they're better than other churches are better than other people as we said pride makes them say well well I can compromise on God's Word God really doesn't care and they'll make an excuse and say well if the thief on the cross wait at the end I'll make it too but that's the wrong idea the thief on the cross that was his only chance we might say and he made the most of that chance and he said the word is the word is right the word is pure the word is true and he judged the word right but when we flirt with the world and when people flirt with the world they're judging that the word is not right they're judging that the word doesn't really mean what it says it goes back to the Garden of Eden right where the serpent saying all that you'll you'll not surely die the words not really like that so see the thief on the cross is something totally different that was his first chance that was his only chance and he judged the word right amen and so God either sees us as a child or he sees us as a stuffed shirt someone who's self-proclaimed wise or a self-made wise person or a self-made righteous or religious person amen but remember what James chapter 1 says let's read it there since we just read that one let's go to James chapter 1 I believe it's verse 27 Hebrews and James here's how to know if your hearts pure verse 26 If any man among you seem to be religious and Brian's not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is in vain so if someone can't stop gossiping or can't stop cussing or can't stop criticizing or they can't tame their tongue the Bible said their religion is in vain how many know the Bible says let off the words of your mouth be full of grace how we know the Bible says that ministering grace to the hearer praise God verse 27 pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world amen hallelujah so we see that's what the revelation produces the revelation produces a spotless life because remember the people said Jesus's wife is without spot or blemish because she's lost in the waters of the word amen hallelujah well him says see the look at them pharisees the sadducees Herodians whatever they're great organizations jesus said you're blind leading the blind he said and if they're all leading the blind won't they all fall in the ditch both the leader and the blind to the leader will fall with the blind because he's blind also they both fall into the ditch and so see their lives fall into sin they fall into unbelief that they fall into the ways of Satan into the powers of darkness rather than the powers of God amen they fall into the ditch of false religion parmie sobra have said there's no school there's no theologian there's no teachings of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for eleventh know anything about it God has hidden the senses of knowing him from the very elected teachers and everything else aren't you glad Church if you tried to pay a hundred thousand dollars to go get a doctor degree you would never catch the message that's being preached to you for free tonight because Jesus said it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent I feel bad for those men and women theology they pay a hundred thousand dollars or 89 you know fit twenty-five thousand dollars a year to get a school of theology and they're not even getting what we're getting tonight amen because we're getting the true Word of God the true revelation God doesn't give Jesus said God doesn't give it through the schools he only you get it from the Heavenly Father praise God amen but brother Han says see it's he said it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ is revealed to them and if you say he's been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life isn't him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong revelation amen so if we got the right revelation it produces the same life of Jesus Christ now I know this is a lot of familiar things here but like I said I want to get you the same thoughts brother Branham said so you can hold them in your heart now he says by lack of this revelation so by the lack of revelation of the true message is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation they lack the revelation the teachers he says to see why are there divisions in our church at times why do other message churches have divisions it's because people don't have the revelation Amen because the revelation will not make you divided over sin for silly things the revelation of God will make you unite with other believers Amen hallelujah so perhaps that that's why we have divisions and mockery there's so much pretend religion is because there's a lack of revelation now I want to just read one more thing here where brother Branham says about Revelation and I'm skipping to the church ages book the brother banner says the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized revelation means more to you than you realize how many can say amen to that hallelujah I can never preach too much on how much we need more revelation you might yawn I might even yawn but I can preach on we need revelation we need God I could preach on that month after month year after year and I could never overemphasize it because revelation is God's will made known to you and that is what God wants God wants you and I to know his will and not only know it but he wants us to do it Damon and carry it out program says you can never overemphasize Revelation now he says this now then how Cain and he had a commandment but he didn't tell for the Revelator or didn't have a revelation so brother and said Cain couldn't get such a revelation like Abel had so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice it was a revelation from God that made the difference and gave Abel eternal life amen so that's how we'll be today Church the people who really live the message today will offer the right sacrifice what God really wants because they've got the right revelation some people would just be never able to really give the right sacrifice that God once because they don't have the revelation of it they hear preach I can preach it brother Keith Randolph brother Joe Adams whether cadre digs they can all preach the revelation to us or everyone else but only the elect will catch it only the ones that really have the the revelation of God will act upon it and do the will of God pigment Omaha that's right church it's so true and so we have to make sure our life looks just like Christ cuz Cain when he heard the the truth about the revelation he couldn't work it up to go off her blood and see that's what we've got it we've got to be able to have the revelation and not just know about it but we've got to work we got work it up but we just got to surrender ourselves right and do what God's Word actually says if we're not born again we got to find somewhere in the church or somewhere in our home to get alone with God and cry out to God until we get baptized with the Holy Ghost ain't ahead you just got to get a deal it praise God you just got to find that that that sacred place where you're fully cleaned out you're fully emptied out and then God can trust you with his word and then he can pour his Holy Spirit in your soul amen and then the way you'll know is what's your life after that that's how you know but see Cain couldn't get himself to offer that right sacrifice but Abel could able to offer the blood now what to read this I felt like God brought this story to me today I wasn't really planning on preaching it but it came to me you see the Bible says God or Christ came to seek and save that which was lost we were all lost in sin but God came to find us and we all remember the story of the Eagle right that was hatched in the chicken yard right we all remember that story and at some point in our life you know we were we were we wanted to be a Christian but we were around the wrong group praise God most of us I know I was for sure I was in many different churches where I thought they were egos but they were not but only those only the babes will the father reveal the revelation to and it's because they're the only ones that are truly Eagles right now one read this story this was from 2011 I don't know I've saved this on my on my Evernote I never preached it till tonight so it's been sitting there seven years and here it is today there is a a girl in New York and a little family New York it was her last name was white it was the white family and they had a little um they had a little baby girl and on August 4th 1987 I was almost 7 years old these parents in New York took their little daughter her name was Carlina and they took her to a hospital because she had a fever at Harlem so Harlem's hospital they took her to the emergency room the the nurses took her back to be tested and in a couple hours they kept asking for the baby to come back and the baby never came back the baby had vanished and the mother said though she said I lost my daughter and she cried out to God and said a big part of my heart was just ripped away and they never found the baby that was in Harlem in 1987 they never found the baby but what had happened there was a sort of crazy woman who dressed up like a nurse and she could never have a baby and she would constantly walk in the hospital and she she was able somehow to sneak her way past the nurse's office and and she took that baby Carlino white and drove her from New York I believe down to Alabama if I'm not mistaken or Atlanta I'm sorry Atlanta and so for 23 years the mother and father just were heart wrenched and and the baby was never found and and they never they never knew what happened to their daughter Carlina and they they went through all the government agencies no sign of her anywhere they had a sketch drawn of or what she might be and all these things well this whole time Carlina was growing up actually Connecticut first and then later Atlanta and her name given by her the woman who stole her was looks like nedra and so for 23 years this false mother raised this daughter Oh might has a happy ending Church I don't sad but it has that beheading a lot of them note but this one does and by the time you know as nedra grew up she just noticed and she look at the pictures the family pictures you know she'd be up on the wall there and she she'd see her mother no single single mother and she had a brother and then her picture and she always wondered how come my picture doesn't look like there's a face doesn't look like them I'm a different complexion I was a black woman she said I don't look anything like my mother and my brother and she said all these years you know my mom was kind to me but never had any heartfelt connection to me and she said you know growing up you know the the the brother which really wasn't her brother would get the love from the mother but she wouldn't and then when she was six you know she was fornicating and had a baby and she tried to get a driver's license so she could drive the baby well she went to her mother in there in Atlanta and said uh could I have my social security card and she didn't have one but she had some type of form so she took it to the Social Security office and took it there and said no that's a forgery you might get under arrest for that and so she left it and she said bother who cares bother with don't bother with it so she didn't never got a car and then she said there was no paperwork to follow up as there was no birth certificate no social social security card she was not able to get a driver's license and she saw no resemblance so she just grew suspicious and then all of a sudden she said I just had a feeling and I felt different people were raising me then should have been raising so she had all these signs all these years I don't feel love I don't look like them I don't really act like them they have really no proof that I'm one of them and she said all of a sudden she had a feeling and then she had it she had this feeling well I'm gonna look on websites and see if anyone was missing a child about my age so she went to the year of her birth and she spotted a photo of a baby and then put it next to a composite picture of her and she said that's me praise God so she took matters in their own hands she seated a mouth swab and sending in for the DNA with the DNA of the baby that they had the blood work and it matched and 23 years later she got reunited with her parents in Harlem now I'm I saying that I'm saying that because that's just like you and I praise God you and I I know I went into that I got saved but I never really felt like I was in the right place how come I want more of the weird when I'm going to church people who cuss and swear and want to go to movies that want to fornicate with women and they want to do all these evil things and they want to do rock and roll go to parties and drink it even before I knew the message I didn't want to go to parties like these guys they'd party on Saturday night and then come to church on Sunday morning in the college group and talk about being hungover and how come I was never comfortable with that how come they could do drugs and go so far but I could never go that far and then pretty soon it came to me I wasn't one of them I realized I was like that Eagle in the chicken yard amen I was predestinated there's something else amen hallelujah and I started searching and thank God my brother saw him and started searching he started searching there's got to be more to this and pretty soon he realized that he wasn't a denominational person but what he was what we were was true children of God our picture of every picture in God's photo album doesn't look like the foolish virgin it doesn't look like denominations it doesn't look like the mother harlot it looks like the life of Jesus amen we never looked like that we didn't act like that we don't feel comfortable like that see there's always something deep down inside of us that knew that God's Word is true and thank God that that hunger started searching right started hungry for more of God and thank God that he said his voice of his heavenly eagle mother right to make the Eagle scream so we could hear the Word of God respond to it and recognize who we are and come to our position in Christ amen amen hallelujah her exact words she said was this I'm so happy at the same time it's a funny feeling because everything's brand new it's like being born again and that's what the message is the message reveals who you are you're not just a church member you're not just somebody trying to be religious you are a child of God amen and you're supposed to act just like God amen you're supposed act just like God son Jesus and you're supposed to be men are you Jesus amen and it's like I'm born again oh thank God I am born again amen oh that's beautiful I just had to preach that tonight amen the deep calls to the deep and this is why there's so much division even the message or any church you go to is because there's a lack of revelation in other words people haven't received the love of the truth they don't really love the truth they can recognize it and intellectually say well that looks right but they don't actually love it they don't want to do the will of God amen now brother Branham quotes Ephesians chapter one which is why put on Facebook this morning verse what's read Ephesians 1 verse 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus program says how do you get into Jesus Christ by joining church no by a birth by one spirit first Corinthians 12 says were all baptized into one body amen so the faithful are in Christ Jesus is that right so much so that the next verse I'm sorry verse 4 according as he has chosen us in him so verse 1 says the faithful are in Christ and then verse 4 says how you were in Christ you were chosen in his mind amen and because as we said on Sunday because he foreknew you would love him he chose you there he knew you there you were in him already but then you had to be manifest in a flesh body and then you had to say yes Lord since I was in you come live in me praise God amen it's you in Christ and it's Christ in you praise God amen it's both Christ is in me and I'm in Christ hallelujah that's exactly right because remember the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory but you know it's more mysterious to us is how we were in him that's more mysterious it's wonderful to see Christ in us and Christ living his life and and helping us live a life of pure from the world but it's even more mysterious to think that I was in him before the foundation of the world oh thank you Jesus glory well Ram said what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join the church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by Khoda rules but Christ the Bible he's the word that was revealed to you no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ no matter what a pastor priest whatever might be its Christ in you and that is the revelation that the church was built upon amen you like that what is the revelation what is the Holy Ghost he says the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen I says it again what is it it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed is expresses himself that was God's purpose for Jesus Christ who were express himself to take his own laws and live by his own laws Oh glory and fulfills law by death and if a man says he's born again and try to take try to place these promises of Christ in the last days to some other age making him Christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has in a delusion by Satan amen now Church we've got it we got to make sure this doesn't get to us and for example how does get to us it gets to us when we don't have faith to believe for Supernatural right like we can all pray like on Sunday we prayed for supernatural but we've really got to believe it's going to happen and that takes a revelation because mother and said you can't accept your healing until God reveals that you're healed so we've got to ask God and seek God for revelation what is your will show me your will let it be revealed to me show me perfect faith so I can have it amen that's right but RAM said it's Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual whether he don't know his ABCs praise the Lord he says the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth he says now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is I don't know if you caught that I hope you did but when the the Holy Spirit is flowing in harmony with every single person when everybody's obeying all the Word of God amen not just some people but everybody in the church everybody the bride of Jesus Christ is in a harmony with the Holy Spirit and letting God's Spirit have his way in their life he said then they're gonna get together and then the rapture is gonna go out of there yeah when we all want the same thing when Christ is all we want well we're all bang Jesus Christ then the rapture is gonna go hallelujah so may I just say Lord I will do my part until everybody else does their part now can you be patient wait to everybody else gets their part that's what we need to do and we'd have a burden to go send brother Simon or send a missionary brother cragger whoever we can send go find them go ahead and let those people find the Christ that we love let them experience Christ's love and may they give Christ preeminence when this great revelation the reveal mystery is made known to you then you denounce all the things in the world let's go to first John 3:1 that he'll keep pulling up first John 3:1 now I hope you see this here and I'm sure we can all testify to it I think maybe sister Connie or sister Beatrice maybe serve the Lord the longest here but hopefully I'll get a good hearty Amen from them in a little bit here but longer you serve Jesus Christ the more hope that you'll possess and the more you'll purify yourself the longer you serve Jesus Christ that's what the Bible says first John 3:1 what we hold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now here it is and every man that had this hope in himself purify himself even as he is pure so if you have the hope to see Jesus and have a body like his body the Bible said you'll purify yourself as we showed on Sunday of all the people that have come to our church and I preached you and I prayed for and you have prayed for and you have you've tried to help a witness to you and I cannot make them purify themselves nor can they make you purify yourself it has to be you choosing by the revelation of God to purify yourself it's an individual choice it's an individual conviction it's an individual affair how I'd like to just help how do I like just push a button and everybody in here would be in one at one corridor the Holy Spirit and everybody will do click everything I preached or everything the preach is free click everybody does it Oh that'd be glorious but that's not the way God set it up because God wanted to give everybody free moral agency God want to give everybody a chance God didn't want to force people to love him but God knows the true elect will love him and they will give him preeminence and they will get in harmony with the holy spirit you see if you have this hope that you're gonna see Jesus you'll purify yourself you won't allow yourself to get more worldly or allow yourself to get more defeated and more discouraged and more depressed or more doubtful or all these things you won't allow yourself you'll say Oh God's called me too high on that forgive me Lord purify my heart I'm coming back bring me back to my first love a man from Africa texted me yesterday or was it Monday and he said how do you keep your first love brother Jes I said well you gotta Jesus said you got to go back to your first works he said I used to be so on fire for the message I lost it I said then you've got to put God first you're doing something now that you used to not do and I said for me it was getting up early I've got to get up earlier to make sure I spend more time with God so I can read and study and pray and I said that's how I got my first love back and he said praise the Lord hallelujah god bless you Pastor he said see just he just he was at first so kind of like a young Christian and now he's starting to feel that love fall away and so God if that's God and say Lord reveal to me how I got to get my first love back yes see hope produces purity now where does Hope come from go back to Roman's 5 here's where hope comes from Romans 5 verse 1 so if you have real hope you purify your own self now the preaching of the pastor the preaching of the advantages will help ya but it's really it's you choosing to believe that preaching and then you purify yourself verse 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace we're and we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us again so we just read that if you have hope you'll purify yourself well with this hope come from it comes from tribulation and then patience and then you can experience and then you get home and then you can purify yourself amen hallelujah so we should go back and say thank God for tribulations because this trial is going to produce eventually after time it's going to produce Hulk and then it's going to produce me purifying myself not getting more worldly not flirting with the world but getting more pure getting more sincere and if that's the case the longer you serve God the more hope you should have and the more purity you should have well glory I don't know yeah because you've gone through more trials you've got you have more experience more patience yeah at least you ought to right then you should have real hope then she have more of a purity with Christ praise God now program tells us the message will be mocked and scorned he said Jesus was called Beelzebub Paul said heresy part but Griffith told Paul you're in heresy and he said the way you call heresy is the way I worship the God of my father's so brother Adam tells us the message will always be scorned mocked it'll always be called heresy did you know when I was in the denomination and I first came in the message my turn interion friends gave me some reading they gave me a chapter on the journeys and this pastor said you read this and you understand the Trinity well I read it he's like 20 pages at the end of the chapter it literally says and I can show it to you next Sunday if you won it literally says it finishes like this some something along these lines since the doctrine of the Trinity cannot be proven by scripture alone we have to just accept it and then it quotes at a church father who said try to understand it you'll lose your mind try to deny it you'll lose your soul so when I'm thinking this is what the guy told me this is gonna be proof for the Trinity the proof is fear scare tactic if you don't follow along with our with our denomination with our belief you're gonna lose your soul if you go against the Trinity you're gonna lose your soul even though there's no specific scripture for it you're gonna go to hell if you don't receive it does that sound like God's loving spirit or does that sound like the devil oh and I knew I said my how could God use fear and no scriptural backing to try to get me saved and I said the opposite must be true those who don't add to the Word of God those who just believe the Word of God about God have the revelation of God and God will save them amen it's the action the opposite you lose your soul if you add to the Word of God and you don't repent but how I've been mocked how I've been how I've been forsaken I can say that for sure I've been forsaken by all my friends before head but like Jesus said now I got a hundred times more friends that's exactly right I know I could go to at this time I could go to Napoleon I could go to Lima I could go to album Pennsylvania any church that I preached for I go to North Carolina any church I'd preach more if I said can my family of nine stay at your house just for one night I know I know they'd say yes that's what Jesus said those who forsake the wave will have a hundredfold in this life and in the life to come hey man how do you know because every time you know every time I have a baby somebody will send me a gift like the Albion church sent us a big huge gift after we had that seventh baby I don't ever even see them anymore but because of their love they just send blessings you see Jesus is not lying if we forsake everything God will give us a hundred times more amen hallelujah that's exactly right so let them call me a heretic let them call me a cult member let them call me a fanatic one thing's for sure I am a fanatic for Jesus Christ in this Bible and I'm not an occult I'm in the Church of the Living God amen hallelujah that's exactly right but RAM said it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you that he has the preeminence that he might express his words and anything that he's promised in these last days he can bring it to pass through his body as he's working it's just exactly the Word of God made manifest we had a guest speaker at our school come in on Tuesday morning we had a meeting before school at 8:10 a.m. and she was talking about diversity she's like you don't have to agree with everybody but you got to be respectful and I'm like yeah that's true and the example she leaves she said she said obviously she's a nice black woman real sweet woman she said she said I'm black I go to church and she said I never wear slacks and all the women are like and I'm like and she said yeah I'm that you'll never see me in pants she said just my conviction to wear pants I'm started to wear skirts sorry not to wear pants and then she said like me she said I don't ever put up a Christmas tree no everybody's like and I'm like whoo and she said I don't even celebrate Halloween I'm like what what's going on here so afterwards I walk up I said I want to thank you her name was was her name now I can't remember I have to look it up it's AMA that was texting her and I said I just want to thank you for sharing that I said that's exactly how I feel I said my wife and daughters never wear pants and she said what she said are you a Christian she said what are you I said I don't take any name I said as I literally said this I said I'm a Christian baptized with the Holy Ghost and she said glory to God right there in the flybridge on Tuesday ha ha ha and she said I've got to come to your church she said I said all right let's see if she comes they all tell me that you know only a few who come like that Donnie girl last year came that was nice to her Danny girl that black girl came last year that was really sweet of her we had that in common - that is a different woman but see she recognized that and she saw that truth there and so she's letting you know in her life she's letting Christ have preeminence in her life and I I feel like this church that's gotta God brings people into your life God brings people into my life to let them know that there's truth out there and if they're really hungry and I gave her my ID text her our church website and everything like that I said they're really hungry and they really can sense the presence of God then they'll grab ahold of the hook praise God but if they're not ordained of God then that they'll just recognize that but see God places these peoples in our lives that's the same thing that happened like with vane you know how Bank came in the message I was sitting at a computer in a University of Akron computer lab and here was not banging but it was his friend Devon and I'm doing clip R I'm copying and pasting clipart about the cross and I'm making a Bible said I should have been studying but I said I was studying the Word of God and I put all these clip parts of Jesus Christ I'm doing a Bible study on the Godhead and the divine looks over he looks at me he kind of gets in my personal space I don't even know him from Adam you know he says hey cool what are you doing over there you got you you serve Jesus I'm like yeah you want to come to a Bible study if you're heard about the water bats and he's like yeah I like to come to Bible study so he comes he got baptized he invited vague hey he's like man you got to come this Bible study he got baptized and so all these people started getting baptized were slowly one by one they started falling away but the elect of God caught it God had a way to get them there and God had something to hold them there that's the anchor of his word amen so same thing with this woman this woman's already heard more about God with the the Halloween the Christmas trees and the the Holy Ghost and the the the clothing she said why do your women why do you do the clothing I said because at deuteronomy 22:5 she said would she's already heard more about the message than d'von heard all's Devon heard was water baptism and he went to come SOC Church it comes out to God's predestination she's already heard more than what Devon heard and that brought in bang and members of his family into the church God wanted to save them God wanted to pull those rainbow trout out of the Akron rivers and God did it and so he must keep fishing we must keep sharing the gospel and all that the father has given me will come but we've got to open up our mouths you know I was having a mind battle should I go talk to the woman I almost walked out and I said no I better go talk to her because this is gonna be the last time I was gonna see her I knew it was the last time I saw at least better let her know and know I mean everybody was tired it was Tuesday we just got off Thanksgiving break nobody was interacting with her talk at all you know I'm like well I guess I'm better and something just moved me to do that hopefully she'll come maybe Sunday we'll see I'll send another Texas see if she'll come if not that's okay because I've already shared more with her than what I've even shared with Devon and bang at the beginning and so see God wants us to hold that message out there and not back away and not be scared to share it and not call ourselves a denomination but call ourselves Holy Ghost filled Christians see because Christ has the preeminence now let me close with this here give me about 15-20 minutes here close of this thought let me make sure I got a right thing here okay no you remember the threefold mystery but have said the whole plan of God is a three-fold mystery the first God wanted to express himself as a son and have preeminence and his son that parts completed part one is done we're on part two part two is God wants to get preeminence in his bride the bride for his son Jesus the third part is that Jesus and his bride back to the Garden of Eden we'd say the Millennium or the New Jerusalem so here's our brother branham ends the Sermon on the crisis the mystery of God revealed he said this is God's great mystery of love expressed that God and man became one see the whole thing is God and man one God and man was one there and God and man is one here what is it being filled with his spirit him having the preeminence --is that was God's achievement that's God's purpose to do that that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together one the Holy Spirit same thing it reviewed at the Christ reveals it here the supernatural created power oh thank you Lord but may have said it is not a group although we want everyone in this church to be safe filled with the Holy Ghost it may be but brother have said it's not a group it's a personal vindication of the of a pregnant out of God feel what the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else I don't envy my wife when I see you're pregnant I don't really envy her it's got to be very uncomfortable it looks extremely uncomfortable but spiritually that's what you and I are we are spiritually pregnant Christians how many can say amen to that you have received if you're born to give you've received the life of God and the life of God is growing in you Amen I don't know yet and it's slowly over time it's slowly pushing out and you're changing all the time amen and if I'm if I'm wrong correct me off my wife my wife half the card I think there's three trimesters is that right is that right three trimesters in pregnancy I think so I could be wrong Sarah okay thank you in that striking you got to go through three trimesters until you get the birth justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen God's life God's Spirit is working in you changing you it's growing the Bible says growing Grace and the knowledge of the Lord you're growing and it's all pointing to something it's like this unknown day an hour of of a birth life is going to come you don't know you can't make it come there's all these ideas how you can make it come that's like people today well I gotta be at the altar or I gotta be crying or if I'm not speaking in tongues I didn't get it or if I'm not shouting if I'm not dancing I didn't get it they've got all these different ideas and they've got to just forget about that and just say I'm just gonna wait and in God's time God will do it I'll be born again I don't know when there's a life because I know what it's like not to have a life there I'll recognize new life amen identity huh we don't tell God how it's done we don't tell where God is done we just say God do it in my life bring forth this life in me let me produce new life hey man Laurie Levin says you're pregnant out of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else it's the Holy Spirit living his life pulsating through him showing the personal vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world he goes back to this pregnant for this pregnant thought he said the pregnant person with the seed of God the word in their manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifests itself in this person the prisoner to an individual a man you and I are to manifest the word and the word alone how many like these quotes from mother brand I don't know his briefs like this but I think I think you like it I love it I love how he puts it you know the prophet of God because it all lines up with the Bible but Ram said now my church he says know your church as my church or denomination has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person now listen he says is all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth amen I didn't know yeah tonight Church it's hard to believe but all of hell is against you receiving more revelation of Christ amen in other words Satan is going to do everything you can do to try to persuade you not to hear from God not to receive from God but you've got to deny that you've got the you got to put aside that unbelief or the tiredness or fear or or or revenge or whatever's on your harder or greed or whatever it is you've got to push beyond that and say God forgive me of that help me to get this out of my mind and help me to hear from heaven tonight amen it has to be that way go to 2nd Timothy I just got a scripture on my heart he said all hell is against this truth look at 12 I'm sorry Timothy 3:12 I didn't tell you the chapter second Timothy 3:12 yay all that live godly in christ shall enjoy all the blessings of earth all the blessings of a rich life suffer persecution all that live godly life shall suffer person have you ever been persecuted by their family I've been persecuted by their work friends you suffer persecution it's happened to me verse 13 but here it is this is my program can say all hell is against this teaching but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived to see there it is right there are we gonna have less deceivers or more deceivers more well that proves it right there all hell is against this truth because there gonna be more people that are more deceptive to make it sound like the messenger make it sound like it's good but it's actually a lie evil seducers wax worse and worse praise God go to Matthew 24 Matthew 24 all hell is against the message now we know Matthew 24 24 hopefully you got it memorized in your heart I went I've been listening to Christ the mystery and also anoint when's the end times such powerful messages verse 24 for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect amen now there's another I want to look for real quick there it is go down to verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end shall be saved what is Satan trying to do today tonight what is Satan trying to do all hell is trying to get you to stop loving God he wants to he wants to kind of decrease your love valve right God's trying to get your love valve all the way open so your love for God can just flow out but Satan's trying to turn down your love valve decrease love praise the Lord Church when you can find somebody who really loves you despite if they if they make a mistake maybe yet you still love them now you found a real Christian right there someone that can really love you because all hell is gonna try to take all your love away for other people are you with me all hell's against the message it's trying to take away your love for God and your love for other people amen and then it's gonna try it now it's going to always do that it's always gonna give you a perverted love where you'll now love other things more than God and more than God's people and more than the word you'll fall in love with a presence on social media you'll fall in love with movies you'll fall in love with movie stars fall in love with someone other than your husband or wife right that's what Satan is trying to do we must look and see what do we love because all of Hell is against the message of the hour didn't Jesus say though revelation shall overcome all the gates of hell the gates of hell what the gates of hell that the gates of hell are the strongest demonic powers right because the judges sat in the gates in the Bible so the Bible says the gates of Hell will not prevail against you the very strongest of demons amen are you a theater ticket the very strongest of demons will try to come against you but if you've got the revelation of who Jesus really is he is the Messiah he is God's promised one he is the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of my peace amen he's the one that gives me my peace amen he's the Prince of my peace when you have the revelation of who Jesus Christ really is then the strongest demons cannot overcome you a name I don't care what temptation they put in front of you on your phone or on this computer screen or writing your president kaler web temptation they will not overcome you because you know that not only do you know Christ but Christ is and you praise God amen so how you going to compromise on Christ when Christ is inside of you you can't amen hallelujah all hell's against his teaching I didn't even put this on a quote and hang it up in my house or something like that because when I get down I got to remember the reason this is so hard is because all hell is fighting me I've got a bigger battle than the the Baptists and Presbyterians I've got a bigger battle than the Catholics course they're all full of a cage of unclean and hateful bird they're the ones battling us I've got to remember the reason this is so hard is because all of the hell is against me but I must remember that because Christ is in me I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus and actually go from tribulation to patients to experience to hope and that sure make me purify myself and get ready for Jesus's appearing amen because he's revealed himself to me he's husband he's my lord he's my god he's my Savior and I'm preparing myself because I'm gonna live eternally with him hallelujah amen thank you Jesus [Music] but man says see flesh and blood never really revealed to Peter but upon this revelation the called out group I'll build my church in the hem oh thank you Lord and all the gates of Hell will never be able to withstand it all the council that word gate means councils all the councils of all those demon powers that spiritual wickedness in high places think about a church those demons that are holding back your prayers right demons were holding back Daniels prayers until Michael Cain and then hold that demon off so then the other word could come down and deliver the answer to his prayers amen even though those demons up there you've still got confidence you know you're fighting spiritual things you know you have some prayer you felt like God heard you you felt like you had a revelation that God was going to do something or or help you in some way you don't give up because you know you had an experience with God God revealed it to you and you're just waiting for the time when the gates of hell's come crashing down oh yeah that's what I'm just waiting for see my loved ones safe to see this church have a real book of Acts and experience with more people so we can see more of God in our myths and we can be the fulfillment of the latter rain ha ha I enjoy what we have now but I'm looking for more in the latter rain praise God and I pray and I've cried out to God I've confessed that I've cried I've wept I've asked God for all that and I'm just waiting until it's the time for God to do it and while I'm waiting I'm not going to give up because I know there's battles going on up there but greater is He that's in me than he that's in the world amen I'm building my church in them the church is being built in you tonight can you say amen to that I am the church that's the brother James browning told me before we started the church I said what what advice do you give me before I start the church he said you are the church he said you can't expect anyone else to do anything you know they will God's with them but you said you've got to be the church so I found that to be true I am the church and it's a revelation to me no one's got to beg me to come to church and some lead and preach or pray no one's got to beg that to me because it's a revelation it's what God called me to do amen that's what we were praying for our sister you know on Sunday and I'm sure we all desire prayer for that we all desire revelation we all want to know what God has called us to do and then we can do it but we need to know what he's called us to do and once it's clear then there's no more doubts amen hallelujah then there's no more uncertain sounds there there's no more wondering about it God once we're convinced then we're concerned about it amen hallelujah I'm convinced God's called me to Akron that's why I'm concerned about every service amen I hope you are too once you're convinced it's God's revelation then you're concerned about it then you want to do something about every time the Saints gather and every day you want to pray for the different Saints in the church you want to have a desire you want to see God in our myths you want to see more of Jesus Christ amen because the church is in you amen let me close with this verb and says not one hair of your heads or Paris Jesus says you are mine I'll raise you up in the last day I'll give you eternal life and raise them up at the last day there it is the revelation not them but him an individual not a group and individual an individual all hell is against it but it's mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one that could see it hey man let's stand to our feet here let me just try to finish up here I'm read this quote one more time the whole thing is God and man 1 the whole point of this sermon for our sermon from brother branham a member of church remember the first sermon I preached is brother Branham said this sermon will tell you why I've done everything I've done in the tabernacle for all these 33 years this sermon tells us so everything brother man did the tabernacle was to try to make God in man 1 not separate now I'll do this and God you can do that but for a man to do exactly what God wanted him to do the whole purpose is God and man becoming one so we can do what God wants us to do I'm gonna read this again what is it being filled with the spirit him having the preeminence that was God's achievement that's God's purpose to do that that he might be in Christ in Christ in us and all of us together 1 now no wonder Church what does the word preeminence mean it means the first place if you look it up in the Hebrew I'm sorry the Greek first place all's God wants to achieve tonight until the rapture is first place in your life that's why I got up at 4:45 this morning I got a busy day I've got to give him first place if I sleep in I'm not gonna have time to get in first place I'm brushing my teeth and eating my breakfast is gonna be first place I've got to put him first place above everything else and that's my way for me to get back to my first love it's the sacrifice of my energy my time and I got to put in purse God has to have preeminence in our hearts and lives now how you come to the pulpit seeking first the kingdom of God Jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you I don't believe that now how many 1 a revelation of how to do that I do I want to continue revelation Lord how can I continually seek you first and keep you first I don't like Jesus said there let's read that real quick lives Matthew chapter 5 or 6 6 yeah look at 6:31 therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat see we worry about what are we gonna eat today and we and sisters you know you have to make supper bless your hearts [Music] what shall we drink where shall we be clothed got all these Naturals and their concerns for all these things do the Gentiles seek after for your heavenly Father knoweth you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you aren't you glad you're seeking in verse tonight you could have been at home cleaning which probably didn't one do that but maybe you feel some pressure to do that you could have been relaxing to sleep and get a little more rest there's a lot of things you could have been doing but you put God first tonight to hear the word of God are you glad you did that I'm so thankful I could do it let me just read this quote brother church I forgot to read read this this is thirsting for life 1960 brother man who's talking about people who try to satisfy the longing of God with something else because they longed for God they try to fill it they try do something else to make themselves feel like they've done good roben says just think friends see that thirsting in you have you given over to the enemy to the things of the world have you just tried to satisfy that say well I'll go downtown and buy new clothes and that fits perfectly with the scripture but I'm talking about people who just go buy new clothes he says that isn't it you maybe you need new clothes that's legitimate but when you just make that your idol of how you just must be so and span all the time you heard that but maybe it's your home maybe it's something else that's taking the place of that first thing that thirst and calling it ought to be God God is that satisfying portion over have said many people try to everything and span [Music] program said it becomes an idol everything's got to be perfect their lives have to so look perfect and Church all's that is if we're not careful that's just a Pharisee spirit I'm not saying live loose or live dirty or anything like that but if we're not careful just looking and span trying to be perfect with brand-new clothes and look nice all the time hairs all combed and all gelled up and if that takes more preeminence if that's more important than reading our Bible pray worshiping God really hungry after God that we missed it we missed it that comedian Idol brother Ram says making sure everything's so and span you know I talked to a friend one time and he said he spent two or three hours just trying on different clothes to make sure everything was perfect before he stepped out the door there's what was that that was a lot of pride and ego and also fear the person confessed me they had like a complex they were fearful if they stepped outside in public and they didn't look perfect spickens bed and nice and fashions and match you know contrasting colors on all complimentary colors they would almost go crazy they would shake it and threw my back in the house I just think if we thought about that with our spiritual garments we really washed our robes and made them white in the blood of that's the kindest nickens man we need ain't a head this could be an idols well Jesus says why do we worry about food and drink and clothes all these things God will provide he said he's a father but seek first the kingdom of God and Rodan said this is the whole point of God's whole plan is have preeminence 1st place in your life and anyone who falls away for the message it's because the word was not first a lot of people are now are falling away because brother Brad was first and not God they're following the way they always put brother branham first like every word he said is thusly the Lord they find out he's a man he makes mistakes so they lose confidence then they attack him and they make him all kinds of they make him things that he's not even Church Christ Jesus has to be number one in our lives and that's for everything with your finances with your relationships he's gotta be number one there he's my number one with with everything with this service he's got to be 1st place he has to be the very first most important thing about this is Christ Jesus the word and when everybody gets in harmony Christ really has number one and everybody's hard life that was you know a train wreck sure hallelujah thank the Lord thank the Lord that's all he wants the whole thing is God and man 1 so I've given you a brief review of Christ the mystery of God revealed have you enjoyed it he focuses on revelation being born again and predestination this is all God's very plan and you can have 1st place in your life let's just bow our heads there's anything in your life that you're not giving God first place why don't you just confess and say Father forgive me I want to put you first maybe my free time I want to put your first in my relationship with my friends I want to put you first at work I'm not praying over myself or your for your help it on my job I'm not putting you first in my finances not putting you first in my personal study devotion time I'm not putting you first in my conversations I'm I'm saying things I wouldn't say if I knew you were there god help those individuals Lord see our hands raised here God we want you to be first place this is the whole purpose of God is to have preeminence as Colossians 1:18 said in all things Lord may you teach us may we continue to grow as pregnant Christians may we continue to grow so you have more and more preeminence in our lives granted your juices Lord we talked about the birth as a type of the Holy Ghost but

with the Holy Spirit Oh hallelujah I love how God has hidden simplicity don't you it could be some some deep mysterious thing but it boils down to who's first think about that church the foolish virgin had Jesus second the wise version had him first because they got born again ha ha ha and then I knew yeah they were still virgin the foolish version but Christ wasn't number 1 we're more than anything else I've got to make sure I'm born to get that's why he called him foolish there was something just a little more important and so Christ instead of number 1 Christ became second and the
