[21:51] way better than me amen praise god
[21:53] let's get your bibles here let's uh turn
[21:56] to the word of god
[21:57] i started first thessalonians chapter
[22:00] five
[22:03] i'm going to take a little break from
[22:04] the series i just kind of wanted to
[22:08] look at this thought i've been going
[22:09] through some of my notes or as i was
[22:10] preparing i
[22:12] i wanted i realized i wanted to preach
[22:14] on that
[22:16] uh situation a few
[22:18] months ago where i was trying to correct
[22:20] a brother that had 24 false statements
[22:23] in a sermon
[22:24] and i just went through real quickly i
[22:26] didn't preach it but i'd like you to
[22:27] hear it and i like to preach on that
[22:30] and i have some things to share at the
[22:31] end that i'll stop the livestream that
[22:33] kind of connects to that
[22:35] so
[22:37] lord winning i'll try to be mindful of
[22:38] the time here
[22:41] got a lot of ground to cover
[22:43] but i'm glad to be on the lord's side
[22:45] praise god i'm glad i'm on jesus's
[22:47] ground amen we've got a lot of ground to
[22:49] cover but we can make it by god's grace
[22:51] and i'll just let austin and lena know
[22:52] this is more kind of a deeper subject
[22:54] you know
[22:55] uh the last few weeks i've been
[22:56] preaching very
[22:58] more simple subjects you know like the
[23:00] cities of refuge and
[23:02] some of those other thoughts the lord is
[23:04] my portion last wednesday you know very
[23:06] very simple things but very needful we
[23:08] need to hear those praise god and i
[23:10] think it was evidence because we had
[23:11] numerous people come up for prayer that
[23:13] we need to hear those from time to time
[23:15] now today's gonna be a little deeper you
[23:17] know it's gonna be uh i'm not sure all
[23:18] these things will be familiar to you
[23:20] brother but it'd be good to hear and
[23:22] it'll help you i'm sure it'll help you
[23:23] on your walk with the lord you too lena
[23:25] i'm sure it'll help you by god's grace
[23:28] so uh let's go to first thessalonians 5
[23:34] 21. i told some brothers outside of our
[23:37] church preachers that i was going to
[23:39] preach on this tonight if they'd like to
[23:41] listen to it later
[23:43] to kind of understand
[23:45] the reasons why i think this is such an
[23:47] important
[23:48] sermon to preach i guess i'll just put
[23:50] it like that
[23:52] i never would want to attack somebody
[23:54] but the same time i felt like this
[23:55] sermon that i listened to i felt like it
[23:57] was a subtle attack upon the fivefold
[23:59] ministry
[24:01] and so i make sure i want to preach this
[24:03] so that it's fresh on my mind
[24:05] and that i can share it perhaps i'll
[24:06] share it with the brother as well i
[24:08] wrote him an 18-page letter
[24:11] two-sided single-spaced
[24:13] that's a lot of let that's a lot of
[24:15] writing there so
[24:17] trying to help the brother and uh by
[24:18] god's grace he didn't want my help and
[24:20] that's okay but maybe a sermon will help
[24:23] him as well i want to try all those
[24:25] means
[24:25] and it kind of connects to what i want
[24:27] to say at the end for our home church
[24:28] you know so i don't want to say say it
[24:30] right now but after we close the live
[24:33] stream i'll share that
[24:36] first thessalonians 5 21.
[24:38] let's all read this if we can
[24:41] let's read this on three one two three
[24:43] prove all things hold fast that which is
[24:47] good now just for the sake of you know
[24:49] austin alina let's read the next verse
[24:51] 22. let's read this one
[24:52] one two three abstain from all
[24:55] appearance of evil so paul says when
[24:58] you're trying to be a christian and uh
[25:00] you know
[25:01] serving god try to abstain from all
[25:03] appearances of evil even if it looks
[25:05] evil even if there's like a shred of it
[25:07] try to stay away from it that's going to
[25:09] help you walk in the holy spirit's
[25:10] anointing
[25:11] if you try to avoid all appearance of
[25:13] evil but notice that first statement
[25:15] prove all things
[25:17] see we have to prove and make sure
[25:19] what we hear is the truth okay now
[25:22] here's how you do it acts 17 11. go
[25:24] there if you've got your bible acts 17
[25:26] 11. here's how you do it
[25:31] acts 17 11.
[25:36] so these are the bereans which paul
[25:40] was a missionary towards they heard paul
[25:42] preach
[25:44] and after hearing paul preach they
[25:45] didn't say well i believe everything he
[25:46] said that's not what they did
[25:48] they saw the miracles they saw the
[25:50] teaching but then the bible said they
[25:51] spent all their time
[25:53] searching the scriptures to make sure
[25:54] what paul said was the truth
[25:57] remember they didn't have new testament
[25:58] letters they had old testament letters
[26:00] so paul was dealing with the old
[26:02] testament showing how there was
[26:03] prophecies about jesus christ okay and
[26:06] they had to go back and make sure this
[26:08] man was saying the right thing that's
[26:09] what i want you to do tonight don't take
[26:11] my word for it take the bible's word for
[26:13] it i'll fail i'm not perfect i believe
[26:15] i'm a true servant of god but i make
[26:17] mistakes everybody makes mistakes only
[26:19] christ is the one who makes no mistakes
[26:22] but this here's the lesson we get we got
[26:23] to take everything back to the word so
[26:25] let's read this on three one two three
[26:28] these were more noble than those in
[26:30] thessalonica in that they received the
[26:33] word with all readiness of mind and
[26:35] search the scriptures daily whether
[26:38] those things were so so every day you
[26:40] need to have a meeting with the lord and
[26:42] say holy spirit show me if the things
[26:45] that i've heard are right or not
[26:47] amen that's about heads for word of
[26:48] prayer can we let me just say a prayer
[26:50] for you and myself
[26:51] heavenly father god we're here again
[26:53] lord i've been coming to church now here
[26:55] lord this bride of christ fellowship for
[26:57] over 15 years i've loved every service
[26:59] i've been so thankful to be a part of it
[27:01] we're thankful tonight lord for another
[27:03] opportunity to be in your house i pray
[27:04] you'd anoint me lord to preach this and
[27:06] lord be able to prove all things lord
[27:08] god and father lord to search the
[27:10] scriptures whether these things be so so
[27:12] i pray you'd help me and help the people
[27:14] lord god and i just pray this would be a
[27:16] help to our brother lord and all the
[27:18] brothers lord that i've been talking
[27:20] with these last few days here on the
[27:21] text messages and emails and things that
[27:23] it could be a help to the saints of god
[27:26] lord god as we as we endure to labor in
[27:29] the doctrine lord god that you might be
[27:31] honored lord god that your word might be
[27:33] lord magnify dear jesus so we give you
[27:36] thanks and praise in jesus christ's name
[27:38] and the saint said
[27:39] amen god bless you for being seated
[27:41] praise god i'm going to set a timer i'll
[27:42] try to go uh a hour here
[27:47] and hopefully that'll be okay
[27:49] for tonight i got a lot of distance to
[27:51] cover so i got you go ahead switch over
[27:53] this is i'm just going to call this
[27:54] prove all things part 17
[27:57] here tonight
[28:00] and we'll look to the lord for his grace
[28:02] and strength here
[28:04] yeah i'm going to turn that
[28:06] okay so
[28:07] uh you know i preached 16 services on
[28:10] prove all things on this idea
[28:13] and uh i was dealing a lot with how
[28:16] william branham was a prophet but yet he
[28:18] was also a man too
[28:20] right and we have to rightly divide the
[28:22] tapes of brother branham right and this
[28:24] is different than any other day because
[28:25] there was no tape recordings in the day
[28:27] of martin luther there was no tape
[28:29] recorders in the days of paul
[28:32] or moses
[28:33] or uh some of these hot-tempered
[28:35] preachers
[28:36] right or hot-tempered women that they
[28:38] married
[28:39] right there's no tape recorder so we
[28:40] don't know everything that went on we're
[28:42] just we're told what's in the bible
[28:45] okay you having trouble honey getting to
[28:46] that is it not coming up
[28:48] i changed the adapters i changed to this
[28:49] one here oh maybe it fell out let me try
[28:52] that again
[28:53] it might have fallen out
[28:56] so i just wanted to be able to show some
[28:57] of these okay there we go thank you yeah
[28:58] that's my fault again it's my fault see
[29:00] it's always my fault see
[29:02] see forgive me it's always my thought
[29:04] that's true
[29:05] so help me jesus okay so we read our
[29:07] scriptures here now remember church i
[29:09] just want to give a visual we are trying
[29:11] to stand in the middle of the road
[29:13] right there's there's one road to heaven
[29:15] jesus said there's one road to heaven
[29:17] we're trying to stay in the road in the
[29:18] middle of the road right
[29:20] and when we stay in the middle of the
[29:21] road we're walking in truth and we're
[29:23] walking in love
[29:24] but satan's trying to push us off
[29:27] uh to leave the message or leave the
[29:29] bible teachings that god gave to brother
[29:31] branham and he's trying to uh and this
[29:33] side is known for their laschiviousness
[29:35] which means lawlessness
[29:38] right so people that leave the message
[29:39] they say oh you don't need to dress holy
[29:42] you don't need to live holy you can
[29:43] watch whatever you want you can cuss you
[29:44] can do whatever you want you know it's
[29:45] no problem
[29:47] god loves you i mean how can you make
[29:49] god love you more and i see they got
[29:50] these sly arguments like that that's
[29:52] true god can't love you more but god is
[29:54] god's given you a higher calling
[29:57] see they got all these
[29:58] subtle lies they slip into there you
[30:00] know evil reasonings the bible said
[30:02] they're reasoning unto men instead of
[30:03] reasoning the word of god
[30:05] so satan will try to push us off to that
[30:07] side where oh god loves you you can do
[30:09] whatever you want you still go to heaven
[30:11] that's not true jesus said if you don't
[30:13] repent and overcome he said i'll blot
[30:14] your name out of the book of life
[30:16] he said because you love darkness more
[30:18] than you love light we want to be light
[30:20] lovers tonight amen
[30:22] now the other side is the side that
[30:25] worships it goes into legalism and they
[30:26] basically worship brother branham they
[30:28] basically brother branham above the
[30:30] bible that's wickedness that's sin right
[30:33] but it's legalism because they say every
[30:35] word god's prophet said you have to make
[30:38] thus saith the lord
[30:40] right and i just so you know i did email
[30:42] our precious brother in jeffersonville
[30:43] today showing him three of his faults i
[30:46] don't know if i'll hear back
[30:48] but i emailed him today i don't know if
[30:49] we'll see i said please contact me back
[30:51] if you want to and i said i got all the
[30:53] quotes to back it up
[30:54] i do it in love church
[30:56] because if i i see that man and he has
[30:58] such a influence and if he won't repent
[31:00] i don't know what's going to happen so i
[31:02] do it because brother brandon says you
[31:03] correct people because you love them
[31:06] right you have to correct people because
[31:07] you love them
[31:09] so um
[31:11] so we have we have we have these
[31:12] examples people that leave the message i
[31:14] call them brother rams accusers you know
[31:15] they're on that side of lecheviousness
[31:17] they leave the truth then you have the
[31:18] side of legalists you know that exalt
[31:21] brother branham
[31:22] okay now we got to be careful uh
[31:26] because uh
[31:27] there's so many deceptions and the
[31:29] deceptions come by preachers many times
[31:32] because honest people want to they know
[31:34] that god always sends preachers
[31:36] they know that god's way is for a fifo
[31:38] ministry out of the bible and they know
[31:40] god never changes that because the bible
[31:43] said
[31:44] they're going to preach until we're all
[31:45] in the unity of the faith
[31:48] praise god i know it seems like there's
[31:50] less and less unity but that's true
[31:52] because those are the ones that are not
[31:53] born again but amongst those people that
[31:55] are born again there's more unity praise
[31:57] god amen
[31:59] it's true
[32:01] now here's the warning the bible said
[32:02] till we all all all the believers come
[32:05] in the unity of the faith and the
[32:06] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[32:08] perfect or complete man that doesn't
[32:09] mean something that never sins it means
[32:11] something that's completely
[32:13] become all that god wants them to come
[32:15] see unto the measure of the stature or
[32:18] the maturity of fullness of christ
[32:21] in other words god wants you to reach
[32:23] the highest levels as a christian you
[32:25] can reach
[32:26] he wants you to be as much like jesus as
[32:28] you can possibly be
[32:30] you might be a a hundredfold you might
[32:32] have a hundred a hundredfold increase in
[32:34] your life you might bring forth lots of
[32:36] fruit that might be your cap and thank
[32:38] god that's that's the highest cap there
[32:39] can be
[32:40] right or you might be a 60-fold
[32:42] christian the bible says there's three
[32:43] kinds right three kinds of holy
[32:45] ghost-filled christians you bring a
[32:46] hundred-fold you're 60-fold or
[32:48] thirty-fold but this is saying god wants
[32:51] you to come to your fullness of your
[32:53] productivity as a christian or the
[32:56] fullness of your fruitfulness how many
[32:57] want to reach it praise god
[32:59] i don't want to fall short i don't want
[33:00] to have wasted seed you know i don't
[33:02] have a wasted life i don't want to lose
[33:04] my reward i want to bring forth
[33:06] abundantly unto jesus
[33:09] if not look if not we henceforth be no
[33:13] more children
[33:14] you see if we don't reach our maturity
[33:16] we're then we're not born again right
[33:18] and we're just children tossed back and
[33:20] forth and carried about with every wind
[33:23] of doctrine
[33:24] so i don't have the fan out here but if
[33:25] i had the fan on i could throw a i could
[33:27] throw a paper up in front of there and
[33:28] blow the paper all around
[33:30] that's not the kind of life we want to
[33:32] live
[33:33] where any little thing we hear blows us
[33:35] out of control right
[33:37] right that preacher said that ah now
[33:39] what am i going to do and then the next
[33:40] preacher says that oh what about
[33:42] we don't want to be tossed around like a
[33:44] bunch of babies amen
[33:46] we want to be solid praise god the bible
[33:48] says the fivefold ministry makes you
[33:50] solid amen you're not tossed around and
[33:53] you're not
[33:54] easily disturbed amen praise god you
[33:56] know where you stand praise god you're
[33:58] not blown by all these false doctrines
[34:00] and winds but you stand on the rock of
[34:02] ages amen
[34:06] see by the every wind of doctrine
[34:08] by the slight of man that's the gambling
[34:10] of men they're trying to gamble to see
[34:11] what will get them the most clicks or
[34:13] the most views
[34:15] right
[34:15] or the most offerings what will give me
[34:17] the most money the most popularity and
[34:20] they'll say anything to be more popular
[34:22] or get more money
[34:24] and cutting craftiness they lie in wait
[34:26] to deceive their whole thing is to
[34:27] deceive because their god is their belly
[34:30] so they can have more prosperity
[34:32] naturally
[34:34] but the bible says we speak the truth in
[34:36] love
[34:37] and grow up into christ in all things in
[34:41] other words our our words should become
[34:42] more like the words of christ
[34:44] our thoughts should become more like the
[34:46] thoughts of christ our actions should
[34:49] become like more like the actions of
[34:50] christ
[34:54] so you grow up into him christ even the
[34:57] head
[34:58] okay now
[34:59] the main preacher i'm focusing on
[35:01] tonight i believe his his 24 mistakes
[35:05] were seeking to deceive others into
[35:06] lasciviousness or lawlessness
[35:09] and also as i listened more and more to
[35:11] it the spirit of fear
[35:13] i felt like fear was trying to get in
[35:15] there as well which would be legalism
[35:18] so it was a strange mixture
[35:20] because on one side uh yeah he was
[35:22] saying
[35:23] you don't have to have a home church or
[35:24] a pastor well that's leschiviousness
[35:26] right that's just law that says you
[35:27] don't need to be accountable you're your
[35:29] own authority you don't have to answer
[35:31] any authority
[35:32] but on the other side putting so much
[35:34] pressure on people fear like if you're
[35:36] not if you're not producing the fullness
[35:37] of christ then you're not even saved
[35:40] i mean that's basically what he's saying
[35:42] well i can never i can never manifest
[35:45] the fullness of christ because i'm not
[35:46] christ
[35:47] i don't have the fullness of the godhead
[35:49] only jesus does amen
[35:51] but using statements like that to bring
[35:54] people to fear so it's such a strange
[35:56] sermon it just struck me now that it's
[35:58] both lawlessness and legalism in the
[36:00] same thir and same sermon
[36:03] now brother graham's accusers i call him
[36:06] the brotherhood's accusers
[36:08] also seeks to deceive people until the
[36:10] shibuousness as seen in their bondage
[36:13] they see they leave they leave our
[36:15] teachings right they leave the bible
[36:16] they leave the bible and say oh you can
[36:18] watch all the movies you want
[36:20] right you can wear sexually suggestive
[36:22] clothing
[36:23] because there's no standards of modesty
[36:25] the bible just says modesty that's a lie
[36:28] women can preach over you which is
[36:30] ultimately a man losing his position and
[36:33] giving the wrong person the position
[36:36] right a dominating female spirit
[36:39] and then denominationalism oh you can go
[36:41] to catholic luther they're all filled
[36:42] with the holy spirit all catholics are
[36:44] filled with the holy spirit basically
[36:45] what they're saying
[36:47] lie that's a lie
[36:49] but see that's lasciviousness
[36:51] lawlessness but we will not be brought
[36:53] under the power of any of that bondage
[36:56] amen
[36:57] will not be brought under fear will not
[36:59] be brought under lies will not be
[37:01] brought under lusts or greed we won't be
[37:04] brought under that we'll be only
[37:06] obedient to the power of christ
[37:11] now the other side the vog side is
[37:13] legalistic because every word is thus
[37:15] saith the lord
[37:17] and they're brought into bondage to
[37:19] every thought
[37:20] every word every personal opinion of
[37:22] brother branham and it may just be his
[37:24] opinion
[37:26] but they're enslaved to that to say i
[37:28] believe it or yeah i'm going to do that
[37:29] or i have to do just like that
[37:31] and there's no room for christian
[37:33] liberty
[37:34] right
[37:36] so remember church there's only three
[37:37] motivations for your obedience you
[37:40] either obey god because of love that's
[37:42] us
[37:43] amen
[37:45] now don't
[37:46] don't don't be confused sometimes you
[37:47] are tempted by the enemy to serve god
[37:50] out of fear right or legalism and
[37:52] sometimes you are tempted to you know
[37:54] sin and say well i don't care what god's
[37:55] word says i'll just do whatever i want
[37:57] that's a temptation but we got to
[37:59] overcome it praise god
[38:01] see
[38:02] if we either serve god by our love for
[38:04] god
[38:05] or legalism i'm scared so i got to do
[38:07] everything i got to do every single
[38:09] thing and if i don't do it i'm going to
[38:10] be lost
[38:11] or less jimmy says who cares what the
[38:13] word says god loves me i can do whatever
[38:15] i want
[38:16] we're not going to be legalism or
[38:18] lasciviousness we're going to be under
[38:20] the love of god the liberty of the
[38:22] spirit
[38:23] because jesus said if you love me keep
[38:25] my commandments amen
[38:27] how many love jesus
[38:29] well see so that's what we got to do
[38:30] when we're tempted we've got to say ah
[38:32] we got to say god forgive me my flesh
[38:34] wants to do this but i'm going to
[38:35] crucify that desire because i love jesus
[38:38] more and i'm going to obey the word of
[38:39] god
[38:40] because i know god's trying to protect
[38:42] my life
[38:43] he knows if i obey him my life will be
[38:46] the best life it can possibly be
[38:48] like our brother austin knows right he
[38:50] was he was telling me about that he said
[38:52] as soon as you leave god's word he said
[38:54] uh you have all this condemnation right
[38:56] that's it every day right
[38:59] as soon as as soon as we and it happens
[39:01] to all of us brother whether we leave
[39:02] the church or not because all of us sin
[39:05] not just you it's all of us we all sin
[39:07] we all fall short of god's glory
[39:09] and so anytime we disobey god it's a sin
[39:12] and our conscience is gonna it's
[39:14] supposed to convict us so we'll say
[39:17] sorry jesus forgive me i'm back to
[39:19] loving you and i'm gonna obey you next
[39:21] time amen praise god amen that's right
[39:24] so we want to serve god by love and it's
[39:26] a constant battle church it's a constant
[39:28] battle to stay out of the ditch how many
[39:30] understand what i'm saying the church
[39:31] said
[39:32] it's a constant battle praise god you'll
[39:34] swerve like on the road sometimes when
[39:36] i'm driving off salinas sometimes i
[39:37] swerve a little bit i gotta get back to
[39:38] the middle
[39:39] you know what i mean i just gotta i
[39:41] gotta stay in the middle of the road
[39:42] praise god it's a constant battle jesus
[39:44] said walk the narrow road he said few
[39:46] there be that don't fall in the ditch
[39:49] that's in that's in matthew chapter 7
[39:51] verse 14. jesus said few fine few can
[39:54] actually walk or ride this narrow road
[39:58] not many people can do it they either
[39:59] get into well i can sin and do whatever
[40:01] i want or i'm so scared i better do this
[40:03] and they never have the love of god in
[40:05] their hearts
[40:06] but love is what we are presenting love
[40:10] is how we're living we're going to
[40:11] battle the cheviousness we're going to
[40:12] battle legalism but ultimately love will
[40:15] prevail
[40:17] amen okay now
[40:19] let me skip back to where i was
[40:21] now remember i showed you the the side
[40:23] that left brother brandon i call him
[40:24] brother brahms accusers
[40:25] they deny
[40:27] 14 of paul's teachings i'm just going to
[40:29] go through these really quickly
[40:31] when they leave the message
[40:33] they some of them some of them not all
[40:35] of them some of them accept
[40:36] homosexuality
[40:38] some of them accept adultery
[40:40] some of them except fornication murder
[40:42] or birth control pills because those are
[40:44] murder pills
[40:46] right they'll flush out a a fertilized
[40:48] egg and people people only read the
[40:49] label that's what the label says
[40:52] my wife and i know because we were going
[40:53] to get them but then we saw that the
[40:54] holy spirit stopped us from getting them
[40:56] praise god because we just because we
[40:58] read the label so you got to read food
[40:59] labels too but you also got to read all
[41:01] the other labels
[41:02] all that read that little writing there
[41:04] because we didn't know better no one
[41:06] ever told us right so thank god the holy
[41:08] spirit's here to teach us praise god
[41:10] women preachers
[41:12] substance abuse smoking all this
[41:14] drinking and all this uh what
[41:17] was called fentanyl right do you know 30
[41:20] 000 more people have died from fentanyl
[41:22] overdoses this year than cova did you
[41:23] know that
[41:25] it's way it's a way bigger problem than
[41:28] clovid
[41:29] because kova is just a little more of an
[41:30] advanced flu
[41:31] that's all it is
[41:33] 30 000 more because they have the open
[41:35] borders right they're letting all the
[41:37] drugs come in and just kill off more and
[41:39] more americans
[41:41] it's more of a pandemic than the
[41:42] pandemic
[41:44] right
[41:46] just it's awful what these people think
[41:50] uh viewing sinful content like on your
[41:52] smartphone or netflix or whatever it is
[41:54] movie theaters that's a sin to do that
[41:58] shameful hair lengths men with uncut
[41:59] hair
[42:00] right or women with short hair
[42:02] right false conversions basically saying
[42:05] as soon as you repent you got the holy
[42:07] ghost basically saying everybody's got
[42:08] the holy ghost that's a lie
[42:11] and in modest clothing you can wear
[42:12] whatever you want jesus loves you well
[42:14] he loves you but he don't love how
[42:16] you're acting and you're tempting men
[42:17] right or men you're tempted women right
[42:19] if men dress sexy men can dress sexy too
[42:22] right
[42:23] also water baptism they change jesus's
[42:26] name or god's name
[42:28] the three works of grace they basically
[42:30] deny the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:33] uh the godhead they call god three
[42:35] persons but he's one person
[42:37] and then cross-dressing of course we
[42:39] know that we know that by history as
[42:41] well
[42:41] and then some of them deny the gifts of
[42:43] the holy ghost
[42:44] and yet they say they're free
[42:47] by denying the word of god it's
[42:49] impossible to be free when denying the
[42:51] word of god you're enslaved to these
[42:54] lies you're enslaved to these spirits
[42:55] right we saw i showed you this list of a
[42:57] month ago
[42:58] if you watch movies you're under the
[43:00] spirit of lust lust has ruled your life
[43:04] that demon of lust is ruling your life
[43:06] if you look at lustful things
[43:08] right
[43:09] uh the roman catholic church the mother
[43:11] harlot
[43:12] the antichrist spirit if you believe all
[43:15] the denominations are filled with the
[43:16] holy ghost you've accepted the
[43:17] antichrist spirit you're a slave to that
[43:20] in bondage to the antichrist spirit
[43:23] right
[43:25] if you're mocking brother branham or us
[43:27] or anybody you're under the spirit of
[43:29] mocking a prideful spirit
[43:32] right they call themselves professors
[43:34] they call themselves walking bibles
[43:36] they're under the spirit of pride and
[43:37] don't even know it
[43:40] they're under the spirit they're under a
[43:41] lying spirit when they when they when
[43:42] they say they know what brother bran was
[43:45] talking about or what uh
[43:46] they say they know all these assumptions
[43:49] they don't it's an assumption they're
[43:51] they're in bondage to a lying spirit but
[43:53] we've got the spirit of truth amen
[43:58] and all these all these other spirits i
[44:00] could go through all these i'm not going
[44:01] to go through those but all these are
[44:02] spirits of bondage and they're under
[44:05] obedience to the spirits of bondage
[44:08] now there's many disastrous effects of
[44:10] false teaching
[44:13] these two men in paul's day hymenous and
[44:16] philetus were preaching that the rapture
[44:19] had already happened and the bible said
[44:21] their word eat as a canker
[44:24] they say oh the rapture already happened
[44:25] you can just relax and and we're already
[44:27] in the millennium right basically we're
[44:28] already in the millennium there are some
[44:29] message churches that believe that very
[44:31] few but some believe that
[44:33] and the bible says that overthrows the
[44:35] faith of some
[44:38] if someone actually believes that jesus
[44:39] already raptured us and now we're just
[44:41] raptured in our souls and now as the
[44:44] millennium
[44:45] they would say well if it's the
[44:46] millennium then i can do whatever i want
[44:48] it's a thousand years of peace
[44:51] right that means that means i already
[44:52] got peace in my heart i can live however
[44:54] they want and the bible said that eats
[44:57] as a canker does
[44:59] or or it could go the other way and make
[45:01] you say jesus already raptured i miss
[45:03] the rapture i might as well i didn't
[45:05] make it jesus doesn't love me so i that
[45:07] will destroy my faith
[45:09] see how that will destroy your faith
[45:10] so either way to destroy your faith
[45:12] thinking that
[45:13] you're already in the millennium or
[45:15] jesus left you and you don't mean
[45:17] nothing to jesus so i'll just waste my
[45:19] my life away in in and i'll just drink
[45:22] my life away
[45:23] right or live my life in sin i'll live
[45:25] it up i'll paint the town red because
[45:27] jesus left me and he
[45:29] must not love me but the fact is jesus
[45:31] died for you and he does love you amen
[45:34] hallelujah and the rapture hasn't
[45:36] happened yet he's trying to get us ready
[45:38] praise god
[45:39] amen
[45:41] now that means a canker a gang green so
[45:43] false doctrine eats away like gangrene
[45:46] it just starts it eats away your body
[45:48] right it eats away your spiritual life
[45:49] slowly but surely
[45:51] false doctrines slowly make you feel
[45:54] like you're spiritually dead but when
[45:56] you've got truth if you'll receive it
[45:58] let me say it again but if you're
[45:59] hearing truth and if you'll receive it
[46:01] you'll feel alive
[46:03] that's why i felt alive all these years
[46:04] amen because we won't let false doctrine
[46:07] come in and we receive the truth praise
[46:09] god
[46:11] amen
[46:13] see it false doctrines destroy or
[46:16] overthrow that's what the word means in
[46:18] the greek it destroys people's faith
[46:21] they're not as firm they're not as
[46:23] faithful
[46:24] now i got to go faster
[46:26] the bible says now this is a little bit
[46:28] of a
[46:29] side note but the bible says
[46:32] if somebody eats meat that was
[46:34] sacrificed to an idol and a young
[46:36] christian sees it it might destroy his
[46:38] faith
[46:40] right because he thinks i can be a
[46:41] christian and i can eat food sacrificed
[46:43] to an idol so paul said don't destroy
[46:46] him with your meat for whom christ died
[46:50] in other words be careful if you're a
[46:52] mature christian be careful that you
[46:54] don't do things that cause your younger
[46:56] christian brothers sisters to stumble
[46:59] right
[47:00] so be careful how you live because
[47:02] people are watching you and you don't
[47:04] want to destroy their faith you want to
[47:05] build up their faith
[47:08] like i believe wine drinking wine is not
[47:10] a sin as long as you don't get drunk
[47:13] but the bible says the bible says never
[47:15] do it if a person's weak because they
[47:17] might see you drinking and then they'll
[47:19] go get drunk
[47:20] that's why i'll never drink alcohol in
[47:22] public never some people might but i
[47:25] won't
[47:26] because if they see a pastor doing it
[47:27] well i can do it i'll have one i feel so
[47:29] good give me another okay now i feel
[47:31] real good give me another and pretty
[47:32] soon they're drunk
[47:34] and now their faith has been destroyed
[47:37] so wisdom tells you i have the freedom
[47:39] to do it but i'm not going to do it in
[47:42] public right we'll do it at the lord's
[47:44] table praise god
[47:46] you can do it in your home if you want
[47:48] but you better be careful you don't get
[47:49] drunk in your home
[47:50] that's why i don't do it in my home
[47:52] either
[47:53] because i don't trust my flesh
[47:55] not that i don't trust my soul i trust
[47:56] my soul i don't trust my flesh
[47:59] because i'm easily i've already known
[48:01] through my sinful life i get easily
[48:03] addicted to substances
[48:05] alcohol or cigarettes or tobacco
[48:07] whatever i'm eating so i'm not even
[48:08] going to try i'm not going to let it go
[48:10] i'm not going to give it a try because i
[48:12] know better i don't want to cause my
[48:14] family to stumble i don't want to
[48:16] stumble i want to live pure for
[48:18] jesus that's just it's just a scripture
[48:21] it's romans 14 if you want to read that
[48:22] in your free time now i'm going to skip
[48:24] past that because it's a lie now let's
[48:25] get to these because i still got about
[48:27] bless you brother i see about 39 minutes
[48:29] left on this hour so that was about good
[48:31] 20 minute introduction right praise god
[48:34] pretty good now let's see nature's like
[48:36] yeah kind of
[48:37] amen thanks for honesty i appreciate
[48:39] that that's that's what we need to be
[48:40] honest
[48:42] now 24.
[48:44] can you believe that i could have found
[48:46] more in that sermon church but i just
[48:47] kind of got tired of going through it
[48:49] i was so grieved because i felt it was
[48:50] an attack on the fivefold ministry
[48:52] now uh here's number one now bear with
[48:55] me
[48:56] i'm going to try to hit the highlights i
[48:58] went through this quickly
[48:59] one time but i never really got the
[49:02] details i want to see us i want to hear
[49:04] i want you to see it the first false
[49:06] statement was taped churches are equal
[49:08] to fivefold churches because both can
[49:10] have the holy ghost i said brother you
[49:12] said they have the same holy ghost
[49:13] they're the ones that go to church god
[49:15] and god has people in both groups i said
[49:17] i believe you're wrong
[49:19] the truth is most not all of the tape
[49:22] people are not born again because
[49:23] they're breaking the word a person
[49:25] cannot be born again of the word and
[49:27] purposely deny the word
[49:30] see what word are they breaking they're
[49:32] breaking ephesians 4 8 through 16
[49:35] and if they stay home then they're
[49:36] breaking hebrews 10 24 and 25.
[49:40] and those people that are staying home
[49:42] because of coven these last two years
[49:44] they're sinning too
[49:46] i understand staying home for a little
[49:47] while but when you realize it's just a
[49:49] cold when you realize it's just a fever
[49:51] you need to get back in the house of god
[49:54] stop being afraid god's your healer
[49:56] praise god
[49:57] heals cancer hears heals tuberculosis
[50:00] praise god he can heal covet amen it's
[50:02] nothing to god just trust god amen
[50:05] the bible says gather more as you see
[50:08] that day approaching
[50:10] and remember to change one word of
[50:11] paul's revelation is to be cursed
[50:14] in galatians 1 verses 6 through 12.
[50:18] so by definition tape churches cannot be
[50:20] equal because they limit the fivefold
[50:23] preaching which takes away from paul's
[50:25] commands therefore they're cursed
[50:28] the only way you could be in a tape
[50:30] church and be born again is if you got
[50:32] born again before you started the tape
[50:33] church
[50:35] and then you you live in a place where
[50:36] there's no preachers around there
[50:38] and so you got to play tapes
[50:40] but then if i was a man i'd preach
[50:42] anyway
[50:43] right because brother says if you fall
[50:44] in love with jesus you get so burned the
[50:46] people don't have a preacher you preach
[50:48] it yourself because you want the people
[50:50] to feed on the word of life
[50:52] amen
[50:55] remember there's only two quotes on tape
[50:57] churches and both of them say that
[50:58] brother adam recommends only do it
[51:01] if there's no other church around and
[51:03] look at all these churches around
[51:04] jeffersonville there's plenty of
[51:05] preachers around jeffersonville there'll
[51:07] be no excuses on the day of judgment
[51:09] there's plenty churches around here
[51:11] there's no reason we should push play if
[51:12] we've got men that love the word of god
[51:14] and we've got men that love to preach it
[51:16] and if you see the word taking effect in
[51:19] your life
[51:20] amen
[51:23] hallelujah and i said show me one
[51:25] scripture where it says we don't need
[51:26] more preaching show me that
[51:28] where paul ever said well we won't need
[51:30] the fivefold ministry at the end time
[51:31] because it's the seventh church age
[51:33] nonsense
[51:35] nonsense
[51:37] now there's a whole lot more i could say
[51:40] but every christian should have a pastor
[51:42] because it's in the bible
[51:44] jesus looked when jesus went on earth
[51:46] brother austin he looked at all the
[51:47] multitudes and the bible said he wept or
[51:49] he was sad because they were like sheep
[51:51] with no shepherd
[51:53] they were like sheep that had no
[51:55] shepherd to watch over them the word
[51:56] pastor means shepherd
[51:58] in other words jesus said i wish all
[51:59] these people had a godly pastor to feed
[52:02] them my gospel amen my revelation to
[52:05] pray for them when they're sick and they
[52:06] get well praise god
[52:08] amen to preach to them the truth of
[52:10] god's word i wish they all had a pastor
[52:13] where they could gather around and be
[52:14] fed the word of god they could grow and
[52:16] become a better christian and they would
[52:18] hear the word and they could be happy as
[52:20] a christian
[52:21] because you got the drink of the living
[52:24] water and you got the bread of the word
[52:25] of god amen
[52:27] hallelujah
[52:30] now
[52:35] number two
[52:37] return ministry churches are equal to
[52:39] fivefold churches now return ministry
[52:41] church okay i didn't ever explain to you
[52:43] guys tape churches are people that don't
[52:44] believe in preachers really well they do
[52:46] sometimes but they just want to press
[52:48] play on a tape and just listen to
[52:50] brother branham although he's dead
[52:52] you should do that in your own your own
[52:54] life but not for church services
[52:56] church services you need living
[52:57] preachers
[52:58] now there's another group that say
[53:00] brother brown is going to raise from the
[53:01] dead and come back it's ridiculous these
[53:03] people are so ridiculous
[53:05] uh they just they don't pray they don't
[53:07] pray enough they don't fast enough they
[53:08] don't read their bible enough that's the
[53:10] trouble
[53:11] right they're by the bible's not the
[53:13] absolute anymore
[53:14] it's brother branham and that's wrong
[53:16] brother rams pointed us to the absolute
[53:18] brother brown point us to the bible
[53:19] praise god just like billy graham or any
[53:21] any preacher any real preacher will
[53:23] point you to god's word amen
[53:25] i don't care what their name is they're
[53:27] a real preacher they'll point to jesus
[53:28] christ and say get to the bible read the
[53:30] bible obey the bible praise god but we
[53:33] got a special revelation no doubt of the
[53:35] bible
[53:38] and i said no return ministry
[53:41] yeah the brother said
[53:42] a return ministry person said don't
[53:44] separate there's no difference between
[53:46] us and them i believe you're wrong can
[53:47] you believe that there's no difference
[53:49] the brother said there's no difference
[53:50] between preaching churches and return
[53:52] ministry of churches
[53:54] that's not the truth every return
[53:56] ministry church i've heard of which is
[53:58] like three
[54:00] they all they're all idolatrous they're
[54:03] all worshiping brother branham and
[54:04] they're breaking many scriptures they
[54:06] add to the word and they essentially
[54:08] worship brother branham
[54:11] their major sin is looking for brother
[54:13] branham instead of jesus christ
[54:15] praise god
[54:17] our eyes our minds our thoughts should
[54:19] all be on jesus amen
[54:22] he's the one that's coming back amen
[54:24] he's the one that's returning
[54:27] the brother said there shouldn't be a
[54:28] wall between the tape people and the
[54:29] church people i believe you're wrong
[54:31] because the lies coming out of the tape
[54:33] churches the lies coming out of the
[54:35] return ministry churches are heresies
[54:37] and they're causing people to have a
[54:39] spiritual gang green and commit sins
[54:43] that's right
[54:46] and the three churches i know of have
[54:48] child abuse in them that are returned
[54:49] ministry child abuse adultery and more
[54:54] the three that i've heard of because
[54:55] i've talked to other brothers there that
[54:56] have gone there and they preach there
[54:58] and they know the problems of the
[54:58] churches
[55:00] see because that gay that false doctrine
[55:03] causes more and more sin it starts
[55:04] eating their spiritual lives
[55:06] it eats it up and they know and then
[55:09] they just they surrender to any sin they
[55:11] want to do
[55:12] it's wickedness
[55:14] all right number three there is this
[55:16] brother said there's a william random
[55:18] trial in heaven right now and every
[55:20] service is being watched by the great
[55:21] courtroom looking saying where's the
[55:23] evidence of brother branham's preaching
[55:28] i said brother i said there's the truth
[55:30] is there's no trial for brother branham
[55:32] going on in heaven now because trials
[55:34] are saved to the great white throne
[55:35] judgment
[55:36] brother abraham said the judgment isn't
[55:38] now he says he said the trial is the
[55:41] great white throne judgment
[55:44] praise god
[55:46] yes we will be judged but will be judged
[55:48] at the judgment scene of christ
[55:50] according to 2 corinthians 5 10.
[55:52] and then everyone else who's not born
[55:54] again will be judged at the great white
[55:56] throne judgment according to revelation
[55:57] 20 verse 11.
[55:59] right
[56:02] now the bible does say satan is accusing
[56:04] us before god day and night in
[56:07] revelation 10 12.
[56:09] but god is always having his way praise
[56:11] god and god is always waiting for us to
[56:14] repent and then when we do he says i
[56:16] don't see any charges there's no more
[56:18] charges it's all forgiven praise god
[56:21] amen
[56:22] he can't accuse us when it's under the
[56:24] blood amen
[56:26] so let him accuse whatever he wants just
[56:28] make sure that accusation doesn't last
[56:30] very long in other words confess your
[56:32] sins as quick as possible amen
[56:34] hallelujah
[56:36] but there's no court trial going on
[56:38] right now
[56:40] that judgment is saved for the end time
[56:44] number four this is a real
[56:46] real burner
[56:49] i uh this brother says there's three
[56:52] seeds on the earth right now
[56:54] he talks about brother branham seed oral
[56:57] roberts and billy graham
[57:00] each one planted different seeds now the
[57:02] reason this is
[57:03] i believe this was just brother
[57:04] branham's opinion
[57:06] and the reasoning
[57:08] is simple
[57:09] because the
[57:10] the bible says there's only two kinds of
[57:12] seeds the bible never says there's three
[57:15] kind of seeds the bible says there's two
[57:17] kind of seeds so let's read it let's go
[57:19] to matthew 13 37 would you
[57:21] get your bible there we need some
[57:22] readers lydia malachi
[57:24] matthew 13 37
[57:32] now church there's only one quote in the
[57:33] message where brother rahm says three
[57:35] seeds and it's in that spoken word
[57:37] original seed sermon
[57:39] i believe brother man was just trying to
[57:40] find something
[57:42] as his opinion i do not believe there's
[57:44] three seeds because the bible doesn't
[57:45] say that
[57:46] the bible says there's only two seeds
[57:49] so let's see lydia you got it matthew 13
[57:51] 37 of course i'm going to ask my oldest
[57:54] go ahead
[58:00] great now go to verse 39 can you read
[58:02] that too
[58:08] okay now we don't have time to read all
[58:09] this but if you read all this there's
[58:11] only two seeds you have jesus's seed and
[58:13] you have the serpent seed or the devil
[58:15] seed
[58:16] there's only two there's not three kinds
[58:19] now i'm not talking about brother brown
[58:20] now i'm talking about the brother that
[58:21] preaches the brother said that billy
[58:24] graham and oral roberts preach
[58:25] denominational seed well any
[58:27] denominational seed is the seed of the
[58:28] antichrist
[58:30] well now you no longer have three seeds
[58:32] now you still have two seeds
[58:34] it's a total contradiction
[58:37] and it doesn't fit the bible because the
[58:39] two messengers that went down to sodom
[58:41] save souls amen they didn't plant
[58:43] denominational thoughts they saved lots
[58:46] all amen
[58:47] whatever seed they plan whatever word
[58:49] they preach it saved three souls amen
[58:52] it wasn't they didn't spread any
[58:54] denominational thoughts down there
[58:56] i know that's hard for message people to
[58:58] believe but most of them don't read
[58:59] their bibles
[59:00] that's the sad part about it just read
[59:03] your bible
[59:04] and again i'll share this brother
[59:06] emailed me back i'm sorry he sent me one
[59:08] text he and he just made this excuse he
[59:10] said well brother you're just way
[59:11] smarter than me and then he defended
[59:13] everything he just defended everything
[59:15] and said i don't want to talk about it
[59:16] god bless you well to me that proves
[59:18] you're wrong
[59:19] you can't i gave you 24 you can't even
[59:21] defend one of them
[59:23] and i said brother just let me know if
[59:25] i'm wrong on five of them let me know if
[59:26] i'm wrong on half of them if i'm wrong
[59:28] on 20 of them
[59:29] for crying out loud let me know if i'm
[59:31] just let me know if i'm right on any of
[59:33] them and the it don't he doesn't want to
[59:35] talk about anything
[59:37] the bible says
[59:38] to search the scriptures daily whether
[59:40] these things are so so see what does it
[59:42] show they're not searching the
[59:43] scriptures daily
[59:45] they won't even
[59:46] they won't even search the scriptures
[59:47] for their own preaching amen you hear me
[59:50] tonight
[59:51] they preach things and they won't even
[59:53] go search the scripture for what they
[59:54] preach god help us that real men of god
[59:57] that search the scripture know what
[59:58] they're saying and point us to the word
[1:00:00] of god amen i'm starting to get some
[1:00:02] fiery zeal here amen
[1:00:04] some fiery indignation amen
[1:00:06] because how can you be a preacher and
[1:00:07] not back up what you're preaching amen
[1:00:11] that means you're a lazy preacher
[1:00:13] and you're not even studying what you're
[1:00:14] saying you're just making things up as
[1:00:16] you go
[1:00:19] prove all things the bible said
[1:00:21] try every spirit whether it be of god
[1:00:26] amen ah
[1:00:30] there's only one quote on three seeds
[1:00:31] and then in the church age book brother
[1:00:33] brahm says there's only two seeds
[1:00:36] so that proves it he had five years to
[1:00:37] write that book
[1:00:39] and he made sure he didn't say three
[1:00:40] seeds it said two seeds
[1:00:44] now i could go on and on and on
[1:00:47] i got 18 pages
[1:00:49] single spaced
[1:00:51] i got quotes everywhere
[1:00:54] number five
[1:00:55] i'm gonna try to spare your
[1:00:57] i'm gonna try to spare you tonight i'm
[1:00:58] not gonna preach three hours tonight
[1:01:00] i could church i could preach four hours
[1:01:01] tonight i got so much material
[1:01:04] but i'm not gonna do that
[1:01:06] number five the fifth false doctrine the
[1:01:08] capstone has already been put on the
[1:01:09] church ages and we find ourselves in the
[1:01:12] very top of the capstone
[1:01:13] brother you said the breach isn't there
[1:01:15] anymore why because the capstone has
[1:01:16] been put on brother i believe you're
[1:01:18] wrong the church i'm sorry the truth is
[1:01:20] that the rapture is the time of the
[1:01:21] church ages being capped off with christ
[1:01:23] coming
[1:01:24] so this is new to austin so austin i'm
[1:01:26] going now that's the original one
[1:01:28] brother brand made but he corrected it
[1:01:30] later i'm sorry he changed his doctrine
[1:01:32] later but never corrected the picture
[1:01:35] okay so let me this is the real one that
[1:01:37] he taught
[1:01:40] this is you and i austin in the middle
[1:01:42] god adds all these anointings and then
[1:01:44] this capstone comes down and caps us off
[1:01:46] with the baptism holy ghost
[1:01:48] that's the baptism because god is love
[1:01:50] god is the holy ghost and brother this
[1:01:52] is right out of the scripture right here
[1:01:53] we don't have time to preach it tonight
[1:01:54] austin and lena but it's right here if
[1:01:56] you if you read this in your free time
[1:01:58] it says we have all these things and
[1:02:00] then love comes last it's right in the
[1:02:02] bible right
[1:02:03] and then the bible says we are we are a
[1:02:05] temple we're a building that god is
[1:02:07] building up
[1:02:09] so now when you have that understanding
[1:02:12] god is building up in every age god is
[1:02:14] building up christians to the last age
[1:02:17] and when god is done with the gentiles
[1:02:20] jesus christ returns this is jesus
[1:02:21] christ and he caps off the building of
[1:02:23] god and then god goes back to the jews
[1:02:26] that's a very quick summary
[1:02:28] there's a lot of scriptures i skipped
[1:02:29] over
[1:02:30] but it's all in the bible
[1:02:32] okay so this man saying oh the
[1:02:34] capstone's already on it
[1:02:36] i said that's not true
[1:02:39] the truth is it's only capped off when
[1:02:41] jesus christ returns
[1:02:43] praise god
[1:02:45] because that's what brother brahm said i
[1:02:46] have numerous quotes here
[1:02:49] what happened at that time the coming of
[1:02:51] that stone upwent the church
[1:02:54] into glory at the rapture because it
[1:02:56] ended with a gentile dispensation the
[1:02:58] man said sometime the capstone will
[1:03:00] return the head of it all and receive
[1:03:02] the bride unto himself
[1:03:04] praise god
[1:03:06] these are kind of deeper so don't feel
[1:03:08] bad
[1:03:08] you lena and austin you talked to my
[1:03:10] wife and i when we first came in the
[1:03:11] message we didn't understand anything
[1:03:13] anybody said the only thing we
[1:03:15] understood was water baptism so the
[1:03:17] preacher would preach all these things
[1:03:18] that he'd say and you need to be
[1:03:19] baptized in jesus name and i'd say amen
[1:03:21] i said amen that's right and i sit back
[1:03:24] down and i didn't understand anything
[1:03:25] else
[1:03:26] that's how it was for like the first
[1:03:27] month or two you know two or three
[1:03:29] months i don't understand nothing all i
[1:03:30] knew is that the bible said be baptized
[1:03:33] in jesus christ's name and i believed it
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:36] so don't feel bad because we all got to
[1:03:37] go through this
[1:03:38] unless you're born and raised and then
[1:03:40] you start you know but then you still
[1:03:41] got to understand things right
[1:03:43] my children still ask great questions
[1:03:45] questions are a good thing
[1:03:47] that's why on sunday nights when in
[1:03:48] february when we start back up you're
[1:03:50] going to hear all these good questions
[1:03:51] of these children back here they ask me
[1:03:53] some of the hardest questions i've ever
[1:03:54] been asked in my life
[1:03:55] and then that's when you can ask
[1:03:56] questions any time but that's a good
[1:03:58] time to ask questions
[1:03:59] number six i'm going fast
[1:04:02] this brother said there's three ages in
[1:04:04] this last age
[1:04:06] today then he said in the 80s there was
[1:04:08] a sanctification and then he said the
[1:04:10] baptism holy ghost fell around 2 000.
[1:04:13] that's just ridiculous
[1:04:16] he said i don't know
[1:04:18] you know i know where he got he got it
[1:04:19] from his own experience
[1:04:21] he's getting he's basing these from his
[1:04:23] own thoughts rather than the word of god
[1:04:26] but that's wrong the lutheran age
[1:04:27] brother was in the reformation 1500s the
[1:04:30] wesley's age was in the 1700s and now
[1:04:33] we're in
[1:04:34] the branham age or the holy ghost age as
[1:04:37] far as
[1:04:38] the baptism of the holy ghost okay but
[1:04:40] he tried to squeeze all of it in the
[1:04:41] last 30 years or 40 years that's
[1:04:43] ridiculous
[1:04:46] okay the truth is that individual
[1:04:48] believers go through the three works of
[1:04:49] grace in this age
[1:04:51] because that's the same in every age
[1:04:55] right
[1:04:56] but not that luth or wesley branham ages
[1:04:59] all took place in 1965
[1:05:02] or after 1965
[1:05:04] yeah after
[1:05:05] that's a that's
[1:05:06] for more advanced people you know as far
[1:05:08] as i mean not that you guys are in
[1:05:09] advance but you know they've just heard
[1:05:11] more right so don't feel bad don't feel
[1:05:13] bad
[1:05:14] feel good
[1:05:15] jesus loves you feel good feel real good
[1:05:18] yeah jesus loves you
[1:05:20] number seven
[1:05:21] he said the saints in heaven are on
[1:05:23] dangerous ground can you imagine that
[1:05:25] he says saints that are in heaven right
[1:05:27] now with the angels
[1:05:29] are on dangerous ground and i got all
[1:05:31] the time stamps he can go back and
[1:05:33] listen to it if you want but you don't
[1:05:34] want you don't want to listen to it
[1:05:37] and i'll be honest some preachers don't
[1:05:38] listen to it either
[1:05:40] because they're scared because they're
[1:05:41] either scared or it takes too much time
[1:05:44] to find the truth but church we ought to
[1:05:45] be really interested in the truth of
[1:05:48] god and they say they're between life
[1:05:51] and death during this trial that's going
[1:05:53] on and everyone who died in the church
[1:05:55] ages is hanging in the balance they're
[1:05:57] not going to make it without the
[1:05:58] evidence of us manifesting that third
[1:06:01] seed of brother branham's seed
[1:06:03] that's ridiculous
[1:06:05] it's a misunderstanding of hebrews 12
[1:06:06] where it says without us they cannot be
[1:06:08] perfected that's a misunderstanding
[1:06:13] i said brother the truth is the heavenly
[1:06:15] saints already have eternal bodies
[1:06:18] they already got eternal life
[1:06:21] how are you going to hang in the balance
[1:06:22] how can you be hanging between eternal
[1:06:24] life and eternal death when you've
[1:06:26] already got it amen
[1:06:28] you've already got eternal life a
[1:06:29] perfect body a word body in other words
[1:06:32] you've already got it it's already
[1:06:33] sealed there's no changing you're not
[1:06:35] there's there's no change there's no
[1:06:37] worrying about it you're you're there
[1:06:39] you're arrived you've got the nature of
[1:06:41] god amen
[1:06:43] hallelujah
[1:06:47] you know all these for all these i say
[1:06:48] will you please show me a scripture if
[1:06:50] i'm wrong
[1:06:52] i'm still waiting two months later
[1:06:54] this is october so november i'm still
[1:06:57] waiting two months later for one
[1:06:58] scripture one thing to show me that i'm
[1:07:00] wrong
[1:07:02] but it's an important church i'll show
[1:07:03] you at the end it's important
[1:07:05] number eight
[1:07:06] there's more grace now than when jesus
[1:07:09] died
[1:07:10] and mercy is greater now than it was
[1:07:11] then and you showed mercy to jesus
[1:07:13] christ i said brother you're wrong the
[1:07:15] truth is that mercy or forgiveness of
[1:07:17] sins only comes through substitutionary
[1:07:19] blood
[1:07:20] the same blood from jesus cross offers
[1:07:23] the same mercy both now in the past and
[1:07:25] all time
[1:07:27] show me one scripture
[1:07:28] that says uh jesus blood is not was not
[1:07:31] as great in his day as it is in our day
[1:07:32] there's no scripture on that
[1:07:34] and that's why he doesn't give give me
[1:07:36] any answers and i say this in love i'm
[1:07:37] kind of fired up now if our brother
[1:07:39] watches please know that i'm not i'm not
[1:07:41] upset i'm just kind of fired up because
[1:07:42] i want to stand for the truth
[1:07:45] number nine on the day of pentecost
[1:07:48] heaven was empty
[1:07:50] that's not true
[1:07:52] the truth is jesus body was sitting at
[1:07:53] the right hand of the majesty on high on
[1:07:55] the day of pentecost where he still sits
[1:07:57] today
[1:07:59] praise god
[1:08:01] and where's the scripture uh malakai get
[1:08:03] a scripture
[1:08:04] luke
[1:08:05] 20
[1:08:07] verse 42 and 43 buddy you got it let's
[1:08:10] see how fast he can be what time you
[1:08:11] ready thousand one thousand two look at
[1:08:13] that yeah go ahead buddy
[1:08:16] luke 20 42 and 43.
[1:08:25] amen so jesus went up to heaven and he
[1:08:28] sat down and the bible says he sits down
[1:08:31] till all the enemies are under his feet
[1:08:34] is the pope under his feet right now
[1:08:36] is russia under is china under his feet
[1:08:39] right now no
[1:08:42] is the coronavirus under his feet right
[1:08:43] now no
[1:08:44] all enemies
[1:08:46] will be under jesus feet and then he
[1:08:48] gets up amen praise
[1:08:50] god hallelujah and brother ram did say i
[1:08:53] have quotes or brother brahm did say
[1:08:55] god's jesus bodies up in heaven and then
[1:08:58] he sent the spirit down to the earth
[1:09:00] making up the body of christ
[1:09:03] number 10
[1:09:05] god sent his feminine part
[1:09:08] to earth at pentecost
[1:09:11] that's not true the truth is god cannot
[1:09:14] be divided into two separate male and
[1:09:15] female
[1:09:16] parts as he's infinite so no feminine
[1:09:19] part of god came to earth on the day of
[1:09:21] pentecost and i said if so please show
[1:09:23] me a scripture and i'll change my
[1:09:24] thought
[1:09:26] i know the type he's trying to use adam
[1:09:28] and eve but that doesn't work
[1:09:30] that was just a type
[1:09:31] god doesn't have a
[1:09:33] actual feminine part and a female part
[1:09:35] god doesn't have that
[1:09:37] because the bible doesn't say that
[1:09:38] it's a type
[1:09:41] number eleven there's coming a time in
[1:09:42] the church ages before the rapture when
[1:09:44] the fullness of god comes in the bride i
[1:09:46] said that's not true the fullness of god
[1:09:49] is only in jesus christ and cannot be in
[1:09:51] bride in the bride until
[1:09:54] uh the new jerusalem
[1:09:57] okay
[1:10:01] all right in order to have the fullness
[1:10:03] of the godhead you have to have all
[1:10:05] power and authority
[1:10:06] right
[1:10:07] in matthew 28 jesus said all power and
[1:10:10] authority is given unto me
[1:10:12] it never said it was given to us
[1:10:14] we have a portion of power we have a
[1:10:16] portion of authority but we don't have
[1:10:18] it all all of it was given to jesus
[1:10:21] there's no scripture that says we have
[1:10:23] all power and authority
[1:10:26] and here's where the fear starts getting
[1:10:27] put in here
[1:10:29] you'll see it in a little bit
[1:10:32] now uh lydia ephesians 1 23. see how
[1:10:35] that i put so much pressure forgive me
[1:10:37] each other i mean
[1:10:38] uh i appreciate all their work though
[1:10:40] ephesians 1 23.
[1:10:41] in ephesians 1 23 there will be a time
[1:10:45] when all the fullness is in the bride
[1:10:46] but it's going to be shared between
[1:10:48] jesus and the bride it's in the future
[1:10:50] home so read ephesians 1 23.
[1:10:57] there it is
[1:10:58] so when the body of christ is with jesus
[1:11:00] christ in the new jerusalem then the
[1:11:03] bible said all the fullness of god will
[1:11:05] be fulfilling them all in all
[1:11:08] but not right now and i don't even
[1:11:10] believe before the rapture
[1:11:13] right
[1:11:14] because
[1:11:15] we can't have all the power and
[1:11:16] authority as long as we have sin in our
[1:11:18] bodies there's no way
[1:11:20] we'll have all the power and authority
[1:11:22] that's why jesus could have all power
[1:11:24] and authority because he didn't have sin
[1:11:26] in his life amen
[1:11:28] think about that church think about your
[1:11:30] sin nature
[1:11:32] what would you do with god's authority
[1:11:34] with your sin nature when you're feeling
[1:11:35] upset
[1:11:36] what would you do
[1:11:40] what would you do
[1:11:41] let's say you're let's say you're mad at
[1:11:42] you're you're you're hubby you're you're
[1:11:44] mad at your wife and you have all power
[1:11:45] and authority
[1:11:47] god just do this or that i mean can you
[1:11:49] imagine what you'd say
[1:11:50] and then you regret it
[1:11:54] because you still have sin in your life
[1:11:55] right you still
[1:11:57] that's why we can't have the fullness of
[1:11:59] the godhead until we have brand new
[1:12:01] bodies amen do we have theophanies
[1:12:03] glorified bodies and all three are all
[1:12:05] in one and there's no more devil there's
[1:12:07] no more temptation that's at the new
[1:12:09] jerusalem amen
[1:12:11] like ephesians 1 23 says when all the
[1:12:14] fullness of god fills everything
[1:12:17] but not before that
[1:12:20] and i said so i told the brother i said
[1:12:21] brother we don't need the fullness to go
[1:12:23] in the rapture because enoch didn't need
[1:12:25] it
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:27] john i'm sorry elijah didn't need the
[1:12:29] fullness of the holy ghost he just
[1:12:32] needed an invitation from heaven praise
[1:12:34] god and that's all we need a door open
[1:12:36] in heaven hallelujah
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:40] he did it under the blood of bulls and
[1:12:42] goats but we'll do it by the blood of
[1:12:44] christ amen
[1:12:45] god's lamb
[1:12:50] glorious church i'll tell you that's
[1:12:51] move
[1:12:53] i love the word don't you
[1:12:55] then the brother said god came to
[1:12:57] rapture the bride at the council of
[1:12:58] nicaea i said brother
[1:13:01] the truth is jesus coming to rapture the
[1:13:03] bride is at the end of the laodicean
[1:13:04] church age because it was predestined
[1:13:06] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:09] jesus is the one that wrote the seven
[1:13:11] letters to the seven churches so jesus
[1:13:13] knew the rapture was after the laodicean
[1:13:15] age not the third church age
[1:13:19] these people
[1:13:21] they what they do saints is they take
[1:13:22] one quote and they run a mile with it
[1:13:24] and they fail to go read the bible
[1:13:27] or even consider what the bible says
[1:13:30] brother ram did make that statement
[1:13:33] right because he was talking about when
[1:13:34] the church married the state you
[1:13:36] remember that
[1:13:37] at the council in isaiah the church
[1:13:39] married the state through constantine so
[1:13:41] he said brother man was just dramatizing
[1:13:42] saying well jesus came to rapture the
[1:13:44] bride but his bride married the state
[1:13:47] it was just it was just a drama
[1:13:49] or it was his own opinion but jesus
[1:13:51] christ knew i'm not rapturing the bride
[1:13:53] until the seven church age is over
[1:13:55] that's why i wrote seven letters
[1:13:58] i mean you would think people would
[1:14:00] understand that
[1:14:02] is this okay brother austin and lean is
[1:14:03] this okay some of it some some of it
[1:14:05] might be too difficult but but we can
[1:14:07] always ask questions that's that's the
[1:14:08] best part
[1:14:11] as a pastor i always have more sermons i
[1:14:12] can preach preach more about god's grace
[1:14:14] 13
[1:14:16] the brother said the church age has
[1:14:17] ended the truth is the current church
[1:14:19] age is over at the rapture
[1:14:22] i have two quotes on that brother brahms
[1:14:24] said
[1:14:26] it hasn't ended when it ends the church
[1:14:28] is gone so as long as the church is here
[1:14:30] how many church members are here how
[1:14:32] many bride members are here he said it
[1:14:34] hasn't ended yet praise god as long as
[1:14:37] we're here the church age is not over
[1:14:40] and that's where people get concerned
[1:14:42] confused about the bride age the bright
[1:14:44] age is just the baptism of the holy
[1:14:46] ghost
[1:14:47] that's all it is praise god it's not
[1:14:49] something separate brother man says
[1:14:51] we're still as long as the we're still
[1:14:52] here laodicea is still going on but we
[1:14:55] have a special age amen we have a
[1:14:57] special time when we've got the
[1:14:58] revelation of the word and our hearts
[1:15:00] are restored back to the apostolic
[1:15:02] fathers amen and all truth has been
[1:15:04] restored
[1:15:06] that's the bright age amen the baptism
[1:15:08] of the holy ghost with all the mysteries
[1:15:10] finished
[1:15:12] oh thank god amen
[1:15:16] number 14 now jesus is in you making you
[1:15:19] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:15:23] and i said the bible says jesus christ
[1:15:26] had the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:15:28] not us
[1:15:33] only jesus christ has that
[1:15:37] i got way more
[1:15:39] way more
[1:15:42] now here's where it gets kind of
[1:15:43] personal the brother said anyone that
[1:15:44] believes
[1:15:46] uh you can't make the rapture without a
[1:15:47] pastor has the mark of the beast and
[1:15:49] basically the brother is saying i
[1:15:50] preached the mark of the beast
[1:15:52] i guess that's why it meant so much to
[1:15:54] me to kind of try to correct this
[1:15:56] because i believe show me a scripture
[1:15:59] where god is not going to use
[1:16:01] the fivefold ministry to bring unity to
[1:16:03] the church show me one show me
[1:16:06] well if there's none that says that and
[1:16:08] ephesians 4 says when he's going to use
[1:16:10] the five full ministry till we all come
[1:16:12] in the union of faith then all the holy
[1:16:14] ghosts feel saints gotta have a pastor
[1:16:16] and the church said
[1:16:18] show me one where you don't need the
[1:16:20] five full ministry you're never gonna
[1:16:21] find one
[1:16:23] show me one
[1:16:25] so this brother is basically saying i'm
[1:16:27] preaching the mark of the beast but you
[1:16:29] know what when it looks like it he's
[1:16:30] saying tape churches are the same
[1:16:32] return ministry churches are the same
[1:16:33] we're all the same he's actually the one
[1:16:35] preaching the mark of the beast
[1:16:37] right because we're all the same
[1:16:40] doesn't matter if your return or tape or
[1:16:42] or fivefold or not no fold
[1:16:47] he's the one basically saying it's the
[1:16:48] mark of the beast for them
[1:16:50] we're all all the same we we all can go
[1:16:53] to heaven we're all going to rapture
[1:16:54] nonsense
[1:16:56] you don't have any scripture for that
[1:16:57] the scripture says the fivefold ministry
[1:16:59] perfects you in the image of jesus
[1:17:01] christ the stature of jesus christ
[1:17:04] number 15 or sorry 16
[1:17:06] yeah
[1:17:08] and then he kind of lumps us all
[1:17:09] together and says the message believers
[1:17:11] accept the fivefold ministry instead of
[1:17:12] the holy ghost well i said the truth is
[1:17:14] some of them accept preachers more than
[1:17:16] christ because then when the preacher
[1:17:17] falls away they fall away amen but there
[1:17:20] are some of them that accept jesus
[1:17:22] christ and no matter who falls away they
[1:17:24] stay with the bible because they love
[1:17:26] the bible amen
[1:17:28] because they did not accept a preacher
[1:17:30] they accepted jesus christ the one the
[1:17:32] preacher was talking about amen
[1:17:34] hallelujah
[1:17:35] so if i would fall away god forbid but i
[1:17:38] fall away you'd stay strong because you
[1:17:39] believe in jesus christ
[1:17:42] i'm not jesus christ i can never be it's
[1:17:44] impossible i fall short of the glory
[1:17:46] every single day but i'm pointing you to
[1:17:48] jesus christ
[1:17:50] amen and you need to search the
[1:17:51] scriptures daily to make sure these
[1:17:53] things are so
[1:17:57] and then he see this is an attack on the
[1:17:58] fivefold ministry here's another one he
[1:18:00] says it's a weakness to say you need a
[1:18:02] home church
[1:18:05] he said you're weak if you say if i
[1:18:06] don't have a home church i just can't
[1:18:07] stay in the right place
[1:18:09] i say brother you're downplaying the
[1:18:11] need to have a home church by making it
[1:18:13] sound like only a weak believer feels a
[1:18:15] need for a home church i believe you're
[1:18:16] wrong the truth is ephesians 4 and many
[1:18:18] brother ram quotes say we're perfected
[1:18:20] by the fivefold ministry without it
[1:18:22] we're immature and tossed by every wind
[1:18:24] of doctrine i have quotes from brother
[1:18:26] brown said you better stay where the
[1:18:28] spirit of god is being poured out in the
[1:18:30] church
[1:18:32] look at all of our friends that have
[1:18:34] left church and they stopped coming to
[1:18:35] church look what happens they're no
[1:18:37] longer under the pouring out of the holy
[1:18:38] ghost and they get worldly they get
[1:18:41] sinful they leave god's water amen
[1:18:44] and they dry up but if you stay here you
[1:18:46] stay fresh amen you stay drinking on the
[1:18:49] water of god you'll grow you'll be like
[1:18:51] jesus amen
[1:18:53] hallelujah
[1:18:55] you want to help the poor amen
[1:18:58] you want to help the fatherless and the
[1:18:59] widows you'll send people money you'll
[1:19:01] do whatever you can even if you don't
[1:19:03] know him you'll send them money because
[1:19:04] you love god and you want to love god's
[1:19:06] people praise god
[1:19:09] become more like jesus all the time
[1:19:15] and then he said nowhere in the
[1:19:16] messenger bible does it say you cannot
[1:19:17] make it without the five full ministry
[1:19:20] and i said again ephesians 4 says we're
[1:19:22] perfected with the five full ministry
[1:19:24] without it you're tossed by every wind
[1:19:25] of doctrine
[1:19:26] see it's an attack on basically its
[1:19:28] attack on me preachers
[1:19:30] and all of us preachers that love the
[1:19:31] word of god
[1:19:33] number 19 the fivefold ministry today is
[1:19:35] the oral roberts pentecostal group
[1:19:37] because the spirit moves in the tape
[1:19:39] church is the billy graham seed
[1:19:41] the truth is there's only two seeds
[1:19:43] god's seed in the serpent seed the true
[1:19:44] bride church has the seed of god
[1:19:49] that's kind of a repeat but just let you
[1:19:51] know this brother calls us uh oral
[1:19:53] roberts churches i just preached on oral
[1:19:55] roberts he was all about money and
[1:19:57] church we're not all about money
[1:19:59] keep your money if you want you'll see
[1:20:00] god won't bless you
[1:20:02] keep your ties you'll see
[1:20:03] you'll find out real fast
[1:20:06] but god said give a tenth to support the
[1:20:09] church so you can have a place to
[1:20:10] worship amen
[1:20:12] right so they can study and pray and
[1:20:13] preach the word of god to you feed your
[1:20:15] souls amen praise god but
[1:20:18] brother roberts was begging
[1:20:20] he said if you don't give me eight
[1:20:21] million dollars god's gonna kill me and
[1:20:23] that and they raise the eight million
[1:20:25] dollars
[1:20:26] to build a building and now the
[1:20:27] building's falling apart i mean
[1:20:30] and then he asked for a million more
[1:20:31] dollars to make a hospital that only
[1:20:33] lasted eight years
[1:20:35] it's not even it's not even operating
[1:20:36] today
[1:20:37] god doesn't save the world by money god
[1:20:39] saves the world by love
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:43] god saves the world by the holy ghost
[1:20:45] amen cleaning out your life washing you
[1:20:47] and making you a new person amen
[1:20:50] that's how he saves people not by money
[1:20:52] but love amen
[1:20:54] hallelujah
[1:20:58] the brother said there's a prophecy or
[1:20:59] decree that the fullness of the godhead
[1:21:01] bodily would again be manifest in the
[1:21:03] bride i said there's no prophecy now
[1:21:05] look he's saying there's prophecy i'm
[1:21:06] saying show me prophecy and he won't
[1:21:08] even show me a prophecy
[1:21:11] so what does that mean he's falsely
[1:21:12] prophesying
[1:21:14] he says there's prophecy but there's no
[1:21:16] prophecy
[1:21:18] the only time the fullness of god is in
[1:21:20] us is when we have new bodies in the new
[1:21:22] jerusalem
[1:21:23] and i have scripture for that and i'm
[1:21:24] open to correction if somebody can show
[1:21:26] me wrong
[1:21:27] as long as we have sin in this guy
[1:21:29] there'll never be the fullness because
[1:21:31] it wasn't meant to be us it was meant to
[1:21:33] be the fullness in jesus christ
[1:21:36] the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt
[1:21:38] in him
[1:21:39] colossians 1 and then colossians 2 9.
[1:21:45] now look he brings it down to fear look
[1:21:46] at this i'm almost done i'm 24. look at
[1:21:48] this
[1:21:49] i still got five six minutes left on my
[1:21:50] hour
[1:21:52] he said he looks at the congregation is
[1:21:54] there one person here who can make the
[1:21:56] word live
[1:21:57] the fullness of the godhead bodily that
[1:21:58] is so ridiculous that's asking which of
[1:22:00] you can walk on water like jesus nobody
[1:22:03] can do that
[1:22:04] which if you can raise the devil if you
[1:22:06] can why don't you go to the funeral
[1:22:07] raise somebody from the dead
[1:22:09] help out a family that's struggling
[1:22:12] he's putting all this pressure you it's
[1:22:13] impossible
[1:22:15] we can't have the fullness of the
[1:22:16] godhead bodily
[1:22:18] the truth is no bride member can do that
[1:22:20] only jesus christ makes the fullness of
[1:22:22] the godhead live
[1:22:29] he said there has to be an evidence in
[1:22:30] our lives that brings the saints back to
[1:22:32] life
[1:22:34] in other words you've got to bring the
[1:22:35] saints back to life i ain't bringing
[1:22:36] anybody back to life i never could i
[1:22:38] never will jesus christ is going to
[1:22:40] bring people back to life
[1:22:42] jesus christ brother branstad is the one
[1:22:43] who does the shout voice and trump amen
[1:22:46] it's jesus christ calling the dead back
[1:22:48] to life it's not me
[1:22:52] show me a scripture where it says you
[1:22:53] call the dead back to life you don't
[1:22:55] shout voice trump
[1:22:58] shout jesus shout voice of the archangel
[1:23:00] trump of god where are you in there
[1:23:02] you're not in there so don't worry about
[1:23:03] it don't put pressure on yourself don't
[1:23:05] live in fear live in faith
[1:23:08] but see how these preachers like to do
[1:23:09] it like to put pressure on people fear
[1:23:11] they're putting the spirit of fear on
[1:23:12] people
[1:23:15] and then he made it seem like brother
[1:23:16] branham tabernacle played tapes often
[1:23:18] when brother branham was alive and
[1:23:20] there's no proof of that
[1:23:23] the truth is brother branham tabernacle
[1:23:25] rarely had tape services and those
[1:23:27] services never resembled the modern tape
[1:23:29] services
[1:23:31] like think about this did you know
[1:23:33] sometimes at
[1:23:34] tabernacle services today they invite
[1:23:36] brother brown their pastor to preach and
[1:23:38] it's like inviting a dead person to
[1:23:40] preach
[1:23:41] it's so evil
[1:23:43] it's spiritualism because it's contact
[1:23:45] with the dead did you know that
[1:23:47] they hold they hold weddings and let
[1:23:49] brother branham do the wedding
[1:23:51] on a tape
[1:23:52] i got video of it i watch it i'm sure
[1:23:54] i'm sure some of you have too
[1:23:55] i could i could look it up real easily
[1:23:59] they brother man never did that and this
[1:24:00] brother is saying well however it is now
[1:24:02] and tape services is the same way it was
[1:24:04] when brother brown was alive that's
[1:24:05] nonsense
[1:24:07] it wasn't that way when brother brown
[1:24:08] was alive he'd say see you saints
[1:24:10] brother neville's going to preach the
[1:24:11] word to you amen
[1:24:13] a living man with the fire of god in his
[1:24:15] soul with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:18] feeding god sheep amen
[1:24:20] hallelujah
[1:24:23] it's not these lies they're talking
[1:24:24] about today
[1:24:26] god's spirit will always point us to
[1:24:28] truth
[1:24:29] now i'm feeling really fiery over here
[1:24:31] got a lot of zeal here so forgive me
[1:24:33] if i love truth last one
[1:24:38] now i stopped early
[1:24:40] i could have found more false teachings
[1:24:42] in this one sermon it's like a two hour
[1:24:44] two and a half hour sermon i could have
[1:24:46] found way more
[1:24:47] but i stopped at 24 i thought that's a
[1:24:49] pretty good number the 24 elders right
[1:24:51] that's a good number
[1:24:56] now i made a video on this brother ram
[1:24:58] did say this he said the word from
[1:25:00] pentecost so acts chapter 2 won't work
[1:25:02] for today but brother brown was talking
[1:25:04] about the rapture
[1:25:06] pentecost will get you the baptism of
[1:25:07] the holy ghost that will work today but
[1:25:09] that's not enough to get you in the
[1:25:10] rapture you need more scriptures to be
[1:25:12] fulfilled
[1:25:13] right
[1:25:15] because acts 2 has been in effect all
[1:25:16] this time but we need god to fulfill the
[1:25:19] rapture scriptures if we're going to go
[1:25:20] in the rapture
[1:25:22] because all the saints down through the
[1:25:23] ages with the holy ghost they've all
[1:25:24] died
[1:25:26] so we need god to fulfill prophecy in
[1:25:28] other words
[1:25:30] right just a holy ghost scripture won't
[1:25:32] take in the rapture you need god to
[1:25:34] fulfill the shout the voice and the
[1:25:36] trump amen we need god to fulfill the
[1:25:38] trump of god the last trump hallelujah
[1:25:41] where we're changed in a moment in a
[1:25:43] twinkling of an eye that's what he's
[1:25:44] talking about we need that scripture
[1:25:46] fulfilled today if we're going to be
[1:25:48] raptured praise god
[1:25:52] just all this means is we need a
[1:25:54] different scripture for the rapture
[1:25:57] and just not the scripture for pentecost
[1:25:59] because that's not rapture scripture
[1:26:04] see he was using that to say well we
[1:26:06] need the feminine are we the masculine
[1:26:08] part of god to come back because we
[1:26:09] already got the feminine part of god
[1:26:12] it doesn't make any sense
[1:26:14] there's nothing like that in the bible
[1:26:15] you never find that in the bible
[1:26:21] now i've looked at this preacher he's a
[1:26:23] wonderful man i talked to him on the
[1:26:24] phone one time
[1:26:29] and i better stop right there let's uh
[1:26:31] stop the live stream i'm going to say a
[1:26:32] few things here thank you live streamers
[1:26:34] love you all those watching archive god
[1:26:36] bless you let me know if i can help you
[1:26:37] if you have
