[28:37] [Music]
[28:59] like to cover the biblical numerology
[29:03] again tonight by the grace of the Lord
[29:07] resides the scriptures we could go to I
[29:10] think let's go
[29:13] are we start with Hebrews chapter 9 I
[29:15] just want to you just use an example one
[29:17] of the three divine perfection
[29:20] Testaments let's go to Hebrews chapter 9
[29:31] Hebrews 9 24 by God's grace
[29:47] so in this portion of text we have three
[29:50] appearances of Christ which is very
[29:53] fitting of how Jesus has three comings
[29:56] so we see the three appearances here in
[29:58] the scripture
[30:01] so Hebrews 924 for Christ is not entered
[30:04] into the holy places made with hands
[30:06] which are the figures of the true but
[30:09] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[30:13] presence of God for us we know he's
[30:15] appearing right now in heaven for us was
[30:20] 25 nor yet that he should offer himself
[30:22] often as a high priest entereth into the
[30:25] holy place every year with blood of
[30:26] others for then must he have often have
[30:30] suffered since the foundation of the
[30:32] world but now once in the end of the
[30:34] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[30:36] by the sacrifice of himself so that
[30:41] birth so we can see who is the first the
[30:45] second and the presence of God for us
[30:47] verse 27 and as it is appointed unto men
[30:51] once to die but happen here's the final
[30:53] appearance so Christ was once offered to
[30:56] bear the sins of many and unto them that
[30:58] look for him shall he appear the second
[31:03] time without sin unto salvation
[31:06] Amen some three appearances of Christ's
[31:08] earthly coming earthly appearance
[31:11] heavenly appearance and his third or
[31:14] second coming we'd say which is his
[31:16] third appearance by God's grace how many
[31:18] can see those three appearances renamed
[31:20] Amos as far as the word of Prayer and
[31:21] we'll have you be seated in a moment
[31:22] Heavenly Father we ask Lord you take
[31:24] this word that we read Lord bless it to
[31:26] our hearts Lord God father we know these
[31:29] numbers teach us about you reveal more
[31:31] of yourself to us tonight Lord show us
[31:33] your Divine patterns your divine
[31:35] perfection O God your divine ways Lord
[31:37] and we'll be happy we'll be grateful
[31:39] Lord as we sit on Sunday that our eyes
[31:41] Lord would be open to see more of your
[31:43] leadership in our lives so we thank you
[31:46] for your mercy or we get you all the
[31:47] glory on her praise in Jesus Christ's
[31:49] name the church said god bless you I
[31:52] should be in seated there let's look at
[31:56] biblical numerology part 2 and I know
[32:00] you'll be blessed by the grace of the
[32:02] Lord I just want to quickly review we
[32:05] looked at the meanings of numbers number
[32:07] one represents primacy or preeminence
[32:09] and unity number two has poor meanings
[32:13] division difference testimony and then
[32:17] friendship or unity and we started
[32:21] number three on Sunday and we'll finish
[32:24] that tonight and three means divine
[32:26] perfection will represents life we'll
[32:29] probably get to number four tonight
[32:31] hopefully I got a 111 slides right now
[32:35] on 175 so that's pretty good I think I
[32:37] maybe can get through almost tonight
[32:38] we'll see so I want to just start with
[32:44] the first one for our text tonight we
[32:46] looked at Christ's mission so Christ's
[32:48] mission was perfected with three
[32:50] appearances and that kind of talk to
[32:54] hi doing Jesus's 3 up convinced he came
[32:58] to redeem the bride rapture the bride
[33:00] he's coming that's the second one and
[33:02] then the third one to rule or reign with
[33:05] the bride so the 3 R's we can always
[33:07] remember the companies with Christ so
[33:09] this is interesting as we saw three
[33:12] appearances he hath appeared to take
[33:14] away sins on the cross he now appears
[33:17] and the Friends of God is mediator and
[33:19] he shall appear for those who are
[33:21] looking for I know you're looking for
[33:23] him tonight
[33:24] I'm looking for him tonight us so we see
[33:26] Christ's mission of his three
[33:29] appearances is perfect it's a perfect
[33:31] appearance now let's look at a few here
[33:34] you know I guess I guess what I'll do is
[33:37] I'll just got to go fastly through these
[33:39] you know you'll probably hopefully be
[33:40] able to nod it quite a bit and same into
[33:42] these if it's new to you maybe we'll go
[33:45] real like I know there's a few that
[33:46] might be new to you I mentioned one in
[33:48] the car about Isaac's Wells maybe we'll
[33:50] read that one I don't haven't preached
[33:52] that very much so they don't haven't
[33:54] preached that very much so that might be
[33:55] new to all of us here but anyways let's
[33:59] just let's look at this so three is
[34:01] divine perfection and let's look at
[34:04] Christ's earthly life with some of the
[34:06] threes in his life
[34:07] now again I'm just scratching the
[34:09] surface because there there's so much
[34:12] and to be honest I haven't I haven't
[34:15] typed in one two or three and the Bible
[34:17] and gone all the way through there
[34:18] because that would take hours and hours
[34:20] all I've done is I've read the five or
[34:23] six chapters in that book
[34:24] IEW Bolinger and then I pulled out all
[34:28] the types I'm sorry all the numbers I
[34:30] thought would fit plus with all the ones
[34:32] already made on an other list and I just
[34:33] kind of put them together that's that's
[34:35] what I've had time to do and so let's
[34:38] look at the threes in Christ's life now
[34:42] we know Christ had three poles right
[34:44] three stages of his ministry the first
[34:46] ministry was his healing ministry the
[34:49] second was his preaching or teaching
[34:50] which was a rejection a part of being
[34:53] rejected in his ministry or smaller
[34:56] ministry and the third part was his
[34:58] resurrected ministry he rose and then
[35:01] had three days I'm sorry forty days
[35:03] rather to preach and teach his disciples
[35:06] so
[35:07] in his earthly life he had three stages
[35:09] of his ministry and we see the same
[35:11] thing with brother Graham with the
[35:12] healing in his hand and discernment and
[35:14] then the opening of the word the third
[35:16] pole now there was three voices I'm not
[35:19] sure if you knew this that there was
[35:21] three but you probably know there was
[35:22] three heavenly voices about Jesus the
[35:25] first one was at his baptism then my
[35:27] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[35:29] that's the first one that was in Matthew
[35:31] 3:17 the second one is on Mount
[35:34] Transfiguration this is my beloved son
[35:36] son here he him and then the third one
[35:40] was right before his crucifixion let's
[35:43] read that let's go to John 12 28 because
[35:47] that's the one that were probably not
[35:48] the most familiar with John 12 28 right
[35:52] before his crucifixion God gave one more
[35:54] heavenly voice so his ministry was
[35:58] vindicated perfectly with three heavily
[36:00] voices amen now I like verse let's start
[36:04] in verse 26 if any man serve me let him
[36:06] follow me and where I am there shall
[36:08] also my servant be if any man serve me
[36:11] him will my father honor oh my that's
[36:14] what we want God to honor Oh story's god
[36:16] now is my soul troubled and what shall I
[36:19] say father save me from this hour but
[36:21] for this cause came I into this hour
[36:25] isn't it striking how the very cause of
[36:29] Jesus's life with very purpose of his
[36:31] life caused him trouble and sometimes we
[36:34] think you know we're outside of the will
[36:35] of God if you have trouble in our lives
[36:36] many times that the birth as well we
[36:43] have trouble because cause from which I
[36:45] came into the world so many times it was
[36:47] manifest God's purpose for our lives
[36:49] we'll have to make a decision in the
[36:51] midst of a trouble or trial or to make a
[36:53] decision then that decision will direct
[36:55] our entire lives
[36:57] so verse 28 father glorify thy then came
[37:02] there a voice from heaven saying I have
[37:04] both glorified glorified it and will
[37:06] glorify it again the people therefore
[37:09] that stood by and heard it said that it
[37:12] thundered others said an angel spake to
[37:15] him okay now if you some kind of her
[37:19] 32 and if I 5e lifted up from the earth
[37:22] will draw all men unto me this he said
[37:24] signifying the death he should die okay
[37:27] so we can see his baptism his adoption
[37:31] his crucifixion three heavenly voices to
[37:34] signify each stage of his life amen oh
[37:37] that's beautiful so in his earthly life
[37:40] we can see that now this one the next
[37:42] one will move on the next one
[37:44] in Jesus's beginning of his ministry he
[37:48] had to use it is written three times to
[37:50] overcome Satan to make him leave now
[37:53] remember why why we're going over these
[37:55] we're going over these so we'll get an
[37:56] idea about our life so at the end of
[38:00] this that that's one thing we can pray
[38:01] for if we feel like temptation is
[38:04] overcoming us there it's so hard we must
[38:06] remember if it took Jesus three times
[38:08] that makes a good leave
[38:09] it may it may take us three times as
[38:11] well we've got to resist whether it's
[38:13] the temptation to you know agreed to
[38:16] imitate or lust temptation or whatever a
[38:18] prior temptation whatever that is we've
[38:20] got at least rebuked it three times we
[38:22] got at least say it's written it's
[38:24] written it's written and God will help
[38:26] us so three times you have to say it's
[38:28] written to overcome the devil all right
[38:32] Jesus Christ raised three people from
[38:35] the dead so this was divine perfection
[38:39] of him as the life Giver
[38:41] amen he raised Geri's his daughter he
[38:44] remember he got you know he speaks
[38:47] everybody out of the house to remember
[38:48] that and then he brought in Peter James
[38:49] and John the second one was the widow's
[38:52] son on a funeral procession he stopped
[38:54] the procession and he raised that boy
[38:57] from the dead and the third one of
[38:58] course was Lazarus so we know he's the
[39:01] resurrection of life he proved it three
[39:02] times I am the resurrection and the life
[39:05] perfection okay now in Christ's mission
[39:09] he had three sons names he was son of
[39:12] man son of God son of David and these
[39:16] also directly connect to his three
[39:19] offices so as a son of man he was
[39:22] prophet as son of God he's high priest
[39:26] and as son of David he's king of the
[39:29] earth prophet priest King so the man
[39:33] RV son of God son of David praise the
[39:35] Lord so we see that his mission is
[39:38] perfected in those three offices with
[39:41] those three names praise God
[39:43] and then we already saw his three
[39:45] comings redeemed by the cross rapture
[39:47] his bride rule the Millennium okay this
[39:50] is one of them you may not have seen
[39:52] before this was new to me Jesus Christ
[39:57] had divine perfection as a shepherd
[40:02] there was three there was three parts to
[40:04] him being a shepherd that divinely
[40:07] perfected his role as shepherd the first
[40:11] one and this is I've looked all these up
[40:12] this is true the first one the Bible
[40:16] said the Good Shepherd gives his life
[40:18] for the Sheep
[40:19] so there's death so that's the first
[40:23] part of being a shepherd the first part
[40:25] was giving his life for the Sheep
[40:27] the second one the Bible call him the
[40:30] great Shepherd in resurrection so let's
[40:32] go to Hebrews 13 20 but see that one
[40:34] Hebrews 13 $20 if you want to read
[40:38] little sisters - I guess no 16 verse 13
[40:45] 2003 yes they were doing read em yeah
[40:51] now the God of peace that brought again
[40:54] from the dead our Lord Jesus that great
[40:57] Shepherd of the sheep through the blood
[40:58] of the everlasting covenant amen she's
[41:02] called Good Shepherd in his death he's
[41:05] called great Shepherd and resurrection
[41:07] who knows what he's called it a second
[41:08] coming he's one more Shepherd the chief
[41:11] Shepherd and that v8 about the last one
[41:14] I don't know been by the Holy Spirit
[41:16] truly inspired that man to write down
[41:17] all these all these beautiful numbers
[41:19] and then this proves he's the perfect
[41:21] Shepherd yeah he's good in death he's
[41:24] great Shepherd a resurrection and he's
[41:26] chief Shepherd when he returns so 1st
[41:29] Peter 4 5 Malachi can you read up course
[41:31] 1st Peter 4 5 money it's just a few
[41:34] pages after mr. the purse Peter 4 5 I'm
[41:41] sorry no I got it
[41:45] I must move down the wrong number
[41:56] dalek hypocrite it's gonna be pretty
[41:58] easy
[42:09] okay no numbers now first Peter five
[42:12] four four five forgive me okay so now
[42:16] why don't you just read three enforce
[42:18] verses 3 and 4 in Chapter five neither
[42:21] as being lords over God's heritage but
[42:23] being as samples to the flock it was the
[42:26] chief Shepherd shall appear you show
[42:27] see crowd floor that fades that away
[42:30] amen so he's chief Shepherd when he
[42:33] returns and he'll give you a crown of
[42:35] glory if you're faithful sheep how many
[42:42] one meeting my kids sitting I don't want
[42:43] to be a goat I don't want to be a
[42:44] Pharisee on your side you see I just
[42:46] want to be a sheep good if you are true
[42:48] sheep God will share his glory and give
[42:51] you a crown of light if when the chief
[42:52] Shepherd returned amen so that's that I
[42:55] was the one that was new to me he's
[42:57] perfected a shepherd in three names as a
[42:59] shepherd okay let's look at the
[43:01] crucifixion there was a there was five
[43:04] threes at least at the crucifixion Jesus
[43:07] was crucified at the third hour okay
[43:11] which would have been 9 a.m. that's when
[43:12] they began it darkness covered the earth
[43:15] for three hours so it was complete
[43:17] darkness was perfect darkness that was
[43:20] Matthew 27 45 a lot Jesus like Jonah had
[43:23] to endure his death for a portion of
[43:26] three days right crucified on Friday in
[43:28] the grave Saturday rows Sunday just like
[43:32] Jonah was in the belly three days
[43:35] jesus's perfection or life came on the
[43:38] third day that was in Luke 13 32 jesus
[43:43] said but on the third day I shall be
[43:44] perfected so divine perfection is three
[43:47] right
[43:48] he's divinely perfected with a divine
[43:50] perfect body on the third day and
[43:52] resurrection and there was three
[43:54] languages and scripted on the cross
[43:56] here is Jesus King of the Jews right
[43:59] last night Malcolm our nowcasting what
[44:01] was written on that inscription here is
[44:03] Jesus King of the Jews was that it I
[44:05] thought was so the three languages were
[44:08] Greek Hebrew and Latin so three
[44:11] languages so there's all these threes to
[44:13] show that Jesus Christ's crucifixion was
[44:16] done with divine perfection it was the
[44:19] perfect complete for crucifixion for our
[44:22] Lord and Savior okay now I'm gonna skip
[44:26] now to the Old Testament let's go back
[44:28] to the Old Testament and let's let's get
[44:32] how God did deal with the patriarchs and
[44:35] Israel in divine perfection so we'll
[44:39] start at the beginning why don't
[44:40] everybody turn to Genesis 26 17 why
[44:43] don't we just turn there just as 2617
[44:52] this is when we haven't covered too much
[44:56] I know I may have preached on that maybe
[44:57] once or twice who knows where this
[45:02] runo's or this type sound what is the
[45:04] three typos anybody never have any idea
[45:06] and yes I think it types out the three
[45:11] works of grace that's what I think
[45:12] because on both your digging you know
[45:14] there's working involved you know you're
[45:16] trying to go deep down until you hit the
[45:19] water - you hit life so to me it looks
[45:22] like the three stages of grace I know
[45:24] for sure st. vacation program said the
[45:27] RAM said sanctification is labor he said
[45:30] you have to be a legalist he compared to
[45:32] the hot Sun he compared to Ruth working
[45:34] in the hot fields because it's a it's a
[45:37] dying it's a very difficult thing dying
[45:39] out
[45:40] so Genesis 26 17 many doing reading 17
[45:47] and 18 in I departed and pitched his
[45:51] tent in the Valley of Gerard and quote
[45:53] there and Isaac didn't think it again
[45:56] the walls of water which they had baked
[45:57] in the days of Abraham his father for
[46:00] this Philistines had stopped him after
[46:02] the death of Abraham and he called their
[46:04] names after the names by which his
[46:05] father had company
[46:06] so look what look what Isaac's doing
[46:09] he's going back to the faith of his
[46:11] father's
[46:12] and doesn't Malachi 4:5 and 6a the
[46:14] children are going back to the others
[46:16] animate that of others that's why I
[46:18] believe it types out the three works of
[46:20] grace because we're just going back to
[46:22] the same works as Paul Peter st. John
[46:25] we're believing that that's that's what
[46:27] we go back to the very same works of Our
[46:29] Fathers amen
[46:30] okay now I can read nineteen and twenty
[46:35] found their love springing water the
[46:38] herd maneuver our did strike with eyes
[46:40] at certain said the slaughterers ours
[46:41] they called the name of the law east set
[46:43] because they strove with him Henry
[46:46] twenty one twenty and they dig another
[46:48] well and strove for that also and he
[46:51] called the name of it sitting that and
[46:55] he removed from thence and dig another
[46:58] well and for that they that stroke not
[47:01] and he called the name of it Rijo buff
[47:04] and he said for now the LORD hath made
[47:07] room for us and we shall be fruitful in
[47:09] the land amen
[47:11] so fruitfulness came on the third biggie
[47:14] right and we know we know only
[47:17] born-again believers can have the fruit
[47:19] of the Spirit all the other ones are
[47:22] impersonations era seasoned personated
[47:24] it everybody impersonated but Jesus
[47:26] Christ manifested all the fruits of the
[47:28] spirit because he was baptized with the
[47:31] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost descended and
[47:33] remained on him so fruitfulness came on
[47:35] the third one in other words life came
[47:36] on the third one that's how that's why I
[47:39] believe that types out the three works
[47:41] of grace now I didn't have time I want
[47:43] to look up the names I preached those
[47:44] before I think I did not get a chance to
[47:46] look up the names I apologize for that
[47:55] okay so what was the person sitting on
[47:58] what was this a sickness okay okay there
[48:04] was some contention and then there was
[48:06] room for all of us well the RAM said
[48:08] when you go for all of us well ransom
[48:10] when you the Holy Ghost he puts you in a
[48:11] room and then you can use you for any
[48:13] gift you know I like that they meant him
[48:16] praise the Lord
[48:17] thanks man okay thanks for ending it
[48:19] buddy I appreciate it so the next one is
[48:23] when we're very familiar with you for
[48:24] God destroyed side
[48:25] gamora he's at three men not two not
[48:28] what he said three men down to Sodom and
[48:30] Gomorrah
[48:31] okay with two angels and God was the
[48:34] other one and of course we don't
[48:40] and they they preach repentance down
[48:44] inside we know that's a two-spirit
[48:46] through brother Graham's ministry coming
[48:47] to the bride and then Roberts going down
[48:51] to the world to try to get them to
[48:53] repent okay this is not about I forgot
[48:56] about this one Israel when they were in
[48:59] bondage in Egypt they were Moses said he
[49:02] said Pharaoh we need to go three days in
[49:05] the desert to worship our God so three
[49:07] days represent a complete separation so
[49:10] that was divine perfection in order to
[49:12] really feel like they were separate from
[49:13] Egypt it would have taken a three-day
[49:15] journey that's when I hadn't phoned up
[49:18] also the spies brought back three things
[49:21] it tends to find a pearl and grapes figs
[49:23] and pomegranates so it had a perk at
[49:26] divine there was a vine perfection God
[49:28] vindicated three different attested
[49:31] Testaments and that was a perfect
[49:33] testing that the the promised land was a
[49:36] good land amen
[49:38] now there's three phases of Israel's
[49:40] Redemption leaving Egypt then in the
[49:43] desert and then the promised land that's
[49:45] divine perfection there are three
[49:47] sections of the tabernacle outer court
[49:49] holy place holiest I don't know if you
[49:52] remember this but the Jordan River was
[49:54] divided three times miraculously Joshua
[49:56] divided it with the ark Elijah divided
[50:00] it and then Elijah divided it so it was
[50:02] divided three times I'm not sure with
[50:05] that type so that types out but it was
[50:07] divided three times I know Jordan types
[50:09] death so death was the feet of three
[50:12] times I guess and they represented
[50:13] Jesus's three raising people from the
[50:15] dead maybe that maybe that's a type I
[50:18] don't know if you remember this but
[50:20] there was a three-day search for Elijah
[50:22] and second names to 17 and after the
[50:25] three days they decided he had to eat
[50:26] been raptured so the three days to give
[50:29] him the testimony that he was raptured
[50:31] three days for them to believe it
[50:33] alright God still dealing with Israel
[50:35] all males had to attend three of the
[50:38] great feasts unleavened bread the feast
[50:42] of weeks and Tabernacles and that's in
[50:43] Deuteronomy 16 verse 16 now of course
[50:46] you know there was seven feasts but the
[50:48] Bible says God said there was three
[50:50] feasts so the other ones kind of work
[50:52] out come out of the three
[50:54] and they are unleavened bread had
[50:56] Passover first unleavened bread
[50:58] firstfruits and then you had the feast
[51:01] of weeks and then the Tabernacles had
[51:03] three feasts trumpets atonement
[51:05] Tabernacles so it's like three one three
[51:07] but God Himself said there was three
[51:10] feasts okay all right
[51:13] God's still dealing with Israel there's
[51:15] three kinds of sacrifices sin offering
[51:17] peace offering thank offering and that's
[51:20] a divine testament to a perfect
[51:22] sacrifice there's three kinds of laws in
[51:25] the Old Testament moral law civil law
[51:28] ceremonial law now we know the
[51:31] ceremonial laws are fulfilled but many
[51:33] of the moral laws and civil laws still
[51:35] pertain to us today
[51:36] Mike with Deuteronomy 22:5 and we could
[51:39] give more examples by God's grace okay
[51:43] three things there were three things in
[51:45] the Ark of the Covenant the manna the
[51:47] law and Aaron's rod that budded Aaron's
[51:50] right Jesus said the Old Testament had
[51:53] three divisions jesus said in Luke 24:44
[51:56] the Bible said he started at the law and
[51:58] the prophets and the Psalms there's
[52:00] three divisions still tested that's
[52:03] divine perfection now God's divine
[52:07] perfect judgment against Babylon had
[52:09] three stages at many Tekel Paris
[52:13] so has those three words remember and
[52:15] then meant God had numbered his kingdom
[52:18] and finish it they are weighed in the
[52:20] balance and found one thing was a second
[52:21] and the third was that Kingdom is
[52:23] divided and given to the beats of
[52:25] persons so there was three stages or
[52:27] three parts of that divine judgment it
[52:30] was a perfect judgment upon Babylon amen
[52:34] okay now let's go to the New Testament
[52:36] there's God's dealing with the church
[52:38] Peter saw the sheet vision three times
[52:41] in Acts chapter 10 to confirm that the
[52:45] Gentiles were admitted into the faith
[52:48] and not only did it prove that but it
[52:52] also proved that we're allowed to eat
[52:53] bacon now I mean no program said the
[52:56] bacon and eggs some people might think
[52:59] well oh no that was that that vision of
[53:01] those animals was just to show that the
[53:03] Gentiles were going to be saved brother
[53:04] Graham said no he said Peter Graham said
[53:08] Peter was all self-styled I thought ah
[53:10] my diets too strict I could never eat
[53:12] that well then brother Graham said my
[53:14] wife made bacon and eggs and the
[53:16] vegetarian walked up and said brother
[53:17] Branham he said you can think a lot more
[53:19] of you before I heard that you ate bacon
[53:20] and eggs and brother Graham said don't
[53:23] you know it's all clean he said don't
[53:24] you know God made all clean because the
[53:26] Bible said every creature of God is to
[53:28] be accepted with Thanksgiving and the
[53:31] prayer and the Word of God will sanctify
[53:33] any food now we know science has proven
[53:37] yeah you know if you eat too many shrimp
[53:39] shrimp or bottom-feeders and they may
[53:40] have some no pigs we eat anything so
[53:43] you've got to be careful not to eat too
[53:44] much pork or too much shrimp or some of
[53:47] these foods you got to be careful not to
[53:48] go overboard on that would just be
[53:50] wisdom but as long as it's received with
[53:53] Thanksgiving and you pray over that food
[53:55] God promised to cleanse that they did
[53:57] win so just so you know he saw it three
[54:00] times God said rise kill eat no Lord
[54:02] rightly no look nicely another and then
[54:05] he sent him off to cornea and then he
[54:06] sent him off to Cornelius house divine
[54:08] perfection
[54:09] you have three witnesses okay there's a
[54:14] threefold nature of temptation that God
[54:17] always allows a way out of so God will
[54:19] give you a lot a way out of the lust of
[54:20] the eyes the lust of the flesh and the
[54:23] pride of life he always promises the way
[54:26] out of all those three so in dealing
[54:28] with us that's a perfect way he'll give
[54:30] us a way out of all three of those
[54:31] temptations and now this
[54:38] three groups of believers all out in a
[54:40] Christian Abraham Isaac Jacob they never
[54:43] want anybody else there's always three
[54:45] Peter James John was this Elijah Jesus
[54:49] on Mount Transfiguration there's three
[54:51] there three back here Peter James John
[54:53] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when Moses
[54:56] his arms were held up you had Moses
[54:58] Aaron and her so there's three groups
[55:02] there's groups of three all the time
[55:03] there's three steps to reconciliation
[55:06] with your brother right go to them
[55:08] privately take one person with you bring
[55:10] it before the church so in dealing with
[55:12] us God has a perfect way to wrestle us
[55:17] is those three steps Jesus asked three
[55:20] times Peter if you love me because Peter
[55:23] denied him three times
[55:24] so reconciliation also on this case had
[55:28] three steps to it so Jesus is he since
[55:32] Peter 2:9 three times Jesus humbled
[55:34] Peter and he asked him three times if he
[55:37] loved him now here's a revelation that
[55:41] brother Adam preached with the seed
[55:42] should not be heir with the shuk in 1965
[55:45] where the RAM said there was three seeds
[55:49] of the women so just like there was
[55:50] three men that went down to Sodom and
[55:52] Gomorrah there was three seeds that were
[55:54] given to women the first one was Hagar
[55:59] remember Hagar and she brought forth
[56:01] seed by unbelief through polygamy with
[56:05] the bondwoman okay so she that seed came
[56:09] my unbelief through polygamy who knows
[56:12] the second one Sarah Sarah was not my
[56:16] unbelief Sarah was by faith in a promise
[56:19] but it was through a natural union with
[56:21] a free woman so not a mad woman
[56:22] so God's showing us how there's three
[56:24] seeds right there's three ways to
[56:26] receive see unbelief through polygamy
[56:29] with a slave the next one is by faith
[56:32] through a promise with a free woman
[56:35] so it gets a little better it was the
[56:37] last one closed Mary Mary so Mary
[56:43] received by promise word with no Union
[56:46] brother no teaches that and seed should
[56:50] not be here with a shuck
[56:51] so remember each scene gets better right
[56:53] Hagar unbelief say I promise but still
[56:57] through natural act now the last one
[56:59] marry by promise word no natural Union
[57:02] all by the Word of God amen
[57:05] I thought you like that by God's grace
[57:06] that's a good one okay I'm telling us
[57:08] that okay there's now there's divine
[57:12] perfection and salvation for mankind
[57:14] almost the four just say not what's the
[57:16] right Tony there's a lot of threes this
[57:17] says and there's probably tons more in
[57:21] Salvation God has three works of grace
[57:23] justification sanctification and the
[57:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:27] such a new spirit and my spirits so
[57:31] there's three stages Ezekiel foretold
[57:33] the earth for foretold this stages pull
[57:37] up the flood the blood of Christ and the
[57:40] future fire to cleanse the earth and we
[57:44] already covered the three stages the
[57:45] promised land with Israel and the life
[57:48] of Abraham supports out of this as well
[57:50] the first stage was leaving home the
[57:54] second stage was all the steps in
[57:56] between are all the tests in between the
[57:58] third stage was the token of
[58:00] circumcision the token right the token
[58:02] is the baptism of Holy Ghost
[58:04] so Abraham's life was a perfect divine
[58:07] perfection example of the three works of
[58:09] grace and I believe Ruth was - if I'm
[58:11] not mistaken right
[58:12] Ruth deciding Ruth laboring Ruth rest
[58:16] and that's it yeah and then brother
[58:19] answer there's actually a fourth Ruth
[58:20] rewarded with the baby but the baby so
[58:24] that may go into the next number four
[58:27] maybe deliver it through my city we'll
[58:29] see
[58:29] so there's Ruth there as well assigning
[58:32] baby bring resting okay there's three
[58:38] stages for the rapture shall boys trunk
[58:40] there's three gifts for believers Faith
[58:43] Hope charity with the greatest being
[58:45] charity well the RAM said the bride was
[58:48] restored in three stages Luther Wesley
[58:50] Branham the bride restored in three
[58:53] stages and there's three divine
[58:58] witnesses for the vine perfection in
[59:00] prayer and this is a good one we can
[59:02] apply to our lives as well
[59:03] Jesus played prayed three times for what
[59:06] you guys remember and the gardening is
[59:08] seventy paid three prayed three times to
[59:11] let the cup pass
[59:14] she didn't pray once you didn't praise
[59:16] he played three times because it was a
[59:18] divine perfect witness of Prayer and I
[59:22] think that will help us in our lives if
[59:24] we don't hear back from God on this
[59:26] request maybe we should ask again and
[59:28] maybe ask again keep asking and then
[59:32] remember Paul asked three times for the
[59:35] buffeting demon the messenger from Satan
[59:37] to leave him and finally God answered on
[59:39] the third time and said my grace is
[59:41] sufficient for you and weakness and this
[59:44] was done to keep you humble okay so
[59:47] those are all the many many slides and
[59:49] the threes now Satan imitate threes
[59:52] right I found I found at least three in
[59:54] the scripture I'm sorry least for the
[59:57] woman who put three measures of meal and
[59:59] leaven the love the love which the Bible
[1:00:03] says eleven is sin that was the Roman
[1:00:05] Catholic Church putting in maybe the
[1:00:07] Father Son Holy Ghost or one of those
[1:00:09] threefold blasphemies the three unclean
[1:00:11] spirits of frogs that could have been
[1:00:13] one of those also the beast in
[1:00:16] Revelation 13 blasphemes the God three
[1:00:20] times blackstein's his name
[1:00:21] I changed at the Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:00:23] Tabernacle by saying Rome is eternal
[1:00:26] city and third he blasphemes up in Hemet
[1:00:34] church ages the spirit of organization
[1:00:36] has three stages the deeds and doctrines
[1:00:39] of the Nicolaitans the doctrine of
[1:00:41] balaam and then Jezebel religion there's
[1:00:44] three stages of the organizational
[1:00:46] spirit and this is a new one I've never
[1:00:49] seen before but in Jude there's only one
[1:00:53] chapter Jude that there's three examples
[1:00:56] of apostasy the way of Cain which he
[1:00:59] just got upset right he just got upset
[1:01:01] and he don't want to Humble himself and
[1:01:02] worship like his brother
[1:01:04] there's the heir of Balaam for money
[1:01:07] that was money and the gainsaying of
[1:01:10] korah was for power
[1:01:12] see what he said oh we're all holy like
[1:01:14] you Moses and Aaron we're all holy it
[1:01:16] was surely a we can all sacrifice a new
[1:01:18] incense and new the things you do but
[1:01:21] that was complete apostasy that was a
[1:01:24] divine witness of complete apostasy
[1:01:28] so not worshiping your worship money and
[1:01:32] then popularity okay all right
[1:01:39] deep breath in every ready are we ready
[1:01:41] for number four how am i doing on time
[1:01:43] okay let me set my timer
[1:01:45] we'll go 30 more minutes by God's grace
[1:01:47] appreciate ready bearing with me here
[1:01:49] tonight sold it
[1:01:50] maybe I should like walk but then they
[1:01:51] can't see me well may I can see me yeah
[1:01:53] she move around already can see me
[1:01:56] gotta keep like a regular service you
[1:01:58] know kinda get the blood moving okay for
[1:02:02] I've found that for has at least three
[1:02:04] meanings I was looking for a fourth
[1:02:07] it means deliverance brother Graham said
[1:02:09] road ramp said it means double
[1:02:12] confirmation and then the Prophet said
[1:02:15] it means earthly number it's a number
[1:02:17] that applies to the earth so I'm sure
[1:02:20] you've got everything of some like nor
[1:02:21] saw these with we'll get to that so
[1:02:24] let's start with double confirmation I
[1:02:26] can only find one that was a double
[1:02:28] confirmation but you know there could be
[1:02:30] more the Prophet said yes to is a
[1:02:34] confirmation but for is a double
[1:02:37] confirmation so for is a double
[1:02:39] confirmation so a double proof a double
[1:02:42] vindication that God is doing something
[1:02:45] so the only one I could find that was a
[1:02:48] double confirmation was there's four
[1:02:51] elements to God's love breath length
[1:02:54] depth and height I'm sorry there's go me
[1:02:58] or me criticize my watch so God's love
[1:03:03] has four parts to it it means a double
[1:03:06] confirmation God loves us so much he
[1:03:09] loves us so much he gave us four
[1:03:11] measurements to it and we preach on that
[1:03:14] last you remember the four parts we
[1:03:15] looked at how high is his love he
[1:03:18] separates our sins as far as the East is
[1:03:20] from the West how deep is love I can't
[1:03:23] remember the other one
[1:03:24] but there was four priests in last year
[1:03:27] so God gives us a double confirmation
[1:03:30] there are four elements to his love and
[1:03:34] so deep there's four
[1:03:36] okay the next is the earthly number
[1:03:39] brother Graham says Austin is that
[1:03:44] church tonight and I guess you guys
[1:03:46] didn't have service tonight
[1:03:47] ah like a debt you're the e-text in and
[1:03:51] jump that flooded and I didn't know you
[1:03:53] wanted to come tell him I'm very sorry
[1:03:56] just like a demo just like the devil my
[1:04:02] goodness
[1:04:02] I was wondering why that happened why
[1:04:07] didn't that water break and that pipe
[1:04:09] drink of all times that's okay I'm sorry
[1:04:16] damn it okay so the problem talks about
[1:04:22] the four beasts the four living
[1:04:24] creatures and he talks about the four
[1:04:27] Gospels four is an earthly number so
[1:04:30] let's go for let's go through some
[1:04:31] earthy numbers for the forest on the
[1:04:35] fourth day of creation should open up
[1:04:37] before put it before on the fourth day
[1:04:39] mare we went through day one day two day
[1:04:41] three on day four the earthly and
[1:04:44] heavenly material was finished day four
[1:04:47] was the Sun the Moon the Stars so see on
[1:04:51] day four is force our earthly number all
[1:04:53] the earth materials are finished because
[1:04:56] on five six five and six you have all
[1:04:59] the animals and humans on day five and
[1:05:00] six but all the earthy materials and all
[1:05:03] the heavenly materials finished on day
[1:05:05] four is four is our earth day number
[1:05:08] okay there's four Great elements
[1:05:09] according to II W bullen's right and I
[1:05:11] didn't know this but there's earth on
[1:05:13] the dirt air water fire so that's what
[1:05:17] he says
[1:05:19] how many directions are there children
[1:05:21] or saw these fights there's four
[1:05:24] directions did you know there's
[1:05:27] or divisions of the day the Bible says
[1:05:29] this in mark 13:35 let's read that mark
[1:05:32] 13:35 you can tell he tossed him to come
[1:05:41] over the house you could you tell me I
[1:05:50] don't know if you will be good invited
[1:05:52] you okay so there's four parts of the
[1:05:58] day this is in mark 13:35 five sorry
[1:06:01] he said watch you therefore for you know
[1:06:04] that when the master of the house cometh
[1:06:05] at even or midnight or the crowing
[1:06:10] or the morning so crowing has to be
[1:06:12] 6 a.m. right that's what they chicken
[1:06:15] roosters crow morning lists must be 9:00
[1:06:18] a.m. even I must be 9:00 p.m. moment
[1:06:31] [Music]
[1:06:33] whatever I must have that wrong yeah
[1:06:39] it's freaking out to rework that one I
[1:06:40] don't remember that one but Jesus says
[1:06:42] there's four parts of the day so forgive
[1:06:44] me I'd have to rework them I thought I
[1:06:46] had it been in them that's not right
[1:06:48] well I know this there's more night
[1:06:50] watches so that's mark Matthew 1425 my
[1:06:53] marina I'm Matthew 14 25 I know this one
[1:06:56] for sure
[1:06:59] and in the fourth watch of the night
[1:07:02] Jesus went on to them walking on the sea
[1:07:05] so that would have been the 6:00 6:00
[1:07:08] a.m. I'm not mistaken so 6:00 p.m.
[1:07:11] number three hours right 6 p.m. 9 p.m.
[1:07:15] midnight and 3:00 in what century yeah
[1:07:18] we had because six day it would have
[1:07:20] been the beginning of the morning and
[1:07:21] then the first 20 more okay so 3 a.m. in
[1:07:24] the morning they're still sailing on the
[1:07:26] sea and here comes Jesus so night is
[1:07:29] divided in four parts just like day is
[1:07:31] divided in four parts as well course
[1:07:39] yeah I'd be great
[1:07:41] I'll be great if we could see Austin in
[1:07:43] half an hour that'd be awesome
[1:07:44] praise the Lord oh you met Austin okay
[1:07:47] he came to our church from out of the
[1:07:48] years was about a year and we baptized
[1:07:54] and then Lord Jesus and then guessing
[1:07:56] short lives and fell away and I wants to
[1:07:58] come back so and these girls have been
[1:08:00] trained calling out his name every
[1:08:03] single sort of Oh beautiful most
[1:08:06] glorious that thank you very much
[1:08:10] no the author said that the moon has
[1:08:18] four phases in that room have you heard
[1:08:20] of that I'm I can't remember I know
[1:08:22] there's waxing and waning and pressing I
[1:08:25] can't recall them but I think if Jeff
[1:08:27] slip it up but he says the moon has four
[1:08:29] phases and we know how many seasons are
[1:08:32] there or seasons there's four seasons so
[1:08:36] four is always an earthly numbers
[1:08:39] make sure okay so four is the four
[1:08:47] seasons
[1:08:48] all right now four deals with your
[1:08:54] earthly or the earthly relationships
[1:08:55] with God as well as the earthly number
[1:08:57] how do we know how many grounds there
[1:08:59] are that Jesus said the heart the word
[1:09:01] follows line all kinds the wayside where
[1:09:05] there is a sight Stoney's a second
[1:09:08] thorny right choking no care cares the
[1:09:12] world choke the Word of God and the
[1:09:14] fourth is good ground good ground so
[1:09:17] there's four there's in other words
[1:09:18] there's for earthly conditions your
[1:09:19] heart can be according to Jesus and
[1:09:23] there's four kinds of vessels so
[1:09:25] everybody is one of these kinds of
[1:09:26] essence here they're a gold vessel
[1:09:28] silver wood or earth like a dirt vessel
[1:09:35] well the RAM said there was for cross as
[1:09:38] a Calvary Jesus Saves thief the lost
[1:09:42] leaf and Judas or costs revelation 20:2
[1:09:47] 11 says there's four conditions you'll
[1:09:49] be in at the rapture holy or righteous
[1:09:52] filthy or unjust those are four
[1:09:55] conditions on the earth everyone will be
[1:09:57] in just like those four conditions of
[1:09:59] the heart of the four types of ground
[1:10:03] and then remember there's four cherubims
[1:10:06] that guard the mercy seat but those
[1:10:09] anointings were sent down to earth lion
[1:10:12] ox man flying eagle or those pointing
[1:10:18] those four beasts represent before
[1:10:19] anointings that come down here to the
[1:10:21] earth and we know also God gave us four
[1:10:24] Gospels on the earth Matthew Mark Luke
[1:10:27] and John amen now the last one is
[1:10:33] earthly prayer has four parts to it
[1:10:37] right prty prays repent asking you just
[1:10:41] like in the Old Testament the incense
[1:10:45] had four parts to it I can't pronounce
[1:10:46] the first three but I know frankincense
[1:10:48] is the last one I can't pronounce them
[1:10:50] because
[1:10:51] difficult words I've never even read
[1:10:53] them before or been able to pronounce
[1:10:55] and so earthly prayer has four parts to
[1:10:58] it just like incense has four
[1:11:01] ingredients
[1:11:02] we're almost done actually my god Zuri
[1:11:05] so what the beater will be her
[1:11:07] linearized grace emotions they say did
[1:11:11] he say he would come producible ready
[1:11:14] men I was drawing very answered amen
[1:11:17] oh yeah some Devils I gotta get these
[1:11:23] Devils not gonna get the victory right
[1:11:24] even though the church but Eviscerator
[1:11:26] going on Church is still going on the
[1:11:29] single not gonna thank you
[1:11:30] the program tells us and the last one is
[1:11:33] deliverance for represents deliverance
[1:11:35] and this is in Revelation chapter 4 part
[1:11:39] 3 in 1961 he said see deliverance there
[1:11:42] was three Hebrew children a fiery
[1:11:43] furnace but the fourth one come it was
[1:11:46] deliverance Lazarus was in the grade
[1:11:48] three days when the fourth one come he
[1:11:50] was delivered or is God's number of
[1:11:52] deliverance okay now I thought this one
[1:11:57] might work here I hope this works
[1:11:59] did you know you have four stages to
[1:12:02] your full manifestation to your fully
[1:12:04] delivered your first stage was a thought
[1:12:08] in the mind of God the second stage you
[1:12:11] became flesh that's where we're at right
[1:12:13] now if you die before the rapture the
[1:12:15] third stage as you go to theophany right
[1:12:18] your last stage is a glorified body so
[1:12:21] see your deliverer you're fully
[1:12:23] delivered going through these four
[1:12:24] stages to flash the opportunity
[1:12:34] glorified program said the peasant Jesus
[1:12:37] was different Jesus went from thought to
[1:12:39] logos which was that light the pillar
[1:12:41] fire then he came to flesh and any
[1:12:45] course he went back to theater of the
[1:12:47] logos to preach the spirits in prison
[1:12:48] but then when he resurrected he got the
[1:12:50] glorified body so he had through four
[1:12:53] different parts to his full
[1:12:54] manifestation really delivered fully
[1:12:58] fully manifest see all right let's wear
[1:13:02] this one sort of Romans chapter 5 let's
[1:13:04] read this
[1:13:04] you're my Luger yes we have time Romans
[1:13:11] five verse three and this is you know
[1:13:25] this is a good scripture for everyone
[1:13:28] but especially those who may bound
[1:13:29] depression or or suicidal thoughts you
[1:13:33] know I've talked to numerous people that
[1:13:35] battle those types of things and the
[1:13:37] trouble is ultimately they give up hope
[1:13:40] and I was thinking I was meditating on
[1:13:43] this one day and the thought just came -
[1:13:44] no I felt it was from the Lord you know
[1:13:46] suicide is is the net the actual event
[1:13:49] you know it's sinful of course but it's
[1:13:52] actually a perversion of what we're
[1:13:54] supposed to do everyday right we're
[1:13:57] supposed to die to ourself all said I
[1:14:00] die daily so see Satan has perverted
[1:14:05] that and he wants to us to end our
[1:14:07] natural life but God doesn't want us to
[1:14:09] end our natural life God wants to end
[1:14:11] help us and our will everyday the will
[1:14:15] for our earthly life God wants the God
[1:14:18] wants us to slay that because the Bible
[1:14:20] said we were slaughtered all the day
[1:14:21] long
[1:14:22] so not just do we die once I'm sure you
[1:14:25] know brother we got to die all the time
[1:14:26] you know we'll be going good for a while
[1:14:27] and then it worked we got a dino
[1:14:29] ourselves there and we get hold of you
[1:14:31] got to die to ourselves at home to keep
[1:14:33] overcoming that devil keep crucifying
[1:14:35] the lust of the flesh but this scripture
[1:14:38] says there's four phases to actually
[1:14:42] achieving true spiritual hope from God
[1:14:45] so the hair do we read verses 3 and 4
[1:14:50] and not only so but we glory in
[1:14:53] tribulations also knowing that
[1:14:55] tribulation worketh patience and
[1:14:58] patience experience and experience hope
[1:15:01] amen now have you read verse 19
[1:15:04] I'll try gonna are you and hope maketh
[1:15:07] not ashamed because the love of God is
[1:15:09] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:15:11] Ghost which is given to us amen now this
[1:15:15] is something that we I hope we can all
[1:15:16] see in our lives
[1:15:18] if we're in the midst of tribulation we
[1:15:21] have to remember oh this is just the
[1:15:23] first stage there's better stages after
[1:15:26] this I'm really going through a hard
[1:15:27] time this is really difficult seems
[1:15:30] really trying to defeat me we must
[1:15:33] remember if we can just make it through
[1:15:35] that stage God will give us patience we
[1:15:39] can't give up on them in the midst of
[1:15:41] the hardest battle I want to end my life
[1:15:43] or I just want to quit being a Christian
[1:15:44] I'll quit going to church at all we just
[1:15:46] got to keep pressing through there and
[1:15:48] go the next step was oh and I got
[1:15:50] patience now I can wait on God then if
[1:15:53] you if you can if you can gain patience
[1:15:55] then God will give you an experience
[1:15:57] right and then if you can receive God's
[1:16:00] experiments experience then you are
[1:16:02] delivered now you have hope you haven't
[1:16:05] lost hope you haven't lost a desire to
[1:16:07] live you have a loss of desire to serve
[1:16:09] Lord God has through four stages he's
[1:16:11] giving you a supernatural hope by God's
[1:16:14] grace amen that's a great deliverance
[1:16:17] that we all can benefit from praise the
[1:16:18] Lord isn't that beautiful
[1:16:24] so hope that's an encouragement tonight
[1:16:27] I have a couple more things
[1:16:29] singing imitates number four now I'm not
[1:16:32] knowing number four I only got like
[1:16:33] halfway done with the chapter I'm
[1:16:34] already to that chapter yet there were
[1:16:37] other chapters before that Saint
[1:16:39] imitates pours because we all know how
[1:16:41] many horse riders are they white is the
[1:16:43] section where the air near these Rover
[1:16:45] red was bloody red black was capturing
[1:16:48] the wealth of the world in the Dark Ages
[1:16:49] and then pale with a spiritual death all
[1:16:52] those three combined into the fourth and
[1:16:56] let's go to James chapter one there's
[1:16:57] four stages temptation James chapter one
[1:17:01] and church this is to me this is why the
[1:17:06] seals are so powerful because it doesn't
[1:17:09] really matter you know that people can
[1:17:12] memorize the four horses that's good to
[1:17:16] know that but we have to recognize how
[1:17:19] those horses want to ride in our lives
[1:17:22] today and that is the true power of the
[1:17:25] Holy Spirit and the seal is being loose
[1:17:27] now you can recognize Satan and now you
[1:17:30] can overcome Satan that every
[1:17:31] one of his tricks because he's trying to
[1:17:33] ride into your life in the form of these
[1:17:36] horses okay so James chapter one and I
[1:17:43] believe it's verse thirteen so there's
[1:17:53] four stages to temptation verse 13 let
[1:17:56] no man say when he is tempted I'm
[1:17:58] tempted of a God for God cannot be
[1:18:01] tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[1:18:03] any man here it is verse 14 but every
[1:18:06] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[1:18:08] his own lust and enticed so the first
[1:18:13] stage is enticed right and we all know
[1:18:16] what that's like
[1:18:16] oh I feel that temptation I'm starting
[1:18:18] to feel it some days you can walk right
[1:18:20] past it no it don't even faze you right
[1:18:22] there's certain thing like I was telling
[1:18:24] you different addictions I've had some
[1:18:25] days I can just walk right past it when
[1:18:32] we're gonna battle and we're gonna feed
[1:18:34] Tyson that actually would feel pretty
[1:18:36] good or that actually would sound pretty
[1:18:37] good or that might that might taste
[1:18:40] pretty good
[1:18:40] or whatever whatever the look let's have
[1:18:43] patience so enticing is the first step
[1:18:47] Malka verse fifteen minute this Jude was
[1:18:51] our James 150 then when lust hath
[1:18:53] conceived reinforce in and said okay so
[1:18:58] lust I'm sorry so enticement lust
[1:19:02] enticed and then C so seized is when
[1:19:06] it's got you so that's when you've given
[1:19:08] over in your mind see you know we can
[1:19:10] have feelings like all that might feel
[1:19:12] pretty good but once we decide it now
[1:19:14] now sin has seized you right that spirit
[1:19:18] you let that spirit in okay but then
[1:19:22] that like with David that still doesn't
[1:19:24] mean you've actually committed the sin
[1:19:25] right let's let's think of David when he
[1:19:26] took Bathsheba he was enticed by looking
[1:19:29] out right watching her watching her baby
[1:19:33] he was seized we said go get Bathsheba
[1:19:36] he was seized but he was gonna act upon
[1:19:38] but he had done to act yet when he did
[1:19:42] the act now he'd sinned
[1:19:44] and then what happened death of that
[1:19:46] child that came out of that okay I guess
[1:19:48] you're right - okay so can every see the
[1:19:54] four steps of temptation that's the
[1:19:56] power of the seven seals that's why all
[1:19:59] haven't shouted that he meant because
[1:20:00] now you and I can recognize oh I'm being
[1:20:03] enticed you gotta cast that down or its
[1:20:05] season you okay I've really got a cast
[1:20:07] that down because I feel like I'm gonna
[1:20:09] do it or if I've actually sinned I've
[1:20:13] got it I got to confess and say I'm
[1:20:14] wrong or if its death course you can't
[1:20:17] go past spiritual death you know because
[1:20:20] I would mean your spiritual death that
[1:20:21] would mean you cross the line between
[1:20:22] mercy and judgment so Christian we never
[1:20:24] go there but that's the power of the
[1:20:26] seals is that you can see the enticing
[1:20:29] the seizing I'm going to do it the
[1:20:31] actual act and then death something
[1:20:34] awful happens at the end okay
[1:20:37] now let's close with this how many can
[1:20:43] see how these numbers apply to your life
[1:20:46] especially prayer like we got to have a
[1:20:49] complete prayer again we just don't want
[1:20:51] to just praise praise praise you also
[1:20:53] repent you can praise all day if we're
[1:20:56] not forgiven and we have we have
[1:20:58] something that will hinder our walk with
[1:21:00] God so prayer so we want we want to
[1:21:04] remember we can clearly apply this to
[1:21:06] our life
[1:21:06] make sure prayer has these four steps
[1:21:08] also pray three times or pray multiple
[1:21:12] times how many times we pray about
[1:21:13] Austin way more than right with that
[1:21:17] that encourages us let's have some
[1:21:19] repetition let's bring that before God
[1:21:21] let's keep the faith remember because
[1:21:23] Jesus said the woman who really believes
[1:21:24] is gonna keep that come right she keep
[1:21:27] knocking until the unjust judge gives
[1:21:29] her what she has Nita all right the
[1:21:35] worship the holy holy holy so that can
[1:21:37] encourage us worship say Amen again say
[1:21:39] praise the Lord again when we're in
[1:21:41] Jeffersonville for the air and we walk
[1:21:43] out of different places he say let's say
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:48] and he said let's say it again
[1:21:50] praise the Lord there's repetition
[1:21:52] repetition is something God loves holy
[1:21:55] holy holy you know all this all this
[1:21:57] worship he loves it he loves repetition
[1:22:00] of prayers now we got to make sure we
[1:22:03] balance that right because Jesus said
[1:22:04] they just repeat yourself just to be
[1:22:06] heard or just to make your hair longer
[1:22:09] than somebody else God doesn't hear that
[1:22:11] but it's when you come sincerely Lord
[1:22:13] can you take this burden off me Lord can
[1:22:16] you help me overcome this temptation can
[1:22:18] you take this on me
[1:22:19] when you do it like that God receives it
[1:22:21] alright
[1:22:24] also you should see your face should
[1:22:28] rise when you see God working in an
[1:22:29] orderly way like if you're in
[1:22:31] justification at all I'm saying praise I
[1:22:33] know where I'm going right our face your
[1:22:35] eyes okay now I know what I need to do I
[1:22:37] need to get sanctified and then all I'm
[1:22:39] saying goodbye I know I know what's next
[1:22:41] the baptism of Holy Ghost so it should
[1:22:43] encourage our faith day God and taking
[1:22:45] on a journey on Sunday I'm on a journey
[1:22:48] and my ramps on the church age book we
[1:22:50] can always know wherever we are in the
[1:22:51] journey at anytime
[1:22:53] right we're right we can look at those
[1:22:55] three stages we can look at the Statue
[1:22:57] program and we can see where we are at
[1:22:59] any time so these numbers are very
[1:23:00] crucial because they give us God's plans
[1:23:03] that give us God's wrong maps okay I
[1:23:08] want to see if there's a couple more
[1:23:10] scriptures also here's one let's go to
[1:23:13] Psalm 143 then maybe we'll sing hymn
[1:23:17] praying to our brother good serving
[1:23:18] that'd be great if he walks in and we're
[1:23:19] singing or she's in the Lord
[1:23:25] he's a tender heart of man you know he's
[1:23:29] young guy thing is what 2021 no bombs
[1:23:41] 143 verse 5 and
[1:23:51] this again goes with numbers and God's
[1:23:54] earth his creation they are doing to
[1:24:01] read verse 5 143 verse 9 I remember the
[1:24:06] days of old
[1:24:07] I meditate on all thy works I'm use on
[1:24:10] the works the work of by hands Amen muse
[1:24:14] you remember means to meditate Condor or
[1:24:17] study so you look at God's works you
[1:24:20] look at the four directions you know you
[1:24:21] look at all these all the fours you know
[1:24:24] we didn't get to it but there's four
[1:24:26] corners of the earth there's four win
[1:24:34] Wow nature has length you know nature
[1:24:37] has length width height and all these
[1:24:39] all these numbers God's love has four
[1:24:41] elements to it we're supposed to
[1:24:43] meditate on these and then if we do that
[1:24:45] let you can read verse six we'll do this
[1:24:53] hey men when you see God's order when
[1:24:57] you see oh there's four kinds of grounds
[1:24:58] I'm one of those which one am I Lord let
[1:25:01] me have a good ground our hands go up
[1:25:03] yes Lord give me a Jesus that it's a
[1:25:05] good honest heart where there's no cares
[1:25:08] of the world I'm not after money or or
[1:25:10] popularity or evil relationships I'm not
[1:25:13] after any of that my heart is pure and
[1:25:16] when we meditate on these things and we
[1:25:18] can see the poor ground so we can see
[1:25:19] all these things it makes us worship God
[1:25:21] say holy holy holy Lord all my praise
[1:25:26] the Lord
[1:25:27] well I think I'll stop there there's
[1:25:32] some other ones I want to get to you but
[1:25:33] let's stand our feet here I just have a
[1:25:37] word of Prayer maybe you give us
[1:25:47] commands here
