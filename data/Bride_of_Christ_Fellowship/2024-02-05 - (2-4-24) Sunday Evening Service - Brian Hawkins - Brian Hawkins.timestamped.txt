[3:21] amen
[3:23] amen welcome to service one more
[3:26] time and uh
[3:31] if you would uh I that's kind of been of
[3:35] the the song that we've really enjoyed
[3:37] uh singing around our house lately is is
[3:40] uh
[3:45] gratitude do you know there's a lot of
[3:47] people that walk
[3:48] through and they're not grateful for a
[3:51] whole
[3:52] lot know but we're a people that we know
[3:55] we've been brought from we've been uh
[3:57] called from a life of sin unto a life of
[4:03] righteousness the things that we used to
[4:05] do we do them no more am so we have a
[4:08] lot to be grateful for we could be
[4:11] sitting in a in a hospital bed with
[4:16] whatever we could be in a crack house we
[4:20] could be in a bar we could
[4:23] be anywhere other than here but we just
[4:27] want to thank the Lord that we are are
[4:29] privileged people to be here this
[4:33] evening and where is here akan Ohio no
[4:38] not aan Ohio but in the presence of the
[4:41] Lord amen
[4:43] amen and you know with worship and
[4:46] praise and singing songs to him and
[4:48] giving him honor you're in the presence
[4:51] of the Lord because when we were talking
[4:53] this morning about demonology when you
[4:55] talk about demons when you talk about
[4:58] Witchcraft and that's like the whole
[5:00] conversation of it when you're talking
[5:02] about evil spirits you're inviting
[5:04] that's why I don't like talking about
[5:06] the subject because you are inviting
[5:08] those spirits but when you talk about
[5:11] God you are inviting the presence of God
[5:15] Amen so what do we want our conversation
[5:18] to be about God Amen and about all the
[5:22] good things if there's anything oh I
[5:24] can't even think of the scripture now
[5:26] I'm I'm terrible with this stuff I I
[5:27] don't have that great memory but all
[5:30] things that are uh pure all things that
[5:32] are holy uh and and you know what
[5:35] scripture I'm talking about but meditate
[5:37] upon these things all uh those that
[5:39] those things that are good those things
[5:41] that are holy those are the things that
[5:43] we want to fill our mind with
[5:45] amen uh so if you would turn with me to
[5:49] uh Second
[5:50] Timothy Chapter 2 and I apologize to my
[5:54] family but they're going to hear this
[5:56] again because we just spoke on this last
[5:59] last week but uh I I pray that it's a
[6:04] blessing to you I I I like this subject
[6:07] I hope you like it too so second Timothy
[6:10] starting in uh the first
[6:14] verse it says Thou therefore excuse me
[6:17] uh we'll turn to 1 Timothy 1 and18 uh
[6:22] after so first verse it says Thou
[6:24] therefore my son be strong in the grace
[6:28] that is in Christ Jesus
[6:30] and the things that thou Hast heard of
[6:31] me among many witnesses the same commit
[6:34] thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able
[6:36] to teach others
[6:39] also thou therefore endure hardness as a
[6:42] good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that
[6:46] worth entangleth himself with the
[6:48] Affairs of this life that he may please
[6:51] him who hath chosen him to be a
[6:54] soldier and in 1
[6:57] Timothy uh 1:8
[7:02] 18 it says this charge I commit unto
[7:05] thee son Timothy according to the
[7:07] prophecies which went before on thee
[7:10] that thou by them mightest War a good
[7:13] Warfare holding faith and a good
[7:17] conscience which some having put away
[7:19] concerning Faith have made a
[7:22] shipwreck so in verse 18 it says this
[7:24] charge I commit unto thee son Timothy
[7:26] according to the prophecies which went
[7:28] before on thee that thou by them
[7:31] mightest War a good Warfare or you could
[7:33] say you may strongly engage in
[7:37] battle and verse 19 holding faith and a
[7:40] good conscience which some having put
[7:42] away concerning Faith have made a
[7:44] shipwreck for some have rejected these
[7:47] and they have suffered shipwreck of
[7:50] their
[7:51] faith this is what we're facing in this
[7:53] day you may be
[7:54] seated uh this is what we're facing and
[7:57] and also in this day is we're we're
[8:01] enduring we're we're faced with so many
[8:03] struggles we're faced with with an
[8:05] adversary which is a worthy adversary
[8:07] right because he's he's not some like we
[8:09] were talking this morning you're not
[8:10] going to be able to uh uh deceive the
[8:14] the adversary because he already knows
[8:16] so you can't you can't Bluff him you
[8:18] either have the Holy Spirit or you don't
[8:20] you know you've either got the goods or
[8:22] you don't have the goods right and he's
[8:24] going to know if you have the goods or
[8:25] not because uh uh taking the New
[8:28] Testament when they were trying to uh
[8:30] cast out devils and and the evil spirits
[8:32] were saying Paul I know Jesus I know but
[8:35] who are you so you're not going to be
[8:38] able to Bluff the enemy even though this
[8:40] is our Warfare so it behooves us to know
[8:44] what our enemy is and what enemy that
[8:46] we're we're fighting what we're engaged
[8:48] with and not giving into the enemy but
[8:50] overcoming the enemy amen
[8:53] so this this is we're we're we're pretty
[8:56] much going through these same type of of
[8:58] of things things that uh Timothy was
[9:01] talking
[9:02] about the book of Timothy Paul was
[9:04] telling Timothy to be prepared because
[9:07] you're going to have to fight you're
[9:08] going to have to engage in a mighty
[9:11] battle it's not just a a small little uh
[9:15] uh uh playground little fight little
[9:18] spat but this is a life and death battle
[9:22] amen spiritually spiritual versus carnal
[9:25] it is it it's a it's a battle that we
[9:27] are engaged in and what I like to speak
[9:29] on today is weapons of our
[9:32] Warfare
[9:34] worship worship is my weapon amen amen
[9:39] praise the Lord so if you would turn
[9:40] with me to John chapter 4 and I'm just
[9:43] going to read through some things
[9:45] and just kind of lay a foundation a
[9:47] little bit here and and by God's grace
[9:51] we'll get into something
[9:55] good if it's a word it's always good
[9:58] right so John chapter 4 and verse
[10:03] 21 we all like to worship
[10:06] right so Jesus saith unto Heroman
[10:09] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[10:11] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[10:14] Jerusalem worship the father ye worship
[10:18] ye know not what we know what we worship
[10:21] for salvation is of the Jews see he's
[10:24] telling this woman that you know the
[10:26] Samaritans and you know she has the
[10:28] expectation she she was looking for a
[10:30] messiah but they went through service
[10:33] through service through service but yet
[10:35] they didn't really know what they were
[10:37] worshiping but here Jesus is coming
[10:40] saying we know what we worship because
[10:43] we're it's of the Jews right we know the
[10:45] God we know the father of what we're
[10:47] worshiping because this is what we grew
[10:49] up on this is what we grew up knowing
[10:52] right so and we want to teach others as
[10:54] as well so ye worship you know not what
[10:58] how great it is is and what a privilege
[10:59] it is that we know what we worship amen
[11:02] we know the reason why we
[11:05] worship it's not just to hear the sound
[11:07] of our voice but is to give God praise
[11:10] amen amen to tell him that we love him
[11:12] to tell him to to have that sweet
[11:14] communion with our Lord amen so uh you
[11:19] worship you know not what we know what
[11:21] we worship for salvation is of the Jews
[11:24] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[11:27] true worshippers how many true
[11:29] worshippers do we have but when the true
[11:31] worshippers shall worship the father in
[11:34] spirit and in truth for the father
[11:36] seeketh such to worship him see he's
[11:38] looking for that kind of a person he's
[11:40] looking for that kind of a Believer to
[11:43] worship
[11:44] him not worshiping something else but to
[11:47] worship him he's looking through the
[11:50] Earth who's going to worship me
[11:55] Amen in verse 24 it says God is a spirit
[11:59] we know that right God is a spirit and
[12:03] they that worship Him must worship Him
[12:05] in spirit and in
[12:09] truth oh my in Luke Chapter
[12:15] 4:8 Jesus Is Telling Satan here because
[12:17] Satan's trying to tempt him trying to
[12:19] get him you know if if you if you accept
[12:22] all these things I I'll give you all
[12:24] these things only if you just Bow Down
[12:26] and Worship me that was only that was
[12:28] just a small price uh just give up on
[12:31] your beliefs just a little bit just give
[12:33] in a little bit just so you can get this
[12:35] one small pleasure this one small thing
[12:38] that you've been Desiring forget
[12:40] everything that you've lived for for the
[12:42] past however many years that you've been
[12:43] a Believer just give in that one little
[12:47] bit but Jesus says get thee behind me
[12:50] Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[12:53] Worship the Lord thy God in him only in
[12:57] him only shalt thou serve
[12:59] Ser so what is
[13:03] worship worship is a the reverent love
[13:07] and Devotion accorded to a deity an idol
[13:11] or a sacred object whether you've got a
[13:14] a totem pole or some some staff or some
[13:17] uh whatever it is craft that that people
[13:21] make out of a rock or piece of wood uh
[13:23] whatever it is that's what they
[13:27] worship
[13:29] because they have some kind of a a love
[13:32] and feel a feeling of devotion toward
[13:35] that item that's what they worship right
[13:37] some people have sports that they
[13:39] worship some people have uh other things
[13:42] uh movies movie stars celebrities these
[13:45] are also known as Idols because uh
[13:48] that's what people worship see then then
[13:51] you have uh uh the ceremonies of prayers
[13:54] or other religious forms by which uh
[13:57] this love is expressed which is what
[13:58] what we're doing here we are expressing
[14:00] our love unto our Lord in the form of
[14:03] worship in a form of religious
[14:06] worship uh it's also an Ardent
[14:09] admiration or love an adoration such as
[14:13] the worship of
[14:15] celebrities uh it also means as in a
[14:18] verb sense it means to honor and to love
[14:21] as a
[14:22] deity to feel an adoring reverence or
[14:25] adoring esteem or
[14:27] devotion to bow or give obeisance to uh
[14:31] to fall prostrate in reverence or
[14:33] Adoration of a deity person or thing so
[14:37] when we fall prostrate what does
[14:38] prostrate mean it means that we fall on
[14:41] our face we give ourselves over unto the
[14:44] Lord we put our face to the Earth from
[14:46] when from where we came from we show no
[14:48] Pride but we show humility to show that
[14:51] he is greater than us right and that's
[14:54] what worship is it's it's showing an
[14:57] admiration for some something that we
[14:59] feel is greater than
[15:01] us I'm sorry but celebrities are not
[15:04] greater than my Lord celebrities are not
[15:06] greater than I am they're just a person
[15:09] just just like I am and to me even if
[15:13] Chuck Norris walked into the door I
[15:15] would greet him just like I would
[15:16] anybody else hey I've seen a few of your
[15:19] movies you know Years Years Gone past or
[15:21] whatever hey it's nice to meet you but
[15:24] I'm not going to fall down and and
[15:26] worship him just because he's a
[15:28] celebrity
[15:29] yeah he's probably got millions of
[15:30] dollars so be it good for him right
[15:34] so I'm not going to be envious of him
[15:37] you know he's just a person just like I
[15:40] am right uh so we don't give uh that
[15:46] kind of an adoration to a man but we
[15:49] save that adoration for our husband for
[15:52] our Lord so praise as opposed to worship
[15:56] it it's synonymous I I don't want to say
[15:58] as as opposed to to worship but it is
[16:00] synonymous but praise differs uh from
[16:03] worship that worship is an action and
[16:07] praise is words right so when you give
[16:11] children praise you're saying good job
[16:13] or somebody at work you know hey good
[16:15] job uh something like that hey that was
[16:18] a great idea you know we were really
[16:19] successful from that you know that's
[16:21] giving somebody praise uh so praise is
[16:25] an offering of of words of hom homage as
[16:28] an act of worship such as when we sing
[16:31] uh songs of
[16:33] praise uh and in Psalms 22 starting in
[16:38] the third verse it says but Thou Art
[16:39] holy oh thou that inhabit us the Praises
[16:43] of Israel you know we we uh if if you
[16:46] look I looked this up a little while
[16:49] back and and people were saying well
[16:50] that's not what the scripture means
[16:52] that's not uh it means something
[16:53] completely different you won't find
[16:55] because people that's one thing that we
[16:57] say a lot is uh the Lord inhabits the
[16:59] Praises of his people and there're why
[17:01] you can't find that in scripture well
[17:02] this is pretty much what it where it
[17:06] is but Thou Art holy oh thou that
[17:08] inhabit us the Praises of Israel see God
[17:11] inhabits the praise of his people see
[17:14] when we give him praise when we talk
[17:16] about him when we have conversation with
[17:18] him he's we're showing him that he's
[17:20] important in our lives
[17:23] amen and then and in verse four that it
[17:26] says our fathers trusted in thee they
[17:28] trusted and thou did deliver them they
[17:30] Cried unto thee and were delivered they
[17:32] trusted in thee and were not confounded
[17:35] see the fathers they trusted in the
[17:38] Lord they Cried unto him and they
[17:41] trusted him and they gave him
[17:44] worship so Hebrews 13- 15 it says by him
[17:47] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[17:50] praise to God continually that is the
[17:52] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[17:55] name see it says to give it uh to to
[17:58] give the sacrifice of of praise to God
[18:01] continually it's a continual thank you
[18:03] Lord Praise Your Name Lord hallelujah
[18:06] which is which is known to be the
[18:08] highest highest form of Praise right
[18:09] giving God a hallelujah hallelujah is is
[18:12] is is like the highest form right I
[18:13] don't know what else we could say but in
[18:16] men's words and men's terms that's all
[18:18] we know that's that's that's like the
[18:20] best thing that we could give him even
[18:22] though he's worthy of having more
[18:24] something better that's all we can
[18:26] comprehend to give him
[18:33] we know worship is a weapon okay well
[18:36] we're we're getting there but you'll
[18:37] find out worship is a
[18:42] weapon but you know what our greatest
[18:44] weapon is as a
[18:46] Believer prayer prayer is our great
[18:49] greatest weapon Right add the season of
[18:52] worship and the season of praise and
[18:54] faith is our Victory
[18:57] amen so so what is a weapon if we're
[19:00] going to worship and use it as a weapon
[19:02] what is a weapon so a weapon is an
[19:06] instrument of attack or defense and
[19:08] combat as a gun missile or sword or
[19:13] nunchuck staff whatever it is whatever
[19:15] you're used to uh whatever you could use
[19:18] as a weapon
[19:19] right and I I gave this illustration
[19:22] last
[19:23] week you know even if you think that
[19:25] you're the simple as a Christian and you
[19:27] think that you can't get anything oh I'm
[19:31] just a little believer I only have a
[19:32] little bit of understanding but you know
[19:34] a little bit of understanding goes a
[19:35] long way because uh and like us I was
[19:40] telling everybody last week you know I
[19:42] tried to go into the Social Security
[19:43] office this was a few years ago and I
[19:46] had a multi-tool on me you know which is
[19:47] pliers a screwdriver yeah it's got a
[19:49] knife blade on it and you know different
[19:51] things like that but he said whoa whoa
[19:54] whoa you can't go into the Social
[19:55] Security office with that you know
[19:56] that's a weapon like what do you mean to
[19:58] me that's a
[19:59] tool see and a and a knife to me is a
[20:02] tool I've never used a knife as a weapon
[20:04] I don't know if anybody else has used a
[20:06] knife as a weapon I have never used a
[20:08] knife as a weapon I've always used a
[20:10] knife as a tool right so I guess it's
[20:12] all on the perception of the the
[20:15] possibility of what could be of what
[20:17] could happen you know they go to Great
[20:19] Lengths to figure uh the worst case
[20:21] scenario right
[20:23] so if you have a knife yep you could you
[20:25] could hurt somebody but if I carry a
[20:27] straw
[20:29] from sweet tea from Wendy's I can't I
[20:32] can't help but think of brother Diggs uh
[20:35] every time I think about a straw and I
[20:36] talk about it sweet tea from
[20:40] Wendy's but everybody would think that a
[20:42] straw would be so innocent
[20:44] right would theyd probably let me have a
[20:47] whole shirt pocket full of straws and a
[20:50] straw could be very dangerous and you're
[20:52] probably think how in the world is a
[20:53] straw going to be dangerous well take a
[20:56] if you get a potato you hold the potato
[20:59] you take a
[21:00] straw you wouldn't think that a straw
[21:02] would go through it but it's strong
[21:03] enough to go through
[21:05] it and the things that you could do with
[21:07] a straw to somebody you could use a pen
[21:09] or a pencil or something else like that
[21:11] you give me something I'll use it as a
[21:13] weapon car keys whatever it is a spoon I
[21:18] don't care you'd be able to use
[21:19] something as a weapon what about a couch
[21:22] pillow don't go so far
[21:26] okay I combat sleep with a couch
[21:30] pillow I'll Attack it hard
[21:34] no but you you get the point that even
[21:37] even with even the weakest of Christians
[21:39] can can shake hell even just a an
[21:42] innocent looking straw can cause havoc
[21:45] on on a person now I'm not trying to I'm
[21:47] not trying to uh say go use weapons
[21:50] against people that's not what I'm
[21:51] saying because a weapon is used for
[21:53] offense and defense right so so zoology
[21:59] uh as a weapon can you think of uh
[22:02] different animals that that have weapons
[22:04] or on on on their bodies uh it's a a
[22:08] part or an organ such as a claw or a
[22:11] stinger used by an animal and attack or
[22:15] defense and we we read through the
[22:17] scripture that Satan was
[22:19] disarmed because the last thing to
[22:21] defeat was death oh death where is thy
[22:24] sting and oh grave where is thy Victory
[22:27] see he was he was rent harmless because
[22:31] now he is uh he has no weapon to use
[22:33] against us amen because that weapon his
[22:35] greatest weapon has been defeated on
[22:37] Calvary amen so you also have uh a
[22:42] weapon a means used to defend against or
[22:46] defeat another talking about logic logic
[22:48] was used as a weapon but what're we're
[22:50] talking here this this afternoon about
[22:52] uh worship being our weapon bear with me
[22:55] a few more minutes okay uh and then and
[22:57] then we'll get into uh something
[23:00] here uh 2 Corinthians chap 10:
[23:05] 3-6 should be very familiar scripture to
[23:08] every Bible
[23:15] reader excuse
[23:19] me getting ready to turn
[23:22] 49 still learning how to
[23:26] drink sorry wrong
[23:31] tube adversar is trying to use a bottle
[23:33] of water against
[23:35] me verse three it says for though we
[23:38] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[23:41] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[23:44] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[23:46] the pulling down of
[23:48] strongholds or Solomon would put it
[23:51] wisdom is better than weapons of
[23:54] war wisdom is better than weapons of war
[24:00] verse five he says casting down
[24:02] imaginations and every High thing that
[24:04] exalteth
[24:06] itself to exalt means to glorify praise
[24:09] and honor casting down imaginations in
[24:11] every High thing that exalteth itself
[24:14] against the knowledge of God and
[24:15] bringing into captivity every thought to
[24:18] The Obedience of Christ every thought
[24:21] that goes through your mind you can't
[24:22] help the kind of thoughts that come into
[24:24] your mind but you can help them get out
[24:27] if they don't
[24:28] belong you can say get out of here you
[24:31] can't help the the thoughts that come
[24:32] into your mind but you can keep it from
[24:34] building a nest
[24:36] right so we want to cast down those
[24:38] imaginations or anything that exalts
[24:40] itself higher than
[24:43] God verse six and having in a Readiness
[24:47] to Revenge all
[24:49] Disobedience when your obedience is
[24:52] fulfilled how many people want
[24:56] revenge how do you go to get get revenge
[24:58] you're going
[24:59] to take some weapon and sneak into
[25:01] somebody's house who did you wrong and
[25:03] and take care of him no we're not going
[25:05] to do that way right because the weapons
[25:07] of our Warfare are not
[25:10] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[25:13] pulling down of stronghold so if we have
[25:15] that sense of Revenge be obedient to God
[25:18] because he said vengeance is mine right
[25:21] so if we give it over to him the
[25:23] battle's not ours if we give it to him
[25:25] he will Revenge he will avenge us of all
[25:28] of our enemies amen
[25:31] so if you're wanting to have Revenge
[25:33] don't have malice about it have love
[25:35] about it and having in a Readiness to
[25:38] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[25:40] obedience is
[25:42] fulfilled and in second Peter chapter 1
[25:47] verse5 it says and beside this giving
[25:49] all diligence to add to your faith
[25:51] virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to
[25:54] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[25:56] patience and to patience godliness and
[25:59] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[26:01] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[26:04] things be in
[26:05] you and not just sitting in there
[26:07] dormant but if these things be in you
[26:10] and
[26:12] abound putting these things into
[26:15] practice to where these things abound in
[26:18] your
[26:20] life for if these things be in you and
[26:22] abound they make you that ye shall
[26:25] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[26:27] the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[26:30] Christ but he that lackthe things is
[26:33] blind and cannot see a far off and ha
[26:36] forgotten that he was purged from his
[26:37] old sins but we remember that we were
[26:40] purged amen we don't we're not we have
[26:42] no lacking of that because we remember
[26:45] what the Lord has done for us amen so
[26:47] verse 10 it says wherefore the rather
[26:50] Brethren give diligence to make your
[26:52] calling and election
[26:54] sure for if you do these things ye shall
[26:57] never
[26:59] fall your obedience is
[27:03] fulfilled when you have patience or when
[27:05] you have faith virtue knowledge
[27:06] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[27:08] kindness up to
[27:11] charity and we wonder what well how
[27:13] could I be more obedient to God through
[27:16] these things if we have these things and
[27:18] they abound in our lives we shall never
[27:21] fall we shall suffer through every
[27:24] Temptation that will come our way we
[27:25] shall suffer through or we shall be
[27:27] Victorious through every trial every
[27:29] tribulation because our God goes and
[27:31] fights for us amen when we entrust him
[27:34] with it all
[27:37] amen and and one more here uh well
[27:40] there's there's more but uh and then
[27:44] we'll get into the other stuff so
[27:45] Ephesians uh chapter 6 verse 10 how many
[27:49] was thinking this when we started this
[27:52] scripture you can't go without talking
[27:54] about
[27:55] this we talked about the offensive
[27:58] weapon now we're going to talk a little
[27:59] bit about the the defensive weapon so
[28:01] finally my brethren be strong in the
[28:03] Lord and the and in the power of His
[28:05] might put on the whole armor of God that
[28:08] you may be able to stand against the Ws
[28:10] of the devil and there are a lot of
[28:12] tricks that he tries to pull on us
[28:15] right in verse 12 for we wrestle not
[28:18] against flesh and blood no matter how
[28:20] much you like you uh uh
[28:23] MMA you know how much of those things
[28:26] but we wrestle not against flesh and
[28:28] blood that is not our Warfare in this
[28:30] day not to say that we can't defend
[28:32] ourselves our homes our loved ones our
[28:34] our Goods that we have right but our
[28:37] major war that we are uh going to engage
[28:40] in a mighty battle it's through it's
[28:43] it's through the spirituality spiritual
[28:45] versus carnal for we wrestle not against
[28:47] flesh and blood but against
[28:49] principalities against Powers against
[28:52] the rulers of the darkness of this of
[28:53] this world and against spiritual
[28:55] wickedness in high places we were
[28:57] talking this morning about how how the
[29:00] the kings of the Nations and how the the
[29:02] merchants were were so corrupt because
[29:05] they they they uh dined with it they
[29:08] they were part of it a part of the
[29:11] corruption and that's what we're
[29:12] fighting against is the corruption
[29:14] whether no matter where it is but you uh
[29:17] everywhere you look there there's
[29:19] corruption just about everywhere in
[29:21] churches in a place of of work hopefully
[29:24] not in this church I don't think it's in
[29:25] this church but you understand what I
[29:26] mean and uh in some Churches there's
[29:29] just corruption because they're so
[29:31] political and they want to keep the word
[29:32] of God from the people well just come
[29:35] and sing songs of worship and that'll be
[29:36] good that'll be it not hearing the word
[29:38] of God what kind of worship service is
[29:41] that you're worshiping something else
[29:43] yeah it might sound
[29:45] good singing singing gospel songs but
[29:48] that's not going to save you Clapping
[29:50] Your Hands to a gospel tune isn't going
[29:51] to save you playing a guitar playing a
[29:53] piano playing drums to a gospel song
[29:56] isn't going to save you
[30:02] praise the Lord verse 13 wherefore take
[30:04] unto you the whole armor of God that you
[30:06] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[30:09] and having done all to stand and we are
[30:11] in a wicked and adulterous generation
[30:13] are we
[30:14] not so stand therefore having your Lo
[30:17] your loins GED about with truth don't
[30:20] compromise on Truth for those that
[30:23] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[30:25] and in truth so we can't compromise
[30:27] there having your loins GED about with
[30:29] the truth having on the breastplate of
[30:31] righteousness protecting your heart
[30:34] protecting your vital organs so you
[30:37] maintain
[30:41] vitality and your feet shod with the
[30:43] preparation of the of the gospel of
[30:46] peace above all taking the shield of
[30:48] Faith wherewith you shall be able to
[30:50] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[30:53] amen because you're going to get
[30:54] buffeted and then after you're buffeted
[30:56] guess what you're going to be buffeted
[30:58] again and then after that second
[31:00] buffeting what's going to happen you're
[31:01] going to get buffeted again it's an
[31:03] endless cycle it seems until the day
[31:05] that we go
[31:07] home but that's just what we're ordained
[31:09] to that's just the way it's going to
[31:11] be so we must stand strong as a good
[31:15] soldier of Jesus Christ
[31:17] amen verse 17 it says and take the
[31:20] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[31:23] spirit which is the word of God the
[31:25] helmet of salvation protecting yourself
[31:28] from from uh keeping yourself from mind
[31:30] battles because a lot of our mind
[31:32] battles happen because the the uh our
[31:35] eyes are the gate to our soul when we
[31:37] look at things we see things happening
[31:39] things come in and then you have mind
[31:40] battles
[31:41] right
[31:43] so you have to uh watch and protect what
[31:47] not only what we're taking in through
[31:48] our eyes but what our children are W
[31:51] watching looking at amen so we need to
[31:54] be good examples cuz they're looking at
[31:56] us
[31:58] right children are looking at parents
[32:02] siblings other family members
[32:04] [Music]
[32:06] friends they're looking at all kinds of
[32:08] influences so we must have the hel the
[32:11] helmet of salvation to protect ourselves
[32:13] from those mind battles amen and the
[32:15] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[32:17] God praying always with all prayer and
[32:20] supplication in the spirit and watching
[32:21] there unto with all perseverance and
[32:24] supplication for All Saints
[32:27] and for me that utterance may be given
[32:29] unto me that I may open my mouth boldly
[32:32] to make known the The Mystery of the
[32:34] Gospel see it's not an easy thing
[32:37] sometimes because how many times do you
[32:39] desire that you want to say something
[32:41] somewhere and then you present her with
[32:42] a situation and there's all these people
[32:45] that you uh uh that you there might be
[32:47] several people around that well if I say
[32:49] something uh they might not talk to me
[32:51] anymore they're going to think that I'm
[32:53] weird but see this is where holding the
[32:55] mystery of Faith amen and proclaiming it
[32:58] uh boldly speaking it boldly amen The
[33:01] Mystery of the Gospel not being ashamed
[33:03] not being afraid not being afraid of
[33:06] your
[33:07] convictions but being able to stand
[33:10] boldly with your convictions not
[33:13] compromising for which I am an
[33:15] ambassador in bonds that therein I may
[33:18] speak boldly as I ought to speak amen we
[33:22] doing okay
[33:25] today
[33:29] okay if you would turn with me to 2
[33:31] Chronicles chapter
[33:32] 20 starting in the first
[33:43] verse I know everybody's tired
[33:46] especially after eating a meal and then
[33:48] you come to evening service
[33:50] and hurry
[33:55] up you love the Lord
[33:57] amen somebody give God
[34:01] praise 2 Chronicles chapter
[34:04] 20 I said starting in the first verse
[34:07] didn't
[34:09] I I'm not there I've only got a part of
[34:12] it in
[34:14] here might help if the preacher is
[34:25] there sorry bear with me
[34:30] chapter 20 verse
[34:32] 1 it says it came to pass after this
[34:34] also that the children of Moab and the
[34:37] children of of Ammon and with them uh
[34:39] other beside the ammonites came against
[34:41] Jehoshaphat to battle Then There came
[34:44] some that told Jehoshaphat saying there
[34:46] cometh a great multitude against thee
[34:47] from Beyond the Sea on the side Syria on
[34:50] on this side Syria and behold they be in
[34:53] hazaz on Tamar which is
[34:55] inti
[34:57] and Jehoshaphat feared and set set
[35:00] himself to seek the Lord and proclaimed
[35:02] a fast throughout all
[35:06] Judah he heard of trouble coming and
[35:08] what did he do he sought God first right
[35:11] he set his mind to seek the Lord and
[35:14] Judah gathered themselves together to
[35:17] ask help of the Lord even out of all the
[35:19] cities of Judah they came to seek the
[35:21] Lord they didn't go to some other entity
[35:24] they didn't go to some other de deity
[35:26] they didn't didn't go see Buddha they
[35:28] didn't go see uh Muhammad they didn't go
[35:30] see anything else but they sought the
[35:33] Lord and then the king just didn't keep
[35:35] it to himself he says hey we want we
[35:38] need some help here so I'm proclaiming a
[35:40] fast you know if if the Devils could do
[35:42] it when when somebody's casting out
[35:44] Devils when a minister is casting out
[35:46] Devils or a Believer I should
[35:48] say what happens when when that demon is
[35:51] about to come out it knows that it's
[35:54] going to be defeated it is calling for
[35:55] help to another demon so they can't be
[35:59] defeated so why can't a Believer do the
[36:01] same thing hey I need some help over
[36:04] here
[36:08] amen verse
[36:10] five and Jehoshaphat stood in the
[36:13] congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in
[36:15] the house of the Lord before the new
[36:16] court and said oh Lord God of our
[36:20] fathers art art not thou God in heaven
[36:23] and rulest not thou over all the
[36:25] kingdoms of of the heathen
[36:27] and in thine hand is there not power and
[36:29] might so that none is able to withstand
[36:34] thee kind of reminds me of the Lord's
[36:37] Prayer when we talk to the Lord you give
[36:39] him praise you talk to him you commune
[36:42] with
[36:44] him Our Father which art in heaven
[36:46] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[36:48] thy will be done talking to him it's not
[36:51] about you but you're talking to him
[36:53] you're making it about him right amen
[36:57] and then you go in and ask your
[37:01] supplication verse seven it says art not
[37:04] thou Our God who did drive out the
[37:06] inhabitants of this land before thy
[37:08] People Israel and gavest it to the Seed
[37:10] of Abraham thy friend
[37:17] forever verse eight and it says and they
[37:19] dwelt therein and have built thee a
[37:21] sanctuary therein therein for thy name
[37:24] saying if when evil cometh upon on us as
[37:27] the sword judgment or pestilence or
[37:29] famine we stand before this house and in
[37:32] thy presence for thy name is in this
[37:34] house and cry unto thee in our
[37:37] Affliction then thou will hear and
[37:41] help amen so when we when we he's a very
[37:44] an everpresent help in the time of
[37:46] trouble right amen so when we when we
[37:49] see ourselves when we recognize the
[37:52] spirit if a spirit's trying to inhibit
[37:54] us from getting closer to God we call
[37:57] out to the Lord that that shouldn't that
[38:00] that should be like our first
[38:03] response not call not calling the doctor
[38:06] not calling so and so not calling the
[38:08] pastor to see see what I should do about
[38:10] it but we should enter into prayer first
[38:14] thing that we call upon God for his
[38:17] help and then he could talk to somebody
[38:19] else use somebody to help us amen but we
[38:23] must make sure that he is
[38:25] first and this is what they're doing
[38:27] they're setting a great example for us
[38:30] Amen in verse 10 it says and now behold
[38:33] the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
[38:36] s whom thou wouldest not let Israel
[38:38] invade when they came out of the land of
[38:40] Egypt but they turned from them and
[38:42] destroyed them not behold I say how they
[38:45] reward
[38:46] us to come to cast us out of thy
[38:49] possession which thou has given us uh
[38:52] given us to
[38:54] inherit excuse me
[38:57] let's read that again behold I say how
[38:59] they reward us see they've given them
[39:02] peace because the Lord told them leave
[39:03] them alone and now behold I say how they
[39:07] reward us to come and to cast us out of
[39:09] thy
[39:10] possession see a lot of things we want
[39:12] to say well this is mine that's mine but
[39:15] it's the Lord that gave it to you see
[39:18] this is saying trying to uh uh cast us
[39:22] out of thy
[39:24] possession out of God's possession
[39:28] amen that was the first mistake is the
[39:30] enemy is trying to go against God
[39:34] right verse 12 scriptures are going
[39:37] through my mind right now I'm trying to
[39:38] stay
[39:39] focused Uh Oh Our God wil thou not judge
[39:43] them for we have no might against this
[39:45] great company that cometh against us
[39:48] neither know we what to do but our eyes
[39:50] are upon
[39:53] thee they openly confess I don't
[39:55] understand I I don't know what's going
[39:57] on but I know I can't defeat this
[39:59] enemy so calling out for the mightier
[40:02] than the mightiest amen verse 13 it says
[40:05] and all Judas stood before the Lord with
[40:07] their little ones their wives and their
[40:08] children the whole
[40:11] household not just the father not just
[40:14] the mother but the children also they
[40:16] probably took the dog and the cat and
[40:17] everything in the household
[40:19] amen the whole everybody in the
[40:24] house then upon jesel the son of
[40:27] Zechariah the son of beniah the son of J
[40:30] J the son of maniah a levite of the sons
[40:33] of Asaf came the spirit of the Lord in
[40:35] the midst of the congregation and he
[40:37] said hearken ye all Judah and ye
[40:40] inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King
[40:42] Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto
[40:45] you be Not Afraid nor dis nor dismayed
[40:48] by reason of this great multitude for
[40:50] the battle is not yours but God's amen
[40:54] so you shouldn't have anything to worry
[40:56] about let God handle it
[40:58] amen verse 16 tomorrow go ye down
[41:01] against them behold they come up uh

[41:06] and ye shall find them at the end of the
[41:07] brook before the Wilderness of Gerel ye
[41:10] shall not need to fight in this battle
[41:13] set yourselves and stand ye still and
[41:15] see the salvation of the Lord with you
[41:18] oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be
[41:22] dismayed don't get disheartened just
[41:24] because you're going through a trial

[41:27] you've gone through but be patient for a
[41:29] little bit longer
[41:30] amen fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow
[41:33] go out against them for the Lord will be
[41:36] with you amen Verse 18 and Jehoshaphat
[41:39] bowed his head with his face to the
[41:41] ground from when he came amen showing
[41:44] humility putting himself under the
[41:48] Lord and giving showing humility
[41:51] humility unto the Lord showing which one
[41:54] is greater
[41:57] before the Lord worshiping the Lord and
[42:00] the Levites of the children of the
[42:02] coites and of the children of the kites
[42:04] stood up to praise the Lord God of
[42:06] Israel with a loud voice on high see
[42:10] with a loud voice on
[42:12] high not just a little quiet praise the
[42:18] Lord with a shame afraid to speak praise

[42:38] day this is getting a little old I'm
[42:41] telling you what all these days we're
[42:44] not allowed to say anything we can't do
[42:45] anything and uh man what what's going to
[42:48] happen here I don't see anything happen
[42:49] and this and then just leaving before
[42:51] the before the salvation of the Lord
[42:53] happens you know because we get so
[42:55] impatient
[42:56] and then we feel that the Lord isn't
[42:58] working and then we take things upon
[43:00] ourselves and then we make a mess of it
[43:03] then well how did I get into this
[43:05] situation you weren't patient on God but
[43:08] what happened on the seventh day is in
[43:12] one mind one Accord One Voice one shout
[43:16] the walls of Jericho came falling down
[43:20] amen see that's what can happen when we
[43:22] are
[43:23] unified amen
[43:27] verse 20 it says' and they Rose early in
[43:30] the morning and went forth Into the
[43:31] Wilderness of tooa and as they went
[43:34] forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me
[43:37] oh Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem
[43:39] believe in the Lord your God so shall ye
[43:42] be established believe His prophets so
[43:45] shall ye Prosper see the word of the
[43:47] Lord comes to the prophet when the word
[43:49] comes forth you
[43:51] believe amen so he's saying and you
[43:54] believe His prophets what he has spoken
[43:57] unto you have faith in that because I
[44:00] the Lord have spoken through him
[44:02] amen and so shall you prosper and when
[44:04] he had consulted with the people he
[44:06] appointed singers unto the Lord and that
[44:09] should and that should praise the beauty
[44:11] of his Holiness as they went out before
[44:13] the Army and to say praise the Lord for
[44:15] his mercy endureth forever amen verse 22
[44:19] and when they began to sing and to
[44:21] praise the Lord s ambushments against
[44:23] the children of Ammon Moab and the mount
[44:25] s
[44:27] which were come against Judah and they
[44:29] were smitten see when it's when they
[44:31] begin to sing it's when they begin to
[44:33] praise it's when they begin to worship
[44:36] that's when the Lord went to
[44:38] work and became Victorious amen it
[44:41] wasn't the people that fought the Battle
[44:43] because see when we get into worship the
[44:46] spirit of worship our mind is focused on
[44:48] him it's no longer on our symptoms it's
[44:50] no longer on our
[44:52] problems and then we don't get in the
[44:54] way when we worship we just get
[44:57] ourselves out of the way so God can
[45:01] move and we're not hindering the
[45:03] Lord see when we worship we are setting
[45:07] ourselves
[45:08] aside getting out of his way so if we
[45:12] would just stop and let God move
[45:17] amen I like that and when they began to
[45:20] sing and to praise the Lord s
[45:23] ambushments uh that's when the battle
[45:26] began amen verse 23 for the children of
[45:30] Ammon excuse me at 23 did I say 33 verse
[45:33] 23 for the children of Ammon and Moab
[45:35] stood up against the inhabitants of
[45:37] Mount
[45:38] s utterly to slay and and Destroy them
[45:42] and when they had made an end of the
[45:43] inhabitants of s Everyone helped to
[45:46] destroy
[45:48] another see it shouldn't be that way in
[45:50] the Church of God a bunch Believers
[45:52] backbiting going against one another
[45:55] because this this is what happens this
[45:58] is what happens as you destroy one
[46:00] another see that's what the Lord did is
[46:02] he he put these these people at variance
[46:05] the the armies they put them at variance
[46:07] against against one another so they were
[46:09] fighting and and and and backbiting
[46:11] against one another and that's what took
[46:13] them down see A house divided against
[46:15] itself will bring itself down amen
[46:19] because they they wanted to call Jesus
[46:21] be elab
[46:23] right but there's one greater than be
[46:27] above verse 24 and when Judah came
[46:30] toward the Watchtower in the wilderness
[46:32] they looked unto the multitude and
[46:33] behold they were dead bodies Fallen to
[46:35] the Earth and none
[46:42] escaped verse 25 and when Jehoshaphat
[46:45] and his people came to take away the
[46:47] spoil of them they found among them in
[46:49] abundance both riches with dead bodies
[46:51] and precious jewels which they stripped
[46:53] off for themselves more than they could
[46:55] carry away and they were three days in
[46:58] gathering of the spoil it was so
[47:02] much I'm not talking about a Prosperity
[47:06] theology but when we give ourselves when
[47:08] we step aside and let the Lord have his
[47:12] way of how much he gives us a
[47:15] blessing he won't give you more more
[47:18] troubles more Temptations than what you
[47:19] can handle but he'll sure sure give you
[47:23] blessings more than what you can handle
[47:25] amen to where blessings will be
[47:26] overflowing three days in gathering the
[47:29] spoil amen that there was so much verse
[47:33] 26 and on the fourth day they assembled
[47:35] themselves in the valley of
[47:37] Baraka for there they blessed the Lord
[47:40] therefore the name of the same place was
[47:42] called the valley of Baraka which means
[47:45] blessing unto this day excuse me uh
[47:48] verse 27 then they returned every every
[47:51] man of Judah and Jerusalem and
[47:53] Jehoshaphat in the Forefront of them uh
[47:55] to go go again to Jerusalem with joy for
[47:58] the Lord had made them to Rejoice over
[48:01] their enemies and they came to Jerusalem
[48:03] with the suies and harps and trumpets
[48:05] unto the house of the Lord I'm sure
[48:07] there were some dancing going on because
[48:09] they had some victory
[48:11] amen they had the liberty of the of the
[48:14] spirit they had no more enemies to come
[48:16] against them they were
[48:18] free they didn't have anything else
[48:20] binding them amen they confess their
[48:23] sins they confess their faults so what
[48:25] else did they have nothing was there to
[48:27] bring them down and by golly they were
[48:29] singing praises unto God Amen see
[48:32] worship is a weapon when we set our
[48:34] minds to Worship the Lord goes and
[48:36] fights a battle for us amen that is our
[48:41] weapon praise the
[48:48] Lord but that's just pretty awesome
[48:50] right there through that whole story
[48:52] that the Lord just blessed them he said
[48:54] if you'll just let me do the work you
[48:57] just start singing you just start
[49:00] worshiping me I'll take care of the rest
[49:03] and then the blessings came to
[49:04] overflowing amen it's not a charismatic
[49:07] thing it's not a Pentecostal thing it's
[49:09] not a Baptist thing it's not a it's not
[49:11] a denominational thing whatever title
[49:13] people want to put on it it's not that
[49:15] kind of a thing amen it's a Bible thing
[49:18] it's a promise thing it's what the Lord
[49:20] has told us what he would do for us say
[49:23] I will worship him no matter what right
[49:27] I don't want to think of the worst
[49:28] scenario I don't want to go through that
[49:30] but I pray that I would stay right on
[49:31] with him amen just like job if if he
[49:34] took took everything from me like he did
[49:36] job I pray that I would just uh stay
[49:39] with him and not compromise on my faith
[49:41] just because the the riches that we have
[49:43] doesn't mean it's a blessing of God
[49:45] right uh whether we're rich or whether
[49:48] we're poor it doesn't mean that God is
[49:50] mad at you or happy with you right but
[49:53] what does please him oby obedience
[49:56] because Rebellion is as witchcraft right
[49:58] and we don't want to be a rebellious
[50:00] bride we don't want to be rebellious
[50:02] children but we want to be in his will
[50:05] we want to let him have his way right
[50:07] but there is a false worship like we
[50:09] spoke this morning Whenever there is a
[50:11] genuine there's going to be a a
[50:15] copycat so there was a false uh there is
[50:18] uh false worship which you know people
[50:20] that just come to church and well I did
[50:22] my duty on Sunday and won't show up
[50:25] wedes day they come one service a week H
[50:28] that's all I need to do is is go to
[50:30] service once a week you know any more
[50:32] than that that's just too much uh it it
[50:34] it'll become a common thing well if it
[50:36] becomes a common thing then something is
[50:38] wrong something is
[50:41] wrong let's say the the great enemies of
[50:44] our church of the church are the
[50:47] Heretics who will not wear the Yoke of
[50:49] obedience right the uh like it said in
[50:52] the scripture about the the Pharisees
[50:54] and the Sadducees where uh they would
[50:56] make broad the filteries and make
[50:57] doctrines of men and try and expect uh
[51:01] uh men to be obedient unto those things
[51:03] which it would be fine if you were if if
[51:05] it it there's nothing that says you
[51:07] can't go above and beyond what the word
[51:09] says to do right but don't go beneath
[51:13] the minimum standard so if there's
[51:14] anything extra sure why not but the
[51:17] problem came where it became a tradition
[51:19] to men and then uh they were expecting
[51:21] men to follow it when they wouldn't
[51:23] follow it themselves right that's where
[51:25] it comes to be a problem so it's the
[51:28] Heretics who won't wear the Yoke of true
[51:32] obedience see these are the ones that
[51:34] had the mark of the beast and will
[51:35] worship the Beast under the cloak of a
[51:37] believer of Christ but they have
[51:39] engrossed in idol
[51:44] worship Revelation
[51:47] 14-11 it says and the smoke of their
[51:49] torment ascendeth up forever and ever
[51:51] and they have no rest day nor
[51:54] night
[51:57] who worship the beast in His image and
[52:00] whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
[52:03] see we believe that Jesus Christ is our
[52:05] rest right the Sabbath day means rest
[52:06] and he is our Sabbath he is our rest but
[52:09] these people that worship the Beast
[52:10] those that give over they give
[52:12] themselves over unto the Beast they have
[52:14] no rest night or day so praise God that
[52:16] we have rest in this day
[52:18] amen so if you ever wonder well what
[52:20] could I be thankful for you could be
[52:22] thankful for rest night and day that you
[52:25] have a peace you ever see that I think
[52:28] it's a bumper sticker uh no Jesus uh no
[52:32] peace and o no Jesus if if you eliminate
[52:36] Jesus you have no peace but then it says
[52:38] no Jesus k n o w the knowledge of Jesus
[52:41] you know who Jesus is then you get to
[52:43] know you have knowledge of Peace you
[52:45] understand what peace is right so no
[52:47] Jesus no peace or no Jesus and know
[52:50] peace and have peace
[52:52] amen but see uh we we know the story
[52:55] when Jesus was born with uh uh King
[52:58] Herod when the wi wise men came to Herod
[53:00] and they said hey we saw the star in the
[53:02] east and we have come to worship him
[53:04] right so and they're explaining the
[53:05] whole thing of everything that was
[53:07] spoken of of Jesus to happen they said
[53:10] all these things are fulfilled here so
[53:12] we're here to worship uh we're here to
[53:14] worship the King right so and what did
[53:16] haris he got jealous he got envious what
[53:19] what do you mean another king I'm the
[53:21] only King people should be worshiping
[53:22] right uh the natural King I'm the
[53:25] highest in the land give me give me the
[53:28] props give give me the praise see that's
[53:31] that's what men uh typically want as
[53:33] they they try to steal praise from God
[53:35] just like King Nebuchadnezzar when he
[53:36] said did I not build this Kingdom
[53:39] myself not giving the Lord recognition
[53:42] for blessing him in his in his kingship
[53:45] right so what did Herod say to the to
[53:48] the wise men he said hey let me know
[53:50] where he is so that I may worship him
[53:52] too with something with a whole
[53:54] different
[53:55] agenda so I pray that none of us come to
[53:58] church with a different agenda other
[54:00] than you know wanting to come and
[54:02] worship and get something out of the
[54:04] Lord don't come we're not here to see
[54:06] what brother sisters wearing what kind
[54:08] of shoes they've got on their feet even
[54:10] though you got pretty nice shoes they're
[54:11] probably real comfortable but that's not
[54:13] why I came to church today to see what
[54:14] kind of we see what kind of sneakers
[54:16] you're
[54:17] wearing or kicks of what we used to
[54:19] call to see what kind of kicks you're
[54:22] sport we don't come for those things
[54:24] right right cuz if you came to see what
[54:27] kind of hairstyle I got you came for the
[54:29] wrong reason sorry you're sad going to
[54:31] be sadly disappointed right so we have
[54:34] we have those people that have false
[54:35] Worship in this day they come for the
[54:37] wrong
[54:38] reason and then you have those that come
[54:40] and worship and they don't know what
[54:42] they're
[54:43] worshiping amen see remember God is a
[54:46] jealous God he's not envious you know
[54:49] when when the scripture says you know
[54:51] God himself says that I a a jealous God
[54:56] people want to sayoh how can a how can a
[54:58] sinless God have this the the sinful
[55:01] nature of being jealous that's not what
[55:03] that means that that part of that's a
[55:05] whole another uh sermon by the way
[55:07] that's a whole another message is uh
[55:10] jealousy of God being a jealous God it
[55:13] means that he's zealous for you and he
[55:15] doesn't want to lose you so he's going
[55:16] to fight for you
[55:18] amen because you are his possession just
[55:22] like the levite we are his his portion
[55:26] he is our portion but we belong to him
[55:29] and and he'll not lose a one everyone
[55:31] that the father gave unto Jesus he will
[55:33] not lose one of them amen so but he is
[55:39] zealous for us and he doesn't share his
[55:41] glory with anybody else he doesn't want
[55:44] he doesn't want you to worship anything
[55:45] else he doesn't want you to worship
[55:47] anyone else but he wants to worship and
[55:49] he wants that all to himself right he
[55:52] doesn't share his glory with anybody he
[55:54] doesn't want us to worship football
[55:55] Stars basketball Stars whatever it is
[55:57] politicians musicians actors but you get
[56:00] the point he wants your worship he wants
[56:03] your worship he wants communion with
[56:06] you amen he doesn't want us to worship
[56:09] our
[56:11] problems we say my problem I don't
[56:14] worship my
[56:16] problems well you seem to give more
[56:18] attention to your problem than you do to
[56:20] God so if you're so focused on your
[56:23] problem and not talking to God about it
[56:25] then you're worshiping your
[56:27] problem oh I've got this issue I've got
[56:29] this isue and then everybody you see on
[56:31] the street oh hey got uh well was me I
[56:35] got this problem I got this problem I
[56:36] got that problem oh you can get over it
[56:38] you know through the power of the Lord
[56:40] you know we try to encourage people
[56:41] through the power of Christ you you oh
[56:43] yeah I believe that and then you tell oh
[56:45] I got this problem I got this problem
[56:47] how about confessing
[56:49] healing we were talking this this
[56:52] morning about having a vision of a well
[56:53] person and stepping into that that
[56:55] Vision part of that is positive speaking
[56:59] not talking about the problem but saying
[57:01] praise God I've got the victory what was
[57:04] that
[57:05] uh John Ryan I want to say he was he was
[57:08] blind and he went up for prayer and uh
[57:10] brother Brandon told him he says uh
[57:12] you're healed and then he went and then
[57:14] he couldn't see and then he went back to
[57:16] brother Brandon said hey you told me I
[57:18] was healed I'm still blind he says well
[57:21] you go you said you you said you
[57:23] believed right if you said you believe
[57:25] then you go confessing when you come up
[57:27] for prayer when you pray onto God you go
[57:29] confessing that you've received that
[57:31] thing no matter what comes no matter
[57:33] what goes no matter what your neighbor
[57:35] says well I still see you got those
[57:37] little bumps
[57:39] there I see you're not healed
[57:42] yet it doesn't matter what somebody else
[57:44] says it's got to be that Revelation to
[57:47] you and you say thank you Lord for the
[57:50] healing already I believe I'm going to
[57:52] have it I can I will I do believe I can
[57:58] I will I do believe if you say you have
[58:01] faith and then you don't show forth and
[58:03] you don't have a a confession of Faith
[58:05] then you don't have
[58:06] faith if you're always worshiping your
[58:09] problem oh I'm down in the dumps this is
[58:11] happening that's happening this is
[58:12] happening and sometimes I get into that
[58:14] R I'll be honest with you and you
[58:15] probably do too you know because things
[58:18] just seem not to go right for me all the
[58:20] time anybody else ever get tired of that
[58:22] man would you just leave me alone
[58:25] give me 10 minutes of rest would you
[58:27] just stop it you know you trip over your
[58:30] feet or something's in the way or this
[58:32] doesn't happen this breaks in your hands
[58:33] when you're just trying to put it you
[58:35] understand what I mean it's everyday
[58:36] life things just happen you know but
[58:38] we're not going to be focused on those
[58:40] things we're going to focus on the one
[58:42] that gives salvation
[58:46] amen see we give them we give our
[58:48] problems over to the problem solver the
[58:50] dissolver of Doubt
[58:53] amen
[58:55] well see when you cling to your problems
[58:57] you're just showing that you that you
[58:59] like that evil spirit being in
[59:02] there that you're petting that evil
[59:05] spirit and you're and you're living it's
[59:07] something that you want to keep
[59:09] there and if you keep it there you're
[59:11] going to be in the same condition and
[59:13] that devil has every right to have
[59:15] Mastery over you amen but it's until
[59:19] you're willing to give that up and give
[59:21] it over unto God that's when you get the
[59:23] freedom
[59:25] amen I was just talking about it last
[59:27] week I I I had this thought of of of of
[59:30] a message about the page folders anybody
[59:33] read a book uh they read books and then
[59:36] if you see some book readers they they
[59:39] fold the pages over I like that spot or
[59:42] you're either marking the spot that's
[59:43] where it left off or you're marking the
[59:44] spot oh man I really like that part of
[59:46] the story I want to go back to that see
[59:48] sometimes I think people Harbor that in
[59:50] their lives and uh their page folders
[59:52] because they want to go back to that so
[59:54] you're you're supposed to forsake all
[59:56] those things because you've deliver
[59:57] you've been delivered from it so we're
[59:59] not going to return to that anymore the
[1:00:01] only thing that you return to it for us
[1:00:02] say the Lord delivered me from that yes
[1:00:06] that's what we want to remember we don't
[1:00:08] want to go back and and give
[1:00:10] entertainment back to that same old evil
[1:00:12] spirit because when a when a man sorry
[1:00:14] this is uh uh when a man is delivered
[1:00:16] from an evil spirit it's swept and
[1:00:19] garnished what should we do fill it with
[1:00:21] righteousness fill it with the things of
[1:00:23] God because if not
[1:00:25] he'll come back with seven other Devils
[1:00:27] worse than he
[1:00:29] was so therefore we got to uh fill that
[1:00:33] void with righteousness with things of
[1:00:37] God
[1:00:38] Amen see worship it kills the Enemy
[1:00:41] Inside of us right that's our our our
[1:00:44] greatest uh enemy is
[1:00:47] ourselves uh when we give God praise we
[1:00:49] no longer focus on our symptoms our
[1:00:51] problems or our trials we are so focused
[1:00:53] on him that everything everything else
[1:00:55] Fades out when we give praise when we
[1:00:58] give God praise we step
[1:01:00] aside worship kills the enemy in front
[1:01:02] of us just as we read in the story in 2
[1:01:05] uh Chronicles uh chapter 20 of how when
[1:01:08] they started singing they started giving
[1:01:10] God worship and the Lord went and fought
[1:01:12] the Battle for them and defeated the
[1:01:13] enemy for them they didn't even have to
[1:01:15] fight all they had to do was stand still
[1:01:18] and watch the salvation of the Lord
[1:01:21] because they were giving God praise
[1:01:23] using worship as a weapon
[1:01:26] amen worship kills the enemy that binds
[1:01:28] us and everybody's familiar with the
[1:01:31] story of Paul and
[1:01:35] Silas acts 16 and verse
[1:01:41] 22 I probably won't be very much longer
[1:01:44] just a few more minutes bear with me
[1:01:46] okay are we doing okay praise God acts
[1:01:50] 16 and 22 it says and the multitude rose
[1:01:53] up together against them and and the
[1:01:54] magistrates ran off their clothes and
[1:01:56] commanded to beat them and when they had
[1:01:58] laid many stripes upon them they cast
[1:02:00] them into prison charging the Jailer to
[1:02:02] keep them safely see that might happen
[1:02:04] sometime in the in in this in our near
[1:02:07] future is that they're coming against
[1:02:09] Christianity so hard and it it's it's
[1:02:12] just in the starting stages here in the
[1:02:15] States but it's in other countries where
[1:02:18] pastors uh ministers are being beaten
[1:02:20] Believers not just not just pastors uh
[1:02:24] and min ministers uh but just Believers
[1:02:27] in general are are are being beaten and
[1:02:30] killed in other countries and then we we
[1:02:32] think that we have it hard we don't have
[1:02:34] it hard we have it pretty easy yet I I
[1:02:36] think what we deal with mostly are are
[1:02:38] are mind battles you know or or our
[1:02:41] friends we're just ashamed to say that
[1:02:43] we love the Lord Jesus for some reason
[1:02:45] or another if we're ashamed to say that
[1:02:46] we love the Lord Jesus to to what we
[1:02:48] call our friends our co-workers or
[1:02:50] something I wonder if we really do love
[1:02:52] the Lord Jesus because I'm not ashamed
[1:02:54] to tell people that I love my
[1:02:56] wife and if I'm not ashamed to tell them
[1:02:58] that I love my wife dearly then I
[1:03:00] shouldn't be ashamed to tell them that I
[1:03:02] love my Lord Jesus more than I love my
[1:03:04] wife amen and I don't well yeah that's
[1:03:08] where I was going with that is that
[1:03:09] we're going to be uh I don't know if
[1:03:12] it'll be uh in my lifetime I might be
[1:03:14] off this Earth by the time that that
[1:03:16] starts happening but uh it it's going to
[1:03:18] start happening where they're going to
[1:03:20] shut the doors of churches and they're
[1:03:21] probably going to start jailing us
[1:03:23] because we we have Services which they
[1:03:25] were trying to do during Co they were
[1:03:27] trying to arrest people oh you can't
[1:03:29] have Services why is it that they were
[1:03:31] just trying to shut churches down I have
[1:03:33] an
[1:03:35] idea because evil doesn't like good
[1:03:39] right evil is trying to eliminate
[1:03:41] good
[1:03:43] so uh verse 24 who having received such
[1:03:46] a charge thrust them into the inner
[1:03:48] prison and made their feet fast in the
[1:03:50] stalks and at midnight Paul and Silas
[1:03:52] prayed and sang Praises unto God and the
[1:03:54] prisoners heard them and suddenly there
[1:03:56] was a great earthquake so that the
[1:03:58] foundations of the prison were shaken
[1:03:59] and immediately all the doors were
[1:04:01] opened and everyone's bands were loosed
[1:04:04] and The Keeper of the prison awaking out
[1:04:05] of his sleep and seeing the prison doors
[1:04:07] open he drew out his sword and would
[1:04:09] have killed himself supposing that the
[1:04:11] prisoners had been fled but Paul cried
[1:04:13] with a loud voice saying do thyself no
[1:04:15] harm for we are all here so if y'all
[1:04:18] understand that scripture which uh uh
[1:04:20] I'm sure B Jesse's has has talked about
[1:04:22] it before uh this Jailer if if any of
[1:04:24] those inmates if any of those prisoners
[1:04:26] would have escaped then that man would
[1:04:28] have been killed because he is
[1:04:30] responsible for
[1:04:32] them so uh not that it's a great
[1:04:35] Revelation but I don't know maybe
[1:04:37] somebody didn't know that uh which it's
[1:04:40] self-explanatory in that but uh that's
[1:04:43] neither here nor there but the point is
[1:04:45] is Paul and Silas were in shackles they
[1:04:47] were beaten their clothes
[1:04:50] stripped put in
[1:04:52] shackles but yet they still maintain
[1:04:55] praise for God they still gave God gave
[1:04:59] God the praise
[1:05:03] amen the
[1:05:06] mus if the musicians want to come no
[1:05:09] that wasn't
[1:05:14] T but without him we are powerless right
[1:05:17] and we love to read that scripture that
[1:05:19] no weapon formed against the shall
[1:05:20] prosper and our enemies shall fall by
[1:05:22] our side talking about 10,000 right but
[1:05:25] we won't overcome anything without
[1:05:29] him because in the beginning was the
[1:05:31] word the word was with God and the word
[1:05:33] is God and the word became flesh and
[1:05:35] dwelt Among Us and through that and
[1:05:38] through the death on Calvary but through
[1:05:40] the raising up through the grave he has
[1:05:42] given us the same power
[1:05:47] amen but wisdom let me try to find that
[1:05:51] because I
[1:05:53] uh
[1:05:56] Solomon said something uh I can't
[1:05:58] remember what it is now for some when
[1:05:59] I'm in front of people I can't remember
[1:06:01] hardly
[1:06:02] anything oh believe it or not I don't
[1:06:05] like talking in front of
[1:06:07] people uh wisdom is better than weapons
[1:06:09] of
[1:06:13] war so Proverbs 16-32 it says he that is
[1:06:17] slow to anger is better than the mighty
[1:06:20] see people want to look under the strong
[1:06:23] people oh look at look at his muscles
[1:06:25] look how strong a man of Valor and all
[1:06:27] that blah blah blah but he that is slow
[1:06:29] to anger is better than the mighty see
[1:06:32] wisdom is better than weapons of
[1:06:34] war and he that ruleth his Spirit than
[1:06:38] he that taketh the
[1:06:40] city so if you could rule your spirit no
[1:06:43] matter how little you think you
[1:06:45] are you're
[1:06:48] mightier you're better than the mighty
[1:06:51] and he that ruleth his Spirit than he
[1:06:53] that taketh the City
[1:06:55] amen see we worship through your worry
[1:06:58] we worship through our fears we worship
[1:07:00] through our stress we worship through
[1:07:01] our exhaustion we worship uh our our
[1:07:04] worship breaks down walls worship draws
[1:07:06] Us near to the father worship reminds of
[1:07:08] as our reminds us of our reason for

[1:07:14] atmosphere amen worship red redirects
[1:07:18] our Focus what we focus on is what we
[1:07:20] feel in any given circumstance worship
[1:07:23] opens the door to peace when You Face an
[1:07:24] uncertain future amen worship makes the
[1:07:27] enemy scatter God instructed Jehoshaphat
[1:07:30] to put the worshippers out in front as
[1:07:32] they went into battle and to trust God
[1:07:33] to give the victory amen jehoshaphat's
[1:07:36] Victory began with
[1:07:37] worship our Victory will begin with
[1:07:42] worship Worship Is Our Testimony to the
[1:07:45] world that Paul and Silas had been
[1:07:46] beaten Chained and thrown into prison
[1:07:48] they had that testimony what we go
[1:07:50] through and what we're delivered from
[1:07:52] that is our testimony
[1:07:54] at midnight they worshiped God sent an
[1:07:56] earthquake Breaking Chains off every
[1:07:58] prisoner and opening the doors of all
[1:07:59] those inside the rest of the prisoners
[1:08:01] stayed because they were eyewitnesses to
[1:08:04] the suffering of these men who were
[1:08:05] still praising
[1:08:08] God second Timothy 4:18 and the Lord
[1:08:11] shall deliver me from every evil work
[1:08:13] and will preserve me unto his Heavenly
[1:08:15] Kingdom to whom be glory forever and
[1:08:17] ever amen and one more scripture just
[1:08:20] bear with me a couple more minutes

[1:08:32] the vines the labor of the olive shall
[1:08:34] fail and the fields shall yield no meat
[1:08:37] the flock shall be cut off from the fold
[1:08:40] and there shall be no herd in the
[1:08:42] Stalls sounds pretty gloomy right
[1:08:45] everything kind of taken away but verse
[1:08:48] 18 yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will
[1:08:53] Joy and the god of my salvation so it
[1:08:56] doesn't matter your circumstance you
