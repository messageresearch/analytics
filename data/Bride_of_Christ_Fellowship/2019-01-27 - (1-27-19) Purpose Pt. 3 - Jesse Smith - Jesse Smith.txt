and let you move Lord sometimes we know Lord we wait until you move us to move Lord God because we don't want to move we don't he'll do one thing unless we know it's thus saith the Lord your God that's what the bride is called to do she's called to say stand still until she has thus sayeth the Lord because then she knows what he wants done with the word we thank you for tonight thank you for

full armor of God tonight Lord we thank you for your presence father speak to us through thy word now we pray you break into your people of each one of us Lord God to receive it and we'll give you all the glory as we leave this place in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's take our Bibles here let's go to Isaiah chapter 14 verse 27 we'd like to start there I'm sorry verse 24 kind of an odd text I've never really read out of Isaiah before but I just kind of want to read a few scriptures so Isaiah 14:24 I like to look purpose again tonight this is part three a purpose it's been a few weeks since we looked at purpose I've been kind of looking at other topics of course you know like numerology and the book of Revelation I like to look at purpose again tonight by God's grace sister Brenna's good to see without the cane again praise the Lord and uh miss scooter there let's just thank the Lord for that praise God surely you're an example of standing still and letting God move so I just thought that was inspiring you're a real inspiration to a sister Brenda we appreciate amen hahaha it is God's grace let's just thank the Lord for God's grace amen that's beautiful that's beautiful praise God I don't think I ever forget that when you walked in and said I had my Holy Ghost experience I was beautiful praise God thank the Lord Isaiah 14:24 I'm gonna take a little bit about way to look at purpose tonight you know what I did is I went through the whole Bible and looked at the word purpose all the way through the Bible and then you know I read that Purpose Driven Life and I looked at all the times brother Branham said serve your purpose so with all these thoughts I'm just trying to kind of pull them together to maybe preach a few different thoughts that have kind of stood out to me as I've prepared and studied and so forth I'm not gonna look at the clock tonight and I'm just gonna preach tonight you know then we'd have a service this morning we can just be here all night of course I don't think I'll take you all night but as they have 1424 it's so good to be in the house of Lord see the saints of God for these guys it's always too long in between the times you see the real saints of God Isaiah 14:24 the Lord of Hosts has sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand then I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him underfoot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders the is the purpose that is purpose upon the whole earth and this is the hand that has stretched out upon all the nations may God as blessing it was reading of his word you may be seated kind of a strange text there you know and brother Branham of course we know it he says it's not so much in the amount of what you read or even in even in how many words you read it matters what you read and so my thought behind this was in verse 26 and Lydia I do have some quotes to go through about this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth so I like to look at some of these thoughts here tonight if I had it like a little subtopic and being driven it's at the top driven to purpose and driven by purpose so I'm gonna get to that at the end Lord willing but I want to start off just by looking at a few thoughts about God's purpose that he's doing right now upon the whole earth maybe review some of those things that he's doing but as you know maybe you haven't thought about it lately or maybe you have first God God has to drive us to our purpose and you can see it with almost every character in the Bible it almost like God has to orchestrate all these events to drive them in order to get to their purpose and then once they know their purpose in life that purpose drives them the rest of their days amen so if you haven't seen that hopefully by the end of this message you'll be able to see that because brother mayhem talks about it and of course the Bible speaks of it as well now remember the word purpose means intent God has an intention God has a purpose for each and every one of us so we read our text there I didn't read all the way to 28 but we remember in part one on New Year's Eve we looked at your purpose starts in God whenever God has called you for whatever intention God has it has to be first in his word which was course was in his mind and your purpose must be found in God and we saw how brother Branham that knew his purpose being a Eliezer his purpose on the three poles his purpose to heal the sick all of his purposes he could all find in the Word of God and then we saw how David found his purpose was to rule Israel was the lead Israel well that was his purpose it was beyond killing Goliath there was more to his purpose than just defeating a giant God had a more of a purpose than that and that's how it is for us we have more than just you know one or two great events in our life there's a greater purpose beyond just maybe one great great thing of being saved or one seen one miracle there's a purpose behind that and God wants us to be kings and priests on the earth amen and then part two we saw how God planned your purpose this was all planned out before the foundation of the world so today I want to look at just this thought of being driven to your purpose and then your purpose drives you but I want to first look at the global purpose you know we looked at our text in Isaiah 14 and and God said my whole purpose on the earth right now is to destroy Assyria now the Assyrian army had just started ruling recently and this was and jerry' and Isaiah says this in 712 BC and according to you know history the next major ruling was Babylon and so history says we'll get to this in a moment about matthew henry and some of the history that he writes but but God pronounces this that I'm that my whole purpose right now on the earth is to bring Assyria down so he was raising up Babylon and and according to history would be 200 years before this would come to pass so God doesn't always move like that and God pronounced it through a prophet and everybody thinks well this guy's off his rocker how is the Assyrian ever gonna fall see cuz that they never seen a Babylon before they never seen that but God was gonna raise it up and so God was going to use 200 years to move Kings down and raise Kings up and to move up armies and pulled out armies and he was gonna do it it was going to take some time but the Word of God would be accomplished praise the Lord his purpose that he purposed Saul the whole earth would be accomplished and this is the next few scriptures for the Lord of a hose had purpose it who shall dissin all it if God has intended something to happen there's no man that's going to stop it from happening his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back in the year that King Ahaz died was this burden see everything in earth was working for God's purpose to break me assyrian oak but of course if you know if they walked outside their homes and they would see the Assyrian soldiers and they would see the armies and think well I don't know if Isaiah he might have just might that might have just been Isaiah preaching today when he said God was gonna destroy Assyria you know the same thing happened like and when brother Branham was here people might hurt himself California's gonna fall in the ocean they thought well he just no yeah right like that'll ever happen or you know they might have heard him say different things and and not really had a spiritual understanding like brother Branham said he said thus saith the Lord they'll never come a greater ministry than the ministry you've seen in my ministry and people thought early in the next 56 years you know spent six years since been off these 54 years since but man went off the scenes surely oh surely somebody will raise up all she does is discern the sick and church there's never been a greater one raised up since oh yeah amen they might have thought oh come on he's just speaking out the side of his you know tongue-in-cheek or something like that if it's God's Word there's no man that can dis annul it God's Word is going to stand amen and see everything was working behind the scenes and God was going to accomplish everything that he complan the earth now just to give you an idea here Isaiah was this one went out in 700 what was it 712 so Isaiah had said this around 712 that Assyria was going to be broke look it wasn't even in the middle of their of their time of ruling and yet God is already foretelling this is what I'm doing upon the whole earth amen and it was going to come to pass God was going to raise up a Babylon and it wasn't even actually going to be it even though it was a head of gold it wasn't even going to last as long as the Persian Empire see God knows what he's doing and we want what we must do is we must hear the word the profit we must hear thus say the Lord and just stay with it praise God and not get distracted and not getting discouraged and not getting defeated but became confidence in Revelation that whatever God said it's going to come to pass amen we'll look at some more scriptures from Isaiah Jeremiah and Daniel we know how these all kind of went together but God's purpose if it was accomplished those 3,000 years ago surely church God's purpose is going to be accomplished today hallelujah if scholars look at the Bible over and they can put a date on Isaiah and then a date on this and the date on that if they can put dates on these things and see that God's words come to pass then surely that we can have confidence in every single time God said thus saith the Lord hallelujah see it was going to happen it was going to be accomplished but the people just needed to have patience and understand that God's purpose was going to be accomplished praise God so see matthew henry said the destruction of Babylon and the Chaldeans Empire was the thing at a great distance the Empire not risen to any considerable height when it's fall here was foretold it was almost two hundred years from this prediction of babylons fall to the accomplishment of it and again it's only been fifty year four years since brother Branham passed off the scene see people are and people already get coal we know a lot of people have left you know the message and things like that because of their own understandings or their own interpretations of what they think brother Branham said but the reality of it is that this hasn't been a very small little we'd say air puff right it's just been a very small vapor since God's prophet was here and God is working everything for his own good praise the Lord now remember brother Han tells us here the times of the Gentiles with I don't have a picture but the statue of the Gentiles we're at the feet with the very feet here we're not the iron and clay praise God we're at the Catholic and Protestant and it's exactly right it's right where it has to be and it's it's still in this area and and we know the Catholic Church has got to get stronger and the nominations and politics have to get stronger we're right where we have to be everything's working out just like Daniels mission said amen Daniel's mission is almost 2500 years old and it's still exactly right it's still working out and we just got to find our position in Christ in this hour amen the worlds are falling away they're getting more weak and all the time more deceived all the time but we've got to be getting more holy more in tune with God's Spirit we got to be more obedient we got to be more ready for the coming of the Lord ha ha ha hallelujah now remember this is also part of it Jesus said that's why you gather up the tares ye root up the wheat also let both grow together until the harvest and the time of harvest I'll say the Reapers gather together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat in my barn you know we've got to let the tares grow we've got a we've got it it's hard right as hard as we said on Wednesday it's hard to see the abortion law passed in New York but I read earlier this week that one's already been passed like that New Mexico I mean they've already had them the tails are just gonna grow they love murder they love death they love sin and they've just we just got to let them grow we got to pray against sin and speak out against it but in one way we just gotta let them grow but at the same time we're growing amen they're gonna let us grow hallelujah God's gonna let the bride growing then grow up into the Word of God hallelujah it's exactly right I know if you saw but I saw another news article - but Iowa just passed a good law to protect babies longer so see how that people that are all sinful are all all over thank god there's a couple out there that still care about life mine and you know it's not just Democrat Republican because Church Republican had Republicans recently just had the house and the Senate and they could have passed a law against abortion right they could have tried to stop it but they didn't because many of them it's just a it's just a political thing just to get votes from the Conservatives then when they get an office they don't do nothing about it see when you find somebody who's got some action behind their word than you then you got somebody that's actually worth maybe voting for right because it's not even the Republicans gonna change it in the last two years but they did it so see it's us it's not about politics it's about the Word of God amen our confidence is not in politics anyway it's in Christ Jesus praise God see we gotta let both grow together remember brother an tells us plainly in 62 it's binding time now that's the time that it is just like it was time where God was going to take down Assyria there in the days of Isaiah it's binding time now he said that every every council world council council churches every denomination polling right into the big thing going on all of them coming back to Rome just as they promised an image made into the Beast a power Confederation of Churches just exactly what God said would come to pass now while they're uniting brother Bram said God's uniting with his bride she's coming together from the east and the west and north of the south this is uniting time and that's all right now glory see they're both growing together that's why I like the unite with you and you you're not with me we used to put our faith together we just unite with God's Word we just come from every direction and we just come together and we rally around God's Word glory what's uniting forth the rapture she's God's getting her ready that's right what's she writing with the word so we just unite rolling this word in order to be united for the rapture praise God for all heavens and earth shall pass away but my words will never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride she's United herself with her bridegroom see the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the church and bride and the word is becoming so on until the very word itself is working out the work of the bridegroom so as the word works in us then we do what Jesus wants us to do finish the Great Commission praise God you see a uniting not no more join the church no more this book flee from everything and tied to Jesus Christ see it's uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the world of his promise hallelujah look this is all God is bringing all this together God is working on a global scale right now he's bringing me he's letting the tears grow up he's watering the tears he's also water in the weekday men hallelujah they live off the same anointing we do all you got to do is turn on you do it and type in you know some worship songs and you see them they're got cut hit women cut their hair the men men got long hair they all got makeup on men and women they got they all got their clothes off and they're all rejoicing and shouting under God's anointing and that's what's keeping them alive and here we are we live holy we live like the Bible said and we rejoice under the worship to praise God amen we're both living under the same water but the life is different because it's different seed I thank God for the seed of the word the Bible said it's the incorruptible seed the Word of God hallelujah but look when Jesus comes back this is arm again the Bible said all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him see this is what it's leading up to this is not just a serious going down now we have a new leadership when Jesus the part we're at now the purpose of the whole earth now is so Jesus can let give everybody a chance but then when he comes back they're gonna wail because he's so holy but this is what we're building up to you he's got to let them get hold unholy unholy wicked wicked so that when he comes back it scares them not that he wants to do it but he's trying to give them a chance he's giving them mercy after mercy think of this decade after decade a year after year giving them chances to receive the Word of God now all everybody on the earth almost all they have to do is type in their phone and they can hear preaching about Christ if they just got an internet connection God is trying to get to them through the internet he's trying to get through them to live preachers he's doing everything giving them every chance they can because they'll answer on the day of judgment this is God's time of mercy God is so gracious but when he comes back all the world will wail see we won't wail because we'll be feasting at the marriage supper of the Lamb hallelujah how do you know we're just cuz right now I'm feasting at his table now amen I'm not feasting at the devil's table these tables this this preaching is not tables filled with vomit you can turn on any denominational service and see that that's what they're preaching like I was listening to a you know somebody just one of the well one of the churches the mega churches in the area just had a Lincoln House you know finishing up my day on and I just thought well I'll check Facebook one more time people were texting me and and then I thought well I'll just I'll just I'll just skip to the end of this service of a mega church and Akron and see what they're preaching on and they're preaching on the prodigal son which is a good topic to preach on but in the midst of that they're saying that it's okay to get tattoos and they're laughing and and all these things and see and and see that's a perversion and they're laughing about like it's okay and then they're immoral and so see Church that's not what we feast on that's a table filled with vomit defiling the bodies no holiness no regard for the word and there's no Christian maturity to understand that your body is not just a finger it's not your us not even yours amen it's the temple of the Holy Ghost amen it's not something to joke about when you defy your body your devotees supposed to glorify Jesus Christ amen but there's no maturity there's no understanding it's without understanding but our tables have the real food of God at our table amen it's not saith the Lord thank you Jesus see he's got to get to the spot where this comes this hour of temptation and all of the world will be tempted in an hour to take the mark of the beast that's the time we're living that's God's purpose he's trying to save what he can and the rest are just getting further and further away and he's got to lay down the mark he's gotta let Satan rather lay down the mark the Bible said the Great Dragon was cast out in Revelation 12 that old serpent the devil Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him see this is the time where this is the binding time they're being bound to their deception they love to be deceived the Bible said they love having teachers we'll tickle their ears can you imagine if I to feather and I just was like this too brother amen I was a other tickling his ear like that and I went around just tickling and making everybody feel good trying to get you to laugh Oh what kind of preacher would that be that'd be a jelly jelly fish creature with no backbone we don't even know and I hope it's okay I mean it's really tickle your ear buddy so sorry about that I know hopefully I didn't tickle but that's not that's not why we're here we're not here to be tickled in here all good we are but instead we come here for one purpose to find our weaknesses and low spots that we can better serve Christ amen that's why we come here but see Satan deceives everybody and I don't see why Trinitarians can't see that that Father Son Holy Ghost is just titles look at this he's called serpent devil Satan great dragon he's got four titles there but the Satan fort is Satan for persons he's no he's one person I don't know why people can't see it but people can't see it I guess if they opened their hearts to Christ so see remember God when God's cup of remembrance is full his wrath will be poured out November God told Abraham he said your seed is going to be in Egypt but in the fourth generation they'll come out again for the iniquity am rights is not yet full see God was gonna let that cup get full I wish I had a cup up here I don't have a cup I've just got this the communion jar God has got to let that up and it's gonna take 400 years to fill that up God in His mercy mercy more mercy mercy patience give them profit preaching after preaching to give them a chance and once it got for once God when knew was full then he'd bring Joshua motor Moses in there and Joshua and they would purge out the land because God gave them plenty of chances aren't you glad of the God who gives you more chances amen the Bible says the same thing about revelation about the mother harlot her sins have reached unto heaven God remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double and her double corner works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double so she's got a cup she's floated there drunken with the blood and God said double that of all the blood she said double all the punishment on her and that's the kind old priest you see that's the kind no priests all that that's their doctrine that's that's what it produces right oh my god I let that God I let that cup get filled up to a certain spot and when it gets full then comes the wrath of God I say also said God was against more he the nation's just like today God is against Muslim and Buddhist nations God is against them he's nothing he's having mercy he's letting them get bound to their lives but God is against them amen look what I say I said he said that would be broken I'm sorry they shall be broken in the purposes there of all that makes sluices and ponds for fish where are they where are the wise men and let them tell thee now and let them know what the Lord of Hosts hath purposed upon Egypt so God tells Isaiah let them know what's coming to Egypt it's I mean mine can you imagine Egypt still getting punished this is a thousand years after Moses and God is still punishing them mercy God's judgment was against I read a Phoenician city on the Mediterranean coast near Israel his purpose was disdain its glory so God was going to take the next we'd say a hundred to two hundred years and sustain the glory of tyree they thought they were so beautiful they're patting themselves on the back they thought there's such or such a beautiful city and God was going to take their next 200 years and put a stain on them that's what he said now I have to report a concerning Egypt so shall they be so solely pained at the report of tyree now he says the Lord of Hosts has purposed it to stayed the pride of all glory and to bring into the contempt all the honorable of the earth so this was God's purpose in that day God was going to bring bring down the Syria raised up Babylon and all their glory and all that they thought they were God was going to put a stain upon it and bring contempt upon them right Isaiah 45 now this is kind of small but this should've scripture just mix he says God says I purpose it against them and I will also do it I'm gonna skip ahead general my now this is a few years later don't look at Jeremiah 427 on to each of the year on asurs crying out chronological order I keep saying that word raha ah this is uh okay BC 612 okay so this is actually yeah hundred years after Isaiah for thus saith the Lord the whole land shall be desolate yet I won't not make a full end for this show the earth mourn in the heavens above be black because I've spoken it I have purposed it and will not repent neither will I turn back from it God is going to turn the heavens black right now Jehovah Kim was the son of Josiah he was the third to last king of Judah before captivity now I'm gonna skip down to verse 3 if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that I repent me of the evil which I purpose and do unto them because of the evil their doings look how merciful God is God said I've it's my purpose to punish Israel but if their repent I'll have mercy on them Amen Alleluia and you know how we leave you know people like that too you know God's wrath is upon them but we know because of this because of God's love if they will just turn God will turn from his evil that he's purposed on them because God has a greater purpose of mercy amen and here's what he says just just tell them they'll say it the Lord if they'll hearken to me if they'll walk in my law which I've set before you to hearken the words of my servants the prophets whom I've set upon you both rising up early and sending them but you have not hearkened then I'll make this house like Shiloh we'll make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth God is so merciful Church he just wants what does he want he just wants us to here thus saith the Lord and obey that's all he wants here's the slate the Lord hear the word and obey and I'll have mercy on you oh what a what a simple thing to do isn't it just hear the us say at the Lord and obey jeremiah 36 i'm gonna skip ahead just to see the year sometimes they skip decades and so forth Jeremiah 36 - okay 607 so about five years later he said that it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose it new to them that they may return every man from his evil way that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin God five years later saying the same thing just just turn now five years seems like like that right to us think how much more God right that's why I like those pop-ups on Facebook well I posted that four years ago that was last year my goodness but God repeats it again through is through Isaiah or Jeremiah give them another chance you still have a chance you still got time and that's so I'm here today to tell you and and you're here to tell your friends we're here to tell people God will say mercy if you'll turn to God amen we just we just must be echoes right we just mean be reflectors of God's light reflectors of God's love I tried to pray for a man yesterday I said can I pray for you at the the gas station the children were there at home Alki was there and Karras and he was all custom and saying all these evil things and I said sir I said the church is not I said you're not talking about the church you're talking about whooping Wolf's and sheep clothing I said the true church doesn't act like that he said all churches in a corner awful I said my our church is inaccurate our church was an awful he'd been hurt by churches you know and I said did you know those are not true churches if they do any sin they're just wolves in sheep's clothing I said can I pray for he said no I said well you take my card he said okay I'll take your card and that's sad you try to pray for people they won't even accept your prayers uh what is it God right now mercy God trying to just reach anyone amen now this is what five years later yes no God had purposes against the city of T man he said therefore hear the counsel of the Lord which he had taken against Edom and his purposes that he had purpose against inhabitants of T men surely the least of the flock shall draw them out so see it isn't gonna take much to defeat these people surely shall make their habitations desolate with them now look at this this is beautiful look at this God had purposes against the land of the Chaldeans and Babylon during Jeremiah's ministry so let's look at this here and that's that's right that's actually the wrong date I looked at that's Wikipedian they gave me the wrong date they're so hard on me Jeremiah 51 I realized that after I read I didn't have this Bible in my house so I didn't have this when I wish I wish it would have brought it home I left it on the pulpit Jeremiah 51 29 okay this is 80 or I'm sorry bc5 95 now look the Bible said the land shall tremble as sorrow for every purpose of the Lord should be performed against Babylon to make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant now this is 59 I'm sorry 5 59 BC Babylon fell in 539 BC praise God this is less than 60 or 50 years God spoken through a prophet and and said Babylon is gonna fall and it took 50 years the church you got to hang on a few more how many willing to hang on a few more programs only been going 54 years that hasn't been too long this one was shorter than the other one right this was a lot shorter than Isaiah's I say this was two hundred years you had to wait the virgin shall conceive was eight hundred years you see so you just got to hang on just got to serve God just got to do what God's called you to do be happy to be thankful in it and being the best light for Christ you can be Amen that's all we're doing now what now I'm done with this global purpose now I want to jump into this thought here now I got this thought from the book I'm not gonna read all this but I'm just gonna briefly go through this because I want to get to the end thought yeah I'm not gonna look at my time that's right so as I was reading this book and I recommend anybody read it I've only found really two or three things that I didn't like about the book I'm putting in them in my next book I'm working on about the Trinity so the author believes in the Trinity and so he mentions the Trinity twice and says you know God brother Bram said God was alone but this man says no God wasn't alone because he had two other persons to talk with a church if that's not paganism I don't know what is are you with me now there's a balance to because the Bible the Bible said that Jesus was a logos and he was a light dancing before the invisible father so you got a balance it's here you know that Holy Spirit became visible but it wasn't like oh talking like three people like I'll talk to van over here I'll talk to a man over here how you guys doing and that's how they make it in this book you know now it's true God doesn't need us you know but the brother said God was lonely and he wanted to be with this family prays a little hard so see just got you know whatever you read just just make this your filter right whatever you read and of course don't read evil things but if it points you to God and you feel led to read it read it and then and then just take it through the filter of God's Word this will catch all the bugs this will catch all the residue this will catch all the solids right it'll catch all the all the bad stuff it'll filter it out now this this chapter starts off with everyone's life is driven by something and I think this is actually breaking the law too so I'm have to stop because you're not allowed to capture the any part of the book without permission so I just been doing it because it's easier for me type than typing it out but let's do this and so I don't break the law I'll just have it before me okay then when I'm done with these I'll jump back is that okay with everybody you know I just thought of that I better not do that see so drive means to guide or control or direct your life what drives your life what what directs your life whether you're driving a car a nail or a golf ball you're guiding and rolling and directing it at that moment what is the driving force in your life he says I thought that was good see now the trouble comes when were driven by problems pressure or or things like that that's the problem when we feel like Oh all my life is just driven it's just guided by my work or it's just guided by this person in my family or just guided by this we shouldn't allow that we should let our life be guided and directed and controlled by the Holy Spirit yes we're still going to have these forces and the struggles and these evil influences but we can't let them drive us to tell us what to do we've got to let the Holy Spirit drive us and deal with those as we are driven by the Lord and that's kind of the point he's making here he said many people are driven by guilt and shame you see that with people that struggle with depression their whole life like like I hate to say it but my dad he's driven by that whole mistakes he's made he is his letters let that just drive and down into depression all of his mistakes uh and church we're all gonna make mistakes who here has ever made a mistake go ahead everybody raise your hand now this is a good time everybody should raise their head if not you got the wrong spirit on you everybody's made mistakes remember Paul said in verse 15 he said I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God if anybody could have lived on Gil it would have been Paul I held I held the coat of Steve and he got stoned oh I'm just the worst as a murderer I'm just as evil that's true one sense but what if he would have stopped then churches never would have heard the gospel people would not have got healed what if Moses would have stopped after putting that last last handful of sand on the dead body what if he said well I might as well kill myself now then two million people never would have came out of Egypt by the blood by the blood of the Lamb a man see we have to understand we've all got little dead Egyptians buried in the sand in our lives we've all you know I used to laugh at Christians always feel bad about that or maybe there's times I didn't stick up like I should for certain situations see I can't let that drive me I've got to say God forgive me but I'm moving on in Jesus Christ I'm gonna use that as motivation I'll never do that again the best scripture the Bible said take revenge upon the devil amen it says that sin Corinthians chapter 6 what revenge what zeal we should have if we really repent of something we should not let it let regret overtake us and get us depress or discourage we just read here here's the remedy for guilt repent recognize God's grace and then labor by God's grace because that's what Paul said he said but by the grace of God I am what I am see I can't change he couldn't change that he held Stevens go and watch Steven die and was happy about it he couldn't do anything about that neither could Moses do anything about I killed the man Moses couldn't bring him back but he Creek you can't live with that you've got to recognize I am I am by the grace of God God must have wanted me to experience that so I could experience forgiveness amen and then he that's forgiven much loves much amen hallelujah so that's guilts remedy is to repent recognize God's grace and then labor and do all you can for God let God's grace labor in your life don't let guilt drive your life guilt shouldn't determine your life see I started looking at this see Cain's sin drove him out of God's presence God tried to take Cain's mistake of offering the wrong sacrifice and God used that to drive him to obey but he didn't want that so he let his pride driving the other way see that God came to him and said why don't why don't you just offer like your brother he said you'll lead the family you're the leader of the family you were born first of the twins you'll lead the family if you'll just do right God was trying to use his a mistake to guide him to obey but he didn't obey but see we have to accept it when we make a mistake say god you're right I'll obey no matter how hard it is I will be next time amen and not leave the word and not leave it behind and say well I'll never get over that I'll never be able to do that no we've got to let God's our mistakes that God points out to us drive us to do the right thing see Moses's murder drove him out of Egypt so God could drive all that education on him for the next 40 years Larry his mistake drove him out of Egypt and drove him to find his sweet little wife Zipporah although they had some temper tantrum arguments and he said oh she said all your bloody husband to me he didn't circumcise Goshen but they were still they still loved each other brother branham's complex almost drove them out of the wilderness but it drove him to get desperate and prayed say god I'm just gonna go up in the winters with my wife and it drove him to talk to God then God said look over there's a seven mountain peaks your names written all over there don't take your wife up there in the mountains don't leave the people keep preaching to the people Amen don't get discouraged that don't don't get down don't isolate yourself stay with my people keep preaching you're a New Testament preacher see our trials drive us into God's presence amen didn't Jonah's decision to obey eventually drove him to his purpose he thought well I'm I'm doing a fast one now all right where they met I'm gonna fast for now I'll get on a ship to Tarshish right I won't go to Nineveh I'll go to Tarsus I'm a pretty smart fella and his mistakes drove him to go away but God used that mistake to let him be a type of the resurrection of Christ amen three days and nights in the belly of a fish and God said I'm going to use your mistake and it's going to drive you for your purpose your purpose is to reflect Jesus Christ they meant your purpose is to preach to a people that will actually receive it can you imagine he got upset at a revival and people who've repented I would rejoice if somebody could repent amen [Music] I'd do anything to see people repent right and he got mad I can't believe these Ninevites are repenting they should have died I'm just like can we save somebody else other than brother amen and sister who is anybody else out there we can save God help us to say I'm sure that's what they say about me is anybody else be saying another method brother Jesse I'm sure that's what Simon Says can I save somebody else see there's got to be somebody that's hungry for God but see our mistakes God will use our mistakes and they'll drive us to fulfill our purpose because we're God's children and all things work together for the good them to love them then them are called according to his purpose some people are driven by anger and resentment complexes their whole life is about complexes I see it all the time amongst churches you know people get upset with up my other church pastors I talked to when I go up reach other places they talk about the problems they have and not everybody but some of them you know and these people will die with complexes against message people or this this instead of their family members you know Pete many people are driven by resentment and anger but you can't you can't be led by that you got to be led by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will lead you to humble yourself and even take the wrong if you have to just define peace of people God delights in peace church humming its amen to that God the lights and peace his next point he said many are driven by fear they play it safe they're afraid to venture out they avoid anything or they do anything to avoid taking a risk to maintain the status quo my but the Bible says there's no fear in love perfect love casts out all fear next he said many people are driven by materialism and I thought rich young ruler that's what drove him see God was God was trying to drive him to Christ come be a preacher all you got to do is just sell out everything and just call me a preacher but instead he was driven by materialism oh I've got to build bigger barns oh my his life was driven by the wrong thing it should have been driven by Christ some people are driven by approval though they just want to be approved by other people just one piece somebody to pat him on the back but jesus said you cannot serve two masters you can only serve one and you know unfortunately you know God's approval isn't always public right God's approval doesn't always feel as good as maybe somebody recognizing you at a government function you know again a plaque or a reward look at your church your church you know set up a a charity bank and everybody gets to come in Accra and everybody can hear you you gave away ten thousand dollars at the charity bank and you get a picture in the paper God's approval isn't always like that it's not always man's approval you cannot serve two masters you can only serve one master now here's the benefits like I said I'm going quickly through these because I want to get to this thought here before we finish and I like some of these thoughts he says knowing your purpose gives meaning to your life praise God that's why people wonder so what am I going to be when I grew up what up and they think that college brother bang is gonna tell them is gonna answer their call for purpose the college ain't gonna tell you you might find out while you're there you might find out well I'm not gonna this I'm not good that look at that like I just talked to my friend in Taekwondo and he's leaving the military he was in the reserves I said I said well did you find your purpose well you know anything about purpose now I was there he said no he said I just found out it wasn't for me now there's nothing wrong with that I'm not I'm not making him look bad but in any question our life we can find out God's purpose before we act on something in other words we can save ourself a little bit of time if we first when I wonder if I should try being a preacher I'll try being a preacher oh that don't work out maybe I should try to be a song leader that don't work out maybe I should I try to be a musician that'll work out maybe I should try to date this girl maybe I should try to court that girl instead of just guess it all the time it's not to guess the thing to do is leave your your idea out and get the mind of Christ amen we're not the guess we're not gonna try and try to reason we're just trying where you gotta lay ourselves before God say God show me what you want me to do and I'll be happy to do it then we got to do it glory knowing your purpose simplifies your life because once you know what God's called you to do you can say no to everything else oh my friends invited me to go to the Super Bowl party today got Church not quite sure what to do well if you knew your purpose would be an easy answer right well here's a job offer oh but I got to wear pants if I'm a woman or oh I don't know sure if I should let me pray about that you don't have to pray about that see when you know God's purpose for your life it simplifies your life life becomes so simple praise God I always put Christ first right always believe Christ keep your ABCs it's so simple always believe Christ remember jesus promised he said I'm leaving you my peace we can have peace in this life can't we he said the world will give you trouble but I'm leaving you my joy and I'm leaving you my peace once you know your purpose in life then you have the peace of God in your heart hallelujah once you know your purpose it focuses your life like Paul tells preachers if you're a preacher he said give yourself to reading exhortation prayer all those things and then you preach sound doctrine and then the people that hear you preach that hear you preach they believe it they'll be saved it's very simple give yourself wholly to whatever God gifts God's giving you give yourself wholly to that and then God will bless it very simple God simplifies our lives praise God amen now he a good bill straight he's the polite diffuse light has little power or impact but if you can concentrate the energy of light by focusing it with the magnifying glass the Rays of the Sun can be focused to set grass or paper on fire and when light is focused even more as a laser beam it can cut through steel amen hallelujah and that beautiful if you can focus light it will burn it will start a fire amen and you can find the focus of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll start a fire your life amen how do you do and there the world and all the barriers well I could never do this I could never do that that's what I pray for my children get the Holy Ghost because once they get the Holy Ghost they'll be laser-focused it'll start a fire in this church I don't know yeah or if you get the Holy Ghost wherever you're at when you're wrong with God it'll start a fire people will notice that persons on fire they're focused they know what God wants and the v-ray man the light of God is shining strong in their life thank you Lord right knowing your purpose motivates you see purpose always produces passion he says I like that purpose produces passion nothing energizes like a clear purpose but nothing wears us that like overworked overworked saps our strength and robs our joy when we're not doing God's purpose did I remember did you remember when I told you this brother Simon wondered for all these years he tried preaching in what was it 2007 or something like that each time and tried preaching and he thought well I'm not called to preach he and I I just kept feeling lead for Simon to preach I just felt leanin of the Lord I thought he was a teacher and pretty soon had him coming and he said he said but then he saw he had like three dreams about Thailand for some reason and then a brother said he had a dream about Simon preaching in Thailand and so Simon said Lord I'm putting in your hands you know he he could tell the story better than I could and he said I'm going off these three witnesses and he said when he got the tire in the first time and started preaching and ministering and trying to win souls he said it was the first time he felt alive in his life and he's over 40 years old church amen honey there we are see when you know God's purpose for your life you finally feel like I'm alive amen honey I feel like I'm living and that's what I feel every time I start reading or preaching or teaching God's work I feel alive amen I feel like this is what I was born to do preach Jesus Christ and him crucified a man I'm preaching he's coming back for a rapture bori see purpose gives you motivation it doesn't mean we don't get discouraged sometimes I lose my motivation it also takes us a little bit of humility also takes a little bit of trials pressure also takes a few testimonies and here comes my passion right back we all go through that don't we Church we all see knowing your purpose gives you motivation the true joy of life is being used for your purpose all right okay let's go back up here I'm just gonna put one thing up there real quick at the end of this chapter yes what would my family and friends say is the driving force in your life if someone was watching your life and they just got to watch all day I'm just gonna watch where they amen and when a man leaves okay I'll follow him out just watch him get my car I'll follow him maybe stops at McDonald's he stops at Burger King I'm like well I know what drives his life now I'm just kidding I follow bang home he stops at Home Depot then Lowe's I know what it drives his life he's trying to fix things I know you know stop at Burger King and McDonald's brother I'm sorry I took oh dear and I make jokes about fast-food forgive me but I'm just trying to use an example I need to use myself next time what would people say what drives their life what drives your life what controls and if we if we could ask your children if we could pause my Twitter side and I want to be there and you know maybe Karen could interview them what drives our dads like what is his May driving force what is the thing he wants the most out of life I wonder what my tuner would say money is that always in this is room counting money and and trying to call to make deals to make more money I wonder I wonder what your children would say or your husband or wife I wonder what they would say what is the driving force what is pushing them through life what's controlling their thoughts is that is that a pretty good thought what's controlling your thoughts what's driving you now I'm just as I said concluded the chapter I just wrote these out we are not driven by fear but faith prophecy should drive our life the prophecy of Joel 2 about the end times paul told timothy remember the prophecy about his life maybe some of us have a prophecy on our life i know uh cam does I know but Tim iers does I know different ones I was there when Tim Myers got a prophecy all the time I was there he's out the vestibule and and everybody's fellowship and all of a sudden sister Karen she was letting the Holy Spirit just walked up and said thus saith the Lord it's our prophesied over Tim Myers preach the rock or praise the Lord but I haven't let that discourage me even though anyone nobody prophesied over me I know God did because he he said I said I've chosen you in Christ before the foundation of the world so whether anybody prophesize me over overnight that's okay cuz I know Jesus has in other words I'm not gonna be discouraged if I'm not like somebody else I'm not gonna be like Peter say what about John what about him what I'm not gonna follow him he said go do what God's called you to do follow thou me we thank God for that though we really do thank God for that Paul said to know the will of God redeemed the time so if you want to know God's will make the best use of your time don't waste your time let purpose Drive your life purpose will simplify your life now don't look at the time he said God saves you now here's here's a thought God now here's a different thought God saves you from your own purpose how many had a different purpose before you became a Christian you had different things you wanted to do with your life I wrote it on my wife can tell you I wrote it in my wallet I said I want to be in the NFL I want to make million dollars and buy my mom a house that was my gold goal in life I never would have made it probably but that was my goal anyway now look what Joe said this is in the midst of job's trials for God's actually actually the end of jobs trials because I'm in chapter 22 to find this for God speaketh once you ain't twice and yet man doesn't perceive it you realize that God's talking to us all the time and we just sometimes we don't catch it in a dream and a vision of the night when deep sleep falls upon men in slum brings upon the bed then he opened the ears of men and sealed their instruction that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide man from pride thank God hallelujah thank God that God has to somehow seal up our instructional her seal for our ears he'll get us all closed off from the things of the world so that we can hear God's Word and pull us away from our purposes in life thank God for that amen don't do that John knew God to get your ear sealed up in order for you to hear his voice that he can withdraw you from your purpose thank God for that I'm so glad that you know when Simon came to hear the message or you came to give me the message back in 2001 that's what God did God drew me away from my purpose wanting to be an NFL and Simon said come up here you know my room was the Upper Room so I heard the message up in the upper room and now I got the Holy Ghost - amen idea that's what I heard it see that he may withdraw you and it pulled me away from my purpose and it drew me to shut off all the things of the world so I could hear the message of the hour God keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword amen who's kept you alive all these years Lord Jesus Christ he kept you from perishing now I just wanna lay in there cuz as I looked through the word purpose I came upon that and church we should be so thankful for that that God didn't let you achieve your purpose in life that you want to do first what would you be we hardly like to think about it but where would you be tonight if God didn't come and take you away from your purpose my goodness thank God he pulled us away so here's how God does it first we're driven to our purpose and then once we know our purpose then that purpose drives us forward see then your purpose drives you first God drives you to purpose then your purpose drives you here's some examples now I meant notice and I'm gonna use guarantee our netpeak again like brother BAM did see God spares men's lies by drawing them away from their own purposes this was even brother number of milligrams talked about his purpose that wouldn't be a cowboy that was his purpose in life to be a cowboy can you imagine him not be in minds behind the pulp of a ridin horses last so in cattle whoo can you imagine our profit that's what he wanted to do I'm gonna be a real cowboy but he saw the boy said I'm not a cowboy God has a way to drive us away from our purpose I'm so glad he does church remember up for each other so few weeks ago he got polio 15 he died at 17 not a potent open to some other flu and disease but he made it he may have died from polio but eventually but he didn't actually die from polio the good program says remember the last time I saw garner and he we stepped in unexpectedly his love is in a home he was staying with his people and what we did find it would be a real example for any Christian minister to see this sober man kind of slips into his house without let him know he was coming and he was setting up out of the rocking bed had his arms in a little sling and as we walked to the house he was always so welcome there was Garnett before him was the Bible would you like that when people if people walked into your house and they caught you reading the Bible that's how brother ham caught this boy with polio and the little lady that was taking care of him was sitting over there a little do a full affair and they were having Bible study and I looked at him and my heart just melted god forbid if should go in the hospital and if I'd ever have to come pray for you or you come pray for me I hope you find this I hope you find me if I'm in the hospital at all I hope you find me with my Bible opening I'm doing a Bible study with the nurse oh no sister no the Bible actually says this 10 days later they're baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ pardon me excuse me can you increase my medicine excuse me wouldn't you want that testimony Church somebody actually oh oh it's room 7-eleven or o'the room 7 7 7 well oh yeah there's there's brother bang oh he broke his leg or something I'm not speaking bad things here well he's got his Bible open he's witnessing to the nurses there oh that's a real Christian right there and I said to him asked him a question I said garnet perhaps what if this had never happened to you with polio let's say I was caught up here tonight a young boy by the name of Garnett pica just got killed out of here on the highway with this car and the boy was drunk in other words would you rather have polio o or get drunk and die in a car I got no God and he said just let it be the way it is as long as I know Jesus the way I know him now he said it's more than life even though I have to stay here all my life in this condition hey man hallelujah do you wish you could just some fun and not be in the bed and go out there and drink with your buddies and drive hot rods and maybe die drunk would you rather have that would you rather be stricken by polio in the bed he said I'd rather have polio that I would know Christ amen see this is what my mom said it was gone it's time to go at 17 it was his time to go he had served his purpose he come to Christ been German ties what if he would have died before this time polio drove him to God see you have to be driven to your purpose and then when you have your purpose that purpose can drive you to 15 years old God used polio Garnett probably won't repent without polio I've got a lot of polio now he didn't say probably he knew Garnett would not repent without polio I've gotta let the 15 year-old boy get polio and this will drive him to me and then once he has me and knows my prophet he'll have the purpose of God he'll have Bible studies for the next two years ha ha amen and this will drive the rest of his life now that he knows me praise God polio drove him to God he was to be a tobacco auctioneer that's what he had in his mind I'm gonna be a real slick real fast talker I'm gonna make lots of money I'm gonna be the fanciest guy with the microphone oh I'm gonna be a good fella but that wasn't his purpose at all we knew that his purpose was to be a Christian now a tobacco auctioneer somebody said well maybe 75 years from today if the world would stand that long and garnet he was a great auction ear maybe that's all the minister could have said his funeral he was a great auctioneer but see now he's a Christian look what the Bible said remember this I don't know if you remember I preached this a couple years ago the righteous perishes and no man laid at the heart no one really thinks why did this righteous person perish why did God let this young person die the Bible said merciful men are taken away nun considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come you know a way to turn an evil life tobacco auctioneering and pride and who knows cancer you know cuz visit maybe he had addiction to tobacco who knows but God took him before the evil would happen his mind oh I'm gonna make lots of money I'm gonna be famous i'ma be the smoothest talking auctioneer there ever was God said that's not your purpose so I'm going to use this sickness and it will drive garnett to me and then it will drive him the next two years of his life now that he's found his purpose praise God remember even God has a place for little ones that die prematurely remember David said that David said well why am I gonna mourn now he said I'll go to him but he should not return to me God has a purpose even those little ones that pass away God has a little purpose there's a place for them according to David God's got a place God has a purpose for all things now here's a little more on our net and then I want to close with a mother Ford quote but God had to throw him garnet in that stage to get out of him to serve the purpose I've got to let polio come upon a fifteen year old boy in order to get something out of him look at his patients remember the word long-suffering is another word for patience and long-suffering is a fruit of the Holy Spirit it was going to take two years of battling polio and God was gonna allow the fruit of patience to come out of Garnett's life said everybody in the town could come up by and see oh here's a real Christian look he's got the fruit of it he's not impatient he's patient this was the purpose of his life don't all plants and vegetables have a purpose Church so do spiritual trees spiritual trees have a purpose his purpose was to produce the fruit I just want everybody to see a real patient Holy Ghost field Christian now even the myths of staring down a life-threatening disease you can still be patient with God that's what I want this whole community I think was Campbellsville Kentucky God said this is what I want Campbellsville Kentucky to see a patient Christian so brother Branham said on the day of judgment it will testify against the community look at his patients his testimonies among you neighbors look what he was what how his little life I spoke to many of you that at the day of judgment without that his life will testify right back against you he was an example of what God wanted with him he served God's purpose two years of having polio but the end of that two years he had a real testimony of fruit to his life and the people could esal see ma look at that precious fruit he's not regretting it he's not cursing God he's not saying oh I wish I was this I wish I was that he produced a godly fruit of patience don't you don't know you think we take it for granted when was last time you had an apple when was last time you had a orange this delicious fruit and use we just might in July but we fail many times to see just how glorious that fruit is get hungry one time and you'll see how glorious that fruit is right church and that's what Garnett's life was these hungry the Bible said there's a famine right in the last days for the word of God there's a famine and all these hungry sinners get to see my look at that delicious fruit of patience what a patient godly person garnet was and no doubt that I would say with on the rest of their life because Moran said they'll answer the day of judgment you saw patience that's how you act when trials come upon you because that's what Jesus had to do Jesus had to be patient omits of his trials two years two years it produced repentance Bible study Christian testimony all those years and at the end he brings forth his fruit and all the world all the world stands that looks like God's fruit this is what I produce hallelujah remember the Bible said the same thing of job you have heard of the patience of Job the Bible said see it's the purpose of patience sometimes our lives are to produce one of these fruits of the spirit remember I preached this from the numerology I just copied and pasted see three times three is nine nines a number of fruit or maturity the three times for the fruit of divine maturity or the maturity of divine things so in that two years and garter became a mature Christian in a two-year span and brother Han said he was German ties which means he had the baptism holy ghost God gave the men the Holy Ghost with polio and produced a godly mature Christian in the matter of two years that's how great our goddess amen to save someone right before it's their time to go to drive them to drive them away from me in a worldly auctioneer tobacco auctioneer to dry them to Christ and then Christ would drive that that desire that that that love for Christ would drive them forward for the next years of their life remaining see because long-suffering is patience now let me read one more well it's it's a string of quotes and I know I know I appreciate you been a good audience here let me finish up with mrs. Ford how many do they remember mrs. Ford but Ram story mrs. Ford was the woman that gay brother branham that that boy scout legging that he wanted mrs. Ford's son was brother his friend who had the Boy Scout uniform brother Graham always wanted it and he said promise me when that wears out you'll give it to me and all that was left was the pants was one legging that was mrs. Ford's son and real man talks about mrs. Ford's purpose in life now I'm gonna skip passes he said see I wore that leg in the school so it was the Boy Scout leggings mother that was his mother that just passed away mrs. Ford this is from letting off the pressure I was listening a sermon I almost started crying I'm so beautiful and they're among the poorest of the poor people but they must had enough money to get me Boy Scouts or maybe they maybe they had the hand-me-down Boy Scout uniform Lloyd the boy who gave me the legging we've been Chum since little boys I said of Lloyd what would you want me to take the funeral text from and said brother Billy just would like you to speak for this if it's the will of the Lord just give me some assurance that my mother will be back again and I said very well so brother took the subject for mrs. Ford's funeral anything that lives to the will and purpose of God has a resurrection glory hallelujah and brother man talks about God's a God of variety he makes us different because he wants us that way he makes some rich some poor so mrs. Ford was not made a rich woman but she still loved Jesus Christ program said God makes some rich makes some poor why can't they just got out of their poorness why they why they always over and come with poverty maybe God made him like that God made Hattie right like that and people still preach on her testimonies all the time how about that where's the testimonies all the rich people the message see God sometimes chooses the poor of this world rich in faith hallelujah but we got to a place to serve God and that's the place that he's placed us in if we'll just abide in that place see not be driven to get out of the place God's called us but to be in the place where God's called us everybody talks about how a lily has tutorial to give off its its fragrance and then once it gives it off nobody thanks to Lily it serves its purpose you smell the flowers that's pretty good and going the next thing now I mean it Labor's it for all of that it Labor's just to give that off and then that dies you throw it in the compost bin or throw it in the trash what if the little stalk of corn see that corn stock would say I'm so sorry there's nothing pretty about me I don't have no honey to give out I didn't have this or the other that's what we say well I'm just not like mr. Christian er I wish I was like that Christian but then the master of all would say yes but the lily that little lily couldn't make corn flakes either I just don't smell good like that Lily I I'm just a I'm just a cornstalk but you've got a purpose you've got something God has called you to do that other people can't do but you can do it when you're aligned with God's Spirit see we all have a thing that we can do we serve God in the category that were put in and it comes back just the same you didn't think you'd hear preaching about cornflakes today did you when you have poured your cornflakes at breakfast this morning did you well maybe tomorrow morning when you pour your clock wakes you'll think about this quote thank God for the corn while you're smelling your lilies on your table Oh delicious or beautiful so refreshing Church is the purpose God has a purpose for everything and church something you know often we just overlook God's purpose we're so looking for everything else this is where it's laying right there in front of us outside it's laying right there in front of us but always looking to everything else I love this I'm gonna read this whole thing let's say in our feet now in the face of all that at the funeral brother have said I said this I said here's a little mother forward as I know her she's washed my little bitty face when I was a kid minute can you imagine that she was so led by God God led her over not to just she'd wash some of the faces for that he grabbed a whole that prophet of God's face hallelujah God had a woman there to take care of his little prophet I'll clean off his face make sure it looks presentable when he goes home glory see Church everything every little thing you do God's watching see there was his pores could be but she was born a female a lovely girl and she's born a female then that was for a purpose to have a mate a male and she did a loyal mate she was a men she lived with her husband for some 60 years or better and our Lord your woman wasn't more now that includes his wife his wives hope Mita and his mama a more loyal woman er wasn't more as I know of a real lady now he's not exalting her but he's just saying she's one of the most loyal women I've ever known being that she was that that Union they were to have children now look at this is beautiful you can hear brother I'm talking to mrs. Ford's children at the sermon and brother I said here's her fine her nice buying shirt or sent here just as lovely you children would never want a better mother or would you and you can hear him say no we wouldn't see no her Ben could not want a better wife what was your purpose well I'm just a woman I'm just a mother that's all I am I just have children I'm just a wife that's all I am but your purpose is to be the best wife and mother that your husband could ever add and your children could ever have your purpose is to be more loyal or lawyer or Pew more pure than anyone that that could possibly be be as pure be as loyal be as loving as you possibly can be so loyal that your family if you god forbid it then they should be at your funeral some day that they could say I could never want a better father than my daddy now some of us don't have that privilege right I I wish I had a better father mother you know in some ways but I'm thankful for what they did for me I'm they for the godly instruction that didn't have but I could have a better yeah I wish I had a little better but God knew Church God knew but see we have a choice now we have a choice now to be as loyal as we can as loving as we can as christ-like as we can right now to serve God's purpose for our life I never met a more loyal pastor than brother Jesse I hope you can say that at my funeral if I have I never met a more loyal father than my daddy brother Jesse I hope by God's grace people can say that about my life because that's my purpose my purpose is not to mix up and give my eyes off of the one I'm supposed to do my purposes to be focused like a laser and burn with the Holy Ghost for my purpose I said she was poor cabbie but nobody now look could ever come to her door or need but what she would give to them the neighbors no matter what trouble they was in mrs. Ford any hour of the night was there to help them do anything she could with what she had to do with remember the proverbs 31 woman one thing about her her light was on all night now sisters you have to have your lights on but who's the one that gets up when the kids get sick my wife she don't need a light on she just gets up I'm the one who got any find my phone and where was that flashlight button I know it's here somewhere look at look at her testimony loyal wife loyal mother loyal neighbor brother BAM said I could not find a more loyal woman than this she served her purpose and I said above all that glory what could be above being a better wife and mother this could that I had the privilege one time I seen that steed German she was born again in the spirit of god I said now where now we're gonna plant her a little bit in the ground and who who intelligently could stand up and say she will not rise again she served God's purpose on the earth hallelujah above everything see when you're born again it drives you right you know I'm sorry God drives you to being born again and then once you're born again it drives you into your purpose how they do you and thence then people say well that I've never seen a more loyal person than this I've never seen a more godly worker at the bank than that person wherever you work I've never seen a more godly teacher than brother so-and-so sister so and so that's what Christ how many thankful that Christ produced is that kind of fruit in your life now kind a man once you come here I better stop right there brother branham said you would be crazy to say that that person that died if they're real Christian would never rise again you'd be crazy to do that because all Christianity is based upon one thing resurrection that's what all this Paul said we are miserable if we don't have the resurrection it's all about the resurrection we see people die don't get discouraged you'll see them again thank God we'll see them again it's all based upon this seed life if this seed got the the seed can't bring more for free for unless it raises the dies rots and raises again Jesus had to die in order to bring forth more seed but minister the church had to die in the days of Luther in order before Luther and then rise again in a resurrection hey man how do they Laurie in order to produce the rapture seat at the end time hallelujah all right you can switch over to songs here how many thank for God's grace in your life how many can see God driving you to the message and the batson Holy Ghost and once you got the Holy Ghost now you can see this Holy Ghost driving your purpose forward in life if you can see that church then brother Baron said above all that's the most wonderful thing you could have in this life the most wonderful thing you could have a thing through it all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God Church let's not let anger drive us don't let anger drive this week don't let fear materialism don't let these things drive our lives you know we're here we're here we have to work jobs and new and run families those things but we should say God let your spirit drive me to be the best example of Christianity I can be so that if I do go to the grave people will know what drove Jesse Smith people will know what drove our sister beatrice to fly across the ocean this many times to be a blessing to her grandchildren people will know people not with drove sister Brenda the church when she wasn't feeling good all those times they don't know what drove her because all those who don't receive Christ will have to answer for the life that they saw driven in you because you'll be a witness that you bore fruit you'll be a witness of God's love let me read those fruits real quick I know love joy peace Meritus time I want to find it love think about that am i producing love and people see the fruit of love in my life after years of being around me can they see joy in my life can they see peace I've had many people come why are you happy all the time Jesus I just tell them Jesus they can see the fruit like I told you remember last year I went I got up at 7 or 5 o'clock to go to the middle school to teach Bible Club and a teacher pulled me aside and said I've been watching you for years I'm Buddhist but she said you are the best example of Christianity I've ever seen I said well thank you I said it doesn't have nothing to do with me it's Christ in me she said I see how you treat those kids you never treat them evil you treat them with so much love and you always give it out candy and giving her giving out things the kids try not good for their dental bills but no what do you do what do you do [Music] but these people should be able to see the peace in your life because they saw a long suffering in Garnett's life they saw patients see gentleness he she's so gentle at work he's so gentle at work he's such a dick she's such a gentle mother he's such a gentle father goodness faith meekness temperance against such there's no law against that you're not breaking any law when you say god help me to be more gentle help me to be more loving honey would raise your hand say lord help me to have more love joy peace help me to be long-suffering help me to have more gentleness help me to manifest and bring forth these fruits in my life praise God and if I never had a problem wouldn't know that he could solve them I wouldn't know they through I've learned the trustee Beezus I've learned to trust in God to depend upon his word and lots of places and I'm and lots of places and I've seen a lot of faces there been times I felt so all alone but in my lonely hours yes those precious lonely hours Jesus let me know [Music] [Applause] [Music] they got for the mountains for if I never had a problem wouldn't know that he could solve them I never know what face [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey I just thank the Lord tonight thank you Lord we love you Jesus we love you Lord God hallelujah how many want to be driven by the love of God driven by the Holy Spirit I don't want to be driven by work deadlines and why don't we driven by money and materialism I want to be led by the Holy Spirit people can see that I'm following the leadership of God praise God what a testimony that is if God can do in a 17 year old boy God can do it with each one of us praise God most of up here above 17 you know if God can accomplish his purpose at a 17 year old boy I would say God drive me to my purpose and let my purpose drive me there's God Heavenly Father Lord that's our desire Lord tonight no doubt Lord some of us might look like we're on one side of the other Lord maybe we battle with it but Lord Jesus may you just settle this issue in everybody's life a little now you use every situation to drive if they're not there if they don't know their purpose may you use every situation every trial to drive them to know their purpose in life and then once they're there knowing the purpose of God being inspired and filled with the Holy Ghost it'll drive them forward to accomplish it it'll burn up every enemy before them like a laser beam a focused light it'll simplify their life their life won't be confusing it'll be very simple my focus is Jesus Christ glory my focus is to be the best mother I can be the best father I could mean to be the most loyal husband I could ever be that's my purpose in life my purpose is to give give to ever ever needs help to be available in any hours of the day that's my purpose in life to be a blessing to other people that I don't live for myself and squander my life living selfishly but to live with other people mind oh god take our eyes off material things take our eyes off fear take our eyes off pride take our eyes off guilt take our eyes off regret eyes off fame and fortune and let our eyes be on the Word of God tonight thank you lord god I know you'll do it Lord God as you did it in mrs. Ford's life 85 years old and she did it in Garnett's life at 17 in the days of Isaiah and Jeremiah Lord all your purposes will be accomplished let then be accomplished in our lives have your way Lord God in Jesus Christ name the church said amen praise God let's just go to that song have thine own way thou art the Potter I am the clay honey one that was sweet nail-scarred Potter's hands to mold you over tonight make you a little smoother alright make you show you your shape at all I didn't know I was going to turn into this look what gods do it look what God is doing in my life he just sleuthing out all those rough places oh my phrase God praise God what's that title Eddie I'm sorry what's that title okay [Music] [Music] after thy we [Music] [Applause] [Music] second verse have I know the way deal or have died don't search me try me master master whiter than snow wash me just nah as in the hybrid get the third verse ready but just keep playing that let's just pray here father just wash each person now Lord God whiter than snow Lord God let us be driven by thus say the Lord let us say the Lord be the greatest motivator our life dear God granted Lord Jesus if we were guilty of any of those other forces driving us trying to serve two masters trying to please everybody trying to be everybody's favorite god help us overcome forgive us just now Lord forgive your people may our only desire be to please you dear God may you be the master of our life great master great Potter mold this clay mold the clay here in Bride of Christ fellowship every heart that of flesh then you can mow may you mold it now for your jewelry dear God molded after the I will not will give you all the glory in Jesus Christ name Amen third verse a cygnus praise God this the last verse Olivia there's 400 [Music] [Applause] [Music] Holden and we're help me ivory surely is died [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's virtually significant have I or my decimal yes absolutely sway me driveability with ice [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise God they were in desire prayer tonight as anyone need any prayer were welcome to come up here happy to offer prayer for you thank God I'm gonna let God have his own way in their life I don't enjoyed the word of God oh I loved it I loved I got extra study time - extra prayer time because the snow so snows not always a bad thing I love a little more time with Jesus just a little more talk with Jesus makes it right and they pray for us we're dismissed here father we thank you Lord God this probably our third prayer at the airport but this is a house of prayer we always want to be that dear God of course it's a house of preaching in your word and tables spread before the Saints where they're fed the Lord the the greatest attribute jesus said about his church it's a father's house would be prayer we trust you lord this song said it so beautifully hold over each of our lives your absolute sway your driving force Lord don't let our lot don't let us drive our own lives may you drive our lives may you sway us to do your will on this earth may we let you sway us dear God you swayed a 15 year old boy with polio you swayed a poor old mother to become the most loyal mother and wife she could possibly be for 85 years of her life goodness move over our being absolute sway have absolute control of our lives we thank you for this opportunity to be in your house Lord bless your people seems like all's well Lord no sick among us we're so thankful for that dear God thank you lord thank you Jesus father let us go and fear and admonition of you Lord on the Sunday night bless our little fellowship here dear God no doubt will fellowship around the Word of God and with one another just be the driving force in our lives let's be led by the Holy Spirit you said you'd guide us into all truth if that be our testimony and we can beef fruit bears before our families fruit bears before our friends our co-workers our children for those of us who have children our spouses for those of us who are married let us bring forth the real genuine fruit of God our purpose in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you church-going fear and admonition of the Lord may God have his purpose in your life praise God
