[17:12] getting a check in my spear on wearing
[17:15] makeup on Monday after all my wake up
[17:17] makeup away except mascara thinking it
[17:21] would be okay every now and then to use
[17:23] later that night ask God to reveal to me
[17:25] whether it was okay to wear mascara at
[17:29] 7:00 a.m. this morning I woke up I came
[17:31] across your video on makeup in the Bible
[17:33] God's Word is so clear so as soon as I

[23:07] Word of God let's say you know whose
[23:13] side are you staying on let's see that
[23:14] by God I'm extending our frequency that
[23:16] then chance to stretch your legs a
[23:18] little bit as we stand on the Lord's
[23:20] side
[23:20] so can I stand on Jesus inside that
[23:24] [Music]
[23:27] [Applause]
[23:57] [Applause]
[24:04] [Applause]
[24:33] [Applause]
[25:09] [Applause]
[26:06] I like to open up to Larry to portion
[26:11] scriptures let's go to Matthew 7:1
[26:15] preach on familiar thought tonight but
[26:18] take it a little different angle
[26:20] I never preached this thought before but
[26:22] if you listen to my friend and you've
[26:23] heard him say it I like to preach on the
[26:26] trail of the serpent tonight by God's
[26:27] grace
[26:27] I've never preached on that thought I've
[26:29] studied it out a lot of this will be a
[26:32] review but I just want to bring the
[26:34] whole thought through and numerous
[26:36] indications of that this
[26:37] this week and even today so what's with
[26:40] you guys the freaks you try to see
[26:41] witnesses you know when you see two or
[26:43] three witnesses you know then you kind
[26:45] of feel that's led of the ward so I
[26:46] believe this we let them lure this night
[26:48] by God's grace so Matthew chapter 13 or
[26:52] 713 Matthew 7:13 on the trail of the
[27:04] server enter ye in at the strait gate
[27:13] but why is the gate and broad is the way
[27:15] that leadeth to destruction and many
[27:18] there be which go in thereat because
[27:22] Strait is the gate and narrow is the way
[27:24] which leadeth unto life and few there be
[27:27] that find that beware a false prophets
[27:31] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[27:32] but inwardly they are ravening wolves
[27:36] you shall know them by their fruits do
[27:40] men gather grapes of thorns or figs of
[27:42] thistles so at every and even so every
[27:46] good tree bringeth forth good fruit but
[27:48] a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
[27:51] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[27:53] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[27:55] forth good fruit every tree that
[27:58] bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
[28:00] down and cast in the fire whereby by
[28:03] their fruits you shall know them
[28:05] I'm gonna Mathew 24:24 very firm in
[28:08] Scripture but this one lay this in here
[28:10] grace of the Lord as it's a mayor one
[28:16] but it's a very crucial scripture it's
[28:19] going to be so close and as we get down
[28:21] to the end as we keep going on the time
[28:23] goes on it's going to be it's going to
[28:25] take more discernment of the Holy Spirit
[28:27] to be able to show which is the true
[28:28] church which is the foster because
[28:30] that's what Jesus said it's gonna be so
[28:33] close we receive the river like if it
[28:36] were possible but we know it's not
[28:37] possible I'd be 2424 let's read this one
[28:42] together one two three four there shall
[28:45] arise false Christ's and false prophets
[28:47] and shall show great signs and wonders
[28:51] in so much that if it were possible they
[28:54] shall deceive the very elect a man let's
[28:56] have word prayer if you just buy your
[28:58] head if you have a need on your hearts
[28:59] and they could go into God somehow God
[29:01] is the great provider is the great
[29:04] discerner of the thoughts of tens of the
[29:06] heart Heavenly Father we come to you
[29:08] tonight reverently lord san your songs
[29:10] we're standing on your side of the
[29:12] praying on your side we're waving on
[29:14] your side we're jumping on your side we
[29:16] are on your side and your side is the
[29:18] side with the word the sharp sword so
[29:21] Lord let your word come forth Lord
[29:23] tonight in power demonstration Jesus
[29:25] Lord as we labor in order to present the
[29:28] truth Lord God and father I just pray
[29:31] God that your people will be blessed may
[29:33] you meet every need God speak to us here
[29:35] tonight
[29:35] train us and righteousness the Lord God
[29:37] and we'll give you all the glory honor
[29:39] and praise in Jesus Christ the church
[29:41] say Amen god bless she's being seen I
[29:55] don't have many slides I I spent most of
[29:58] my time today you know finishing the
[30:01] third video so I just have a few slides
[30:05] to show so now Kevin ready buddy I don't
[30:11] have many to show and I might people
[30:21] tell me keep doing that brother blessing
[30:23] that's what we're like that so I want to
[30:26] do that and I believe it just it's
[30:28] building up training for newcomers by
[30:31] God's grace to me it's kind of like this
[30:33] cycle ship create those videos visiting
[30:36] a source so I can point people to I can
[30:38] even point myself I was gonna teach you
[30:40] to someone who's never heard it before
[30:41] this is what I would say and so we spent
[30:44] hours and hours you know working on
[30:47] those like today they'll be used for the
[30:51] kingdom of God more and more God's grace
[30:54] so I wanted to stop the trail of the
[30:56] serpent I'd like to start just by
[30:58] reviewing a few things and we set my
[31:02] timer here just got a reminder
[31:04] my timer I want to go too long so we
[31:12] remember you cannot remember brother
[31:13] Adam said Satan hates two books more
[31:15] than any other books of the Bible
[31:17] Genesis to Revelation Genesis shows how
[31:20] he started revelation shows how he ends
[31:23] up so those are the two books he hates
[31:25] more than anything they expose him and
[31:28] Satan hates to be exposed so church we
[31:31] know if we're hiding anything in our
[31:33] hearts and we're afraid to confess
[31:35] something are afraid to go talk to
[31:36] somebody or afraid we know that's the
[31:39] enemy that's the enemy got into our
[31:41] minds and he's built up a stronghold or
[31:42] we'd say our root of bitterness
[31:45] I don't been studying on that my
[31:46] freetime that student by God's grace
[31:47] very similar to a complex you know
[31:49] people build up a complex and they get a
[31:51] certain feeling or certain attitudes
[31:53] toward a certain individual or church or
[31:56] group of people as we said on Sunday the
[32:00] people Satan's probably going to get you
[32:01] to bow the most are people right of the
[32:03] church right you know you'll have
[32:05] enemies outside the church but Satan
[32:07] loves to come in he loves the spoil the
[32:09] fellowship the godly fellowship amongst
[32:12] a believer so we want to be we want to
[32:15] be right the post of duty program still
[32:17] above all else he's an honor God in this
[32:18] house that he said above all else love
[32:20] one another so we want to love one
[32:22] another by God's grace and we're doing
[32:24] that tonight by God's grace by gathering
[32:27] in the house of the Lord so he hates
[32:29] Satan hates the expose of his plans to
[32:32] steal kill and destroy he has those
[32:35] plans to steal from believers to kill
[32:37] believers and destroy their lives you
[32:41] know as I was reading through these
[32:44] quotes there's I found six quotes on the
[32:46] trail of the serpent they all go from
[32:48] October of 65 to December of 65 I
[32:52] remember brother Graham died on New
[32:53] Year's or Christmas Eve 1965 we have six
[32:56] quotes so this is a thought he had
[32:58] developing for about three months
[32:59] October November and December and said
[33:02] when he got back to Jeffersonville he
[33:03] was going to preach a four-hour sermon
[33:05] on the trail of the serpent he's going
[33:07] to call it the Beast at the beginning
[33:09] and the beast at the end and so I want
[33:11] to read through a few of these clothes
[33:12] but I the stock came to me one time now
[33:16] guy had a book out of the
[33:17] Malka I will cry have to help in just a
[33:19] minute but there was three types of
[33:22] trails that certain that snakes left one
[33:25] was a straight trail a Malachi said the
[33:27] bigger the snake is the straighter the
[33:29] trail is the second one was was about a
[33:33] side minding okay the side line and
[33:38] that's that's a poisonous snake like
[33:41] wider rattlesnake okay so that's up so
[33:43] if you see a trail that and the sand
[33:44] like that that's usually a poisonous
[33:46] snake what was the other one well this
[33:48] is snake side when he's kind of lifting
[33:52] the body over sand one of them lives in
[33:58] one of them so they're side to side but
[33:59] no one just goes straight forward so
[34:01] it's interesting there's three main
[34:03] tracks and Satan steal kills and
[34:06] destroys and there's three levels of
[34:08] temptation right the lust of the eyes
[34:10] the pride of life and lust the flesh and
[34:13] that's strike it well what is it they're
[34:15] all they're all the same dirty snakes
[34:17] now most people have a phobia of snakes
[34:20] right because I've never said because
[34:22] it's a figure of Satan and because
[34:25] that's where sin came in in the
[34:26] beginning so that's just something you
[34:30] want to see there the snake has three
[34:32] different types of trails and there's
[34:35] three avenues that Satan works in right
[34:37] as we just saw less than the eyes less
[34:38] the flesh and the pride of life all
[34:40] temptation comes through those channels
[34:43] so I think it's very it's very a good
[34:46] teaching a very good type of Satan and
[34:48] his works and let me read these quotes
[34:51] out this one hit the highlights here
[34:53] this isn't power transformation October
[34:55] 31st Halloween night for then now he
[35:00] says don't forget this little flag the
[35:02] church in the last days is going to be
[35:04] twins so close it'll be the see the very
[35:07] left in Mathew 24:24 the church is going
[35:11] it's a Pentecostal move it's so much
[35:13] like the real thing so would this seems
[35:15] a very lectern if it were possible and a
[35:18] little later on if I get a chance I
[35:19] would explain that how that election
[35:21] comes it's going to deceive them because
[35:23] it's almost like the same thing see just
[35:26] two fathers
[35:27] good he says that's all say mother st.
[35:30] charts
[35:31] movement same thing the betting drives
[35:32] is the same where the word falls one of
[35:35] them but one of them like here is
[35:38] perverted so do you see that there's one
[35:41] betting ground but there's two fathers
[35:42] that remind you of Jesus Matthew 13
[35:45] remember the parable the parable of the
[35:47] field and the wheat and the tares
[35:49] there's one field two different sewers
[35:52] Jesus said that was like it unto the
[35:55] world the Sun man was the good seller
[35:57] and the man in black was Satan and
[36:01] they're sewing their seeds in one field
[36:04] right and that field is the world right
[36:06] so we have believers and unbelievers two
[36:09] fathers in one field jesus said the good
[36:11] seat of the Turner of the kingdom and he
[36:14] will see the tares are the bad seed or
[36:17] the children of destruction we know that
[36:18] and also the type of the Garden of Eden
[36:21] where you had one field Eve and you had
[36:24] two different so where's the serpent and
[36:26] you had Adam that's right now that's
[36:31] what the Prophet says now he said it's
[36:33] going to be a Pentecostal move now did
[36:35] you ever think of that church it's going
[36:37] to be so close what's the prophecy for
[36:40] our day the prophecy is that the bride
[36:42] asked to look just like what Pentecost
[36:45] right now state the Lord the pharmacist
[36:48] of Pentecost must be in the bride so
[36:49] she's got to have the power she's got to
[36:51] have the doctor she's got to have the
[36:52] word the holiness all these things but
[36:55] Satan's gonna copy that and they're
[36:57] gonna have some type of anointing right
[36:59] the Bible said to have live signs and
[37:02] wonders right now some type of with Nike
[37:05] and here the Bible said false Christ's
[37:07] right the word Christ means The Anointed
[37:09] One
[37:10] but Jesus added the S on the end to
[37:12] Christ and now we have Christ's plural
[37:15] which is also anointed ones their
[37:18] anointed with the true sphere from times
[37:20] but then they're going to it the false
[37:22] spirit but the true believer is going to
[37:24] be anointed with the true spirit all the
[37:26] time and then we'll have a few mistakes
[37:28] here and there and some things will trip
[37:30] up and fall but the true believer is
[37:32] going to have the true anointing all the
[37:34] time being there but the false the make
[37:37] believers can have a shrewd electing
[37:38] some time and then the posture no - and
[37:40] it's for deception
[37:43] once for murder
[37:44] so we're going to expect the false
[37:47] church to come out of I'm sorry we're
[37:49] going to expect the falsey to come out
[37:50] of the church there there there field
[37:53] there a woman so both churches are going
[37:56] to are both people will see they're
[37:57] going to be in churches that's what the
[37:59] Prophet tells us but one has the word
[38:02] and the other one has a perverted word
[38:04] he says now and I go home this time I've
[38:07] preached on the subject the trail the
[38:09] serpent the beast at the beginning and
[38:11] the beast at the end the trail and trail
[38:15] him right through the Bible and show how
[38:19] he heads up so what's heads up me show
[38:21] how he looks at the end so my man's
[38:23] design was a show Safet in the beasts at
[38:25] the beginning and then to show him at
[38:28] the end
[38:28] praise God he said just watch how
[38:33] cunning that fellow is well they're like
[38:36] the Judas and Jesus they're both
[38:38] brothers in their tribe like Esau and
[38:39] Jacob and the crow in the Dove sitting
[38:42] in the same roof everything is a twin in
[38:45] this great warfare that we're sin again
[38:47] amens did you realize that I'm too big
[38:49] your true believer tonight well guess
[38:51] what you've got a twin thanks God
[38:53] someone's trying to mimic your life if
[38:56] you're a true believer you're walking in
[38:57] faith walking by the word Satan's trying
[39:00] to limit your life and you've got a twin
[39:02] somewhere
[39:03] oh my Jesus had a twin ah headaches when
[39:06] Moses had a twin every all the true
[39:08] believers have a twin but the one
[39:11] difference will be those who stay with
[39:12] the Word of God you know that amen but
[39:15] perhaps on the enemy uses deception and
[39:18] we don't want to have any deception I
[39:19] don't I'm not scared to preach any
[39:21] doctrine or brother brand on the left I
[39:23] don't want there to be any questions
[39:24] that's why I hand out those sheets if
[39:26] you've got a question bring it to me
[39:28] there should be no deception in our
[39:30] church you should know exactly what we
[39:31] believe exactly where we find the Bible
[39:33] because it should be all the Spirit of
[39:35] Truth thing that we've got major
[39:37] doctrines that we cannot prove it or
[39:39] something that you know we don't know it
[39:40] just set it on the shelf and perhaps
[39:42] gobbler revealing it is all the time
[39:45] that's right
[39:47] Loretta said in the second quote this
[39:49] isn't trying to go to service he talks
[39:51] about it again another for our sermon he
[39:53] said don't join up with those
[39:54] organizations one day I'm telling you
[39:56] don't
[39:57] the market the beach just remember it is
[40:00] the mark the lease from the beginning he
[40:03] was the beast the garden eating is a
[40:04] beast at the end to show that he's a
[40:06] religious person and the denomination
[40:09] and come right through this rail of it
[40:11] and proved you by the scriptures than it
[40:13] is I didn't know that - the Holy Spirit
[40:15] gave me the other day of their day men
[40:18] so the Holy Spirit showed brother
[40:20] branham that the Antichrist beast or
[40:23] spirit here is religious which we know
[40:25] and he'll come through a denomination
[40:28] it's exactly right now just skip the
[40:33] third quote as it just says the trail
[40:34] the serpent the fourth thing of the
[40:38] fourth quarter of a percent modern
[40:40] events make them our prophecy nothing
[40:42] against the people in the church but if
[40:45] the systems of the thing that's wrong
[40:47] with a preach of the trailer serpent
[40:48] listen to him you take the tapes now
[40:50] notice they missing the confirmation of
[40:52] the prophecies of God's Word being
[40:55] fulfilled so what does that mean the
[40:58] falsies will miss the prophecies that
[41:01] are for our day praise the Lord the
[41:03] prophecies about the fullness of
[41:05] Pentecost the prophecies about the move
[41:07] is on the rise now saith the Lord
[41:08] they're going to miss those prophecies
[41:10] and they're only going to want to get
[41:12] the anointing and power and church
[41:14] membership the ramps that are fighting
[41:17] for their churches they're not fighting
[41:19] for Christ praise God they're fighting
[41:22] for their churches they're more
[41:23] interested in their big buildings and
[41:25] big memberships and money than they
[41:28] really are about living the Word of God
[41:29] amen
[41:31] the 5th quote says this about the same
[41:33] thing I never received said I never want
[41:37] to have nothing to do with the
[41:38] organization he said if that ain't a
[41:42] Pharisee I never seen one Loretta tells
[41:44] the story he was going to pray for a
[41:46] sick person in the hospital a Nana they
[41:48] had curtains up you probably seen
[41:49] curtains up where they have curtains
[41:51] behind the you know in front of the sick
[41:52] people he was asking a family member can
[41:55] I go in and pray for your family member
[41:58] and the woman said he said remember
[42:01] she's had to pull that curtain
[42:02] the band was trying to get there he said
[42:04] quiet curtain and he sounded just like
[42:05] to offer prayer and she said we're
[42:07] Methodists we don't believe in divine
[42:09] healing he said
[42:11] at Curtin and that's what brother Graham
[42:13] said that's a Pharisee if I ever saw one
[42:17] seem more interested in their church
[42:20] than they are actually for the Word of
[42:23] God to be fulfilled like one of our
[42:25] precious brothers recently his family
[42:28] said if you don't come to our church
[42:29] we're cutting you off right what is that
[42:34] what kind of spirit is that rather than
[42:36] rejoicing and somebody will praise God
[42:38] there to church that's what we do right
[42:40] don't we do that
[42:40] praise God our families in the church
[42:42] let me start the church those that are
[42:44] in a church right it's better than a bar
[42:45] it's better than being drunk on the
[42:47] streets better than a prostitution house
[42:49] I've never gone but see that spirit of
[42:52] organization Senate it's either my
[42:54] church of the highway but we know
[42:56] different we know gonca right who all
[42:58] gather around the carcass of the word
[43:00] the endtime work but we also know God's
[43:02] got a foolish virgin as well we know
[43:06] it's a sea we know we don't hold people
[43:08] to our church it's not attracting us to
[43:10] us but all those Eagles that are hungry
[43:12] for the word will gather around the word
[43:14] Amen that's exactly right church
[43:17] provider I said that's the spirit behind
[43:20] the Antichrist oh you're not a Methodist
[43:23] don't pray for we don't believe in that
[43:25] you don't belong to our church stay out
[43:27] of that now I'm not saying that family
[43:29] home at that spirit but it sure looks
[43:30] like it if I would say if you don't come
[43:33] to my church you're going to hell that's
[43:35] wrong that's awful that's awful
[43:38] we don't want the spirit of the Pharisee
[43:41] because there are more in love with
[43:42] their churches their interpretation
[43:44] rather than God's interpretation we know
[43:47] that romance awaits you here the trailer
[43:52] surfer nothing
[43:53] now think now that their denomination is
[43:56] the only one that registers was with God
[43:58] that's what they think their church is
[43:59] the only London registers with God God
[44:01] no hearing unless you're Methodists or
[44:03] Baptists or Trinity or oneness or
[44:04] something like that but man said that's
[44:06] wrong last quote was from leadership 19
[44:11] I'm sorry
[44:12] December 7th 1965 and so actually the
[44:14] last full sermon he preached the last
[44:16] recorded part was communion at
[44:17] Peregrine's Church he spoke for 34
[44:20] minutes on communion but this is actual
[44:22] a sermon preached
[44:26] he says no he said it's coming to church
[44:30] and state again right on you you see
[44:32] your go right in there and you'll take
[44:34] the mark of the beast not knowing it if
[44:36] you ever bought one of my tapes get this
[44:38] when I get it
[44:39] when I get home the trail of a serpent
[44:41] and you'll see where it's at see where
[44:43] this ends of that all right separate
[44:47] like those quotes by God's grace but the
[44:49] man just laid out a few things that
[44:50] we're already familiar with like I said
[44:51] some of this will be familiar but I want
[44:53] to go through and I want to see through
[44:55] the bible quotes or scriptures about the
[44:58] beast and how he operates
[45:00] let's go to Genesis 3 we'll start right
[45:03] there by the grace of the Lord now this
[45:07] is all I - this has been all my - I've
[45:09] been studying the beast and the serpent
[45:11] and everything the last few months
[45:14] rather sorry Genesis chapter 3 now
[45:28] before me December program says serpent
[45:30] seed will not save anybody there we
[45:34] believe that you can still be saved even
[45:37] if you don't believe in the Serpent's
[45:38] seed but brother I said what does it do
[45:41] yeah actually actually said two things
[45:43] he said to the serpent see that's the
[45:44] killer right there that's the killer
[45:48] doctor where they can come to church for
[45:49] a while but would you stop preaching on
[45:51] the Serpent's eat manna that's the kill
[45:53] now to kill there or desire to come many
[45:55] times oh but my back said what does it
[45:59] do it doesn't save you but it shines
[46:01] more like upon what we're all trying to
[46:03] see what are we trying to see we're
[46:05] trying to see the truth of the atonement
[46:07] of crying then that's why Christ had to
[46:10] come by verge of birth because sin
[46:12] entered through a sexual act so God had
[46:14] to bypass that and bring Redemption
[46:17] through a virtual earth amen and then
[46:20] God was starting a new race the
[46:22] beginning of the creation of God the
[46:24] firstborn among many brethren I'm glad I
[46:26] was one of those many brethren and egg
[46:28] to be born again of God other than the
[46:31] gonna have the power of the Spirit in
[46:32] our lives they dead we ought to be
[46:34] thankful for that treatment how do you
[46:37] remember
[46:38] the serpent in verse 1 Genesis 3:1 the
[46:41] serpent was more subtle than all the
[46:43] beasts of the field the Lord our God had
[46:45] made sorry I got my pages stuck together
[46:48] now subtle means sly or crafty the
[46:53] serpent was the most crafty animal of
[46:56] all now what does he do Church he starts
[47:00] attacking the word oh yes God said
[47:04] you'll surely die so this is the Beast
[47:06] the beginning what's he doing he's
[47:09] misinterpreting the word to Eve I
[47:12] remember he was a standing upright man a
[47:14] man-like creature but madam said he was
[47:16] somewhere between the chimpanzee and a
[47:18] man right somewhere between there and
[47:21] the building and reasoning ability to
[47:23] talk and what happened when Graham said
[47:26] the fruit that even serpent partook of
[47:29] was the fruit of adultery that was the
[47:32] fruit they partook of and the doctors
[47:34] act and then program said that they had
[47:36] that act and then at one at some point
[47:38] later she went and took that fruit the
[47:41] knowledge of that act that sexual ation
[47:44] took it to Adam and they partook
[47:46] together what was Adam's sin the sin
[47:49] that wasn't necessarily the act the sin
[47:52] was that Adam hearkened unto his life
[47:56] praise God
[47:57] it's the same thing Abraham did that
[47:59] brought about Ishmael God chasin Adam
[48:05] because you and Abraham because you've
[48:07] hearkened unto the voice of that life
[48:09] now romantic ptosis at some point God
[48:12] would have told Adam had they stayed in
[48:14] sin or stayed in purity not sin rather
[48:16] he would have allowed her a lot of him
[48:19] to go into her but it wasn't the time in
[48:21] season so you see how God's got a time
[48:23] in season for everything hey he's got a
[48:26] time in season
[48:27] but Satan got in there first and
[48:30] injected his seed in there now I want to
[48:32] show this I don't know brother
[48:33] Adams uh pristineness we have an article
[48:35] from July 1994 from the Journal of
[48:38] forensic sciences that proves a woman
[48:41] can have relations with two different
[48:44] men after never cease and bring
[48:46] twins from two different seats so it's
[48:49] all in the video I put on our video
[48:51] today some on the video today but it
[48:54] says right there but female has
[48:55] intercourse with two males at short
[48:57] intervals within the same ovulatory
[48:59] period Superfund acacia make her so
[49:03] that's a fancy word for for that
[49:04] whatever that is the results show that
[49:06] each twin to come from a different
[49:08] father so this is clearly backed up by
[49:10] by science and remember I think I'm
[49:14] preaching out low to go that scientists
[49:18] found DNA and snakes remember that that
[49:21] they had DNA to build arms the legs at
[49:23] one point that pollution says I'll see
[49:27] them they evolved but by the way there's
[49:29] no ok God Kirsten God took the arms and
[49:32] legs away chief of Medicine changed
[49:34] every bone in the body and put him on
[49:36] his belly it's exactly right amen praise
[49:42] the Lord
[49:43] now remember the beast was cursed the
[49:47] serpent was cursed but God never curse
[49:49] Adam and Eve why cuz God doesn't curse
[49:51] his children for he's God the Bible said
[49:54] the ground was cursed for Adam sing
[49:56] right did they have punishments yes they
[49:59] had punishments but they were punished
[50:01] Eve was punished in her reproductive
[50:03] parts and she was punished and
[50:06] reproduction of seed why because with
[50:09] God the punishment fits the crime
[50:11] an eye for an eye tooth for tooth right
[50:14] a foot for a foot leg for a leg right
[50:17] David remember David David put the sword
[50:22] in your Icehouse and God said because
[50:24] you had this sword in your Icehouse the
[50:26] sword will not depart from your house
[50:28] all the days of your life because you
[50:30] slept with your eyes wife secretly
[50:32] someone will sleep with your eyes
[50:34] publicly and that's what his son Absalom
[50:36] did so see the punishment fits the crime
[50:39] are you with me
[50:41] so her punishment was in her private
[50:44] parts her loins
[50:45] because that's what that's what that's
[50:47] the mistakes she made she took the wrong
[50:49] seed so in bringing for seed there was
[50:51] always going to be a
[50:52] pain and remind her of what she did did
[50:55] everybody see that by God's grace amen
[50:57] hope you can see that by the grace of
[50:58] the Lord amen now revelation 12:7 let's
[51:03] whatever you got your Bible revelation
[51:04] 12:7 I'm actually going to go out of
[51:08] order is this is the actual this is the
[51:10] trailer this actually the Serpent's
[51:12] first action revelation 12:7 says is
[51:15] first actually I just thought I start in
[51:17] Genesis everybody feeling good tonight
[51:21] by God's grace if I feel good we love
[51:24] the Lord tonight in any lorry relation
[51:27] 12 7 and there was a war in heaven
[51:29] Michael his angels fought against the
[51:31] Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[51:33] angels and prevailed not neither was
[51:37] their place found any more in heaven and
[51:39] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[51:42] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[51:44] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[51:46] out of the earth and his angels were
[51:48] cast out with him so here is actually
[51:51] the first recording of that least write
[51:54] of Satan he starts to award heaven he
[51:58] splits the church he wants to exalt his
[52:00] stars above the stars of God so go to
[52:03] Isaiah 14 I don't know if my children
[52:06] I've ever read these scripts yourself if
[52:08] it's not for you the adults then hope
[52:10] for the children by God's grace because
[52:12] they need to know these scriptures they
[52:13] met Isaiah 14 verse 12 verse 12
[52:30] Hartnell fallen from heaven o Lucifer
[52:32] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[52:33] to the ground which didn't weaken the
[52:36] nations for the I said in my heart I
[52:40] will ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[52:42] throne above the stars with God I will
[52:44] also sit up on the Mount of the
[52:45] congregation in the sides of the north
[52:48] so what does he want to do he wants to
[52:50] be above God he wants to worship Him he
[52:52] wants to go where he wants the honor but
[52:54] the way to be honor with God is to
[52:56] humble yourself but he wants to keep
[52:59] exalting himself more attention and more
[53:02] adoration but the
[53:04] get it is to humble yourself I will
[53:07] ascend above the heights of the clouds I
[53:09] will be like the Most High yet thou
[53:11] shalt be brought down to hell to the
[53:13] sides of the pit they--this see these
[53:16] linearity look upon me and considerably
[53:18] saying is this the man that made the
[53:20] earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms
[53:23] that made the world as a wilderness and
[53:25] destroy the cities there up and open not
[53:27] the house of the prisoners look at this
[53:29] I hope we can have that thought tonight
[53:32] compared to Christ's sake it is just a
[53:34] little man that weakened the nation's
[53:36] for medicine he's got no power except
[53:38] what you've given right so that's gonna
[53:41] get us ain't any powder let's not give
[53:43] Satan any evil thoughts let's not give
[53:45] Satan any confession of well I'm sick or
[53:47] or this will never happen let's give God
[53:50] all the glory
[53:51] let's give God all the power because
[53:53] they're all good-looking centers that's
[53:55] the man
[53:55] now we know program say you're no match
[53:57] for me so let's not make fun of sickness
[54:00] not do those types of things but let's
[54:02] remember greater is the Holy Ghost in me
[54:04] than he that's in the world today the
[54:06] head the Holy Ghost inside of us should
[54:09] not fear the enemy we should resist him
[54:12] and then Satan will flee from us amen
[54:16] on the new young oh there we go that's
[54:19] resisting tonight amen
[54:21] let's cast out any thought is exhausted
[54:22] so against the words of God amen I'm a
[54:24] child of God we come to God's able to
[54:27] feed on God's Word I come to worship God
[54:29] will cast out anything that distracts us
[54:31] from worshiping God Amen under there
[54:34] yeah that's exactly right
[54:36] amen all right next let's go back to
[54:42] Genesis 4 let's go back to Genesis
[54:44] forward Cain and Abel the next step of
[54:47] the circuit the next trail we see him
[54:50] with blood on his hands Genesis 4 now
[55:02] we're premiere with this Kane offers a
[55:04] sacrifice it's not free it's not
[55:08] accepted by God and we saw him Sunday I
[55:10] brought up those quotes from victory day
[55:12] but the random said Cain should have
[55:14] went like this instead of getting angry
[55:17] a table for the RAM said he should have
[55:19] stood there and said wonderful brother
[55:21] Abel you found the right buddy to
[55:23] worship now we could all be accepted
[55:26] hallelujah
[55:27] but instead he got upset what do you
[55:29] mean that's my brother I hate you he got
[55:33] upset instead of saying praise God we
[55:35] found the way amen
[55:37] see instead of being happy for somebody
[55:40] it's blessed he got jealous and brother
[55:42] Graham said that's what starts every
[55:43] more jealousy you saw that on Victory
[55:46] Day on Sunday we preached on
[55:47] Independence Day and looked at the
[55:49] American Revolution I love you but that
[55:51] was a good message to me how about every
[55:53] officer doing that because I got
[55:55] independence in Christ amen I'm gonna be
[55:58] independent from all churches I'm in the
[56:00] better football creeds and I'm solely
[56:02] dependent upon Christ amen but see
[56:05] jealousy is what starts and when we see
[56:10] somebody get blessed and set up being
[56:11] disturbed we should say praise God I
[56:13] believe I might be next
[56:15] my miracle might be next amen oh yeah
[56:19] that's right good but see Cain he got
[56:22] upset and his countenance set up so
[56:25] before he was happy and now all the time
[56:28] he said so be careful how we look then
[56:29] we come to house of God be careful what
[56:31] our face looks like when we see one
[56:33] another right out of it or come as Joyce
[56:36] remain happy joyful positive right
[56:40] thankful if I was going to be thankful
[56:42] in all things we all get discouraged but
[56:45] let's take encouragement amen
[56:47] let's let's make sure our countenance is
[56:48] the right comments now notice in verse 7
[56:52] God said if you do well Cain know modes
[56:57] if you obey like Abel
[56:58] won't you be accepted and if thou doest
[57:01] not well sin lies at the door so see
[57:03] sins gonna be waiting outside your
[57:04] dwelling place oh you're not gonna be
[57:06] able to stay get your sin you're gonna
[57:07] be a slave to sin and I'm to these shall
[57:10] be his desire not shout rule over in so
[57:13] notice again God tries to correct Cain
[57:16] Cain doesn't take direction so if you
[57:18] see how important it is that you can be
[57:20] corrected at church Cain will not he
[57:23] won't be corrected by the Holy Spirit
[57:26] right so sin is going to remain there
[57:28] he's going to keep having around
[57:30] countenance
[57:30] he's going to be up Rauf he's going to
[57:32] be upset and what does it lead to Church
[57:34] to sin lieth at the door or to lead to
[57:35] he took that st. it might and killed his
[57:37] brother because it was laying right
[57:39] there his door see if we don't cast it
[57:42] down it's going to remain in our lives
[57:44] we got to live up here - man you gotta
[57:46] have minds that are pure from roots of
[57:48] bitterness see how this bitterness took
[57:50] a root in his life right how we need the
[57:54] Holy Spirit every hour amen
[57:55] so God says this is the way to do it if
[57:58] you do it you'll rule over your brother
[58:00] because he's the firstborn of the twins
[58:01] but he turned down he turned down ruling
[58:05] because he didn't want to Humble himself
[58:06] and obey what would that look like today
[58:09] that looked like today somebody that's
[58:10] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[58:12] somebody saying well I don't have to act
[58:14] like that or I don't have to live like
[58:15] that why do I live like that why can I
[58:17] enjoy whatever I'm not gonna get rid of
[58:19] all that I want to enjoy my worldly life
[58:21] and God will leave with them sermon
[58:24] after sermon after sermon given up but
[58:27] when they all in a row that seed of
[58:29] iniquity will grow into something evil
[58:31] pretty soon you'll find the haughty evil
[58:33] in their life brother cam had a man that
[58:36] went to a church went to his church for
[58:39] a while got baptized obeyed after a few
[58:42] years he found something didn't like and
[58:44] church it was in the news we got all the
[58:45] news pretty soon he fell in love with a
[58:48] girl and then we'll need a message she
[58:49] pulled him away and later she framed him
[58:53] for child abuse and house servant almost
[58:55] 20-some years in prison and broke both
[58:58] came inside and reached out and said see
[59:00] you shouldn't have we told you not to go
[59:01] with this girl this but it started off
[59:04] with doubting and disbelieving parts of
[59:06] the message and then got pulled away
[59:08] into an ungodly relationship how can two
[59:11] walk together except they be agreed
[59:13] first of our so see we we can see that
[59:18] and who thought this is one of the
[59:20] nicest brothers when I go into church he
[59:22] had the biggest smile he was hugging me
[59:24] sending out the message all these things
[59:25] like that but what pulled him away
[59:27] unbelief unbelief
[59:29] not willing to obey all the Word of God
[59:32] Church he must be willing to keep every
[59:34] word amen when the Holy Spirit speak to
[59:36] us let's obey grace God it'll lead to
[59:39] something like that all over the news
[59:41] out there in Toledo frayed and
[59:44] that's what he said framed for child
[59:46] abuse but see what happens when you
[59:48] don't honor God oh my
[59:51] now remember Kane and verse 9 says I
[59:55] don't know where able this Eli's in the
[59:58] face of God so see there's another
[1:00:00] there's another attribute of the serpent
[1:00:03] see they lie to God's face right they
[1:00:08] don't obey they lie and then what they
[1:00:10] happened murder murder happened next we
[1:00:12] know that all right let's keep pilin
[1:00:14] Timmy go to first Peter 3:20 go to first
[1:00:17] Peter 3:20 we keep following that
[1:00:19] serpent we know he goes through the
[1:00:21] Giants in the days of Noah but we'll get
[1:00:24] to nap first Peter 3:20
[1:00:34] he's got three different trails lust of
[1:00:38] the eyes less than a flash and pride of
[1:00:39] life man he's got three different trails
[1:00:42] can always tell what one looks like
[1:00:45] mercy first Peter 3:21 you look like
[1:00:49] here in the days of Noah now remember
[1:00:52] Jesus went to preach through the spirits
[1:00:55] that were in prison verse 20 which
[1:00:56] sometimes were disobedient when once
[1:00:59] this long-suffering of God waited the
[1:01:01] days of Noah while the ark was a
[1:01:03] preparing wherein few that is eight
[1:01:05] souls were saved by water you see the
[1:01:07] serpent there what'd he do he caused
[1:01:09] them to be disobedient to know his
[1:01:11] message right and then Jesus because he
[1:01:15] was waiting just waiting well anybody
[1:01:17] else get the ark but anybody else get
[1:01:18] the art I want him to get the art I'll
[1:01:20] have to act like you holding rollers I
[1:01:22] have to get the ark away from all my
[1:01:24] worldly treasures why you talking about
[1:01:26] it's never even flood before this is
[1:01:30] lift I guarded but we're upset the art
[1:01:31] today is Christ we got to get into
[1:01:33] Christ in heaven you got to get into
[1:01:35] Christ of the scale all things of the
[1:01:37] road you got to be shut in with Christ
[1:01:38] as the holy some holidays amen yes
[1:01:41] exactly right oh you're too much about
[1:01:44] isolationist well we got to we got to
[1:01:46] get in the Christ you've got to be
[1:01:47] isolated from sin I've got to be present
[1:01:49] not equal Jesus you say that actually
[1:01:51] rival one seat disobedient so the
[1:01:54] serpent got them just disobedient to
[1:01:56] entering into
[1:01:58] disobedient and what the Bible say the
[1:02:00] days of Noah they were eating drinking
[1:02:02] Mary give it at marriage right
[1:02:04] Mary see married relationships are more
[1:02:07] important than getting in the ark right
[1:02:09] bill you know building the right kind of
[1:02:11] we'd say house you know Billy right kind
[1:02:14] of business building or whatever all
[1:02:18] these things were more important than
[1:02:20] putting God's house first amen
[1:02:22] get in the house of God that's right
[1:02:24] disobedience so Satan allows this group
[1:02:28] did this be deceived to disobey Noah
[1:02:31] here's what you're not liking I think
[1:02:33] you like this go to Genesis 28 I'm sorry
[1:02:37] Genesis 27 forget let me show you a real
[1:02:43] burden of a mother I was going to I
[1:02:44] think I might reach us on Mother's Day I
[1:02:46] don't know now this year this job's in
[1:02:49] Lima on Mother's Day I don't feel like
[1:02:50] Reese's I might have been last year this
[1:02:53] is the scripture always come as my heart
[1:02:55] when I think about Mother's Day Genesis
[1:02:57] 27 let's go to Jacob and Esau Genesis 27
[1:03:07] verse 46
[1:03:09] 27:46 I hope this is good for both your
[1:03:14] mothers and fathers the parents this is
[1:03:17] a good scripture for everybody know this
[1:03:22] is Rebecca and Isaac young the children
[1:03:25] taking a nice tall look what Rebecca
[1:03:26] says the Isaac I am weary of my life
[1:03:29] because of the daughters of hath so she
[1:03:32] feels like she's gonna die so I'm losing
[1:03:33] her strength if Jacob take a wife of the
[1:03:36] daughters of half which were heathens
[1:03:37] such as these which are the daughters of
[1:03:40] the land
[1:03:40] what good shall my life do me look at
[1:03:44] this uh Rebecca says if my son Jacob
[1:03:48] takes the heathen life what was the
[1:03:50] purpose of me living because his wife
[1:03:54] will influence him away from the message
[1:03:56] of the our church you see that and it
[1:04:00] works he's away oh good godly woman
[1:04:01] could marry and I'm godly man hey not
[1:04:04] yours either way but look at the heart
[1:04:06] of a real mother don't so that the
[1:04:07] hardware
[1:04:09] hey my life means nothing if my tutor
[1:04:12] don't serve god that's how he should
[1:04:14] feel if my family doesn't get to say
[1:04:15] look good that's my life man if I can't
[1:04:17] win some souls bucket is my life and we
[1:04:19] want to see people serve God we should
[1:04:21] have a burden for amen Levin said you
[1:04:24] should have a desperation that's what we
[1:04:26] should have a desperation mother do you
[1:04:29] know and a desperation prevention is
[1:04:30] motivated by love so if you're not
[1:04:32] desperate for so more love of God amen
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:36] gotta give us more of us a lot of amen
[1:04:39] so want to get more souls to the house
[1:04:41] of God now in the nick of the next
[1:04:46] chapter verse 8 28 verse 8 this is why
[1:04:50] the Bible said God hated Esau now Jacob
[1:04:53] had already stole the blessing right you
[1:04:54] know he stole the blessing the
[1:04:56] birthright blessing and then the other
[1:04:57] blessing he stole two blessings the
[1:04:59] number blessing the diverse eight says
[1:05:03] so when Esau lost his birthright and
[1:05:06] lost all the physical blessings from his
[1:05:09] family that followed the message of the
[1:05:11] hour
[1:05:11] look what he does next he knows that his
[1:05:14] mother once Jacob to marry a godly woman
[1:05:17] not a even but a real believer and Esau
[1:05:21] seeing that the daughters of Canaan
[1:05:22] please not Isaac his father what he did
[1:05:27] then when Esau unto Ishmael and took
[1:05:30] unto the wives which he had how laugh
[1:05:35] the daughter of ishmael abraham's son
[1:05:37] the sister of need a job to be his wife
[1:05:41] you see that when Esau lost any physical
[1:05:45] blessing any monetary inheritance he'd
[1:05:47] say when he once he lost the bless of
[1:05:49] money to his family that he purposely
[1:05:53] went to spite them
[1:05:54] that's called malice George that's
[1:05:57] called balance which is the ill-will
[1:05:58] does every understand he reacts in
[1:06:01] malice I'm no longer getting the
[1:06:03] blessing the money for my family because
[1:06:05] Jacob took it from me so I'm gonna do
[1:06:08] something just to make them mad and I'm
[1:06:12] gonna go take a he's and wife and it's
[1:06:14] already recorded that his mother said if
[1:06:16] Jacob got married a believer what good
[1:06:18] is my life so see
[1:06:21] on the cerfancy tax there if I was said
[1:06:23] God Hannity so why do hate you saw
[1:06:26] well first right here because he we saw
[1:06:28] right here because he did
[1:06:30] despite them his parents he did an honor
[1:06:33] his mother and father aren't you glad
[1:06:34] you honored your mother father praise
[1:06:36] God I am to whatever degree I could I'm
[1:06:38] glad I hired my mother and father what
[1:06:41] was the other thing he sold out the
[1:06:43] birthright for food right you sort out
[1:06:47] her birthright
[1:06:47] just like Judith sells it out he didn't
[1:06:50] think he had no confidence that God
[1:06:52] could just help him to get over his
[1:06:54] hunger so he sold out his connection in
[1:06:57] the Messiah his connection to the next
[1:06:59] trip to be the next generation leader
[1:07:01] let me say this he sought out the
[1:07:03] Ministry of the Holy Spirit for a meal
[1:07:05] ticket
[1:07:07] praise God let me tell you this for a
[1:07:10] denominational meal to you can I say
[1:07:11] like that he could have been connected
[1:07:13] to the message the our leading the
[1:07:14] family but he saw the same thing his
[1:07:17] King right could have led the ferry
[1:07:19] could be the leader but turned down the
[1:07:21] spiritual leadership or natural blessing
[1:07:23] that's Judas right there and through
[1:07:25] through selling out the truth for money
[1:07:29] that's myself rather gather with a bunch
[1:07:30] of holy rollers tonight even if there's
[1:07:33] only a handful of them that be in some
[1:07:34] big denominational Church with big money
[1:07:36] all things like that
[1:07:37] why cuz we're just like we're just like
[1:07:39] Jacob Amen we want the birthright we
[1:07:41] wouldn't be connected to Christ me
[1:07:42] believe he's coming where his people
[1:07:44] they don't hate men we're the people of
[1:07:47] the Messiah we're his children
[1:07:49] hallelujah we're the ones who are part
[1:07:51] of the kingdom of God amen
[1:07:52] it's not my money it's not buy these
[1:07:54] things it's my prayer and obedience to
[1:07:56] the Word of God how to do you we've
[1:08:00] never seen this we don't have time but
[1:08:02] in Hebrews 12 verse
[1:08:05] we're met her me Hebrews 12:16 Esau was
[1:08:09] also a fornicator
[1:08:11] which means the sexual sit before
[1:08:13] marriage and then he also had multiple
[1:08:16] wives now I know at this time Abraham
[1:08:18] had already had him but he took he
[1:08:20] started getting more and more lives so
[1:08:22] there's danger with that now I'm told
[1:08:23] some of their danger taking multiple
[1:08:25] wives so see what he did he had some
[1:08:28] sexual sins right and he also in malice
[1:08:33] and
[1:08:34] it will tortoise parents and purposely
[1:08:36] married offside the faith and we see
[1:08:39] that with many message people right they
[1:08:41] grow up in the message kids and now
[1:08:43] purposely because they're against the
[1:08:44] Word of God they'll go marry outside the
[1:08:46] faith despite the Word of God now I hope
[1:08:49] there I hope there's some salvation for
[1:08:51] those people yet hope they repent get
[1:08:53] right with God but that's a Esau act to
[1:08:56] disregard the training you've been
[1:08:59] raised up in is an act of Esau not have
[1:09:01] mercy on Seoul to do that now the next
[1:09:06] one was most how many Moses had a couple
[1:09:08] twins he had a couple twins yeah Balaam
[1:09:10] and Cora we know what Balaam Balaam was
[1:09:13] pretty throw money right middle of that
[1:09:15] little head repeatedly Cora though
[1:09:17] remember Claire stop chorus thought was
[1:09:20] that we're all holy we can all be
[1:09:22] priests that was his thought you're not
[1:09:25] the leader Moses God doesn't have a
[1:09:27] one-man message a one prophet message
[1:09:29] and a priesthood we all can be priests
[1:09:32] and God so hated that thought that he
[1:09:37] swallowed them up in the earth praise
[1:09:39] the Lord and I'm time to put that one up
[1:09:41] but it's in the Book of Numbers God the
[1:09:42] swaddle of Korah because he said we're
[1:09:44] all holy and he said Moses you did this
[1:09:48] up your own thinking so he accused Moses
[1:09:51] I'm starting to church himself with his
[1:09:53] own with his own thoughts and Moses the
[1:09:56] Bible said most in it didn't blast him
[1:09:57] Moses fell on his face Moses started
[1:10:01] interceding Moses said have mercy is
[1:10:04] that how we feel Church where people
[1:10:05] speak against us we should plead for
[1:10:07] mercy we should go right to our knees in
[1:10:08] there so see he had his twins as well
[1:10:13] Balaam saw visions how these
[1:10:15] supernatural events and all these things
[1:10:16] like that but he sold out God for money
[1:10:19] chloro as well God God can use anybody
[1:10:22] God can use any of us and he was
[1:10:24] fighting against the real priesthood so
[1:10:27] be careful let's not fight against
[1:10:28] brother branham grace god we don't know
[1:10:31] he's a human we all know he made
[1:10:33] mistakes but he never made a mistake
[1:10:34] with us save the lord and identify and
[1:10:39] that's the spirit we see live today is
[1:10:40] worshiping mother granny
[1:10:42] so let's not worship brother Branham
[1:10:45] well we can't do without it because he's
[1:10:47] one of them
[1:10:48] he's the star he's the star for our day
[1:10:49] we can't do without it all right now
[1:10:53] let's play let's try to go quickly here
[1:10:55] I got about 20 minutes okay that's
[1:10:56] plenty time all right
[1:10:58] never to see this round the serpent so
[1:10:59] far hope this isn't too much of review
[1:11:01] but I just want to bridge this I felt
[1:11:02] inspired I saw a couple of witnesses
[1:11:04] hope it's okay by God's grace trust your
[1:11:06] being will that seen it now Matthew 3
[1:11:10] verse 7 let's read that Matthew 3% I'm
[1:11:12] going to skip the Old Testament I had a
[1:11:13] few more by kya and it has prophets and
[1:11:16] Jess about but I kind of been preaching
[1:11:18] on those lately with the Jezebel and the
[1:11:19] Turk ages and Thyatira I kind of preach
[1:11:21] on that recently let's go to matthew 3:7
[1:11:28] matthew 3:7 never like to read that for
[1:11:30] me okay when he saw many of the
[1:11:37] Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
[1:11:39] baptism he said to them o generation of
[1:11:42] vipers who hath warned you to flee from
[1:11:44] the wrath to come they've had because of
[1:11:47] a bunch of snakes Graham said what kind
[1:11:49] of preachers manners is that right and
[1:11:53] we all want to pass through so or
[1:11:55] preachers so gentle and so kind but look
[1:11:59] at the spirit of lines in the spirit
[1:12:01] Elijah didn't pull any punches it's
[1:12:03] exactly right
[1:12:04] he called you generation of vipers he
[1:12:07] said bring forth fruits worthy of
[1:12:09] repentance in the next verse and the
[1:12:11] Bible said they wouldn't be baptized in
[1:12:13] John's baptism so they would come and
[1:12:16] watch the services in the message church
[1:12:18] and see the people repent get baptized
[1:12:21] but they themselves wouldn't enter in
[1:12:23] they would never leave their
[1:12:25] denomination to come all the way up god
[1:12:27] help us and sell lock stock and barrel
[1:12:29] amen he's helped us to do that praise
[1:12:32] God to sell out any connection and be
[1:12:34] fully committed a message of the hour
[1:12:36] praise God but these generation of
[1:12:39] vipers didn't do that they just came to
[1:12:42] watch and see huh that's interesting the
[1:12:44] sisters wear their hair like dad two
[1:12:46] brothers they wear clothes like that
[1:12:47] that's interesting but we just can't be
[1:12:50] a part of it Oh yellow-bellied Oh you
[1:12:54] generation of I four right Oh
[1:12:58] like the Bible said bring forth fruits
[1:13:00] worthy of repentance praise God while
[1:13:02] there's time seek God why he may be
[1:13:04] found
[1:13:05] amen he said the axe is laid to the root
[1:13:08] of the trees therefore every tree which
[1:13:12] bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
[1:13:15] down and cast into the fire his
[1:13:19] preaching just come right down didn't
[1:13:20] come right the helmet show them exactly
[1:13:22] where they were amen now Jesus and Judas
[1:13:26] mother have said this in 1962 Sardis
[1:13:29] church change which I was listen to this
[1:13:31] this week brother Randy said Judas was
[1:13:34] the son of Satan
[1:13:36] notice if you believe that the Bible
[1:13:39] said he was the son of perdition
[1:13:40] remember that is John 17 12 he was the
[1:13:44] son of perdition perdition means
[1:13:45] destruction so destruction had a son it
[1:13:48] was pinion mother have said it was Satan
[1:13:52] incarnate in Judas right and northern a
[1:13:55] they're both twins they're brother
[1:13:57] branham said judas killed jesus at the
[1:14:01] altar just like cain killed abel at the
[1:14:04] altar look Sam I'm Graham said both of
[1:14:07] them killed the other one right there
[1:14:10] and both of course had the spirit of
[1:14:14] murder on them because Satan fully
[1:14:16] possessed Judas and filled him just like
[1:14:20] Satan possessed Cain Cain was actually
[1:14:23] the genetic seed of the serpent but also
[1:14:25] of course have the wrong annoyed key
[1:14:27] because his County has changed the evil
[1:14:30] spirit came upon him and his countenance
[1:14:32] changed towards the Word of God that's
[1:14:34] right now these are some ones you might
[1:14:38] not been as familiar with but let's just
[1:14:40] hit a few more here by the grace of Lord
[1:14:41] in acts 13 a let's go there acts 13 8
[1:14:53] look at this beast slithering through
[1:14:55] the Bible say me what's the oyster tact
[1:14:58] he's always talking God's Word
[1:15:00] he's always talking to God his ministry
[1:15:02] he's always acting God's people
[1:15:04] he always won't line up with the four
[1:15:06] Word of God ah he's that make believer
[1:15:10] deceiver acts 13 8 now Paul this is Paul
[1:15:16] speaking to a Unitas the sorcerer let's
[1:15:19] go to verse 10 and said O full of all
[1:15:22] subtlety in all Bishop not Chadha the
[1:15:24] devil now enemy of all righteousness
[1:15:26] will now not search cease to pervert the
[1:15:29] right ways of the Lord
[1:15:31] now what was he doing he was just trying
[1:15:33] to get the coppersmith was it or the
[1:15:35] deputy I'm sorry he was just trying to
[1:15:37] get the deputy not to hear the preaching
[1:15:39] applause see that so now we see the
[1:15:42] Satan the Antichrist spirit just tries
[1:15:44] to keep people from hearing plain
[1:15:46] preaching the preaching of the message
[1:15:48] the hour that could be called the spirit
[1:15:51] of Satan don't go to that church don't
[1:15:53] go that stay away from brother Jesse
[1:15:55] I've had people tell me that I mean
[1:15:57] literally tell me that the churches have
[1:16:00] said stay away from him oh and I just
[1:16:03] laugh cuz under some burden you know
[1:16:05] buddy but it also shows I'm one of them
[1:16:08] one of those real believers right stay
[1:16:12] away from that church do evil things all
[1:16:16] they'll tell lies on you they'll do all
[1:16:18] these things like that but what do we
[1:16:20] preacher we're preaching the word of
[1:16:21] righteousness and holiness godliness and
[1:16:25] we're not just our thoughts as we've
[1:16:26] been saying we've got stuff saith Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ amen
[1:16:29] thus saith the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:16:32] that's something we're making up or a
[1:16:34] trap
[1:16:35] promoter own church or something like
[1:16:37] that we're promoting the kingdom of God
[1:16:39] amen so I'm glad to be one of them
[1:16:41] praise God but anybody that will keep
[1:16:43] you for me just hearing the word of God
[1:16:46] the prophet of the hour
[1:16:48] Paul says was a child of the devil
[1:16:51] and he had blindness first season right
[1:16:54] Paul also battled a few more let's go to
[1:16:57] Philippians 3 for the flippy industry
[1:17:00] here's another way looking is 3
[1:17:10] okay when I say flipping the three I
[1:17:12] think I've said 19 I didn't say that
[1:17:14] department here the penis 3:19 this one
[1:17:17] kind of came to my heart as I was
[1:17:18] preparing flipping it's 3:19 I'm sorry
[1:17:29] but I didn't look I thought well I'm
[1:17:31] sure he'll be there forgive me but
[1:17:32] forgive me I feel bad that's up let's
[1:17:37] put verse 17 flip means 3:17 I'm sorry
[1:17:40] but rather be followers together me and
[1:17:42] mark them which walk so as you had us
[1:17:45] for an example so really marked oh
[1:17:48] brother really walked the gospel make
[1:17:50] sure they live the gospel verse 18 where
[1:17:53] many block of whom I opposed often and
[1:17:55] not tell you even weeping that they are
[1:17:57] the enemies of the cross of Christ see
[1:18:01] if people are not the preachers are not
[1:18:02] walking just like Paul walk something's
[1:18:04] wrong with them well because Paul says
[1:18:07] they're walking but they're actually our
[1:18:08] enemies they look like they're walking
[1:18:11] for Christ verse 9 tells us whose end is
[1:18:15] destruction just like Judas he's set up
[1:18:17] destruction so preachers going to try to
[1:18:20] us into walking after Christ their end
[1:18:22] is destruction verse 19 whose God is
[1:18:23] their belly so what are they ultimately
[1:18:27] worship money right money to get the
[1:18:31] things you want to feed yourself that's
[1:18:33] who they're real goddess prince
[1:18:36] authority that's their God who's their
[1:18:39] God themselves they become their own God
[1:18:42] because that's what sickens idea is to
[1:18:43] make himself God so he makes death their
[1:18:46] own God so see pardon walk that way he
[1:18:49] wasn't his own God
[1:18:50] Paulo through hardships Paul sacrifice
[1:18:52] for the people praise God a human you
[1:18:55] know since he wasn't worshiping his own
[1:18:56] belly and whose glory is in their shame
[1:19:00] who mind earthly things
[1:19:03] so these false preachers had more
[1:19:05] concern about the earthly things than
[1:19:07] heavenly
[1:19:09] like we said popularity big churches big
[1:19:11] money oh mercy the love of money is the
[1:19:15] root of all evil
[1:19:17] they love money more than anything else
[1:19:19] God mercy
[1:19:22] both the givers 24-hour conversation is
[1:19:25] in heaven we're thinking about going to
[1:19:27] have been thinking about treasures in
[1:19:29] heaven
[1:19:32] alright that's a good one you like that
[1:19:34] one I thought that no you can see a
[1:19:35] preacher
[1:19:36] see that's why with these TV preachers
[1:19:38] always be careful I don't know I don't
[1:19:40] even listen to him because I know the
[1:19:42] money behind it right you just be very
[1:19:45] care they might have marital things like
[1:19:46] that i buy most of our blinds at the
[1:19:50] blind foul the blind now next one okay
[1:19:57] second Timothy to this withers okay 70
[1:20:11] to 79 Lou this I just want to bring this
[1:20:18] thought out the trail of the circuit
[1:20:20] look out there look just like a needy
[1:20:22] saw they sold it out for what their
[1:20:24] belly see that they sold it out Judas
[1:20:27] everybody just sold out for money watch
[1:20:30] that money no that's where the money
[1:20:32] goes they met
[1:20:33] watch where the money goes second
[1:20:35] Timothy 2:17 now I preached on this last
[1:20:39] year cankering verse 17 and there what
[1:20:45] word will eat as Duff a canker of whom
[1:20:48] is hymenaeus and philetus who concerning
[1:20:50] the truth have erred say that the
[1:20:52] resurrection has passed already and
[1:20:53] overthrow the faith of son these
[1:20:55] creatures were we'd say only saying that
[1:20:58] the resurrections already happened the
[1:20:59] raptures are connected and we're the
[1:21:01] Millennium right that's what some people
[1:21:04] believe today some people the message
[1:21:05] and some Catholics believe that that's
[1:21:07] what they believe they're not looking
[1:21:08] for the second coming of Christ I think
[1:21:09] you like they're already they're there
[1:21:11] because their kingdoms already on the
[1:21:12] earth but see but what the Bible said
[1:21:15] this kind of preaching eats like a
[1:21:17] canker
[1:21:18] the disease that will eat you all up one
[1:21:22] false doctrine will eat somebody all up
[1:21:25] see how we got to have true true time
[1:21:28] study yourself approved right the Bible
[1:21:30] said approve them to who God so when I
[1:21:33] preach something it should be such the
[1:21:35] Word of God that I know gobbling back it
[1:21:37] up amen I just animal saying that or
[1:21:40] sister bow a brother or sister do it
[1:21:43] that's not what I'm not trying to get
[1:21:45] all of you to agree with I hope you will
[1:21:46] but I want God to agree with amen
[1:21:49] I've got two or three witnesses I've got
[1:21:51] this to back me up because that's how
[1:21:52] you rightly divide the word amen three
[1:21:56] witnesses every word to be established
[1:21:57] and then these eleven years I by God's
[1:22:00] grace have appreciated foolish doctrine
[1:22:01] have I if I have meeting after service
[1:22:04] and let me know as far as I know never
[1:22:07] let anybody into sin never purposely
[1:22:09] told them to go to sin we tried to keep
[1:22:11] it right with the Word of God right now
[1:22:15] let's look at this one here there's a
[1:22:17] couple more okay second Peter 2 Peter 2
[1:22:22] verse 19 actually let's go to 18 second
[1:22:35] Peter 2 18 all right I got that eight
[1:22:39] minutes that's plenty time I think I'll
[1:22:41] kill you I'm swinging the highlights I
[1:22:44] may finish this next week or maybe not I
[1:22:47] think everybody can see the idea can't
[1:22:49] you all see the end of Satan you can
[1:22:51] just track him all the way through the
[1:22:52] Bible it's a lot of the same
[1:22:53] characteristics and how does this apply
[1:22:55] to us we don't want to act like that we
[1:22:58] don't want to fall in those three Trados
[1:23:01] those three temptations we want to live
[1:23:03] above that and a man because there's
[1:23:05] greater power to us it's the Holy Ghost
[1:23:08] but it's all for my been wanting to
[1:23:10] spend four hours I'm just gonna preach 1
[1:23:12] hour on it
[1:23:13] I could easily preach hours and hours on
[1:23:16] this if you went and read every
[1:23:17] scripture easily and there's something I
[1:23:19] left out like Zechariah you know Satan
[1:23:21] standing there right by Josh for the
[1:23:22] hikers remember that in Zechariah
[1:23:24] but God silences Satan and said Joshua's
[1:23:27] confess his sin give him new clothes
[1:23:29] amen and put on the garments of right
[1:23:32] God's forgiven him and they're saving
[1:23:33] time so he said who stands there tries
[1:23:36] to resist God's cleansing agents
[1:23:37] although we receive God's funding we
[1:23:40] receive God's forgiveness
[1:23:41] we received the white robes amen and
[1:23:43] righteousness forgiveness amen only
[1:23:46] gonna say men forgiveness of sins
[1:23:48] hallelujah amen look at verse 18 I
[1:23:52] preached on this one time maybe some
[1:23:55] people are here verse 18 for when they
[1:23:57] speak great swelling words of vanity
[1:23:59] see their preaching his soul is so
[1:24:01] swelling it's so great but they actually
[1:24:05] a lure through the lusts of the flesh so
[1:24:07] they preach such amazing words they say
[1:24:10] such amazing words but it's actually
[1:24:13] trying to lure you or attract to buy it
[1:24:15] lusts of the flesh so you can give your
[1:24:17] flesh when it wants like what does that
[1:24:20] mean it means like you can marry two or
[1:24:21] three or four times or you can buy that
[1:24:24] Mercedes Benz choice 1 right so you give
[1:24:28] it to the poor or you can do all this
[1:24:30] they preach says Oh God love you so much
[1:24:32] as the prosperity gospel right God loves
[1:24:34] you so much he wants you to have the
[1:24:35] best you want you to have the best
[1:24:37] spiritual riches amen how many spiritual
[1:24:41] riches is what he wants right because
[1:24:44] that's later see if you're rich and
[1:24:45] increased with Goods and you think you
[1:24:47] have me - nothing
[1:24:47] but you're blind rich I'm sorry you're
[1:24:50] blind wretched and poor and naked all
[1:24:52] these things and no one cannot see you
[1:24:55] so very be very careful now how do they
[1:24:59] allure through much one time that's
[1:25:01] that's laziness see that's not being
[1:25:04] diligent about keeping the word they
[1:25:05] don't put any effort oh just relax
[1:25:08] there's no need to sacrifice more for
[1:25:10] God you can just be one time just built
[1:25:14] your spiritual life slide a little bit
[1:25:17] after these great swelling words do see
[1:25:20] those that were clean escaped from them
[1:25:24] who live in error so see a clean person
[1:25:25] will escape that how the preacher my
[1:25:28] livers 19th is what I want to get to
[1:25:29] while they promise them Liberty they
[1:25:31] themselves are the servants of
[1:25:33] corruption so the very preachers who are
[1:25:35] saying God's giving you promises down
[1:25:37] getting your promises they're the same
[1:25:38] ones that are slaves to sin they cannot
[1:25:41] overcome sin they keep living in sin I'm
[1:25:43] glad to say over
[1:25:45] and I know you're glad you ever comes in
[1:25:47] that's one mark of a real Christian
[1:25:49] Church we're not slaves to sin and we
[1:25:52] don't promise things and not reach them
[1:25:54] we promise God's Word and if you've got
[1:25:56] faith you'll reach it how do they go
[1:25:59] like a trailer you wait 25 years you
[1:26:01] don't reach it eventually see them
[1:26:03] Abraham just keep hanging on the God's
[1:26:04] Word amen
[1:26:05] don't give up but see if they will never
[1:26:08] reach it they'll still be servants to
[1:26:10] their sins and the lusts of their flesh
[1:26:12] I hope you can see that church hope you
[1:26:15] can see that alright I got five minutes
[1:26:23] okay next slide let me this is my last
[1:26:25] slide now I know this is a lot of words
[1:26:28] I haven't time to really go through a
[1:26:29] ten but I want to focus on this right
[1:26:32] here then it's a satan's path the last
[1:26:34] 2,000 years
[1:26:36] we've already preached up to here so
[1:26:38] this so ah they weren't familiar with
[1:26:40] most of this so here you have the seven
[1:26:42] churches here's the seven turn chase
[1:26:44] down here you have the length and the
[1:26:46] messengers on here is this pretty
[1:26:47] familiar I would think it's pretty okay
[1:26:49] and here's the annoying things of the
[1:26:51] Holy Ghost a line anointing versus the
[1:26:53] white horse rider the accent I think and
[1:26:55] look there overlap programs that they
[1:26:56] overlap by a few years right the church
[1:26:59] ages and at certain years but but the
[1:27:01] anointings overlap Oxendine Kings
[1:27:04] sacrificed so you have lion baldness
[1:27:06] power of the Apostles and you have the
[1:27:07] Ox anointing sacrifice and you have the
[1:27:09] man jointing the intellectual and wisdom
[1:27:12] of the Holy Spirit to know right from
[1:27:13] wrong and now we got the Eagle 19 fly
[1:27:15] above all denominations and all Creed's
[1:27:18] well look now Satan work he started off
[1:27:20] with deeds it wasn't a teaching it was
[1:27:23] just such a tradition everybody did that
[1:27:26] was the beast in the beginning of the
[1:27:27] church ages then he had the synagogue of
[1:27:30] Satan then he had his own churches
[1:27:31] remember that he literally moved to a
[1:27:34] church became a church then they United
[1:27:36] church and state
[1:27:37] this is Constantine oh I'm sorry I mean
[1:27:39] hit the help TV like that sorry he
[1:27:43] married Church and stay in that he do it
[1:27:45] Balaam did he tried to unite the church
[1:27:47] with sinners and he did that and then
[1:27:50] the doctrine of the Nicolaitans they
[1:27:52] conquered the lazy by making all the
[1:27:54] priests the holy men but you're just as
[1:27:56] holy has any preachers
[1:27:58] don't let anybody tell you they're not
[1:27:59] unless you're not bored together you're
[1:28:01] bored again you're just as holy as any
[1:28:02] holy ghost of region eight and you've
[1:28:05] got just as much right to operate in
[1:28:06] your gift administering the Holy Spirit
[1:28:08] as a preacher done don't anybody conquer
[1:28:10] you because the Holy Ghost wants to use
[1:28:12] you and the Holy Ghost wants to conquer
[1:28:13] safe today how do we get raised up I'm
[1:28:16] not the only one that's anointed
[1:28:19] if you're born again you're fully
[1:28:21] anointed a need to operate our
[1:28:23] ministries in I want to say conquer this
[1:28:25] church I can't let that happen none of
[1:28:27] us other than happen and then for almost
[1:28:30] a thousand years 914 years Jezebel had a
[1:28:34] stranglehold upon most of the church now
[1:28:36] a woman who calls herself a prophetess
[1:28:38] right teaching Sue's My servants to
[1:28:41] commit fornication to worship idols so
[1:28:44] she should be came to a real powerful
[1:28:45] church and then they were living in the
[1:28:47] name of deficit the a just where we're
[1:28:49] getting to next Lord really
[1:28:50] I still feel let me go in back days a
[1:28:52] Martin Luther the true church was trying
[1:28:55] to hang on they had a name they're
[1:28:57] trying to be Christians but they weren't
[1:28:59] living the life so just a game a church
[1:29:02] membership right Church strikers and now
[1:29:04] this one I don't not polish up on that I
[1:29:06] don't remember that one so I don't match
[1:29:08] you might know if he's ready he might
[1:29:09] know that prepared me it's gonna last as
[1:29:12] I read nightmare but I'm still in this
[1:29:13] chapter I go to church in foot and we
[1:29:15] all know
[1:29:16] lukewarm we all know that right you're
[1:29:20] not hot for Jesus not cold but you're
[1:29:24] lukewarm and you feel like I don't have
[1:29:26] nothing anymore of God God loves me I'm
[1:29:29] all forgiving he does love you you can
[1:29:31] be forgiven but we must recognize you
[1:29:33] need more of God we need him every hour
[1:29:35] as the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:29:37] we need to stand there that's higher
[1:29:38] than him and the way we do it is draw
[1:29:41] nigh to God he draws nigh unto you
[1:29:43] there's only one way to go to God for us
[1:29:46] right so this is Satan
[1:29:48] this is Satan slithering not just a
[1:29:50] slippery there Satan slithering but the
[1:29:54] real believer has the anointing and a
[1:29:56] flying above it today we'll fly the bug
[1:29:58] and the trail of the serpent today love
[1:30:00] the Lord just not enough time Church and
[1:30:04] I'm gonna wear you out I know them I
[1:30:05] appreciate you sitting through this a
[1:30:06] lot of things you maybe heard before I
[1:30:08] just want to bring these this felt burn
[1:30:10] to preach this here tonight
[1:30:12] let me just go a few more here now what
[1:30:21] I have on here is AI from Jude Jude Jude
[1:30:24] calls out all the false preachers and
[1:30:26] then I got the whole book of Revelation
[1:30:29] the Beast of Revelation the woman tried
[1:30:31] to the beast right oh my and then you
[1:30:34] have the old serpent the see we see that
[1:30:36] serpent at the end in Revelation chapter
[1:30:38] 12 what she what's he trying to do he's
[1:30:41] trying to kill the Jews because the
[1:30:43] bride is already gone she was gonna the
[1:30:47] Beast was gonna hop on the bride right
[1:30:48] but Christ rescued his bride he sees her
[1:30:50] he snatched her out and the moment the
[1:30:52] other die snatched her early before
[1:30:55] Satan again could pounce on the bride so
[1:30:58] we had what does he do he goes after the
[1:31:00] next group the Jews and the fight will
[1:31:03] call him that old serpent Satan that
[1:31:05] deceives the whole world and then I was
[1:31:08] going to go brother mandersohn how does
[1:31:10] he head out over that quote
[1:31:11] how does he head up he heads up in the
[1:31:12] enter Christ and Sunday night he would
[1:31:14] just finish it in Daniel chapter 12 we
[1:31:16] saw all those other scriptures about the
[1:31:17] Antichrist he his policy his government
[1:31:22] would cause craft to prosper remember
[1:31:23] that he magnify himself by peace he
[1:31:27] destroyed many is what this is what this
[1:31:29] beast was gonna do at the end he's going
[1:31:31] to overspread the Roman abomination in
[1:31:34] the Jewish temple he's going to cut off
[1:31:36] the daily sacrifice in the Jewish temple
[1:31:38] he's a vile person he takes the kingdom
[1:31:41] by flatteries or lies right making you
[1:31:45] feel good when he's lying to you he
[1:31:48] speaks against the holy God the Bible
[1:31:50] said he enters the holy land he scatters
[1:31:53] the power of the holy people by the
[1:31:55] break of their covenant and that's what
[1:31:59] Satan does at the end that's how he
[1:32:00] heads up but I'm so glad he's locked
[1:32:02] away during the Millennium he gets out
[1:32:04] one more time but I'm so glad God here
[1:32:07] said his fired off in heaven and
[1:32:09] destroys him and his and his armies or
[1:32:12] his armies are the nation's during the
[1:32:14] Millennium he gathers all the nations
[1:32:17] that are outside them the temple and
[1:32:19] brings them in against the camp of God
[1:32:21] and
[1:32:22] God sets fire right there down around
[1:32:25] Jerusalem burns up Satan and that's
[1:32:28] where the beasts necks aren't you glad
[1:32:29] and God takes a flea castle in the lake
[1:32:32] of fire right there right before the
[1:32:33] white from judgment you love the Lord
[1:32:36] tonight and I understand our feet by
[1:32:37] God's grace I couldn't get to everything
[1:32:42] but I just I just want to finish tonight
[1:32:44] that's okay can I finish that thought
[1:32:47] sure truly we can recognize the trail of
[1:32:49] the serpent truly we can see that now
[1:32:57] let me say this as you follow the close
[1:33:00] of this as you follow the path of the
[1:33:02] circuit once you see shedding blood
[1:33:03] shedding blood killing killing
[1:33:05] selfishness selfish but what do you see
[1:33:08] the truth where do you see the of the
[1:33:09] true believer you see the true believer
[1:33:12] shedding the blood as a sacrifice giving
[1:33:16] of themselves as a sacrifice
[1:33:19] surrendering to all the Word of God
[1:33:21] obeying the Word of God being attacked
[1:33:24] and not fighting back right so if you
[1:33:31] follow the trail the serpent you'll see
[1:33:33] his characteristics but if you follow
[1:33:35] the bloody footprints of Christ you'll
[1:33:38] see a life that's lived and sacrificed
[1:33:40] for any man it's not a selfish life it's
[1:33:44] a life of continual sacrifice for the
[1:33:46] glory of God on the ground and said this
[1:33:53] is the sardian Church sermon he said
[1:33:56] that the Catholic Church shed the blood
[1:33:59] of all the saints and that's the
[1:34:00] scripture brother Branham said someday
[1:34:02] I'll give my life for that he said
[1:34:06] because this nation was coming down
[1:34:07] against anyone who fights against the
[1:34:09] churches and Catholics he said someday
[1:34:12] he'd give his life for it now he didn't
[1:34:13] live to see that of a church what if
[1:34:15] we're the generation program said be
[1:34:18] willing to stand up against that spirit
[1:34:19] be willing to stand up against that
[1:34:21] beast and he said if you have to mingle
[1:34:23] your blood like in the prophets of old
[1:34:26] because that spirit wants to destroying
[1:34:29] Hill believers but the real believer
[1:34:31] gives our life as it offered a fast
[1:34:34] that last thing Graham said he saw a
[1:34:37] vision that starter Jake well Graham saw
[1:34:41] he said he saw a vision of the
[1:34:42] Pentecostal church he said it was a cat
[1:34:46] have you heard that sermon and he makes
[1:34:47] it something that makes it something as
[1:34:52] the RAM walked over and he saw a cat and
[1:34:55] the vision and there's a sign behind the
[1:34:57] cabinets and Pentecostal churches
[1:35:01] Lorenzen why he said oh this is a cute
[1:35:04] kitty and he said he said he's stroking
[1:35:06] the kitty stroking the kitty and he said
[1:35:08] the boy said now go the other way stroke
[1:35:12] him the other way and he said watch when
[1:35:16] he turns into mother Graham said the
[1:35:21] whole time he was fed him the way with
[1:35:23] his fur goes brother Graham said this
[1:35:25] was a vision of evangelist visions never
[1:35:26] failed Clemente took his hand and Stroke
[1:35:30] the opposite way he said that capture
[1:35:32] him so huge monster
[1:35:33] he said it's green eyes bulged on atoms
[1:35:35] and was going to try to kill him and
[1:35:38] brother Ram said that's what happened
[1:35:39] when you tell somebody they're Trinity
[1:35:41] doctrines of the devil that's one way to
[1:35:45] know if somebody has the wrong spirit on
[1:35:49] them and they're actually going to fight
[1:35:51] you
[1:35:51] instead of being happy for you you tell
[1:35:53] them something that's wrong you tell
[1:35:54] them this wrong you talk you said you
[1:35:56] tell your baptism is wrong and this he
[1:35:58] said if they reared up and fight you
[1:36:00] then they got the wrong spirit in church
[1:36:03] one day it may come down that for us it
[1:36:05] may not be male 11 our Paterno raised up
[1:36:08] and all these things like that will go
[1:36:09] down to the grave but at some point it's
[1:36:12] gonna happen to somebody that was a
[1:36:15] vision I have to say that that's what I
[1:36:19] want to say that this is the beast we're
[1:36:20] gonna see in the end it was the it was
[1:36:22] the churches it was a Pentecostal Church
[1:36:25] that seemed to have an anointing on them
[1:36:26] right it's gonna be so close good to see
[1:36:29] they're very elected if it were possible
[1:36:31] how many willing to stand on the truth
[1:36:33] of God no matter who hates em no matter
[1:36:35] who loves him/her today in the ground
[1:36:38] said you're gonna have to given a lot of
[1:36:40] you may have to give your love for that
[1:36:41] he thought he would have to give his
[1:36:43] life for that he didn't have to but
[1:36:47] that's how
[1:36:47] you'll see the spirit behind someone
[1:36:50] telling this is the absolute truth I
[1:36:52] believe this to be the state the Lord
[1:36:54] and watch their reaction aren't you glad
[1:36:57] that when someone told you that you
[1:36:59] could say Amen to it or you could say
[1:37:01] well let me go let me have a Bible again
[1:40:07] the true church will discern the two
[1:40:10] spirits within the framework of the
[1:40:12] church praise God
[1:40:14] we'll see the trailer circuit but we'll
[1:40:15] also see the bloody footprints of our
[1:40:17] Lord Jesus Christ and we'll follow him
[1:40:20] praise God all the way glory I hope you
[1:40:24] were blessed in that holy man oh but it
[1:40:26] wasn't too much to review but there are
[1:40:27] so many bits in there and we got to ask
[1:40:30] God you take anything out I mean that we
[1:40:32] even look like he saw we even look like
[1:40:34] despite any but then we get upset
[1:40:36] everybody or to do a thing god help me
