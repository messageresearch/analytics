[25:48] and God bless everybody hope you had a
[25:49] wonderful time and the Lord
[25:51] we sure did we went to brother cams and
[25:53] just a wonderful service I didn't preach
[25:55] I just got to sit back and feed on the
[25:57] word it was just a tremendous message
[25:59] can't preach a great message on
[26:00] harvesting and hopefully maybe he'll
[26:04] preach it this weekend we'll see what
[26:05] the Lord has I never tell anybody what
[26:07] to preach you know sometimes ask Simon
[26:09] if he'll preach a certain message like
[26:11] when he preached her proceed a few years
[26:12] ago I did request that that was a great
[26:14] blessing and he preached the church age
[26:17] sermon last year I really enjoyed that I
[26:20] wanted to hear that so I'll be writing
[26:21] on that topic soon but very thankful by
[26:25] God's grace I got a few scriptures let's
[26:26] go to Book of Psalms here tonight I like
[26:30] to look at the purpose series again I
[26:32] know last Wednesday we left you off with
[26:34] Revelation 12 but as I was studying and
[26:37] preparing I just had a few thoughts I
[26:38] just couldn't get away from that usually
[26:40] is how God works with me I'll take those
[26:43] thoughts search them out and preach them
[26:45] by God's grace oh I'm 39 for
[26:56] so I'm 39 four and then we'll go Lord
[27:01] willing to James 4 so start at the
[27:03] Psalms 39 4 yeah we got up there why
[27:06] don't we read this one together here on
[27:08] three one two three
[27:10] Lord make me to know mine end and the
[27:14] measure of my days what it is that I may
[27:18] know how frail I am now you just go to
[27:22] James 4:11 Hebrews and James James 4:11
[27:35] tonight we'll be looking at the
[27:39] temporary assignment I left you off a
[27:41] couple of Sunday nights ago with the
[27:43] trust how God sees our life as a
[27:46] metaphor of a trust and we had one more
[27:48] left and that God likens our life to a
[27:51] temporary assignment
[27:52] James 4:11 I'll read this inand will
[27:56] read one more speak not evil one of
[27:59] another brethren he that speaketh evils
[28:02] of his brother and judges and brothers
[28:04] speak of the evil the law and judges the
[28:06] law but if thou judge the law thou arts
[28:08] not a doer of the law but a judge there
[28:13] is one lawgiver who is able to save and
[28:15] to destroy who art thou that judgest
[28:16] another go to now ye that say today or
[28:22] tomorrow we will go into such a city and
[28:24] continue there a year and buy and sell
[28:26] and get gain whereas you know not what
[28:30] shall be on the morrow for what is your
[28:32] life that's a great question is it what
[28:34] is your life is it even a vapor that
[28:38] appeareth for a little time and then
[28:39] vanishes away for that you ought to say
[28:43] if the Lord will we shall live and do
[28:45] this or that but now you rejoice in your
[28:48] boastings all such rejoicing as evil
[28:51] therefore to him that knoweth to do good
[28:53] and do it there not to him and is sin
[28:55] let's bow our heads for a word of prayer
[28:57] here
[28:58] that's the Lord to speak to us if you
[29:00] ever need on your heart just making on
[29:01] unto God Heavenly Father or my hands are
[29:04] up Lord I surely need you tonight thank
[29:06] you for this gathering thank you that
[29:07] we can cast our burdens down Lord and
[29:10] father we feel so much better when we do
[29:12] that Lord God when we confess our sins
[29:14] or we stop confessing unbelief but we
[29:17] start quoting your word it feels so much
[29:19] better thank you for your guidance Lord
[29:21] God speak to us tonight Lord on this
[29:23] temporary assignment let your will be
[29:25] done Lord God manifest your sweetness of
[29:28] your presence that we might draw closer
[29:29] to you
[29:30] and Lord as your prophet said our main
[29:32] reason for gathering here is to find our
[29:34] weak spots and father that we might be
[29:37] better Christians we ask all these
[29:38] things in Jesus Christ's name and the
[29:40] church said Amen god bless yous being
[29:42] seated praise God well have a few slides
[29:46] here I'm gonna be quoting a little bit
[29:49] out of chapter 6 out of the book and I
[29:51] got the thought I want to get to is how
[29:54] brother Branham struggled I mentioned
[29:55] that a few weeks ago but brother Branham
[29:59] struggled greatly at the end of his life
[30:03] and that was a thought that struck me I
[30:05] thought oh I never really searched that
[30:07] out so I want to show at the end of the
[30:08] message
[30:09] how much brother Branham suffered at the
[30:11] end of his life and we know he had the
[30:14] stomach problem that there was other
[30:15] other sufferings he was going through
[30:17] and I'm not sure how much I don't know
[30:20] if I've ever preached on that or not by
[30:21] wanting to bring it out to the church
[30:23] tonight by God's grace how many thankful
[30:25] you know God's purpose for your life
[30:27] praise the Lord amen surely thankful for
[30:30] that I didn't read Psalms 119 but the
[30:32] Bible does say in the scripture we're
[30:33] strangers on the earth David said I'm a
[30:35] stranger I'm a pilgrim in a stranger
[30:38] right we've seen that song I'm a pilgrim
[30:40] and a stranger so that is so true we
[30:43] looked at the four metaphors of God's
[30:45] view of our purpose we saw a couple
[30:48] Wednesday's ago how it's a race we've
[30:50] got to run the race and then it's also a
[30:52] test we have to pass the test that the
[30:55] teachers given to us and then a couple
[30:58] Sunday nights ago we looked at how it's
[31:00] a trust God is entrusting us with a
[31:03] talent and we saw a talent was like I
[31:05] what was it $160,000 that's one talent
[31:08] and then the Jesus I'll give you one
[31:10] somebody gets to that's like 320 and
[31:13] then somebody got five which was like
[31:15] eight hundred and sixty thousand dollars
[31:17] during their lifetime and that's what
[31:19] they were to invest in the kingdom of
[31:21] God
[31:21] and so we've got to be faithful with
[31:24] what God gives us praise the Lord and
[31:26] tonight no let's look at this temporary
[31:29] assignment I'm not gonna review I think
[31:30] I'll just get right to the Word of God
[31:31] if I have time too I want to show you a
[31:33] little a video up and I watched one time
[31:36] and it was just a really good
[31:37] illustration of how life is so temporary
[31:39] I'm not sure if you ever seen it but I
[31:41] want to show it to you
[31:42] it's another preacher he's not in the
[31:44] message but it's a good illustration so
[31:48] I'm gonna pull some thoughts from my
[31:49] reading year as I've been reading back
[31:52] going back over I read it one time last
[31:53] year I've been going back over it and
[31:55] kind of meditating on it I want to just
[31:58] read a few portions out of here and like
[32:00] I said I'm the main thought is to show
[32:02] our brother branham struggled in this
[32:04] temporary assignment in life although he
[32:07] was a prophet he saw visions had
[32:09] innumerable miracles we'd say he still
[32:12] struggled greatly and he had a difficult
[32:15] time and he even longed even long to go
[32:18] home even long to to be finished with
[32:21] this temporary assignment and to go see
[32:23] Jesus and so when times when we feel
[32:26] like that we know that's normal right
[32:28] because Paul said there's times I wish I
[32:30] could he said I want to be absent from
[32:32] the body to be with Jesus but he said
[32:34] then I want to be with you he said I'm
[32:35] in a strait betwixt the two he says I
[32:38] don't know which one I should do should
[32:40] I stay with you and helped you teach you
[32:42] or should I go be with the Lord so it
[32:44] was hard for him now I want to just read
[32:48] a few quotations here it says life on
[32:51] Earth is a temporary assignment the
[32:53] Bible is full of these metaphors we've
[32:55] gone through them too
[33:00] make the best use of your life you must
[33:02] never forget two things compared to
[33:05] Eternity life is extremely brief second
[33:09] earth is only a temporary residence you
[33:11] won't be here long so don't get too
[33:13] attached right think about that
[33:16] how long did Solomon live Simon lived
[33:18] 3,000 years ago David lived 3,000 years
[33:22] ago have they spent more time on earth
[33:24] or they spent more time in glory think
[33:27] about that this is just a very short
[33:29] time we're here we're going to spend
[33:31] wealth the Lord tarries I guess we won't
[33:33] spend too much and if we get raptured
[33:35] and the Lord doesn't tarry we actually
[33:37] spend more time here but most of the
[33:40] saints that have lived before us in the
[33:43] Bible the Old Testament nu have will
[33:45] definitely be longer there than they
[33:46] were here right but for us it could be
[33:50] different if we're some of those blessed
[33:51] the Bible said those that are alive and
[33:54] remain praise God that's my desire to be
[33:57] alive and remain when Jesus Christ comes
[34:00] but even if not the Bible said the dead
[34:02] in Christ rise first I'll rise first
[34:04] right will rise first in our order he
[34:08] said you won't be here too long so don't
[34:09] get too attached to Akron Ohio right or
[34:13] wherever you live Florida or Georgia and
[34:17] he says ask God to help you see life on
[34:20] Earth as he sees it remember opening
[34:24] scripture David said lord help me to
[34:25] realize how brief my time on earth will
[34:28] be help me to know that I'm here from
[34:31] just a moment more my life is so frail
[34:33] right our time here so short
[34:36] help us to see our life as a temporary
[34:38] assignment the Bible compares life on
[34:43] Earth to living in a foreign country and
[34:44] we know that it reminded me of when I
[34:48] went to Guyana I've been there four
[34:49] times but when I would go there at
[34:52] church I wasn't really I wasn't really
[34:53] caring about who was around me I was
[34:55] there I had one purpose there I was
[34:57] there to preach the gospel and I could
[34:59] forget it I did have to pay bills mine
[35:01] was such a glorious time I didn't have
[35:03] to return anybody's emails because I had
[35:05] no cell phone service it was one of the
[35:07] greatest you know 10 or 13 days of my
[35:09] life
[35:10] no responsibility all I had to do was
[35:13] just preach the
[35:14] study fast and pray preach pray for the
[35:17] sick that's all I had to do but you know
[35:20] our lives are like it unto being in a
[35:23] foreign country the Bible calls us
[35:26] pilgrims strangers aliens sojourners
[35:30] visitors travelers
[35:32] that's what describes our time on earth
[35:36] well I'm gonna read that Psalms 119 19
[35:40] let's read I'll just read that because I
[35:41] do believe it says literally that you
[35:43] and I are strangers here I'm not gonna
[35:45] pull it up there cuz I got to switch
[35:46] over from one thing to the next so one
[35:49] 1919
[35:50] here it is it says I am a stranger in
[35:53] the earth hide not thy Commandments from
[35:55] me amen
[35:57] David says I'm a stranger look he was
[35:59] like a alien that was sent down to earth
[36:01] and killed Goliath like an alien he was
[36:05] like it invading he was like an invading
[36:07] alien praise God and that's what we are
[36:10] right that's what we we came from the
[36:12] mind of God and we're down here so
[36:14] journeying for a little time and our
[36:16] purpose is to destroy the works of the
[36:18] Satan while we're here amen
[36:20] sorry you know just like David took down
[36:24] a natural giant we're supposed to take
[36:25] down spiritual Giants hallelujah we're
[36:28] supposed to do more than just take down
[36:30] natural things we're supposed to move
[36:32] mountains Church what's bigger a giant
[36:35] an eight-foot giant or a mountain a
[36:37] mountains bigger we're supposed to move
[36:39] mountains with God's Word amen
[36:41] hallelujah thank God we've seen it
[36:43] praise the Lord and the little miracles
[36:45] God's done here he's moved mountains for
[36:48] people praise God very thankful for that
[36:51] now Peter says at first Peter 1:17 if
[36:54] you got your Bible and turn there of
[36:56] course you don't have to just take me a
[36:58] moment to get there first Peter 1:17
[37:03] Peter states it plainly he says and he
[37:08] says if ye call on the father who
[37:10] without respect to persons judgeth
[37:12] according to every man's work past the
[37:15] time of your sojourning here in fear so
[37:19] see we're just so journey we're just
[37:21] here for a little journey but we must
[37:23] pass our time here in fear we must live
[37:27] in the fear of the Lord
[37:28] that's right he says then you'll live be
[37:33] holy for I am holy
[37:34] praise God so the only way will live
[37:36] holy here is to remember that I'm just
[37:38] here for a short time I'm not gonna be
[37:40] here very long
[37:41] that's right now Healy gives an
[37:44] illustration about a green card so I
[37:46] don't know if our sisters have had green
[37:48] cards or not do the dude you have green
[37:50] cards okay so he says in California
[37:53] where I live many people have moved from
[37:55] other parts of the world to work here
[37:56] but they keep their citizenship with
[37:58] their home country they're required to
[38:01] carry a visitor registration card called
[38:03] a green card which allows them to work
[38:05] here even though they aren't citizens
[38:08] Christians should carry a spiritual
[38:10] green card to remind us that our
[38:12] citizenship is in heaven and I do it's
[38:15] called the baptism of the holy ghost hey
[38:18] it's our seal and I pack it with me
[38:21] everywhere I go praise God
[38:23] that's our seal it's our mark right it's
[38:25] a mark
[38:26] it's my token Amen hallelujah it's my
[38:29] ticket that I was from another country
[38:31] I'm going back there amen he says God
[38:35] says his children are to think
[38:36] differently about life from the way
[38:38] unbelievers do he said real believers
[38:43] understand that there's far more to life
[38:45] than just a few years we live on this
[38:47] planet your identity is an eternity and
[38:52] your homeland is in heaven when you
[38:54] grasp this truth you will stop worrying
[38:56] about having it all on earth God is very
[39:00] blunt about the danger of living for the
[39:02] here now and adopting the values
[39:05] priorities and lifestyles of the world
[39:06] around us when we flirt with the
[39:08] temptations of this world God calls it
[39:11] spiritual adultery let's read that James
[39:13] for James 4:4 that's scriptural I told
[39:18] you this is a pretty good book couple of
[39:19] the Saints and tomia I'm not one to read
[39:21] that book and I said you ought to read
[39:22] that book you can't afford a copy let me
[39:25] know I'll get you one you ought to read
[39:27] this this is a good read it's very short
[39:28] that's broken up into 42 short chapters
[39:30] you can read one chapter a day and it's
[39:32] just full of the scripture you just
[39:34] gotta watch out for two trinity
[39:35] references
[39:35] we will not fellowship with three
[39:37] persons in heaven I put that on Facebook
[39:39] this week and nobody said anything about
[39:41] it
[39:42] nobody can say anything when Ezekiel
[39:45] went to heaven he saw one God sitting on
[39:47] a throne when Isaiah went to have an N
[39:49] see three gods he saw one God and his
[39:51] train filled the temple can you imagine
[39:53] that train that train that write that
[39:56] great robe that he had he saw one person
[39:58] when John went up to heaven in
[39:59] Revelation 4 he said I saw one God
[40:01] seated on the throne amen
[40:03] he didn't see 3 Thrones he saw 1 throne
[40:06] he saw one person for four James 4:4 now
[40:12] look at this the adulterers and
[40:14] adulteresses know ye not that the
[40:16] friendship of this world is enmity with
[40:17] God who sever therefore will be a friend
[40:19] of the world is an enemy of God now
[40:23] you're gonna see I'm gonna close to this
[40:24] thought brother Branham had lots of
[40:26] friends in this world in fact the people
[40:29] he was most friendly with were people
[40:31] from Jeffersonville did you know there's
[40:33] a family there's a family in
[40:35] Jeffersonville I was watching a video
[40:38] for one of the families from
[40:39] Jeffersonville and their family owned a
[40:41] hotel and brother bran would have
[40:42] preachers stay there and they said every
[40:44] year program when he would go hunting he
[40:46] would and he would get game he would
[40:48] bring some of those steaks and give it
[40:50] to them every time and they didn't go to
[40:52] his church and they weren't very
[40:54] religious and that was the man's
[40:56] testimony he was just saying brother
[40:57] Branham was a loving man brother Branham
[41:00] was a giving man and that's and so all
[41:03] even though they didn't go to church all
[41:05] they only had good things are saying
[41:07] about brother Branham see cuz he was a
[41:09] friendly man he was a good man he's
[41:12] somebody you want to be around right
[41:14] amen
[41:15] but he said friendship with the world is
[41:18] enmity with God so brother Brandon bring
[41:20] a friend of the world those worldly
[41:22] people or whatever the nominal
[41:23] Christians that wasn't the friendship
[41:25] they're talking about here the
[41:27] friendship they're talking about here is
[41:28] sinning with the world right because the
[41:31] Bible said you have lusts so when you
[41:33] when you enjoy the lust of the world
[41:34] that's enmity against God not being kind
[41:37] to Catholics or Baptists or or
[41:39] Lutheran's or or Buddhists or something
[41:41] like that I saw my Buddhist friend this
[41:42] week and she said hi mr. Smith how you
[41:44] doing I said I'm doing good I'm phrase
[41:46] the Lord I'm doing good you know because
[41:49] she told me one time that you're the
[41:50] first real example of Christianity that
[41:53] meant a lot to me so we can be
[41:55] rhymes with the world we just can't
[41:57] enjoy their sin
[41:59] we just can't lust after the things they
[42:01] lust after shouldn't lust at all so see
[42:05] God calls it spiritual adultery when
[42:09] so-called Christians lust after the
[42:12] things of the world that's spiritual
[42:13] dull sure because it's not our home so
[42:15] you love the things of the world love of
[42:17] God's not in you now he gives the
[42:19] illustration imagine you were has to be
[42:21] a basa dur for your country and let's
[42:25] say you went to Ghana let's say you went
[42:27] we'll just use Ghana since we have Ghana
[42:28] representatives here today did you see
[42:30] bender art was in Ghana this week did
[42:31] you see that on Facebook yeah he was in
[42:33] God and he was preaching to God I don't
[42:34] maybe brother William saw but he had
[42:36] some good pictures there with the Saints
[42:38] and Ghana he said suppose though you
[42:41] became so comfortable when you're
[42:43] visiting the foreign country that you
[42:46] fell in love with it preferring it over
[42:48] your homeland your loyalty and
[42:50] commitment would change your role as an
[42:52] ambassador would be compromised instead
[42:54] of representing your home country you'd
[42:56] starting like you start acting like its
[42:58] enemy you'd be a traitor so let's say we
[43:01] all went to Ghana and say oh I love this
[43:03] I like to stay here forever and then
[43:07] that would mean we'd be a traitor to
[43:08] United States if we're supposed to be
[43:10] ambassadors of the United States we're
[43:12] supposed to represent the United States
[43:13] interests in Ghana but instead we fall
[43:15] in love with the warmth no more snow
[43:18] which we might like that but we would be
[43:22] a traitor to our purpose of being an
[43:24] ambassador and bringing the word or
[43:27] economy of us to Ghana and that's the
[43:31] point he's making he said sadly that's
[43:33] what many church members do the Bible
[43:36] said we are Christ's ambassadors right
[43:39] we're heaven's ambassadors come down to
[43:42] earth that's right now let's go
[43:48] another scripture here let's go to
[43:50] Center in these five 20 and then first
[43:52] Peter 2:11 sin Corinthians 5:20 let's
[43:54] read that real quick this shows were the
[43:56] ambassadors of heaven
[43:58] I'll be honest sure sometimes I have I
[44:00] go through struggles sometimes I forget
[44:02] that I'm an ambassador from heaven I'm
[44:05] not supposed to act like this is my home
[44:07] I'm supposed to act like I came out of
[44:09] God I am and we all forget no we I know
[44:13] I forget sometimes sometimes I just
[44:14] forget I just get in the routine of
[44:16] paying the bills and going to work and I
[44:18] forget that I'm I'm really not I'm not
[44:21] really here gonna be here very long I'm
[44:23] supposed to act like I'm representing
[44:25] heavens interest and I'm supposed to do
[44:27] the father's business and I'm supposed
[44:28] to bring the Kingdom of Heaven to other
[44:30] people's lives that's right
[44:32] 2nd Corinthians 5:20 now can you read
[44:37] that for us you got it oh okay it's got
[44:39] I thought maybe you guys had a new
[44:40] Bibles out there sorry now then we are
[44:42] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[44:46] beseech you by us we pray you in
[44:49] Christ's stead be reconciled to God so
[44:52] Paul saying I am in the stead of Christ
[44:54] I am acting like Jesus Christ to your
[44:57] church he said be reconciled to God
[45:00] I'm sent down from heaven Paul saying
[45:02] I'm sent down from heaven
[45:03] I'm God's ambassador I'm standing where
[45:05] Christ would stand if he was here and
[45:07] I'm saying be reconciled to God in other
[45:10] words let heaven and earth kiss amen let
[45:13] heaven come down to earth and now you be
[45:16] an ambassador for heaven as well yes now
[45:19] go to first Peter 2:11 back to first
[45:22] Peter first Peter 2:11 alright I'm in
[45:31] the wrong book first Peter 2:11 dearly
[45:35] beloved I beseech you as strangers and
[45:37] pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts
[45:40] which war against the soul
[45:44] now beseech means to beg right so Peters
[45:47] can imagine a preacher begging a
[45:49] preacher that's walk with Jesus on water
[45:51] a preacher that's been done so many
[45:54] miracles people got healed in his shadow
[45:56] and he's begging them would you please
[45:59] be a stranger and pilgrim on this
[46:02] and don't get involved in fleshly lusts
[46:05] which war against the soul don't let
[46:07] money or sexual relationships or
[46:09] anything no than anything war against
[46:12] your soul against heaven now this is why
[46:15] this scripture is why many people can
[46:18] never have peace with God because the
[46:20] Bible said when a Christian tries to
[46:22] enjoy the things of the world it starts
[46:24] a war inside of them and they constantly
[46:27] feel no peace with God they constantly
[46:30] feel like they're fighting against the
[46:31] Holy Spirit and they are there grieving
[46:33] the Holy Spirit and it brings war to
[46:36] their soul and what is the soul it's the
[46:37] nature of a person so they're there
[46:40] their desires that their fleshly desires
[46:43] that their worldly nature is still
[46:46] holding on the things the world and it
[46:48] wars against the nature of God in other
[46:51] words the unholy nature they have is
[46:54] warring against the holy nature of God
[46:55] amen praise God not only do we have to
[47:01] fight demons right church we're going to
[47:03] fight demons outside of us we've got to
[47:05] fight wars inside of us sometimes can
[47:09] you imagine that by now we've got to
[47:10] fight demons up here my metals up here
[47:13] sometimes the battles right here am I
[47:16] saved or not mine well I am I having
[47:18] such a struggle am I going to heaven or
[47:20] what's going on and we battle that
[47:22] because at the same time we're flirting
[47:25] with the world with fleshly lusts but
[47:27] when you cast our lust out then you have
[47:30] peace with God a man it's no more Waller
[47:33] you're not struggling with that anymore
[47:35] because you you're not fighting against
[47:37] God you're letting God's spirit flow
[47:39] through you how many one have peace with
[47:41] God I don't want experience war against
[47:44] God war my soul I would have peace with
[47:46] God in my soul and that goes for all of
[47:49] us it creates a war in your soul so not
[47:56] only you have the
[47:57] ever fought right here sometimes people
[47:59] have Wars of the soul that's pretty good
[48:01] that's a good thought
[48:02] some people are fighting wars on two
[48:05] battlefields brother Aaron I'll just
[48:07] take one battlefield I don't really want
[48:09] to fight too more bad two battles
[48:10] because I just want one battlefield is
[48:12] that right Church
[48:14] amen how many just want one battlefield
[48:17] I don't want to battle Satan on two
[48:19] fronts now you might sometimes you might
[48:22] have to like if you get sick and you
[48:23] gotta cast up say Satan get behind me
[48:25] Satan get Miami by your stripes I'm
[48:27] healed by you have to fight so there's
[48:29] times we might the fight on two fronts
[48:30] but I certainly don't want to fight on
[48:31] three fronts and I in you and I are the
[48:35] only ones who can limit the number of
[48:39] battlefields because you and I have to
[48:40] cast out any lip fleshly lusts which war
[48:43] against the soul so the choice is ours
[48:47] you can fight as many battles as you
[48:48] want but I would like to limit my
[48:49] battles right
[48:51] I'd like to limit my battles I'd like to
[48:54] just fight the battle of the mind amen
[48:56] Jesus keep me healthy the Bible said I
[49:00] would that you prosper in health even as
[49:02] your soul prospers amen that's it right
[49:05] there
[49:05] glory help me just to keep this battle
[49:08] on one battlefield the Battle of the
[49:10] mind in church I'm you know if you get
[49:17] up early and pray right away read your
[49:18] Bibles sing worship right away how many
[49:20] know you're gonna really have much
[49:21] better time in that battle of mind oh
[49:23] yeah you have much better time if you
[49:26] can put God first he said I pray brother
[49:30] that's how I pray first of a morning
[49:32] first he prays and your battle be
[49:35] greatly lessen if you can pray first I
[49:40] like that that's a good scripture there
[49:43] this world is not our home praise God
[49:51] now let me go a little bit further here
[49:54] okay I was looking for the scripture
[49:56] okay there it is where I left off
[50:02] first corinthians 7 31 let's read
[50:04] another scripture here i want to show a
[50:06] video and i want to show about programs
[50:08] life here
[50:16] 731 actual church
[50:23] jump up 229 now this is speaking of
[50:24] marriage so you got to take this in
[50:25] context here and it's it's from a man
[50:29] who was not married right so it's Ron
[50:32] Paul because there's times in this chat
[50:34] where Paul says this is me not the Lord
[50:36] right because Paul says I wish all of
[50:39] you didn't get married now who wouldn't
[50:42] like that one I would not like that so
[50:43] much I like to get married but Paul was
[50:48] the so he was so Stern he said this is
[50:49] not the Lord this is me I wish all of
[50:51] you didn't get married well that's okay
[50:54] that's a good thought for him but look
[50:57] what the Bible said 29 but this I say
[50:59] brethren the time is short it remaineth
[51:01] that both a that have wives be as though
[51:03] they had none so Paul was so sure the
[51:05] rapture is gonna come he said you should
[51:07] live even if you're married live like
[51:09] you don't have a spouse verse 20 30 30
[51:14] and they that weep as though they weep
[51:16] wet not and those that rejoice as though
[51:18] they rejoice them and they that buy as
[51:20] though they possessed not so what he's
[51:22] saying here don't get caught up in one
[51:23] thing don't get caught up and just
[51:26] rejoicing all the time or weeping all
[51:28] the time don't get stuck in a spot right
[51:31] don't miss out on your calling he said
[51:35] if you're stuck in a calling he said get
[51:36] out of it and try to serve the Lord
[51:38] verse 31 and they that use this world as
[51:43] not abusing it for the fashion of this
[51:46] world passes away everybody has got one
[51:50] of these cell phones right and it's okay
[51:52] to have one as long as you don't abuse
[51:54] it is that right it's okay to have one
[51:58] of these TVs as long as you don't abuse
[52:00] it with sin that right it's okay to go
[52:04] to school as long as school doesn't
[52:06] exalt itself against the Word of God
[52:09] some people say brother an was against
[52:11] education no I can show you about four
[52:13] quotes where brother Graham based his
[52:15] preaching schedule upon the education of
[52:18] his children it meant so much to him
[52:21] that sometimes he wouldn't preach in
[52:23] tabernae at the brown tabernacle because
[52:25] he had to go out back out west for the
[52:26] kids school
[52:27] what brother man is saying never exalt
[52:30] science above God's Word right
[52:34] never exalt any
[52:36] thing above the Word of God course true
[52:38] science will line up with the Bible if
[52:40] it's true science ok so you have that
[52:44] now 31 yeah that's right so see we must
[52:48] be in the world but don't abuse the
[52:51] world don't let it become an abuse to
[52:54] you don't abuse your mind don't abuse
[52:56] your soul right don't abuse your body
[52:59] that's the wisdom of God all right now
[53:08] let's go to Sega Riggins 4:18 Sankranthi
[53:14] ins 4:18 you got that brother Aaron you
[53:26] want to read that for us sir oh no
[53:28] problem
[53:29] oh sorry I saw your Bible now guy you
[53:31] got it ok yeah I should let you know
[53:33] before I ask you a mint things that we
[53:55] see our temporary things that we don't
[53:57] see are eternal in verse 17 it says it
[54:00] really good too for our light affliction
[54:03] which is but for a moment worketh for us
[54:05] a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[54:08] of glory amen
[54:10] it's just a moment if we're sick it's
[54:12] just gonna be for a moment if we're
[54:14] rejected it just gonna be for a moment
[54:16] if we're cast aside if we're mocked and
[54:18] made fun of it's just gonna be for a
[54:20] moment but that's working to us a weight
[54:23] of glory in other words weight a heavy
[54:26] lasting testimony in heaven amen I don't
[54:29] know yeah amen because Church there's
[54:31] not talking about physical weight it's
[54:33] not like well I'm gonna carry around
[54:34] like a bigger crown than everybody as
[54:36] heavier than everybody else
[54:37] it's a spiritual testimony it's a weight
[54:41] of glory it's a measure of a testimony
[54:44] and we want to have a testimony that
[54:46] pleases Jesus Christ your light
[54:49] affliction
[54:50] now down here produces a heavier
[54:52] testimony in heaven amen
[54:55] of course we know to be used on the day
[54:58] of judgment at the white throne where
[54:59] we'll stand up this person I couldn't I
[55:02] couldn't be a Christian like I couldn't
[55:03] pass her a small church and later to see
[55:06] ya but God may raise up Jesse Smith
[55:07] could you do it I could do it by God's
[55:09] grace right well I couldn't repent there
[55:13] was just too much football and sports
[55:15] going on but God will raise up Jesse
[55:18] Smith did you repent and did you reject
[55:20] football yet you did stand up your
[55:22] witness see so in every age we got to
[55:26] have witnesses and our lives now are
[55:29] laying up a weight of glory in heaven
[55:31] hallelujah now this is not our ultimate
[55:38] home because even though we experienced
[55:42] difficulty sorrow and rejection it's not
[55:46] the end of the story thank God for that
[55:49] in order to keep us from becoming too
[55:52] attached to earth God allows us to feel
[55:54] a significant amount of discontent and
[55:56] dissatisfaction in life praise God God
[56:00] does that Church on purpose God makes us
[56:04] feel discontentment and dissatisfaction
[56:07] I just can't get satisfied in this life
[56:10] I'm just so discontent in this life he
[56:12] does that on purpose
[56:13] so that will long for heaven so daddy
[56:19] now amen as much as we longed you know
[56:22] as much as we long for peace here we'll
[56:25] never find it so that makes us long for
[56:28] peace over there amen in that great
[56:31] heavenly country praise God we're not
[56:34] completely happy here because we're not
[56:36] supposed to be happy here praise God
[56:45] let me show this video here I don't know
[56:48] if let me pull it up real quick I don't
[56:53] know how the volume will do here so bear
[57:01] with me this is a preacher he's a kind
[57:03] of like a holiness preacher in some ways
[57:05] how many ever heard of francis CH and
[57:07] this is a really beautiful illustration
[57:09] now think about what we've been saying
[57:11] here life is just a really short
[57:16] temporary assignment right and he gives
[57:19] this nice illustration I want you to see
[57:21] it it's got 1 million views but he takes
[57:24] this rope and I wanted to do it here but
[57:25] I just never thought about buying a rope
[57:27] I should ask somebody buy me or hope he
[57:29] has this rope that stretches all across
[57:31] the pulpit and he colored just a little
[57:33] end of it red and he compared that here
[57:35] look that's your life that red part of
[57:37] the Rope is your life and the rest of it
[57:39] is all eternity now look what he says
[57:41] it's really nice illustration I hope you
[57:43] like it here I hope the sound works here
[57:59] I can't think of a better way to to
[58:02] explain it I actually didn't use a rope
[58:06] back then I used a remember remember
[58:09] computer paper when it was all stuck
[58:11] together and they had the holes on the
[58:14] side the TFG long I remember that but I
[58:28] remember being a youth passion I put
[58:30] that computer paper all the way around
[58:32] the room and but I'm gonna use a rope
[58:35] now because I can't find that computer
[58:37] paper a bunch of this rope can pretend
[58:41] this rope just goes on forever ok
[58:45] just imagination pretend it goes around
[58:47] the world few times it doesn't it ends
[58:49] at the rock but let's just imagine this
[58:51] thing goes on forever now imagine that
[58:55] this rope is a time
[58:58] of your existence he just exists forever
[59:05] he sees right can we see that red there
[59:08] it's just red on the end you've got a
[59:13] few short years here on earth and then
[59:18] you've got all of eternity somewhere
[59:20] else
[59:21] that's course this is your existence now
[59:24] of course we don't believe people burn
[59:26] for eternity right but he may believe
[59:28] that but we don't believe that they may
[59:30] burn bro barrister they may burn for
[59:32] millions and millions and billions of
[59:33] years but at one point they're gonna
[59:34] eventually be annihilated so I just want
[59:36] to say I don't agree with everything on
[59:37] here I want you to see how he takes it
[59:39] though he really focuses on this red
[59:41] part don't live your life for the red
[59:44] part live your life for eternity amen oh
[59:55] man I can't wait to hear you know I'm
[59:58] gonna work hard imma save Solaris is
[1:00:05] that what people do I'm gonna save up
[1:00:06] for my retirement and they're just
[1:00:09] living for that last little red strip on
[1:00:11] that on that that red part I want to
[1:00:14] work 40 years then I can finally live
[1:00:16] the good life what a shame what about
[1:00:34] all the stuff it's is this crazy me
[1:00:35] because because the Bible teaches that
[1:00:37] what I do during this little red part
[1:00:39] deep Germans how I'm gonna exist for
[1:00:42] millions and millions and millions of
[1:00:44] years forever and and so why would I
[1:00:48] spend this little red part try to make
[1:00:50] myself as comfortable as possible
[1:00:53] enjoying myself as much as I can
[1:00:56] Paul says look I'm gonna live my life
[1:00:58] for this mission I'm gonna spend my life
[1:01:01] invest my life for this moment when I
[1:01:03] cross that finish line
[1:01:05] see I'm gonna forget about all this
[1:01:07] stuff I could enjoy it I'm not gonna
[1:01:09] look around I'm gonna be like a runner
[1:01:11] just looking at that moment when I face
[1:01:13] God because when I face him but I don't
[1:01:15] get this chance over again we get one
[1:01:18] chance at this life on earth then I
[1:01:20] ended any second for any of us we got
[1:01:22] one chance at this and then comes
[1:01:24] eternity I'm not gonna spend my life
[1:01:28] down here some people look at some of my
[1:01:29] decisions oh you're so stupid because
[1:01:31] that's gonna really affect this I don't
[1:01:33] know you're stupid cuz it's gonna affect
[1:01:36] all it is yeah I don't believe a name
[1:01:38] call so crazy you are so crazy
[1:01:49] yes you're gonna do that right now just
[1:01:52] to enjoy right now not even knowing if
[1:01:55] you have tomorrow and you think that's
[1:01:58] smart and that I'm dumb it doesn't make
[1:02:02] any sense Paul goes I'm not gonna look
[1:02:03] around at all this stuff and it's
[1:02:05] tempting it's tempting to all of it
[1:02:07] that's what I'm saying down here it's
[1:02:09] crazy because everyone lives that way
[1:02:11] everyone lives for the red part no one's
[1:02:14] thinking about the millions of years
[1:02:15] afterwards it's is this the crazy
[1:02:17] deception that we can't get out of our
[1:02:20] minds and Paul goes I'm not doing that
[1:02:22] you're gonna keep my eyes on that I keep
[1:02:24] my eyes on that finish line and I'm
[1:02:26] gonna forget way man yeah I'm straining
[1:02:30] because I'm straining forward I'm like
[1:02:32] stretching forward for that mark I'm
[1:02:34] gonna pass this thing I'm gonna live
[1:02:36] this out and I'm gonna face him I'm
[1:02:39] gonna come before the judges and he's
[1:02:40] gonna hand me that trophy he was I'm
[1:02:43] gonna get it I haven't gotten there yet
[1:02:44] he was probably better believe I'm using
[1:02:46] every muscle exerting every bit about me
[1:02:49] because I'm gonna pass that line well a
[1:02:52] menu like that that's beautiful maybe
[1:02:56] one of these weeks I'll finally buy one
[1:02:58] of those ropes and I'll preach it on a
[1:02:59] Sunday
[1:03:00] think about that church we just got this
[1:03:02] little red part and we should not now
[1:03:05] it's okay to have a retirement don't
[1:03:07] don't get me wrong it's okay to have a
[1:03:08] retirement but we shouldn't live and say
[1:03:11] oh boy my life's gonna be good when I
[1:03:13] finally retire and when and then I'll be
[1:03:16] able to eat better foods and all these
[1:03:18] things worrying about little things like
[1:03:19] that when we have all the rest of
[1:03:21] eternity
[1:03:23] if your life's like that and broadband
[1:03:25] should we get a thousand years with each
[1:03:26] person think how long your fellowship is
[1:03:29] with a with one person the thousand
[1:03:30] years you have more time with one person
[1:03:34] if you just live right now for Jesus
[1:03:36] Christ and make sacrifices and put God
[1:03:39] first I thought you'd really like that
[1:03:41] did you like that that's just a good a
[1:03:44] good visual of that now I want to start
[1:03:51] looking at Bram's life but I just want
[1:03:52] to read a couple more things the author
[1:03:55] goes on to say it's a fatal mistake to
[1:03:58] assume that God's goal for your life is
[1:04:00] material prosperity or popular success
[1:04:03] as the world defines it the abundant
[1:04:06] life has nothing to do with material
[1:04:07] abundance and faithfulness to God does
[1:04:10] not guarantee success in a career or
[1:04:13] even in ministry never focus on
[1:04:16] temporary crowns amen so if you serve
[1:04:20] Jesus Christ well that doesn't guarantee
[1:04:22] you're going to be the best worker at
[1:04:24] your job or them at the highest office
[1:04:26] or I'm gonna be the most popular
[1:04:27] preacher it doesn't mean that at all in
[1:04:29] fact it's usually the opposite and he
[1:04:32] uses some examples Paul was faithful and
[1:04:35] he labored more than everyone else but
[1:04:37] where'd he end up prison John the
[1:04:42] Baptist was faithful he leveled out
[1:04:46] those mountains and he raised up the
[1:04:47] valleys so it's just like he took like a
[1:04:49] piece he just took a tool like a rake
[1:04:51] and he raked down all those mountains
[1:04:53] and he just filled up the valleys with
[1:04:55] him that's where John the Baptist didn't
[1:04:56] where did he end up in prison with his
[1:04:58] head cut off see millions of people have
[1:05:03] been faithful and yet have been martyred
[1:05:05] and lost everything and have come to the
[1:05:07] end of the life with nothing to show for
[1:05:08] it but the end of life is not the end
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:12] like that in God's eyes the greatest
[1:05:16] heroes of faith are not those who
[1:05:18] achieve prosperity success and power in
[1:05:21] this life but those who treat this life
[1:05:23] as a temporary assignment and serve
[1:05:25] faithfully expecting the promised reward
[1:05:28] in eternity praise God amen now let's
[1:05:34] look at
[1:05:35] bit of suffering in brother branham's
[1:05:36] life and I'll bring it down to close
[1:05:37] here I may give me about twenty or fifty
[1:05:44] minutes I'll do 15 minutes here more now
[1:05:48] so see how I was preaching a few weeks
[1:05:49] ago and all of a sudden this thought
[1:05:51] came
[1:05:51] look how brother branham was persecuted
[1:05:53] does anyone remember when I preached it
[1:05:54] I said we've all got to suffer
[1:05:56] persecution right and in the days of
[1:05:59] Jesus and Paul it was the lion anointing
[1:06:02] right and so there the lion hunting and
[1:06:04] then the Beast anointing came after that
[1:06:05] and they willingly gave their lives
[1:06:07] martyrs you know 68 million right we
[1:06:10] know brother Graham gives us that number
[1:06:11] from foxes Book of Martyrs or gosh
[1:06:13] Smuckers glorious Reformation rather but
[1:06:17] brother Branham and us we're we're not
[1:06:19] living in that age we're not living at a
[1:06:22] time where people are gonna hang us just
[1:06:24] because we're a Christian or shoot us
[1:06:25] just because we believe the message at
[1:06:27] least not yet
[1:06:28] you don't know what what it will happen
[1:06:29] we don't believe it will go in the
[1:06:31] tribulation but there the Bible said
[1:06:32] there and so there will be a period to
[1:06:34] squeeze the temptation of trial so I
[1:06:37] just had that thought what about brother
[1:06:39] Branham how did he suffer in life and so
[1:06:42] I want to bring out some of these and I
[1:06:44] found a quote this week I heard listen
[1:06:45] to the sermon twice brother Graham said
[1:06:47] he never suffered more than the end of
[1:06:49] his life and it wasn't the stomach
[1:06:52] trouble that was a great suffering but
[1:06:55] that wasn't the real suffering so let me
[1:06:58] move to that so in 1955 here's some of
[1:07:03] the suffering brother Branham had to do
[1:07:04] when he first found the Pentecostal
[1:07:05] groups and they were speaking in tongues
[1:07:07] and interpreting and casting out Devils
[1:07:09] and they were the oneness Pentecostals
[1:07:11] that baptized in Jesus Christ Nate he
[1:07:15] had to suffer a little bit because I
[1:07:17] heard he said the longer I stood here
[1:07:20] the better I felt what's with the
[1:07:22] Pentecostals he said that seems pretty
[1:07:25] good I thought there ain't nothing wrong
[1:07:26] with them people they ain't crazy I got
[1:07:28] to talking to some of them they were
[1:07:29] fine people I said well now that's the
[1:07:31] same meaning that I went out and stayed
[1:07:33] all night that night and the next day I
[1:07:34] went in and you've heard me tell that my
[1:07:36] life story I was on the platform with
[1:07:39] 150 or 200 other ministers maybe more
[1:07:42] and they wanted everybody just raise up
[1:07:44] and say their name and I said evangelist
[1:07:45] William Branham Jeffersonville and set
[1:07:47] down Baptist and so for
[1:07:49] sit down each one tell where they were
[1:07:50] from so the next morning when I got in
[1:07:54] there I slept in the field all night
[1:07:56] that night have you ever had to sleep in
[1:08:01] a field to attend a church service have
[1:08:05] you sister Beatrice ever had to sleep in
[1:08:06] a field okay
[1:08:08] I never have I to know I don't know what
[1:08:10] your country's like I did there I never
[1:08:12] had to sew but brother branham suffered
[1:08:16] by having to sleep in a field and in
[1:08:20] order get the wrinkles out he pressed
[1:08:24] his trousers between the two seats can
[1:08:27] you imagine taking your pants sisters
[1:08:29] your skirts and pull sticking them into
[1:08:31] the seats and then on the other side
[1:08:33] pulling them out to try to get the
[1:08:35] wrinkles out of them just so you don't
[1:08:38] look all wrinkly when you go to church
[1:08:39] I just dropped mine off I just I said
[1:08:42] okay I got five shirts I got five pairs
[1:08:44] of pants I'll see you in two days I can
[1:08:46] pick them up and they're all pressed
[1:08:47] perfectly now brother branham not in the
[1:08:53] 30s you know an old seersucker trousers
[1:08:58] a little t-shirt you know I get to wear
[1:09:02] a tie and I got a nice long shirt with a
[1:09:04] collar he had to wear a t-shirt when he
[1:09:06] first started preaching a t-shirt
[1:09:08] I think Haven has a t-shirt underneath
[1:09:11] her dress right David no looks like one
[1:09:15] sorry
[1:09:16] so the next morning I went through the
[1:09:18] meeting a little t-shirt on now I've got
[1:09:20] a t-shirt under nests but I'm not gonna
[1:09:21] take off the shirt that's how I went to
[1:09:24] church the prophet of God with a t-shirt
[1:09:28] on trousers have been pressed through
[1:09:31] his ford seats the night before and look
[1:09:33] what he ate for dinner Church I didn't
[1:09:36] have about three dollars and I had to
[1:09:37] enough gasoline to get home and I got me
[1:09:39] some rolls so I saw brother Aaron
[1:09:41] brought some rolls that kind of old you
[1:09:45] know but I was all right and I got to a
[1:09:50] hydrant can you believe this
[1:09:52] a fire hydrant and I got
[1:09:57] me a glass of water you know and they
[1:09:59] were pretty good can you imagine when up
[1:10:02] to fire hydrant out there I don't know
[1:10:04] what tool he would have used what kind
[1:10:05] of wrenched and got a little water out
[1:10:08] and close it up and now he's got rolls
[1:10:11] and he's got water and the so I soaked
[1:10:15] them up a little bit and had breakfast
[1:10:16] can you imagine dipping those rolls
[1:10:18] tonight and that's your that's your
[1:10:19] that's your supper you don't have
[1:10:21] anything at home or you're gonna go
[1:10:23] sleep out in the field tonight
[1:10:24] ooh soggy soggy rolls first dinner
[1:10:28] delicious now I could eat with them now
[1:10:33] they eat twice a day they only ate twice
[1:10:35] a day you get mad at or you and I may
[1:10:37] get mad if we don't eat three times or
[1:10:39] four times a day
[1:10:40] right think about that but this was not
[1:10:45] his greatest suffering of his life not
[1:10:48] even close
[1:10:50] so I wouldn't sponge on them I'm not
[1:10:53] sure what sponge me I wouldn't sponge on
[1:10:55] them I'm not sure what that means in
[1:10:58] 1960 program tells stories about flying
[1:11:01] on dangerous plane flights now listen to
[1:11:05] this I know some of you have flown on
[1:11:07] some big flights longer than I have I've
[1:11:09] never flown across the Atlantic like our
[1:11:12] sisters have but listen to mother brown
[1:11:15] describe his plane flight
[1:11:16] I don't preach the gospel because I
[1:11:19] think I'd go to hell if I didn't I
[1:11:21] preach the gospel because I love him hey
[1:11:24] hey man that's the same reason I preach
[1:11:26] it praise God
[1:11:27] I preach the gospel he says certainly
[1:11:29] you think I crossed those stormy seas
[1:11:32] and then planes diving back and forth
[1:11:35] and Lightning flashing around and
[1:11:38] everything else at most any minute and
[1:11:40] everybody's screaming have you ever been
[1:11:42] on a plane fly where everybody was
[1:11:44] screaming and Hail Marys are going
[1:11:48] through the plane so everybody seen and
[1:11:52] you got covers of the Hail Mary Mother
[1:11:54] of God well grace and truth and all
[1:11:55] these things but RAM so do you think I'd
[1:11:58] do that just for fun so I don't go to
[1:12:02] hell and everything
[1:12:04] and then people are swinging in them
[1:12:06] safety belts you know how the safety
[1:12:07] belts drop down or the suction cups
[1:12:10] he had safety belts he says safety belts
[1:12:12] are swinging around the plane get your
[1:12:15] belt on get your man out Mary Mother of
[1:12:18] grace got him the truth and all these
[1:12:20] things they say and program crossing the
[1:12:23] oceans planes diving shaking have you
[1:12:27] ever been on a plane that shakes like
[1:12:28] that when I flew from Boston to Maine or
[1:12:32] we just flew in those little planes and
[1:12:34] that's what I felt it was storm and
[1:12:35] lightning and the planes going like this
[1:12:37] and I'm thinking oh god have mercy I'm
[1:12:38] gonna die tonight but it's nothing like
[1:12:42] this then we were saying Hail Marys
[1:12:43] nobody was screaming and the pilot sank
[1:12:47] enough gas the last 15 minutes longer
[1:12:50] don't know where we're at
[1:12:53] no do you think I do that just for the
[1:12:56] fun of doing that is that fun no you get
[1:12:59] a pit in your stomach and you feel like
[1:13:01] this is the end and you're gonna die and
[1:13:02] what am i doing what have I done to
[1:13:06] myself
[1:13:06] where'd I miss God's call and this is
[1:13:10] what brother branham endured not because
[1:13:12] he was scared to go to hell but because
[1:13:14] he loved Christ so much this thorough
[1:13:17] still was not his worst suffering of his
[1:13:20] life you think I get back there in the
[1:13:27] jungles now look at this did I okay so
[1:13:32] here this quote and the next quote tell
[1:13:35] about the same thing where German
[1:13:38] soldiers had their put their arms around
[1:13:40] me like this each night and take me in
[1:13:42] and out of the meeting until the Holy
[1:13:44] Spirit began to perform miracles look at
[1:13:46] this church communist setting with night
[1:13:49] scopes to shoot me a mile away can you
[1:13:54] imagine that brother branham went to the
[1:13:57] pulpit knowing there's snipers out there
[1:14:01] a mile way that could shoot him now
[1:14:05] would you do that would you go to church
[1:14:06] service if you knew there were snipers
[1:14:07] the next door this is my brother Brandon
[1:14:12] Church we all need our faith raised
[1:14:15] don't we realize our life is not so hard
[1:14:19] after we battle out of mind battles but
[1:14:22] that's not too bad
[1:14:25] remember the Bible said this is a light
[1:14:27] affliction because it's just temporary
[1:14:30] it doesn't last forever it's just
[1:14:32] temporary you think I do that just for
[1:14:36] the fun of it he says because something
[1:14:39] in me love
[1:14:40] there's humans that Christ died for Paul
[1:14:42] said I'm not willing to go up to
[1:14:43] Jerusalem but I'm going up there to be
[1:14:45] crucified I'm going to die I'm going to
[1:14:47] go up there to die for the cause of the
[1:14:48] Lord it's something love constrains you
[1:14:50] that makes you that's exactly right
[1:14:52] here he gives another telling of it
[1:14:54] would you be willing to be a martyr for
[1:14:57] him with the sumerians if it come to
[1:15:00] this spot that you had to face death or
[1:15:01] take it back would you face it yes sir
[1:15:05] Oh God it would be a pleasure he says a
[1:15:07] pleasure to face death as a Christian
[1:15:10] yes sir that's the way I want to go
[1:15:12] riding the pulpit he says look at this
[1:15:16] that's right I thought I got it and
[1:15:18] gonna get me in Germany here not long
[1:15:20] ago oh there was going to shoot me
[1:15:22] through a night scope and German
[1:15:25] soldiers run all around me and held back
[1:15:26] like that they must have got in front of
[1:15:29] the pulpit to block them so brother Ram
[1:15:32] could preach I thought
[1:15:36] what a wonderful thing it would be to
[1:15:39] die for my lord right here on the field
[1:15:42] Mac and what a thought when he knows
[1:15:48] their snipers out there oh just be
[1:15:50] wonderful that if I died in the pulpit
[1:15:52] we might be saying oh it's awful
[1:15:55] can we can we go to a safer place to
[1:15:57] preach but this is what love constrained
[1:16:01] our prophet to do in 1961 in Chicago
[1:16:07] many you know this quote brother Branham
[1:16:09] was cornered trapped by 300 ministers
[1:16:12] about the serpentine doctrine and the
[1:16:14] water baptism he said I asked the other
[1:16:17] day in Chicago before 300 ministers that
[1:16:19] sit over there to debate me to ask me
[1:16:21] and the Lord told me gave me vision told
[1:16:23] me where we'd be at and what to do I
[1:16:25] stood before 300 Trinitarian ministers
[1:16:27] and I said now if I'm so wrong in this
[1:16:29] doctrine some of you men stand up here
[1:16:30] and show me where I'm wrong by the
[1:16:32] scriptures without a textbook he says if
[1:16:35] there's no such thing as a serpent seed
[1:16:38] or something like that that I've been
[1:16:39] teaching just come here show me by the
[1:16:41] scriptures
[1:16:41] nobody move because it can't be done
[1:16:45] hallelujah persecution suffering 300
[1:16:52] people sitting there knowing they
[1:16:55] dislike everything you say they wish you
[1:16:57] would be quiet and not preach they don't
[1:17:00] agree with one thing that you say 300
[1:17:03] against one
[1:17:08] now I'm gonna skip down to this there's
[1:17:10] about 50 or 75 of them said I'm coming
[1:17:13] down there to be rebaptised did they
[1:17:15] come not a one of them why he give them
[1:17:20] space to repent eat but he will cast
[1:17:22] their children to death spiritual death
[1:17:25] can you imagine 75 people saying brother
[1:17:28] Aaron I'm gonna be there I'm gonna go to
[1:17:30] your church I want you to bat I want you
[1:17:32] to get me baptized I'll be there 80
[1:17:33] people shake your hand say yes I want to
[1:17:36] be baptized the name of Lord Jesus
[1:17:37] Christ and they never show up
[1:17:41] that's called major rejection right
[1:17:44] where that 70 people lying to your face
[1:17:50] say they want to be baptized but they're
[1:17:53] lying right to your face this
[1:17:59] the greatest he said the greatest
[1:18:00] suffering of his life now what I'm gonna
[1:18:03] do is I'm gonna skip ahead and then come
[1:18:06] back to this how many numbers stomach
[1:18:09] job we had for seven years I'm sorry
[1:18:12] every 7 years rather I'm just gonna
[1:18:15] briefly go over this I want to spend my
[1:18:18] time my last few moments of the message
[1:18:20] on that other thought but madam said his
[1:18:23] stomach would get sour every 7 years he
[1:18:26] had a he had a vision and he saw he said
[1:18:28] he saw a squirrel a really ugly looking
[1:18:30] squirrel jump in his mouth and he says
[1:18:33] only the boy said it's only six inches
[1:18:35] long and brother branham kept saying he
[1:18:38] would pray and pray look at this I cried
[1:18:41] I begged I pleaded God for it to leave
[1:18:44] and never left at the end of his life he
[1:18:47] saw another vision of the squirrel dead
[1:18:51] and the squirrel he noticed how the
[1:18:54] squirrel was out there and in the in the
[1:18:55] desert but it wasn't in eating it fell
[1:18:58] on a cactus and it died and then he saw
[1:19:01] a dove
[1:19:01] he saw dove come and after the dove came
[1:19:05] the Holy Spirit said that this is over
[1:19:07] he said it was only six inches long
[1:19:09] he saw seventh of and seven represented
[1:19:11] complete healing amen and so program
[1:19:14] ends that sermon on the wings of a snow
[1:19:16] white dove singing and thanking God that
[1:19:19] he's never going to have the stomach
[1:19:20] trouble again
[1:19:21] he said God revealed to him he never
[1:19:23] have it again and only lived about you
[1:19:24] know three or four weeks after that
[1:19:26] before the Lord took him home so I'm
[1:19:32] gonna
[1:19:32] that but look look look at the suffering
[1:19:35] Oh God have mercy it's killing me
[1:19:37] he would have this sourness he just felt
[1:19:40] like he was gonna die and he told
[1:19:43] stories I think there's a story now to
[1:19:45] get a chance to get to it there's a
[1:19:46] story in there where brother Branham
[1:19:48] says he had the stomach trouble the sour
[1:19:50] stomach and he prayed for a man that had
[1:19:53] cancer on his face and the cancer fell
[1:19:55] off but he remains sick was with sour
[1:19:58] stomach ha can you imagine I cried I
[1:20:02] begged God heal me you just healed
[1:20:05] cancer can you heal my stomach and God
[1:20:07] was silent during that time but that
[1:20:11] still wasn't as intense suffering as the
[1:20:16] rejection he experienced having ever
[1:20:19] been rejected out there was ever never
[1:20:20] been rejected let her have said the
[1:20:23] rejection in Tucson was some of the
[1:20:27] hardest rejection of his entire life
[1:20:29] worse than eaten rolls for supper
[1:20:32] worse than fine in planes that you think
[1:20:34] they're gonna follow the sky worse than
[1:20:38] seeing snipers get ready to shoot you
[1:20:42] brother branham said in Tucson he
[1:20:44] suffered like he never suffered his
[1:20:46] entire life so this is from what house
[1:20:51] will you build me in Tucson 1965 now
[1:20:57] brother Simon and I guess preached a
[1:20:58] little bit this on Sunday morning he
[1:21:00] preached about Moses with the pillar of
[1:21:02] fire Paul and then brother branham so
[1:21:08] now remember
[1:21:09] sermon was not actually really a sermon
[1:21:11] a complete sermon brother branham was
[1:21:14] just saying a few words before brother
[1:21:15] Perry green preached that morning
[1:21:17] message and brother band before this
[1:21:21] program says there was many times he
[1:21:23] heard brother Perry green preach and was
[1:21:25] really blessed by his preaching you can
[1:21:27] listen to that if you'd like to and I
[1:21:31] says I find this one of the great
[1:21:32] moments of my visit to Tucson I come
[1:21:35] here because I was led to come here I
[1:21:37] come here because the Holy Spirit
[1:21:38] through a vision sent me here I know
[1:21:40] that might seem strange maybe but he as
[1:21:42] far as I know anything that I know of
[1:21:44] God
[1:21:44] I was sent my vision and to son I've
[1:21:49] wondered how I was ever sent to this
[1:21:51] desert place and then here where there
[1:21:54] is spiritually speaking I listen all
[1:21:56] over the city I don't know any place
[1:21:59] that's any more spiritually dead than
[1:22:01] the City of Tucson now what a spiritual
[1:22:06] death look like Church to brother Graham
[1:22:08] he's gonna tell us right here so this
[1:22:11] will tell us if we're spiritually dead
[1:22:12] or not but I'll give you a clue we're
[1:22:14] alive in Christ there's war between the
[1:22:19] churches do we have any war with any
[1:22:21] message churches here no we don't bars I
[1:22:24] know there is fusses between the
[1:22:28] congregations do we have any Foster's
[1:22:29] with any other churches nothing I'm
[1:22:31] aware of there is no unity and everyone
[1:22:36] grabbing and holding and squeezing and
[1:22:37] trying to get this one and proselyting
[1:22:39] am i trying to pop proselyte people from
[1:22:42] other churches I'm not it is a desert
[1:22:47] spiritually speaking also hope that
[1:22:52] encourages you tonight by God's grace if
[1:22:55] we have unity here we're not fussing
[1:22:58] with the churches in Sheffield or Albion
[1:23:00] or Lorraine and if we're not trying to
[1:23:04] proselyte say oh you gotta come to my
[1:23:06] church you should leave your church come
[1:23:07] on church now it's good if you're saying
[1:23:09] that to Catholic or a Presbyterian or
[1:23:10] Luther right trying to point them to the
[1:23:14] truth of God but brother him says this
[1:23:16] is a dead church he said a dead church
[1:23:19] is when you're warring with other
[1:23:21] churches you're proselytizing you
[1:23:23] fusses between congregations he said
[1:23:25] that's spiritually dead but then I read
[1:23:30] in the Bible where God called Moses away
[1:23:32] from the loved ones it all was dear to
[1:23:34] him and sent him in the wilderness to
[1:23:35] write the laws of the Bible then I find
[1:23:37] that in the book of the New Testament
[1:23:39] where Paul which is the author or not
[1:23:40] the author but the ride of the New
[1:23:41] Testament he also has drove out from
[1:23:44] among his people and by the sphere into
[1:23:46] Arabia where he was three and 1/2 years
[1:23:48] to find the inspiration and pause the
[1:23:52] chief writer of the New Testament Simon
[1:23:54] Reid that on Sunday by a chance didn't
[1:23:56] remember Simon reading that quote okay
[1:24:01] and now if the Old Testament had to be
[1:24:04] drove from if the rider had to be drove
[1:24:06] from his people in the wilderness to get
[1:24:09] inspiration to write the Old Testament
[1:24:10] and the New Testament the rider was
[1:24:12] drove by the author into the desert to
[1:24:14] get the inspiration to read the New
[1:24:16] Testament and the books are sealed with
[1:24:18] seven seals ha ha ha it would also
[1:24:22] require the same I believe in these days
[1:24:24] to open the seven CEOs ha ha if God had
[1:24:29] a job moves this out to get inspiration
[1:24:31] and then got into drive Paul out to get
[1:24:33] inspiration and the book see was seven
[1:24:35] seals God without the drive brother
[1:24:37] brought him out to give him inspiration
[1:24:39] to loose and break all those seven seals
[1:24:42] amen hallelujah
[1:24:45] beautiful now look look what he look
[1:24:49] what he had to go through a church look
[1:24:50] he had to leave what you hold dear to
[1:24:54] what you cherish and a little home that
[1:24:59] was given me by the people remember
[1:25:00] remember uh there was a meeting where
[1:25:03] the people paid for programs house you
[1:25:05] guys remember that brother branham's
[1:25:07] autobiography remember that do you
[1:25:09] remember that Lydia one of that one of
[1:25:12] the campaigns took up a love offering
[1:25:13] and paid for a house for his family
[1:25:16] that's on tape because they were they
[1:25:19] they heard about how he's living in an
[1:25:20] awful house and they didn't know what
[1:25:22] brother ham said give it back and they
[1:25:23] said how are we gonna give it back it's
[1:25:24] all cash we don't know who gave what so
[1:25:27] both my brother and actually accepted
[1:25:28] that money and had a house built so it
[1:25:31] was already paid for he left the little
[1:25:35] hole that was given me
[1:25:37] the people and amongst all my people and
[1:25:39] friends and a church that was
[1:25:40] flourishing had nothing lacking so
[1:25:42] that's what he calls a flourishing
[1:25:43] Church you have anything lacking and to
[1:25:47] leave that Pope away from it and move
[1:25:49] away out into desert where you knew
[1:25:52] nobody and everything against you so now
[1:25:56] you're starting to see why his life was
[1:26:00] the hardest at the end harder than eaten
[1:26:03] soaked rolls water soaked rolls the
[1:26:09] hardest part of his life was living in a
[1:26:11] spiritual desert where all the churches
[1:26:13] are fussing against each other people
[1:26:15] are prophet isin there's no unity and
[1:26:19] you don't know anybody so you feel all
[1:26:21] alone and everybody's against you well
[1:26:24] as long as God's with you you could
[1:26:27] handle it Amen and if anybody was with
[1:26:30] brother brand it was God here's where he
[1:26:36] says it but there's something about God
[1:26:39] that he drives a man number I preach on
[1:26:42] that at the beginning this series God
[1:26:45] drives you to your purpose then your
[1:26:47] purpose drives you
[1:26:49] amen look at my friend said God drives a
[1:26:52] man to do things that's beyond any
[1:26:55] thinking of his own so it can be to the
[1:26:58] glory and honor of God God drove me to
[1:27:00] be a pastor I never thought I'd really
[1:27:02] be a pastor preacher when I came to the
[1:27:05] message that's when I realized I need to
[1:27:06] be up there preaching but before that I
[1:27:08] had no idea I'd be a pastor started
[1:27:10] church I start a church and preach a
[1:27:13] hundred some times a year I would do
[1:27:16] that I never thought I'd do that but God
[1:27:19] drives a man to do something and I feel
[1:27:25] that and I look not self honor but man's
[1:27:27] not bragging but I feel was a privilege
[1:27:29] that it was to leave everything that was
[1:27:32] called dear to me to get here in this
[1:27:34] waters and suffer like I have what never
[1:27:38] suffered in my life here in the
[1:27:42] wilderness praise God sleeve
[1:27:46] being in a field eating water-soaked
[1:27:50] rolls was not as bad as suffering as
[1:27:54] living amongst bittering bickering
[1:27:57] christians and the church said now you
[1:28:02] know about church splits right sister
[1:28:03] Beatrice you've seen surface
[1:28:04] I've seen some Church myths not here
[1:28:06] we've never had a church but thank God
[1:28:08] but I've talked to brothers the message
[1:28:10] that go through church splits it rips
[1:28:11] their hearts apart
[1:28:13] it totally tears it causes some people
[1:28:17] even to lose the faith it rips people
[1:28:21] apart because a church represents love
[1:28:25] it represents family and when there's
[1:28:28] fighting and what's supposed to be a
[1:28:30] loving family it tears people apart
[1:28:33] roots of bitterness are planted and all
[1:28:36] the thorns grow up and they choke the
[1:28:39] life of God in the churches is that
[1:28:40] right program said I have never suffered
[1:28:47] like this in my life let that soak in
[1:28:52] just for a moment but I believe that in
[1:28:56] doing that and obeying what God command
[1:28:58] to be done God has opened to us the
[1:29:00] mysteries of the last day oh thank you
[1:29:03] lord
[1:29:04] without that there'd be no marriage in
[1:29:06] divorce revelation amen
[1:29:08] holiday right there beating on those
[1:29:11] other great messages that came after
[1:29:14] brother man moved out west in January of
[1:29:16] 63 there never would have been the seven
[1:29:19] seals right there never would have been
[1:29:21] the token then it would have been the
[1:29:22] masterpiece there never been any of
[1:29:24] those other messages had not God drove
[1:29:27] there not from his flourishing church
[1:29:29] his home everything he loved and caused
[1:29:32] him to go in the wilderness so God could
[1:29:34] reveal himself to him oh thank you lord
[1:29:38] hallelujah thank you Jesus then I wonder
[1:29:43] why I got to be away from all my family
[1:29:45] all my five siblings and my mom and dad
[1:29:47] are all on the other side of the state
[1:29:49] and I've got to be all out here all by
[1:29:51] myself sometimes I wonder why I got to
[1:29:53] do that well God's got to do a certain
[1:29:55] thing in Akron Ohio praise God and he
[1:29:58] called me out here
[1:29:59] and I just leave everything I loved in
[1:30:02] order to do what God's called me to do
[1:30:04] preach just be a pastor feed God's sheep
[1:30:08] praise the Lord
[1:30:11] no he skips out a little bit and I look
[1:30:13] what he says and now they need a Sunday
[1:30:17] School teachers talk about Perry greens
[1:30:18] church they're going to need a staff and
[1:30:21] I want to say this to you thoroughly
[1:30:22] understand this is my church now the
[1:30:24] Jeffersonville people never admit this
[1:30:26] but brother man said now that Perry
[1:30:29] green started a message church he said
[1:30:31] this is my church now I don't know if I
[1:30:34] that many people say that how come
[1:30:36] people don't give that quote out to
[1:30:38] people but man said I don't have to
[1:30:40] travel back to Jeffersonville to make a
[1:30:42] tape anymore I can preach it right here
[1:30:45] he said because Peregrine is my
[1:30:46] associate and he said Peregrine believes
[1:30:49] the same message the same way I do
[1:30:52] amen Jeffersonville is not his church
[1:30:57] anymore according this quote because he
[1:30:59] didn't live there anymore
[1:31:00] now he lived in Tucson and his wife
[1:31:03] would visit would go attend brother
[1:31:05] Perry greens church when he was out of
[1:31:07] town that's what he says on this tape
[1:31:11] see how important your home churches
[1:31:13] brother branham and bromium in this tape
[1:31:16] says the only thing that bothered him
[1:31:18] about the Holy Spirit driving him out
[1:31:20] west was there was no home Church there
[1:31:23] he says on this tape he said but he's
[1:31:25] almost crying said but thank God that
[1:31:27] brother Perry followed the leadership of
[1:31:30] the Holy Spirit and he opened up a
[1:31:34] church he says of like precious faith
[1:31:36] hallelujah sometimes we forget how
[1:31:40] important it is or how how much of a
[1:31:42] blessing it is that we have a home
[1:31:43] church that's right that's the only
[1:31:47] thing that bothered brother brother
[1:31:49] Brandon brother Aaron was there was no
[1:31:51] home Church where they were had a
[1:31:52] message Church and a live preacher is
[1:31:55] that right Lydia as you listen to this
[1:31:57] tape it's only it's only 27 minutes long
[1:31:59] you can listen to it on the drive home
[1:32:00] we could too but usually we do the the
[1:32:03] videos for them this sort the Bible
[1:32:05] stories for the kids obviously that's
[1:32:07] like three times last week or this
[1:32:08] weekend just over and over to hear how
[1:32:12] brother branham's so
[1:32:13] ports the home church so much and live
[1:32:16] preaching now look at this this is
[1:32:20] another part of his suffering I've been
[1:32:22] here three years and I've only had one
[1:32:24] door open to me one door one invitation
[1:32:31] to preach and Tucson this is my home now
[1:32:34] I've only got one person invited me to
[1:32:36] preach in three years he says I've never
[1:32:38] suffered like this in my life that was
[1:32:44] brother Mac asked me to come by and
[1:32:46] preach god bless him I haven't been
[1:32:48] invited by any other people not nothing
[1:32:51] against them there all right brother
[1:32:52] Broc a good friend of my brother Gilmore
[1:32:53] ladies Pentecostal brother in here are
[1:32:55] very very good friends of mine I love
[1:32:57] them nothing against them I understand
[1:32:59] their position they can't invite me in
[1:33:02] there and remain there organization see
[1:33:04] they can't do it because if they do
[1:33:05] they're kicked out so you see their
[1:33:07] position I have the same thing to my
[1:33:09] face but may my may it always be seek ye
[1:33:12] first the kingdom of God the will of God
[1:33:14] amen
[1:33:15] I'm so glad nobody can kick me out of
[1:33:18] this trip praise God
[1:33:20] amen you all can vote me out but no
[1:33:22] organization can kick me out because
[1:33:24] we're not tied to man we're tied to
[1:33:27] Christ amen hallelujah and that's what
[1:33:30] we're looking for
[1:33:31] I need a church in Arizona that where it
[1:33:34] believes the same message where I can
[1:33:37] preach where I have open doors he said
[1:33:39] thank God for a man like Perry green and
[1:33:42] what did that what a pair of greens
[1:33:44] Church dude you know out of that church
[1:33:47] spraying all these other wonderful
[1:33:49] loving message churches so before it was
[1:33:53] spiritually dead before the prophet got
[1:33:55] there but after the prophet got there
[1:33:57] preached and let the seed and then the
[1:33:59] the fruits of his of his preaching
[1:34:02] started growing and produce a lot of
[1:34:04] good things Haim ahead it went from
[1:34:06] spiritually dead to spiritually alive
[1:34:09] Amen hallelujah
[1:34:11] hey man thank you Lord that's beautiful
[1:34:15] and now
[1:34:17] the green God has sent him here and
[1:34:19] opened us up a church of like precious
[1:34:21] faith that we believe in we ought to be
[1:34:23] very grateful to God and attend every
[1:34:25] service take every place that we can for
[1:34:30] us to pray to seek let's do business be
[1:34:32] soldiers just be anxious to do it let's
[1:34:34] send our feet here I got one more thing
[1:34:38] I want to say we've got to be careful
[1:34:40] how people use quotes with with
[1:34:42] persecution
[1:34:43] I just want to balance this go this was
[1:34:45] on Facebook I think a few days ago see
[1:34:48] people are quoting brother Branham
[1:34:50] remember if you follow Christ you're
[1:34:52] hated by people for all that live godly
[1:34:54] in christ jesus o selfish of for
[1:34:56] persecutions i just want to bounce this
[1:34:59] quote out because brother Branham was
[1:35:01] hated by some people but not by
[1:35:03] everybody I just want to balance this
[1:35:06] out here's the actual
[1:35:10] remember you follow Christ if you hated
[1:35:12] by people for all the little in Christ
[1:35:14] Jesus shall suffer persecution if you
[1:35:16] come to Christ you'll not come by any
[1:35:17] church or any denomination or any Creed
[1:35:19] you'll come by the blood I'm gonna skip
[1:35:21] ahead look if we look what brother Han
[1:35:23] said the fifth seal did you know this
[1:35:26] progressive some of the best friends
[1:35:28] that I know of our message believers
[1:35:32] know no doubt that's true
[1:35:35] some of the best friends I know of are
[1:35:38] Catholics did you know he said that do
[1:35:43] you realize now Burnham tells his story
[1:35:46] they would not have the bram Tabernacle
[1:35:48] bill unless a Catholic man went into the
[1:35:51] the Jeffersonville government and sit up
[1:35:54] for brother Bram and said give them a
[1:35:55] loan that's what he tells right here a
[1:35:59] Roman Catholic stood to his feet in the
[1:36:01] court and went in front for me boy like
[1:36:03] nobody would do they couldn't turn it
[1:36:06] down that's right so because of a
[1:36:08] Catholic man the brand Tabernacle was
[1:36:10] built I wonder if that man has a reward
[1:36:13] in heaven or if God's gonna say no
[1:36:16] you're Catholic you're going to go to
[1:36:17] hell automatically no I don't think so
[1:36:20] he was one of the good he stood up for
[1:36:22] brother branham he stood up for a
[1:36:23] believer in a time of persecution
[1:36:25] just like gamellia did just like
[1:36:27] Nicodemus did they set up for somebody
[1:36:30] who was so unpopular but so right with
[1:36:33] God in heaven now you keep
[1:36:40] on the story the man said all that
[1:36:42] church I know the pastor that Church has
[1:36:44] been there the rest you can add it why
[1:36:46] can't they Roman Catholic good friend of
[1:36:48] mine see I want to balance that quote
[1:36:52] out some people use that quote saying oh
[1:36:53] you're gonna be hated you are gonna be
[1:36:55] hated by some people but a lot of people
[1:36:58] they're gonna feel your love and you're
[1:37:00] gonna be able to love them and they're
[1:37:02] gonna be able to be your good friends
[1:37:04] brother Jesse you can't have a good
[1:37:05] friend that's a Catholic why not brother
[1:37:07] branham did as long as I don't partake
[1:37:10] of their Hail Marys why can't I have a
[1:37:14] friend that's a Catholic but look what
[1:37:19] he says this boy's a Catholic a real
[1:37:21] loyal friend of mine was talking to me
[1:37:24] he was certain heart he had a certain
[1:37:25] hardware store before I left and said
[1:37:27] Billy I know you don't believe in our
[1:37:28] system of religion he said but I'm
[1:37:31] telling you right now God has honored
[1:37:33] your prayers so much for us I believe if
[1:37:37] you get in trouble anywhere in this
[1:37:38] nation every Catholic in the country
[1:37:40] would come to you now what a good
[1:37:44] testimony that is his testimony wasn't I
[1:37:46] hate you you're Catholic I hate you it
[1:37:49] wasn't that his testimony was can I pray
[1:37:51] for you could I ask God to be merciful
[1:37:54] to you now look what he says
[1:38:04] Catholic or Jew or whatever it is there
[1:38:06] are human off the same tree that we come
[1:38:09] from brother Branham says there are
[1:38:11] people who love and eat and drink and
[1:38:14] sleep and just like anybody else so he
[1:38:16] must never condemn them in jus
[1:38:18] individuals no we mustn't condemn them
[1:38:21] but as a minister I have to strike that
[1:38:23] surfer that's out there just to myself I
[1:38:26] wouldn't do it if it wasn't a commission
[1:38:28] from God that I'm duty-bound to do it I
[1:38:29] must hold that true and faithful it's
[1:38:33] the last one yeah that's the last one
[1:38:34] but a Catholic or do whatever he was
[1:38:37] even if he was a Muslim
[1:38:39] Greek Orthodox whatever he'd be if he
[1:38:42] come here to be prayed for I would just
[1:38:44] pray uh sincerely for him as I would for
[1:38:47] my own that's right certainly because
[1:38:51] why program it's a human being I pray
[1:38:54] for Buddhists Sikhs Jains mohammedans
[1:38:56] every kind you see like that I don't ask
[1:38:59] them no questions I just pray for them
[1:39:00] because there's somebody a human being
[1:39:02] that wants to get well and try to make
[1:39:04] life a little easier along the road for
[1:39:06] them the church says hey man Malik I
[1:39:10] want to come to the piano here how do
[1:39:14] you like that message is that okay the
[1:39:15] way to end that he said I never suffered
[1:39:19] in my life like the end of my life
[1:39:21] because of rejection so I wanted you to
[1:39:24] see all these things he suffered but
[1:39:26] none of them were as hard a suffering as
[1:39:30] a spiritual oppression rejected wars in
[1:39:34] the church no unity nobody invites me no
[1:39:37] no friends I don't know anybody
[1:39:40] everybody's against me there was no
[1:39:43] suffering like that suffering now how
[1:39:48] many other
[1:39:48] says all that live godly in Christ Jesus
[1:39:50] shall suffer persecution well then that
[1:39:53] this thing this is the example a brother
[1:39:55] branham suffering persecution then you
[1:39:57] can switch over to the songs I hope that
[1:40:00] helps somebody tonight because it really
[1:40:01] helped me when I heard him say that I
[1:40:03] was like what did I just hear that I
[1:40:06] hear that right I'd agree I said Siri
[1:40:07] rewind one minute let me hear that again
[1:40:10] I've never suffered like this in all my
[1:40:14] life thank goodness
[1:40:20] that's just our heads for a moment and
[1:40:22] think about the suffering we go through
[1:40:24] and help us let's pray and ask God to
[1:40:27] help us remember it's just temporary
[1:40:29] whatever suffering we go through it
[1:40:32] won't always last it's so small in that
[1:40:36] red line of the rope right in such a
[1:40:39] small little section but we can just be
[1:40:44] faithful that that small red section the
[1:40:48] rest of eternity awaits us of a glorious
[1:40:51] promise an eternal weight of glory he's
[1:40:55] God Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:41:00] tonight

[1:41:54] could relate to it Lord God I feel like
[1:41:57] I've been away from my family and to
[1:41:59] leave everything that was dear to me had

[1:52:07] don't just want to be a Sunday or
[1:52:08] Wednesday Christian we want to be an
[1:52:10] everyday Christian
[1:52:11] hallelujah nor we want to understand our
[1:52:15] what a persecution and trial means for
[1:52:19] today and thank you for helping us
[1:52:22] tonight Lord God to see that sometimes
[1:52:27] rejection and sometimes being alone as
[1:52:32] some of the hardest trials we'll ever
[1:52:33] face in this life but more were
[1:52:36] comforted to know that as you were with
[1:52:38] Moses so you be with Joshua as you were
[1:52:42] with your prophet so shall you be with
[1:52:45] your bride dear come the Lord many of
[1:52:49] these trials are here Lord to drive us
[1:52:52] closer to You Lord God thank you lord
[1:52:55] thank you Lord that you won't let us get
[1:52:58] comfortable here on this earth you won't
[1:53:00] let us for it with the things in the
[1:53:01] world but God you keep drawing us back
[1:53:07] Lord correcting us as a father does his
[1:53:09] sense these trials will push us from
[1:53:15] drive us closer to you
[1:53:20] Lord may it be as you told your prophet
[1:53:24] may you be our portion or God we never
[1:53:29] see Lord retirement as our portion and
[1:53:33] we never see fancy dieting or fit
[1:53:35] worldwide travel as our portion may we
[1:53:39] see eternal life as our portion we're
[1:53:42] headed Lord God we all work to retire we
[1:53:45] all want to eventually do more for you
[1:53:47] but let Lord the comforts of those times
[1:53:51] not be what we're living for but maybe
[1:53:53] the freedom of those times to do more
[1:53:57] for the kingdom of God the Lord now our
[1:54:00] while we are where we are how much the
[1:54:02] work for you help us to find our purpose
[1:54:05] and do something for you Lord God that
[1:54:07] not one day is wasted that we can redeem
[1:54:10] the time because the days are evil dear
[1:54:12] God that we might invest our one talent
[1:54:17] or two or five talents and bear much
[1:54:23] fruit that our Lord would say well done
[1:54:26] good and faithful servant you've been
[1:54:28] faithful a little a little
