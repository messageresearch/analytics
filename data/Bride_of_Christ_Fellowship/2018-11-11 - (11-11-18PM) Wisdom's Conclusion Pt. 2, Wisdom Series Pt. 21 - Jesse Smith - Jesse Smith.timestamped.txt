[28:12] book so very strengthened by the Word of
[28:15] God praise the Lord
[28:17] let's go to verse leave us verse 7 here
[28:21] I'll see you by God's grace we just like
[28:28] to call this again wisdoms conclusion we
[28:30] like to keep with that same thought
[28:32] about the grace of Lord tonight actually
[28:35] verse 9 so please ask these 12 verse 9
[28:48] you know there's so much to learn isn't
[28:52] there for pilgrims like us
[28:53] we're just Pilgrims and strangers this
[28:56] world is not our home how many know that
[28:58] there's so much to learn you know
[29:00] Solomon said you can learn from the ant
[29:02] you can learn the Kony's the rock
[29:05] dwellers you can learn from every little
[29:07] thing jesus said remember Lot's wife we
[29:10] can remember so many things in here in
[29:12] Ecclesiastes we've been learning from a
[29:14] man who had the greatest wisdom to that
[29:16] point but then for sook it for cares of
[29:19] the world and I think if there's ever
[29:20] time we need to forsake things of the
[29:22] world it's now in Laodicea don't you
[29:24] think so where God has given us so much
[29:27] wisdom through the message of the hour
[29:28] this is a great time to forsake all the
[29:31] things of the world and live righteously
[29:33] and godly in this present world the last
[29:35] words we'd say the last written words
[29:37] here of a dying man who started off on
[29:40] fire for the Lord we'd say but then back
[29:43] slid because of lusts my let's go to
[29:47] verse chap I'm sorry chapter 12 verse 9
[29:49] so this morning we ended with verse 8 we
[29:52] did please ask he's 12 1 to 8 this
[29:54] morning let's read verse 9 and moreover
[30:02] because the preacher was why's he still
[30:04] taught the people knowledge yea he gave
[30:05] good heat and sought out and set in
[30:08] order many proverbs the preacher thought
[30:11] I'm sorry the preacher sought to find
[30:13] out acceptable words and that which was
[30:16] written was upright even words of truth
[30:17] the words of the wise are as goads and
[30:20] as nails fastened by the Masters of
[30:22] Assemblies which are given from one
[30:25] Shepherd and further by these my son be
[30:28] admonished of of making many books there
[30:31] is no end the much study I'm sorry and
[30:34] much study is a weariness of the flesh
[30:37] let us hear the conclusion of the whole
[30:39] matter fear God and keep his
[30:41] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[30:43] of man for God shall bring every work
[30:45] into judgment with every secret thing
[30:47] whether it be good or whether be evil
[30:50] let's have a word of Prayer if you have
[30:51] a need on your heart let's make it known
[30:53] into the Lord and let's pray here
[30:54] tonight in God's presence Heavenly
[30:57] Father were grateful Lord for your
[30:59] promises you promise to never leave us
[31:01] or forsake us Lord
[31:02] we're happy to sing your songs Lord and
[31:05] we know Lord you're the lily of the
[31:06] valley dear God you're the bright and
[31:08] Morning Star you're the fairest of ten
[31:10] thousand to our souls Lord just
[31:12] breathing the name of Jesus makes our
[31:15] souls happy dear God we're happy to be
[31:17] here tonight happy to sing to the name
[31:19] of Jesus what a friend we have in you
[31:21] Lord God thank you for being our friend
[31:24] Lord and father help us to just keep all
[31:26] your word and Lord serve you and please
[31:29] you Lord and be a faithful friend to you
[31:31] thank you for your eternal friendship
[31:33] your faithfulness Lord God your constant
[31:37] companionship Lord in this life as we
[31:40] said Lord we're pilgrims and strangers
[31:41] give us wisdom Lord on this earthly
[31:43] journey tonight Lord as we we aim to
[31:46] finish out this book Lord I pray God you
[31:49] bless us in your divine presence with
[31:50] your wisdom in Jesus Christ's name and
[31:53] the church said amen god bless you
[31:55] didn't see the praise the Lord now
[32:00] remember the word Ecclesiastes means the
[32:02] preacher so this book has been written
[32:05] from the perspective of a preacher let
[32:08] me set my timer so don't wear myself out
[32:09] here and of course we know this was
[32:13] solomon's book probably one of his last
[32:15] books because we find him at the end of
[32:17] his life here we find him he's tried
[32:19] everything remember we preached earlier
[32:20] in this series he tried the five W's and
[32:22] I can't remember them now but you know
[32:24] women and wine and wealth and I can't
[32:26] remember the last 200 words mailman's
[32:28] wisdom was one of them I can't remember
[32:30] the other one but he had tried
[32:31] everything he'd you know he'd left God
[32:34] he backs it on God and he said I'll just
[32:35] try to get mirth I'll just try to get
[32:37] happiness through any of these means and
[32:39] he found out it was all vanity it was
[32:42] all temporary in other words it wasn't
[32:43] going to last and here he comes down to
[32:46] his final words and he as we began this
[32:48] chapter remember the creator in the days
[32:51] of your youth because there if you if
[32:54] you get old there's going to be days
[32:55] where your body starts breaking down
[32:57] your backs gonna Bend like a bow Sothis
[33:00] there's all this morning your eyes are
[33:02] the windows of your eyes are gonna close
[33:04] the windows of your ears are gonna close
[33:06] it's gonna get hard to hear and there's
[33:09] gonna be all these hardships physically
[33:11] that come upon you so Solomon says
[33:14] remember God's spiritually you
[33:16] be strong spiritually so when your
[33:18] physical body goes out your spirit is
[33:21] ready to meet God amen and that's what
[33:24] we want we want our spirits to be ready
[33:26] to meet God we want to be at peace with
[33:28] God we want to be in love with God we
[33:30] want to be pleasing to God that's what
[33:33] we desire amen
[33:34] and so let's look at verse 9 and 10 here
[33:36] we already read it for our text but I
[33:38] just want to just say it mention a few
[33:39] things about it these are the author's
[33:41] parting exhortations verse 9 and
[33:44] moreover because the preacher was why's
[33:47] he still taught the people knowledge
[33:49] yeah he gave good heat and sought out
[33:52] and set in order many proverbs so see
[33:56] even at the end of his life he got to
[33:57] the point where he was still still
[33:59] trying to give people wise things and
[34:01] words of wisdom look at verse 10 the
[34:04] preacher sought to find out acceptable
[34:06] words and that which was written was
[34:08] upright even words of truth and God
[34:11] bless a man and God blessed a woman that
[34:13] wants to find the truth praise God
[34:15] there's so much lies out there you can
[34:18] find on your phone or on the internet or
[34:20] something like that there's so many lies
[34:22] out there there's so many things you can
[34:23] seek after but this preacher was seeking
[34:26] out acceptable words what would be good
[34:28] to tell the people what would help the
[34:30] people and that's why we administer as
[34:32] we study and pray what's going to help
[34:34] the people and there's one thing that's
[34:36] going to help you that's the truth of
[34:37] God's word amen the true words of God
[34:40] has it helped you today I hope it has
[34:42] helped you today by God's grace the
[34:44] words of truth acceptable words is
[34:47] what's gonna help you tonight
[34:49] now look at 1st Kings 432 maybe if Lily
[34:52] can just pull it up there because we
[34:53] want to stay in Ecclesiastes first Kings
[34:56] 432 this was a man who was fully given
[34:59] over
[35:00] he was just uh we would say inspired of
[35:03] God to collect all these words and all
[35:05] these proverbs all these words of wisdom
[35:07] look at the Bible said he spake 3,000
[35:10] proverbs and his songs were a thousand
[35:13] and five he imagined he gets the end of
[35:18] his life and it seems like at the end of
[35:19] life here as it says the preacher was he
[35:22] still taught the people knowledge so
[35:24] even though he back slid all these years
[35:26] and no we know he served Israel
[35:28] forty years but after a couple decades
[35:30] there he began to fall away he must have
[35:33] come back at the end and he was still
[35:35] seeking out wise words and he still
[35:38] wanted to teach the people the knowledge
[35:40] about God and we know as a total he came
[35:44] up with about three thousand proverbs
[35:47] amen
[35:47] which was good for the people and his
[35:51] songs were a thousand five so this man
[35:54] knew the wisdom of God and I'll say like
[35:55] this he knew how to worship praise God
[35:58] Amen aren't you glad that we have the
[36:00] Word of God and that we have the wisdom
[36:02] of God and we can sing and worship God
[36:04] with wisdom today praise God amen
[36:07] because remember Solomon was great but
[36:09] we have to make sure we said it last
[36:10] Sunday we have to make sure we don't
[36:12] exalt him too high he was wisest of his
[36:16] day but then Jesus a thousand years
[36:18] later comes and says that John the
[36:20] Baptist is even greater than Solomon
[36:22] there's no wolf there's no man born
[36:24] among women that's greater than John the
[36:26] Baptist amen
[36:28] because he didn't just talk about the
[36:30] word or get inspired he actually held
[36:32] the Word of God he baptized the Word of
[36:34] God he pointed the people he said behold
[36:37] the lamb of God who takes away the sin
[36:39] of the world amen he got to hold the
[36:42] word point to the word and see the Holy
[36:44] Spirit descend like a dove and so there
[36:46] was no man greater and he was and we
[36:48] know he was so great because look at the
[36:50] consecrated life that he lived amen for
[36:53] thirty years he was not well most of
[36:55] those I think handsome he was nine he
[36:57] went out there so for twenty-one years
[36:59] he was out in the wilderness away from
[37:01] denominations away from women which
[37:04] Solomon couldn't keep away from which on
[37:06] the Baptist kept away from it he chose
[37:09] to live with scorpions and serpents and
[37:11] and camels and he chose to live out
[37:14] there because he was so consecrated to
[37:16] God amen hallelujah talk about wisdom to
[37:20] see though it becomes it becomes this no
[37:23] matter how much in numerals no matter
[37:26] how many written proverbs you can write
[37:30] down no matter how many details you can
[37:32] memorize or or how many scriptures you
[37:34] can collect or how many message books
[37:36] you can collect it shows it's not about
[37:38] the number of about what you know it's a
[37:41] what's been lived out in what's been
[37:43] applied to your heart cuz Solomon had
[37:47] 3000 but those 3,000 weren't enough to
[37:50] keep him away from those 1000 women you
[37:53] understand numbers so it's not about how
[37:56] much revelation you have it's about what
[37:59] you do with what you've got praise God
[38:01] amen that's what we're saying it's not
[38:04] about and don't get me wrong Church it
[38:06] is so powerful to read your Bible read
[38:08] the message books and listen to brother
[38:09] Branham which I've been enjoying this
[38:10] week I'm halfway through Christ of the
[38:12] mystery of God revealed it's a four hour
[38:13] sermon I'm just going through it real
[38:15] slow I've been listening to it all week
[38:16] yesterday I spent a couple hours on it
[38:18] spend about an hour on this morning just
[38:20] listening and oh it just raises your
[38:21] faith you know it's such a blessing so I
[38:24] don't we're not going to diminish from
[38:26] that because member Paul with the Holy
[38:28] Ghost tells the preachers give yourself
[38:31] to read and give yourself wholly to
[38:32] reading and exhortation and study that
[38:35] the people might see your gains they
[38:37] might see your gift improve unto God so
[38:41] we got to balance that out later in this
[38:43] chapter
[38:43] but it see it's not so much about what
[38:45] we know it's about what we really
[38:47] believe praise God that's exactly right
[38:50] so see 3,000 proverbs aren't enough to
[38:55] save somebody from a thousand women if
[38:57] you're not fully devoted to the Word of
[38:59] God in other words if you won't crucify
[39:01] the lust of the flesh if you won't
[39:04] croute if you won't die out daily as
[39:06] Paul said if you won't die out daily
[39:08] this message isn't going to be powerful
[39:10] in your life unless you apply it to your
[39:12] life amen
[39:15] that's exactly right so see what good is
[39:18] 3000 with words of wisdom without a
[39:21] surrendered heart to Christ amen how
[39:26] many want a surrendered heart to God
[39:27] that's what it all boils down to brother
[39:31] Branham said those theologians the days
[39:32] of Jesus they had the Bible memorized
[39:34] course they had the mission of memorized
[39:36] to unfortunately which was it Matt
[39:38] they're man-made interpretation of the
[39:40] law so they added a book to the Bible
[39:43] right they added on to the Bible and the
[39:46] Bible says if you add to the Bible you
[39:48] add plagues to your life so they had all
[39:51] that knowledge and they stood there
[39:53] watching Jesus do these
[39:54] and Jesus would discern their hearts and
[39:57] they get upset
[39:58] well here comes a prostitute woman a
[39:59] woman at the well Jesus discerns our
[40:01] heart one time and it sets her soul
[40:03] afire amen she runs into the town and
[40:06] tells them look he told me all the
[40:08] things that I've ever done
[40:09] isn't this the Messiah to see it's not
[40:12] how much you know it's about what you
[40:15] really believe and accept and put to
[40:17] application in your life praise God see
[40:20] she could actually be honest with
[40:22] herself yes I have done this with these
[40:24] men I have been filthy but I can
[40:26] recognize God's presence and it's a
[40:28] reality and I know I'm never going back
[40:30] to that I'm gonna go testify to the
[40:32] people and tell them and it will
[40:33] actually have an effect on people's
[40:35] lives amen hallelujah thank God for the
[40:40] power in the gospel it's still doing
[40:42] that today praise God a man is still
[40:44] doing that today I don't I don't know
[40:46] the caller hice high school mentor he's
[40:49] a father one of my friends and he called
[40:51] me up and last week and he just said
[40:52] Jesse I just want to tell you how proud
[40:53] I am of you he said I don't even know
[40:55] how you're doing what you're doing you
[40:56] you work a full-time job you Pastor and
[40:59] then you preach and you do all these
[41:01] things you make the YouTube videos he
[41:03] said I don't even know how you doing I
[41:04] said I said friend I said it's all by
[41:06] the grace of God it's only by Paul said
[41:10] if he said my labor more than all of you
[41:13] it wasn't me laboring but it was Christ
[41:15] in me it was the grace of God that was
[41:17] in me the grace of God has done this and
[41:19] everything we do people can look at our
[41:21] lives and see my there's been a great
[41:23] change I'm so glad that God showed me
[41:25] that people are watching my life we
[41:27] don't hear from them from years but
[41:29] they're watching our lives they're
[41:30] hearing about our lives our lives speak
[41:32] volumes our lives are casting out the
[41:35] bread upon the waters and that bread
[41:37] will return unto us amen hallelujah oh
[41:40] it's such a privilege to be a Christian
[41:42] how many of you say amen to that
[41:44] our lives are speaking loud if we can
[41:47] even speak and that's what we want real
[41:49] Christian character speaks louder than a
[41:51] sermon amen glory so see it's it's good
[41:56] to seek out words but it's better to
[41:58] live what you have first rather than
[42:01] trying to have the most revelation the
[42:03] most scriptures on this topic you know
[42:05] we used to do that when we first cover
[42:06] the message see who could get you know
[42:07] John and I and differ
[42:08] we see how many scriptures we could get
[42:10] on topic which was fine but that's not
[42:13] the number of scriptures that you have
[42:15] it's the number it's the amount of
[42:17] obedience in your heart to the word it's
[42:20] good to want to have a foolproof you
[42:22] know completely true doctrine oh that's
[42:24] good that's good but we need a
[42:26] surrendered heart to love Jesus and and
[42:28] do whatever his spear would ask us to do
[42:31] amen
[42:32] now let's go to verse 11 that's kind of
[42:34] like the first thought there these are
[42:36] is these are Solomon's last exhortation
[42:39] he's got to come down to the end of his
[42:41] life he's tried everything
[42:44] see member he saw God twice seeing God
[42:47] twice was enough to keep him from of
[42:49] those all those women see that that all
[42:53] approved us right there Lord let my let
[42:55] my anchor not being experiences or maybe
[42:58] just spiritual gifts but let it be in my
[43:02] remember I love for you praise God let
[43:05] me have a love for you that no matter
[43:06] what experiences I have I thank God for
[43:08] those experiences but let my heart be
[43:10] surrendered so much so on a daily basis
[43:13] that I'll never back side and fall away
[43:15] from your presence Amen thank God I
[43:18] thank God for experiences but I know my
[43:21] life has to tally up to the Word of God
[43:23] every single day if I take a day off
[43:25] that's a day I lost and now I got to
[43:27] repent and get it right back to God amen
[43:30] if not it's going to keep falling
[43:31] further and further away like the
[43:33] snowball down the hill we don't want
[43:35] that effect we don't want that effect is
[43:37] as far as sin we want to grow closer and
[43:40] stronger the Bible said the light shines
[43:42] more unto a perfect day praise God
[43:44] a life that's more holy on a life that's
[43:47] more like Christ amen verse 11 now I
[43:52] want to bring verse 11 is quite full
[43:54] brother Ram said numerous things about
[43:56] this so this is a quite a jam-packed
[43:58] scripture with some different thoughts
[44:00] in here so I'm going to take a little
[44:02] bit time I imagine this scripture will
[44:03] have the most on it in this little short
[44:05] message here
[44:07] all right verse 11 the words of the wise
[44:10] are as goads he's come down to the end
[44:14] of his life and as nails fastened by the
[44:17] Masters of assemblies is anything about
[44:20] this sound particularly comfort
[44:22] right now nails wise words are like
[44:26] nails does anyone think of a nail and
[44:28] think oh that's comforting that's sweet
[44:31] and soft and kind well maybe but I don't
[44:33] know what nails you got cuz I know the
[44:35] nails in my house are pretty sharp
[44:37] I've stepped on a nail when I was
[44:39] younger I'd get a tetanus shot cuz I
[44:40] stepped on nail went right through my
[44:41] shoe right into my foot I think I was
[44:43] about 9 or 10 years old that was not
[44:46] very comforting the Bible says the words
[44:49] of why so Solomon knew this and then of
[44:51] his life wise words when preached to us
[44:54] are going to be sharp like nails
[44:57] and as nails they're fastened by the
[45:02] Masters of assembly which are given from
[45:05] one Shepherd now church you know there's
[45:09] only one Shepherd and it's not me I'm a
[45:13] shepherd but I'm not one Shepherd
[45:15] there's only one Shepherd and that's
[45:17] Jesus Christ the chief shepherd but
[45:20] there are masters masters of assembly
[45:25] somebody look at a little bit of
[45:27] background here now according to the
[45:29] background Solomon is using a pastoral
[45:32] metaphor this is how he closes out his
[45:36] life here he says wise warriors will be
[45:39] like a goad and if you ever seen a goad
[45:41] it's like a stick with a sharp point on
[45:44] one end now there's different shapes
[45:45] I've seen them online there's different
[45:47] shapes of goats kind of like Shepherd
[45:48] staffs and the nails or points are
[45:53] inserted at the end of the sticks you
[45:54] have a big stick and they stick a nail
[45:57] at the end of it there they drill a hole
[45:58] and that's got this nail sticking out of
[46:00] the end now this is the scripture and
[46:05] the Bible actually backs it up in 1st
[46:07] Samuel 13 21 it said yet they had a file
[46:11] for the Mattocks which are weapons and
[46:13] for the Coulter's and for the hooks and
[46:16] for the axes and to sharpen the goads
[46:18] can you pull out their Lydia first
[46:20] Samuel 13 21 so he says wise words are
[46:26] as goads
[46:28] so you could have a go you could have a
[46:30] stick now here Israel was going out to
[46:33] fight
[46:35] and so when they're going out to fight
[46:37] the Philistines that the sharpen their
[46:38] guns so a gold was a stick of course to
[46:43] keep animals in line and the shepherd
[46:45] animals so you could have a goat and it
[46:47] could have a sharp nail or dull nail now
[46:52] which one does God always have God has a
[46:54] sharp sharp nail the Bible said the Word
[46:58] of God is what dull no that's how we get
[47:00] we get dull right God's Word is sharp
[47:04] and sharper than any double-edged sword
[47:06] and it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[47:09] intents of the heart
[47:10] when God speaks to us church we should
[47:12] expect something sharp from God
[47:14] something and I don't have to be loud
[47:16] like I'm getting loud because I'm
[47:17] getting excited but they don't have to
[47:18] be loud it can just be something that
[47:20] just shakes you right there as you're
[47:21] reading your Bible in the morning or
[47:23] you're going to bed it just kind of
[47:24] shakes you up there I never thought
[47:26] about that but anytime the Word of God
[47:30] comes Solomon says the words of wise are
[47:33] like goats now see Israel to sharpen
[47:37] there's God don't ever have to sharpen
[47:38] his it's perpetual sharp it's
[47:42] continually sharp God can't get a better
[47:45] more sharper word God can't get a better
[47:47] word or you know an improved message
[47:50] know God's Word is always sharp it's
[47:52] always on time and always cut right down
[47:54] to the core of your being amen
[47:56] it always speak right to your soul how
[47:59] many thank God for that oh praise God
[48:03] amen now so see this is a go now look
[48:09] this is the same word in acts 26 14
[48:13] Lydia / pull this up here let me know
[48:17] that Paul was a real good chef or a real
[48:19] good sheep Paul stood on like a sheep
[48:21] going to slaughter all the day long but
[48:23] there's a time he wasn't such a good
[48:25] shepherd sheep rather there's a time
[48:28] that Paul kicks against the goads right
[48:32] how many could say Amen
[48:33] that you're you're a sheep but there was
[48:36] a time when you were kicking against the
[48:37] goads I've always been a sheep I've
[48:40] never been a go I don't know about you
[48:42] but I've never been a goat I've always
[48:44] been a sheep I just didn't understand I
[48:46] was a sheep praise God
[48:49] I never got changed from a goat to a
[48:52] sheep I have a lorries been a sheep but
[48:54] for a while I just needed a lot of
[48:55] pricks from the goat and the church said
[49:00] you were never a goat because whatever
[49:04] you were whenever si was in that was in
[49:06] you at the beginning it's always been in
[49:08] you praise God hey man you've always
[49:11] been a sheep you've always been a child
[49:14] of God you just didn't know it amen but
[49:17] now you know it Amen and this is what
[49:19] God was doing the paw all these years
[49:21] Paul was putting Christians you know in
[49:24] prison and he was trying to get them to
[49:26] blaspheme Jesus and say y'all you say
[49:29] you don't believe in Jesus the Bible
[49:30] says that I mean that and when they were
[49:32] off onto the earth I heard a voice
[49:34] speaking unto me saying in the Hebrew
[49:36] tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me
[49:38] it's hard for you to kick against these
[49:41] bricks amen
[49:43] it's hard Paul now look what the word
[49:46] means it means an iron goad for urging
[49:51] on oxen horses or other beasts of burden
[49:55] hence the proverb the kids kick against
[49:57] the goat to offer vain and perilous ruin
[50:00] is a ruinous existence in other words
[50:04] Paul was just vainly kicking against it
[50:06] when he would take people off when he
[50:08] would take Christians to church he was
[50:09] just kicking against the goads he was
[50:12] fighting a losing battle and I'm so glad
[50:14] when we were sinners we were fighting a
[50:16] losing battle
[50:17] Satan was not going to get the victory
[50:19] over us Amen God was going to deliver us
[50:22] we were kicking against the pricks Jesus
[50:25] was gonna was going to keep chasing us
[50:27] and correcting us until we finally
[50:29] surrendered to Jesus amen
[50:33] that's what the Bible says he was
[50:35] kicking against the pricks of the one
[50:36] Shepherd hallelujah oh I'm so thankful
[50:41] for that Paul kicked against the goad
[50:45] you and I kicked against the go-to but
[50:48] God was merciful to us aren't you glad
[50:50] first mercy aren't you glad he had to go
[50:53] there to get you straightened out to get
[50:54] you to finally repent finally surrender
[50:57] finally shot stop trying to impress the
[51:00] world or impress our friends
[51:02] aren't you glad you had that prick there
[51:04] to cut you and to Humble you and to
[51:06] bring you into obedience I'm so glad he
[51:08] did it for me praise God amen the Bible
[51:16] said that these goats pierced I'm sorry
[51:20] Solomon says that goats pierce deeply
[51:23] into your mind so when you hear a wittle
[51:25] word of wisdom from the Holy Spirit it
[51:28] will pierce into your mind if your mind
[51:30] is able to receive it wise words are
[51:36] inspired words so when you hear a wise
[51:40] word it should encourage you it's just
[51:42] strengthened you to action because
[51:45] wisdom is not a passive thing wisdom is
[51:48] an active thing wisdom doesn't hold back
[51:52] on God wisdom moves the Bible said
[51:55] wisdom hath builded her house how many
[51:57] understand what I'm talking about when
[51:59] you receive the wisdom of God you start
[52:01] building you start going to work you
[52:03] start doing what God has instructed you
[52:05] to do wisdom is an action word we're
[52:08] acting out the will of God yes that's
[52:13] exactly right
[52:15] and now one one commentator says the
[52:20] Bible says they're fastened there as
[52:22] nails fastened and so one commentator
[52:26] says they're fastened in the memory like
[52:29] nails now that's a-that's that's one
[52:31] that's one interpretation they have
[52:33] there that there's fastened so the Word
[52:38] of God when the Word of God gives you
[52:40] instruction and it's the wisdom of God
[52:42] it should be fastened in our mind we
[52:45] should remember time search if we come
[52:47] here long enough we should remember
[52:48] times when it seemed like God was
[52:50] speaking directly to us because it was
[52:53] just fast and in your heart God just
[52:55] spoke something he knew you needed it
[52:58] maybe when brother Joe was here brother
[52:59] Ben deraad was here but maybe God just
[53:02] spoke something so personal to you it
[53:04] should be fast and it was so sharp it
[53:07] was like it was fast or fastened in your
[53:09] mind and you'll always remember that and
[53:11] you'll always thank God for that do you
[53:15] think saw
[53:15] we know I'll say like this we know saw
[53:18] never Paul never forgot when God smoked
[53:20] him on the road to emmaus because
[53:21] decades later he tells King Agrippa all
[53:23] about it
[53:24] amen he said I was on the road he said
[53:27] that the light struck me down and said
[53:29] saw saw and he's testifying and and it
[53:32] was such a powerful testimony that he
[53:34] said Saul you almost persuade persuade
[53:36] me to be a Christian and he said I wish
[53:38] you were like me except for these bonds
[53:40] I wish you had the Holy Ghost like me I
[53:43] wish you love Jesus Christ like me
[53:45] except you weren't in prison like I Oh
[53:47] what a tender heart Paul had he wanted
[53:50] to see even the king agrippa repent and
[53:53] serve God and though those words of
[53:55] wisdom never left him they stayed with
[53:57] him
[53:58] praise God let me this reminds me it's
[54:03] go to acts 20 I believe this reminds me
[54:12] some of those nails fastened in the
[54:16] memory of song it's actually actually
[54:29] acts 26 this is before Agrippa that's
[54:31] right yeah Amen this is ad 62 let's see
[54:37] what the year was let's see what butcher
[54:42] says about this when Saul got converted
[54:44] okay so apparently Saul got converted in
[54:47] 8035 my and almost thirty years later he
[54:51] still remembers those words fastened in
[54:53] his heart hallelujah Church honestly we
[54:57] should remember when we were saved like
[54:59] it was yesterday if God really spoke a
[55:02] word of wisdom if we really got a
[55:03] heavenly touch it should be so fastened
[55:06] on our mind that we could instantly
[55:07] testify about it to anybody in the
[55:09] congregation ah thirty years later he
[55:15] still can't get away from when the Holy
[55:17] Ghost spoke to him Dave man I hope
[55:20] you're feeling good like I am praise God
[55:21] oh mercy
[55:24] thirty years later look what he said
[55:28] verse 16 26 16 but lies and stand upon
[55:34] thy feet for I've appeared only for this
[55:36] purpose to make the administer and the
[55:39] witness both of these things which thou
[55:41] has seen and of those things in which I
[55:44] will appear unto thee so if someone has
[55:48] pawpaw what's the purpose of God for
[55:49] your life he could say the Holy Spirit
[55:52] told me the Holy Spirit told me I'm
[55:55] gonna be a minister and a witness how
[55:59] many here know that you're supposed to
[56:00] be a witness as well because when the
[56:02] Holy Ghost fell the Bible said they were
[56:04] witnesses unto Judea and Jerusalem and
[56:07] all the uttermost parts of the earth
[56:09] hallelujah Church all's we've got to be
[56:11] is a witness to our children we've got
[56:14] to be a witness on the job we just got a
[56:15] witness and say well they might not work
[56:17] for them but Jesus work for me praise
[56:20] God you just gotta be a witness I don't
[56:23] know about the other guy don't know why
[56:24] they made these decisions but I know
[56:26] when I cried out to God God answered my
[56:28] prayer you just got to be a witness we
[56:31] just need the grace of God to witness
[56:33] the power of God he said be a minister
[56:37] and a witness this is your your whole
[56:39] purpose in life to be a servant
[56:41] preaching and then to be a witness of
[56:44] the power of God and then he says I'm
[56:46] gonna show you more things when I appear
[56:49] unto you is that what that says and of
[56:51] those things in which I will appear unto
[56:53] thee how many right there right now you
[56:54] you're looking to see what God wants you
[56:56] do in the future is anybody right there
[56:58] see how you're gonna be a minister and a
[57:01] witness and of all the things that I'm
[57:03] gonna show you that's my desire that's
[57:06] what I'm looking for right now Lord
[57:07] what's the next step brother Ram was
[57:09] always was often thinking about that
[57:10] what's the next step what is that what's
[57:13] the next leadership of the Holy Spirit
[57:14] and so see that that means we just can't
[57:18] coast we've got to be constantly
[57:19] listening to the voice of the Holy
[57:20] Spirit to wait for him to appear unto us
[57:23] again oh oh that's my prayer God appear
[57:27] to me again show yourself to me again so
[57:30] I can hear your word thank you Jesus Oh
[57:34] glory look at this delivering me from
[57:37] the people see gods of God deliverance
[57:39] he delivered me from all those sinners
[57:41] I used to hang out all those friends I
[57:43] used to hang out with what Jesus do he
[57:45] delivered me from them they were trying
[57:47] to kill me Jesus was trying to save me
[57:50] praise God and from the Gentiles and
[57:53] under whom now I send thee look at this
[57:57] verse 18 to open their eyes and to turn
[58:00] them from darkness to light and from the
[58:02] power of Satan unto God that they may
[58:06] receive forgiveness of sins and
[58:07] inheritance among them which are
[58:09] sanctified by the faith that is in me
[58:11] what a powerful testimony is this what
[58:14] you feel Church I hope you feel this I
[58:17] hope your eyes have been opened has the
[58:19] eye salve of God been rubbed all over
[58:20] your eyes can you see what's actually
[58:23] can you see what's happening in this
[58:25] world our eyes should be open and we
[58:28] should be turned we should be leaving
[58:30] the things of darkness and we should be
[58:32] in the power of light and we should be
[58:34] in the power of God not the power of
[58:37] Satan this is why Jesus appeared to him
[58:40] and he was kicking against that can you
[58:42] imagine an animal kicking against it all
[58:44] those years he was kicking I don't want
[58:46] to do that I can't no Jesus can't be the
[58:48] Messiah
[58:48] he's kicking against it he's kicking
[58:50] against it and Jesus finally says why
[58:53] are you kicking against the pricks it's
[58:56] it's vain it's impossible you're not
[58:59] gonna win if you wrestle against God so
[59:01] instead of fighting God why don't you
[59:03] surrender to God hey man and if we're
[59:07] wrestling about the will of God in our
[59:08] lives
[59:09] let's not wrestle let's surrender Church
[59:12] many times you probably seen with other
[59:13] people and maybe your life too many
[59:15] times when we struggle with the will of
[59:17] God many times is because we already
[59:19] know what we're supposed to do we're
[59:21] just not doing it we know what we're
[59:24] supposed to do but we're just don't we
[59:27] just don't we're a little stubborn and
[59:28] we just don't want to do what God's
[59:30] called us to do and the church said most
[59:35] of time we already know but see we're
[59:39] just kicking against it and it's useless
[59:40] to do it it's useless to waste your time
[59:43] hurting yourself getting chasing by God
[59:47] it's it's worthless to do that it'd be
[59:49] better just to humble yourself and obey
[59:53] amen
[59:57] praise God it's hard for you to kick
[1:00:02] against the pricks I'm so glad that
[1:00:03] people can see I'm under the power of
[1:00:05] God and I'm not on the power of Satan
[1:00:07] anymore
[1:00:07] I thank God that people call me up 20
[1:00:09] years later and say you're really
[1:00:11] serving the Lord amen that's what I want
[1:00:14] I want the life of Christ to flow
[1:00:16] through me I want to shine his light
[1:00:18] deep into the night praise God
[1:00:20] amen now look at this so we get two
[1:00:24] ideas from the scripture two more wise
[1:00:28] Warriors are going to pierce your heart
[1:00:30] and mind because on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:32] Peter preached a five-minute sermon and
[1:00:34] three thousand people said our hearts
[1:00:36] are pricked 9 I'm looking at all you
[1:00:40] church people worship that's what we
[1:00:42] need we need worship that me gets people
[1:00:44] pricked amen we know honey Dupree
[1:00:47] sermons that'll prick people's hearts
[1:00:49] amen he preached a five-minute sermon
[1:00:53] after seeing people dancing the spirit
[1:00:55] of speaking tongues and praise the Lord
[1:00:57] and said well let me at this he says
[1:00:59] this is that which Joel prophesied of
[1:01:01] all she did was say this is a
[1:01:03] fulfillment this day that scripture from
[1:01:06] Joel is fulfilled that 800 year old
[1:01:08] scripture is happening right now we're
[1:01:10] prophesying we're speaking the Word of
[1:01:12] God and 3,000 people got convicted nah I
[1:01:15] want a part of that baptize me in the
[1:01:18] name of Lord Jesus Christ amen that's
[1:01:23] what the power of the gospel does it
[1:01:25] pricks the hearts and the day of
[1:01:27] Pentecost 3,000 hearts were pricked so
[1:01:30] they must have been kicking against the
[1:01:32] goads they must have been kicking all
[1:01:34] that time because our hearts are pricked
[1:01:37] aah
[1:01:37] I'm paying this this word is to serve my
[1:01:40] heart
[1:01:44] remember the Word of God is sharp
[1:01:46] piercing and this divides asunder the
[1:01:48] soul from spirit right so in other words
[1:01:52] wisdom is supposed to break conviction
[1:01:54] to you conviction wisdom is
[1:02:00] supposed to be fastened in your memory
[1:02:02] and I know like it's like this wisdom
[1:02:05] will Pradas along and keep us on the
[1:02:08] straight and narrow but is it
[1:02:12] comfortable church to be prodded along
[1:02:14] by one Shepherd with a big sharp goat on
[1:02:17] the end of a stick is that comfortable
[1:02:19] never never I can never find an animal
[1:02:23] that liked to be proud of the law did
[1:02:27] you ever find one Liddy's ever seen an
[1:02:30] animal it likes to be beaten and abuse
[1:02:32] any horses that like to be bitten no I
[1:02:34] didn't think so no animal likes it they
[1:02:38] don't like the pain but the Bible says
[1:02:40] here Solomon realized many times humans
[1:02:44] are stubborn right because we got part
[1:02:47] of us that's a beast right this fleshly
[1:02:50] man's a beast he's the enemy against God
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] you've got a party that's a beast and
[1:02:57] then the soul man which is divine but
[1:02:59] many times in our mind we said of living
[1:03:02] from the soul we live from the flesh and
[1:03:04] so God has two products alone poke us
[1:03:07] and get us thrown getting obedience it
[1:03:11] has to pierce us so we'll walk obedient
[1:03:13] to the Holy Spirit brother madam call
[1:03:19] gospel protoplasm spanking he calls it a
[1:03:23] spiritual smack that's true promise
[1:03:29] alone though one Shepherds got a
[1:03:31] Protestant long you know it actually be
[1:03:33] more wise if you did this brother Jesse
[1:03:35] you know what actually it's foolish to
[1:03:38] keep doing this what you're doing sister
[1:03:39] it'd be more wise if you just did this
[1:03:41] and the Lord will just prod you and cut
[1:03:44] you along like that you should have done
[1:03:46] the wise thing and you feel oh you feel
[1:03:50] cut that's right I should have let me
[1:03:53] understand what I'm talking about this
[1:03:57] is what this is what Solomon learns so I
[1:04:00] wonder how many times when he would take
[1:04:01] I wonder when he took this let's just
[1:04:04] say the 25th wife or the Jose I wonder
[1:04:06] if he felt got a little proud from the
[1:04:08] Lord like okay you're you have enough
[1:04:10] wives now let's say 31 you've got enough
[1:04:13] wives for each day of the month
[1:04:15] I wondered at what time was he prodded
[1:04:19] that's enough it's enough I wonder how
[1:04:23] many of his counselors came and said now
[1:04:25] Solomon you know what Deuteronomy says a
[1:04:27] man that has many wives he's gonna have
[1:04:29] a lot of trouble and I wonder if those
[1:04:30] words were just like prods that he just
[1:04:32] kept I don't care what you say I'm the
[1:04:35] king I've got all this money I can do
[1:04:37] whatever I want
[1:04:41] same thing for us we know God's truth we
[1:04:45] know what the word says but there's just
[1:04:46] something stubborn about us and so God
[1:04:50] has to Pradas God leads his dear
[1:04:54] children on some through the waters some
[1:04:57] through the floods all great all through
[1:04:59] great trials but all through the blood
[1:05:02] it'll all work out God's not going to
[1:05:04] get he's not gonna cast you away like
[1:05:05] we're talking about lunch with brother
[1:05:06] Jason God's not gonna cast us away but
[1:05:09] he may have to purify us a little more
[1:05:12] he may have to take us through some
[1:05:14] fires of purification some prods of
[1:05:16] Correction this is what he learns at the
[1:05:20] end after 40 years of ministry we'll say
[1:05:23] like that 40 years of leading Israel
[1:05:26] these are his final words this is how
[1:05:28] God corrects his people so wisdom
[1:05:32] from one shepherd that's the holy spirit
[1:05:35] I'm just a minor shepherd but I have to
[1:05:39] answer to the chief shepherd Jesus
[1:05:40] Christ off to answer for this sermon
[1:05:43] tonight off to answer for this morning's
[1:05:45] message that's why I want to make sure
[1:05:46] it lines up with the Word of God with
[1:05:48] what the prophets said about the Word of
[1:05:50] God I want it all to dovetail together
[1:05:51] because I wanted to be acceptable in the
[1:05:54] sight of my shepherd
[1:05:56] look her brother have says about rod and
[1:05:58] staff and a member of gold was like a
[1:06:00] staff and the Bible says thy rod and thy
[1:06:02] staff they comfort me
[1:06:05] so this is not speaking of the flesh
[1:06:08] this is speaking of the soul when you
[1:06:11] get a sharp cutting word a gold stuck to
[1:06:14] you it makes you feel comforted not in
[1:06:17] your flesh not in your mind but in your
[1:06:19] soul because you know God really does
[1:06:22] care about me he cares about me enough
[1:06:25] to cut me and hurt me and pierce me
[1:06:30] because I know he loves me Churchill
[1:06:36] never feels good to it never feels good
[1:06:38] to fail in front of people all the
[1:06:42] church knows I made this mistake oh and
[1:06:44] see if we're not careful we'll let that
[1:06:46] we'll let that be just a natural cut and
[1:06:49] it'll be guilt and shame that's why a
[1:06:51] lot of people stopped coming to church
[1:06:53] they just get ashamed I know one person
[1:06:55] that you particularly to come to our
[1:06:57] church once they stop coming for church
[1:06:58] for a while they're like well I can
[1:06:59] never go back because one of the people
[1:07:01] gonna think about me when I get back and
[1:07:03] I told them on the email I said the
[1:07:04] people are gonna rejoice when you come
[1:07:06] back that's what they're gonna think
[1:07:08] praise God they're gonna think you got
[1:07:10] touched by the Holy Spirit and God's
[1:07:13] giving you're available but they still
[1:07:15] don't come back because Satan is so
[1:07:18] pierce them in their minds instead of
[1:07:21] excited instead of accepting the
[1:07:23] piercing of the soul from the word they
[1:07:25] accept Satan's piercing and Saint makes
[1:07:28] him feel bad like it's your father
[1:07:29] they'll never love you in fact that's
[1:07:32] why I brother I don't think brother
[1:07:33] Austin would mind me Sharon that's why
[1:07:34] Alston actually we left the church he's
[1:07:36] he said he felt bad Satan was telling
[1:07:38] him that he was too much of a burden on
[1:07:40] us and it was it was his fault that
[1:07:42] people were leaving the church and and I
[1:07:45] said no and he started crying
[1:07:47] see that whole time he was letting Satan
[1:07:50] poke him instead of receiving what God
[1:07:52] was trying to tell him that's true
[1:07:54] that's what he told me he's crying he
[1:07:56] said I thought that's why and I told him
[1:07:58] I said the people that left the church
[1:07:59] disagree with me on doctrine or they
[1:08:01] just got tired of you know you know
[1:08:03] whatever the hardships were but it's
[1:08:05] nothing you did but Satan had so
[1:08:08] convinced him now Church I know I think
[1:08:10] I know why because when you stop coming
[1:08:12] to church you stop hearing the voice of
[1:08:13] God when you stop praying at home when
[1:08:16] you stop reading your Bible at home when
[1:08:18] you stop fellowshiping with Saints Satan
[1:08:20] gets you all isolated he gets you away
[1:08:22] from everybody and he just gets you in
[1:08:24] that corner and just whispers oh you're
[1:08:26] the reason everybody's having a hard
[1:08:27] it's your fault and he gets you too you
[1:08:31] know
[1:08:32] isolated in the room he isolates you and
[1:08:35] he lies to you you turn your back when
[1:08:38] you don't come to church you abandon the
[1:08:39] church you're all you're all over here
[1:08:42] by yourself it's so selfish to not come
[1:08:45] to church it's one of the most selfish
[1:08:47] things you can do and not come to church
[1:08:48] because you abandon the believers the
[1:08:51] believers need to be strengthened by you
[1:08:52] you need to encourage the Bible says
[1:08:55] encourage and a five people here help
[1:08:57] people here when you don't come to
[1:08:59] church you know edify anybody except
[1:09:01] Satan is that right and that's what
[1:09:06] caused our brother to stop coming for a
[1:09:09] year and a half and then he came back
[1:09:11] for one service and he he said I haven't
[1:09:13] felt like this way I pray with him he
[1:09:15] repented now he was leaving off the
[1:09:16] Arizona and he said I haven't felt like
[1:09:18] this since I left he said I've had one
[1:09:20] day of joy since I left the church and
[1:09:22] that really made me feel sad but it also
[1:09:24] made me feel grateful think about how
[1:09:26] happy I've been this whole time and then
[1:09:29] we're coming it just just by being the
[1:09:31] house of God you're happy you're joyful
[1:09:33] you got a positive outlook on life you
[1:09:36] see that there's hope maybe not for
[1:09:39] Masse's but there's hope for the elect
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:41] there's hope for the pre nests and the
[1:09:44] ones who really love God there's hope
[1:09:46] for anyone that will serve Jesus Christ
[1:09:48] anyone that fears God there's hope for
[1:09:50] them praise God how did I get there
[1:09:57] praise the Lord I'm not sure
[1:09:59] Oh Graham said what did David say though
[1:10:02] I walk through the valley shout death
[1:10:03] I'll fear no evil for not with me he
[1:10:05] said walk with him now he will walk with
[1:10:10] you in the valley anybody going through
[1:10:12] a valley right now but Graham said he
[1:10:14] will walk with you in the valley of the
[1:10:18] shadow of death not death but the shadow
[1:10:21] of it where it's like death is looming
[1:10:25] or destruction is looming he'll walk
[1:10:27] with you in the valley of the shadow of
[1:10:29] death it seems like death is just a just
[1:10:33] a adore adore adore adore lay it seems
[1:10:36] like death is so close but yet he said
[1:10:39] I'll walk with you this close I will
[1:10:42] always be with you in other words I'm a
[1:10:44] faithful Shepherd I won't leave you in
[1:10:47] hard times I'll encourage you in hard
[1:10:49] times I'll strengthen you in hard times
[1:10:51] I'll fulfill your request in hard times
[1:10:53] I will Menace you minister to you in
[1:10:55] hard times I'll never leave you alone
[1:10:57] because you're my sheep amen and I know
[1:11:00] all my sheep my name ha ha oh yeah
[1:11:03] praise God and he knows all the numbers
[1:11:06] the hairs on our sheep coats I'll say
[1:11:09] like that he knows each hair of wool I
[1:11:14] don't know if wolves got hair or not I
[1:11:16] know each of those pieces of hair will
[1:11:18] the wool from the hairs I know each one
[1:11:20] on my all my sheep thy rod and thy staff
[1:11:26] they comfort me but I have said the
[1:11:28] correction of the Lord they comfort me
[1:11:30] they let me know that God is with me cuz
[1:11:35] he corrects me from all my wrongs praise
[1:11:39] God
[1:11:40] how do you know God's with you brother
[1:11:42] Jesse how did by the RAM know God was
[1:11:45] with him because when he lied the Holy
[1:11:46] Spirit was there to correct his lie
[1:11:50] praise the Lord
[1:11:54] when he when he went with
[1:11:56] ministers in South Africa how do you
[1:11:58] know God was with him because God said
[1:11:59] you did it wrong and you're gonna suffer
[1:12:01] for it but I'm still with you
[1:12:03] amen how do you know God's with you
[1:12:07] because he corrects you when you're
[1:12:09] wrong
[1:12:09] he keeps prodding you you need to do
[1:12:12] this now of course he don't do it like
[1:12:15] that
[1:12:15] that's just me but well I know he didn't
[1:12:20] Solomon like that because the Bible said
[1:12:22] God was angry with song if you imagine
[1:12:23] God he was angry I told you not to take
[1:12:31] those wives I told you to stay true to
[1:12:33] me I told you not to build idols and
[1:12:35] altars
[1:12:36] God was anger Osama I don't want God to
[1:12:38] be angry with me Church I just want a
[1:12:41] little pride can you say Amen I know
[1:12:45] what pride after pride why don't you do
[1:12:47] this why don't you do I just want a
[1:12:49] little pride yes Lord yes yes Lord yes
[1:12:51] yes yes sir yes sir forgive me Lord I
[1:12:53] don't want to walk in the or
[1:12:55] disobedience I want to walk in obedience
[1:12:56] to the Lord I just give me a little give
[1:12:59] me a little pride how do you know he
[1:13:04] loves you because he corrects you from
[1:13:05] all your wrongs brother Graham said but
[1:13:08] Ram said maybe he's trying to correct
[1:13:10] you tonight maybe he's trying to correct
[1:13:13] us tonight why don't you let the rod and
[1:13:17] staff come for you the rod is the hard
[1:13:20] preaching gospel but it's a comfort to
[1:13:24] let me know that God speaks to me when
[1:13:27] that type of Gospels being preached to
[1:13:29] correct me he loved me he wants me to
[1:13:32] come walk with him now and then I'll he
[1:13:35] will walk with me in that hour see Bill
[1:13:39] Graham says that Jesus prods us Jesus
[1:13:41] corrects us so that wool with him so
[1:13:44] then he can walk with us so what does it
[1:13:48] show as long as we're serving God we're
[1:13:50] walking with Christ but when when we get
[1:13:52] a little bit unruly disobedient he tries
[1:13:54] the Pradas they come back over here come
[1:13:58] back over here and finally after enough
[1:14:00] prods it's okay and now we can walk back
[1:14:05] with him again and the church said
[1:14:08] prod me Lord correct me then I'll walk
[1:14:11] back with you so that you'll walk with
[1:14:13] me amen
[1:14:15] praise God just want to walk with them I
[1:14:19] just want to walk with the Lord Jesus
[1:14:21] brother Graham said the staff the rod
[1:14:24] and thy staff program said the staff is
[1:14:26] the word of this hour he says he said
[1:14:32] what did he do he said by the Shepherd's
[1:14:34] staff not a textbook not a theologians
[1:14:36] idea but a shepherd staff not a
[1:14:39] denominational prayer book be careful
[1:14:41] what prayer books you get be careful
[1:14:45] what books you read is that right
[1:14:49] look especially look if it came from
[1:14:51] someone who goes to not denomination
[1:14:52] because it's going to kill you it's
[1:14:55] poison food that right
[1:14:59] Shepherd's ride rod guiding his sheep
[1:15:02] making the way clear as they went
[1:15:03] towards the promised land what a
[1:15:06] beautiful thing it is today of his today
[1:15:07] shepherd's staff guiding his sheep to
[1:15:10] the promised land by passing theology
[1:15:12] and everything else for this world and
[1:15:14] denominations opening up the way
[1:15:16] improving his word to be the truth the
[1:15:19] Shepherd's staff going ahead so what's
[1:15:22] the Shepherd staff the revealed word of
[1:15:23] this hour amen
[1:15:28] he said did you notice the same
[1:15:30] shepherd's staff that was guiding the
[1:15:32] Sheep you believe that he certainly did
[1:15:34] God the Sheep he delivered them out of
[1:15:36] Egypt with the staff in Moses his hand
[1:15:38] we could say much more about it so each
[1:15:42] shepherd each prophet deliverer had a
[1:15:44] staff had a rod that delivered the
[1:15:46] people and so it is today God has a rod
[1:15:50] that delivers his people that's his word
[1:15:53] I don't know if you ever heard this this
[1:15:55] was kind of shocking to me in 1961
[1:15:58] before brother Han preached the
[1:15:59] ever-present water from the rock he said
[1:16:02] be with us today
[1:16:03] and give us words of wisdom as Solomon
[1:16:07] once said in the cleese the asses he
[1:16:09] actually quotes the scripture that we
[1:16:11] would be wise Miller's that we'd be the
[1:16:15] Shepherd's of this assembly he says so
[1:16:19] now
[1:16:20] that mine let's read that verse again
[1:16:21] increases 12:11 brother branham said the
[1:16:27] words of the wise he said Lord let my
[1:16:29] words be wise to build this assembly as
[1:16:34] shepherds of the assembly please ask
[1:16:36] these twelve eleven the words of the
[1:16:38] wise are as goads and his nails fastened
[1:16:40] by the Masters of the assembly which are
[1:16:43] given from one Shepherd so now Bertram's
[1:16:45] Frank said Lord give me these words that
[1:16:48] I might he says the preachers are like
[1:16:51] the Masters of the Assemblies the
[1:16:53] Shepherd gives them the goes and their
[1:16:55] to fasten that right they're supposed to
[1:16:57] to prod aunt and preach to the people
[1:17:00] the words of God that it fastens in
[1:17:03] their mind amen that's why I hope church
[1:17:07] like I said I've said it many times
[1:17:08] before that's why I hope when you leave
[1:17:09] their service something was fastened to
[1:17:11] your mind but you can't forget it my God
[1:17:15] spoke to me last night God spoke to me
[1:17:17] yesterday morning God wrote that in
[1:17:19] other words God wrote something upon the
[1:17:21] fleshly tables of my heart God was
[1:17:24] prodding me God was trying to push me
[1:17:26] along no that's the wrong way go this
[1:17:28] way oh my
[1:17:32] remember wisdom always builds the wisdom
[1:17:35] of God sometimes has to cut you right
[1:17:37] but when it cuts you it's actually
[1:17:39] building you up like Reno's muscles
[1:17:42] right when you when you lift heavy
[1:17:43] weights it breaks the muscle but then
[1:17:45] because it breaks it rips it actually
[1:17:47] builds it up stronger we know that and
[1:17:49] that's what the Word of God does it cut
[1:17:50] you and cut you but then the Holy Spirit
[1:17:52] comes and builds it up and makes it
[1:17:54] stronger for God amen wisdom hath build
[1:17:58] in her house the Bible says every woman
[1:18:02] every wise woman build with her house
[1:18:05] proverb says again through wisdom is a
[1:18:08] house builded by understanding is it is
[1:18:12] established so we see wisdom
[1:18:18] build the house of God wisdom will build
[1:18:20] your house wisdom will build your
[1:18:22] testimony we've got to let wisdom do it
[1:18:25] we've got to obey the wisdom we can't
[1:18:27] kick against the pricks we've got to
[1:18:28] obey with the Holy Spirit saying that's
[1:18:32] right verse 12 let's go to these asses
[1:18:33] twelve twelve I told you there was a lot
[1:18:36] in that verse there's a lot in there
[1:18:38] there's a lot more to like I could hide
[1:18:41] all those quotes from white had to be
[1:18:42] Shepherds mother and goes through all
[1:18:43] the shepherds
[1:18:44] all the prophets were shepherds you
[1:18:46] could tie all that into there God was
[1:18:48] leading them with Shepherds that had
[1:18:50] goats and those words that they preached
[1:18:52] would always prod the people long prod
[1:18:57] them move them correct them to stay with
[1:18:59] the Word of God please ask these twelve
[1:19:04] twelve was trying to finish this here I
[1:19:05] already preached 45 minutes I told
[1:19:07] myself I'd try to preach forty-five so a
[1:19:09] little bit longer and further by these
[1:19:13] my son be admonished of making many
[1:19:15] books there is no end and much study is
[1:19:19] a weariness of the flesh
[1:19:24] now the word admonish means warned so
[1:19:28] the Bible says be warned so some of his
[1:19:32] last words he said be warned making
[1:19:34] books of making many books there is no
[1:19:36] end so see our goal in life shouldn't
[1:19:40] just meet up to make books in and try to
[1:19:42] try to increase knowledge right it's not
[1:19:46] about the number of books it's about the
[1:19:47] quality of books praise God because I
[1:19:51] think there's one book outside of this
[1:19:53] book there's one book that's meant the
[1:19:55] world to me and that's the church age
[1:19:57] book I've read a lot of books but that
[1:19:59] one has been the most inspiring and
[1:20:02] because of that book I understand this
[1:20:05] book a lot better and I get and I apply
[1:20:09] what I've learned as the points of this
[1:20:11] book I'll apply that to my life and I've
[1:20:13] been blessed because of it in my family
[1:20:16] in the church in my personal life in my
[1:20:19] finances everything I've read in there
[1:20:21] my spiritual life it's all pointed this
[1:20:23] book that's been one book that's been
[1:20:24] great for me it's been war it's worn me
[1:20:29] Church you'll never feel like you've
[1:20:32] read enough books so it's not about what
[1:20:34] I need to read more different books you
[1:20:36] need to choose the right books in which
[1:20:38] to read because reading is I shared on
[1:20:41] Wednesday reading and writing is your
[1:20:43] meditation time David said I'm going to
[1:20:47] meditate upon your word in the bed how
[1:20:49] many read in bed I always try to write
[1:20:52] right before bed I try to write out a
[1:20:53] little bit about my goals for the next
[1:20:55] day and I've realized that's meditation
[1:20:57] time that's time I get to focus that's
[1:21:00] time I get to cast on anything that
[1:21:02] results itself against God I get to
[1:21:04] forget about that and I get to get my
[1:21:05] mind on the Word of God so see it's not
[1:21:10] about like I need to read more different
[1:21:12] books it's not so much about all the
[1:21:13] number of books it's about reading the
[1:21:15] most important books that's exactly
[1:21:19] right
[1:21:21] because if you try do that it'll be
[1:21:23] weary weariness to your flesh I've had a
[1:21:25] good friend over the years and this
[1:21:27] friend is all of it is easy he's been
[1:21:29] all about the number of resources and
[1:21:32] the number of books he wants to read and
[1:21:34] I found by watching different people's
[1:21:36] lives that are like that they think by
[1:21:38] the number of resources they accumulate
[1:21:40] they're going to be wiser but I've
[1:21:41] actually seen the opposite the more
[1:21:44] different number of resources they read
[1:21:46] because as you read more there's less
[1:21:48] people that actually believe the message
[1:21:49] a lot of those authors don't believe in
[1:21:52] the baptism of the holy ghost so they'll
[1:21:54] give you license to do things that the
[1:21:55] Bible says you shouldn't do and I've
[1:21:58] seen the people that are chasing numbers
[1:21:59] and and and try to increase their number
[1:22:02] of resources are drawn away from the
[1:22:05] truth of the word of God so be careful
[1:22:08] which authors you read and be careful
[1:22:11] how many books you are reading by
[1:22:13] authors that don't believe the message
[1:22:15] of the hour don't get me wrong every now
[1:22:18] and then you can do a good book where
[1:22:19] where you know maybe the authors
[1:22:21] Pentecostal or even Baptist or something
[1:22:23] I've read numerous Baptist books but
[1:22:25] what I never spend a lot of time in them
[1:22:27] I just glean out as I read quickly
[1:22:28] through it I glean out what's true is
[1:22:30] that oh my brother Branham preached this
[1:22:32] or I never saw that let me see what
[1:22:34] brother Branham said about it and I find
[1:22:36] it gives me greater revelation in the
[1:22:38] message but I don't spend more time on
[1:22:41] books outside the message I
[1:22:43] more time up books in the message praise
[1:22:46] God like right now we're at FF Bosworth
[1:22:49] will he follow brother branham for a
[1:22:50] while I read the Perry green book the
[1:22:53] church age book you know we got to stay
[1:22:55] with our minds upon those authors who've
[1:22:58] written the Word of God that had a
[1:22:59] really word based experience praise God
[1:23:01] that knew Jesus Christ was the same
[1:23:04] yesterday today and forever amen
[1:23:06] they knew him in the power of the
[1:23:08] Resurrection amen
[1:23:13] but remember as Paul told Timothy you
[1:23:15] should preachers should give themselves
[1:23:17] to study to prayer to meditation to
[1:23:20] reading the Bible says that I'm supposed
[1:23:22] to give myself constantly to reading but
[1:23:24] reading the right things it is only when
[1:23:29] you're and some of you know this too if
[1:23:31] you've been to college you read all
[1:23:32] those books and you don't feel any
[1:23:34] smarter I have to read in the Hall of
[1:23:36] the assigned reading you don't feel any
[1:23:37] bit smarter than when you started
[1:23:39] because it's weariness that's the same
[1:23:42] thing there's really no power in it I'll
[1:23:45] tell you if you read the Bible long
[1:23:46] enough pretty soon the Holy Spirit is
[1:23:48] going to come strike you it's gonna
[1:23:50] inspire something that's you read
[1:23:51] because this is a Living Word this is a
[1:23:54] sharp word amen the Holy Spirit comes
[1:23:58] too quick in this world amen but reading
[1:24:01] my educational books I'm like did
[1:24:05] somebody give me some inspiration I've
[1:24:08] read all this before I already know this
[1:24:09] this isn't even interesting much
[1:24:13] studying of that is weariness to the
[1:24:15] flesh but studying of this is life amen
[1:24:20] studying this is life because the Holy
[1:24:22] Spirit inspires this to our hearts so
[1:24:26] that that scripture needs to be balanced
[1:24:27] he's not saying don't read your Bible
[1:24:29] brother Jason that's not what he's
[1:24:30] saying or sister Karen slow down your
[1:24:32] reading of the Bible Lydia stop reading
[1:24:34] the Bible your your flesh is getting
[1:24:35] tired no your flesh getting tired
[1:24:37] because you need to go to bed or maybe
[1:24:40] you didn't sleep enough last night but
[1:24:42] when you read you should read eternal
[1:24:45] inspired words so see all these words
[1:24:49] got to be balanced out because Paul says
[1:24:52] by the Holy Spirit give yourself to
[1:24:53] reading let's just read that real quick
[1:24:55] it's 1st Timothy 3
[1:24:56] I believe or second Timothy three let me
[1:24:58] check yeah I think it's uh
[1:25:08] first Timothy yeah
[1:25:16] first Timothy four yeah sorry okay look
[1:25:22] at verse thirteen until I come give
[1:25:24] attendance to reading to exhortation to
[1:25:26] doctrine neglect not the gift that's in
[1:25:28] thee so see Paul says when you read the
[1:25:30] Word of God it actually increases your
[1:25:32] gift how many know you got to get from
[1:25:34] God if you've got a gift of God into
[1:25:36] anything you need to read the Word of
[1:25:38] God and let that word strengthen and
[1:25:41] build up your gift and the church said
[1:25:45] everybody here should have a spiritual
[1:25:47] gift if you're a believer no ramesses
[1:25:50] every believer has a spiritual gift so
[1:25:52] we need to give ourselves if we don't
[1:25:54] read the Word of God we neglect the
[1:25:56] gifts in our life I know this is for
[1:25:59] preachers but it has to apply to
[1:26:01] everybody else verse fifteen meditate
[1:26:02] upon these things give thyself wholly to
[1:26:05] them now notice he doesn't echo
[1:26:07] Solomon's words and we'll help you if
[1:26:09] you give yourself to too much reading
[1:26:11] brother bang or brother Jesse if you
[1:26:13] give herself to us reading it'll be
[1:26:14] weirdness to your flesh she doesn't say
[1:26:15] that though Solomon is talking about
[1:26:18] something else he's not talking about
[1:26:19] the Word of God he's talking about
[1:26:22] worldly wisdom or like finance books
[1:26:28] like we all know at some point we all
[1:26:29] like to read well how can I do it better
[1:26:30] than finance you start reading some of
[1:26:33] those you get too many you know too many
[1:26:35] ideas
[1:26:36] remember this books got enough wisdom
[1:26:38] about finances right here or parenting
[1:26:41] you know pretty soon you get all these
[1:26:42] books in all my or marriage all these
[1:26:45] books well let's come back to this book
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:48] I appreciate that glean out of there
[1:26:51] would always come back to this one right
[1:26:53] here he said holy give herself wholly to
[1:26:56] reading and I think that I property may
[1:27:00] appear to all take heed unto thyself and
[1:27:02] the doctrine continuing them for doing
[1:27:04] this thou shalt both save thyself and
[1:27:06] then then hear me I want to be saved and
[1:27:08] I know you want to be saved
[1:27:10] and we're going to be saved by preaching
[1:27:12] God's true doctrine God's true word and
[1:27:15] thank God for the goads
[1:27:17] that prick us that are fastened in our
[1:27:19] mind so remember the wisdom of God
[1:27:22] praise God well I got two amens on that
[1:27:26] hallelujah yeah I know it's not it's not
[1:27:30] easy to Amen when you're getting pricked
[1:27:34] when you're getting goads
[1:27:36] jammed in your back that's not easy but
[1:27:38] that's God's Way to lead his children
[1:27:40] along when we don't obey that's God's
[1:27:43] Way wise words are like goads
[1:27:47] but member to your soul it's a comfort
[1:27:50] well thank God
[1:27:50] it shows God's with me still he's not
[1:27:53] gonna let me be a Judas and just go out
[1:27:54] there and sell him out and all these
[1:27:56] things he's gonna bring me back to the
[1:27:58] fold praise God amen
[1:28:01] all right let me try to find a place to
[1:28:03] close here verse 13 please a sees 12 13
[1:28:10] now Wednesday Lord willing will preach
[1:28:12] on that first part of Christ the mystery
[1:28:14] of God revealed I've just been feeling
[1:28:16] led to go there someone too finished
[1:28:18] numerology I'm still at number 7 in
[1:28:19] numerology I'm still at chapter 7 and
[1:28:21] the book of Revelation I got all these
[1:28:23] series I'm still in chapter 4 in
[1:28:25] Ephesians I got all these series but I'm
[1:28:27] just trusting God to help me to finish
[1:28:29] him as the Lord would lead me praise God
[1:28:32] I just love the Word of God I there's so
[1:28:34] many topics I want to preach on it's
[1:28:35] just hard to decide any times so I got
[1:28:37] to pray and get the prodding from the
[1:28:39] Holy Spirit twelve thirteen let's finish
[1:28:42] this here so let us hear the conclusion
[1:28:44] of the whole matter what is wisdoms
[1:28:49] conclusion fear God and keep his
[1:28:54] commands for this is the whole duty of
[1:28:58] man duty means totality in the Hebrew
[1:29:02] this is the totality of your purpose on
[1:29:06] earth is to keep God's command it's very
[1:29:09] simple to understand what God is ones
[1:29:13] from us God wants obedience from us he
[1:29:17] wants us to manifest his life on this
[1:29:20] earth and that only happens through
[1:29:22] obedience to the Word of God
[1:29:24] so the conclusion from an old back slit
[1:29:27] in the disobedient king who lusted after
[1:29:29] women and I died it was an eye doctor
[1:29:31] and he's now starting to come back right
[1:29:34] before he dies his conclusion is fear
[1:29:36] God keep his commands so what do you
[1:29:40] think he's saying I wish I would have
[1:29:41] kept his commands when I had when I was
[1:29:43] younger
[1:29:44] and I had all that strength I wish I
[1:29:46] would have kept his commands look at
[1:29:50] verse 14 for God shall bring every work
[1:29:53] into judgment with every secret thing
[1:29:55] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[1:29:59] let me read you these last few things
[1:30:01] brother Bram said about fearing God
[1:30:09] brother man said even in our polluted
[1:30:11] condition today how many know your flesh
[1:30:13] is polluted how many know you've got
[1:30:17] serpent seed running through your
[1:30:18] natural blood then the church said
[1:30:20] remember all the bloodlines came
[1:30:23] together and Noah's day how remember
[1:30:24] that that's why you hate your flesh so
[1:30:27] much how can I act like a devil it's not
[1:30:29] you it's the flesh you've got seven seed
[1:30:32] running through these maze
[1:30:33] how come I'm so happy some days for
[1:30:35] Jesus in other days I don't even feel
[1:30:36] like doing it like last night I had such
[1:30:38] a good day of study I woke up in my
[1:30:40] flesh didn't wanna do nothing I'm like
[1:30:41] what's wrong with me why do I feel like
[1:30:43] a backslidden serpent seed or something
[1:30:46] like that tried to get my closet and
[1:30:47] praying pretty soon after prayer I come
[1:30:49] out of it I read okay it's just this
[1:30:51] flesh it's just this serpent nature
[1:30:53] thank god I've got a big nature on the
[1:30:55] inside amen
[1:30:56] thank God because the dumb nature cleans
[1:30:59] out from the inside out as we saying
[1:31:02] when I feel like what's wrong what's
[1:31:04] wrong with me why am i so lazy why do I
[1:31:06] feel so back stir them today I just need
[1:31:08] that dove nature to flow out and clean
[1:31:10] from the inside out so I realize what I
[1:31:13] really am the nature of God praise God
[1:31:19] even in our polluted condition today man
[1:31:23] was made to serve God that's his full
[1:31:26] duty on the earth here the great wisest
[1:31:30] man summoned all the rest of them
[1:31:31] speaking in classes he said let's hear
[1:31:33] the conclusion of the whole matter fear
[1:31:35] God and keep his commands this is the
[1:31:37] full duty of
[1:31:38] and he said that's the full duty of man
[1:31:42] he says an animal there's nothing in an
[1:31:46] animal to give him a soul an animal
[1:31:48] doesn't have a soul but man has a soul
[1:31:50] and therefore that soul is a part of God
[1:31:54] oh and the church said your soul is a
[1:31:58] part of God God's a spirit your soul is
[1:32:02] a spirit be that soul came from God amen
[1:32:06] the Bible says your soul must be
[1:32:08] quickened it must be made alive praise
[1:32:10] the Lord by the Holy Spirit and even in
[1:32:15] it's fallen state yet it's the most
[1:32:17] greatest species of all the species on
[1:32:19] the earth is the man and then get him in
[1:32:23] connection with his maker
[1:32:24] he becomes a super man when you get in
[1:32:31] connection with the holy spirit you
[1:32:32] become a super man or woman hallelujah
[1:32:37] do you feel like a super woman tonight
[1:32:40] you feel like a super man tonight when

[1:32:50] tonight I hope you need to praise God he
[1:32:55] says he becomes the Super Man almost
[1:32:57] because he's a son of God he becomes
[1:33:00] acquainted with this maker with the
[1:33:01] creator of all things and then when that
[1:33:04] man they're acquainted with his maker
[1:33:05] becomes a part of his maker
[1:33:07] he becomes back into fellowship with his
[1:33:09] maker every divine word becomes a living
[1:33:12] reality to him and he believes it that's
[1:33:16] how you know you're a super woman
[1:33:18] tonight or Superman how do I know I'm a
[1:33:21] super woman because every word brother
[1:33:24] Jesse's preaching from the Bible it's a
[1:33:25] living reality to me it's not a dead
[1:33:29] letter it's not a religion it's not
[1:33:31] begging you to be like a religious
[1:33:32] Catholic or routine Catholic or
[1:33:34] something like that it's pretty it's
[1:33:36] prodding you on to believe the word and
[1:33:38] know that everything that God says is
[1:33:40] true amen
[1:33:41] it's a reality it's not a game it's not
[1:33:46] a play we're not pretending Christian
[1:33:48] and the enemy tonight
[1:33:49] it's a reality
[1:33:51] and the proof will be tomorrow when when
[1:33:53] the troubles come if you clean to the
[1:33:55] word or not it'll show if it's a reality
[1:33:58] or not amen
[1:33:59] Oh hallelujah so tomorrow when that
[1:34:05] little seven-year-old in my class gets
[1:34:08] the demon spirit arm and tries to make
[1:34:10] fun of me and rebuke me in front of
[1:34:11] everybody
[1:34:12] I'll have the grace of God to answer
[1:34:14] that person usually it's a boy usually
[1:34:17] have a chance to answer that boy back
[1:34:18] really sweetly and say no I'm sorry
[1:34:19] you're disrespecting me but I'll be
[1:34:23] happy to correct you instead of getting
[1:34:26] mad and angry and making that child feel
[1:34:28] bad which they you know they try to
[1:34:29] embarrass me and all kinds of things
[1:34:31] like you know how kids are these days
[1:34:33] they try to speak evil against adults
[1:34:35] and they think they know everything see
[1:34:38] tomorrow when that spirit rises up if I
[1:34:40] really received this word and I know the
[1:34:42] Holy Spirit will remind me I said this
[1:34:44] tomorrow because that's how he is that's
[1:34:47] she's he's showing that he loves me when
[1:34:49] he corrects me he's showing me that he's
[1:34:51] still with me and he loves me then the
[1:34:54] power of the sharp go this sharp word is
[1:34:56] coming
[1:34:56] it'll correct me tomorrow to remind me
[1:34:59] it'll prick me tomorrow that's right
[1:35:00] I've got to use humility I don't have
[1:35:03] overcome evil with evil I overcome evil
[1:35:06] with good and I will manifest the
[1:35:09] reality of Christ's presence in my life
[1:35:11] I'll manifest it to someone that may not
[1:35:13] deserve it
[1:35:14] but will manifest it by the power of His
[1:35:16] grace amen so you're a superwoman if the
[1:35:22] word preach tonight is a reality to
[1:35:24] rather reality to you amen
[1:35:31] last one let's say into our feet here in
[1:35:33] this last quote brother BAM says and
[1:35:35] this is a two weeks before he passes
[1:35:36] away
[1:35:37] November 28 1965 maybe three he
[1:35:45] addressed his sister Palmer in
[1:35:47] Shreveport Louisiana he says all my
[1:35:50] heart shakes every time I think of it
[1:35:52] brother Palmer had just climbed the
[1:35:54] steps till a few minutes until I got the
[1:35:56] message that he was gone I just couldn't
[1:35:59] believe it Billy called and somebody got
[1:36:00] ahold and they note it we were such
[1:36:02] loving friends and to know that he's
[1:36:04] gone now it was really shaking he says
[1:36:07] but we all got to go regardless of who
[1:36:09] we are we must go one by one but there's
[1:36:12] only one thing brother BAM says there's
[1:36:14] only one thing let us hear the
[1:36:17] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[1:36:19] and keep his commands for this is the
[1:36:21] full duty of man brother Branham says
[1:36:25] now cowards come to the cup you know
[1:36:27] here pay that low song I love him I love
[1:36:32] him because he first loved me so when at
[1:36:36] the end of his life brother BAM hears
[1:36:37] about his friends dying and what does it
[1:36:39] point him to what is the holy spirit
[1:36:40] direct him to Ecclesiastes chapter 12 he
[1:36:45] knows he's going to go to a funeral for
[1:36:47] brother Palmer's soon if he did I
[1:36:49] imagine if he was in the area he would
[1:36:51] have and he's got to look in the casket
[1:36:54] and see a cold hard body and he says the
[1:36:59] whole duty of man he said thank God that
[1:37:02] brother Palmer feared God and kept his
[1:37:03] commandments this is the summary of our
[1:37:06] lives if you could just sum up brother
[1:37:09] Wang's life for brother Jesse brother
[1:37:10] Jose's life our lives here our whole
[1:37:12] life should be just be summed up did
[1:37:14] they fear God and keep his commands or
[1:37:17] not because that's our whole duty I
[1:37:19] remember the fear of God is to hate evil
[1:37:24] your brother Jesse hate cus he did he
[1:37:28] hate adultery did he hate jealousy and
[1:37:31] envy impression did he hate those things
[1:37:35] and I trust the Holy Spirit would say
[1:37:37] yes as a witness he did hate those
[1:37:40] things to depart from a leaf I'm gonna
[1:37:57] read a couple more scriptures here bear
[1:37:59] with me proverbs 19 16 let me just read
