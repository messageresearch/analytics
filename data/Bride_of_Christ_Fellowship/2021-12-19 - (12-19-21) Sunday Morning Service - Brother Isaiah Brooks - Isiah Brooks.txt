my home shall be [Music] sweet one more time [Music] and some days [Music] me [Music] me [Music] sweet as we stand thank you musicians thank you hallelujah i i guess you say i'm a junkie for the presence of the lord without him where would i be i can remember the time when i was so afraid to be saved i wanted to be a christian but was afraid to be a christian because i was afraid that i was going to be a failure but then i learned it's not me it's him and when i learned that it really set me free if the world only knew the grace of god i believe the whole world would be in line to be saved but because people don't understand calvary and what he did for us they think they have to do all of these things and really all they have to do is have faith in god and god will do the rest as we stand let us turn to revelations the fourth chapter once again we thank god for our brother jesse and his wife christian and the children and the family and i want to thank god for sister wendy i forgot to mention her yesterday amen but i appreciate her coming i hadn't spoke or seen her in such a while so it's a real blessing to have you and she's like a daughter and a sister at the same time amen i remember when wendy got first got saved she came to church and i was preaching i'm telling you fire and brimstone didn't even know she was in the audience she had come with brother simon and when she stood up i like oh she won't be back [Laughter] but i tell you what she came back and she never stopped i thank god for and she used to ask us so many questions i mean i mean just questions i'm like lord have mercy how she's getting that and where she's getting it but we understand amen that the the scriptures has to come by revelation that was that was our way out amen so we thank god for the people of god i've seen transformation i've seen people changing even at this point we're not where we desire to be but one thing for certain we know we've been traveling we understand that we've come from somewhere we're going somewhere amen and uh as we stand we i keep saying that revelation is the fourth chapter being a pastor of two churches no matter how how often i stand in this pulpit i'm always nervous because i realize god i've got to give an account for the things i say over this pulpit so it just really makes me nervous but it also makes me depend on him revelations the fourth chapter we'll begin reading at the seventh verse i'm sorry the fourth verse i'm sorry i get the wrong scripture revelations the fifth chapter forgive me excuse me i don't know when you cry i understand why your nose has to run but it happens revelation is the fifth chapter beginning at the fourth verse and i wept because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne revelations 10 1. just read the first two verses of that chapter and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in the in his right hand a little book opened and he set his foot upon the right on the sea excuse me his left foot on the earth one more scripture we'll go down to the 10th verse of that same chapter i'm sorry let's read the eighth verse and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is uh opened in the right in the hand of the angel withstand it upon the sea and upon the earth and then that last first of the tenth verse and i took the little book out of the hand out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before people in nations and tongues and kings father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and all that you have done for us everything that you're doing for us you've been such an amazing amazing god awesome god there are no words in the english language uh which and that can express my gratitude towards your lord the more i think of you the more humble i i become and the more awesome you are lord and i pray lord this morning that you would bless the saints of god today lord god that we will uh be able to see and understand this amazing grace that you've given unto us lord we love you and we thank you we ask that you would forgive us for anything we may have said or done lord we pray that you forgive our eyes and everything else that may have been out of order in some way or another lord forgive us and cleanse us from all our righteousness lord and let nothing said or done hinder this message we ask these things in jesus christ's name we we pray amen you may be seated the subject on this morning is the book is open i have a lot to say about god's grace so i'm just going to move uh by god's grace as fast as i possibly can but i want it to be in a way that you can you can see and understand where we're going amen as we talk about last night as we preach and and i i even called brother jess and said i am so sorry i kept the people so long but sometimes you know it's like when you're at a buffet or you had a dinner you know you forget time you're so enjoying yourself and and when i preach i'm not preaching to you i'm enjoying it myself and sometimes i forget amen that uh some people you know you know the time element may bother them so i i want to be mindful of you this morning but by the grace of god we we understand that before the fall everything was so perfect matter of fact god himself called it good yes and there's only one good and that's god and you know when god compliments himself when he says amen to himself it it has to be good and so we realized by god's grace everything was in harmony everything in his own dimension was there nothing had been interrupted so much so that heaven and earth amen was able to communicate god could come down in the cool of the evening and he could talk to adam and it was a wonderful situation but we know that because of the fall and understand it was adam whose sin but eve was beguiled and the beautiful thing about that is because even in the fall of adam in the fall of e god knew that he understood that this was also a work of his own uh plan of salvation amen and adam knew that in order for him to save his wife eve he had to go out and sin against god but god understood that adam understood it yes because adam said to eve when he introduced to himself to her he said you're born in my bone in flesh of my flesh and he also went on to say that when a man finds a woman he must cleave to her and leave his father and his mother and at that time there was no fathers and mothers so adam knew amen that eve would fall and then by her falling she would become a mother and there would come a father because understand when they were to create and when they were to speak uh into existence amen children those children would have been brothers and sisters and this is why we marry our brothers and sisters because over yonder we all are brothers and sisters so we must understand by god's grace it was such a harmony but when adam and eve fell it brought a breach it the breach was so great till actually the dimensions that god had set in order was disarrayed because remember the bible said that hell was made for satan and his angels hell was not made for the sons and daughters of god and remember there was a breach and in the story of the rich young ruler it was told that there was abraham bosom where lazarus went and then there was a rich man who was in a place of torment and yet instilled they could see the bible said there was a gulf there was a breach between that dimension and the righteous was in the bosom of abraham and the unrighteous was in a area of torment and they could see each other yes here was a rich young ruler looking up to abraham and said abraham could you have lazarus come and just dip his finger in some water and place it on my tongue it must have been a horrible situation and this man actually was called to preach he was in he had a gift of evangelism yes because remember jesus invited him a man to go come with him you know remember that he was young you know he comes along and and he's and he's and he's you know oh you know i've done everything this is why i say you ought to be careful how you approach god your protocol will determine uh the way god will answer you if you come by way of grace god will give you grace if you come by way of law he will give you the law and i think it's more rewarding to all of us when we approach god with the grace of god so the rich young ruler approach god says what must i do this is very important and then god went down the list jesus christ went down the list of all the things that is required of him to do and the rich young ruler says well lord i've done them all but god understood there was something still lodging in that man's heart that perhaps he didn't understand or didn't even know it was there but you see the word is sharp sharpened in a two-edged sword is able to divide right he's able to go into the heart and search it out to see the darkness there and that's what jesus did he said i tell you what go sell all that you have and follow me now god has never required of the rich young ruler to do anything other than what he's required us to do we must sell out everything and follow him but the rich young ruler he said you know lord i can't do that that's too much for me to bear and he walked away from god and the next scene you see this rich ruler amen with his bonds full and he's retiring from his great job and he's got all the riches that he desire now we wouldn't have known it was the same person had not have been for a prophet but nevertheless amen this rich young ruler said take ease my soul and rest [Laughter] and god looked at him and said oh you fool yes you understand me because this man also had a second chance god always give you a second chance god laid lazarus right before his door remember the bible said if you do good unto the least of these you've done it unto me and god gave the rich young ruler a second chance but what did he do he shoned it he despised lazarus right yes hallelujah and he wouldn't give to lazarus but the same man he despised was now in abraham's bosom that's right it was able it was lazarus time now yes the rich young ruler who was rich was paul the paul lazarus now was rich and isn't it funny that's the way they call it calm i think that's the way things return it comes back to you whatsoever man so he shall also reap amen and what was it here it was the rich rich young ruler lazarus wanted crumbs right lazarus was raising the dogs to the table yeah and this rich young said why didn't he say abraham wouldn't you give won't you give me a drink why did he say abraham why don't you give me some water but you know what he did he says no sin lazarus you know why he knew lazarus that's right and lazarus knew him hallelujah and abraham says no he can't do it there's a gulf between us now watch it he said but then the rich young ruler his gift shows up let me go let me go and tell my brothers about this place so they won't come here you see he wanted to do the evangelistical work then but it was too late it was too late hallelujah but you and i must understand all of these things are written here because the book is open a lot of times people look at these stories but they don't understand god is sending a message to his bride be careful hallelujah because great gain is not godliness but godliness with great it is a godly is great gain y'all know what i'm trying to say so you know what i'm saying it's all right to be rich it's all right but understand jesus christ must be the number one in your life yes sir let's move on so heaven and earth had brought a breach there was a breach we didn't understand it when jesus died and he went down into hell and he preached to the souls that was in prison he was binding something he was setting order remember the first adam disarrayed he said things in disorder the second adam it was the restoration and that's why that's why you know you you're finding joy i i i shall restore because god always liked to restore and we find out amen here was jesus christ dying he died for you he he was buried for you and in everything he he went to restore not just what the first adam messed up and lost but everything that was caused by that effect it was up to jesus christ to restore you got to understand so you could understand what i'm saying remember the first adam had the commission to multiply and create multiply uh and fill the whole earth with sons and daughters of god well the first adam never did that that's right he they never the the sons of god never filled the earth and you say what do you mean because it was the hibernation it was those that looked like the sons of god yes you understand me and what happened because of the law was misconstrued it was messed up because of polygamy and all those things those things came after the fall right right and because of polygamy you watch the devil because he knows what he's doing he was able to out multiply the sons of god and he's doing the same thing again but look what god is doing he's still by his word forming and bringing forth sons and daughters of god this is why the bible said they without they cannot be completed without us understand because what we have is what they need you understand me because the fullness of christ has come back to the bride of jesus christ and because of that the full restoration of the authority of god is now back in the bride that's right so what are you saying even now i mentioned it yesterday the scripture says it like this we are now setting in heavenly places in christ jesus now how can we be sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus and yet be on earth at the same time this is where you your faith must kick in and i was telling my church you must elevate your mind your way of thinking because we think so much like men to the oftentimes we find ourselves walking like me and talking like men and carrying on like men but when you're born again you're not just a man or a woman you have become sons and daughters of god and the mind of christ must operate your life hallelujah and what was his mind i have come in the volume of the book to do thy will oh god that's what we're here for we're not here for nothing else other than fulfilling the word of god for our day amen you understand me and you can't do that amen with the letter only you need power but let me go on by god's grace so what happened conquered death was conquered you know in a lot of times you know people think that you know god made a skeleton key and you can unlock all the doors of heaven there's only one key that unlocks the door of heaven and that key is jesus christ amen hallelujah yes sir i don't care what age you would have been born in the only key that would have unlocked the door would have been jesus christ y'all understand me so we know by god's grace amen that the resurrection has benefits and of course psalms 103 talks about it forget not your benefits don't forget him he healeth all your disease right he saved you he he he delivers you oh you can read it 103 1-5 he tells of the benefits and those are just some of them right right but there are great benefits of being in this message and here it is oftentimes people think that the message is reading books or listening to a tape sometimes people think and and and they forget the letter will kill you but the spirit gives you life you understand me even the things that brother branham has said must have a spiritual revelation and understanding of that's right you hear what i'm saying because many times you say what do you mean he like jesus christ when he was here many times spoke in parables he said things that made it look made him look like he didn't know what he was talking about but he understood that spiritual bride she's going to catch it and the reason why she can catch it because she has the spirit of jesus christ who is the message and god never confuses his own word hallelujah hallelujah so you got to understand by god's grace so when we see and and i'm going to back to the opening of the word so you can understand that when that word was open when the seals were open and and and and there were silos in heaven something took place and and and the prophet god said i have to be careful because even the angels had to be careful not to say anything because if they would have said something it would have given it away but understand you can't add nor take away from the bible everything that was said must come in line with the word is that right so you got to understand that this even the silence in itself has an interpretation and i'm not here to interpret but i'm going to tell you some things today so that you could understand when things are silent doesn't mean god is not working the greater things in life like the sun none of you hear the sun you don't hear the wind of the moon right it's silent but those great things can you imagine what it would be like if we could hear the noise of every star hallelujah but to us it's silent but those things are great those are the greater things and god is always working he's always doing something amen in that time of silence that people just don't see hallelujah except those who understand the revelation of their day hallelujah because i'll give you i'll give you an example you had simeon and anna in the temple praying before the lord and israel was silent yes there had not been a prophet in the land i think 400 years or so and nobody heard the voice of god hallelujah yes but in the midst of their silence god was preparing a prophet and a prophetess for the coming of the lord somebody help me here when nobody else knew god was still god and that god was still working there were two who heard the voice of god and told them in their day that they would not die until they see the messiah but to the church world they had not heard from god y'all understand when i'm going with this it's a silence it's a time of silence for the church world but for the bride she has an ear to hear things that the world cannot hear secrets that only gives the bride see that's the thing everybody think that when this rapture takes place you know the whole church is going to just go up let me tell you something only those who have a relationship those who can hear god those who can see god those who the word of god has been open to you know the time and the season you're living in that's why the word of god says we don't have to talk about the times and seasons you ought to know the devil won't come to you as a thief in the night because you know you can see where you're living but you see those who are in the message they're going on and on and on with all of these crazy ideas and things and cannot hear and they cannot see and they don't even know the time they're living in hallelujah it just stands like standing amen on the beach and the tidal wave is moving backwards and you're standing there observing it like ah not even knowing the very thing that you are is amazing that's amazing you it will come back to kill you hallelujah but those who know the function they know the way tidal waves move what do they do when they see that they run desperation strikes them and they know if i don't get out of the way of this judgment it's going to catch me and i will be consumed with everybody else this is what i'm talking about we understand that judgment is striking america right now not just america but the whole world and you're foolish if you don't get out of the way and the only hiding place is in jesus christ him alone you can run to the mountain and the mountains won't hide you you can run to the dens and the deans of the cave cannot hide you is that right there's no hiding place outside of jesus christ you know even in israel day 87 when titus came israel missed the messiah yes and they thought if we run into the temple and we run into the city we're going to be safe but they did not understand they did not catch the revelation of jesus christ why he was coming because not only was he the age of grace but he also brought judgment and he told them he said you know one of these old days you're going to wish to see the son of man and you'll see him not y'all understand me he told them it was going to happen he even told his disciples when you see the enemy encompa when you see the city encompass about about enemy he said don't take your stuff right and that's the problem we got too much stuff that means too much to us don't take your stuff leave it wherever it is people of god the most important thing right now is to make sure you've got the holy ghost and you're sealed hallelujah hallelujah because once you seal the seal cannot be broken dale the devil this is layer to see he wants you to be lazy he wants you to be you know uh nonchalant however they want to say it you know dollatory you know what i mean he wants you to be all of that but no no no the word of god i think according to zechariah said when the vision has been made plain when it's made being clear when it let him that read it right hallelujah he said that it ain't going to tear it you better run hallelujah it didn't say jog or walk it said run hallelujah take that means to run with haste time is shorter than what we think and this is what i'm gonna my subject i say that the book is over open but i wanted to say just a minute away is my thought think about it the rapture could be just a minute away yes sir what could you do in a minute's time but anyway so we find out amen that nobody was worthy to open the book or to loose the seals thereof the bible said they searched the a heaven and the earth and the under the earth and everywhere and there was nobody worthy then there was a voice said don't weep john there's one worthy amen i'm trying to tell you something here don't weep john one is worthy to open the to loose the seals and open open up this book john turned to see a lion right and we all love lions don't we the four living creatures the lion the ox the man the eagle y'all know how it goes but something changed because remember amen john who was the who was the prophet eagle he was an eagle but let's put it this way but when the eagle turned he saw a lamb yes something happened in the opening of the seals the four living creatures had been used during the church ages but now this is a new age which is called life hello you can call it the eighth day the eighth whatever you want to call it you know some people get all tied up with terminology but the most important thing you need to know is that the church ages was ending when this happened and god was bringing a bride out of it y'all understand me a time when he could perfect her because he indicted laodicea she was found guilty hallelujah you understand me and now she has a name that she lives but she's dead right but there's a bride y'all know what i'm the book is open and so you say what do you mean what do you mean because if there is a marriage and we see that a lamb is getting ready to be married where a lamb doesn't marry a goat it doesn't marry a cow a lamb marries a lamb y'all understand me so this dispensation changes amen from the eagle to the lamb and god is requiring us to be lambs you don't believe me why do you think he called it the lamb book of life amen the nature of jesus christ is a lamb hallelujah that lamb was able to go to calvary he was led to go to calvary y'all better hear what i'm saying and everything he had to go through the bible said he opened not his mouth why because the bible said he wouldn't do it y'all understand me this this air that this time that we're living in causes for your nature to change this is why peter said the divine nature of god amen is likened to a lamb it started off as a lamb it ends up like a lamb the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain in the garden of eden hallelujah and the lamb was slain on calvary hallelujah and now the lamb the book is open and now and then the lamb is being exposed who is this lamb jesus christ y'all understand me that's why you got to say lord give me that lamb's nature if you want to take me to the slaughter take me to the slaughter that's right lord if you want to shear me shear me if there be anything in my life that needs to be cut off cut it off take it off lord bring me to a place of nakedness that you might be seeing and not me hallelujah hallelujah it's open and it's open for you this is the bride's book y'all hear what i'm saying god has this book for you and me when the world think is outdated there is no greater book than the bible i don't care how great the authors are you know it's so amazing like uh the prophet god said they'll give honor to the man who could create a false leg and a false eye right but they don't give no honor to the man who created the real eye and the real that's right the real leg you know what i'm saying you know i could give some honor to the false eye if you can make it see hallelujah y'all understand what i'm saying but they can't even make it see right but they get more honor about this false stuff that god does let's move on by the grace of god you look at this thing you say well brother what are you trying to tell me oh my god if i could just that's why i weep sometimes i get so excited you know you're singing about heaven you're talking about stuff that i like i love that i love that i love that you know and so we look at this thing because it's such a drama everything is in shadows and types and and you know we we know that the uh uh revelation is a book of symbols and a lot of the things that are there is in symbol form you know i mean even even even uh let's put it this way even the book of life you know or the book of the lamb book of life a lot of times you know in your mind you think it's got a big book can you imagine how book bit big that book would be but see god don't need no no memory he remembers everything he's got every name god is so so powerful he knows the number of hairs on your head now i've had all of this all my life and i've never counted them but he knows something i don't know you know what i'm saying what i'm trying to say is that a lot of time and i thought about this i said oh i don't know how it's going to look because i know when i you know i remember when reading in matthew it says i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you should be also and in my father's house there are many mansions well you know i thought there was going to be housing everywhere i'm not saying there won't be houses but i'll tell you what brother branham saw when he was there over there in that other dimension he saw people mansions people running in the king in the kingdom holy running to him a number he even could not even number you understand me so you must must understand god speaks in parables and we see how the devil has he interprets the word in such a calm away and and you know we you can't get nothing out of it right you know i mean i mean you know how the devil does he he he he interpret god as an old grandfather that ain't him god don't age let the devil know that amen he doesn't age there is no time with him he's eternal now let me move on so you say well what do you mean when when this thing oh it's such a grand thing he kept it from the devil all those years god did now think about it let us not be like israel because israel had the ark of the covenant and god would show up on the ark of the covenant but you understand the ark of the covenant was just a meeting place that god had ordained for him to meet it wasn't that that was the only place god was everywhere by foreknowledge amen but israel got somewhere in such a system they thought that the only place that god could show up was where that ark was right what happened all those years when they lost the ark of the covenant they lied to the people they made the people believe that the ark of the covenant was behind the veil and god exposed them when he died and he rose from the again the bible said the veil was rent from top to the bottom and if there were any past buyers they could see that the ark was not there hallelujah and see when the word when the word inspired is not there that's what produces pharisees sadducees and all of those kind of sex because god is not there it becomes a man control thing y'all understand what i'm saying but when the ark is there when god is on the the mercy seat y'all understand me and your mercy is here that's where god is who else can give mercy and grace like the bride can yes hallelujah y'all understand me yes sir so anyhow amen we understood that that what happened is when this angel when christ himself this lamb came to take the book out of the right hand of him that uh sat on front of the throne he came and he took the book but he didn't keep it to himself because this was a restoration this was to bring mankind back to his position you understand because remember when he rose paradise emptied out that's right it changed and god placed mankind in his proper position which was the sixth dimension under the altar is that right so you got to understand and then because of the fall we had to have a we were in a lesser place but now we're in a higher place this is why the bible said we are now sitting in high in in in high places we are in a different dimension where in christ jesus this is what i'm trying to tell you and therefore if we're there which we are yes we're in the form of theophany however you want to put it but we're there and it's our duty to connect with that one y'all understand what i'm saying because when you hear from this message you have heard from your theophany well what do you mean if though that dimension where lazarus was emptied out and went up higher it also gave freedom to our theophanies oh my god because it was you've never heard of it before sure until this day that's right when the prophet of god could tell you that you have a theophany you have a word body right and understand amen that word body stands before god day and night in representation of you hallelujah he's the one oh my god this gives you the signals he's the one says don't do it he's the one saying don't go there he's the one that don't look at that you understand me that that's our communication what's the use of hearing for you from your theophany and there is no communication the word says hearing you've heard from your theophany there's a conversation there's something being said communication that's telling you you're there already oh you say oh brother i don't know about that well let me tell you like i said like let me say it like this what about elijah elijah's not dead right moses is not dead right they stood on mount transfiguration and that was before the crucifixion yes after the crucifixion it was no longer their theophanies who rose from the dead rose and they're glorified yes you say how can it be it is so you say oh brother what are you trying to say what i'm trying to say is the very god that created us was bringing us back let me get back to this one point i forgot because the first adam did not replenish the earth but the second adam replenished the earth now how did he do it the bible said he didn't have a wife right he could have got a white brother adam said he didn't yes why because he understood he was a quickening spirit and his wife must not be a natural woman but she must be a spiritual woman and so when god gives you the holy ghost he gives you the holy ghost because you are his wife and listen it won't be any more children there won't be any kind of reproduction like that anymore right but how does god replenish the earth because he takes all of his children and he places them in a reserved place until that time he comes back in revelation riding on a white horse he now comes with the host of heaven to replenish the earth it's the truth that's how god is replenishing when you get saved that's why heaven rejoice hallelujah because they know this is just the beginning of a new creation yeah hallelujah let me let me move on by the grace of god you love the lord yeah now brother berlin says it like this question and answers he said when jesus suffered in the b that body he suffered because a man and a woman are one person eve was taken out of adam in on uh under the church what happened god opened up the side of adam and took out there a help meet the bride right and god opened up the side of jesus at calvary and took out the bride now he's saying some things here that i need you to understand amen not because if you're not if he wasn't there you won't be there that's right brother right you know god has given us such a perfect a perfect salvation and if we just hold that perfect faith that was that would bring us to it we you know it'll make you carefree almost you'll be loving everybody yes you'll be so excited about who you are and what you are you would never think about all what's going to happen to me tomorrow because you don't care you understand me you know where you're going you know where you came from you don't care yeah you ever think about lazarus let me say about lazarus and i'm gonna go finish this quote but lazarus never worried i mean the one that that was you know i said lord how i don't understand because never never have i seen the righteous forsaken or seed begging brave but he was lazarus begging from the young uh see god can do what he wants to do lazarus had a mission he was born for that purpose y'all understand me sometimes god put things and people in your life and then you overlook them keep overlooking them you better ask god why that person is there they could be your very tormentor but you need to ask god why is that person there and how much i must i minister to them you understand me because that could be your very test that same person hallelujah if the rich man would have known that lazarus was his test his final test and he failed it yes sir man good hallelujah yes let's move on but the the point is is that god had lazarus begging now you must understand a lot of time we see a man or woman on the street we think not much of them but you don't understand that could be the seed of god you understand me you don't know why they're there how they got there but oftentimes god put them there just for you amen to see your response to that person yes sir yes when i was naked you didn't clothe me yes you get it yes these things are not just coincidence so when god speaks to you stop turn around whatever the case may be do it amen let me remember go on now because we must understand we must understand when when god does something he's a purpose behind it and everything is your test your test hallelujah remember the bride was not taken from the body until the body was dead he had already he had already died and they were going to break his legs you know why they couldn't break the legs because not one word could be broken amen yes yes right and the and your your your body your your skeleton is your framework you understand and the word of god is basically god's framework you see what i'm saying and and the and the prophet said there'll not be one bone broken so they don't draw they you know so they done drawed back getting ready to break his leg and the hammer to break a leg and a man went up with the spirit and pushed it through his heart as water and blood came forth he was already dead listen she was all ready no god redeem me no she was already redeemed in the body by the by his death y'all understand me so his death was your redemption now you're here to manifest you were in there oh my god the devil don't like it i tell you what i can just kick him a bit you know you got to understand by god's grace the devil is a liar oh i'm just being saved that's not true the bible said you were saved before the foundation of the world you're just coming into the knowledge of it yes and god didn't save you back there to lose you that's right when the devil said you're going to be lost you can't be right oh my god this is really good to me so there's no suffering listen you were already redeeming the body by itself so there's no more suffering tribulation period for the bride see she goes in but the gentile church that just believed on him and takes the denomination of creeds and so forth and and and still see what they did the problem was they still had a love for the things of the world that's what kept them away right all right now listen you say well what do you mean brother books let me show you in the old testament y'all know i love esther so i'm gonna go to esther for just a bit esther's you gotta understand out there esther and ruth there's so many truths hidden in those books and those books were named after these women and so you got to understand that when god did that he had a great purpose hidden in that a great purpose and so a lot of times when you think about esther and ruth you understand that the whole redemption plan god's whole redemption plan was locked up in those two books hallelujah right those books were books of grace those books were books of mercy you understand those books told about the bride of jesus christ and understand i love esther because she comes from nowhere she was nothing right she had no mother nor father and of course we we know malachi mordecai her uncle was the one who raised her right and that's what happened she didn't know her identity there was a place in her life she had no real identity and mordecai gave her some identity which he was a type of of the prophet of our day and he basically told her how to do it and whatever the case may be of course when you you're in a state of mind like that you you know you need some help hallelujah and you know in the book of esther you know god is not mentioned y'all know these things right but this is the part i want to speak on there came a time because what this what i said about the the seals being open and john taking the book and then he god gives the book to john until john eat it eat it all up that's you that's not just wheaton branham that's you yeah and you're supposed to eat this whole book because thou must prophesy again is that right we become messengers of the message right god brings us into that place that's the prophet god said he he praises us in the same kind of position we are messengers now of the message so when when you look and see if that be the case if brother branham had authority over over demons and all of these things god placed in him that that son of man that was in him remember the bride of jesus christ comes to that same position hallelujah yes even the prophet said it she comes under the son of man anointing the same as elijah becomes elisha right and her the bride elisha amen has a double portion of what elijah had right it wasn't a drop in anointings it wasn't a drop amen in miracles it wasn't a drop amen and none of those things matter of fact it was an increase and among the bride we must have an increase if we have an increase it will prove who you are amen hallelujah we see a drop in all these things you can't see miracles you can't see gifts or anything like that that ain't the way it's supposed to be it's supposed to be an increase though it'd be a small group of people it's supposed to be an increase you love the lord all right so anyway the the authority of the word was taken from from eve and and listen look at look at esther and i'm going to show you something here the king stopped seeing esther and if you know the story you know he didn't want to see it for a while it had been a while it was silenced and during the silence i can hear the message people say you better say it just like hell shall not prevail against it you understand me you must have it revealed whatever he said must become a revelation and that that revelation revealed comes out of your mouth that's what it means he doesn't mean letter by letter by letter like they said oh it's in the word you cannot go see the king without him something you but else i have a revelation i know what the law says but this king loves me and if i perish let me perish hallelujah it's silence but something happens because the bible said when those seven thunders uttered their voice there was a half hour of silence something took place you can't say something didn't take place it did but there was a forbidden to write it that's right but what happens is something happens a desperation comes on esther it's a man of life and death yes not only to her but to her people yes don't you understand they cannot be complete without us it's a manner of life and death it's a manner of resurrection it's a matter coming back to our proper place without us that cannot be completed we've got a burden on our hands and therefore we must go see the king you understand me we must get something from him that we don't have yet not that he's not giving his given she says if i perish can you imagine you're king you've got all these officers in there in the court you know when king is in his court in session they got all the businessmen you know whatever's going on in this part of the king that part of king that king all of a sudden the door opens and when the door opens the whole place becomes silent they're in awe because they know the law and they know if the king doesn't put forth his scepter esther is dead that's right but watch her something inspires her she fasted three days no water no bread that was a part of her death but she resurrected and when she resurrected she came up as queen she didn't go down with the same clothes these old clothes she had to to cry out to god with y'all understand what i'm saying she went and she put on the queen's garment she came in with the pride the garment of praise into his gate was thanksgiving into his courts with praise she she put on that garment oh my you know she was a pretty girl anyhow i can imagine esther coming in there humble humble quietly and everybody was like they couldn't say nothing you could hear a pin drop because now they're in expectation and anticipation what will the king do will the king break his own law she comes in and i i could just see it now this is just my imagination on this part but i can just see her as she lifts her head and she catches his eyes y'all understand me yes when people are in love and they catch each other i not one word is spoken but every word is understood amen yes maybe y'all haven't experienced that before but it works that way just that way it works all of a sudden the king amen in his own eyes he he showed her how much he loved her because what happened she became face to face you understand me face to face and jesus said one day we will see him what face to face and what happened the scepter was the book of authority there was this there was a was that was it was the word uh how could i say it was the authority of the king just like the little book and all of a sudden he hands the little book to her she takes the little book y'all hear me now this is the book open now the scepter becomes the book because that's the authority that's the title deed that's the very word of the king and he sets it out there and she holds it and then the king says to her you are now become jon heiress with me hallelujah ask what you will you could have the half of the kingdom amen yes you can have the half of the king kingdom it's yours it's yours you understand me he couldn't kill her he had already covered he made a covenant yes you understand me and then he asked her what would you have me what do you want me she says all i want to do is have a banquet see she knew she knew where that's died and that's how i represented the pentecostal realm the church the lay of the sea and age you understand me rich and increase with good and have need of nothing she's so proud with all her jewels and all her this and her pipe organs and all of these kind of stuff and when god called when the prophet was on the scene calling her to the wedding calling her to the some by the summers of the king because god the king wanted to show her off but no she was into her own revival running here and running there and this bishop going in that bishop going over there and then missing the call yes you understand me and god said put away i won't have nothing to do with her yes and at that time esther rose up you understand me this little bride rose up yes and now they're still having her their so-called revival god put her out you understand me he put her out they put him out he put her out right sure yes so you look at it you're looking at this thing this little group nobody this little esther nobody knew and listen didn't even know her identity look at you over in this little church i got one too nobody don't know you you're not some big thing but yet god is working here hallelujah god has chosen you and groups like this amen who's nothing don't have a big name we don't we don't have all this you know pomp and all that other we don't have it we're just simple ordinary people like esther but we've been summoned we we we we know we can go to the king and right now right now you and i must understand that time is coming and as we're right at hand you're going to have to fast and pray amen and your purpose is that you need from him that invisible one you need from him the next move hallelujah you understand me because you understand brother branham didn't give himself authority god gave it to him when it came to the first pool god gave it to him when it came to the second pool god gave it to him right even the third pool god gave it to him god came to him hallelujah so under that inspiration under the seven seals this is a seven seal preaching under that seventh seal under that silence something was taking place and she moves into position to receive her position and she said if i perish let me perish i'm going to see the king here's the thing who broke the silence esther broke the silence of the king and when the bride is ready she will break it she will come to that position and she knows i've got to have one-on-one with him you understand what i'm saying the authority of her that god is giving to her will come when she gets to a place where she focus herself on him knowing that he is the only one that can stop death haman is moving and he's moving right now throughout the whole world he's moving and he's coming after the christian yes sir y'all better hear what i'm saying because i'm gonna tell you like this let me move from esther now to samson samson had seven locks which was a covenant of god you understand me he let the world shave it off delilah right samson who pick up the gates of gaza who did all the mighty works the pentecostals who did all of this and that and the other i'm pentecostal but i got the real thing but what happened it was silence y'all remember there were times pentecostals was raising the dead there were times amen i remember in the church i was in the man comes in with a gun and he's shooting shooting shooting and bullets are just dropping off to people not even touching them because they're in the spirit of god that's that's pentecostal yes god was working but they chose a system over god right y'all understand me that's what fasti did she chose her system she allowed all her riches to puff her up and she didn't need the kingdom on but i'm telling you that i need the king amen and what happens she goes she breaks the silent sam's in silence no more activity no miracles he ain't doing nothing but moving around in the same circle grinding at the mirror slave to the devil but at this great feast things began to strike samson so you know what i was raised up to destroy the philistines and he's like like like he's like esting away if i perish let me perish but i will not leave out here until my purpose is fulfilled yes you understand me and as a pride of jesus christ i will not leave here until my purpose is fulfilled whatever it may be in silence nothing happening all of a sudden samson who types out the bride breaks the silence with the prayer oh lord just once more see until we're ready to seek god to move in this last little time that we have it's got to be you you got to get sick and tired of being sick and tired of this world you can't love the things of the world and love god at the same time that's right brother right now you've got to understand and guess what guess what you know what god is so awesome he pushed samson into that position all things work together for the good of them that love the lord even when you make the wrong decision god will intervene and push you back into the place where you should be amen it's going to be painful it will be hard but he's never he said i'll never lose you i can't lose you and so therefore you're going to do it hallelujah he pushed himself so hard he began to remember those days he used to have good times at church and he said oh lord just once more see what samson didn't understand was that his trials was also growing the character of christ in him that's right yes sir because all of a sudden he feels back here that which was gone has now been restored you don't see what's growing in you but your trials are bringing christ to the forefront it is christ in you the hope of glory is what god is doing in you he's building a new man and you got to go through it you got to go through the pain you got to go through the suffering you got to come through the disappointment but god never sleeps the devil said god ain't with you no even when he's silent god is with you he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you hallelujah is that right think about it people of god what god has done for us he's done a mighty mighty mighty mighty mighty work amen amen let me just finish up in just a minute i'm trying to get us to see that when god does something he he does it in a perfect way hallelujah and god amen has brought us to a freedom now even paul says like i was sharing last night i reckon the suffering of this world of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now watch esther because not only does she get half of the king and this is what i'm saying this is not a time to be moping and groping you know this is a time to have your banquet you know what i'm saying and you know when you got a banquet you got some real spiritual wine that you're working with right you don't be you know get drunk in the spirit how many times you've been drunk in the spirit yes not good but let me tell you something there are times you can pray and you can get so lost in prayer that when you get up you can't you stagger yes huh you could get so lost and rejoicing you know in the spiritual you you you're almost out of your mind like where am i drunk in the spirit right see what people fail to see is that when you're drunk in the spirit god is doing something you don't even know what he's doing but he's fixing the whatever problems that's in you right there's so many ways to praise god look even when david saw the ark of the covenant knowing what he had done wrong knowing that he he he did wrong when he put the ark on the card but when he saw that ark coming back he began to dance he began to praise god and guess what in all of that what he had done god says oh look at that man he's a man after my own heart hallelujah you see one thing about the blood of jesus christ it cleanses you and washes you from all sins now look by the grace of god i talked about that don't get this don't forget this even at times in your life when it seems like god is not answering or you feel like he's not listening don't ever go by your feelings when you pray it's good to feel but because you feel oh because you don't feel doesn't mean he's not hearing that's right because the bible said god knows your thoughts are far off yes right so anyway i said all of that to come down to the end of my message if we can get it if we can truly see where those messages brought and and don't think it as like oh or brother branham did you know it was a mighty angel it was god that came down it was god that changed things around for us yes and you and i must understand that this change is yours if you will accept it right see take the very way you did when you wanted to be saved you accepted it when you wanted to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you accepted it and you got baptized yes just that simple you you you you says lord i accept what you've done and you really mean it god will make it manifest in your life you don't have to work at it yes you don't have to say it in a way uh you know a theological way you don't have to have big words to approach god you just got to accept it in your heart once you accept it in your heart god will make it manifest that seed has to come to life there's one quote i want to bring and i i've gotta now so you could understand in the latest in church age brother man says now to show you that he was the first also as he was he the beginning of the creation of god oh do you catch it that used to stumble me all the time the creation of god god is eternal what he's talking about right he says see how god could be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ amen you talking about the body you talk about the body but the spirit was eternal yes god is eternal but he he created jesus it was his own blood it was his own dna it was everything god mary and joseph had nothing to do with it i used to wonder did jesus look more like mary or did he look like joseph neither it was the blood of god it was a new creation and the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest when god lived in him that's what made him a son the created part made him a son that's what makes you sons and daughters the created part but that eternal life had no beginning nor ending yeah it takes faith and faith to bring to revelation he is god created creation oh my that's why jesus said father people say see there's two no there wasn't that wasn't two and it wasn't three if the fullness of god dwelling in a body hallelujah and all that was in god he poured it into christ and all that was in christ he poured it into his bride he is god creation oh my sheep the first and the last the amen the beginning the creation of god when god created and if you can see that you can see your creation yeah yeah i know i know i understand i hear you but when the revelation of this message fully come to you you'll understand what's being said that's what happens you know and and you got to understand when god brings it in plain language you know that you know how can i say it right now the message i'm preaching now if i go preaching in the denomination they'll be hopping over the benches they would because they never heard it before but because we've heard it before oh yeah come on mm-hmm the joy is left but there are certain things that i eat i get happy every time it's true i get happy every time you know some of my friends and i'm closing some of my friends what people don't understand is that let's say it like this i love my friends i love my family but there is no way i would judge god being unfair because he chose me and not them there's nothing i did the only thing that made him choose me is because i was in him and everything that was in him he chose and when it comes to that i i'm not responsible i i really believe that even when the disciples found out that judas was the devil it hurt their feelings but none of them backslid dry brother right understand that everything we go through people said predestination let me tell you what predestination is based upon also predestination is based upon your choosing yes sir yes sir because what you did before the foundation of girl be well you chose him you chose to stand with him then and he said because you chose to stand with me then i will stand with you now that's what it is you chose visual hawaii yeah well god ain't fair he sent people to hell no god don't send nobody to hell you go to hell because you want to go right right you fight your way to hell because you refuse and and people refuse they meant to believe the truth right but if i got up here and i told you a lie a lot of times people love lies it's the truth you don't believe it but let me tell you something look at our look at our uh government you ain't never seen so many liars in your life and everybody loves it it has gotten to the place that that spirit is falling on everybody that's why that's why you better watch your bankers you better watch your insurance people you better watch everybody because everybody now is they just they've been anointed with lies they love to do it if the president can lie i can lie if the president swear i can swear y'all understand me people imitate folks and think it's okay because this person do it in that person listen i don't care who oh what they do i love truth i love my country and i love truth and i'll say it like this by the grace of god this message has come in the right time in the right season and i'll tell you just like there's none of us none of us how could i say it deserves it this is nothing but the mercy and grace of god and i'm gonna close because i took i took a long time last night and i probably took a long time this morning but let me say it like this people of god certain things i can eat and if i don't restrain myself i'll get sick because i keep taking to eat it because i like it so much i used to be hung up on chocolate like that i used to eat chocolate till i think it was coming out of the pores of my skin and god i said lord you got to deliver me from this and the lord delivered me from it and and now i can eat chocolate but i just don't like it like i used to but what i'm trying to say is that when you eat something and you and it's really good you say don't you have more of it and i'm like that with watermelon in the summertime when watermelon if i can find me a good one i go back to the store looking for the same one hoping they got the same sweetness you know what i'm saying it's it's something about the thing that's good you always want more of it and when this bible like like john said i ate it and it was sweet as honey now i don't know whether you ever had that experience but i'm gonna tell you sometimes preachers be preaching and you can almost taste that word right yeah i know y'all think i'm crazy but it's like oh my god that's nice you can almost lick your lips because it's so sweet it's a spiritual thing i'm speaking of now but this is a it's an experience i've had and and you know the priest says i'm gonna stop no say oh no no no don't stop now why because it's so sweet to you you want more of it yes but sometimes you know you get to a service and you think that they've got the better part already ah let me stop god is good to us amen i hope you've been blessed today coach i'm gonna tell you something until we get desperate and god gonna bring the desperation you can't you can't turn it on god has to bring circumstances because we as people we are lazy that's our man is sometimes god has to put the whip to him push him or something to drive him to make him do what he needs him to do and that's what's happening right now god is going to do it brother i'm going to call it the squeeze when though when the world council of churches began to come down on you and people of god whether you see it or not it's closing in it looks innocent right because it looked like okay the world is against the conservatives but most conservative consider themselves as christians they don't want to hear the bible they want nothing to do with the bible you may not even be a conservative but if you're a christian just being a christian uh people are now shutting down on you they are because they they link you to being a conservative y'all understand what i'm trying to say right but this thing is going to swing in a moment and and i know everybody says oh it's going to get better no it's not going to get better the bible said evil seduces and all whacks worse and worse and so you got to understand if you're not ready now the best thing to do is get ready now because when it becomes worse you know what they're doing in australia you know what they're doing in israel i mean this not the mark of the beast but it's coming to be that it's it's moving into that channel the next thing is is that the churches are gonna raise up watch it folks i know y'all think i'm crazy they're going to raise up and they're going to unite and then they're going to start forcing things and there is no way amen this thing will even get to the mark of the beast without bloodshed y'all understand what i'm saying it's coming and and what you gonna do you little lamb what you gonna do that's the time you pray now because your character now will will be tested to the max will you come out swinging you know like peter don't you attack my word all right what you gonna do i'll tell you what you do remember this he was led to a slaughter a sheep led to the slaughter and the bible said he opened not his mouth gonna come to that if the same nature that was in in the in in smyrna age and those ages where they persecuted where these people ran to their deaths huh they weren't afraid to die who afraid to die in here if you are you need jesus i'm not afraid and i know by god's grace i would die for any of you in here without even thinking about it somebody come through the door whatever says who going to die in front of it for these people i could truly say i would be the one because i'm not afraid and i realized that everything after if i die everything will be taken care of y'all know what i'm saying death is just just a vehicle to get you to the place where god is intending for you to be heaven and so don't be afraid you you get you get to a place you get hungry and i'm gonna tell you something god does some miracles for my life all the time in in in and i'm closing you may stand so i could you could help me out you know but god always mirror he just do miracles you know don't ever worry about not not not even your finances don't don't do that yes god will always take care of you god i i you know i'm i'm marvel and sometimes god makes me repent because sometimes i get too concerned and as soon as i and then here come a blessing uh you know and don't don't think i'm pulling for nothing i'm not but i'm trying to tell you you don't have to worry about nothing that's right you oh where i'm gonna pay this and how i'm gonna pay my bill don't worry about it put it in the master's hand we still got real christians yeah amen i think i told this story i'm a close my mama she's always been my a great example for me she's gone on to be with the lord but my mom she was such a prayer warrior and i'm always praying and asking god to at least give me half of what she had i think i'll be okay but she used to pray she should pray for hours hours hours one thing my mom would say junior god gonna bless us with bob this today and there were times i would halfway here and you know when i would halfway here god would always make it so that i would be there when it happened he made me a believer before i became a believer that's why nobody can take away the supernatural i seen supernatural before i became a believer you understand what i'm saying before i became a christian i saw that and what i'm trying to say is that you and i have the power and the authority to put the devil under your feet why don't you do it because the devil is going to make you a slave why not make him one you got the authority you got the power you need to place your life in god's hand to the devil get get confused about you well i know he used to do this and i know how you could do that on her and she would do exactly what i said and now he comes again and he knocks him on the door ain't nobody home the man or the woman that used to live here don't live no more y'all know what i'm saying people of god i don't know maybe i'm just envisioning something that's not real but in my vision i see perfection i see god and i'm not stopping until it's there to the full manifestation of jesus christ is living through me in every respect i expect in my life of my life let's bow the word of prayer father god i come before you i i see what you're doing i see the time and the seasons that we're in and lord jesus i i know that without you lord that we can't accomplish any of these things but lord i know father you promised it lord and we're the promised seed you promised uh you know isaac and rebecca you you told them uh you know what would come and you told them lord god who the the children that they would have and lord you promised oh god you know uh uh abraham and sarah and that promise he came not ishmael but isaac it moves on it keeps moving it keeps moving it keeps moving and and even though jacob was the firstborn you you told uh rebecca that jacob would not be the heir lord that it would be uh isaac and oh god it moves on it moves on and here we are lord there were many christians way before us millions of them but the promising that last they see that seed that would come into the very development of you coming to the very fullness of you oh god we thought christians were just people that went to church and sing and you know shouted and danced and you know all of those things we just thought you know being a christian was something on that line but we didn't understand the born-again part we didn't understand that being born again was being born of you and to be born of you is to be born of a god and to be born of a god is to become a god and that god is you lord not us but christ in us we're growing up to be like you father i pray lord jesus that you have mercy on us forgive us from all our unbelief even though we know that unbelief can't stop you whatever you will to be done will be done lord hallelujah because the devil don't believe doesn't mean that he's not going to be thrown into the lake of the fire lord and because we stumble sometimes and come short doesn't mean that we won't reach our goal because father not one portion of your word can come back to your void i am so grateful i am so grateful and father i think about it sometime that even so lord if you decide to not have me go to heaven i can't help but to worship you even now because lord you've given me a part of peace of heaven even on earth and lord my life has been changed my life has been changed and it's still changing from glory to glory not because of me but because of you and the words that you promised that would be you said in all of us lord that he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it i trust you lord i trust your word i trust your prophecies i trust all of your promises fatherly and lord god your god and even as job said i'll wait till my change comes have thy no way lord with the young people the people here those who are listening attentively lord i pray that the word found place the things that i did not say i pray that somehow you reveal to them in their spirit the things that was needed to be said forgive us lord god if we said anything contrary to your word i ask that you wipe it out of the minds and the spirits of the people my odd harsh desire was to so perfect [Music] that perfect word and perfect manifestation bless us lord cleanse us right now give us what we stand in need of as we thank you father god in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen sing it with me make me more [Music] jesus make me more likely oh give me a heart that's [Music] that thing that was again make me more like me oh man [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you jesus [Music] filled with [Music] again [Music] [Music] oh [Music] maybe the more that i surrender [Music] the lighter my lord the more that i release my cares the more you take control oh the more that i can humble myself the more [Music] and every day i live [Music] surrender my lord [Music] [Music] as our price to come [Music] oh [Music] the more that i release my cares the more you take control and the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up and every day [Music] [Applause] [Music] what

for the word of god let's thank the lord again praise god amen such a blessed people to hear the word of god and i just told brother brooks i said the reason we're not shouting is because we're just tired you know when remember when brother diggs was here we were shouting the first night and then quiet the next night remember the cameras here we were shouting the first night we were tired the next night i thought about our church brother but our hearts are in it man oh we love the word of god brother and that was beautiful message man hallelujah i just you know i was so blessed you know at the beginning you were talking about running i just preached on the cities of refuge how we had to run to christ remember that brother austin you know that lena was here last sunday or almost everybody was out with cove and you know but hopefully they listen to it on the live stream i thought man this is just what we just what we need aren't you glad the book is open praise god we have a question about marriage and divorce we have a question about uh salvation or the baptism of the holy ghost or the future home we can open up that book and the book is open to us praise god we're not bound by creeds and denominations hallelujah but we're given the revelation of thus saith the word of god amen thank god i've been drunk numerous times on the holy ghost dancing around here these last few months when they got the holy ghost they were drunk the bible said they were declaring the wonderful works of god oh hallelujah amen it happens all the time amen as long as we yield to that right when we declare god's glory god's word his works we're drunk in the holy ghost i'm so glad i can get drunk on spiritual wine and not natural wine amen austin i were talking how bad the natural wine tastes and the beer takes off all those things but holy ghost wine it's refreshment it's life to the soul amen hallelujah thank god we know what we're talking about amen and church we're just thankful
