TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to us and looking for more of that tonight and I know that God has got a whole lot more to say to us than just what we heard this morning because the word is eternal and it just keeps going and going

to have no room for for preaching if I don't amen amen let's stand together we'll get right into the word of the lord well it's easy thing to say you folks about preach me to death this morning ain't no doubt about it somebody said are you all right brother Ben can you preach I preach seven Services just like this right here amen it don't bother me a bit little horse don't mean I'm going to stop amen that's the good part being able to give what you got for the Lord Jesus and amen and it's a a good thing to Bear the marks of the service of Christ in your body we may not always get to do them at a steak or being whipped or beat or something like that like it was in the olden days of Christianity amen but we can certainly bear the marks of Christ in our body and our mind and our thoughts and battling the things that we do during the day fighting the devil every time we turn around we'll sure bear some scars along the way don't you think so amen let's uh let's go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 14: 37 and we're going to look tonight at the divine order of the church and we're going to really spend some time the Lord helping us I want to try to labor on why we come and uh what the purpose of church is and so you know we we we know that coming to the house of the Lord is an important thing because Paul told us not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together and he told us even more so as you see the day approaching so the later the hour is supposed to get the more that we're supposed to actually gather together and I think it's amazing that you know there's leadership in this message that absolutely do not believe that we should meet together like we do they think that the better way is stay at home listen to the message of the hour and you know not even come to church and you know I I understand what they're getting at when they say that you know uh uh preachers have caused problems and churches have got problems but Walmart's got problems you know JC Pennies have got problems I I don't stay home I go shopping amen amen when I need something new ain't that right amen so we we should always Endeavor to come to the house of God now 1 Corinthians 14:37 excuse me if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord I want you to notice this very very carefully Paul is not offering us suggestions this is not an if you think it's okay and if it's acceptable to how you feel about things or you know if everybody at church or School agrees with you this is the Commandment of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues all all things be done decently and in order I like that very much is't that wonderful now you you you think you might know what the word order means here as I did myself but actually order is more than just what we would call an orderly condition or the state of things being in a nice order running order smooth order but this word taxis also means oppos a rank or a position which one holds so let's read it again with that in mind all things be done decently and in the post the rank or the position in which one holds amen so everything in the church is to be done according to what you've been called to do you stay in that calling too whatever God calls you to do stay right in that now I want to read to you from the greatest battle ever fought and brother brandom is out with the brother and he's laying kind of on the ground like and they're sleeping bags and what more and they're talking about the Lord and things and he he's looking up into the stars and he's using the stars is a a place to preach and he's talking about how each star is set in some certain place and how it's in order the way God said it and then he brings it down to Christianity to the elect and he said the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit I think of that for just a moment we should continually strive to keep the order of the spirit in other words we should strive continually to keep doing the thing that God called us to do whatever that is that God wants us to do we do it and then notice this again when one member gets out of order now this is an easy thing for the devil to use on us and say now see there you've made some mistake or you're not exactly living up to par like you think you should you're not walking like you think you should and we all have moments like that in our Christianity and Satan will tell us now see there you're out of order not true when a person is being just a regular good oldfashioned human and they're doing human stuff as long as you're repenting and you're trying to stay within the thing that God called you to do you are still in God's eyes still in order am but it's only when you refuse to do what you know you're supposed to supposed to be doing and you neglect that purpose in your life whatever God called you to do or whatever he placed you in and you neglect that it's going to put you in a state of disorder and in that condition brother B talked about the sins of Believers and things like that he said could knock someone out of getting healed at the platform when things start getting out of order in that way that's why the Lord wants us to maintain continually strive for the order of the spirit is that beautiful just such powerful words let's let's pray over it all can we lord Jesus we thank you so much Lord to come back into this place this uh getting toward the evening time in the night coming down lord where you spoke to Adam and Eve in the cool of the even of the evening time now as the sun's going down may you father once again may you come into this place speak to us in the cool of the evening may you take your word and may you so minister to our hearts that Lord we'll be able to walk out of here understanding the deeper side of what it is that we are to be as your children whether it be a post or a rank or position or whatever you've given us help us to find that place stay in that place and fulfill exactly whatever order you've placed in our hearts we want to commit these things to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ asking you to anoint me them everything around us Lord may it be anointed for the glory of God whatever little purpose or plan or whatever you'd have for tonight we yield oursel to thy presence in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen and amen we love the Lord he's so good to us amen oh he's so good to us now looking at this I I I I want to really focus upon leadership starting out I want to kind of really lean heavy on the ministry side of this and then we're going to bring it down down to the congregation but I want to start right at the top and thankfully I can uh save a little time for all of us tonight because we covered some of it this morning with the star of the age knowing that the star is the one that gets the message and then the messenger takes that message preaches it out there and then those that have ears to hear that are gifted man and woman then they can take that message and receive it under their hearts men that are called to preach and Housewives mothers and whatever more that are called to rece receive and put in action school kids and whatever they might be uh uh uh widows according to the Bible I'm talking about scriptural widows and uh painters and Factory workers and you name them once that message has been delivered then all of us have a Divine place within that message God don't send the message out unless the reciprocal part is you finding a position that God thought of you as being in and then you getting in that place according to God's desire and staying in that amen until all of the whole Army of God is put together fitly joined no Schism in that body amen ready to come amen ready to go in the Rapture resurrection and ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so in that regard amen every one of us have a rank or position in which God wants us to be able to uh find not only that position by the Holy Spirit but stay in that position as well I can't can't stress enough how many times it is that God will reveal something to someone and rather than stay in that amen they try to find little wiggle rooms and wiggle holes and loopholes and wiggle tails and wiggle wiggle wiggle PL out of what God called him to do amen and we don't want to be wigglers amen We Want to Hold Steady amen under the grace of God that has been given to us to do what we've been called to do and then touching back upon this in 1 Corinthians Paul is speaking to not only those that are prophets remember a prophet is a new testament preacher we know that as well amen so this encompasses all of the ministry but to those that consider themselves to be spiritual as well there are many that would consider themselves to be spiritual though they don't preach and though they don't uh go out yonder and travel and things and maybe go to the mission field or something like that but they would consider themselves to be spiritual people well Paul said if that be the case if you're a spiritual or a prophet Amen in any way whatsoever you are must acknowledge what I wrote was the Commandment of the Lord amen and as brother Jesse and I was talking for in Fellowship here after church the Holy Spirit dropped a little nugget on us and I never thought of it he never thought of it amen but for those this morning of course preaching on this this morning's message about you know them thinking that Paul wanted to do do away with the prophets how in the world could he do away with the prophetic when he himself was a prophet amen never thought of it like that until the holy spirit let us catch that amen in Fellowship this afternoon but why would Paul do away with the prophets when he himself was a prophet amen the word of the Lord came unto Paul so he's not going to do away with himself surely no amen he did not deny if you'll notice that there was prophets in the land he did not deny that there were other spiritual people in the land other than him but what Paul said was if that man or woman or whoever they are thinks himself to be spiritual or a prophet let that person ever who they are are acknowledge what I've wrote right here is the Commandment of the Lord amen so these are not suggestions these are not just maybe if you feel like it kind of sort of down the road if the mood strikes you and everything feels right this is a commandment of the Lord amen he starts out if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant telling the people to covet to prophesy but forbid not to speak with tongues let everything be done decently and in the position the rank or the position that someone holds now if you'll notice the group that he's talking to here he is talking to the Corinthian Bunch now I I I know that many times when we preach about this Corinthian Church we have a tendency to really kind of push him in a corner and be in this bad misbehaved group of people and they're all mixed up in Every Which Way But I want to show you by the help of the Lord tonight why they were the way they were and let me start by saying to you that the Ephesians the Galatians the Philippians the Lans the Romans and all the rest of these people they had their problems exactly like the Corinthian Church did amen all you have to do is just pick up Ephesians chapter one Paul starts out to the Saints he greets them tells them they're in Heavenly places talks about their birth amen and he's not hardly into the into the beginnings of chapter two and three and four and five and six all the way through the rest of it is nothing more than Paul admonishing them amen love one another don't have grudges don't be jealous fathers don't provoke your kids to wrath husbands love your wives wife loves your husband amen and the whole family of God be fitly joined amen together in the in the unity of the spirit amen so Paul dealt with these people in the Ephesus Church amen the same way he dealt with the Galatians old foolish Galatians who have Bewitched you amen and tried to turn you from the doctrine that was once delivered and already delivered amen if ye would than yourself amen a a spiritual man or ye would think yourself a prophet of some sort he said I want you to know that if me or an angel preached anything contrary to that which has been delivered let that man or that person be a cursed amen so Paul was dealing with all of these churches the Romans just go through the Romans and look at their troubles look down through the thessen Lans they all had issues they all had problems amen but the difference between them and the Corinthian Church was if you look in the Ephesian church just for example amen they had all the gifts of the Spirit they had all of the workings of the Holy Spirit among them amen they had pastors they had teachers evangelists prophets Apostles they had everything in order the way it was supposed to be amen and those people in the Ephesus Church age amen they had preachers to straighten them out and get them right amen leadership was the primary thing that kept him running in the right direction but when you come to these poor old Corinthians right here they didn't have pastors and preachers like that right brother right we know that's true amen because when we open up the chapter Paul said it been heard from the house of Facebook I mean the house of Khloe amen that a man had lived with his father's wife amen now watch Paul did not un christianize this man he did not throw him in hell he did not say he was an off off scow or reprobate of some sort amen but he said uh me being absent I've already judged it in the Spirit he said that you should turn this one over to the devil for the destruction of the flesh but the saving of the Soul you know what's so amazing about that to me amen is that church discipline of that nature has been put in such a manner to where that the least little thing that people have done through the years amen they've been turned over to the devil amen they don't want to obey the pastor in certain things some Deacon gets upset amen and calls them down on something and they have a little bit of war in the church and at one time there were pastors that were were bold enough just to go in there and turn them all over to the devil amen and leave it at that but when you look at when Paul be to turn this man over to the devil the reason he done it was because there was no leadership in that church among those people that could set a standard of what living right repentance or anything else look like amen so Paul knew if I don't set the stage and and provide an example of how discipline works in the house of God Amen how many more fathers lives are these men going to be living with amen so Paul set this man out there as a model or an example to a group of leaderless people that didn't know which way it was up down or anywhere else stay with me a little while amen remember this very same group right here amen they turn right around and they are coming to the communion table can you imagine coming to the table to take the supper of the Lord amen and getting drunk at the Lord's table amen one is Apollo one is Paul one is this one is that one had a Psalm one had a tongue one had a hymn one had this one had that they were the mixed upst bunch of people you've ever seen in your life amen why they did not have pastors preachers and leaders equipped to deal with the challenge of those Corinthian people had they had had good leaders you'd have been reading about them the same as you would the Ephesians that's right had there been good preachers in place you'd have had the same circumstance out of them as you would have had amen the Philippines uh uh uh not the Philippines but the Philippians I mean amen out of the uh the Philippian church I'm trying to say Amen as you would have had in the Corinthian Bunch should have been the same on the other side Amen in other words the leadership amen was not able to bring the people into an understanding of their position their order and how God wanted them to behave in the house of God it wasn't whether or not they love Jesus it wasn't a matter whether they were saved or born again but many of these people did not they lack the instruction that they needed to know how to serve God it was their behavior in the house of God that's exactly what it was amen now uh looking at this let's turn now to 1 Timothy chapter 4 I want to pick up verse 11 12 and 13 and while you're turning there listen this in the message leadership brother B said the first steps that any of us ever made somebody led us we have to be led people don't want to be led anymore right they don't want somebody get in their business and telling them how to do things sir if you listen to me close the real bride of Christ wants leadership amen yes sir she wants leadership in the pull pit she wants leadership in the home they want leadership in school wherever they can go they want proper leadership to lead them into the right things now want you look at this relationship on the other side of this now we've talked about the preachers for just a little bit let's flip the coin over a little bit and talk about y'all first cor uh 1 Timothy rather chapter 4:1 now watch Paul going right back into it these things command and teach pretty powerful language he's not just referring back to these things or suggestions or ideas this is a part of my suggestion box in the church and I pulled out the first comment card and so I'm going to read that it's a good thing pastors don't have suggestion boxes in their churches you matter what a mess it be one brother said to me one time he said we do have suggestion boxes it's called email text message telephone amen I said that's probably about right amen but a leader amen must not only command but and teach this but a man that is in leadership a leadership position a man that is following the spirit of God Amen has to also understand how this works right here here because no matter how gifted I might be God May vest every gift there is in the body in me if ain't nobody to serve and there ain't nobody that I can be in service to what good is I have all of that in me if there's nobody I can help amen it'd be like having a bank account full of money and not one person with a bank account number to claim it you can have all of that stored up in the bank amen like when I was a kid you could be like Scrooge McDuck and swim through your money amen you can have so much of it amen it be coming out of your ears as we say down south but if there's no one that has a claim to it it doesn't do any good so the idea is not oh look at the ministry of God how gifted they might be that's true there's many of them that are so gifted amen they have such abilities that it Wows you to listen at and preach yes I've listened at some brethren in my time amen that I'm telling you just knows how to get to long cut brother they know how to preach and I enjoy them and I listen to them and I feed from them amen and I know that they're God's men but the reason I can benefit from him it's because I'm sitting on the other side listening to it now watch how Paul threads this together look at him there again verse 12 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word conversation charity Spirit Faith Purity till I come give attendance to reading exhortation and to uhoh bleep to Doctrine now that scares a lot of people because the idea many times is that only the ministry can deal with Doctrine right absolutely incorrect the congregation also needs to understand Doctrine I figured some of y'all get a little quiet on me about this because we've got that idea that preachers have have some kind of elevated Revelation above everybody else who told you that lie who deceived you to believe such foolishness as that preachers do not have a superior Revelation amen R into The Sweet Spot already we're in the middle of the honey might as well get good and sticky while we're here now what I want you to understand is that the gift in a preacher's life is not designed to go into a higher realm than what you can go it's not designed to see things beyond what the leoty can see let me liken it this way brother man talked about the Bible being like a puzzle see the way that it works is that all of us and I mean all of us with our Bible open our heart open our our our our lives invested in the message of the hour we all have our puzzle pieces on the table so to speak and all of us are working them puzzle pieces according to the grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ all of us are working it out if you understand anything at all God does not discriminate based upon your gender or the color of your skin or how much money you got in the bank account or what church you go to or who your pastor might be or what your family's last name is flesh and blood does not reveal these things amen but my Father which is in heaven somebody say Amen this does not come because of who you are it comes because God selects to show you and chooses to reveal to you the things that you have in your life now many of you sitting there women included can understand every Doctrine in the Bible I'm gonna let that one soak bone deep for just a minute because we got a lot of men that ain't nothing more nothing less than chauvinist pigs they are nothing but a bunch of chauvinist women hating people right does they treat sisters like second class citizens that can't have a revelation about nothing that's right but that is not true a woman can have every Revelation that anyone on this Earth can have Revelation is not limited to whether you're a male or you're a female that's right there's not a female Bible and then a male Bible there's not female doctrines and male doctrines sir yes sir you're getting quiet on me but I'm coming anyways amen there is not any kind of gender than even Paul said in the body of Christ is neither male nor female God does not reveal based on well he's a man he can knows more I know where you're heading already but brother Ben brother Bram said a woman is a million times easier to deceive than a man deceive we're not talking about deception we're talking about Revelation amen yes sir this ain't got nothing to do with deception we're talking about Revelation Revelation by The Spirit Well but she's the weaker vessel oh oh I see so God is a respector of persons then so because you're the weaker vessel he chooses to S leave a set of Revelation for the men and then reserves a special dumb down lower class version of Revelation to you sisters no God don't do things like that but what we can understand is that when he called the woman a weaker vessel it wasn't a put down it wasn't God diminishing Your Role or your rank or your position in Christ all he was doing was warning us stupid men don't try to treat that woman the same as yourself that's right understand God made her different in the way she feels and the way she behaves but that's talking about the natural we're not talking about the spiritual Amen in the spiritual realm a woman can have every revelation of mank can well my God there's many sisters in this church and I figure y'all be having Pentecost right about now woo come on sis get your mouth open amen right this is your time to shine I'm giving you all the information and the ammunition amen remember that a woman can have every single Revelation a man can you can understand the godhead you can understand baptism you can understand uh amen serpent seed the Thunders the seals every Revelation that's out there you can understand it amen and God does not hold it back nor reserve it because you're a woman all of us are working our puzzle now have you ever come to a spot in something that you're studying or looking looking at you just can't figure it out how it all puts together I like to work puzzles I've told you this before my granny my dad's mom was a puzzle lover and I am too now my wife you know she hates a puzzle with a passion I I I think it goes like this the devil and then a puzzle I think that's the way it goes but I don't know I've almost cons kind of convinced her to like him a little bit you know she said no way see see what I'm talking about right there amen I tried but you can see the immediate response no way Jose right now under no circumstances do I ever work a puzzle without putting that box in front of me to see what I'm working by and I never try to put any Doctrine together unless I keep my picture right here before me right the picture is the word of God that we work off of what we see in the Bible am and work out these quotes and these ideas and these thoughts and these things according to what we know in the scripture here's the difference between lay people and a preacher I'm working my puzzle too there are things that I don't understand in the word as well but one day I'm sitting in the study and I'm turning this piece this way and that away and I'm trying to find out the way it goes and I've tried to fit it in there a 100 times I Know It Don't Fit and all of a sudden the holy spirit says turn it this away and so I'll take it and turn it that way and Boop it pops right into the spot well then I can be excited and thrilled and be enthused about what God showed told me because now I can come to the platform and say all you dear puzzle workers all you sainted puzzle workers that's been turning this way try it this way and see if it fits it's not that I have a superior Revelation but the gifting of the Lord would allow me to put the things in proper position so you that don't understand maybe how certain things would fit I can guide you in Revelation about how it fits together in the scripture cuz remember you don't need need a preacher to lead you every step of the way when you get saved you can hear the gospel get be preached amen you don't need to understand this thing and that thing and all these Collective Revelations to get saved and receive the Holy Ghost God can deal with your heart you can get born again amen just a simple sermon amen from anybody amen could I I know men and women got saved under women preachers and everything give their heart to God by hearing the gospel preach doesn't matter about the vessel amen but after a person receives the Holy Ghost and becomes a real scriptural puzzle worker they're going to need some men anointed to guide him in how to work their puzzle pieces out this is why I said this morning brother Bram did not have a superior Revelation to everybody else it just so happened he was called of God to be the first one to know how to turn them pieces in what direction they need to be turned so he could tell us how to fit them in there Hallelujah 2,000 years of church history amen there's been a lot of conjecture about the way way things are supposed to look in the scripture you talk about a man that's given a responsibility like brother randam to go in there and have to take all of those years of church history and thread them together and Lace them together with the Bible so that you and I could understand Rapture Resurrection Holiness amen the the original sin the baptism of the Holy Ghost forgiveness of sins the blood of Christ the chemistry the token all these other great things of God Amen no wonder he had to stay focused on the message of the hour yes glory god especially equipped him but notice you are supposed to give attendance to reading exhortation and Doctrine you want to know one reason why you come to church and the preacher does all the work and you don't do nothing because we've been taught the other way around of things we go to church we listen we go to church we hear we go to church he's done you go home but we don't come with the idea many times of being trained that when you come to church you have a contribution to make now here's the beautiful thing about it if let's say brother Jesse is going to bring a sermon you've been working on it for a month we'll say the Lord's been dealing with him on certain things and he puts this thing in order and pulls that in and right up to the time Amazing Grace is being sung or only believe he's putting that final piece of the puzzle right in its place so he can bring a message now how effective is he going to be if the people he's preaching to don't do any homework right don't study don't pray don't listen to the message don't give attendance to reading exhortation or doctrine how effective do you think that Ministry is going to be we've seen it already through the years we've seen how effective they are they ain't the preacher gets up there and he he Stomps around and and he punches away at things and D drives away at things trying to get the people into it he's got to beat the time at them come on somebody come on somebody come on somebody come on somebody when you see that you know you've got a bunch of lazy students cuz they're not doing their work if they were already givings to reading exhortation and Doctrine come on now then the preacher wouldn't have to work too hard you would already know where he's coming from and most of the time you'd be sitting there saying my god I've been waiting all week to figure out how to turn that puzzle piece I've been looking at that all week thank God for the man of God to tell me how the Holy Spirit showed him how to put it sir you say but God don't do that hold on who who brother B's sitting in his chair looking at the picture of Life magazine they've already taken it two years it's been in circulation and all of a sudden the prophet's looking at it and the Holy Spirit says turn it this way you can hear him on the tape when brother man turns it and shows him then you hear him go he said see his eyes see Jesus looking down there see his beard and his hair he's that white wig one that Supreme judge Oh Glory of heavens and earth Hallelujah God told him how to turn the peace amen just like he could tell you how to turn your pieces but you've got to give yourself to reading exhortation and Doctrine sister don't spend all your time just studying on about how to how how to you know about dress and Holiness and and just looking at things like that sit down and learn about the seals sit down and figure the godhead out s now spend time with water baptism what in the world is it going to hurt if you know more about your own salvation how is that going to hurt you to know more about the Bible and the man that wrote the Bible that you love wouldn't you want to know about more of his letter hallelujah oh but I I wouldn't want to get deceived you got the Holy Ghost if you are born again my goodness for the Sisters tonight Brothers you are dismissed amen hallelujah hallelujah amen but if you look at all of these great things of God Amen there's nothing in this Bible right here amen that would allow you to be deceived if you are born again of the spirit of godj the elected cannot be deceived it's impossible to deceive them hallelujah amen be it a man a woman or whoever it is yes the elected cannot be deceived amen that's just a a a crutch that men in this message have leaned on because they like keeping their women under their thumb keeping them beat down in subjection treating them like you know baby makers and Pie makers forgive me but a woman has a whole lot more value than that in the body of Christ and I'll even submit to you that sometimes women can be more spiritual than some of us egg-headed hard-headed men that's right brother yes praise the Lord somebody oh I know some of y'all sisters ain't going to holler amen that's tradition in you that's not keeping you from hollering amen oh I don't want to believe something like that brother Ben but is true amen just because he's a man doesn't give him an automatic pass on to being the greatest of the greatest of the greatest there are some men that are so sorry you should the dogs won't even bark their name they're so low down that amen they couldn't get no lower than the snake's belly the way they behave amen there's some Godly women in those homes that through the conversation alone can win them ungodly men to the Lord amen I sat and had supper wife and I had supper with amen a a couple that we had met amen we've known him for a number of years but never had any fellowship and a brother and sister was telling the story and he was testifying of all the different things that he'd got into when he backslid and went out into the world Amen and all of the little abuses and the things that come along with a worldly man like that amen and I I love this part of the story he said I even at one time he said I got so cruel he said that I set up little cameras and things around the room to try to catch her in something amen he said and I did catch her in something I said what was that he said said I caught her praying and calling on the name of the Lord and calling my name out to God asking God to save me and deliver me he said I caught her all right he said but I caught her not doing the thing I thought she might be doing amen he said I figured she'd be doing something worldly amen running around on me or something like that he said but when I turned that little thing on and looked at the replay on the camera said there she was on her knees calling out to the Lord some women can be spiritual if they allow it yes amen if they allow thems to be spiritual they can be I know that women have a place in the body that they're not allowed to preach and not allowed to hold a office in the church like that I understand that and I understand that the women are supposed to be quiet as far as you know the the business matters of the assembly amen and if they have a question let their ask their own husband at home I get that but that is not because you're stupid that's not because you're ignorant that's not because you're dumb but it's keeping the order of the spirit that's all that is that you have a place as a woman and God wants you to keep that order and if there's a Godly Man there all you have to do is go speak it and the Holy Spirit will use you and put it in his heart about the right choice to make or the thing to say whatever it might be you can be a great influence in that way if you'll allow yourself to be amen amen my family on my side amen rais more shinness and I can shake a stick at and you know what it's a good thing many of my cousins and uncles and different ones Through The Years got a a hold of some of them corn Fred fed cornbred women amen because when they tried to do their little bully and Bulldog thing some of them women would fight back thank God for them cuz some of them big mouse they needed to have a little taste of their own medicine words Amen in case you forgot it sauce for the goose is good for the gander amen it's exactly right he can't walk around and talk about you better respect me be respectable she can right live a life she can respect and she will respect you amen I don't say that we don't have to lay down the laws sometimes in our home as Leaders we all have to put our foot down about certain things there's always going to be fusses and arguments and back and forth like that but if the people were talking about or Born Again of the holy spirit amen God will have the final say in what takes place amen it's exactly right but in the meantime we are to give oursel to reading exhortation and to Doctrine why in the world do we have people around this rank of this truth that believes that you can't get a revelation unless some preacher's preaching it to you you can receive a revelation at your houseall you can hear Brother bam say something and a revelation light your soul on fire that's right you don't need a preacher for that Revelation to bring you anywhere as far as whether you had it yourself or not that's between you and God amen amen and when God's going to give somebody Revelation he don't email all his preachers and ask for permission by the way I have yet to receive a text message from my phone's in there I I've yet to receive a text message from the Lord saying is it okay to give Jesse a revelation this week God does what he wants to do am and he does it with every open heart that's willing to receive him so our job as a congregation is to give attendance to reading exitation Doctrine I love this word be th an example it means a pattern or stroke or a blow leaving an impression this is the way we should live our life be it charity conversation Spirit Faith purity of word whatever it might be leave an impression on somebody before they leave your presence amen now let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4 now we're just going to read one verse of this save time because we quoted a much of it this morning I'm going pick up verse 16 now I want you to go a little deeper with me tonight about this part on the ministry a little bit all right now you'll notice that the whole body fitly joined together watch now compacted by which every joint supplieth this word compacted means to coales to join to unite to knit together in affection but it also means to prove to demonstrate to teach or instruct so in other words when the body becomes compacted together not only are they going to to demonstrate the word that's being preached in their lives in their families their homes and what more but they're also going to be able to reciprocate that and teach and instruct thems remember what Paul said when you should be teachers yourself still you have desire to be taught amen it's needful that I write unto you these things concerning the Commandments of the Lord Paul knowing they didn't have instructors that could teach him what was right think back now think every time you've ever had those areas of your life when you felt like the worst of a Christian you're trying to serve God to the best of your ability think back who was leading you at the time what kind of Pastor what kind of Shepherd what kind of evangelist what kind of influence were you under in the ministry yes many of the things that you didn't know wasn't because you didn't have a heart to receive them it's because you didn't have anybody to preach it to you you didn't have anyone to teach it to you therefore you don't know what you don't know come on somebody yes sir if you don't know it how you supposed to know it amen notice the word compacted here now anybody that knows anything about laying concrete you may not well let me give you the easy version of this they go out yonder and they scrape a place on the ground they not make it nice and level and clean they pour a bunch of rock on the bottom they put some metal rebar type stuff in there just strengthen it and hold it all together but before they put that rebar in there where the concrete is going to be on top that bar like that and it'll solid it'll it'll it'll cure up solid they put up a like a strong layer of good solid rock on the bottom now these concrete people know that if I lay that rock and walk off there and leave it and pour that concrete on top of it that when the seasons begin to change that stuff flexes and bends you can't see it but it moves cuz the Earth is always moving the tectonic plates are pulling and everything up on top of it's pulling with those plates asz you know the Earth is one big magnet so things is pulling this way and twisting and every which way and any good concrete layer whether there weight and salt knows that if I leave that rock loose in there you're going to have all kinds of cracks and breaks and everything in that material whenever it gets too many storms come along so he goes across with a machine or he takes a big hand tool and tamps it they call it one of the worst jobs I've ever done in my entire life thank God I'm a preacher in that case amen it's the only time I've ever been grateful to be a preacher amen he takes this big thing and it goes across and it pushes and it compacts or they got machines now where you can turn them on and it vibrates and you go across and it presses these rocks tightly together once they are compacted then you can lay your bar out pour your concrete on it and then let the winds and the seasons change let the winds blow and the storms come amen for years to come after that that concrete is still holding tightly and firm with no cracks in Revelation anywhere amen this is what Paul is saying the whole body must be fitly joined together remember as I've preached to it here before many years I've been saying this coming up here amen remember confessions are like stones but it takes a sharp tool to shape that stone into the image of Christ to fit fit fitly be joined into the body of Christ but after you are fit into the body of Christ after you are placed in your position then you've got to be compacted together amen the Holy Ghost has got to come amen and drill you down and cling you that much closer together that's why God sometimes will send an evangelist like me with a good sharp tool and a machine that does this the whole time you're in church and sometimes people get done in Services of mine I can almost see them doing this number when they're walking out Hallelujah the compactor has done his job all over again amen that's right sometimes we've got to be compacted together so when the storm hits the body the solid foundation will hold hallelujah amen so the ministry's job is to help the body to coales to come together same Revelation same Faith yes same understanding Hallelujah same scriptural Foundation of Truth right with the same experience with God same Holy Ghost yes bringing us all together into one complete compacted unit of Jesus Christ kind of like that photo on the wall when the Capstone sits on it cuz when the Capstone fitly sets down on all those fitly pieces you can't put a razor blade between them they are so tightly moved and positioned together nothing can separate them from the love that is in Christ jesusall Oh Glory to God that's part of the ministry's job is to bring the people the bride together but you know here's where we get all twisted up in another direction we think oh my goodness look at this person doing this thing and that thing they're doing their own thing not everybody's going to get on board right but it's our job as preachers to look for the ones to search out the ones that want to be compacted I I want to say something to you if you're not willing to be compacted you don't want to be a part of the body of Christ right only God's men can fulfill this role anybody else comes along with a sharp tool with a tamper or a compacting machine or any other kind of tool and try to to do the same job it messed the whole thing up and when the storm comes along it proves they didn't know what they were doing in the first place all it takes is for you to look back on your life and realize anytime you've ever spiritually cracked it's because you had a leader that didn't tell you how to fitly put the thing together right oh you say you shouldn't blame the preacher why not he's the one to blame you say he's not hold on brother Brenham said we talked so much about juvenile delinquency he said juvenile delinquency comes from parent delinquency he said but actually that delinquency comes from a greater delinquency what he call pull pit delinquency right brother because a man ain't willing to deal with the thing that he needs to deal with or the things plural he needs to deal with amen it puts the congregation in a spot where they're loose living any way they live and doing anything they want to do so that preacher's got to come along and say Hey you saints of God quit just gossiping about one another yes sir spending whole Services telling you to straighten up and pray and read the Bible and get that bitterness out of your heart don't you know what's happening the Holy Ghost is come glory to God Amen he's compacting you together cuz once he gets you tight then he knows he can pour a foundation over you but if you're still loose about a lot of things he can't sit it down he cannot establish what he needs to establish in the church if it's that way now let's let's flip it back to the audience for a little bit and the patas vision brother said like this he said you know that's exactly what started the church in chaos at the beginning they had taken all the solinity from the audience and placed it in the Pulpit but God is the god of the audience amen he works in every human being he lives in every human heart he can get into amen he finds gifted people and works through them so neither Paul nor brother brandham was a oneman Ministry guy brother any of these preachers around this message or any of these people around the message no matter who they think they are that say that God is only a oneman Ministry If any man think himself spiritual or Prophet let him acknowledge what Paul said was the Commandment of the Lord and Paul never established for us that we are stuck in a oneman Ministry that's right God sent a oneman Ministry to this earth but that one man Ministry has given birth to many Ministries underneath it and I don't care how devilish or evil some of these men have Liv amen there is still a true five-fold Ministry there is still true pastors and apostles and Men of God that can tell us what the truth is that's right and they'll remain faithful in spite of their own selves thank God Hallelujah yes sir I said in spite of their own self they'll live Faith as many of these guys they don't want to do the job in the first place and in spite out of their own inadequacies God will still force them to the issue and set them out there as an example and a testimony glory to God Amen of what God's doing in this generation yes sir let anybody say what they want to about these men but God's the one that'll speak for his true fivefold Ministry Amen in the days of Anan of Safar will return told us those hours and those days and those times will come back and I believe with all of my heart that the church is fitly Con compacted together living in love operating by the love of God brotherly kindness and all the things that go with a Christian Life if a man or woman is operating and doing the way they need to do I believe with all of my heart that sin won't be able to stand in that congregation amen amen and that's what brother B prophesied to us would happen before we got ready to go out of here that sin couldn't stand to be in that congregation now let me read to you out of God keep his word but man said now look do you believe the Ephesian Church spoke in tongues certainly he said Do you believe they had signs and wonders yes sir but they knowed how to place them listen to this carefully their pastors knowed how to set them and put the church in order but the Corinthians didn't so it wasn't that the Corinthians were bad the really really bad bad bad bad bad ones and the Ephesians were the so much better ones you know that's about the way we qualifi churches around the ranks today uh certain certain church is the better church and that's the one that's got all the truth and God and the Holy Ghost moving in it and then that little bitty group Down Yonder in some little place in a holler and back in the woods and on and on you know that's just the other church it's amazing how we qualify right how deep and how rich is the grace of God in an area based on how worldly the church is how exposed and visible the group is or how well known their Pastor is woo y'all getting quiet on me but here we are right God doesn't discriminate he'll come to a little tiny group and he'll come to a big one right that's right you know in my years of serving the lord and preaching all these different types of venues and places that I've been in I've preached everywhere it looks like I was thinking the other day I think the only place I hadn't preached in was in a is in a restroom somewhere or another but then I got to think it one time amen amen we we was in a an out building like this amen and and and I needed a place to go back in and record a certain thing amen I'm standing right in the middle of this bathroom because the Acoustics were the best I thought I even preached in the bathroom amen amen amen and you know what I found I found this is what makes to me this is what makes Jesus so great yes in these great big churches with hundreds in front of you thousands in front of you at times I've found him to show up in immediate sized churches I found him to show up and in the little bitty churches when ain't hardly nobody around I Found Jesus to show up just the same that's what makes him so great to me he's not qualifying the effect of his presence based on whether or not the pastor is this and the people are that do they have an internet program and how many people come to their Church brother Jesse and how many that's right brother God don't care about stuff like that Hallelujah he's only looking for those that are willing to hear what's right and to express what's right now I love this but said in church order he said then after he told them talking about the Corinthians again like a father began to let the whip down on them I hear there's contentions among you and I hear that you get drunk at the Lord's table he didn't UNC christianize them and don't you Brethren do that un christianized them but it's the way they were behaving themselves in the house of God that's where it was at he said so it wasn't a matter of their experience it was a matter that they had all these puzzle pieces in front of them and they didn't know how to work them and the lacking of leadership in their life caused them to make very very poor choices but do you know how we know that God Loved These people and they were truly his children because every one of them got straightened out eventually cuz over a period of time this is only the book of Corinthians in rough dry form woo thank you Jesus amen all you're seeing is that Corinthian Church in rough dry form give God some time if we could have seen them 40 years down the road they might have been more spiritual than Ephesians were amen amen amen this is just the rough DFT side of these people God took all kinds of time I'm sure amen and and and selected how many men he'd send down to him and how many preachers would come how how many pastors would oversee that group to get him straightened out but we get him right in the very beginning raw uncut and all of their mess like he talked about Israel when he found Israel with her Naval uncut found in her blood given birth on the side of the road amen the umbilical cord and everything and Benta one more the blood and the water and all the the the mucking a m found Israel sitting right turn in that condition that's right that's a Corinthian Church but they were born they were Holy Ghost filled people they just didn't have any pastors to straighten them out you don't know what you don't know have I said that already yes sir let me say it again you don't know what you don't know you say well God's supposed to tell me he did but he didn't do it on their timeline or yours he chose to speak to them how he chose to speak to them and Paul went to visit this group and heard from the house of Khloe that there's a bunch of foolishness going on I imagine Paul got that little jewi stand her up a little bit and said well my God if that's the way these bunch of children are going to act I'm going to deal with them watch him when he comes in he starts talking about how they're going to behave themselves that mean angry hook noosed Jew brother B called him with that high temper well he laid the whip on him all right he spoke to him with such love and grace and talked to him as sheep and as children of God he didn't UNC christianize them he didn't throw them in hell he didn't tell them they were worthless and scum but he spoke to them starting with their experience of who they were and how God loved them and then he dealt with all of their problems like any true Minister will do you know what makes a church great when they are willing to let a preacher do that when a congregation is willing to let a preacher tell them the truth though it hurts him now you're working some with some real bride material right Hallelujah cuz until then you got nothing but a bunch of babies that ain't been born yet nearly you know just kind of halfway in halfway out bunch of kids You Preach to the gospel huh I'll give you to know my daddy's a pastor well your daddy is a pastor isn't he I give you to know I'm the Deacon's kid that's not born that's not Sons right Sons and Daughters they don't look at things like that when they hear that they've done wrong they grieve in their heart Lord I didn't realize getting drunk like that at the Lord's table was wrong you know Lord I've always drank wine like that and we always thought there was nothing wrong with it so I just grabbed it and turned it up I didn't mean to do that Lord I'm sorry and then as they found leaders to put the church in order everything was placed in its proper order now I like this in Romans chapter 13 let's let's let's turn there and go to verse one for a little bit now let me show you why this is beneficial preachers in the pull pit that are true God called man and there's a brother a few weeks ago that said something to me that I I never thought of just in this way but I like it he said brother Ben are all of these other ones out there true five-fold Ministry I said well yeah they're five full ministry preachers and things are gifted he said but do they perfect the bride and I thought wow now that's an excellent thought therefore not every preacher is necessarily A five-fold godall preacher for the bride some are just gifted to preach that doesn't mean they're gifted to bring us into Perfection amen that's why you should always be careful what you're listening to and guess what if you're giving yourself to reading exhortation and Doctrine they can't get very far when they start nonsense because you already know just a little secret I'll pass to you okay just tuck out in your pocket take it home with you now watch this verse 13 verse one chapter 13 let every soul did you get that every soul Deacon Souls Pastor Souls evangelist Souls housewife Souls farmer Souls let every Soul be subject under the higher powers for there's no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God I like this the word he uses here for subject is it's a military term meaning in Greek they would come by and say huso the soldiers would fall in line but the other side of this word huso in a non-military way it was used as a voluntary voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming responsibility and carrying a burden so every soul should have a voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming responsibility and carrying a burden we going to get in trouble already ain't we that goes for preachers too preachers are supposed to have an attitude of cooperation right well Hallelujah brother Bram gives us a great example of that when they were going to build the new Tabernacle he said because the Lord did not give him a vision about it he let the people go with their vote and build a new church brother man was against the church but why did he go with the people first of all the Lord did not give him a vision or dream or interpretation or speak to him or send the angel of the Lord to tell him not to do it so he had nothing spiritual to draw back on in any way whatsoever but he also was a Christian that had a voluntary attitude of cooperation his own words I saw the people wanted it frankly we needed it he said but frankly I was against it but because he had this spirit in him are you hearing me he was willing to cooperate with the needs of the people that's right I've seen so many so-called leaders the people genuinely need something different to happen happen in the church and that man with his foot his his his foot stuck in the mud singing I shall not be moved and to people suffering because he absolutely will not Bend or change or do different you tell me that man's a true leader according to this right here he's not obeying Romans chapter 13 verse1 I won't UNC christianize him but his behavior is wrong he's supposed to give his soul in subjection to a higher power and if the people are operating under the assumption that they have a voice then he's supposed to listen to some of the things they say now I'll give you credit pastors should be the kind of men to be able to make the final decision they ought to be able to have the final say a god-called pastor can change whatever he wants in a church and he don't need a vote for it no he don't need your permission for it neither if he's called of God to lead you and lead your soul he does whatever the Lord deals with him on he does it that's the end of it but there are times that sometimes leaders don't always get it right that's right yes sir you can say am man it ain't going to hurt nothing there's no message Mafia going to take you out when this service is over because you said amen against the preachers nobody's gonna put a hit out on you that's why we've got to be open to listen to what other people think and say you know what Pastor whoever maybe we do need something for the young people in this church maybe we do need to have Bible studies maybe we do need to do certain things have a singing or whatever it may be maybe the sisters do need to have a fellowship dinner or some other kind of thing I've seen men none my church and if you don't like it get another Pastor now that's not what Paul said a man's supposed to be he's supposed to have a Val voluntary attitude of cooperation well we go down to that church down there but you know we don't get along with them people down there and they don't get along with us and I we'll just stay up here and we'll be our own church we'll be safer that way we don't want to expose oursel to people who think differently from us I know that would be awful wouldn't it CU then you know what you become a bunch of narrow minded nitwits that don't know anything stuck in your own little world stuck in your own little mode but we ought to be willing to cooperate with those that are different from us amen praise the Lord sir now notice verse two whosoever therefore resisteth the power watch resist the order of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation what do you think it's going to look like at the white Throne judgment for all of these people around the message that refuse to send a five-fold ministry that's right this is what's going to happen to them right here they are they are receiving into their own bosom damnation of God God will judge them for their arrogant attitude against coming to church yes sir well I don't need to come to church nobody would miss me really so God LED you gave you the understanding revealed to you this is your pastor this is your church and so you just choose to kind of halfway come show up when you feel like it well I'll make decisions whether or not I want to go tonight I'm pretty tired ain't it amazing they get tired on church night but while they're at home they ain't too tired to do everything else they'll clean they'll cook they'll answer emails they'll finish projects they'll do all kinds of things they'll go outside and I'll do this thing and that thing and all kinds of other things and instead of having this desire I've labored all week in the word I've given tendance to study reading and exhortation and things and Doctor what more and I excited to see how God's going to help me put my puzzle together they just stay at home and don't work the puzzle at all three services become 10 10 become 20 before long you backslid and you stay out Soom and let me tell you something if you don't at least keep up on the internet and keep up on your services they've been recorded and what more amen and be able to figure out because I don't always get to be home I'm here I'm other places out preaching but we got an internet stream I can go back and listen to everything my pastor preaches and the other brothers preach and I can keep up on what's being said there because I don't know about you but I don't want to miss an opportunity to put a piece in that I didn't know how it went before Hallelujah we need these men because God ordained them to do the job they're doing amen and amen for rulers are not tear to good works but to evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have Praise of the same he is the Minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is a minister of God a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore you must needs be subject why Paul why not only for wrath's sake but for conscious sake the word he uses here for conscious in the original means having the ability to separate distinguish what is morally good and bad the soul distinguishing between what is morally good and bad so I don't just come to church just so that I can Escape hell and not be preached at thrown in hell for my bad behavior if I'm living wrong I expect to get it from the preacher as a matter of fact I told brother Jesse this morning this afternoon rather I said you know I used to feel bad about preaching the way I preach until I realized the reason I preach the way I do is you all I figured it out finally it took me 33 years but I figured it out finally by the grace of God that if people would live right I'd preach to them like they do but if they're not going to preach right I'll preach you like that too yes sir right so you want your pastor to preach High to you live high amen but if he comes out and goes you know what you've been doing through that week you haven't been studying haven't been giving yourself attendance of reading exitation and Doctrine how do you ever expect the word to take an upswing if you won't do it at home yourself but I also come to church so I can understand the difference between right and wrong cuz without a Ministry to tell me I don't really know yes sir oh now let's get into the debate how but the prophet can tell you that's true but the prophet didn't have the internet the prophet didn't have online pornography the prophet didn't have social media the prophet didn't have chat rooms and dating rooms and dating sites and he didn't have all of that in his time period and God needs some men that understand the modern trends of the day and how to deal with them appropriately rather than just push play and Obey God's got some men that are pushing play and obeying and some congregations that are pushing playing and obeying and he's got the Holy Spirit right there to take the message and modernize it for where they're living in that day and time amen what time period could you ever hear Brother bam talking about a vape they didn't have them but do you know how many of our message kids in the secret closets of the world are getting hooked on Vapes cuz they're being convinced that it's not smoking that it's not harmful sure there's a brother not too far amen from a a a church that I preached for out said to the pastor I dealt with a little bit that morning he said I wish brother Ben we go into that more about vaping and things it's a question amongst us young people but you're not going to find anything about it in the message of the hour directly that's right you can get a quote that parallels it but you know what some people need sometimes whether they like it or not they need somebody's little bony finger just pointing right at them and saying you you are the one you you right sometimes God needs some skin amen glory praise the Lord praise the Lord can't go little further now watch this a message called question answer brother said who has the great is Authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pull pit Hebrews chap 1:14 gives us the answer are they not all ministering Spirit sent forth the minister for them who shall be The Heirs of Salvation so the minister at the pull pit is greater than a than an angel in heaven and people bring the ministry down to the lowest class of the lowest class whenever through the gifts of God that God is using that's how the Lord gets the message across to the people about how to work their puzzle listen to this again Revelation book of symbols he said your pastor when he stands on this platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church a messenger to the church a pastor wait wait wait wait a minute brother Ben I thought only brother brandham was the messenger well the messenger said your pastor in the pull pit is a messenger not to the age but to the church he's a messenger to his own local body he said therefore a pastor should never leave that word he should stay straight with that word because he's feeding in the shepherd's place oh my think of that oh glory to God he's feeding in the shepherd's place in other words the food he's given isn't his own food he didn't get it because he had a superior Revelation because God give it to him the same way he give it to you but the gift is for me to get out of the way so God can use me to help you figure out what you need to do that's why many times I'm preaching I go Plum off these notes I ain't got no idea which way I'm going evidently somebody needs to help with a part of their puzzle I didn't know I had to work yes sir glory to God I love this statement spok word see brother man said you could only serve God and do and believe the servant and believe the servants that God sends and you can only serve God on Earth see as God's servants sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets a word to you so you can only serve God as the word is being interpreted to you false teachers produce false births true teachers produce true births why is it that the ministry is that important think of this statement if the blind lead the blind where do they wind up where the ditch leadership is so important that when it's bad it's it's real bad eternally separated from God bad but when it's good it's Rapture Ready Resurrection ready good amen amen good praise God Hallelujah in St John 12: 47 and 48 notice how Jesus speaks this if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I can't not to judge the world but to save it he that rejecteth me receives not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day Jesus says I'm not even the one judging you can you imagine that the Virgin born son of God declaring I am not even the one that judges you it's what I'm preaching it goes to prove that you don't receive your judgment based on who but more based on what because if he's preaching the word that didn't come from me I didn't originate that the spoken word is not Ben's Original Seed it's God's originaly amen amen right therefore if are doing your homework your 50% and my 50% come together and then God not being just a god of the pull pit but a god of the audience then as the word Goes Forth and you find your place and you get stronger and closer in Christ then nine spiritual gifts begin operating in the church why because it's not just the preacher that spoke supposed to be spiritual but it's the wife that's supposed to be spiritual too he's the spiritual husband you are the spiritual wife why in all of the things that we preach in this message why don't we see more gifted people in our churches you know why we cut God off right here and the only way God can move amongst many of our churches is if you leave your seat and come up to where God is I got news for you people dedicated or not we're not even talking about that this ain't nothing but a block of wood and this ain't nothing but a pile of carpet wooden nails that ain't there ain't nothing but a bunch of fabric and steel and whatever it might be that ain't nothing but a bunch of sheetrock and in one moment's Swoop a a wrecking ball could send this thing right down flat it is not because this is a pull pit or because that is a pew pew that makes God more here than God there what if I just come preach out in the congregation I guess God comes with me then don't it you see what kind of nonsense people get in their mind they think just because the man is here that God can't be out there at the same time last I checked the Holy Spirit has the ability to be anywhere he wants to be like I said one time because God is omnicient and and omnipotent all the things but you can't put God in a box he don't dwell just in one certain place or everywhere at a time God goes where he wants to go amen appears where he wants to appear that's right and he promised where two and three are gathered I'll be right there in the midst right so why do I want to come to church because while I'm sitting in the house of God if I'm doing my 50% the preacher comes out of the office he sets up on his platform and he starts launching into the preaching of the word you do your your part and I do my part it's like hand and glove It just fits together perfectly not only ises it clean the church position the church and straighten people out get them in a spot to where they know what's right but it produces a spiritual atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can move amongst that body and Gifts can fall into them amen let me tell you something that little group I worked with back in Manchester when I used to do Bible studies brother Carol my pastor my old Pastor one before he retired he approved and sanctioned me doing them Bible studies on Monday night and listen he was an old man back then and he told me I'm not going to that church every Monday night I'm tired I get done preaching on Sunday I'm War slap out I want you to go teach them people I want you to teach them in my church I said fine eight years we went through every subject I buy them the books spoken R seed Christ is the mystery Daniel 70 weeks adoption the Holy Ghost series Church age book we went through all of it I set him down on Monday night we go two hours we got to a certain place where all of that teaching was beginning to really move amongst that little 50 sitting in that group then I started teaching on the gifts and showing how the gifts operate their proper place and how they operate you know what happened we come to the end of the service and I'd have somebody bow their head and pray to close out the service the Holy Ghost would fall in that little group and a spirit of God would come down people start crying somebody would start singing we'd start worshiping the Lord together and it wouldn't be a moment's time somebody would speak in tongues interpret and prophesy the very last meeting we had a sister spoke in tongues and interpreted her tongues and it became prophecy she told us exactly what they were going to do and how the the critics and the people that was trying to shut us down how they were going to do it and that they were on their way to do it it was going to happen to prepare oursel is going to happen within two weeks time they' done exactly what the sister prophesied to us not a one in that Bible study was shocked when it happened we had unheard the Lord tell us it was going to happen we'd watch God speak things and do things right amongst that little body sitting there like that I'd say now you we've been talking about these gifts for seven weeks now you with the gift of faith lay your hand on somebody next to you in that Bible study they'd lay their hands on one another and we would get reports and testimonies of people being healed sitting right there in those congregation I never laid my hand on them because we come to the Revelation that God is not just a god of the pull pit but he's a god of the audience as well somebody say amen that's the desire of the Holy Ghost is for you to find your place and let all things be done decently and in order if you give yourself to reading exhortation and Doctrine if you labor in the word of God you won't be deceived if you got the Holy Ghost so you don't have to worry about that you won't be misled if you're setting under the right Ministry and I believe you are I I say this as respectfully as I know how and I don't mean it to sound arrogant or facius or nothing like that I wouldn't align myself with these Smith boys if I didn't think they love God I wouldn't go help Cam and come my Jesse's way it's not not they think I'm better than anybody but I just mean it wouldn't do me any good to come by preach to people that being led in a completely different direction that'd be like me trying to book meetings out here in the Methodist Church it wouldn't work pastors got One Direction and the people have got another that's what I like about aligning myself and confederating myself with men that love the message in the Bible and love the people of God Amen then I know that every mile I spend on the road and every moment I take away it's all for the glory of God and it's not in vain Hallelujah but why do we come to church because that Ministry of God is there to compact us together and if we're doing our part when we come to church we'll be so fitly put together that Satan could put a razor blade between us that is the benefit of understanding the divine order of the church am why why do you pay your ties huh somebody say well I can't afford to pay ties you can't afford not to right brother there are so many things oh I guess I plagiarized that I didn't say that somebody else did but you can't say well I'm going to hold on to it I ain't giving it to that old preacher you might hand the monetary part of it over to a pastor but that ain't what you're paying to God what you're paying to God is the 10% of your loyalty to his truth when you hand over them little old bunch of balls in your pocket that they made into dollar bills that ain't got nothing to do with the Holy Ghost but when you pay your TI and your offerings you are testifying of the power of the Church of God that when little is much God is in it you know God could ask us to pay 90% instead of 10 imagine what kind of thing we'd have to be in our in our lives to pay 90% instead of 10 but you know God could let us live on 10% better than 90 and I'm convinced that we can live on the 90 better than we can the 10 God just asked you to give out of every dollar 10 cents but I know when you're in debt up to your eyeballs that's hard thing to do but I promise you as long as you refuse pay ties and offerings and do what you're supposed to do you're going to remain in debt you're remain in money problems all the days of your life and don't think it just affects your money it affects your walk with God too because the devour will come along and take your prayer life from you you've exposed yourself to him that old Locust that old Cricket he'll come by amen that that that that he he'll eat down your prayer life and your joy take everything away from you right and the Bible said you're living under a curse when you don't give him like you should now I don't believe brother Jesse is a dictator and no he didn't ask me to say such things but that's the beauty of being an evangelist I can preach on ties and go home smiling because I don't receive them but why do we do that think of that simple Act of just giving our 10% to God I understand you get in positions with money you know what I do sometimes sometimes I be preaching meetings and more be coming in when I can cash I can't get to the bank to cash them sometimes so I've got a little Excel file on my computer brother Jesse and I write in how much I write who it was and I put the offering in the in the in the tithe that I owe and I keep a little log of it whenever I get a chance to get over to the bank can get it all collected and man I go out there and I maybe some brother pay me a cash offer and I take that money and I I maybe I owe $300 in ties or whatever it is I take that money in sticket right in an envelope and I go walk up and I hand it to my pastor I've never in 21 years had to beg anybody to give me anything in any church I've preached in because I pay my tie and my offerings and it ain't going to start tonight and it ain't going to start in a year from now because I continue to pay my tithe and my offerings I got news for you it is an inflation proof plan but think about it why do we do it why the simple thing of giving tithes and offerings it's stupid in a way CU God need with it he owns a cattle on a thousand Hells you're testifying of your loyalty you're showing God I'm going to be faithful to what I'm doing all right let's take it a little further why come to church then well you know the service is always kind of slow and old brother Jesse he teaches sometimes and everybody's tired and we get quiet why you're at church why don't you make some noise maybe you being the noise maker would change the other ones in the noise makers praise the Lord right but a lot of times we reject the idea that we have any value in the house of God I know how people are well I'm just a little quiet person I I know I've said this to you before let allow me to just beare with me to repeat it again you could be the most backward person in the world and God still move on you to speak in tongues interpret prophesy in the church ages slow backward bashful juny Jackson Jun we' be out fishing he talk so slow I said juny let me finish it for you I can get it out quicker than you can but then to hear him rattling off this morning in tongue's interpretation it goes to prove God work against your own nature if you understand the value of coming to church amen your liquor fire your pool is needed to make this ministry work Jesse is not Jesse without you and the minute that you think that you don't have any value in this church at all if you'll put your part faithful I believe that the entire church paid tithes and offerings and showed up faithfully and did their 50% and done their homework and come to church faithful in a year's time you'd have such Revival happening in this place till you couldn't even hardly believe the changes it would make even from where you you are right now you don't need a big number of people to make big movements there's enough people in this place right here to go out and pick up a whole car and move it hello we could go out all of us and go pick up Jesse's van and move it to the other side of the parking lot we got enough people to do that because if we bore the load with one another we'd have the strength and the ability to move great things you don't need a great big pile of people in order to make something happen and God don't need millions and millions millions of dollars in a bank account someone other to make great things happen God knows how to bless you bless the church and bless you in every effort you make as long as you keep your eyes single and your focus on why you come here in the first place and there's a movement in the message and it's been here for many many years and it was said by one of our great leaders God never at any time time ever use the five-fold ministry to do anything all the generations that we've had of church ages there's been evangelists and teachers and pastors and Prophets Apostles and Men of God and churches and people all over the place doing things worshiping the Lord and singing songs and on and on and on and all of a sudden we get up here to the last day and now we hear amongst our own ranks don't even go to church your best at home push play and I got news for you I disagree with that but I also disagree with people staying home and clicking play on somebody's website or somebody's Church stream or somebody's El I don't agree with you staying home less than anybody else either you got a pastor you should support that Pastor that's the way God wants it and that is the benefit of coming to the house of God does this do this help you tonight amen stand with me will you let's close up come let's bow our heads together can we with the many voices in the land all we want to hear is the voice of the Lord Jesus so with your heads bowed tonight I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but in your heart you know you haven't been faithful to the things you need to be and you you you hear what I've been preaching to you and you know that you're just as guilty as you can be on some of these matters I I I don't want you to raise your hand up and make some kind of a show you already know in your heart what's right and what ain't but why don't you just tell the Lord while you're standing just repent say God I'm sorry forgive me Lord I've I've taken it too laxidasical I've been too slack on these things and Lord I want to be faithful to you I want to increase my attendance I want to increase my offerings and my tithings to the Lord I want to increase my contributions to the church there's nobody that's saying amen I'll be the one there's nobody praying for someone at the altar I'll pray with them whatever the little body needs I want to put my shoulder to the wheel and have a spirit of cooperation a voluntary Spirit of cooperation then maybe Lord Jesus maybe you'll help me just to get over whatever complex or fear I might have that I can find my place and stay in it Lord wherever that is that you would call me I want to be faithful to that just tell the Lord that in your heart and just say Lord I'm sorry forgive me forgive me for overlooking the important things of the Gospel now Lord there's so much in there what I've said tonight Lord Jesus there's no way I can break it all down but I've at least been able to scratch the surface enough to get a point across so forgive me Lord for the limitation of time that we have here tonight may you make up and redeem all the time that I didn't have tonight to be able to express this fully because truthfully Lord it took another two or three hours to break down some of these scriptures and things I've got up here to go into each little element of it it take a month almost to break it down lord and just my little shot here that I've got on this Sunday like this lord I can't take all the people's time but Lord whatever I've been able to get across to them multiplying magnify it fill in those gaps that I couldn't reach tonight Lord may your Holy Spirit move upon all of us to see The Importance of Being a body of Christ and members in particular help us Lord in all of our frailties give us strength in all things we commit this service and all that's been accomplished to thy hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen how many just wants to serve the Lord in a better way just wants to be a better Christian to take it upswing and go higher than where you've been before oh thank you Jesus we just raise our hands up to you Lord confessing L Lord I see my own life Lord areas I need to improve help me Jesus help me God help me to find myself at the feet of the right kind of Minister the right kind of preaching and the right kind of Fellowship help me Lord to be exposed to the right people that I can hear what's truth hallelujah and in the meantime I'll give attendance to reading exhortation and Doctrine as we commit these things to you father help us oh God in these commitments help us not to let them fall to the ground but give us strength to face that challenge tomorrow and the next day the next day the next day we love you so much Lord and we thank you for tonight's service what you've accomplished all day has been powerful wonderful overwhelming to see the very spirit of God do as you've done today it's been awesome Lord to see you at work thank you Father watch over just protect us now in all things and guide us and lead us as you promised you would in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen God bless you but Jesse come take the service if you need prayer I'm happy to pray for you otherwise we love you appreciate you it's good seeing every one of you today and just keep praying for us all right we'll see you soon the Lord willing amen at some other time when God permits we sure enjoy being with You' all today did you enjoy my little wife singing man she does a great job so God bless you my friend come Pastor take the service bless you
