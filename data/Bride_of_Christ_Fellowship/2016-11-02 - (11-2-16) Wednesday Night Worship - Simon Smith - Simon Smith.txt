prayer and uh let's turn to uh John 11 by the grace of God two portions of of scripture just real simple thought I prayed on what to bring and he really didn't bring anything that I could identify and then uh on the way here he showed me maybe a different angle I things so John 11 verse 4 he says when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death he says but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now turn with me if you could to the Book of Job job 8 verse S he says though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increase for inquire he says I pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to search to search of their children for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon the Earth are a shadow so let say let just say a word of prayer asow ours dear Lord Jesus Lord we just loveely God lord we all come to you Lord humble Lord Lord this is uh we find ourselves Lord some out there I'm up here Lord God and not

down or rule over but to strength make them a mighty Army Lord as you prophesied in the Book of Joel Lord Jesus we love you Lord we're humble Lord Lord just have your way with us of our thoughts God you be in that God say the things you want to say still serice amen well we're kind of a little bit tired to keep us in prayer up at 4 4:00 this morning drove an hour and 45 minutes got to work uh worked eight hours 7 and a half drove another hour and a half hour and 45 minutes back H up got dress showered one God my wife drove here so we're we're pressing as hard as we can by the grace of God Amen I know everybody else is too but today I'd like tonight I'd like to talk maybe on uh a topic the power of the type it's a real simple thought um but I hope you'd be blessed by it praise God here in job 8 bildad I believe it was in job 81 he says something powerful to me there in verse 9 he says but we are yet he says but we are but of yesterday he's showing he said he said he I deare right now he says we're already passed he said this guy right here says already passed he says and we know nothing what no understanding of the word of God their lives were what he says he says and he says he says because our days upon this Earth are a shadow here the oldest book in the Old Testament Scholars say uh The Book of Job he says he says our lives he says right here he says they're already passed he says Shadows absolutely it was early in the message coming into this message and uh the message coming to me and To Us by the grace of God Amen or your pastor we always uh triy to write Bible studies up and witness and everything and one time brother Jesse brought this uh study and he shared it with me and I was able to copy it all down it was dealing with shadows and types in the Old Testament and in the news showing how the first prophet the first messenger of the church age book or sorry the church Ages was St Paul and how God used him he was a typologist yes he had no Bible he had the uh maybe the gospels rented down at that time I'm not sure maybe the the the the time of his ministry but he could he had the the Torah he could look in the Old Testament Scrolls and by prophetic vision and Revelation so much revelation that the devil had to uh God allowed Satan to put a a physical infirmity in him absolutely he he cried a couple times there for deliverance and God says he say my grace is sufficient amen but because of the amount of Revelation he was looking at the Old Testament and he pulled out all these shadows and types he called them shadows and types and I'd like to go through a couple of those uh by the grace of God but here let's turn first to Psalms 102 verse 11 notice how a lot of these Old Testaments are calling their lives he say he wor about just Shadows Psalms 10211 he says my days are like a shadow that declined he says and I weth like glass grass he says am I dying out absolutely he but his days are like a shadow absolutely and that's the same thing St Paul could look and say he says those are shadows of what we are absolutely amen and Psalms 144:3 he says the Lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest an account of him he says man is like to vanity he says his days are as a shadow that passes by absolutely yes they're they're just a shadow absolutely just look and examine their lives he says he says and and and we know from the New Testament teachings that today he said should be just like those days now continue on here Hebrews 8 1 through five it's it's uh Paul diving into the the high priest the priesthood in the Old Testament and he goes through and shows Christ on how he was the high priest absolutely there was a high priest in the old there's a high priest in the new absolutely there was Priest in the old he says there's what the fivefold and the new absolutely absolutely but now in verse five he says talking about Christ he who serve unto the example and the shadow of the Heavenly things absolutely as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle for see he saith thou make all things according to the pattern shown to thee in the mount absolutely what so all the old test everything he just shadows and types of what's already up there right sure right now in Colossians 216 he says let no man therefore judge you in meat or a drink or respect in holy day or of the new new moon or the Sabbath things he says which are a shadow of things to come he says but the body is of Christ absolutely amen all those things all those laws and Remnant things that are are trapped in those uh uh I cannot remember what anyhow all those the laws that were come up anyhow they come up he says but these are shadows and what types amen amen sure Hebrews uh 101 he says for the law having a shadow he says of good things to come he says and not the very image of things can never be with those sacrifices which are offered year by year contining to make the new com there uh make the comers there unto perfect he says he goes back he says there a shadow again everything that was done from Genesis to Malachi was shadows in tops amen absolutely now in looking at Jesus 64 the prophet said he says the the sick Look to Him talking about Jesus what they find he says they found a Healer he says the sick tonight can still look at him and find a Healer they found him and what was represented he says as the brass serpent he says it was that type he says this was the anti-type he said the grass serpent he says was the typ he says but Christ today the Healer 2,000 years ago he says he was the type then absolutely he says the blind could look and uh the blind looked and could see he says he is the same yesterday today and forever absolutely now what the the first church age messenger he was a a typologist and what the prophet say he says he I can only teach by shadows and types absolutely he was uneducated he did not he did not have a Pharisee a theologian upbring like Paul did Paul had to lay all his down and the prophet just come out of the work right in a in a little cabin with the the wind and the snow blow in it didn't know wasn't even raised as a Christian but a heathen absolutely to find out he was a Son of God he a a son of man absolutely right glory and St Paul was his shadow and TP right right absolutely now he says now here he says and today every church every individual that isn't he says that cannot display that token of the Holy Ghost is spiritually dying and will die he says wowow he says no matter how much you believe in the death burial and Resurrection look see that's as far as denominations will take you right he says no matter how much you can repeat the across Creed repeat it whatever you might do no matter how well you're educated what theological experience you've had he say you might have a doctor's degree a Bachelor of Arts whatever more he goes on to them letters ddld d Dr Latin whatever he says might be your literature he says that won't do it he says there must be a token display now look what he says he says it was only a shadow for the real thing for this day he says the anti-type right he says the token must be on display he says a Jew could furnish he was in the Covenant right he says but the token wasn't there he says the Covenant was of an any effect he says so is it today my brother and my sister showing what the importance what of having the Holy Ghost on you absolutely which is accept the blood sacrifice of the Old Testament Into The New Abs which is Jesus Christ dying on the cross the blood was released but within the blood was the secret which was what the life of the blood the Holy Ghost absolutely and that's what we're depending on is that power right that lied right in that blood absolutely any other man's blood would have done it AB that lie sure no one else P out that's right but Jesus Christ that out amen amen that's right now one of my favorite types I'll say like this of uh when I come to the message you know and through brother Craig and we did Bible studies and bible studies and and even now when I witnessed to I like this uh uh fellow brothers and sisters of Christ in denomination and i' like to just poke at their minds and hey man what's your favorite nugget in the scripture you know well you know and I I'd ask him what theirs is and I always got to share this one every time I witness to somebody I always got to tell them about this and I tell them about how I said I know what and i' asked the question I said why did Jesus have to be baptized by John the Baptist they're like maybe sit like this you we have our work clothes on they be thinking maybe put his hand up to his chin like this rub his little whiskers uh kind of look this way maybe that way and I said I'll tell you right now I said it goes back to the Old Testament and now they usually get all intent and listening and looking and I say in the Old Testament what the priest what he says from what the levitical line had to take the lamb the sacrificial lamb he say and had had to wash it he said to inspect it he and made sure it was clean and fit for sacrifice I said and that's what John the Baptist what had to had to baptized Jesus Christ absolutely because remember before he baptized he says he says behold there's the Lamb of God he invit he identified the lamb absolutely he says and he knew he was pure because when he came before him he said what he says I need to be baptized by you then he finally Jesus said talked it out with him a little bit and said you know what he says he says he says just suffer these things to be so he says he says just wash me for the sacrifice get on that absolutely and just like half a time like wow that was pretty good I said that's my f one of my favorite nuggets but that's sometime about as far as we go you nomination which is all right it's okay amen so now I want to go into a little type here my pastor um brother cam there has been dealing with the uh deal with the seals he went into the breach he's been dealing with the seals uh touched a little bit on the Thunders and you know little debate or however you want everybody's got their idea of the seven Thunders and going into those things but I I I don't want to probe at what there seven Mysteries revealed in the Seven Seals absolutely it's all revealed there but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel AB he said those seven Thunders were in there sure right right but I want to look at the type of it let's just look at the type and see exactly what what the what what a thunder is absolutely am I putting this my finger on and saying this is it I don't know but I want to at least look at the type of the Thunder amen sure now here in Matthew 179 this is the Mount Transfiguration Mountain they just went up and and and and and about the Eighth Day and and and after the sixth day they went up onto this mountain Shore they saw visions and uh things were revealed and uh the the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ was open right there actually you got the chance study study that had brother Jess go through it our pastor there but here in verse 9 of Matthew 17 he says and when they come down from the mountain Jesus Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead right he says and the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes he says that Elias must first come and Jesus notice the answer how Jesus brings this he says and Jesus answered and said to him he says Elias truly shall come first shall is a future tense he's pointing to the Future right he says and restore all things absolutely that's and now in our day it's already passed but in Jesus's day right then he says it's coming sure he says he says but I sayto you that Elias is already come he's looking back now right sure so he punch forward and then he points back right right he does that again in scripture one other time he does that uh as far as I know John 12 John 12 verse 23 and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come he said the son of man should be glorified he says verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die he says it abideth alone he says but if it die he says it bringeth forth much fruit amen showing what death is got is imminent it's got to happen absolutely so he can bring forth many Believers many sons and children of God absolutely he says he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hates life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life he says if any man serve me he says let me follow let him follow me he says where I am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me he says him my father will honor now look right here he says ow is my soul troubled he says and what shall I say father save me from this hour he says but for this hour I came unto he says but for but for this cause came I unto this hour and look he says this father glorify thy name amen he says glorify thy name now when Ty look he says he says then there came a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it he says he he points to God points to the back he says I've already glorified it and he says he says and I again he points this way and then he points that way right good amen sure he says you didn't know it I've already done it he's I'm gonna do it again right amen sure he says and the people therefore stood by and said that it thunder see a type A type Thunder type other said and an angel spake unto him he says Jesus answered he said this voice came not because of me he says but for your sakes absolutely so the voice came he says I've he says I've already glorified it he says I'm gonna glorify it again amen right sure now where did the first glorification take place in scripture he says he it's already been done that' be John 11 John 11:1 he's now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary he says and her sister Martha he says it was that Mary was which anointed Jesus with O and wiped his feet unto his hair with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore her sisters said unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick and when Jesus heard that he says the sickness is not unto death now remember think tight think tight right here he says this sickness is not unto death he says but for the glory of God he says that the Son of God might be glorified thereby this right here portion of scripture right here the Thunder revealed he says I've already done amen amen absolutely and in verse 11 he says these things sayith he after he said unto him our friend Lazarus sleepeth he says but I go that I may awake him out of his out of sleep amen all right absolutely tight sure he are ti now and you'll see why way we go this way of course we always go to that quote go away Jesus 63 sickest body that I know of tonight is the so-called body of Jesus Christ Lazarus caught sick something infected his body and it started sucking the very life out of him and over a matter of days he was gone he perished and he was in his grave four days corruption had set in after 72 hours he says the prophet said in that kind of a heat that desert heat he says his nose is probably already sunken his face stting to worms he says it needs spiritual healing there's only one bomb off that we need that will heal he says and that's the work when Jesus came up to Lazarus did he preach just the most finest sermon he could preach saints of God what he did was bring thus sayith the Lord amen he was totally LED of the father a yielded body right there a yielded body to every what whim of the Holy Ghost to every whim of the father sure and at that time what he just had to speak the word absolutely cast out what that devil right because remember what actually inflicted at first it was the devil right right right absolutely he had what Jesus Christ had what he was he had power with God because he was God in flesh amen amen absolutely when I first come into this message I was so excited because What doctrine because of Revelation because of understanding the Bible in a way that I know 99% of the people in the world would never ever see it right I was so stirred up and uh uh we come out of Pentecost SE sign wonders and miracles and I was working in Butler Indiana one day and uh Came Upon A man he was a welder just like me just a different form of welding and I started witnessing to him and I told him about service he I told him about godhead told him about baptism this and that and he was a little impressed but then he started telling me about his his missionary friends in Africa he says he says they raised the Dead all the time he says he says it's common place over there he said they have they're packing the Holy Ghost J says he says and they raised the dead they healed the sick Everything Jesus did they do as well right but here is me all I have is what the all I have is the revealed word of God right but he was blinded because of what signs wonders and miracles anointed ones at the end times we're doing the exact same works of Christ he said but within they're sick absolutely sick with that what that's what that what which is what man-made Creed right absolutely spiritual death false word yes sure right a man right now uh working with a precious brother there year and a half ago he told me about his his wife's having some issues physical issues I said I said brother he's I'm going to pray on this it wasn't even a couple days later his wife got a clean bill of health it stirred him up so much he told our boss and I was on the phone talking to another brother and he was saying Brother s we don't need all this and we don't need all that and then my boss phone call comes through I said hold on a second I held my personal phone right here and I picked up my work phone right here so he could hear you know just I said what's up boss he's like hey I heard about your prayer oh you did he goes yeah he goes good job good job I said God answers prayer doesn't he he goes yes he does yes he does he said all right I'll let you go bye I said did you hear that went back to my other phone I said did you hear that he said I said that's why this stuff is so important because we have to express Jesus Christ right now amen amen amen and then he didn't give me a problem after that now just recently a month later that same man's wife had the same issues you know what he did you know you know what he told me nothing this man still kind of lives like the world he took up Faith by himself and said Simon I prayed over my he said I took her back to the doctor he says and those little tumors he said they're shrinking he says and they don't know why they're doing it still talks like the world Saints but he understands the power of God absolutely he understands what the power of prayer he had a dream one time and the God showed him how to pray he said Simon he says God show me he said to get on his my knees he said and hold my hands like I said brother did you hold your hands he go absolutely absolutely praise God the power of the Holy Ghost absolutely denomination still packing power but it's power in the name of Jesus Christ right now here in the third seal he says now that's what the reason today that the revivals that we're supposed to have he says we have denominated we have have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no sir he says don't think we got revivals we haven't even down south there denomination he says he says oh they got millions and millions in church members J say but no Revival nowhere not true word Revival he says the bride hasn't had the Revival yet he says there's no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yes see we're looking for he says he'll take those seven unknown Thunders there to wake her up again he will send it he promised now watch he says she was dead talking of what he's looking back at the types he said the bride was dead church was dead he says now the church now if the churches would forget their Creeds he says forget their dogmas and just take the Bible not a message book The Bible he says plead the promise that it would come to effect to them but see Jesus said with your Traditions make the word of God not affect to you he says well that's the same thing today with spiritually he says see the spiritual bride of today the so-called Church she takes the word of God he says and she won't accept it she accepts Creed and dogas instead he says therefore the world he said the words not effective to her he he says because she tries to inject her Creed with the word and it won't work now he's dealing with this bride of this day now he was dealing with the denominations of there there wasn't too many come out at that time but at As Time moved on Revelations 18 is taking place come out of my people be not partakers of our sins correct amen now here's what I want to talk to right here here same sermon third seal yes he says they don't want it they don't want God's word how many battles have we've been into they don't want God's word they don't want the correct Doctrine laid forth they don't want Elijah to come and put that set put that wood back in order absolutely on the altar absolutely what so the fire of God can come down and seal them with the Holy Ghost right right amen that's what I had to do he said because she held her Traditions she kept the word of God from being she kept the word of God from being not effect he says now the same on spiritual Eve she don't want she wants to keep her to traditions and get away from the word of God she holds against to the denominations and their Creeds and traditions the traditions of her Elders instead of taking the word of God I'm there there's one quote in here so powerful he says that when the promise of the word in the last days is brought to her she will not receive it because with her Traditions he says like the Hebrew bride did he says the real word through manifested proven Vindicated she won't have it why won't she have it you know people don't want uh the gifts the N the nine spiritual gifts in the church why won't they want it right they're what to keep the church clean correct everything God's got for us we want it yes absolutely I want it whatever God's got for me we got to have it he says why won't she want these things because that's her type she can't do it that's right and he says he says she can't beat her type wowow and neither can [Laughter] you what was it brother 10 11 12 years ago your pastor my old Pastor right there come down to L he preach the sermon he says modern day Judas he's what he's preaching on them types of judases in this message hold on right the judases weren't in denomination no sir they come out they fulfill Revelations 18 they come out from among them where what church what was Judas the Pharisees sades scribes I don't know but he came and followed Jesus Christ right right modern day Judas and what they can't beat their Ty that's right amen right can't beat it see it it's predict she would do it how you going to keep from anything that's why we can look back to the Old Testament look to the New Testament and if you read the scripture and identify yourself there he says that's your time every time you see Jesus Christ do something that's me every time a gentile Rises up Old Testament New Testament that's me because what that should be your type and you cannot be your type Hallelujah absolutely what is the power you say how could it be all things in the Old Testament took place in the new if God show it one time it's got to run all the way through just like s lines types cannot quiet mail they can hallelujah praise God man I I I found that quote and I've been chewing on it for months she can't be her time oh my remember spiritual leave you can't they can't beat their type he says now the only thing to do is to be happy you're in he says many will fail many will fall what the Forest Virgin they can't beat their type right s can't beat his Type L can't beat his typ Noah can't beat his type Forest Virgin right right he says they can't do it he said but those who know who they are he says the only thing you do he says be happy you're in receive this message absolutely that's me behold I said you absolutely because what you can't beat that he says that's all he says be ready for it all right God promised in the last days that he would manifest he says and would vindicate his word to her and still she wouldn't do it ah the power of a type yes absolutely now notice back to that first glorification Lazarus uh laying in the grave and Jesus comes up to Mary and Martha says he says he I am the resurrection and the life actually to Martha I believe at that time and then it comes down to gaining faith and Martha never lost faith at all I even now or whatever you say sure right but look he says now Jesus was there he says with Mary and Martha he says take ye away the stone yes the prophet said she had to do something all these people in the message just sitting there letting just doing absolutely nothing just letting the time pass by uh uh not investing in the message uh uh not witnessing not trying to be a light among the people you have to do something because what the Tye was you had to do something absolutely you have to sacrifice you have to give your life you have to pay your ties you have to show up a church you have to pull on the word of God you have to be the word of God you have to be by the Holy Ghost you have to uh witness and absolutely just tear the devil's Kingdom up you have to uh Malachi or Mark 16 amen these signs shall follow them that believe Hallelujah I've had more things happen this year than almost my entire life that God supernaturally did am absolutely sure now he also says he says Where have you laid them down down he went to the Grave weeping like a man and when he got down there what did he say to do he says he says see he says you've got to do something to he says take away the stone he says take away the stone if you want to see a miracle amen what did that stone represent the Propet of that stone represented unbelief yes praise God how you gonna how you gonna move a mountain with unbelief you have to remove the unbelief away first and the mountain will move amen you want to see a miracle your life just go by Faith absolutely if you can bust into the Realms of of belief sure that's you get down in your prayer closet and really just break through to where anything can happen I know a man right now he is praying uh uh and he got so moved to the Holy Ghost he said he could have he said he believed he didn't do it he said I believ I could have Flo right down them stairs his faith was so high absolutely he said take away the stone of unbelief he says Watch What Happens just take away the stone he says and when he obeyed the word she obeyed the word of the Lord she saw a miracle sure amen amen he says oh God this morning roll away the stone of doubt he says takeen away he says and may He rise today in your heart and make you a new creature absolutely you ain't got the Holy Ghost just roll away that stone and say I got the Holy Ghost absolutely just get it just get it right there absolutely just believe it's for you that what you're a type of the bride all of you absolutely and you'll receive the Holy Ghost absolutely what not miss this Rapture Hallelujah than of God this thing this uh this thing's wrapping up it could go Hillary or Trump we got two prophecies 33 37 which one you want they'll both they'll both come into play We No Tuesday oh I'm so excited we're right at the end SS of God something's in me just uh uh it's kind of depressing but it's kind of it's a mixture of emotion absolutely I can imagine when a a woman goes into labor she's kind of ready for her to be over but she's scared about what's ahead right oh yeah absolutely that's what the the travailing in labor yes that's right now the second Glory John 13:31 he says therefore when he was gone out Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straight wi glorify him John 171 these words spake Jesus lifted his eyes to Heaven said father The Hours come glorify thy son and thy son shall also glorify thee so the voice thundered said I have glorified it and I'll glorify it again what was it both were what death burial Resurrection living again being seized by the devil life taking out dying then God giving the life back in rising up amen that's what that type Thunder type revealed both of them death burial Resurrection amen one thing I really like I was when I come on the message and sints of God you get such a real understanding of the things of God in this message you come down with a sickness it is one of the things revealed in this message every sickness every time Jesus healed somebody you cast out a devil right it's a spirit it's an evil spirit you come down with a little cold you get a little wooy whatever this and that an evil spirit is trying to enter to season 20 your organs to a ba cell and everything right and in demonology what the prophet comes and breaks it down amen a lot of my co-workers I explain this to them so they can understand it it doesn't it's very very simple if you have a mask if you have a a cancer a MK or a tumor whatever come up to that person I say like this he said anyone sick now what is that mass it's just a multiplication of dead cells correct just one cell just takes starts multiplying the wrong way and somehow a demon comes in there and is able to attach itself right to that cell and then it starts multiplying it exactly a back something that's not original and then what because what it's a life in there it has it's growing because it has a life right so I tell the people you come up with sick or your someone's got cancer whatever you go up and you lay your hands on them by the grace of God and all you have to do I say is cast the life or the demon out of cancer or tumor that demon right there is commanded to go it's got to go and now all this left is that mass right there of living tissue of of cells and just how the prophet explained it he says he always told people said now you may get sick before you get better because what the life is gone now that body's there and it's going to blow because it's dying but then it'll start the blood will start and through and it's heal itself and now you'll be healed absolutely right amen it's a healing it's a casting out of a spirit right that's how that's how simple the healing is yes you just have to cast The Demon out right remember that's natural yes sure now when the prophet first met that me that angel there he says I knew that same voice that spoke to me all along he say that the first time I've ever seen it like that he says but I know that voice voice he said fear not I am set from the presence of the almighty God to tell you that peculiar birth and peculiar life been always misunderstood with men said your peculiar life he say your peculiar Birth has been indicated that you you uh you're to take a gift of Divine Healing to the peop of the world and what he say he says sir I'm I'm uneducated he says I cannot go he says I'll be with you he say sir I'm uneducated he say like can I go he said the people wouldn't believe me he said as the prophet Moses was given two signs he says you'll be given two signs said first that you'll be able to detect diseases by your hands taking the patient by the right hand and if you'll be sincere and pray get them to believe and be sincere when you pray nothing shall be stand before your prayer not even cancer amen right that was the word of the Lord to a prophet and he took that promise and he ran with it amen amen I thank God he did so I started thinking about cancer I typed in little Google how many stages are there in cancer four stages in cancer wow four not three not two not 10 four four and it said this now get look at look at the Spirit behind everything he says numbering stages use the tnm I'm not sure system to divide cancers into stages now look most types of cancers have four stages numbered from 1 to 4 often doctors will write down the stage in Roman [Laughter] numerals is that Roman influence absolutely Roman system abolutely start with Roan Ro he was bad but he was heal amazing how majority of doctors write cancer stages in Roman lower he says usually means that the cancer he say number one stage number one or Roman whatever he says usually means that a cancer is relatively small he says and contained within organ it started with starts with one person one part of the body one tiny little part of the body stage two usually means the cancer has not started to spread in the surrounding tissue he said but the tumor is larger than stage one the problem in the church somebody somebody the devil anoints one person in the church and now death what in the church has hit the Bible says a little leav leth the whole room right right a little Strife or contention or a root of bitterness however but stage two it's still just with that one person cool stage three usually means the cancer is larger it may have started to Sur to spread into surrounding tissues and there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes in that area so now it's move from one person to the next right right number four means the cancer is spread from where it started to another a body organ this is also secondary secondary or whatever cancer sure but a lot of times the cancer goes from organ to organ but especially to the Lim noes now why the limp nodes the primary function of all limp nodes is the production of lympocytes which help defend the body against microorganisms and against harmful foreign particles and de breeze to the bloodstream sounds like the nine spiritual gifts because let's say a cancer comes into this church oh my speaking in tongues interpretation should call it out absolutely the prophet was waiting for the day he says where the sins to be called out by the gifts of the Spirit amen an the fire right there see the lyp Noid the lipoid right there in Peter kept that church clean picked up the L just like that absolutely amen right sure here the prophet Awakening Jesus 63 he says talking in a group of doctors the other day he said he says I read your book on Divine Healing I said I guess you criticize he says no sir I admit that you're right he says he said thank you brother show and he said brother Brandon we have a record that when we tell a person that's got a malignancy or something going to kill him or an AER already ready to burst or Tu tuberculosis it depends on what attitude they take right amen if they get all tore up oh my goodness stage three he says they die right away it's all on your attitude right he says but if they take the attitude well dying is just part of living that's spiritual too he says it's all right he says when I die he says you know it almost retards the case it almost sends that cancer right in submission or whatever call it remission absolutely so it depends on the attitude absolutely somebody in the church Rises up has a bad attitude just love on them a little bit it might just it might just win them right back to Christ and get the church all me everybody happying I love brother amen and brother Benjamin and our sister over here and our sister over there and praise be to God you could be the limp the sights in this church keeping everything clean just full of joy and and happiness absolutely just giving you Revelations out as God giv them to you abely just singing songs of hymns and whatever just being Joy all about you keeping it clean absolutely prise God they'll be able to identify who's got it because they won't want to be around you right right on sure he says the metal attitude you take towards it will bring he says now the mind won't do it but if you get that attitude together with something got life in it like the Holy Ghost remember the four stages of cancer what was Joel one the Palmer worm the Locust the cany worm the caterpillar yes sir four stages of spiritual cancer MH Revelation 61 he says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of what he says a thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and what they see a white horse rider another one opens up a red horse rider a black horse rider and a pale horse rider yes sir stages of spiritual cancer what Satan had moved into it into the original true church and started indoctrinating them and getting a hold of the the like the the the the fivefold right there and using them to corrupt the entire system exactly yes sir absolutely remember the first first th that revealed what death burial Resurrection second death burial Resurrection why is this so important to the church ages the seals it's going to bring what a death burial Resurrection right absolutely but what we have four beasts to fight them for what living creatures are zooms absolutely Matthew Mark Luke and John what can defeat all these absolutely you know pinpoint of the Holy Ghost absolutely ser he says' but the Book of Revelation shows that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless oh my it exposes sating revealing his Works attempting destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word sure spiritual cancer entered in the church right there right and that Pale Horse Ral will continue on to ride out now the last type I want to deal with here just moving over to the side maybe a little parallel right here ending the end here mat I'm sorry Mark 4 yes in the same day when even was come he said unto them let us pass over unto the other side and they when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship he says and they were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat upon the ship so it was now full and he who Christ was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they wake him and said to master care us not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said un the sea peace be still and the wind ceased there was a great call the prophet preaches on this on awakening Jesus in 63 he says now brother gromer and brother here and many other he says about 15 years ago we come through this country he says and there was a Revival prophet's Ministry he said there was a Revival moment people wanted God people wanted to see Power of the Holy Ghost yes you listen to the prophets ear early sermons Faith he just gave his testimony in a couple other testimonies pull from a maybe a little passage here and that was it but what they wanted to see a real living God absolutely amen the angel was standing right here next to him and he and by the grace of God patient patient would be healed and made well amen that was a Revival he said for 15 years he says in my he says you know what we're doing today just talking about it he says the Revival is over it's been over a long time we're just living on the results of it waiting waiting because he's talking about as he lay in the ship there and the disciples were up rowing before the storm and they just had a mighty move of God the day before and he goes into how Peter was uh uh how he met Christ the first time and how he called him son of arjah and said I knew I knew it was in there then the little John says well when he did this and he did that he said I knew he was gone absolutely and all the disciples would take turns and giving their little testimonies and then the storm come they were what talking about the Revival that had already taken place and as they were talking about and focusing back a storm come up wind it's going to destroy the children of God right he says and now maybe he says uh he says all the disciples were doing the same thing rejoicing living on what he had they had seen done probably the day before he say the week before he say a year before they were testifying about it giving oh great testimony of it how about that as Jesus in their day was resting between revivals how do we know maybe he's resting now between revivals yeah right he puts that little question he maybe there's one up the road according to this type right absolutely and the prophet type this what his 15 the Rev have taken place was 15 years and he said maybe there's another one up the road he said if this is the type of that he says we got another one coming amen glory yeah he says yeah I said yeah absolutely he says all you say he now wait a minute brother Brandon getting a little over the line now Jesus don't have to rest he said yes he did he said God made the heavens and the Earth in six days and the seventh he rested see he needed that absolutely but remember after the seventh day he began working again certainly he did he rested Jesus was tired laying on the boat he was asleep and resting and maybe after the toil of the Revival that's just passed maybe he's resting like like he was then he says I hope that's it right and so do I I believe we got something coming amen amen now he says this real powerful thing I'm I I really believe God's going to move he has been moving tremendously in my life this year absolutely amen I've got so many testimonies not saying anything but I'm giving God the glory I know he can do more absolutely amen but for a couple years before that was a little drier didn't see as much Supernatural didn't see this and that but remember when a storm hits when I drilled my own eye when that man was down in the concrete dying we prayed over them sure I hit myself right in the forehead with a gas regulator God kept me of all that he says oh Lord the simple little thought he says awaken Jesus Lord we have not so used his spirit and his faith so long till it merely goes to sleep talking about everything this and this and this if we can if we focus on the past if we focus on the Miracles or the things that were done in the past what about today right what have you done today who have you prayed over today who have you witnessed today and if you continue to look at your paast and not dwell with the spirit be love the spirit he says he merely goes to sleep on you right he merely goes to sleep on you when you get into any situation no matter how tough call him on the scene and wake him up he will show up amen he will deliver you're witness God we all got testimonies and he can do it again and he'll do it again absolutely sure it was he says as it was in our souls he says let us Shake ourselves tonight let us arouse ourselves and get our own sleepiness away from us so we can see that he's still in the boat now saints of God were seeing all these prophecies this nation is in such a turmo right now it's unparalleled probably since what the Civil War Revolutionary War we're at that time again a storm is coming Saints right because what the type says there is nazarus had to face death at on Jesus Christ when his storm came he had to stand before councel after counsel after counsel then he had to face himself right that's our types and if we're the final anti-type what do we do we can't beat our types right right that's right so look so what we we are promised in this day of body change amen we are promising this day a Deliverance Christ said if we stick with his word of God he said will not even taste that right because what our type is what Enoch our type are the three Hebrew boys in the fire absolutely no three absolutely right those three and the fourth one was what like unto the son of man that's right the fourth horse rider was like unto death sure right there bringing death but the son of man was right amongst us amen Enoch called a body change Elijah C what a char change absolutely call a chariot Rose it up these are our types they cannot fail when you see things in t turmoil the world is what gonna fall apart politically financially everything's going to fall apart that's types you cannot you can't beat it right remember in this day there is no military to rise up and fight on this Earth there is nothing the type for this day is total annihilation of the believer right but we we have the Rapture type and it cannot be beaten amen amen because Christ is is in you living in you he promised it and he will fulfill that type absolutely no one else was given it like this stage absolutely we have a we're in the most wickedest age and God delivers it on of us Glory Glory absolutely that is the power of our time am amen amen she cannot be beaten she can't beat her type see it's predicted she would do it so how are you going to keep keep from anything he says now the only thing to do is be happy that you are in now just the next chap or the next paragraph he says this now if you want to write them down of course you know them all Jesus John he's he's going to our types Jesus John he says Joel to Paul he says 2 Timothy 3 Malachi 4th chapter he says John the Revelator Revelations 10 he says going to our types he's pointing to our types he says see exactly what would take place now he says to the church what is it what is our type he says the Incarnate Word made flesh among his among his people again see he says they just won't believe so in this day our promise our type is What What In This flesh and in those flesh is the Incarnate Jesus Christ amen Christ Living what through his bride that cannot be beaten yes final scripture here Colossians 1 127 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory glorification past glorification this there's a glorification in this day Christ in you amen God in this flesh right here rising up taken taken by taken it by storm catch right out amen absolutely SS of God I hope it was a it's a simple study real real basic but showing you that what that first Thunder death barel Resurrection death barrial Resurrection second one yes and then the seals revealed what the Antichrist Spirit coming and killing the bride what does the spirit get in there it's death the first horse rider was what death because we live in the fourth and that was the name yes death had struck in that's right but she will live again exactly how she was remember Lazarus was dead four days and came back right Jesus was dead three there's your seven true Jesus right right sure remember at the end of that fourth one justification sanctification restoration of the gifts baptism of the Holy Ghost amen absolutely which what will produce thee Jesus Christ first first fourth CH fourth Church age did that look like the doctrine of of God was that the true light shining absolutely but then the light hit in Luther's day right light started shining finally right absolutely and they got brighter in Wesley uh Pentecost got brighter and now in this day the the light will be just like the S so amen absolutely it's got to shine seven times brighter absolutely Hallelujah and we'll shine just like the the so amen absolutely sints God I hope it's all right just a real simple teaching hope it's edifying hope you understand that these things are coming for us we have a great promises we have to believe that everything Christ did the Greater Works things we didn't even see are going to take place things we cannot imagine are going to take place absolutely but he said be so humble right just like we were here two Sundays ago and the brother preached on prayer that's the key right why you have to pray on your knees get your humble yes sir yes sir that's the best way to play pray neology you want to be you want to be a doctor be an neologist absolutely where up this is the time if there is one time right now to trim an right now is the time amen this thing is serious Absolut I don't care who gets elect but still this is this is

promis and reive the Holy Ghost God but Lord Jesus Lord we've got to conquer the entire land lord and Lord Jesus Lord we're looking for that final Escape God probably the most one of the most powerful types early in the scripture there God with Enoch Lord he walked with you Lord he walked so close God Lord one day he just kissed his wife goodbye and his children I said I got to go up a little bit higher he just walked up there Jacob's Ladder however with God he was no more but God took yes Lord Jesus that is our tight God Lord I don't believe any of us will see death God lord till till we see

Ram explained that Church age book he said that's the way it's going to come down right he said the tears must be bound first he said that's what's going on right now Amen brother R said that's what we went over and brother Ram said that's exactly what the churches do they'll unite against the bride and they'll have power over the politics and that'll bring pressure upon the bride he said brother Ram said pick up your pen and WR remember Revelation 13:16 he said I believe according to Revelation 13:16 he said that the Bride of Jesus Christ will be forced to stop preaching and ministering to those that that need the help from the Bride of Jesus Christ right so we've heard a lot we don't know exactly all that's going to happen we know one thing we can watch and pray amen are you willing to
