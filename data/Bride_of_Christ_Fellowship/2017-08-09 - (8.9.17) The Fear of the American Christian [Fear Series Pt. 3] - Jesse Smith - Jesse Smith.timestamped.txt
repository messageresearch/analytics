[23:32] my fault so forgive me about God's grace
[23:35] okay a few prayer requests here about
[23:38] the grace of God the pastor that Simon
[23:40] talked about in Thailand brother Basheer
[23:43] sent me a message today said just keep
[23:44] the Saints in prayer there are six of
[23:47] his adult family members and two
[23:48] children are in prison still and little
[23:51] update on that and Simon said it's going
[23:53] to take an absolute miracle for them to
[23:56] get out because there's their family
[23:58] made youtube videos talking about all
[24:00] the persecution Muslims are putting on
[24:03] Christians in Thailand and the
[24:04] government found out and so now they're
[24:07] really there we're not going to any of
[24:08] them out of prison for any amount of
[24:09] money that's what Esther went to the
[24:11] lawyers and that's what they said so
[24:13] it's a really bleak situation how many
[24:16] believe though God tears down and raises
[24:18] up let me know that he uproots and
[24:19] plants so let's ask God for mercy for
[24:24] this family brother Bashir I also told
[24:29] brother John we'll pray for his medical
[24:30] situation there and then also I told by
[24:33] the Dustin my brother-in-law will pray
[24:34] for him by the grace of God recovering

[24:40] praying for sister Karen Rolf her mom
[24:42] and the family she didn't have any

[24:45] for everybody so let's keep them in
[24:47] prayer by God's grace it's nice to see

[26:14] if you have any other questions or
[26:15] answers if you can get them into me

[40:58] in ways we cannot see he will make a way
[41:05] for me he will be my guide hold me
[41:12] closely to his side with love and
[41:18] strength for each new day he will make a
[41:23] way
[41:25] he will make a man let's take our Bibles
[41:32] tonight let's go to Luke 21 verse 23
[41:35] praise God all the saints pressing their
[41:40] way out to the house of God just
[41:42] trusting the Lord to speak to us here
[41:44] tonight Luke 21 verse 23 Luke 21 23 I'm
[41:55] going to continue the little series on
[41:56] fear I'm going to go back to the church
[41:58] ages Lord willing by God's grace but I'm
[42:00] just kind of feeling inspired to preach
[42:04] on fear a little more Luke 21 23 my
[42:08] title tonight is it though maybe you
[42:10] know interesting but it's called the
[42:12] fear of the American Christian the fear
[42:15] of the American Christian Luke 21 23
[42:18] praise God of course I got that title
[42:22] from a quote from brother branham's I'm
[42:24] not making up my own thoughts you know
[42:25] Luke 21 23 praise God but woe unto them
[42:34] that are with child and to them that
[42:36] give suck in those days for there shall
[42:38] be great distress in the land and wrath
[42:40] upon this people now that's speaking of
[42:43] Titus's coming in AD 70 if you're
[42:46] familiar with that so he's speaking to
[42:48] his disciples the destruction of
[42:50] Jerusalem is being foretold now verse 24
[42:53] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[42:55] sword and shall be led away captive into
[42:56] all nations right now they're coming
[42:59] back and Jerusalem shall be trodden down
[43:02] of the Gentiles until the times of the
[43:04] Gentiles I mean oh we're still the times
[43:08] of the Gentiles so see we're in this
[43:10] scripture a little bit but he's dealing
[43:12] with Israel but verse 25 we're actually
[43:16] gonna talk about verse 26 but let's read
[43:17] 25 and there should be signs in the Sun
[43:19] and the moon and in the Stars and upon
[43:21] the earth distress of Nations with
[43:23] perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
[43:26] verse 26 men's hearts failing them for
[43:31] fear
[43:32] that's kinda what we're gonna look at
[43:33] tonight and deal with that's how that's
[43:34] in the times of the Gentiles of course
[43:37] it's the whole world but it's
[43:39] specially the times the Gentiles and for
[43:41] looking after those things which are
[43:42] coming on earth for the powers of heaven
[43:45] shall be shaken and then shall they see
[43:49] the Son of man coming in a cloud with
[43:51] power and great glory that will be at
[43:53] the end of the Tribulation Period when
[43:56] they see Christ coming in a cloud member
[43:57] Jesus told the Pharisees oh so you'll
[43:59] see me coming in a cloud a cloud of
[44:00] glory now verse 28 and when these things
[44:04] begin to come to pass then look up and
[44:05] lift up your heads for your Redemption
[44:08] draweth nigh that's speaking to the
[44:10] 144,000 right Christ comes back bro
[44:14] Graham said then he destroys the armies
[44:15] we preach on that in the Book of Daniel
[44:17] remember that he destroys the Rome and
[44:19] all the armies trying to destroy Israel
[44:20] then he reveals himself to Israel but we
[44:24] want to look at men's hearts failing
[44:25] them for fear it's speaking of all the
[44:28] men's hearts during the times of the
[44:30] Gentiles and of course in the
[44:32] tribulation we want to look at the fear
[44:35] of the American Christian tonight how
[44:36] many American Christians we got in here
[44:38] so we all need God's grace amen

[45:41] fear of the American Christian and I'm
[45:42] gonna set a timer here so I don't go too
[45:45] long on Wednesday night I want to be
[45:48] real careful to be just watchful of time
[45:51] you know our society is so busy I mean
[45:55] Oh America's so busy
[45:56] we're so and we just have to be you know
[45:59] work schedules and everything it's so
[46:01] busy so I want to be mindful of the time
[46:05] so we started in Luke 21 and we saw how
[46:09] Jesus was speaking to the Jews saying
[46:12] there's gonna come a tight us and he's
[46:15] gonna worry he's gonna divide Israel
[46:17] scattered all nations and Jerusalem be
[46:20] trodden down until the times of the
[46:22] Gentiles are finished
[46:23] and they said men's hearts failing them
[46:26] for fear speaking of this end times but
[46:30] then he said when you see the Son of man
[46:32] coming he said lift up your heads for
[46:34] your Redemption draweth 9 in other words
[46:36] he's going to redeem the 144,000 but how
[46:39] many know that our heads should be
[46:41] lifted up right now because our
[46:43] redemption is right now amen the Bible
[46:45] said today's the day of salvation
[46:47] today's the day of deliverance for the
[46:49] Christian amen so we're grateful for
[46:51] God's mercy grateful for a season you
[46:54] know I was talking with brother Simon
[46:56] and he was sharing our brother cam was
[46:57] preaching on the church ages a few years
[46:58] ago and he took the thought from the
[47:00] Thyer tear in church age about Jezebel
[47:03] how God gave her a space to repent I
[47:05] remember that and brother cam had a
[47:07] great thought and I just was and I was
[47:09] praying on my knees yesterday just
[47:10] crying thanking God thinking about this
[47:12] thought God told the church age I'm
[47:15] gonna give you space to repent and I
[47:17] remember how long that church age was
[47:18] almost 900 years and I was just weeping
[47:22] yesterday worshiping how God is so
[47:25] merciful he gave the Roman Catholic
[47:27] Jezebel run Church almost 900 years to
[47:31] repent how many believe in God's mercy
[47:34] today you know we think Oh God's done
[47:36] with me or you know guys had enough of
[47:37] me God is rich in mercy Church and if he
[47:41] gave a woman Jezebel a Jezebel
[47:44] he gave the Jezebel system 900 years to
[47:46] repent and that thyroids here in church
[47:47] age if
[47:48] he gave them 900 years how about that
[47:50] how about the Gentile Church age how
[47:53] about you and I who love Him who are not
[47:55] according creeds and dogmas we just get
[47:57] mind battles and we just get discouraged
[47:59] from time to time how much more is God's
[48:01] mercy for you and I Amen we're not
[48:04] worshiping a pope or we're not you know
[48:05] worshiping a creed or something like
[48:07] that we're just trying to serve God and
[48:09] we go through our battles like we all do
[48:11] and it just made me weep and I'm
[48:12] rejoicing praising God great is your
[48:15] mercy great is your faithfulness thank
[48:17] God His mercy is new every morning amen
[48:19] hallelujah joy I mean no joy comes in
[48:22] the morning amen
[48:23] we have a rough night sorrow comes the
[48:26] night but joy comes in the morning
[48:28] hallelujah that's exactly right great is
[48:31] his faithfulness
[48:32] now just to review member brother Ram
[48:35] said Jesus always said fear not he
[48:39] constantly told people don't fear fear
[48:42] now Sunday we're looking at Joshua I'm
[48:43] gonna tell them I already got my message
[48:45] ready for Sunday so I already know I'm
[48:46] gonna preach it's gonna be Joshua fear
[48:49] not so you like that I think you'll like
[48:51] it
[48:51] we're gonna type out the invasion of the
[48:54] promised land I think you're really
[48:55] gonna like it I at least I am so you can
[48:59] you can't rejoice over it and just
[49:01] rejoice because I'm gonna enjoy it by
[49:03] God's grace I'm gonna type the hittites
[49:05] and the perizzites and the jebusites
[49:07] we're a type that all the Canaanites and
[49:09] see what that stands for because guess
[49:11] what you and I are than the Joshua army
[49:13] today how many know that we're the Josh
[49:16] army and we've got to drive out the
[49:18] inhabitants in this land amen but jesus
[49:22] said always said fear not but man said
[49:26] do not fear don't fear don't do it if
[49:28] you do then God can't work with you but
[49:31] if you do believe then God can work with
[49:34] you how many want God to work with you
[49:35] you just have to believe you just have
[49:38] to cast out all fear and remember how we
[49:40] said it you have to repent and remember
[49:42] the goodness of God leads you to
[49:44] repentance so if you're all caught up
[49:46] and struggling like we all get - we all
[49:48] get down and go get the blues and we all
[49:49] get discouraged from time to time if
[49:52] you're down remember how much God loves
[49:54] you remember his goodness repent and
[49:57] that will make you full of love and use
[49:59] that love to cast out any more doubt aim
[50:02] and then the Bible says that love wants
[50:05] all fears gone
[50:06] that love will actually operate your
[50:08] faith because love faith operates by
[50:10] love according to Galatians 5:6 and then
[50:13] your faith can go into work hallelujah
[50:15] to have faith to confess God's Word and
[50:18] that's what we're gonna see about the
[50:19] american christian tonight brother
[50:21] Branham said everything is don't fear so
[50:24] everything in your life no matter what
[50:26] trouble you're in whether its financial
[50:27] relationship church problems whatever it
[50:32] is brother Anderson no matter what the
[50:33] situation is in every situation you must
[50:36] not fear aim everything is don't fear
[50:39] about death don't fear about sickness
[50:41] don't fear about money don't fear about
[50:43] all these things have faith in God amen
[50:46] everything is don't fear he says the
[50:49] greatest thing I've ever found among
[50:52] Christian people throughout the world
[50:53] has been fear they're always afraid a
[50:56] little sickness strikes they're afraid
[50:58] now I'm going another quote one of the
[51:00] greatest curses of the church today is
[51:02] fear everybody's scared to death what's
[51:05] going to happen who what why jesus said
[51:08] when you see fearful signs lift up your
[51:10] head for redemption draws nigh you know
[51:14] this week I was I drove brother Sampson
[51:16] yesterday uh to Lima and then drove back
[51:19] last night and we were stopped at the
[51:21] McDonald's and all over the news was
[51:22] just ah how it's gonna be nuclear war
[51:25] pretty soon as you know North Korea has
[51:28] bombs and I guess our presidents talking
[51:30] big talk or something like that
[51:31] well charge we don't know the future but
[51:34] we know one thing the Bible said they're
[51:35] gonna be saying peace and safety peace
[51:37] and safety then come a sudden
[51:39] destruction we don't know how many wars
[51:41] we don't know all these things but we
[51:43] must not let this news get to us we must
[51:46] stand on the Word of God brother Branham
[51:49] lived in the days of the Cuban Missile
[51:50] Crisis remember that he lived throughout
[51:52] those days and they had those bomb
[51:55] shelters
[51:57] my wife's grandparents have that shelter
[52:00] that basement where you open up the
[52:01] doors and when I was little my
[52:03] grandparents said you an outside way to
[52:06] get down in the basement case there was
[52:07] a bomb I forget what those are called
[52:09] but sellers you know get in the cellar
[52:11] really fast and in his day it was a
[52:13] great a great stress but brother Adam
[52:16] would always say
[52:16] just type in the wings of Jehovah and
[52:18] the message and you'll find it brother
[52:20] Ram would say we're not to worry about
[52:21] you know getting under concrete or or
[52:23] getting under the ground
[52:24] he said all we have to do is get under
[52:26] the mighty wings of Jehovah eagle amen
[52:28] he said and we'll find our rest right
[52:30] there how many one arrest under the
[52:32] wings of Jehovah men I imagine you get
[52:35] nice and warm by his love amen if he's
[52:37] if you're gathered in as his brood as
[52:40] his family praise God and if you feel
[52:43] far from Christ well then get a little
[52:45] closer to him tonight because he's
[52:47] calling you to get closer amen
[52:48] hallelujah I got a quote and I don't
[52:53] have it in front of me but brother Adam
[52:55] said somebody had given a bomb threat to
[52:58] one of his meetings and he said we into
[53:00] the meeting he was actually preaching
[53:02] and there's a bomb threat and he said
[53:03] what do we have to be afraid of if the
[53:05] bomb goes off we'll be in the presence
[53:06] of God look at look at his perspective
[53:10] and Paul said remember to live I'm sorry
[53:14] to die is what gain Paul said in
[53:17] Philippians it's better for me if I die
[53:20] because I go right to the presence of
[53:22] God but what do you say it's better for
[53:24] you if I live so what did God let him do
[53:27] God let him live right after riding the
[53:30] Philippian letter which we're gonna get
[53:31] to tonight but we're willing he wrote
[53:33] all kinds of other letters and still
[53:34] traveled and did other things but Paul
[53:36] said it's actually better for me if I
[53:38] die but it's better for you if I live oh
[53:40] my that should be our attitude right
[53:43] that no matter what happens we're
[53:45] trusting in God and if something would
[53:47] happen we'll be in the presence of God
[53:48] amen a matter of five minutes amen
[53:50] hallelujah again he says the greatest
[53:55] thing I find against the church and I is
[53:57] fear everybody's scared to death about
[54:00] something he said what are you scared
[54:02] about if a man's born again he should be
[54:04] happy carefree just like those fellows
[54:08] singing specials up here and the brother
[54:10] testifying back there just free there
[54:13] ain't nothing that can harm you nothing
[54:15] present nothing future nothing can
[54:17] separate us from the love of God that's
[54:19] in Christ Jesus
[54:20] God has promised amen hallelujah
[54:24] remember these now here's the quote I
[54:26] got my title from this is from the
[54:28] infallible proof
[54:29] the resurrection in 1997 now brother
[54:34] randoms
[54:35] he's laying a foundation how in the
[54:37] beginning was the word the Word was with
[54:38] God and the Word was God
[54:41] and program said when God spoke that
[54:43] word let there be light he said we don't
[54:45] know how many years it was but at some
[54:47] point there formed a little light called
[54:49] the logos right the pillar of fire
[54:50] another way we could call it a theophany
[54:52] you know something like that
[54:54] he said God's Word is just as good as he
[54:57] is his word is just as eternal as he is
[55:02] how many could say amen to that
[55:03] and then he talks about how God slain
[55:07] Jesus in his mind before the foundation
[55:10] or which is scriptural the Bible said
[55:11] the lamb was slain from the foundation
[55:13] of the world and he said that was just
[55:16] as real in the mind of God as it was on
[55:18] Calvary 2,000 years ago that word that
[55:22] promise was just as eternal and bro
[55:25] Graham says this he said he was slain
[55:27] back there before the foundation roll
[55:29] and God for saw and knew what he would
[55:31] do and he spoke the word it was finished
[55:33] back there in his mind and brother
[55:36] Branham said let me give you a little
[55:38] courage how many want a little courage
[55:39] tonight I could use something oh I'm
[55:43] gonna be a little stronger don't you he
[55:46] said let me give you a little courage
[55:47] which I find amongst the American
[55:50] Christians is that great lack he said is
[55:55] fear so Christians are and we said
[55:58] American Christians in 1961 four years
[56:02] before he goes off the earth the great
[56:04] lack amongst Christians is a lack of
[56:06] faith and it's a presence of fear that's
[56:10] that what you want me to keep preaching
[56:11] or it can we be done right there would
[56:14] you like to hear more yeah I thought
[56:16] mine that struck me American Christians
[56:18] after traveling the world these times
[56:20] American Christians their great battle
[56:23] is fear the American Christian seems to
[56:28] be afraid that God won't keep his word
[56:33] mine
[56:34] and of
[56:37] afraid if you just don't squeeze or hold
[56:40] on to something so he said you got Chris
[56:42] American Christians always got to have
[56:43] something to hold on to
[56:45] like which there's nothing wrong with it
[56:46] but like let's just say a prayer cloth
[56:48] or hold on to a Bible or hold on to you
[56:50] know I always got to have something
[56:52] that's what he notices now he tries it
[56:56] Kirsten here's the word of encouragement
[56:58] he said it's nothing that you could do
[57:01] in the beginning it's what God has done
[57:04] how many know Americans are taught from
[57:06] a young age you got to do something you
[57:08] got to work hard it's on you you're
[57:10] responsible how many how many how many
[57:11] raise that way
[57:12] I was always raised that way fifth grade
[57:14] I had a paper out Jesse go on your own
[57:16] money he want these baseball cards you
[57:18] wanted a new cleats for baseball season
[57:19] you go work for it it's always on us
[57:22] right sir always like well I've got to
[57:23] do something I've got to do something
[57:25] mother ham tries to remind us though and
[57:27] give us courage that with God it's
[57:30] nothing that you and I could do it was
[57:32] already in God's mind from the beginning
[57:34] it's what God has already done for us
[57:38] amen like a few Wednesday's ago I
[57:40] preached on the just shall live by faith
[57:42] that was that was life-changing for me I
[57:45] don't know if it was for you but it was
[57:47] for me since then I've just been so
[57:50] carefree about my salvation it was such
[57:52] a delivering time for me because Mel
[57:54] Bram said we have nothing to do with it
[57:57] it's not nothing but the blood of Jesus
[57:59] and my own good conduct we don't think
[58:02] that it's nothing but the blood of Jesus
[58:04] and all the all the prayer and fasting I
[58:07] did write our salvation is Jesus only
[58:10] it's not Jesus plus something else
[58:13] it's Jesus only and then when we are
[58:15] filled with God's love for his great
[58:18] gift were freely justified God doesn't
[58:21] justifies because of what we done he
[58:24] justifies us because of what Christ done
[58:26] but if that's the right grammar pardon
[58:29] me I know my grammar is pretty awful but
[58:31] forgive me
[58:32] it's not what you have done it's what
[58:34] God has done my dad said you never saw
[58:36] God though you thought you did glory he
[58:42] says this lost my spot but the Bible
[58:46] claims you didn't know man seeks God his
[58:49] nature from the Garden of
[58:51] proves that he's a coward and runs when
[58:54] he sins how many can say amen to that
[58:56] when you sin what do what do you not
[58:59] usually do when we send you should we
[59:00] run away from God
[59:01] usually we run away from the word or
[59:03] away from the person we sinned against
[59:05] that proves were a failure to begin with
[59:09] amen I had somebody text me this week
[59:12] and not from this church anything like
[59:14] that and they said Jesse they said you
[59:17] know you live so close to God and you're
[59:19] they said you live such a high life we
[59:21] can I could never reach that point and I
[59:23] wrote back and said no I'm a failure to
[59:25] begin with because it's not what I can
[59:28] do it's what Christ already did for me
[59:31] so see that person is and I love them to
[59:33] death but they're exalting me way up
[59:35] here and they don't see they don't hang
[59:37] around me they don't live with me
[59:38] they don't come to church here I make
[59:41] mistakes
[59:42] uh-uh am i sanctified absolutely am I
[59:45] filled the Holy Ghost
[59:46] I believe with all my heart absolutely
[59:48] but they don't see my bad spots and I
[59:51] try to reassure them brother Branham
[59:53] said I'm always affair to begin with
[59:55] jesus said apart from me we can do
[59:58] nothing praise God let me know what
[1:00:00] we're talking about and when we said
[1:00:02] when I say when you said many times we
[1:00:04] don't run right to repent right away
[1:00:06] although we should sometimes we kind of
[1:00:08] linger to repent we don't we don't
[1:00:10] reckon fess right away we don't make
[1:00:12] that right right away I mean know what
[1:00:13] I'm talking about none of us are perfect
[1:00:16] so we've got to remember that that we
[1:00:18] often run away from God's presence when
[1:00:21] we ought to run to it praise God the
[1:00:25] program says this it wasn't Adam calling
[1:00:28] God it was God calling Adam it wasn't
[1:00:31] Jesse calling God it was God calling
[1:00:33] Jesse amen you put your name in there
[1:00:36] wasn't you calling god it was God
[1:00:38] calling you and I Amen what do we have
[1:00:40] to fear he says let me give you some
[1:00:42] courage you had nothing to do with it
[1:00:44] God's in control of your life amen
[1:00:47] so what am I trying to do today we're
[1:00:49] trying to look at the sovereignty of God
[1:00:50] yes I know last month I preached on good
[1:00:52] works that's looking at you know your
[1:00:54] personal decision and dying to yourself
[1:00:56] which Paul said I must keep my body and
[1:00:59] bring it under subjection right there's
[1:01:00] a there's a place for that but if we
[1:01:02] step back and look at the sovereignty of
[1:01:04] God
[1:01:05] the plan of God our lives are in his
[1:01:08] nail-scarred hand amen
[1:01:10] I told a family that today we're leaving
[1:01:11] Target and they said why you got a lot
[1:01:13] of children I said that's just the half
[1:01:14] of it I've got three at home I had three
[1:01:16] with master that's just half of it I got
[1:01:17] three at home they said my you got your
[1:01:19] hands full I said but all my life and
[1:01:22] all my children are in his nail-scarred
[1:01:24] hands and those women said glory I said
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:27] we could have a rejoicing session target
[1:01:30] Amen hallelujah because we're in his
[1:01:33] hands amen he's the one guiding he's the
[1:01:36] one calling he's the one teaching us
[1:01:38] he's the one encouraging us amen and
[1:01:42] brother BAM ends by saying this and the
[1:01:43] Bible says that you might rest assure
[1:01:46] that's me tonight I want to rest assure
[1:01:49] that your names are written on the
[1:01:52] Lamb's Book of Life those of you were in
[1:01:54] the body of Christ tonight was written a
[1:01:56] lands book of life before the foundation
[1:01:59] of the world church we hear that so
[1:02:01] often knowing we hear that so often that
[1:02:04] we forget how important that is for you
[1:02:07] and I how many can say Amen to the head
[1:02:09] we hear before the foundation world so
[1:02:11] much preachers before the foundation and
[1:02:12] if we're not careful we'll let that
[1:02:14] become common to us but we've got to
[1:02:17] keep that fresh don't you want to keep
[1:02:18] that fresh we cannot let God's Word
[1:02:20] become common and brother man this is my
[1:02:22] brother him says to give you courage you
[1:02:24] American Christians hallelujah that God
[1:02:28] chose you before the foundation world he
[1:02:31] called you so he's gonna keep taking
[1:02:33] care of you hey man hallelujah so what I
[1:02:39] wrote here is assure your reassure
[1:02:41] yourself of God's foreknowledge in your
[1:02:44] life and how he has called you but the
[1:02:47] Adam did you go looking for the message
[1:02:48] or did it come looking for you I could
[1:02:52] do that with everybody tonight I wasn't
[1:02:54] raised to the messenger I wasn't going
[1:02:55] looking for an hour seek there was
[1:02:57] something my heart desired more but I
[1:02:59] didn't go looking for God came and found
[1:03:01] me hallelujah Amen jesus said there's no
[1:03:05] man that seeks God it is God that
[1:03:07] seeketh man amen take yourself back
[1:03:10] there that will give you courage amen
[1:03:12] that will give you strength because our
[1:03:15] baton America is a great
[1:03:17] amount of fear rather than faith all the
[1:03:20] time so I believe that we need to keep
[1:03:23] preaching faith I need to I believe we
[1:03:24] need to keep this in two sermons that
[1:03:25] are raising faith amen and I'm trying to
[1:03:28] move that way as well I'm a teacher by
[1:03:30] nature I like to teach things now I love
[1:03:32] it when the Holy Spirit can come in here
[1:03:33] and show us the true doctrine on Daniel
[1:03:36] there - true doctrine on marriage and
[1:03:38] divorce I love that it thrills my soul
[1:03:40] because I love to teach the Word of God
[1:03:41] but I'm seeing that as myself as an
[1:03:44] American Christian I needed some more
[1:03:45] sermons on faith amen because that's
[1:03:48] what the American Christian is going to
[1:03:50] battle praise the Lord
[1:03:52] programs praying in Arkansas and he says
[1:03:55] Lord give us great faith Lord that's
[1:03:57] what we're needing is a stimulation of
[1:04:00] faith a stirring how many could use a
[1:04:02] stirring in their life to stir up the
[1:04:04] Bible says up your mind by way of
[1:04:06] remembrance so when when the Holy Spirit
[1:04:08] brings something to hear your
[1:04:09] remembrance it's supposed to stir you up
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] it's supposed to make you encouraged
[1:04:14] you're supposed to give you a new
[1:04:16] renewed strength it's supposed to
[1:04:18] refresh you amen
[1:04:19] glory he said we look across and think
[1:04:23] of the lands tonight down through the
[1:04:24] many countries the poor people sitting I
[1:04:27] think of America and all its great
[1:04:29] education and great seminaries great
[1:04:32] churches and cathedrals and yet in all
[1:04:34] of it it's lost the rains are falling
[1:04:37] and they build their ecclesiastical
[1:04:38] concrete troughs that runs the rain off
[1:04:41] of the people and says it's for another
[1:04:43] day but the heathen in the parched lands
[1:04:46] are holding up their hands to receive it
[1:04:48] God send laborers to the harvest quickly
[1:04:51] we're in desperate need they're just
[1:04:54] here lingering along in the homeland
[1:04:55] before shoving across the seas where I
[1:04:58] believe you'll save a half a million
[1:04:59] souls so see brother man recognizes in
[1:05:03] America there's often a lack of faith I
[1:05:06] hope it encourage you on Sunday - those
[1:05:09] testimonies encourage you on Sunday
[1:05:10] brother Benjamin experiencing a great
[1:05:13] healing there sister sister Marie
[1:05:16] doesn't even have a CD in her car and it
[1:05:19] starts playing brother Branham doesn't
[1:05:20] have her phone on and it starts playing
[1:05:22] brother branham God wanted her to hear
[1:05:25] that message then that encourage you
[1:05:28] josè praying for Jose's loved ones
[1:05:31] and Samuel and that that woman from New
[1:05:34] York amen
[1:05:35] doesn't that encourage you brother
[1:05:37] Samson telling us said God heard our
[1:05:39] prayers and his families healed that
[1:05:41] ought to raise the faith of American
[1:05:43] Christians amen to see the power of God
[1:05:47] in our lives remember I told you to
[1:05:48] study nights ago I was going to feel
[1:05:49] like I was going to throw up and some
[1:05:51] faith rose up in me and I spoke to that
[1:05:53] mountain of sickness and I said get
[1:05:55] behind me I'm in line I'm in my post of
[1:05:57] duty I don't have time to be sick and
[1:05:59] within a matter of moments it had
[1:06:01] vanished and I was just walking out
[1:06:03] there praising the Lord amen
[1:06:04] we must speak to that mountain and watch
[1:06:07] it move amen glory here you him 1956
[1:06:13] when I was talking about again about
[1:06:16] America and he talks about South Africa
[1:06:18] how when he had service there they had
[1:06:22] truckloads he said Carlos seven carloads
[1:06:25] truckloads cattle trucks of crutches
[1:06:27] wheelchairs and everything off the
[1:06:30] ground thirty thousand raw heathens come
[1:06:33] to Christ at one altar call can you
[1:06:35] imagine
[1:06:36] thirty thousand people receive Christ at
[1:06:39] one time and had truckloads I saw it on
[1:06:43] Facebook brother Don Ferran from
[1:06:46] Minnesota went to South Africa this last
[1:06:49] week and he met someone who saw those
[1:06:52] seven truckloads drive through South
[1:06:54] Africa because he used to work he was
[1:06:56] the worker in the hotel in South Africa
[1:06:59] when brother Branham was looking out the
[1:07:00] window and seven truckloads of crutches
[1:07:02] one of the workers there he met the
[1:07:04] worker and shook his hand got a picture
[1:07:06] with him he was there in the 50s when
[1:07:08] God did a great thing thirty thousand
[1:07:10] people saved hum you know this message
[1:07:12] is true praise God then he posted I
[1:07:15] shared this a few months or last year
[1:07:17] maybe then he went back to the South
[1:07:20] African village in just a village and he
[1:07:23] took a picture with his sister who was
[1:07:25] healed of paralysis in 2006 he took a
[1:07:29] fresh picture with her and they're all
[1:07:30] smiling praising God she couldn't walk
[1:07:32] and his testimony was they prayed for
[1:07:34] her and left and she wasn't healed until
[1:07:36] three days later and now she's walking
[1:07:39] around and the paralysis is gone I mean
[1:07:41] oh there's power in the Word of God and
[1:07:44] I swear you know as American Christian
[1:07:46] oftentimes were I battles I kind of get
[1:07:48] discouraged if I don't see something
[1:07:50] happen right away anybody relate to me
[1:07:52] that's just that I throw I've got to
[1:07:55] overcome many time you know because I've
[1:07:57] seen gods do so many things instantly if
[1:08:00] I'm not careful in my flesh I feel like
[1:08:03] it has to happen again
[1:08:04] but God is teaching me just to speak
[1:08:06] that word believe it move on and then
[1:08:09] watch God go to work amen
[1:08:11] sand still and let God move amen speak
[1:08:14] the Word of God so three days later this
[1:08:16] pair paralyzed woman gets up and walks
[1:08:19] away in the name of Jesus Christ there's
[1:08:22] power in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:24] hallelujah nobody ever says this about
[1:08:28] Americans he talks about South Africans
[1:08:30] how they have so much faith he said but
[1:08:32] oh we Americans mine we're so scholarly
[1:08:35] and so untouchable you know we know all
[1:08:40] about it and see as Christians we have
[1:08:43] as Americans we have English you know we
[1:08:45] have the message in English we have all
[1:08:47] the sermons and if we're not careful
[1:08:48] we'll think we'll we know more about it
[1:08:50] than other nations he said but that's
[1:08:54] the reason God can't get in he says you
[1:08:57] won't listen how many one listen to the
[1:08:59] Holy Spirit innate we get so scholarly
[1:09:02] we think we know everything that we
[1:09:03] won't even listen to simple preaching he
[1:09:05] says that's the reason the church is not
[1:09:09] progressing he says now I'm gonna go to
[1:09:12] the next one in Lima Ohio he talks about
[1:09:15] how 30,000 were healed from one prayer
[1:09:17] he said oh how I wish that could happen
[1:09:19] in America but I'm wondering
[1:09:22] he said we're so highly educated on
[1:09:24] until modern times not to down education
[1:09:28] but we get so educated until we educate
[1:09:30] ourselves out of the Bible I want to be
[1:09:33] educated to the Bible it's good to be
[1:09:35] educated I'm a schoolteacher I love
[1:09:37] education I love seeing kids learn and I
[1:09:39] love it
[1:09:40] I reward them I rejoice with them I love
[1:09:43] education but our greatest education
[1:09:45] would be spiritual education amen to
[1:09:48] humble ourselves and be taught the
[1:09:50] humble simple Word of God amen he said
[1:09:55] no he said if we're not careful we
[1:09:58] seem to want to know more about the
[1:10:00] Bible than God knows about it he says in
[1:10:05] that ashame if we're not careful whoa
[1:10:07] we'll act like we know more about the
[1:10:09] message or the the Bible then God knows
[1:10:11] about it and how do we do that we come
[1:10:14] to church and we're not interested or
[1:10:15] we're not really pulling on the word and
[1:10:17] we don't think we need to know anything
[1:10:19] else that's the spirit of later to see
[1:10:21] how many know that the spirit layer to
[1:10:23] see is I'm rich and increased with Goods
[1:10:24] and I don't have any need of anymore of
[1:10:26] God that's what we've got to overcome
[1:10:28] today US American Christians amen he
[1:10:34] said in doing that we fail to find the
[1:10:36] simplicity of faith praise God and we
[1:10:40] remember we went up we went over the
[1:10:41] simplicity if we don't have faith we
[1:10:43] just repent we see how much God loves us
[1:10:45] we repent with you and then we're happy
[1:10:47] if we repent we're happy God corrected
[1:10:49] us we should be full of love use that
[1:10:51] love to cast out any remaining doubt
[1:10:53] right any fear and then let that love
[1:10:56] now since love is filling your mind let
[1:10:58] it operate and move by faith by speaking
[1:11:01] the Word of God amen hallelujah now this
[1:11:08] is a different quote the greatest
[1:11:11] hindrance in the church is fear they're
[1:11:14] afraid that it just won't work he says
[1:11:19] well if you if for you he said will not
[1:11:23] work that way it must be absolutely
[1:11:26] believers not make believers but
[1:11:28] believers from your heart
[1:11:30] how many can relate to that quote there
[1:11:33] are so there been so many times in my
[1:11:34] Christian walk where I where we spoken
[1:11:38] the word and God has done great things
[1:11:39] right we believe God's where we prayed
[1:11:41] the prayer of faith but there's been
[1:11:43] other times in our lives where we've
[1:11:45] been kind of scared to just speak the
[1:11:46] Word of God how many know what I'm
[1:11:47] talking about because if you talk to
[1:11:50] some of that sick you know you might
[1:11:51] have an unction to kind of speak the
[1:11:54] word and you know just believe God's
[1:11:55] Word but he says American Christians
[1:11:59] will struggle with fear and he said
[1:12:02] we're scared that the prayer or the
[1:12:04] speaking the word just won't work yeah I
[1:12:09] think we can relate to that
[1:12:12] he says the greatest hindrance the
[1:12:14] Christian Church has his fear just a try
[1:12:17] at it now Christianity is not a try at
[1:12:20] it it's a no so it's something that is
[1:12:24] real praise the Lord it's not a hope so
[1:12:27] well I'll try it out you know people say
[1:12:29] that all the time well I'm taking a step
[1:12:30] of faith what they mean is they're just
[1:12:32] guessing you remember people say that
[1:12:35] I'm gonna take a step of faith but
[1:12:36] really they're saying I'm just gonna
[1:12:37] guess a step of faith is the greatest
[1:12:40] step it's the most assured step you'll
[1:12:42] ever take because faith is a revelation
[1:12:44] of the Word of God that is a substance
[1:12:47] in your soul you every understand that a
[1:12:50] step of faith is the safest step you'll
[1:12:52] ever take it's not a hope so it's I know
[1:12:55] so amen sorry that's what a step of
[1:12:58] faith is but people use it like a step
[1:13:01] of hope that's how they use it well I
[1:13:02] hope this works I'm gonna take a step of
[1:13:04] faith they're misusing the word faith
[1:13:07] faith is you already have a substance
[1:13:09] you already know God's Word you already
[1:13:12] know God won't fail Amen that's right so
[1:13:18] see Christianity is not a triad well I
[1:13:20] hope God forgives me I hope he you know
[1:13:23] when I repent I hope he forgives me of
[1:13:25] my sins I hope he fills me with the Holy
[1:13:27] Ghost it's a reality I know he forgave
[1:13:30] me I know he promised to fill me with
[1:13:32] the Holy Ghost I know I'll get it and I
[1:13:34] don't know I'll keep serving God all the
[1:13:36] days of my life hey it's a no so praise
[1:13:39] the Lord Amen now two years ago in 2015
[1:13:44] I preached a series on divine healing
[1:13:46] you probably member it I called it works
[1:13:47] you know his faith expressed by the RAM
[1:13:49] sermon brother Branham tells you he says
[1:13:53] and I'm just gonna paraphrase because I
[1:13:54] want to save time you might remember the
[1:13:56] sermon brother Branham preached it he
[1:13:59] said you could come up for prayer and
[1:14:01] get in the prayer line he said I could
[1:14:02] pray for you all night but if you don't
[1:14:04] receive it nothing will ever happen in
[1:14:07] other words if you don't have a
[1:14:08] revelation he said nothing will happen
[1:14:13] laram says this exact quote I'm quoting
[1:14:15] now I can't make you believe neither can
[1:14:19] you make yourself believe can we wrap
[1:14:20] our minds around that tonight you can't
[1:14:23] make yourself believe
[1:14:26] God has to give it to you I'm gonna say
[1:14:28] Lord give me the revelation hey give me
[1:14:31] the revelation you can't work your way
[1:14:33] into it have you ever tried to work your
[1:14:35] way into it I'll just keep saying over
[1:14:38] and over again that's a good thing to do
[1:14:39] it on any promise that you know is right
[1:14:41] but sometimes we try to do it and it
[1:14:44] just don't work because we can't work
[1:14:47] ourselves into it God has to give it to
[1:14:49] you that's why we pray for revelation
[1:14:50] more than anything else
[1:14:52] reveal your word to me Lord it's a gift
[1:14:55] of God to believe it's not your faith
[1:14:58] how many know that but it's God's faith
[1:15:01] praise God we say God give me your faith
[1:15:04] for this situation sorry Jesus give me
[1:15:07] your faith for the situation
[1:15:09] I will not conquer by my human faith but
[1:15:11] I'll conquer by the supernatural faith
[1:15:13] you gave me because it's your own faith
[1:15:16] Paul said I live this life not by my
[1:15:18] faith but by the faith of the Son of God
[1:15:20] how many member that from the scripture
[1:15:21] that's from Galatians the life I live I
[1:15:24] don't live by the flesh I live by the
[1:15:26] faith of the Son of God tonight I'm
[1:15:29] living by Jesus's faith amen
[1:15:32] I'm preaching tonight not by my faith
[1:15:34] but I faith in Jesus's faith that he
[1:15:36] said preach the word hallelujah preach
[1:15:39] the word and these signs shall follow
[1:15:40] them that believe amen hallelujah it's
[1:15:44] not your faith it's God's faith your
[1:15:47] intellectual faith might believe it fine
[1:15:49] but unless the faith of God is doubt in
[1:15:51] your heart
[1:15:54] here's what he says your intellectual
[1:15:56] faith can accept it and do that he said
[1:15:59] and just keep believing it with all your
[1:16:01] heart until God does reveal it to you so
[1:16:05] here's where we have the balance we can
[1:16:07] try to work ourselves into it but I
[1:16:09] would say this brother Anderson quote
[1:16:11] the word that you already know and
[1:16:13] believe okay so for example how many
[1:16:15] believe by His stripes I'm healed
[1:16:17] don't be that by His stripes you were
[1:16:19] already healed how many know the Bible
[1:16:20] says that it says in Isaiah 53 and also
[1:16:23] says in first Peter I believe chapter 2
[1:16:25] if I'm not mistaken by whose stripes you
[1:16:28] were already healed if that's all we can
[1:16:32] believe then keep quoting all you can
[1:16:34] believe until God reveals what you need
[1:16:37] for that situation
[1:16:39] with me so for example let's say in the
[1:16:42] case of let's say John or Dustin or you
[1:16:44] can put anybody in there
[1:16:46] maybe sister Shirley you can put anybody
[1:16:47] in there if we're not I'm not sure
[1:16:49] exactly what it is but one thing I'm
[1:16:51] sure of is that God is a healer and that
[1:16:55] God has already healed them I don't know
[1:16:57] his will right for this maybe this
[1:16:59] individual situation but brother Ram
[1:17:01] said keep confessing the word that you
[1:17:03] do know until God reveals his perfect
[1:17:06] will for that situation are you with me

[1:21:34] that I'm not just some castaway remind
[1:21:36] me that I'm a true child of God remind
[1:21:38] me of my position in Christ Jesus I am
[1:21:40] now seated in heavenly places and you
[1:21:44] might not see it but when we're in
[1:21:45] Christ we are already seated in heavenly
[1:21:48] places praise God this is for the
[1:21:51] believer you're not sitting down in
[1:21:54] condemnation you know or some area of
[1:21:56] some judgment or something like that you
[1:21:58] are seated in heavenly places and we
[1:22:01] have a right to these things he asked us
[1:22:03] to come and we're the ones that will
[1:22:05] come we're the ones that will pray we're
[1:22:07] the ones that will intercede amen that's
[1:22:10] exactly right Gloria and we know that we
[1:22:18] will conquer by love how me know love is
[1:22:20] the greatest conquering force we must
[1:22:23] fill our hearts with God's love and that
[1:22:26] love will conquer whatever we're fearing
[1:22:28] at that time praise the Lord okay I got
[1:22:32] twenty minutes I'll closed in twenty
[1:22:33] minutes I by the grace Lord because I
[1:22:35] just got to my spot where it says
[1:22:36] closing on my note so I did work that
[1:22:38] out pretty good by the grace of the Lord
[1:22:40] hallelujah go to John 14 if you got your
[1:22:43] Bibles go down 14 I'm sorry I don't I
[1:22:46] don't put many quotes up here lately
[1:22:47] I've just been preaching off my notes of
[1:22:49] hope that's okay let's go to John 14 I
[1:22:52] want to close with these kind of
[1:22:54] thoughts here
[1:23:06] John 1425 you got your Bibles here I'm
[1:23:11] gonna close with Jesus's words Jesus
[1:23:14] says let not your heart be afraid
[1:23:19] what do american christians battle most
[1:23:21] the prophet tells us fear we're scared
[1:23:25] to try it I've had brother Tim Myers and
[1:23:29] now even brother Samson Shetty was
[1:23:30] telling me how people over there you
[1:23:33] know in foreign nation they're so poor
[1:23:34] oh yeah Tim iris told me one time that
[1:23:37] the people stayed after service and
[1:23:39] somewhere in Africa and he said they the
[1:23:42] ministers left the service the people
[1:23:43] were shouting rejoicing and they drove
[1:23:45] by two hours later after supper and the
[1:23:47] people are still there shouting and
[1:23:49] praising God and worshiping and thanking
[1:23:51] God for His Word now you know God honors
[1:23:54] faith like that church praise the Lord
[1:23:57] have any of us ever done that just just
[1:24:01] to kind of give us an encouragement you
[1:24:03] know or to give us so maybe we need a
[1:24:04] little rebuke yeah sometimes it's
[1:24:06] because we don't pray long enough
[1:24:08] sometimes it's just a simple two-minute
[1:24:11] prayer woman to prayer and that's fine
[1:24:13] but if we were only we really want to
[1:24:15] get down with business how did Jacob
[1:24:17] overcome he had to wrestle all night
[1:24:19] praise the Lord he had to wrestle in
[1:24:22] prayer in other words that's for us had
[1:24:24] to wrestle and prayer that's what the
[1:24:26] Prophet said he said people would sit
[1:24:28] out in the rain for his meetings all day
[1:24:30] just for him to pray for them one time
[1:24:32] and he said you know God honors faith
[1:24:34] like that he said God wants God lets you
[1:24:38] go through hard times
[1:24:39] so you'll appreciate the blessing when
[1:24:41] it comes right cuz we know anyone that's
[1:24:44] born with a silver spoon in their mouth
[1:24:46] you ever heard that saying they don't
[1:24:48] appreciate it if you're born with for
[1:24:51] example all my friends in high school as
[1:24:53] soon as I turn 16 they got a brand-new
[1:24:54] car you ever seen your friends get that
[1:24:57] but then they wreck it or they treat it
[1:25:00] like trash because they don't appreciate
[1:25:02] it
[1:25:02] that's what program says about faith if
[1:25:04] God just gave us everything a brand-new
[1:25:06] car gave us everything we want he said
[1:25:08] we wouldn't know the value of faith how
[1:25:12] many understand that that's how it is in
[1:25:14] the spiritual - God lets us get down and
[1:25:17] pray remember John the Baptist said
[1:25:18] don't take the kingdom of God easily you
[1:25:20] take up the violent take it by force in
[1:25:23] other words you got to press your way
[1:25:24] past your flesh into the Holy Spirit huh
[1:25:28] me know you got to plant things of the
[1:25:30] spear in order to harvest things of the
[1:25:32] spirit huh me know that the Bible says
[1:25:35] if you you'll reap whatever you sow
[1:25:37] right if you plant work if you sow
[1:25:40] worldliness and so laziness that's what
[1:25:42] you're gonna harvest right if you plant
[1:25:45] spiritual things if you plant faith if
[1:25:47] you plant fastings and prayers and
[1:25:49] crying out to god you're gonna reap the
[1:25:51] blessings of that hallelujah it's
[1:25:54] exactly right because if not you won't
[1:25:55] appreciate it
[1:25:57] remember Jesus learned obedience how did
[1:25:59] Jesus learn obedience by the things that
[1:26:02] he suffered praise the Lord praise the
[1:26:06] Lord he had to suffer in order to learn
[1:26:09] to obey sometimes we wonder why we Lord
[1:26:13] why am i suffering so you obey next time
[1:26:16] so obey so appreciate appreciate
[1:26:19] character building
[1:26:21] praise God God's building my character
[1:26:23] we'd appreciate character building we'll
[1:26:26] appreciate the hard times
[1:26:28] amen I won't appreciate the hard times
[1:26:30] don't you John 1425 these things have I
[1:26:36] spoken unto you being yet present with
[1:26:38] you but the comforter which is the Holy
[1:26:41] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:26:43] name he shall teach you all things and
[1:26:45] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:26:46] whatsoever I have said unto you what a
[1:26:52] promise like I said a few weeks ago we'd
[1:26:55] have to worry about what we're gonna say
[1:26:56] the Holy Ghost will give you what to say
[1:26:58] in that hour that's why we're giving the
[1:27:00] Holy Ghost we have to worry about don't
[1:27:02] have to wonder not to be fearful the
[1:27:04] Holy Ghost will give you what you need
[1:27:06] in that hour verse 27 I'm gonna get down
[1:27:11] here peace I leave with you my peace I
[1:27:16] give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:27:18] give I unto you let not your heart be
[1:27:21] troubled neither let it be afraid so
[1:27:25] Jesus gives us two opposites one is the
[1:27:28] fear and the other is peace now we call
[1:27:31] that faith to it you understand that's
[1:27:32] interchangeable because you have faith
[1:27:34] in God so you're at peace right but
[1:27:36] Jesus gives us these and did you notice
[1:27:38] he said I'm leaving it with you I'm not
[1:27:41] leaving you the peace of the world you
[1:27:44] know we were reading in Ecclesiastes the
[1:27:45] other night and it says a man who's
[1:27:48] satisfied with silver won't be satisfied
[1:27:50] with silver when he goes to bed he said
[1:27:52] well you won't sleep well you guys
[1:27:54] remember that from last night milk I
[1:27:55] don't know if guys remember that Lydia I
[1:27:56] don't know in case you remember that but
[1:27:58] the Bible said if you are satisfied with
[1:28:00] silver then yours when you go to sleep
[1:28:02] you won't be satisfied see because
[1:28:05] there's no real peace in worldly things
[1:28:08] there's only peace in the love of Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ and he that's what he's saying
[1:28:13] here notice he puts the responsibility
[1:28:17] of being in the state of fear or peace
[1:28:20] who's he put it on he puts it on you he
[1:28:23] puts it on me because he said let not
[1:28:26] your heart be troubled don't notice
[1:28:31] don't let your condition be a fearful
[1:28:34] condition let your condition be peaceful
[1:28:36] so Jesus puts it on us he said I'm
[1:28:41] leaving peace I'm leaving my peace and
[1:28:45] don't let your heart be full of fear let
[1:28:48] it be filled with peace
[1:28:50] oh what a privilege so we cannot say
[1:28:55] well brother Jesse and you know I can't
[1:28:57] stop being afraid I can't stop it I
[1:29:00] can't stop worrying I can't stop
[1:29:03] fretting I can't stop wondering if we
[1:29:07] confess that that's what we're gonna get
[1:29:11] we cannot say that because life and
[1:29:14] death we know is in the power of the
[1:29:16] tongue and Jesus said let not your
[1:29:18] hearts be afraid glory now don't get me
[1:29:23] wrong Church there's a balance with
[1:29:24] everything as a teacher I always say
[1:29:26] this there's a balance I know a
[1:29:28] wonderful woman denominational Christian
[1:29:30] a fantastic person has shown great
[1:29:32] kindness to my family and my wife but
[1:29:35] this individual this sister struggles
[1:29:37] greatly with anxiety greatly and has
[1:29:42] she's had me when I testified us americo
[1:29:44] she had me pray for her and said you got
[1:29:46] better
[1:29:46] then you know she's just constantly
[1:29:48] struggling with it every time we go back
[1:29:49] she's always talking about my anxiety my
[1:29:51] anxiety so in other words what I'm
[1:29:54] saying is that's kind of like her battle
[1:29:56] remember brother Ram said what was his
[1:29:58] bad remember his battle he's a nervous
[1:29:59] person Lord Ram said he was a nervous
[1:30:02] person he always battled that just being
[1:30:04] nervous can anybody relate to that
[1:30:06] tonight a nervous person just nervous
[1:30:09] about everything oh I do this then you
[1:30:14] have you know the carefree people that
[1:30:15] they're hardly worried about anything
[1:30:16] and I've met some of those people
[1:30:18] they're so carefree they hardly get
[1:30:20] anything done but then the people that
[1:30:23] are so nervous they try they think they
[1:30:25] get everything done and then they feel
[1:30:26] like they got nothing done and they sit
[1:30:28] there and guilt and they condemn them
[1:30:30] yeah yet they got so much done during
[1:30:32] the day you see but that's their battle
[1:30:36] that's program calls that's their that's
[1:30:37] their genetic makeup right that's their
[1:30:40] spiritual makeup in other words that's
[1:30:42] how that's how they're built and so this
[1:30:45] individual constantly talks about
[1:30:47] anxiety attacks and one time I posted
[1:30:50] something on Facebook I was reading in
[1:30:51] Proverbs I think it was and the Bible
[1:30:54] said do not have sudden fear I think was
[1:30:57] Ecclesiastes have no sudden fear when
[1:31:00] things come upon you don't get scared of
[1:31:01] and that that individual you know
[1:31:04] responded right away and said thank you
[1:31:05] Jesus that's just what I needed to hear
[1:31:07] this morning and that scripture lifted
[1:31:10] the spirit of that individual who
[1:31:12] struggles with anxiety because the Bible
[1:31:16] said we don't have to have that we don't
[1:31:18] have to confess that we don't have to
[1:31:20] stay like that because jesus said don't
[1:31:22] let your heart you're the one who
[1:31:24] controls your atmosphere praise God
[1:31:26] you're the one that controls whether you
[1:31:28] live in fear or whether you live in
[1:31:30] peace I say let's live in peace amen
[1:31:32] let's be American Christians that
[1:31:34] overcome the greatest hindrance of the
[1:31:36] church and let's have faith and let's
[1:31:38] not live in fear praise God Isaiah 26:3
[1:31:44] says thou wilt keep him in perfect peace
[1:31:47] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:31:55] trusted in thee
[1:31:59] what uh what a condition that is how
[1:32:02] many how many striving for that
[1:32:03] condition perfect peace Isaiah said this
[1:32:06] is Old Testament so it was possible the
[1:32:08] Old Testament it's possible now I will
[1:32:10] keep him in perfect peace whose mind
[1:32:12] stays on me because they're trusting in
[1:32:16] me so see we have a choice it's going
[1:32:18] back some closing guy with the the
[1:32:19] battle of the mind we can have victory
[1:32:23] in the battles of our minds go to
[1:32:27] Philippians 1 verse 7 go to Philippians
[1:32:31] 1 verse 7 while you're turning there I'm
[1:32:33] going to close with these thoughts or
[1:32:34] flip pians 1:7 and I got 13 minutes Wow
[1:32:38] praise the Lord it's a lot of time go to
[1:32:40] Philippians 1:7 you and I control our
[1:32:51] hearts men's hearts will be failing for
[1:32:54] fear Americans struggle so much with
[1:32:56] fear but let not your hearts be afraid
[1:33:02] in other words try not to let it happen
[1:33:05] like my man said don't don't fear if you
[1:33:07] fear God can't work with us will he save
[1:33:11] us and deliver us yeah of course he will
[1:33:12] his mercy extends even when we can't
[1:33:14] have the victory his mercy will extend
[1:33:16] to us but we also want to walk in the
[1:33:20] promises that he gives to us amen we
[1:33:23] want to inherit all the divine promises
[1:33:25] like Peter said we want to be a partaker
[1:33:27] of the divine nature a man ha ha ha ha
[1:33:32] in other words I see a lot of my carnal
[1:33:34] nature I see a lot of the carnal Jesse
[1:33:36] Smith come out I want to see the divine
[1:33:38] Jesse Smith come out I want to see the
[1:33:40] God part into me I want to see that part
[1:33:42] manifest yeah I see the carnal Jesse
[1:33:46] Smith all the time tired or upset or
[1:33:48] worried but I want to see that divine
[1:33:50] part I want to see that seat of God in
[1:33:52] my soul I want to see that Express they
[1:33:54] men the divine nature inside of me I
[1:33:57] want to live from that praise God
[1:34:02] flippy ins 1:7 now you're there I'm
[1:34:06] there let me give you some background so
[1:34:09] you just look at me for a moment if you
[1:34:10] want or you can look at your Bible there
[1:34:12] Paul wrote this letter from prison to
[1:34:16] the church in Philippi this church was
[1:34:19] founded in acts 16 a European Church
[1:34:23] Philip I was a Roman colony and the
[1:34:26] history I saw says that retired Roman
[1:34:29] soldiers a lot of retired Roman soldiers
[1:34:32] lived there and there's a lot of
[1:34:33] business it was known as a patriotic
[1:34:37] City which in other words they're very
[1:34:39] faithful to Rome so much so that
[1:34:42] Christians were persecuted in Philippi
[1:34:45] because we see Paul we find Paul in
[1:34:48] prison for what being a Christian
[1:34:50] preaching the gospel so this is the
[1:34:53] background on the book of Philippians
[1:34:55] how many appreciate that I prefer got
[1:34:58] about that and I was reminded that this
[1:35:00] morning I thought praise the Lord
[1:35:01] here's a man writing from prison which
[1:35:04] you and I I don't think anybody in here
[1:35:06] has been in prison if you have sorry you
[1:35:08] know it's all must be awful thing to do
[1:35:10] that have happened to you maybe you know
[1:35:13] how that is but a lot of us can't relate
[1:35:17] to that I can't like that I'm never been
[1:35:18] in a prison before I've been in football
[1:35:20] camp that was like a prison but it
[1:35:22] wasn't actually a prison yeah I've been
[1:35:24] in hospital that was kind of seem like a
[1:35:26] prison I can't move I got surgery and I
[1:35:28] seem like a prison but none of us have
[1:35:31] really probably been locked up before
[1:35:32] but Paul is locked up in a prison and
[1:35:35] he's writing this letter now look at
[1:35:38] verse 7 Philippians 1:7 even as it is
[1:35:42] meat for me to think this of you all
[1:35:43] because I have you in my heart and that
[1:35:46] beautiful the prophet had the church in
[1:35:49] his heart I hope this church is in your
[1:35:51] heart in other words I hope when you're
[1:35:53] not here you pray for us and you think
[1:35:56] of us I hope when I'm not around that
[1:35:58] you pray for me because I'm praying for
[1:36:01] you
[1:36:01] I want I want to be in your heart I want
[1:36:05] to I want to be your friend right I want
[1:36:07] to be your pastor I wanna be your your
[1:36:08] brother in the Lord I want to be in your
[1:36:10] heart because you're in my heart in as
[1:36:14] much as both in my bonds and in the
[1:36:16] defence and confirmation of the gospel
[1:36:18] you are partakers of my grace so see
[1:36:22] he's in bonds he tells you right there
[1:36:23] I'm in bonds
[1:36:25] I ain't even remembering you while I'm
[1:36:27] in prison now I would think as just a
[1:36:30] human out I might be so discouraged in
[1:36:32] prison I'd forget about everybody else
[1:36:33] and I just haven't I might have a pity
[1:36:35] party on myself you know because I'm in
[1:36:37] prison
[1:36:38] I have no freedoms but Paul even in
[1:36:41] prison all's he can think about is the
[1:36:43] church know what a heart what a heart of
[1:36:47] love what a real sincere Christian Paul
[1:36:50] was a man fill with the Holy Ghost now
[1:36:56] go to chapter 4 I'm closing here I got
[1:36:58] about 8 more minutes flip pins 4 I just
[1:37:01] want to prove that to you by the
[1:37:02] scripture he's in jail he's in jail
[1:37:06] writing this letter and he writes about
[1:37:09] how you can keep your mind pure which
[1:37:13] were familiar with but let's go through
[1:37:15] it slowly flip ins 4 let's go there
[1:37:21] verse 3 Philippians 4 3 he's in prison
[1:37:28] and I entreat thee also true yoke fellow
[1:37:32] says the other their fellow laborers
[1:37:35] help those women which labored with me
[1:37:37] in the gospel with Clement also with
[1:37:40] other my fellow laborers whose names are
[1:37:43] in the book of life that's a beautiful
[1:37:46] scripture you see Paul says all those
[1:37:48] people that work with me their names in
[1:37:51] the book of life just like my name's in
[1:37:52] little house book of life see Church
[1:37:54] when you work with the message of the
[1:37:56] hour see where your names at it's in
[1:37:58] heaven verse 4 rejoice in the Lord
[1:38:01] always and again I say rejoice a man in
[1:38:06] prison is telling them rejoice be happy
[1:38:09] let your moderation be known unto all
[1:38:11] men the Lord is at hand be careful for
[1:38:14] nothing so see don't be anxious for
[1:38:16] anything but in everything by prayer and
[1:38:21] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:38:24] requests be made known unto God
[1:38:30] so Paul
[1:38:32] and imprison says don't be anxious about
[1:38:33] anything now he can't say that unless he
[1:38:37] knows what it's all about right
[1:38:39] he can't preach this unless he knows
[1:38:41] what it's about and he's telling the
[1:38:45] people this thing he's saying don't be
[1:38:47] anxious cuz I'm not anxious I'm in
[1:38:49] prison and I'm not even anxious because
[1:38:52] I prayed and I've asked God for his will
[1:38:55] now look what it says everything by
[1:38:57] prayer and supplication with
[1:38:59] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:39:01] known to God Church stop stop a minute
[1:39:04] think about your prayers when you ask
[1:39:06] God for something today did you thank
[1:39:07] God for the answer for yet you should
[1:39:10] have right because that's what the Bible
[1:39:13] says in everything so in every prayer
[1:39:16] make your requests known to God but say
[1:39:18] thank you Lord I know you're gonna do it
[1:39:19] somehow or another you're gonna answer
[1:39:22] this prayer that's that's being content
[1:39:25] here that's that's being careful for
[1:39:27] enough I'm not gonna worry about nothing
[1:39:29] because I'm gonna pray for I'm just
[1:39:30] gonna leave thanking the Lord Lord
[1:39:31] you're gonna take care of it that's a
[1:39:33] real prayer how many want to pray those
[1:39:35] kind of prayers my hands up praise God
[1:39:37] I want to pray those kind of prayers I
[1:39:38] don't want to be careful for nothing
[1:39:41] and if you do that look at verse 7 if
[1:39:43] you and I can do that more and more the
[1:39:46] peace of God which passes all
[1:39:48] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:39:50] minds through Christ Jesus amen jesus
[1:39:56] said I'm leaving you my peace where's
[1:39:59] that church it's in prayer it's in
[1:40:02] prayer how many how many how many need
[1:40:04] that reminder from time to time your
[1:40:07] peace that he left you is in prayer and
[1:40:09] the prayer of thanksgiving Lord I'd ask
[1:40:13] you about this situation with my my
[1:40:15] mother or my mother-in-law or my father
[1:40:16] my father-in-law I've asked you about
[1:40:18] this situation with the church and
[1:40:20] actually about most financial need I'm
[1:40:21] actually about this temptation that
[1:40:22] keeps coming and I thank you that you're
[1:40:25] gonna answer it and the Bible says if
[1:40:28] you pray that the peace of God will take
[1:40:30] over your life amen

[1:40:35] in the midst of a trial and have peace
[1:40:38] in your heart Amen what a blessing verse
[1:40:42] eight
[1:40:45] now verse 8 gives you eight different
[1:40:48] things you can focus on eight different
[1:40:53] things you can focus on finally brethren
[1:40:56] what summer things are true there's one
[1:40:58] so if you're going through a battle set
[1:41:01] your mind on what something that's true
[1:41:03] something that's true don't focus on on
[1:41:06] what you're wondering about don't focus
[1:41:07] on the question don't focus on the
[1:41:09] question focus on what you know is true
[1:41:11] how many can say amen to that you had we
[1:41:14] have to we have to set our minds after
[1:41:16] we pray set our mind on I know this is
[1:41:19] true I know this is true whatsoever
[1:41:23] things are honest right whatever things
[1:41:29] are just think about things that are
[1:41:31] fair and true what sort of things are
[1:41:34] pure think of the purest thing the
[1:41:37] cleanest thing in the word the cleanest
[1:41:39] thing in your life the cleanest
[1:41:40] experience you've had with God and to
[1:41:42] think of something that's clean and pure
[1:41:44] that's free from defilement think of
[1:41:46] that don't think of the person that's
[1:41:49] done evil to you don't think of the evil
[1:41:51] that that's so-and-so Center don't think
[1:41:53] of anything that's that's unpure think
[1:41:56] of something that's pure whatever things
[1:41:59] are lovely whatsoever things are of a
[1:42:04] good report and see so many times we
[1:42:06] think about the bad reports that people
[1:42:08] say oh this brother said this about me
[1:42:10] and that sister said that about me and
[1:42:12] we think about a bad report instead of
[1:42:16] the good report and the Bible says you
[1:42:19] have eight different options praise God
[1:42:20] you have eight different options one of
[1:42:22] them is think about a good report think
[1:42:24] about the good testimony that you heard
[1:42:26] praise the Lord don't focus on the
[1:42:28] negative brother man said you can go to
[1:42:30] every service and find something wrong
[1:42:33] and every service don't leave this
[1:42:35] service church no don't leave Sunday
[1:42:37] let's not leave a service remembering
[1:42:39] the wrong thing
[1:42:40] let's leave remembering the right thing
[1:42:42] I was talking to somebody the other
[1:42:46] recently and they went to a great
[1:42:50] service but I don't know what state they
[1:42:53] were in but all's they remembered was
[1:42:55] that the preacher didn't call for an
[1:42:56] altar call and they were all upset about
[1:42:58] that
[1:42:59] well you don't church let's just step
[1:43:02] back a minute I'm not trying to
[1:43:03] criticize but all the person left with
[1:43:07] was nothing in that our sermon all they
[1:43:09] left with was something negative and
[1:43:13] what if the Holy Spirit wasn't calling
[1:43:15] an altar call that night just like what
[1:43:19] if the Holy Spirit doesn't there's no
[1:43:20] one to be healed that night what if it's
[1:43:22] a night for something else do you see
[1:43:24] how we can meditate on the bad report
[1:43:27] can every see that and that's not going
[1:43:30] to bring us peace right that's gonna
[1:43:32] bring us fear that's gonna bring us a
[1:43:35] discouragement leave here with the good
[1:43:40] report Oh sister so-and-so saying a
[1:43:45] wonderful special oh I appreciate our
[1:43:47] brother singing another special oh I
[1:43:49] appreciate the pastor preaching the Word

[1:43:59] must leave we must leave the our house
[1:44:01] we must leave work focus on the good
[1:44:05] report if there be any virtue don't
[1:44:11] focus on things that SAP your energy
[1:44:13] focus on things that strengthen you I've
[1:44:17] got this story on my phone whenever I
[1:44:19] get discouraged and the Holy Spirit
[1:44:21] brings it to me Marie Mertz I go back
[1:44:23] and listen to that it's like a
[1:44:24] motivational it's like a spiritual
[1:44:25] motivation for me it just it just
[1:44:29] inspires me every time I hear it write
[1:44:34] something that strengthens you you see
[1:44:37] people that do workout the CrossFit you
[1:44:40] see those people I have friends on
[1:44:41] Facebook that do CrossFit what do they
[1:44:43] do to get a motivate in the morning I've
[1:44:44] ever seen
[1:44:45] so my friends oh you when I was in
[1:44:46] football what do they do as soon as they
[1:44:48] get up they set their alarm and it
[1:44:49] starts playing their favorite song right
[1:44:52] ever seen that when I was in football
[1:44:54] camp we used to get up at 4:30 church
[1:44:56] that was awful that was like prison I
[1:44:59] guess but the point was some guys in our
[1:45:02] dorm would have like their favorite rap
[1:45:04] song and so before 30 and embracing this
[1:45:07] rap song and pretty soon the guys are
[1:45:10] jumping around now that was like the
[1:45:11] first few days of camp after that
[1:45:12] everybody was tired if your body gets
[1:45:15] worn out but at least at the beginning
[1:45:18] they were trying to they're trying to
[1:45:22] use something that gave them strength
[1:45:24] and how many times have you turned on a
[1:45:26] good YouTube song or turn on your music
[1:45:29] and it's given you strength how many
[1:45:30] times have you done that the Bible said
[1:45:33] think on things that have virtue think
[1:45:37] on something meditate on something
[1:45:38] that's going to give you strength I've

[1:45:48] time just went off okay give me one more
[1:45:49] minutes here here I'm a teacher and I
[1:45:52] love questions and answers I love

[1:45:56] especially with the Bible not so much at
[1:45:57] school sometimes I can't answer those
[1:45:59] kids that's really hard question
[1:46:00] sometimes I'm like well I'm not a high
[1:46:02] school science teacher yeah Wow look it
[1:46:04] up but I love Bible questions because
[1:46:07] that's my main focus well sometimes I go
[1:46:11] on those believe the sign sites and all
[1:46:12] those things and God has shown me great
[1:46:14] things I share ones brother crying he's
[1:46:16] like my never seen that revelation and
[1:46:17] got to give me a revelation on where
[1:46:19] this believed the sign in video was all
[1:46:21] wrong is off the word but I find myself
[1:46:24] if I go on there too often I find myself
[1:46:28] weaker in the faith I find myself a
[1:46:30] little you know wondering I'm wondering
[1:46:32] about things and I've got to quickly go
[1:46:34] back and go back to something that's got
[1:46:36] virtue on it are you with me Church that
[1:46:40] is that help you out by God's grace I
[1:46:41] can I love to find what they're wrong I
[1:46:43] love to I love I love to find the truth
[1:46:45] and why they left you know I love to
[1:46:47] find that because I love to see what

[1:46:51] you and I hey man I love to answer and I
[1:46:54] love for questions and answers brother
[1:46:55] branham I love questions and answers but
[1:46:57] I've got to make sure brother Jesse
[1:46:59] myself I think on things that give me
[1:47:02] strength not sap strength away from me
[1:47:05] focus on things that will strengthen you
[1:47:08] if there be any praise I can if I can
[1:47:12] praise the Lord for this all praise the
[1:47:13] Lord for this praise the Lord think on
[1:47:15] these things verse nine those things
[1:47:18] which you both learned and received and
[1:47:20] heard and seen in me do and the God of
[1:47:23] peace shall be with you
[1:47:26] now for us look at the life of Paul we
[1:47:28] can learn from Paul we can look at the
[1:47:30] life of brother brand we can learn from
[1:47:31] that we can look at the life of each
[1:47:32] other those that are stronger than that
[1:47:34] strong in the faith look at their lives
[1:47:36] and the God of peace will be with you if
[1:47:38] you do the same things they do so the
[1:47:43] Bible gave you eight channels that you
[1:47:45] can that will bring you peace eight
[1:47:49] different things to think on lovely
[1:47:51] things right pure things things of good
[1:47:53] report things divert you eight different
[1:47:56] options aren't you glad God gives you
[1:47:57] eight options amen he's didn't say oh
[1:47:59] just listen to songs only or just go
[1:48:01] listen to your sermon or just listen
[1:48:03] read your Bible only he gives you eight
[1:48:05] options same ahead eight channels that
[1:48:08] if you think on these things you'll have
[1:48:11] the peace of God in your heart now look
[1:48:14] here's a man that knew God's peace
[1:48:17] sitting in a prison cell and he knew
[1:48:20] God's peace look at verse 10 but I
[1:48:24] rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at
[1:48:26] the last your care of me hath flourished
[1:48:29] again where and you were also careful
[1:48:33] but you lacked opportunity not that I
[1:48:36] speak in respect of want for I have
[1:48:39] learned that whatever state I'm in
[1:48:41] therewith to be content I know both how
[1:48:47] to be abased or humbled I know how to be
[1:48:49] humbled and I know too how to bow nor
[1:48:52] how to be rejoicing and happy everywhere
[1:48:55] and in all things I'm instructed both to
[1:48:58] be full and to be hungry both to abound
[1:49:01] and to suffer need and then the famous
[1:49:05] verse verse 13 how many like this verse
[1:49:06] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:49:10] strengtheneth me that scripture is so
[1:49:15] misused I as a senior in high school I
[1:49:19] wrote that scripture Philippians 4:13 on
[1:49:21] my wristband when we go to football
[1:49:24] games and I'd say I can do all things
[1:49:25] through Christ like Christ really cares
[1:49:27] about who in the football game
[1:49:29] I was totally misusing that scripture I
[1:49:32] wanted to score touchdowns because I can
[1:49:34] do all things through Christ he don't
[1:49:36] care nothing about that
[1:49:38] souls are going to hell that's what he
[1:49:40] cares about amen
[1:49:41] saving souls sounds misusing that and in
[1:49:45] the context of this Paul saying I can be
[1:49:47] just as happy in prison as I can be as a
[1:49:49] free man
[1:49:51] why because the peace of God amen and if
[1:49:58] you know this story a poor froude itis
[1:50:00] that's a big name
[1:50:02] I was practicing early today FF Road
[1:50:04] itis had brought this offering from the
[1:50:06] church at Philippi he brought it to the
[1:50:08] prison where Paul was and then Paul so
[1:50:11] happy he writes this letter he says to
[1:50:14] the church at Philippi and graced me
[1:50:16] with you all these thing he writes them
[1:50:17] a letter and said thank you for the gift
[1:50:19] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:50:22] strengthens me when we feel I can't go
[1:50:27] another day brother Jesse or husband or
[1:50:29] wife I can't go another day this is so
[1:50:31] hard
[1:50:31] remember you can do all things through
[1:50:34] Christ who strengthens you look at verse
[1:50:43] 19 but my God shall supply all your need
[1:50:47] according to his riches in glory by
[1:50:49] Christ Jesus so Paul just received the
[1:50:52] gift and he said I can do all things
[1:50:54] through Christ and he said I just
[1:50:56] received your gift you just gave to me
[1:50:57] you're a poor people you're poor Church
[1:50:59] you gave to me but believe me because
[1:51:01] you gave to me God will supply all of
[1:51:03] your needs as well so what were Paul's
[1:51:08] greatest lessons that he learned from
[1:51:10] God
[1:51:11] where did Paul learn that I can do all
[1:51:14] things through Christ that strengthened
[1:51:16] me was it when he raised the dead was it
[1:51:18] when he threw the serpent in the fire
[1:51:20] was it when he was on the ship and the a
[1:51:23] he met the angel on the bottom of the
[1:51:25] boat no it was in a prison Church in a
[1:51:28] prison that's where he learned his
[1:51:31] greatest lessons was in a prison that I
[1:51:34] can do all things through Christ who
[1:51:36] strengthens me the state of our feet let
[1:51:41] not your heart be troubled
[1:51:43] how many will say that tonight I'm not
[1:51:45] gonna let my heart be troubled because I
[1:51:47] can do all things through Christ who
[1:51:49] strengthens me I will not live a life of
[1:51:52] fear I'll not be scared of this person
[1:51:55] or this situation I won't be scared of
[1:51:57] tomorrow I won't be scared of next year
[1:51:59] I won't be scared of next month because
[1:52:04] I have learned to be content I have
[1:52:06] learned that I can do all things through
[1:52:08] Christ who strengthens me how many love
