TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we're looking at the Millennium here tonight by God's grace preaching outside uh behind my house due to the uh flooding there in the church so we read Revelation 20 ver1 ver2 says and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years notice four titles right or four or three titles in one name we'd say maybe his name is Satan but he has these titles just like God is Father Son and Holy Ghost but there's one name the Lord Jesus Christ verse three and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season so he falls for a thousand years what a awful uh we'd say punishment but of course that's what he deserves verse four here's where you and I come in and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and don't forget 1 Corinthians 6 you'll judge the world you'll judge Angels the Bible said if we can judge the little matters amongst us now and do it the right way the Bible said we'll judge the world and will judge angels and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus like St Paul and for the word of God other saints that died for the word of God which had not worshiped the beast that's where you and I come in right there we did not worship the Beast we don't but R says you don't have to be beheaded to be here you just have to overcome the Beast system neither his image which is the World Council of churches neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads that's the doctrine of the the false church or in their hands brother Ram said that's doing the will of the Antichrist system and they lived and reigned with Christ a, years praise God verse 5 but the rest of the Dead live not again until till the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection now let's read verse 6 on three 1 2 3 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years may God add his Blessing to read of his word you can be seated also my wife said there there's some bug repellent back there we got some bugs down here you know I tried to shoot them away but of course they come back you know I don't know something something about they want to be down here so by God's grace we'll look here at the scriptures on the Millennium I appreciate you coming out here in our makeshift church here by the grace of the Lord um I got a lot of things uh uh I'll probably save for the video some of this will be uh new to you some of it will be reviewed so I'll try to kind of have a sense of how you feel about this so I want to give a disclaimer you know there's no thus sayith the Lord from Brother brandham on this topic so that's why a few of the statements I'm going to say you know might be different than what you've heard brother brandham say uh particularly if you listen to questions and answers 64 uh so there's no but there's no thus sayith the Lord on it um so we know it doesn't pertain to Salvation now another thing brother ramam said it was the Millennium was hard for him to understand how many remember that it was in uh questions answers uh part two they asked brother brandom I'd like to know more about the Millennium is it after the marriage supper or on the Earth all about it I don't understand about it brother Bram says well brother sister it's hard for me to understand it myself so this was a topic he was uh he would say the word presuming he was presuming about this topic uh for uh for certain things other things he got exactly right but I want you to see there's no thus sayith the Lord and it was hard for him to understand there's another quote where he says they asked brother brandom are there going to be children in the Millennium he says it it looks a lot like there will be he said but it looks like a lot that there won't be he said I don't know he said if the Lord lets me know I'll tell you Hallelujah so um I want to read this quote this is a beautiful quote Oh yeah sorry brother than sorry hopefully it wouldn't fall off the nail there by God's grace thank you Mal in the church age book chapter 7 brother Bram says the foolish virgin will miss the Millennium which you can be begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed so if you believe the Millennium was important before I think after tonight you're going to see it's more important than what you thought it was because that's what I found out when I started reading the scriptures and and it started connecting wow all these scriptures about they have the same idea All Nations coming to Worship in Jerusalem when I started reading these things I thought wow this is more important than I thought and then I found out it's more wonderful than I'd imagined so if you think the Millennium is going to be wonderful now wait till after this sermon hopefully it's more wonderful to you because hopefully you'll read new scriptures in a new light by the grace of God that's what I found as I've studied this I've put numerous hours into studying this so let me tell you this why is it so important I believe it's important because Eternal positions that God ordained for you and eternal purposes become reality in other words you become there what God always meant you to be MH here on this Earth sometimes it feels like there's disappointments doesn't it you know we can't maybe we don't accomplish what we think we should accomplish or uh you would you know you want good things to happen to Christians right you think oh my I just think this Christian they ought to they ought to have better than this or they ought to have a better life than that but in the Millennium everything is brought back to its original design the plan of God Amen God's Eternal position for you you'll have it there Hallelujah brother says your eternal purpose you'll have it there brother even says if you married the wrong one here he says you'll get the right one there now that goes back to whoever your spirit your soul was connected to in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Hallelujah like Adam and Eve their souls were one their souls were one spear right and then God broke them apart and they come back together so that's quite a thought and remember Church God's word does not return void whatever God's word promises you will receive it amen and it also brings this the light you know the Eternal position and purpose the Eternal position of Jesus's 12 Apostles was to rule and Reign Over The 12 Tribes of Israel MH and Jesus said they will have that in the Millennium imagine Peter will reign over one of the tribes maybe it's Manasseh maybe it's Ephraim you know maybe it's Judah Hallelujah but Peter will reign over one of those tribes he'll he'll uh rule over them and tell them what to do and where to live and and how to how to live and what their jobs will be Peter will rule over One Tribe because that's what God that's what God's purpose always was right God gave the Keys of the Kingdom but not just that there was eternal purpose behind that that he could rule over people in the Millennium praise God Amen God always saw Peter as a ruler as a leader Hallelujah although it didn't look like it when when he denied Christ three times right it didn't look like he was a real leader but the Bible said Jesus comes to wash us hallelujah and justify us and he comes to empower us and fill us with his Spirit praise God so see church here we might not look all the time uh uh how we're going to be in the Millennium but in the Millennium we'll have all the positions all the purposes all the rights and responsibilities we'll re be restored in the Millennium Hallelujah now why is it so wonderful because we'll witness this Earth the same Earth except with a new outside part right with a new renovation of the outward part new trees and new grass and new leaves and everything new plants and everything will witness the Earth and but will also see Fallen man ruled by Perfect Divine love the way it was originally meant to be that's why it's so wonderful we're going to see uh the the the Earth and the Earth Systems as it ought to be brother R said we he said when we get to Lum it's going to be just like we live now except no planes no automobiles none of these government buildings or something like that you know none of the uh none of the trains he said because we'll be able to travel like a thought praise God if you've got a glorified body amen hallelujah so it's so much more important than we can even think now and it's also so much more wonderful than we can even imagine now A Thousand Years where we'll never get tired we'll never run out of uh things to do we never feel bored how many looking forward to that praise God never you you'll never lack anything praise God you you and the Bible says in one place before you make a call now the Bible doesn't say this is to God or to a friend before you call the answer will come that's what I'm looking forward to Hallelujah I don't even got to ask for anything I just got to think about it and then there it is it's right there Hallelujah all this is better than any movie they could make Hallelujah we've seen lots of crazy movies you know well when we were Sinners not all of us you know thank God we've seen Lots some of us saw lots of movies but they cannot even come close to how wonderful the Millennium is going to be for Christ and his bride amen hallelujah now the inspiration came as I said since January I've been reading through Genesis now I'm in uh what I'm in now Rome Romans no I'm in 1 Corinthians and I'm just uh uh transferring all my favorite notes and bible studies like in my Bible over to my new Bible and I came across Zechariah 14 Isaiah 2 Isaiah 11 Isaiah 65 Jeremiah 3 Micah 4 I came across all these texts and something stuck out they all said all nations will flow into Jerusalem many nations will flow into Jerusalem the wolf will lie down with the lamb right we always we always see pictures of lions laying by Lambs but that's not the word of God the Bible says the wolf will lay down with the lamb so see how we even you know even people's art even artists need corrected by the word of God right they have one idea about uh the Millennium now it may be a lion lied down with a lamb but the Bible calls it a wolf so after reading all these things I was just blown away and uh I'll try to bring these out I'm going to briefly go through these uh Five Points what's the Millennium when is it how do we get there now the main one for me number four what happens during it I have so many uh new thoughts about that from the scriptures I want to share with you I think it'll encourage you by God's Grace cuz that's what we're living for how many living for the Millennium amen I'm I'm trying to re over sin now that I can re over cities later am if I can Reign Over the sin nature of Jesse Smith then Jesus promised me I'll at least re over one city Hallelujah if I'm a one Talent preacher then I maybe I'll get two cities in fact actually maybe I'll get two cities if I can just re over this one this one uh sin nature God will give me two cities to rule over by God's grace we see that's plain from the scripture Jesus doesn't lie he doesn't tell fables hallelujah amen he tells the truth now this is all review but brother B said the 1,000 year Millennium is the Everlasting righteousness on the earth this is one of the six purposes of Daniel's 70 weeks from Daniel 9:24 the six purposes are uh are determined okay to finish the transgression to make an end of sin to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in Everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and to anoint the most holy that's the six reasons Gabriel visited Daniel in Daniel chapter 9 the fourth reason was to bring in Everlasting righteousness that's the millenum amen so that's what it is it's Everlasting righteous now the people there's going to be all kinds of we'll see there's people from all over the world are going to cover this world and we're going to have to bring in righteousness if they won't do the righteous thing we'll get we'll make them do righteousness we'll make them because we'll be rulers Hallelujah and we've already proved we can rule right now so that's why Jesus can trust us there Hallelujah Amen to rule in righteousness make them do right now brother said Jesus think about this when Jesus was tempted three times by Satan the reason he didn't give in was because he knew he was going to fall air to the Millennium how many remember brother Bram saying that Jesus said I'm sorry Satan said he took Jesus on the mountain and said all these are mine he says I'll give them to you if you worship me and brother bam said Jesus said get behind me Satan he knew he was going to fall heir to them in the Millennium hallelujah amen see even Jesus overcame sin by looking to the Millennium and friends that's what we can do tonight we can overcome sin and we can think no I'm not going to fall to that because I want to rule in the Millennium amen I'm not going to compromise I'm not going to give in I'm not going to fall into this because I want to rule in the Millennium like my Lord amen hallelujah so Jesus used that as motivation oh he's trying to give me these kingdoms now but I don't want him in this condition I'm going to get him in there perfect condition hallelujah amen hallelujah brother R said the Millennium proves the price for sins has been paid brother Braham said the man that's going to live through the Millennium 1,000 years and it shows the penalty has been paid man lives forever because remember was it methusa was the one who lived the longest 969 years no man ever lived a thousand years but church if we're faithful if we overcome by the blood of the Lamb we will live longer than Methuselah and our bodies will never get old or tired Hallelujah because Jesus pray paid the price he paid the penalty for our sin and so we we receive his life and then he rewards us for living a life to glorify him and he rewards us with a Thousand-Year lifetime Hallelujah and then of course eternity after that Amen brother Ram said Jesus is the son of David he said and in the Millennium he'll sit on the throne of David Hallelujah and that's why the Bible said he's given the Key of David mhm or the responsibility of kingship during the Millennium brother said it's Jesus who bring in the Millennium after the battle of Armageddon Hallelujah brother Bram said in the Millennium he comes as son of David to set on the throne of David King so what was he remember on Earth he was prophet right now Jesus is priest but he's going to be king Hallelujah Prophet priest king son of man Son of God Son of David Hallelujah and then brother Bram says when he's in the Millennium he'll sit on his own Throne right now Jesus sits on his father's throne in heaven right Jesus said he that overcometh shall set with me on my Throne as I've overcome and set on my father's Throne isn't that amazing Jesus is on the father's Throne now but when he comes down here he sits on his own Throne Hallelujah because that's his reward that's his reward for overcoming sin he gets his own throne and church that's your reward too you get your own Throne you get to rule on this Earth and I don't know how it works out for sisters I don't know how it works out I don't know how it works out like that but the Bible says if you overcome you get to sit with him on his throne hallelujah amen so the Bible said in the Millennium he'll be son of David Hallelujah now brother also says the Millennium is the honeymoon they asked brother Bram will there be people on the Earth in Corporal bodies during that time of the Millennium yes sir we will have our glorified body eating drinking and building houses see I'm not going to build a house here I'm going to build a house there by God's grace as far as I know Hallelujah he said just he says just living just like we do now for a thousand years Hallelujah but there you know there's not going to be these mosquitoes around right I believe it by God's grace and if there are you got power over them Hallelujah you rule over there amen hallelujah so living think about that just like we live now except in a glorified body oh that's going to be wonderful praise God um and that's what I'm living for right that's what we're brother say that's what you're living for that's what you're dying for right you're dying so that you could be rebirthed in a brand new body Hallelujah reborn in a brand new body Hallelujah brother BR said the Millennium it's a th000 years it's a honeymoon for the bride and groom so again the Rapture is the wedding ceremony the Millennia I'm sorry then we go to the wedding supper in the sky the marriage supper of the Lamb then we come back down here for the honeymoon A Thousand Years with Christ hallelujah amen amen now that's all fam mear brother also says the Millennium is the seventh day there were six days of creation right the first day second third fourth uh fifth and then six but then the seventh was interrupted by sin so brother said God wants to get his day back he wants to get his his seventh day back and brother said it's going to be a thousand years it's called the Millennium so we get the seventh day back he teaches that in the future home if you want to look at that and then 2 Peter 3:8 says but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and the Thousand Years as one day think of that when we get done with a thousand years we'll say wow that was a great day I I can't wait for day number two right you get know with the Thousand Years and that's just day one Hallelujah I'm sorry yeah that's day one and then you go into the future home start day two and it's just an eternal day Hallelujah by the grace of God it's amazing this might be new to you brother said the Millennium typed the Feast of Tabernacles remember there seven uh seven feasts of Israel how many you remember that Passover was type by I'm sorry the Passover was a type the anti-type was the cross of Jesus unleavened bread was a type the literal thing was Jesus going down to Hell right to preach to the spirits in prison get the keys of death in Hell the third Feast was first fruits that was that was a type of Jesus resurrection the fourth is what we're in right now the Feast of Pentecost or the Feast of Weeks right that was the baptism of I'm sorry that was the day of Pentecost and the Fulfillment was the church ages amen sorry uh number five five was uh the Feast of trumpets that's a that's a uh that's fulfilled by the two Jewish prophets and then six is the day of atonement that's fulfilled by the 144,000 being sealed the seventh is the Feast of Tabernacles that's when they lived in the the tents for uh for for seven days and brother B said the Fulfillment of that is the Millennium amen and then the eth day after the the eth day after the seven days of Feast of Tabernacles brother Ram says that's the future home there's a whole convocation that's the future home where the pyramid shaped home comes down to earth Heaven and Earth is eternally United praise God amen amen my so beautiful so many wonderful teachings in here but I'm going through these fast because you've heard them probably over the years when is it brother M said the Millennium is after the battle of Armageddon because Armageddon cleanses the Earth for a thousand years hallelujah it's also a space of time brother Braham said time keeps going during the Millennium time is still kept track of and and as we're going to see there is sin during the Millennium now brother baham said there wasn't sin but remember he didn't have thus sayth the Lord on it but if you look at these scriptures there is sin during the Millennium but brother Bram does say there's sin after the Millennium so we know there's sin before we know there's sin after so uh no doubt there's sin during the Millennium as well and let me read that where brother Ram says that just so you got it I must have misplaced the quote but I'll find it here in just a moment by God's grace yeah it's in questions answers part three brother Ram said now the Millennium is not the new heavens and the new Earth there will still be sin after the Millennium so you know there's sin before the Millennium there's sin after the Millennium so no doubt the scriptures teach there's even sin during theum but it's not our sin right how many looking forward to that thousand years you never sin you never fall short of God's glory you're never ashamed no more guilt hallelujah amen no no no more questions no no more personal condemnation right nothing like that it's just perfect peace for a thousand years hallelujah amen now you you're all familiar with this you know uh in the Millennium or right right before the Millennium there's a a holy fire Peter says there's fervent heat the Earth burns with fervent heat it just burns the outside of the earth not the inside and then Malachi 4:1 let's now let's get your Bibles ready here now we're going about ready to start reading here by God's grace Caris you want to get Malachi 4:1 you want to turn there it's right before Matthew Mali 41 2 and 3 so after the battle of Armageddon Armageddon God looks at the Earth and it's like he's going to put the Earth in a oven you sisters know about the oven right gets pretty hot in those ovens amen you Brothers might too Caris you got it Malachi 4:1 can you read that for behold the day come that shall burn as an oven and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall you're stubble and the day that come shall burn them up the Lord of host that it them nean amen verse two go you want to read that verse two thank youto you that fear name ofng shall and his Cales of so he's talking about course to Israel now you know we know he's going to transfer over later in these next few verses to the spirit of Elijah that's not for tonight that's a message I've already preached before but notice Jesus is going to bring healing so he's going to bring fire all over the Earth it's going to burn like stubble like we we got a we got a pile of uh sticks back there and every time we burn it it's just a pile of Ashes right well the Earth is going to look like that after the battle of Armageddon but Jesus is going to rise upon the Earth and heal the earth oh it's going to be a beautiful thing verse three sister who would you want to read verse three and you shall tread down the r for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this amen Lord of host amen thank you sister Hallelujah so brother Ram says the the battle of Armageddon purges the Earth it cleans off the Earth so Jesus can step on the Earth right Jesus is not going to step on this Earth until it's burned over with fire and cleaned out remember he comes down he meets Us in the air he actually doesn't touch the Earth he purchased the Earth with his blood Hallelujah but he's not going to touch the Earth with his Corporal glorified body until the Earth is burnt over and all the sin is burned off it hallelujah amen amen now again I'm skipping a little bit here by God's grace now how do we get there this is very familiar you know this but you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your souls and then if you do that you will reign for a thousand years in the Millennium because when you have the Holy Ghost you'll overcome the Beast system remember you'll overcome His Image his mark his name you'll overcome uh the Beast system amen amen now Church you might not think that's a big thing but think about all these people that are trapped in denominational churches right uh you know I've seen different preachers you know they kiss the Pop's ring and they they bow down and kiss his feet and uh there's this one gentleman that had these Evangelical meetings 20,000 people there Lu angle was his name and he and he he apologized he brought these Catholic priests out there and he apologized for being against the Catholic church cuz they were Protestants and he literally kissed their shoes that was a number of years ago probably 5 or 10 years ago now but already but Mo see most people are going back to the be system right you saw Candace Owens she's going back to the be system all these people are going back to the mother Harlot so see there is something wonderful inside of you there's a power inside of you there's a spirit inside of you that won't let you unite or Unite with that Beast system why because the spirit of Christ is against the Beast it just right goes back to the beginning right it was uh Adam and Eve against the Beast right the serpent the battle with the serpent from the beginning is the same battle at the end we're still overcoming the Beast system Hallelujah but we do it by the spirit of God like brother man said the last Eve won't fall amen the first Adam and Eve fell but the last Eve won't hallelujah praise God she'll overcome amen because she's more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah okay so notice it doesn't matter you don't have to be beheaded to be there you just have to not worship the beast in other words you just have to worship Jesus Christ and have a testimony of the word of God and you have to avoid worshiping the Beast His Image his Mark in their foreheads and their hands that's all you've got to do now think about this even John the Revelator he wasn't beheaded and how many think he's going to be there amen some people think oh you got to be a martyr to be there no way you think God's going to keep John out of there right the Beloved the one who leaned on his bosom the one who wanted to be closer to Jesus than everybody else right of course not that's his beloved and so see brother man says these are just different descriptions however you however you overcome the Beast it doesn't matter as long as you overcome the Beast you'll be in the Millennium praise God hallelujah amen so he if John will be there and he died by natural causes we can be there too hallelujah hallelujah thank God they asked brother brandom is are are these part of the Bride past or future brother BR said they're the bride completely both past and now everybody say now ready now so brother brother Bram reads Revelation 20:4 and he says there the bride in the past and they're the bride right now hallelujah oh my it's beautiful now I have to SK skip some of these uh sister Lena do you want to read Romans 5:17 want to get that then Haven do you want to get um Haven 2 Timothy 2:12 Romans 5:17 2 Timothy 2:12 whenever you're ready sistera uh uh Romans 5:17 4 517 yes for If by one's man offense death by one more they which receive abundance of Grace and of gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ amen so how do we reign in life Jesus has given us go I'm sorry given us a gift of righteousness that's the holy spirit amen right how are you righteous not by your righteousness by God's righteousness right so how do we get there we got to have the Holy Ghost and that means you reign in this life by one Jesus Christ amen right and you remember when you were a sinner sin reigned over you right the Bible said sin Reed over your mortal body did it not yeah and if you're you know if you remember that well then praise God now you can see sin doesn't Reign Over man anymore I Reign Over sin amen I'm bringing my body in the subjection to the word of God hallelujah Glory so that's another way to say it right there that's another way to say how you overcame the Beast system you reigned in this life over sin and then Haven 2 Timothy 2:12 H whenever you're ready if we SE if we suffer we shall also re with him if we deny him he will also deny us amen praise God so how can we reign with Christ we have to suffer with him right so that God is going to bring us through sufferings it's not all uh pleasantries right brother man said we're when we came a Christian we didn't come to a picnic he's saying he said we came to a battlefield how many understand that by God's grace and sometimes we go through trials we think why am I going through trials did I do something wrong well it could be or it could be God has just training your character to suffer so you can Reign Hallelujah cuz that's what he says you have to suffer in order to Reign now we see it in America with rejection of our family that's where we often see it like I often use brother amen as an example he's rejected he's kicked out of his house I mean that's truly suffering uh for for being a Christian right and now some of us we may suffer with natural sickness some of us may suffer with other things but the point is God's going to let us suffer but I love what you know Haven shared with me in Lydia isaah 43 I'm going to turn there real quick I love what they shared we are going to suffer but look what God promised if he promises to Israel how much more the bride verse uh Isaiah 432 when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee amen and through the rivers they shall not overflow the ever feel like life's going to overflow you and you're going to drown in all your all your busyness and all your trials ever feel like that God said I'll be with you when you walk through the fire Thou shalt not be burned sound like sounds like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego amen hallelujah neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee Hallelujah now verse five fear not for I am with thee verse 7even says for I've created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him so this is the scripture that really encouraged me when I was going through my threats that I had to receive maybe that's a suffering Hallelujah I don't know I I I felt like I suffered that's for sure okay so I just put that in there that reminded me of that verse there so we reign in this life we suffer in order to Reign we have to have the right character so the only way you can have real character is to suffer difficult times then you'll know how to act when those things happen again amen you might fail the first time but by God's grace you won't fail the second time hallelujah amen I'll know when I'll know the next time when that comes around hallelujah amen we sit with Jesus and we judge the Bible said we'll judge angels will judge the world to him that overcometh Revelation 3:21 will I grant to sit with me in my Throne hallelujah amen and then Revelation 24 again they lived and reigned with Christ A Thousand Years Hallelujah because they overcame during their lifetime now here is the most wonderful part of the sermon hopefully by God's grace get your Bibles ready I'm going to need some Bible readers here by God's grace what happens during the Millennium now I've already said some of them the first thing is we the the uh sorry the most holy place is Anointed amen the second third things they have to bury all the soldiers from Armageddon remember uh Russia China are listed in there uh the the 10 tyrants of the earth so probably North Korea some other ones in there Syria probably uh and then they got to burn the weapons so think about all these tanks right we see these tanks and planes they have to burn those during the Millennium going to be a lot of fire right right it's the Bible says it's going to take years to burn their planes and all their guns years and then this is for you and I we're going to build plant and inhabit and then we're also going to be part of some worldwide worship Services by God's grace oh my I can't wait for that Hallelujah again I want to be on the side where brother Brooks is leading songs okay brother Brooks and brother amen by God's gra Hallelujah so what does anoint the most holy mean it means Jesus comes in and he sits on the new Millennial Temple in Jerusalem in the holiest of holies but Church don't fret there's no veil in that Temple Hallelujah cuz the veil's already been torn hallelujah amen so we'll be able to approach the throne of God we'll go from the outer Court the inner court and we'll see Jesus in the holiest of holies hallelujah amen now we'll already have an exalted position we're already Kings and Priests unto God right we'll have a way weigh in we'll just have a a way in there already now the Sinners they have a different process they actually have to bring animal sacrific we're going to see in the scripture if you haven't read Ezekiel 40 40-48 read that you'll see all these things that Heathen have to do in order to worship amen it's the end of Ezekiel the last chapter is 48 so Ezekiel 40 to 48 and brother R said any Bible reader knows that's the millennial Temple and I I felt bad brother Austin I I didn't know that I thought I was a Bible reader I realized I'm not really a Bible reader in other words I'm just a young Christian well brother said any reader should know that well I'm not much of a reader then by God's grace he's going to help me though amen hallelujah so we'll probably skip over that one um brother bam said notice anoint the most holy brother said Jesus is already anointed how many know that acts 10:38 already said Jesus is Anointed was anointed with the Holy Ghost and power to do signs wonders and miracles Jesus don't need anointing it's the temple that needs anointing amen and that Temple gets anointed when Jes Jesus comes in he says he says Jesus is already anointed is that right the book of Acts said that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the most holy place is a sanctuary where God lived between the cherubims and this time Christ will set in the most holy place with the anointing on him oh my hallelujah praise God so if you haven't read it brother said any reader knows that from Ezekiel the 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter is nothing in the world but the Millennium temple being erected on Earth anyone knows that see yes sir brother BR that's right anyone knows it well that that's that's perfect because I'm I'm a nobody right anyone knows that well I'm no one so that that fits me by God's grace now I showed you this a while ago uh let me see if I can just show it to you Ezekiel Temple looks like that I mean it's I'm not you're not going to be able to see it very long but it's just a it's a massive massive Temple because all the nations of the earth need to have time to come in there worship and sacrifice and it's much larger than um any other Temple so here I'll Point down here in the green is a American football field and that's the Ezekiel Temple remember this picture I showed it about a year ago so how many football fields can you get in there probably like 10 that's a football field and then that's the millennial Temple just imagine how large that is how many thousands of people football field ezekiel's Temple that's in uh Ezekiel 40-48 so the green one is American football field and that's the millennial Temple just the massive size of that Hallelujah and in their Church you're a priest amen and the church said right you don't have to be born out of Levi you just got to be born from Heaven hallelujah praise God amen amen it don't matter your natural birth doesn't matter your spiritual birth is all the that matters Hallelujah you get to be a part of that a priest unto God that Millennial Temple is only 750 ft wide anybody remember how many miles wide uh the length is of the New Jerusalem 1,500 miles wide so the millennial Temple is only 750 ft I like to measure that out sometime maybe after service I'll measure that after but the New Jerusalem so it's it's only 14 % of one mile right but the New Jerusalem is 1,500 mil length of it right brother man' said it's from Maine to Florida that's just one side of the of the new of the New Jerusalem Temple praise God hallelujah so there's no comparison how great that is okay now got your Bibles there let's read about bearing soldiers and bearing weapons here uh who would like to read here sister Z you want to read that sister Z do you want to go to Ezekiel 399 and then I'll give sister uh H I'll give you a verse there sister why don't you go to Isaiah 65 sister haa uh 6517 and then sister Zur Ezekiel 399 so let's first read about bearing bodies and bearing weapons so sister Zer could you read N9 and 10 yeah and they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the Shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the hand stades and the Spears and they shall burn them with fire seven years so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forces for they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoil them and Rob those that Rob them sayeth the Lord God Amen verse 12 look if you skip down to verse 12 I'll read that and seven months shall be the house of Israel be bearing of them that they may cleanse the land s years of just burning the weapons and seven months of bearing the bodies right so God's not just God's not just going to send down Holy Fire and burn up all the the Russians or the Chinese or the I don't think a miracle will be existing at that time but in other words anyone who comes against anyone in the B system who comes against Christ God's not just going to burn them up with fire right some of their bodies will be stubbled but they still got to bury those right the Bible said the be a stubble they still have to bury them they're going to have something to do right they got to they got to live right they got to inhabit they got to start all over right all right thank you sisters there now here is uh remember brother man said living just like we do now we get to live now I'm sorry however we live now we're going to live there except in a perfect condition a holy condition all the time Hallelujah so sister here's where we see um a lot of things in here why don't you read uh 171 18 to 19 sister for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people of joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crime amen we know Jerusalem and Israel's is not in a happy condition right now right because of all the war but God promised it will be a rejoicing City Hallelujah there will be happiness there and did you catch that in verse 17 we won't remember this world right we won't remember uh the United States of America and all their corruption or all the corruption in Ghana right we won we won't remember all these corrupt systems anymore uh it'll be out of our mind we'll just have an awareness of this is Jesus's Kingdom hallelujah we're a part of the the most high God we're a part of his kingdom we're Kings over the land we're priests unto God Amen Hallelujah praise God look at verse 20 there shall be no more than an infant of days nor an old man that shall not fill his days so see there's not going to be an infant who dies or an old man that doesn't get to live out his years see this for the child shall die 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be accursed so see uh it seems like the least of amount of time a person will live will be 100 that's what it seems like from the scripture so God's going to protect them and give them good lives remember they they got good rulers to rule over them praise God hallelujah they got good rulers maybe good doctors by God's grace I mean whatever whatever Eternal knowledge God equips us with all the children will live to a 100 Hallelujah and if now look a sinner and if a if a sinner dies if a sinner dies 100 years old it's going to be like they're cursed oh what happened they only got to live a 100 we had thousand years right they had a thousand years to live verse 21 they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them hallelujah it's not going to be any uh sinful animals taking our produce right they're not going to sweep in here and take all our Gardens that all the garden that you planted by God's grace no if you build it you're going to live in it if you plant it you're going to harvest it praise God it's going to be just the way God intended it how you looking forward to that by God's grace think of a house Caris hav think of a house you can build it by God's grace you got a thousand years to do it praise God hallelujah verse 22 they shall not build and another inhabit thank God no one's going to take over my house they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands thousand years you get to enjoy your property for a thousand years Hallelujah long enjoy oh this is the best place I've always said I I love mountains I like some mountains and I like a lake or I don't know if it going to be Lake but I sure would like a lake I guess I could build one by God's grace or dig one I could dig one verse 23 they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble see nothing's going to be wasted everything you do is going to be perfect LED of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them Hallelujah Malachi Jen Zion all the rest of mine you're going to be there with me Hallelujah my seed my Offspring Hallelujah here it is verse 24 and it shall come to pass that before they call I'll answer amen I would say I need some Timber I'll go and it'll already already be here thank God Amen Hallelujah before I even call Brother Austin he'll already answer Jess what do you want to talk about Hallelujah see while they're speaking I will hear Hallelujah am so even even fellowshipping with the Lord right now that's amazing grace right there wanting to wan to fellowship with God or talk to the Lord or ask the Lord a question I'll reach out to call it's just like you know your cell phone you're going to pick up your phone oh his answer is already there you got right even even before you can text you already got the answer there by God's grace oh it's beautiful verse 25 the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the Bullocks I think that's why they put the lion by the lamb because it's in the same scripture and dust shall be the Serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain sayeth the Lord and the church said amen a that beautiful now here's one that was brand new to me so uh uh Haven you got some reading there wait did I did you read already sister did I okay you did oh thank you sorry I don't want to skip anybody and brother Aus you got a Bible brother yeah got okay all right so brother a why don't you get Zechariah 14:16 Zechariah right before Matthew find Matthew it's a book right before that I'm sorry two books before that Malachi Zechariah 14:16 you said Zechariah 14 sir yep Zechariah 14:16 so as I was reading these last you know six months I've been reading through the Old Testament and everything I kept coming across these same thoughts about going up to Jerusalem to worship so brother could you read uh 16 17 and 18 yeah um and it shall come to pass that everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles and shall be that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of hosts even upon them shall be no rain and if the family of Egypt go not up and come not that have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will Smite the Heathen that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles amen how many are shocked by that statement there there's going to be parts of the world that that I wonder if we'll control it right because Jesus controlled nature there'll be parts of the world that will not receive rain because they don't come up to worship Jesus now friends this has not been fulfilled yet right this was written uh what's the verse there 14 well this must have been what 400 years before Christ yeah almost 500 years before Christ you know after this Israel never had a king that everybody Came To Worship it hasn't been fulfilled this has to be the Millennium this has to be Jesus the king and did you see that in verse 16 everyone that's left of all the nations so there's some people you know those movies about living through armor gedon bright brother Austin you that's that's from the Bible that's that's real some people are when God burns the Earth over maybe they got their maybe they're camped in the ground I don't know who knows maybe they're in caves the Bible said they'll be in caves some of them will be in caves calling out from calling out to the lamb but some of them there's going to be some people left over and they're going to just walk out into ashes right and they're going to see Jesus heal the Earth and heal the Nations Hallelujah and no no notice there'll be no rain if you don't go up to worship Jesus and there's going to be plagues now Egypt's going to get a good reminder of plagues they already got some plagues Hallelujah Jesus is going to give them some more plagues because they don't come to worship yeah right and now look at verse 19 this shall be what the punishment see there's punishments during the Millennium because there's rulers and if you don't follow the rulers you get punished this is the right way the Earth should have always been and the punishment of all Nations that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles All Nations see the whole world imagine that the whole world is going to be required to come and travel to Jerusalem verse 20 in that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses Holiness unto the Lord look we're going back to the horse and buggy days hallelujah amen and the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bows before the altar I don't know what that means but verse 21 yay every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be Holiness under the Lord oh they'll all be set aside that's right for Holy purposes won't anybody be getting drunk there Hallelujah and notice and all they that sacrifice so look animal sacrifices so as much as we love our animals right there's going to be some animal sacrifices God is going to reinstitute this so the heathens of the earth understand what Jesus did for them right it's going to be a lital that's going to be a type in Shadow and that there's the antitype right there Jesus Christ and they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and see therein and in that day there shall be no more of the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts so I don't know what that means maybe God destroys that whole nation you know in the M I'm sorry in the battle of Armageddon I don't know that's a good thought I'm at 46 minutes so you're doing a good job here by God's grace all right next one is Isaiah chapter 2 so Lena do you want to read that Isaiah 2 and then Haven Jeremiah 3 so Isaiah 2 and Jeremiah 3 then nature get your Bible ready by God's grace uh sister lenina it's Isaiah 2 verse one the word that the word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw concering Judah and Jerusalem why don't you read down to verse can you read all the way through four Y and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalt exalted above the hills and All Nations shall flow unto it and many people shall go and say Come Ye let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the L to the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach us his ways and we will walk in his path for out of Z shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord the Lord from Jerusalem and he shall judge among nations and shall re rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their Spears into pruning hooks hooks Nations shall not lift up the Nations shall not lift up sword against Nation neither shall they learn for anymore amen thank you sister verse five says oh House of Jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of Lord that's where we get that song we walk in the light such a beautiful light now we do it spiritually when we confess our sins the Bible says spiritually walk in the light right but here is the literal light we'll walk in the light of Jesus Christ the light of his glory shining upon the Nations Hallelujah so see verse two said all the nations will flow into this this I I show you that Ezekiel house 750 ft wide all the nations shall flow and they got to go out a separate door the Bible said they can't go in the same door they came Hallelujah that's a good type there in other words like church you shouldn't leave the same way you came to church right right if you're down or discouraged don't leave that way hallelujah it's a great literal uh fulfillment of what we experience spiritually praise God Amen I'm not going to leave here discouraged I'm not going to leave here depressed I'm not going to leave here sad I'm not going to leave here in sin I'm going to leave here purified by the blood of Christ Hallelujah not going to go out the same way I came in and notice he he has to teach them their ways in verse three he has to teach these Heathen Nations that made it through Armageddon he's got to teach them their ways and the and out of Zion shall go forth the law Zion's been hearing his name in all the songs he's been getting excited about that you got a powerful name Buddy Hallelujah Mount Zion city of the great king hallelujah amen so he's got to teach from his Temple he's got to give the law so the people know the law and notice he shall judge them and you catch that that she read in verse four rebuke many people so Jesus Will rebuke many people I imagine we will too because the Bible said we'll rule with a rod of iron in other words we'll slam down that Rod right this is how it's going to be we'll rule with a rod of iron and then no more Wars by God's grace amen thank you sister wonderful reading Haven Jeremiah 3:16 And1 17 can you read just those two verses and it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land in those days sayth the Lord they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord neither shall it come to mind neither neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall they be done neither shall that be done anymore at that time they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem neither shall they walk anymore after the imaginations of their evil heart amen wonderful this was not fulfilled in Jeremiah's day right because they still wanted the Ark of the Covenant even today the temple Institute that's the name of the Jews who trying to get ready for the Third Temple right they're getting the red heer ready they even have uh an arc of the Covenant even current Jews have an arc of the Covenant but Jeremiah said they're going to no more say the Arc of of the Covenant why because the king is there Hallelujah they don't need the presence of God in an ark because Jesus is the ark Hallelujah he is the presence of God Hall hallelujah amen they won't need an ark they'll have Christ Hallelujah remember all nations again look at all these look at these phrases all the nations shall be gathered into they all come to the throne of God there in Jerusalem amen now nature Micah Micah might be hard to find there Micah chapter 4 and then Caris Isaiah 11 Micah 4 and then Isaiah 11 obadi Jonah Micah obadi Jonah Micah n Caris 11 uh Isaiah 11 okay sharing the Bible amen Micah 4 verse1 you got it yeah you read uh Micah 41 and2 for in the last days it shall come to pass that in the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the H and people it and many nations shall come and say come let us go up into the mountain of the Lord and up to the house of God of of the god of Jacob and he shall and he will teach us his way his ways and we go forth of s and the Jem awesome everybody see the same thoughts Jerusalem flowing All Nations worshiping learning the word of God everybody see that all the same thoughts as all these other verses isn't it awesome how God scattered this truth all over the Old Testament it's scattered all over there but as I was reading just this year I came across all these and wrote them down in a notepad I'm like this is a sermon right here hallelujah this is our future amen we are going to see this Hallelujah not somebody else our eyes will see it praise God verse three and he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong Nations a far off look at that Jesus is going to rebuke all the nations far from Jerusalem like maybe North America right South America Australia all these nations far off from Jerusalem Jesus Will rebuke them from his throne because they don't come to worship Him and they shall beat the swords into plow shears and their Spears into pruning hooks remember Lena read that pruning hooks Nations shall not lift up a sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore but they shall sit every man under his Vine and under his fig tree think of that think about that you're going to find your tree you're going to find your Vineyard and you're just going to go sit under there and enjoy it amen you're going to take a few minutes off by God's grace and None Shall make them afraid look at that you'll never be afraid Hallelujah there'll be no fear there because Jesus is King amen for the mouth of the lord of the hosts has spoken it for all people will walk everyone in the name of his God and we will walk in the name of our Lord Our God forever and ever because remember at the end of this Thousand Years Satan's going to deceive almost everybody on the earth so see they might even have their own Gods right but just keep them secret but if they don't come up and worship they might be worshiping their gods if they don't come up and worship they're going to have no reain they're going to have plagues Hallelujah so again no need for the ark the king is there and then remember Satan will deceive them all at the end that's Revelation 20:8 and bring them to Gog and Magog all right great reading nature um all right Caris Isaiah 11 verse6 can you read uh 678 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the Cal and the Young Lion in the fing fatling fatling together and a little child shall Le them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones and shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like an A and the sucking child shall on cockatrice cockatrice that's a snake so there you see suckling child you see there's infants in the Millennium still nursing there's wean children that just get done nursing in the Millennium right so there's birth in the Millennium right there's babies in the Millennium there's little toddlers in the Millennium Hallelujah they're multiplying right it's a time to be fruitful and multiply right in a perfect world hallelujah amen and a little child shall lead a young lion and a fatling together well Haven we might get to ride lions in the Millennium Hallelujah we might we've always talked about riding a lion you know because of asand and Narnia we might get to do it we'll lead them at least the children will lead the lions in the Millennium the the Young Lion verse look at verse n they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea hallelujah amen oh my God's word is going to be everywhere amen everyone's going to know the word of God either they're going to accept it and Obey and come and worship or they're going to reject it and suffer punishments rebukes and plagues Hallelujah so here notice church here today people can it seems like they're getting away with all their sins right if any place should have plagues it's California New York right Chicago yet they still got water and they still got you know they should have plague upon plague but that's cuz this is a corrup kingdom Hallelujah but the coming Kingdom Hallelujah All rights all wrongs will be made right Hallelujah every punishment will be poured out instantly right if they don't come and worship no Reign plagues punishment rebuke because it's the right kind of civilization brother Bram says amen it's not a Unholy civilization it's a holy civilization brother said there will not be this kind of a civilization in the world to come there will be no automobiles or nothing that science has ever done there will be no such things in the world that is to come but it will be God's Own type of civilization that he'll set up in his glorious Reign Hallelujah that's from God's power to transform 1965 amen oh I love [Music] it yeah I want to read that quote for you just so you can see it or here brother brand says yes uh brother brandom okay let me sorry oh yeah brother br will there be children during the Thousand Years of the Millennium Reign that's the question in my mind that I told you the other day I don't know it looks a whole lot like it could be it looks a whole lot like it couldn't be I'm going to be as honest with you as I know how to be I don't know at this time I don't know whether there'll be there will be or whether there not be I can't say hallelujah see there brother Ram was learning right he's going by the scripture he's seeing all these scriptures but he doesn't know for sure but as as as I've showed you I've showed you how many verses and you know and all these Micah Jeremiah and Isaiah Zechariah all these Witnesses they all say the same thing right and so we can see there's going to be birth there's going to be death there's going to be sin but there's going to be a holy righteous Everlasting Kingdom Hallelujah I'm trying to find a place to close here by God's grace so just in summary there's there's births there's death there's Sinners there's children there's families there's infants there's marriage if you want to write this down Ezekiel 44 says Israel is going to have natural people too and uh the priests have to marry certain type of women right remember that Ezekiel 44:22 so Israelis the 12 tribes remember they're getting ruled over by the TW Apostles there'll be animal sacrifices Ezekiel 42 Ezekiel 43 Ezekiel 44 Ezekiel 46 the Millennium will have survivors from Armageddon we read that the Millennium will have plagues as punishment the TW Apostles will judge the 12 tribes that's Matthew 19:28 Israel's priests will judge the Earth as well Ezekiel 4046 and 44 24 there will be a time for burnings of weapons and burials from Armageddon we saw that there will be answers before we call Hallelujah there'll be Saints ruling up to 10 cities with rods of iron in glorified bodies that's Luke 19:17 Revelation 2:26 and 27 Romans 8:30 cu the Bible said he whom God is Justified God is already glorified amen how many Justified here tonight if you're Justified you've already promised I've got a glorified body waiting for me and that's how you'll Reign during the Millennium in a glorified body remember Jesus glorified body it walked through walls in John 2019 the Bible said they shut the doors for fear and then the Bible said Jesus appeared to them so he just walked through the wall then also he showed himself down at the Sea of Galilee right and he ate the fish they said he said have you hear any meat oh there's a deer out there there's some good meat out there amen hallelujah have you any meat and they gave Jesus some fish and Jesus ate the fish right in a glorified body so that's what we'll have we'll have glorified body we still get to enjoy the tastiness of nature Hallelujah right talk about organic food there Hallelujah we have some real real organic food there by God's grace no man's science and they're not even going to not going to come to their mind Hallelujah and friends no more Ark of the Covenant because the Lord is there in fact that's the final verse of Ezekiel 48: 35 said they're going to say no more uh we going to go no more the Ark of the Lord because the Lord is there Jesus is there in the holiest of holies amen oh we're looking forward to that by God's grace let me find a place to close here I've read you this quote before but listen here chapter 6 Church age book brother Ram reads the verses about how we'll have rods of iron he will have power over the Nations think about that some of the Saints I imagine Paul will have power over Nations Paul because he sacrificed more than anybody brother Ram says he that who keeps doing his Works Faithfully Until the End see Church don't give up when times get hard don't don't stop doing the right thing always do the right thing because brother R said if you keep keep Faithfully doing it until the end you'll be given power over Nations even if nobody else does it in the church you keep doing what's right now hopefully our church will do what's right right I'm just saying if nobody else does right you do right because you're you're going to be given power over Nations and brother B said you'll be a strong capable unbending ruler brother says who can cope so powerfully with any situation right so if a 100-year old dies you can you'll know right what to do in that situation right if if a if a family won't go up and worship you'll know right what to do in that situation because God's given he's already given you that Authority he's giv you that anointing and a glorified body but the way you get that is to do what's right right now amen keep doing what's right remember Jesus said increase your works that's how that's the secret of Christianity keep increasing your Works don't do less for Jesus try to increase it Hallelujah brother said even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be by you in the Millennium the most desperate enemy right Egypt right because Egypt's going to deserve plagues some some Christians are going to have to deal with Egypt and call plagues on them see but you'll have the character that's proven God will be able to trust your character because he can trust you right now amen right his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very Son of God brother man said this is very amazing he says amen my unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain that's the reason for this is that character simply never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift Hallelujah a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule amen we just saw another Mega preacher this week fall into some sin and he had he's been pastoring 48 years he has a worldwide Ministry all over the radio internet and he had he said I had a sinful uh sinful act years ago but it wasn't illegal so that tells us what it was it was probably adultery or something like that and after 48 years of everybody looking to him he's this leader he falls see he doesn't have the character right right he doesn't have the character he might have had it for a few for a number of years but at some point his character uh it failed cuz he wasn't born again he lets his daughter preach his daughter's a preacher see that's not character that's fit to rule right a woman is to be silent right according to the word of God see this just again provu us no matter how big a kingdoms these people have or big influence what matters is Christlike character Hallelujah Jesus is watching Hallelujah and see a man that does have the real Holy Ghost his you know that that satanic influence is going to catch up to him it's going to catch up and brother mam said he won't be sitting on the father's throne but we want to have the character where Jesus can trust us to sit on the throne hallelujah amen Amen brother Braham said all wrongs will be made right in the Millennium so if anyone's ever done you wrong if anything's happened that's wrong in this case he's talking about marriage if anything's been done wrong he said all wrongs will be made right there that's why this is such an important time Hallelujah if we can do everything everything in our power now to follow Christ he'll make everything right there we'll have the our ordained position our ordained Authority everything God ordained us to be we'll fulfill it in that land in the Millennium amen hallelujah all right let me see anything else here I want to bring out I think that's it let's stand to our feet by God's grace did you enjoy that hour and five minutes that wasn't too long Hallelujah I preach I preach hour and a half Thursday night at at Junction City by God's grace God bless you all
