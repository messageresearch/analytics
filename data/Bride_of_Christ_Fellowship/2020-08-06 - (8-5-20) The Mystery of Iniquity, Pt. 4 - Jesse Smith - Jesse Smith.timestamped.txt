[23:22] i forgot to let simon know so if the
[23:24] baby does come soon
[23:26] we'll listen to a tape on sunday
[23:29] uh so let's go to ephesians 2 by god's
[23:34] grace
[23:38] let me get my text here ephesians 2
[23:41] verse 1. now we're looking at church how
[23:44] iniquity starts
[23:46] we saw it started in satan then it went
[23:48] to uh the serpent then to cain
[23:52] and then the attributes of satan and
[23:54] kane
[23:55] and then we're looking at we started
[23:57] just sunday morning on how
[23:59] it gets into the minds of people and
[24:02] that's how iniquity starts it's got to
[24:04] get in the mind
[24:06] so let's look at verse one i'll just
[24:08] read one and two
[24:10] and you have the quickened who were dead
[24:12] in trespasses and sins
[24:14] wherein in time past you walked
[24:17] according to the course of the world
[24:20] according to the prince of the power of
[24:23] the air
[24:24] that spirit that now worketh so see what
[24:27] is it
[24:27] what is it that works in sinners it's a
[24:29] spirit that works in them
[24:31] see spirits work right just like the
[24:34] holy spirit works
[24:36] in you and i amen but in when we were
[24:39] sinners
[24:40] the demon spirits worked in us we did
[24:42] the works
[24:43] of the enemy the works of darkness
[24:47] the spirit that now worketh in the
[24:49] children of disobedience
[24:51] among whom also we all had our
[24:53] conversation in times past
[24:55] in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[24:58] desires of the flesh
[24:59] and of the mind see that's where you
[25:02] that's a great revelation
[25:04] uh forgot about it already how the mind
[25:06] has desires too
[25:07] your soul has a thirst a holy thirst
[25:09] desire your mind has desires your flesh
[25:12] has desires
[25:13] and you've got to control all of it amen
[25:15] but see we're more than conquerors
[25:16] because greater is he that's in us
[25:18] than he that's in the world so we can
[25:20] control all these desires
[25:22] thank god and we're by nature the
[25:25] children of wrath
[25:27] even as others but god who's rich in
[25:29] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[25:31] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[25:33] hath quickened us together with christ
[25:35] by grace are ye saved let's go to
[25:39] matthew chapter six thank god for grace

[28:20] god
[28:23] i do want to just show a quick visual
[28:24] acacia so if you can switch over here i
[28:26] appreciate that
[28:32] i just want to do a simple little uh
[28:35] visual right right there i don't know
[28:39] that's from a video game i think but i
[28:40] don't play video games but
[28:41] that's a fortress from a video game so i
[28:44] don't know if you knew that but that's
[28:45] the scripture we're going to get to this
[28:46] here in just a little bit
[28:47] uh by the grace of the lord so this is
[28:50] it's i tell you church it's just
[28:52] continually opening and uh
[28:53] i think the gospel don't you believe
[28:55] becomes more simple all the time
[28:57] uh it becomes just more more clear amen
[29:00] um
[29:01] you know the world is mixed in confusion
[29:03] god is not the author of confusion
[29:05] message people if they're really
[29:07] following the holy spirit should not get
[29:09] more confused
[29:10] as the time goes on they should be less
[29:12] confused amen
[29:15] they should have a transformed mind amen
[29:18] of course we know we won't have every
[29:19] single answer we won't know every single
[29:21] detail like i don't even know if the
[29:22] earth is flat or not
[29:24] if it's round i don't know if the the
[29:26] astronauts made it to moon or not
[29:28] but it doesn't matter because i know
[29:30] christ made it past the moon praise god
[29:32] hallelujah that's what i'm saying we've
[29:34] already got one out
[29:35] astronaut in space it's jesus christ
[29:39] amen amen
[29:40] enoch and elijah jesus christ amen
[29:43] so what does it really matter what do
[29:45] those things really have to matter with
[29:47] the gospel you know different men were
[29:48] challenging me this week online and i'm
[29:50] like
[29:50] does it even matter we got one astronaut
[29:52] that's in faith or that's in heaven
[29:54] and that's jesus christ the son of god
[29:57] and that's the only thing i'm really
[29:58] worried about praise god
[29:59] is getting uh to the throne of god not
[30:01] whether we get to mars or not
[30:03] or not whether there's a mars rover i
[30:05] don't know if you saw but they
[30:07] they launched something on saturday
[30:08] called perseverance did you see that
[30:10] they launched a a space shuttle out of
[30:13] florida called perseverance
[30:14] and it was searching for signs of life
[30:16] and i thought how striking
[30:18] that the world is saying perseverance we
[30:21] must be persevere to find signs of life
[30:24] amen
[30:24] and god is sending up you know word
[30:27] after word after word looking for the
[30:28] light we're looking for people that want
[30:30] to serve him amen
[30:32] it is god's perseverance that's sending
[30:34] out his word looking
[30:35] for worshipers who worship him in spirit
[30:38] and in truth
[30:39] amen oh god thank god amen that god is
[30:42] persevering church
[30:44] and he's still sending out his word and
[30:46] looking for signs of life i'm so glad he
[30:49] found mine
[30:49] amen now let's look at this thought
[30:53] how do people become workers of iniquity
[30:56] they open their mind to demons
[30:59] right and demons cause them to work
[31:04] disobedience the bible says that okay so
[31:06] in other words
[31:07] evil spirits in evil minds
[31:11] complete evil works right evil spirits
[31:14] cause
[31:15] humans to do evil works uh now
[31:18] the the opposite is true the holy spirit
[31:22] in holy minds
[31:24] produce holy works amen because paul
[31:26] said in galatians 5
[31:28] 6 faith faith works by love amen amen
[31:33] so faith works by love praise god now
[31:35] we're gonna get to this in just a moment
[31:37] here now remember all your mind body and
[31:40] soul
[31:40] all have desires and you are the one
[31:43] who's in charge of it praise god you and
[31:46] i have to daily crucify
[31:48] the desires of the body and mind so that
[31:51] the soul
[31:52] your the nature of your being uh can
[31:55] actually
[31:56] live and express itself praise god
[32:00] so we are in a constant battle
[32:03] uh to crucify the mind of the lust of
[32:06] the mind right
[32:07] and then the the lust of the flesh it's
[32:09] a constant battle but the bible says in
[32:11] galatians 5 24
[32:13] they that are christ have crucified the
[32:16] flesh
[32:17] with the affections and lust amen
[32:20] so you'll know the real children of god
[32:22] by the
[32:24] the works that they crucify in their
[32:26] bodies amen amen
[32:28] so the works that they don't do proves
[32:30] they're christians amen amen
[32:32] the sinful works but the godly works
[32:34] that they do prove to the children of
[32:36] god
[32:36] amen see it's very clear though
[32:40] the true believer is obedient to the
[32:42] holy thirst
[32:44] in their soul and it causes them to cast
[32:47] down
[32:47] all the all the strongholds of the mind
[32:50] that satan tries to build up
[32:53] now uh the scripture that says it is
[32:55] second corinthians 10 4. i'm just going
[32:57] to read it
[32:57] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[33:00] carnal
[33:01] but mighty through god to the pulling
[33:04] down
[33:05] of strongholds amen praise god so satan
[33:08] tries to build up what we know
[33:10] as complexes a complex is another word
[33:14] is for
[33:14] it's a mental reaction right it's an
[33:16] automatic mental reaction you have
[33:19] is a complex but it also means a
[33:20] building right this is a complex
[33:23] so satan is building up complexes or
[33:25] he's trying to build
[33:27] complexes and fortresses in our mind
[33:31] right and the only thing that can
[33:34] cast it down is the word of god
[33:38] amen and brother said he said uh he said
[33:40] you have the strongest weapon he said in
[33:42] this battle against satan
[33:44] he said he said god's word is like a
[33:46] sword he said he said but
[33:48] faith he said in the word is even
[33:51] greater
[33:52] he said faith in the word is like an
[33:54] atomic bomb praise god
[33:56] amen now picture just an atomic bomb
[34:00] hitting a stronghold that satan sets up
[34:03] in your mind
[34:04] will there be any stones left no sir
[34:06] they'd all be annihilated they all go to
[34:08] death
[34:09] praise god because the the extreme power
[34:13] and the extreme fire the extreme light
[34:16] of the atomic bomb praise god and
[34:18] brother ram said that's what he said the
[34:19] greatest battle ever fault
[34:20] he said don't just try to shoe him away
[34:23] send god's power
[34:24] the atomic bomb he said faith is an
[34:27] atomic bomb faith is assured
[34:30] a revelation and that will destroy any
[34:33] evil thoughts praise god
[34:34] and that will set you free it will cast
[34:36] down the stronghold in your mind
[34:38] and allow you to serve god with your
[34:40] mind
[34:42] amen see ephesians 4 27 says neither
[34:45] give
[34:46] place to the devil church remember the
[34:48] devil's got to knock on your mind
[34:51] and say can i come in your mind and
[34:53] build up a stronghold
[34:55] he knocks and said can i have a place in
[34:57] your mind can i
[34:58] take over your memories and give and
[35:01] remind you of your evil memories that
[35:03] you have
[35:03] and remind you what your dad did or not
[35:05] remind you what your mom did or remind
[35:08] you of what the preacher did or remind
[35:09] you
[35:10] see satan tries to he tries to get a
[35:12] place he tries to get a maybe it's an
[35:14] imagination he's constantly making you
[35:17] imagine
[35:17] wrong things right and he's trying to
[35:20] say can i have your imagination for a
[35:22] few minutes
[35:22] and if we're not careful church we'll
[35:24] give it over and he's a fast builder
[35:27] he's not slow like you and i when we try
[35:29] to build something right
[35:31] say it's really fast just give him a few
[35:33] minutes
[35:34] and he can build something so strong and
[35:37] if
[35:37] and if we're not careful then the
[35:39] scripture says if we're not careful
[35:42] that stronghold starts a war against the
[35:45] soul
[35:48] so go to first peter 2 11. i'll read it
[35:51] out of my uh
[35:53] off my computer here because i don't
[35:54] have it on the slide
[35:57] first peter 2 11. now this is the beauty
[36:00] of god's word
[36:01] if we don't keep satan out of our of our
[36:04] bodies
[36:05] uh and we do evil works and we let him
[36:08] in our mind
[36:09] if we're not careful if we let him in
[36:11] those two
[36:12] realms he will start a war against our
[36:15] soul against our nature
[36:18] that's what the bible says let's read it
[36:20] together so we got your bibles let's all
[36:21] read it out loud we don't do that very
[36:22] often let's do that
[36:23] first peter 2 11. one 2 3 dearly beloved
[36:27] i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[36:31] abstain from fleshly lusts which
[36:34] war against the soul
[36:37] now beseech means to desire to to pray
[36:40] to entreat to summon you
[36:43] to beg you paul's bet peter's begging
[36:46] you
[36:46] he said you're a pilgrim you're a
[36:48] stranger stay away from fleshly sins
[36:52] right like stealing and lying uh
[36:55] and lusting right and arguing and
[36:58] debating and fussing
[37:00] uh abstain from those
[37:04] because they actually start in the mind
[37:07] right the reason you want to argue is
[37:08] because you in your mind you got to
[37:09] thinking i'm smarter
[37:11] i'm greater than them i need to put them
[37:13] in their place pride
[37:15] see and so you speak out in your mind
[37:17] and you'll you'll say something wrong
[37:19] but paul but peter says he says when you
[37:22] do that when you let
[37:23] satan in and you do fleshly less he says
[37:26] you've already got a stronghold
[37:27] that's fighting against your soul
[37:31] so the brother of adam says if you're
[37:32] born again you've got a dove here
[37:34] yeah amen now i've seen a dove today at
[37:37] our house
[37:38] or a pigeon they're the same family is
[37:41] that just a great little great pigeon
[37:42] right two great patients at our house
[37:45] how many know they're not really loud
[37:46] how we know they're real quiet
[37:48] the didn't the bible say it's a still
[37:50] small voice
[37:52] every day that's still small voice we we
[37:55] see them on our daddy dates when i take
[37:56] the kids to the
[37:57] uh the pizza place and we can see the
[37:59] doves up there and they're cooing
[38:02] and you don't want to disturb them but i
[38:04] drove it i drove in my driveway today
[38:05] and those pigeons go running off and
[38:07] they go flying away
[38:08] just just real real small and a real
[38:11] timid right like
[38:11] that said the holy spirit is really
[38:13] timid
[38:15] and church if we're not careful if we
[38:17] don't think the right things
[38:19] we'll we'll hush that that dove we'll
[38:22] we'll eat we'll say be quiet get out
[38:25] stop stop talking to me
[38:27] and then it creates a war and then when
[38:29] we when we when we hush that holy thirst
[38:32] so much that
[38:33] that we start wondering oh my am i even
[38:35] saved
[38:36] am i born again see though i think with
[38:39] amen
[38:39] and sisterhood we'd all say we've had
[38:41] battles times we for sure knew we were
[38:43] born again and times we struggle with it
[38:45] right
[38:46] we've all well what's the difference the
[38:48] difference is when you're feeding that
[38:50] thirst
[38:51] you know you're born again praise god
[38:54] but there's times you don't
[38:55] there's times i don't there's times
[38:57] satan will make us tired or he'll
[38:59] interrupt our schedule right he'll
[39:01] interrupt our fellowship with god
[39:03] and he's allowed to do that because god
[39:04] knows we'll overcome praise god
[39:06] but see it creates a war and so satan is
[39:10] shooting off lies and
[39:12] and he's trying to get there but thank
[39:13] god if we're sealed by the holy ghost
[39:15] he's sealed out hallelujah amen god's
[39:19] spirit is sealed in
[39:21] right and he and satan sealed out
[39:24] but but it doesn't stop the fact that
[39:26] there can be battles there can be wars
[39:29] but thank god we have the shield of
[39:30] faith amen
[39:32] to quench every fiery dart of the devil
[39:35] praise god see church this is now this
[39:38] is bible teaching
[39:40] it starts a war against your soul when
[39:43] you give a place in your mind to the
[39:45] devil
[39:46] oh i'll never get the holy ghost you're
[39:47] going to start a big war right there
[39:50] especially with your soul right oh
[39:53] never i'll never amount to anything oh
[39:56] i'll never enjoy singing i'll never
[39:58] enjoy preaching i'll never enjoy
[39:59] church i'll never nobody loves me all
[40:02] these lives
[40:04] it's live jesus loves you praise god
[40:07] if anybody loves you christ does amen
[40:09] the people in this church do amen
[40:12] if anybody loves you it's the people
[40:13] here praise god
[40:15] that's right we see it creates a war if
[40:18] we
[40:18] if we believe it and start thinking
[40:20] about it especially if we say it right
[40:22] because then satan knows what we're
[40:24] what we're saying right then he knows
[40:25] what we're feeling
[40:27] the map says he won't know if you don't
[40:28] say it
[40:30] he can throw darts in there but he can't
[40:33] know what's in there so we got to be
[40:34] careful not to say the wrong thing
[40:37] see it creates a war when they give now
[40:40] this is for a believer
[40:42] now the worker of iniquity there's only
[40:44] a war at the beginning
[40:46] right they have that holy thirst for a
[40:49] lot a while like that man with the barns
[40:51] right
[40:52] you know he he let it go on for a while
[40:54] but then when he saw his retirement
[40:56] he just he totally had a war again he
[40:59] thought to be
[40:59] quiet and he he sent all of his bombs in
[41:02] there just destroyed it
[41:03] he said hush hush and jesus said you
[41:06] fool this night your soul will be
[41:08] required of you
[41:11] and he hushed that holy thirst see so in
[41:14] other words his soul
[41:15] lost the lord and
[41:18] the world and the and the comforts of
[41:20] this world
[41:21] the laodicean spirit won the war i don't
[41:24] want my testimony to be like that praise
[41:26] god
[41:26] i want to be an overcomer and laodicea
[41:28] praise god i don't want a testimony of a
[41:30] lukewarm
[41:31] you know some days i'm excited about god
[41:33] some days i'm not
[41:34] i want to be hot for jesus amen i want
[41:36] to stay in the word
[41:37] i want to stay singing songs amen i want
[41:40] to stay listening to the sermons i want
[41:42] to stay writing and meditating and
[41:44] thinking about the things of god
[41:45] i don't want a lukewarm testimony i want
[41:48] to be hot for jesus
[41:49] amen that word means fervent praise god
[41:52] that means boiling amen
[41:54] boiling all the time something bubbling
[41:56] up see so that's how you know you're
[41:58] boiling
[41:58] new thoughts are coming all the time new
[42:01] songs
[42:02] new reason to praise god new reasons to
[42:04] testify
[42:05] it's just it's coming up amen it's
[42:08] coming up all the time that's got to be
[42:09] our testimony church
[42:12] i know brother brahm says it church i
[42:14] know abraham says jesus didn't say
[42:16] one good thing to the laodicean church
[42:19] age
[42:19] now that's true for the most part but he
[42:22] did say there was going to be overcomers
[42:24] amen and if you look closely there is
[42:26] going to be the
[42:27] true believer that is zealous and
[42:29] repents
[42:31] and if they're zealous and repent then
[42:34] guess what then they're going to have
[42:35] hot works amen
[42:37] because jesus was talking about their
[42:38] works he said i know your works i'd
[42:40] rather you be cold with no christian
[42:42] works
[42:43] or hot with all christian works he said
[42:46] but the church
[42:46] overall is lukewarm but we're not the
[42:49] church we're the bride amen
[42:51] and we can have hot works we just gotta
[42:53] let the holy spirit
[42:55] constantly bubble up new thoughts and
[42:57] and listen to that holy thirst
[42:59] feed that holy thirst and let god's word
[43:02] move you let the love of god get and
[43:05] ignite your faith to work for god
[43:07] amen that's good to tie it all together
[43:10] thank the lord
[43:12] and let me share something with you
[43:13] sisterhood since your brother amen came
[43:15] up for prayer on sunday let me share
[43:16] some with you
[43:16] brother brandon said being white hot
[43:20] in the church age book he said white hot
[43:22] let me read it too so i feel like i'm
[43:24] gonna
[43:24] chop it up i read that on monday i
[43:27] thought instantly thought of amen and
[43:28] who
[43:29] when they came up for prayer so if i can
[43:31] help people i want to help people
[43:35] how can we be white hot jesus says uh
[43:38] you're either lukewarm cold
[43:40] or hot here's what bro here's what
[43:43] brother bear says
[43:47] brother man says this he says the false
[43:49] church you have the word you have more
[43:51] bibles than ever but you're not doing
[43:52] anything about the word except dividing
[43:55] and hacking it into pieces taking what
[43:57] you want and leaving out what you don't
[43:58] want so see we got to believe
[44:00] everything praise god
[44:03] he tells the false church you are not
[44:05] interested in living it
[44:07] but debating it
[44:10] i would sooner you were cold or hot if
[44:13] you were cold and rejected
[44:14] i could stand it now listen if you would
[44:16] get white hot
[44:19] to know it's the truth and live it i
[44:22] would praise you
[44:23] for that amen so see
[44:27] that's all white hot is that's the
[44:28] simplicity of being hot
[44:30] how do i know i'm hot for jesus how do i
[44:32] know i'm not lukewarm
[44:33] because the word that i've heard i live
[44:35] it amen
[44:36] praise god if i know in other words if i
[44:39] know i gotta repent i don't do it
[44:41] amen if i'm if i know somebody's sick
[44:44] i'll go pray for them bro if i know
[44:46] somebody needs a meal i'll go take them
[44:47] a meal
[44:48] see when you're white hot you know the
[44:50] word and you do the word
[44:51] amen that's that simple that beautiful
[44:55] it's so simple the simplicity of being
[44:57] hot
[44:58] because he's talking about your works
[45:00] right and your works
[45:01] uh come from faith which comes from love
[45:03] praise god
[45:05] so you have to have your first love you
[45:06] have to be on fire with love for jesus
[45:08] and that moves your faith to work for
[45:11] the kingdom of god
[45:13] and so see that's it i thought i heard i
[45:15] read that quote this week i instantly
[45:16] thought of you too
[45:18] so if you want to be white hot for god
[45:20] know the truth
[45:22] and live it oh that's glorious
[45:26] now back to this this is what jesus
[45:29] talked about in matthew
[45:31] 25 let's read it 25 i'm sorry 12 25 i'm
[45:34] sorry
[45:35] matthew 12 25 i said it wrong
[45:40] 12 25
[45:50] 12 25 25-30
[45:54] and jesus knew their thoughts and said
[45:56] unto them every kingdom divided against
[45:58] itself is brought to desolation
[46:00] and every city or house divided against
[46:02] itself shall not stand
[46:03] and if satan casts out satan he is
[46:05] divided against himself
[46:06] how shall then his kingdom stand if i by
[46:10] beelzebub cast out devils
[46:11] by whom do your children cast them out
[46:14] therefore
[46:15] they shall be your judges but if i cast
[46:18] out devils by the spirit of god
[46:20] then the kingdom of god is come unto you
[46:23] oh thank god
[46:25] or else how can one enter into a strong
[46:27] man's house now look up here that's the
[46:29] strong man's house
[46:31] right that's if he's if he's led of the
[46:34] devil right if he's
[46:35] i'll say this he can be saved both the
[46:36] holy ghost and have a complex
[46:38] right so let's let's make this
[46:40] applicable to us
[46:42] think about the last time you had a
[46:43] complex i was upset with that person or
[46:45] i was scared of that or i i always said
[46:47] that always did that whenever something
[46:48] came up
[46:49] that's a complex how else can one enter
[46:53] into a strong man's house
[46:55] and spoil his goods except he first bind
[46:58] the strong man
[47:00] and then he will spoil his house so if
[47:02] you've got a good house the only way
[47:04] satan can bind you
[47:06] is like you see on all the cartoons or
[47:07] tv shows they've got to come down they
[47:09] got to break down the door
[47:11] and they've got to come in and they've
[47:12] got to capture the warriors right
[47:14] they've got to bind up the fighters oh
[47:17] god god help us to always fight against
[47:19] the devil praise god
[47:21] help us not to lay down to the devil
[47:22] where the devil just comes in and
[47:24] and spoils all of our joy away takes all
[47:27] of our faith away
[47:28] takes all of our hope away oh god help
[47:30] us to find him with the word amen
[47:32] amen that's what jesus said he that is
[47:35] not with me is against me
[47:37] and he that gathereth not with me
[47:38] scattereth abroad
[47:42] oh my so see this is how satan gets into
[47:45] people's minds he first has to
[47:47] bind up their faith he has to bind up
[47:50] and somehow
[47:51] that's the word paralyzed and that's
[47:53] what i get to next in the next part
[47:55] paralyzing we know is fear fear
[47:57] paralyzes
[47:59] that's brother man said that's the
[48:00] biggest uh enemy for the church is fear
[48:03] remember he said that
[48:04] preached on that number of years ago but
[48:07] god's spirit does not give the spirit of
[48:09] fear it gives
[48:10] power love and a sound by amen
[48:13] so with god's spirit you know exactly
[48:15] where you stand
[48:16] praise god your mind is clear your mind
[48:19] mind
[48:20] is solid your mind is made up glory
[48:23] you've got a real strong castle praise
[48:25] god for build up for god amen
[48:28] that's the holy spirit praise god but
[48:31] see
[48:32] satan will come into our minds and he'll
[48:36] he'll come into our castle right uh uh
[48:38] our in other words our good habits
[48:41] and he'll he'll he'll take fear no
[48:43] paralyze our strength
[48:45] and then he'll take it over then he'll
[48:46] take all of our fighting ability away
[48:50] and then we'll just well whatever
[48:51] happens happens instead of knowing that
[48:53] jesus told us
[48:54] you cast out devils you heal the sick
[48:57] amen
[48:58] you lay your hands on the sick and they
[49:00] shall recover praise god
[49:02] you exercise your faith hallelujah
[49:04] praise god
[49:07] so see it's a great illustration the
[49:10] lord gives in matthew 25
[49:13] we don't want to be ruined by the devil
[49:15] we don't want our good habits stolen
[49:17] away
[49:18] we don't want to open the door to his
[49:20] lies
[49:21] we don't want to give heed to seducing
[49:23] spirits and doctrine of devils in other
[49:26] words
[49:26] don't allow yourself to think bad
[49:28] thoughts
[49:30] sing good thoughts because that's what
[49:33] he's trying to do as soon as you think
[49:34] bad thoughts
[49:35] he starts taking over the stronghold
[49:38] right or building his own new one we
[49:40] might even say it like that
[49:42] because that's the illustration that
[49:43] we're given remember that's what
[49:45] happened in numbers 14.
[49:47] all those spies came back in numbers 14
[49:50] they said we can't do it
[49:51] we're like little uh grasshoppers right
[49:55] and they're like giants well when did
[49:57] they forget that god was papa eagle way
[50:00] up there
[50:00] high above all the giants amen they
[50:03] might have been a grasshopper
[50:05] but papa eagle was watching over them
[50:07] amen
[50:08] he was higher than the giants i say like
[50:11] this there's one
[50:12] that's higher than i praise god there's
[50:14] one that's higher than you
[50:15] there's one watching all over you with
[50:17] eyes that can see everywhere
[50:19] it's almighty god papa eagle amen
[50:22] he's watching over us church yeah of
[50:25] course we're small
[50:26] we're always going to be small the the
[50:27] victory's not mine
[50:29] the victory is the lord's amen he's the
[50:32] one that's
[50:32] if he doesn't fight we don't win but if
[50:35] he fights we win praise god
[50:37] but we gotta let him praise god we gotta
[50:40] let him fight amen
[50:43] and see what fear did they said oh we
[50:45] can't do it we're just little
[50:47] grasshoppers
[50:48] and it spread like wildfire see we need
[50:50] the opposite we need faith to spread
[50:52] like fire
[50:55] that's what we need and that's what
[50:56] happens when people get one accord
[50:58] praise god
[50:59] that's what happened when brother cam
[51:00] and brother first were here right it
[51:02] just looked like fire
[51:03] everybody was on fire praise god it just
[51:05] spread like fire the same thing could
[51:07] happen in any service praise god
[51:09] we just got to get in one authority amen
[51:11] and cast out all
[51:12] unbelief praise god see it'll spread
[51:16] the holy spirit fire spreads as well
[51:18] amen
[51:20] now you know the illustration satan is
[51:23] like
[51:24] he's like bringing about a poisonous box
[51:25] of snakes right
[51:27] well just like today i got numerous uh
[51:31] boxes today from amazon prime i didn't
[51:33] have to go out and get them it was my
[51:34] choice i could have left them there all
[51:35] night
[51:36] but i wanted them so i brought them in
[51:39] right and
[51:39] satan brings us a lie we've got a right
[51:43] just leave it out there
[51:45] and then when you get real vote you go
[51:46] have a prayer meeting you get readable
[51:48] what you do is you'll either send it
[51:49] back
[51:50] or you'll go put in the trash can or
[51:51] you'll go burn it in the burn pile
[51:54] either one either one will work
[51:58] you can give it to the guy the next day
[52:00] and say take back your poison box amen
[52:02] you can go burn it i don't know but one
[52:04] thing i know it's our god
[52:06] it's a consuming fire i know snakes
[52:09] don't like fire amen neither does
[52:11] anybody
[52:11] you does any animal praise god so see
[52:14] it's that it's the same idea
[52:16] satan's bringing a package or satan's
[52:18] trying to ransack
[52:20] satan's trying to steal what god has
[52:22] built up in our lives but we've got to
[52:24] be
[52:24] we can be stronger amen it's our choice
[52:27] because god has given us the weapons of
[52:28] warfare amen
[52:30] but this is how workers of iniquity
[52:32] start they start with one evil thought
[52:37] they get they get their guards right
[52:38] they open the door they open the
[52:40] drawbridge can i say like castle
[52:42] language they open the drawbridge and
[52:44] they let this the devil come in
[52:46] and the guards lay down their weapons
[52:49] yet they've got all these guards they've
[52:50] got all this power
[52:51] they've got all this food and ammunition
[52:53] and water stored up
[52:54] like oh come on in devil come on in yeah
[52:57] i want to be mad at my dad
[52:58] or i want to be mad at my mom oh no i i
[53:01] want to go
[53:01] and look at those evil websites and they
[53:04] just give up
[53:05] and they and and pretty soon it becomes
[53:08] a bad habit right pretty soon satan
[53:10] takes over the whole thing
[53:11] and now they're fighting wars against
[53:13] the soul of that person trying to tell
[53:15] them you're not saved
[53:16] you'll never be saved you'll never be a
[53:18] conqueror but thank god jesus says we're
[53:20] more than conquerors
[53:22] in christ jesus amen when we put on
[53:25] the full armor of god amen amen but we
[53:28] got to be willing to fight praise god
[53:30] with his weapons of his warfare praise
[53:33] god
[53:35] you got it right church i've got every
[53:38] right to leave that amazon package out
[53:40] there
[53:42] don't have to take it in i'll let
[53:44] somebody wants to come steal it they can
[53:45] steal it especially if it's a box of
[53:47] rattlesnakes
[53:48] go ahead and take it you can have it if
[53:50] you want
[53:51] because i know who delivered it i
[53:52] watched it was satan's delivery service
[53:54] praise god
[53:56] so we don't want that see we got to keep
[53:58] our minds free from corruption
[54:01] remember the bible said in 2 corinthians
[54:03] 11 3 that satan beguiled
[54:05] eve and corrupted her mind her body was
[54:09] pure
[54:10] she was virgin to the word right virgin
[54:11] physically spiritually but satan
[54:13] corrupted her mind
[54:15] and then he corrupted her body but thank
[54:17] god for the blood
[54:18] jesus cleansed her soul amen because god
[54:21] said i'm i'm gonna come down and make a
[54:23] sacrifice
[54:24] i'm going to forgive her soul thank god
[54:26] for that amen
[54:27] amen hallelujah it's god's grace so we
[54:30] must
[54:31] renew our minds and remember brother
[54:33] baby said perfect faith
[54:35] is the master of every circumstance
[54:38] and all that means church is in any
[54:40] circumstance
[54:41] you wait for god to give you the words
[54:43] to say and then when you got
[54:45] when you got the revelation you speak
[54:47] the word and you're not worried about
[54:49] the circumstances
[54:50] because you know the word is in control
[54:52] of every circumstance praise god
[54:55] that's all that is in every temptation
[54:57] and every
[54:58] and every it's not something mysterious
[55:00] a lot of preachers like to make that oh
[55:01] perfect paper
[55:02] it's just god's word revealed to you
[55:05] when you need it praise god
[55:06] that's all it is it could be your daily
[55:08] life it can be on the job it can be at
[55:10] lunch it can be in night time in the
[55:12] morning in the evening
[55:13] it can be when someone's sick but when
[55:14] god's word is revealed to you
[55:16] and you receive it you're no longer
[55:18] worried about circumstances
[55:20] because faith masters every circumstance
[55:24] like the bible says it brings every
[55:26] thought into captivity to christ
[55:29] amen oh my thank god
[55:32] see you get you have god-given control
[55:36] when god's thoughts god's word comes
[55:38] into your mind and you let it fill your
[55:40] mind and you speak god's word
[55:42] now you have god-given control praise
[55:46] god
[55:50] see that's how many believe that by
[55:51] god's grace amen we all see we overcome
[55:54] by two things the blood of jesus now the
[55:57] blood of jesus
[55:57] gives us full redemption right
[56:01] and total forgiveness amen i'm fully
[56:04] redeemed
[56:05] i'm fully brought back to what i was at
[56:07] the beginning in his mind
[56:10] i am redeemed i am brought back to my
[56:13] rightful position
[56:14] and so when you say god forgive me and
[56:16] you mean it and you're not going to do
[56:18] it again
[56:18] you're redeemed right back to where you
[56:20] were praise god amen
[56:22] right back because it's redemption it's
[56:23] brought back all the way
[56:25] and it's not partial forgiveness it's
[56:27] total forgiveness amen
[56:30] thank you when we really went out that's
[56:32] when we like
[56:33] calls it when we thoroughly repent not
[56:36] like i'm sorry i'll do it tomorrow night
[56:37] too
[56:38] or i'm sorry i'm going to smoke that
[56:40] tomorrow too no that's not
[56:42] full repentance praise god and that's
[56:44] where they become slaves right they hush
[56:46] that holy thirst
[56:47] that's what we said worldly sorrow on
[56:48] sunday i'm sorry god but i'm gonna go
[56:51] smoke that cigar tomorrow you know where
[56:54] whatever
[56:55] you know you know what i'm talking about
[56:56] any addiction to sin
[56:59] now church there are i wrote here
[57:01] stockpiles of scripture
[57:03] that say the evil ones the workers of
[57:05] iniquity are
[57:07] full of darkness the bible says
[57:10] peter says they have eyes full of
[57:13] adultery
[57:15] right they cannot cease from sin
[57:20] they have a heart exercise with covetous
[57:22] practices
[57:23] curse children praise god
[57:27] so see church their eyes only see
[57:30] adultery
[57:30] they only see idolatry they only see the
[57:33] lust of the
[57:34] that's all they see they can't stop
[57:36] seeing it oh but thank god amen
[57:39] that our eyes don't think on those
[57:41] things our eyes are filled with holiness
[57:43] and godliness and and the good things
[57:46] holy things but see workers are manipu
[57:48] that's all they see
[57:51] that's all they want to see and that's
[57:53] all they do
[57:55] because they're full they have totally
[57:57] given over their minds
[57:59] to the wrong thoughts so they have no
[58:01] victory
[58:02] they can't get the victory because their
[58:05] whole
[58:05] their whole fortress is taken over all
[58:08] their thoughts go to evil that's why god
[58:10] destroyed him in the days of noah that's
[58:11] why god said these are like the days of
[58:13] noah
[58:15] right these like the days of lot the
[58:17] days of noah all combined it's all
[58:19] combined
[58:19] evil spirits are all gathering up into
[58:21] this final age
[58:23] that's right they fill their minds with
[58:26] debauchery
[58:27] and their habitually sinning which means
[58:30] they have habits of sin
[58:32] now let's see what jesus said in matthew
[58:34] 6 23 and 24
[58:36] i'll read that here jesus said if thine
[58:40] i be
[58:40] evil thy whole body shall be full of
[58:43] darkness says he whatever you put in
[58:44] your eyes
[58:46] see if your intentions or your eyes what
[58:49] you're looking at what you're trying to
[58:50] see
[58:51] if it be evil your whole body will be
[58:54] filled with darkness so if you let evil
[58:56] in here the whole
[58:58] outer court right it's gonna work its
[59:00] way out right you put evil in you're
[59:02] gonna get evil out
[59:04] jesus said if your eye be evil your
[59:06] whole body be full of darkness
[59:08] if therefore the light that is in thee
[59:10] be darkness how great
[59:12] is that darkness so you see he's he's
[59:14] making it like eve
[59:16] eve thought she was receiving light oh
[59:18] new knowledge from the serpent
[59:19] lie lie lie she thought it was new
[59:21] revelation but it wasn't
[59:23] god said it was darkness and jesus says
[59:25] the same thing
[59:26] when we think lies the light that's
[59:29] actually
[59:30] in our minds is darkness he said how
[59:33] great is that darkness
[59:36] church you know it almost every i'm sure
[59:38] naomi knows it i was raised in pentecost
[59:40] to church i was raised in medical
[59:41] centers
[59:42] they think they're full of light when
[59:44] they they'll just
[59:45] like when we were praying for my uncle
[59:46] my mom just started speaking in tongues
[59:48] and i could tell it doesn't seem like a
[59:49] real tongue
[59:50] it just seemed like one of those tongues
[59:51] you know she's making up as she goes
[59:53] along well
[59:53] bless her heart you know but that's
[59:55] wrong they have
[59:56] they think it's light well i can just i
[59:59] can speak in tongues whenever i want
[1:00:01] that's a false light
[1:00:04] but if they if that if they if they take
[1:00:06] that into they take it into their eyes
[1:00:08] the preachers and they believe
[1:00:10] them and they they believe the lies but
[1:00:12] if that light in thee be darkness
[1:00:14] how great is the darkness no man can
[1:00:18] serve two masters so it comes out of two
[1:00:20] things
[1:00:20] we're either looking and being our eyes
[1:00:22] are filled with good things
[1:00:24] or our eyes are being filled with
[1:00:25] lustful things or simple things
[1:00:28] right jesus says our eyes our eyes
[1:00:32] serve one or the other oh thank god for
[1:00:34] god's grace amen
[1:00:36] thank god for god's grace
[1:00:40] you know church most of the people on
[1:00:41] this world can't preach it remember we
[1:00:42] put the cell phone up here
[1:00:45] wasn't that awesome when he preached
[1:00:47] that's like everybody right
[1:00:49] yeah and you know we all got to have it
[1:00:50] i got to have it for work and school and
[1:00:52] texting people and emailing people
[1:00:54] helping people
[1:00:56] but see it's either filled with good
[1:00:58] things or bad things
[1:01:01] i'm thankful that my phone's filled with
[1:01:02] all these good keynotes about
[1:01:04] and powerpoints about god i'm glad you
[1:01:06] won't find an evil one on there praise
[1:01:08] god
[1:01:09] because my eye is filled with real light
[1:01:12] praise god
[1:01:12] now like this how great is this light
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:16] i don't know it's a great light it's the
[1:01:18] light of the hour amen
[1:01:19] amen it's the light of this church age
[1:01:22] hallelujah
[1:01:24] so you see it goes back to who you serve
[1:01:25] your eyes are going to serve one or the
[1:01:27] other
[1:01:28] for either he'll hate one and love the
[1:01:30] other or else he'll hold to the one and
[1:01:32] despise the other
[1:01:33] you cannot serve god and mammon which is
[1:01:35] riches
[1:01:36] so demons demons hide behind love of
[1:01:39] riches right there's nothing wrong with
[1:01:40] being rich
[1:01:41] it's the demon power and lust behind
[1:01:43] that for riches right
[1:01:46] so there's another there's a great
[1:01:47] scripture see how they're full see how
[1:01:48] the bible says
[1:01:50] brother brahma says brother man says
[1:01:51] this i know the quote but brother says
[1:01:53] you're either going to leave here
[1:01:54] full of something either god
[1:01:57] or the world let's leave here full of
[1:01:59] the holy spirit praise god
[1:02:01] where everything i want to see
[1:02:02] everything i want to do everything i
[1:02:04] want to talk about
[1:02:05] is all god god god god jesus jesus jesus
[1:02:08] word word word
[1:02:09] holy spirit signs miracles wonders
[1:02:11] teaching truth god's word
[1:02:13] help all the gifts of god let that fill
[1:02:15] our hearts and minds amen
[1:02:18] you're going to be full with something
[1:02:19] when we leave here praise god
[1:02:22] let's be full of faith praise god amen
[1:02:25] because remember you is either one of
[1:02:26] the other you're the servant your eyes
[1:02:27] are serving one or the other
[1:02:30] that's why i told the children when they
[1:02:31] get the holy ghost their eyes are gonna
[1:02:33] be on the word
[1:02:35] when i got the holy ghost my eyes was on
[1:02:38] the bible and the church age book
[1:02:40] and the seal book that's all i want my
[1:02:43] eyes on i know not everybody's a
[1:02:44] preacher i know that too
[1:02:46] but if you're not a preacher then your
[1:02:47] eyes will be on music or something you
[1:02:49] know it'll be
[1:02:49] maybe on something you'll be on good
[1:02:52] things because if
[1:02:53] your eyes uh serve one or the other
[1:02:57] what you let in your eyes
[1:03:00] now you know romans 1 paul describes
[1:03:03] homosexuals
[1:03:04] saying their minds knew god's word but
[1:03:07] refused to
[1:03:09] retain it so god gave them over to a
[1:03:12] rejected reprobate mind
[1:03:14] being filled with all unrighteousness
[1:03:18] now let's read it um go to let's go to
[1:03:20] romans 1 here
[1:03:25] i believe let me see it's verse
[1:03:30] let's look at 38 here a little bit
[1:03:34] 20 let's go to uh now speaks of
[1:03:37] homosexuality in verses 26 to 28 let's
[1:03:39] go to verse 29 because you know that
[1:03:42] and so see church god gives over
[1:03:44] homosexuals many of them go beyond
[1:03:46] salvation many of them can't be saved
[1:03:48] thank god some do
[1:03:51] uh there's a ministry called ray
[1:03:52] conference ministry called living waters
[1:03:54] they have a conference every year where
[1:03:55] the the people who came out of
[1:03:57] homosexuality they
[1:03:58] they gather there to encourage one
[1:03:59] another that god can bring you out but
[1:04:01] it's a very small group
[1:04:03] verse 29 look what does the bible say
[1:04:05] they're being what
[1:04:06] filled with all unrighteousness
[1:04:09] he's speaking of homosexuals here
[1:04:12] fornication wickedness covetousness
[1:04:14] maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[1:04:17] deceit malignant whispers did you see
[1:04:19] this week ellen degeneres everybody's
[1:04:20] coming against her do you see that this
[1:04:21] week
[1:04:22] she's homosexual she's had the number
[1:04:24] one morning show for how many years
[1:04:26] and now everybody's coming out saying
[1:04:27] it's a toxic work environment
[1:04:29] well that's i could have told you that
[1:04:30] the bible says i could have told you
[1:04:31] that a long time ago
[1:04:33] now i could i didn't predict it but i
[1:04:34] could have told you that
[1:04:36] the bible says homosexuals are for
[1:04:38] fornication wickedness covetous
[1:04:40] they said she's like a stone behind the
[1:04:42] camera she's
[1:04:43] hateful towards everybody well that's
[1:04:45] exactly what the bible says
[1:04:47] look at verse 30 backbiters haters
[1:04:50] of god despiteful proud
[1:04:54] boasters inventors of evil things
[1:04:56] disobedient to parents
[1:04:58] without understanding
[1:05:01] covenant breakers without natural
[1:05:03] affection see that even a woman doesn't
[1:05:05] love a man anymore
[1:05:06] they love woman and woman they don't
[1:05:07] even love babies right they want babies
[1:05:09] to be aborted
[1:05:11] implacable unmerciful what's implacable
[1:05:13] mean let me check real quick here
[1:05:16] uh okay they refrain
[1:05:20] i'm so yeah they cannot enter into
[1:05:22] covenants covenants okay so that deals
[1:05:23] with marriage probably
[1:05:25] or even uh god's covenant who now listen
[1:05:28] look at verse 32 who knowing the
[1:05:30] judgment of god that they which commit
[1:05:32] such things
[1:05:33] are worthy of death that's god's word
[1:05:36] god's word said if they do not retain
[1:05:39] god's knowledge
[1:05:40] they're worthy of death see if they
[1:05:42] don't put god's word in here
[1:05:44] in order to meet that holy thirst god
[1:05:46] says you're worthy to die
[1:05:48] because i gave you a holy thirst i gave
[1:05:50] you desire to know it
[1:05:52] but you purposely quiet it down and you
[1:05:54] build up an evil empire in your mind
[1:05:57] the empire of darkness and so that makes
[1:06:00] someone worthy of hell
[1:06:02] worthy of judgment when he had a holy
[1:06:05] thirst but they allow satan's powers
[1:06:07] they know better but they allow satan's
[1:06:09] powers
[1:06:09] to hush and silence the holiness that
[1:06:12] was already inside them
[1:06:16] that makes them worthy of death and not
[1:06:19] only do the same but have pleasure
[1:06:21] in them that do them so at first they
[1:06:24] don't have pleasure in sinning
[1:06:25] but once they reject god's word and let
[1:06:27] satan overtake their thoughts and all
[1:06:30] they do is think evil all the time
[1:06:31] now they have pleasure now it's just
[1:06:33] unbelief here they silence the holiness
[1:06:35] now it's all in belief and now they just
[1:06:37] they don't have like brother man said
[1:06:39] uh they've got as much conviction as a
[1:06:41] snake's got legs
[1:06:43] right or snake's got arms or i'm sorry
[1:06:46] he said a snake has hips
[1:06:47] sorry he said they've got as much
[1:06:49] conviction as a snake has hips
[1:06:51] in other words they don't have any
[1:06:53] because they've already passed the line
[1:06:55] between mercy and judgment but thank god
[1:06:57] if we feel bad about our sins oh god god
[1:07:00] help us to feel the conviction of the
[1:07:01] holy spirit and be filled with
[1:07:03] righteousness amen
[1:07:05] and not unrighteousness because this
[1:07:08] this is where it happens this is where
[1:07:09] they become this is where they cross the
[1:07:12] line of mercy and judgment they give and
[1:07:14] they build up strongholds and a fortress
[1:07:17] a city for satan
[1:07:18] and all they do is think about evil
[1:07:20] thoughts in their minds
[1:07:22] let's go to hosea real quick let's go to
[1:07:24] hosea uh
[1:07:31] four verse six hosea four verse six
[1:07:33] thank you for your patience
[1:07:34] and give me uh 15 minutes here let me
[1:07:35] finish up i didn't even set a timer so i
[1:07:37] don't even know how long i've been
[1:07:38] preaching
[1:07:39] it feels like 10 minutes so
[1:07:42] if i go to 8 15 i think you can you'll
[1:07:44] bear with me i appreciate that
[1:07:46] i'm sure you will you're such a great
[1:07:48] wonderful loving people here
[1:07:53] let's see church
[1:07:56] people misinterpret this scripture all
[1:07:58] the time because they only read to the
[1:07:59] first semicolon
[1:08:01] my people are destroyed for lack of
[1:08:03] knowledge and they say see
[1:08:04] people go to hell because they didn't
[1:08:06] hear that's not true
[1:08:09] that's not true the bible says that in
[1:08:12] romans 1
[1:08:13] that the homosexuals had the knowledge
[1:08:15] of god in fact
[1:08:16] romans 1 is where it says it was they
[1:08:17] saw in creation and it was
[1:08:19] in them so they have a two witnesses
[1:08:21] against them
[1:08:24] and they didn't retain they didn't keep
[1:08:26] god's knowledge so then satan filled
[1:08:28] their reprobate mind gave them a
[1:08:29] reprobate mind and they're lost
[1:08:32] we say oh well people didn't hear the
[1:08:34] message they could never go to heaven
[1:08:36] nonsense keep reading
[1:08:37] my people are destroyed for lack of
[1:08:38] knowledge because thou hast
[1:08:40] rejected knowledge see the reason they
[1:08:44] lack it
[1:08:44] because they kicked it out of their
[1:08:45] house amen the reason they lack
[1:08:48] strength is because they let the devil
[1:08:50] steal their strength
[1:08:52] amen they had it but they lost it amen
[1:08:55] that's why that's what that's the real
[1:08:57] meaning of the scripture
[1:08:58] the reason they lack knowledge is
[1:09:00] because they rejected they didn't want
[1:09:02] it anymore
[1:09:04] it's not because they never knew they
[1:09:05] knew the bible said it's written on
[1:09:07] their conscience in romans 2.
[1:09:10] because the house rejected knowledge i
[1:09:12] will also reject thee so there's
[1:09:14] there's god's standard i put holiness in
[1:09:16] you i put a holy thirst in you
[1:09:18] i put my law in your conscience so the
[1:09:20] law is in your mind right
[1:09:22] and you have a thirst in your mind for
[1:09:23] the law of god you have a holy
[1:09:25] thirst in your soul for god's spirit but
[1:09:28] to reject that god said i'll reject you
[1:09:32] that thou shalt be no priest to me
[1:09:35] speaking of israel here
[1:09:36] seeing thou has forgotten the law of thy
[1:09:39] god i will also forget
[1:09:41] thy children oh lord help us
[1:09:47] help us not to forget the commands of
[1:09:48] god amen that's why church
[1:09:50] i always enjoy coming to church you know
[1:09:53] sometimes i'm a little embarrassed
[1:09:55] because i forget some things i preached
[1:09:57] a few years ago
[1:09:58] like oh man i couldn't really use that
[1:10:01] that's true
[1:10:02] i thought my i'll hear a preacher
[1:10:04] preaching i'm like i already used that
[1:10:05] quote about 10 years ago why did i
[1:10:07] forget that
[1:10:09] but see that's why i need to keep
[1:10:10] listening to the word of god
[1:10:12] hallelujah that's why you and i need to
[1:10:14] keep listening and quoting the word and
[1:10:16] keep memorizing the word
[1:10:18] and keep uh pointing at reading and
[1:10:20] knowing the word
[1:10:21] because we forget and we must not forget
[1:10:24] we must remember praise god jesus said
[1:10:26] the holy ghost will bring all things to
[1:10:27] our remembrance
[1:10:29] but we got to feed it too he said he
[1:10:32] said don't neglect that gift that's in
[1:10:34] thee
[1:10:34] he said give yourself the reading and
[1:10:36] the exhortation i remember that
[1:10:38] that's a preacher but church you too
[1:10:40] you're supposed to read your bible
[1:10:41] program says you got two things to get
[1:10:43] closer to god read your bible and pray
[1:10:46] and that's how simple it is and then
[1:10:48] like we said if you want to be white hot
[1:10:50] then act on what you heard
[1:10:52] amen live it act upon it he said you'll
[1:10:55] be white hot for the lord
[1:10:58] oh amen you love the lord praise god
[1:11:02] let us not forget the law of god
[1:11:06] now i'm just going to start the next
[1:11:08] section lord willing i'll finish it on
[1:11:10] sunday
[1:11:12] you know i got a a email from a brother
[1:11:14] in mexico saying or
[1:11:16] sorry el salvador saying he's really
[1:11:17] enjoying this series on iniquity i say
[1:11:19] well praise the lord
[1:11:20] and uh my niece emma is reading this
[1:11:23] chapter so i print out the chapter i
[1:11:24] sent cam all the chapters it was like
[1:11:25] seventy dollars to print all the
[1:11:26] chapters
[1:11:27] on paper and it was like fifteen dollars
[1:11:29] i made it over there and i told cam pass
[1:11:31] it around your church and read it
[1:11:33] and emma my niece she's 16. she's
[1:11:35] reading this chapter saying i learned so
[1:11:36] much about the serpent seed
[1:11:38] now see church that's what we need to do
[1:11:39] we need to strengthen people
[1:11:41] amen i may not say many people with this
[1:11:43] little book
[1:11:44] well it's going to be big book or
[1:11:45] willing actually i may not say many
[1:11:48] people but if i
[1:11:49] strengthen people sister beatrice i'll
[1:11:51] rejoice amen
[1:11:52] because that's what the word edification
[1:11:54] means strengthen what you already got
[1:11:56] amen so it's already strengthening
[1:12:00] young believers thank god
[1:12:03] hallelujah and we're preaching it here
[1:12:05] and strengthening people
[1:12:06] in south america by god's grace or
[1:12:08] central america sorry
[1:12:10] central america
[1:12:14] we know fewer fewer people be saved
[1:12:15] fewer fewer people filled with the holy
[1:12:16] ghost but let's strengthen those that we
[1:12:18] got left
[1:12:20] that's what god told martin luther he he
[1:12:22] said strengthen that which remains amen
[1:12:24] whatever you've got left strengthen that
[1:12:26] praise god make sure you're strong in
[1:12:28] the lord
[1:12:30] hallelujah so let me just start this
[1:12:33] next section here
[1:12:35] we're going to specifically look at the
[1:12:37] iniquity filled
[1:12:38] scribes pharisees and sadducees
[1:12:43] so lucifer and cain were religious but
[1:12:46] eventually all their acts were
[1:12:47] meaningless
[1:12:49] they hid behind religion so religion was
[1:12:51] their veil to hide behind right
[1:12:53] it was their sheep's clothing for the
[1:12:55] wolf behind them right
[1:12:57] i'll sacrifice my fruits i'll pay my
[1:13:01] tithes on mit and cumin and i'll
[1:13:03] i'll pay you every little thing i gotta
[1:13:04] pay the pharisee but as a wolf in
[1:13:06] sheep's clothing
[1:13:10] and so look now satan the same devil
[1:13:12] that was in cain
[1:13:13] fast forward now that same devil is in
[1:13:15] the pharisees sadducees and scribes
[1:13:20] in church these two portions of
[1:13:22] scripture
[1:13:24] show the depths of iniquity of these
[1:13:27] groups
[1:13:28] it is the sermon on the mount
[1:13:32] and matthew 23
[1:13:35] jesus gives eight woes against the
[1:13:38] pharisees in matthew 23.
[1:13:40] now brother man says the greatest most
[1:13:43] bitter denunciation
[1:13:45] is the message to the laodicean church
[1:13:46] age but from my reading too
[1:13:49] i agree with that but my reading too
[1:13:51] jesus's most bitter rebukes
[1:13:53] are on the sermon on the mount and in
[1:13:55] matthew 23.
[1:13:57] he he completely he just tears them up i
[1:14:01] don't know any other way to say it
[1:14:03] he tears up their uh their
[1:14:06] sheep's clothing and he pulls away the
[1:14:09] curtain he pulls away the veil of
[1:14:11] sheep's clothing and they're exposed
[1:14:13] for ravening wolves is what they're
[1:14:15] exposed for
[1:14:18] in church matthew chapters five six and
[1:14:21] seven that's what i was
[1:14:22] trying to tell by the stephen i said
[1:14:23] your memory verse was exactly what i was
[1:14:25] trying to get on sunday morning but i
[1:14:26] didn't get there
[1:14:28] chapters five six and seven give the
[1:14:30] most details on the sermon of the
[1:14:33] amount uh part of this was taught
[1:14:35] privately to disciples but also to a
[1:14:37] great audience
[1:14:39] in chapter five jesus beatitudes
[1:14:43] emphasize blessings upon spiritual
[1:14:45] purity
[1:14:48] his disciples were to keep and teach his
[1:14:50] commands
[1:14:51] and sincerity and listen their
[1:14:53] righteousness
[1:14:54] was to exceed that of the pharisees
[1:14:58] and let me say this our righteousness
[1:15:00] ought to exceed
[1:15:01] the pentecostals today how many could
[1:15:03] say amen to that
[1:15:05] if ever there was a time that our
[1:15:07] righteousness
[1:15:08] should exceed the catholic church it
[1:15:10] should be right now
[1:15:12] praise god amen
[1:15:16] if ever there was a time why because
[1:15:18] this is the time of restoration
[1:15:20] this is the heart the time of hearts
[1:15:22] turning back to the fathers amen
[1:15:25] see their hearts are turning back to the
[1:15:27] mother harlot right
[1:15:28] uh wrong but our hearts are turning back
[1:15:31] to the paul
[1:15:32] and peter and john and all the original
[1:15:35] apostles
[1:15:35] our hearts are turning back to the real
[1:15:37] faith amen
[1:15:46] jesus rebukes their legalism
[1:15:50] and there are popular religious parties
[1:15:52] of their day
[1:15:53] he magnifies moses law so he takes the
[1:15:56] magnifying glass of god's word
[1:15:58] and he magnifies it and moses law
[1:16:00] becomes so much greater and clearer
[1:16:04] remember magnifying means now you can
[1:16:06] see something you couldn't see before
[1:16:09] right oh and i can see oh look at all
[1:16:12] these living things i didn't know they
[1:16:13] were there
[1:16:14] that's the same thing jesus did they say
[1:16:16] thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:16:18] jesus magnified that and said see if
[1:16:20] you've got that demon in your mind
[1:16:21] you've already committed the same thing
[1:16:23] see you didn't see it but i saw it
[1:16:26] you you only saw it when you got caught
[1:16:28] with a prostitute or got caught in
[1:16:29] adultery he said well i
[1:16:31] see that i see it in your human spirit i
[1:16:33] see your
[1:16:34] your complex buildup of adultery in your
[1:16:37] heart and you must repent or you're
[1:16:38] guilty of doing the same thing
[1:16:42] he magnified the law
[1:16:46] in matthew 5 6 and 7.
[1:16:49] on anger mental lust adultery swearing
[1:16:53] resisting not evil giving and loving
[1:16:56] enemies
[1:17:01] mercy
[1:17:04] so i love this the pharisees are sitting
[1:17:06] right there and jesus said blessed
[1:17:08] are the pure in heart for they shall see
[1:17:11] god and jesus knew they were
[1:17:13] impure jesus knew they were full of dead
[1:17:16] men's bones and yet he let him sit there
[1:17:22] i love chapter six chapter six in
[1:17:25] matthew 6
[1:17:27] gives jesus's three attacks on religious
[1:17:29] hypocrites
[1:17:31] that lived in the jewish synagogues
[1:17:35] and include the pharisees jesus
[1:17:38] says all of their following three things
[1:17:42] were all in vain
[1:17:43] all of their alms all their praying
[1:17:47] and all their fasting were all done
[1:17:50] hypocritically the church can you
[1:17:53] imagine anything more sad than that
[1:17:59] do you ever understand that devils will
[1:18:02] fast
[1:18:04] devils will move people too fast because
[1:18:06] they're fastened for the wrong reasons
[1:18:09] they're fasting to be seen of men
[1:18:12] this is this is powerful jesus condemns
[1:18:15] their fasting
[1:18:16] you say well you know well i fasted that
[1:18:19] proved i was sincere not all
[1:18:21] not every time not every time
[1:18:25] now with most of us we're going to be
[1:18:26] sincere about it right but with
[1:18:28] religious and workers of iniquity with
[1:18:30] religious
[1:18:30] impostors wolves in sheep clothing jesus
[1:18:34] condemns even their fasting
[1:18:37] in church even their prayers
[1:18:42] that's not the group i want to be in i
[1:18:44] don't want to be in the group that
[1:18:45] i fast for the wrong reasons i pray for
[1:18:48] the wrong reasons
[1:18:49] and i give for the wrong reasons but
[1:18:54] that's what christ did in matthew
[1:18:55] chapter 6.
[1:18:57] so see when you see workers of iniquity
[1:19:00] that spirit gets so
[1:19:01] strong that it says oh fast
[1:19:04] so you can look tired and people will
[1:19:06] ask you and then you can brag to people
[1:19:08] when you're fasting
[1:19:09] that's a demon right or
[1:19:13] announce on your your church facebook
[1:19:15] page that you're giving out food to the
[1:19:17] poor
[1:19:18] so everybody knows how holy you are
[1:19:28] or tell people how much or call call for
[1:19:31] prayer and call your friends to pray and
[1:19:32] then you don't even pray
[1:19:34] god help us right
[1:19:37] this is what they did and jesus calls
[1:19:39] out all their works
[1:19:41] and proves they're the workers of
[1:19:43] iniquity
[1:19:45] their giving was iniquity their praying
[1:19:47] was iniquity
[1:19:48] they're fasting was iniquity
[1:19:52] can you think of any more of a better
[1:19:53] rebuke than that or harsher rebuke than
[1:19:55] that
[1:19:57] they're ver the most personal religious
[1:20:00] works
[1:20:00] they could possibly do jesus said it's
[1:20:02] in vain
[1:20:06] how many want to be true worshipers amen
[1:20:10] the holy spirit is looking for true
[1:20:11] worshipers who worship in spirit
[1:20:14] and in truth
[1:20:17] we need to fast so we can we so we want
[1:20:20] to see god move
[1:20:21] not so we get recognition right we want
[1:20:24] to give
[1:20:25] to genuinely help people even though
[1:20:27] we'll be we'll be
[1:20:28] short maybe a little bit that month on
[1:20:30] certain maybe won't be able to pay off
[1:20:32] as much as we want
[1:20:32] we want to give because we want to help
[1:20:34] people
[1:20:36] and we know we want to make their lives
[1:20:37] a little bit easier on this side
[1:20:40] not so that somebody says oh my jesse
[1:20:43] sent me 300
[1:20:44] look what a great man is and put it on
[1:20:45] facebook or put it on instagram
[1:20:47] that's not why we want to do it
[1:20:52] or like he says public prayer well i
[1:20:54] hope brother jesse calls me up to pray
[1:20:55] now i hardly do that at all so
[1:20:57] probably doesn't affect anybody here but
[1:21:00] see that's this
[1:21:01] is this this is the uh rebuking of
[1:21:04] workers of iniquity they let this build
[1:21:05] up so long
[1:21:07] that satan sends them tells their body
[1:21:09] to fast satan tells them to give
[1:21:10] satan tells them to pray but it's all
[1:21:13] for the wrong reason
[1:21:16] let me close with this here that was
[1:21:17] chapter six
[1:21:21] chapter seven jesus's hypocritical
[1:21:23] charges on those who judge others
[1:21:25] despite being guilty of the same sins
[1:21:29] yet he promises to hear our prayers and
[1:21:31] proclaims the golden rule
[1:21:34] fulfills the law and the prophets
[1:21:40] hallelujah
[1:21:42] jesus ends chapter seven with this
[1:21:45] compare and contrast between
[1:21:46] true and false religion i'm closing with
[1:21:48] this
[1:21:50] jesus says there are two gates
[1:21:53] he said enter into the straight gate
[1:21:58] jesus says there are two ways
[1:22:01] right one's broad one's easy one's very
[1:22:05] difficult
[1:22:07] how many feel like that how many feel
[1:22:09] like you're walking a narrow road
[1:22:11] it's hard to stay on this road praise
[1:22:13] god it's hard to stay close to christ
[1:22:17] jesus said it's not it's not broad it's
[1:22:18] not something you can just easily walk
[1:22:20] into every day
[1:22:21] you've got to really you've really got
[1:22:22] to got to watch your path you really got
[1:22:24] to watch your steps praise god
[1:22:28] two gates two ways there's two kinds of
[1:22:31] prophets
[1:22:31] two kinds of preachers there's two kinds
[1:22:34] of trees
[1:22:35] with two kinds of fruits two kinds of
[1:22:38] builders
[1:22:39] on two kinds of foundations
[1:22:45] i'm so glad aren't you glad god made it
[1:22:47] easy it's either one or the other
[1:22:49] aren't you glad like isn't glad tonight
[1:22:51] you know you're either one of the other
[1:22:53] i'm either saved or i'm lost thank god
[1:22:55] i'm saved
[1:23:01] in church there's two kinds of builders
[1:23:03] there's workers of iniquity
[1:23:05] and there's wise workers
[1:23:09] and the difference is between sayers
[1:23:12] versus doers glory
[1:23:16] like white hot there it is right there
[1:23:17] white hot
[1:23:19] white hot is someone who knows the word
[1:23:20] and does it
[1:23:23] remember at the end of matthew 7 you
[1:23:25] have you have those that are saved
[1:23:27] they're doers of the word they build
[1:23:29] their life upon the foundation rock of
[1:23:31] christ
[1:23:32] but you have just the sayers that say
[1:23:34] lord lord did we not do this
[1:23:35] and he said you workers of iniquity i
[1:23:37] never knew you
[1:23:40] they just said it they just said lord
[1:23:41] lord but their life every day didn't
[1:23:44] work for jesus christ
[1:23:48] so iniquity-filled builders give god lip
[1:23:52] service
[1:23:54] but fail to do god's will wise workers
[1:23:58] perform god's will praise god
[1:24:03] let's be wise workers i'm going to be
[1:24:04] wise workers let's seek
[1:24:07] let's find let's enter the straight gate
[1:24:09] let's enter the narrow gate
[1:24:11] leading to eternal life praise god amen
[1:24:15] let's not take the easy way of life
[1:24:17] let's take the hard way of life
[1:24:20] fighting and battling against every
[1:24:22] demon power
[1:24:27] ma look at that church both prophets
[1:24:29] look like sheep
[1:24:30] both of them look like sheep but jesus
[1:24:32] says
[1:24:33] by their fruits you'll know them
[1:24:37] a wolf will the bible says it'll eat up
[1:24:39] your life
[1:24:40] it'll eat up it'll take away it'll take
[1:24:42] away your joy right i'll take away your
[1:24:44] money right
[1:24:45] mouse so they creep into houses and for
[1:24:46] after money
[1:24:49] so a wolf will ravage your life it'll
[1:24:51] destroy your life and just take away
[1:24:52] your joy take away your peace
[1:24:54] all these things but a real shepherd
[1:24:56] will build you up in christ
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:02] greedy wolves
[1:25:06] they destroy they destroy lives they
[1:25:08] destroy churches
[1:25:14] but the good the the true sheep right
[1:25:17] and the true trees
[1:25:18] the godly trees they're known by their
[1:25:21] godly fruits
[1:25:23] and by their lives praise god that's the
[1:25:26] end of our feet i'll
[1:25:27] stop right there musicians you can come
[1:25:29] here
[1:25:39] let's continue building our house upon
[1:25:41] the rock of god's word
[1:25:44] so when the storms come how many know
[1:25:46] the storms are going to come
[1:25:48] in jesus's parable church there wasn't
[1:25:50] an option where no storms come upon your
[1:25:52] house i'm sorry
[1:25:53] if that disappoints you or surprise you
[1:25:55] i'm sorry about that
[1:25:57] but in both kinds of foundation whether
[1:25:59] it's sand or rock
[1:26:01] huge storms come
[1:26:04] and only one of them stands only one
[1:26:07] house
[1:26:08] stands that's the doer of the word
[1:26:12] those who those who hear the word and do
[1:26:15] it
[1:26:16] and act upon it
[1:26:22] that's where i want to stand i want to
[1:26:24] stand on christ
[1:26:26] you have a song in your heart on crisis
[1:26:29] solid rock i stand amen
[1:26:38] uh we just love god's word don't we
[1:26:40] church rains and floods cannot destroy
[1:26:44] the real christian life it's built to
[1:26:47] last praise god
[1:26:51] there's a great falling away predicted
[1:26:54] in the last days
[1:26:55] that's for workers of iniquity who
[1:26:57] houses are built on sand
[1:27:00] they haven't built upon the truth of
[1:27:01] god's word
[1:27:04] but you and i church we will not fall
[1:27:07] away
[1:27:07] but we will stand that's what paul said
[1:27:09] with the armor of god
[1:27:10] he said when you've got the word of god
[1:27:12] having done all
[1:27:14] stand upon god's word let's stand on
[1:27:17] god's word praise god
