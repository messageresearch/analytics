========================================

yeah let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 4 I want to preach chapter 4 tonight if I can by the help of the Lord 1 Corinthians chapter 4 again thank you for your understanding last week and know I didn't want to take a chance with snow being on the roads um you know we just my wife and I talk about like what would happen if one of you got stranded on the roads like we like we'd feel really bad so we don't want to take a chance couple years ago I took a chance and uh we were driving home on 76 we slid across and we bumped into the back of another car but thank God they got out I mean it was poor and snow it was it was awful so ever since then I've been a little more reserved about having church if there's snow coming but I learned uh I learned a good lesson and uh thank goodness there was no you know reported accent or anything like that so I just thankful for that I I took that as God's mercy on me my immaturity so 1 Corinthians chapter 4 verse one we'll just read verse one by God's grace let's read that on three one two three let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated here praise God I have a some slides I want to show so I just want to quickly review those uh Mysteries you know I got a book about of course but just to remind you it's it's quite fitting or to me it's quite amazing um that there's 12 Bible defined Mysteries there we go thought finally get to them okay right and so just interesting to remember there's 12 there's 12 defined Mysteries Kingdom of Heaven is in Matthew 13 one body of Jew and Gentiles Gentiles in uh Ephesians 2 The Rapture it's called a mystery in 1 Corinthians 15 the church is the bride is in Ephesians 5 Israel's blindness and this is all from my memory here hopefully by God's grace I don't mess it up Israel's blindness was Romans 11 the will of God is Ephesians 1 Seven Stars Revelation 1 mystery of iniquity is 2 Thessalonians 2 mystery Babylon is Revelation 17 mystery of godliness 1 Timothy 3:16 Myster of the godhead Colossians 2:2 and Christ in you is Colossians 1 26 and 27 so I think it's fitting you know there's 12 New Testament Mysteries and remember this was I believe this was typed in a couple ways uh we know it was typed there in the Holy place right with 12 loaves of bread also it was typed remember Church Elijah had to on Mount Carmel remember what he had to do he had to take stones and rebuild the altar how many were there how many M 12 so think about that Elijah had to restore the altar of worship with 12 Stones brother brandham was the had the spirit of Elijah so it's a very and brother Bram actually used that type of uh Mount Carmel Showdown Mount Transfiguration Showdown then Mount Zion Showdown so brother raham actually uses that type so I think it's beautiful in other words God used brother brandom to finish the mysteries of God and then what the fire can fall the Rapture can happen Hallelujah so it's not it's not well known that's why I wrote it you know because I felt God inspired it to my heart uh there if there's 12 uh Mysteries that are defined there's got to be a purpose behind that Hallelujah there's an Old Testament purpose and there's got to be a new testament purpose Hallelujah remember that's called the bread of his face remember the Bible says the shoe bread is called the bread of his face so as you eat that bread you're eating in the face of God so Church we're eating the word of God hallelujah the true word of God we're not eating a dead bread we're not eating a molded bread tonight how many understand that that's why brother R said you can never denominate the message the message will never become stale because it's God's thus sayith the lord of the mysteries of God it is the mind of Christ oh we're so blessed my sometimes we just got to pinch ourselves and remember how blessed we are so hopefully we can pinch ourselves tonight by God's grace without uh breaking any skin Hallelujah so uh now this is Scofield's outline for this chapter uh I don't know how long I'll preach tonight we might be longer it might be shorter but I think it'd be shorter but the first eight verses deal with uh Judgment of Christ servants is not committ to men because remember what's what's the context he's still dealing I think about this for four chapters he's dealing with these people in the Church of Corinth that were exalting preachers too highly so he's finally going to bring a close to that uh topic with all this man worship think of that man Worship in the Church of the Living God right so what does it show the Church of the Living God is going to have problems they're going to still have their Humanity they got to overcome their sinful nature they got to overcome their thoughts amen Amen brother Simon that's right Hallelujah they got to overcome their evil thoughts they got to overcome uh their sin nature right because that's your your worst enemy is yourself okay but think about that for four the better part of four chapters Paul's trying to get them to see that we're all we're all just Servants of God there's no preacher that's any greater now he might have a greater responsibility but as far as as we'll see tonight as Paul's going to tell them where did that preacher get his ability not from himself he got it from God so Paul is going to remind us here tonight just about preachers so this was a church that was uh basically Church pre I'm sorry preacher worshippers to some degree and it caused such a division well we're better we're more spiritual because we're from Paul Paul saved us or no uh Peter saved us Apollo saved us well only Christ saved us uh so this is how you would combat that with here's here's Paul's ending to this here's how you combat preacher worship he's going to end it with this chapter four here and then he ends it by of course showing Paul's example of humility and then he starts bringing in some Apostolic Authority here at the end of the chapter which you'll see uh by God's grace so so uh we see it like this preachers preachers are just preachers but then God gives some more Authority than others God gives some more responsibility than others Hallelujah and so you'll see how Paul kind of calls them uh to the carpet we'd say uh for rejecting his ministry and maybe not following him like they ought to and church that's it's so important for us to follow brother brandom as he followed Christ in other words you take what take we we recognize brother R was a prophet of God a church age messenger and but we got to still take everything he said back to the word of God hallelujah so uh let me move on here now again I I changed a few of these words here but we're in the second part of with their carnal divided condition uh think about that a church with all those gifts operating all the time were still divided so I imagine you'd have like one family over here that would do give and then another family over here that would have their gifts and then a family in the back that would do gifts and they would all just uh try sometimes they interrupt each other and Paul said let it be one at a time please hallelujah amen think about that they had this this family had these gifts that family of that you know they had all these gifts there but they were just trying to uh compete a little bit Paul said there can't be competition uh there's an order to the the plan of God there's no confusion there's not there's supposed to be no confusion in the family of God in the house of God either Hallelujah so he's got to you know rebuke them there here in in the the seventh section with spiritual gifts and charity and he's got to get the church in one Accord how many you happy to be in one Accord here tonight I I sure am again I keep thanking God every time I go back to this I'm like thank you Lord for the little church that we have praise God uh we're not maybe big or well known or anything like that but as long as God knows us that's all that matters Hallelujah as long as we get to see Jesus's face and he'll say Well done that's all that matters and remember you know they had they had so many so many problems they had division which was basically Pride sexual morality uh they had uh legal issues drunkenness uh that the the rich people were mistreating the poor uh they had just chaos with spiritual gifts not in order uh uh just just too much going on and they even lacked generosity to Paul they weren't very kind to the prophet of God the the preacher that actually established the church they kind of forgotten about him he was kind of like the old the old old God and we kind of moved on from him and uh we're moving on to new and better things and our preachers are are more eloquent than him right that's kind of what they were getting at and then they of course through that they suffered false teachers so they got the people that would just make them maybe shout or get them emotional or maybe get really intellectual and use different words but Paul said when I come among you I just know Christ and him crucified so see he had to just humble himself like that and just bring he just had to be different than these uh false teachers okay so chapter 4 let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God so here we see Paul explains preachers are to be viewed as overseers so you should see me and other preachers like brother Simon brother uh Brooks brother uh cam we got brother uh uh can't think of brother Jim Shoemake sorry brother Jim if he's listening it took me a minute to think of our brother uh brother Brian Pastor brother Jim she sorry brother Jim love you buddy uh but you know look at us we're we're just overseeing what God is doing we're just PL we're trying to plant God's seeds and we're trying to water God's seeds right but again God gives the increase but it's but what are we overseers up Paul says look at us as overseers of the mystery so the shoe bread right the bread right we can use that we can use that symbolism right that's what the uh Old Testament priests did once a week they would replace the bread they put fresh bread down and eat the bread that that that was uh close to getting old but it never got old in the presence of God but every week they replace it then they would eat that bread right there right there in the presence of God the the uh the the bread of God's face right in the worship of the Lord and so now Paul gives us that same imagery that's what new testament preachers do so think about uh think about how blessed we are that we understand the mystery of the godhead right or we understand the mystery of the Rapture think how think how blessed we are to understand these things a lot of churches you know they're not even get the people ready for a Rapture they just think Jesus is going to come back one day and say I'm here and the W the corridors of Heaven brother going to drop down and he's going to come right to the Catholic church or right to the Methodist Church or right to the World Council churches said I here I am I'm your savior now the Millennium is going to start but Jesus said Paul said differently he said I'm coming like a thief in the night he said and live in such a way that you're counted worthy to escape the tribulation period Hallelujah so they only look at certain scriptures they don't look at the whole scripture but preachers I I we're supposed to be overseers I'm supposed to oversee and make sure that the mysteries of God are taught the correct way that's Paul says that's our job Hallelujah oversee and make sure we manage we are superintendant or overseers of the mysteries of God hallelujah and notice he says Mysteries so that means there's more than one right so some people misunderstand Revelation 10:7 they say oh finish the mystery of God they say oh it's just one mystery like it's just the godhead or it's just uh you know some other mystery but that just means Revelation 107 just means it's saying God's going to finish all the Bible defined Mysteries Hallelujah because Paul says here we're stewards of more than one mystery the mysteries of God hallelujah so we see it plainly and then uh Paul's going to further explain the role the preacher to help the Corinthians overcome their man worship right and divisions that it was causing okay uh so so Paul's trying to get them to see look preachers are just overseeing in other words preachers don't own the church and the church said I don't own you I'm not a lord over you right I don't tell you what to do I tell you what the word says hallelujah but I've got to live it first Hallelujah right I'm just watching over God's sheep right I'm just I'm just watching this belongs to God everything here belongs to God hallelujah but we just watch over it for a little time you ever think about that you ever think about that what would happen if brother Jesse passed away what would you do you know what would the local church do you know you got to be you got to think about that you know because I'm just an overseer right or what if God called brother Jesse and his family to move to Germany something like that you know who knows you know some people have hinted me brother Jesse uh I'm getting older would you ever want to come out and be the pastor when I when I retire I'm like nope uh I'll pray about it because I kind of know their Church situation I don't want to be a part of that um you know and that that would be all just you know human idea without the Leaning of the lord we got to be led by the Holy Spirit but you got to think about that I'm just I'm just overseeing I'm just making sure I'm supposed to watch over your souls if somebody gets in trouble I see somebody outline I'll say I'll text them or call them or talk to them after service is everything going okay can I help you out with something because I'm just overseeing right I can give my thoughts about what you should do but ultimately it's got to be you and God hallelujah yeah also Paul mentioned the mystery of God remember earlier in the letter so again he's bringing this up idea of the mysteries of God because he said we don't speak uh the wisdom of the world we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery Hallelujah that's why people can't understand many times our sermons if we try to explain it to them uh then you got to explain brother Bram you got to say explain the church ages then you got to explain the seven angels you know the seven churches it it's just really deep it's not a light shallow word it's a deep word hallelujah and so that's okay so you can expect that when you're trying to explain things you know it's going to take a little longer time and it's okay if they don't understand it the world won't understand it but the elect will Hallelujah Paul said that's and we're just stewards of those Mysteries we're just watching over make sure that the mystery of God is revealed to the people of God hallelujah and you know like I like I said and thank God church God or the Mysteries For Your Glory but the only Glory that you could have is Christ in you the hope of glory again it's not again these preachers are nobody special even the no nobody's uh special uh the only Glory we have is if God would so grace us with his Spirit to live inside of us amen that's the only hope we have for glory amen that's why that's why they call Christ and you the hope of glory It's Our Hope of being glorified having a glorified body is Jesus Christ Living in us in our soul and then giving us a new body Hallelujah in a glorified State verse two moreover it's required of stewards that a man be found faithful now remember Paul's saying this to the church there in Corinth they had preachers but some of them weren't all faithful so Paul said you got to be faithful with the mystery of God but with me it's a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man's judgment yay I judge not my own self so there's one thing that's required of me amongst all the I I was reminded there's over 20 requirements for a preacher in the Bible a new testament preacher New Testament right first Timothy 3 uh and then numerous other verses there's just there's 15 just in 1 Timothy chapter 3 I've got to live all those requirements Hallelujah so but I I'm reminded faithfulness is one of those requirements faithfulness to the mysteries of God hallelujah I have to Faithfully watch over and preach the mystery of God hallelujah now look Paul says here he says I he's not concerned about how others judge his faithfulness right he says it's a very small thing see I'm not really concerned that I I should be judge of you or any man he said I really can't even judge myself Christ is going to be the judge he's the real judge right because we we're always lenient with ourselves right we can judge other people man that person is so bad look at but when it comes to us uh yeah God gave me Grace for that right we we can always judge the other guy or the other girl we can always judge them real good but oh when it comes to me oh well God's going to have mercy on me of course verse four for I know nothing by myself isn't that so humble a prophet of God who seen Jesus Christ I don't know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby justified in other words I can't justify myself God has to justify me and he that is ultimately going to judge me is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now look Paul says he wasn't aware of any wrongs in his ministry see see I I don't know nothing by myself I don't know that I actually did anything wrong he knew he could not justify himself Only God can judge the preachers ultimately now we're going to say say this soon but we can judge their fruits but God ultimately knows what they're going to turn out to be Hallelujah we are commanded by Jesus to judge them by their fruits right so we're commanded to judge that may that means make a decision about a certain situation but but we ultimately don't know what's going to happen on the day of judgment brother said there's going to be a lot of surprises on the day of judgment and we got even got in the Bible right even in the Bible they said they said Lord when do we see you sick and visit you when did we see you and we gave you food and uh hungry and and we fed you and thirsty we gave you water he said when you did it to the least of these my brethren you did it unto me Hallelujah so we can plainly see in the scripture there's going to be some surprise on the day of judgment Hallelujah but thank God the Bible said if we're born again we have boldness on that day Hallelujah in other words the bride won't be surprised that's what it means Hallelujah because we can see there's two resurrections for two judgments Hallelujah which we're going to end with that tonight by God's grace I put a YouTube video out about it a couple weeks ago so you'll probably be familiar with it if you watched it Hallelujah verse 5 therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come so what would that be the Rapture right or it would be the second coming for the white Throne judgment because there's there's more comings who both will bring to light the hidden things of Darkness now that's a awesome thing but that's also could be a scary thing if we have uh what do they call it skeletons in our closet that's like a worldest way to say it if we've got sin in our closet uh if we're aen or something like that see it could be a scary thing and will make manifest the counsels of Hearts now that's what I think is so amazing God will be able to manifest what was your counsel what was your thinking when you did this certain thing what was your actual motive and in behind it I hope it was good will because remember that's that's another meaning of Love Is Good Will you want good for the other person he's going to bring everything to light everything in darkness is going to come to light so we better confess it now so it don't come out Hallelujah and then shall every man have Praise of God so Paul expresses the wisdom for the Corinthians to not pass a final judgment on a ministry right a I'm talking about a final judgment we're supposed to judge current fruits brother remember I read that quote last week brother said judge your life by the current fruit you're producing so other words take take account of your life how am I living before God do you see any fruits in your current life you should right the fruits of the spirit the nine fruits of the spirit remember in the previous chapter he said some Ministries will have no reward likely due to secret or public sin because the fires are going to declare the fires of your life right or the fires of the fiery eyes of Jesus as the white Throne judgment Hallelujah either fire is going to manifest what our lives were really about who are we really living for oh let's live for Jesus amen let's live for him Hallelujah all hidden things will be brought to light and what is the praise of God what do you mean God's gonna say Oh Praise oh yeah yeah I praise you you're such a wonderful person no the praise is well done good and faithful servant that's the praise that's biblical praise Hallelujah so this is what you tell preacher worshippers right this is what you should tell them see because a preacher can hide we've I I just show you that example preachers hid things for 50 60 years they can hide things but you're not going to hide anything from Christ hallelujah it's all going to come out eventually verse 6 and these things Brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Paulo for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written now remember what's written give preachers double honor that doesn't mean worship them right just give them honor give them respect right but don't give them above double honor which will be worship see that no one of you be puffed up for one against another so see they lifted Peter so high he just like Untouchable they lifted Paul so high or Apollos was such an eloquent uh preacher that he's just so great like like we're just better than you guys our church is better than yours my my baptism when I got saved it was way better than when you came in the message right that's that's a prideful thing to say and so Paul says don't magnify myself or Apollos uh because both men didn't magnify themselves Paul doesn't walk around and say look how many Souls I won I'm so much better than Apollo Paul say look we transferred this figure to ourselves here we're trying to lead by example and show you that we never exalted ourselves so don't you exalt yourselves Paul wanted them to learn to avoid prideful divisions amongst preachers and those preachers who had converts for who maketh thee to differ from one another and uh that's a good question and what hast thou that thou did not receive so Paul was reminding them if Peter had a certain gift well didn't Peter get that from somewhere where' Peter get oh that's right that's right he got the keys of Kingdom from Jesus that's right he didn't pull those out of his own pocket and say look what I was born with look what I've got I'm such a great man or Apollo said yeah my mom or my dad made me this great oror I'm so eloquent because of my dad it's because of me no God gave him that ability and church that's why I think I think you recognize on Sunday I think you did a really wonderful job by God's grace you know I love to see when people come up for prayer but you recognize when God's dealing with you you recognize when God's preaching through someone's gift and it's not the preacher anymore it's God that's what we want to live we want to approach services like that we can realize okay this is beyond uh just coincidence this is beyond I I sense the Holy Spirit right and so that that's what that's what Paul's bringing out here everything that uh everything that was good about the preach came from God to benefit the body of Christ to make us better Christians now if thou did receive it if the preachers receive that eloquence or receive those keys or that that gift of faith brother call the gift of faith Bulldog Faith who's seen a bul you've SE have you seen a bulldog lately brother okay well brother Ram always explain it like a bulldog would grab on and just wouldn't let go so I don't know does that does that seem right okay aggressive okay so brother R would say or Roberts had Bulldog faith and you can watch you can watch his videos online I don't know I don't know it seemed like at the end he turned out a little way off way off the word but he would sit there on at the platform and he would just he would grab a hold of the people's heads and pray for them so sincerely his hair would be hanging down you know he was just so sincere sweating all over the place brother man said or were basically quote the word of God and he wouldn't let the word of God go until uh until the people receive their healing just Bulldog Faith just hanging on I believe it God's going to do it the word of faith Hallelujah so he calls that Bulldog Faith well where did or Roberts get that he got that from Jesus Hallelujah Bulldog Faith you know what you know what impressed people about brother brandom brother Bram didn't have to raise his voice remember uh some of the people that had seen uh there was TBN uh what was it Paul what was his last name CR Paul cruss he started TBN he saw brother brandom in the 1950s and he said what what made him different he said was a little 5 foot whatever he was man walked out there and he started explaining where sin came from and then when he got in the prayer line he didn't shout and scream he just rebuked Satan and asked everybody to Bow their heads and then they saw Miracle after Miracle after miracle and he realized that was more like Christ than uh that then maybe just shouting in Emotion all the time now you have both right you have both but uh where did he get that gift where did Brother get that gift where did or Robert get that gift they got it from God and the way you know it comes from God is God works behind it Hallelujah God strengthens the people behind it God heals the people when they pray for them Hallelujah glory to God so if you received it why do you glory so he's telling these all these divided people in the church why are you glorying in the man as if uh they didn't receive it as if they always had it why you worshiping the man worship the god that gave the gift alah give God the credit say thank God for the for the gift of God thank God for the move of the Holy Spirit praise God so God made each preacher different and gave them their different gifts preachers didn't give themselves their gifts but the Corinthians were glorifying the the men rather than glorifying Christ Hallelujah now he says now I don't know this is a a strange statement so I I this is one or two things this could be Paul using sarcasm and saying the Corinthians were exalting themselves and their false preachers and degrading Paul and his uh preaching companions or not he says now he says now ye are full so that might mean full of preachers or full of gifts he says now you are rich now he probably means naturally but it could be something else could be uh just have a lot of gifts again a lot of spiritual uh move lot of moves of the the gifts of the holy spirit ye have Reigns as kings with without us and I would to God ye did Reign that ye that we also might reign with you so I can for for sure say certainly true that the Corinthian Church was enjoying the benefits of the labors of the original Apostles right because when Christianity first started out persecution persecution persecution but then after a while remember it started relaxing a little bit okay well all right we'll just deal with the Christians we won't kill them all we'll just we'll just put up with them so it's clear you know Paul says I would to God ye did Reign that we also might reign with you so it seems like Paul's saying you know I wish that we were treated the same way you were because we're the ones that labored he's going to say we're the ones that labored so but Paul could be using sarcasm saying well you're rich and full and you're reigning as kings in other words we're not we're not exalting ourselves like you guys are exalting yourselves now verse 9 is interesting he said for I think that God has set us forth the apostles la or made made them least in other words as it were appointed to death right for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men okay so Paul's saying all the apostles were appointed to die for the gospel on the stage or theater of the visible and invisible world that word spectacle means a amp theater stage right and they were used to having those right in Corinth right all the the Greek and Roman places had where do you go for entertainment they didn't go to the movie theater they went to the amphitheater right so Paul's saying God has set us original Apostles we are Apostles and we're appointed to die on the stage of the world right now here's just I want to remind you how all these men died think about these are our heroes Church These are heroes here these are the Warriors of Faith the Hall of Fame of Faith James was stabbed with a sword and died that was the greater James the Lesser was stoned to death St Jude was filled with arrows died by arrows Philip was crucified by soldiers Thomas was thrust with a spear the one that doubted Christ he so believed that he let him he let himself be killed with the spear didn't fight back St Paul was beheaded in Rome St Peter was crucified upside down St John he was the only one that died a natural death Matthew was stabbed with a sword Judas of course hung himself the traitor uh Simon was crucified Bartholomew was flayed and then beheaded flayed St Andrew was crucified on an X shaped cross and Maas was crucified now who would want to live in that time and be one of those who wishes oh I wish I got the lot who's going to take judas's place I hope that lot falls on me you know what you're getting into you know what you're asking for that's what that's what he got he took judas's spot and he got a crucifixion for that's why the Bible said of whom the world isn't worthy of these kind of people the world's not worthy of people that would sacrifice their lives for the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah real men we also see though how Paul now we can see why Paul would say the Saints will judge Angels right because even the demons are looking at the Believers here as uh players in a play they're watching and trying to influence and trying to U mess up their lives and try to get them to fall spiritually right they're interacting and they're trying to cause them to stumble don't you know well we know the Bible says Satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour right but see this is why uh God had Paul say We'll judge we'll be a witness against the evil spirits we're fighting against spiritual wickedness in high places Hallelujah amen so we see what a what an importance it is and I was thinking of uh uh the queen of the South remember she she'll she'll judge she'll be a witness against all those Pharisees because she crossed the desert to get to Solomon and a greater than Solomon was there Hallelujah Jesus right so what do we see if you if if you want to be used by God you got to give everything you can to stand up for the truth if you want Jesus to pray raise you and say Well done now I'm not talking worship I'm talking about saying well done you know what I'm talking about but it's for the live stream people that don't know me or whatever they're trying to criticize me or something like that if you want Jesus to say Well done you got to let your T you got look at your life and say what in my life do I need to give up in order to support the Gospel of Jesus Christ right but those Pharisees wouldn't even go across the desert they wouldn't even go across the street they wouldn't even uh they wouldn't even humble themselves and repent recognize this is true this man's preaching the truth they weren't willing uh to leave their Cash Cow right they they weren't weren't willing to to leave their moneymaking schemes and their false religions so it shows to us we must do everything we can back up the word of God with everything we got and Jesus will say Well done amen like the queen of South Hallelujah she her whole life was focused on getting to the truth knowing the truth knowing the true God giving God all you have serving God with all your heart let that be our desire tonight amen like these rugged men of the faith Hallelujah whom the world is not worthy verse 10 we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ so again this might be sarcasm or it might be uh expressing the shame that he and the early Apostles endured so younger Christians would be better prepared and have more benefits right so we know our lives are a lot easier now because we can just go on our phones right and I'm not going to show any funny pictures like I did that one time on my iPad I was all wondering why are you laughing what did I say that was ah then my wife told me in the van later okay so I deleted those off my iPad I got them saved elsewhere but you know we we can just we can do two clicks and we're hearing brother brandom they didn't have that do we know how blessed we are they had to do the real and just sit down and like a movie show and watch the real and then replace the real they didn't have a fast forward they didn't have a listen to it at at Double speed all right so Paul's saying we're fools but you're wise we're weak but you're strong you're honorable we are despised Hallelujah so he's either being sarcastic or expressing that we have it so much better because people have gone before us and labored for us I I tell you what I'm so thankful God God anointed all those people to listen brother RAM and type out every single word it makes my life so much easier H many times numerous people email me brother Jesse can you find this quote yeah let me type it in so easy it's so easy I'm thankful for the labors of the Saints Hallelujah that have just given their lives decades uh hours Untold hours so for me to write a few little books or make a few videos that's easy I didn't do the hard work they did all the hard work some of those videos I can do in half an hour or 45 minutes if I'm really moving fast or something like that can get a lot done fast but that's because of the labors of those who've gone before us hallelujah so I want to be thankful for that ver uh I'm sorry I forgot I was going to inject something in there I don't remember what it was now maybe I just forgot to take it out verse 11 even unto this present hour we both hunger now here Paul's talking about his group of preachers the older Apostles with him and either even uh Timothy so uh the Corinthians were not in this state right they had everything they were in a a port city uh that was we'd say the the Greek capital of Rome right we dealt with that earlier in the series but Paul and his his uh preachers were hungry thirsty naked so didn't have all the clothes they needed they were buffeted and had no certain dwelling place right so they wandered from here to there not knowing exactly where they're going to lay their head for the night and this is this this is this is on the stage of life right everybody's watching these people so you have these the Corinthians they they and they have everything opposites they have all the water the food they got all the clothes they have beautiful homes and then these preachers these vagamon preachers come in they're not as well spoken Paul Paul said I'm fearing and trembling when I'm among you he was a fearful man you there was times he was really humble really really nervous didn't have all the food uh which which which your houses can I stay at tonight Saints you know or you know what I'll just set up a tent one of your backyards because I'm a tent maker I I I don't want to bother anybody is there just some maybe some public park or some place I can set up my tent and all these other guys in the church at cor they're rich they got all these mansions and big houses what a what a contrast but they're so prideful they just become used to this church we got to be careful not to get used to things right remember the good old gospel amen remember the oldfashioned Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now thankfully in a small Church like this we can do that more easily probably brother R said you build a big church he said usually when people build a church they backslide on God right because think oh everything's done everything's good and we just got everything made now and so they stop caring about the spiritual things of God can't let that happen to us verse 12 and we labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless see people tear us down we're supposed to bless them Hallelujah being persecuted we just go through it we suffer it that's just part of life that's just part of being a Christian I I'll just suffer through I'll just get through it I'll have long suffering Hallelujah right because that's one of the attributes of love right charity charity suffers long not only that Paul was being defamed and but we entreat so we we plead for Mercy for these people who speaking evil against us is that how you don't you feel sorry for people that mistreat you and speak evil things about brother R don't you feel sorry about that we should be intreating for them we should be interceding for them we're made as the filth or the refu refuse or trash of the world and we're the offscouring so offscouring is just the scraping you know how you scrape things off your plate throw in the trash or whatever that's what Paul said that's what we are we're the stuff you scrape off in the trash we are the trash right of all things unto this day so hardly a good word for Paul and yet he's the one that started the church now look look at the mercy that is in Paul's heart for these people he started the church and I'm going to pull that verse yet before I forget he's the one that started the church and this is the respect that they got for him where is it uh oh yeah okay yeah got a lot of emails today really I thought it was on top it's way down a little lower Paul had started the church he had uh been used by God Jesus protected him remember uh when we looked at the beginning he said I got many people in this city but I'll say he but Jesus didn't tell us how what what these many people were like there were many immature people not many uh stallion Saints or something like that or pedigree stallions these these are immature little babies here right church is that right Church you understand that there's message churches that are mature and there's baby message churches sometimes you got a mixture of both in the congregation you would think the people the man that started the church you would think they would honor him and respect him nope they stopped doing it and he became like trash and this guy's in prison this guy he become like trash to them I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons think about that can you express love to someone who would call you trash could you do that are do we do that oh you're just a trashy Preacher Brother Jess and I have to look at them and say they're beloved they're they're just lovely people they're such lovely people that takes the love of God really takes the love of God Paul lived on a higher level and this church said he lived in the fears in the Heavenly places in the love of God even though people call me trash even though uh they don't listen to me they're still my beloved children talk about Grace so see he said I'm not writing these things to shame you but to warn you you know I was reading through U yeah that's right uh Ezekiel this week but I think it was last week that and Ezekiel he's the one who who wrote about the Watchmen on the Watchtower and the whole point of the Watchman was to look stay up all night and if he saw swords and horses coming he had to let them know or the blood of the people was on his hands and God said Ezekiel you're the Watchman tell the people all their sins so as a preacher I'm responsible at times if if you tell me or if God anoints me I got to call out sins and you got to do it to me too right but you need two or three Witnesses against a preacher right or a pastor in the mouth of two or three Witnesses right don't receive any witness brother gave the example with Orman Neville someone says I saw Orman Neville drunk brother said you better go get a second witness and bring some proof right so we're we're in this together if we're wrong God's going to make us right if we really want to be right Hallelujah he's going to correct us because we're God's children so again he's bringing out this different look at the stark contrast between the prideful preachers Rich uh everything's eloquent everything's perfect divisions chaos no church order versus The Humble poor Paul and his people fear trembling not super well spoken what a contrast that happened in just a few number of years a few years of the church and now they've already moved away from Paul so far because of pride of course then sensuality you know with the sexual sins and money and uh the love of money's root of all evil so we know that got in there too for though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ boy this this pastor had a lot of guest preachers in there 10,000 guest preachers yet have not ye many fathers so there wasn't a lot of people that could really uh give them a real uh you know yield to the Holy Spirit and give them a real experience with Christ just people tell you what to do oh you know you should do this for this this for gifts this for communion you should do that with that situation with the man and stepmom just instructing you what to do but not many real fathers who tell you the truth Hallelujah now I don't know how many I know maybe one or two I don't know how many of us had really good Fathers ah you're too sweet but for us adults you know I don't know how many of us had really good Fathers but Paul would have been a spiritual father he would been a great father and here's what a father does a father remember he started off the letter by saying all the good things then he said you know what here's where you're short he's a real father in The Gospel Hallelujah for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel so remember who's the who's the preacher God used to really bring you to the gospel truth that'd be a spiritual father right I've told you about mine I thanked him on Father's day to kind of bring me to the the message and the truth and I I kind of could even look at Simon kind of that way you know in fact he's the one that kind of uh just wouldn't let me leave Thanksgiving night without me listening to that serpent seed sermon he just had that and I just said okay brother okay I promise you we'll listen to it um but I thank God for all the faithful fathers in the gospel that have led us to the truth verse 16 wherefore I beseech you be followers of me so he's begging now he's now he's getting into begging beseech means to beg entreat please please follow me because why I've seen Jesus Christ I've seen him I was out in Arabia he revealed the message to me remember Galatians chapter one he said uh he called me to bring you out of the power of darkness and bring you into light Hallelujah so he said follow me follow the church age messenger Hallelujah let's follow brother Ram's Ministry because it's a bible-based Ministry Hallelujah now here's a good one you can use this for all your doctrines I've used this in my book this is a beautiful scripture for this cause have I sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church now that is a awesome scripture that means Paul taught women should not cut their hair and men should cut their hair in every church right Paul didn't compromis he taught them all the same thing this means he baptized them the same way in every church that means he called out homosexuality in every church right church he said Timothy's going to tell you everything that I teach CU I teach the same thing in every Church Hallelujah that's what I try to do you know when I get little uh Evangelistic invitations you know like Kentucky and Iowa I try to preach the same thing I preach right here in fact I always preach a sermon that I've already preached to to all of you so you're aware of it you know because I don't really get new things all the time you know uh as far as some great Revelation or some new understanding or something like that but I want to be as faithful I want to teach the same thing in every church that's what Paul did Paul was faithful Hallelujah and again you can take that I think in my book I have uh I think it's 14 in the the 2021 book I have 14 Pauline doctrines that most churches do not teach so we would say they're not uh they're not faithful to Paul's gospel they're not faithful to the the true Gospel of Jesus Christ but by God's grace we teach all of them we preach all of them hallelujah we're preaching what Paul preached hallelujah amen now he says now some are puffed up as though I would not come unto you now look some are even prideful like oh there's no way Paul's going to come back he's he's all washed up he just writes and he says it later uh you know he just writes weighty letters he just warns people with letters he actually won't come and actually correct us to our face but Paul says you just wait I'm going to come Hallelujah there's prideful people saying oh he's not going to come he don't want to deal with it face to face right but that's Pride that would would be puffed up verse 19 but I will come to you shortly I like this if the Lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power let's see what what's behind those words what kind of character is behind those words those threats all that Pride for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power or Revelation right or obedience to the word of God hallelujah verse vers 21 what will ye shall I come to you with a rod or in love or in the spirit of meekness so see what would a father sometimes fathers have to spank right even mamas right mamas sometimes moms got to spank with a rod they got to bring a rod of Correction now that's what he's going to do in the next chapter he's going to bring a rod against the man that was sleeping with the Stepmom kick that man out of the church don't even eat with anybody that's committing sexual sin like that don't even eat with them give give them over of Satan that Satan might destroy their body that their soul could be saved that's a rod that's a spanking get that person why are you so why he says it later why why are you so puffed up that you haven't mourned over this sexual sin now does he come in love yes he brings in love in Chapter 13 We Looked at Love was he in meekness yes he said I Came In Fear and Trembling in Chapter 2 he said that I come in fear and trembling he said but when I come how do you want me to come amongst you do you want me to bring a rod do you want me to come in love or in the spirit of meekness now we find out later when Paul finally gets there they actually repented of a lot of these things right we'll get that in the we'll get to that Lord willing in second Corinthians he thanks them and remember he tells him he said don't let that brother mourn too much try to encourage him isn't that something Satan will get somebody so Brash well I'll sleep with whoever I want but then when they then but then when God finally gets them to repent and then Satan will get them on the other side oh you'll never be forgiven you don't you shouldn't even go to church you're you're so filthy and you're so wicked nobody wants to be with you it's just from one to the other but Paul says encourage that man who repented encourage him you know thank God God save you thank God God can forgive you he's washed you in his Precious Blood amen encourage that guy because Satan's here trying to get you to be prideful with your sin or beat you up and make you feel bad about it you got to find right down the middle and know I'm washing the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah so I stand I stand as a Christian that's in uh the second letter there second Corinthians I'm almost done hard to believe now uh one thing if you got your Bible go to 2 Corinthians 12:15 this is one thing I want to say I've said this before but I'm going to say it again 2 Corinthians 12:15 you know in in relationships it's you're either The Giver or you're the taker in every Rel relationship you're either a giver or a taker right and what does Paul tell them Paul tells him this letter at the end of his second letter and I'll be very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly I love you the less I Be Loved this has always struck me like oh my goodness Paul lives the example and church I've seen this in my life before I keep loving people and the more I love them the less they love me but see you got to I don't have it up there sorry but you got to recognize that if you're the mature person the real spiritual mature person you realize that I've got to keep loving them even though they're not returning any love to me that's what a Christian does boy how did this person cool off on me what did I do to them and realize I didn't do anything wrong right you even ask him did I do something no no no oh okay so this is a given I see I'm The Giver this relationship you're a taker in other words this person's immature this person's selfish I've got to be selfless that's what a Christian does that's what Jesus said Jesus said be like your heavenly father he sends rain on the just and the unjust whether they recognize it or not he's good to them he sends sun he sends rain he's good to people even if they're not good to him that's a real Christian character Paul kept loving these people people visiting them trying to correct them but the more he gave the less he got returned now our human our Humanity brother Austin we think oh I ought to get something back pretty soon goodness I mean I've send them this and I've done that I've done that when are they ever going to acknowledge it and but they might not but that's okay Jesus does hallelujah you can out give God hallelujah remember do it to them like you're doing it to Jesus Hallelujah I love this the more you love people sometimes the less they're going to love you that's okay that's what we're called to do we must be like our heavenly father right isn't he isn't he now less loved than ever before but what does he keep doing keep going it's Clockwork sun's coming up tomorrow Clockwork that paycheck's going to come in in the mail right Clockwork just love love even though sometimes even us are his children even us we're Unfaithful even us we make mistakes we sin and yet he's still faithful to us the more he loves the less he's loved by the world so we have to increase our love for Jesus continue to grow love the Lord so you you see this with Paul's relationship the more he loved them and even corrected them the more he gave to them right then the less they loved him back he said that's okay the reason I can love is because Jesus loved me first and so I just I just got Lov in my heart I just have to love whether people love me or not I've got to keep loving them so how many want to be a real Giver because in every relationship there's givers and takers let's be givers of God's love Hallelujah I'm almost done actually I just want to finish with this so a couple weeks ago I put out this uh I thought this would be good to uh preach because I had not preached it uh I don't have slides for all these verses so I have some of them but not all of them kind of ran out time there at the end of the day judgment seat of Christ now remember Paul said he that's spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man so we have to remember we have to have that filter we have have to have a thinking man's filter the word of God filters everything that comes through we got to it filters out anything anything sinful filters out of our Lives that's so we got to remember that we have to judge all things because one day all of our lives are going to be judged so that's why we got to judge all things because everything in our life is going to be judged right or wrong then he said in chapter three now he that planteth he that WTH or one every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor so the question I got was brother Jesse can you explain the Judgment seat of Christ and it was a good question it said how can uh how can verses say we won't come into judgment but then the Bible said everyone will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ excellent question I've wondered that myself so I didn't have a video on it so I said yeah I'll study that out I'll make a video on it by God's grace so so the Judgment seat of Christ for us is judgment to rewards that's the whole thing when when it says for the bride you'll stand before the Judgment seat of Christ is to stand there to be given your reward now where're to judge the fruits of preachers Jesus said that Matthew 7:16 but God judges their final destination okay every man's work I preached this a couple weeks ago Every Man's work will be made manifest the day will declared because it will be revealed by fire either the fires of jesus' eyes or the fiery Trials of Life probably both and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abide which we have built thereon he shall receive a reward Allelujah so see we're judged for rewards if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire so the fire of God's eyes right looks on him on Mercy he must have confessed his sins he gets no reward other than eternal life that's the foolish virgin we pl plainly see that in the scripture now I'm going to read these Romans 14:10 there's two scriptures that talk about everybody standing before the Judgment seat of Christ verse 10 but why Dost thou judge thy brother about meats and holy days and all these things or why does thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ everybody say all ready oh we're all going to stand before Christ like I did a couple weeks ago I said Malachi Smith come on up Jesse Smith come on up Austin ly come on we're all going to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ look at he's look at that he's going to be seated on the Judgment seat we're coming before the judge the holy judge all of us got to stand there and those fiery eyes are going to just reveal what's in our heart and life for it is written I as I live sayith the Lord every knee shall bow to me every tongue shall confess to God so let then so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God brother Austin what' you do with what I gave you right brother Jesse what' you do with what I gave you what you do with it well Lord I I I dedicated my life to you Lord Jesus everyone we're all going to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ so in this context Paul's saying don't judge somebody because they eat this and they got holy days here and the church said second Corinthians 5:9 wherefore we labor that whether we present or absent we may be accepted of him that's why we labor so God will accept our works we're working for him for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad I love it God just makes it so simple did you do good or did you do bad oh God help me to do good Hallelujah help me to do good because it's either going to be good or bad he just makes it so simple you're either one or the other let's be good by the grace of God now I'm not going to read these because of time but uh Jesus said uh verely let's read this one this is one of brother's most I think be loves scripture that's just my thought John 5:24 this is one like we said you might want to say this every night before you you you go to sleep verily verily I say Toto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life how many believe tonight you have everlasting life amen and shall not come into condemnation but is pass Glory from Death unto life hallelujah amen amen you're a new creature in Christ Jesus we all can see Austin's a new creature amen thank god brother Hallelujah we can all see as a new creature that was funny we were telling the stories a few weeks ago about how he used to act we were just laughing that's the same thing we do when I talk about my old days too but it's just funny because we can all see it we can all see he's a new creature in Christ Hallelujah the old things have passed away behold all things are become new Hallelujah and the the believer the real believer in Christ won't come to be condemned because he's already passed from Death un life he's already a new person remember Roman 7 says that you were married to uh the the your old life of sin but that's you're dead that life is dead and now you're married to Christ hallelujah amen your old spouse is dead and so you're free from the law of sin and death amen hallelujah you're free from that and you're married to Christen oh what a husband Hallelujah Romans 8 833 says who shall lay anything to the account of God's elect hallelujah it's God that justifies us amen see nobody can put any condemnation on you because Jesus already paid the price for it it's already put away it's already been abolished Hallelujah say it's like putting ink in a a bottle of Clorox right it all spreads out and you don't see it anymore it's all gone Hallelujah all my sins are gone you ask me why I'm happy I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone Satan got you Satan you got me into trouble but Jesus got me out amen I'm glad my sins are gone Hallelujah Glory now in Matthew 25 there's two Parables there's parable of the talents and parable of uh the white Throne judgment and there's two Praises let's read those Matthew 5:21 I'm sorry Matthew 25:21 sorry well I thought I'd be done here 25:21 his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou Hast been Faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord this is to the wise virgin okay so this is the praise of God well done you've been Faithful over a few enter into the joys of the Lord that's his praise to you the the wise virgin now the foolish virgins in 33 and 34 look but look what he still says now that's what he would say to Abraham right here's what he would say to lot let's skip down to verse 34 then shall the king say to them on the right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world Come Ye blessed and inherit what the inheritance I have for you but the other one sounds a lot better well done good and faithful servant you've been faithful I'll make you rule over much enter into the joys of the Lord who do you say more to the wise virgin can you ever see that Hallelujah all right then and the Bible said 1 John 4:17 I'm going read that here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world so in other words we are ambassadors of Jesus Jus Christ that's what Paul says in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 I believe it is we're ambassadors so we're the representatives of Christ but what's our attitude on the day of judgment boldness so we'll be able to walk up as I as I showed that as I dramatized that we'll be able to walk up kind of there with boldness be like thank you Lord I know where I stand by Your Grace has brought me this far here uh here's the account of my life and I'll say it with boldness because I know my life he's clean he's clean my life he's washed my life he changed my life he's the one that gave me life Hallelujah so we have boldness in one aspect on the day of judgment we know who we are we know we're the children of God now here's a last few visuals now I'm sorry it's smaller than what I meant to be but remember there's two resurrections the first resurrection is after the Rapture that's for the living dead and the wise virgin Christians it's the resurrection unto life Jesus says in MA John 5:24 the second Resurrection is the white Throne judgement I'm sure you're familiar with this it's for unbelievers and foolish virgin Christians it's also called the white Throne judgment or Resurrection unto judgment there's all the verses there you got all the verses for the first resurrection and then the verses for the second Resurrection now what what what what we do is we go to the Judgment seat of Christ and there's at least three things that happen at the Judgment seat of Christ first we're presented to Christ as a Chase version to Christ think about that we we presented as a spotless bride that's why all you sisters like to get married with the white dress on right and all the little ones want to grow up and do just like you we all now all the little ones want to be like Lena because they all saw it maybe one day I'll be like Lena that's good she should be your role model Hallelujah you got to see it but that's what Paul said I'm going to present the the Corinthian Church the same church that had people sleeping around suing people prideful divisions I'm going to present those that repented as a chased Virgin of Christ amen the Corinthian Church is going to walk down the aisle like Lena did in the perfect harmony of everything perfect decorations and Harmony and everything looking perfect we're presented so after the Rapture we go to the marriage supper lamb there's a presentation uh we believe the church age Messengers will present the Believers as a chased virgin to Christ Paul will say here's the first church age these are your this is your bride from the First Church H then the second third fourth fifth six then brother R comes in the seventh and presents us as a Chase version of Christ that's what the Bible said Paul will present them as a Chase virgin and then rewards are given out that's what we're talking about the J we must all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ to be given rewards you were Faithful over these things now you be ruler over this that's your reward so you're not done ruling when you die you just got started amen hallelujah praise God we're just getting started ruling over sin Hallelujah ruling over uh the Millennium Nations cities Hallelujah you get your reward that's the Judgment seat of Christ the Judgment seat of Christ for the bride rewards and also there's communion uh after the battle after Abraham won the battle that he had uh communion with MDC right and then Jesus said uh after the battle I'll drink the vine a new with with you in my father's Kingdom now the father's Kingdom's got to be up in heaven because Jesus said I'm going to have my own throne in the Millennium the son of David Hallelujah so everybody can see that so there's at least three things we do during the marriage supper of the Lamb while the world is going through the Great Tribulation period there's at least three things one of them is we get judged for rewards I want everybody say rewards ready rewards not to condemnation rewards there's a Payday coming Hal hallelujah hallelujah probably won't see on this side but we'll get rewarded on that side we'll all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and it'll show all the good that we did all the bad's forgiven and the church said who shall lay any charge to God's elect amen no one there there'll be no one here to be able to say anything bad about you why because the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven you Hallelujah you're dressed in white amen ah you're unblamable without rebuke Hallelujah we'll all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ to receive what we've done in our bodies what have we done for Jesus Christ let's make our whole lives about Jesus Christ can we do that by the grace of God Amen remember there these are the three steps the Rapture is the ceremony right the marriage supper that's the reception where we get rewards communion presentation we come down here at the end of the battle of Armageddon Jesus Burns over the Earth with fire we walk out on the ashes of the wicked into the honeymoon the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign which brother Ram said is more important or more wonderful than we ever could have thought or imagined let's stand to our feet musicians could come so I just want to end with that here tonight I want to end with that tonight let's picture that in our minds that we we all will stand before the Judgment seat of Christ now we know the only way we could ever have only good is if the blood of Jesus Christ washed us clean Hallelujah so we're all trusting in that tonight but what we want to pray about as we close is Lord make help me to make every part of my life about you so I'm rewarded at the end of The Journey Hallelujah remember you can still be saved and but everything think about that we talked about that a few weeks ago everything in your whole life would be burned and just no rewards for anything because it was all about you but only what's done for others will last so let's look at our lives tonight let's make sure our lives are everything that we do is for other people by the grace of God let's bow our heads and remember there's going to be times in relationships where you're The Giver and the more you love the less you're loved but you must do it that proves you're a true child of God when you can love those that don't love you back so Mo uh friends Saints take a moment think about your life is there anything in your life may be questionable and you want to give it over to the Lord is there an area where you want to say Lord help me with this area of my life I want this area to glorify [Music] you maybe there's a relationship it's harder because a person has changed they're not loving you back but you want to say tonight Lord help me to love the unlovable help me to be like St Paul which ultimately would be like you Heavenly Father you love those who don't love you back seems like the more I Tred to to be friendly the less I'm Lov back how many would say Lord give me the strength to love the unlovable let's pray together father God you know the needs of the people Lord God this is such a beautiful chapter Lord the prophet's last chapter before he moves on to the different the next type of sin Lord we're thankful for the scripture Lord It's thus sayith the lord it's inspired of the holy spirit it's God breathe to us Lord you breathe out this word to us through a prophet named Paul we're thankful for that Lord God lord we're all going to come and stand before that judgment seat Lord Lord Jesus we're going to and Lord I imagine as I just think about now we're all going to get on a knee before you every knee shall bow every tongue will confess Jesus Christ is Lord first we want to say thank you for for the blood That Forgives all of our sins Lord we never want to forget those scriptures we shall not come into condemnation because we pass from Death unto life thank you God for such beautiful promises Lord thank you that no man can lay anything to our charge because God has Justified us we're thankful for those scriptures here tonight Lord I'm so thankful Lord God cuz I know of myself I'm a failure I know I'm My Own Worst Enemy at times [Music] Lord thank you for the encouragement of the scripture tonight Lord Lord give us boldness Lord for that day give us a holy boldness where we know we're going to stand before Christ but we've surrendered everything to Christ so we can have boldness we surrendered Pride we surrendered any lust we surrendered any sin Lord that we struggle with the sin that so easily besets us Lord God we want to hear you say Well done you've been faithful I'll make you ruler enter into the joys of the Lord Hallelujah Lord God father May each person look at his or her life Lord I'm looking at my life Lord God help me to make my life all about you Lord Jesus every single area Lord God I know the areas I
