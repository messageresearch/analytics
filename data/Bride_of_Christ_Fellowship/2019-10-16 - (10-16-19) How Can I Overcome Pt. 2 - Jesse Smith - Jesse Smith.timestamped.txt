[21:05] it's gonna be the house the Lord praise
[21:07] the Lord
[21:08] let's pray my wife is kind of feeling
[21:11] sick she's felt sick the last few days I
[21:12] remember her in prayer by God's grace
[21:15] just a lot of stomach pain let's just
[21:18] remember her in prayer Lydia and Acacia
[21:20] I had to stay home to watch Genevieve so
[21:22] there with her but let's pray for a
[21:24] speedy recovery for my wife by the grace
[21:28] of the Lord also let's pray I mentioned
[21:31] a woman on Sunday I didn't get a chance
[21:33] to talk to her yet maybe I'll see you
[21:34] tomorrow but her name's Brenda and she
[21:35] looks like she's just found some pride
[21:37] there but let's just remember her in a
[21:39] word of Prayer here tonight I wanted to
[21:42] write that down and I didn't want to
[21:43] forget that also I heard back from
[21:45] Austin he had a good report he said
[21:48] thanks for your prayers he said it seems
[21:50] like God is doing supernatural things as
[21:53] far as getting him he said has to be
[21:56] divine intervention he was just sending
[21:57] me a text right before church he said I
[22:00] believe God is trying to answer all you
[22:02] and the girls prayers
[22:05] so he said weird things are happening I
[22:07] can only say they're divine intervention
[22:10] so he said I think I'll be home sooner
[22:12] than I thought so let's hope for that he
[22:14] said he's gotten some good favor with
[22:17] the court system there as he's going
[22:20] through some things some mistakes he
[22:21] made but hopefully he's learning for
[22:23] them so that was a good report today by
[22:25] God's grace also I talked with both
[22:27] Simon and he flew out yesterday to
[22:29] Thailand I haven't heard from him today
[22:31] but hopefully he arrives safely let's
[22:33] pray for him that he'll arrive safely he
[22:35] has two weeks there to preach and they
[22:37] got quite a few services lined up he
[22:39] said and he
[22:42] said the offerings we sent will be very
[22:44] helpful he said over there in Thailand
[22:46] people won't come to your service unless
[22:47] you feed them as well so he said it's
[22:49] gonna cost eight hundred dollars for one
[22:52] meal to get people to come so they can
[22:54] hear the preach and he said it's worth
[22:56] it and so thank the Lord for that I know
[22:59] that they do that in the Philippines as
[23:00] well they what they'll pay for the
[23:02] Philippine ministers denominational
[23:04] brothers to come and they'll feed them
[23:06] and then they'll sit there and listen to
[23:07] preaching but hundreds of churches have
[23:10] started because of that so let's let's
[23:12] pray that at least one church will start
[23:13] because of this by the grace of Lord so
[23:16] you know there's a there's a different
[23:17] number of elected every country you know
[23:19] we don't know how many lek there are but
[23:21] everybody deserves a chance to hear
[23:23] whether you pay for their food or not
[23:24] everybody deserves a chance to hear
[23:26] praise God so let's pray for those also
[23:30] this Sunday night we'll have communion
[23:31] at 4 o'clock we'll make the 4 p.m.
[23:33] service communion by God's grace and

[37:45] thing so we're just keep praying for her

[37:50] life that's why I keep praying I said
[37:53] Lord just please honor her you know she
[37:55] done so much for me and my children I
[37:57] said Lord just please honor her
[37:58] faithfulness and her her faith just a
[38:01] true blessing where would I be without
[38:03] my wife amen
[38:05] I wouldn't have much of my life I'll
[38:06] tell you that so thank the Lord I wanted
[38:09] to start with something real quick
[38:10] brother amen had a good question for me
[38:12] on Sunday
[38:13] - Wednesdays ago I preached on the
[38:15] labors and the vineyard you remember
[38:16] that where each labor got the same
[38:18] reward you know and some in the parable
[38:21] the first the the the first our workers
[38:24] got kind of upset they murmur a little
[38:26] bit against God and so brother Amen said
[38:30] he had a good question he his wife we're
[38:31] talking about it and he just he was kind
[38:34] of wondering was that was that parable
[38:37] meaning everybody gets the same reward
[38:39] and and I said well it means the same
[38:41] reward as far as eternal life but
[38:44] remember Jesus talked about some rewards
[38:46] are thirty sixty hundred you know and
[38:49] brother Brahim said there's degrees in
[38:51] heaven so that was a great question I
[38:53] thought that was a really good question
[38:54] I just thought I'd share with everybody
[38:56] and I'm sorry I didn't say that when I
[38:58] preached it I should have said that that
[38:59] yes everybody gets the same reward
[39:02] eternal life but beyond that you know in
[39:04] the Millennium there'll be great rule
[39:06] greater rewards for different levels of
[39:08] faithfulness right so we know that you
[39:11] know some will be over five cities some
[39:13] ten cities
[39:13] that's probably millennium I don't know
[39:15] about the future home now maybe in the
[39:17] future home at some point God will send
[39:19] us out you know as this Holy Ghost
[39:21] filled Saints but it seems like we want
[39:24] to ever be with the Lord it seems like
[39:25] that's the whole purpose of salvation is
[39:27] so Jesus his bride can be with him hey
[39:29] but I don't know I like I said I don't
[39:31] we won't know Jesus will be revealing
[39:34] things to us throughout eternity program
[39:35] says that's the the Whitestone unknown
[39:39] thing program said that's the hidden
[39:40] manna that hidden stone there's a lot of
[39:42] hidden things that are gonna be a reward
[39:44] to us later on made known to us like the
[39:47] new name write the name of the Father
[39:50] and our new name and the name of the
[39:51] city you know there's all these new
[39:53] names we know and he hasn't revealed him
[39:56] yet but I thought that was a great
[39:57] question I just want to share that with
[39:59] you I didn't mean to mislead anybody or
[40:01] not say it right but yes the one reward
[40:03] we all get is eternal life but there are
[40:06] other rewards and to prove that Malachi
[40:09] pull up second John 1:8 2nd John 1:8
[40:14] just has another proof John 1:8
[40:21] I'm sorry 2nd John 1:8 I'm sorry too
[40:23] nice of you
[40:24] 2nd John money now here's the scripture
[40:26] I kind of came to my mind as I was
[40:27] meditating on his question look to
[40:29] yourselves that we lose not now CCP
[40:31] people can lose their reward right like
[40:34] Judas lost a huge reward he could have
[40:37] had a huge reward and we lose that those
[40:39] things which we have wrought but we
[40:42] receive a full reward so I think about
[40:45] like this brother William people that
[40:47] have left the message they they were
[40:48] building a good reward but they probably
[40:51] have lost it and the reason why is
[40:54] because they're trampling underfoot the
[40:56] things that they used to be sanctified
[40:57] by they say oh we don't need to wear
[41:00] seperate garments anymore sisters don't
[41:02] need to let their hair grow long anymore
[41:04] it's okay if men can smoke and drink and
[41:07] go to movies and joy rock and roll see
[41:10] they're they're trampling underfoot the
[41:12] very Saint the very word of God that
[41:15] sanctified them and so they they have to
[41:18] lose the reward of standing by the word
[41:20] because when they stood by the word they
[41:22] had reproach right they evil people
[41:26] spoke evil against and their family
[41:27] spoke evil against them and so they bore
[41:30] the reproach of that they went to a
[41:31] smaller church but now if they if they
[41:34] lose the thing if they leave the things
[41:36] of God now they have a bigger church now
[41:38] they're more popular now they have more
[41:40] friends supposedly friends but they're
[41:42] not true friends right so see they Paul
[41:45] or John says we want to receive a full
[41:47] reward praise God
[41:49] so that proves there will be different
[41:51] levels of reward some will receive
[41:54] different than others ok now go to 1st
[41:58] Corinthians 3 I just really want these
[42:01] to be embedded in our hearts that we can
[42:04] have a good understanding I'm gonna turn
[42:06] there in my Bible cuz I got a marked off
[42:07] here I'm just kind of going by memory at
[42:10] this point right now
[42:12] 1st Corinthians 3 about rewards yeah 1st
[42:25] Corinthians 3 so this is where yeah
[42:30] that's right brother good verse 8 yeah
[42:31] yep let's go to verse 8 now he Paul just
[42:34] got done rebuking them for them bragging
[42:36] about well I'm a Peter I'm of Apollo's
[42:38] I'm appalled some even say I'm a Peter
[42:41] I'm of Christ you know they even brag
[42:43] about being just I only follow Jesus I
[42:45] don't follow any man preacher but Paul
[42:48] rebukes him for that verse 8 now he that
[42:50] planteth and he that watereth are one
[42:53] and every man shall receive his own
[42:55] reward according to his own labor okay
[43:00] so we have an idea here we have an idea
[43:01] that everybody gets a different reward
[43:03] based upon their labor that's why I want
[43:06] to be laboring for Jesus no matter what
[43:07] praise God
[43:08] no matter who comes or who don't come no
[43:10] matter what I want to labor for Jesus
[43:12] amen
[43:13] like I was walking around in church
[43:15] today or they were either but you're
[43:16] before church I said Jesus this is all
[43:18] for you every every every square inch in
[43:21] here is all for the glory of Jesus
[43:24] I do this for Christ's glory not for any
[43:26] other glory but for Jesus praise God
[43:28] number verse 9 for we are labourers
[43:30] together with God ye are God's husbandry
[43:33] ye are God's building according to the
[43:36] grace of God which is given unto me as a
[43:38] wise master builder I've laid the
[43:39] foundation and another man built it
[43:41] there on but then every man take heed
[43:43] how he buildeth thereon I do thought I
[43:48] thought there was more about oh yeah go
[43:50] down to verse 13 every man's work shall
[43:55] be made manifest I like that because God
[43:58] God will show everybody's sincerity were
[44:00] they really sincere in their ministries
[44:02] or not I like that because I want to be
[44:05] sincere for the day shall declare no no
[44:08] it's that day that's the Judgment Day
[44:09] Judgment Day shall declare it because it
[44:13] shall be revealed by fire because
[44:15] remember the Bible said he's a consuming
[44:17] fire and there will be a fire right
[44:19] there'll be the eternal fire the lake of
[44:21] fire and if your name's not found in it
[44:22] the fire you'll be tossing the fire so
[44:24] the fire reveals it because it's
[44:27] judgment and the fire shall try every
[44:30] man's work of what sort it is if any
[44:33] man's work abide which he has built
[44:34] there on he shall receive a reward
[44:36] here's this is like a lot here if any
[44:38] man's work shall be burned he shall
[44:40] suffer loss but he himself shall be
[44:42] saved yet so as by fire not so the fire
[44:47] will reveal your heart you know now we
[44:50] can apply this to today though to the
[44:52] trials of our faith the fiery trials we
[44:54] go through reveal what we're made of as
[44:56] well I believe that said that's a duel
[44:58] that's a compound scripture there where
[45:01] you have via both truce the fires of
[45:04] Judgment Day will judge the works but
[45:06] the fiery trials now because remember
[45:08] Paul said the false doctrines today are
[45:11] here the heresies are here to manifest
[45:13] who's true and who's not so doctrine is
[45:17] an important thing doctrine is a major
[45:18] important thing because when you get the
[45:20] wrong doctrine it manifests you're on
[45:22] the wrong side that's right it manifests
[45:25] the heresies
[45:27] praise God okay so now I just thought
[45:30] I'd lay that in there just to kind of go
[45:31] along with that question I thought that
[45:33] was a great question I thought well if
[45:34] brother amen and his who were his wife
[45:36] we're talking about that I think
[45:37] maybe other people might have been
[45:38] wondering about that so hope that was a
[45:40] blessing now let's get back here to this
[45:43] how can I overcome now we started off
[45:45] with Laodicea and how it was an
[45:49] individual call because he's outside the
[45:50] church and he says he that overcomes so
[45:53] he was calling to the individual not not
[45:55] she has in the whole church because the
[45:57] already kicked her she already kicked
[45:59] him out and then program called it a doe
[46:01] degeneration right a doe degeneration
[46:03] and he says and I want to go over this
[46:05] again he that knoweth to do good and do
[46:07] it and not to him it's in and brother
[46:09] madam said that's your ministry so each
[46:11] one of us need to know our ministry and
[46:13] then do our ministry it's a sin to
[46:17] neglect our ministry and that's why
[46:19] we're gonna get to the next hopefully
[46:20] Sunday I want to get to the gifts of the
[46:21] Spirit again Pat pass out a better sheet
[46:24] so you have more room to write on it and
[46:25] give more examples and I want to go
[46:27] through that more thoroughly but
[46:29] everyone needs to know their their
[46:31] ministry so they can devote themselves
[46:32] to that and we must know to do good and
[46:37] then do it if not then it's send to us
[46:39] praise God
[46:41] then he says strive with all that's in
[46:44] you to stay in the life of Christ and to
[46:46] be fruit-bearing so once you find your
[46:48] ministry you want to dedicate yourself
[46:49] to that so it bears fruit so people can
[46:52] look at your life and say my what a
[46:54] blessing brother William this has been
[46:56] such a blessing to me or sister so and
[46:58] so there's been a great blessing to me
[47:00] you want to see the fruits of your
[47:01] Labor's that's right
[47:03] and now Laodicea was a great age because
[47:06] brother Branham said this is the age of
[47:07] the full baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:09] but it's striking that Christ is out of
[47:11] the church the very time he could he
[47:13] wants to fill every fiber of their being
[47:14] is the time they kicked him out Wow how
[47:17] sad that is but we invited him in praise
[47:20] God and we're gonna keep him in
[47:21] hallelujah amen that's right and then we
[47:25] looked at how brother and said the
[47:26] rapture is there's a foolish and wise
[47:29] and every day in every rapture
[47:31] Daniel was gonna stand with his lot and
[47:33] then only some of the saints or many of
[47:37] the Saints rose on the day on the
[47:38] resurrection not all and then brother
[47:41] and start talking about overcomers and
[47:42] we just got to Noah eight people that
[47:46] were saved and he said there's an ark
[47:47] and every day alright our Ark today is
[47:49] Jesus Christ
[47:51] and then brother BAM said we got after
[47:53] yield ourselves just like we yield are
[47:55] like a baby has to yield itself to its
[47:58] shirt right to put its arm in its shirt
[48:02] now I want to just read his next few
[48:04] coached now so this should be new things
[48:06] right here
[48:08] he said just yield to him say here Lord
[48:11] Here I am just be just be enough let me
[48:14] be nothing I yield put your hand in the
[48:16] right place that's victory that's the
[48:18] overcoming the thing to overcome is
[48:21] yourself
[48:22] your idea and surrender yourself to him
[48:25] he overcome for you he knows the way we
[48:29] don't I just want to take a moment on
[48:30] that he knows the way that you can
[48:33] overcome your battle right now many
[48:36] times Church many times I'll be honest I
[48:39] would have more victory if I knew how to
[48:41] overcome it
[48:42] right and so you'd probably say the same
[48:44] right if you knew the way to overcome it
[48:47] you would already overcome it right if
[48:50] you knew there was like if socially
[48:51] there's conflict in your family there's
[48:53] conflict with friends or like with our
[48:54] church conflict in the church if I knew
[48:56] there was a way to overcome that and and
[48:58] change people's minds I would do it
[49:00] right if I knew if I knew how the way to
[49:03] save someone so I would do it but I
[49:06] don't know it and that's part of our
[49:07] struggle right that's part of the the
[49:09] battle that we had say we want to be
[49:12] wise we want to be wise virgins because
[49:14] the Bible said he that winneth Souls is
[49:16] wise virgin we want to win souls but
[49:20] it's a difficult thing to do it's a
[49:21] great battle that we face we don't know
[49:24] how to do it but I want to just
[49:25] encourage you that he knows the way to
[49:27] do it we don't know the way alright and
[49:31] that's how it was like I told I gave
[49:33] that one example on Sunday I tried to
[49:35] witness to my wife my mother and it
[49:37] didn't go good at all how it was me
[49:39] trying to do it but then a few weeks
[49:40] later I witnessed the Tim Myers and now
[49:43] he's a full he's almost a full-time
[49:44] evangelist down in North Carolina for
[49:46] Tim Humes and Tim Humes was horse race
[49:49] and RAM church and so it it was so easy
[49:52] it was so hard with my mom because I was
[49:54] trying to do it but it was so easy with
[49:56] Tim Meyers because it was just God doing
[49:58] it was God putting my arm in the sleeve
[50:00] and and that's all it is we got a
[50:02] surrender but I tend to surrender I just
[50:05] my timing over there was Tim Meyers
[50:07] house and do a Bible study I've ever sit
[50:09] in his basement with three friends of
[50:11] his and two of them received it and the
[50:14] two rejected it but then later you know
[50:17] one of them fell away that rejected it
[50:18] they he don't he don't leave the message
[50:20] anymore either but Tim Meyers believes
[50:22] it praise God and I believe in amen
[50:24] you believe that's why we're here
[50:26] tonight amen we believe the message
[50:28] because it's God's revelation of his
[50:29] word that's right now he says but in
[50:35] Noah's sign there's eight eight
[50:36] overcomers that's all they were caught
[50:38] inside now he says the hours very late
[50:43] you might have a good intention he says
[50:45] but don't be caught outside be caught
[50:48] inside now don't struggle because it's
[50:51] not him that willeth I like that nor him
[50:54] that runneth but God that shows mercy
[50:56] praise God just let God just yield
[51:00] yourself to him and walk on with the
[51:03] perfect satisfied faith that what God
[51:05] has promised he's able to perform stuff
[51:08] to God walk with Him peaceful quiet not
[51:11] interrupted just keep on walking with
[51:14] him amen
[51:16] so see like Enoch he walked with God
[51:19] Abraham was a friend of God amen Noah
[51:24] found grace in the sight of God amen
[51:27] so see we gotta just receive the
[51:30] revelation and now it's not our will
[51:33] it's gonna get us it's gonna be able to
[51:35] produce the rapture now let me balance
[51:37] out I did say Loretta did say if you
[51:39] wish to go you can go but it's not gonna
[51:42] be our willpower that does it it's gonna
[51:44] be our surrender that's gonna do it
[51:46] because when we surrender then God does
[51:49] it hey how they do yeah praise God so
[51:52] it's not him that willeth to go in the
[51:54] rapture it's not gonna be by our power
[51:56] that oh if I have enough power I'll
[51:58] change my atoms right and my and my
[52:01] glorified body if I just think about
[52:03] enough will swallow up this natural body
[52:05] that's not going to do it but it's us
[52:07] yielding and saying God I'm gonna walk
[52:09] today with you I'm gonna walk tomorrow
[52:11] with you and pretty soon we're walking
[52:13] into the rapture praise God that's what
[52:16] it's going to have to be yielding
[52:17] ourselves
[52:19] peaceful quiet not interrupted in other
[52:22] words enjoying life how many enjoy life
[52:24] see we enjoy it because we're walking in
[52:27] the P of God and if you don't it's you
[52:31] need to get around some people that
[52:32] don't have the peace of God then you'll
[52:33] see what a great life you have right
[52:35] you'll see what great blessings that you
[52:38] have in our lives I was yesterday where
[52:40] we were Akron up for practice and I was
[52:43] talking to one of the parents and she
[52:45] looked at me and she said you are always
[52:46] so positive and it's just a joy to talk
[52:49] to you and I said well I was she said
[52:53] she's a Mormon and her husband read my
[52:56] book and he hasn't said nothing about it
[52:57] other than he liked it you know but but
[52:59] she said I just love how you're always
[53:02] so Pot you're always such an awful
[53:04] uplift and I said you know what that's
[53:05] because of God has given us so much
[53:08] grace in this hour and I said I could
[53:10] either choose to complain or I could
[53:12] choose to be happy and I'm gonna be
[53:14] happy for what Jesus did for us and she
[53:17] said I like that she said that's good I
[53:19] said well I mean that's the choice we
[53:21] have every day as Christians and my man
[53:23] said if anybody should be happy it
[53:25] should be us who know the message ain't
[53:27] ahead because of what we know amen this
[53:30] revelation doesn't make us discourage or
[53:32] frustrated this message sets us free
[53:34] amen it gives us hope it makes us look
[53:37] up to the sky in the morning and say
[53:39] this could be the day man
[53:41] this might be the day this might be the
[53:44] year it might be 2020 we we don't know
[53:47] but it gives us hope to know that we we
[53:50] believe all this Bible Church we believe
[53:53] all of this amen
[53:54] we're not like denominations that cut
[53:56] parts often and we believe everything
[53:59] praise God
[54:00] and we just got to peacefully walk on
[54:02] with God and say God I don't know how
[54:04] I'm gonna overcome all this but I'm
[54:06] gonna overcome all of it by your grace
[54:08] as I surrender you know the way for me
[54:12] to overcome my trial so you will guide
[54:15] me in it you'll your word will be a
[54:17] light unto my feet and a light unto my
[54:19] path amen
[54:21] I don't know how I'm gonna overcome
[54:23] these but I know you know the way and as
[54:25] I yield to you you'll help me be an
[54:27] overcomer because it takes both member
[54:29] churches both remember after Pentecost
[54:32] the Bible says
[54:33] the Lord worked with them see we're
[54:36] working with the Holy Spirit today thank
[54:38] God amen
[54:39] we're not working at oh we're just not
[54:40] working with the brothers are working
[54:42] with the sisters we're working with the
[54:44] Holy One the divine one the eternal one
[54:47] the resurrected one oh the mighty one
[54:50] we're working with Jesus Christ amen and
[54:52] we got it we got to do our part and then
[54:55] he does his part and we got to yield
[54:57] ourselves to him and he'll make us
[54:59] overcome amen hallelujah but see the
[55:02] victory is our yielding that's the part
[55:04] that can't be pushed through a pipe
[55:05] Jesus can't force you to yield the part
[55:08] of you going through the pipe is you
[55:10] surrendering and saying yes Lord I'll
[55:12] stop trying to do it myself I'll let you
[55:14] do it
[55:14] I'll obey your word now when you
[55:17] surrender that that is your that's your
[55:20] victory right there and I've been
[55:22] studying on this this week I've been
[55:23] studying really hard I've been real hard
[55:25] this week about the soul let me just
[55:28] drop this in here the soul is the nature
[55:31] of the Spirit and brother and said the
[55:33] soul is the part that has free more
[55:36] agency
[55:38] amen praise God that's what he said
[55:43] I got a quote from 1965 my dad said that
[55:45] the soul is the part of the Spirit it's
[55:48] the part that has the power of choice he
[55:52] said as the power of free more agency
[55:54] and then I went back I remember when I
[55:56] preached on the revelation series last
[55:58] or earlier this year and brother am said
[56:00] before you get in the Holies of Holies
[56:02] he said the veil is hanging there and he
[56:04] said that's the veil of self-will amen
[56:09] see you got a medicine you got a rent in
[56:11] the veil and you got to say God not my
[56:14] will but thy will be done I'm taking
[56:17] down the veil of my will by resin and
[56:19] then the Holy Ghost can come live in
[56:21] your your place Amen your soul amen so I
[56:28] just thought that would that be a real
[56:29] help to you it's a bit of help to me
[56:31] I've been really trying to study on this
[56:33] so it's a great deep thing I'm gonna
[56:35] preach on that Lord maybe Sunday - by
[56:37] God's grace I want to preach on your
[56:38] purpose with the gifts but the soul this
[56:40] has been a tremendous study on the soul
[56:42] it's so deep that it's it's been a great
[56:46] I've been telling
[56:46] wife about has been a great challenge
[56:47] but also great benefits and there's lots
[56:49] of scripture on it just to understand
[56:52] the soul because the soul can be filled
[56:55] the soul can be sealed the soul can be
[56:59] immersed and there's so many more I
[57:02] wrote down five five or six of them the
[57:06] soul can be rest at rest there's so many
[57:09] different things about the soul there's
[57:11] so many ways we describe the soul can be
[57:13] circumcised there it is
[57:14] amen so this soul is a great deep
[57:18] teaching it's a great mystery right but
[57:22] the Bible said you're born again of the
[57:24] incorruptible seed and the seed of God
[57:26] doesn't even sin amen so the soul is a
[57:30] great deep thing and this is how we get
[57:32] the victory we yield ourselves our will
[57:36] say God I don't want my will to be done
[57:37] this church I want your will to be done
[57:40] this church I know what my will to be
[57:42] done in my life
[57:43] I want the will of Christ to be done in
[57:44] my life and when you really when you and
[57:47] I really get that victory that's when we
[57:48] finally die out and that's when we're
[57:50] born again by the Holy Ghost amen
[57:52] and now when we pray it's just like
[57:55] Christ now of course they'll never be as
[57:56] glorious as him or as perfect as his but
[57:59] we do pray that Lord let your will be
[58:02] done not my will be done and we can pray
[58:05] it in a way that denominational scant we
[58:08] can pray in ways that people foolish
[58:11] version that they can't pray it like we
[58:13] can we should be able to pray and mean
[58:15] it and God sees that we're sincere about
[58:17] it when we can change our the way we
[58:19] dress right and when we can change our
[58:22] beliefs and used to be tongues the
[58:24] evidence but now it's the word is the
[58:26] evidence living the word and God sees
[58:29] that we've surrendered all because we
[58:31] take every word of God we believe every
[58:34] word and we surrender all of our free
[58:36] more agency and now God God is in our
[58:39] soul God is our nature amen that's the
[58:43] word I was going for nature and the
[58:45] Bible said we're partakers of the divine
[58:47] nature amen hallelujah so it's the neh
[58:52] it's a nature changing there's so many
[58:54] different aspects about the soul it's so
[58:56] deep I want to dig into that and uh Lord
[58:59] here in the future he said just yield
[59:03] yourself peaceful quiet not interrupted
[59:08] I heard a good quote the other day
[59:11] brother Ram said ever since I got the
[59:12] Holy Ghost I've been drunk every day of
[59:14] my life now that's in his soul but then
[59:18] I heard other quotes where he said
[59:19] everyday I feel so much pressure I feel
[59:21] like my head's gonna come off you you
[59:26] can you relate to that Church in your
[59:29] soul when you when we come to church
[59:30] it's like my we feel like you know we
[59:32] finally started living from the solar or
[59:34] in other words were you saying touch
[59:35] more with the soul and we feel oh it
[59:38] feels so good I can be here singing I
[59:40] feel so great but you take me about
[59:42] three hours ago at work I was how do I
[59:47] say this yeah and it feels like my
[59:50] head's gonna explode right but then just
[59:53] change the atmosphere hey amen change
[59:57] the atmosphere start listening to the
[59:58] control tower right and pretty soon we
[1:00:02] start feeling real good real happy
[1:00:04] joyful we got the joy of the Lord amen
[1:00:06] oh that's it's a great mystery brother
[1:00:11] William isn't it it's a great mystery it
[1:00:14] was a great mystery in Paul's day how he
[1:00:16] could he could be so on he could do such
[1:00:19] great miracles in some places but other
[1:00:21] places he couldn't do miracles other
[1:00:23] times he'd be victorious doing miracles
[1:00:25] and other times he had his his eyes were
[1:00:28] good give him trouble
[1:00:29] other times the coppersmith run him out
[1:00:31] of town instead of him instead of
[1:00:33] smiting this one blind he this one run
[1:00:36] him out of town
[1:00:37] it was so humble being locked up in a
[1:00:40] prison for months and months on end you
[1:00:43] know just without a coat we said bring
[1:00:45] my coat bring my cloak you know think
[1:00:48] about that this the the paradox that a
[1:00:51] believer is they're sinful and they're
[1:00:54] in their body their mind isn't totally
[1:00:56] cleaned out but in their soul it is the
[1:00:59] nature of God amen
[1:01:01] it is a miracle of God that was
[1:01:04] unavailable in the Old Testament but now
[1:01:06] it was hid from ages but now it's been
[1:01:09] revealed Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:13] oh my gosh you to preach on the soul
[1:01:15] tonight amen
[1:01:17] yeah but man sir just yield to him but
[1:01:23] when I was talking to a man that had a
[1:01:25] mental breakdown now I've never had a
[1:01:26] mental breakdown has anybody here had a
[1:01:28] mental breakdown okay
[1:01:29] I know then the reason I say that's
[1:01:31] because I've known pastors about my age
[1:01:33] I've had mental breakdowns and they'll
[1:01:36] told me he said he was just a pastor now
[1:01:38] he would just cry for days on end
[1:01:41] because of all the pressure from church
[1:01:44] leaders and perturbed politics and I've
[1:01:48] never had a mental breakdown
[1:01:49] but Bertram's talking about overcoming
[1:01:51] and what he advised a man who had a
[1:01:53] mental breakdown
[1:01:54] he said just yield to him he's here he
[1:01:58] knowed what you have done and what
[1:02:00] caused your being and doing this way and
[1:02:02] all that he knows about you and now he's
[1:02:05] just told you back just what to do
[1:02:07] now I said only thing you have to do is
[1:02:09] just go do it
[1:02:10] that is that is forget all about the
[1:02:13] best walk live for the future in the
[1:02:16] glory and presence of God amen so this
[1:02:20] man had a breakdown about his past and
[1:02:22] my dad said go do this to make it right
[1:02:24] and then after you make a right after
[1:02:26] you obey the Holy Spirit walk forward
[1:02:28] and the glory of God amen
[1:02:30] forget about it don't let Satan just
[1:02:34] bring your past back to you but press on
[1:02:37] toward the mark of the high calling in
[1:02:39] Jesus after you make it right
[1:02:41] press on in the glory and that joy of
[1:02:44] the Lord amen
[1:02:45] because remember the breakdowns not in
[1:02:48] your soul the breakdowns in your mind
[1:02:50] amen and that's where it should be
[1:02:53] because that's the greatest battle ever
[1:02:54] fought is going on right there and
[1:02:56] sometimes we will struggle sometimes we
[1:02:59] may have a mental breakdown but see God
[1:03:01] allows it all for his glory
[1:03:03] now that pastors had a mental breakdown
[1:03:06] by the way him he can minister to
[1:03:07] somebody I can't all I can do is point
[1:03:10] you to this quote but I can't really
[1:03:12] tell you what it's like or how I
[1:03:14] overcome that but this man can right but
[1:03:18] I can't help somebody who's been
[1:03:19] addicted to drugs I can help you on that
[1:03:20] one
[1:03:21] I know what that's like okay or other
[1:03:24] addictions I can I can relax or some
[1:03:27] there but see God has a special ring for
[1:03:29] everybody's testimony praise God he's
[1:03:32] got a special sound to it he's got a
[1:03:35] special ring to it because we all
[1:03:36] overcome by the blood but we all got a
[1:03:38] word for our testimony praise God
[1:03:42] now I got 20 minutes so here that's
[1:03:45] that's a preached 45
[1:03:46] now the next overcomer he names is
[1:03:49] Daniel so he goes from Noah to Daniel
[1:03:53] here's what he says about Daniel some
[1:03:55] some important things I want to read
[1:03:57] this now if you got your Bibles go to
[1:03:59] Hebrews 11 well let's read us while you
[1:04:02] turn there Hebrews 11:6 Malachi
[1:04:04] let me read about Daniel now in the time
[1:04:07] of Daniel there was only four over
[1:04:10] comers that could stand the test of fire
[1:04:13] and lion he says fire and lion what you
[1:04:21] know that's gonna be awesome we're gonna
[1:04:22] get to heaven who testify and say what
[1:04:24] did you overcome and they're gonna say I
[1:04:25] overcame lions Daniels gonna say I
[1:04:27] overcame lions Shadrach Meshach Abednego
[1:04:30] Oh tell us about how you overcame oh we
[1:04:33] overcame the fire a church what are we
[1:04:36] gonna overcome we're gonna overcome laio
[1:04:39] - CIA men riches and the spirit of greed
[1:04:45] and and and money and Mammon right we're
[1:04:49] gonna overcome all those things the
[1:04:52] Bible said if you overcome you'll sit
[1:04:54] with me on my throne amen hallelujah
[1:04:56] praise God
[1:04:57] we've got a great thing to overcome and
[1:04:59] I'll say like this even though we're not
[1:05:01] fighting natural lines we're fighting
[1:05:03] spiritual lines because Satan is like a
[1:05:05] roaring lion right seeking whom he may
[1:05:08] devour praise God
[1:05:10] so seeing God's sight we're all we're
[1:05:13] all fighting great battles praise God
[1:05:15] we've all got we're all being hunted
[1:05:18] down but we're all overcoming by the
[1:05:20] grace of God now he says there's only
[1:05:23] for overcomers now he says we are
[1:05:25] expected to be tested by the babson so I
[1:05:29] want to remind us of that sometimes we
[1:05:30] just just eat myself sometimes I get so
[1:05:33] weary with tested or with Tess then I
[1:05:36] start to feel sorry for myself because I
[1:05:38] go through different tests
[1:05:39] you know trials here are different
[1:05:40] here but Romero says take the other
[1:05:43] attitude that's what I need take the
[1:05:46] attitude like I'm expecting a test today
[1:05:48] in other words I know I'm gonna fight
[1:05:51] today I'm ready to fight and there are
[1:05:53] times I am like that I know we are we
[1:05:55] all are right there are times that we
[1:05:57] get up in the morning oh I'm ready to go
[1:05:59] pray I'm ready to go fight those demons
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:01] other times we get weary of our battles
[1:06:03] right and we just wish they could it all
[1:06:05] be over and the church said right we
[1:06:09] always smile I just wish it could be
[1:06:10] done with and go on to heaven to have a
[1:06:12] perfect body can't wait to step into my
[1:06:14] a theophany
[1:06:15] ah we all feel like that but Moran said
[1:06:19] take this attitude like Daniel we're
[1:06:21] expected to be tested
[1:06:25] he said he that cometh to God must first
[1:06:28] be tested tested with what with the word
[1:06:32] that's God's test do you believe it he
[1:06:35] come he that cometh to God must be
[1:06:37] tested that only shows a true child then
[1:06:40] is he who's tested now here's a
[1:06:44] scripture that he's mentioning without
[1:06:46] faith is impossible to please him for he
[1:06:48] that cometh to God must believe that he
[1:06:49] is and he's a rewarder of them that
[1:06:52] diligently seek Him see without faith
[1:06:54] see either coming to God must believe
[1:06:57] and the only way to believe is to
[1:06:59] overcome unbelief to be tested praise
[1:07:02] God if you would maokai go to Hebrews
[1:07:07] 12:5 this is a real beautiful scripture
[1:07:09] obviously now we all want to be
[1:07:15] overcomers right what program says you
[1:07:17] can't overcome unless you got a test
[1:07:19] give to you right we all want to be
[1:07:23] overcome we all want to sit on the
[1:07:24] throne with Jesus we all know we're a
[1:07:26] crown and then throw it at his feet and
[1:07:27] fall on our faces like the saints in
[1:07:30] heaven we already do that but we got to
[1:07:32] have a test first and we got to overcome
[1:07:34] it we got to get victory over it but
[1:07:37] Hebrews 12:5 you have forgotten the
[1:07:39] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:07:41] unto children my son despise not thou
[1:07:43] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[1:07:45] when thou art rebuked of him for whom
[1:07:48] the Lord loveth he chase honest and
[1:07:49] scourge every son whom he receives if
[1:07:53] you
[1:07:54] no chastening God deals with you as with
[1:07:56] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:07:59] Jason's not amen now Jason there
[1:08:03] actually he literally means to spank or
[1:08:05] to whip or beat I'll never feel like
[1:08:08] God's beaten you don't raise your hand
[1:08:09] if you don't even but the by by that's
[1:08:12] the Bible says scourge there it's a
[1:08:14] scourge it is a physical pain so God is
[1:08:18] going to give us a strong whipping when
[1:08:20] we when we fall short of God's glory
[1:08:22] right because he knows that we want to
[1:08:24] do right he knows we want to overcome
[1:08:27] but we compromise and we get tired or we
[1:08:30] make excuses or we get we we follow the
[1:08:33] lust of the eyes or the lust of the
[1:08:35] flesh or the pride of life and so God
[1:08:37] has got to spank us to get us back in
[1:08:39] order
[1:08:39] amen he says you can't overcome unless
[1:08:44] you have a test given to you and he said
[1:08:48] the test is given to see if you can
[1:08:50] overcome or not and Jesus said to him
[1:08:52] that overcometh the test the test is the
[1:08:56] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[1:08:58] hey man how many appreciate that quote I
[1:09:01] heard that for years
[1:09:02] I've heard that for years but we charge
[1:09:05] we got let it sink in and realize this
[1:09:07] is the greatest thing that ever happened
[1:09:08] to me
[1:09:09] whatever trial you know God allows me to
[1:09:12] go through whatever seems like a
[1:09:14] constant grind or a constant battle or
[1:09:16] constant frustration if we're trying to
[1:09:20] overcome it but haven't we got to look
[1:09:22] at it like brother Branham said this is
[1:09:24] the greatest thing that happened to me
[1:09:25] because it keeps me seeking God amen
[1:09:28] hallelujah the greatest thing that ever
[1:09:32] happened to me was the test so let's
[1:09:38] just a good brother Rams life a little
[1:09:39] bit so brother Branham falling falling
[1:09:42] and disobeying God at the beginning and
[1:09:45] following his mother-in-law I'm not
[1:09:47] going to Pentecostals and suffering the
[1:09:49] flood and then the loss of his family
[1:09:50] that was one of the greatest things ever
[1:09:52] happened to him because the next time he
[1:09:55] wouldn't compromise right program giving
[1:09:58] in to the ministers at South Africa
[1:09:59] where I got amoebas and almost died and
[1:10:02] nine months couldn't preach anymore that
[1:10:04] was one of the greatest things that ever
[1:10:05] happened to him
[1:10:07] ah Church think about your hardest times
[1:10:10] of your life if it was a the response of
[1:10:15] some failure did it really was one of
[1:10:17] the greatest things that ever happened
[1:10:19] to you because it taught you and train
[1:10:21] you to obey God's Word the next time and
[1:10:24] to overcome that temptation amen now
[1:10:30] brother improves it's the greatest thing
[1:10:33] that ever happened to you
[1:10:34] first Peter 1 verse 6 Malachi proved it
[1:10:39] brother Branham of course he will Peter
[1:10:42] says the trials are the greatest thing
[1:10:45] that ever happened to you and I can say
[1:10:52] like this you know some of my greatest
[1:10:53] trials have I told you the greatest
[1:10:54] trials I go through outside of my
[1:10:56] personal battles my mind battles is with
[1:10:59] church members that come to our church
[1:11:00] stay for a while then leave those are
[1:11:02] some of my greatest battles but I can
[1:11:04] look back and say they are the best
[1:11:06] thing that happened to me because they
[1:11:08] they take my roots deeper in the soil of
[1:11:11] God amen
[1:11:12] they make me dig deeper to find out what
[1:11:14] do I really believe what did brother Ram
[1:11:16] really say what does the Bible say about
[1:11:18] this and so my trials within the church
[1:11:21] actually make me put my roots down
[1:11:24] deeper help me to dig in and make sure I
[1:11:27] really know where I stand amen
[1:11:29] hallelujah they give me more of a
[1:11:31] backbone they give me more confidence
[1:11:33] that God's Word is right now I'm in the
[1:11:35] truth that I haven't denied the faith
[1:11:37] that I fought the good fight and I'll
[1:11:39] run the course amen hallelujah
[1:11:42] so trials are the greatest thing that
[1:11:44] ever happened to you 1st Peter 1:6
[1:11:48] wherein you greatly rejoice there he
[1:11:51] says rejoice about it though now for a
[1:11:53] season if need be you are in heaviness
[1:11:55] through manifold temptations they're
[1:11:56] going through awful and they were going
[1:11:58] through physical tribulation in Peters
[1:12:00] day that the trial of your faith being
[1:12:03] much more precious than of gold that
[1:12:06] perishes though it be tried with fire
[1:12:08] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:12:11] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:12:14] so when's your payday for all these
[1:12:16] trials the rapture amen when you get
[1:12:20] paid back
[1:12:20] all these precious trials at the rapture
[1:12:22] that's what you get payback because
[1:12:25] you'll see him see you get you thought
[1:12:27] you found it if your your trials your
[1:12:30] victories are to the praise at the
[1:12:32] appearing of Jesus Christ much more
[1:12:35] precious than gold hallelujah amen more
[1:12:39] precious so he says I'll say it again
[1:12:41] the test is the greatest thing that ever
[1:12:44] happened to you
[1:12:48] he said it's testing time it's one good
[1:12:51] evidence that God is with us when we're
[1:12:53] tested amen for all children of God are
[1:12:56] tested and tried hallelujah praise God
[1:13:01] that's beautiful so simple but yet so
[1:13:05] true and how many appreciate reminders
[1:13:07] like that I do I really appreciate that
[1:13:09] it's a real blessing to be assured of
[1:13:12] these things the test is the greatest
[1:13:14] thing that ever happened to you now
[1:13:16] here's the finishing the quotes on Dan
[1:13:18] you've got a few more quotes and Daniel
[1:13:22] a man Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:13:25] Daniel was the Prophet and that was the
[1:13:29] size of the church in that day I mean
[1:13:31] the bride talked about a little flock
[1:13:35] brother William my man we're massive
[1:13:38] compared to them
[1:13:39] I think I was counting on Sunday I
[1:13:41] forgot how many we had here like maybe
[1:13:43] 12 or 13 I thought man they only had
[1:13:45] four we have three times their church
[1:13:49] the bride and Daniel's day had four
[1:13:52] people in it in his City four and yet
[1:13:56] they overcome by believing the word and
[1:13:58] although the main way they overcome was
[1:14:01] by prayer and by not compromising
[1:14:03] because remember the three Hebrew
[1:14:04] children said even if God doesn't save
[1:14:07] us I'm not bowing to these homosexual
[1:14:09] agenda amen
[1:14:11] hallelujah I'm not bowing to this
[1:14:14] sports-loving Society praise God I'm not
[1:14:17] bowing this money loving money-grubbing
[1:14:19] Society they make me want to skip church
[1:14:22] to make more money I'm not bowing to
[1:14:24] anything and even if God doesn't deliver
[1:14:26] me I'll still bless His Holy Name Amen
[1:14:29] I'm not bowing to it he said he said I
[1:14:33] mean the
[1:14:33] bride so Daniel was the Old Testament
[1:14:36] bride member hallelujah
[1:14:38] he said there's lots of churches about
[1:14:40] two million them down there that was the
[1:14:43] size of the overcomer was four and then
[1:14:47] overcomers was put to the test and every
[1:14:49] overcomer has to be put to the test and
[1:14:52] when they said you take back what the
[1:14:54] word says or either be thrown the fire
[1:14:55] furnace they refuse anything but the
[1:14:58] word amen that's what you and I say in
[1:15:00] the same way we refuse any doctrine
[1:15:03] unless it's the Word of God hallelujah
[1:15:08] and when Daniel was given a test that he
[1:15:12] should take back what the word says that
[1:15:14] they should lean towards the temple a
[1:15:16] Solomon prayed and he would deliver them
[1:15:19] from all things God would hear from
[1:15:21] heaven if they look towards the temple
[1:15:23] and pray and said if any man prays
[1:15:25] within these amount of days and we Meads
[1:15:28] of Persians who cannot change or alter
[1:15:30] our laws that that man will be throwed
[1:15:32] in the lion's den no see I just want to
[1:15:36] bring this out again Daniel got the
[1:15:38] victory by praying it would have been a
[1:15:41] sin for him to not pray and see that's
[1:15:44] why some of us are over surprised you
[1:15:47] may be on Sunday but man says some
[1:15:49] people have the ministry to be a prayer
[1:15:50] warrior that's their ministry so if
[1:15:53] they're not praying to them at sin just
[1:15:56] like for me as a preacher if I didn't
[1:15:57] preach it'd be a sin for me not to but
[1:15:59] that's what Paul said woe unto me if I
[1:16:01] don't preach the gospel so what what
[1:16:04] about everybody else with their gifts
[1:16:06] woe to them if they don't invest in
[1:16:08] their gift of knowledge right woe to
[1:16:12] them if they don't invest in their
[1:16:14] prayer lives see we got to do our
[1:16:18] ministry that's how we overcome through
[1:16:20] the gifts and ministries that God's
[1:16:21] given to us and see the trials of life
[1:16:24] will push us to be devoted to those
[1:16:26] ministries amen well the choice like
[1:16:29] Daniel Daniel had a choice well I'm
[1:16:32] either gonna be thrown the line spit or
[1:16:35] me faithful to my prayer life I'm gonna
[1:16:37] be there were gonna be I'm not either
[1:16:39] gonna be killed or you know I could have
[1:16:41] an easy life or I'm gonna be killed and
[1:16:43] say with the word and so he chose to
[1:16:45] stay with the word
[1:16:47] that's right he said they set a trap
[1:16:51] form he said I believe the Prophet knew
[1:16:54] that Daniel knew is a trap right just
[1:16:57] like us we should expect the test we
[1:17:01] should expect so I shouldn't expect
[1:17:03] tomorrow someone's gonna try to trap me
[1:17:04] in something right say he's gonna try to
[1:17:08] catch me when I'm not aware of it he's
[1:17:10] gonna try to send someone to say evil
[1:17:13] about me or an in morally dressed woman
[1:17:15] or some deal to make extra money I
[1:17:17] should expect him tomorrow but I should
[1:17:21] be prayed up so I can be an overcomer
[1:17:24] amen that's right they set a trap for
[1:17:28] him he walked humbly when it came time
[1:17:33] for him to pray he known at the home
[1:17:35] place in Jerusalem there was a burning
[1:17:36] sacrifice on the altar Daniel wasn't
[1:17:39] afraid of them spies he raised up the
[1:17:41] shades threw back the shutters knelt
[1:17:44] down on his knees throwing up his hands
[1:17:46] of God and prayed why live or die
[1:17:49] he had the victory yeah praise God he
[1:17:54] knew sister Beatrice that they were
[1:17:55] going to watch and pray but he said
[1:17:57] watching if you don't like this watch
[1:17:59] this anyway I'm gonna pray anyway he
[1:18:01] expected the test and then he stood
[1:18:04] right in the midst of the tests and I'm
[1:18:05] gonna be faithful
[1:18:06] I'm gonna keep my post of duty I'm gonna
[1:18:09] invest in my talents and my gifts I'm
[1:18:11] gonna invest in them and watch god I'll
[1:18:12] be an overcomer amen glory now he says
[1:18:19] these last few statements but let me I
[1:18:21] want to say a few things here
[1:18:27] here's last
[1:18:29] about Daniel and Shadrach Meshach
[1:18:30] Meshach and Abednego you might remember
[1:18:32] this

[1:19:16] very hard thing to burn out or eat up or
[1:19:19] anything so they had it amen
[1:19:22] glory a church we should have so much

[1:19:29] chasing us can't do anything about it
[1:19:31] amen because there's so much victory
[1:19:35] that the fire couldn't touch them the
[1:19:37] line couldn't touch him and search we
[1:19:39] know we have the victory when the
[1:19:41] temptations do not cause us to fall
[1:19:44] praise God that's when we know we got
[1:19:47] the victory when the temptations come
[1:19:49] and they can't grab a hold of us amen
