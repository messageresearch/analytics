preached the word yet I'm looking forward to the word today amen God bless you let's take our Bibles here that's what I like I like the freedom of the Holy Romans chapter 8:31 I'd like to look at part 20 of the book of Romans um I just shared that testimony on Wednesday you know brother Brian was so blessed to be here and he said you just have such a sweet people I get that from every preacher you know I just so I think it's true by God's grace if every preacher tells me that I think I think that's right and he just said uh you know on that on the evening service he said brother amen only sang three songs and the church was in he said in such one Accord he said I walked out there and it was one of the most powerful anointings I felt in a long time to preach the word of God and he said that proved to me brother Jesse he said it doesn't matter the number of songs it matters the quality of the worship just a nice reminder that God and and he said brother amen is so sincere he said he said the church was singing he said all the girls singing he said it was so sincere and that's what we want sincere worship yes amen there's times we're fighting battles we might have to just press through and we feel like we're pretending but we're really just pressing through our doubts and our battles and then that's sincere that's sincere if you're trying to press through that's sincerity praise God hallelujah so God bless you I just you know I love hearing testimonies like that and it was hard to miss my fifth service in eight or 17 years but I just had to do it I didn't want to spread germs here by God's grace but I'm back we're glad to be back in the house of the Lord with all of you and good to see all the saints today uh Romans chapter 8 verse 31 we left off on verse 30 a couple weeks ago by the grace of the Lord and uh we'll look to the word of God here today today Romans 8:31 what is heaven going to be like church if we can have this much joy on this side what's Heaven going to be like amen hallelujah I want to be in the spot where I don't run out energy I don't my my voice doesn't I don't lose my voice after five minutes of screaming you know just i' like to have my voice last a lot longer and there it will by God's grace there'll be no end to the Joy no end to the praise the Lord we're looking forward to such a time as that praise God Romans 8:31 this is finish it we'll try to finish Lord willing chapter 8 here today by the grace of God and such a beautiful chapter some people have called this may be their favorite chapter in the Bible Romans chapter 8 and I could see why I could totally understand that because the truths that are presented in this chapter Romans 8:31 let's just read verse 31 we can read it together with our voices then we'll have one more word of prayer as uh before we're seated let's read it on three one two three what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us praise God let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it know to God you know we saw the three unspoken needs I'm sure each one of us have a need on our hearts let's ask God to minister we're filled with joy we're filled with the worship of God and let's receive God's word today Hallelujah surely this uh service was ordained before the foundation of the world father God we thank you for your mercy and love every day is ordained Lord God but we can recognize Lord when uh Lord your spirit's wanting to move Lord God and we want you to move through US Lord God so just get us out of your way may the Holy Ghost have his way today Hallelujah that's all we want Lord is for you to be pleased with us you to be pleased with our worship Lord God hallelujah as as a as a husband is pleased with with his wife we as the bride we want you to be pleased with us dear God so Lord just let your spirit flow through us today speak through me hear through them Lord and I also need to hear Lord just minister to every need today those that'll hear it live Lord those on the archive like maybe my brother Lord or someone like that I pray you speak to them in the name of Jesus Christ we'll give you all the glory today in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God okay so I do have a few quotes and slides here maybe we'll share by the grace of the Lord hallelujah you know I just love that I love the liberty of the Holy Spirit don't you amen I love it and I just I just want to be sensitive to it you know I just want to sense are the people wanting to worship more or I'm always trying to like ask myself that brother amen you know how it is should we worship some more do they want to do more how much en energy do we have today Hallelujah and uh so I sure enjoy that I love worshiping the Lord hallelujah and I don't know if that it's okay if I don't hook up but you know it's no problem so we want to continue this uh series on here on Romans uh by God's grace it's been a real blessing to me and here we get into uh you know the beginning here of Paul's seven questions we know seven is the number of completion praise God and so uh you know Paul's finishing this chapter here uh in such a awesome manner I'd say a Divine manner Hallelujah now remember uh the book of Romans Scofield broke it up into these parts I don't want to have to move back on the slides I'm just going to read it right out of my Scofield bible uh the first part is the whole world after the introduction is the whole world is guilty before God all have fallen short of the glory of God hallelujah there's none not worthy no not one praise God none of us are worthy but he's going to give us white robes praise God we're not worthy but he's going to give us a crown hallelujah amen hallelujah what what love such love that God would love a sinner such as I amen how wonderful is love like this we should start breaking into another song Maybe Hallelujah such love of God and then the next part is uh I'm sorry it's justification through faith it's the righteousness of Christ and the resurrection of Christ I'm sorry yeah the righteousness of of God by faith and the gospel is the remedy for all of our guilt amen the good news is that Jesus Christ the righteous died for the unrighteous thank you Jesus and then he rose and the Bible says the proof God forgives you is the resurrection amen how many believe he resurrected 2,000 years ago that's the proof that he's accepted you amen the only way God can accept you is he if he accepts your sacrifice and if God Rose Jesus from the dead then God accepted his sacrifice that means we the worshipper have all the benefits of the sacrifice we are Justified amen we are forgiven hallelujah amen it's already been proven to the whole world God already proved he loved us through the cross and then God already proved he forgive us through the resurrection hallelujah amen what a powerful truth Paul gives us here in the book of r Romans M no doubt this could settle all the questions between the Jews and the Gentiles doesn't the doesn't the Bible solve all your problems between you and your disagreement maybe you're disagreeing with your friends yes or church members or or family members the gospel uh takes away all the guilt the gospel answers all the questions the gospel solves all the problems Hallelujah and brings such a Unity to the people where they can realize we are the people of God we are the family of God I don't want any uh hindrances between my family members yes like in your house you don't want any divisions you don't want any uh walls of Separation you want a house of peace and that's what the family of God is a house of love a house of Peace a house of forgiveness Hallelujah a house of longsuffering Hallelujah there's joy in the house of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah amen that's what the gospel does Amen takes away all the guilt all the shame Hallelujah cuz we're allil guilty before God and we that means we're all worthy of death but God has forgiven us hallelujah thank you Jesus and made us all the same we're all forgiven by the blood of Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah the third part after the remedy for Guilt is the crucifixion of Christ in uh Romans 5 and then the resurrection of Christ re Romans 6 and then the walk in the spirit which is chapter 7 and now chapter 8 you know the end of chapter 8 Lord willing next time we look at the book of Romans uh begins the next series or I'm sorry here the next section it would be the uh full result in the blessing of the Gospel here there in chapter nine by God's grace and also then how the gospel does not abolish the Covenant promises to Israel so I love this Paul solves all the questions in the church with Jew and Gentile and then he takes special time after that to deal with Israel because there's so many questions about Israel yes you know Jesus had said those words you know my blood's on you and your F your children you know so there's a lot there no doubt was a lot of questions Paul said you know because uh because you blashe I go to the Gentiles well does that mean all the Jews well of course not hose Jose and I had a good conversation about that yesterday you know God's always gonna there's always going to be some Jews that can see Christ because the bride according to Revelation 79 has to be from All Nations all kindreds all tongues hallelujah amen it has to be a member uh uh from every nation a bride member from every nation that includes Israel but it'll be a small group praise God but Paul has to deal with that and but first before he can deal with Israel he has to finish this off I'll say like this he's got to put an exclamation mark at the end of that time Hallelujah that's what chapter eight is amen this exclamation mark that there's no condemnation to us amen if you got the Holy Ghost you are an adopted son of God Amen you're an adopted daughter of God I means you have authority you have a family relationship with God hallelujah and then God gives you Witnesses is that you are a child of God Amen and then you know all things work together for good because you love God hallelujah amen and then we Rejoice I couldn't love God unless he loved me first amen now and then you know last time we looked at and now we get Paul gives us understanding after that now he's predestinated every event of our lives so we would be conformed to be like Christ amen we don't have to wonder you know why did I struggle for so long why was I away there you why did I live over there why did I live here we don't have to struggle anymore because we know God was doing that so we could be formed to be like Christ amen thank Hallelujah and so we have that con that consolation that he's conforming us to the image of Christ because he fornew us remember then he elected us and then he called us and then we recognize it amen and then he justified us thank you Jes and Friends as brother man said he's already glorified you amen he's already got a glorified body waiting for you in the heavens hallelujah it's already finished praise God we just now come to recognize all that he has done thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah praise God now we'll get to my text here that's my introduction Hallelujah Romans 8:31 now the Bible says what shall we say to these things these things about adoption these things about uh the Holy Spirit if we have the Holy Spirit he'll Quicken our mortal bodies that's in this chapter too this is a treasure Trope I use that phrase a lot but this is a treasure Trove of Bible truth amen remember brother R said he turned to Romans 4 every time he got depressed how about you and I turn to Romans 8 every time we get depressed Hallelujah the first verse you'll be encouraged I don't have any condemnation Hallelujah there's no damnatory sentence Jesus will look at me and say I knew you remember all the other church members that that disobey the word he'll say I never knew you but he to you and I he'll say I knew you praise godes why do he know you because you talked to him Hallelujah am you heard his word you listen to the preaching you believe the preaching you worshiped him hallelujah amen you a worker of zealous good works the Bible says amen hallelujah not a worker of iniquity you're a worker of the works of God zealous unto the good works as Titus said hallelujah amen so what do we say to these things now Paul gives us seven questions again so this is a complete questioning here of anyone who doubts God's love that's what this service is just going to be about today we should never doubt God's love amen now we will but we should start maturing and I believe we are by God's grace we should keep maturing and remembering how much God loves us amen and Paul is going to bring us through and show us all these proofs that God loves loves us hallelujah amen makes me want to sing your love never fails never gives up on me so I'm warming you up guys for the after service dance party Hallelujah Your Love Never Fails it never runs out never gives up on me praise God when was the last time God gave up on you he never gave up on you and he never will give up on you amen thank you Lord he won't he didn't give up on Moses right he didn't give up on on Jonah he didn't give up on job he didn't give up on he can't give up it's not in his nature amen thank you Lord he can't quit cuz he's not a quitter hallelujah amen thankes he's with you even in you Jesus said to the end of this church age amen amen no matter how long this church age goes on he'll be with you even in you praise God proving you his love to you hallelujah amen what do we say to all these things we've heard in this chapter if God be for us who can be against us he's for me because he won't condemn me Hallelujah he he won't condemn me he's for me now he's not for all of your fleshly desires now let's clarify that for a moment right he he doesn't give us everything we you want but he's for us in the path for our Salvation he's for us in our desire to do his will amen amen and be conformed to the image of Christ amen hallelujah just like he wasn't for he wasn't for balam trying to curse Israel it wasn't for that right but he was trying to help bam he even sent a donkey he even put his Spirit to speak through a donkey to try to warn this fell and that's how merciful god is amen remember it's numerous times in this narrow road look at that man I never saw before God was trying to get God got him on the narrow road but what did baam do he chose the broad Road when God brought him down to the narrow road listen to me obey the word obey the word he still disobeyed aren't you glad that Jesus set you free Hallelujah aren't you glad when you got on the narrow road and you stayed on the narrow road you were able to accept correction and follow the leading of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen amen when bam came face to face with it he still pushed past it like brother man said your conscious is like a stoplight brother Ram tells us in the greatest battle ever fought and he said if you run through so many of those stop lights it'll be like balum it'll be like Judas right you're going to get in an accident but thank God Hallelujah I said thank God that we let God take over the steering wheel Hallelujah in other words when we might not stop God takes over and God stops our lives for us hallelujah amen he'll keep us from falling amen as David said he'll keep me from the great transgression Hallelujah than you amen because you've surrendered your whole life you sing that I surrender all All to Jesus I Surrender Hallelujah I surrender all amen you surrendered your will you surrendered your life to him hallelujah amen I wasn't I just want to say wasn't that encouraging on Wednesday night we had a Pentecostal brother sto in here and he said I just want to come by and encourage you he wrote me these long emails telling me how much he enjoyed our services Saints you know we don't know we get Maybe 20 or 30 views but yet it's going to the elect you know to all those that really want to know the truth it's going to them now don't get me wrong there's many other message churches that are doing that but just be encouraged you know God is using our worship praise God like I told you that blind man he's now learning how to clap his hands and praise God he's single and he he's trying he lives in uh I think Oregon if I'm not mistaken and he's learning you know through watching our videos and and and our sermons he's learning he said I want to praise God and he'll send me a message in the morning he said I want to try to sing this this real loud I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free and I just hear him sing that and then it makes me want to sing it back to him like he's sing up me we've stirred up him now he's stirring up me let's keep stirring people up praise God hallelujah and I know this when you need stirred up God will stir you up too hallelujah amen just don't know you know I just was so blessed by that you know that God would send somebody in here to just show us and encourage us that we're doing a work for the Lord hallelujah it was really special by God's grace what shall we say to these things all these promises about adoption no condemnation if we have the Holy Spirit he'll raise us up from the dead if we die hallelujah amen what should we say to these things if God before us who can be against us I like this what we should say is we should ask a question Hallelujah I like that what should we say Paul says you should ask yourself this question if God is for me who can be against me amen hallelujah that's what you should say I have all these promises who can be against me in other words I'm an overcomer I'm an adopted son and daughter of God God has called me the devil will not con conquer me I will overcome the Gates of Hell hallelujah amen that's what he's saying who can be against me yes the Gates of Hell will come against me and church don't get me wrong Sometimes they come like a roaring lion but the B but God says brother man says God God God told us he's like a roaring lion he's not a lion and brother BR jokes and says he's a lion with no teeth so he might have a strong strong grab but he's not going to tear you up oh come on church amen your enemy might gum you a little bit but you got the sword of the spirit amen take out that sword and drive it home brother bar said take that sword out and drive it into the heart of your enemy Lord he said it just takes a strong hand of Faith Hallelujah in other words Satan get behind me Hallelujah right be like David and cut out the Giant's head Hallelujah that's amen yeah he'll leave but he'll come back another season but enjoy the season enjoy the victory CU you're more than a conquer in Christ Jesus Hallelujah ah Glory if God is for me who can be against me see this gives us the Victor's mentality this gives us the over Comer mentality I tell I tell you church this is what we need especially when we go through trials it's easy to say this when we're on the Mountaintop but this is what we need Even in our trials yes we need to remember that if God is for me even though I'm suffering then this suffering will not last yes amen this suffering will not overcome me God allow this suffering amen God allow this trial and I'll overcome this trial by his grace hallelujah amen now I want to move I want to come back to this but let me go down here did you ever hear about this when when uh there was a famous uh philosopher named Socrates I've never heard of Socrates in school I didn't read up too much on him but I just looked at this here you know uh what in college I had some a few really good professors I remember one of Dr Thompson called me out because I was talking too much one time he said Mr Smith stop talking sorry yeah my buddy was from the church and we were just joking too much and that really that really rebuked me because he called me out in front of everybody but that proved he loved me if you love me rebuke me right but I had this one instructor named Dr Broadway and when I had other uh friends that went to acan they had him too and he would just walk in the class he just sit on the table wait till we all got quiet and then he would just start asking us questions he never lectured us he just asked us questions the entire higher class period I'm like this guy's different usually the the teachers up there they just lecture okay this was in 1742 and this was 1927 remember that not this guy this guy was different and everybody in the education College knew him because he was the questioner questioner on the sea children no he was a good questioner but what but he had this method what method was it I I say like this this is God's method Socrates didn't invent this church that's right if there's anything good in education it didn't come from man it come from God that's right there's anything good in science it didn't come from Einstein it come from God hallelujah Einstein's dead and gone now and now they're learning more things they come from God it's what God allowed us to see but this was such a different class and I'll tell you church I was on my toes because I'm a shy person I was a shy person I didn't like to answer questions now now I'm comfortable I've been preaching for 20 years now now I can answer some questions that the children ask me and they're really good questions sometimes I'm stumped at least I can say I don't know but I'll tell you when I was growing up I was real insecure my dad left me and I I didn't ever want to ask a question I was just like don't call me don't I I look at anything else don't don't look at me chew my nails like I got tie my shoe I didn't want anybody to call on me right because I was afraid of questions I would stutter sometimes I still do stutter you know that's okay but you know I thought where did this come from this actually came from God and I just thought why would Paul end the chapter with questions well here's why so this method of question asking is a thought-provoking dialogue between an instructor and their students so when when the the instructor asks questions he's trying to have a dialogue a conversation he don't just want to hear a yes or no or a b c d you know uh 1942 God don't want to hear that God wants you to have a conversation with him yes how do you baptize uh Lord Jesus Christ acts 238 thank you God okay you may you may sit down now there's times you might need that right that's the gift of knowledge you might need the scripture reference like uh Phillip had Hallelujah on Wednesday night but you know this and that's what it was when Dr Broadway would sit down we'd have a conversation I'll tell you that hour and a half went by pretty fast because I was on my toes like okay I better do my reading next time too I better do my homework I shouldn't skip at this time I didn't like to read those books you know I was like I got the I I was just saved how could I want to read those books when I just got my Bible I'm like I'm highlighting I mean every little break I just go back to my Bible listen to brother BR put on my a Walkman any anybody know what a Walkman is no you don't know children you don't know but it was it was a dialogue it was a conversation when you ask questions it's a conversation not they got to be good questions not just yes or no questions it's based upon the approach used by Socrates who's known he's it's engaging young minds in conversations designed to help Define broad ideas and also expose the complexities and ambiguities between them so see it it helps you it helps you it helps engage with the the teacher and the students right and that's why God uses it it engages when God asks a question well we gotta we actually got to think what God said we can't move on well now I'll just go do whatever I want to do God's asking you a question he wants to know what do you think about it what are you going to say what's in your heart I want to hear your testimony right what have you learned what do you think about it he wants to have a conversation aren't you glad God wants to talk to you praise God that's what Paul's doing here what shall we say to these things what would you say if you're you're a son you're a Son of God brother amen sister Z you're an adopted daughter of God what will you say then to these things what do you say brother Jose what do you say what do you say to all these things you say well if God's for me who can be against me right Amen in other words it don't matter who comes against me as long as God's on my side amen amen hallelujah instead of giving information and facts instead of just lecturing you the instructor using the Socratic method teaches ask students a series of open-ended questions it's not just a yes or no oh do you love God have you been baptized okay are you filled with the Holy Ghost it's more than that what has the Holy Ghost baptism done for you brother now we're getting into something a little deeper here now Hallelujah that's a good question that's a good question you can ask me too not just for preachers it's everybody I love how Paul ends this chapter I'm giving you seven questions now you got something to to think about now we can Fellowship now we can talk amen now you can tell Daddy what what your thoughts are you can talk to your dad you can have a conversation with him I'm glad I got a dad I can talk to amen my natural dad not so much but if you do enjoy it but if not when I hear you got some good questions from your father Papa God Amen you saved me from my old life you forgave me hallelujah amen so and then in turn the students can questions of their own and I remember a couple times the teachers would or the students would go back and ask Dr Broadway and he just kind of give that smirk you think you can outsmart me and he returned their question with another question you know we would go through the class just trying to how can we get this guy uh so who the instructors that implement this they're they're facilitators they're guides amen didn't brother R preach the sermon the guide who's your guide who's guiding you through life Jesus Christ Hallelujah God's own son hallelujah amen he's your God yeah there's times God just lectures us he tells us this this this this is what the Bible said this but then there's times in the Bible he'll give you lots of questions and church the questions make us dig down deep I'm thankful for questions I've learned I'm not afraid of questions I mean but I know sometimes I have to labor over some more than others Hallelujah see uh the the instructor is not just the the provider of all the information it compels the students to consider why things are a certain way why is my life this way why did God uh sister beus why did God send you across the ocean to live in America when all your friends and family are in Ghana brother Jose why did God lead you from Nicaragua to come the United States Hallelujah he's had that conversation amen amen hallelujah he talked it over a few times right see it also allows you uh to consider why things reasons so reasons didn't God say Israel come and reason together with me that's what he's saying come and talk to me about your sins just come and talk to me tell me why you did it and then I'll forgive you if you repent and then I'll wash you white as snow Hallelujah that's what this is this is a conversation and many times God would speak through the prophet to have the to give the questions so that the church could ask the questions or they could answer the questions and then give different points of view on a topic well the prophet would have a certain point of view but then the lady might have a different point of view right so what's the benefits of this it uh encourages students to explore your thoughts and beliefs so see church sometimes there's questions in our lives like difficult seasons why did God allow this it actually shows you what's on the inside of you is that right helps you explore well what do what do I believe about God have I had do I have all the right ideas about God is my heart in the right place is what I'm saying see that's what questions do they make you go deeper you got to stop and Ponder and a lot of these questions you can't ask Siri the answer for that Mrs Google won't tell you the answer to that one right hey Google they won't tell you the answer because they don't know it there's not a yes or no answer it's a complex answer right it takes deep deeper thinking than that see the questions make you look inside of you glory amen hallelujah what's inside of my heart what do I believe what do I think that's why times when we go through life where there's a lot of questions those are important important seasons of life because it makes you reflect and ask yourself what do I believe about God and it will reveal what you actually it will reveal the real person like brother man says you uh you know you know Pentecost was the test Pentecost was the litmus test Judas didn't get there because he didn't pass the test it proved what he was the the trial of arrest and crucifixion that that was a test there was a lot of questions wait how is our Master uh getting arrested wait he's the Messiah wait die what and he saw as an opportunity oh I can make some money see so it it brought out the real Judas right what was in the thief heart he loved the money more than he loved the word but it brought out the real genuine Holy Ghost Christian and all the other ones hallelujah amen I love that Copus and his friend are walking on the road to meas on the Resurrection Sunday I thought he was supposed to do this I thought Jesus would do this they got all these questions Hallelujah I love it they're they're walking all these miles I foret it was maybe 15 miles to Emmas and then in their questions Jesus steps out and aren't these Beautiful Moments he didn't step out at the beginning he waited a while he let them go through a season of questions in their lives and the church said amen and then after this season this kind of Journey of what do you think why well there's that scripture what about this why are we doing why why are we scattered how come the church is scattered why are we living in fear and after all these questions here comes the answer Giver here comes the guide amen here comes the great shepherd He steps out he said I'm going to start preaching at Moses and I'm going to show you all the scriptures that pertain to the guide Hallelujah and I'm going to answer all your questions right down through this conversation ation and still they didn't know it was him until the until he I love this he acted like I'm going to leave you all right I got to go and brother Bram said it was a test to see if they wanted Jesus to stay and church that's how we can do every service there's going to be moments where we feel like uh uh the anointing is leaving and brother R said that's your time to cry out to God and say God don't leave us let this Holy Spirit remain here praise God hallelujah just stay with us we don't want you to leave us amen we want more of you hallelujah amen we can't even have church unless we got you Jesus amen it's a test Hallelujah so we see it we we want to be we want to pass the test so see that's what we got church we got a lot of assumptions see the questions make us dig deep down inside what are our what do we assume about God now just here's a good example with all these sick people we many times we just assume God's going to heal them now normally that's the case right God heals he promises all your diseases but then there's times where he chooses PE people to suffer like job or like Elisha where God takes Elisha home for sickness had an awful sickness but it that's what it does it makes us look at our assumptions and it makes us forget our ideas and makes us accept the ideas of God it makes us look higher than ourselves Hallelujah this method also helps Foster critical thinking enabling students to reach their own conclusions based on self-analysis of the information just versus just accepting what they're told how many churches they do they say just press play just press play and they sit there like right now you could do lots of different uh false false doctrines Joseph Smith is a prophet they tell the Mormon Church yes I know he's a prophet yes but there's no critical analysis what about his failed prophecies you know and that's why it's okay to have questions about brother br's Ministry he said prove me by the word and if you really look honestly you'll find the right answer he was a prophet of God hallelujah amen amen and God's not afraid of your questions Hallelujah he's the one that gave them can I say like that God allowed your questions and so God is going to give you the answers hallelujah amen God has allowed everyone to have their questions and so God just wants to see how long you'll wait and search your own heart for your assumptions how long will you wait and search out until God gives you the answer right amen all right now we're getting somewhere here by God's grace and still to this day that's probably my most memorable college class the questioner I looked it up a few years ago I couldn't find him I think he already retired but I sure like to talk to that guy again so the first question what do we say to all these truths number two if God be before for us who can be against us who can be against you now we've shouted a lot we rejoiced a lot but what's interesting and I I I have to but what's interesting is later on he's going to say we're just like sheep that are slaughtered all the day long but don't forget that that's part of the chapter too in other words you're a you're a sheep of God which wolf can be against you but yet I'm going to allow you to go through sufferings I'm GNA allow the Wolves to get pretty close to you sometimes Hallelujah wasn't Satan whispering in brother bram's ear I thought you said God's A Healer yet God took your wife and your Sharon Rose I thought he was a Healer I thought you said he was a good God he is questions Hallelujah but God has all the answers Satan the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen I got your answer amen God give me the answer so God is for you dear sheep but yet God allows you to go through suffering sometimes all the day long you wake up sick and you're sick all day how about that Mal or you're sick for two weeks or you're sick for months and it feels like I'm just dying and where am I ever how am I ever going to get the victory God's got answer for you nobody can be against you Hallelujah this won't destroy you you'll overcome this you'll be stronger on the other side of this hallelujah amen amen hallelujah if he spared not his own son if God let Jesus go through all the badgering of his life think about that brother Bram said he looked like he was 50 years old he was 30 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things wow if God delivered up Jesus then God will also give us all things Hallelujah so in other words if he's given you the no condemnation promise he's going to give you everything else that you need Hallelujah what's the most important question am I saved my lost if he's already solved that if he's already given you that he's going to give you every other answer for every other question in your life hallelujah amen all let's say all things can we all things he's going to free and freely freely you're not going to earn them right you're not gonna have to pay for them he's going to freely give them as a sheep right as you go through the trials of Life he's going to freely give you all things that pertain to Godliness the Bible says Peter says that amen hallelujah remember if he didn't spare up his own son the Bible says also other places we got to suffer in order to reign with him right so there's two qu there's three questions now won't he give you all things freely hallelujah it's free but sometimes you got to wait for it praise God hallelujah might be free but you got to wait for it Hallelujah verse 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth amen that's your fourth question who's going to put any charge on your heavenly account like you're guilty of something the Bible said God already Justified you he dropped the chares Jesus dropped the CH we might sing that next Hallelujah although I was wrong amen I need a washboard in here hallelujah and a thimble who's got my thimble hallelujah amen he dropped the charges amen there's no charges to God's elect so you have a clean slate in heaven uh Austin sins I don't I don't there's none I don't see any it's a really short piece of paper brother it just says zero or I'm sorry paid in full redeemed amen I'm sorry pardoned yeah it says pardoned amen they ain't there they ain't there they're not there Hallelujah I use some real English there I don't find any God's for me there's no charge against me in other words Satan is not allowed to write on your paper Austin prise the Lord Lydia Satan's not allowed to write on your paper oh I saw Lydia do this I saw brother Jesse do this God said nope St this is my list I bought this list amen hallelujah you can't touch what I bought this is my property amen I've already paid for this Hallelujah can't lay anything to this charge this is my list Hallelujah this is my child Hallelujah stay back Satan and you know he's got to get back Hallelujah that's a good fourth question who's going to put anything on your account in heaven nobody because God already Justified you thank you Jesus God already prepared a perfect uh charge there's no charges a perfect account Hallelujah paid in for Hallelujah the blood has paid the price Hallelujah you you you and I used to have these long now mine was really long I didn't have just one sheet I probably had about 10 sheets of sins but when Jesus died it was all nailed to the cross and it's like God took these Eternal scissors and cut off all the charges and they just fall right down to Hell hallelujah amen put those on Satan's charge Hallelujah cuz he tricked me into it amen Hallelujah and just fall right back to hell where they came from Hallelujah it wasn't me in the first place hallelujah amen because I'm a Child of God hallelujah amen he that's born of God cannot commit sin Hallelujah first John 3:9 devil hallelujah it's no longer I that sin Hal I'm sorry no longer I that live but Christ who lives Within Me hallelujah amen glory how many like those first four questions pretty good questions the Divine Socrates we'd say but Jesus is way better than Socrates Hallelujah where where did uh where did Paul get this where did Socrates get it they got it from God who is he that condemneth question number five who would condemn a forgiven child of God if God said you're pardoned who is going to who is going to dis agree with God who's going to say God you know what you're wrong God will just go and just get he said get behind me right that's right he just say go who who can condemn if God is the if God is the judge of the universe and he knows all the secrets of our hearts and he sees all things and knows all things has no beginning has no end who could condemn a child of God hallelujah who's going to condemn one of God's children just like today I just say in the natural if they let Biden's son get away with all these things huh because they're corrupted if a natural man will do that for a son and there's no charges what about God and God's a holy God hallelujah that because he he perfectly he he he satisfied the account he paid the price and so no man can condemn you and I there's no devil there's no angel nothing can condemn the children of God there's no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus amen why because Christ died for me yay rather that is risen again not only did he die he rose and not only did he rise he's at God's right hand Hallelujah who also makes intercession for us you imagine that sister Naomi God Jesus is up there saying father remember remember uh virtue remember virtue as she as she goes through her suffering I'm praying this for my daughter Naomi right that what the Bible say intercession for us father remember brother amen as when he went through his surgery right brother Jesse's praying the church is praying brother Jose's everybody's praying remember them Holy Father and minister to their needs and didn't God answer don't you think God's going to keep don't you think Jesus is going to keep making intercession for us yes amen I don't know how he has all this time to pray for all of us but he does he makes time amen cuz he's outside of time Hallelujah so who's going to condemn us when Jesus is there making intercession for us to God there's no one no one's going to condemn because he is he's in that holiest the Bible said oh Satan can't get in there church amen Jesus W let that Unholy one getting the holiest of all praise God yes there's nobody that can condemn us praise God the high priest won't condemn us the high priest is making intercession for us hallelujah amen he's remembering Lena's requests for her mom he's making intercession for that Jesus think of that sister L Jesus is there probably now Hallelujah and he goes before the father heavenly father right because he said I go to my God and your God remember your daughter Lena she has a request for her mother today we pray you'd heal her of this blood pressure he's making intercession for us so who's going to condemn you if Jesus is praying for you I said this there's nobody else there there's no other voices Hallelujah the Bible said there's a veil the Bible also says there's a our hope is anchored Beyond the Veil there's a veil in heaven only God and Jesus are in there Hallelujah no one's going to condemn us because the high priest is in there and he speaks for us he's fighting for us he's not against us he's for us hallelujah amen oh my talk about Grace question number six now who shall separate us from the love of Christ who's going to take you away from Christ Paul starts with seven seven options can any of these take anybody can any of these take you away from God's love and tribulation no the saints went through a lot of tribulation didn't they under uh Diocesan 10 years of bitter persecution now who's who's still going on is Diocesan Empire or is the church still going on forward amen hallelujah tribulation cannot separate us from the love of God hallelujah amen the church keeps marching on and the Bible says it plain the more the church gets P persecuted the more the church grows or spreads right we know we're having less and less Believers but it'll keep spreading the more persecution there are it'll cause real people to say that's real love that's God's love that's Divine love they'll die for Christ I'll die for Christ amen amen amen who's going to separate you from the love of Christ now think about this church isn't it just the devil's one of his favorite tricks God don't love you God doesn't love you if he loved you he would have kept you from that what if job would have said that what if Abraham would have said that oh God I wish you would have kept me from making this mistake with Hagar too late too late now you got a big Isa or Sor a good big ishma and but he's got promises too see God has a purpose for all your mistakes there's a purpose for all your mistakes amen right just trust God trust God just trust him he was here before you that's right and he'll be here after you that's right hallelujah amen he knows what he's doing church so tribulation make make the love of God depart from you no no no matter what tribulation go through it'll never make God's love leave you will will distress job said I went through months of distress I just read read it yesterday I was going through the Book of Job again these are the longest months my we've had some pretty awful months with sickness but nothing like Joe but we've been sick since November November December January thank God February came Hallelujah we've been through almost three awful months of sickness when is the stomach thing going to leave that's just a few months with the just natural stomach sickness not boils all over us with f funerals to attend as well of his own children right did distress separate job from God's love you ever see where God says well you know devil you're right I I don't know maybe job will curse curse me and I don't know if I love job is God's love ever in question for job never did God ever waver and say let me think about it uh I I don't know no in fact he said the same thing every time I like that brother have you considered my servant job that's right a man who's perfect he he excuses he runs from Evil have you considered him God don't change his tune about you that's right you're already Justified he already loves you you're already glorified right he don't change his tune it's the same so this the the distress of job could not make God forget about him God's love never let left him despite his wife wanting to curse God W him to curse God losing the children losing all his finances God's love never was separated from him hallelujah amen I think one proof of that is that job just wanted to talk to God about it amen because these are questions in his mind I just wanted the Bible said I wish uh the Bible said there's a I wish there was a a a mediate a mediator between God and man I forget the actual word it's different in the it's different in the King James a a daan I think it's a daan I wish there was a daan between God and he said there's no daan between man and God and then brother BR says no there was Eli who come around and he was a type of Christ hallelujah amen let me give you the word of God I'll intercede between you and God let me give you the word of God hallelujah God gave it to him persecution did the early church uh were they separated from God's love as their persecu when James was was slaughtered in prison and martyred did the did God's love ever leave James or Stephen no never left them in fact we see Jesus standing ready to receive Stephen come up to heaven my son see it doesn't it doesn't separate us from the love of God nothing the third one famine right think about uh Lazarus the beggar he's like I just want want the crumbs I just want the crumbs man that rich man can I just have the crumbs that fall from your table and he wouldn't even do that sometimes did that separate Lazarus from the love of God no because as soon as he died he went right to Abraham he went come here come here son yeah that's right father and son come here Father Abraham let me give you a big hug you mean he wasn't cursing God like why did I have to suffer that's why I told those Ugandan people the and the Kenyan people begging me for money I said I'm out right now I said when I get some more I'll let you know but they're begging me like brother Jesse we're going through famine I said I know my heart's breaking but what but shall famine separate you from the love of God we don't get to choose which one we go through right which one which one you how about do you want do you want the sword do you want the the gun do you want to face prison do you want to be locked in prison none of us would choose that but God needs an overcomer God needs somebody who says I love you no matter what and I'll never be separated from your love hallelujah amen amen none of us well I some of us were close to it you know none of us have probably been through a famine like a seven-year famine in Egypt right remember the dirt I love the dir agabus said thus sayith the Lord there's coming a dir and so the Saints got all their extra food ready and send it over there to the Saints in Jerusalem when they went through the famine God has a way to take care of his children praise God sometimes those blessings just come in the mail that's Hallelujah you didn't ask for it they just somehow come Hallelujah nakedness I which of us have had very little clothes I know Jose had very few growing up we were talking about that yesterday but even if you don't have many clothes even if you're po that poor it doesn't mean that God has taken his love from you it just means that's the that that's the situation the Sheep is going through but the great Shepherd is always there amen Hallelujah in the church asan book I love that quote I read a few months ago brother R said God might permit you to death or cancer or or something he said but it's God's prerogative It's God's purpose it's God's choice he said uh he said bright skies and and increase of goods is not always the sign of God's love right he said the proof of God's love is your election amen the fact he called you to be a Christian that's God's proof to you hallelujah amen hallelujah the proof God wouldn't let you stay in your drug addict and God wouldn't let me stay in my drug addict and my spce addict and my awful movie addict God wouldn't let me say in that that's his proof that he loves me Hallelujah glory amen and how about the sword I thought of this Peter took out the sword and I look just stand still he cut off his ear can you imagine a saint of God imagine that virtue virtues laughing there Peter's like I'll never deny you and then a few minutes later he's like I'm out of here and Jesus picks it up be healed malus right be healed malus be healed did that did that act of violence think about that Saints did that act of violence separate Peter from God's love did Peter just say okay now I'm officially done with you you were sinking out on the water you were telling me not to go to the cross and now the sword you've used the sword to cut off someone's ear I'm done with you Peter it's it's over no he still gave he gave the keys anyway he gave him the keys when he knew that was going to happen the church said God gave you the authority even before he before you made the mistakes Hallelujah and he said there to forgive you Hallelujah he's there to show you his love nothing can change God's love for you hallelujah amen sword won't do it now whether you're delivered to the sword like Paul and martyred the sword he knew the sword could not separate him from from the love of God yeah you mean this little metal sword that's eventually going to rust out you mean this is going to keep me from the love of Christ impossible soon as that sword goes through my neck I'll be with my Lord who loves me yes Hallelujah and died for me I think that's beautiful Peril all the distresses remember Paul said I've got troubles without I've got troubles within I he said I have troubles without I have all fears within a holy ghost filled man fill with the fear of all the the troubles and still that would not separate him from the love of God Amen so he l seven there and that was his seventh and final question the seventh question has seven elements to it is that something seven times seven that's the seventh and final question shall any of these separate you from God's love no the answer is no think about that none of those none of those separated any of the Believers from God's love why it's written so Paul gives us the answer for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter so here's the questions five six and seven and this just like a paradox you know you know brother says the church is an invincible Army she is what it means is her soul has been sealed it's sealed it's it's permanent right it's marked it's sealed like brother said signed sealed and delivered praise God hallelujah it's sealed unto the day of redemption amen you've got a permanent uh fixture you've got a permanent uh connection to God and it's it's sealed all the way through no matter what uh brother said no M no no no matter what mountains or valleys or Trails you go through you are sealed and you will reach your day of redemption hallelujah amen whatever path God let you go through the highs and lows of life you are already going to make it praise God Amen but there will be days you'll feel like you're getting slaughtered all day long mistreated just for being a Christian right some of these persecuted distressed oh how's this going to work out and you're you're going through it all day long that doesn't separate you from God's love it just means God's love is on the way Hallelujah church I know it's going long here but we had to get some good worship so I I don't try I'm not going to try to push it longer it needs to go I just want to finish this chapter actually this if I should this chapter says we're more than conquerors and who can be against us am yet we're she sheep that are got to go through slaughtering suffering so what does this do this magnifies the glory of God this magnifies the great Shepherd there's sheep all around I'm sorry there's wolves all around the Sheep sometimes but I'm still with you I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen I'll just say like this you know for our souls for our souls Satan's like a wolf and all is he gonna do is bark at us bark at us but he'll never touch our soul amen hallelujah I say like this he can chew on you he can cut on you chew on you but he'll never take your life I'm talking about your soul now Hallelujah you go through suffering you go through trials but he can never touch your life your soul oh thank God Amen thank God Hallelujah so first we got the first seven um oh yeah we get the first seven out of the 17 tests that we over overcome by God's love God go think your presence is heaven to me what a perfect song that's your love God's presence is God's love amen so God's love is with you in all 17 tests that Paul lists here now there could be more could be less I'm not sure but you list 17 there are seven of them tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or sword did any of you go through any of those this week maybe this maybe you were persecuted for being a Christian probably not not these probably not that and maybe that see God God God knew which ones you'd go through God allowed those certain wolves to come around just like he allowed them to come around job think about that God let Satan come right around job and his family God let him get so close but then God said stop that's what God does for us you can get so close to the amen but stop as far as you can go get get get this close to the Smith Smith family stop that's it that's enough amen hallelujah I'm in charge here hallelujah I've got the rot and staff Hallelujah I protect my sheep hallelujah amen I'm allowing it for a purpose there's a purpose behind all this praise God is to build the character of Christ in Christ sheep Hallelujah now before I get there you remember the Divine Socrates remember this job said I wish I could talk to God Where's God I'm a righteous man why am I going through this and it's true job thought he was more righteous than God see look how prideful people can get and remember we talked about the goat debate I told my wife about this I'm GNA have more Mercy on these goat debate people because what did job do job made himself more righteous than God talk about the goat debate I mean God's got to be the greatest of all time the church said now y'all thinking those good questions job said sister beus I'm more righteous than God I don't deserve this how did God answer anybody remember Job 38 the Lord descended out of a whirlwind you ever triy to catch your Whirlwind we had went out in our field last fall I almost ran out I thought is this God talking to me like brother brandom I was like maybe this is a spiritual moment I just watch see I'm like Lord are you gonna talk to me I think Z might have been out there but this was probably a mighty Whirlwind here J's like I want to talk to God I want to hear from God a li who's like you are going to hear from God you ain't going to like what you hear now in one way he didn't like it in another way he liked it right the flesh don't never like correction or doesn't never like correction but then the soul loves correction you remember church God comes down he he doesn't tell job anything about his trials he just said who is this he don't even call him a son he said who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge who is this who's making me look like I don't know what I'm talking about he didn't come down and say oh little baby job can I can I comfort you a little bit baby Hallelujah he says who is this that makes my word seem like it doesn't it's not true who's this that's speaking things things that are false sound like Socrates to you yeah the first Socrates and church he asked him 65 more questions and he never answered his question job's question was how can I uh how how can I suffer through this when I'm living a righteous life I feed the poor I help the Widow I'm true to my wife I don't look at any other Maids think about that Brothers I made a covenant I will not look at another woman think about that and he said I did it it's a righteous man I gave to the poor I fasted I receed people in and taught them everything he said where is God God said who is this now in heaven he's like you consider job devil this you consider my servant job I'm proud of this is my boy right here in fact there's nobody even like him on the earth so when God's up in heaven he's like this is the greatest man in the world he comes out and says who's this and job listen job's listen you don't know me right you don't know who I am I've served you all these years I've done all these good works uh job you got a little pride there shouldn't say little you got a lot of Pride he doesn't answer his questions he gives him more questions who are you to darken my counsel and you don't even know what you're talking about you don't have the knowledge where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth so that proves he wasn't one of those sons of God shouting for Joy that's speaking of angels because why would God ask him where were you if then he tells him you were right there those were Angels shouting those weren't human there's no pre-existence of souls butam tells us right tell me if you have understanding who set the measurements did you measure did you set the measure did you write the blueprints for the Earth since you know who stretched out the line upon it on what were its bases sunk I'm using a different Bible version just because it's a little bit easier for us to understand I don't I I disagree with all Bible versions you understand but I'm trying to put it in the language we'll understand it who laid the Cornerstone of the earth when all the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy who enclosed the sea with doors when bursting forth it went out from the womb did you know the the sea came out of a womb did you know that the sea had a anybody know that job didn't know that I didn't know that when I made a cloud it's garment the cloud was a garment for the sea the cloud was clothed for the sea did you know the cloud was a garment I didn't know that and the thick Darkness it's swaddling band a swaddling cloth so the the sea was like a little baby that had swaddling cloth on it that's how God looks at the sea Hallelujah I placed my boundaries on it and set a bolt in doors and I said thus far you shall come but no further and here shall your proud wav stop have you ever in your life commanded the morning see God calls the morning every and he says I give you mercies new mercies every morning amen that's the reason God sends a morning so you can have hope every morning hallelujah amen I command the morning job did you ever stop the morning from happening God could have said job are you ever said uh stand stand still to the sun and it stood still Joshua could say Amen now Joshua came later joshu said I could do that but by the spirit of Christ because I was such a faithful servant and I needed that to deliver the gibon nightes the Gentiles oh that's a that's a sermon right there Hallelujah I preached it before but that's a fresh thought Hallelujah the Gentiles son stand still but God asked job where were you did you command the morning did you know did you cause the dawn to know where to go its place that it might take hold of ends of the Earth and the wicked be shaken of it have you entered into the Springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep like remember that video I showed you about the ocean anybody ever been down to the bottom of the ocean God asked job now they weren't even getting close in job's day they weren't getting 10 meters not even close he said you ever been down to the bottom no no God I haven't oh oh okay so who are you to speak against me and yet in heaven he's like this is my boy no one's like this guy look at him I love the word of God don't you church it's good to revisit these I Prett this a few years ago but it had a fresh application to me because that's the same way Paul ends his chapter who is going to separate you from the love of God who right so we get good questions rather than questions of rebuke right God's rebuking job so we could learn the lesson and then we would really meditate on that's right nothing can separate me from God's love that's right nobody can condemn me because Jesus already paid my condemnation he already took my condemnation now for time sake I'm not going to go through this list of 66 but I could maybe someday I will he goes to the Behemoth right the brosaurus or the Brachiosaurus or gigantosaurus whichever one was the biggest one I don't know anymore they're find they always find new kinds of dinosaur bones and he says Can you capture him can you put barbs and Pierce his nose and just drag him around wherever you want no God I haven't done that yet okay all right can you draw out the Leviathan The Sea Dragon which they're used to they used to be alive I don't know if they're still alive today but there used to be a a sea dragon will he make many supplications to you or will he speak to you soft words the kids were at the zoo the other day will will a lion or bear or tiger speak soft words to you can you get him to whisper and can I have a hug will they make a covenant with you bye and then he ends with those last two animals the Behemoth and the leviathon and then the Lord leaves Lord leaves who remembers what job did once God left job 42 verse1 then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou C do everything so job must have forgot that God does everything right because he was like I I'm more I'm more righteous than God but now he realizes no God can can do everything I can't do very much I can help out the poor I can keep my mind right right I can visit I can visit the fatherless I can visit the children but I can't do everything and I know that thou cast do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not things to wonderful for me which I knew not I have heard of thee by the seeing of the ear but now mine eye seeth wherefore I have myself and repent in dust and Ashes so God's questions bring him to the realization I don't know everything but I can trust him who knows everything and I hate my flesh I hate the sinful desire the sinful nature that's in my flesh that makes me exalt myself I don't want to exalt myself so I Repent in dust and dust and Ashes and then God comes around to the three men and says you better have my Prophet pray for you that's the only way you're going to be forgiven and he does and God forgives them so he said who is he right to job and then later he says you're my servant amen hallelujah I like that amen God knows just how to Humble us and then God knows how to come around and remind us that we are his servants hallelujah amen hallelujah sometimes God makes it seem like he don't know us who is this to keep us humble but the whole time God knew job but he knows the words to speak to us when we need a a good humbling Hallelujah and God waited till job prayed for those three men in order for God to turn them from his wrath the Bible says that in verse 4210 God still had that much there's still much that that I'm sorry that's how much power there is in a believer's prayer that's why Church keep praying for your lost L lost loved ones God will remember your prayers Abraham and Sarah Hallelujah God remember your prayers because God would not forgive the three miserable counselors until job prayed for them Hallelujah no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us what you're more than a conquer through all your tribulations how many have ever uh conquered a tribulation in your entire lifetime I have how about distress anybody ever made it through distress oh you conquered that Hallelujah you mean God's word is true how many ever been persecuted because they're a Christian oh you conquered that oh Hallelujah anybody feeling strong longer now anybody ever been through famine nakedness Peril sword you are more than a conqueror youve conquered that but you're more than that amen you're more than a conqueror see because one day the Conquering will end and you got to be more than that you're the bride of Christ amen hallelujah when all the Conquering is done you're still something you're more than that you're married to the King of Kings you're a child of God you have eternal life hallelujah oh my oh my glory through what how are you more than a a conqueror through him that loved you see it's his love that makes you a conqueror his love allows you to be tested his love helps you conquer and then you're more than a conqueror you're more than that you're more than a soldier Brothers Hallelujah you're more than a soldier sisters you're more than that yeah yes you'll overcome Peril sword nakedness famine you'll overcome all that because you're more than that you're more than we'd say just a soldier in the army of the Lord and now look even Paul was persuaded that's what I want you to be church today I want you to be persuaded of God's love for you amen right I want you to be fully persuaded that nothing can separate you from the love of God Amen if job's trials didn't separate him from God's love right David's trials all the Believers trials if their trials couldn't take God's love away well then God's love won't leave you either because he says those wonderful words right there we not just Paul all of us we we are more than conquerors all these adopted Sons and Daughters he talked about previously in the chapter that all you were saying Amen to that's the we you're the we we hallelujah we're more than conquerors because he loved us I'm persuaded neither death now there's number eight life right no the trials of Life Angels no principalities Powers things present so anything right now anything in your life right now cannot separate you from God's love whatever you're going through now it doesn't take God's love away God still loves you let's remember that you might say brother Jesse I'm going through such a hard time I know but God's love is greater than what what's happening right now God's love will last longer than what's happening right now praise God nor things to come brother Jesse I'm fearful about the future yeah join the club hallelujah hallelujah but but his love will is greater than what's to come his love is greater Hallelujah his love is stronger amen our God is greater our God is stronger Hallelujah he's higher than anyone other nor height it's got to be speaking of natural and spiritual nor depth nor any other creature so see he names he names Angels Powers any any power and any other creature beyond that if there's any other creature beyond the Angels than the demons and Satan himself I love that anything else if there's any ever anything else out there the the 17th and final expression was anything else nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus amen God loves you no other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord where is God's love it's in Christ and where's Christ a portion of him is in you Hallelujah right I love this I heard a preacher say this so we made it through all 17 tests that we can go through and the Bible says God's love cannot be separated from you I love I love this chapter it says it starts with no condemnation and it ends with no separation I like that nobody can condemn me and nobody can take me away from Jesus Hallelujah I'm forever yours Hallelujah I belong to Jesus I am bought with a prize the precious blood of Jesus hallelujah amen he bought me I'm his he's mine oh I am my beloved and he is mine trur we believe that do you believe that when you sing that that's what the Bible said he's yours and nothing will be able to separate you from the love of God like brother said it makes me want to go go in the the corner and cry and just Rejoice over all that he's done for us just he says uh curl up in a corner and cry and rejoice God loves me that much Hallelujah of course he does now I'm gonna 17 was the number of the the the New Testament Church I'm not I'm gonna skip that I'm just going to go through a few brief quotes I'm not going to read all this but brother man quotes Ephesians 4:30 he talks about the Seal of the Holy Ghost it's a permanent Mark it's like a tattoo or a a brand on your soul he said how long does it last the next Revival until our Redemption the very day of redemption there's no way of getting away from aren't you glad that God put something on you that's him and you can't get away from it yes amen anybody got a good scar where's my latest scar I can't see it maybe if I got a scar here I had surgery I'll never get away from that scar never I'm always gonna have that Hallelujah my children asked me one time what is that Daddy that's your daddy playing foolish football but there's a purpose for it Hallelujah to get here here hallelujah I'll never get away from that so it is with the Seal of God you'll never get away from it Hallelujah he said you can't get away from it because it won't get away from you you can't get away from the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost won't leave you you can try to run all you want but it will not get away from you he's with you forever he sealed you Hallelujah he's with you for all eternity Hallelujah and then he quotes Romans 8 there's nothing future present perils hunger thirst nothing can separate us from the love of God Paul said I'm fully persuaded of that there you are there you are you're sealed until the day of your Redemption God will never get away from you he will not leave you he will not forsake you and I love this quote again I'm not gonna I'm going to put some of these up on YouTube this week the reason the reason you can't be separated from the love of God is because God's love is undying it's Eternal and he put an Undying Love in you well that's why it can never be separated it cannot die so brother I'm talking about being circumcised the soul you're getting the unbelief cut out he says the Holy Ghost is he said you have nothing to do with it it does it itself God does it itself he circumcises your soul and puts you in love with Jesus with an Undying Love there's nothing can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus he quotes Romans 8 he's called you he circumcised you you and him and predestinate your final destination if that ought to make Christians shout that's what you were shouting about before service I'm sorry before the preaching that's why you were shouting Hallelujah there's joy in the house of the Lord isn't it joy unspeakable full of Glory you can say Amen to that because you've already fulfilled it today I was already shouting you are already shouting it's God's love amen if that don't make you shout I don't know what will if that wouldn't wake up a man that's in Christ I don't know what would it take to wake him up he's twice dead he goes to the Judas see it what does it do it wakes us up when we learn about the love of God when the re when the questions of God are given to us and we rehearse God's love and we examine ourselves and we learn and remember the promises of God it makes us shout the victory hallelujah amen why he put the love of God in you that's what he shed in you that's what he poured into you the love of God the Bible says that's why I know I got the holy ghost that that morning after I got married because I never felt loved like that before brother brandom said Church Romans 8 takes the wind out of Satan's sails you ever feel like somebody's chasing you down like the devil's chasing you down when is he going to quit when is he going to give up why I got to keep looking over my shoulder brother Ram said just give him Romans 8 then pretty soon all that wind's going to leave him and you'll be sailing just you and Jesus Fellowship two fellows in one ship Hallelujah brother we can have some fellowship San's not going to try to hinder our fellowship right he said Romans 8 takes all the winds out of Satan say let's leave Satan deserted today can we yes let's make Satan stranded today let's believe nothing can separate us from God's love hallelujah amen we don't feel like I'm being chased down by the these lies and the guilt the greatest thing I can find against the church tonight is fear but remember now remember Church let's pause right here there's no condemnation to the church so this must mean in your own personal battles on Earth not in heaven God don't have nothing against the bride in heaven but he's teaching us he's training us on the earth is fear Everybody's scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again he should be happy Carefree just like these fellows singing up there and the brother testifying back there there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God God has promised he's called by election he sets the church in order no man can come to me except my God the Father draws him you never come to God because you wanted to so now we're getting into the we're going that's actually the next chapter God the so in one way we choose God but another way the Bible said God made you a vessel I just use this one again God this is a special vessel right it's a glass vessel it's not this isn't one of these paper cups children right you get those paper cups we just toss them in the trash right would you toss this in the trash no it's a special vessel let's use it it's made for a special purpose it's made to last a long time see there's some vessels and virt had a good question about that there's some vessels they're just made to be used and thrown away but some vessels have a a longer lasting quality to them God's got a special purpose for you sister beatric hallelujah sister Kristen God has a special purpose for you Don I hardly ever use my wife you know she's out usually out with the kids see God made sister Christen a special vessel to hold the oil the Holy Spirit Hallelujah you come because Christ called called you God called you and he that comes to me in no wise will I cast out I'll never cast you out I'll give him everlasting life oh my if that doesn't take the winds out of Satan's sails I don't know what does if Romans 8 don't make you feel like you're sailing on life solom man and just rejoicing and with joy he said I don't I don't know what will this is the chapter that takes all the guilt away makes you ask all the right questions and helps you find all the right answers hallelujah amen hallelujah takes all the winds out of Satan's sails no longer feel like you're afraid no longer feel like the enemy's after you how do you know brother Ram because Jesus said so and Jesus is thus sayeth the Lord Brother said oh don't you love him today Jesus has the key to your joy we just saying joy in the house of the Lord right and then we say joy unspeakable Jesus give us the key we can have joy in church amen and church I'm not saying we have to dance after church I'm just saying I love how God does spontaneous things I'm just saying the reason you could dance or Rejoice today is because God gave you the key for it amen right thank God he's the key to your happiness he has the key of your deliverance from the grave I have the keys of death and hell he said why don't you come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins and when you come back up from that Fountain brother you won't have to take a rabbi a priest or even brother Jesse's word in your heart there's something that's mellowed you to a fellowship ship ship Satan sails no long his ship is no longer chasing you because you're relaxed now there's something that's made all old things pass away and things then become new there's something that loves you there loves you there oh Glory something in that ship that really loves you there Jesus is in your ship Hallelujah wake him up church amen stir him up Christ is in your ship Hallelujah there's something in your heart Paul said there's nothing present nothing future neither sickness Peril nothing can separate you from the love of God no back bitings no ups and downs nothing else nothing can ever separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus sickness sorrow hunger strive differences in the church right differences of opinion no matter matter what it is nothing can ever separate you from the love of God I know you're getting tired I'm almost done I think this might be the last one yep that's the last one you can say thank the Lord hallelujah brother says when I look at Jesus saving me from hell and eternal Eternal judgment the Bible says not Eternal suffering Eternal judgment how can I not love him when I look at the cross how can I not love him back how can I not know that the I'll never be separated from the love of God in Christ Jesus I'm not going to read all this here he talks about brother says when I go overseas he said my wife and I we sit down and pray together may God bless you here in Jeffersonville may God bless me on my trip like you heard brother say that we don't look at each other and say well if you look you know M if you look at any other man in the eyes you'll be a divorced woman when you get back and she said let me tell you my good man if you have any other looking at any other girls you'll be a divorced husband when you come back he said wouldn't that be a happy home that's what he tells in the story he said goodbye sweetheart pray for me he said even though I might be tempted he said she never has to worry that I'll love somebody else I love her too much to cheat on in other words there's something in my heart that wouldn't let me do it and so he uses the natural how could I ever cheat on my wife I love her so much when I look at at my Lord and see he died Yonder on Calvary the lovely for me the unlovely he the pure now pure lovely me impure unlovely see that we have to see the contrast who's the lovely one here who's the pure one here Christ There's No One Like Jesus Children I like when Lily points up there she goes there's no one there's no one she's laughing There's No One Like Jesus how do I know God loves me because of the cross the resurrection when I look at him and he saved me from the death of sin and The Eternity in hell now look here's a good quote I need to take this to uh Jeffersonville is this thus sayith the Lord I thought there was no eternal hell everybody catch that ever everybody got your discernment on there's something in me if I could get by with it I don't want to do it look at that if I knew I could do a sin and get by with it I still wouldn't want to do it because I love him yes sir I love him even I even I thought if I'd go do it he'd forgive me for it I don't want to do it anyhow I don't want to do nothing to hurt him I love him too much that's what we have to have it's something in your heart love they say oh don't con condemn me to smoke it don't condemn me to drink brother br said the first Bible ever got when I started preaching they'd say brother Braham you think it's wrong to smoke you think it's wrong to drink he said I wrote an ant little answer my Bible so after church I'm going to start looking through your Bibles that you leave there what do they write when they go through trials what do you write down in your Bible I wrote a little answer in my Bible to these questions don't ask me foolish questions make this up in your mind if you love the Lord with all your heart you won't smoke chew or drink any shine sometimes brother was a poem wasn't he wrote remember he wrote about the wild west that was a beautiful poem remember that brother Jose that still holds good tonight if you love him though you could do it and get by with it you wouldn't do it anyhow if you love him that's the real true genuine agapo love does the Christian loves the Lord and he loves him in such a way that there's nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Paul said neither death sorrow perils imprisonments anything can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus and brother when you get that in your heart with that type of Love that'll be anything else that you could ever substitute for let's stand to our feet musicians can come here you know I think it's very fitting we had a nice time of worship and God wanted me to preach on the love of God hallelujah let's bow our heads for a word of prayer I don't know if there would be but there if there would be anyone that would say brother Jesse remembering me in prayer that I'll remember how much God loves me you could raise your hand and God would see the raising of your hand or if there would be anyone that say brother Jesse pray for me I'm going through perils right now I'm going through persecution and I need to remember the love of Christ you can acknowledge that by the raising of your hand of course anyone's welcome to come up for prayer as we uh let's be close here you know brother Bram calls us the climax of the service now that you've heard the word what are you going to do about it will you accept it how many will accept it in your heart let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your love Lord as I've said this before now it just comes to my mind your Prophet brother Ram said the church age book God's love is not in question it's our love that's in question God proved his love to us when he sent his son the righteous for the unrighteous the pure for the unpure the lovely for the unlovely and died for us and then raise him for our justification Lord who shall lay any charge to God's elect it is God that justifi the church today Lord you saw the hands Lord if anyone's going through perils distress persecution Lord let your love overshadow them here today Lord God stir up the love of God in their hearts dear God I pray today as your Prophet said I love Jesus because he died for me the unlovable he kept me from Hell Jesus died and went to hell to get the keys so I didn't have to go to hell thank God thank god oh the Simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ thank you Lord God for saving a Wretch like Me thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ nothing can separate us dear God from your love Lord just remind the church if someone needs that today remind them nothing can push them away from the love of Christ in other words they'll forever be United
