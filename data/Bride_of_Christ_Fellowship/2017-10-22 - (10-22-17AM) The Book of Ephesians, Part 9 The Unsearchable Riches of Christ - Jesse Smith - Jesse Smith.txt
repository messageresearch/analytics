or God inspire us more by your Holy Spirit we thank you for this gathering and Lord may your day be magnified or we asked this Jesus Christ a church said you noticed a car bob is here this morning without trees let's go to Ephesians chapter 3 verse 8 so just three that one scripture as a text fusions 3 verse 8 I want to preach on part 9 of the book Ephesians I'll just want to have a subtopic the unsearchable riches of Christ I want to preach on that visions 3:8 by God's grace as you're turning there just want to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ god bless everybody I don't know if you saw the email but I send an email this week and one thing I just put in there was just pray for guests ministering I've invited brother Darrell Ward brother Joe Adams Jim schumake and brother Ben deraad I've invited all those and now we're just kind of waiting on the timing of these things so I'm not sure when they'll come but they have an invitation for me I would really like them to come I feel that a lord to invite them so just keep those in prayer if you would by the grace of the Lord and we have brother cam Smith my brother coming in two weeks he'll be preaching for us on November 5th by the grace of the Lord and thank you for your prayers praise God visions 3 verse 8 now we'll be building to this point this is where I want to get to verse 8 so we'll be building to this point in Ephesians here Wednesday night we spent a lot of time on access to God hopefully got a chance to listen to that that really was a blessing and we we actually used those scriptures this morning in prayer so very thankful for that seasons 3:8 that's all I'm sorry yes visions 3:8 I'm in chapter 2 that's my problem okay let's read Ephesians 3:8 let's begin on three one two three unto me Who am less than the least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ may God as blessings the ring of his word you may be seated I don't know you can switch over buddy brother bang told me it might be a different setting but try the first one and off the look on the text let's look at this stock here I like to look at the unsearchable riches of Christ but I want to as I was preparing yesterday I just thought we would build to that I changed my text to I thought as I studied this morning I felt kind of led to go to that unsearchable riches of Christ I did change my text a little bit so remember we'll just briefly just review just a minute there's three themes and Ephesians as you study it it's the believers exalted position in Christ in chapter 1 all the way to chapter 2 verse 10 where it says you're saved by grace through faith and you are God's workmanship Amen I'm glad to be a part of God's workmanship amen and then the second theme is the one body of Christ both Jew and Gentile that's what we're on right now we'll be on this Lord willing for a little while here maybe by God's grace and then the third theme is the walk and warfare of the believer chapter 4 to the end of 624 and also as I told everybody on Wednesday you know I've been studying on the Philadelphia Church age but I just kind of felt more inspiration right here in the book of Ephesians so just trying to follow the leading of the Lord now I want to look at this thought again in chapter 2 so if you have your Bibles Ephesians 2:19 I just want to review this little thought on how we're built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets this time I'm going to the church age book on Wednesday I showed what the Prophet taught in the actual sermon itself from the Philadelphia and church age because there's a little bit of overlap here in the Philadelphia Church age I haven't started that yet but the Prophet brings up Ephesians 2:19 through 22 and so I thought well we'll just lay that in there it works out pretty good because we're getting ready to go into that here's what the Prophet teaches in the church age book not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be made pillars in the temple of God but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us now he's going to make the overcomer a pillar in that temple but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the superstructure he said praise God that puts the overcomer right where in with the apostles and prophets then he quotes what we just read as part of our text so that's why I couldn't help but add this part I couldn't help but jump ahead in the Philadelphia Church age and bring this to where we are an emphasis which I think is a nice confirmation of where we are because we read our text this morning and we are no longer strangers of foreigners were fellow citizens and we're build upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone and I want to just take a moment look at this in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of the holy spirit so recall again that you know we are the dwelling place of the holy spirit we when we gather we should see the Holy Spirit all a spirit dwells and here brother Branham and he continues in the church age book and verse 22 were builded together with them I love this everything went through the door Jesus and as part of that body or temple now when God puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of that foundation group what is he doing he's giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and prophets had and he quotes Peter where Peter said he had the revelation that Jesus was the Christ there he is and that word there he stands and I like this no one can get him out amen when you are a part when you're an overcomer you become a pillar in the temple of God you're a part of the foundation you're a part of the prophets you're a part of the apostles you are a continuation of the book of Acts amen Alleluia but we know that we've got to grow as a church and as believers we've got to be growing back to the original Pentecostal faith we and that's where we've got to go and the Prophet said this he said let's come back come back to the altar rebuild the altar again that's been torn down and build up your home so see your home should becoming more of an altar and the church said not less of an altar but our home should be building into more of an altar my prayer this morning my prayer closet was God help my prayers to be more sincere in my closet than they are at church but you understand and they should be sincere both places but let in other words let there be such a reality of Jesus Christ in my home that when I go to church it's just a continuation of the this presence I feel at home does ever understand that and then he says oh that's okay he said take the cards off the table now we got to take the cards off our phones and the church said and the old love story magazines and open up the Bible read the Bible and pray and don't just get down and say bless my family Mary Joe John and all heaven go to bed no sir stay there with God no recently I had a friend tell me that you know he had really had a lot of confidence in when is one of his friends as being a real Holy Ghost film message believer he said one day he come downstairs and he's seen his friend there on a Sunday morning and the friend was playing cards on his phone and he was saying how burden him and he he felt he should have said something to correct his friend there and he was going to make some major decisions in the life coming up you know with marriage and family all these things and he said he wished he would have corrected him on those things but he didn't he said he felt he missed the leadership of the holy spirit and it turned out this person made these major decisions and has now left the message and this person was telling me he said I missed the leadership of the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit will take all the worldliness out of your life and I just want to bring that up that thought just caning I didn't plan to say that I just hope that helps you by God's grace cards on the phone and and we can see we can apply the message to 2017 right now right we can apply that to right now what's that card game they were playing I don't remember you know some people play that game I can't remember I was never into cards forgive me I can't solitaire that's it right there as it is solitaire and you know I'm not you know I'm not God but I'm just saying look at the quote and then we see from a purse I see from a personal experience of playing cards and then some thinking somebody's born again and then give us some time and the seed is gonna show what kind of seat it is praise the Lord let the watering come let the winds come pretty soon let the seasons come and go you're gonna find out what that seed really is on the inside aren't you glad your life is a testimony that the seed inside of you is Christ the word amen your life is not given away to two worldly things and pleasures and cares this world but through time through every season God has made your life beautiful amen in his time hallelujah that's all we need stay there so that's what we need in our homes that's what I've been praying for God let my prayers because I see that you know as I go through scenes of my life my prayers here at church can be more sincere than at home and that's not right my prayers at home should be more sincere or just as sincere as my prayers here at church that's right now I want to read a few more talks about the songs used to saying and he said he said that's what we need again I can tell him all my troubles alone he said them kind of meetings and that kind of a church that's the kind of church that prays down the blessings of God how many want to be part of that church I do a church that prays down you get so contact with God that God sends his wheel down and answers your prayers hallelujah I'm sure your pastor would appreciate every member becoming like that and you'd appreciate me coming like that right how that he and how it would be if the church could just be like that praise God and the music continually played and then I heard that I knowed it was my time to come out now here I'm bringing this back from when the attempt the tabernacle was dedicated when a minister walks in the congregation of people praying it in the anointing of the Spirit you're bound to hear from heaven that's just all there's no way to keep from it so there's the law of God of reaping or sowing and reaping the Prophet said we need to build up our homes to be a prayer or altar right and then we need a kind of church that prays the blessings down and then he says when you have that and you pray a church then the Spirit of God can move and you're going to hear from heaven nothing can stop that when people want to hear from heaven they pray to the spirit to speak the spear speaks and they rejoice in what heaven tells them then they get there to strut instructions from heaven and then thy kingdom has come upon this earth thy kingdom has come thy will is done on earth as it is in heaven praise God because they pray down the will of God and the blessings of God amen it's so important Church if you're not praying here it's so important to pray at home in the mornings Saturday Sunday it's so important for you to do that we've got to do that if we want the God to move in our mitts praise God and now I'm just bringing this quote where brother Graham's talking to two brothers Collins and Hickerson because they had a ministry together for the church he said that's isn't the ministry brother Neville he said that's your that's your ministry to the church he said that's your example then he said you brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God let me stop right there where were they supposed to get their gifts in place at the house of God as the ester is interested in getting his because it's just essential that you do it but you can't do in the privacy on the room now he's going back to their gifts if you speak and you neuter prett you've got to come together now come together in the church often a room yourself because you have a private ministry it's not an openly ministry it's one that's the help let's the help the church how many want to help the church this morning how many want the church to be a habitation of the Spirit oh that's what we're talking about in Ephesians 2 we're supposed to be a habitation where the Holy Spirit can dwell but see every person has to be just as interested in being in your position as the pastor or the piano player or everybody else aren't you glad when Loras takes his position at the piano aren't you glad when I take my position as a song leader and a pastor aren't you glad that well everybody has a position and it's so essential that everybody gets in their position amen so we can be a habitation for the Holy Spirit I just want to remind those to you I've preached you know those over the years you know and I just want to remind it's so it's so essential your part is so important the house of God and you say well maybe I don't speak in tongues well maybe you might interpret maybe idols interpret maybe you might have a word of wisdom maybe you might have a gift of knowledge but we want the Spirit to dwell amongst us and it takes your efforts and my efforts takes all of us together I hope that will help us I hope we can grow into that by God's grace I'm trusting we can grow into that I'm trusting you and you have to trust me a man that we can grow into it now let's move now to chapter 3 so that I just wanted to finish chapter 2 of that and if I if I get more inspiration on that I'll bring it back to you but remember God builds us to a habitation of God through the Holy Spirit that's what we're supposed to be building to now Paul goes into Revelation this is going to be a little bit of review for some of us maybe not for others of us I know the young people or the younger you know people might be really helped by this but in let's go to Ephesians 3 verse 1 we'll read 1 through 6 visions three one through six and remember this was penned by a Holy Ghost filled prophet of God in a prison who had a burden to help out the church at Ephesus because of false doctrines and because he saw the families were weak he saw the marriages were weak he saw they wouldn't they weren't putting on the full armor of God and the Holy Ghost wrote this now god help us to catch this for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles there he is dying wasting away in a prison he said i'm actually not a prisoner of rome i'm a prisoner of christ mercy God if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery so Jesus Christ Himself came to Paul and made him this next mystery known this mystery of the one body or one family or one church made of both Jews and Gentiles glory and he says as I wrote afore in a few words verse four whereby when we read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ do we I hope we understand what a what a tremendous blessing it is that you and I understand Paul's knowledge in Christ now everybody has this knowledge there's Christians that are now they're really nice people but they're trying to be more Jewish by adopting Jewish observations and holy days and and Paul never told them to do that we see they're trying to be more Jewish elite and no doubt the law was holy but that's not necessarily what we have to do now and they do that because they're not really sanctified the right way right and they feel a burden to do something more to sanctify themselves rather than getting the sin out of their lives do you understand me because they're cussing they're watching movies they're listening to dirty music they're going to concerts a rock and rolling country and they're feeling a pole to be more holy but they're not going about it the right way so they're and they have a misunderstanding of this mystery and how the Jews and Gentiles are going to be more one oh the one way we're one is by the cleaning power of the blood of Jesus Christ that's how we're gonna be one hallelujah look at verse five which in other ages was not was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy prophets I'm sorry apostles and prophets by the spirit verse six that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel we are in the st. guy said like this we're in the same body as Abraham Aden oh yeah we're in the same body as Isaac and Jacob and Sarah and Rachel we are in that same body though one body of believers praise God we are the children we are the seed of Abraham hallelujah we're children out of the flesh see that's what like I said the churches they're trying their flesh to do these things to feel like they're part of that body but we get in there through the circumcision of the Holy Spirit amen and that's how we get in there that the mysteries been made known to us I'm so glad the mysteries been made known I've had two people this past month email me and say why don't you keep the Sabbath and it's right along these lines you know what we're talking about here they're trying to oh you why don't you keep the physical Sabbath and I tell them I take I keep the spiritual Sabbath the baptism of the holy ghost that's the spiritual Sabbath I'm keeping and they just can't wrap their heads around it they can't see and I lined up all the scriptures and they they said I can't see it but I said and that's and I realize later it's because the mystery hasn't been revealed to them they still think they have to have their Saturday for the RAM calls Saturday your commercial day he said that's your day to get all your work done how many know that he said that's your commercial day but they're trying to see they're trying to shut Saturday down and just you know do nothing which it's good for your body that will be good for your mind but that's not the reality of what the spiritual rest is the spiritual rest is where your soul has got inside of amen and then your soul says amen to every word of God hallelujah but see it's it's it's taught its taught they're taught to have the natural understanding but not the spiritual understanding hope you can understand that so the Gentiles are fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel look what Scofield said I really like this he said the Gentiles that the Gentiles were to be saved was no mystery they knew that I mean that's written in Isaiah the mystery that was hidden God was the divine purpose to make of Jew and Gentile a holy new thing the church which is his body formed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost like you can read in Isaiah and the Bible said all the Gentiles will come before the temple and it's speaking of the Millenium or speaking of the future home and so the Jews can recognize yeah they're gonna be there eventually gonna be saved you know they're all gonna come follow us but they've got that wrong because what God did is he got rid of the old and he started a new covenant amen and that's that's where the mystery was they think well well the Jews will be saved first but then the Gentiles can be saved at the end but God was saying I was trying to put the the wedding marriage or the wedding ring of unmerited grace on your finger by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they turned it down so God said I'll blind them I'll put them away for a season and I'll go get me a Gentile bride amen a bride that will love every word and live by every word will be a true wife to me amen that's what they missed they knew the scriptures to the Gentiles shall come and worship before the temple they knew that but they didn't know we'd all be in one body with one power with one blessings of God amen and he says the revelation of this mystery was committed to Paul in his writings alone so see we don't find in Peter we don't find it in James we don't find this in John it's just in Paul's writings alone we find the doctrine position walk and destiny of the church amen aren't you glad now this was not revealed in other ages but it's now revealed to us remember this is one of the the great Bible revelations the twelve revelations in the Bible the 12 mysteries in the Bible I should have put mysteries so let's review these just briefly so you don't forget I've witnessed to people this summer and everything I said you know God had 12 mysteries you should come to our church in here I'm like okay and they don't know nothing it doesn't catch them but when I heard it it did something to me praise God because I want to know God's truth I wouldn't know God's commandments I want all of God I want to know God's Word amen so the one we're looking at is the second one there's 12 New Testament mysteries and brother man preaches us and services it's the end time 1962 the Kingdom of Heaven which has seven parable mysteries I preached on that or two years ago the one body of Jews and Gentiles the New Testament church is the Bride of Christ the catching away or rapture the church is called a mystery now we'll stop there here's the seven parable mysteries that Christ preached the seeds on the four grounds there's your four three classes with the fourth class the wheat and the tares the grain and mut of mustard seed 11 hid in three measures of meal the treasure in the field the Pearl great price and the net cast into the sea we have that sermon on our YouTube page if you'd like to go back and listen to that that was just a tremendous I just felt a tremendous anointing during that service now moving on the fifth mystery is the will of God to you personally and to the church to your age as well number six the mystery of godliness which I believe is a statue perfect man I personally believe that my self brother Ram didn't say that but he didn't say much about that at all but I believe that's to me that's the further revelation of the word that's the statue pervert man because godliness is right before brotherly kindness and then the charity the baptism of the holy ghost now seventh the seven stars eighth is the Godhead the Father God father in christ in colossians two to the godhead god's one person number nine the iniquity which is the antichrist sphere the mystery of iniquity and number ten mystery babylon number eleven israel's blindness and gentile dispensation that's in Romans 11:25 then you have the 12th and final mystery of I seen you the hope of glory amen how many appreciate the mysteries of God you see so you can get in the rapture without the 12 mysteries being revealed to you because the Holy Ghost is a mystery the Holy Ghost is a person that must be personally revealed to you and I are these mysteries important extremely extremely important that's why God had to send a prophet hallelujah now beyond that church you have mystery troops because Jesus that Elijah will come and restore all things so beyond all the mysteries beyond that now you've got mystery troops that must be restored in other words the faith of the Apostolic fathers must be brought back to us amen so see we have the baptism there receive the serpent holiness daily life and modest clothing clothing the fivefold ministry and the gifts of the Spirit which is the power of the Holy Spirit as well as well tithes and offerings three New Testament works of grace the future home marriage and divorce the position of women with their gifts and not in aloud in the pulpit the predestination grace and truth not disgrace but true grace the anointed ones at the end time the anointing of the Holy Spirit three divine oranges secret praying alms giving and fasting and you can go on and on and on aren't you glad that the Bible's restored to you now each church is kind of had like a little piece of these of these mysteries or truths but not all of it but we're the Church of the Living God and God has restored all the mysteries of God amen aren't you glad to be a part of a church that has all the mysteries preached to it plus all the restored truths of the Bible hallelujah glory we ought to be Church amen you ought to be happy about that if not something's wrong with your walk with God amen because this this unlocks relationship as we said on Wednesday this unlocks access to God through relationship the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then access to God through intercession intercessory prayer amen it's exactly right glory now let's look at this we'll keep going in Ephesians three seven just a brief review there hope that's okay we're for I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power God made him a minister by a gift placed in his life now we know as Jesus said the gift will only help people who believe in the gift right so Paul might have had a gift and obviously it didn't work with those in Asia because at the end of his ministry in Asia all Asia had forsaken him let's read that real quick let's go to 2nd Timothy chapter 1 so you can see that by God's grace 2nd Timothy 1 verse 15 how many buddy Paul had to give to God but the gift of God only works when you're in tune with the Holy Spirit that's operating the gift just like Jesus he could not do many mighty works because of unbelief and so it is for me as a pastor so it is for you no matter where you go or what sermons you hear or where if you got lead you to different church who ever maybe you only get out of it what you put into it praise God and Paul said my ministry works by effectual power it works by the flowing of the Holy Spirit and we've got to be the habitation of the Spirit amen then the gifts can really operate and move for us by the grace of God 2nd Timothy 1 verse 14 that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us that's why people can't keep the victory they're not born again but we keep victories by what the Holy Ghost that dwells within us hallelujah verse 15 this thou knowest that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me of whom our fire jealous and Hermogenes an entire continent rejects God's profit now they're not going to be able to say well Paul your gift wasn't good enough you didn't preach good enough for us or you you know your gift was too weak to ministers know said I've got a gift of God and it works by the operation of the Holy Spirit the thing was the people's hearts and minds were not in tune with the Holy Spirit God help us to be in tune with the Holy Spirit amen the gift will only work if you're in tune with what the spirits saying amen that's exactly right that's a burden for me as a pastor I want the gift of God in my life to minister to you but you've got to have the right attitude toward the gift of God I was there at preaching in New York and I remember brother Vaughn told me he said brother Jesse God was so anointing you he said my daughter will not move an inch unless the true Holy Ghost is there and he said while you were preaching on Sunday morning my daughter jumped up and she danced around that church so much when she finally came to herself she was in the back staring at the back wall and finally didn't even know where she was at I like that because that's getting drunk in the Holy Spirit and then your soul filled with the Holy Spirit God can speak anything and you obey it praise God hallelujah so I know when I can get in the channel when you can get in the channel I know the gift of God is effective it'll work if we just have faith in God but you've got to have your heart in the right condition so do I see it's an effectual gift so there's there's power in the gift but it's all about your attitude to that right sometimes people give the ministers bad looks sometimes they fall asleep in the sermon right sometimes they'll walk out and slam the door now we don't have that our church at least I haven't seen it for a while but see how much the attitude makes a difference it's all about the attitude a whole oh it doesn't bother party I'm sorry but ma'am said Paul's missionary gift was the greatest missionary give that ever struck the world the greatest missionary ever was Paul and a whole nation turns him down because they're not giving respect to the gifting of God in his life god help us to be more respectful hallelujah any gift of God can operate if we've got the right respect towards God god help us so see Paul was made a minister according to the gift of God and by the effectual working of the power of God it was God's power that we was gonna work through him now look what he says in verse eight here's our text yes here's what I wanted to go to I'm doing pretty good on time as well by God's grace fusions 3:8 here now we got to our text here let me just set a timers all right unto me who am less than the least of the Saints in this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ Paul was preaching on searchable riches that means brother bang you and I couldn't even find him out there so great we go looking for him we can find him you ever go on a scavenger hunt and not find what you're looking for I know you've been to the store and you haven't found what you're looking for I know that it's unsearchable I just couldn't find that there out of it oh they're all out of this they're out of that Paul says I'm preaching on searchable riches riches that are so great you can't even find them out and yet a whole nation turns him down turns out his gift cuz whatever reason they don't like Paul they're like his doctrine they got a bad attitude toward him and yet he says I'm preaching brother Graham says every preacher is preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ amen that means Christ has riches that we don't even know but we've got to preach that they're available they're out there for us if we'll just believe amen if we'll just have trust in God's Word now Paul said he's less than the least so I thought of myself well how humble are we if he is placing himself lesser than the least like brother Ram said he's like the skin on the bottom of a foot you know that's on the head of the serpent you know or the lowest thing in the body that's what Paul's placing himself a man who had such great revelations and wrote most of the Bible the New Testament he humbled himself this is how much he thought of himself in church let's have a reality of this that you and I know not joking around her silliness but in reality we think so little of ourselves that we can be humble like Paul and the only way up is down the only way up is down look how Paul see how Paul was exalted up it's because he'd humble himself I realize I am nothing so I just give a little just a chart here or just a you know an order Paul said he's Lisa the apostles here's the apostles he's lower than them then he's least of all the saints and then he said I was the chief of all sinners see he's remembering where he came from now I know he's not a sinner anymore but I'm just showing you where he placed himself he never forgot what he used to do he never forgot where he came from now really of course he places himself then right here but I just want to show you the illustration he said I was even the chief of all sinners so if you're the chief of all sinners you're actually the lowest of the low right you are the lowest of the low so he used his memory and sinful background about his memory about a simple background as spiritual motivation to do something for the Lord that's what he said he said this for I am the least of the Apostles he said that am not neat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of God which was with me recently I had to cast down a pride devil you ever had to cast down a pride devil we had visitors come and visit our Bible club some grandparents and I had 80 kids in there and I'm controlling them teaching them you know trying to keep them on task and minister to them by the Holy Spirit and I was really we had a really good service you know and some of the kids got baptized now I asked him you want to Lord Jesus Christ or father son Holy Ghost and and I sent him the scriptures I sent him nine scriptures I let them decide and so I baptized none of those you know all the ones that want to say Father Son Holy Ghost I let the other guy baptize I told him I said this is why and I showed him you know showed him in the scripture why but it and then we had you know numerous children give their hearts to Lord and get baptized and we were rejoicing we're just happy they want to serve the Lord but one of the grandparents come up to me and said he said something along these lines there's a pride demon I could tell because I was feeling really good and I was almost tempted to agree with him he said why I've been to so many churches and youth meetings and he said you're the best and this and this and all that and I I was gonna say thank you but all of a sudden this scripture came to my mind like it shot down from heaven you ever had that before your flesh is just ready to say something and it came to me and I felt like I got inoculated I got a shot and I said and I bowed my head and said no I am what I am by the grace of God I said there's nothing good about me and I just I left there feeling good I got a victory over that pride demon amen and the man beep I didn't know what he was doing but that's his way to express his love but I knew for me it would have been pride to agree with that and I remember where did I come from I was the guy and I've got pictures of this if you want to seen at home I was the guy at Sunday school like this and we're all in circles and I'm going like this I'm I don't even look at the teacher I look so see none of you are that bad children Lydia maokai none of you are as bad as I was I would give the teacher such disrespect and I say that to my shame so I would say I was the least of the least if I could say like Paul I would just bow my head there in shame then when they talked to me I talked it put my head back down so I was too busy staying up late watching Saturday Night Live and all this they have any energy for church when I was in high school and I remember I must remember what I was I was the one that used to run out of church so I go listen to rock and roll in the car after church I was the one looking at the clock will pastor when you gonna finish I was the lowest of the low but by the grace of God I am what I am now and I want to be like Paul I want to labor more than other people not because it's me but because I remember what I was I want to I want to undo all that and I want to do something for the kingdom of God you understand I can't say it may be just the way I want to but I hope you can understand that's what Paul did Paul said I persecuted the church I want to do and I'm less than all the least of the Saints I'm the lowest of the low remember to who much is forgiven God loves much right whoever is forgiven much they're just loveth much forgive me like the woman caught in adultery and the woman who washes feet there the prostitute woman jesus said he who loved or forgiven much loves much in that church that may she make you and I love Christ more and more amen remember how awful you were remember the evil things you did and we can thank God for where he's brought us from amen so see it was the grace that caused him to work harder he labored more than Peter he labored more than James he labored more than Thaddeus he labored more than John Paul labored more than all of them because he had that inspiration right he said I'm lower than the low you see how humbling yourself will make you do more for the kingdom of God it's not gonna make you do less when you humble yourself it's actually gonna make you labor more for Christ so you can look at your life now and say what am i laboring what am i doing for Christ and you can see it while I'm laboring a lot because I really because I'm staying humble but if you're getting prideful you're not doing anything for the kingdom of God because humility causes you to labor that's what happened to Paul how many say lord help me with my humility I have my hands up I am what I am by God's grace I'm nothing we're nothing god help us to humble ourselves and pray down the blessings of God amen because that's one thing we can do we can humble ourselves and pray to God amen remember it's not about the big lights and Hollywood and show and numbers and all these things that's just about sincere contact with God Almighty amen so how humble are we I just I just thought yesterday I just put it up there Paul was in prison preaching the gospel yet still able to minister the churches he could have given up he could have said I'm you know I'm chained up I'm i can't move i got this Roman soldier chained up to me I'll just give up I'll just pack it in and well wait for the right for the rapture that's what we sound like sometimes but I'll just give up I'll just wait for the rapture no stay busy let us labor for the mass from the dawn till Setting Sun amen let us talk of all his wondrous love and care amen he's still able to be a minister while in prison I like that he humbled himself even though the revelation even though the 12 mysteries have been made known to you you and I must stay humble even though all the mystery truths are revealed to you and I we've got to stay humble and remember were the least of the least we have to do that then we'll actually work and do something for God then I'll say like this then we can labour in prayer then we can labor for witnessing then we can labor and a gift then we can labor in a ministry but we the reason we're not is we're not humble enough God humble us amen that's my prayer God humbles to do something that's what Paul saying here it was the grace of God that was causing me to do this never I understand is there anything confusing so far raise your hand I'll try to answer it anything confusing so far pretty familiar okay praise the Lord all right now let's get in this last thought here maybe the last thought will see the unsearchable riches of Christ thank you Jesus this is Ephesians 3:8 yo kalbarri did again unto me Who am less than the least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches Christ this scripture has always been a little bit of a puzzle to me I don't know about you but I thought what are the unsearchable riches of Christ so I just you know being a you know a simple man that I am I just typed in unsearchable riches and brother brems quotes and there's 18 quotes on it so I chose the ones I think I might have let's see three four five six I might have about ten of them so let's go through these can we go through these real quick by God's grace how many appreciate the unsearchable riches of Christ whether you know it or not if you're sitting here and you are a genuine believer you've already experienced some of the riches of Christ the thing is though the thing we have to remember is that we need to keep hungering for more of the riches of Christ because we get complacent in America of course any church in any but especially America we have to remember there's things out there that God wants to do if we'll just get in his will if we'll just get in under the anointing there are unsearchable things out there banking I wonder of and I could look back to when we started the church back in June of 2006 all the unsearchable things that have happened now now they're now they're known like saving family members and things like that God heal and different people and doing great blessings but they were unsearchable back then but because we stayed in the Word of God they become a reality praise God the riches of Christ our reality brother man you and I and sister beau and my wife John Lisa we see the riches of Christ because we preach the word and now we see the riches what are they their souls amen what are they they're their testimonies there there are time-tested memorials of the glory and power of Christ letting his kingdom come down to this earth amen glory let's go through some of these I'm just being I'm just enthused for these so bear with me hallelujah we need to be enthused now bear with you don't lose your attention Herod he's talked about John the Baptist Herod come up you know that with his brother Philips wife I can hear some of the outers come out say don't preach on marriage and divorce today now there's Herod setting down there old John full of the Holy Ghost can you imagine him holding back walked right straight up to his face said it's not lawful for you to have her that's right God give us some John's why I say today what the Baptist Church they're needin some more John's like John the Baptist who will not compromise but will preach the unsearchable riches of Christ see how humble he makes this so did you catch that marriage and divorce are some of the riches of Christ and the church said are you with me he said we need some more John's that I'll tell the truth won't compromise with the word and preach to them the will of God and brother Ram said they're on there preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ hey man see if he would obey this Herod he could have repented Herodias could have repented they could have separated and they perhaps could have got saved that would have been the greatest riches of Christ would be salvation does that help by God's grace you see we so I always thought it was so far away but brother Adam comes down on down and brings it it's it's these truths that we need to hear it's all the riches of God's Word that will guide our lives those are the riches of Christ oh my he man he said help me dear God to stand there in the valley stand with the sword in hand granite Lord and preach the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ telling men and women their what how how holy they are how great they are how rich and handsome and pretty they are no tell them their sins then you're preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ hope this is opening some of our eyes a little bit helping us and before the unless they confess it and die out to self and become born-again they're an alien from you that's see see how that ties in with the riches of this mystery Paul's talking about unless they repent and have get rid of their sins and place their faith in Christ they don't accept they do not obtain the riches of Christ which are forgiveness which are salvation which is power which is love all these things you and I should have amen glory that's the riches of Christ telling them their sins God this lovely big Pentecostal Full Gospel group of men and women how all they've received the knowledge of truth God let them walk in the truth now see let them live and preach and do the things that the Scriptures telling them to do anything that was including the atonement is personal property for every believer can you say Amen when a man gets saved or a woman or boy or girl God gives them a checkbook as it was with Jesus name at the bottom of every check for anything redemptive blessing that Jesus died for it's your personal property don't be afraid to fill it out the bank of heaven will recognize it jesus said what summer things you desire when you pray believe you receive it whatever you ask the father my name that will I do now listen the unlimited unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ in that promise amen whatever you ask see its unsearchable think about if God Terry's ten more years think about the unsearchable riches of Christ that will experience the riches of his love the riches of healing the riches of victory the riches of power the riches of soul saved these are the riches of God that we want in our lives amen unlimited Jesus made it unlimited kind like we we all want unlimited data on our phones right well that's what Christ gives he gives us unlimited data from heaven hallelujah unlimited power but we've got to ask we got to pray we got to get in the channel of the Holy Spirit what does God want to do today what does God want to do this year we have to get in the channel of that don't be afraid to fill out the check I love it don't you hear you him oh you're such a lovely people I could say the same this morning I looked a while ago when I asked you to raise your hands and just something to me said lookee here so he's doing an altar call you ask people to raise their hands for I don't know if it of salvation and the Holy Ghost but probably of those and I said lookie here someday when you see those same hands raised to the God of heaven so the prophets seeing a spiritual thing those that raise their hands this morning he said I'm gonna see them raise their hands in glory when they're crowning Jesus king of kings and Lord of lords think of it so see when you raise your hand to be saved or I want the Holy Ghost see what are you doing you're showing that one day you're gonna crown Christ as Lord and king of kings and Lord of lords how do you raise your hands here we'll raise our hands there and praise to Jesus Christ when Jesus comes and we're the redeemed stands there singing those Redemption songs angels will be circled around the earth with bowed heads not knowing what they're talking about they never need redeeming they don't know what it means to be lost and found but we was lost and we're and we sing the redemptive story I'm finishing the quote tens of thousands time ten thousands with their hands up singing the redemptive stories while they're crowning him King and King and Lord of lords when the angels with their heads bowed around the earth oh what a day God let me preach the unsearchable riches of Christ until death shall set me free is my prayer amen it's unsearchable can you imagine just because you raise your hand here and got a change of nature God's gonna let you raise your hands over there and Crown Christ king of kings and Lord of lords it's unsearchable the riches of Christ Jesus hey man how many love the Lord this morning I wonder this morning if we have you at our will and yield ourselves so completely we've we've all yield ourselves a little bit to come to church this morning haven't we but have you yield yourself completely glory complete yielding of ourselves is there more you could yield God help us to think about that this morning now look at the oh my goodness till God can trust us the place that he has put us God can trust me as a father I can trust me as a schoolteacher God can trust me as a pastor I trust him in that position he's gonna uphold the Word of God I wonder this morning of myself if I could be so used to God so God could trust me could trust brother Neville could trust our Deacon board our trustee board our members of our church we will all have a place and we got a duty what's your duty this morning what's your place I hope God can trust you with it the minister has got a place that we stand and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromise that's my duty if he's called to be a preacher he won't spare one thing for one person if he's called to be a preacher and I've tried not to my God's grace let the word go forth if you like it praise God if you say the believes a message then you should listen to the message then you should obey the message amen we all say Oh bro Graham's a prophet I believe the message then let's do what he said praise God hallelujah this man of no education low degrees will rise up in power anointing of the Spirit and go without any education and proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ that's what's great in the sight of God hey you we've never even been there to heaven but yet we're preaching about how great it is hallelujah because it's unsearchable and that's because Heaven's Spirit has entered into your soul amen that's why I can preach about it heavens entered my soul so a part of heaven is inside of me that's why I preached about the unsearchable riches of Christ hey man nobody I never went to any I went to school to be a teacher I didn't go to school to be a preacher so I believe that's me I've risen in the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost and I'm preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ hey man that's my personal testimony I believe that with all my heart I'm almost done I got a few more to go total deliverance that should be the motive every Christian and every person the church is to unify ourselves and stick together I'm just gonna talk about how he's talking about he's talking about Church voting cuz they were gonna vote to renovate the tabernacle and he says you know I should throw him out you probably heard that before I'd put my he said I didn't want to build a new tabernacle I don't want to he said we'd have the money to do it he said but when he saw all the people wanted it he threw out his vote and he put his vote in with those people that won to renovate the tabernacle and look what he says here and if this church will just go on the way you're going now and be united together God will it's unlimited what he'll do if we stick together it's unlimited there's no limit its unsearchable what God can do in Akron Ohio if we just all rally together what's it gonna take prayer can take the anointing of the Holy Spirit it's gonna take humility all right we got to humble ourselves we got to find our position in place and God has to trust us there I like that we must stick together that's how we want to be so complete with one another and then so complete in the hands of God oh thank you Jesus Mary's believe that's why we're having this Christian business men's fellowship this morning we're businessmen can worship together on one common believing Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's why we got churches around over the city and around this world that's preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ because we have fellowship together we set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost coming upon us and overshadowing us empowering us with gifts and signs and wonders and miracles why it's the closest thing to heaven there is on earth amen you see how that's what we must preach the unsearchable riches of Christ and it creates such a heavenly atmosphere that heaven comes down amen we all got to support the gift we have to believe in the gifts here we have to find our position find our gifts we've got to have a part in this ministry this endtime ministry praise God I've got four more to go I believe five more let's bow our heads a moment he said with there be any here say brother band remember me let my spiritual eyes come open that I might see and know him how I want to see him how I love him he said raise your hands and say remember me and he says the unsearchable riches of Christ the revealing of his power and goodness may the God of heaven and give mercy kindness and grace to you all so see when there's a response to the people the Prophet said see look at this we've seen the unsearchable riches of Christ we've seen Christ move he's going to give people healing right he's gonna give people power how many of you want power how many people want goodness you see you've got to respond to that you've got to be in the spirit and respond to that and the Prophet said now we're seeing the unsearchable riches of Christ remember I'm just saying what the Prophet said I'm not had you can look all these up adoption for more to go this is number four I remember brother Collins thirty years ago when the church wasn't built yet the little tent meeting we had on the corner my first meeting I was preaching this same gospel the same thing the unsearchable riches of Christ look look what he names water baptism is a rich well how come we don't act like it's rich anymore right honey you just get we just get you know it just becomes common to us but brother Graham said that is one of the she's unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ I know it was for me cuz I was raised in denomination I never heard it when Simon showed it to me it's like all heaven it's like the lights of heaven shining upon me I never knew this my this is all through the Bible this there's only one baptism it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the riches of heaven being given to me amen a believer believing every word to be the truth is one of the riches of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost one of the riches of God divine healing the powers of God just like I preached it now amen he's still preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ now look here's where we got to be in tune with all the preachers saying something you know he's going on that same line and as soon as we hear something that you've already heard what we do is we we may we may shut the preacher off you may shut me up and stop polling and stop hungry and stop wanting to hear the Word of God you may fall asleep you might yawn you might get tired right you might you might walk out and whatever more but see he says I never varied one inch God's reveal more of it to me so as he reveals it I just keep bringing it on he never takes away what has been he just keeps adding more of it now sorry hallelujah to see programs message never changed God just kept adding more revelation more revelation but the people got a hunger for more revelation you've got a hunger for more I've got a hunger for more we have to be a habitation for the Holy Spirit hallelujah and I preached on this often I know I do but Church how can we go any further with God until we get our lives line up with God's Word and really hunger and thirst and forgot let me ask again they don't raise your hands how many people are so completely yielded to God that you know you're in your place in your position and God speaking through you I'm not asking you raise your hands but how many people know that that's a pretty serious question you're so completely yielded you just do what God wants you to do well if we care if we couldn't raise our spiritual hands on that then we should say God take me higher humble me keep me little help me to remember the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ because we're in a spot where if we're not careful it's like there's no more war we don't fight in prayer for souls we don't fight - witness can everybody understand what I'm saying can everybody relate to that there's no more burden to fast there's no more you see that there's no more war because Satan has rocked people to sleep this is not the time to be rocked to sleep this is the time to be awake we're the children of the light we're not children of darkness we're not sleeping we know it's a battle we know it's a war their souls at stake praise God there's unsearchable riches for Christ but we've got to be in tune with that amen it's a wake up call this morning right for all of us and I know we get that constant wake-up call but guess what you need that constant wake-up call right I need that constant wake-up call because I know my life you know your life we must be so completely yielded to God praise the Lord three more our Father he's praying beginning of a service we're need grateful this afternoon for this another privilege to stand the pulpit to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ to a dying world without God so see this is why it's unsearchable people are dying they have no hope that's why the gospel is so powerful it gives people hope and no hope of going with Jesus when he comes one of my youtube videos I got another comment and they said they said brother pastor Smith I blasting the Holy Ghost and I got 13 pages proving why baptize the holy goat or blasting the Holy Ghost can God save me and I said sister I said Paul blasting the Holy Ghost but he did it in ignorance I said you ought to spend 13 pages proven why you are going to be saved rather than dwelling why you think you're going to be lost right because the gospel gives hope and that's what we do we'll build up the case why we can't yield to God more why we can't do this why we can't get more to God let's build the case why we can amen hallelujah because the world's dying let's have hope we know Jesus Christ is coming he says and we're trying Lord to present Jesus Christ to the nation's and while we're assembling here this afternoon may the Holy Spirit speak and warm our hearts here's some more here's some more riches of Christ how many want to warm heart for Jesus not cold when the preaching or : brothers the brothers singing is special but it's warm oh I like that there's a fountain filled with blood all that just warms my soul are you with me it's here to warm your heart to get you more warm for Christ it's here to encourage you while you walk on the way the unsearchable riches of Christ may the sick be healed if you're sick it's here to heal you if you're a sinner you're it's here to save you and those who are discouraged you can be encouraged he already said that twice okay and may God receive all the glory 9 or may be given into his name for that's our purpose amen two more to go this is the second one I'm doing real good on time to praise the Lord and brother and sister even to young folks let's put all the sincerity we can this might be the last revival will ever attend and we may not get through this one until he's coming I'm looking for him today and if he isn't here today I'll be looking for him tomorrow if I'm here and I've been looking for him now since I heard about him returning and that's been 33 years ago when I gave my heart to him I've been behind the pulpit 33 years try and proclaim his unsearchable riches of his glory and I trust that God will make himself known to us all among us that every unbeliever will be saved and all the sick will be healed and the Saints the Lord is believing children will be lifted up in the Holy Spirit how many feel you need a lift up this morning that's why he come I'll preach the unsearchable riches of Christ the preacher will preach unsearchable you grab ahold of that word let that word lift you up into the heavenlies by God's grace amen last one I read this when we preach the church ages I this is a beautiful one this goes into the future revealing of the unsearchable riches of Christ I'm preaching ones that are happening right now healing salvation encouragement lifts you up amen heal you save you the Prophet said see here's the thought of future partake hidden manna I think it will be the eternal partaking of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the eternal ages to come how else could we begin to know the unsearchable riches of his own being all that we have longed to know all of our unanswered questions all that will be revealed it will be from Christ who is our life that we will receive it Oh sometimes we think we get to know him a little of him and his word down there and it's so good it makes us rejoice but one day when our flesh changes that word and he will become what we have never dreamed possible in other words if you're a believer it's only going to get better Church Alleluia if you enjoy the preaching now if you enjoy the songs now if you enjoy the Word of God now it's only gonna get better praise God because he's gonna keep her being more and more of himself I mean look forward to that by God's grace hallelujah now I'm gonna skip to the last few quotes on Wednesday I read this I'm gonna skip ahead I'm gonna skip past that okay let me go back on Wednesday I read this and I was trying to be real gentle with it and I'm gonna be gentle with it again today by God's grace it's a more mature quote the Prophet gives us for marriage and divorce and it's basically saying we need to get borned again in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's like a marriage relationship you can't stay in the kitchen you got to move past the parlor living room and you got to go and receive life and you got to bring forth life right so that's what the Prophet says and he said each age refused to become the further part of him by having spiritual affair I'm gonna skip that word to become pregnant with further part of the word he said you understand the church refused to go further now I'm going down here so it is today with every one of them they failed to take that word they refuse Christ so I want to bring that to today is there something God's trying to lead you into but we're refusing I can't give that up I could never yield to that and yet you know it's God calling you to you that you see what happens when we refuse Christ we've refused the word we don't move on with God I hope everybody here wants to move on with God I hope everybody here wants to be so completely yielded to Christ that you can find your place you can find your position but see what he says here we must accept it and not refuse it we must go further in our walk with God I'm grateful where I've came but I want to go further I'm 36 I want to see what the Lord has in the next 10 years when I'm 46 by God's grace I'm so blessed by what he's done the last 10 years since I was 26 I'm so unsearchable to me I didn't know that but we've got to continue to accept his word what do we need to yield to him is there anything else we need to yield to them or are we completely so full of joy and love right now and we're a revival mode that's wonderful glory but if not then there's something needs to be yielded to we must not refuse what the word is telling us to yield so my last quote nobody I'm sorry got three three more the question is are we going deeper or further with Christ that's the question or have we refused his call to a greater intimacy that's what I was going to get to with the next scripture is the Fellowship of the mystery that word fellowship means intimacy like we just talked about kitchen living room bedroom are we refusing his call or are we commuting our lives more to Christ what I mean by that less cares of the world less care for the apps on your phone that aren't godly I'm not saying don't text people back is that what I'm saying I'm talking about the ones that don't have any spiritual blessing on them that's what I'm talking about like for me I got a quickie here for how much time I spent on Facebook so I've seen Facebook open up Bible studies and somebody got baptized that sister got baptized through that but I've got to be careful not to spend too much time when they're talking just keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and pretty to them just stare at the screen and there's time I could be given to God somehow I do go on there to encourage my friends my old friends I put god bless you happy birthday I'm praying for you and I actually pray for them right there it can be a tool for God these things but we got to make sure everything is unit to him and God is getting the preeminence and everything we do remember this the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word see how you have a passion to read your Bibles in the morning so you gotta have that the cry for reaching out the spirit all begins to fade we don't want to see our walk fade with God brother ran told us what to do and just once more in Shreveport Louisiana he showed us what to do when it begins to fade he said you've got to cry out to God and say God bring it back anoint me again help me to die to myself help me to sacrifice and yield to God bring me back my first love look what he says I've listened this yesterday I was driving the Graham house I thought all this is glorious I found it in a quote listen this if you haven't listened this lately he says this he said let's stand up to our feet everybody he said cry Pentecostal raise up your hands this is what I was saying my brother Brooks was here but at the end of the service remember I said you know that's let's pray out loud like it that's so we want we want everybody to feel so free you can pray out loud to God now some of your needs might be so personal you have to say those out loud but if you listen to a sermon everybody it sounds like everyone in the congregation just crying out to God and if your spiritual you can feel the move of the Holy Spirit ya understand like you have to be so free here and so unit to God that you can actually pray out loud and raise your hands to God a prophet tells you if you want God in your life you've got to you want more of God back in your life you've got to cry out and raise your hands and say once more hallelujah I don't know what to do but it's here let's cry with one Accord but if your cry is this if our if my cries is does it look like I really want more of God you might you might you might but you see how programs trying to bring the people you've got to cry out to God you've got to seek God for you've got to be sincere got to be sincere that's what we've been looking at even last week about be more sincere we have to be more sincere and brother branham is literally shouting at this listen to it if you have he's literally shouting saying what's more hard once more or listen to this the people are just in there hungry for God and see when you get hungry for when a baby gets hungry they start crying out when you get hungry you'll start crying out church and we've heard that so many times but when was the last time we got hungry for God and the pastor like me every pastor just wants to see revival in the church so we got to be patient but we still have to preach it praise God because there might be a couple of that want revival or it might be a time where the whole church ones revival but I felt led to preach this this morning on the unsearchable riches of Christ amen we can have the unsearchable riches of Christ it's what I've been preaching these thirteen years eleven and Akron and then two and Lima I've been preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ for these thirteen years we could have that but we've got to cry out for it if we've lost that initial love for God last quote let's send our feet this last one well the ground said see drunk on the spirit if the Holy Ghost can just pour into you until you're so drunk you forget what your name is do you forget all about your doubts get you so drunk on the spirit do you forget your doubts amen then you can get somewhere with God how many want to get somewhere with God and I don't matter where this happens it might happen at your home it might happen here at the altar might happen at your chair there but if we want more of God you've got to cry out for it and you've got to get so filled with God you forget everything you're worried about forget everything you're scared about forget everything that what who's gonna who's around you you forget about all that you get so filled with the Spirit that God starts flowing through your lips he said then cry once more goes up from the sincerity see
