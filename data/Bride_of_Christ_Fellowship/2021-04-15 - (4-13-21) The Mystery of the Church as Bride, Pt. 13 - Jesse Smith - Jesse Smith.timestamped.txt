[38:22] so by god's grace tonight we'll finish
[38:23] lord winning this series
[38:25] i got three more mystery godhead mystery
[38:28] i've got the mystery of the seven stars
[38:30] and seven candlesticks they got the
[38:31] mystery of the jews and gentiles
[38:33] composing one body
[38:35] so i have those three left to preach to
[38:36] you uh and i've really been enjoying
[38:39] these uh
[38:40] uh these series here that'll be all
[38:41] twelve after that uh and then we got
[38:43] through all those by the grace of the
[38:45] lord the book's going good
[38:47] the gentleman emailed me this week it's
[38:49] a hundred i'm sorry it's 840 pages right
[38:51] now so
[38:52] uh that's pretty long book not as long
[38:54] as that shakespeare book we got but
[38:56] it's pretty long uh he he recommends i
[38:59] break it up into two parts which i
[39:00] thought was really good because it's
[39:01] like the two
[39:02] stacks of bread right there's 12 pieces
[39:05] of shoe brand they're in two stacks of
[39:06] six
[39:08] so i just thought maybe that would be
[39:09] inspired uh but i'm really excited it's
[39:12] still
[39:12] a set for a june release date so thank
[39:15] the lord for that
[39:16] and we'll just trust the lord we'll use
[39:18] it to uh to find those last few souls
[39:20] that want to know the revelation of the
[39:22] mystery of god
[39:23] so tonight let's look at this here uh
[39:26] last time we ended with
[39:27] uh looking at the proverbs 31 woman how
[39:29] she's the type
[39:30] of the bride of jesus christ everything
[39:33] she does
[39:34] uh is a blessing that she's hard to find
[39:37] right
[39:38] uh and she excelled all of the other
[39:40] women right she she was
[39:42] such a godly woman uh her husband
[39:45] praised her her children blessed her
[39:47] and she excelled all the other women so
[39:50] she's a woman above all
[39:51] women and we know that types the bride
[39:53] of jesus christ because she is without
[39:55] spot or without wrinkle
[39:57] you know there's many women or many
[39:59] churches claiming to be the bride of
[40:00] jesus christ
[40:01] but we know there's just one praise god
[40:04] that's the blood washed
[40:05] blood of jesus christ so tonight i want
[40:07] to look at the rewards
[40:08] of being the true bride and then the
[40:11] consequences for rejecting this
[40:13] revelation
[40:14] and i just want to do like a a review i
[40:16] just want to kind of remind us of some
[40:17] of the
[40:18] highlights here i did set my timer so i
[40:20] got 30 minutes
[40:21] i'll try to maybe start closing in 30
[40:24] minutes
[40:24] by god's grace i looked up some new
[40:28] numbers on the number of uh
[40:30] people in some of these groups and it's
[40:32] just astounding to think about but just
[40:36] astounding
[40:38] so let's look at the rewards here uh
[40:40] maybe that the children can have their
[40:41] bibles ready maybe they like to read a
[40:42] little bit
[40:43] you can read some scriptures here
[40:44] tonight so let's look at the rewards if
[40:47] you and i receive the revelation
[40:49] of the church as jesus's bride we're
[40:52] given great rewards
[40:54] now in this life but also in the life to
[40:57] come
[41:01] so the first one are the rewards here
[41:04] and now our first reward is
[41:07] the assurance of eternal life
[41:11] the bible says that we have assurance
[41:14] through the seal of the holy ghost the
[41:16] bible says you are sealed
[41:17] you are marked unto the day of your
[41:20] redemption remember that's an engraving
[41:23] uh we'd say that's a it's like a
[41:25] permanent scarring upon
[41:27] we'd say something that's the that's
[41:29] what the mark means it's like a stamping
[41:31] on
[41:32] and so you have that seal of god you are
[41:35] marked eternally you are gods
[41:39] amen you belong to god
[41:42] praise the lord that's your first uh
[41:45] your first reward
[41:46] is you are forever eternally god's
[41:48] you're marked
[41:50] by his nature so you have you will
[41:52] always have jesus's nature
[41:54] ruling your human nature aren't you glad
[41:56] for that that you will never
[41:58] get so far where uh you know your nature
[42:01] might
[42:02] might show itself for a short period of
[42:04] time but because you've surrendered to
[42:06] jesus christ
[42:07] his nature is gonna bring you back into
[42:10] correction
[42:11] praise god that is an eternal seal
[42:14] thank god that we're marked and we
[42:16] belong to christ
[42:18] we are marked and the bible says that
[42:20] proves we are in his mind before the
[42:22] world was
[42:23] praise god because the bible said we
[42:25] were chosen in christ
[42:26] before the foundation of the world and
[42:29] all those that don't have the mark of
[42:30] christ
[42:31] many of them will take the mark of the
[42:33] beast right and the bible said because
[42:35] their names were not on the lamb's book
[42:37] of life before the foundation of the
[42:38] world
[42:39] amen so that proves our names were on
[42:41] the lamb's book of life
[42:43] before the foundation of the world
[42:45] praise god
[42:47] we are not planning on bowing to the
[42:49] roman catholic church
[42:51] right we are still protesting the
[42:53] authority of the pope
[42:54] right he has no real bible because he's
[42:57] off the scripture he has no bible truth
[43:00] right so we are still in the protestant
[43:04] uh time right we are protesting the
[43:07] false authority
[43:08] of the roman catholic church and we are
[43:11] the true
[43:12] bride of jesus christ all right so we
[43:15] have that assurance that's the first
[43:16] reward you have assurance in your soul
[43:19] it's eternal praise god
[43:21] people that are born again don't have
[43:22] that assurance that's why you can see
[43:24] them they go off and they try to find
[43:26] other things they're trying to satisfy
[43:27] their souls right whether it's drugs or
[43:30] money other kinds of things they'll try
[43:32] anything to satisfy their souls
[43:34] because they don't have that eternal
[43:36] assurance in their souls
[43:39] thank god for his grace the second
[43:40] reward i'm going kind of quickly
[43:43] is we get to see the fruits
[43:46] of our decisions right
[43:49] uh the bible says matthew 5 16. i'm
[43:52] calling on lydia she's the oldest he's
[43:53] used to me calling on it right lydia
[43:56] please don't hold it against me matthew
[43:58] 5 verse 16
[43:59] but you're the oldest son you're up to
[44:01] the challenge
[44:02] matthew 5 16
[44:05] church we will live and see the fruits
[44:08] of our decision and so
[44:09] will other people this is a reward for
[44:12] bringing
[44:13] being the true bride of christ so lydia
[44:15] can you read that for us
[44:22] amen now think about this we're not the
[44:25] mother harlot
[44:27] they're not shining the light of god
[44:29] right the foolish virgin are they really
[44:31] shining the light of god no because
[44:32] their lamp went out
[44:34] right their oil went out so they cannot
[44:36] shine the real light of god
[44:38] but the bride of jesus christ her life
[44:41] and that remember light always means
[44:42] knowledge in the scripture
[44:44] uh light or revelation the light shines
[44:48] before men
[44:49] and they see our good works and glorify
[44:51] our father
[44:52] which is in heaven amen
[44:57] so we have left the foolish virgin group
[45:00] and we've left the mother harlot
[45:01] church and we enjoy a quiet and
[45:03] peaceable life
[45:04] in all godliness and honesty because the
[45:07] bible says
[45:08] all those spiritual blessings are giving
[45:09] to us amen
[45:11] it's land it's spiritual land that we're
[45:13] possessing as we saw on sunday praise
[45:15] god
[45:15] every spiritual blessing has been given
[45:18] to us so we
[45:19] shine in that light we walk in that
[45:21] light our character
[45:22] speaks louder than other people's
[45:24] character it's a reward on this earth
[45:27] you're a light
[45:28] to all men the bible said you shine
[45:31] before men
[45:33] praise god we're not free control
[45:37] and spiritually separated from the world
[45:39] we have a
[45:40] light that we shine because we have
[45:43] oneness with christ
[45:44] like moses amen was in the prince of god
[45:47] and his face showed
[45:48] we should stay in the friends of god and
[45:50] our spiritual life should shine out to
[45:52] the world
[45:53] that's right so we see we have
[45:56] eternal assurance that's our first
[45:58] reward second is the fruits of our
[46:01] decision or the light of our testimony
[46:03] shines and people see it in this day
[46:06] it's so much different than all the
[46:08] other ones
[46:09] right all the other denominations and
[46:12] third
[46:13] i just put this one in here i thought if
[46:15] you and your family receive it
[46:17] your home life is blessed right just
[46:19] like the proverbs 31
[46:21] uh woman right in god's presence in your
[46:25] home
[46:25] is your treasure so you have treasure
[46:28] you know
[46:29] out in public you're a light right you
[46:30] have assurance in here
[46:32] but your home is a place of treasure as
[46:34] well praise god
[46:35] because the bible says parents and
[46:37] children they love one another
[46:39] and they're living in godly harmony home
[46:42] is like heaven on earth
[46:44] praise god just like the church the
[46:46] church should be we should be seated in
[46:48] heavenly places amen
[46:50] and our church should be like a
[46:51] atmosphere where the holy spirit
[46:53] is welcome to dwell praise god and so
[46:57] our church should resemble
[46:58] heaven on earth because we're seated
[47:00] higher in
[47:01] spiritual spheres and spiritual places
[47:04] our thoughts are on
[47:05] things above praise god not on this
[47:07] earth that we don't have carnal thoughts
[47:09] but our thoughts are on things above
[47:11] amen
[47:12] so those three great rewards eternal
[47:14] assurance in here
[47:16] we have a testimony that shines out
[47:18] publicly and our home life
[47:21] is blessed by the treasure of the holy
[47:24] spirit
[47:24] amen now your heavenly
[47:28] rewards are quite uh familiar to us but
[47:30] i'm going to go through them
[47:31] because the children can get them that
[47:33] maybe this time if they haven't got them
[47:34] the first reward lord willing is you'll
[47:38] be in the rapture praise god
[47:40] because it's only for the bride this is
[47:43] the climatic event of human history
[47:45] imagine
[47:46] uh imagine brother brandon said
[47:49] thousands but let's just run it up to a
[47:51] million let's say it's a million bride
[47:52] members
[47:53] imagine a million people escaping
[47:56] the worldwide tribulation period and
[47:58] ultimately death
[47:59] imagine god saving a million people from
[48:02] death and they never have to have a
[48:04] funeral
[48:06] imagine that what a testimony this is
[48:08] going to be
[48:09] so if you're in the rapture or if you if
[48:11] you're in the bride you have the reward
[48:13] of the rapture and then during the
[48:16] tribulation while the world is getting
[48:18] judged
[48:18] you get to sit at a table and have
[48:21] communion with the lord amen
[48:23] oh my that's a great reward the rapture
[48:27] and then the marriage supper the lamb
[48:29] following that
[48:31] uh you get to experience armageddon you
[48:33] get to ride a horse
[48:35] uh in the sky and wear white robes
[48:38] and follow jesus to battle oh hallelujah
[48:42] that's a great reward
[48:44] to be in the army of the lord hallelujah
[48:49] that's why we got to reign the bible if
[48:50] we're going to reign there like the
[48:51] bible said
[48:52] we have to reign over sin here amen
[48:57] and then the bible says after that then
[48:58] you get the reward of
[49:00] living the thousand-year millennial
[49:02] reign
[49:03] because the rest of the dead do not live
[49:06] during this thousand-year period
[49:08] it's only for those who are in the bride
[49:11] those that were beheaded for jesus
[49:12] according to revelation 20
[49:14] for the word of god which had not
[49:16] worshipped the beast that's where we are
[49:18] neither his image neither received his
[49:20] mark upon their foreheads or in their
[49:22] hands
[49:22] amen praise god we might not have to be
[49:25] a martyrs for jesus right but one thing
[49:28] that we surely can do
[49:30] we can reject worshipping the beast we
[49:33] can reject
[49:34] rome and her pagan ways amen that's one
[49:36] thing we can do praise god amen
[49:39] hallelujah we may not we may we may have
[49:42] to suffer persecution in america we know
[49:44] brother and says thus saith the lord
[49:45] but the brahman said thus saith the lord
[49:47] the same persecution they had in ancient
[49:49] rome is coming to the usa
[49:51] so we know it's going to happen
[49:52] according to revelation 13 we don't know
[49:54] if we'll live to see it we don't know if
[49:55] the bride will be a part of it there
[49:56] could be a squeeze time
[49:58] we're not sure uh there's a lot of
[50:00] different quotes and thoughts on that
[50:02] we looked we looked at it a few weeks
[50:04] ago where the bible said we're saved
[50:05] from the wrath of god
[50:07] right so that's what we're resting on
[50:08] that's what we're hoping for praise god
[50:10] but we know christian persecution is
[50:12] happening around the world christians
[50:14] will always be persecuted
[50:16] right if they hated jesus the master
[50:17] they're going to hate the disciples amen
[50:20] right so we got to be willing to give
[50:22] our lives if god should call us to that
[50:25] but the bible said they lived and
[50:27] reigned with christ
[50:29] a thousand years but the rest of the
[50:31] dead lived now
[50:32] again until the thousand years we're
[50:34] finished this is the first resurrection
[50:36] blessed is holy is he that hath part in
[50:38] the first resurrection
[50:40] on such the second death hath no power
[50:43] but they shall be priests of god and of
[50:46] christ and shall reign with him a
[50:48] thousand years
[50:49] amen all right what a promise priests of
[50:52] god
[50:54] and of christ you are a priest you're an
[50:56] intercessor right
[50:57] you're a spiritual leader of god and
[51:00] christ
[51:01] that's what the true bride of jesus
[51:03] christ is
[51:04] and then she reigns with him a thousand
[51:07] years hallelujah
[51:09] now also she sits next to him on his
[51:13] thrones
[51:14] judging the nations for a thousand years
[51:18] this is another great reward right
[51:22] here on earth we may suffer rejection
[51:24] mockery
[51:25] perhaps even physical persecution but we
[51:29] must endure the bible says in second
[51:31] timothy 2 11 and 12
[51:32] it's a faithful saying if we be dead
[51:35] with him we shall also live with him
[51:37] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[51:40] him
[51:40] if we deny him he will deny us so god
[51:43] help us not to deny christ
[51:44] but may god help us to suffer with him
[51:47] that will reign with him
[51:49] oh yes what a promise
[51:53] two more heavenly rewards await we sit
[51:56] with him in judgment at the white throne
[52:00] just like the bible says uh speaks of
[52:02] the queen of the south and the men of
[52:04] nina i want to preach a message on this
[52:06] i want to preach a message on destiny
[52:08] uh there's there's certain you have a
[52:10] destiny right of either
[52:11] either either we are lost or we're saved
[52:13] we have a certain destiny
[52:15] but there are certain moments in our
[52:16] lives that are destiny moments
[52:19] we were destined to do certain things
[52:21] nobody else could do it but you
[52:24] like the queen of the south what was her
[52:26] destiny her destiny was
[52:27] to have the courage to cross the desert
[52:30] to see
[52:31] this wisdom of the of the gift of god
[52:33] and then god is going to use that that
[52:34] was her destiny moment right there
[52:36] god is going to use that decision on the
[52:38] day of judgment
[52:40] it was her destiny she was born
[52:43] far from jerusalem so she could travel
[52:45] to jerusalem amen
[52:47] that was part of her destiny there's
[52:50] going to be moments in our lives where
[52:51] we were
[52:52] born to do something out
[52:57] she was called to to cross the desert
[52:59] some of us are
[53:00] live across states right we talked about
[53:02] that
[53:03] right the men of nineveh they repented
[53:06] at the preaching of jonah
[53:08] right and he said a greater than jonah's
[53:11] here
[53:12] some of us are our destiny is to repent
[53:15] so sincerely
[53:16] right or to get the baptism of the holy
[53:19] ghost in such a powerful way
[53:20] to have such a testimony that god will
[53:22] use our repentance he'll use our baptism
[53:25] of the holy ghost experience
[53:26] he'll use our testimony on the day of
[53:28] judgment against those who would not
[53:30] repent
[53:31] against those who would not be
[53:32] sanctified against those who would not
[53:34] be born again
[53:35] oh may we be fully surrendered to god
[53:37] amen
[53:38] see there's some great thing in your
[53:40] life some great uh
[53:42] moment of destiny where you are to obey
[53:45] the word of god and do something
[53:47] outstanding for the lord
[53:50] and i imagine part of you you won't even
[53:52] realize you're doing it
[53:54] right like that queen of sheba she just
[53:56] sat there like brother dramatizes it
[53:58] he's like i've just got to keep hearing
[54:00] all these things i just got to go here
[54:02] our gods are dead our idols they don't
[54:04] talk and everybody says this man can
[54:06] tell you the secrets of your heart
[54:09] i've just got to cry i just got to do it
[54:11] i want to see if it's real
[54:12] oh my you know we got to look at our
[54:15] lives when we're really hungry to know
[54:17] if god's real
[54:18] that's part of our destiny praise god we
[54:20] got to follow that hunger and thirst
[54:22] in other words we have to keep seeking
[54:24] god until we're satisfied amen
[54:27] that's what she did she kept seeking god
[54:29] she did everything in her physical power
[54:31] to find out is god real and then when
[54:34] god revealed it
[54:35] god called her to her destiny she
[54:37] fulfilled it and then god is going to
[54:38] use that testimony
[54:40] on the day of judgment oh and shall be
[54:42] ever shall be forever known as the woman
[54:45] who made a great sacrifice just to hear
[54:47] the wisdom of god oh some of our
[54:48] testimonies are going to be that
[54:50] we just wanted to hear the word of god
[54:53] we did everything in our power we
[54:54] repented
[54:55] in tears and snot praise god we repented
[54:58] at the altar
[54:59] we danced or we shot it we spoke in
[55:01] tongues when other people wouldn't
[55:03] praise god we believe for miracles
[55:05] when other people wouldn't we've got to
[55:06] find our destiny before god
[55:10] god is calling us to something in here
[55:11] praise god
[55:13] he's calling you to a destiny that's one
[55:15] of your great rewards if you
[55:17] uh if you come to that destiny moment
[55:19] and you fulfill god's word
[55:20] then you will sit with him in his throne
[55:23] on the day of judgment praise god you
[55:26] already have gone to the
[55:27] judgment for rewards as paul said
[55:30] but then at the white throne judgment
[55:32] you will sit there and
[55:34] he will use your testimony look at that
[55:36] a woman judge the queen of the
[55:38] south will judge and condemn that
[55:41] generation
[55:42] imagine if caiaphas will be standing
[55:44] there right
[55:46] and she'll judge caiaphas the bible said
[55:47] she'll judge that generation
[55:49] all that generation shall judge those
[55:51] pharisees that wouldn't go out to john
[55:53] and be baptized right
[55:54] because she crossed the desert just to
[55:56] hear solomon they wouldn't even
[55:58] go out to the desert to be baptized a
[56:00] woman will judge those
[56:01] unbelieving men those cowardly men that
[56:04] godly woman will have a testimony
[56:06] against those ungodly men oh
[56:08] sisters live holy today praise god you
[56:11] brothers live holy
[56:12] your testimony will speak on that day
[56:15] you've got a destiny you've got to
[56:16] fulfill
[56:20] think about that their whole destiny was
[56:21] to hear jonah and then
[56:23] lay in ashes how many days did they do
[56:25] that was it three days
[56:26] 40 oh my goodness that's right 40 days i
[56:28] got some of my stories i got
[56:30] mixed up with esther three days of
[56:31] fasting but that's part of their destiny
[56:34] that was part of their destiny to lay in
[56:36] ashes and humble themselves and seek god
[56:38] for 40 days
[56:39] to not work and just set aside some time
[56:42] to seek god
[56:43] oh let's be sensitive to the holy spirit
[56:46] and see what god is calling us to do
[56:48] if you meet your destiny the bible said
[56:50] to him that overcometh what i grant to
[56:52] sit with me in my throne
[56:53] even as i also overcame and sat down
[56:55] with my father
[56:56] in his throne amen we gotta find what we
[56:59] gotta overcome
[57:00] we've gotta find the challenge god's
[57:02] called us to overcome the queen of the
[57:04] south overcame all the unbelief
[57:05] and the desert amen we've gotta overcome
[57:09] in our way
[57:11] right what was and here's another part
[57:13] of the sermon
[57:14] zerubbabel was called uh to leave
[57:17] babylon and come back and build the
[57:19] temple
[57:19] what was his mountain remember the bible
[57:22] says zerubbabel will speak to the
[57:23] mountain let's read it
[57:24] let's go to uh zechariah 4.
[57:32] zechariah 4. i don't know the verse but
[57:35] i'll be able to find it real quickly
[57:36] when i'm there
[57:37] think about your destiny i guess i
[57:39] didn't i didn't want to preach this too
[57:40] much tonight
[57:41] but i want to kind of save it for again
[57:43] for another night but
[57:44] maybe sunday zechariah 4.
[57:53] look at six we're familiar with this
[57:55] then he answered and speaking of me
[57:56] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[57:58] zerubo is saying
[57:58] not by might nor by power but by my
[58:00] spirit said the lord of hosts remember
[58:02] he saw the vision
[58:03] he saw the two trees feeding the two
[58:04] candlesticks these are the two anointed
[58:06] ones
[58:07] their oil is pouring into the
[58:08] candlesticks the oil is the holy spirit
[58:10] it's not by might not by power but by
[58:12] the spirit but remember
[58:14] they started building the temple they
[58:15] built the altar the temple but they
[58:17] didn't finish the temple they got
[58:18] stopped for 16 years for 16 years they
[58:22] couldn't build the temple
[58:23] because the leadership changed right
[58:25] cyrus went on and
[58:26] there was for the queen of the south her
[58:29] destiny your obstacle was that desert
[58:31] she had to overcome that desert amen
[58:35] those men in nineveh they had to
[58:36] overcome uh
[58:38] their pride they'd overcome their pride
[58:40] and repent and dust
[58:41] and ashes for 40 days that was their
[58:44] destiny
[58:45] and god's gonna use that destiny the
[58:47] fact that they overcame
[58:48] and they met the challenge of that hour
[58:50] god is going to use him on the day of
[58:52] judgment well what's the room of his
[58:53] destiny
[58:55] who art thou o great mountain before
[58:58] zerubbabel will thou shalt become a
[58:59] plain he shall bring forth the headstone
[59:02] thereof with shouting's crying grace
[59:04] grace
[59:05] unto it leave that up there would you
[59:07] what was the roomable's destiny
[59:09] his whole destiny in life was to finish
[59:13] building the temple of god his whole
[59:16] destiny was to be able to climb up there
[59:17] or see the men on the scaffold right
[59:19] and lay that headstone how great it was
[59:21] i wonder how many men
[59:22] had to lay that headstone that
[59:25] that's what his whole life was meant to
[59:27] do was to build
[59:28] one tabernacle that was his destiny but
[59:32] it was a mountain
[59:33] 16-year mountain and before that he had
[59:35] to cross the desert too
[59:38] so he had this huge mountain all these
[59:40] obstacles right
[59:41] and then 16 years of discouragement this
[59:43] church is not we're almost 15 years old
[59:45] i mean that
[59:46] gives us a good idea of how long that's
[59:48] been
[59:50] right this was his whole destiny in life
[59:52] he had to overcome this
[59:54] mountain of government oppression that's
[59:57] what it was
[59:58] the government was keeping him from
[1:00:00] building the temple of god now how is he
[1:00:02] going to open
[1:00:05] by speaking to the mountain right he was
[1:00:07] going to speak to the mountain
[1:00:09] and the bible said when the headstone
[1:00:11] got put down there would be shoutings
[1:00:14] unto the headstone grace grace and that
[1:00:17] means
[1:00:17] favor favor in other words god is going
[1:00:20] to help you overcome by the holy spirit
[1:00:22] god is going to give you favor to move
[1:00:24] this mountain
[1:00:25] amen that was his destiny his destiny
[1:00:28] was to overcome the mountain
[1:00:30] of government oppression in order to
[1:00:33] finish the tabernacle oh
[1:00:35] i hope god is helping us to see our
[1:00:36] destiny tonight praise god
[1:00:38] we might have uh something we have
[1:00:40] something to do for god and it's going
[1:00:42] to be done by the holy spirit
[1:00:44] and we've got to be aware that god's
[1:00:46] favor is going to help us do it because
[1:00:48] god
[1:00:49] favors us because god is on our side
[1:00:52] because god is with us because he's
[1:00:54] chosen us he's helped us
[1:00:56] god's favor is going to move the
[1:00:57] mountain amen
[1:00:59] and then you are going to be an
[1:01:00] overcomer hallelujah
[1:01:02] then he's going to use your overcoming
[1:01:04] testimony on the day of judgment
[1:01:07] it's so simple what's your goal in
[1:01:09] life's removal to finish the house of
[1:01:10] god
[1:01:12] now what's mine it might be uh to keep
[1:01:15] the church of god going right to build a
[1:01:16] church in akron or
[1:01:17] or raise up a church in akron whether we
[1:01:20] get a building or not we're still
[1:01:21] building a spiritual house
[1:01:23] praise god to overcome any mountain of
[1:01:26] obstacles
[1:01:27] but we're going to overcome them by the
[1:01:29] word of god we're going to overcome them
[1:01:30] by god's grace
[1:01:31] coming into the camp by the holy spirit
[1:01:34] strengthening us amen
[1:01:35] by god showing us his favor by god never
[1:01:38] leaving us
[1:01:39] nor forsaking us we've got to make sure
[1:01:42] we don't leave and forsake him
[1:01:44] right so that's about half my sermon
[1:01:47] there so
[1:01:50] but i wonder how many people watch
[1:01:51] wednesday nights so
[1:01:54] naomi might have to sit through it again
[1:01:55] my children might have to sit through it
[1:01:56] again i want to preach on that same
[1:01:58] thought
[1:01:59] about your destiny that's god is going
[1:02:01] to use that in the day of judgment
[1:02:02] zeroable
[1:02:03] he crossed the desert he battled for 16
[1:02:05] years finally the mountain moved
[1:02:07] that was his testimony
[1:02:12] david remember what was samson destroy
[1:02:14] the philistines did he meet his destiny
[1:02:16] yes did he have a lot of failures
[1:02:17] yeah but did he fulfills his destiny yes
[1:02:20] he destroyed more philistines at his
[1:02:21] death than he did in his life
[1:02:23] he helped get them out of the slavery
[1:02:25] right of the oppression of the
[1:02:27] philistines
[1:02:28] that was his destiny and church if you
[1:02:30] really love god
[1:02:31] god will help you fulfill your destiny
[1:02:33] because there's nobody else that can do
[1:02:34] it except you praise god
[1:02:36] you're the only one that can do it
[1:02:40] and then remember god says your
[1:02:41] testimony will judge unbelievers and
[1:02:43] fallen angels know you not that the
[1:02:45] saints will judge the angels
[1:02:49] think about what is your life to
[1:02:50] overcome
[1:02:53] what are you to overcome
[1:02:58] and lastly the last reward is in the new
[1:03:00] jerusalem the bible says
[1:03:02] ever with the lord you're fed by him and
[1:03:04] you serve his desires
[1:03:06] revelation 22 3 and 4 says and there
[1:03:08] shall be no more curse
[1:03:09] but the throne of god unto the lamb
[1:03:11] shall be in it and his servant shall
[1:03:13] serve him and they shall see his face
[1:03:15] and his name shall be in their heads
[1:03:18] oh hallelujah like the jews the bible
[1:03:20] says they get the holy ghost and it's in
[1:03:22] their forehead it's just symbolic of
[1:03:23] your mind is fully sealed to the kingdom
[1:03:26] of god right it's just a seal because
[1:03:28] all the judgments are made in the
[1:03:29] frontal
[1:03:30] cortex right the front part of your
[1:03:31] brain that's where all the judgments are
[1:03:33] made
[1:03:33] so god just symbolizes it he's marking
[1:03:35] you there in other words you
[1:03:37] always do that which the father shows
[1:03:38] you amen
[1:03:40] now let's look at the consequences
[1:03:42] briefly here i got about well that's
[1:03:44] really fast
[1:03:45] i got about six minutes for my 30
[1:03:46] minutes
[1:03:48] the consequence the first consequence is
[1:03:51] if you reject this revelation
[1:03:53] many people go to the lie of
[1:03:55] universalism right oh we're all god's
[1:03:58] children god loves us all the same we're
[1:04:00] all going to heaven
[1:04:01] but that's not true god's love
[1:04:04] is impartial right but his love must be
[1:04:08] received as a gift
[1:04:10] right when a church willingly disobeys
[1:04:14] any part of god's word
[1:04:15] they forfeit either part or all of god's
[1:04:18] blessings the maokai get your bible go
[1:04:20] to john 14 malachi
[1:04:23] we're going to read how obedience
[1:04:25] symbolizes
[1:04:26] love well what's the opposite if
[1:04:28] obedience means love
[1:04:30] then disobedience means hatred
[1:04:33] right obedience equals love for god
[1:04:38] then disobedience equals hatred for god
[1:04:42] these people won't obey god they hate
[1:04:45] god they hate the word
[1:04:46] right they they're like the pharisees
[1:04:48] they have a form of godliness but they
[1:04:49] deny the power thereof
[1:04:51] so maokai john 14 15 read that please
[1:04:58] read 21 please verse 21 same chapter
[1:05:12] hallelujah the ones that love jesus are
[1:05:15] the ones that keep his commands
[1:05:16] and the father loves them read verses 23
[1:05:20] and 24
[1:05:21] four times in this one chapter jesus
[1:05:23] says if you love me
[1:05:25] you'll keep my commands so true love
[1:05:28] submits and obeys the word of god
[1:05:32] go ahead
[1:05:39] my father will love him
[1:05:50] look at that jesus even says my doctrine
[1:05:52] is not mine i got it from the father
[1:05:54] wow what a what a great understanding of
[1:05:56] his entity here
[1:05:57] so again four times before the number of
[1:05:59] deliverance right
[1:06:01] or brother man calls it double
[1:06:02] confirmation you got two and two
[1:06:04] two two's a confirmation and two is a
[1:06:06] confirmation that's a double
[1:06:07] confirmation you got four
[1:06:09] look at that so see love obeys hatred
[1:06:12] disobeys no matter what the outside says
[1:06:17] now doubters of this revelation a second
[1:06:19] consequence
[1:06:20] they live in chaos right uh go to second
[1:06:23] timothy
[1:06:24] three verse one and two second timothy
[1:06:27] three verses one and two
[1:06:32] and again it's connected to love
[1:06:35] the true bride of christ loves her
[1:06:36] husband jesus the word so she's
[1:06:38] she obeys the false brides hate the word
[1:06:42] of god
[1:06:43] they love themselves more than they love
[1:06:45] the word
[1:06:47] okay verses one and two second timothy
[1:06:49] three verses one and two
[1:06:51] this know also then the last days
[1:06:52] perilous times shall come for men should
[1:06:54] be lovers of their own selves
[1:06:56] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[1:06:58] disobedient to parents
[1:07:00] unthankful and unholy can you keep that
[1:07:02] up there
[1:07:03] ii timothy 3 1-2 perilous means
[1:07:06] trouble sometimes so the most troubling
[1:07:09] times are coming at the end
[1:07:11] and what's going to happen they're going
[1:07:12] to love themselves right
[1:07:15] more than god that means if they love
[1:07:17] themselves they're not going to love
[1:07:19] christ the word they're not going to
[1:07:20] obey the word so they're going to
[1:07:21] disobey their parents as well
[1:07:24] so they're going to blast him the holy
[1:07:25] spirit call the work of god they're
[1:07:27] going to call it the work
[1:07:28] of satan yeah go to church right
[1:07:31] call themselves the bride call
[1:07:33] themselves the true church
[1:07:34] that's what they do see so husbands will
[1:07:38] love themselves more than their wives
[1:07:39] and children
[1:07:40] teenagers and children will violently
[1:07:42] rebel against the ones who nurtured them
[1:07:44] and gave them life
[1:07:46] see because they love themselves more
[1:07:47] than they love the word of god instead
[1:07:49] of treasure in their homes the bible
[1:07:50] says they'll have trouble
[1:07:52] right instead of treasure they have
[1:07:54] trouble
[1:07:57] now those who reject part of the
[1:08:00] revelation but receive some of it
[1:08:02] their highest goal can be foolish
[1:08:04] version that's as high as they can go
[1:08:06] but they squander their time so acacia
[1:08:08] ephesians 5
[1:08:10] 15-17 i preached this numerous times so
[1:08:12] is cam
[1:08:13] when he came ephesians 5 15 to 17. so
[1:08:17] the way to see
[1:08:18] foolish version is they don't invest
[1:08:21] their time
[1:08:22] wisely see then that you walk
[1:08:24] circumspectly that means remember
[1:08:26] precisely exactly
[1:08:27] not as fools but as wise redeeming the
[1:08:30] time because the days are evil
[1:08:32] therefore be unwise by understanding
[1:08:35] what the will the lord is the foolish
[1:08:36] virgins really don't know god's will
[1:08:39] right they oh they reject the word they
[1:08:40] don't know they don't love the word they
[1:08:41] don't obey the word
[1:08:43] uh they don't uh oh they don't
[1:08:46] understand
[1:08:46] god's exact will and they don't use
[1:08:48] their time
[1:08:49] wisely remember the bible said they
[1:08:51] should have prepared oil remember that
[1:08:53] the foolish virgin they didn't use their
[1:08:54] time wisely
[1:08:55] they should have prepared oil so they
[1:08:57] would have been ready to last longer
[1:09:00] that's right they're not quite sure of
[1:09:02] god's will
[1:09:03] and they don't get conformed to the full
[1:09:05] image of the word like the bride
[1:09:08] they conform more to the world standards
[1:09:10] remember that third
[1:09:11] remember the third the third ground the
[1:09:14] cares of the world
[1:09:15] choked out the word right the cares of
[1:09:18] the world
[1:09:19] see they care more about the world they
[1:09:20] spent more time in the things of the
[1:09:22] world
[1:09:22] than the things of god amen
[1:09:28] and those the most awful consequence is
[1:09:30] to reject
[1:09:31] and blaspheme this revelation
[1:09:35] many of these people become part of the
[1:09:37] false church the mother harlot
[1:09:38] or will just not be a part of any church
[1:09:41] but god gives a gracious warning he said
[1:09:43] come out of her my people
[1:09:45] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:09:48] that you receive not her plagues
[1:09:50] i'm so glad i heard that voice amen come
[1:09:52] out of denomination come out of the
[1:09:54] assemblies of god although there's some
[1:09:55] good people in there right
[1:09:57] but come out of that denominational
[1:09:58] system that has so many false doctrines
[1:10:01] come out of that my people that you be
[1:10:02] not a partaker of her sins
[1:10:05] and her plagues amen now
[1:10:10] jesus is looking for a bride that
[1:10:12] submits to every word
[1:10:14] and will accept her responsive and her
[1:10:17] ministries
[1:10:19] she'll accept her destiny we have to let
[1:10:22] jesus wash away
[1:10:23] all of our sins right through the water
[1:10:25] of his word
[1:10:27] and jesus offers this bride membership
[1:10:29] to every individual
[1:10:31] he said if any man thirsts let him come
[1:10:33] unto me
[1:10:34] and drink so it all boils down to thirst
[1:10:37] we have to have a greater thirst for
[1:10:39] jesus than anything else we thirst for
[1:10:43] right like if we
[1:10:46] watch if we watch our lives if we look
[1:10:48] at our lives long enough throughout
[1:10:50] like go go on vacation day look at your
[1:10:53] vacation day
[1:10:54] when you have all your free time what
[1:10:55] are you thirsting to do that will tell
[1:10:57] you what you're thirsting for
[1:10:59] right we have to thirst more for god
[1:11:02] than for anything else we must thirst
[1:11:04] for the things of god
[1:11:06] right don't let don't quench your thirst
[1:11:08] with something unholy
[1:11:09] quench your thirst with something holy
[1:11:11] praise god
[1:11:15] see anybody can be part of the bride all
[1:11:17] they got to do is read the bible
[1:11:19] and just live everything straight out of
[1:11:21] the bible that's all they got to do
[1:11:23] this is god's instruction book for the
[1:11:25] bride
[1:11:26] those who obey all of it are the true
[1:11:29] bride
[1:11:31] that's quite an echo there anyways
[1:11:36] the true example of the bride is found
[1:11:38] back in
[1:11:40] genesis 2. adam said this is now bone in
[1:11:44] my bones
[1:11:45] and flesh of my flesh what was the true
[1:11:48] proof that
[1:11:49] eve was one with adam she was a part of
[1:11:52] him
[1:11:53] amen she was she came out from him
[1:11:56] that's the same thing today
[1:11:58] right the true bride brother bam says is
[1:12:00] word of his word
[1:12:01] life of his life spirit of his spirit
[1:12:04] praise god
[1:12:04] amen that shows we came out of jesus's
[1:12:08] heart right
[1:12:09] we came out of the mind of god
[1:12:12] so we must speak the word we must have
[1:12:14] the life of the holy spirit
[1:12:16] and we must uh manifest the holy spirit
[1:12:19] in every area of our lives
[1:12:22] now at the end of this chapter i got
[1:12:23] three actions action steps to becoming a
[1:12:25] bride remember
[1:12:26] you got to repent for disobeying any
[1:12:28] bible command
[1:12:30] and seek the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:32] if you surrender fully he'll come in
[1:12:34] fully
[1:12:35] second in kindness and respect you to
[1:12:37] separate yourself from both foolish and
[1:12:38] false churches
[1:12:39] remember the bible said come out from
[1:12:41] the bible said the deep calls unto the
[1:12:44] deep amen
[1:12:45] if you have a deep call for more of god
[1:12:47] there has to be a deep to respond right
[1:12:50] so a true bride member cannot sit in a
[1:12:52] false church very long
[1:12:53] because there's something calling out
[1:12:55] for more of god there's only something
[1:12:57] there's only one thing that will satisfy
[1:12:59] them
[1:12:59] that's the real holy spirit not just a
[1:13:02] temporary anointing
[1:13:04] but a permanent anointing amen
[1:13:07] and third your growing grace through
[1:13:09] your continual sanctification
[1:13:12] you not only begin holiness you perfect
[1:13:15] holiness the bible says in second
[1:13:16] corinthians 7
[1:13:17] 1 having therefore these promises dearly
[1:13:20] beloved
[1:13:21] let us cleanse ourselves from all
[1:13:22] filthiness of the flesh and spirit
[1:13:24] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[1:13:27] all right now in closing
[1:13:32] what was the confusion the confusion
[1:13:33] about this mystery is
[1:13:35] who is the true church right
[1:13:38] if we go back to the beginning of this
[1:13:39] series 13 sermons ago
[1:13:43] who is the true church revelation is
[1:13:47] the true church submit to all of jesus's
[1:13:50] commands now
[1:13:52] with the promises of being raptured and
[1:13:54] ruling and reigning with her husband in
[1:13:55] the millennium
[1:13:56] that's the true church praise god
[1:14:00] we saw her evidence so i'm just going to
[1:14:02] quickly go back over this
[1:14:05] we saw god search for a bride in israel
[1:14:07] but she rejected
[1:14:08] so he went to the gentiles he went to
[1:14:10] the world
[1:14:11] and then we saw the blueprint for
[1:14:13] becoming a bride member
[1:14:14] is the three works of grace like paul
[1:14:16] taught praise god
[1:14:18] and then we saw anyone changing the
[1:14:20] gospel blueprint was cursed anyone
[1:14:22] changing the way
[1:14:24] you become a bride member is cursed
[1:14:26] either now
[1:14:27] there'll be certain curses now but
[1:14:29] certain curses later
[1:14:31] and there's five attributes to the
[1:14:33] bride's character right
[1:14:34] christ is her head first
[1:14:38] complete submission to everything she
[1:14:40] goes through christ's washing
[1:14:42] process number four she's joined or
[1:14:44] glued to christ
[1:14:46] and his body the church and then she has
[1:14:49] the
[1:14:49] attitude of reverence the bible said
[1:14:52] amen remember church we judge the groups
[1:14:56] by their fruits catholics 1.3 billion
[1:15:00] protestants 900 million
[1:15:03] eastern orthodox 270 million anglican
[1:15:06] 110 million
[1:15:08] oriental orthodox 62 million here's some
[1:15:10] others
[1:15:12] the evangelical alliance has 600 million
[1:15:15] i wonder what group that is it's a bunch
[1:15:17] of evangelicals
[1:15:19] kind of like a billy graham group
[1:15:21] anglicans we said
[1:15:22] uh 110 million here's some other ones
[1:15:25] the reformed churches have a hundred
[1:15:27] million
[1:15:29] the anglo i'm sorry the lutherans
[1:15:33] 75 million now here's mine that i grew
[1:15:36] up in the assemblies of god pentecostals
[1:15:37] have 68 million around the world
[1:15:40] 68 million
[1:15:44] the baptist world alliance 48 million
[1:15:47] the methodist council 80 million
[1:15:53] church of england 26 million
[1:15:58] uh the church of christ in congo 25 and
[1:16:01] a half
[1:16:04] million
[1:16:06] okay there's a bunch of other ones here
[1:16:07] not going to go through all those
[1:16:10] oh southern baptist convention has 14.5
[1:16:13] million they meet in
[1:16:14] uh america every year wow i've heard
[1:16:16] about them
[1:16:20] all right so these huge numbers
[1:16:23] they have all these massive numbers but
[1:16:25] do they live by every word
[1:16:27] no they don't live by everywhere right
[1:16:31] let me go over this real quick how many
[1:16:33] remember the uh
[1:16:34] the 11 attributes of the mystery babylon
[1:16:39] she's a church that's them second
[1:16:42] she's a modern day babylon confusion
[1:16:46] they say salvation for a catholic is one
[1:16:48] of the most hardest processes to
[1:16:50] understand mentally
[1:16:52] it's so hard to know if you're saved
[1:16:53] because it's so much confusion babylon
[1:16:57] third she's a harlot like jezebel
[1:17:00] right which was sexual immorality with
[1:17:02] their abusing
[1:17:03] uh children death and idolatry wars of
[1:17:06] inquisition
[1:17:07] and the veneration of statues and images
[1:17:10] four she sits on many waters
[1:17:12] right around the world fifth she sits on
[1:17:15] seven mountains or hills the seven
[1:17:18] ancient hills of rome six she's a
[1:17:20] to christ
[1:17:21] she's a so she makes love with all
[1:17:24] the merchants of the world
[1:17:28] seventh she wears scarlet and purple
[1:17:31] eighth she's very wealthy ninth she's
