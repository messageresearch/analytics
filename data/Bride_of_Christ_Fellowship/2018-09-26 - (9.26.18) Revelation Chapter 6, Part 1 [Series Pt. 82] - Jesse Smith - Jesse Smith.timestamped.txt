[16:40] announcements here by the grace of the
[16:41] Lord as I said there's numerous prayer
[16:47] requests here
[16:48] let's do announcements first though this
[16:51] Sunday we have two services with brother
[16:52] Diggs we're looking forward to him
[16:54] coming by God's grace all the way from
[16:56] South Carolina so he'll get in Saturday
[16:59] and then he's going to stay Saturday
[17:00] night Sunday night leave out Monday
[17:02] morning so look forward to that by God's
[17:05] grace thanks for everyone who was able
[17:07] to attend the carry in and all the the
[17:10] gifts they got the going-away gifts they
[17:12] got for brother William that was really
[17:13] nice I miss our brother amen but thank
[17:16] you for the support there by the grace
[17:18] of the Lord I want to just read this I
[17:26] guess concerning prophecy I don't know
[17:28] if you saw but when I was there I saw
[17:30] this article it's from September 22nd so
[17:33] that was went four days ago the Vatican
[17:36] and China had been at odds for decades
[17:38] at the center of their spat who has the
[17:41] right to nominate bishops today in a
[17:44] major concession the Vatican agreed to
[17:46] recognize seven bishops appointed by the
[17:49] Chinese government it's part of a
[17:52] provisional agreement under which both
[17:54] bei Beijing and the Pope will have a
[17:56] say-so on who becomes a bishop so in
[18:02] other words the Catholic Church just
[18:04] bowed to China China's like we're gonna
[18:07] have our own bishops and before the
[18:09] Vatican's like no we got to support them
[18:11] and now they're bowing to China see
[18:14] they're all bowing to Satan so it's just
[18:17] a I wanted to show that as a prophetic
[18:20] move or a prophetic event there that
[18:22] shows even the Uniting times how they're
[18:25] uniting they used to have just well we
[18:27] have to have our way but now the
[18:28] Vatican's like okay we could
[18:30] just do your way to China so remember
[18:33] the Bible said this beast must deceive
[18:35] all nations so that's the midst of it
[18:37] right there there in the midst of being
[18:38] deceived and being deceive is the blind
[18:40] leading the blind thank God we have eyes
[18:43] to see praise God thank God for the Holy
[18:45] Ghost I sound Amen I just thought I'd
[18:49] share that with you as a modern event
[18:50] made clear by prophecy so that shows the
[18:53] uniting and the binding of the tares
[18:55] perhaps that's the hour we're living in
[18:57] is the binding of the tares okay let's
[19:00] take a few prayer requests here
[19:02] my wife says please continue to pray for
[19:04] sister Brenda who had another stroke so
[19:06] Brenda is sick with that stroke another
[19:10] ones let's pray for her but Jose's wife
[19:14] needs to touch her eyes okay okay let's
[19:52] pray for her did the Lord touch your
[19:56] wife when we prayed for her at all okay
[19:58] wonderful I really felt like I was gonna
[20:00] answer amen praise the Lord amen I
[20:36] really thought God was gonna answer
[20:38] because I was such good service
[20:48] right praise the Lord
[20:58] God is so good a man that blessed in my
[21:01] heart will lift her up for the other
[21:03] needs to then thank you sir I was I was
[21:05] meaning to ask you I just can't forget
[21:07] oh that's so sweet
[21:10] by God's grace well I was just I really
[21:13] thought you know I thought man that was
[21:14] such an ordained day and thank you for
[21:17] bringing her brother I really appreciate
[21:18] that that means so much to me that you
[21:20] bring her in yeah amen amen
[21:26] and on top of that we have two other
[21:28] testimonies that last Wednesday you
[21:30] probably heard Erin and I shout and
[21:31] after the service he come up for prayer
[21:33] and he said he felt like something was
[21:35] squeezing his heart all day and he said
[21:37] instantly when I prayed for him he said
[21:39] all that left his heart that's why we
[21:41] were shouting over here so we can thank
[21:43] the Lord for that by God's grace I
[21:46] remember I was I was binding that that
[21:50] power and loosing him from it in Jesus
[21:53] name
[21:53] and then Tonia my wife said Tonya told
[21:55] my wife that was the same day we prayed
[21:58] for I'm sorry the day we prayed for your
[22:00] wife the morning we prayed for Tonya
[22:02] Tonya couldn't she said she told my wife
[22:05] she couldn't lift up her arm just to do
[22:07] her job she couldn't lift up her arm and
[22:08] she told my wife on Sunday that God
[22:10] healed her of that after we prayed for
[22:12] her and then she said now that but her
[22:14] ribs were in a lot of pain and God took

[35:26] conference and a couple brothers to
[35:30] interpret and lead songs and everything
[35:32] and the brother asked me to preach
[35:34] Friday night and then brother Brooks
[35:36] preached Saturday morning Saturday night
[35:37] then I preached Sunday morning then we
[35:39] went back to New York into the Bronx to
[35:42] their church and I preached there as
[35:44] well so I preached three out of five
[35:45] services so I'm awfully worn out I'm
[35:47] kind of sore right here but it was good
[35:51] and it was wonderful I didn't get any uh
[35:54] you know individual testimonies but the
[35:58] Friday the Friday night I preached on
[36:00] the waters of separation and there's
[36:02] about a hundred women with their hands
[36:03] raised
[36:04] crying repenting of dead stuff in their
[36:06] homes so it's a real blessing I hadn't
[36:10] seen that many repent in a while that's
[36:12] been a good and then Sunday morning I
[36:15] preached on God's purpose for a woman
[36:16] and just kind of preached that Lia
[36:17] message I preached and Mary Magdalene
[36:20] and I kind of use different example
[36:21] from the scripture and sisters were
[36:24] blessed and it was a really good time
[36:26] then I preached binding and loosing
[36:29] Sunday night that same sermon I preached
[36:31] here about binding and loosing the devil
[36:32] and they were really blessed there but
[36:35] the Vaughn said it discerned his church
[36:37] there and there's numerous people that
[36:38] came up for prayer so I hope to hear
[36:40] some testimonies from that but God was
[36:43] really moving it was a real sincere
[36:44] group and just a wonderful time in the
[36:47] Lord but we're happy to be home by God's
[36:49] grace revelation 6 we'll just read the
[36:52] 1st and 2nd verse verse 1 and I saw when
[36:55] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[36:58] heard as it were the noise of thunder
[36:59] one of the four beasts saying come and
[37:02] see and I saw and behold a white horse
[37:06] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[37:08] crown was given unto him and he went
[37:10] forth conquering and to conquer let's
[37:13] just bow our heads here and have another
[37:14] word of Prayer you ever need on your
[37:15] heart just making known unto God
[37:17] Heavenly Father we just come into your
[37:20] presence again lord thank you for
[37:21] amazing grace worthy is a lamb that was
[37:24] slain o God you're worthy tonight of our
[37:26] worship our time this investment of our
[37:29] energy and our attention Jesus speak to
[37:32] us Lord we see you moving among us move
[37:34] continually in power Lord move amongst
[37:37] us by your Holy Spirit we humble
[37:39] ourselves we realize we're nothing your
[37:41] everything may we exalt you may we
[37:43] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[37:45] that you might be glorified amongst us
[37:47] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[37:49] said Amen god bless yous being seated
[37:52] praise the Lord hallelujah so we're
[37:59] happy to be here again and this is part
[38:01] 82 for those who keep in track I know it
[38:03] when he likes to keep track so part
[38:06] eighty two of the revelation series by
[38:09] the grace of the Lord I want to start
[38:11] off just by sharing a few quotes from
[38:13] brother Branham about what the the seals
[38:18] meant to him some of these you know it's
[38:23] been a little while maybe since you
[38:25] heard it maybe some of these maybe never
[38:26] heard I want to review a few of these so
[38:29] we can see what it meant
[38:30] brother ham was talking about what how
[38:32] Jack Moore was kind of baffled
[38:35] he said by the the message he said
[38:38] especially on some of the things that we
[38:40] hold a dear and believed that it came to
[38:42] us through the opening of the seven
[38:44] seals as we believe such as the serpent
[38:47] seed the eternal security the believers
[38:49] and so forth some of those messages we
[38:53] don't think this is hard but if you've
[38:55] got he said you've got to open your
[38:57] heart to truth amen
[38:59] so when we open our hearts to truth we
[39:01] can receive doctrines that maybe seemed
[39:03] hard before so in order to receive the
[39:06] seals bro man said you have to open your
[39:08] heart to them he says again in God's
[39:10] power to transform but since the opening
[39:13] of those seven seals of them angels just
[39:15] behind the mountain yonder this has
[39:18] become a new book it's the thing that's
[39:21] been hid is being revealed as God
[39:23] promised in revelation 10 he would do it
[39:25] and we are the privileged people that
[39:28] God has chosen of the earth that we
[39:30] might see and understand these things I
[39:33] chose you God chose me to reveal these
[39:37] things that were hidden the book God
[39:39] chose us amen and indicate it with the
[39:42] cloud we know the praise God the you
[39:44] those seven angels praise the Lord but a
[39:46] man said and I was returned to return
[39:48] back here to Jeffersonville and preached
[39:50] the seven seals and if I've ever said
[39:52] anything that was inspired it was that
[39:55] there were the angel Lord Metis the
[39:57] Bible become a new Bible there it opened
[40:00] up and revealed all the things that the
[40:01] Reformers and things had left out it was
[40:04] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[40:07] altogether new to us but perfectly
[40:11] exactly with the scripture that was the
[40:14] word which always was been I was so
[40:17] inspired and directed so the seals was
[40:21] the word that's always been here it's
[40:23] always the Reformers missed it this so
[40:26] that means all the other churches that
[40:27] have reformer messages like you know a
[40:30] Wesley's and Lutheran's and Catholics
[40:32] they're all they're all preaching
[40:34] sermons or messages that have holes in
[40:36] them I'm glad our message doesn't have
[40:38] any holes in it praise God
[40:40] we're not missing anything we're not
[40:42] lacking anything our message has the
[40:45] full gospel in it we're not lacking
[40:47] anything it's the
[40:49] restored word and it became a new Bible
[40:51] too brother Brett amen now here's the
[40:56] here's the court I was looking for a one
[41:00] time the Feast of the trumpets I think I
[41:01] read this one time because someone said
[41:03] brother Branham will them seven seals
[41:05] then that'll be revealing the last day
[41:07] some great mystery on how we get closer
[41:09] to God but man said no sir it can't be
[41:12] because whosoever shall take one word
[41:13] from the Bible and add one word to it
[41:15] his part will be taken from the book of
[41:17] life what it is is a revelation on what
[41:20] has been missed back there to bring -
[41:23] it's already wrote here it's in here the
[41:26] Bible it's to reveal what's already been
[41:28] written because you can't add one thing
[41:30] or you can't take one word from the
[41:33] Bible amen hallelujah then he says this
[41:37] he says this is the complete revelation
[41:39] of Jesus Christ
[41:40] and the seven seals had the mysteries
[41:42] hit of what it all was and it's supposed
[41:45] to open it in the last day at the layers
[41:48] in church age at the end time thanks be
[41:50] to God that finishes the message to the
[41:52] church that finishes it when they look
[41:55] back and see what has been and see where
[41:57] it's all brought up that finishes it to
[42:00] the age of the church hallelujah so our
[42:04] message is finished when brother Branham
[42:06] finished preaching his message we know
[42:07] that brother a also said this he said
[42:11] about the seals he said I want you to
[42:14] check my revelation he says oh how I got
[42:17] a message I'll be going along and
[42:18] something strikes me and if I know it's
[42:21] God I'll take it over and find it in the
[42:23] scripture how do we know your message is
[42:26] from God it's found in the scripture
[42:28] program says then it's never failed but
[42:31] from Genesis to Revelation runs true no
[42:33] matter what people think about it it's
[42:35] been more so ever since those seven
[42:38] seals that did it that time he says so
[42:42] the seven seals open it and made more
[42:44] revelation more as time goes on and
[42:46] that's what I'm finding I'm fighting a
[42:48] Zyra study more and read more and I'm
[42:51] finding - as I write these books I'm
[42:53] kind of in the process of writing two
[42:54] books I'm fine as I meditate on these
[42:58] scriptures they just start opening more
[43:00] and more
[43:02] so that's her brother BAM fired he said
[43:04] Mauro so ever since he sees he's opening
[43:08] now I want to read another thing here
[43:12] too if I can by God's grace let me read
[43:15] this I have some more quotes I want to
[43:18] share here in the first seal brother
[43:22] Branham said I hope the people are
[43:24] spiritual are your spiritual tonight
[43:26] you're trying to turn you away from that
[43:28] tiredness and shake yourself maybe slap
[43:30] your arm a little bit and I know I got
[43:32] to slap my arm a little tired from work
[43:34] you know he says I would have had a
[43:37] horrible mistake on that first seal if
[43:39] it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today
[43:41] when the Holy Spirit came in the room
[43:44] and corrected me on something I was
[43:46] writing down to say Amen don't you love
[43:49] that when the Holy Spirit sweeps into
[43:50] your life and you're about to make the
[43:52] wrong decision or about to say the wrong
[43:54] thing but then the Holy Spirit sweeps in
[43:56] and he changes the course ha ha ha amen
[43:59] God did that for brother Branham he said
[44:04] yes there's about 12 o'clock the Holy
[44:05] Spirit swept down the room and the whole
[44:07] thing just opened up to me there it was
[44:09] the first seal being open he said the
[44:11] same thing in the second seal he said I
[44:13] tell you today something happen again
[44:15] today the first thing you know something
[44:18] just happens all together it's different
[44:20] it just comes in different then I grab a
[44:22] pencil right quick and start writing
[44:23] just as fast Amala as I can while he's
[44:26] there amen
[44:28] so each time brother man preach the
[44:30] seals the Holy Spirit would sweep into
[44:32] the room and he'd see visions and you
[44:35] have to write it down while the angel
[44:37] the Lord is there he says it again in
[44:39] the third seal he said I want to see
[44:41] this each time even this morning I got
[44:43] up real early and just go to prayer
[44:45] before things there and just keep
[44:47] praying throughout the day this morning
[44:49] early the Holy Spirit came to where I
[44:51] was just as plain as anything and I seen
[44:55] this other seal open up just exactly and
[44:58] that beautiful now we get to hear this
[45:00] sermon open up but brother Branham got
[45:02] to see the sermon open up he saw the
[45:06] seals broken he saw the horses ride out
[45:09] and heard what the Holy Spirit called
[45:11] him he saw we didn't have the privilege
[45:13] to see it but we do have
[45:15] the privilege to hear it praise God
[45:16] thank God for that
[45:18] the RAM said in the third series said
[45:21] when it revealed to me early this
[45:22] morning before daylight then I went
[45:24] click quickly to the scripture and begin
[45:27] to look and search it up that's a real
[45:29] prophet amen that's that's that proves
[45:32] you and I are real Christians if God
[45:33] ever reveals anything to us we got to
[45:36] make sure it's found right in the holy
[45:37] pages of this Bible aim ahead in the
[45:40] fourth seal brother Barrow said I'm so
[45:42] happy I just thought this one wouldn't
[45:44] come but it finally did he thought it
[45:48] when is it gonna come when is he gonna
[45:49] come it finally came he says praise the
[45:53] Lord and he says when it goes to
[45:57] breaking forth like that I just pick up
[46:00] my pen and start riding and stay just
[46:02] there maybe for hours until it gets
[46:05] finished ours envisions before it gets
[46:08] finished now I got a setting on my phone
[46:10] I'm sorry my watch and it buzzes me
[46:12] every time I need to stand up every hour
[46:14] it won't let me sit hours but brother
[46:17] Branham didn't have that and he could
[46:19] sit there for hours and the Holy Spirit
[46:22] would just show him things and write
[46:23] down as he saw an hour after hour
[46:26] because he was an obedient prophet he
[46:29] was a faithful man of God he sat and
[46:31] waited upon the Lord and he heard what
[46:33] God said and he gave it out to you and I
[46:36] glory he say there for hours until the
[46:39] vision finished and then he said he said
[46:44] then I got my concordance and I go back
[46:47] and here it is right here and here it is
[46:49] over again here here it is down here and
[46:51] over there then I just hide together I
[46:53] know that's God as long as it's
[46:55] comparing Scripture with Scripture
[46:57] that's the way it has to do just like
[47:00] putting a building together the stones
[47:02] have to fit stone by stone sober man
[47:05] knew the visions were right when he
[47:07] could pile Scripture upon Scripture upon
[47:10] scripture upon Scripture that's how he
[47:12] knew they were right because they
[47:13] pointed back to the Word of God in the
[47:16] fifth seal brother Graham said I want to
[47:17] give thanks to him who's I'm the present
[47:20] that came today not knowing one thing
[47:23] about the fifth seal but came in that
[47:25] same mysterious way this morning just
[47:27] about an hour before
[47:28] they break that when I was out in prayer
[47:33] alright now the next one he says in the
[47:35] fifth seal and he said here's the
[47:38] revelation according to the revelation
[47:41] that the Lord Jesus gave me today this
[47:42] morning early
[47:45] now here's what he says in the fifth see
[47:47] who said them revelations listen in the
[47:50] presence of that ball of fire the
[47:52] picture of ball of fire but man said
[47:55] that morning he saw a ball of fire
[47:58] hanging there in the room oh brother
[48:00] I've seen it since a child but every
[48:02] time it comes near to me it alarms me he
[48:05] almost puts me in an unconscious
[48:06] condition you never get used to it you
[48:09] can't it's too sacred amen that's why
[48:12] the Christian can never get too tired of
[48:14] coming to church here amen because the
[48:17] Holy Spirit visits us you might not see
[48:19] the pillar of fire you might not see a
[48:21] ball of fire but when we feel that
[48:23] sacred presence and we know he's here we
[48:25] never get used to it it's always fresh
[48:27] it's always new and that's what we live
[48:29] for amen that's why we don't get bored
[48:32] coming to church or we don't get
[48:33] discouraged like well I wonder if I
[48:35] should go to church who was it that who
[48:38] was it that touch brother Aaron when we
[48:39] prayed for him last Wednesday that was
[48:41] the pillar of fire
[48:42] who was that healed us sister Tanya that
[48:46] was the pillar of fire who here in
[48:48] Jose's wife that was that same ball of
[48:50] fire amen
[48:51] and it's too sacred you don't get used
[48:53] to it that's why you keep getting drawn
[48:56] back to God's presence amen
[48:58] that doesn't get boring to me that just
[48:59] actually stimulates me amen I know it
[49:02] does you too
[49:03] you never get used to it it's so sacred
[49:06] the presence of God also the fifth seal
[49:10] brother have said I saw he said when he
[49:12] saw the fifth seal let me I read it here
[49:16] he said I seen Elijah walk out there for
[49:18] that first age by himself so brother Ham
[49:21] saw Elijah walk out for the Gentiles he
[49:23] was all alone and then when he saw the
[49:25] sixth seal he saw Moses and Elijah walk
[49:28] out that's how he knew Elijah came five
[49:31] times not for other because he saw the
[49:34] vision I see Elijah coming to finish the
[49:37] Gentiles and then I see Moses and Elijah
[49:40] stepping out to the 104
[49:42] 4,000 and how did he know that because
[49:44] God showed him God reveals his mysteries
[49:47] to his servants the prophets amen
[49:49] by vision now let me go to the sixth
[49:57] seal he says this he said this is my
[50:00] seventh day in a room without light just
[50:02] electric light setting and praying for
[50:04] God to open these seals he says
[50:06] something happened today when this seal
[50:07] was revealed - I had to walk out and
[50:09] completely out in the yard just walk
[50:11] around out in the yard a little while it
[50:14] just simply almost took my breath why
[50:16] right away from me
[50:18] so he had such a revelation the sixth
[50:20] seal he had to walk out members in
[50:22] Matthew chapter 24 remember that six
[50:24] seals are in Matthew chapter 24 we won't
[50:27] get to that tonight but maybe later it
[50:29] was so powerful he had to leave the room
[50:32] and walk out from the presence of God
[50:33] because it was so powerful just that he
[50:36] said just to feel human again my god
[50:39] help us but we have said of all the
[50:43] times I've been behind the pulpit at the
[50:45] tabernacle I've never never in any time
[50:48] in my ministry ever worked into the
[50:50] realms of God and the spiritual realms
[50:53] as it's been this time memory seen a
[50:57] hundred a hundred thousand people give
[50:58] their lives to Christ in durban remember
[51:00] that or is it three hundred thousand I
[51:01] don't know which one it was and he and
[51:04] the blind man received his sight all
[51:06] these things he'd seen all these things
[51:07] but he said I've never worked into the
[51:10] realm of Revelation in any service more
[51:13] than in the service of the seven seals
[51:15] it's beyond anything I ever did at any
[51:18] time of my ministry he says that any
[51:22] meaning at anywhere like this mostly out
[51:25] there it's on healing this is revealing
[51:28] of truth by the same spirit Amen
[51:30] Alleluia
[51:33] he said the human mind can only stand so
[51:35] much and when you get to a spot where
[51:38] you set an hour numbed with the presence
[51:40] of God and the pillar of light hanging
[51:42] there before you you can't say they're
[51:44] too long the human being can't stand it
[51:46] he says right so is everybody
[51:52] understand here this was now these
[51:54] services brother man preached on the
[51:55] seven seals were not average sermons
[51:57] these were not as regular healing
[51:59] campaigns where he just fasted on Friday
[52:01] a little lunch on Saturday you know
[52:03] preach on Sunday like he says it wasn't
[52:06] average like that it was every day God
[52:08] would sweep in the room and make him
[52:10] numb and he would sit there and try to
[52:12] write down and and he said when the
[52:14] angel would leave me write down he spent
[52:16] the rest of the day searching out
[52:17] concordance is to make sure everything
[52:20] that was preached was right in the Bible
[52:22] because brother Adam believed what Paul
[52:25] said Paul said though we or an angel
[52:28] anything different let him be cursed so
[52:31] brother that fruit man was a real
[52:33] prophet he said even if a danger comes
[52:35] I'm gonna make sure his word lines up
[52:37] with God's Word amen because my friend
[52:40] said God's absolute is his word amen
[52:43] that's God's absolute hallelujah now
[52:46] let's go to the first seal here let's
[52:48] start looking at the first seal I want
[52:49] to I want to review a few these here by
[52:54] God's grace we'll just see how far we
[52:55] can get tonight now also I want to pull
[53:02] this quote up brothers you remember when
[53:05] we were in Jeffersonville you remember
[53:07] that brother said that he listened to
[53:11] the mighty concur and he never heard
[53:13] brother random say that the White Horse
[53:14] rider was the Holy Ghost you remember
[53:16] when he said that it's okay if you
[53:19] didn't yes yes and that's where it was
[53:30] because I found it so anyways we were
[53:34] Jeffersonville and we were saying how
[53:37] there's some you know brother man I met
[53:38] brother Brian had further revelations
[53:41] but member they believe every word is
[53:43] thus saith the Lord so they they can't
[53:45] really deal with doctrines that change
[53:46] they can't deal with that because they
[53:49] believe every word as I say the Lord and
[53:50] God doesn't change so the one brothers I
[53:53] listen to brother and preach the mighty
[53:54] conquer and I never heard him call the
[53:57] White Horse writer the Holy Ghost
[53:59] now he's right it wasn't in mighty
[54:01] conquer it was in another sermon and
[54:03] that's what I forgot about
[54:05] and I didn't think to pull it up you
[54:07] know it just wasn't on my mind but I
[54:09] have those quotes and I want to make
[54:10] sure we go through those tonight by
[54:13] God's grace so you can see it so let me
[54:16] pull it up here real quick okay there's
[54:17] all right it was in the Patmos vision
[54:20] 1960 and the ten virgins and 144,000
[54:23] look at you whether you like a computer
[54:25] you're like a message concordance so
[54:33] that means it's been written on your
[54:34] heart no kidding oh well that's a
[54:43] vindication there's another witness
[54:45] I just felt let allured to preach that
[54:46] today though I need I think I need to
[54:48] start digging back to the revelation
[54:49] series thank you I was in the closet
[54:52] praying this morning I thought I better
[54:53] go back I feel led to go back to the
[54:55] revelation amen so let's read that again
[54:58] revelation 6:1 and to the hos day I just
[55:03] feel like you were just tied together
[55:04] like for eternity or something you know
[55:06] weird all of us you know God put us all
[55:09] here we're all tied together Akron it's
[55:11] just it's all of us for eternity God had
[55:14] to serve together we're just all gonna
[55:17] be together amen revelation 6:1 and 2
[55:20] now we read this for our text now you
[55:22] know the symbols but let's let's look at
[55:25] these again just to kind of refresh our
[55:26] minds I saw when the lamb opened one of
[55:29] the seals and I heard as it were the
[55:31] noise of thunder one of the four beasts
[55:32] saying come and see and I saw him behold
[55:34] a white horse and he that sat on him had
[55:36] a bow and a crown was given unto him and
[55:38] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[55:42] now first of all in verse one notice
[55:46] who's opening the seal who over who
[55:47] opens a seal the lamb and this is the
[55:50] first revelation brother Branham gives
[55:51] the lamb is opening the book so picture
[55:54] the Lambs opening the book and then a
[55:56] white horse rider goes out the first
[55:59] revelation romance says is that white
[56:01] horse rider can't be Christ because
[56:03] Christ is opening the word and Christ is
[56:07] not two persons you can't have Christ
[56:08] ending there in a body and then another
[56:11] then he then he's riding a horse at the
[56:12] same time he's not - he's one amen
[56:17] glory I love that
[56:20] he said next the noise of a thunder so
[56:24] at every time a seal breaks a thunder
[56:26] thunder speaks that's why we believe the
[56:30] seven thunders are each individual
[56:32] revelation of the seven seals because
[56:35] here the first seals broken and then a
[56:38] thunder goes so every Co had a thunder
[56:41] behind it it was the voice of God amen
[56:43] that was going to tell the revelation of
[56:46] it and notice one of the four beasts say
[56:49] come and see
[56:49] chabela and said see that beast that
[56:52] beast is the lion beast right the lion
[56:55] beast comes forth and he declares what
[56:57] this is now
[57:00] the lion beast is the anointing for the
[57:03] true church brother Branham called it
[57:05] the Living Word or the Word made
[57:07] manifest in the holy spirit hallelujah
[57:10] now this white horse rider brother
[57:13] Branham says he said it's not the is he
[57:17] said it's not the early church brother
[57:18] BAM said this is the Antichrist spirit
[57:21] he said in deceptive innocence or
[57:24] deception it's false teaching it's false
[57:27] ministry and the horse represents a
[57:30] spiritual power now let me read you the
[57:33] quotes that brother was right it wasn't
[57:36] in mighty conquer brother Branham
[57:37] preached mighty Conqueror four times and
[57:39] every time he preached it this was his
[57:41] text but in all four serpents he never
[57:44] mentions this white horse rider in any
[57:47] of them cuz I looked I looked hard I
[57:49] typed in white I typed in horse I typed
[57:51] in writer I typed in all these things
[57:53] never one time run around using the text
[57:55] four times but he never even preaches on
[57:57] the white horse rider until December 4th
[58:01] 1964 other random reads about the White
[58:04] Horse in Revelation 19 I mean no there's
[58:06] a humming oh there's a white horse rider
[58:08] in Revelation 19 that is the real white
[58:11] horse rider this why or stridor is an
[58:14] imposter is Satan Superman brother
[58:16] Branham says but the real white horse
[58:18] rider is revelation 19 now brother
[58:22] random reads about a vesture dipped in
[58:24] blood when Jesus comes back riding a
[58:27] white horse
[58:27] brother Han reads that scripture and
[58:29] liquid he says what went out of his
[58:31] mouth the white horse rider and
[58:33] revelation he said seven I believe eight
[58:36] which was actually six he says and the
[58:39] why or she said no at six when the white
[58:41] horse rider went forth he was given a
[58:43] bow to conquer to conquer and a sword
[58:45] went out of his mouth what was he the
[58:47] white horse rider of Revelation notice
[58:49] the sword so brother man calls the horse
[58:55] rider program calls it the same right
[58:58] horse rider of Revelation 19 so in 1960
[59:01] brother have said these two white horse
[59:03] riders are the same person
[59:05] amen and then seven days later when he
[59:10] preached the ten version the 144,000
[59:12] brother Graham said then come the pale
[59:15] horse death and hell found it and each
[59:18] one of those riders are the horses now
[59:20] after these things after this great
[59:22] destruction now listen first went forth
[59:24] was the Holy Ghost across the earth
[59:27] conquering and to conquer so program
[59:31] literally says that the first horse
[59:33] rider was the Holy Ghost going forward
[59:36] to conquer and conquer and three years
[59:38] later he's going to preach that again
[59:39] and the Holy Spirit said that's not it
[59:41] he said that's not me it's the
[59:43] Antichrist amen you see the hatpin that
[59:48] powerful
[59:49] now what's striking is this this is how
[59:52] merciful God is brother Branham preaches
[59:54] in December of 1960 as part of the seven
[59:57] church sermons one month orbs are one
[1:00:00] month later when he preached revelation
[1:00:02] chapter four the Holy Ghost came down
[1:00:04] there in the back of the tabernacle and
[1:00:06] vindicated the seven churches and he
[1:00:09] even made the mistake how merciful see
[1:00:11] God was merciful because God knew he was
[1:00:13] going to correct him about three years
[1:00:14] later Amen God looked at the Bible said
[1:00:18] got a wink at your ignorance but once he
[1:00:21] shows it to you there's no more
[1:00:22] ignorance you've got to obey what he
[1:00:23] tells us amen
[1:00:25] that's why you know if you knew it was
[1:00:27] wrong to drink before the message or I'm
[1:00:28] sorry you didn't know is God a link at
[1:00:30] that but now that you know the
[1:00:32] difference God won't wink at that you
[1:00:34] have to repent amen hallelujah so those
[1:00:38] are the two quotes thank you brother
[1:00:39] Jose the Patmos vision and then the ten
[1:00:43] versions of 144,000 so brother random
[1:00:46] did
[1:00:47] he did teach that that the white horse
[1:00:49] rider was the holy ghost and God himself
[1:00:51] a ball of fire corrects you and if a
[1:00:54] ball of fire corrects you and it lines
[1:00:56] up with the word we better stay with
[1:00:57] that ball fire amen and the Word of God
[1:01:00] it's exactly right so brother and said
[1:01:04] this is the false teaching this white
[1:01:06] horse rider of course is the antichrist
[1:01:09] spirit Abraham said he was riding in his
[1:01:13] teaching ministry so we got to be real
[1:01:16] careful with teachers don't we gotta be
[1:01:19] careful what someone's teaching you
[1:01:20] about the Word of God like we preach
[1:01:23] last Wednesday night on doctrine
[1:01:25] doctrines good and it's necessary you
[1:01:27] can't get the Holy Ghost without
[1:01:28] doctrine but make sure that doctrine
[1:01:30] doesn't lead you outside the Word of God
[1:01:32] because that's how we see Satan moving
[1:01:35] today he's using teachers of the message
[1:01:37] to say well brother hams wrong programs
[1:01:38] wrong not a prophet not a prophet let's
[1:01:40] leave the message and when they do that
[1:01:42] they leave the but of Christ because the
[1:01:44] blood of Christ is upon this word today
[1:01:46] amen exactly right now here's the
[1:01:52] symbols who is he but RAM said it's the
[1:01:55] Antichrist spirit and he's killing my
[1:01:57] spirit he said a spiritual kill by
[1:02:01] giving them false doctrine when you wave
[1:02:03] if you receive a false doctrine it'll
[1:02:05] kill your spiritual life that's why I'm
[1:02:07] so glad to be alive
[1:02:08] and feel alive I don't feel dead in
[1:02:10] Christ I feel alive in Christ because we
[1:02:12] only believe true doctrine amen we don't
[1:02:15] add to the word we don't take away from
[1:02:17] the word we just believe the word what
[1:02:20] is the bow now brother him preach this
[1:02:22] but the Bible says the bow is a lie
[1:02:25] let's go to Jeremiah 9 3 and this ties
[1:02:28] in perfectly with what brother Branham
[1:02:30] preached so go to Jeremiah 9 3 Jeremiah
[1:02:35] 9 3 because
[1:02:40] Braham said he was spreading lies with
[1:02:42] its false doctrine jeremiah 9 3 oh you
[1:02:45] got it you're faster than me and they
[1:02:47] bend their tongues like their bow for
[1:02:50] lies but they're not valiant for the
[1:02:54] truth upon the earth for they proceed
[1:02:56] from evil to evil and they know not me
[1:02:58] saith the Lord
[1:02:59] what bow do they have their bow is their
[1:03:01] mouth and they shoot out lies amen and
[1:03:05] notice motives that he has a bow but no
[1:03:08] arrows he that means he's a bluffer he's
[1:03:13] pretentious that he's got thunder but no
[1:03:14] lightning but well then my brother said
[1:03:18] Christ has both thunder and lightning
[1:03:20] and weathers of that is that his throne
[1:03:22] in Revelation chapter four and five may
[1:03:25] remember lightnings and thunders proceed
[1:03:27] out of the road but this riders just got
[1:03:30] a bow and no arrows but Jesus Christ has
[1:03:33] a bow and arrows he's got a sword
[1:03:35] he's got lightning and thunder that's
[1:03:37] our mighty Conqueror amen glory oh my
[1:03:41] that's a powerful revelation hallelujah
[1:03:46] and then he says a crown was given unto
[1:03:50] him and brother have said this is a
[1:03:53] literal crowd that was given to the
[1:03:55] rider after he became incarnate in the
[1:03:58] Pope or the false prophet so that's what
[1:04:04] the crowd represents the crown that they
[1:04:06] gave to the literal Pope remember Church
[1:04:11] do you men were night a few about a
[1:04:13] month ago when we had church on
[1:04:14] Wednesday night at my house I read with
[1:04:16] what the Catholic Church has meant foes
[1:04:18] of doing in Pennsylvania I remember that
[1:04:19] the Pope never apologized
[1:04:22] he's still not apologized you already
[1:04:24] said no comment a thousand reports on
[1:04:28] priests molesting men and women and
[1:04:32] audre abortions and all this evil and
[1:04:34] the Pope says no comment that's because
[1:04:36] he's got an antichrist spirit
[1:04:39] how could anyone anywhere with natural
[1:04:42] affections would cry out against that
[1:04:44] but because he doesn't have natural
[1:04:46] affections because he and all their
[1:04:48] leadership have the wrong spirit they
[1:04:51] don't cry out against it they don't even
[1:04:53] remove these people
[1:04:54] from office it takes the government to
[1:04:56] remove them from office
[1:04:57] that's how evil it is and so it proves
[1:05:01] they're filled with all hateful and
[1:05:04] wicked things and no matter how glorious
[1:05:08] they may look to the the public no
[1:05:09] matter how beautiful the churches and
[1:05:11] how many people get married to them
[1:05:13] they're only full of demon powers amen
[1:05:16] it's exactly right I don't care what
[1:05:19] crime they wear I don't care what how
[1:05:21] beautiful their churches are this church
[1:05:22] is much more beautiful than theirs we
[1:05:25] might not have stained-glass windows but
[1:05:27] we're going to be walking on streets of
[1:05:29] glass just like gold amen
[1:05:30] how the hell we got the promise of that
[1:05:33] transparent glass hey man I don't want
[1:05:35] it here I want it there praise God amen
[1:05:41] and conquering but men have said what
[1:05:44] are they conquering he said they're
[1:05:46] conquering the land T that's why I
[1:05:48] appreciate your faith to come up for
[1:05:50] prayer that shows you're not being
[1:05:51] conquered when you got faith to receive
[1:05:52] prayers when you got faith to be healed
[1:05:55] or you got faith to receive a prayer
[1:05:57] that shows you're not being conquered
[1:05:58] you're led by the Holy Spirit the Spirit
[1:06:01] of God is leading me up to join another
[1:06:04] person's faith to pray together and
[1:06:06] remove those to bind the demon and cast
[1:06:09] out the demon to loose the person from
[1:06:11] the demon what is it it's everybody
[1:06:13] should have an anointing of the Holy
[1:06:14] Spirit that's exactly right
[1:06:17] amen now actually you know what I do
[1:06:23] have something to show here the Malachi
[1:06:25] Cain useless I didn't think I'd do this
[1:06:27] but maybe I'll do this I forgot this was
[1:06:32] from the old notes I had from a few
[1:06:33] years ago program talked about the
[1:06:35] Triple Crown and I forgot I did this
[1:06:38] this was on a website a Catholic website
[1:06:43] and I just went and I looked at the lira
[1:06:45] the letters these are all the letters
[1:06:48] that our own programs brother Brad said
[1:06:49] he saw this the Triple Crown I don't
[1:06:51] know if it was the same one but this is
[1:06:53] certainly a Triple Crown and it has all
[1:06:56] these titles on it well I went and
[1:06:57] studied that out I did the I did the
[1:06:59] translation and I got it from there they
[1:07:02] did the translation the complete
[1:07:04] inscription on this crown is is this it
[1:07:06] means to the infallible
[1:07:08] of Jesus Christ to the Supreme Governor
[1:07:11] of the world on earth to the father of
[1:07:13] Nations and kings it has the Pope's
[1:07:17] crown my that's just a bunch of nonsense
[1:07:20] I just a bunch of Lies those are the
[1:07:25] words look at those words they're the
[1:07:28] words you can look them up on Google
[1:07:29] Translate if you want I use that all the
[1:07:32] times I have a girl my class who speaks
[1:07:33] she's from Colombia I always say the
[1:07:37] wrong country s I got to speak to her in
[1:07:40] Spanish I use hey Siri how do you say
[1:07:42] raise your hand in Spanish oh there goes
[1:07:46] there goes sorry didn't mean that Siri
[1:07:51] [Laughter]
[1:07:52] they're always listening aren't they but
[1:07:56] the point is this is what they call
[1:07:59] their leader and he won't speak out
[1:08:02] against molestation I wonder how many
[1:08:05] people he's molested I don't know or how
[1:08:08] many of his friends he's molested I
[1:08:10] don't know but when they do this they
[1:08:13] blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:15] that's right
[1:08:16] giving infallibility to a man who's
[1:08:20] Supreme Governor of the earth only
[1:08:22] Christ is the king of the earth amen
[1:08:24] they're stealing the the titles for God
[1:08:29] which is blasphemy they blast him in his
[1:08:31] name that's right I think I'll just
[1:08:34] preach off these I I pulled these up
[1:08:35] okay that's the first sales everybody
[1:08:37] okay with the first seal I think I'll
[1:08:39] probably to the first four seals tonight
[1:08:41] this is an old I found this old
[1:08:43] PowerPoint from you know eight years ago
[1:08:45] I thought well let me rehearse it I'll
[1:08:47] just go fast with the church because
[1:08:49] most y'all didn't see this
[1:08:50] I think only my wife saw this yeah I
[1:08:53] think I think my only my wife saw this
[1:08:54] in 2010 maybe Lydia if she remembers
[1:08:58] there has been a long time ago you know
[1:09:00] remember oh sure you do now the second
[1:09:04] seal second seal revelation 6 and when
[1:09:12] you open the second seal I heard the
[1:09:13] second beast say come and see so second
[1:09:15] the first one was the the line second
[1:09:17] one is the calf or the Ox we'd say
[1:09:21] and there went out another horse that
[1:09:22] was red and power was given to him that
[1:09:25] sat thereon to take peace from the earth
[1:09:26] and that they should kill one another
[1:09:28] and there she was given unto him a great
[1:09:30] sword all right let me make sure I got
[1:09:34] everything I want to say about that okay
[1:09:36] I do
[1:09:39] so the Ox like beasts from Revelation 4
[1:09:43] 7 is the anointing for the true
[1:09:45] Christians he's a beast of sacrifice and
[1:09:47] gave their lives just as freely as they
[1:09:50] could give them in that age the red
[1:09:52] represents a bloody red program said
[1:09:54] quote they're waiting they were waiting
[1:09:57] through the blood of everybody that
[1:09:58] disagrees with them and of course the
[1:10:01] horse is a spiritual power my power was
[1:10:07] given to him to take peace from the
[1:10:08] earth and they should kill one another
[1:10:10] but RAM said this is the unity of church
[1:10:12] and the state grants power eventually
[1:10:15] leads to the Crusades and other Wars the
[1:10:19] RAM said the great sword representing
[1:10:21] the murdering of 68 million plus
[1:10:23] Protestants by the Roman Catholic Church
[1:10:26] from the time of Saint Agustin of hippo
[1:10:28] until 1586
[1:10:30] kills by sword political power when
[1:10:33] church and state United now I read I
[1:10:37] haven't heard this with the Pennsylvania
[1:10:39] the cases they have at least a one death
[1:10:42] from all this abuse one of the boys was
[1:10:44] so badly abused by a man who would rape
[1:10:47] him a free so to rape him he would take
[1:10:48] pills for pain and he overdosed and died
[1:10:51] in his 20s because of the evil pains of
[1:10:55] that church and that was just an
[1:10:58] accidental death what about the
[1:11:00] purposeful ones the abortions that they
[1:11:02] admitted to they've admitted to having
[1:11:04] abortions because they've impregnated
[1:11:06] girls and all these things all these
[1:11:08] women have come forth all these
[1:11:09] abortions what comes out of this church
[1:11:11] death what comes out of the bride of
[1:11:13] Jesus Christ's life amen hallelujah I
[1:11:16] know it's off I know it's sad I know
[1:11:18] it's hard to say some those things but
[1:11:19] we have to call it like it is this is
[1:11:21] truth this is where God's Word is being
[1:11:23] preached and thank God that our eyes are
[1:11:25] open to see what's been left out all
[1:11:27] these years amen
[1:11:28] thank you lord Wow Ardi to the third one
[1:11:32] yeah okay
[1:11:33] third one let me read it
[1:11:35] when he opened the third seal I heard
[1:11:37] the third beast say come and see
[1:11:39] and I beheld and lo a black horse and he
[1:11:41] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[1:11:42] in his hand and I heard a voice in the
[1:11:45] midst of the four beasts saying a
[1:11:46] treasure
[1:11:46] I'm sorry measure of wheat for a penny
[1:11:48] and three measures of barley for a penny
[1:11:51] and see thou hurt not the oil and the
[1:11:53] line program said the third the Beast is
[1:11:56] a man-like beast the anointing for true
[1:11:59] Christians he said the wisdom of a man
[1:12:00] which was a power that went forth in the
[1:12:04] reformers the black represents the dark
[1:12:07] ages four was the time of midnight to
[1:12:10] the true believers that was left and the
[1:12:12] horse again is spiritual power
[1:12:15] how many premiere with that one by God's
[1:12:16] grace the pair of balances brother have
[1:12:19] said is when he saw Satan through the
[1:12:22] Catholic Church was capturing the wealth
[1:12:24] of the world and stripping his subjects
[1:12:26] of their money a voice in the midst of
[1:12:30] the beast it was the voice of Christ the
[1:12:32] lamb now back to this program said he
[1:12:35] walked through the Vatican remember
[1:12:37] brother said he went for an interview
[1:12:38] with the Pope and the man that was
[1:12:40] before that he said now you have to do a
[1:12:42] few things he said you're gonna have to
[1:12:44] call him father and brother banister
[1:12:46] that's fine I'll call any man Reverend
[1:12:47] I'm sorry not father Reverend I'll comb
[1:12:49] all these things he said then you got to
[1:12:51] bow down and kiss his ring
[1:12:52] he said that's out he said because all
[1:12:55] worship goes to my Savior Jesus Christ
[1:12:57] saying that he's not called man doctor
[1:12:59] I'll call him Reverend but all worship
[1:13:01] goes to Jesus Christ amen
[1:13:05] and there's pictures you can see on the
[1:13:06] internet just type in Pope being kissed
[1:13:09] kissing a ring and you'll see people
[1:13:10] bowing down and kiss him I never found
[1:13:12] Obama but I wanted to I always want to
[1:13:15] find a George W Bush you're a Donald
[1:13:17] Trump kissing his ring but I never did
[1:13:18] yet if you find one let me know
[1:13:20] I've got to make sure it's not
[1:13:21] photoshopped though because they usually
[1:13:24] like to photoshop them but never set a
[1:13:28] voice in the midst of the Beast and
[1:13:30] motives and this voice that cries out do
[1:13:33] not hurt the oil and the wine amen this
[1:13:37] brother said this is Christ saying and
[1:13:40] he says like this he says don't you make
[1:13:42] them do any novenas no don't make you
[1:13:45] don't make
[1:13:46] then do the many indulgences he said
[1:13:49] don't touch their spiritual faith he
[1:13:51] said don't don't let anyone touch their
[1:13:54] own wine in other words the devil can't
[1:13:56] touch the Holy Ghost if you've got it
[1:13:58] amen the devil can't make you fall away
[1:14:01] the devil can't make you lose your
[1:14:03] salvation because the Holy Ghost is the
[1:14:05] seal unto the day of the rapture amen
[1:14:08] he can't touch your oil he can't touch
[1:14:11] your wine see now we got to make sure
[1:14:13] the wine doesn't get touched because
[1:14:14] sometimes we lose our inspiration
[1:14:17] sometimes we lose our excitement about
[1:14:19] the word and the church said we got to
[1:14:23] make sure to Satan you can't touch my
[1:14:24] wife I'm gonna go to church and I'm
[1:14:26] gonna get stimulated by the revelation
[1:14:28] ain't n and if you feel like that you
[1:14:31] got to tell that to the devil you get
[1:14:32] off me get away from me I bind you get
[1:14:35] off me I bind you too and you must leave
[1:14:37] I want my wine back aim ahead because he
[1:14:40] cannot touch the oil and the wine
[1:14:43] exactly right now program said a measure
[1:14:47] wheat for a penny and three measures of
[1:14:49] barley for a penny
[1:14:50] Christ recognizes the rider charging for
[1:14:53] the natural staff of life brother
[1:14:56] Branham says and indulgences which is
[1:14:59] false spiritual hope all right now bro
[1:15:04] Graham said he went to the Vatican and
[1:15:06] he said after that interview he turned
[1:15:08] it down he said he went walking through
[1:15:10] the Vatican he said you couldn't buy
[1:15:11] that with a hundred million million
[1:15:13] dollars and I looked it up on the
[1:15:15] encyclopedia and it says that it says
[1:15:18] the Vatican's artworks are priceless
[1:15:20] you can value how prices there and I
[1:15:25] look at how Satan calls it the Eternal
[1:15:27] City and he makes it priceless in the
[1:15:30] natural what a perversion he's just
[1:15:32] trying to copy our home the New
[1:15:34] Jerusalem because our home is eternal
[1:15:37] amen you know it doesn't matter whether
[1:15:40] the devil calls it that or not it is
[1:15:42] eternal praise God and now and our home
[1:15:46] doesn't have earthly treasures it has
[1:15:49] spiritual treasures ha ha
[1:15:51] it has spiritual riches spiritual
[1:15:54] rewards that will never fade away of in
[1:15:57] the rural value and the most valuable is
[1:15:59] Jesus Christ himself
[1:16:01] amen hallelujah so see it's a perversion
[1:16:05] Satan perverting the New Jerusalem see
[1:16:08] by imitating it but in those days the
[1:16:15] Catholic Church had control I'm sorry
[1:16:17] the Kevin he's a good man that's Martin
[1:16:19] Luther the Catholic Church had control
[1:16:21] of the economy and also had controlled
[1:16:24] the government and so they could they
[1:16:26] could charge for food their control of
[1:16:29] everything because they own government
[1:16:30] church and state right the two horns
[1:16:32] ecclesiastical and civil civil civil
[1:16:35] powers they control both so they
[1:16:37] captured the wealth of the world the
[1:16:39] artwork they went on Crusades they
[1:16:41] captured all the wealth and all the
[1:16:43] money they killed anyone that argued
[1:16:45] against them and see thou hurt not the
[1:16:48] oil line Christ protects the oil the
[1:16:50] Holy Spirit and wine the stimulation of
[1:16:53] Revelation of the true believer amen all
[1:16:59] right now we're up to our day the fourth
[1:17:00] seal let me read it to you this is a
[1:17:02] little bit longer one here and when you
[1:17:06] open the fourth seal I heard the voice
[1:17:07] of the fourth beast saying come and see
[1:17:09] and I looked at me holding a pale horse
[1:17:11] and his name that sat on him was death
[1:17:12] and hell followed with him and power was
[1:17:16] given unto them over the fourth part of
[1:17:19] the earth to kill with the sword and
[1:17:21] with hunger and with death and with the
[1:17:23] beasts of the earth you can see that the
[1:17:26] Eagle like beasts is the anointing for
[1:17:28] us it's the revelation it's program says
[1:17:31] the promise in Revelation 10 7 praise
[1:17:34] God so the fact that we know the
[1:17:36] mysteries if we know the mysteries that
[1:17:38] live by the mysteries it's a proof we've
[1:17:40] got the eagle anointing amen the pail
[1:17:43] but as I said pail is red and white and
[1:17:46] so mixed together the three-in-one and
[1:17:49] he calls that the eternal separation
[1:17:52] from God so when someone is anointed
[1:17:54] with this pale horse riders spirit
[1:17:57] they're eternally separated from God
[1:17:59] because they're dead
[1:18:01] they've crossed the line between mercy
[1:18:03] and judgment and huh me know in that
[1:18:07] sermon huh me know in that sermon
[1:18:08] brother Branham said the Pentecostal
[1:18:10] church
[1:18:11] dead he said thus saith the Lord that's
[1:18:15] striking when he says a whole
[1:18:18] denomination a whole movement is dead
[1:18:21] thus saith the Lord it's true it struck
[1:18:23] the church and you can see it right you
[1:18:26] can see it on their church service if
[1:18:27] your friends go the Pentecostal Church
[1:18:29] you can see in their lives they're dead
[1:18:32] they're not on fire for the word of God
[1:18:33] it's not about the word anymore it's
[1:18:36] about tongue speaking or it's about
[1:18:38] prosperity or it's about a new building
[1:18:40] or something like that
[1:18:41] it's not about truly Christ the word all
[1:18:44] eyes should be about Christ the word we
[1:18:48] need more of the word god guide me in
[1:18:50] your word guide me in your path
[1:18:52] help me to be more like Jesus Christ not
[1:18:55] somebody's idea about Christ but Christ
[1:18:58] amen his name that sat on him was death
[1:19:01] program this is a quote god only knows
[1:19:04] how many he calls to spiritually die by
[1:19:06] his anti Bible teaching this is the one
[1:19:09] he put sixty-eight million of the sword
[1:19:11] and killed and probably billions died
[1:19:12] spiritually on his false teaching no
[1:19:15] wonder he takes the name death now do I
[1:19:21] have the quote here let me go back to
[1:19:25] this one here death brother Brahim said
[1:19:27] this this writer is the same writer the
[1:19:29] whole time but in the first three rise
[1:19:32] no one knew his name to the last ride
[1:19:34] and then in the last ride an eagle flew
[1:19:37] up really high a fly you could look down
[1:19:40] and say I know who this is
[1:19:41] he's rode the whole time that's death
[1:19:43] amen so see in the end time it took the
[1:19:46] Eagle anointing to identify what is this
[1:19:49] spirit in that in the organizations and
[1:19:52] programs said it was death did you know
[1:19:55] brother have said it was actually the
[1:19:56] preaching of the seven seals that showed
[1:19:58] him how evil organization was those
[1:20:01] quotes before the seals remoter have
[1:20:03] said it's okay if you're in an
[1:20:04] organization you should be in an
[1:20:05] organization and there's quotes after
[1:20:07] the seals where he balls it out you get
[1:20:09] out of organization don't put your name
[1:20:11] on their book their book won't get you
[1:20:13] to heaven your name must be on the
[1:20:14] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:15] because there's only lambs in the Lamb's
[1:20:17] Book of Life that means you and I are am
[1:20:19] say Mary is this the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:22] and only Lambs names
[1:20:24] in there hi there yeah thank you Jesus I
[1:20:26] want to be a Lamb of God so he could
[1:20:32] only get the you could only identify who
[1:20:35] is that Rider
[1:20:36] you could only know his name in this
[1:20:38] last age when the Eagles flying thank
[1:20:42] you Jesus and hell followed death
[1:20:45] Legrand said now he'll always follows
[1:20:47] death in the natural when unnatural man
[1:20:50] dies hell follows him
[1:20:51] that's the grave Hades that's the
[1:20:52] natural when the spiritual it's a lake
[1:20:54] of fire and the church said he'll always
[1:20:58] follows death all right and power was
[1:21:04] given unto him over over the fourth part
[1:21:07] of the earth to kill with sword and with
[1:21:09] hunger and with death and with the
[1:21:11] beasts of the earth well Adam said this
[1:21:12] is the last ride of the incarnate devil
[1:21:15] in the person of the Antichrist which
[1:21:17] fulfills those scriptures revelation 13
[1:21:20] about the mark of the beast and
[1:21:22] Revelation 16 but Ram said he's
[1:21:25] gathering his subjects to Armageddon in
[1:21:28] that interesting death is going to
[1:21:31] gather all the world unto Armageddon
[1:21:34] death is death is gathering all them to
[1:21:38] a place where they can all be gathered
[1:21:40] and then Jesus will come back after our
[1:21:42] wedding supper
[1:21:43] praise God he'll come back and they're
[1:21:46] all gathers sword can go out of his
[1:21:48] mouth and devour all of them death
[1:21:50] gathers them together see they're
[1:21:53] uniting they're uniting with governments
[1:21:55] they're uniting with the Vatican they're
[1:21:57] uniting with with sin but we're uniting
[1:22:00] with Jesus Christ were uniting with the
[1:22:03] Word of God were uniting with all
[1:22:05] message believers amen
[1:22:06] who really believe the message amen
[1:22:08] we're uniting with life they're uniting
[1:22:12] with death he's gathering his subjects
[1:22:15] for Armageddon
[1:22:16] I see Christ gathers us for Armageddon I
[1:22:18] don't know how to ride a horse right now
[1:22:19] but God's gonna give me that ability if
[1:22:21] I'm a real message believer
[1:22:23] I'll have that ability of when I get a
[1:22:25] new body I don't know right now but I'm
[1:22:29] promised if I've got the Holy Ghost I'll
[1:22:31] be riding a white horse amen somewhere
[1:22:34] at the back way at the back behind Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ I'll be waiting
[1:22:37] the back is on the lease of the
[1:22:39] Serpent's amen as long as I'm there I'll
[1:22:42] just be happy as a happy give me I just
[1:22:45] want to be there Church you just want to
[1:22:46] be there with Jesus amen
[1:22:49] now I think it's where I stopped the
[1:22:53] rest these are my new by memory so you
[1:22:54] can um you can unplug there because I
[1:22:57] think that's where I stopped on that one
[1:22:58] the rest is because I wrote it out right
[1:23:00] here here I'll take a few more minutes
[1:23:03] let me set a timer here I really got to
[1:23:05] watch my voice because that's been as
[1:23:07] I've been really tired three sermons and
[1:23:09] three days was really hard on me yeah
[1:23:12] the priest so loud and so hard help me
[1:23:14] Jesus let's look at the fifth seal here
[1:23:21] alright let me look at my notes here I
[1:23:22] wrote these down before service okay
[1:23:25] yeah the fifth seal was a great
[1:23:26] revelation of brother Branham he said
[1:23:29] because all these other teachers were
[1:23:30] teaching that souls go to sleep when
[1:23:33] they die I mean oh we're talking about
[1:23:35] some people like the Mormons they they
[1:23:37] believe when someone dies their soul
[1:23:39] actually sleeps and it has no contact
[1:23:42] with anyone else but that's a lie
[1:23:45] that's not true souls never sleep praise
[1:23:49] the Lord
[1:23:49] your body goes down and your body rut
[1:23:52] you know deteriorates and breaks down
[1:23:55] your body deteriorates but your soul if
[1:23:58] you're born again it'll never die my
[1:24:03] soul can't die because the giver of life
[1:24:05] is inside myself he quickened my he made
[1:24:09] my soul alive so it cannot die
[1:24:12] I always be alive amen hallelujah
[1:24:14] because Christ is in me the hope of
[1:24:17] glory amen
[1:24:20] remember remember jesus said you do err
[1:24:22] Pharisees not knowing the scriptures God
[1:24:26] is not the god of the dead God is the
[1:24:27] god of the living ain't ahead the God of
[1:24:30] Abraham Isaac and Jacob our God is the
[1:24:32] god of the living a hallelujah now the
[1:24:36] fifth seal it's a longer one two and
[1:24:42] when he opened the fifth seal I saw
[1:24:43] under the altar the souls of them that
[1:24:45] were slain for the word of God and for
[1:24:47] the testimony that held well Ram said
[1:24:49] who are these people but remember these
[1:24:51] this is not the early church martyrs but
[1:24:53] man said this is the martyred Jews and
[1:24:55] the way you know is because their slain
[1:24:58] for the word of God and for the
[1:25:00] testimony which they held they're not
[1:25:02] slain for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:25:04] because they don't have that testimony
[1:25:07] this says Jews the fifth seal is Jews
[1:25:11] now if you hold your spot revelation 1
[1:25:14] says this that's what I love about the
[1:25:18] seals program taught us that through the
[1:25:20] seals of the church ages the Bible
[1:25:22] interprets itself we don't need another
[1:25:24] book a book of Mormon or we don't need
[1:25:26] any other book to interpret the Bible
[1:25:27] the Bible has got enough information it
[1:25:29] interprets itself praise God amen now in
[1:25:35] Revelation 1:9 John says I was in the
[1:25:39] isle that's called Patmos for the word
[1:25:41] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:25:44] Christ
[1:25:45] how many are both testimonies I do I've
[1:25:49] got the testimony of the Word of God how
[1:25:50] many believe the Old Testament I believe
[1:25:52] the Word of God but I also have the
[1:25:55] testimony of Jesus Christ that the
[1:25:57] Messiah that they spoke up for those
[1:25:59] four thousand years they kept speaking
[1:26:01] of it me bruise the Serpent's head and
[1:26:03] and all need be born in Bethlehem and
[1:26:05] all these things ah
[1:26:06] we believe he's come and his name is
[1:26:08] Jesus Christ amen
[1:26:10] he's alive tonight hallelujah amen and
[1:26:15] that's that fish seal is there only
[1:26:19] slain for the word of God's sake not for
[1:26:23] the name of Jesus Christ but the word of
[1:26:25] God only verse 10 and they cried with a
[1:26:27] loud voice saying how long O Lord holy
[1:26:29] and true thus thou not judge and avenge
[1:26:32] our blood on them that dwell on the
[1:26:34] earth now brother man said this proves
[1:26:36] they're Jews because they're asking for
[1:26:39] vengeance they're asking for vengeance
[1:26:41] honey I've been reading Psalms I think
[1:26:43] I'm in Psalms 30 and David's crying out
[1:26:46] for vengeance all the time he's like God
[1:26:48] to kill my enemies put my enemies under
[1:26:51] my feet right he's a man who's not all
[1:26:56] the way born with the Holy Ghost right
[1:26:57] he's got the Holy Ghost on his body
[1:26:59] he's got the Holy Ghost in his mind but
[1:27:01] he's not quite born-again because he's
[1:27:03] asking for revenge you
[1:27:05] not to ask for revenge we're so say God
[1:27:07] you have revenge in your time we're
[1:27:10] supposed to ask for mercy upon our
[1:27:12] enemies amen
[1:27:14] now last Wednesday I preached out there
[1:27:17] there may times there may be times
[1:27:19] you're led of the Holy Spirit and you
[1:27:20] speak judgment on someone like Paul said
[1:27:23] Paul Cedric Paul said reward Alexander
[1:27:26] the coppersmith for the evil he did unto
[1:27:28] me and then two verses later he says
[1:27:31] have mercy on those that hurt him and
[1:27:33] left that forsook me so there may be
[1:27:36] times you speak the Word of God and
[1:27:38] anointed to speak judgment but generally
[1:27:41] for a Christian we speak mercy we speak
[1:27:44] forgiveness father they don't know what
[1:27:46] they're doing
[1:27:47] Lord lay it not to their charge amen
[1:27:50] remember Paul was so filled with the
[1:27:53] Holy Ghost he said I wish that I was a
[1:27:55] curse that my brethren could be saved
[1:27:57] now that's real Christianity right there
[1:28:00] or what I was Jesse Smith would be curse
[1:28:02] and go to hell just so that my friends
[1:28:03] could be saved that's that's real
[1:28:06] Christianity right there of course God
[1:28:08] won't let that happen but this proves
[1:28:10] that this is the Jew now this also
[1:28:13] proves we preach on this a few years ago
[1:28:15] brother Branham said at one place you're
[1:28:17] your human spirit breaks up when you die
[1:28:18] but this proves it actually doesn't now
[1:28:22] you could say this your spirit gets
[1:28:23] renewed when you die say that but it
[1:28:28] can't break up because look they have
[1:28:30] their same human spirit they still
[1:28:32] remember that somebody killed me wrong
[1:28:35] they didn't forget that they remember
[1:28:38] that someone killed us the wrong way and
[1:28:40] we want vengeance so they've got the
[1:28:42] wrong attitude and they still got their
[1:28:44] memories from their human spirit their
[1:28:46] human spirit did not break up when they
[1:28:47] died right and it's also proven by the
[1:28:53] rich man who died and went to hell right
[1:28:57] and he said Abraham said send Lazarus so
[1:29:00] he can go and witness the my six
[1:29:02] brothers or was it five his five
[1:29:04] brothers yeah go send to my five
[1:29:07] brothers because if someone raises from
[1:29:09] the dead they'll believe what Abraham
[1:29:11] say yeah you got the wrong thought there
[1:29:13] buddy you've got the wrong thought if
[1:29:16] they don't believe the literal preaching
[1:29:18] of Moses
[1:29:18] they're not going to believe that
[1:29:19] somebody rise from the dead if you don't
[1:29:21] believe the power of the written word
[1:29:23] you're not going to believe the word
[1:29:25] made manifest amen that's why we got to
[1:29:28] love the word met the word itself but
[1:29:30] also the power behind it we need both
[1:29:33] but we got to believe this word amen
[1:29:35] that's the trouble with the workers of
[1:29:37] iniquity they love the anointing but
[1:29:40] they don't love the written word and the
[1:29:42] church said they cast out devils that
[1:29:45] healed the sick they did all these
[1:29:46] things but they were workers of sin
[1:29:48] because they didn't love the written
[1:29:51] word of God but we love both same heme
[1:29:53] will wear spring tonight not just in
[1:29:56] spirit oh thank God somebody got here
[1:29:58] let's see if somebody gets here together
[1:29:59] let's pump you up let's get everybody
[1:30:01] jumping let's get everybody shouting
[1:30:02] that might be good we want the spirit
[1:30:05] but we want the truth as well tell me
[1:30:08] how to live my life give me instructions
[1:30:09] give me doctrine what does the Bible say
[1:30:12] what does it say about my life tell me
[1:30:14] what God said because I fear God and I
[1:30:17] want to keep his commands hey man so
[1:30:23] true we must have both and this is what
[1:30:26] they were lacking their spirits did not
[1:30:28] break up they had the same human spirit
[1:30:30] we need vengeance gimmie vengeance on
[1:30:32] those like Bob Arum said the high
[1:30:34] command group you know give me vengeance
[1:30:36] on the Germans give me vengeance on all
[1:30:37] these people that Russia the ones that
[1:30:39] may have killed us give us vengeance and
[1:30:42] look how merciful God is when he answers
[1:30:44] that's the look at verse verse 11 and
[1:30:49] white robes were given unto every one of
[1:30:52] them and it was said unto them that they
[1:30:55] should rest yet for a little season
[1:30:57] until their fellow-servants also and
[1:30:59] their brethren that should be killed as
[1:31:01] they were should be fulfilled so God
[1:31:04] gives any Jew who keeps all the Old
[1:31:08] Testament God gives a faithful Jew a
[1:31:11] white robe as long as he has a faithful
[1:31:14] testimony all how God loves a heart of
[1:31:17] integrity how God loves a pure heart
[1:31:21] amen that's why some friends if they've
[1:31:25] got a pure heart they got a good chance
[1:31:26] of getting a white robe because God
[1:31:29] loves someone that will live what they
[1:31:32] say they will
[1:31:32] amen if it's holy if it's righteous if
[1:31:36] it's good even though they're blind they
[1:31:38] had a testimony we love the Word of God
[1:31:40] we believe in righteousness we believe
[1:31:42] in holiness we know God's real though
[1:31:44] they didn't know it it's further
[1:31:45] revelation but because they live true to
[1:31:48] their testimony and their faith of the
[1:31:51] Old Testament God's that I'm giving you
[1:31:52] a white robe and church and even though
[1:31:56] their lives they rejected the blood of
[1:31:57] Jesus Christ during their lives but
[1:31:59] because they're blinded God gives them a
[1:32:01] white robe I notice it's nothing
[1:32:04] different than your robe is that right
[1:32:06] what do you get you get a red robe you
[1:32:09] get a blue robe you get a white robe we
[1:32:12] all get white robes because we all need
[1:32:16] the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:32:19] now we'll get different rewards right we
[1:32:21] get to be the bride they get to be the
[1:32:22] bride chamber keeper right but because
[1:32:28] we're the bride because we're called
[1:32:30] this we were called to believe this
[1:32:32] message remember he said in the
[1:32:33] beginning we were called blessed are
[1:32:35] your eyes for they see Amen all the
[1:32:39] prophets have longed to see what these
[1:32:40] seals meant they belong to know what the
[1:32:42] book of Revelation was but you and I
[1:32:44] know it Amen blessed are your eyes
[1:32:46] blessed are your ears for they hear
[1:32:50] hallelujah mm-hmm said they should rest
[1:32:56] for a little season program said that's
[1:32:58] the tribulation they got a rest for a
[1:33:00] little season a little tribulation
[1:33:02] season until their fellow-servants also
[1:33:04] and their brethren that should be killed
[1:33:06] as they were should be fulfilled amen
[1:33:11] now brother Graham said I hope this
[1:33:14] answers and solves your question on Soul
[1:33:17] sleeping souls do not go to sleep these
[1:33:20] souls are alive and well and they're so
[1:33:23] alive and well that they're crying out
[1:33:25] to Jesus there under the altar and
[1:33:27] they're crying to Jesus and Jesus talks
[1:33:29] back
[1:33:30] that's how alive they are and that's why
[1:33:35] brother Branham at the end of this he
[1:33:36] tells the story of going beyond the
[1:33:38] curtain of time right his body lays
[1:33:41] there but he sees it going away you see
[1:33:45] so he must mean us theophany going away
[1:33:47] his bodies there and he goes up and he's
[1:33:51] taking on a high place right
[1:33:53] he's exalted above the people I'm sorry
[1:33:55] first he goes down to the ground and
[1:33:57] he's get screened at all these things
[1:33:58] and he said it was just he said he said
[1:34:01] he was hugging women but all the sex
[1:34:03] glands was gone because there could be
[1:34:06] no temptation there God took that all
[1:34:08] out he said it was so beautiful he said
[1:34:10] it was beyond sublime he said was
[1:34:13] sublime time sublime is beyond sublime
[1:34:16] he said you he said you can't you can't
[1:34:19] explain how perfect it was
[1:34:20] he said everybody looked like they're 20
[1:34:23] years old glory and they're saying my
[1:34:27] precious brother my precious brother if
[1:34:29] you had not gone I wouldn't have been
[1:34:31] here that's what I want to say that's
[1:34:34] what I want to know I don't know people
[1:34:35] come up to me and say if you do not
[1:34:36] preach I would not have been here but
[1:34:39] then humble look at somebody said I
[1:34:41] would have been here if you did not
[1:34:43] preach well I'll have somebody that
[1:34:45] pointed us because that's how God works
[1:34:48] he flows through the body God saves man
[1:34:50] through man amen oh I trust on that day
[1:34:53] sister Connie that Tonya will look at
[1:34:54] you and say I'm here because you're here
[1:34:57] because of you because you had a garage
[1:34:59] sale amen hallelujah I hope we can all
[1:35:05] point each one and different ones that
[1:35:07] point us to Christ we can all point and
[1:35:08] say I'm here because of you amen and
[1:35:11] that'll be that'll be enough reward for
[1:35:13] me let like the real reward ledges let
[1:35:15] me sit at Jesus feet for 10,000 years
[1:35:18] that's all the reward I want but I hope
[1:35:20] people come and say because you preach
[1:35:22] the gospel that's why I'm here amen and
[1:35:27] that's how I end the fifth seal by going
[1:35:31] beyond the curtain of time and he says
[1:35:33] those those souls are alive and I
[1:35:37] remember when he was going back he was
[1:35:39] telling the angel or the voice I don't
[1:35:41] want to go back can I just stay well
[1:35:43] then it says but the gospel had to be
[1:35:45] preached oh my what would what would
[1:35:49] move God's heart to keep a servant of
[1:35:52] God who wanted to be with this wife one
[1:35:55] to be with his daughter to share rose
[1:35:56] what would moves God's heart to
[1:35:58] give him what he really wanted what
[1:36:00] would move God's heart would be souls
[1:36:02] that needed to hear the preaching of the
[1:36:04] gospel amen souls that weren't yet born
[1:36:07] again or saved or filled with the Holy
[1:36:09] Ghost that's what--when move God's heart
[1:36:11] to make sure he brought the proper come
[1:36:13] back here but I know you're enjoying it
[1:36:15] but come back here you need to preach
[1:36:17] God's Word because the preaching of the
[1:36:19] word is power and the salvation to all
[1:36:22] those who believe amen
[1:36:24] has been powerful to you oh yes it has
[1:36:28] that's why I love the message let's
[1:36:30] stand to our feet so I love the message
[1:36:32] because when I was in an organization it
[1:36:35] only had a little bit of power
[1:36:37] it only had power for me to get rid of a
[1:36:40] few things of my life but I could never
[1:36:44] get rid of all of them I still smoked I
[1:36:46] still chewed I still listen to bad music
[1:36:48] even though I still watch evil movies
[1:36:51] and all these prompts I still constant
[1:36:53] all these things but once I came and got
[1:36:55] baptized in Jesus Christ
[1:36:57] I never cussed one time after that ha ha
[1:37:00] ha I never went back to those things
[1:37:04] after coming this because this message
[1:37:06] has power to truly set a man or woman
[1:37:08] free and now that we're born again Saint
[1:37:13] tries accuse it tries accused as he
[1:37:15] tries to discourage us but we always
[1:37:17] remember that Jesus said that he can't
[1:37:19] touch the oil and the wine in our lives
[1:37:21] ha ha ha saying can't touch the Holy
[1:37:26] Ghost inside of me he can't take the
[1:37:27] Holy Ghost from me amen so no matter how
[1:37:30] hard he tries to tempt me and beat me
[1:37:32] down when it all comes to the very
[1:37:35] depths of my soul my soul will always go
[1:37:37] back and say no devil I'm staying with
[1:37:40] the word amen amen
[1:37:42] because he cannot touch that Holy Ghost
[1:37:46] seal amen
[1:37:47] how did he God put it there and it
[1:37:50] seemed to the day of redemption and it
[1:37:52] never be removed I'm seeing it for
[1:37:54] eternity praise God hallelujah and he
[1:37:58] can't take my stimulation Wednesday
[1:38:00] night he can't take a happiness he can't
[1:38:02] take our joy because Christ gave it to
[1:38:05] us amen hallelujah
[1:38:07] he can't take that from us we just got
[1:38:10] to make sure we don't give it to him
[1:38:12] remember the Bible never said you're
[1:38:14] sealed with wine you're seeing with the
[1:38:15] oil to the day of redemption and we know
[1:38:18] a lot of people that may have only
[1:38:19] ghosts but they sure lost their wine and
[1:38:22] they're just grumpy Christians now whiny
[1:38:25] yeah exactly yeah whiny you're right
[1:38:28] that's a good one I never heard that one
[1:38:29] before just whine and complain about
[1:38:32] this complain about why is the pastor
[1:38:34] that why is the Deacons do that why is
[1:38:36] this only to do that why they do that
[1:38:38] they complain about everything instead
[1:38:39] of realizing how thankful they should be
[1:38:41] just for life just for this message how
[1:38:44] thankful they should be for the power
[1:38:46] and had to change their lives amen thank
[1:38:50] the Lord
[1:38:52] what a blessing we have Church with
[1:38:55] these first five seals up I'll probably
[1:38:56] preach the six separate next week and
[1:38:58] maybe we just we'll just do two parts on
[1:38:59] the seals is that okay by God's grace
[1:39:01] then we'll get to the real new stuff
[1:39:03] seven eight and all the way through oh
[1:39:05] that's real new to me by the grace of
[1:39:07] God how many love the Lord and I've
[1:39:12] always said this I'm gonna say it again
[1:39:13] I hope it you don't get tired of it the
[1:39:15] main thing with the seals the main
[1:39:17] revelation is sin we cannot let that
[1:39:20] Antichrist spirit right into our lives
[1:39:23] because he's only gonna get more
[1:39:25] powerful he comes in as a little
[1:39:27] doctrine and then he starts kit blobs
[1:39:30] are black represents them so red
[1:39:32] represents killing and that's how it
[1:39:35] works today you see people the message
[1:39:36] when they get an evil spirit they start
[1:39:38] killing people killing their testimonies
[1:39:42] bad-mouthing this person bad-mouthing
[1:39:44] that person and then they try to go to
[1:39:46] the black they try to build their own
[1:39:48] Kingdom and then they die spiritually
[1:39:51] and they really will never stay with the
[1:39:52] word we've all seen people do that
[1:39:54] especially preachers that have the wrong
[1:39:58] Antichrist spirit because remember Jesus
[1:40:01] said this he said sin is like a little
[1:40:05] mustard grain seed it grows up into a
[1:40:07] great tree and all the fowls are the
[1:40:10] unclean spirits Lodge on it that's what
[1:40:12] Jesus said so we can never let sin get
[1:40:17] into our lives we can never become a
[1:40:20] good sinner we've got to become an awful
[1:40:23] sinner we've got to feel so so bad
[1:40:25] we always be a sinner saved by grace I
[1:40:28] sit but I'm saying I'm forgiven by the
[1:40:31] grace of God amen
[1:40:34] I just read a quote today we wrote
[1:40:36] brother ham said never make yourself
[1:40:38] feel so secure that you feel like you
[1:40:39] would never fall away in other words be
[1:40:41] humble never get so exhausted like all
[1:40:44] Satan will never touch me you watch that
[1:40:47] you can go pretty low brother Brian had
[1:40:51] some real hard trials he laid in a bed
[1:40:54] for nine days one time almost died he
[1:40:58] had those amoebas right because he
[1:40:59] disobeyed the Lord almost died let's
[1:41:02] never get exalted let's be thankful we
[1:41:04] got that eternal spirit that Satan can't
[1:41:06] touch it but let's be vigilant let's

[1:41:16] tribe of Judah hallelujah we've got the
[1:41:18] Holy Ghost we got Jesus we've got the
