chapter one I'd like to continue on the stats for her man which is called the the mystery of godliness restored to man and then we'll read our memory verse from sister Caroline of Isaiah 12 the second Peter chapter 1 yeah second Peter chapter one Lord willing we'll look at faith as a foundation and then we'll begin a virtue tonight and we'll see how far we get by God's grace like to preach about an hour Lord willing I'm going to read myself I read verses three four and five that's really believed this is the way God builds Christian stature or maturity is through this path let's really believe that I truly believe this is a sanctification message you have to start with faith and then you get more little sanctify to get virtue he keeps saying defying you and he gives you all these virtues until you're capped off with charity after that you stay attached to the vine and pretty soon after that you'll produce real godly fruit as we looked at a little bit on Sunday night what if think about this what if all message churches preached it that way you have a lot more people that would see their need to be born again that's why I believe this is called a great mystery because a lot of even message searchers don't understand it but it's been revealed to us and so we want to take advantage of that say God add to my faith virtue add to my virtue knowledge to that my temperance and patience and godliness brotherly kindness add the baptism of the Holy Ghost to my brotherly kindness verse three according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness or whatever we need Church he's given to us by promise through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by the you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge let's go to Isaiah chapter 12 verse 2 I will read verses 2 through 5 out loved let's begin on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my son he also is become my salvation therefore the joy of salvation and in that day shall you say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord he have done excellent things this is known in all the earth let's have one more word of Prayer here as our head sir father will thank the Lord we love you Lord we raised our hearts and we're hands to heaven Lord we reach out and touch your Lord God by faith we love you Lord and father just minister to all the needs Lord God you know the sick need heal hearts need a strength and Lord God and Lord Souls needs save God's who use us Jesus use us and where we know that these promises are given to us and we just pray God we can receive your divine nature through the promises through believing and through patiently waiting until we receive father bless our our preaching tonight in our exception of God's Word will give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name no reset amen amen god bless you as you're seated Lord willing I think we're on part five I believe tonight know the mystery of godliness restored a new man a new blade quite quite a good foundation on faith last week looking at justification by faith and then the gift of faith and saving faith last week and then more willing a Sunday night we looked at the fruit of faith so faith is quite an amazing subject it's mentioned over 220 times in the New Testament it's it's quite a it's quite a topic because it's the very foundation and today we'll look at that as foundation we saw it here in 2nd Peter chapter 1 is the very first thing God gives you a member were saved by grace through faith so faith is a gift of God in other words it's a it's a measure of God's anointing that he gives you you have a little anointing of God's Spirit when you repent of your sins and you choose to follow Jesus Christ as the way praise God now we'll look at some scriptures here tonight I've got some Bible readers hopefully by God's grace let's start with vacation we'll start with the youngest and I usually start with the illness Keysha Luke 22:31 232 now this is a scripture to show that in in the middle of Peters deepest darkest trial and we could say failure right in the in Peters deepest failure what held him how come he didn't fall away like Judas what what hell Peter so we see from this scripture the answer is his foundation of faith so let's look at this and here we can see again the power of prayer we know you know God cannot go above free more agency so if someone wants to be lost they're going to be lost but if they want to be saved God will use other people to honor that that confidence and that faith that desire and God can force anyone to love him or receive faith so here we see Jesus is prayer working with Peters desire to be saved and so God honors Jesus's prayer so case you look 20 to 31 and 32 yes please that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may shift us eat but I pray for thee and thy faith fail not for thou art converted strengthen desire all right thank you okay so we see in the scripture right before Peters greatest failure as a believer as a Christian denying Christ three times to just the young maid Jesus said you know Satan wants to sift you like wheat okay now sift means to agitate that's they would take the the pitchforks and agitate the wheat grains right so Saint wanted to shake him up and remove him and then trample on him but Jesus said I prayed for you that your faith won't fail you won't fail you won't be agitated you won't be destroyed you won't be trodden asunder right you won't be you won't go to perdition he said I prayed for you that your faith won't fail this is quite a statement and also quite understanding so do you realize children that you could deny Christ three times and still your faith in a failure it would look like you did fail right it would look like you failed but you didn't you didn't fail which means you didn't throw away your faith right because we know Peter felt bad about his mistake right but that doesn't mean he was going to be lost that doesn't mean he lost his faith totally it just means he got a spirit of fear upon him and doesn't mean he lost his faith okay so I want you to keep that in mind too if you ever make a mistake you ever fail and you feel really bad about it it's good that you feel bad about it because your dad has made mistakes and I felt ashamed of myself before but that doesn't mean you're not saved right so we must keep that in mind this is why this is why Peter such a great example for us in the scripture we can learn so much from him and remember he's the one Jesus gave the keys to the game he already had the keys of the kingdom right but he wasn't really using them yet because it didn't get the Holy Ghost once I got the Holy Ghost that he can go use them on the day of Pentecost 3,000 people got saved Cornelius his house they got the Holy Ghost and then Samaria he prayed for them to get the Holy Ghost after Philip did an evangelistic work there so it was Jesus's prayer that kept Peters faith foundation from falling even though he denied in three times see Peter didn't commit suicide like Judas right he didn't take money to sell Jesus out on purpose like Judas did he felt bad about it he didn't leave God's presence like Canaan Cain left he purposely left the Friends of God well Peter left cuz he was ashamed but he wanted to come back right but Cain just left it would humble himself so in other words Peter hung around until he could experience Christ's forgiveness that's what you want to do you want to hang around church you want to hang around church even if you failed until you feel Christ drawing you to repent and then you'll feel forgiven when you genuinely repent that's right because remember Peter knew this in John 6 68 he said Lord to whom shall we go thou has the words to eternal life for he's God he didn't go off to the the Pharisees and Sadducees and the Sanhedrin and try to make some money off of Jesus he went and hid it right and cried and wept bitterly and felt ashamed of himself until he heard Jesus was resurrected and then until Jesus himself appeared to Peter to prove that he'd been resurrected alright now be encouraged search you know you might say well Jesus prayed for Peter or what about me he didn't pray for you he prayed for me praise God and that's why my faith is standing today amen so Lydia why don't you read John that's what John 17 20 and 21 the Malka if you can go to Matthew 7 24 25 so Lydia's gonna read a scripture about how Jesus prayed for his disciples and for us and so as long as church as long as we have a desire to be saved and not be lost God will make a way that we can be saved amen so go ahead they all may be one as a father or indeed they also may be one a praise God so jesus prayed for all the all his disciples and all those who would hear on him through their word praise God and that's we read the Bible where steer was that we're still hearing on Jesus through their words through their testimonies praise God so we thank you Lord Jesus for your prayers that's perfect because he's the high priest amen he's a priest so see st. since our faith is motivated by love our faith foundation is the rock on which God builds our spiritual house the faith is the rock the foundation now it's interesting Peter had the foundation but his house got blown down but he never lost his foundation so Malachi is gonna read Matthew 4 or 7 24 and 25 which is right after Jesus talks about false prophets how they could do supernatural things the anointed ones at the end time and Jesus will say I never knew you and it's because they forfeited the foundation of real genuine faith so now I can read that there's there's there for whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will like you to him unto a wise man which goes house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not first founded upon the rock amen now we have to understand this children that Judas at one time had the foundation the Bible said the word is like a seed right and it fell into his heart but it fell upon stony grounds right it didn't have the right the right type of ground another illustration is like the other kind of ground jesus said where the seed falls right in the ground but then a bird comes by and snatches that word away Judas did miracles he was baptized he baptized others he was sanctified to some degree at some point but then at another point he forsook it he sold it out he transgressed or he transgressed God's covenant and God's Word and or Sukkot and got rid of it he he rejected God's anointing and then he took the anointing of Satan himself as the son of perdition and so this is what Jesus says faith is our rock foundation thank God amen that if we build if we genuinely build our relationship with Jesus Christ upon his own faith when the storms come Church our testimonies not going to fall amen our testimony is going to stand when the trials of life when coronavirus comes through right when when financial trouble comes through when family trouble comes through our tent we're not going to lose our testimony and one of our say Christianity will keep our testimony our testimony will stand in the midst of our trials so si has an overcomer we receive faith we reject unbelief because remember those are the two choices at this point you have either faith or unbelief you reject unbelief you accept faith and God gives you that faith anointing and gives you that you have that foundation laid in your soul and then once you have that foundation God wants to start building the structure don't see that you want to start building virtue praise God so let's start looking at virtue virtue is the second measure or portion the Holy Ghost anointing is number of faith is a portion according to Romans 12 everybody has a measure of faith that's a portion a substance of faith so then God wants to add virtue to you all right so we're going to read some scriptures here let's get a case you're ready here so you go to Matthew 23 25 acacia alright so the second thing after you choose faith now remember faith is choosing the way because jesus said the way the truth the life way is justification the truth sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth so the truth is the sanctification stage and then the life is the baptism with Holy Ghost that's a great revelation and I got last week while preaching this Haman but virtue is this first step of the truth receiving the truth now in the New Testament virtue is a strong course of action its moral excellence now Hebrew it means strength or might so when you combine these two definitions of virtue you see that virtue is the strength to daily walk in God's Way now this makes sense logically to after you have faith faith chooses the right way then you need strength to empower you to walk in the right way right so faith is like you going for a walk faith is you choose the right path now virtue is what you need to walk that path and so virtue is the second obvious character trait the second measure of anointing God gives to the believer now to receive this you've got to reject hypocrisy because hypocrisy is the in the Greek means that acting of a stage player like we don't want to act like or enjoy in church we want to we wouldn't enjoy it praise God we don't want to act like we enjoy listening to the tapes we don't want to act like we enjoy singing or enjoy them we don't want to act like we enjoy the preaching we want to be real praise God and that's what you get when you get virtue you genuinely have that strength to live a Christian life because of a modern definition of hypocrisy is claiming to have beliefs or standards but your behavior does not conform to it so we don't want to be hypocrites right I was saying like this Pharisees as a case you're going to be the scripture of course the Pharisees were the kings of hypocrisy so in case you read Matthew 23 25 well to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess no he's showing censure there can you read verse 28 as well even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but with their knee are full of hypocrisy and iniquity very good okay a perfect example of people that reject virtue because they reject God's anointing on virtue they go to the side of hypocrisy Jesus says you look beautiful your clothes are modest right your hairs long for you brothers your hair short trimmed up but inwardly he said you're full of extortion you're trying to get money the wrong way excess and then hypocrisy you're a stage player not even living and we know they weren't even living Moses's law they had their own books called the Mishnah which was the traditional interpretation of Moses's law that other rabbis had written before them in other words they were living the traditions of men rather than the commandments of God and the one example Jesus gave was many of the Pharisees the sin of taking care of their parents in their own age and spending that money on them they would give the money to the temple and of course that would go back to them you know it would fund their their programs their desires very selfish and Jesus said because of your tradition you made the commandments of God of none effect and so elderly parents weren't getting cared for they weren't getting fed they were getting taken care of and so people were being hurt because of their hypocrisy but yeah out really they looked they looked the part they went to church every Saturday right we go every Sunday we cannot let an Apocrypha rule our lives especially as message believers we got to be sincere we have to have virtue strength to live what we say we believe and that's real virtue now the first place we're really going to see our virtue is in our home so Lidia Malka can you turn to Matthew 10:32 listen a whole bunch of scriptures with Matthew 10:32 242 but we're not going to read on that then can you read 32 and 33 therefore confess me before men so ever shut the night before men him raise gods jesus says you have to confess Christ before other people now remember this a few months ago I preached on this this was a real blessing to Peter denied Christ three times before men right but then he said he's sorry he said he was sorry and then after that he got the Holy Ghost he never denied Christ again okay you have to make sure we're patient and we understand God will forgive us if we make a mistake God will forgive us now back I would like you to read here 34 and 35 think not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to send peace but a sword Brian come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother-in-law great verse 36 and a man's foes shall be they of his own household let me say like this for our children your siblings will your foes until you really love Jesus right if you really love Jesus he says you won't deny him in in your household you'll have peace in your household in other words right so that's what we really need we need the Holy Spirit to give us faith and virtue to love our siblings amen and not deny Christ in our homes it's so critical so important verse 37 he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me to see we no matter what people in our household say we have to believe God's Word and obey God's Word so a good example might be if some of your household is saying evil words or cursing or watching bad shows we must not join them we must not partake in that because when you partake in that then you'll be a partaker of the consequences of that that's what the mystery Mystery Babylon is all about that's why the daughters are will be guilty just as the mother the denominations of Protestants will be just as guilty as the Roman Catholic because they're not standing up against it they must stand against all forms of evil avoid all appearance of evil praise God so that's an important scripture us Hebert you if you can live your faith out in your family with virtue in your home then Jesus says you'll live it out with others because he said you you you're probably going to get a lot of Opposition in your home that's what he says so his requirement is public and private confession of Jesus Christ so he gives us the anointing to do it for his god amen since Jesus requires us to confess our him before our family and friends he gives us the virtue to do it praise God amen beautiful beautiful scriptures praise God now let's look at a few scriptures here Casey can you get Deuteronomy 25 five and Lenny can you go there as well well I'll read five verses Deuteronomy 25 five to ten they have case you read to them whether you can the last three okay so I want to go to two examples virtue from the Old Testament so the first two people I thought about were Ruth and Daniel okay now Ruth is just a beautiful example because the Bible says she specifically had virtue it's just a perfect example that's why I love the message brother Adam showed us if you just run a concordance or the Bible you will find in the revelations that you're looking for because God used those same words over and over and over to give the same revelations okay so Ruth is a great example of virtue Boaz was the wealthy Bethlehem ight Lord of the harvest he was a kinsman to Mount melon Ruth's first husband who died without any children to carry on his name well God was so gracious God didn't want Malins name to die so God had a law that if a man dies and he doesn't have children to carry out his name sons then that then the brother of the man who died has to marry his wife and give her children so her first husband's name the husband that died his name can continue on so let's read that so it's a Deuteronomy 25 five to ten so case you read five and six and then Lydia can be seven eight nine oh three five six and seven then you're eight nine ten okay okay so when you're ready brethren drive together and one of them died and have no child the wife of the dead shall not marry without - unto a stranger her husband's weather shall go in unto her and take her to Hamlet to White and perform the duty of a husband's brothers unto her and it shows me that the first chord which she bares shall succeed it and the good name of his brother which is that that his name is not put out of Israel and if the man alike not to take his brother his wife then let his brother's wife cuddle up the gate unto the elders and say my husband's brother refuses to raise up unto him unto his brother ARIMA in Israel he will not perform the judea of my husband's brother then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand - inside life not to take her then shot his brother's wife commanded him in the presence of the elders and loosed his shoe from off his foot and spin his face and shall answer and say show so shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house and his name shall be called is there the house of him that has his shoes amen so now that's a great background and this is the scripture children that Ruth was believing that was Ruth the Jew she's ammo byte but she was a proselyte right she had a choice you either stay in Moab or come back with Naomi and because she respected Naomi's God she said your God is gonna be my god right your life where you die I'm gonna die where you live I'm gonna live because she saw such godliness and they owned his life praise God and so she comes here and and she must have asked Naomi well what's the law I would like to be married and so Naomi must have directed her back to this and you know what she did but let's just talk about it you know she went out to the field Naomi direct her which field to go to you know her family and she gleaned a little bit and everybody started seeing wow what a god she's a nice young beautiful woman and she's just willing to work and pretty soon there's a nice reputation about Ruth that's what we all want a good reputation we're hard workers we keep the Word of God we don't play around we're not foolish with people right they don't break laws and things like that we live a godly life and so in the Ruth 311 Boaz says the confidence that he has he said I will do to thee for all the city of my people death know that thou art a virtuous woman he imagined it she lived such a godly life everybody in the town knew she was a good person because of her virtue now you remember what she did one night while one night while Boaz was sleeping he he had a little I think a little bit to drink if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that but he laid down on this this this paje and Ruth Ruth knew the Word of God she knew she had a godly testimony as she thought if he's a gun if he's if that man's worth anything she said no no doubt he was a good man she did that too but she knew if he's a believer all's I've got to do is I've just got to go present myself there and say that my husband died and you can raise me it you can raise up a seed through me in other words I want you to keep God's Word I want you to keep God's Word so she initiated it maybe he wasn't open maybe he was unaware of it but that that's why Ruth is such a godly example she wanted the people and the men to honor God's Word she wanted to bring forth children right which we know is Obed she wanted so she initiated is a husband she said can you be my husband because God's Word says you shouldn't be my husband praise God and so of course he says yes I'll do this of course this is this is right this is scriptural everybody knows you're a virtuous woman remember beau has children beau has pointed out that she could have ran she's a mobile bite she could ran off and buried any rich young man she was tempted to do that she could ran off and married somebody quick so she'd have to go work in that hot Sun but she chose to honor God's Word and because of that God honored her and put her name and lineage in the lineage of Jesus Christ praise God a Moabite he didn't even belong in it no connection to Jesus Christ but because she honored Naomi and then one bow has to honor God's Word and initiated God's Word God put her in the very lineage of Jesus Christ and turned that shows how God God brought a Gentile into the faith that showed how God was gonna bring the Gentiles into the holy tree in other words the church ages please God since the Judas turned him down he said I'll get a Gentile that's what God was showing God was showing I can bring a Gentile into this lineage I can do it by grace amen so just a beautiful beautiful story so see this proves you and I can live out our faith at all times and our virtue in all public settings if she can do it in a hot Blazing Sun a bunch of men that were rich and you know watching her and everything like that then we can do it right we can do it because where most of us aren't working that hard right with also us at work you're gonna mow soon I'm gonna go work out in the fields you're gonna work in an air-conditioned office or school probably right your life's gonna be so easy so she can do it in the hot Sun all of you can do it in the cool air conditioning you can do it because it's the same Holy Spirit praise God and your dad does it every day when I used to go to school I live the godly life in front of everybody everybody knows there I'm a Christian praise God all right so Ruth is a great testimony obey God's Word publicly despite financial and sensual temptations maybe Boaz wasn't the nicest looking guy there was younger men that she could've ran off with maybe he was an older looking guy maybe wasn't so handsome we don't know when she was tempted by young men by riches easy life she easily could have left Naomi but she stayed true to Naomi just like the bride stays true to the old testament word - right we see principles in their honor thy mother and father thou shalt not steal kill we keep those commands praise God now let's look at another one - I forgot I had another one about 20 minutes here by God's grace Solomon gives us another example of virtue in proverbs 31 which is fitting that we just passed mother's day two Sundays ago I'll just go over this briefly but Solomon says a virtuous woman possesses the fear of the Lord and to fear the Lord if she has that she shall be praised now remember wisdom is the result of having fear so if you fear God first you respect God you don't want to break his word you want to love him and obey Him you don't want to go to hell right your respect his his power the strength if you have that God is going to give you wisdom because Solomon says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so virtuous woman there in Solomon's writing shall fear God and then she makes wise decisions remember she made wise decisions and motherhood her personal finances and her business deals and so will you write and you're late you'll make a wise decision when you marry that woman you'll make a wise decision if a man tries to court you you'll make wise men not a foolish decision you'll make a wise decision with your money you're not going to go blow your money on anything right you're going to use it wisely and best steals before you invest in a car before you invest in start your own business you make sure it's a good business you're gonna use wisdom other words what God approve of me doing this so to give you an example we've got approve of a of me going to work at a salon where you cut women's hair is that a good business to start no not with wisdom how about for America we'll make a video game where we're killing people all the time how about that would that be a good thing vampires and zombies and video game about drugs will make a movie about drugs and all the benefits of that have all kinds of evil things course not you wouldn't put your money into a business deal and something that was evil and sinful because you fear God you don't care if it's gonna be popular or not with people you want to do what God's calling you to do because if God because if you under God if you book God first he'll give you everything you need praise God amen seek you first and everything else and if you put the spiritual things first everything in the natural be added to you praise God I'm a witness of that hallelujah so see a virtuous woman is trustworthy her heart of her husband does safely trust in her so when you have virtue children I'll be able to trust you out in public which I did especially with your friends right around your friends that's when you know you got virtue Summa no hate no one time Haman asks about the stage for men you know you got murked you when I can trust you to honor God's Word around your friends that aren't obeying God's Word that's a good that's a good measurement that you know you got burnt you how they're doing them and this kind of person is number she's clothed with strength and honor that's her clothing so the same thing that's virtue right strength is virtue so when you're a virtuous young man or virtuous young ladies your clothing is your spiritual strength your virtue your clothes with that you wear that people can see you're not going to laugh at the dirty jokes you're not going to all people names not going to treat people in an evil way you're gonna be a solid sound Christian that a strength you're not gonna deny the word you're gonna deny the word and and do evil things you're gonna keep the word no matter who's around I'm sure you you guys Mara went to that funeral and Sheffield a few months ago and sister so there that that's a good place where you can see what kind of virtue you have like if I think a good example is Malachi some of the older guys we're trying to do a game the wrong way but you got to stand up for the game the right way right so when you stand up for good that's a good sign you've got to merge you when you're standing up for others getting teased you're trying to stand up for them that's a good sign you got virtue because you're doing it publicly and people can see that you're not a pushover you're not a pretender right you're not a you're not a hypocrite you're not a Pharisee they just pretend to be holy but they're really not they don't really live what they believe as that's what we have to do as well so I hope that helps the children Haven is that cup a little bit so everybody new in the town everybody new in the message church right everybody knew that around the message that this person was a real solid Christian and just like Ruth this virtuous woman is so valuable her price is far above rubies praise God when you've got virtue you're worth millions praise God you're worth more than millions you can't you can't put a value on that because children you don't know our children you don't know the pain of divorce I do because I my parents were divorced I would give any money to have my parents in love back together is it the price is invaluable and a virtuous life is far valuable more valuable than riches and millions of dollars I'd give anything if I could go back and my parents always took me to the messenger action and taught me the things of God is so valuable I give all of the money I have from the bank right now for that easy I can go back I can be raising the spiritual things of God it's it's a it's a value ride enough to live through you know having no dad there but in our dad there to be with me dad didn't come to my games you know I didn't I didn't have that it's it's so valuable so you can't put a value on it and that's why the Bible says a good Christian character it's more for value than anything someone who's got strength and virtue to live God's Word okay the last example is Daniel Daniel was so virtuous he was so dedicated his co-workers in public they watched him on the job they couldn't find one thing wrong that he couldn't he didn't break one rule I'll tell you that's virtue right there I'm sure at my job sometimes ever now then I might for I might forget something I don't do something right but Daniel they couldn't find one thing on him so they had to concoct a devious plan to make a law where they know he would break it because it dealt with his faith as a religion and so they did this in Daniel chapter six you know the story so he had a choice do I publicly under God or not do I keep praying or but do I reject my public testimony what he choose he chose virtue he chose I'll still open my window I'll still get on my knees and pray to god I'll face towards Jerusalem and I was pray to my god I guess he had public strength to obey God's Word that's real virtue she kept his three prayers a day we know he got arrested he got sentenced he's thrown into the dead but God sent His Holy Angel there to shut the lion's mouth and he was delivered this is the power divine virtue public strength to do what's right even when you know you're gonna suffer so now we have women examples and I gave you a boy example there as well a virtue or you can live it publicly praise God no matter what people say they can say whatever they want no matter they can even lay lay temptations in front of you but you will choose to do what's right each time alright so let's go we have 15 minutes let's do a couple more let's look at some examples Jesus gives of how we can mean virtuous and some of these will apply to us so let's go education today was I was going to Matthew 5 38 to 42 is she millionaire - Lydia Matthew 6 so Jesus Christ gives concrete examples how to manifest virtue in public and private settings and this is the beautiful part virtue is an anointing but you got to have that anointing before you go out in public if not you won't have that virtue that strength to give out ok so in other words we got to be ready when someone asks us to do something got to be ready to do it if we possibly can so Matthew 5 38 Meraki he read 38 39 to 40 you have heard that has been said an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth but I stand he that ye resist not evil though whatsoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will see the Lord sing away thy coat let him have thy cloak also all right so here we're to see four examples of here are some obvious ways that you can show you have virtue somebody hit you you don't hit a magnet so for us somebody pushes you somebody punches you you don't budge you back case you 4142 to go mile go with him Twain give it to you him that asketh thee give that Barrio of me turn turn that that way praise God these are beautiful examples of having virtue you can give out right but eventually you got that virtue before you can give it out you have to have strength before you can strengthen others okay so these are four great examples you have to have this strength if somebody hits you you don't hit them back if you get sued and somebody wants something give them something else if somebody wants you to go an extra mile you have strength to go the extra mile if somebody asks you for something you got to be able to give it to them all right now Matthew 6 is more about private virtue that's okay you've heard of motorcycle programs tapes you hear people honking all the time because they're their church was at the corner of an intersection you've never seen so Matthew six Jesus gives us some more examples of having virtue 6 verses 1 to 4 you read 1 to 4 is he that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore was I just going alms do not send a chucker before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have the glory of men barely I say to you they have their reward when I just um let thought I left him know if thy right hand do this but thine alms may be in secret and that they father and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly thank you so almsgiving is a private way to have virtue he says take heed which means pay special attention to do your giving in secret and not before other people see it takes virtue to give in secret don't sound the trumpet that's what a hypocrite does yeah I like churches that have ministries for the poor but they put all their giving on Facebook that's like that's a modern-day trumpet look what I've done yeah look what we're doing I think it might be all right sometimes maybe you know I just as a witness or something like that to get people to rejoice but Jesus says try to do it in secret don't sound the trumpet before you so when we seek the glory of man that shows were hip hypocritical we're lacking the virtue of the Holy Spirit but when you have holy spirit virtue you do it for God's glory you have strength to keep it just between you and God and that individual okay so let's finish with this I got ten minutes let's finish with this neck section I just want to show this is more of a message subject you'd be familiar with if you listened to the sermon called a statue preferred man beautiful sermon I think it's about two and a half hours but there's one statement that needs to be balanced a little bit and I've heard of preached I've heard preached wrong on a YouTube video so brother Brad makes a statement and when he brother man preaches on virtue he uses the scripture from mark 5 and Luke 6 that says the woman with the bloody issue touched Jesus and virtue went out of him and brother Branham uses that scripture to say see we have to have virtue coming out of us and so a lot of people misunderstand that and they say well the preacher that I breacher said if someone hasn't touched you and they've got healed from their sickness that you don't have virtue that's an awful false doctrine but see they just misunderstood brother branham's statement that he's making and so to understand this we have to know the difference of healing virtue versus regular regular virtue okay because there's two different they're two different things okay so healing virtue is another way to say the gift of healing okay so enjoy when that woman touched Jesus and virtue went out that was basically the gift of healing right maybe the gift of miracles it wasn't the virtue we're talking about which is the second attribute of a Christian faith virtue that's not the merchant we're talking about Jesus's virtue was divine healing virtue or maybe a miracle gift of miracle virtue okay so let's prove that by the scripture Malachi if you get the next one here first print 12 29 and 30 so you know the story of a woman this is one time for the father didn't tell Jesus what was going to happen so Jesus could just gets touched and he's like who touched me he didn't know God didn't tell us son everything right jesus's flesh did not know everything and so when he made the request she humbly comes and says yeah it was me and jesus honors her faith he said daughter your faith is Maj Hall go in peace be whole of thy plagues so Jesus heal the plague just like he heals the plagues of coronavirus praise God so that's a good example of Jesus had the gift of miracles the gift of divine healing we'd say but healing virtue does not lie in every Christian that gift of healing is not in every Christian so now guys gonna read it first Corinthians 12 29 and 30 go everybody prophets are all teachers because America how about a gift of healing do all speak with tongues go interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I do to you a more excellent way alright thank you okay so see is every Christian an apostle does every Christian go overseas and preach and start churches no is every Christian an interpreter of unknown tongues no so the same is true here not every person has the gift of divine healing or miracles in that so that you touch them they can feel the healing process start now I've prayed for numerous people on member acam Church in other places where I prayed for them and they felt the healing power go through them I can't remember the brother's wife's name but the brother goes to cams Church and his wife years ago this is probably 10 years ago I prayed for her to revival service and she felt the healing she had nerve trouble on her back and everything and she felt the healing go through her so I you know it just has a testimony that's happened in my ministry people have felt the virtue flow out into them but that's not all the time and not everybody has to have that because he says do all have the gifts of healing no Larry that's another thing so Lord willing we'll cover there go there in a couple of weeks and Brotherhood ere he could ask his wife now she left a message sadly but she got healed in our revival meetings about ten years ago so we see that the Jesus's virtue to heal was not the virtue we're talking about it's two different things both were powers but one is power to live a godly life publicly and privately and the other is power to actually bring healing to people's body to different things so we don't want to confuse them if you do that again you'll have people seeking the gifts rather than the giver praise God you have to see that you have to see that we must seek the giver of the gifts and while doing that God will use us in little gifts every time every time that's happened where you know God has healed somebody through a prayer might I'm really just unaware of it I'm just obeying God's Word many times I don't feel it I'm just believing it and then it happens and that's that's what we find Jesus said apart from me you can do nothing so I always want to realize I'm nothing we want to realize we're nothing we just want to obey God's Word you and ourselves to God's Holy Spirit and then God will do the work it's not in our time it's not our season it's not by our might but by God's Spirit saith the Lord all right so I think I'll stop right there about 54 minutes praise the Lord I'll stop right there next time it's going to be a good message maybe I'll preach it Sunday as well we're going to show how Peter gained virtues and then lost I'm sorry game character qualities and then lost them then we'll show ment numerous examples through the was just at the beautiful beautiful study let me just give you the taste of what your appetite the Bible said Peter was so anointed he preached and healed in his own City so he had he had so much virtue he was preaching amongst all his neighbors and brothers about Jesus Christ but then when he gets in the presence of that maid he can't even stand up he can't even say he knows Jesus yet can you imagine preach it in front of me you know imagine preaching from your neighbors imagine imagine seeing a special in front of our neighbors Peter was doing that he was preaching in front of everybody but then one little girl says you're one of them no no no no I don't even know I don't know proving you can you can have that anointing but then it can be lost it can be taken right because the demons can come in your house and bind up the strongman and spoil your goods so god bless you singer and praise the Lord let's sing Hosanna blessed to be the rock I say magnify the Lord with me let's stand here praise God let's just stand and worship the Lord God is so good oh god may fill us with virtue we can live a godly life
