[0:00] the house of the Lord thank God for all
[0:02] the plowers out there I'm sure brother
[0:04] Jose was out there plowing thank you sir
[0:05] for plowing those roads everybody safe
[0:08] today by the grace of God pardon
[0:15] me Matthew 12: 24 I've been studying on
[0:18] a few different thoughts here and I'm
[0:20] going to take a little break from the
[0:21] two series I'm working on I just want to
[0:23] preach a general thought uh today called
[0:25] uh what is blasphemy of the Holy Ghost I
[0:28] kind of want to look at that here today
[0:29] when studying on that and I think
[0:31] there'll be a lot of encouraging things
[0:32] here I found some wonderful quotes from
[0:34] God's Prophet uh brother brandham it
[0:36] just as I've studied this the last few
[0:37] weeks it's given me a a better
[0:39] understanding on this subject
[0:42] Hallelujah now of course you know we are
[0:45] endeavoring to be marked with the mark
[0:47] of God brother Randon preached a sermon
[0:49] called The Mark of the Beast and the
[0:50] Seal of God hallelujah and that's what
[0:53] this topic is about uh and so by God's
[0:55] grace we are sealed by the baptism of
[0:57] the Holy Ghost hallelujah we're not Mar
[1:00] we're not part of Satan's family we're
[1:02] part of God's family Hallelujah but it
[1:04] gives us a good understanding here and
[1:06] uh we the understanding is that you know
[1:08] sometimes as as as Christians we we say
[1:11] the wrong thing uh but God gives us
[1:13] Grace Hallelujah even in the midst of
[1:15] our trials our mistakes and uh and and
[1:17] God is faithful so I just thought I'd uh
[1:19] preach this here today as it's been
[1:20] fresh to me uh it's been a a fresh study
[1:23] I had this question and um from this
[1:26] different this this brother I don't
[1:27] remember what nation he's from but he
[1:29] said Satan torments me with this that I
[1:32] that I've blasphemed the Holy Ghost and
[1:34] I thought why would this torment so I
[1:36] started studying it I could see some
[1:39] things here and I I think this sermon
[1:40] will help you I think it it's already
[1:42] helped me Hallelujah and I think it'll
[1:44] help this brother I would like to share
[1:45] it with him eventually but I thought
[1:46] it'd be a good study I don't think I've
[1:48] ever preached just fully one sermon on
[1:50] this by the grace of God so how many
[1:53] enjoy how many enjoy the word of God
[1:54] today Hallelujah enjoy the songs enjoy
[1:56] the worship what a joy to be in the
[1:58] house of the Lord today Hallelujah
[2:00] Matthew uh
[2:01] 12:24 and then we'll skip down to 31
[2:05] Matthew 12 this is a prominent chapter
[2:08] for uh demonology chapter 12 of Matthew
[2:11] Jesus explains how each one of us is
[2:13] like a house we looked at how we're a
[2:14] temple of the Holy Ghost on Wednesday
[2:16] night Hallelujah the sanctity of the
[2:18] body um but here in this chapter Jesus
[2:21] says exactly how demons come in it's
[2:23] when we let uh an evil thought paralyze
[2:25] our faith when we let a demon come in a
[2:29] evil thought or something like that
[2:30] it'll weaken our it'll completely
[2:32] paralyze our faith and we don't fight
[2:34] back we just accept this evil spirit uh
[2:37] but we know Jesus Christ is stronger
[2:39] than any demon power hallelujah amen and
[2:41] all we got to do is uh brother Ram said
[2:43] all we got to do is uh tell Satan his
[2:46] legal rights Hallelujah because Jesus
[2:49] already condemned all those demons on
[2:51] the cross and so all we have to do is
[2:53] claim our legal rights we have to say
[2:55] Jesus forgive me of my sins forgive me
[2:57] of accepting this evil thought or this
[2:59] evil evil action forgive me and then the
[3:01] demon on legal grounds he has to leave
[3:04] because you are God's Property
[3:05] hallelujah amen glory to God that's what
[3:07] this chapter uh says a great Revelation
[3:10] here in Matthew 12 we've looking at how
[3:14] you know also um you know overcoming the
[3:16] snares of the devil praise God so this
[3:18] will tie really good with that by God's
[3:20] grace Matthew
[3:22] 12 24 here is actually uh an example of
[3:27] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost well I'm
[3:29] sorry blasphemy of the son of man and
[3:31] then Jesus says if they would continue
[3:32] this uh this type of wording when the
[3:35] Holy Ghost came then they would blashe
[3:36] the Holy Ghost so here's blasphemy of
[3:38] the son of man verse 24 but when the
[3:41] Pharisees heard it they said this fellow
[3:43] doth not cast out Devils but by
[3:45] Beelzebub he it's the prince of the
[3:48] Devils so they called uh basically they
[3:51] called Satan Beelzebub there in this
[3:53] time now verse 31 let's go down there to
[3:56] verse 31
[4:01] wherefore I say unto you all manner of
[4:02] sin of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
[4:05] men but the blasphemy against the Holy
[4:07] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and
[4:10] whosoever speaketh a word against the
[4:12] son of man it shall be G forgiven him
[4:14] that's why Jesus on the cross said
[4:15] father forgive them they don't know what
[4:17] they're
[4:18] doing but whosoever speaketh against the
[4:21] Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[4:23] neither in this world neither in the
[4:25] world to come let's have one more word
[4:27] of prayer if you have a need on your
[4:28] heart let's make it known unto God today
[4:30] Father God we thank you for the word of
[4:32] God today we thank you that we're born
[4:33] again of the word of God that
[4:35] Incorruptible seed Peter tells us in
[4:37] First Peter 1 123 hallelujah we're born
[4:40] again of The Incorruptible seed the word
[4:42] of God in other words we know we're the
[4:43] seed of God we're the children of God
[4:46] and so Lord we come here today Lord God
[4:47] to declare your word to hear your word
[4:49] to be inspired by the word of God
[4:51] hallelujah minister to every need today
[4:53] Lord God and I just pray Lord the uh the
[4:56] inspiration you given to me Lord it'll
[4:57] be shared to the people to streng them
[5:00] Lord as a pastor I come here to feed the
[5:01] flock the word of God Lord God here I
[5:04] stand at my post of Duty and I know
[5:05] you're at your post of Duty Lord God you
[5:07] keep all your appointments Lord God and
[5:09] Lord we know you're here you said
[5:10] wherever two or three in the midst Lord
[5:12] I'll be there as well so Lord we know
[5:14] you're here today Lord Jesus so make
[5:15] your presence known here today we ask
[5:17] you Lord God and minister to all the
[5:19] needs of the church I pray in the name
[5:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church
[5:23] said amen God bless you as you're being
[5:25] seated
[5:30] so again you know uh the kind of
[5:32] inspiration behind this was a question
[5:33] on email but this is very related to
[5:35] brother brandom's uh sermon on the mark
[5:37] of the beast and the Seal of God every
[5:40] person think about that all the
[5:41] trillions of well maybe billions all the
[5:44] billions or trillions of people down
[5:45] through the years everyone was marked
[5:47] with something when they died they were
[5:49] marked with unbelief in the soul and
[5:51] they were the serpent seed or they are
[5:53] marked with the Seal of God the holy
[5:55] spirit so every person uh has to be on
[5:58] one side or the other I'm so glad I'm on
[6:00] the side of the king of the king of
[6:01] Heaven and Earth Hallelujah the Lord
[6:03] Jesus Christ I'm so glad he's marked me
[6:05] and made me his own hallelujah thank God
[6:08] for his Mercy now this is a a very good
[6:11] again a very good uh chapter here
[6:13] Matthew 2 I'm sorry Matthew
[6:15] 12 they uh the Pharisees of course
[6:18] blashe the son of man in verse 24 as we
[6:20] read but Jesus instantly corrects them
[6:22] in verse 26 he said Satan cannot cast
[6:24] out Satan because every house against
[6:27] itself is divided Hallelujah and then
[6:30] the kingdom can't stand so there's uh
[6:33] there's a truth there Satan cannot heal
[6:36] uh anyone who's demon possessed with
[6:38] another demon Satan will not cast out
[6:40] Satan a demon cannot cast out another
[6:42] demon only the spirit of God can cast
[6:44] out a demon Hallelujah and so we see it
[6:47] playing the scripture uh by God's
[6:50] grace in verse 29 here we get this this
[6:53] demonology that you and I uh have to
[6:56] fight in our we would say in our minds
[6:58] not our souls cuz our souls are sealed
[7:00] by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and God
[7:03] sealed in Satan sealed out so this this
[7:07] illustration here is the illustration of
[7:09] the human mind now now for those that uh
[7:12] are lost yes then Satan will come into
[7:13] their soul right we know it's Faith or
[7:15] unbelief in other words it's the holy
[7:16] ghost or unbelief the spirit of death
[7:18] right it's either either one because
[7:20] there was just like there was two trees
[7:21] in the garden right life and death
[7:23] Hallelujah so it's one or the other but
[7:25] here in 29 now we get into the
[7:27] demonology how can one enter a strong
[7:29] man's house so think about that when you
[7:32] first believed think how strong you were
[7:34] in the faith oh I love Jesus so much I'm
[7:36] a real Christian now I'm going to read
[7:38] my Bible I'm going to sing I'm going to
[7:39] pray I'm going to testify I'm gonna do
[7:40] everything I can what why was that
[7:42] because you're strong in your house
[7:44] Hallelujah you've got a strength you've
[7:46] got a power in your house but what what
[7:48] do we know happens after a while after A
[7:51] While You Know The Enemy knows how to
[7:52] work on us uh as we preached a few weeks
[7:54] ago for 6,000 years he's watched man and
[7:56] he sees how we get into our routines
[7:58] we're creatures of habit and he sees how
[8:00] he can kind of break into our routine
[8:02] and break into our thoughts and try to
[8:04] distract us and and he always makes sin
[8:06] look so beautiful like oh this will be
[8:09] okay right rarely do we ever sin where
[8:11] we know something awful something just
[8:14] extremely uh Wicked very very rarely is
[8:17] it that case he's got to bring something
[8:19] across where looks like oh it'd be okay
[8:20] to just do a little of
[8:22] that and so that's how Satan Works he
[8:25] tries to get into our house and if he
[8:27] gets into our minds and our thoughts
[8:29] then he can bind up the strong man he
[8:31] can brother M says he paralyzes our
[8:33] faith and so that our faith doesn't work
[8:35] our faith doesn't control the house
[8:38] anymore and think about that someone
[8:40] that uh someone that has a complex or
[8:43] someone that has a evil spear or some
[8:45] like that they don't their house doesn't
[8:47] uh it's not run the right way the
[8:49] strength of the Lord isn't in their life
[8:51] and you can kind of tell they're not as
[8:52] strong as they used to be what happened
[8:54] their face been
[8:56] paralyzed and it could just be in their
[8:58] mind right what do you have to be their
[9:00] soul just in their
[9:02] mind and so Jesus gives us some
[9:04] wonderful teaching here on demonology he
[9:07] first has to bind the strong
[9:09] man Hallelujah and then he'll spoil
[9:12] he'll Rob and brother says uh David
[9:15] didn't lose his salvation he just lost
[9:17] the joy of his
[9:18] salvation so that that that evil spirit
[9:21] that we allow in our minds we get an
[9:22] evil thought or an evil sin that we did
[9:25] if we don't confess it it'll start
[9:27] taking away all of our good things in
[9:29] our life
[9:29] all of our faith our virtue our
[9:31] knowledge our Temperance our godliness
[9:33] our brotherly kindness we're impatient
[9:35] takes all of our patience we're
[9:36] impatient with people now now we've all
[9:38] seen it Church you let's not act like
[9:39] we're Angels today Hallelujah right
[9:41] we've all been impatient at times we've
[9:43] all said the wrong thing we all did and
[9:45] sometimes we didn't show brotherly
[9:46] kindness to our brothers or
[9:48] sisters and what was it it was we open
[9:51] the door uh to our home and we let an
[9:53] evil spirit in and it bound up that
[9:55] brotherly
[9:56] kindness and the only way to get the
[9:58] power back is to confess our sin Lord
[10:01] forgive me I let that evil thought in I
[10:04] harbored that evil action it was my
[10:06] choice it was my own sin and then we
[10:08] pray the prayer of David create in me a
[10:11] clean heart oh God and restore the joy
[10:14] bring the spoils back bring the joy back
[10:17] bring the victory back bring the love
[10:19] back bring the patience back bring it
[10:21] all back let me be strong again for the
[10:23] glory of
[10:26] God so we get a great lesson here on
[10:29] demonology it's so
[10:31] important now verse 33 this is this is
[10:33] why uh in Jesus day it was such a
[10:35] mystery it's still a m mystery today
[10:37] brother Ram said Spirits don't die but
[10:39] men
[10:40] do so these spirits today will be just
[10:43] like well there's brother Chris God
[10:44] bless you sir good to see you brother we
[10:46] I just prayed for you brother Hallelujah
[10:49] verse 33 now look what Jesus says either
[10:51] make the tree good and his fruit good or
[10:53] else make the tree corrupt and his fruit
[10:55] corrupt for the tree is known by his
[10:57] fruit oh generation vipers how can ye
[11:00] being evil speak good things for out of
[11:03] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[11:05] speaketh so Jesus explaining here this
[11:07] is uh we would say true hypocrisy they
[11:10] speak good things think think of that
[11:12] they speak they speak the prophets
[11:14] quotes they're quoting uh they're
[11:15] quoting Moses just like people today can
[11:18] quote brother brandham quote Paul quote
[11:21] Jeremiah all these wonderful prophets of
[11:23] God they can quote it but they you got
[11:26] to be careful what do the other words
[11:27] say what else are they quoting
[11:30] Hallelujah you got to take inventory of
[11:32] the full P the full actions of the
[11:35] person so see these Pharisees they would
[11:37] speak good things in the temple uh of
[11:39] course they would Minister brother R say
[11:40] oh they had their kind old priest they
[11:41] would let you borrow money uh they would
[11:43] go pray they dedicate your babies they
[11:45] would do all these things kind old
[11:47] priest but then when it come to Jesus
[11:49] and his miracles brother Chris we were
[11:50] texting about that verse today right or
[11:52] this week we were texting about this
[11:53] verse Matthew 12 we read in Matthew 12
[11:56] but then when they see Jesus do the
[11:58] Miracles they get feared fearful because
[12:00] they see the power of God on Jesus but
[12:02] they don't have it in their
[12:04] Ministry so brother and and remember
[12:07] John 3:2 Nicodemus says we know you're a
[12:11] teacher sent from God so those Pharisees
[12:14] knew God was with
[12:16] Jesus but as brother bam will eventually
[12:18] tell us I'll eventually get to this
[12:19] brother bam said because of their
[12:20] tradition and because they wanted to
[12:22] keep the structure and they wanted to
[12:24] keep the power of their church and their
[12:26] Traditions going they blasphemed the son
[12:28] of man
[12:30] Hallelujah and eventually they would
[12:32] blaspheme the Holy Ghost when the Holy
[12:34] Ghost Came Upon uh the apostles in the
[12:36] book of Acts Hallelujah we see it
[12:38] multiple times especially in Acts 13
[12:40] we're not going to read it now but
[12:41] there's Jews that were listening to Paul
[12:42] preach and they blasphemed the things
[12:44] Paul said and Paul said because you
[12:46] blasphemed I go to the
[12:48] Gentiles
[12:50] Hallelujah so it's quite a it's quite a
[12:52] thing here now uh in verse 20 now 36 I
[12:56] want to just deal with this just for a
[12:58] moment here by God's grace look at
[13:00] Matthew 12:36 so Jesus is talking about
[13:02] the very height of hypocrisy are these
[13:05] Pharisees they follow all these laws of
[13:07] the prophets they they act so religious
[13:09] and spiritual but when the word of God
[13:11] the present word of God comes to them
[13:13] they blaspheme it verse 36 but I say
[13:17] unto you that Every Idle word that men
[13:18] shall speak they shall give account
[13:20] thereof in the day of
[13:23] judgment now people have used this the
[13:25] wrong way they've used this against the
[13:27] bride but Church you can't use this
[13:30] against the bride cuz the Bible said who
[13:33] shall lay any charge to God's elect
[13:36] Hallelujah in other words we've U we've
[13:38] all uttered awful words but if we're the
[13:41] CH children of God if we've confessed
[13:43] all of our sins if we have faith in
[13:44] Jesus Christ if we're filled with the
[13:46] Holy Ghost then Jesus has dropped the
[13:48] charges amen he sent all the sins in the
[13:51] sea of forgetfulness
[13:54] Hallelujah no one shall l no one will
[13:56] accuse a child of God in heaven no devil
[13:58] will in fact we'll judge them Hallelujah
[14:01] we just preached it on Wednesday night
[14:02] Hallelujah we'll judge Angels we'll
[14:04] judge the world praise God because we've
[14:07] accepted the the sanctifying grace the
[14:09] Forgiveness the pardoning grace of the
[14:12] blood of Jesus Christ so this is
[14:14] referring uh here uh this is referring
[14:16] to the Pharisees they're the ones that
[14:19] their words will be judged upon them
[14:22] because they failed to receive the word
[14:24] of God hallelujah remember Church don't
[14:27] forget Colossians 2 one of the most
[14:28] beautiful trap chapters on the blood of
[14:30] Jesus Christ the Bible said God took all
[14:32] the handwriting that was against us and
[14:34] nailed it to Jesus's cross and what did
[14:37] Jesus pronounced afterwards he said it
[14:39] is paid in full in other words I paid
[14:42] for all of Austin sins I paid for all of
[14:45] Chris's sins I prayed for all of aaan
[14:47] sins it's paid in full Hallelujah fully
[14:51] paid
[14:52] Hallelujah so any Idol word we speak yes
[14:55] we we'll deal with the the we'll deal
[14:57] with the chastisement of it now but
[14:59] there's no condemnation to them that are
[15:01] in Christ Jesus
[15:03] Hallelujah that's
[15:06] right John 5:24 says we have already
[15:09] passed he that believeth on me he said
[15:11] we've already passed from Death unto
[15:14] life am so we won't have to give an
[15:16] account of any Idle Words because we're
[15:19] already forgiven of them Hallelujah
[15:21] there's no condemnation Roman 81 Romans
[15:24] 81 there's no condemnation to them that
[15:26] walk in the spirit and not after the
[15:28] flesh Hallelujah
[15:29] and Romans 8:33 there who shall lay any
[15:32] charge to God's elect no man
[15:36] shall now what I believe church is that
[15:38] though if we utter words and and we say
[15:41] things wrong uh and we get in a really
[15:44] bad awful complex I believe we can lose
[15:46] reward but we can never lose
[15:50] salvation because remember there there's
[15:52] there there's there's a three level of
[15:53] towns Five Towns Two Towns one toal now
[15:56] God has just given us an example there
[15:57] there's all these levels
[15:59] and then the Bible also says uh that we
[16:02] could lose reward but still be saved uh
[16:04] go to 2 John 1:8 a case you can pull it
[16:07] up 2 John 1
[16:10] ver8 look to yourselves that we lose not
[16:13] those things which we have wrought but
[16:15] we receive a full
[16:17] reward uh also in the church ages I
[16:19] don't know I don't remember the verse
[16:20] but Jesus says uh let no man take your
[16:23] crown so each one of you have a battle
[16:25] to fight Glory right Brothers You Love
[16:27] battles right all you Brothers got a
[16:30] battle to fight you sisters too each one
[16:32] of you have a crown you can win but
[16:34] you've got to fight it the right way you
[16:36] got to fight it by the word of God
[16:38] hallelujah and not get discouraged and
[16:40] not let the enemy steal your reward and
[16:42] and not attack the the family of God or
[16:44] something like that you've got to stay
[16:46] with the word of God and you can earn a
[16:48] full reward hallelujah amen but you can
[16:51] still lose all your reward and still be
[16:53] saved 1 Corinthians 3:16 in case you
[16:56] want to pull that up there 1 Corinthians
[16:58] 3:16
[17:00] I'm sorry it's 14 and 15 1 Corinthians
[17:02] 3:14 and
[17:04] 15 if any man's work abide which he hath
[17:07] built thereon he shall receive a reward
[17:09] verse 15 if any man's work shall be
[17:11] burned he shall suffer loss but he
[17:13] himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
[17:18] Hallelujah now there's a story I don't
[17:21] know if you've heard it it's in one of
[17:22] uh it's in the the book a prophet visits
[17:24] South Africa when brother random first
[17:26] went to South Africa most of us know
[17:28] what happened if we've read through his
[17:29] his his life story he took the wrong
[17:33] itinerary the Holy Ghost had to go to a
[17:35] certain place and just wait there go
[17:37] hunting and then come back to Durban I
[17:39] believe it was but these these uh
[17:41] denominational preachers had we're going
[17:43] to this little church this little church
[17:44] and and and uh brother random actually
[17:47] uh he says he disobeyed the angel of the
[17:50] Lord and in in the in the book The
[17:52] Prophet visit South Africa I think it
[17:54] was brother R told I think it was Sydney
[17:56] Smith I'm not mistaken he said the angel
[17:58] Lord also said I would have given you
[18:00] this whole nation if you would have just
[18:02] kept the right
[18:05] itinerary okay so in other words brother
[18:07] Ram saying brother Ram saying I could
[18:09] have influenced this whole nation more
[18:10] for the Gospel of Jesus Christ but I
[18:12] made a
[18:13] mistake Hallelujah and church we're not
[18:16] doubting brother random we all make
[18:18] mistakes but the point is we have we
[18:20] have such a high reward we can attain to
[18:23] we must be faithful with it
[18:25] Hallelujah let's be faithful remember
[18:27] Saul Saul lost the king forever for
[18:29] Jonathan and his family he lost that
[18:31] forever because of
[18:33] Disobedience so what should we do Church
[18:35] look to ourselves let's look at our
[18:36] lives brother Ram's already lived he's
[18:38] already gained the reward he's already
[18:39] been faithful now it's our turn to do
[18:41] something now it's our ministry God help
[18:43] us to achieve a full reward by the grace
[18:46] of
[18:47] God and think about that all because
[18:50] brother Ram took the wrong itinerary it
[18:52] wasn't drugs it wasn't smoking it wasn't
[18:54] drinking it wasn't women it was he took
[18:56] the wrong itinerary
[19:00] listen Church to he who much is given
[19:03] much is
[19:05] required for those of us in the message
[19:07] we have a higher calling than we'd say
[19:10] nominal churches because we know more of
[19:12] the word of God hallelujah we know the
[19:15] truth of God's word so we must be
[19:18] faithful we must understand that God
[19:20] wants us to obey in every little area in
[19:23] fact that's the test if we can obey the
[19:24] little things God will make us rule over
[19:26] much
[19:27] Hallelujah now we're encouraged by
[19:29] Brother Ram later on remember uh uh
[19:32] Danny Henry speaks in tongues in that
[19:34] cafeteria and said a huge portion of
[19:36] Heaven awaits thee because you've chosen
[19:38] my way the harder way Amen brother Jose
[19:41] Hallelujah God gave him a greater reward
[19:44] in heaven because he took the way with
[19:46] the Lord's despise few that's the way
[19:49] I'm taken today too Hallelujah I know
[19:51] you are too by God's grace
[19:55] Hallelujah now so we can see here I want
[19:57] to um this person asked me what exactly
[20:00] is uh blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
[20:02] blasphemy is speaking reproachfully
[20:05] against the holy ghost in the Greek
[20:07] blasphemy means to speak reproachfully
[20:10] rail at or revile revile means to
[20:13] criticize harshly abusively or
[20:17] insult that's blasphemy of the Holy
[20:20] Ghost it's insulting God or the Holy
[20:23] Ghost it's abusing God's
[20:26] name right
[20:31] it's uh Jesus says blasphemy or
[20:33] criticism of the Holy Ghost is an
[20:35] unforgivable sin God will never forgive
[20:38] a person for that now what I found
[20:41] interesting Church uh I was I watched a
[20:43] ray Comfort video you know Living Waters
[20:45] y'all like Ray comfor he's good for for
[20:47] a good for a non- message preacher he's
[20:49] a pretty good preacher
[20:50] Hallelujah but he he he brought this out
[20:53] the Los Angeles Fire started on January
[20:56] 7th two days before that Hollywood had
[20:59] the 82nd annual Golden Globe
[21:04] awards it's the first time a woman
[21:06] hosted the Golden Globe Awards and after
[21:09] a while I think they had like they they'
[21:10] done through like 15 Awards after a
[21:12] while the host comes up and says let's
[21:14] make a running tally and you can watch
[21:16] the video running tally of all the
[21:18] people that have been thanked the first
[21:19] 11 people thank their co-workers The
[21:22] Producers uh three people thank their
[21:24] mom and the woman said look how many
[21:26] thank God zero and everybody laughed she
[21:31] said how many have thanking God the
[21:32] creator of the universe and everybody
[21:34] laughs and mocks God two days later Los
[21:37] Angeles
[21:39] burns the Bible said God will not be
[21:42] mocked now how many years have they how
[21:45] many years have they mocked God over and
[21:48] over and over and over again brother
[21:51] Chris did you want to share something
[21:52] brother
[22:07] wow wow that's very good yeah yeah you
[22:10] can share it with me too if you get I
[22:12] forget you share it with me very good
[22:14] yeah there certain times God will lay
[22:15] out specific judgments upon individuals
[22:18] because they should know better right by
[22:22] so two days later it's almost uh has
[22:26] like I said 100 no 12,000 buildings
[22:28] think of that 12,000 homes and buildings
[22:32] schools all burnt down to the ground oh
[22:34] yes and I was I watched a video from
[22:36] that Ray comfort and Ray Comfort showed
[22:38] a a a reporter she's driving through the
[22:40] fires and she says it's like we're
[22:42] driving through hell I'm not using I'm
[22:45] using that in the correct way and
[22:47] brother R said brother Ram quotes the
[22:49] scripture where capernium will be
[22:51] brought down to Hell and brother R said
[22:53] Los Angeles you'll be brought down to
[22:55] Hell I just think it's now brother
[22:58] talking about under the ocean but I just
[22:59] think it's very fitting brother said Los
[23:01] Angeles you'll be brought down to Hell
[23:03] and then people go through there it's
[23:05] like we're in
[23:07] Hell see this is the mercy of God give
[23:10] them one more chance this is the heart
[23:11] of God give them another chance give
[23:13] them another chance just like God gives
[23:15] us multiple chances Hallelujah this is
[23:17] the mercy of God this is the love of God
[23:20] hallelujah trying to shake people and
[23:22] wake them up and get them to stop
[23:24] thinking about the temporal things but
[23:25] think about things that are above
[23:27] Hallelujah
[23:29] oh
[23:31] yes let me give you a simple definition
[23:33] of how brother Ram
[23:35] uh defines blasphemy of the Holy Ghost
[23:37] right out of Matthew 12 here brother bam
[23:40] said notice the difference between the
[23:41] Pharisees and the woman at the well in
[23:43] John chapter
[23:44] 4 even in her adulterous condition she'd
[23:48] slept with at least six different men
[23:50] live with them and these Pharisees had
[23:52] been faithful in their marriages their
[23:53] whole lives well maybe we don't know but
[23:56] they at least acted like it publicly
[23:59] and brother yet she knew more about God
[24:02] and recognized Jesus more than all the
[24:05] scribes and Pharisees
[24:07] Hallelujah because when they seen this
[24:09] done by Jesus they declared a Beelzebub
[24:12] a chief of devils that's a fortune
[24:15] teller brother man said my mother used
[24:18] to tell me when I was a little boy
[24:19] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost was to take
[24:21] your own life so brother man's mom would
[24:23] say suicide is the blasphemy of the Holy
[24:25] Ghost brother said well that isn't so we
[24:28] we appreciate mom we appreciate Dad we
[24:30] appreciate Grandma I appreciate my
[24:31] previous Pastor I appreciate all this
[24:33] but we need the word of God
[24:35] hallelujah we can all be corrected by
[24:37] the word of God me
[24:39] too brother man said no the Bible
[24:41] teaches blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
[24:43] it's a speak against the Holy Spirit to
[24:46] blasphemy is to talk about when you see
[24:48] the Holy Spirit do something and make
[24:50] fun of it you've crossed a line that
[24:51] you'll never cross back again it'll
[24:53] never be forgiven
[24:56] you and so Jesus had told them he was
[24:59] telling them how he'd been confirming
[25:00] the word and he was the Messiah and they
[25:02] should have known him because of
[25:05] Deuteronomy 18 the Lord God shall raise
[25:06] up a prophet liken unto me Moses said
[25:09] and that was
[25:10] Jesus he says and brother B said I
[25:13] believe the Pharisees belied him but
[25:15] they did not want to confess it because
[25:17] their traditions because of the
[25:19] Pharisees had said any man or woman that
[25:21] would accept him would immediately be
[25:22] put out of the synagogue that's in the
[25:24] Book of John and they love their
[25:26] Traditions more than they love the
[25:28] Vindicated word of God that's like today
[25:31] most churches they love women painting
[25:33] their faces more than God vindicating
[25:35] his
[25:36] word they love uh marrying two three
[25:39] times being adulterers they love getting
[25:41] drunk uh and still going to church more
[25:43] than they love the truth of God's holy
[25:45] word hallelujah they'd rather have
[25:48] that and some of them don't know it but
[25:50] if they speak against the word of God
[25:51] for their hour they'll blashe the Holy
[25:53] Ghost and not even
[25:56] care now want lay this in I want to tie
[25:59] this together so everybody can see this
[26:00] here plainly I I want to tie in some
[26:02] terminology terminology is very
[26:04] important because brother Ram said I
[26:06] used to think the new birth and the
[26:07] baptism were two separate things now I
[26:09] believe they're one and the same and
[26:11] there's that's still a great confusion
[26:12] in message in some message churches but
[26:15] let me tie some uh terminology together
[26:18] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost is the same
[26:20] as someone taking the mark of the
[26:22] beast it's the same thing brother said
[26:24] Cain's Mark has been here this whole
[26:27] time Cain was marked physically but
[26:30] really he was marked
[26:32] spiritually brother said God's two marks
[26:35] have always been here
[26:36] hallelujah in other words uh Abel was a
[26:39] a Son of God right Seth was a Son of God
[26:41] Adam and Eve all these were children of
[26:43] God they were marked in a spiritual way
[26:46] that's right
[26:47] Hallelujah now after Pentecost that's
[26:49] when you could receive the seal in your
[26:51] soul before that uh it was just you're
[26:54] saved in your spirit Hallelujah because
[26:57] the blood of Jesus Christ had not been
[26:59] shed yet it could not forgive all his
[27:01] sins it just covered over sins we know
[27:04] that and so uh we see it so even from
[27:06] the beginning with Adam and Eve and Cain
[27:08] and Abel both marks have continued on
[27:11] throughout all of
[27:13] history so when brother Rand will say a
[27:16] person he says this has crossed the
[27:18] separating line he's talking about
[27:20] someone who has made their final
[27:22] decision and they're going to become a
[27:24] reprobate and take the mark of the beast
[27:27] and never go to hungering after God ever
[27:30] again so all these three things are the
[27:33] same when someone's blasting the Holy
[27:35] Ghost that's the same as they've been
[27:37] marked with the mark of the
[27:39] beast right it's also the same as you
[27:42] are a reprobate which means a rejected
[27:46] mind Hallelujah that's all those are all
[27:49] the same now in the tribulation yes
[27:51] Satan is going to have the Antichrist
[27:53] lay down the mark of the beast it'll be
[27:55] in the hand or the forehead or you can
[27:57] take the name of the Beast or the number
[27:58] of his Beast there's all these different
[28:00] ways to take the mark of the
[28:02] beast but that's like a physical marker
[28:04] that's like the final Mark but before
[28:06] all these uh judgments get poured out
[28:09] you know uh the trumpets and the vows
[28:11] and the woes and all these things that's
[28:13] that final Mark that the Antichrist lays
[28:15] down but the mark of the beast has
[28:16] always been here thank God the mark of
[28:18] God has always been here hallelujah amen
[28:22] glory to God God's always marked his
[28:24] children amen you now you shall know my
[28:26] disciples because of their love what one
[28:28] for another
[28:30] Hallelujah glory to God if there's
[28:33] someone in here you haven't loved it's
[28:34] time you better go to loving them
[28:35] Hallelujah forgiving them thanking them
[28:38] being a blessing to them be good to them
[28:41] help them out with their needs love one
[28:43] another because that's one of the proofs
[28:45] you're a child of God
[28:47] hallelujah that's right Church
[28:50] Hallelujah now this is a little deeper
[28:52] than of course uh it's a deeper
[28:54] understanding I believe as times goes on
[28:55] God gives us more revelation
[28:59] all right so we can see that the mark of
[29:02] the beast has always been here now one
[29:04] of what I like to do is I like to go
[29:05] over all these uh reprobate scriptures
[29:08] because that's the verse if you need a
[29:11] Bible term for cross the separating line
[29:14] between mercy and judgment right there's
[29:16] this imaginary line in people's lives
[29:18] and they'll come up so far or they'll
[29:20] come so close to to going over to the
[29:22] devil's side or God's side now the
[29:24] people that go to the devil's side most
[29:25] people will go to the devil's side
[29:29] brother said that line when that person
[29:31] makes their final decision they've
[29:32] crossed over from Mercy into judgment
[29:36] and Paul says you've judged
[29:38] yourself a reprobate in other words
[29:41] you've sent yourself to hell and God
[29:43] just allows you to go to where you want
[29:45] to go and the church said but R said God
[29:49] don't send you to hell you send yourself
[29:51] to Hell let's let's read that uh it's
[29:53] acts
[29:56] 13 you've judged yourself Unworthy of
[30:00] everlasting
[30:09] life yeah there it is uh it's verse 46
[30:13] acts
[30:17] 1346 actually let's go to 45 Paul's
[30:20] preaching on the Sabbath day that was
[30:21] his day to do debates with the Jews is
[30:23] that something the Jews would want to
[30:25] debate every Sabbath Day verse 45 and
[30:28] when the Jews saw the multitudes they
[30:29] were filled with Envy evil spirit right
[30:32] evil spirit of
[30:33] envy and spake against those things
[30:36] which were spoken by Paul contradicting
[30:38] them so if they said Jesus Son of God
[30:40] they say Jesus was beo they
[30:43] blasphemed Jesus Is A Healer no Satan
[30:45] was healing them they blasphemed they
[30:48] contradict him and
[30:50] blaspheme so what does Paul saying verse
[30:52] 46 now church this something I'm going
[30:54] to get to towards the end
[30:56] here when we determin people of
[30:58] blasphemy we must make sure we're led by
[31:00] the Holy Spirit to to know and I I think
[31:04] that's how most of us act I don't hear
[31:06] many of you ever saying well I told this
[31:07] person they blaspheme and I'm not even
[31:08] going to pray I've never heard anybody
[31:10] say that here that's a good thing that
[31:12] shows you're mature right immature
[31:14] babies would try to act like they're
[31:15] prophets and I can judge you to hell and
[31:17] I I I I can determine you don't you're
[31:19] you blasphemed or you'll be saved you
[31:20] won't that'd be someone who immature
[31:22] they're on a power trip they're on a
[31:24] pride trip I'll say like that but thank
[31:27] God there's some mature people were by
[31:28] the grace of God here
[31:30] hallelujah verse 46 then Paul and
[31:33] Barnabas waxed bold so see the Holy
[31:35] Spirit waxed bold the Holy Spirit gave
[31:36] him this
[31:37] boldness and said it was necessary that
[31:40] the word of God should first have been
[31:41] spoken to you but seeing you put it from
[31:43] yourselves and you judge yourselves
[31:47] Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn
[31:50] to the
[31:51] Gentiles so here here we see God is
[31:54] showing us they're taking their free
[31:56] moral agency people that want to go to
[31:58] hell they want to go to hell they're
[32:00] sending themselves to hell and all you
[32:03] can do like Paul is just preach the word
[32:05] tell the truth tell the truth and all
[32:07] that the father has given me will come
[32:09] to me Hallelujah and all that's ordained
[32:11] to life will come all those that are
[32:13] ordained to death they'll blaspheme and
[32:15] fall away but by the grace of God we can
[32:18] know we're the elect We're The Chosen
[32:20] we're the children of God and we keep
[32:22] declaring God's words of Life Hallelujah
[32:27] see brother says God don't send them to
[32:29] hell they send themselves to
[32:35] hell look at their Idol words see
[32:36] they'll be judged by their Idol words oh
[32:39] Paul was Blas Paul was contradicting all
[32:41] these Paul was contradicting the
[32:42] Pharisees and all these things they'll
[32:44] be judged for those Idle Words they
[32:46] didn't know what they didn't really know
[32:47] what they were
[32:49] saying all right now we can see it
[32:51] plainly okay now let's read through some
[32:53] reprobate scriptures here by God's grace
[32:56] there's not many I think there's only
[32:57] one two 2 3 4 5 6 7 so Jeremiah 6:30 I'm
[33:00] in chapter in the 40s right now I can't
[33:03] remember which maybe 30s but anyways
[33:06] Jeremiah 6:30 this is the first
[33:07] reprobate scripture there's I think
[33:09] there's eight if I'm not
[33:11] mistaken so okay I'm gonna have you go
[33:13] boom boom we'll get a lot of scriptures
[33:15] here by God's grace Jeremiah 6:30
[33:17] reprobate silver shall men call them
[33:19] because the Lord hath rejected them so
[33:20] see what does repr probate mean rejected
[33:22] mine so God's going to call all those
[33:25] who reject rejected him he's going to
[33:27] call them reprobates
[33:30] rejected right this is uh this is the
[33:33] part I reject
[33:35] right so any unbeliever is a reprobate
[33:39] that's that's God's final term for them
[33:41] in fact brother man tells us God's final
[33:43] term is you're either elected chosen to
[33:45] life or you're rejected and that fits
[33:48] Paul says we're all vessels either unto
[33:50] honor or
[33:52] dishonor hallelujah we're either elect
[33:54] or chosen before the foundation world or
[33:56] we're not or we're reprobate the
[33:58] rejected group oh thank God if God's
[34:00] ever heard your prayer if God's ever
[34:02] given you Mercy thank God you're one of
[34:04] God's elect Hallelujah you were chosen
[34:06] to Salvation if God ever brought you to
[34:08] repentance and you recognize the
[34:10] wickedness of your sin and you felt
[34:12] sorry for your sin and you wanted to
[34:13] follow God's way you ought to thank God
[34:15] that you're elected to eternal life
[34:17] Hallelujah and God didn't reject your
[34:19] life God didn't let you go off into the
[34:20] world but God kept calling you back in
[34:22] fact Jesus went to find you he left the
[34:24] 99 he left the aaran Saints he went to
[34:27] find you and brought you back to the
[34:28] fold hallelujah praise God Amen he
[34:31] leaves a 99 to go get the one
[34:34] Hallelujah not rejected accepted in the
[34:36] Beloved
[34:38] Hallelujah God's accepted our prayers in
[34:40] heaven God's accepted our worship God's
[34:42] accepted our repentance Hallelujah he
[34:45] has not rejected it
[34:50] Hallelujah now Romans 1:28 now this is
[34:53] spoken in context mainly of
[34:55] homosexuals but we've seen I've seen
[34:57] seen a homosexual man come to the truth
[35:01] hallelujah so this just means
[35:02] homosexuals that have already crossed
[35:04] that line that means there's some
[35:05] homosexuals that haven't crossed that
[35:07] line and they're going to run from that
[35:08] line they're going to run to Jesus we
[35:10] just saw it on on Wednesday 1
[35:12] Corinthians 6 says you were abusers of
[35:15] yourself with mankind you were
[35:17] homosexual you were thieves revivers you
[35:20] were these things but now you're Washed
[35:22] by the spirit of our God and the name of
[35:24] our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:26] Hallelujah hallelujah praise God that's
[35:29] what the gospel does it takes you so far
[35:31] away from that line and it sends you
[35:32] into the Open Arms of the Bountiful
[35:35] father
[35:36] above glory to
[35:43] God now here's here's a sign of someone
[35:46] that has already crossed the line
[35:49] they'll never be saved they do not like
[35:53] God's knowledge in their
[35:55] minds they don't want to think about God
[35:57] truth and they just want to they just
[35:59] want to speak against
[36:01] God see the fact that you love your
[36:03] Bible that shows you're elect of
[36:06] God and you and you want God's Bible to
[36:08] help you that shows you're a child of
[36:10] God I like those
[36:13] amens so see when people re cross that
[36:17] line between mercy and judgment and they
[36:19] make that final line God gives them over
[36:21] in other words God says I've tried I
[36:22] tried I know this is the last time you
[36:24] won it I'm so the Bible says God wishes
[36:26] that none should perish
[36:28] God doesn't Delight the death of the
[36:30] wicked so he says okay I'll give you
[36:32] over and I'm not going to deal with you
[36:34] anymore he gives them over to rejected
[36:36] mind to do those things which are not
[36:39] convenient in this case it's
[36:41] homosexuality not convenient not
[36:43] according to God's
[36:45] design
[36:47] Hallelujah now next one 2 Corinthians 13
[36:51] 5-7 2 Corinthians 13
[36:56] 5-7 examine yourselves whether you be in
[36:58] the faith prove your own selves know ye
[37:01] not that ye our own selves how that
[37:03] Jesus Christ be in you except you be
[37:05] reprobates I love this but I trust that
[37:08] ye shall know that we are
[37:10] not uh reprobates so Paul gives this
[37:13] great word and who gets it the
[37:15] Corinthian Church this church we've been
[37:17] looking at this was one of the most
[37:19] fanatical churches I've ever heard
[37:21] of they had all the tongues brother van
[37:24] all the interpretations all they had so
[37:26] many gifts operation in but yet they got
[37:29] drunk at the Lord's table and men would
[37:31] sleep around with their stepmoms they'd
[37:33] Sue each
[37:34] other they rejected Paul as a prophet
[37:37] almost they were some of the most loose
[37:40] cannons they were some of the most baby
[37:43] Christians you could ever imagine and
[37:45] yet Paul is telling them humble yourself
[37:48] examine your life Christ has to be in
[37:51] you or you're a
[37:53] reprobate so see church we got to open
[37:55] ourselves up and say God pour in your
[37:57] spirit let your spirit be in me I want
[37:59] Christ in me I don't want Satan in me I
[38:01] don't want the demons in me I want
[38:03] Christ in me Hallelujah that's how I
[38:05] know I'm a Child of God when the spirit
[38:07] of Christ is working through
[38:11] me so he says examine look at your life
[38:13] what kind of fruits do you see you see
[38:15] all these fruits of the Holy Spirit love
[38:16] joy peace Temperance patience uh all
[38:19] these fruits or do you see the fruits of
[38:21] the works of the flesh
[38:23] Hallelujah this is how you do it 2
[38:26] Timothy 3:8 second Timothy
[38:29] 3:8 then we just got one more after that
[38:31] isn't that interesting these are all the
[38:32] times the Bible used the word
[38:34] reprobate now as Janice and jambers
[38:37] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[38:38] the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[38:41] concerning the faith now remember
[38:43] earlier it says they're lovers of their
[38:45] own selves more than lovers of God Jesus
[38:47] said if you love me you'll keep my
[38:49] commands so these are people that said
[38:52] they love God but they didn't obey the
[38:54] Bible they didn't obey the commands of
[38:56] God and they whed Janice and jambers
[38:59] whed Moses at least three times they
[39:01] could do three things Moses did but
[39:03] after that they could do no
[39:04] more so they W they with stod now church
[39:08] that's what we got to look at our lives
[39:09] look at the people withstanding you
[39:10] trying to get you away from the the the
[39:12] church or away from the gospel that's
[39:14] someone who's Anointed with the evil
[39:16] spirit and you've got to withstand them
[39:19] they're trying to withstand you but
[39:21] you've got to stand up against them with
[39:22] the sword of the spirit praise God
[39:26] hallelujah so these reprobates Janice
[39:28] and jambers see they reprobates that oh
[39:30] we can turn a stick into a snake ah but
[39:33] who snake won Hallelujah uh that one
[39:35] snake looked like it was outnumbered but
[39:37] God's never outnumbered God's always in
[39:39] the majority and death was swallowed up
[39:41] in life
[39:43] Hallelujah so they so that's someone
[39:46] who's got the evil spirit they're
[39:47] resisting your desire to serve the Lord
[39:50] they're resisting your attempts to
[39:52] please God
[39:53] hallelujah that's and someone who loves
[39:55] thems more than they love God that's a
[39:59] reprobate person lovers of Pleasures
[40:02] more than lovers of God hallelujah
[40:05] they'll watch a three and a half hour
[40:06] football game on Ohio State but they
[40:08] they won't even come to church and
[40:10] they'll get tired after you preach five
[40:11] minutes they get tired and want to leave
[40:12] and they want to criticize the preacher
[40:14] now nobody does that here
[40:16] right but that's just an example they
[40:19] love Pleasures more than they love
[40:23] God if if they text and say hey come
[40:25] over for the game oh right there but if
[40:27] you text and say let's have a Bible
[40:28] study no they love Pleasures more than
[40:31] they love God
[40:34] hallelujah very simple to see which side
[40:37] we're on thank God we can look thank God
[40:39] we can examine ourselves and see what
[40:40] fruits are growing out of our lives
[40:42] today
[40:43] Hallelujah ah last one Titus 1:16 is the
[40:46] last one
[40:58] Titus
[41:00] 1116 they profess that they know God but
[41:03] in their Works they deny him so see
[41:05] Church don't ever just listen to what
[41:07] people say with their mouth anybody can
[41:08] spew out things about God they honor me
[41:11] with their mouth but their heart is far
[41:13] from me look at the people's works what
[41:16] do they actually do with their lives
[41:18] what are they doing with the gifts God
[41:19] entrusted to
[41:21] them what did balum do with the gift
[41:23] that was entrust him he set aside his
[41:25] prophecy gift and he got out his false
[41:26] teaching gift and taught them oh it's
[41:28] okay to commit fornication it's okay to
[41:30] sleep with people before you're married
[41:31] and 24,000
[41:34] died he set aside his Prophet gift and
[41:37] got got out a false teaching
[41:41] gift he should have stayed with being a
[41:42] prophet he should have stopped going to
[41:44] those uh susers right those divers
[41:46] sometimes you go to divers sometimes you
[41:48] go to God just go to God church just go
[41:50] to God just stay with God
[41:54] hallelujah see so in their Works they're
[41:56] abom able like
[41:58] Abominations right like murder like
[42:01] crossdressing like blaspheming the name
[42:03] of God how all these Abominations
[42:06] beastiality all these Abominations child
[42:08] molestation all these
[42:10] Abominations but yet they say we we know
[42:12] God we love God the furthest thing from
[42:15] the truth your actions prove what you
[42:19] love they're being abominable and
[42:22] disobedient and unto every good work
[42:24] they're rejected
[42:27] when God wants to try to find someone
[42:28] some of these people to do a good work
[42:30] he can't find them because their works
[42:31] are already abominal they're rejected
[42:33] from doing any good works because
[42:35] they're
[42:36] abominable and so God has rejected their
[42:38] minds therefore God cannot use them to
[42:40] do any good
[42:42] thing how many believe that's the
[42:44] scripture praise God it's the word of
[42:47] God so now church you've read all the
[42:49] rep probate verses in the Bible you've
[42:51] read them right here you've heard them
[42:54] now let me read where brother M says
[42:55] there's only two there's only two kinds
[42:58] this is in the church age book chapter 3
[43:00] the Ephesian Church age he says let's go
[43:02] back to the beginning for the Book of
[43:03] Genesis in Garden of Eden there were two
[43:05] trees one was good one was evil one
[43:07] produced life the other produced death
[43:09] there were two children who originally
[43:10] offered sacrifice to God let me repeat
[43:12] that they both offered sacrifices to God
[43:16] the serpent seed act like they worship
[43:18] God but they do it in
[43:21] Disobedience the serpents need actually
[43:23] go to church they actually worship God
[43:26] but they deny deny the truth of God they
[43:28] deny the works of God
[43:31] hallelujah but yet they're
[43:34] worshippers that's why Paul said examine
[43:36] your life to make sure you're a real
[43:40] worshipper and then he quotes uh we're
[43:41] not going to read it but Genesis 4 3
[43:43] through five you know Cain brought forth
[43:45] the fruit Abel brought forth a out of
[43:47] his flock of course would have been a
[43:49] lamb and God respected the blood
[43:51] sacrifice and not the fruit sacrifice
[43:54] Hallelujah why because uh Abel had a
[43:56] revelation
[43:57] blood redeemed my mother and father
[44:00] blood allowed my mother and father to be
[44:02] forgiven and so blood's going to allow
[44:04] me to forgiven Hallelujah fruit can't
[44:08] bleed right there's there's no life
[44:10] there's no real death a real sacrifice
[44:12] in a fruit offering but there is a
[44:14] sacrifice an animal offering a life is
[44:17] taken because life is in the
[44:19] blood this week I your Friday I I taught
[44:22] Bible club to my little Elementary
[44:24] classes and I said did you know in the
[44:26] Old Testament they used to kill animals
[44:28] and the children's mouths literally went
[44:29] like
[44:31] this I'm like oh you guys never knew
[44:33] that oh I'm sorry did I I felt bad at
[44:36] first you know because they're all
[44:37] thinking about their pet their pet dog
[44:39] their pet cat their hamsters and all
[44:41] these things so I had to explain that's
[44:44] what God did and by the end they're like
[44:46] okay okay if God did it it must be okay
[44:49] I said but I know it's still sad but
[44:50] that was the point it's supposed to make
[44:52] you sad so you get sad about your sins
[44:54] praise God and you recognize something
[44:57] had to die in my place how unworthy how
[44:59] filthy I am but thank God an innocent
[45:02] substitute took my place thank God that
[45:04] I can live and greater than all that
[45:06] Jesus Christ the Lamb of God has taken
[45:08] away all the sins of the whole world
[45:14] Hallelujah he said but one was evil that
[45:16] was Cain he was the father of the wicked
[45:19] one the Bible says that Cain was of the
[45:21] wicked one so that means Adam wasn't his
[45:22] father because Adam was a Son of God but
[45:25] Abel was righteous before the Lord again
[45:27] there were two children from the Flesh
[45:29] of the same parents they were twins of
[45:31] Isaac and then there were twins of Isaac
[45:33] and Rebecca later Jacob and Esau one was
[45:35] elect and the other was
[45:38] reprobate so by the end of brother's
[45:40] Ministry now he he he gets these Bible
[45:42] terms the elect are the saved the uh
[45:45] reprobate are the lost and they take the
[45:48] mark of the beast because they blaspheme
[45:50] the Holy Ghost during their lifetime
[45:53] everybody see that all right
[45:58] okay
[45:59] now got about a half hour here by God's
[46:02] grace so now we try to bring this down
[46:04] by the grace of the
[46:05] Lord now go to 1 Timothy 1:13 oh yeah
[46:09] thank you K I'm sorry thank you
[46:16] L now Paul says so if you've ever uh and
[46:20] I'll just have have to share a little
[46:21] test story myself I told it here before
[46:25] but if you've ever blasphemed God or the
[46:30] holy ghost or
[46:31] anything you have to
[46:34] remember that God will still forgive
[46:37] you if you're a child of
[46:40] God God will still forgive you in other
[46:42] words uh everyone has fallen short of
[46:45] the glory of
[46:47] God
[46:49] everyone and I want you to know that
[46:51] because the B Paul says this Paul says
[46:54] he was a
[46:55] blasphemer and he says that I am a
[46:58] pattern to all
[47:00] believers his life of God saving him out
[47:03] of a blaspheming life the fact God could
[47:06] save a blasphemer and even a
[47:08] co-conspirator to murder the fact that
[47:10] God could save him was a pattern for all
[47:13] who should come after him
[47:15] hallelujah
[47:19] amen verse 12 1 Timothy 1:12 and I thank
[47:23] Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled
[47:25] me for he ha counted me Faith for
[47:27] putting me in the ministry now look God
[47:28] he says Jesus calls me faithful but
[47:30] before I was a blasphemer so in other
[47:33] words Paul said I reviled Jesus I was
[47:35] reproachful against Jesus I spoke I
[47:38] tried to get people to blashe his name
[47:40] that's what the Bible
[47:42] says look at
[47:46] this putting me into the
[47:49] ministry who was before a blasphemer and
[47:51] a persecutor and injures so not did he
[47:54] just he just didn't only blaspheme
[47:56] Church church but he actually persecuted
[47:59] Them See words is one thing but physical
[48:01] pain is
[48:03] another he was not just a he just didn't
[48:06] use words he actually used physical
[48:08] persecution took them to jail pulled
[48:11] them and chained them up took them to
[48:13] jail not just a blasphemer persecutor
[48:17] and
[48:19] injures right we see that there verse 13
[48:22] verse 14 and the grace of our Lord Jesus
[48:24] was what exceedingly abundant
[48:27] oh if Paul got exceeding abundant grace
[48:30] what about us when the capstone's coming
[48:32] back and it says Grace
[48:35] Grace against two portions of Grace
[48:37] Hallelujah double Grace exceeding Grace
[48:40] [Music]
[48:42] hallelujah
[48:44] hallelujah what about
[48:50] us it was ex exceeding abundant with
[48:54] faith and love which is in Christ Jesus
[48:56] Jesus this is a faithful saying and
[48:59] worthy of all acceptation that Christ
[49:01] Jesus came in the world to save Sinners
[49:03] of whom I am
[49:05] chief so Paul says I'm the worst of all
[49:10] Sinners why because he was a persecutor
[49:13] injures
[49:14] blasphemer he tormented the Church of
[49:17] God I he said I persecuted the Church of
[49:19] God I'm the chief of Sinners so Church
[49:22] you don't have to worry about being the
[49:23] chief of Sinners that's already taken
[49:26] now you might be pretty low but if God
[49:29] can save the chief God can save anybody
[49:31] else Hallelujah
[49:34] Glory you might have done some really
[49:36] low down dirty things awful things but
[49:40] you're not the chief and how many knows
[49:42] Paul said thus sayith the Lord here how
[49:43] many know this is the written bible this
[49:45] is thus sayith the Lord so if God can
[49:47] stoop down way down for Paul God can
[49:49] stoop down for you this morning
[49:52] Hallelujah like he stooped down for me
[49:54] hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God
[49:58] verse 16 how be it for this cause I
[50:00] obtain
[50:01] Mercy that in me first Christ Jesus
[50:04] might show forth all longsuffering for a
[50:06] pattern to them which should Hereafter
[50:08] believe onto him to everlasting life
[50:11] pause the pattern if I can save to the
[50:14] depths of the chiefest of Sinners I can
[50:16] save everybody who didn't sin as much as
[50:20] Paul which of you have ever taken a
[50:22] Christian and forced them to go to
[50:25] jail which one of you got friends at the
[50:27] jail and you and you know the jail guy
[50:29] or the the uh that's what brother Rod
[50:31] that was his job he used to work at the
[50:32] jail were any of you Rod's friends
[50:34] earlier in your sinful life and you try
[50:37] to take somebody to jail or how about
[50:39] hold the coats of people that would
[50:40] shoot Christians we'll just make it
[50:42] modern set of cast and Stones see none
[50:45] of us have ever stooped that low but we
[50:47] stooped low in other ways like for me my
[50:50] testimony was you know I was just a a
[50:51] sinful
[50:53] ignorant abominable teenager and my my
[50:56] brothers and I would sit there and make
[50:57] fun of the people speaking in tongues I
[50:59] sat right there in the back of the
[51:00] somebody's a God church and I'd make fun
[51:02] of it and I didn't know
[51:04] better you know they would always get
[51:05] emotional and and then we would laugh
[51:08] about it we'd Snicker about it think
[51:09] about that God could have struck us down
[51:11] but God looked past the outside God saw
[51:13] the predestinated seed on the inside
[51:15] even though he's mocking and making fun
[51:17] of it even though he's speaking against
[51:18] it and making fun of it there's still
[51:20] predestinated seed in there and one day
[51:22] when I show myself to him then he'll
[51:24] preach it Hallelujah
[51:27] Hallelujah and if God saved the lowest
[51:29] of the low if God saved the chief then
[51:32] God can save me
[51:36] Hallelujah now one time I don't know if
[51:38] if I don't know if you've heard this
[51:40] story but one of the Saints told me one
[51:42] time not here one of the Saints told me
[51:44] they were already saved the message and
[51:46] they said this line and and and
[51:48] understand this and after they said this
[51:50] they battled condemnation for
[51:54] years now they use the word they Ed the
[51:56] word stinking a lot this person would
[51:58] say that person needs to uh stink and
[52:01] get a job if they're lazy they need to
[52:02] stink and get a
[52:04] job or they need to uh stink and pay off
[52:07] their debts they need to uh stink and go
[52:10] on a diet or something like that they
[52:11] would use that right well this person a
[52:14] dear person uh heard about some sending
[52:17] the message and they said that person
[52:18] needs the stinking Holy Ghost now look
[52:23] stinking Holy Ghost and this person came
[52:25] to me in confidence and said brother
[52:27] Jess pray for me I prayed for them and I
[52:30] showed them this
[52:31] verse
[52:33] Hallelujah I showed them this
[52:36] verse where Paul says exceeding Grace
[52:40] came to me I blasphemed but I did it
[52:42] ignorantly so I told the person I said
[52:44] did you do it purposely or ignorantly
[52:46] there it is right
[52:48] there and the person said ignorantly
[52:50] well then of course you're
[52:53] forgiven you are
[52:55] forgiven because all of us the Bible
[52:57] said without the Holy Ghost your mouth
[52:59] is a open grave and all the stink of
[53:03] dead things all the stinky dead words
[53:04] and thoughts all the stinky things comes
[53:06] out that's why God had to put a coal in
[53:09] Isaiah's mouth Hallelujah and burn out
[53:11] that dep and put life in there and what
[53:13] is life except thus sayith the Lord
[53:16] hallelujah
[53:18] amen and when we do things ignorantly
[53:21] God says you're going to pay for it but
[53:23] I'm going to forgive you because I've
[53:25] already saved the chief of Sinners and
[53:28] if I can save the chief that's the
[53:29] pattern I can save to the utmost
[53:32] Hallelujah I can save you if I can save
[53:34] the lowest of the low I can save you who
[53:36] are low as well I specialize in that
[53:39] that's my job I'm the divine Savior I'm
[53:42] the Risen King Hallelujah I'm the
[53:43] Redeemer of souls
[53:50] Hallelujah so I'm not ashamed to say
[53:53] that because I know I have to take
[53:55] everything I do back to the Bible I did
[53:57] it in ignorance and now I pray to God
[53:59] Lord let me speak in
[54:01] tongues but I know that would just edify
[54:04] me right but I desire in other words I
[54:06] desire more of God in my life Lord I
[54:09] want to experience you in new ways I
[54:11] want more of your
[54:14] word and look at just as one example
[54:17] Romans 812 Romans 1 128 I constantly
[54:20] want more of God's knowledge in my mind
[54:23] I'm not trying to get away from the
[54:24] Bible I want more of the Bible's
[54:27] knowledge what about Moses who literally
[54:29] killed a man what about David who
[54:32] despised the command of God had your Rah
[54:34] killed and slept with his
[54:36] wife and after he was already
[54:40] saved see Church there's got to be Grace
[54:43] there's got to be Mercy amen there's got
[54:45] to be saving to the uttermost Hallelujah
[54:49] there's got to be what's called getting
[54:50] back to your first love
[54:54] Hallelujah there's got to be God created
[54:56] me a clean heart and restored the joy of
[54:59] my salvation Hallelujah help me to never
[55:02] do that
[55:06] again and and look I I just appreciated
[55:08] that person was able to confess
[55:11] it brother random said uh he remember he
[55:13] got mad with God and said God you owe me
[55:15] an
[55:18] understanding and church remember
[55:20] brother Ram let his mother-in-law when
[55:21] he first started he let his
[55:22] mother-in-law Hope's mom Mr brumbach he
[55:24] let her call the Pentecostals TR
[55:26] trash and he just walked away okay I
[55:28] won't go preach them he let trash the
[55:32] the people of God were trash and then
[55:34] the 1937 flood came took his wife and
[55:37] his daughter he said that was one of my
[55:40] biggest mistakes in my life he let the
[55:42] people of God be called trash and didn't
[55:44] stand up for them are we going to make
[55:47] mistakes yes is there Grace is there
[55:49] hope for future yes I just showed it to
[55:52] you last Sunday did God give him a new
[55:53] commission yes God wasn't done with him
[55:56] God didn't forget about him God didn't
[55:57] say you reprobate God said you'll pay
[55:59] for it you'll learn your lesson because
[56:01] that's how you learn obedience through
[56:02] the things you suffer but I'm going to
[56:03] give you a new commission
[56:06] Hallelujah I'm GNA give you a new job
[56:08] Hallelujah I'm G to give you a new uh
[56:10] plan I'm not done with you I've got good
[56:13] I've got I've got good thoughts toward
[56:15] you I've got a plan for you I've got
[56:18] good things for you hope in a future
[56:21] Hallelujah the righteous man falls seven
[56:23] times but the Lord raises him up amen
[56:32] so see we see the pattern the lowest
[56:34] wretch of a sinner
[56:37] blasphemer which is unforgivable it was
[56:39] already after the Holy Ghost had fallen
[56:41] he was still doing that after the Holy
[56:42] Ghost because Steph had the Holy
[56:43] Ghost he let he let a holy ghost F man
[56:46] be murdered and say he was following a
[56:48] beel all these things and yet God could
[56:50] forgive him and make him a
[56:54] spokesperson other why to show show his
[56:56] exceeding Mercy in Paul's
[57:01] life Hallelujah now what's interesting I
[57:04] want to say about Paul I don't know if
[57:05] he was just in justification as a Jew or
[57:09] not I don't know because he obeyed the
[57:12] law of Moses right he was a Pharisee of
[57:14] Pharisees he was zealous for the law he
[57:16] was keeping much of the law so I don't
[57:18] know if he was saved or lost at that
[57:21] point I don't
[57:23] know but either way God can
[57:26] uh God can get a hold of someone even if
[57:29] they blashe ignorantly right God can get
[57:31] a hold of somebody help them to repent
[57:33] and get them on the right path by the
[57:35] grace of God
[57:39] hallelujah now what's we also have to
[57:41] balance out is that Judas es scariot was
[57:44] saved his name was in heaven Jesus said
[57:46] so his name was in heaven but then he
[57:49] blasphemed and he left the Lord Jesus
[57:51] right at the end Satan filled his heart
[57:54] so after that he left he must have said
[57:56] something Blasphemous to the Pharisees
[57:59] and Sadducees when he sold him out sorry
[58:00] the Sanhedrin Council when he sold him
[58:02] out and then he got he felt sorry he
[58:04] threw the money back in went out and
[58:06] hung
[58:07] himself so he must have blasphemed
[58:09] something at that
[58:11] point now but remember Church Judas
[58:13] didn't have the baptism of the Holy
[58:14] Ghost it wasn't
[58:17] available so see we know someone before
[58:19] they're born again under the first two
[58:21] stages justification sanctification they
[58:23] can fall away and blaspheme but someone
[58:25] that's seal into the kingdom of God uh
[58:27] the Bible said they're sealed until the
[58:29] day of their Redemption
[58:32] Hallelujah so see it's it's quite a deep
[58:34] thought right someone can blashe before
[58:37] they're saved God can forgive them
[58:40] someone can be saved but forfeit it by
[58:43] blaspheming and be
[58:45] lost because they haven't reached the
[58:47] promised land yet amen the Holy Ghost is
[58:49] the promised land the spiritual Promised
[58:52] Land the New
[58:53] Testament so it's quite a thought we got
[58:56] to really get that's why the B that's
[58:57] why Paul said examine yourselves now
[58:59] look church I can't examine you you
[59:01] can't examine me you got to examine
[59:03] yourself you've got to see am I seeking
[59:06] after God am I following after God am I
[59:08] following in the word of God do I love
[59:09] Jesus Christ do I love God's people
[59:12] hallelujah hallelujah only you can
[59:15] examine
[59:16] yourself I can't do it for you you've
[59:18] got to do
[59:23] it Hallelujah
[59:26] now remember the Bible said 1 John 5:16
[59:28] in case you want to read that or put
[59:30] that up there hun 1 John 5:16 Paul John
[59:33] said there are people you don't pray for
[59:34] when they've crossed the line and they
[59:37] blasing but many times we don't know who
[59:38] they are many times we don't but we know
[59:41] most people will be like this but see
[59:44] then but then we don't know who's going
[59:45] to be saved and who's not so we keep
[59:46] praying for the Lost we keep praying for
[59:48] Sinners so the the idea is keep praying
[59:51] keep praying until God puts on your
[59:53] heart don't pray for that person then
[59:54] you ought to be really sorrowful for
[59:55] that person person to know that they'll
[59:57] have an eternity where they'll
[59:59] eventually be annihilated and never
[1:00:01] exist
[1:00:02] anymore if a man see his brother sin a
[1:00:05] sin which is not unto death he shall ask
[1:00:06] and he shall give him life for them that
[1:00:08] sin not unto death there is a sin unto
[1:00:10] death I do not say that he shall pray
[1:00:12] for it so there's certain sins you know
[1:00:14] people do sometimes they may you know
[1:00:17] you may know it I don't know many times
[1:00:19] I don't though we don't know when people
[1:00:20] have gone over into that but once they
[1:00:22] go over into that then we don't pray for
[1:00:24] them anymore that's what God told
[1:00:25] Jeremiah just read through that God told
[1:00:27] Jeremiah Don't Pray for Jerusalem
[1:00:29] anymore I've sent them prophet he said
[1:00:31] Rising early and coming out I've sent
[1:00:33] Prophet after Prophet they've turned
[1:00:35] down the words of the Lord he said don't
[1:00:37] pray for them anymore butam said I don't
[1:00:39] even pray for the United States
[1:00:41] anymore now God led him not to but look
[1:00:43] we prayed for it and God's given us
[1:00:45] Grace
[1:00:49] Hallelujah so God told him certain
[1:00:51] things and see God God knew time was
[1:00:53] going to go on God knew we'd be here
[1:00:54] hallelujah in other words brother R had
[1:00:56] certain people to pray for the
[1:00:59] sick that God said pray for my sick
[1:01:01] children that was the Angel's commission
[1:01:03] pray for my sick children hallelujah oh
[1:01:08] my Hallelujah now let me read you a few
[1:01:10] things brother Ram
[1:01:13] said here's ways to
[1:01:16] know here's ways to know uh that someone
[1:01:19] has cross the line between mercy and
[1:01:21] judgment this is 1958 Jehovah Gyra you
[1:01:26] say brother brandom I've been so sinful
[1:01:27] I believe I've crossed the separating
[1:01:29] line no you haven't or you wouldn't be
[1:01:31] here
[1:01:34] tonight brother man makes it plain if
[1:01:36] you'd cross the line you wouldn't even
[1:01:38] be here somebody ought to shout amen out
[1:01:41] there I was hoping somebody would sayen
[1:01:43] the fact you're here proves you haven't
[1:01:45] crossed the line God's still dealing
[1:01:46] with you he wants to strengthen you he
[1:01:48] wants to fill you with his Spirit praise
[1:01:51] God look just think of Judas he he
[1:01:53] wasn't there anymore at Pentecost he
[1:01:54] wasn't even there
[1:01:56] because he already crossed the line if
[1:01:58] you crossed the line you wouldn't be
[1:01:59] here thank God you're here hallelujah
[1:02:01] thank God you can hear the preaching
[1:02:02] thank God you care and you hunger and
[1:02:04] thirst for the Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] Hallelujah if you crossed the line you
[1:02:10] wouldn't even be
[1:02:15] here say how can he brother man how can
[1:02:17] he make atonement for me I broke my
[1:02:19] marriage vows I've done this that the
[1:02:21] other you've done everything there is in
[1:02:23] the Bible that you ought not to do
[1:02:26] besides blasing the Holy Ghost God has a
[1:02:29] sacrifice provided for you he's Jehovah
[1:02:31] Gyra he'll alter all your
[1:02:35] circumstances oh Hallelujah the fact I'm
[1:02:38] here shows God loves me God's still
[1:02:40] dealing with me praise God I'm on God's
[1:02:42] side
[1:02:43] Hallelujah I'm not reprobate God's
[1:02:46] dealing with me God's going to use me
[1:02:48] I'm a vessel of God I'm a Child of God
[1:02:51] hallelujah glory amen hallelujah
[1:02:56] that's why John said they went out from
[1:02:57] us because they were not of
[1:03:00] us that's one good proof you are
[1:03:02] rejected is you don't come back to the
[1:03:04] house of God
[1:03:05] anymore
[1:03:11] Hallelujah 1960 two years later it is I
[1:03:14] Be not Afraid Tulsa
[1:03:18] Oklahoma brother M said maybe you think
[1:03:21] you've crossed the separating
[1:03:23] line that you can't be saved
[1:03:27] I don't know what your mind battles
[1:03:29] are I mean every now and then I'll
[1:03:31] battle this but not not much anymore
[1:03:33] because I've served the Lord so
[1:03:37] long he says maybe you think you cross a
[1:03:40] separating line that you can't be saved
[1:03:42] brother Bram said that's
[1:03:45] wrong if the devil told you you can't be
[1:03:47] saved just say devil that's
[1:03:51] wrong brother Ram said as long as you
[1:03:54] got enough God about you to come here to
[1:03:57] this church tonight then there's hopes
[1:03:59] for you to be saved as long as the
[1:04:02] spirit of God still dealing with you
[1:04:04] Hallelujah Satan wouldn't bring you here
[1:04:07] if you didn't care anymore you reprobate
[1:04:09] you wouldn't even be here but you have
[1:04:11] enough Holy Ghost to bring you to God's
[1:04:13] house amen so the Holy Ghost can heal
[1:04:16] you strengthen you deliver you Empower
[1:04:19] you Hallelujah make you more like Christ
[1:04:23] Hallelujah give you real Christian
[1:04:25] character
[1:04:28] Hallelujah brother R said twice you
[1:04:30] wouldn't even come to church you
[1:04:31] wouldn't even be here if youd cross the
[1:04:33] separating line remember Judas never
[1:04:36] came back after he left never came back
[1:04:39] just the fact sometimes you can crawl
[1:04:41] get in your car and force yourself to go
[1:04:43] to church just the fact you can press
[1:04:44] through all think about the layers of
[1:04:45] devils you know you might be bad on your
[1:04:47] mind but you press your way through your
[1:04:50] house then you press through your car
[1:04:51] you drive all these miles and you
[1:04:53] finally get through the door just the
[1:04:54] fact you got in the church proves God's
[1:04:57] spirit was with you
[1:04:59] Hallelujah God strengthened you to get
[1:05:01] here
[1:05:02] hallelujah devil won't help you get
[1:05:05] here God's spirit brings you to the
[1:05:07] house of
[1:05:09] God that's why he said gather more as
[1:05:12] you see that day approaching
[1:05:15] Hallelujah that's right Church
[1:05:17] Hallelujah glory to
[1:05:19] God but some of us just need a return of
[1:05:22] Joy you've lost your joy you've lost the
[1:05:26] joy of your
[1:05:28] salvation you haven't lost your
[1:05:30] salvation you just lost the joy of it
[1:05:33] how did David lose it he committed
[1:05:35] adultery and church you might not have
[1:05:36] committed it adultery physically but you
[1:05:38] might have committed it
[1:05:41] spiritually right love something in the
[1:05:43] world you love something in the world so
[1:05:45] much that you've uh cheated on
[1:05:47] Jesus you've given more love to
[1:05:50] Something in the world more than you
[1:05:51] give to Jesus Christ and so you come to
[1:05:54] church there's no joy at your home
[1:05:55] there's no
[1:05:56] joy that's your fault you let that uh
[1:06:01] you let that devil in and spoiled your
[1:06:03] house but the best part is you can let
[1:06:05] Jesus back in too amen hallelujah praise
[1:06:09] God you just got to open the door and
[1:06:11] confess your sin say Lord there's a
[1:06:12] devil in here I let him in here forgive
[1:06:14] me come back in Set Me Free I rebuke
[1:06:16] Satan and see Satan has to flee
[1:06:20] Hallelujah that's right I'm going to do
[1:06:23] a couple more things before I close here

[1:10:57] I've been I I was alive when brother
[1:10:58] Brandon was born and you've only been
[1:11:00] preaching for 20 years how could you how
[1:11:03] could you be right about uh Daniel 70
[1:11:05] weeks he was he was claiming because of
[1:11:08] my experience I know way more than
[1:11:10] you and then he says well you're a Cain
[1:11:13] then because you don't believe this I
[1:11:15] said well line up your math and his math
[1:11:16] was way off his dates don't even line up
[1:11:19] it doesn't even make any sense but he's
[1:11:21] trying to call upon his his experience
[1:11:23] your experience don't make you a closer
[1:11:25] to to God unless you draw closer to God
[1:11:27] in your experience
[1:11:31] Hallelujah number of years don't always
[1:11:33] mean you're more wise or more
[1:11:35] knowledgeable it's what you put in those
[1:11:41] years he says then another thing you
[1:11:45] must he said you you must have thought
[1:11:47] something of the Lord and and love him
[1:11:49] because you wouldn't have tried to
[1:11:50] correct me because you love him you
[1:11:51] don't want his work going on wrong you
[1:11:54] must love me so brother Ram saw when
[1:11:56] people C to try to criticize him it was
[1:11:58] a sign of love that's what we got to
[1:12:00] receive it as a sign of love that's why
[1:12:03] I wrote the guy and said may God soften
[1:12:05] your cold hard-hearted heart because all
[1:12:07] we do is disagree on three and a half
[1:12:08] years I agree on the water baptism the
[1:12:10] Holy Ghost God sent a prophet marriage
[1:12:12] and divorce we agree on everything else
[1:12:14] we just disagree on three and a half
[1:12:19] years now look at this now brother s now
[1:12:21] the next thing I'm going to do I forgive
[1:12:24] you for calling me
[1:12:27] Church do we have the power to do that
[1:12:29] John
[1:12:30] 2023a do we have the power if someone
[1:12:34] has blasphemed
[1:12:36] us do we have the power to forgive them
[1:12:39] and will Jesus honor it the answer is
[1:12:42] yes hallu the answer is yes Hallelujah
[1:12:46] whoever sins ye remit they are remitted
[1:12:49] unto them and whosoever sins ye retain
[1:12:52] they are retain brother R had a choice
[1:12:54] he could have kept the sins on him or he
[1:12:55] could have remitted them he chose to
[1:12:57] forgive may God help us to choose to
[1:13:00] forgive others
[1:13:03] Hallelujah he could have wrote back you
[1:13:05] blasphemed the Holy Ghost but see
[1:13:07] brother had enough understanding you're
[1:13:08] just a Lutheran you've only got to the
[1:13:10] first step there's three steps in Grace
[1:13:13] you're just on step
[1:13:15] one you're still in first grade
[1:13:18] yes but there's second grade there's a
[1:13:20] third grade there's more grade there's
[1:13:22] levels to go in god so brother looked on
[1:13:24] him compassion you must love me this
[1:13:26] could help me uh but uh let me help you
[1:13:30] out first of all I forgive your
[1:13:36] blasphemy what a what an act of God's
[1:13:41] love because he says because remember
[1:13:44] Jesus said that was doing the very same
[1:13:46] thing blaspheming the Holy
[1:13:49] Ghost now I said to straighten you up
[1:13:51] brother I'd like to ask you something
[1:13:53] I'm surprised a Lutheran would base his
[1:13:55] theology upon some sort of evidence why
[1:13:58] I said even in the Baptist Church
[1:13:59] remember he was a Baptist Brother start
[1:14:01] even as a Baptist in the first year of
[1:14:04] of church we learned to base everything
[1:14:07] upon the Bible all our theology must
[1:14:09] come off the Bible and you're trying to
[1:14:11] base your theology on an experience with
[1:14:13] a bunch of witch
[1:14:15] doctors but to settle it to settle this
[1:14:18] and straighten you out Jesus said Satan
[1:14:20] cannot cast out
[1:14:22] Satan Hallelujah he says that settles it
[1:14:26] he says Satan can't heal he said that's
[1:14:30] all
[1:14:33] Hallelujah he said he wrote me back a
[1:14:35] letter and said Mr brandom I'm coming
[1:14:36] back for the Christian businessman's
[1:14:38] International Convention to speak could
[1:14:39] I have a few words with you and he said
[1:14:42] all right he said after the dinner I
[1:14:45] said I want to ask you a question Mr
[1:14:46] brand he wasn't calling him brother he's
[1:14:47] call him
[1:14:48] Mister because you're a
[1:14:51] sser I said yes sir oh here it comes now
[1:14:54] from a Lutheran de he says in my oh I'm
[1:14:56] going to rake by the coals now he said
[1:14:58] I've been down to the Pentecostals I see
[1:15:00] them kick the furniture around and
[1:15:02] everything like that but I want to ask
[1:15:04] you is anything to it now think about
[1:15:06] that I've been in a couple Services I
[1:15:08] think I I'll use this year I've seen a
[1:15:10] couple Services where I've seen people
[1:15:11] SE in the spirit they pushed and I hope
[1:15:13] I don't bother you but they pushed on
[1:15:15] the Pew they were so in tuned to the
[1:15:17] Holy Spirit they pushed on the Pew and
[1:15:18] the Pew was knocked out that was my
[1:15:21] sister and she got a real visitation
[1:15:23] from the Lord that night I mean
[1:15:25] Furniture moved people screaming dancing
[1:15:28] crying at the altar snotting all over
[1:15:30] the
[1:15:31] altar people so under the move of the
[1:15:33] spirit of God I just got a message from
[1:15:35] one of Malachi's friends from the youth
[1:15:36] banquet he said let me tell you about
[1:15:38] the greatest experience I ever had it
[1:15:39] was in 2019 we at a youth meeting and
[1:15:41] all the youth people are running all
[1:15:43] over the the church and people are
[1:15:45] getting healed and saved and demons are
[1:15:46] getting cast
[1:15:47] out he said but the next night they
[1:15:49] tried to reproduce that and it grieved
[1:15:51] the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit
[1:15:53] didn't want running that night
[1:15:56] see we got to be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:15:58] every service has its own unique purpose
[1:16:01] for it Hallelujah and see the young
[1:16:04] people just thought well if I ran last
[1:16:06] night then I got to run every night
[1:16:07] that's not a mature
[1:16:09] Christian a mature Christian says I got
[1:16:11] to do what God wants me to do we got to
[1:16:13] follow what's God's mind for this
[1:16:15] service Hallelujah and the way you'll
[1:16:17] know is the hearts that are being
[1:16:19] discerned whoever God's speaking to and
[1:16:22] Discerning the thoughts and Tents of
[1:16:23] their heart that's their Direction the
[1:16:25] Holy Spirit wants to go Hallelujah but
[1:16:28] they got to make it
[1:16:29] known they got to act on the word either
[1:16:32] got to come to the altar or praise God
[1:16:34] or get ask for baptism or something like
[1:16:36] that or ask for the Holy Ghost they got
[1:16:38] to make it known they got to act upon
[1:16:40] the word
[1:16:44] hallelujah that Luther de said I've seen
[1:16:46] Pentecostals kick furniture around is
[1:16:49] there anything to that so he looked and
[1:16:51] said what what came out of that and
[1:16:54] brother said yes sir oh there is
[1:16:57] something to kick in chairs around but
[1:16:59] man said yes
[1:17:02] sir so somebody could get so filled with
[1:17:04] God they could kick around a chair this
[1:17:06] table could be knocked over on accident
[1:17:09] remember we were dancing at or it was
[1:17:11] the night before that meeting in
[1:17:12] Napoleon we had that great outpouring of
[1:17:13] the Holy Ghost remember uh I don't know

[1:17:36] leaned into me but I let go sooner than
[1:17:39] I thought and he and he lost his balance
[1:17:41] and he fell
[1:17:43] over and we're all running around and I
[1:17:45] saw some critics there I saw some
[1:17:46] critics there in the point
[1:17:48] going you know because he fell over
[1:17:50] right in front of the church and in my
[1:17:51] mind I had a mind battle did I just
[1:17:52] grieve the Holy Ghost
[1:17:55] so I I tried to pick him up I couldn't
[1:17:56] pick him up I said Simon come help me
[1:17:58] Simon I got him back up we worship now
[1:17:59] we all know what happened the next night

[1:21:19] greatest meetings so when all those
[1:21:21] young people were dancing all over the
[1:21:22] place that was the bones coming together
[1:21:24] now God wants to give you the spirit
[1:21:27] though hallelujah oh you thought the
[1:21:30] bones coming together was no no there's
[1:21:31] more to that there's more than ring and
[1:21:34] jumping around and shouting and making
[1:21:36] noise and moving around Furniture
[1:21:38] there's more to it than that there's
[1:21:40] Jesus Christ Living in the individual
[1:21:42] establishing the character of Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ Hallelujah that's what it is
[1:21:48] amen but God's got to bring those things
[1:21:50] together and give you experiences and
[1:21:52] then he pours his life in and then you
[1:21:53] live like a soldier then after that cuz
[1:21:56] that's what it was a valley of dry bones
[1:21:59] but it became an army Hallelujah
[1:22:01] am oh my thank you
[1:22:07] Lord but the RAM said I think those Dry
[1:22:10] Bones were coming together brother
[1:22:13] hegry he said but we're hungry and
[1:22:15] thirsting for god brother said that's
[1:22:17] fine he said we want you to tell us how
[1:22:19] to get the Holy Ghost I he said did you
[1:22:21] ever read Acts 19
[1:22:24] yes he said a mighty good Baptist up
[1:22:27] there good pastor good preacher his name
[1:22:29] was ayos a converted lawyer he proved
[1:22:32] Jesus was Christ by the Bible he said
[1:22:34] they had a lot of shouting a lot of
[1:22:35] jumping but they didn't have the Holy
[1:22:37] Ghost and the Lutheran said but the
[1:22:40] Bible said Abraham believed God and was
[1:22:43] imputed him to righteousness what more
[1:22:44] can a man do but believe brother Abraham
[1:22:47] said that's all a man can do but you
[1:22:50] must believe and accept Christ as your
[1:22:51] savior but remember God gave Abraham a
[1:22:55] seal of circumcision to confirm his
[1:22:58] faith and brother Bram said Ephesians
[1:23:00] 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:23:03] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[1:23:05] Redemption God must confirm your faith
[1:23:08] if he hasn't given you the Holy Ghost
[1:23:10] he's never recognized your
[1:23:13] faith so see you start off by by by
[1:23:16] becoming a Believer you start having
[1:23:18] noise and you start praising God but you
[1:23:20] got to keep going on let God add to your
[1:23:23] stature let God add all those anointings
[1:23:25] and then God will fill you with the Holy
[1:23:30] Ghost so he said okay brother Ram we
[1:23:32] want the Holy Ghost I thought you're a
[1:23:33] Lutheran college and you want the Holy
[1:23:36] Ghost I said what's the Lutheran people

[1:23:48] when they say I don't care what my
[1:23:49] family says I don't care what anybody
[1:23:51] says I want the Holy Ghost

[1:28:34] the Holy Ghost and God has done with
[1:28:37] me so what I told him is you haven't if
[1:28:39] you if you even have a desire to wonder
[1:28:41] did I blaspheme that means God's still
[1:28:43] dealing with you that's the Holy Ghost
[1:28:46] it's the Holy Ghost helping you examine
[1:28:47] your yourself to make sure you're in the
