let's say I take our Bibles tonight by the grace of Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 5 like to continue this revelation series by the grace of God tonight there's all kinds of different ways I wanted to go there's all kinds of things I want to study and preach I want to get back to that Ephesians series and I want to continue on the wisdoms series I'm still reading on all those and then I want to do a little series on numbers because I've been studying numbers in the Bible and I've been emailing with sister Wendy a little bit about that and just you know different numbers you see in the Bible like 5 and different ones you know they all have meaning so anyways but I just felt led this I was praying this morning and so forth and I just kind of felt led to come to this Revelation chapter 5 I'd like to preach all the way through the book of Revelation if God would help me so we'll see what the Lord has for us here tonight amen Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 I'm just going to read verse 1 because I don't know if we'll make a bass verse 1 because what I've done is I've listened to brother Branham preached Revelation chapter 5 there's two parts on it they're both in June of nineteen and a sixty-one and so I'm just going slowly through there and then just pulling out and listen to what he says the the things he emphasizes and I'm just going to preach those by the grace of the Lord and I'm gonna inject some other things to that brother Ram has said of course throughout the entire message but that's where I'm starting I'm starting with revelation 5 from 1961 as my my outline that's my inspiration and then as inspiration comes then I just add to it from other places in the message revelation 5 verse 1 if you're there say Amen let's read it together just one verse let's read on three one two three and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals let's have a word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just making on unto God as we pray Heavenly Father we bowed our heads Lord god we've humbled ourselves we've sang your songs we love you for all of your goodness will love you forever all of our soul belongs to you and all of our songs will give to Jesus Christ amen father dis ministered to us and our Lord we've sung your worship songs we've given you glory our hearts are are clear our hearts are happy Lord or rejoicing and what you've done and now father we ask that the Holy Spirit would break his word to us O God discern our hearts O God give us wisdom understanding Lord give us strength give us the understanding of the authority we have as believers Oh God we're grateful for your mercy and love and we'll give you all the glory in Jesus Christ name and the church said Amen god bless you be in see the praise god I'll try to set a timer here for an hour I forgotten like the last two services I'm try not to forget tonight by God's grace okay so I have a slow okay got it alright thank you sir wonderful wonderful we like to at chapter 5 oh wait I got one more thing can you just bear with me I want to follow up with what brother Simon mentioned on ok yeah so on Sunday brother Simon preached a wonderful message in the morning I can't remember the title of it now but it was about things that are to be or things that are to come and he showed the video of the ecumenical move from about four years ago you remember that ratio if you remember and remember that okay why I saw one that was two years later they the Pope put out so I want to show that one tonight I'm Alec I hope to volumes up it's not gonna be your fault it's gonna be my fault if there's anything wrong so this is a video right off of YouTube everybody can watch it watch this video and see how it's a one-world religion that the Pope is pushing it's it's plain to see when everybody see I don't know if you have seen it I saw I shared with brother Simon I don't know if he didn't actually text me back to let me know if he watched it but if you haven't seen this you're gonna be shocked you're gonna see the Pope kiss another religions holy book I forget I don't know which religion it was but he bends down and kisses their holy book and does all you know all kinds of things who he shouldn't do that's because he's not God's messenger but you know we don't say that arrogantly we just say if actually okay so hopefully this is loud enough here so most of the planet's inhabitants declare themselves believers this should lead to dialog among religions we should not stop praying for it and collaborating with those who think differently I have confidence in Buddha I believe in God I believe in Jesus Christ I believe in God Allah many thing differently feel differently seeking God or meeting God in different ways in this crowd in this range of religion there is kissing whatever that is in this crowd in this range of religions there's only one certainly that we have for all we're all children of God I believe in love I believe in love I believe in love go feeling both I hope you will spread my prayer requests this month this was from January 2016 sincere dialogue among men and women of different faiths they produce the fruits of peace and justice I've confidence in your prayers alright we're not gonna clap after that one so don't clap that's right from the tri from the Pope's worldwide the Pope video org you can go check it out if you want okay so I don't want to see that all right it just they automatically play stuff and I thought I shut that off but okay I just want to follow up was that does that help by God's grace it's so obvious to the believer in church it ought to give us confidence that we will not be left behind in the tribulation amen glory we are walking in the light we are not walking in darkness that doesn't appeal to me at all because I know behind all those I love yous I love yous I know they don't love this word and don't get me wrong I love them with a cry see love where you love your enemies we do love them but we do not love their lies the Muslims reject the blood of Jesus Christ that means they've rejected the atonement so our Jews they'd rejected the atonement right now of course we know they can be saved because they've been blinded but the Muslims have not been blinded they're purposely blinded by the god of this evil age amen so what we need to do is we just clean closer to the Word of God stay more true to God and understand that true oneness is obedience to God's Word this word the one word the one faith amen so hope that's a help by God's grace and you can share that with your friends I've shared it with numerous people and I hope it was a blessing by God's grace Oh revelation 5 part 1 this is part 79 of the series so we're thankful for the progress that God has given us amen I'm just gonna you know as I started setting this I'm like well I'm just gonna go one verse that I don't think we're gonna finish verse one tonight because brother Adam said so much if you if you listen to the message he says so much about the book of redemption and the book and the seals and everything like that so I'll probably just have time to you know just start this here tonight and keep it going so let me just pull up the scripture here verse one revelation five verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so just look at this scripture tonight and try to show you what the prophet of God said about it by God's grace I plan to preach on the Seventh Seal tonight and the seven thunders I hope you brought your spiritual caps both RAM said your spiritual understanding caps it's so simple Church and I had I've had people all over this nation this week contact me and say thank you for the clearness and the simpleness of your teachings I just had somebody call me today and say thank you that your videos teach the the gospel in such clarity they said it's so simple and that I'm not saying that to brag I'm saying that because brother Branham said God is revealed in simplicity it's not to be so deep and mysterious what needs to be done is we need to say God clear out my thoughts of all my previous thinking and help me just to believe what the Word of God says amen and then help me to understand brother Graham's quotes cuz he was a man you know he has his thoughts changed on different things like the white horse riders a very easy example to see we got to say Lord help me just to see the simplicity behind it all and so I hope you'll see the simplicity behind it tonight by the grace of God how many want simplicity in their lives I think if church I think if you honestly look at the quotes you're gonna see how simple it is by the grace of God now remember brother Branham said that the right hand of God in heaven is not a literal right hand it's a place of authority can everybody say Amen in other words we don't have God the Father standing there and he's got his hands on a throne and he's sitting open like this and then Jesus is you know sitting Jesus sitting on Daddy's right hand that's that's not what it is and there's not even two Thrones because the Bible said there's only one throat amen there's 24 Thrones for the 24 elders but then Bible said there's one thrown by the grace of God we've preached on that as we've led up to this point there's only one throne and so this is symbolic here I saw on the right hand of him who sat upon a throne a book so there must have been a book somehow floating or somehow on the throne there must have been at some how because it wasn't a literal right hand and at this point John has not even seen the lamb yet I mean know what I'm talking about because the lamb comes out later brother Graham stood where was the lamb he said the lamb was back in the intercession booth interceding for the sins of you and I men hallelujah so John doesn't even see the lamb so he sees a throne it must be empty or maybe there's there's light and rainbows and lightnings and thunderings and all these things there but there's a book there there's a book at the right hand or you say at the place of authority of God and we don't see the Lamb yet because they're all crying in a few moments then a few scriptures down they're all crying saying who's worthy who's worthy and no one sees the lamb so that's the picture that we see at the beginning of this verse now let's look at a book rogram says a book the book was sealed by these seven seals the whole mystery of the book is sealed up in these seven seals this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of Revelation oh yes I look forward to preaching the one of the greatest books in the book of Revelation tonight amen it's a privilege to do so Church and I want you to remember we've had a few guest ministers coming here lately and they've talked about how we need to speak more of the word and we've heard so much on the seven seals and and let me say and I've said this before we've got to balance that statement if we are coming to church and we're almost dozing off and and we're just hearing teaching and we're not pulling on the word it doesn't matter what anybody we're not gonna be on fire for God it doesn't really matter it's up to you and I Jesus isn't gonna say well you know he's not gonna say well it was my fault I wasn't sending the Word of God you know you lost your first love because I wasn't sending the Holy Spirit Jesus not going to say that Jesus has sent the Holy Spirit and it's our responsibility to come and dine with the master because he's inviting us tonight come and dine amen and we've got to come and sit at the table we've got the feast on the word we got the pull on the word we've got the love the word amen but the point I want to make is that and I said it before the Holy Spirit gave brother bran the seven seals and he caught in his greatest meetings and it had some of the greatest healings because leukemia was healed that week in March of 1963 where he was teaching and revealing the mysteries of God so when I'm when I know our brothers meaning I did talk to brother Joe he said they would I and what we were talking about what happens is that people let the word of God become intellectual instead of receiving the reality of it in other words they memorize the seven seals they were memorized what this symbol means that symbol it means but they do not receive the anointing of the flying eagle and the church said because they continue to wallow around and worldliness and so no matter who preaches it even if brother Branham see people they criticize preachers today but why don't they go listen to brother Brenneman and if they did they could listen the seventh seal why doesn't their faith rock because they're not receiving the word the spirit behind the word amen it's just becoming election ilysm so Church you and I it's your responsibility it's my responsibility to stay on fire with God we can't blame anybody else we will all stand individually before the throne of God amen this is an individual affair we'll stand there in or what your grandparents or your grandma you will stand there individually and your answer for their deeds done in the body amen hallelujah now there may be a time where you stand there with your husband or wife member brother Brahim had that dream where he and his wife were caught up to the throne you may stand there but you will not be judged as far as well because of your prayers of your wife your husband is saved No you've got to make that decision yourself everybody's got to die out to themselves everybody's got to go to Calvary amen mercy there is great and grace is free amen and there the burden was God's grace was multiplied to me amen there my burdened soul found Liberty at Calvary praise God that's what I'm saying is that you and I are responsible for our own walk and understanding and brother Joe agreed and when I was saying what we were saying is that people just teach they just teach the symbols they teach what they mean but they don't encourage the people to reach out and walk in the spirit praise God and to accept the anointing that God is dishing out even tonight amen how many want more the anointing of God well then you've got to accept it amen and you've got to receive it tonight you've got to enjoy the word you've got to say Amen brother Brahim said that when you say Amen it's like saying SiC them to the devil in other words devil get out of here when you say amen amen it said sick of me and then God will drive away that skunk of a devil are you with me Church but you've got to believe the Lord you've got to Amen the word if you're sit here and act like nothing's going on then the Holy Spirit can't minister to you but you've got to get in the spirit and worship God amen or I've seen it a hundred times if I haven't seen it a thousand times of all the times I preach anyone that's hungry for God's Word can receive whatever they have need of if we just believe and in get in the spirit and enjoy what God is speaking to us amen I've seen it a hundred times if not more alright we just got to get in the spirit of it now Berta may have said a seal represents a finished product now this ought to encourage you hopefully I'll hear a few amens here because if you Amen this then you were - Amen brother branham had you been living in 1961 something that has already been tested proven and then sealed we have the earnest of our salvation now by being sealed with the spirit that is the earnest of our salvation let's go back just a minute I got a scripture written down here several of them so brother man wants to prove by the scripture so Rodin leaves the seals on the book are you with me here he leaves their seven seals on the book he leaves the seals and he just talks about a seal what is a seal so he shows us this and now it begins teaching on a seal he says now and he reads Ephesians 1:1 2:13 I'm not going to read all this but let just read his comments we find out that when the seal means it's a finished thing with God it's already settled and every believer was sealed with this promise from the very beginning because before the foundation of the world we were predestined unto the adoption of sons they men died he said before the world ever began oh what a hope that makes us rest that fast and sure anchor to the soul that's not tossed about here and there but anchored in Christ or hope that's sure and then program quotes this visions 1:13 predestinate us before the foundation world to the adoptions of sons by Jesus Christ oh how wonderful I love that a finished work with God amen are you glad in God's eyes your finished work but here on earth you're not we're gonna need more of God's grace we need more of his teaching more of his correction more of his love more of his inspiration more of his anointing but in God's eyes it's already a finished work amen hallelujah that's what the Bible says and then he jumps to Romans 8:29 for whom God for no so see first God had before no you would love him he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate I love this then he also called so God predestinated you he's also called you have me been called to the message I know I have and whom he called let me also so why we worried about being condemned to the devil if the Bible says if he's called us and if he's predestinated us then there's they were already justified and that means declared righteous let's push it now if we if we sin let's confess it and then we can no there's nothing wrong in our lives and then we're justified he declares us righteous Amen and whom he justified them he also glorified a brother and said that glorified means you got a glorified body waiting yeah that me and that glorified body is what father swallows up this terrestrial body at the rapture amen but Adam said that's that theophany he said and that glorified body come down and meet and they swallow up this terrestrial body Oh and that happens at the that the last Trump and that that's happens at that meeting in the air I'm looking forward to that so see look if he foreknew you and all these things he predestined called justified he also has a glorified body for you amen Oh a glory that is see this is not outside the Bible teaching this is just Bible facts this is what churches can't preach because the people get confused or they think you're trying to be too spiritual I'm not trying to be too spiritual I'm just trying to be spiritual I'm just trying to be as spiritual as God wants me to be I'm not making this up either this applies to you or doesn't but I say it applies to me and I hope you'll confess it applies to you t amen you don't there except that if you don't want but I want to accept that amen we should all accept that because you should say God called me God's predestinated me God foreknew me and because of that he's also justified me and he's got a glorified body waiting for me oh my right but I have said now let me just go to another scripture so he's already gone through two now he goes to third oh I'm sorry no this is the same one that's the same all that he foreknew he called he called he justified justified he glorified all the way from the beginning God in His great infinite mind foresaw his church and predestinated unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ to give them eternal life at the end of the age look what he looks over brother Neville the pastor he says what a beautiful thing brother Neville that just makes me feel lots better is that how it made you feel tonight I hope so it's the two old men in their 50s does that make you feel better he said oh don't don't don't you oh yeah adoption by the blood of Jesus Christ adoption means I'm as one of God's sons by the blood that was shed in my place amen I'm adopted by the blood the blood paid the price that I can join God's family amen Oh hallelujah that's a beautiful thing makes us feel a lot better you feel better already tonight you ought to now notice as we go on he says we know we're predestinated with the lamb the Holy Spirit is our seal the earnest means more is yet to come we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just a down payment oh how beautiful just the down payment that holds it secures it anchors it so no one else can touch it it's the earnest of our adoption amen the Holy Spirit is now the earnest of God in our hearts the adoption of sons are waiting us at the end of the road sons and daughters of God now let's get into adoption program breaks into the the teaching on adoption now hope this clears it up for you I've got your Bible let's go to your Bible revelation 8 I'm sorry I'm not revelation Romans 8:22 now let me pose you the question because I'm gonna give you the answer in a minute can you be fully adopted now on the earth you have to wait till later to be fully adopted now don't say it out loud because I don't want you to be embarrassed if you get it wrong I might have got it wrong too but let's see what brother Aaron says now some people may preach there you're you're fully adopted right now you're a full adopted son or daughter of God your name is just as good on the check as the father's now let's see what brother Branham taught in this message here and from I understand this is true all the way through the message so let's go to Romans 8:22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now my impression was grown in 2000 years ago what is it doing now you know sometimes I look at these animals and I feel so sorry for the animals and the trees you know because you can tell they're groaning you can tell someone at least I'm around they don't seem like they're very happy many times they're that their groaning waiting for the Bible says here they're waiting for the the new world verse 23 and not only so not only animals at nature and rent reason and all these things not only are they groaning but the Bible said now are they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the redemption of our body so not only our animals we'd say any living plant trees for us not only is every living thing groaning waiting for the new day waiting for the Millennium hallelujah not only are they groaning for the Millennium but the Bible said a Holy Ghost full Christian is also groaning on the inside waiting for the day of redemption amen to it now the word to it means means or is so let me read us again but we ourselves in verse 23 groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it that is the redemption of our bodies so now let me answer your question can you be fully adapted opted by Jesus Christ while in this body what's the answer is anybody know no good brother good we said the same time no you cannot be fully adopted while you're in this body the Bible says that the fullness of the adoption comes at the body change amen but listen if you're born again you've got the spirit of adoption in your heart are you with me you have the spirit of adoption in your heart that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you're not fully adopted until that whole nature swallows up your whole body and now your whole being is swallowed up in life and now you're hoping is fully surrendered to Jesus Christ amen I hope that clears it up we've heard a lot of preaching about well actually not me our church but other churches and churches out people I've talked to or they hear a lot of preaching about adoption but let me clear it up to you when you're born again you have this spirit to be adopted your that you're adopted in the family of God but the fullness of it in other words all the benefits do not take place until the rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ and that's according to the Bible Romans 8:23 here's what my ram says oh do you see it all creation is groaning said Paul everything is growing look at the trees by Rama the trees are struggling you watch wait to that SAP goes down they're gonna be struggling and the wind be dropping their branches they're gonna be swaying and they don't like that the Bible said they're groaning look at the flowers how they struggle for life look look just look for the frost to tear them down look at the trees how they struggle to hold out their branches out to sing the glories of God how we ought to sing our how we ought to raise our branches tonight and say thank you Jesus thank you that the wind of the Holy Spirit blow through this tree amen move this tree to glorify your Holy Name Amen no glory he said everything all nature all animals well not my animals well just see what brother Graham said to all the animals the Bible said all creation groans you got to pay attention your animals we got to paid better attention our trees and our property all the birds all the birds that visit your house are groaning they they're just groaning for something they're groaning for perfection they're groaning for that new day praise God they're groaning for the eighth day they're groaning for the Millenium and that's what I'm groaning for that's what you're groaning for a perfect day I want to wake up in the morning and not feel the back pain anymore and I'm a young men's I guess Benz would to hide what you call young I want to wake up in the morning and I don't want to have a headache I don't wake up in the morning and I can just do all of the exercises right away that's not going to happen but till that day but listen I still wake up and I groan for that I don't want to die I don't want to get old I don't want to you know go through the older the challenges of being old and so that shows that I'm groaning for the perfection of God I'm groaning for my glorified body and if I've got a glorified one I know I've got a theophany tool amen because we need three bodies for perfection amen terrestrial celestial and glorified how he flow from the enemy quickly and gets away so when birds fly away their groaning I don't have to run away from this I like to run away from that everything groaning brother have said everything the Bible says all creation groans and we ourselves appalled we groan to with them for you're waiting for the redemption of our body but now now they did all those years now now we have the earnest of inheritance Omar what do we have we have the evidence that God lives if you are born again of the Holy Ghost you have the evidence that God is alive we have the evidence that God is with us we have the evidence that God is not forsaken us number one Sunday night we got to share that when that beautiful I remember some people were here but Sunday night I preached on the power of Jesus Christ's name and I said anyone who wants to stand up and testify that there's power there's power in the spoken word of Jesus Christ you're feel free feel free to stand up and people just started standing up and telling all these times that they spoke the name of Jesus Christ and nature or creation or body parts and all these things they all had to give way because there's power in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'm glad to experience it and I want to experience it more and more praise God amen we have evidence I'm not talking about something I don't know about I'm talking about something I do know about there's power in the name of Jesus and I've got the evidence that Christ lives in me Oh hallelujah and we have the evidence he's not forsaken us that we are his and he's ours because we in our bodies where's your evidence brother yes yeah not in there it's not really here you could point and say you have some type of written evidence here but brother Branham said your evidence it's right in here yeah show me your evidence I can't I can't really open up this cavity right here but it's in here do you tell people about it all the time yeah I don't I want people all the time to come see the evidence of the living Jesus Christ and all those that have been called will come to it amen all that the father has given me to come to me he says we now tabernacle so we Tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that cries out Abba Father now Abba is a word of the Syriac language and so when the the author of the gospel wrote it it really Abba just means father but this is two languages if you read the Bible read the commentaries so this one's Greek and then this was in Syria so Jiri Jesus was using that that Syriac or Serie attic word I forget the name of it actually but anyways that the the right of the gospel just lists that when you say father you've just said Abba does every understand Patera is the actual Latin word is that right yeah Potter I think it's the Greek Greek is pretty close to that too at least what I saw in my Greek lexicon when I clicked on it today but other words when you say you have to say Abba Father you can though if you want I'm just saying when you say father it's the same as saying Abba to them to say well I have to say Abba Father I mean you could I mean you don't have to but if you just say father in heaven or heavenly father you said heavenly Abba that's what you said heavenly ABBA so notice brother Branham says the evidence that you have got in you is that you cry Abba Father that's the evidence but man aside now they are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all or have enough yet is this the truth now this is a different quote about the book of Acts shirker comparing this 20th century Church to the first century Church go ahead do that where's the power where's the love where's the purified church that withstood sin and walk with faith toward Jesus where's the unity you can't find it if this church has all it needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than they have today and the church said go to Acts chapter 4 brother Adam said this is an evidence acts for actually you know you don't have to I got a right here I'd I didn't think I put it up here I thought I changed the slide and I forgot about it so program says one part of the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost is you crying out to the Father in prayer I'm not talking about Hail Mary Mother of grace ER or dear dear God thank you for this food bless us for the food Amen or whatever rhyme you want thank you for the food thank you for the goodness Amen I'm not talking about that I'm talking about when something inside of you calls out to something out there amen when the Spirit of God in you cries out for your father that's what we're talking about and only the people have the Holy Ghost can really cry out like that because the Bible says they cry Abba Father and that's the evidence that they have been adopted into the body of Jesus Christ dori amen now remember if you know Acts for Peter and John were in the disciples had just done a miracle in Acts chapter three the paralyzed man walked and then they get they get questioned before the Sanhedrin they get threatened they said don't you ever preach in that name don't you ever tell anybody about Jesus don't you ever tell anybody thought william branham anymore don't you talk anymore about the Bible and don't you preach the message anymore and I said okay whatever is between you and God that's fine but I'm gonna honor God and not you they left there say you can do whatever you want between God and man but we're gonna honor God and so they were a little discouraged so the Bible said they went back to an upper room and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God now listen Church when was the last time you raise your voice in prayer to God I'm not saying you have to do it every day but when was the last time this is and these people are born again they got threatened don't preach in that name don't talk about Jesus so much and so they got discouraged they said we need to go pray and they lifted up their voices in prayer I sure like at this church at the end of the service when my voice isn't the only one that I hear when we're closing in prayer and the church said because when they now this is when you're really hungry for the Holy Ghost you cannot hold still if you've got the Holy Ghost in you and you're really crying out to God you have the Spirit of God in you and it cries out it lifts the voice to God Almighty so I'm giving you Bible Evans that's what brother Bram says this is what children of God do this is one evidence that you know you're born again you're not ashamed to cry out to God Abba or fire or daddy I love you you're my heavenly father you're my heavenly dad I'm going you on the scene hey man and you know when they call the Bible said lift over their voice and when they had prayed this is a prayer the place was shaking where they were assembled together and they're all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke the Word of God with boldness so think about when was the last time you prayed lift up your voice and you walked out of your clouds at all propose and full of the Holy Ghost hopefully it wasn't too long ago if it is long ago it's time to get back in there because when we pray like this when we cry out to God brother said I'm a father a real sincere prayer is the part of the evidence that you are borned again hallelujah and then again here's where Jesus said it and Jesus said Abba Father other words he said father all things are possible into thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but thou but what thou wilt amen now here's where it is in Scripture that this is all Scripture I'm not making this up if you were paying attention you'll know this is right Galatians four or five to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons so being brought into officially into God's family because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father that's one way you know you are a child of the Father because you're crying out to the Father amen that's how you know God your father and you're truly born again you're not ashamed to cry out to God you love God and you need him every hour when they're at whenever there's little discouragement you've got to cry out to God God put something inside of you a part of him inside of you to cry back out to him because you're a child of God amen if you're ashamed to play if you're shame to lift your voice if you're ashamed of Christ God is your father then I start thinking well am I born again or not am I born again do I have the Spirit of God because the spirit of a father cries out to God in that manner Oh father remember jesus said if it be possible let this cup pass Oh God Oh father if it's possible take this trial away oh man if it's possible take the sickness away that's what a child of God God loves to hear his children cry hey man he's got no other way to hear them cry then for them to just cry out to God when they're born again they say father I'm in need of you glory and remember Zeki of mine the same thing the Lord said set a mark upon the foreheads of them that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done the midst thereof sighing and cry I preached on that often but it's one evidence that you're right where you need to be when you are so sick of sin that it makes you cry and weep that's so bad that you want to see soul saved you're tired of seeing your family live the way they live your friends that live the way they live you're so sick and tired at that it breaks your heart and you want a crowd to God and say God save their wretched souls amen that's part of the evidence of being born again hallelujah now now the trees does not have it so the trees don't have the Holy Spirit Nature does not have it but yet we are still growing with them because as yet we haven't received the fullness of our adoption so do you understand now when you get born again you have the spirit of adoption but you don't have the fullness of adoption which is the glorified body and the theophany body because the Bible said the fullness is to it that is the redemption of our body but we have the earnest of it that we are picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of God what kind of people should we be oh my when we think of that think of it now we have the earnest our spirits groaning for the full adoption so see that's what we're going for we're groaning to be perfect are you how do you feel do you feel that way are you groaning I just want to be perfect before God I don't want any problems I don't have to deal with sin I just want to be in a brand-new body that's the groaning of a real Christian I just want to be perfect like Jesus amen our spirits groaning for the full adoption but we have now the earnest of it as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption or complete salvation oh how beautiful I just love that all right we are waiting for the fullness of adoption he says when will this take place the rapture amen do you understand when will it take place when you're fully adopted into the family of God the full adoption does not take place until the first resurrection which is the rapture that's what our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and will have a body like unto his glorious body so if I walked up the after service and and said sister Connie are you are you adopted the family of God was if she was born the Holy Ghost she would say yes I'm adopted family of God I would and then I'll say well do you have the phone and something doctrine she'd say no but I'm gonna have it one of these days right well Jessie are you adopted into gods family I believe I am I believe I'm born again the Holy Ghost are you fully adopted not quite not quite but I feel but there's something growing in me waiting until I am fully adopted and I can feel if they men I feel like I don't want to go through this I feel like I just want to be in a perfect body I just want to be like my Savior amen Alleluia because the Bible said for when we should see him as he is we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like here's a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off I ought to hear an amen on that so at least somebody shout Amen maybe and all the trials of life will fade away off into a little mist and blow away to never be no more goodbye troubles the wind of the Holy Spirit just take it away like a little miss see you later I love our brother Brahim uses these poetic words these images you know for us in our minds we can picture oh steam just vaporizing you know evaporating that's what a brother have said our troubles are just gonna be evaporated oh now let's get into the seven seals okay so put on your spiritual thinking caps your brother and says put on your good girls good I like acacia birthday girls got her cap on amen now the verse says verse run revelation 5:1 okay let me go back I want to read it the Bible says that the book is written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals okay so here's what I want to say about this this says that this scripture has been greatly misunderstood by certain groups which namely is the seventh Thunder movement which I've interacted with some people that came out of it and also a pastor that battle that brother of on carry on from New York he battled it he was never in it he battled it and condemned it now note some people have misinterpreted brother branham's words about what was written on the back side of the book the false teachers say there's more to be revealed that than that what was in the Bible that's wrong so these preachers will say well I'll see those readers riding on the inside of the book like this but then there's writing on the back and that's what God's going to show me because I got more revelation than you that's wrong here's the quote that gets misunderstood it's from services it's the end time which was a very deep message very symbolic lots of Dreams lots of visions they dealt with the cloud we preach on that a few weeks ago dealt with the cloud from 1963 a lot of visions now brother and I said look we're the voices was the thunders not in heaven on earth the thunders never uttered from the heavens they uttered from the earth I'm I understand that Revelation chapter 10 the Bible said the angel descended and when he descended he sounded and there were seven thunders of their voices on the earth praise God now here's where they misunderstand it it's on the backside when a book is completed not did he say on the front side he said on the backside and after it's all done completed then the seven thunders voices is the only thing that's stuck in the book that's not revealed it's not even written in the book so people take this quote and what I think I just I don't know for sure but my opinion is brother band just mixed up his words he's a man sometimes he did that but this is the quote that's so misunderstood and notice the false teachers say they have the interpretation of the seven thunders the book deal with the statute perfect man that's what the whole movement was around the seven thunders movement was saying the thunders that uttered were the seven attributes or virtues that we need in order to be in the statute of the fullness of Christ that's wrong they are the the the Bible said the thunders dealt with the seven seals not the Statue River man now the fruit of that movement proved they were wrong and what were some of the fruits of the movement the children of the founders were caught in adultery and money embezzlement and spent years in jail in New York City they exalted the leader of that movement so much so that they prophesied that he would raise from the dead when he died and he didn't so there's false prophecy all surrounding that there's money problems there's dissociation there's there's heresies all on that other fruit around this false doctrine is wrong in fact brother Craig and brother Dave Llewellyn I don't think they'd mind me calling their names but they went to one of those seven Thunder movements and the preacher saw how those two were not a mending like everybody else because if you don't amen seven thunders then they look at you like you're crazy because you're not getting in the spirit like they are and Craig said I just didn't understand what they were saying about the seven thunders and pretty soon the preacher started preaching on them saying we've got some he says some stale white popcorn because the church was black I don't know if the preacher was white or black or not I don't know we said we got some stale white popcorn over here that's not popping and popping like it ought to be popping so they got up and left and I don't blame them I would have got up and left too if you don't understand that how can you say man but if something strikes you from God your more than say Amen you'll feel the fire of God burn down in your soul it'll be a revelation to you it's faith coming to the believer and you'll have to do something because you'll be full of joy unspeakable and full of glory your cuff will run over amen I feel it right now he meant out of anuya glory but the fruit of the myth of the move was wrong and and I talked to brother LaVon he's told me numerous stories where he would go into their meetings and blast them they let him say some words he'd blast them from the pulp and they still wouldn't repent and knew it was wrong knew everything was wrong it was a denomination a denomination and he was invited certain meetings that would blast it all around a lot of people left but some people still in it and that's the quote they misunderstood brother Brennan told us the seven thunders were about the revelations in the seven seals how many understand that the thunders are about the seals let's go to revelation 10 all right now I just preached on verse one two Sundays ago and also on a Wednesday night yeah last Wednesday night I preached part two of clothed with the cloud first one and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the crowd that's Christ and a rainbow was upon his head we saw in the Life magazine and his face was as it were the Sun that's the picture and his feet as pillars of fire must have been the pillar of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now here's where it is that's the book that was in heaven the book that was in heaven was seven seals is now open the seals have been taken off the book and now the book is brought down to heaven aren't you glad amen it's brought down from heaven down to earth and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices so Jesus Christ descends and he comes down to the earth and he utters what the seven thunders say and it's honored on the earth it wasn't uttered in heaven it was uttered on the earth all this earth is so privileged to have God speak is seven thunder mysteries down on the earth amen we have to wonder it was it said well I wish I could have been there in heaven God brought heaven on the earth to show us what those revelations were in those seven seals Amen oh yes no member of verse 4 John can't write it when the seven thunders and other voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things that the seven thunders uttered and write them not and danger which I saw standing upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and he swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and all and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that there which therein are that there should be time or delay no longer so God was not gonna after that God was not gonna delay any longer he was going to do verse 7 but in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so we see the mystery of God cannot be finished until the seven thunders uttered their voices upon the earth as ever understand I hope you understand this we're gonna preach on Sunday night we're gonna preach on the twelve Bible mysteries because all the mystery of God must be finished praise the Lord all the mystery of God so every time the Bible says there's a mystery it's got to be finished and the church said it has to be because the Bible said the mystery of God is finished all right so don't get confused the seven thunders are not about the stats River man that's what the seven thunders movement was all about it was wrong what the brother did he just put a few quotes together from different sermons and putting together and that wasn't what brother man was saying brother Ram later said the seven thunders were about the seven seals amen now here's where brother ham tells you directly the seven thunders were all about the seals they asked brother Aaron brother man have you seen the seventh I'm sorry have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they reveal you if there is please see me afterwards please email me or text me or something like that please let me know why if there's any confusion because brother Aaron tells us no they say oh they are they no they were already revealed in the seven seals and I have to really feel burden to cover this here tonight now now this is in the church age book which some people don't believe I tend to believe it's mostly right because I've only found a few minutes takes now this messenger malachi for revelation ten seven is gonna do two things one according to malachi for that your heart feeling like you wish you lived in the book of acts days if it is then you're harder it's getting turn to the book of Acts if you see it then you need a heart change you need a heart transplant right your heart should be turned to the hearts of st. Paul to the hearts of st. John to the hearts of st. Peter our heart should be turning that's what programmes of ministry was to do if we're not longing for Bible days our hearts turning it turned a man but if we are longing for the Bible days if we are no need for more supernatural more of God and more of the Holy Ghost then it proves your hearts been tired amen it was turned by the Spirit elijha hallelujah that's one two he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which you are the revelations contained in the seven seals so some people say well I won't take this it's the church age book but what I do is I go back well brother Branham said it while on tape not in the book he said it the same thing the seven thunders were about the seven seals and then he says in the book the seven thunders about the seven seals to me that's unity to me that's harmony that's not disharmony that's harmony to me how does anyone else feel that's harmony to them now look this is beautiful this is why I don't want to downplay the revelation of the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths from the seals that Julie turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers if you don't see that's why this is why the the Seals has become education to people they just become dead letter to people because if their heart is not turned to the Pentecostal fathers then they haven't caught the revelation the seven seals it's not been revealed to them it's just intellectualism and they don't care about it and doesn't do anything to them in other words they don't want the anointing of the hour they want to be anointed with cares of the world they don't want to be anointed with the Holy Ghost who acts like a flying eagle in this hour amen hope you can understand that church I know it's getting quiet but listen that's important if our if your heart is not turning if you're not longing to see more of the book of Acts if you're not not longing to see return the book of Acts you have not received the revelation the seven seals because that's what it produces it produces somebody who rise up we're like with wings like an eagle amen it'll produces somebody who can renew their strength and become a strong Christian even though maybe they they aren't right now they know God's going to bring their strength back and they're gonna get their first love back amen hallelujah if they're enjoying living in Laodicea enjoying life and join the cares of the world they have not received the revelation of seven it's just been announced to them brother Branham said it went right over their head and he said so with a rapture go right over their head if they have ever received the revelation of the seven seals and brother Jesse said Amen I'm not upset but it's serious if the Bible is just an old Bible to you and it doesn't get you excited to read anymore then you're backslidden then you have not received the revelation because it is these revelations of the seals that literally turn your heart back I want to be anointed I want to fly above this world I hate sin I can't eat sin I've got to fly up in heavenly places amen that's what I'm talking about but see a natural mind cannot understand the spiritual things of God hallelujah and that's a mystery in first Corinthians do then the spiritual mind judges all your life it just doesn't judge when you go to church it judges when you go home as a spiritual is it going to draw me closer to Jesus cry is this gonna put my children closer to Christ or not a spiritual mind will judge is this gonna draw me closer to Christ or not a spiritual mind will judge everything and bring everything into subjection to the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah that's the two things brother Rams ministry was supposed to do turn our hearts to the father's and then also reveal the mysteries contain the seven seals which are the seven thunders and that literally will turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father's I believe the obvious that's just my testimony that's what happened to me when God revealed to me the seven seals and I realized I was born again and God gave me the born-again experience it set me on fire and sister Connie they have been able to put this far out no matter people my job or people my family I don't believe the message they have it for all these 18 years been able to put that fire out it just keeps burning but I've got to feed the fire rather go home and throw some wood some dead wood some dead ideas on that fire say God take away my ideas give me fresh thoughts from heaven amen give me a fresh burden for the word of God let me see the book of Acts of my life I'm yearning for that my heart is turned to the faith of st. Paul MN if not then you haven't received the revelation so it just was just was education to you and that's a sad situation to be in but there's always hope as long as you're alive there's hope amen there's hope for all of us praise the Lord in the Jays book program says this yeah program says it'll take a profit to reveal the seven Thunder so this is what we read revelation 10 3 to 4 is the endtime front period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth what was in those thunders no one knows but we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his spiritual scriptural revelations except by a prophet the word always came by prophet and always will amen all right let's review the Seventh Seal here for a little bit most of you can pry named the first seal what's the white what's the first seal I just said it why horse rider what's the second seal red horse rider what is what is the red mean yes sir blood blood red he had a big sore or in his hand very good brother good what the white mean anyone know what the white met deception why it was deception personation of Christianity what's after the white okay I'm sorry yeah white red I'm sorry what's that for the red my fault that's my fault black what's black mean capturing the wealth yeah a glory brother I mean it also means the dark ages in the dark ages he captured the wealth of the world and what's the last one hey Oh what's the pale mean spiritual death hey let's get Lord around with laws just different the good on that pop quiz there ha ha ha program said you're my class the RAM said that the church is the class the pastor is the teacher you can look it up other day I'm said that in the seals he said my class did pretty good he said got your notes in Benzes class he says class and I already do teach that works out pretty good amen let's reveal the Seventh Seal now the 5th seal you know was the white robes given to who juice the 60 it was the two prophets unleashing what construction during the Great Tribulation yeah very Simon see look everything quiet Darren and rather wonderful even stuff now behind those brother Ram said should give us the hearts of the Apostolic fathers if we truly believe those revelations and I preach it like this a noble Aaron's never heard us before other things test to me brother it means this we cannot let the death horse rider of the pale spiritual death we can't let him ride in our property we've got to turn him back and drive him back with the power of Jesus Christ because he's riding all over the world he's riding all over everybody's property except the bride hey man because momentum said best state to live brother man said spiritual death has struck the Pentecostal church thus saith the Lord he said it in the fourth seal amen it's already rode it's already rode in denominations and we've got to keep it out of our lives in other words we got to stay on fire we can't die and get tired on God we got to stay on fire for Christ that will turn your hearts back to the Apostolic fathers amen that's where you be the seventh seal now for all of you to know I preached us about two years ago because I sell this to the slides I just cut copy paste and some of the slides in here because this is where brother Adam goes with this so all of you know the seventh seal is the day and hour when Jesus comes back for the rapture just so you know the seventh seal is the moment of the rapture I'm going to show you about 10 quotes that say that this is not brother Jesse's idea this is brother branham's preaching and program said it was a ministry or a revelation I found it now I found it most helpful to start at the end of the ministry of brother Branham and go back to the Seventh Seal sermon so I started at the end when he said seventh seal and then I went back from 65 back to sixth I'm 63 now I believe the Seventh Seal is the day and the hour of the coming of jesus christ the rapture or the first resurrection now this is sixteen months after March 63 when he preached the Seventh Seal so over a year and a half about a year and a half later here's what my RAM said he said the last seal will be the coming of the Lord this is in broken cisterns I'm gonna skip down remember they which are alive and remain shall not hinder those which are sleeping for the Trump of God that last trumpet the sixth one is sounded and that last trumpet that like that last seal will be the coming of the Lord if shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first just resting to that time and what are you resting and you're resting in your soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean rest like we're not gonna do outreach anymore I want you to send out any more invitations you know we don't need to go passing out things we don't need to witness the people anymore that's not the rest thing he's talking about he's talking about resting in your soul jesus said come unto me all you that are weary and heavy-laden and I'll give you rest for your souls that's the rest that we need in this hour hallelujah now remember the Trump of God that's the very last hour shout voice Trump Trump is the very last thing as part of the rapture at the last Trump the dead in Christ rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord now this is in feast of the trumpet so this is July 64 now let me say this right here that every Trump of that blow blown under the sixth seal in other words in the Ministry of Moses and Elijah we'll get in that a few minutes where we caught the seal they're all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal because the Seventh Seal There was silence no one knew that was the minute or hour that Christ would come as he revealed to us and the church said brother Branham said Jesus revealed to us that the seven seal had silence because that was the very minute that Jesus Christ left heaven and came down to air to meet us in the sky for the rapture for the marriage as every understand that's why they're silenced remember all the all the beasts are saying holy holy holy all the sinner friends are saying holy holy holy everybody's saying holy all of a sudden the seven seals stop but I said that's because Jesus comes down to meet us in the air they're not gonna out holy holy holy why he's not there they're gonna wait till gets back the man said the Seventh Seal was the minute or hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us he says then again now this is where people get confused but stay with me the Seventh Seal hasn't opened yet you know that's his coming at the same time now as soon as the church the bride is jarred together she's taken up and that mystery of the seventh seal them or the seventh seal the mystery of going now people don't get confused he programmed said in the same sermon he said the seventh seal has been revealed to us and then he said it has open yet in the same sermon but remember HCO has three different parts to it so we're gonna go through that just a minute let me see it let me let me skip ahead to that so I I feel I feel I better do that right now brother Branham said every seal has three parts a symbol form a reality form and a revelation form did great if you knew that then we know that okay not many people just a couple well let's go back to read it so you know brother BAM said this in the first seal he said and notice the first seal when it was open the symbol form so see a seal has a symbol it thundered now what about when it's open it's reality for so what about when that seal actually takes place on the earth what about when that red horse actually went riding and started killing Christians it had to have another form john saw the form in the vision but it had to have a form where it actually happened in the real life does that make sense to everybody I hope it does see he said it thundered as soon as a lamb struck back the first seal what did it reveal not all of itself first it's with God so see first the seals with God next it's in a symbol then it's revealed three things every seal has three things about man tells us he is coming from fourth from the throne first it can't be seen heard enough and it's sealed up the Lambs blood paid the price at thunder would have spoke out and when he did a white horse rider started out and it was still a symbol so let's go to this so the first seat you'll brother branham preach it on March 16th the symbol form of the first seal that John saw and 89 D does this makes sense the reality form though took place that white horse rider actually went riding around 33 82 380 the revelation form didn't come until brother Branham preached in on March 18 1963 amen glory can I give you another visual just I'll come back to this I made this you - you might remember this there's three forms there so here's the reality forms of the seals in other words the white horse rode this long the red horse rode this long in reality on these dates and then the black horse rode this long on those dates and then the pale horse was riding today on these dates that's the reality form John saw the symbol form right here John's in a vision he sees a form 80 90 but the reality he form had not gone yet and brother Branham gave us the revelation form in March of 1963 aren't you glad oh my am i making this up anybody am I making this up or is this the truth of God I'm not making this up I just showed you the quotes and I'm just trying to give you a visual so you'll catch it brother in the same sermon brother Branham says the seven seals revealed and they says it hasn't open yet and that's because of what I just showed you I made one just for the seventh seal when brother Branham preached the seven seal it was actually the voice of God revealing the revelation of the seventh seal so the symbol form of the seventh seal was in 1890 there was really no symbol like brother and said other than just there was silence there was really no symbols no horse rider no robes the reality form of the seventh seal is still future and this is what brother Branham means when it hasn't opened yet the rapture has not taken place yet the seventh seal is not open yet but has the seventh seal been revealed to us yes we know what it means if the day and our miss coming oh thank you thank you Jesus oh yeah that's the only way you can understand it if you do other way you get confused and you stumble yourself and you get yourself all wrapped up I used to be all wrapped up in it till God revealed it to me that's the truth all right let's keep going on the quote so you know the Seventh Seal is the what somebody say the Seventh Seal is the day and what day an hour was coming that's the rapture the seventh seal is the day an hour of Jesus Christ coming in the rapture that's why the seventh seal means so much to us Church that's try I don't get tired about people preaching about the seventh seal because I want to be a part of the rapture a mehendi I want to know more about what I'm gonna be a part of I'm not I don't want to know about it if I'm not gonna be a part of it I want to know about it because I got a ticket to me there amen where is it take it out where's the evidence right in here amen where's the evidence that you're gonna be there right in here look real hard you'll see that the life of Christ if someone's got the baptism Holy Ghost you'll see the life of Christ thank you Jesus glorious brother ma'am said he revealed it then he says he hasn't opened it that's because the reality form hasn't been opened and that's what I put up there okay now here's that yeah that's the scripture okay so by minute jesus said heaven earth shall pass away my words shall not pass away I got to finish up that's our but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but the father how many remember in the Book of Luke Jesus said not even the son knows it not even the Son of God knows when the rapture is going to take place only the father in Souls and armed personnel program since the seven is always the mystery watch that seven that's the finish that was the coming of the Lord heaven was quiet silent nobody moved because jesus said himself not an even angel heaven knows when I'll return I don't even know it myself what time the father has put in his mind God alone knows of the Spirit and said I don't know it then it wasn't revealed and when the seventh trumpet sounded of the seventh angel seal was open and there was silence in the heaven see it wasn't given away what would place so John didn't write any symbol cuz there was no symbol given to it God want to keep it a secret brother branham said remember the seven seals where he said were revealed day by day in March 1963 remember he hid the Seventh Seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood by day by day but then he wouldn't do it on that one he said their silence didn't having no one knew it it was the coming of the Lord so see the reason their silence in heaven is because the Lord has come oh thank you lord is everybody catching this tonight are you catching it the seventh seal has been revealed to us we know it's the day in the hour has the reality form happened no that's what we're all here for that's why you're here in church tonight is because you're waiting for the the Rebbe the reality for mother 7co to happen raise your hand if you're waiting for the reality form of the Seventh Seal anybody waiting for that that's the whole thing I'm waiting for is for the reality of the opening of the Seventh Seal to strike me amen that's what I'm waiting for for the rapture so why was there silence in heaven brother man tells us plain he said the whole time the angels are crying holy holy holy there's silence because Jesus the body of Jesus stands and leaves the throne and heaven and comes down to meet his bride there here's her brother F says it in the Sardis and church age and Jesus comes from heaven with ten thousand times ten thousand of his saints and the Bible says that the heavens was empty for the space of half an hour where is this big fellow God then uh-huh see he's in Christ oh holiday where is God how come the angels are quiet where is this big fella that used to sit on the throne he's down there getting his bride oh he went in to snatch away his life amen before Satan could pull off his tribulation destruction and his wrath he went and got caught his bride away snatched her away the word rapture means snatch to snatch up before the destruction strikes the earth where is that big fella he's meeting his bride in the air thank you Jesus Christ the mystery of God reveal God's great mystery of it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know - nothing about it even the Angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't even know when it's going to happen see God has all this to himself it's a secret Christ in Ministry of God revealed and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven thunders under their voices and John was even forbidden to ride at sea the coming of the Lord that's one thing he has a revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't what if everybody knew the rapture was going to take place on let's just say you know 11 and 11 you know something like that what if everybody knew they'd wait until the 10th to get ready wait they would live like a devil all the way up to the 10th but that night they say a few prayers Oh Lord I want to be right forgive me get out of jail card get out of Hell card get out of tribulation card but see Jesus keeps it a secret because he only wants those that are going that way to live right in godly all the time hey I don't care it's gonna be they just want to be ready praise God and they're making themselves ready every day not just on Sunday or Wednesday every day that you understand every day they make themselves ready every day you ought to make yourself ready Wednesday and Sunday too I do I know about that I prayed a little harder prayers you know be more sincere days I got a preach of course we're all human Christ a mystery God again the coming Lord is in a mystery now we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he is coming and so was all the mysteries of God waiting for this last day after he's already been completed well then he reveals and shows us what he's done oh my he never gave his mystery in every let's say info ready in full so Jesus gave some of the revelation of 7 sealed we know it's the day an hour but he didn't give all of it it wasn't given in full and remember if we go back to that slide to go back to those three parts now this has the fifth sixth and seventh seal but I just copied and pasted this over on a separate slide this has been shown there was no symbol this is not known but this is known we know what the revelation of the Seventh Seal is it's the day in the hour of the rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ we know what that is because he asked to leave heaven so they stopped they stopped worshiping their silence he comes down and he takes his wife Hey all right now that church is this simple is this simple I hope so if not I'll preach it again Sunday night I can't do something that next Wednesday night I'll go through a little slower if you want but I won't everybody how you want the young I want my son and my daughters I want them to catch it that the seven seal is the last seal because that's what we're all longing for that's the V you know church I hope understand that's the very climax of history when Jesus Christ comes back and takes his bride away everything falls apart after that the Bible said that that God will that he will let as long as he's here as long as the Holy Spirit's here got a little this sin going on but once the Holy Spirit takes the bride off then there's no more mercy it's all judgment and that's the end of our history that's the end of all things because it's all going to end in a short three and a half year or shortly period after that it's all going to end sure that for that it's the presence of the Holy Spirit in the bride today that's keeping judgment off the earth amen so like I told you on March 22nd that's what I believe I believe it's right where the RAM said the thunders are already uttered the fifth seal literally sounded on earth on March 22nd I'm sorry the fifth under rather the sixth Thunder uttered on March 23rd and the seven thunders uttered its voice on March 24 1963 because remember that book was open it was brought down in Christ roars the Bible said he roar like a lion lion represents profit according to a most 378 when a lion roar who doesn't fear right sure the Lord God will do know nothing but he revealed the secret unto his servants the prophets so he comes down here he low roars like a lion programs preaching little man's preaching the gospel and the lion is wrong out the thunders of God and God's people heard it and rejoiced submit and their hearts are being turned to the Pentecostal fathers they met Oh hallelujah exactly right I don't get more on the seven seals I know about you but I don't get bored on them because they all point to the coming of my Lord doesn't bore me does it it's not education to me it's revelation to me because I'm flying above the pay a horse rider because I got anointing to fly above sin that's what it means I'm flying above sin okay let me close now now the whole reason and this might I hope this is okay the whole reason I went with over the seven thunders and the movement was to show this this seven thunders movement added on to the Bible because there was nothing in the Bible that said this the seven thunders were about the the the statute River man there that was never in the Bible and let me tell you this brother Branham says some people may say oh see it's written on the inside and the backside some people may say there's things in the Bible we've got to know to make the rapture let me tell you that's a lie I'm gonna show you about 10 quotes that prove it oh there's there's things that aren't written the Bible brother Aaron that we got a sister Connie you know you gotta you gotta you got to understand things that are not in the Bible to go on the rapture that's a lie from Hell program says it let's read it we will never add to the Word of God this word is complete and they're cursed you're cursed if you add to this or take one word away you're cursed by God to do it so see it's without understanding the group that did that they added on to it look what happened falling apart God does that God let time go on just to show that that was a heresy Milgram says we'll never add to the word now brother I was preaching in the seventh seal okay you know what let me see I'm gonna skip this because if this is where he says okay this is where the Seventh Seal has not even written the word it's a total secret that angels everything shut up he said what is the Seventh Seal it's the thing that Jesus said not even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about see he didn't know it himself said only God would know it so I'm just proving to you in the seventh seal brother Branham said what the seventh seal was it was the coming of Christ all right now let me get to these quotes I must have put that slide yeah I put that slide in the wrong spot I'm sorry forgive me let me put it in the right spot that will help us we'll never add to the word man so now we believe that God can do things that he has not written the word but we like to stay just with what he's written well God couldn't do that but if it's not written no thanks that's my brother BAM balled out preachers that said oh I've got blood in my hands you need to have blood your hands like the Holy Ghost then you've got the Holy Ghost we got blood your hands that's not in the Bible so it's not true if people aren't do things outside the Bible that's up to them what brother I'm said I'm just gonna stay with the Bible then we know for sure if you just stay with what's written in the word amen I just feel good I'm just gonna dance around yeah thank you Jesus I just feel good tonight we don't got to add one thing to this Bible Church we just gotta follow I know what this word amen this Holy Word we don't had nothing twittered there's nothing out there it's all in the Word of God and the Holy Spirit will guide us into all the truth of the word amen hallelujah Thank You Laura I'm just feeling inspired tonight amen Oh someone said brother branham well them seven seals brother branham that we'll be revealing the last day some great mystery how we get closer to God the RAM said no sir can't be who suffer take one word from this Bible or add one to it his part will be taken from the book of life what it is is a revelation of what has been missed back there to bring it's already wrote here it's in here and to make you feel good it's to reveal what already has been written see because you can't add one thing to it or take one word from it and the church said pieces the trumpets he keeps going now I'm gonna skip that because I gotta finish piece of trumpet same quote same quote oh hey here's another one let's see yeah so this is from 1965 someone said to me now well now some day the Lord probably you see visions Bill Graham will reveal to you what these things are and we can all get closer to God and have more power than we get in speaking in tongues and things I said it can't be that way because see I believe that were to be the truth and the Bible said whoever had one were to take one word from it it has to be in this word see it's the mysteries that the people have overlooked I hope you understand me tonight your chair our biggest concern tonight is that we do not overlook what's already been preached to us sometimes people are so busy searching for something new something new something new outside of the word and this whole time brother Graham saying it's not something outside it's not something way out there it's gonna be something that people are just reading over and they just read over the rapture they just they just read it over a heart that's turned back to the Apostolic fathers it's not very interesting that some program says I just come on give me something new and God's like it's right under your nose just get your nose in the book just gets your face in the book right but the people's overlooked well right there is where my message of the serpentine the true belief of the security believer comes where the serpentine come from church it came from the book not outside the book it came from the mouth came in today even now the Holy Spirit the supernatural power God is in the earth moving showing things and people run from it now I'm gonna skip this this is where program says not God doesn't heal everybody and he gives the example of John 5 where God here jesus healed a impotent man but there were some times God did heal everybody we know that some skipping past that let's go to these quotes oh I love this this is good oh look at this this is what I hear Pentecostal people say all the time because I work with them Church but please listen to me I work with them I've had them I've heard them preaches the kids of Bible club and I just sit there bow my head like no that's just wrong they they say well kids we can go to the hospital raise up ever in the hospital Mike no we can't and the Pentecostal ER let me drop this to you you're looking for a time to come that when there's going to be men rise up on the earth and go out in hospitals and deliver them and say the whole Hospital move out brother says don't you never be deceived like that you believe me it's a lie it never was done see it never was in the book did Peter and John and Paul do they go into hospitals and pull everybody out no but see the Pentecostal people they saw us try to try to say oh you have greater faith greater works than these will do program said it's not greater than Jesus you can't do any greater than creating or walking on water he said it just means more more of the same through a many membered Bride he said don't you never be to see like that you believe me that you believe that's a lie let's say that was a hospital he went in there by leading of the Spirit he found one man so he's talked about Jesus in John chapter 5 he found one man the hospital he spoke to that man he told him the secrets of his life told him there he wasn't able to walk and so forth okay all right let's say in our feet I'm gonna stop right there there was more I must have skipped over I thought there was more I must have skipped past it off to go through there and find that but I hope everybody understands we do not need anything outside the Bible we're not looking on the back side of a book looking for different things we just want to not overlook we just want to see what's already written right before us we just don't want to overlook the power of the seven seals hope you understand that's why we got to be careful you know I think Aaron and I talked about one time when if people are saying we got to have more that's true we may need more revelation but if we get revelation with rapture it's not going to come outside the Bible it's gonna be what's already written right here we just been having paying attention or in other words like this the Holy Spirit hasn't moved us to it yet that sounds better because I'm about to I'm paying attention every service I preach I'm trying to I take all those notes I try to prove everything I'm saying is the truth as a workman rightly dividing the the truth right I'm not ashamed of what I preach if you would know what I preach it's right up there I'll show it to everybody if they want to copy my notes they can have a copy of my notes I'm not ashamed of what I preach I'm preaching the truth of God but the point is we're not looking for something out there we're looking for a more revelation of what God has already given to us amen now how much you come here let's worship the Lord here I hope by this everybody can see the importance of the seven seals I understand there's men that are not called to preach and they preach on the seven seals and they lower the faith of people that's true and that's what the brothers were saying when they were here because I talked to brother Joe afterwards that's what they were saying those brothers had no annoyed I'm sorry the false teachers have no anointing they just make the seals all intellectual but when you preach the seals the right way you're saying children of God repent of your sins and get the Holy Ghost anointing that you can fly above your addictions amen and five of your problems you can soar above denominations and creeds and every sin you can mate everything you feel in your body your mind you've got a 5 of that by the power of the Holy Spirit that's what we're saying and whatever you have to do to do that do it get on your knees raise your hands run the aisles whatever you do without we have to do to get that anointing just make sure you're born again that's not that's not intellectualism that's pointing everybody for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the church said that's what we're all trying to do that's what I'm trying to do every preacher I write up here that's what I want them all you point everybody to the Holy Ghost it'll never add to this or take away it always point you to what you've overlooked what I've overlooked because we all need God's grace none of us that are any better than anyone else praise the Lord if none of us hear that I'm so good I don't need the blood of Christ if you think that you are lost we all need the blood of Christ and we all need his grace every hour that's power hits you in church I know listen me I'm not just preaching this for our church I know there's numerous families streaming tonight and all over the country and I believe it'll help them too by God's grace so the way I'm preaching I hope you understand it's for its for more than just us people are pulling on the worth of God in a different place just a few but they're still pulling now I want to feed those few they don't have a pastor on a feed on until the Holy Spirit can point them to a pastor because I'm not the pastor of YouTube I'm not the pastor of anyone else but I'm pointing them to a pastor that's what I'm trying to do by God's grace have any father Oh God thank you lord oh I feel your bonus tonight Lord Jesus I feel the confidence in Christ tonight hallelujah Jesus thank you Lord for this word of Revelation chapter 5 amen thank you lord oh this book written on the backside and within Lord God hallelujah your
