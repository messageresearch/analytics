[23:21] lord help me today so be the way one day
[23:27] at a time
[23:29] [Music]
[23:37] that's what Ephesians chapter 6 like to
[23:43] look at a little bit on spiritual
[23:45] warfare I do have lots and lots of notes
[23:48] on the kingdom of God and I've been
[23:49] preaching on that the last few weeks but
[23:51] I just want to start also on the
[23:53] spiritual warfare Ephesians chapter 6
[24:00] the goal of this is that it will
[24:02] hopefully help us to see situations
[24:06] better and to see how spirits may be
[24:09] working in situations because eventually
[24:12] I want to get to there's at least 16
[24:14] demonic spirits that are named in the
[24:16] Bible like infirmity Antichrist heir
[24:19] whoredoms there's all these spirits in
[24:23] there and when you can recognize the
[24:25] spirit and you're able to cast it down
[24:28] so I want to eventually get to that by
[24:30] God's grace so let's go to Ephesians
[24:33] chapter 6 and many of these you know of
[24:40] course the this can deal with your your
[24:42] personal battles that you have where you
[24:44] maybe you're getting attacked by a
[24:46] spirit of infirmity you can rebuke that
[24:50] spirit of infirmity or maybe it's
[24:51] someone in your family or a friend that
[24:53] you know or maybe it's something that
[24:54] comes to church and comes up here for
[24:56] prayer to help me as well
[24:57] to try to understand what spirit were
[24:59] we're going against by God's grace and
[25:03] we know like Jesus said with deaf and
[25:05] dumb spirits they only come out by
[25:06] prayer and fasting the other so they're
[25:09] certain there's certain spirits it's
[25:11] good to know what they are and then how
[25:13] to overcome them praise God
[25:16] sofie's in Chapter six
[25:25] sorry I just having trouble finding it
[25:28] there we go
[25:28] thinking about some other thoughts about
[25:29] scriptures season 6 verse 10 I'm not I'm
[25:38] not gonna get in the full armor of
[25:39] course tonight but I wanted to look at
[25:40] the kind of the spiritual warfare that
[25:43] started in heaven tonight I want to
[25:45] start there and then Lord willing the
[25:47] next few weeks continue look at these
[25:49] thoughts and then individual demon
[25:51] spirits fusions 610 finally my brethren
[25:55] be strong in the Lord and the power of
[25:58] his might how many like to feel that way
[25:59] you like to feel strong in the Lord I
[26:00] don't like feeling weak I like the
[26:02] unstrung verse 11 put on the whole
[26:06] armour of God that you may be able to
[26:07] stand against the wiles of the devil
[26:11] let's read verse 12 together on three
[26:13] one two three four we wrestle not
[26:16] against flesh and blood but against
[26:19] principalities against powers against
[26:22] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[26:24] against spiritual wickedness in high
[26:27] places let's have a word of Prayer if
[26:29] you haven't eaten your heart just make
[26:30] it oh no no none to God here Heavenly
[26:32] Father were happy to be in your house
[26:33] Lord yesterday's gone sweet Jesus as we
[26:36] just sang and tomorrow may never be mine
[26:38] so lord help us to take one day at a
[26:41] time or we want to take this day Lord
[26:43] and just bathe in your word and bathe in
[26:45] your spirit your anointing we want to be
[26:47] strong in the Lord and the power is
[26:50] might but we know we're no stronger than
[26:52] the word that we're living and the word
[26:54] that we're speaking so father help us to
[26:56] receive the word that we might speak it
[26:58] and Lord be warriors this week Lord God
[27:01] for the kingdom of God let us put on the
[27:03] full armor of God we know you'll help us
[27:05] Lord tonight in Jesus Christ's name the
[27:07] church said amen god I should be in
[27:09] cedar praise God
[27:18] you know we we have a lot of privileges
[27:23] as Christians you know the Bible says
[27:25] the angel of the Lord camps around those
[27:27] that fear the Lord and we all remember
[27:30] the book of Job right how job had a
[27:32] hedge about him Church I'm convinced as
[27:34] I've been studying this this week I'm
[27:36] convinced God spares us from so many
[27:38] trials because of the blood of Christ
[27:41] because we believe in the blood we
[27:44] worship we we live clean lives right
[27:47] we live clean lives I'm convinced God
[27:49] spares us from so much trouble all
[27:52] because we've accepted the blood and we
[27:55] fear the Lord we keep his word and so he
[27:58] set you sets a hedge about us which I
[28:00] believe is like the anointing of the
[28:02] Holy Spirit and the angels of the Lord
[28:04] now what's interesting I'm not going to
[28:06] give this tonight but there seems like
[28:09] there's times when there's maybe just
[28:10] one angel with us where there may be
[28:12] times there's more than what age with us
[28:15] because the how many member of the Bible
[28:17] said when Jesus defeated Satan three
[28:19] times the Bible said not 1 but angels
[28:22] came to minister to him it took more
[28:25] than one angel right because he was weak
[28:27] and tired from all the temptations and
[28:28] the Bible says the angels of God
[28:31] ministered to him praise God so they
[28:34] brought some type of spiritual blessing
[28:36] some type of spiritual anointing praise
[28:39] God when when Jesus needed it and then
[28:42] remember Elijah when he was with Kay
[28:44] haze' there surrounded by the enemies
[28:45] member of the enemy army and gazes all
[28:48] nervous and Elijah prayed and said Lord
[28:50] open gazes eyes and so there was a huge
[28:55] army of angels and gazing after worry
[28:57] about that anymore
[28:59] see and then member gihan got leprosy
[29:03] member that because he took that gift
[29:06] from naman and see that that was because
[29:08] de Heiser should have known we're not a
[29:12] man didn't do this God's angels in this
[29:15] amen the Holy Spirit healed naman we
[29:18] it's a time for us to take you know
[29:21] these garments of blessings you know
[29:23] like they were a reward and so the the
[29:26] Lord allowed him to be smitten with
[29:28] leprosy because he just saw the angels
[29:30] of God
[29:31] camped around he just saw naman get
[29:33] healed and he should have known this is
[29:34] not a time for us to receive any rewards
[29:36] this is a time for God to get all the
[29:38] glory
[29:39] so Church we must be aware of that at
[29:41] all times that there's angels around us
[29:44] and don't forget we're in a battle
[29:46] praise God if we're not praying then
[29:49] look at verse 12 if we're not praying
[29:51] then there's actually a period then in
[29:53] our lives we actually put a period after
[29:55] or not right because if we're not
[29:56] praying it that scripture would say for
[29:58] we wrestle not period it's a little joke
[30:02] there right if we're not if we're not
[30:05] praying then we're not wrestling against
[30:08] spiritual powers see and you've known it
[30:11] I knowed it when we're not in the prayer
[30:13] like we ought to be it just seems like
[30:15] life's going on and what happens is we
[30:17] put a period there and we're not
[30:18] wrestling because we're not praying
[30:21] because a fully armored Christian prays
[30:25] according to the net verse 18 so once he
[30:28] goes through the the six pieces of armor
[30:30] five of them are protection what is
[30:32] offensive the Word of God then this the
[30:36] action or the seventh thing that's
[30:38] mentioned the completion is prayer
[30:40] praying all the time in all situations
[30:42] now it's a struggle for all of us
[30:44] because we know we're in a battle but
[30:45] see that's why we come back to the word
[30:47] it reminds us yes I got to pray over
[30:49] this yes I got to pray over this we want
[30:51] to pray over all things because the
[30:52] Bible said praying always with all
[30:55] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[30:57] praise God and watching thereunto with
[31:01] all perseverance and supplication for
[31:04] All Saints amen now see God knows that
[31:09] Paul can't physically be with All Saints
[31:11] but his prayers are just as powerful
[31:13] amen because he's called to pray for All
[31:16] Saints even though he'll never be with
[31:18] them so it just proves that God wants to
[31:21] hear our prayers for other Christians
[31:23] and God will honor those prayers
[31:25] remember when Sampson Shetty was here a
[31:27] couple years ago his whole family had
[31:30] flu and that was on a Saturday night he
[31:33] preached for a Saturday night for us we
[31:35] prayed and he went to bed and he said we
[31:38] woke up he woke up and called his wife
[31:40] and said everybody's doing it easy and
[31:42] his wife said praise the Lord God heard
[31:43] your prayers all the flu banished
[31:45] overnight so here we were in India you
[31:49] remember that it was right in here I
[31:50] think it was yeah I think I was right in
[31:52] here and we are here in India we sent
[31:56] the prayers up for All Saints and God
[31:58] heard the prayer for All Saints amen
[32:01] I love that phrase God because God God
[32:04] would have put it in there if he's not
[32:05] gonna honor it so we can pray for anyone
[32:08] at any place and that prayer will be
[32:11] heard by God it's part of our spiritual
[32:13] warfare because we are to be wrestling
[32:16] against spiritual wickedness in high
[32:17] places amen
[32:19] now I want to look at this here verse 12
[32:24] Ephesians 6:12 there's four levels that
[32:28] we are wrestling with Church if you just
[32:29] look at this
[32:30] the first one is principalities that's
[32:34] the first level we don't wrestle against
[32:36] flesh and blood principalities is the
[32:38] highest level powers is the second
[32:43] rulers of darkness of this world and
[32:46] against spiritual wickedness in high
[32:48] places now we're going to show you
[32:50] tonight where we're going to see the
[32:52] rulers of darkness of this world
[32:54] you know it's scriptural it is
[32:56] scriptural there's a demon who rules
[32:58] over Northeast Ohio or Ohio it's kind of
[33:02] hard to say or there's a demon that
[33:04] rules over that's why there's an opioid
[33:06] crisis is the worst right here in
[33:08] Northeast Ohio so that's something we
[33:10] can pray for it in this sermon and we
[33:12] should keep praying for it if the Lord
[33:13] would remind us here it's Scripture
[33:15] because it's Daniel chapter 10 in
[33:16] Scripture there's a demon power us over
[33:19] all these areas and we we're the ones
[33:22] after Russell against it
[33:23] praise God because remember a woman
[33:27] that'll cut her hair the Bible said God
[33:28] won't hear a prayer so who does that
[33:31] leave a very small group in Northeast
[33:34] Ohio and very small and so see if we
[33:38] haven't prayed for that and that's
[33:39] something we need to pray for this is
[33:41] all this evolving fresh to me I haven't
[33:43] really understood this till recently
[33:44] I've been listening to some sermons and
[33:46] looking up quotes and reading a book
[33:47] about this see there's rulers of
[33:50] darkness of this world there's levels so
[33:54] this is probably the highest level
[33:55] Satan's pride the principality level
[33:57] because he's the the chief demon
[33:59] all of them he's the ruler of all
[34:01] because he deceived a third of him so
[34:04] these are the great powers we wrestle
[34:07] against there's four levels now I want
[34:11] to if you just look up let's turn your
[34:14] Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 let's go
[34:15] to Colossians 1 God created all of these
[34:21] but he did not give them all up or did
[34:23] not let Satan rule over all of them
[34:25] right so Colossians 1:16 this is a very
[34:33] striking thought I hadn't seen this
[34:34] before till yesterday as I was studying
[34:38] cautions 1:16 for by him we're all
[34:41] things created speaking of the Christ
[34:43] the word the word of God the logos for
[34:46] by the logos or the holy spirit were all
[34:49] these things created that are in heaven
[34:50] and that are in earth visible and
[34:54] invisible okay whether they be Thrones
[34:58] now look Thrones is the highest right
[35:00] because what is the highest dimension
[35:01] the seventh dimension what is in the
[35:03] seventh dimension the throne of God amen
[35:06] I'll tell you the devil will never have
[35:08] control over that way amen
[35:10] that's God's Amen that's that's where
[35:12] the angels of God might go and get here
[35:15] or Michael and wormwood and all the
[35:17] angels of God are there and say when
[35:20] Satan has access there but he'll never
[35:22] rule that amen but see Christ Christ the
[35:26] word the spoken word of God created
[35:28] Thrones dominions now this must be the
[35:32] next level down throne is the greatest
[35:34] one and then dominions or principalities
[35:37] I remember the Bible said that we
[35:39] wrestle against what principalities in
[35:41] Ephesians 6:12 so Satan at least has
[35:45] power over principalities and/or powers
[35:51] and that's also in Ephesians 6:12
[35:53] principalities powers rulers of darkness
[35:55] world and spiritual wickedness in high
[35:57] places okay all things were created by
[36:01] him and for him so God creates these
[36:03] realms and then in order to express his
[36:07] self amen remember God didn't have to
[36:10] let us fall but God knew he would fall
[36:11] so he could express
[36:13] self as a savior amen glory he knew had
[36:17] him and Eve would fall just like you and
[36:19] I would have felt we were in the garden
[36:20] as well but he wanted to manifest
[36:22] himself as a savior as a healer as a
[36:24] redeemer amen
[36:26] all the great attributes of God but some
[36:28] of these he created that Satan cannot
[36:32] overcome Satan will never overthrow his
[36:34] throne although he tried to her looking
[36:36] at that next he tried to overthrow it
[36:38] but he can never do it and then
[36:40] dominions so I'm not sure I look at that
[36:43] more but as we get in the next few weeks
[36:45] in Lord willing or principalities or
[36:47] powers all things created by him for him
[36:49] so these are the levels God created now
[36:53] let's go to revelation 12 verse 4 let's
[36:59] look at this beginning of spiritual
[37:01] warfare revelation 12:4 now actually
[37:15] let's go to verse 3 because we know this
[37:16] is Satan and there appeared another
[37:18] wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[37:20] dragon having seven heads and ten horns
[37:23] and seven Crown's upon his heads and we
[37:29] know what the seven heads mean and the
[37:30] ten horns
[37:31] remember the horns were the rulers that
[37:32] are going to be a part of the Roman
[37:34] Catholic Church in the Tribulation
[37:36] Period and the heads seven heads
[37:37] represent the Seven Hills now verse four
[37:40] and his tail drew the third part of the
[37:44] stars of heaven so Satan's great dragon
[37:47] tail takes a third of the stars of the
[37:48] angels of heaven and did cast them to
[37:51] the earth and the dragon stood before
[37:53] the woman which was ready to be
[37:55] delivered for to devour her child as
[37:57] soon as it was born
[38:00] so Satan takes a third of the Angels and
[38:05] then sends them down to earth to try to
[38:07] kill baby Jesus right right now verse 5
[38:13] and she brought forth a man child who
[38:14] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[38:16] iron and her child was caught up to God
[38:18] and to his throne
[38:19] amen there's God thrown ha ha ha they
[38:21] didn't he created that one and the woman
[38:23] fled into the wilderness where she had
[38:25] the place
[38:26] to God that they should feed her there a
[38:29] thousand two hundred and threescore days
[38:30] that's three and a half years that's the
[38:32] Tribulation Period that's the last half
[38:34] of Daniels 70th week it's the last half
[38:37] year or a half week rather okay now
[38:42] verse seven and there was war in heaven
[38:44] Michael and his angels fought against
[38:46] the Dragon and the dragon fought and his
[38:49] angels and prevailed not neither was
[38:53] their place found any more in heaven and
[38:58] that Great Dragon was cast out that old
[39:01] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[39:04] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[39:06] out into the earth and his angels were
[39:08] cast out with him amen so Satan we see
[39:13] the beginning of spiritual warfare
[39:15] started in heaven I want to give you a
[39:18] few names here so you can kind of
[39:20] understand Satan's characteristics in
[39:24] the Greek here Satan in the Greek means
[39:28] the accuser the accuser that's what his
[39:31] name means Satan so how does God define
[39:34] Satan he accuses people in the Hebrew
[39:40] Satan means opponent or adversary so
[39:45] this is how God named Satan oh he's at
[39:48] my opponent he's my adversary he's the
[39:50] accuser now if you know Lucifer Lucifer
[39:57] actually means a bright star and that's
[39:59] that's why some people translate as
[40:01] Morningstar but Jesus is the bright
[40:03] morning star but it shows that Lucifer
[40:06] was so bright that he was bright like a
[40:09] star he's the bright one so Lucifer was
[40:14] bright and we'll look at that just a
[40:15] moment but I want to go to one more the
[40:17] Bible said when the devil tempted Jesus
[40:19] in the waters the Bible said the name
[40:21] devil means Diablos which means the
[40:23] slanderer slanderer now what a slander
[40:27] it's harming someone's reputation by
[40:30] communicating false statements about
[40:32] them all right so Satan accuses he's an
[40:38] opponent
[40:39] but when he accuses he lies he puts
[40:43] false statements it also means a
[40:45] defaming someone's character so tearing
[40:48] down their character instead of making
[40:51] them have good character Satan destroys
[40:53] their character all right so let's keep
[40:56] those scriptures in mind there so we can
[40:58] understand Satan the Satan but he's like
[41:01] a dragon and he fought against Michael
[41:03] and his angels all right praise God now
[41:08] let's go to Isaiah 14 here Satan does
[41:15] all this damage with his tongue he lies
[41:18] with his tongue he's done all this great
[41:20] damage he's gonna deceive the whole
[41:22] world through his lying tongue he's
[41:25] gonna slander the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:27] slander true Christians he'll speak
[41:29] against them and give them a defame
[41:31] their character there's so important to
[41:33] remember that Satan does all this damage
[41:35] just with his tongue he's a liar now
[41:39] Isaiah 14 just a moment I'm gonna get
[41:43] there to verse 12 I know I haven't
[41:49] preached on this lately I can't remember
[41:51] the last time I did so I want to just
[41:52] bring it out here with Satan we'll look
[41:55] at how the spiritual warfare started why
[41:57] it started it's good for the children I
[42:02] don't know if I've ever preached it to
[42:03] my children or not at our house Isaiah
[42:06] 14:12 Howard thou fallen from heaven o
[42:11] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[42:15] cut down to the ground which did weaken
[42:19] the nation's see what lying does right
[42:22] see what slandering noses weakens your
[42:24] spiritual state right we can't have
[42:27] confidence with God if we're speaking
[42:28] bad about other people right we're
[42:30] accusing other people falsely or
[42:32] defaming their character and by this he
[42:35] weakens their spiritual state weakens
[42:37] the nation's because remember the Bible
[42:39] said they're gonna be rich and increased
[42:40] with Goods I mean they're gonna keep
[42:41] getting richer and richer so that God's
[42:43] not talking about weaker financially
[42:45] he's talking about weaker spiritually
[42:47] now verse 13 for thou hast said in thine
[42:50] heart I will ascend into heaven
[42:52] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[42:54] of God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[42:58] the congregation in the sides of the
[43:01] north
[43:02] I'll send above the heights of the
[43:04] clouds I will be like the Most High
[43:07] Amen now look at that my said at five
[43:10] times I will I will five times and so
[43:13] what what is his great attribute here we
[43:17] know Satan always wants to promote
[43:19] himself
[43:20] Satan's object is personal ambition I
[43:23] will do this I'll be a I'll be greater
[43:25] than God I'll be above God this is what
[43:29] he was saying in heaven now at church
[43:32] this is what I believe happened I think
[43:33] you can prove it just by the scripture
[43:34] he went around telling these other
[43:37] angels he was slandering God
[43:40] maybe slandering Michael Wright because
[43:43] he had a war against Michael the only
[43:45] way he could convince him to fight as if
[43:47] he was told him something bad about
[43:49] Michael Wright why else would you want
[43:51] to fight somebody unless you had
[43:53] something against them so he went around
[43:56] robear said and we know he split the
[43:58] church in heaven to Angel Church he took
[44:01] a third of the church he split the
[44:03] church by slandering Michael now I don't
[44:06] understand this yet but Michael's our
[44:08] Archangel but he's got to be higher than
[44:10] the cherubs right because Satan was the
[44:13] anointed cherub that covereth and
[44:14] there's always two cherubs right so
[44:18] there's only one Archangel in the Bible
[44:20] that's Christ that's what I can find
[44:21] I'm sorry that's Michael sorry Michael
[44:24] and then there's two cherubs that covers
[44:27] so I'm not sure how that works out in
[44:28] heaven at the heavenly throne I don't
[44:29] have the revelation on that yet but
[44:31] Satan wanted to be higher than God he
[44:34] said I will be like the Most High his
[44:37] position wasn't high enough he was right
[44:39] there next to the throne of God but it
[44:41] wasn't high enough oh my mercy not help
[44:44] us be content with where God's called us
[44:46] to be praise God
[44:47] so say it is all about personal ambition
[44:51] now don't get this confused with your
[44:54] own calling in life Mike remember
[44:56] brother man talk about Abraham Lincoln
[44:58] how he every Christian should have
[45:00] ambition so see ya it's good to have a
[45:03] mission as long as God's behind it
[45:05] right but not self-promotion where
[45:09] you're trying to put yourself above
[45:11] other people and the when you do that
[45:14] you slander other people that's how we
[45:15] know Abraham Lincoln wasn't a bad guy he
[45:17] never slandered anybody
[45:18] he was just leading following the
[45:21] leading of the Lord to set the natural
[45:23] prisoners free right then 100 years
[45:25] later God set the spiritual prisoners
[45:27] free by the opening of the seventh seal
[45:29] that's right he did so it's self
[45:34] promotion this is the heart of Lucifer
[45:37] this is the heart of the slanderer or
[45:40] the opponent of God I will do this I
[45:42] want my throne to be above gods so now
[45:45] you can see how the first spiritual
[45:48] warfare started one person wanted to be
[45:51] higher than another person so he went
[45:54] around slandering talking bad about that
[45:57] person until it started a war now look
[46:00] at verse 50 15 yea shall that be brought
[46:06] down to hell to the sides of the pit
[46:08] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[46:12] upon me and consider these saying is
[46:13] this the man that made the earth to
[46:15] tremble that did shake kingdoms now I
[46:18] don't know what's gonna happen he was so
[46:19] bright at the beginning but remember the
[46:21] Bible said he can transform himself into
[46:22] an angel of light as well
[46:24] so he can transform you know the kids
[46:26] watch this little app called Superbook
[46:28] you ever seen it it's a nice Christian
[46:30] kind of story they have Christian
[46:31] stories but you ever children ever
[46:32] notice how Satan can transform himself
[46:35] sometimes he's real bright sometimes
[46:37] he's real dark it looks real evil well
[46:39] when he gets cast out he loses that
[46:42] brightness because he's just they look
[46:45] on him and say is this the man oh yes so
[46:49] he loses all that and he's he's exposed
[46:52] for what he is just a deceiver is this
[46:55] the man that made the earth to tremble
[46:56] that did shake kingdoms see what is this
[47:00] shaking you know even America with all
[47:02] the gun violence everything why is that
[47:03] shaking people why is why are people
[47:05] worried about racism and all these
[47:06] things in the nation who's doing that
[47:08] Satan's doing that now right he shakes
[47:12] the nation so he can change the laws to
[47:14] get a more evil right for the one world
[47:17] government amen
[47:18] we're into a one universe government
[47:20] amen amen
[47:22] glory the government of Christ Jesus
[47:26] amen who rules with a rod of iron in the
[47:28] Millennium sea is this the man verse 17
[47:34] that made the world as a wilderness and
[47:36] destroyed the cities thereof that opened
[47:38] not the house of his prisoner so see
[47:40] Satan locks people in he changed people
[47:43] in his prisoners right he imprisons them
[47:47] and Sid that's why we got to make sure
[47:49] we're not a slave to any sin we have to
[47:51] make sure if the son of sin is freak
[47:53] we're free indeed we should have leave
[47:55] here chained and imprisoned in our mind
[47:58] or or slave to any sin we should leave
[48:01] free because he said it's free amen
[48:04] Satan's whole desire is to keep people
[48:07] enclosed in houses of prisons amen dori
[48:11] but our desires to dwell in the house of
[48:13] the Lord all the days of our lives amen
[48:15] to live in God's house amen not to be a
[48:18] prisoner to Satan so he's all about self
[48:23] ambition self-promotion in church you
[48:28] probably know it though you know the
[48:29] Bible says it every I forget the exact
[48:32] word in Proverbs but every struggle
[48:34] comes from pride for behind every fight
[48:37] behind every contention is pride and
[48:39] this is why because that's how Satan
[48:41] that's how the first war started in
[48:43] heaven was pride he wanted to be higher
[48:45] than somebody else praise God
[48:48] you know the Bible says that the Bible
[48:49] says if you got a gift their God the
[48:51] gift of God will open doors for you the
[48:54] gift in your life will make room for you
[48:57] so you and I don't have to compete I
[48:59] never had to compete you know with
[49:01] brother Brooks
[49:01] oh and he's my pastor I never had to
[49:03] compete to preach God just opened the
[49:05] doors for me I never had to compete to
[49:08] be the other Deacon and trying to
[49:10] persuade people you need to vote for me
[49:12] or you need to do that know if there's a
[49:13] gift in my life that God opens the doors
[49:16] for you right if you've got a gift in
[49:18] your life you want to compete one to
[49:20] slander anybody you don't to be a
[49:21] politician you just got to be a
[49:23] Christian amen
[49:24] because God the gift of God will open
[49:27] doors for you see it's not but same was
[49:31] on the pile
[49:32] dicks trying to sway a third of them now
[49:35] if he's got a third Church if he's got a
[49:37] third right that means there's twice as
[49:38] many angels as as try so many good
[49:42] angels and bad angels right so we're
[49:44] never outnumbered aim head and Bobby on
[49:46] all that we got God behind us amen we
[49:50] got twice as many angels and we got
[49:51] Jesus Christ behind us amen
[49:54] there's nothing to fear for the
[49:55] Christian praise God amen so what does
[49:59] he's a slanderer and since we're here
[50:02] flip over to proverbs real quick
[50:04] proverbs 11 if at all possible church
[50:09] when we hear about you know wrongs
[50:13] amongst our friends and things we should
[50:16] try to keep it quiet as possible there
[50:18] are some exceptions you do have to talk
[50:20] about problems I know that I shared
[50:23] things but I hear you know with people
[50:25] that have left at different times
[50:26] because I want you to know about it and
[50:28] wonder where you wonder where they are
[50:29] and I want you to know the whole story
[50:31] because they could come against me and
[50:33] you know try to turn you against me so
[50:36] alright the Bible said then that's in a
[50:38] rebuke before all so I've got a
[50:40] scriptural ability to do that I don't
[50:42] like to do it but there's some things
[50:45] that you can't keep secret you have to
[50:47] share other things you keep seeker we
[50:50] try to keep him secret now verse 13
[50:51] robbers 1113 a tail bearer revealeth
[50:56] secrets but he that is of a faithful
[50:58] spirit conceals the matter amen
[51:02] so after remember when we're tempted to
[51:04] tell some secret from somebody it's an
[51:06] unfaithful spirit but we want to have a
[51:09] faithful spirit in other words a true
[51:11] spirit we want to be a faithful friend
[51:13] now verse 9 is actually good as well
[51:16] let's go back up to verse 9 and
[51:19] hypocrite with his mouth destroys his
[51:21] neighbor but through knowledge shall the
[51:23] just be delivered see nice that's a good
[51:27] scripture for Satan how he's a slanderer
[51:29] he destroys someone's character well let
[51:31] me tell you about pastor Jesse he really
[51:33] he's not fit he don't really have a good
[51:35] character he's no good see that's a
[51:38] destroying someone's character but if
[51:41] you just got to talk of a problem will
[51:43] someone hurt my feelings and we're gonna
[51:44] I need to talk to them about that
[51:46] that's different we just don't want to
[51:48] destroy we don't want to accuse falsely
[51:51] and we don't want to destroy anybody and
[51:53] slander anybody's name and good
[51:54] character does that help by God's grace
[51:57] because this is how Satan gained his own
[52:01] church we'd say gain his own army by
[52:04] slandering Michael and of course God
[52:08] Almighty in the throne of God now let's
[52:12] go to Ezekiel 28 this is a good
[52:14] scripture you haven't seen it for a
[52:17] while xico 28:11 because here we see the
[52:21] the minds and thought of Satan and so we
[52:25] can attack with that this week we know
[52:27] who it's from
[52:28] it wasn't God it was the devil we don't
[52:30] want this kind of mind
[52:40] humility church humility we look at that
[52:43] the poor in spirit theirs is the kingdom
[52:45] of heaven humility god help us to always
[52:47] be humble xico 2811 moreover the word
[52:52] lord came unto me saying son of man take
[52:54] up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus
[52:56] and say unto Him thus saith the Lord God
[52:58] thou see us up the sum full of wisdom
[53:01] and perfect in beauty so the king of
[53:05] Tyrus is the devil right the Satan
[53:09] because he says thou has been an eID in
[53:12] the garden of God so that that actual
[53:16] the king of tyre the ruler of tires of
[53:18] that type there's no way that was him
[53:20] because there's no way he was in Eden
[53:21] right Satan was cast down to the earth
[53:25] the Bible said out of heaven this can
[53:27] only mean Satan and brother Bram says
[53:29] that there's a quote on that the man
[53:30] said see it had to been Satan cuz he was
[53:32] in Eden the garden of God every precious
[53:35] stone was thy covering so Satan look
[53:37] beautiful imagine every stone being is
[53:39] covering the Sardis the Topaz and the
[53:41] diamond the barrel the onyx and the
[53:43] Jasper and the sapphire and the emerald
[53:45] and the carbuncle and gold how many is
[53:48] that one two three four five six seven
[53:53] eight nine ten ten mmm interesting ten
[53:57] after look at my other ten
[54:00] the workmanship of that tablets those
[54:02] are musical instruments and of thy pipes
[54:04] was prepared in thee in the day that
[54:07] thou was greatest he's a musical cherub
[54:11] verse 14 now are the anointed cherub
[54:15] that covereth and I have set thee so now
[54:18] us upon the holy mountain of God thou
[54:21] hast walked up and down in the midst of
[54:23] the stones of fire I picture that stones
[54:27] of herb there's there's fire there's
[54:29] volcano fires going around and Satan
[54:31] just walking all over and then at
[54:32] creation right this is creation when
[54:35] there's fires upon the earth and all the
[54:37] all the mountains are being formed and
[54:39] there Satan just walking right along
[54:40] there because he was cast down to the
[54:43] earth he was in Eden the garden of God 9
[54:47] verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways
[54:50] from the day that thou was created till
[54:53] iniquity was found in thee by the
[54:56] multitude of thy merchandise they have
[54:58] filled the myths of thee with violence
[55:01] and thou has sinned therefore I will
[55:04] cast thee as profane out of the mountain
[55:05] of God and I'll destroy the Oh covering
[55:08] cherub from the midst of the stones of
[55:10] fire verse 17 mine heart was lifted up
[55:14] because of thy beauty thou has corrupted
[55:17] thy wisdom by reason of my brightness
[55:19] I will cast thee to the ground I will
[55:21] lay thee before Kings that they may
[55:23] behold thee that has to follow thy
[55:26] sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
[55:28] iniquities by the iniquity of thy
[55:30] traffic therefore I bring forth a fire
[55:32] from the midst of thee it shall devour
[55:35] thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon
[55:38] the earth in the sight of all them that
[55:39] behold thee all they that know the among
[55:43] the people shall be astonished at thee
[55:44] thou shalt be a tear and never shalt
[55:46] thou be anymore
[55:48] so that's God Satan's destiny a fire God
[55:52] is gonna start a fire on the inside of
[55:54] him and gonna burn him there then cast
[55:55] him in the lake of fire this is the the
[55:59] scripture so again we see he gets
[56:01] corrupted through his pride he starts
[56:05] loving himself too much he's looks in
[56:06] the mirror and he just he feels he's so
[56:08] handsome
[56:09] you know he's better than Michael he's
[56:11] better than the throne of
[56:13] and that corrupted his wisdom by reason
[56:17] of his brightness he was so bright
[56:19] Lucifer the bright one right so now we
[56:23] can see that Satan here was and the
[56:28] Bible also said he was king of tyree now
[56:30] during that time tyria was an important
[56:32] major Kingdom it was a great Kingdom
[56:34] this was about 600 years before Christ
[56:37] King tyre was a huge metropolitan a
[56:41] great economic place so who was the king
[56:43] of that Satan was the king of that place
[56:45] that's right so now with that let's go
[56:53] now as we said to Daniel 10 back to here
[56:56] let's see this again so you can see how
[56:58] there's demon principalities over
[57:01] different portions of the earth Daniel
[57:05] chapter 10 right after Ezekiel yeah next
[57:10] book now we're on time to read all this
[57:15] but verse 1 Daniel 10 1 and the 3rd year
[57:18] of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was
[57:19] revealed on the Daniel whose name was
[57:21] called belteshazzar and the thing was
[57:24] true but the time appointed was long and
[57:26] he understood the thing and had the
[57:28] understanding of the vision in those
[57:31] days I Daniel was mourning 3-4 weeks I
[57:33] had no Pleasant bread neither came flesh
[57:35] or wine in my mouth
[57:36] neither did I know it myself at all
[57:38] until three whole weeks were fulfilled
[57:42] now remember he was fasting and pray now
[57:45] this was a special kind of a fast
[57:46] he ate food which is not the best food
[57:49] so for us it might just be like a
[57:51] vegetarian diet right because he didn't
[57:55] eat the good food drink the wine he said
[57:58] for three weeks I'm just gonna eat the
[58:00] very just simple common food and I'm
[58:02] gonna seek the Lord about how long are
[58:05] my people gonna be in Babylon no but
[58:08] remember now I'm sorry you got taken
[58:10] over I Persian now it's Persia because
[58:12] this is the king of Persia member went
[58:13] Babylon Medes of Persians Greeks and
[58:17] then Babylon I'm sorry and then was it
[58:21] Babla no Rome thank you sorry we're
[58:26] so now they're the second kingdom
[58:28] already they're the Persian Empire Medes
[58:31] and Persians so angel appears unto
[58:36] Daniel he falls down like he's dead
[58:42] verse 10 let's go to verse 10 Daniel
[58:45] 10:10 and behold a hand touched me which
[58:47] set me upon my knees and upon the palms
[58:49] of my hands and he said to me Oh Daniel
[58:52] a man greatly beloved understand the
[58:54] words that I speak unto thee and stand
[58:56] the right for unto thee am I now sent
[58:58] and when he had spoken this word unto me
[59:00] I stood trembling as you know anytime a
[59:03] person sees an angel the Bible usually
[59:05] they're frightened it's not a fun
[59:08] experience it's a frightening experience
[59:09] because they're all holy priests God
[59:12] they carry the apprentice said the angel
[59:14] of his presence the angels carry the
[59:17] presence of God Almighty now verse 12
[59:24] then he said to me fear not Daniel for
[59:26] from the first day that now did set
[59:27] thine heart to understand and to chasing
[59:30] thyself before thy God thy words were
[59:32] heard and I'm come for thy words race
[59:35] guys see how important your words are
[59:36] amen that proves he's the high priest of
[59:38] your profession amen I've come for your
[59:40] words your words I believe that's for us
[59:44] too
[59:45] our words make it to heaven we just got
[59:47] to keep praying we got to keep wrestling
[59:49] amen
[59:50] keep wrestling keep believing if Daniels
[59:53] words made the heaven our words make it
[59:54] to heaven amen
[59:56] hallelujah now verse see your words are
[1:00:00] so important my first 13 but the prince
[1:00:03] here it is with the Prince of the
[1:00:05] kingdom of Persia withstood me one in
[1:00:09] twenty days 21 days see there's a prince
[1:00:14] there was a demon Prince that was over
[1:00:17] the kingdom of Persia and he was keeping
[1:00:20] out this one angel now isn't this
[1:00:23] striking I wrote this down yesterday
[1:00:25] God could have sent the answer on the
[1:00:27] first day right is God power it was God
[1:00:31] more powerful than the Prince of Persia
[1:00:32] yeah what does God do God likes drama
[1:00:38] all right God like drama
[1:00:40] he could have won on day number one he
[1:00:43] could have sent more angels down there
[1:00:45] keep this guy out
[1:00:46] but God won the angel to find a little
[1:00:48] bit amen
[1:00:50] I wanted Daniel to find a little bit God
[1:00:54] wanted Daniel to overcome amen God
[1:00:58] wanted Daniel to know the power of
[1:01:00] prayer praise God and so God sent the
[1:01:04] answer on the first day he knew it'd be
[1:01:06] a 21 day battle but God likes dramas and
[1:01:09] he wants to see other people be
[1:01:11] overcomers as well he could have won the
[1:01:15] first day but he said I'm gonna let you
[1:01:18] fight for 21 days so you cannot beat you
[1:01:20] can know what it's like to be a victor
[1:01:23] see God in other words search God wants
[1:01:26] us to enjoy the journey right we all be
[1:01:30] happy in heaven gloria sublime sublime
[1:01:44] sublime ram says but God wants us to
[1:01:47] enjoy the battles that's why the Bible
[1:01:49] said rejoice always and again I say
[1:01:51] rejoice amen God wants us to enjoy the
[1:01:55] journey praise God does it ever feel
[1:01:57] good no you know in our flesh the
[1:02:00] battles won't feel good to our flesh but
[1:02:02] God wants us to overcome that and these
[1:02:04] scriptures prove that God's with us our
[1:02:07] words go to heaven God's fighting for us
[1:02:09] he wants us to be fighters he wants us
[1:02:12] to wrestle on amen he hasn't won us
[1:02:15] quitters he wants us wrestlers that are
[1:02:19] overcoming praise God see he could have
[1:02:22] said it he could have said it on day two
[1:02:23] he could let the angel fight for two
[1:02:26] days three seven would have been good
[1:02:28] that's it on our completion right we all
[1:02:29] like number seven but he let him fight
[1:02:32] for 21 days because he wanted them to
[1:02:36] overcome now let's keep reading here but
[1:02:42] the prince of the kingdom of persia was
[1:02:44] to be 120 days but low Michael one of
[1:02:46] the chief Prince's all that's right this
[1:02:48] is one of the scriptures that there may
[1:02:49] be another
[1:02:51] or maybe st. was the other Archangel
[1:02:53] it's kind of hard I don't really have an
[1:02:54] absolute answer on that one of the chief
[1:02:56] Prince's came to help me and I remain
[1:02:59] there with the kings of Persia all right
[1:03:03] so see he had to get help verse 14 now I
[1:03:06] am come to make the understand what
[1:03:08] shall befall thy people in the latter
[1:03:10] days forget the vision is for many days
[1:03:13] all Daniel wanted to know was God he
[1:03:15] wanted to confess our sins God Israel's
[1:03:18] been wicked forgive me and my father all
[1:03:20] of our sins
[1:03:21] what is this 70 years mean what's all
[1:03:23] this when are we going to come back
[1:03:25] that's all he wanted to know and because
[1:03:27] he wanted to know the destiny of his
[1:03:29] people and he was willing to fast for
[1:03:30] God said tell that Daniel he's greatly
[1:03:33] beloved in heaven amen
[1:03:35] but you've got a burden for your people
[1:03:37] amen but you've got a burden for your
[1:03:39] family heaven loves to hear your prayers
[1:03:41] ain't had and then heaven loves you God
[1:03:45] loves you when you're interceding for
[1:03:47] other people that's why Daniel so
[1:03:49] beloved because he kept praying three
[1:03:51] times a day right and then he would pray
[1:03:53] for the Israelites he cares so much
[1:03:55] about his people that he interceded and
[1:03:58] God said I love you for that
[1:03:59] amen glory so don't stop praying for
[1:04:03] your loved ones don't stop
[1:04:04] keep interceding heaven will love you
[1:04:07] for that that's right see verse 15 and
[1:04:12] when he had spoken such words unto me I
[1:04:13] set my face toward the ground I became
[1:04:15] not dumb and behold one like the similar
[1:04:17] tune of the sons of men touched my lips
[1:04:18] and I opened my mouth and spake and said
[1:04:20] unto him that sit before me o my lord by
[1:04:22] the vision my sorrows are turned upon me
[1:04:25] and I've retained no strength like when
[1:04:26] brother Graham that's the same thing
[1:04:27] program we loose strength from seeing
[1:04:29] the visions for how can the servant of
[1:04:32] this my Lord talk with this my lord
[1:04:35] fresh for me straightway there remaineth
[1:04:37] no strength in me neither is their
[1:04:39] breath left in me then there came again
[1:04:41] and touched me 1 like the appearance of
[1:04:43] a man and he strengthened me and said o
[1:04:46] man greatly beloved fear not peace be
[1:04:48] unto thee be strong yeh be strong and
[1:04:52] when he's spoken unto me I was
[1:04:53] strengthened and said let my Lord speak
[1:04:55] for thou has strengthened me a man see
[1:04:59] he's weak but he says God strengthen me
[1:05:01] so God sends an angel God sends a man
[1:05:04] touch that man and he's imparted with
[1:05:06] the strength of God amen
[1:05:09] remember Churchill i2a the cake Elisha
[1:05:13] for 40 days guy said what was in there
[1:05:17] what nutrients were in there
[1:05:18] right well the angel put in there but
[1:05:20] God put something special in there
[1:05:22] whether it's a cake from an angel or an
[1:05:24] angel touching you God sends his angels
[1:05:26] to minister straight to us praise God so
[1:05:29] he won't be weak
[1:05:30] we'll be strong amen that's why God
[1:05:33] sends angels to touch us and feel his
[1:05:37] presence it'll strengthen us so we can
[1:05:39] keep fighting the battle amen so we're
[1:05:41] not weak verse 20 then he said knowest
[1:05:44] thou wherefore I come unto thee and now
[1:05:46] I will return to vacation no I'm
[1:05:51] returning to fight with the Prince of
[1:05:53] Persia hey so I got a little break to
[1:05:55] deliver the message now I'm gonna go
[1:05:57] back and keep fighting so apparently God
[1:05:59] likes battles that are longer than three
[1:06:01] weeks praise God with the Prince of
[1:06:05] Persia and when I have gone forth lo the
[1:06:07] Prince of Greece you shall come look at
[1:06:09] this
[1:06:10] now this is beautiful look what he's
[1:06:12] telling him because remember it went
[1:06:14] Babylon needs a Persia what was next
[1:06:17] Greece see some now he say after when
[1:06:22] I've gone low the Prince of Grisha will
[1:06:25] come and fight because remember what
[1:06:27] happened all the demons that were in the
[1:06:29] the Greek Kingdom they come and took
[1:06:31] over the Medes of versions so here the
[1:06:34] Angels basically prophesied telling him
[1:06:36] the Greek Empire is coming right the
[1:06:40] Greek Empire is coming so see there's a
[1:06:42] king there's a demon power that was over
[1:06:45] the Greeks and there was a demon power
[1:06:47] that was over the Persians praise God
[1:06:52] mine
[1:06:54] now what brother ham say is over America
[1:06:56] he said entertainment so a lot of these
[1:06:58] demons are entertainment right he said
[1:07:02] there's a entertainments fear especially
[1:07:03] Hollywood maybe that one's spirit of
[1:07:06] lust or entertainment or joking brother
[1:07:08] Graham called it but there's something
[1:07:10] here about Northeast Ohio with this drug
[1:07:12] epidemic it's worse here than I think
[1:07:14] anywhere in the nation have to look that
[1:07:15] up but it's really awful here
[1:07:18] now look at verse 21 well I should will
[1:07:21] show unto thee that which is know in the
[1:07:22] scripture of truth and there is none
[1:07:24] that holdeth with me in these things but
[1:07:26] Michael your prints look at this God is
[1:07:30] letting this one angel ride on the
[1:07:32] Prince of Persia
[1:07:33] it was the Prince of the Greeks is gonna
[1:07:35] come - why didn't God just what about us
[1:07:50] when Paul says for we wrestle not
[1:07:51] against flesh and blood he wants us to
[1:07:54] be part is wrestling match amen can I
[1:07:57] say like that let's not let the angels
[1:07:59] do all the wrestling amen let's wrestle
[1:08:01] with them amen that's why we gotta keep
[1:08:04] remembering these people with cancer and
[1:08:05] prayer keep wrestling keep wrestling I
[1:08:07] think we prayed for Kiley rose for two
[1:08:10] years I think until she finally got the
[1:08:12] victory with no more tumors I consider
[1:08:14] yes I believe God help the definitely
[1:08:16] through the doctors but I believe that
[1:08:17] was prayer too we eat some of us fasted
[1:08:20] and miss some meals praying for her it
[1:08:21] took a while but I believe that's an
[1:08:24] example of God sparing someone's life
[1:08:26] I'll be that's an example wrestling
[1:08:27] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:08:29] places I believe that I could be wrong
[1:08:32] now this one I was thinking about maokai
[1:08:34] naman Rupp you're playing but I prayed
[1:08:36] for seven years for a piano player I
[1:08:38] felt like I was wrestling for seven
[1:08:39] years
[1:08:41] Betsey we got one in a wonderful song
[1:08:43] leader to you by God's grace thank the
[1:08:45] Lord but that was hard I mean I cried I
[1:08:48] wept and I wanted I really wanted to do
[1:08:50] musicians you know that might be small
[1:08:52] for you that's great that's big to me
[1:08:54] because I lose all my strength if I do
[1:08:56] all of it
[1:08:57] so that's just example wrestling here's
[1:09:02] another one I mean this one that hasn't
[1:09:03] go to pass yet but with my dad we've
[1:09:05] been I was praying for my dad since I
[1:09:07] was five or six or seven years old and
[1:09:09] we're still praying for him he's 68
[1:09:11] years old that he would overcome
[1:09:13] depression we're still praying and
[1:09:15] church some of these things I'm sharing
[1:09:17] just from my heart because maybe these
[1:09:18] are things we need we all need to fast
[1:09:20] about like if you got a you know I'm
[1:09:22] starting to realize the spirit of
[1:09:24] depression the Bible is called the
[1:09:26] spirit of heaviness if you look under
[1:09:28] the scripture the spirit of depression
[1:09:30] has a
[1:09:31] I will name is for heaviness now we know
[1:09:39] some people can't be delivered that they
[1:09:41] still love the spear right but if that
[1:09:44] person really wants to be deliver deep
[1:09:46] down into it maybe God wants some of us
[1:09:48] to wrestle with that wrestling prayer
[1:09:51] now let me let me remind you this that
[1:09:54] the sister Megan at camp shirt she had
[1:09:56] the cancer on her leg like we told you
[1:09:57] about cam said they did a month-long of
[1:10:00] prayer chain or fasting chain where
[1:10:01] everybody took a day they just rotated
[1:10:04] and after that month it dwindled down I
[1:10:06] don't know how it is now but no news is
[1:10:08] good news you know but cam said that's
[1:10:11] what they did they did a fasting chain
[1:10:12] for sister Megan and then we fasted a
[1:10:15] couple days in there too I didn't know
[1:10:17] they're doing a fast and chain or else I
[1:10:18] would've invited you to do it I didn't
[1:10:19] know that till I got there and preached
[1:10:21] for but look at that look at the power
[1:10:23] break what was it a month long a
[1:10:25] wrestling match sorry amen see because
[1:10:28] there's demons the whole time let's just
[1:10:30] dramatize it the whole time there's a
[1:10:32] demon a cancer there and it won't move
[1:10:34] for whatever reason
[1:10:36] well there was demons wrestling up here
[1:10:38] keeping the healing away
[1:10:40] ah but each person would take a day and
[1:10:43] fast and pray and pretty soon all these
[1:10:46] prayers would keep going up they'd go up
[1:10:48] and then God would eventually send the
[1:10:50] answer down and she got healing amen
[1:10:53] I don't know how exactly works but
[1:10:55] finally I said like this an angel of
[1:10:57] healing broke through amen I know yeah
[1:11:02] fasting chains see the Bible said we
[1:11:06] wrestle not against flesh and blood so I
[1:11:09] believe God has called us to wrestle at
[1:11:11] some point don't you just to take a day
[1:11:15] and just instead of eating for those few
[1:11:17] meals just spend a few minutes praying I
[1:11:19] rebuke that cancer no that's what we
[1:11:21] need to pray about think about doing
[1:11:23] these things I need to rebuke this I
[1:11:25] rebuke the spirit of depression in the
[1:11:26] name of Jesus Christ and keep letting it
[1:11:29] go up because it's a wrestling match it
[1:11:32] may not come out the first day but we
[1:11:34] got to keep praying because God is going
[1:11:36] to come for those words amen if it lines
[1:11:39] up with God's will God's gonna answer
[1:11:41] those words that come forth he wants to
[1:11:44] see the
[1:11:45] eris come up to him does that help by
[1:11:46] God's grace so see there's demon
[1:11:49] principalities that were wrestling
[1:11:52] against that are over nations and over
[1:11:54] areas and we're called to pray against
[1:11:58] them now I don't know I'm getting a book
[1:12:00] this week and I'm gonna preach on it
[1:12:01] maybe next week but I told you this a
[1:12:04] few weeks ago the this nation started
[1:12:07] through praying and fasting this nation
[1:12:10] would not be where it is without praying
[1:12:12] and fasting see that means there was
[1:12:15] like a demon power over this Great
[1:12:17] Britain in North America but those
[1:12:20] those founding fathers fasted and prayed
[1:12:23] and fasted prayed until the angels of
[1:12:25] God brought the victory amen I was
[1:12:28] reading some testimonies where they
[1:12:29] should not have won many of these mouths
[1:12:30] like I was listening to a historian talk
[1:12:33] and he said he said America even before
[1:12:37] even before they had a Navy defeated the
[1:12:40] Great Britain's Navy and they and Great
[1:12:43] Britain actually had a navy we didn't
[1:12:44] even have it established Navy and when
[1:12:47] they when eight went when the soldiers
[1:12:48] brought back the report that we defeated
[1:12:50] the the Navy all the founding fathers
[1:12:53] met there they said the reason we won is
[1:12:55] because we fasted let's fast again so
[1:12:59] because God was helping a army of
[1:13:01] nobodies defeat the greatest army the
[1:13:03] Lord ever seen why because they were
[1:13:05] praying and fasting they realized we're
[1:13:07] not resting against Great Britain we're
[1:13:08] wrestling against demon powers at high
[1:13:10] places they want to keep us under this
[1:13:13] Anglican and Catholic dogma amen this
[1:13:18] nation was founded on prayer and fasting
[1:13:20] on wrestling with demon powers I'm going
[1:13:22] to try to finish here so I'm getting a
[1:13:25] book on that I want to look at it at
[1:13:26] that this week is just a short book it's
[1:13:28] called shaping history through praying
[1:13:30] and fasting I'm getting a book on that
[1:13:32] because the church that's what Daniel 10
[1:13:34] is Daniel 10 is God's shaping the
[1:13:37] history of Israel through his prayer and
[1:13:39] fasting God was showing Daniel how is my
[1:13:43] nation going to be shaped what's the
[1:13:45] history of Israel gonna be and he only
[1:13:47] found out through prayer and fasting now
[1:13:51] what do you think the rapture is going
[1:13:52] to be just the rapture without pregnant
[1:13:53] fasting if we were if we were to go to a
[1:13:57] heavenly nation
[1:13:59] we're not trying to take over a natural
[1:14:01] nation we're trying to go to the
[1:14:02] heavenly nation amen are we gonna get
[1:14:05] there without prayer and fasting
[1:14:06] undoubted because jesus said while I'm
[1:14:09] here they won't fast amen but once I'm
[1:14:12] gone my disciples will fast amen
[1:14:15] hallelujah
[1:14:17] but we know fasting and free and praying
[1:14:19] that's the hardest that's the least
[1:14:21] popular preaching usually so we need to
[1:14:24] get we need to be open to that we didn't
[1:14:26] let the Holy Spirit guide us into those
[1:14:28] things because there's three things
[1:14:30] Jesus said he said make sure you pray
[1:14:31] give alms and fast he said when you pray
[1:14:34] go in the closet when you give alms
[1:14:36] doing secret and when you fast he didn't
[1:14:38] say if you fast he didn't say if you
[1:14:40] pray he didn't say if you give alms he
[1:14:42] said when you do it we've got to do it
[1:14:46] and see God's leading us he's giving us
[1:14:48] reminders of that so we can see these
[1:14:50] things alright let me close here praise
[1:14:54] God so God sent the answer on the first
[1:14:58] day but God likes drama and he wanted to
[1:15:00] see the overcomers battle you want to
[1:15:04] see Daniel keep praying
[1:15:06] all right well Lydia can you switch over
[1:15:13] here go to Daniel chapter Daniel 12:1 I
[1:15:27] want to play a youtube video in just a
[1:15:29] moment hopefully the volume works this
[1:15:34] is a beautiful video about Israel
[1:15:36] six-day war do you remember that lives
[1:15:39] from 1948 remember the six-day war we'll
[1:15:42] look at that in just a moment here let's
[1:15:43] go to Daniel chapter 12 see Michael is
[1:15:46] always connected to Israel now he's got
[1:15:49] some connection I think to the bride as
[1:15:51] well because he was there or he was the
[1:15:55] one that Satan argue with and said where
[1:15:57] is Moses resurrected body he said the
[1:15:59] Lord rebuke thee so Michael is connected
[1:16:01] to resurrections as well but he's also
[1:16:04] connected to Israel and then remember
[1:16:06] there's a shocked voice Trump the voice
[1:16:07] is the voice of an archangel so to me
[1:16:12] seems like well the only arc angel by
[1:16:14] name in the Bible is Michael that's the
[1:16:17] only one so it seemed like there's a
[1:16:18] connection with Michael and I remember
[1:16:20] the second the second one the voice of
[1:16:22] the Archangel raises the dead in Christ
[1:16:24] the shout gets us ready it's the it's
[1:16:27] the the shot that goes out to get
[1:16:28] everybody gathered to the rapture the
[1:16:30] voice of the Archangel raises the dead
[1:16:32] in Christ and the Trump of God changes
[1:16:34] our bodies amen those are the three the
[1:16:39] shout gathers us the voice of the
[1:16:41] Archangel raises the dead in Christ and
[1:16:43] the Trump of God the Bible said when the
[1:16:45] Trump of God sounds were changed in a
[1:16:47] moment tweak of an eye Amen so the
[1:16:50] trumpets for our body change but the
[1:16:52] voice the Archangel is for the dead
[1:16:54] Saints to rise there's some connection
[1:16:56] there again with Michael and resurrected
[1:16:58] bodies or some great connection
[1:17:01] now Daniel 12 verse 1 and at that time
[1:17:04] shall Michael stand up the Great Prince
[1:17:05] which standeth for the children of thy
[1:17:08] people and there should be a time of
[1:17:11] trouble such as never was since there
[1:17:13] was a nation even to that same time and
[1:17:14] at that time thy people shall be
[1:17:16] delivered that's Israel every one that
[1:17:18] shall be found written in the book now
[1:17:21] Church who always stands up for Israel
[1:17:23] Michael does that means when that one
[1:17:30] angel was trying to get the Daniel he's
[1:17:31] wrestling for 21 days Michael came right
[1:17:34] there and stood up for he said let's
[1:17:37] fight buddy you want some of me come on
[1:17:40] he said hold him off all right angel you
[1:17:42] go down to talk to Daniel he held him
[1:17:44] right there come on you want some of
[1:17:46] this you know he he gave a good fight
[1:17:48] he stood up for Israel the prayer was
[1:17:52] borders no some Michael come and a for
[1:17:54] Israel so that angel could get through
[1:17:56] and here Michael is gonna stand up for
[1:18:00] the 144,000 that's what the Bible says
[1:18:03] here because this is the time of trouble
[1:18:04] he stands up for thy people Israel now I
[1:18:08] I'm just I'm just gonna say I'm
[1:18:11] presuming on this I'm not saying this is
[1:18:12] absolutely but it looks like God
[1:18:14] intervened for Israel through Michael on
[1:18:17] Israel's six-day war did you know that
[1:18:21] Mike watch this video it's only six
[1:18:24] minutes long
[1:18:25] in 1948 Ivan II was Israel surrounded on
[1:18:28] three sides it only has three sides
[1:18:30] because one of the sides is the
[1:18:31] Mediterranean Sea it only has three
[1:18:34] sides and it was surrounded by by every
[1:18:37] maokai you know about the six-day war
[1:18:38] yeah you got a big smile on your face
[1:18:40] he's excited about this church they were
[1:18:43] surrounded on all three sides they were
[1:18:45] outnumbered by twice as many by the
[1:18:48] number of you'll see on here the number
[1:18:50] of soldiers they were outnumbered three
[1:18:53] times the number of tanks and they had
[1:18:57] sworn we're gonna throw in Israel we're
[1:18:59] gonna drive them out and a lot of
[1:19:02] israel's just trying to get out they
[1:19:03] thought it was gonna be another
[1:19:04] Holocaust but then all these
[1:19:06] supernatural things started happening oh
[1:19:09] because you can't destroy Israel because
[1:19:12] God's with Israel amen
[1:19:13] and so I believe it was angels that
[1:19:17] interacted here so let's play this again
[1:19:20] is the sound coming through there the
[1:19:25] flink of annihilation now the Arab
[1:19:32] nations surrounding Israel vowed to make
[1:19:34] the blue Mediterranean run red with the
[1:19:37] blood of Jews who was thinking in terms
[1:19:43] on the morning of June 5th 1967 or 67
[1:19:48] blue one of the first missions against
[1:19:51] Egyptian airfields in the Sinai the
[1:19:54] matter of life and death this is going
[1:20:00] to be destroyed so these three nations
[1:20:03] that surround them and they were
[1:20:04] swearing these Palestinians we're gonna
[1:20:06] drown Israel in the in the Mediterranean
[1:20:09] we're gonna drown them there and these
[1:20:11] guys were some of the guys that actually
[1:20:12] fought in the war sixty-seven on key
[1:20:14] thing at 48 but 67 sorry people were
[1:20:19] people are talking about the imminent
[1:20:22] destruction of the State of Israel off
[1:20:25] solo in which there will be an enormous
[1:20:28] number of Kennedy's at least and health
[1:20:31] people will be killed rabbis in
[1:20:33] Jerusalem anticipated so many deaths
[1:20:35] they actually designated all of the
[1:20:38] public parks
[1:20:39] Terri's did you hear that the rabbis
[1:20:42] were so worried about this war we're
[1:20:44] gonna they said we're gonna change all
[1:20:45] the parks in the cemeteries so lot of
[1:20:48] them didn't have faith but God never
[1:20:52] left them amen
[1:20:53] even though he's blinded them God never
[1:20:54] left them the joke in Israel was last
[1:20:59] ones out turn off the lights but this
[1:21:02] black humor so people leave in Israel
[1:21:04] hear that many Israeli genuinely
[1:21:07] anticipated a catastrophe Israel found
[1:21:10] itself outnumbered and outgunned on
[1:21:12] three fronts Egypt to the South Jordan
[1:21:15] to the east and Syria to the north Egypt
[1:21:18] Jordan Syria they were surrounded how
[1:21:20] many times was Israel surrounded and God
[1:21:22] always came through for it happened
[1:21:25] again in 67 see these are Bible days
[1:21:27] we're living in Bible days amen Soviet
[1:21:36] Union given two billion dollars worth of
[1:21:38] arms and machinery to those three
[1:21:39] nations to destroy history go by so many
[1:21:44] soldiers three times tanks four times as
[1:21:48] many airplanes before the war Egypt is
[1:21:52] your main enemy suffered a series of
[1:21:54] major mistakes in mishaps so right
[1:21:58] before the war Egypt made a bunch of
[1:21:59] mistakes and I was gonna list all their
[1:22:01] mistakes that they made before the war
[1:22:03] gory miscommunication what they sold so
[1:22:20] the president has top generals had all
[1:22:22] this miscommunication somehow they
[1:22:24] weren't understanding each other Egypt
[1:22:36] High Command as they could hear even the
[1:22:38] Israelites could hear their
[1:22:39] communication and they they knew they
[1:22:41] were in one Accord so they're listening
[1:22:43] to them it was all confusion on that
[1:22:44] side but Israel had all the
[1:22:46] understanding amen glory
[1:22:50] yes warnings a mid-level Egyptian
[1:22:53] intelligence officers of an imminent
[1:22:55] Israeli air attack so the one thing was
[1:22:58] also they got warnings but they kind of
[1:22:59] played off Pearl Harbor they got the
[1:23:01] warnings but oh nothing's gonna happen
[1:23:03] where the were Egypt you know but they
[1:23:07] came Egypt's commander-in-chief up in a
[1:23:11] mere gathered his High Command for a
[1:23:13] party and an airbase did you hear that
[1:23:17] the Egyptian military meant he took all
[1:23:20] the generals and had a party he took
[1:23:22] them out of the front lines and had a
[1:23:24] big party that remind you of Belshazzar
[1:23:26] having a party on the night before the
[1:23:29] war starts and so all the generals are
[1:23:31] off the front lines and here's Israel so
[1:23:33] the enemy's moving back in Israel's
[1:23:35] coming in amen God knows how to
[1:23:37] orchestrate it amen you Church we just
[1:23:40] got to stand for God amen
[1:23:41] if God will backup these that are blind
[1:23:44] and don't even know the blood of Jesus
[1:23:46] Christ
[1:23:46] how much will God be with us as well
[1:23:48] amen but we got to be willing to 5 amen
[1:23:51] will understand willing to wrestle
[1:23:53] against all the wicked demon powers they
[1:23:59] were caught by surprise and we're trying
[1:24:01] to take to the air in order to join
[1:24:04] their meanings they couldn't do it two
[1:24:06] weeks before the war Egypt replace
[1:24:08] nearly all of its commanders in Sinai
[1:24:10] with officers unfamiliar with the
[1:24:13] terrain so Egypt for some reason two
[1:24:16] weeks before the war they take all the
[1:24:18] officers that are familiar with the
[1:24:19] terrain of Israel and Egypt and know how
[1:24:22] to fight they just replace them with new
[1:24:24] guys that know nothing about it
[1:24:26] see God will confuse your enemy amen if
[1:24:30] he confused Israel's enemy he'll
[1:24:31] confused your enemy too
[1:24:33] amen they sent a red alert to Cairo but
[1:24:43] the decoding officer used the wrong days
[1:24:46] code and failed to decipher the final
[1:24:49] information okay you hear that they they
[1:24:51] detected Israel coming and they sent the
[1:24:53] co but they set it for the wrong day
[1:24:55] it's kind of a they put the wrong
[1:24:57] password in or something like that and
[1:24:59] then and then the forces never got the
[1:25:01] warning that Israel's coming
[1:25:03] sorry so remain
[1:25:04] the surprise attack amen God kept their
[1:25:07] attack a surprise amen
[1:25:09] so he confuses them he keeps them
[1:25:11] miscommunicating makes them make all
[1:25:13] these bad moves why because God's
[1:25:15] protecting his people the battle belongs
[1:25:18] to the Lord brother hey this morning
[1:25:25] never came Sara Ziggler who's written in
[1:25:37] the six-day war believe this series of
[1:25:39] Egyptian mistakes reveals the work of an
[1:25:42] unseen hand oh what a lucky coincidence
[1:25:46] or you can see the divine hand we see
[1:25:49] this that God arranged all these things
[1:25:53] that happen the way they did because he
[1:25:55] wanted me Israeli strike to succeed you
[1:25:58] wanted us to win you wanted us to regain
[1:26:00] our holy places to solve the confusion
[1:26:02] in the Egyptian command just before the
[1:26:04] war evoked memories of the biblical
[1:26:07] story of Gideon routing the enemies of
[1:26:10] Israel instead of annihilation Israel
[1:26:13] won one of the most decisive victories
[1:26:15] in military history many Orthodox Jews
[1:26:18] and Christians believe the Jewish nation
[1:26:20] had witnessed a miracle reminding them
[1:26:24] of Gideon Gideon was totally outnumbered
[1:26:26] but he kept true to God he kept all the
[1:26:28] commands and then God come and destroyed
[1:26:30] the Midianites amen same thing happened
[1:26:32] here they're surrounded on three sides
[1:26:34] and God come and give him the victory
[1:26:36] give them favor
[1:26:37] he totally confused the enemy right
[1:26:39] remember get in he that's what happened
[1:26:41] to all they did with it they blew the
[1:26:43] horn remember that when you preached on
[1:26:44] that they blew the horns that was one of
[1:26:45] a men's first services one of the few
[1:26:47] they blew the horns and they smashed
[1:26:50] together some vessels and everything and
[1:26:52] everybody got confused they started
[1:26:53] killing each other they had me start to
[1:26:54] kill themselves God always confuses the
[1:26:57] enemy because God's not the author of
[1:26:58] confusion in his army amen
[1:27:00] his army knows exactly what they're
[1:27:02] doing we're doing the Word of God amen
[1:27:04] we're keeping the Word of God now like
[1:27:06] what this guy says it's beautiful notice
[1:27:08] how long the war was six days of seeing
[1:27:15] God and intervene on behalf of the
[1:27:17] Jewish
[1:27:18] and that was it really was I think so
[1:27:19] extraordinary is that you had this
[1:27:21] moment where Arab leaders in lammott
[1:27:25] leaders were saying we're going to throw
[1:27:26] Jews into the sea and it looks like a
[1:27:29] nether Holocaust of imminence and
[1:27:31] suddenly in six days the Jewish people
[1:27:35] defended themselves destroyed their
[1:27:37] enemies a triple girl and recaptured
[1:27:40] from their land this one for the first
[1:27:42] time in 2,000 years they rested they
[1:27:48] tripled their land they tripled their
[1:27:50] size in six days they triple their size
[1:27:54] to get all the holy places back they
[1:27:55] work for six days and they rest on the
[1:27:57] seven hey man my that was just in 1967
[1:28:01] see so I believe Michael was involved
[1:28:05] here somewhere because they're
[1:28:06] surrounded by all these countries saying
[1:28:13] all our parks are becomes a cemetery but
[1:28:15] somebody stood up for Israel amen
[1:28:17] somebody stood up for God's people
[1:28:19] praise God and it fits the perfect type
[1:28:22] rat worked for six rest on the seventh
[1:28:24] oh it's beautiful
[1:28:30] people in the immediate aftermath of the
[1:28:33] war everyone religious and secular alike
[1:28:35] recognized that this was from God
[1:28:37] Detroit that was just so implausible and
[1:28:39] here everybody was expecting a
[1:28:41] tremendous defeat yes there's a miracle
[1:28:44] even Moshe Dayan it was the commander of
[1:28:48] the Israeli forces and he was a very
[1:28:51] secular person he went to visit the
[1:28:53] Western Wall the day after it was
[1:28:55] liberated and the tradition to put you
[1:28:58] know like full of wolves to God in the
[1:29:00] law so he could elude them to God
[1:29:02] between the crevices of the law and of
[1:29:05] course as soon as he left to be a
[1:29:06] newspaper then in their typical the
[1:29:10] street was no doubt and read it look at
[1:29:13] this day and it was a line from Psalm
[1:29:15] that said this is from God it's wonders

[1:29:37] member had also said there they got back
[1:29:38] places that they hadn't had for 2,000
[1:29:40] years 2,000 years see when the enemy
[1:29:45] comes in like a flood God will raise up
[1:29:46] a standard against that
[1:29:48] praise God let's have the musicians come
[1:29:50] here I hope that's an encouragement
[1:29:51] that's Oh bless my heart when I seen
