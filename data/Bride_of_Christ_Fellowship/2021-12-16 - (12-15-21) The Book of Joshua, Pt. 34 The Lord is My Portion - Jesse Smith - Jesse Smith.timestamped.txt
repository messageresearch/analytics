[12:33] musicians let's take our bibles here
[12:35] we'll stand and we'll read our text for
[12:36] tonight and get into the sermon here
[12:38] tonight by god's grace
[12:41] let's go to joshua chapter 21 here
[12:48] joshua so that's the fifth book of the
[12:50] bible or sixth book of the bible rather
[12:53] genesis exodus leviticus numbers
[12:55] deuteronomy and joshua
[12:57] joshua chapter 21.
[13:03] we're just working our way right through
[13:05] this and uh really enjoying it praise
[13:07] god
[13:13] it's really taught us how to fight
[13:14] praise god joshua
[13:16] never lost a fight as long as he was
[13:18] obeying the word of the lord
[13:20] so we can see the same for our lives
[13:23] as we obey the word of the lord
[13:25] god does great things in our life he
[13:27] fights our battles for us
[13:29] he defeats all the enemies praise god
[13:32] joshua chapter 21
[13:41] now this is on
[13:43] uh this chapter is about the
[13:45] division of the land and the portion
[13:47] given to the levites
[13:51] okay so we know
[13:53] that they weren't given lands but they
[13:55] still needed some place to live right
[13:59] they weren't given lands or mountains or
[14:01] rivers or
[14:02] wells or anything like that but they had
[14:04] to live somewhere so this chapter deals
[14:07] with
[14:08] all the places they were given
[14:11] so let's read verse 1
[14:15] and two i'll read i'll read verses one
[14:17] and two and then we'll read another
[14:18] scripture here
[14:20] verse one says then came near the heads
[14:22] of the fathers of the levites unto
[14:23] eliazar the priest and unto joshua the
[14:26] son of nun and unto the heads of the
[14:27] fathers of the tribes of the children of
[14:28] israel and they spake unto them at
[14:31] shiloh in the land of canaan saying the
[14:33] lord commanded by the hand of moses to
[14:35] give us cities to dwell in
[14:37] with the suburbs thereof for our cattle
[14:40] now if you would go back two or three
[14:42] chapters earlier joshua 18 7. we'll read
[14:44] this one together joshua 18 verse 7.
[14:50] joshua 18 verse 7.
[14:55] we'd like to look at the lord is my
[14:57] portion tonight i'd like to look at this
[14:58] sub-topic here the lord is my portion
[15:02] joshua 18 verse 7.
[15:06] of course this is the chapter where they
[15:08] were going out and dividing the
[15:10] land to the last seven tribes

[15:14] read it on three one two three but the
[15:17] levites have no part among you for the
[15:20] priesthood of the lord is their
[15:22] inheritance and gad and reuben and half
[15:26] the tribe of manasseh have received
[15:29] their inheritance beyond jordan on the
[15:32] east which moses the servant of the lord
[15:35] gave them amen let's have a word of
[15:36] prayer and let's bow our heads and if
[15:38] you have a need on your heart just make
[15:39] a known unto god somehow maybe raise
[15:41] your hand or
[15:42] ask god to minister to your need you
[15:45] know many times it's through the
[15:46] preaching of the word that god will
[15:47] answer our questions or god will give us
[15:49] strength or god will give us courage
[15:51] through the word of god the bible says
[15:53] the word of god is nigh you it's close

[17:39] worship god for sending jesus christ in
[17:41] the flesh and we we'd love to do that by
[17:43] god's grace and
[17:45] the main thing is just spend more time
[17:46] praying you know reading your bible and
[17:48] worshiping jesus and fellowshipping with
[17:50] the saints that's the main thing
[17:52] and uh it's so great you know it's a
[17:54] great time of the year i love how god
[17:55] makes it like brother said god makes the
[17:57] whole world recognize that god sent his
[17:58] son
[18:00] they sing they sing about uh you hear it
[18:02] you know i think where we're at we're at
[18:03] some heathen store the other we're not a
[18:05] heathen store but we're at some worldly
[18:07] store the other day and they were
[18:08] playing a christmas
[18:09] what was it
[18:11] mustard seed okay a mustard seed and now
[18:14] they got nice food but they got the
[18:15] wrong kind of clientele there

[18:20] like i just heard the cry name of christ
[18:22] you know i think it was oh holy night or
[18:23] something like that like god makes the
[18:25] whole world recognize that jesus christ
[18:27] was sent to this world and thank god we
[18:29] know his spirit's with us today praise
[18:30] god so let's look at this here we'll try
[18:32] to look at
[18:33] urging israel to make their choice and
[18:36] then the recorded joshua's death
[18:39] okay so we're looking at chapter 21 now
[18:41] church here's the outline if you just
[18:42] like a little more uh look at detail
[18:44] look at this chapter you know the first
[18:46] eight verses
[18:47] uh talk about the cities for the tribe
[18:49] of levi there's 48 cities in all
[18:53] that the levites were given
[18:56] uh verses 9 through 19 are the cities
[18:58] given to aaron and his tribe
[19:01] uh or in his yeah his his family rather
[19:03] his family verses 20 through 26 where
[19:06] the city's given to cohath
[19:08] and uh 27 to 33 where the city's given
[19:11] to the sons of gershom
[19:13] and then verses 34 to 42 the city's
[19:16] given to uh murari
[19:18] and then the chapter ends by rehearsing
[19:20] god's faithfulness praise god and we
[19:23] want to you know look at that of course
[19:24] but now i put in blue on the next slide
[19:26] i put on the blue what each family was
[19:28] responsible
[19:30] so the co-athletes know aaron and his
[19:32] sons they were the ones that actually
[19:33] got to go into the presence of god
[19:36] nobody else could do that just aaron and
[19:38] his sons
[19:39] they could go past the outer court there
[19:41] was three courts right the outer court
[19:43] the holy place
[19:45] but they could go behind the curtain and
[19:47] they could go to where the ark of the
[19:49] covenant was and they would worship and
[19:51] they would talk to god off of the ark
[19:54] right what a privilege that would have
[19:55] been praise god to see that but thank
[19:58] god that brother you know the bible says
[20:00] that now god dwells in us now
[20:03] we don't have to go to a special
[20:04] building although we like to come here
[20:05] to worship god but we don't have to do
[20:07] that to hear the voice of god we can
[20:09] just pray and listen to god speak to us
[20:12] from the throne of our heart praise god
[20:14] because this is where god lives now god
[20:15] lives in the soul now praise god yes he
[20:18] meets us here and he sends his anointing
[20:20] in this room thank god for that
[20:22] but the real place god wants to speak to
[20:24] us today is from the throne of our
[20:26] hearts
[20:27] where we're just meditating on god can
[20:28] you imagine that
[20:30] can you imagine like aaron being shut
[20:32] shut into a room and there's no cell
[20:33] phone going off
[20:36] or no tv on
[20:38] or no there's no alerts going on there's
[20:40] no alerts you're just enjoying god's
[20:42] presence amen
[20:43] that's what we've got to get to today
[20:45] praise god that's why we've got to
[20:47] constantly struggle for praise god we
[20:49] got to struggle make time to spend with
[20:50] god and shut off the phone or put it on
[20:53] silence or do not to serve and make sure
[20:55] your time with god is undisturbed
[20:58] see that's what they long for everybody
[21:00] long for that to be like aaron
[21:03] everybody longed to go in the presence
[21:04] of god but it was it was a calling of
[21:06] god you had to be called to do it
[21:08] but see today everybody's called to have
[21:10] god's presence amen i don't know that's
[21:13] why jesus runs the veil right or the
[21:15] spirit run the veil when he was
[21:16] crucified it was showing everybody could
[21:19] come in the prince of god amen god wants
[21:21] to fellowship with all of us amen
[21:23] it's not just for one family it's not
[21:25] just for you know brother branham's
[21:26] family or brother jesse's family or or
[21:28] your family or am i it's for every
[21:30] family praise god god wants to
[21:32] fellowship and god is strong enough god
[21:34] is powerful enough to fellowship with
[21:36] all of us at the altar of our heart
[21:40] amen
[21:42] so aaron they got to go into the holiest
[21:44] once a year they could do that
[21:46] and god would we read the scripture
[21:48] remember on sunday and god would forgive
[21:50] all their sins away through those two
[21:51] goats remember that we looked at the
[21:52] remember that scripture one goat had to
[21:54] die they took his blood and they they
[21:56] sprinkled the whole thing and then the
[21:58] other goat
[21:59] they confessed all their sins can you
[22:01] imagine lord all jesse's sins for 2021
[22:04] put it on this goat
[22:06] all of my family sins all the church of
[22:08] sins put it on this goat and then lead
[22:10] them away
[22:11] and that was a physical representation
[22:14] of what god did in the spiritual realm
[22:16] god spiritually sent all their sins away
[22:19] but god gave them a physical image to
[22:22] show them the truth of that god let them
[22:24] see what he was doing spiritually amen
[22:27] praise god and that's what baptism is
[22:28] when you're baptized it's a symbol
[22:30] outward of what's happened someone's
[22:32] died to sin and now they're alive to
[22:34] jesus christ
[22:36] it's an outward symbol that god has sent
[22:38] your sins away your your old self is
[22:41] dead the old jesse's dead the old
[22:43] austin's dead praise god that old man an
[22:45] old woman is dead and now i'm alive in
[22:47] christ jesus
[22:49] i'm alive i'm a new person amen i'm a
[22:51] new being i have a new life i'm a new
[22:53] creature amen
[22:55] that's real christianity praise god
[22:57] now kohath
[23:00] they had the nearest location to the ark
[23:02] for their ministry and that when i read
[23:04] their context it didn't tell me what
[23:06] their ministry was
[23:08] in other words they were the ones that
[23:09] lived closest to shiloh because that's
[23:11] where the ark was
[23:14] next the gershomites
[23:16] they were responsible for the
[23:18] tabernacles coverings and other textiles
[23:22] right you had all the curtains you have
[23:23] the curtains of goat skins you had all
[23:25] the skins and then there's all kinds of
[23:27] curtains blue curtains purple curtains
[23:29] scarlet curtains all kinds of beautiful
[23:31] curtains they their whole job their
[23:33] whole life was making curtains that's
[23:36] all they could do like just like my
[23:37] whole life is teaching all the time
[23:39] that's all that's all my life is i don't
[23:41] get to go do construction i don't get to
[23:42] go do anything else i just got to teach
[23:44] all the time i talk all the time somehow
[23:46] sometimes nature i don't know how my
[23:48] vocal cords make it it must be god's
[23:50] prayers and god's miracles
[23:52] it's all just teaching all the time
[23:53] talking all the time and i get tired of
[23:55] it sometimes like you ask a kid

[23:57] a word because i'm just tired of talking
[24:00] but you know you're you're just you're
[24:02] called to do what you're called to do
[24:03] and you're supposed to be content

[24:08] sister god has a purpose for you he's
[24:10] called you to do that and so you stay
[24:12] with it you stay with it because god
[24:14] told you to do it amen
[24:17] you don't doubt what god has called you
[24:18] to do whatever god calls you do you do
[24:20] it and you don't stop till he changes it
[24:23] amen
[24:23] hallelujah and you don't complain about
[24:25] it
[24:27] you pray about it amen
[24:29] don't complain pray about it praise god
[24:32] ask god if you want you know if
[24:34] something needs change in your life you
[24:35] know go to god in prayer
[24:38] but as these men learn you've got to
[24:40] stay in your position and god in other
[24:42] words god has a special calling for
[24:45] every person
[24:46] amen
[24:47] and their job was take care of the
[24:49] coverings
[24:50] make sure we got enough goat skins you
[24:52] know or ram skins or badger skins make
[24:55] sure we got all these skins and they're
[24:56] constantly getting skins all the time
[24:58] their whole life was wound up in skins
[25:01] amen so don't feel bad mothers if your
[25:03] whole life is wound up in racing your
[25:04] children
[25:06] don't feel bad that's a glorious thing
[25:08] to do praise god
[25:09] you are handling god's heritage amen
[25:13] god's possession amen
[25:15] you're raising god's heritage and you're
[25:17] building the house of the lord amen
[25:20] glory
[25:22] like rachel and leah did amen you're
[25:24] building something greater than what you
[25:26] even know or understand
[25:28] it's so great
[25:30] and dads you're putting food on the
[25:31] table and and leading your family and
[25:33] family prayer night and everything like
[25:35] that teaching your children the word of
[25:36] god
[25:37] you're building their character the same
[25:39] praise god so stay with it don't abandon
[25:41] your family praise god that's what my
[25:43] dad did he abandoned us but i'll never
[25:45] abandon my family by god's grace and i
[25:47] don't think bad of him i love him i
[25:48] forgive him but the devil tempts us to
[25:50] do those things and we got to overcome
[25:52] that praise god amen
[25:54] you got to stay where god's called you
[25:56] and if god's called you to something
[25:58] he's going to provide for you praise god
[26:01] amen
[26:02] just like god provided the skins for
[26:03] them
[26:04] he's had to go find some badgers amen
[26:06] got to go hunting or whatever they got
[26:08] to do got to provide if god's called you
[26:11] to do it he's going to provide for you
[26:13] he'll make a way where there seems to be
[26:15] no way
[26:16] amen
[26:20] hallelujah so gershom said
[26:23] it was constantly lord give us the
[26:24] coverings and god provided the coverings
[26:27] god had a special place for them to live
[26:31] the sons of murari
[26:34] their job was to guard the tabernacle
[26:36] and transport the frames they're like
[26:38] security service any security guards out
[26:40] there
[26:41] i don't maybe
[26:43] security guards and also transporting uh
[26:46] the the frames
[26:49] praise god the metal frames the brass or
[26:51] or whatever they had as far as the
[26:52] metals for frames their job was to carry
[26:54] it sounded like it sounds like iron
[26:56] workers like my brother sam he got an
[26:57] iron worker job in the trades but austin
[26:59] and he'd carry like he said like 20 of
[27:01] those rods at a time and he said he come
[27:03] home and you know i remember coming home
[27:04] he'd be sweating it'd be a summertime
[27:06] 100 degrees and he's just like his
[27:08] shirt's ripped and it's soaking wet from
[27:10] carrying rods all day
[27:12] that was his lot he liked it you know he
[27:14] worked hard he moved up now he's a
[27:16] supervisor praise god and god's blessed
[27:18] him so much
[27:19] but you know god has a different calling
[27:21] for us he couldn't imagine being in a
[27:23] classroom like me coloring with crayons
[27:27] and i couldn't imagine carrying those
[27:28] rods like him
[27:30] you know we just you know we just got
[27:31] our different callings in life
[27:34] and god wants us to respond to our
[27:36] calling and be faithful in our calling
[27:40] so what you see the trouble is when
[27:42] people wander from place to place
[27:45] that's what cain was cain was a wanderer
[27:47] he couldn't find a home in a certain
[27:49] place
[27:50] see we can't wander from church to
[27:52] church or from job to job we should find
[27:54] a place where god wants us and say god i
[27:56] know you called me there you're gonna
[27:57] bless me there i'm gonna be faithful
[27:59] there
[28:00] amen
[28:04] they could have argued they could argue
[28:05] saying hey sons of aaron can we trade
[28:07] you and you guys do the you guys do uh
[28:10] the frames and we'll take the holy
[28:11] spirit's for a while can we trade no
[28:14] no
[28:14] no and neither can someone like neither
[28:17] can our parents can our parents say well
[28:19] i don't want a parent anymore i like to
[28:20] go travel the world and just have some
[28:21] fun you know i'm tired of changing
[28:23] diapers can the parents say that of
[28:25] course not they would never leave god's
[28:27] heritage right they would never leave
[28:28] the souls god gave them that's
[28:30] ridiculous right it's silly
[28:32] it's evil it'd be wicked if they did
[28:34] that
[28:35] but see we must also find contentment in
[28:37] what god has called us to do we must be
[28:40] patient that god is working something
[28:42] inside of our lives we may not see it
[28:44] but god is bringing us to something
[28:46] greater in our lives amen
[28:48] like i told brothers on the way to
[28:49] church i remember last year god gave us
[28:51] that word from the lord from brother ray
[28:53] that there's a reason we're a small
[28:54] church it's to protect us
[28:56] well he could have told me that on year
[28:58] one brother before when we started the
[29:00] church
[29:01] and then i would have known
[29:03] but god don't do what i want to do god
[29:04] does what he wants to do
[29:07] god wouldn't see thou be faithful for 15
[29:09] or 14 years and then he's going to let
[29:11] me know to protect you
[29:13] so your children don't get mistreated
[29:15] so you can write books and make videos
[29:17] and teach the world right now it's a
[29:19] small people around the world because
[29:21] brother brahms said i just read it this
[29:22] week brother baby said in the days of
[29:24] jesus hundred of one percent actually
[29:26] got to hear him
[29:28] then he said one percent of that
[29:30] actually believed him amen
[29:31] he said that's how it is at the end time
[29:34] right 100 to one percent actually hears
[29:36] about jesus right or wants to hear about
[29:38] jesus and then only one percent of
[29:40] little percentage of that actually will
[29:41] believe it and live it and obey it
[29:43] praise god and thank god you're one of
[29:45] them amen
[29:47] hallelujah
[29:49] because the other the other people that
[29:50] don't even want it
[29:51] they'd rather have money and drugs and
[29:53] sex and rock and roll and they'd rather
[29:55] have that and so they don't even want it
[29:56] so god can't even god tries to deal with
[29:58] them but they turn god down but look at
[30:00] you you're hearing the word of god
[30:02] you're living the word of god you're
[30:04] content where god has called you
[30:06] amen that's something the world has
[30:08] nothing they don't know nothing about
[30:10] that praise god
[30:11] but we know about it because of god's
[30:13] grace
[30:14] hallelujah
[30:18] now i mentioned this on sunday and we
[30:20] know we didn't read it but
[30:21] i want to read it tonight
[30:23] it's in your bible uh you don't have to
[30:24] turn there but as we don't have an hour
[30:26] to preach anyway so
[30:29] paul says god is not worshiped with
[30:30] man's hands
[30:32] as though he needs anything
[30:34] or like god really needs me to build a
[30:36] church or god really needs me to build a
[30:38] house you know god really don't need you
[30:40] to do that
[30:41] he may lead you to do that but that's
[30:43] not why your hands are there
[30:45] it's not like he needs you right
[30:47] the bible says that he says seeing he
[30:49] gives to all life
[30:51] right and breath and all things
[30:55] see so it's not we must not think much
[30:58] more of ourselves right we should not be
[30:59] prideful what we can do
[31:02] because god's the one who gave us the
[31:03] ability to do that god's the one who's
[31:05] extended our lives god's one that's
[31:06] protected our lives he's given us our
[31:08] health our strength it's all from god
[31:10] amen
[31:11] nothing to brag about
[31:15] he's made one blood of all nations men
[31:18] for to dwell in the face all the face of
[31:20] the earth
[31:21] and hath determined the times before
[31:23] appointed and the bounds of their
[31:25] habitation i'll mention this a little
[31:28] bit on sunday that they should seek the
[31:29] lord
[31:31] if haply they might feel after him
[31:34] and find him though he be not far from
[31:37] every one of us
[31:39] so let's just again just go through
[31:41] these a little slower here
[31:43] god determined your time before he
[31:46] appointed the time of your life
[31:49] so don't ever feel well i'm younger than
[31:51] everybody
[31:52] it's bad for me don't feel that way
[31:54] you're younger for a purpose
[31:56] or i'm older than everybody oh i don't
[31:58] like being older no no be happy god did
[32:00] it for a purpose amen
[32:02] god determined your time
[32:05] the bible said the hairs of your head
[32:06] are numbered and the bible said the
[32:08] years are numbered as well your days are
[32:10] numbered amen
[32:13] god knows the number of your days like i
[32:15] did that funeral last last last month
[32:18] the man was given 56 years that was all
[32:20] he's given
[32:21] that's how many years brother branham
[32:22] was given 56 years
[32:24] right
[32:26] we don't know how many years we've been
[32:28] given but we should invest those years
[32:30] like we like we don't know how many and
[32:32] we want to make sure every year counts
[32:34] for jesus
[32:36] amen
[32:38] god knows the time god knows the season
[32:39] amen
[32:41] god determines those things
[32:44] he determined your time and he
[32:46] determined where you live
[32:50] amen
[32:51] hallelujah
[32:53] all right football brought me here but
[32:54] it was not all about football football
[32:56] got discouraging real fast
[32:59] all right all my hopes and my injuries
[33:01] and everything that i ended up
[33:02] everything real fast
[33:04] uh
[33:05] but see god brought me here to preach
[33:07] the gospel amen
[33:09] god brought me here to try to rescue
[33:11] souls from hell praise god
[33:14] to try to set the captive free amen
[33:17] now just let me share this testimony
[33:19] real quick remember i preached on the
[33:20] minister's marriage requirements a few
[33:22] wednesdays ago well i got an email
[33:24] yesterday and i'm not gonna say the
[33:26] brother's name he's a preacher in the
[33:27] message he said i just want to tell you
[33:28] now my wife can probably quote it better
[33:30] than i cause i can't even see the
[33:31] picture right now in my mind
[33:32] but he said i've struggled with this for
[33:34] years i've never told a soul about it in
[33:36] the world he said and then i watched
[33:38] your video and what do you say hon
[33:42] a cloud lifted off of him amen and he
[33:45] said something like he had no more
[33:46] bondage
[33:47] didn't use the word bondage
[33:49] bondage
[33:52] so church you know we're just we're just
[33:53] preaching away we're just putting god's
[33:55] word out there and god's word cannot
[33:58] return void amen amen this man is in
[34:01] other words he's been enslaved with the
[34:03] complex for decades oh but the holy
[34:06] spirit knew he sent that word out it
[34:08] might have wandered around there on the
[34:09] internet for a while and all of a sudden
[34:11] it came up on his phone i think i'll tap
[34:13] that and as he watched it tears flow and
[34:15] the devil lifts and now he's free in
[34:18] christ amen
[34:20] and we get to experience that right in
[34:21] person amen
[34:23] but sometimes god's only way to do it is
[34:25] to send it through a video on youtube
[34:29] or vimeo or whatever it is
[34:31] sometimes that's only god's way
[34:33] sometimes it's a written piece of paper
[34:35] a track that gets you
[34:36] knowledge about jesus christ
[34:38] and that says oh i got to be baptized
[34:40] the right way praise the lord amen
[34:42] sometimes it's a preacher spitting all
[34:43] over the place not on purpose
[34:45] but sometimes it's a video on youtube
[34:47] sometimes we don't know but god has a
[34:49] way to direct his word god determined
[34:52] your lifespan where you'd be and he
[34:55] brought the word right to your lap amen
[34:58] so you do what accept it
[35:00] rejoice in it love it thank god for it
[35:03] and be free and serve god with all your
[35:06] heart soul mind and strength
[35:09] amen
[35:11] and then the next day for the same video
[35:14] i get somebody telling me i'm going to
[35:15] hell and i'm serpentied
[35:17] i just said may god forgive you
[35:21] one day somebody gets set free by it the
[35:23] next day i'm called a devil
[35:25] well that's nothing new
[35:27] people been calling me devil for a long
[35:28] time but i know i love jesus amen
[35:31] i know my life is a life that's not a
[35:34] corrupt tree it's a incorruptible tree
[35:37] i see you you all see the works of my
[35:39] life praise god
[35:40] church your life speaks so loud i can't
[35:42] even hear what you're testifying about
[35:45] and the church said
[35:47] our life what we do is more than what we
[35:50] say
[35:50] how we treat others is more than what we
[35:52] say
[35:53] our life speaks louder than anything and
[35:55] thank god that the life of christ speaks
[35:58] it thunders out through our lives amen
[36:01] the voice of christ thunders out through
[36:03] our lives people feel the love people
[36:05] see the genuine sincerity people see the
[36:07] real christian character it thunders
[36:10] god's voice speaks through our lives
[36:12] actions always speak louder than words
[36:15] like i told austin that testimony we
[36:17] were getting lydia that that debit card
[36:19] remember that lydia
[36:20] and we're like it was like an hour-long
[36:21] meeting i'm like does it take an hour to
[36:23] get a debit card can somebody help me
[36:24] out around here you know they got to
[36:26] sign all these papers you know
[36:27] sign your life away whatever you know
[36:29] they say
[36:31] thank god it hasn't been signed away
[36:32] though uh but anyways in the middle of
[36:34] it she just stops and she said oh you're
[36:36] that preacher remember that lydia she
[36:38] said you're that preacher
[36:40] on a sunday i couldn't it was too cold
[36:42] and i was pumping up the air in my tire
[36:45] and i i couldn't uh i couldn't get the
[36:47] air in and she said you drove up in your
[36:49] big van she's like do you have a big van
[36:50] i'm like yeah i got a pretty big van
[36:53] people call it a tank

[36:56] he said you got out and you had a suit
[36:58] on she's like she said do you wear suits
[36:59] on sunday like pretty much every sunday
[37:03] and she said yeah i had to be you i'm
[37:04] like i don't think it was me
[37:06] she's like no it had to be you and she
[37:08] said you got down there and blew up my
[37:09] tire she said and i couldn't do it and
[37:12] it's all filled up and i just want to
[37:13] thank you for doing that
[37:14] i thought well i don't even know if that
[37:16] was me but even if it wasn't me look how
[37:19] god
[37:20] meets people's needs right where they
[37:22] need it praise god something as simple
[37:24] as it's cold and i can't put air in my
[37:25] tire i'm going to be uh i'm going to be
[37:27] in danger grounds you know if i don't
[37:29] have air in my tire and god will send
[37:31] somebody around to help you at just the
[37:33] right time at just the right moment with
[37:35] just the right enough strength because
[37:37] he cares so much about you he loves you
[37:39] so much and if god remember if that
[37:41] woman remember that how much more does
[37:43] god remember that amen
[37:45] praise god
[37:47] you know you're you have a certain
[37:48] habitation you have a certain boundaries
[37:51] where god wants you to live and never
[37:52] think a little of it because that's what
[37:53] they had in the days of joshua
[37:56] god gave them a boundary god gave them a
[37:58] place to live and their desire their
[38:01] their their their requirement was just
[38:03] to thank god for it and not learn the
[38:05] ways of the heathen praise god amen

[38:11] the ways of the heathen take no idols
[38:14] into your home don't worship idols
[38:16] worship christ only
[38:18] that was all the requirement just put
[38:20] god first
[38:23] hallelujah
[38:25] and if they did that
[38:28] so god gave you a time to seek him he
[38:30] gave you a place to seek him and if you
[38:32] would do that the bible says you will
[38:35] touch and feel god's power amen how many
[38:38] touched god's power before praise god
[38:41] he'll give you a blessing austin was
[38:42] telling me about naomi when you spoke in
[38:43] tongues that last time he was there he
[38:45] said he always remembers that see what
[38:47] the impact that and i told him the
[38:48] testimony behind that
[38:50] see every prayer god hears amen he may
[38:54] not answer it when you want but he's
[38:55] going to answer it praise god
[38:57] especially the ones that are heart cries

[39:20] you see but you're going to be long oh
[39:22] god i need you and pretty soon god's
[39:24] going to answer your requests and you're
[39:27] going to know i've touched the heart of
[39:28] god amen
[39:30] i know god's real i know he called me
[39:32] right here i know he's with me amen
[39:35] that's what the bible says
[39:37] god determined your time your place so
[39:39] you would reach out and touch god
[39:43] because he's not
[39:45] far from every one of us remember that
[39:47] on sunday church remember that on sunday
[39:48] that picture oh i love that picture
[39:50] look where god placed the uh
[39:53] you see remember that where god look
[39:54] where god placed those cities of refuge
[39:57] totally spread out

[40:04] you might not have run the st you not
[40:06] you might not have won the state
[40:07] championship like some people
[40:09] it's just god's grace that i want it
[40:11] but i'm just saying there's no excuse
[40:14] these are close to everybody god is not
[40:17] far from any of us the only requirement
[40:19] is run until you're safe in christ
[40:22] amen the only requirement is run
[40:25] he's not far from you he's near to you
[40:28] reach out after him try to touch him in
[40:30] prayer amen try to touch him in your
[40:33] prayer closet as you pray and read your
[40:35] bible come up for prayer until god
[40:37] answers do something try to reach out
[40:39] and touch the lord as he passes by amen
[40:42] you'll find he's not too busy
[40:44] to hear your hearts cry
[40:47] he's not far from any of us
[40:49] the devil makes us think it
[40:51] because we're not spending enough time
[40:52] in the word
[40:54] right or we're discouraged or we're sick
[40:56] or something like that he makes us think
[40:57] that but that's not the case
[41:00] the bible said he is not far from any of
[41:03] us
[41:04] usually church he's just a one one
[41:06] breath away
[41:07] right you're in a you're you're gonna
[41:09] get a car accident you say jesus and he
[41:11] helps you out
[41:12] he's just one breath away amen he's got
[41:14] playing time he can slow down things he
[41:16] can slow down time he can send his
[41:17] angels down there he can just change the
[41:19] whole situation
[41:21] right
[41:22] i saw some youtube videos about that it
[41:24] looked like kids were gonna get run over
[41:25] and i think it was on facebook a couple
[41:27] years ago and the kid just does a flip
[41:29] and the truck misses him
[41:31] and they said this is proof of angels
[41:33] i'm like that's exactly right what it
[41:34] was
[41:36] that's a
[41:37] the kid probably couldn't even cry out
[41:38] to god he probably didn't have time to
[41:39] think about it i mean just all these
[41:41] amazing testimonies that you see god
[41:43] wants to be called upon amen god wants
[41:45] you to reach out and try to touch him
[41:47] and try to feel him god i want to touch
[41:49] your heart tonight i really need an
[41:51] answer to my request god would you hear
[41:52] me but you got to call out the bible
[41:54] said you got to feel after him amen
[41:58] can't just sit there and say god do
[41:59] something you got to feel you got to
[42:01] show god that you mean business and you
[42:03] believe in him and you know he's there
[42:05] praise god amen you've got to show that
[42:07] you believe his word
[42:09] amen
[42:11] he's not far from any of us he
[42:13] determined you and i to be in akron to
[42:15] serve its purpose
[42:18] think about all the cities you could
[42:19] have been in
[42:20] and god called you to akron
[42:22] right
[42:23] austin stomping grounds we call it by
[42:24] god's grace his stomping grounds where
[42:26] he was born and raised here at akron
[42:29] and they told me you want to play
[42:30] football in akron i'm like i don't know
[42:31] where akron is
[42:33] you know i didn't even what is akron i
[42:35] don't even know what it is and i found
[42:36] out there's two of them there's one in
[42:37] pennsylvania too there's probably more
[42:39] than that actually
[42:40] but you know god has a purpose god has a
[42:43] season a reason to do something and
[42:46] we've got to trust the hand of the lord
[42:48] and be content in what god's doing
[42:50] now here's the scripture i read levites
[42:53] had no portion among you for the priest
[42:55] of the lord
[42:56] is their inheritance
[42:59] right
[43:01] so all the other
[43:02] all the other peoples all the other
[43:04] tribes got to have lands and build
[43:07] houses now can i just modernize it
[43:09] swimming pools
[43:12] nice cars
[43:14] they got you know nice furniture the
[43:16] nicest clothes
[43:19] but the levites
[43:20] all they got was a little place to live
[43:23] they had a little bit of of of of land
[43:25] for the cattle the bible said and that's
[43:27] it
[43:28] they didn't get acres upon acres upon
[43:31] acres
[43:33] you know in other words they didn't they
[43:34] didn't become you know
[43:35] multi-millionaires overnight with all
[43:37] this land and all this all these
[43:39] possessions
[43:40] they were just given the very basics of
[43:43] life amen and they were given access to
[43:45] god amen
[43:47] thank god amen
[43:49] lord give me the basics of life and but
[43:51] along with that give me your blessing
[43:53] give me a ministry in the presence of
[43:55] god amen
[43:56] and i'll be happy praise god amen
[44:00] don't
[44:01] don't give me houses or lands or just
[44:03] give me what i need and give me a
[44:06] relationship with you that everybody
[44:08] else wants to have amen
[44:11] can i say like that
[44:13] or everybody envies brother man said the
[44:15] israel envied um aaron every time he got
[44:18] to walk in there and the presence of god
[44:19] and remember when cam preached they'd
[44:20] hear the pomegranates going back and
[44:22] forth saying holy
[44:24] holy holy unto the lord he had a certain
[44:27] walk about him praise god he had a
[44:28] certain testimony he had to have a
[44:30] certain
[44:31] routine that he followed in order for
[44:33] the prince of god to be pleased praise
[44:36] god that's what we do we live in such a
[44:38] way where it pleases god and we get to
[44:40] go in god's presence and we get to enjoy
[44:43] god's spirit here in our homes and it's
[44:45] nothing that we should take for granted
[44:47] we should be thankful and we should live
[44:49] holy so it happens more
[44:52] amen
[44:54] hallelujah
[44:56] so that's your inheritance
[44:58] got the very basics of life
[45:01] but you get to be a priest unto god amen
[45:04] and unto christ
[45:06] oh what a blessing church they had
[45:08] brother adam says
[45:10] when god was setting an order he said
[45:11] all you levites
[45:13] i've called you out and made you priests
[45:14] and all your brethren and other 12
[45:16] tribes and the other 11 tribes will pay
[45:19] you a tithing
[45:22] said moses
[45:24] moses for your part i'm yours
[45:27] and he also said the same to aaron right
[45:29] oh my he said i'm your satisfying
[45:32] portion
[45:34] and that's what the holy ghost
[45:37] is to the church today
[45:40] in other words we should be satisfied we
[45:42] should we should be more than satisfied
[45:44] with god's presence amen being baptized
[45:47] with the holy ghost is more than enough
[45:49] satisfaction satisfaction than all the
[45:51] money riches and houses and lands and
[45:53] relationships and it's more than enough
[45:56] it's plenty satisfying to be a holy
[45:57] ghost christian amen in 2021 praise god
[46:02] amen
[46:04] what have they got that i don't got
[46:07] natural things but what do i got that
[46:10] they don't got
[46:11] i got a lot i got jesus amen
[46:15] i got a conscience where i know if i
[46:17] meet him he'll say well done praise god
[46:20] amen
[46:21] hallelujah i've been sold out to china
[46:23] right i've been sold out to the
[46:25] government i've been sold out to the irs
[46:27] i've been sold out to
[46:28] to worldly things we've been true to
[46:30] christ we've been faithful to christ
[46:32] we've made him our number one we've made
[46:35] him our portion amen we've made him our
[46:37] all in all and so we know when we see
[46:40] him he will be pleased he'll receive us
[46:42] amen
[46:45] and there's no question
[46:47] what will happen when we come in the
[46:49] presence of god but there is a lot of
[46:51] questions when compromisers come in the
[46:54] prince of god that's where the
[46:56] question's at
[46:58] the bible calls them workers of iniquity
[47:00] is that right
[47:03] and the way to know is their works
[47:06] because they're either workers of
[47:08] righteousness or workers of iniquity
[47:11] so all you have to do is watch a man's
[47:13] words and watch his works
[47:16] hallelujah
[47:18] that's why i told brother austin a real
[47:19] christian he'll work but man said the
[47:21] real christian will work a real sister
[47:23] will work for the kingdom of god work
[47:24] for their family work work
[47:27] because they know they're not doing it
[47:28] for themselves they're doing it for god
[47:32] i tell you we started up that bible club
[47:34] again we finally got to start the bible
[47:35] club so this will be our friday will be
[47:37] our our third meeting and i'm there at 8
[47:39] am in the morning we're dancing and
[47:40] we're praising god and worshiping god
[47:42] right there in the school i said jesus
[47:45] we're back amen
[47:46] we're back amen preaching to just 30
[47:49] kids but we're still there still hearing
[47:50] the gospel they're still hearing that
[47:52] god is a miracle working god amen you
[47:55] know i tell all your testimonies to them
[47:56] did you know that
[47:58] naomi i tell your beatrice i tell you
[48:00] children i tell all your testimonies of
[48:02] them praise god i'm preaching your
[48:04] testimony to them amen god healed bang's
[48:06] dad i told that i'm going to tell that
[48:08] testimony that's right because it
[48:09] happened while we had a break
[48:13] that's what they did they would sell
[48:14] their gold and silver and pass it out to
[48:15] everybody that's what they do in the
[48:17] book of acts church
[48:19] he said silver gold have i none but i
[48:21] have a satisfying portion
[48:23] hallelujah education i can't hardly read
[48:25] this book but i got a satisfying portion
[48:28] amen
[48:29] don't judge yourself if you don't have a
[48:31] college degree don't judge yourself god
[48:32] don't need you to have a college degree
[48:34] that's right god needs you to have a
[48:35] heart that loves him and wants to serve
[48:37] him
[48:38] that wants to be faithful praise god now
[48:39] if you're going to earn one like our
[48:40] sister earn one do the best you can
[48:43] like i did i have a i have a master's
[48:44] degree plus like 40 to 40 credits after
[48:46] a master's degree they told me you
[48:48] should go for a doctorate i'm like i'm
[48:49] not going for a doctorate
[48:51] that's the last thing i need is more
[48:53] school
[48:54] i'm tired of school i'm 41. i don't need
[48:56] more school
[48:57] i've been going to school more than half
[48:58] of my life i don't want no more school
[49:00] what am i going to be a doctor in any
[49:02] way you know i was just ridiculous
[49:04] uh
[49:05] he said doctor's degree don't have any
[49:07] phds llds nothing else but there's one
[49:11] thing that i have
[49:13] church there's one thing that you need
[49:15] there's one thing that i need one thing
[49:17] we should have the presence of god as
[49:19] our portion amen
[49:22] hallelujah let everybody have everything
[49:24] else you just have god's approval god's
[49:26] love and obedience to god that should
[49:29] satisfy you
[49:32] if not you've got your eyes off the most
[49:33] important things in life
[49:36] cause pretty soon guess what if the lord
[49:37] tarries we're all gonna have to go to
[49:38] the funeral service and we're the ones
[49:40] that are gonna be there
[49:41] in the gasket
[49:43] then what are you going to say about
[49:44] your life what what did you do with your
[49:45] life
[49:47] i made christ my portion
[49:50] like i told the family i said if i ever
[49:51] go to the grave you make sure you read
[49:53] isaiah 53 at my funeral
[49:56] because he was wounded church for my
[49:57] transgressions praise god he was bruised
[50:00] for my iniquities the chastisement of my
[50:03] peace was upon him but with his stripes
[50:05] i was healed amen
[50:08] glory
[50:09] and because he healed me i live for him
[50:11] now and he saved me and i live with him
[50:14] eternally praise god
[50:16] because he healed my soul praise god
[50:21] he said that's the part i want
[50:24] that's the part god wants you to have
[50:27] [Applause]
[50:29] throw the rest of the old things away
[50:34] all the prestige
[50:35] and everything else
[50:37] and walk out
[50:39] and get god's satisfying portion
[50:42] isn't that what moses did yeah moses and
[50:45] of course he was a murderer but before
[50:47] that he basically already decided i
[50:49] don't i don't need to take the throne of
[50:51] egypt i'm going to take the way i'm
[50:53] going to stand up for god's people
[50:56] think about that turning down all those
[50:57] women all that money all that power the
[50:59] military the authority that he would
[51:01] have had
[51:02] he first the bible said he forsook that
[51:05] the pleasures of egypt to walk with
[51:07] god's anointed ones amen
[51:10] oh thank god amen any little thing you
[51:13] give up anyway god's gonna give you a
[51:14] hundred fold more praise god
[51:18] amen your perspective just has to change
[51:22] right
[51:24] change how you're seeing it see how god
[51:27] sees it amen
[51:30] like i said the most precious things in
[51:32] life are not things you can buy
[51:35] like brother man said where can i go buy
[51:36] a bottle of love i need some love
[51:39] where can i go buy a bottle of patience
[51:42] because i really like to get some
[51:44] right
[51:46] go give me some long suffering for these
[51:47] people that call me serpent seed i could
[51:49] really use some long suffering
[51:51] you can't get it anywhere all you can
[51:54] get it is in prayer amen
[51:56] all you can get is in
[51:58] in the presence of god in surrendering
[52:00] to god because when you surrender fully
[52:02] he comes in fully praise god amen
[52:06] the most valuable things in life are the
[52:07] things you cannot buy even the things
[52:09] you cannot see praise god
[52:12] it's the invisible things the eternal
[52:14] things of god god's character being
[52:17] molded into your life
[52:19] that's the most valuable things in life
[52:23] amen
[52:25] because what you've got of this earth
[52:28] you'll leave here
[52:30] when you leave
[52:33] right i saw that guy at that funeral
[52:36] he had all his uh he was a big football
[52:38] fan he had notre dame football on
[52:40] laying there in the casket everything
[52:42] was notre dame football i thought oh my
[52:44] that was his portion that's what he
[52:46] loved
[52:47] i don't know i asked god to be merciful
[52:49] to his soul god will be i know that
[52:50] god's faithful
[52:52] all those pictures it's all sports it's
[52:54] all notre dame that was his portion in
[52:55] life
[52:57] church you know what a valuable thing it
[52:59] is when people can write your obituary
[53:01] and say they went and saw their lord and
[53:03] savior jesus christ and i mean really
[53:05] mean it
[53:06] i mean mean it
[53:08] like they loved god they served god they
[53:11] were devoted to god they prayed to god
[53:13] they knew god amen remember brother f
[53:15] said he went to that that uh that house
[53:18] there in uh uh atlanta georgia i think
[53:20] it was no uh tennessee i can't remember
[53:22] of the the the black woman whoever her
[53:25] son was dying of the of the the std
[53:29] and he said he said you pray i want to
[53:30] hear you pray and he said when she
[53:32] prayed he said it was the most powerful
[53:34] prayer he'd heard amen he said you could
[53:36] tell she'd prayed to god before amen
[53:40] she said i felt more welcome in that old
[53:42] broken down home than all these mega
[53:44] churches and all these you know what i'm
[53:45] talking about all these million dollar
[53:47] buildings because that's a home that
[53:49] knew the love of god she needed god she
[53:51] believed in god and god was there amen
[53:54] and he proved it by healing the boy of
[53:55] his std amen
[53:57] oh
[53:59] thank god amen
[54:01] as i was telling brother austin where's
[54:02] our greatest meetings we've ever had
[54:04] been they're usually just humble little
[54:06] meetings
[54:07] the greatest miracles i've seen are with
[54:09] the poor people
[54:11] guyana trinidad mostly guyana trinidad's
[54:13] got more they got a better economy
[54:16] but the greatest miracles i've ever seen
[54:17] is with those guyanese that they only
[54:19] have electricity they got a generator
[54:21] and that makes the electricity
[54:25] sometimes they don't even have running
[54:26] water saints
[54:28] and where do i see the power of god
[54:30] right there right there
[54:32] not that we've had awesome testimonies
[54:33] here too but on the on the on the number
[54:36] and the multitude and how fast they they
[54:38] multiply
[54:40] that's where i've seen the power of god
[54:42] where the people are humble
[54:44] right now we need to be more humble
[54:46] praise god amen and god's going to help
[54:48] us do it you know god's got a way to
[54:49] brother man said if he said if you're a
[54:51] stone he's got a way to smooth out the
[54:53] stones
[54:54] you got to rub those stones together
[54:57] sometimes i'm going to rub you the wrong
[54:58] way
[54:59] sometimes you're going to rub me the
[55:00] wrong way
[55:01] but it's god smoothing out the stones
[55:04] to try to get them nice and smooth
[55:08] don't leave now don't leave just because
[55:09] we rubbed each other a little bit
[55:11] every so every ch you're going to rub
[55:13] somebody somewhere everywhere
[55:15] just know that it's making you more like
[55:17] jesus
[55:18] amen didn't all the disciples didn't
[55:21] jesus rub all the disciples
[55:23] they say why you boys arguing about
[55:24] who's greater let me show you who's
[55:26] great
[55:27] little jimmy come over here sit on my
[55:28] knee he said you got to become like a
[55:30] child
[55:32] to enter the kingdom of heaven that's my
[55:34] jesus amen amen
[55:36] he rebuked them
[55:38] for arguing who's greater
[55:40] and the greatest among you
[55:42] is the servants
[55:45] so let me encourage you again for 2022
[55:47] try to find a way to serve people amen
[55:49] yes serve your family first of course
[55:51] serve god when you do that when you
[55:52] serve your family it's serving god first
[55:56] but find someone to serve because the
[55:59] only way you become great with god is by
[56:01] serving other people
[56:05] that's right
[56:07] he said you've got to leave here when
[56:10] you get here
[56:11] but if you've got this satisfying
[56:13] portion it'll take you up just as
[56:16] certain
[56:18] so if you get god's portion now
[56:20] that portion will lift you up into
[56:22] heaven when you die
[56:24] but if you don't get god's portion here
[56:26] the angels are going to take you down to
[56:28] hell
[56:29] right of course we're talking to
[56:30] everybody listening in too
[56:33] we're always taking out insurance i love
[56:35] this
[56:36] today to give to the undertaker
[56:39] let's get god's satisfying portion and
[56:42] get the uptaker instead of the
[56:44] undertaker
[56:46] you know they both work and the church
[56:48] said
[56:50] right we're always paying life insurance
[56:52] and which is basically death insurance
[56:54] right death insurance
[56:56] but we need to get eternal life
[56:58] assurance
[56:59] that's what we need today we need
[57:01] assurance that when we die or if we die
[57:03] we'll go to heaven praise god
[57:06] how do you get that by saying lord jesus
[57:08] you're my portion
[57:09] you're what i really want in life if i
[57:12] don't have anything else if i'm like a
[57:13] levite and i'll have all these lands and
[57:15] i don't have all these great things to
[57:17] brag about as long as i got you jesus
[57:19] i'll be happy with that because i know
[57:21] that's my uptaker
[57:24] and i only go up into heaven praise god
[57:26] i don't want to go to hell i want to see
[57:28] jesus amen
[57:30] i need to uptake her praise god
[57:33] amen
[57:34] let me say like this you get to uptake
[57:36] her tonight
[57:38] you get to uptake her anytime you can

[58:29] brother ram said in 1960 uh i know
[58:33] he said uh
[58:34] the bible says trials are brought upon
[58:37] us and are more precious to us than gold
[58:40] itself
[58:41] so let me just use austin alina real
[58:43] quick the trials you guys are facing now
[58:45] they're going to be more precious to you
[58:48] than gold
[58:50] if you can go through them
[58:51] and still love god and serve god and
[58:53] wait on god your character will be so
[58:56] much closer to christ's character amen
[58:59] right like our sick people you know
[59:02] uh covered i'd covered last year you
[59:04] know
[59:04] brother amen's got it now i can't wait
[59:06] to talk about the amen i saw him on
[59:08] saturday but i didn't get a chance to
[59:09] talk to him very long you know
[59:11] uh
[59:11] i surprised him i come in there with my
[59:13] big jesus hat on you know
[59:15] i got two masks on i never wear two
[59:16] masks i got this green thing on me
[59:19] covered and she said put it on i'm like
[59:21] okay i'll put it on so i'm walking there
[59:23] like hey relay man
[59:25] probably scared him half to death you
[59:26] know
[59:27] maybe helped his heart pump a little
[59:29] harder you know
[59:31] but uh
[59:33] i just want to encourage him you know
[59:34] maybe he's listening here tonight or
[59:35] maybe he's wrestling but maybe he'll
[59:36] listen to it on the on the live stream
[59:38] but but the bible says we suffer that we
[59:40] might learn obedience
[59:42] now all of us need to obey god better
[59:45] i'm not going to ask you if you need to
[59:46] do it i need to do it we all need to do
[59:48] it praise god
[59:49] amen
[59:51] but i suffered last year with covet
[59:54] different ones suffering now my mom did
[59:57] my brother paul
[59:59] they really suffered with way more than
[1:00:00] i did
[1:00:02] but god allows these things so we'll
[1:00:04] come out on the other end i can't wait
[1:00:06] to ask our brother brother what do you
[1:00:07] think god's trying to teach you through
[1:00:08] this
[1:00:09] laying in the bed for two weeks is no
[1:00:11] fun
[1:00:13] i've never done that
[1:00:15] wow
[1:00:17] so think about what you learned okay
[1:00:19] i'll give you a minute here
[1:00:23] we learn obedience through the things we
[1:00:25] suffer
[1:00:26] suffering is the best teacher
[1:00:30] i know it's hard to say that church but
[1:00:31] that's the truth amen
[1:00:33] suffering is the best teacher
[1:00:35] like when i'm always when i'm sick i'm
[1:00:37] like
[1:00:38] my goodness i can't wait till i get with
[1:00:39] hell they're healthy i'm gonna go do
[1:00:40] this and that and then i do and i feel
[1:00:42] really really good
[1:00:43] like i said as soon as i get well i'm
[1:00:45] gonna go make youtube videos i made i
[1:00:46] think i made six so far since i got
[1:00:47] better i just recorded three more this
[1:00:49] morning
[1:00:51] so it gave me a zeal like i'm gonna i'm
[1:00:53] gonna work harder for jesus amen try to
[1:00:55] set some of these captives free out
[1:00:56] there online you know
[1:00:58] yeah right
[1:01:01] but brother ram says it's more precious
[1:01:03] than gold
[1:01:04] your trials you go through
[1:01:07] because then brother austin you got a
[1:01:08] testimony afterwards can you imagine if
[1:01:10] we could fast forward one year
[1:01:12] what would that awesome next year just
[1:01:14] come back and say to you right now
[1:01:16] he'd say austin
[1:01:17] he said
[1:01:18] he would say you keep pressing
[1:01:21] you come so far in your walk with god
[1:01:23] you know your yourself would say the
[1:01:24] same to you you've come so far
[1:01:26] just keep pressing the battles god's
[1:01:28] going to do this god's going to do that
[1:01:30] god's going to he's going to show you
[1:01:31] all these great things and and you can't
[1:01:34] wait till you get to the next year amen
[1:01:38] you might even say you're going to get
[1:01:39] the holy ghost this year
[1:01:41] somebody say something like that or next
[1:01:43] year you know and that's eternal life
[1:01:45] praise god that's a satisfying portion
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:48] that's what we all need that's what we
[1:01:50] all desire a portion of god's eternal
[1:01:52] life in our souls that makes everything
[1:01:55] insignificant but makes god great amen
[1:01:58] amen
[1:02:01] and keeps him at his highly esteemed
[1:02:03] position in our lives
[1:02:08] he's the object of our life
[1:02:10] that's why we've got to teach preach to
[1:02:11] these young teenagers don't let that
[1:02:13] next husband or wife the husband right
[1:02:15] don't let that become the object of your
[1:02:17] life make jesus the object of your life
[1:02:20] and then if it's his will he'll bring
[1:02:21] the right one at the right time amen
[1:02:23] don't go chasing them like you've seen
[1:02:25] some of our friends do don't do that
[1:02:28] that'll mess you up real fast
[1:02:31] hallelujah
[1:02:33] make christ your portion
[1:02:36] make christ your inheritance your
[1:02:38] possession
[1:02:42] whether how much money you got in your
[1:02:43] pockets tonight well my pockets i mean i
[1:02:45] got a wallet over there i got three pens
[1:02:47] in my pocket that's my possession right
[1:02:49] now right
[1:02:50] and no matter what's in your pocket
[1:02:52] what's in your purse don't worry about
[1:02:54] that matter what's in your soul
[1:02:57] care about what do you possess in your
[1:02:59] soul do i have eternal life in my soul

[1:03:04] all things make sure you got that amen
[1:03:08] make sure you've got eternal life in
[1:03:09] your soul that's your portion amen
[1:03:14] brother braham said
[1:03:17] after we become god's property our
[1:03:19] confession our baptism and our promise
[1:03:21] to walk in life for him then every trial
[1:03:24] that comes upon us is to perfect us for
[1:03:26] his glory
[1:03:30] it's to bring us to a place where god
[1:03:33] can make himself more real to us than he
[1:03:36] was before the trial came amen
[1:03:40] hallelujah
[1:03:43] i want to join this morning with job
[1:03:45] think about this brother ram's joining
[1:03:46] job
[1:03:47] and say i've lived long enough to know
[1:03:49] that's that that's the truth i've seen
[1:03:51] it in my own life that every time a
[1:03:53] great situation rises that i can't get
[1:03:55] around i can't get under it i can't get
[1:03:58] over it god makes a way and comes out
[1:04:01] glorious
[1:04:03] i just wonder how his grace ever does it
[1:04:07] but he does it
[1:04:10] church what are you facing today that
[1:04:12] you can't get over that you can't get
[1:04:14] under it you can't get around it get
[1:04:15] through it trust god with it
[1:04:18] put it in god's hands because you know
[1:04:20] he can get over it
[1:04:22] you know he can get under it you can
[1:04:24] know he can break through it amen
[1:04:26] you can know he can knock it out of the
[1:04:28] way he can blow it he can say peace be
[1:04:30] still and everything will be still our
[1:04:33] god specializes in removing obstacles
[1:04:36] amen
[1:04:38] hallelujah give him a chance to do it
[1:04:40] though
[1:04:41] don't go running the devil for your
[1:04:42] comfort run to god for your portion amen
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:49] and remember in all these things satan
[1:04:51] is trying to make us nervous
[1:04:53] and upset us
[1:04:55] to get us to think oh why did this
[1:04:57] happen why couldn't i have been like
[1:05:00] this
[1:05:01] see satan always wants to make the grass
[1:05:03] look greener on the other side
[1:05:05] but really on the other side there is no
[1:05:07] grass
[1:05:09] right because satan has transformed
[1:05:10] himself as an angel of light an angel of
[1:05:13] making grass
[1:05:14] there is no grass on the other side
[1:05:16] that's the devil's side
[1:05:19] you got in other words you're in the
[1:05:20] best spot you've ever been right now and
[1:05:22] the church said
[1:05:23] if you're walking obedience to jesus
[1:05:25] christ your grass is greener than it's
[1:05:28] ever been and it's only gonna get
[1:05:30] greener praise god can i say it like
[1:05:31] that
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:36] hallelujah just trust god
[1:05:38] just trust god
[1:05:43] that makes me think of something let me
[1:05:44] see did i miss something here
[1:05:46] okay no i didn't okay let me let me
[1:05:48] finish this quote here
[1:05:50] okay now brother ram tells the story
[1:05:53] in 1963
[1:05:55] or i'm sorry oral roberts opened his
[1:05:58] college
[1:05:59] but it was building for three years
[1:06:04] brother brandon visited in tulsa
[1:06:05] oklahoma
[1:06:06] and he said he was walking around saying
[1:06:08] my goodness
[1:06:09] he said he said they're going to have
[1:06:11] this many times like a thousand
[1:06:12] typewriters and all these things he said
[1:06:14] i would hate to see them for them to see
[1:06:16] my office i only have one typewriter
[1:06:21] and he said he started kind of feeling
[1:06:22] bad the devil said see god couldn't
[1:06:24] trust you with this
[1:06:27] you know you're not smart enough to
[1:06:29] handle all these typewriters i mean now
[1:06:30] who is mercy who i mean
[1:06:32] which you could handle 100 computers
[1:06:35] you have to go to school to handle that
[1:06:37] right but who's smart enough to do that
[1:06:39] nobody's smart enough to do that here
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:41] and the devil's like see you know you're
[1:06:43] nobody god can't trust you
[1:06:46] and he said he started to kind of agree
[1:06:48] with the devil yeah yeah yeah maybe god
[1:06:50] couldn't trust me
[1:06:52] and brother man i said all of a sudden
[1:06:53] it sounded like heaven opened up
[1:06:56] and the corridors of heaven became open
[1:06:59] and a voice came down and said don't
[1:07:01] worry i am your portion amen
[1:07:05] seeing this huge multi-million dollar
[1:07:08] building
[1:07:10] and he didn't have one he started
[1:07:11] feeling sorry for himself and look how
[1:07:13] god and his mercy come to encourage him
[1:07:16] see you church when you're battling
[1:07:17] that's when god's going to help you out
[1:07:19] amen
[1:07:20] when you're struggling and you feel
[1:07:21] insignificant like you wasted your life
[1:07:24] that's when god's going to come around
[1:07:25] and say no you've done exactly what i
[1:07:26] told you to do you've been obeying the
[1:07:28] word of god and i'm your portion amen
[1:07:32] don't try to copy them just be what i
[1:07:34] called you to be praise god
[1:07:38] you know what oral roberts started out
[1:07:39] as a mighty man of god but i think he
[1:07:41] fell away
[1:07:42] in 1987 he said god told me you've got
[1:07:45] to send me 8 million or god's going to
[1:07:47] take me off the scene
[1:07:48] no i don't see that in the bible
[1:07:51] do you see that in the bible when did
[1:07:52] joshua say you better send all your gold
[1:07:54] and silver to me or god's going to kill
[1:07:55] me
[1:07:56] nonsense
[1:07:58] nonsense
[1:08:00] i was watching some videos about him i'm
[1:08:01] like oh my goodness he said the lord he
[1:08:03] said he saw a 90-foot vision or 90-foot
[1:08:05] jesus in a vision said you're going to
[1:08:06] build this hospital and you need all
[1:08:08] these millions of dollars to do it it's
[1:08:09] going to be a successful hospital they
[1:08:11] built it only lasted for eight years and
[1:08:13] went bankrupt
[1:08:14] now was that really jesus
[1:08:16] i don't think so church i wouldn't say i
[1:08:19] wouldn't say for sure i'm not saying for
[1:08:20] sure but i'm saying all these fruits and
[1:08:22] what is that money
[1:08:24] money money and brother brown was being
[1:08:26] discouraged but god came around and said
[1:08:28] don't worry about the money worry about
[1:08:29] the souls
[1:08:31] worry about the word
[1:08:33] make sure you've got the true word of
[1:08:34] god that's what's most important
[1:08:37] don't worry about trying to have so many
[1:08:38] thousand dollars per day like he said
[1:08:40] don't worry about the number of
[1:08:41] typewriters worry about the number of
[1:08:43] prayers amen
[1:08:45] worry about the number of souls saved
[1:08:47] praise god worry about the gospel worry
[1:08:49] about your life examine your life to
[1:08:51] make sure you're in the faith
[1:08:54] hallelujah
[1:08:56] and did you know oral roberts ordained
[1:09:00] what's that guy's name that he tried to
[1:09:02] rebuke covet
[1:09:03] kenneth copeland
[1:09:05] he ordained kenneth copeland to take his
[1:09:06] place and look at that guy
[1:09:09] he's probably one of the most devil
[1:09:11] possessed people out there
[1:09:13] he said he's rebuked coven and it was
[1:09:14] going to go away in the name of jesus it
[1:09:15] didn't happen he calls himself a prophet
[1:09:18] and it don't happen
[1:09:20] see look what comes out of a person's
[1:09:22] life if you don't keep christ as your
[1:09:23] portion
[1:09:27] what are you gonna say you get a million
[1:09:29] dollar house what are you gonna say i
[1:09:30] got a million dollars house what's god
[1:09:31] going to say on the day of judgment
[1:09:32] what'd you do with it
[1:09:34] what what'd you do
[1:09:36] why did you want it well then what'd you
[1:09:37] do with it
[1:09:39] how did you glorify me with these or
[1:09:41] were these earthly worldly things how
[1:09:43] did you glorify me
[1:09:48] everybody understand by god's grace
[1:09:57] he said you're right lord he said but as
[1:09:59] long as you're my portion i'm yours and
[1:10:00] you will leave me i could not lead
[1:10:02] myself
[1:10:03] but oh lord
[1:10:05] lead me
[1:10:07] don't lead me to riches lord lead me to
[1:10:10] your will
[1:10:11] i don't care how humble it is i've
[1:10:13] always prayed that i say lord i'd rather
[1:10:15] be humble with a tiny small church as
[1:10:17] long as there's no sin in the church
[1:10:19] and the holy ghost can move whenever he
[1:10:21] wants
[1:10:22] i'd rather have the purity and no sin
[1:10:25] and no adulterers or fornicators or
[1:10:28] liars or effeminate or adulterers or
[1:10:31] anything i'd rather have just pure holy
[1:10:34] ghosts living in the church i'd rather
[1:10:36] have all that praise god than all the
[1:10:38] money or popularity anything like that
[1:10:40] all we want is christ here
[1:10:44] i told you i've talked to people
[1:10:45] recently in the message with big
[1:10:46] churches and they said we don't even
[1:10:47] feel love in our church but we felt it
[1:10:49] when we came to your church
[1:10:51] now what does that speak that speaks
[1:10:53] that the love of god is created by an
[1:10:55] atmosphere of people who love
[1:10:57] righteousness and hate sin amen
[1:11:00] and you can feel it when you walk in
[1:11:03] oh thank god can you feel the love of
[1:11:04] god tonight
[1:11:05] i know i got some strange faces i don't
[1:11:07] mean to be so you know i don't need to
[1:11:08] be so like crazy you know man
[1:11:10] sometimes i ball out sin you know i just
[1:11:11] gotta just ball it out you know like a
[1:11:14] ah it just makes me mad the um i think
[1:11:16] we call it the zeal of the lord so i
[1:11:17] think of what we call it praise god
[1:11:19] sometimes it just burns me up you know
[1:11:21] like i can't i can't stand that
[1:11:23] the way people act
[1:11:24] but remember people feel the love of god
[1:11:26] here we've got to keep it that way amen
[1:11:29] because you can have a little church and
[1:11:30] god ain't there too
[1:11:32] so let's not pat ourselves on the back
[1:11:34] just yet
[1:11:36] let's not ever pat ourselves on the back
[1:11:38] let's just take up our cross and let our
[1:11:40] cross pat us on the back
[1:11:42] i like that that's i didn't think of
[1:11:43] that before that's good
[1:11:45] thank you jesus
[1:11:47] let's let our crosses pat us on the back
[1:11:49] take up the cross and follow jesus
[1:11:52] i got two minutes left on my hour so
[1:11:54] um
[1:11:58] let me try to find a place to close okay
[1:11:59] you can go back up here to the uh
[1:12:04] to the slides here let me close here
[1:12:06] give me give me five let me put five or
[1:12:07] ten minutes on here
[1:12:11] thank you church for your patience here
[1:12:12] tonight
[1:12:13] are you enjoying the word tonight
[1:12:15] amen praise god hallelujah such a
[1:12:17] blessing to be in god's house
[1:12:19] let's go to this thought here
[1:12:21] the chapter goes through all 48 cities
[1:12:23] right it names the cities and all the
[1:12:25] tribes that get them but it ends with
[1:12:26] this beautiful portion now to understand
[1:12:29] this you have to understand god is
[1:12:30] talking to joshua at the very end of his
[1:12:33] life he's almost 110 years old
[1:12:36] he died at 110.
[1:12:38] he spent the first 39 years in egypt can
[1:12:41] you imagine that
[1:12:42] he was in the world for almost 40 years
[1:12:46] and then he spent the next 40 years
[1:12:48] wandering in the wilderness out in tents
[1:12:51] can you imagine that he went from slave
[1:12:53] labor
[1:12:54] right to kind of desert life
[1:12:58] and then by the grace of god this is
[1:13:00] beautiful it's kind of it's kind of
[1:13:01] broke up like
[1:13:03] moses is three stages of his life too
[1:13:07] that by the power of god he takes the
[1:13:09] church into the baptism holy ghost i
[1:13:11] mean canaan he takes them into the
[1:13:13] canaan's land and they start driving out
[1:13:15] every demon power and all the 31 kings
[1:13:18] and he gets to live in there and battle
[1:13:20] in there for 31 years of his life
[1:13:26] i've been serving god since 2000
[1:13:28] basically i got saved right then of
[1:13:29] 1999.
[1:13:32] so i've served god for almost 21 years
[1:13:36] he had 31 years in the promised land
[1:13:41] and at the end of his years
[1:13:44] here's what's written about god's
[1:13:46] faithfulness to joshua
[1:13:50] this is chapter 21 the end of it the
[1:13:52] last three verses and the lord gave unto
[1:13:55] israel all the land which he swear to
[1:13:57] given to their fathers in other words
[1:13:59] god whatever god promised he did it
[1:14:02] if god promised you something god's
[1:14:04] going to do it amen amen
[1:14:07] and they possessed it
[1:14:09] and dwelt therein
[1:14:11] all those years of dreaming about it all
[1:14:14] those years of hoping maybe this is year
[1:14:16] they were over
[1:14:18] and now they weren't dreaming about it
[1:14:20] they were experiencing it
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] they were it was reality to them amen
[1:14:27] sometimes we get so tired of talking
[1:14:28] about the rapture don't we
[1:14:30] or this squeeze it was something nice to
[1:14:32] see i i don't know i don't know about
[1:14:33] you but i do sometimes
[1:14:34] sometimes i get so tired the squeeze
[1:14:36] that's because we're just human
[1:14:38] but one of these days
[1:14:40] it ain't going to be no more dreaming
[1:14:42] about it or hoping about it it's going
[1:14:44] to be here
[1:14:46] and then will the true bride of jesus
[1:14:48] christ stand up and i will say yes lord
[1:14:50] here we are we're waiting all these
[1:14:52] years take us in to that last anointing
[1:14:56] take us in to the lateran anointing they
[1:14:58] may force the bride to stop preaching
[1:15:00] publicly but shall keep preaching
[1:15:02] privately and that's where god will meet
[1:15:04] her in that little tent in that little
[1:15:06] special place and the secret place says
[1:15:09] god will quicken her mortal body
[1:15:13] and they won't be talking about it
[1:15:14] anymore
[1:15:16] but they'll be experienced just like
[1:15:18] joshua all those years talking about it
[1:15:21] but finally they started possessing it
[1:15:24] and everything god said
[1:15:27] came to pass
[1:15:29] think about that we've already heard the
[1:15:30] shout one of these days
[1:15:33] the voice of the archangel is gonna
[1:15:34] sound
[1:15:36] don't worry about it you'll recognize it
[1:15:38] because if you can hear this word if
[1:15:40] you've got ears to hear trust me you'll
[1:15:42] hear that trumpet amen don't worry about
[1:15:44] it
[1:15:45] the voice of the archangel
[1:15:48] we've talked about it we've talked about
[1:15:50] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:15:52] arise first don't worry about it you
[1:15:54] just keep pressing toward every promise
[1:15:57] god made god is going to fulfill
[1:15:59] all heaven and earth can pass away and
[1:16:02] god's word still won't fail god is going
[1:16:04] to back up his word god is faithful god
[1:16:07] is not a man that he would lie praise
[1:16:09] god god's not a politician that he would
[1:16:11] lie god is a man he's a holy man he's
[1:16:14] faithful amen
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:20] and finally they experienced it for 31
[1:16:22] years
[1:16:22] now of course part of that 31 years was
[1:16:24] battling
[1:16:26] and the lord gave them rest round about
[1:16:30] after killing 31 kings
[1:16:33] he could finally lay the sword down
[1:16:36] and let's just say 50 he could enjoy 15
[1:16:38] years of peace with his family
[1:16:40] and then it was time to say so long
[1:16:42] i'm going the way of all the earth
[1:16:45] but before i go
[1:16:47] let me tell you
[1:16:48] god keeps all of his word amen
[1:16:51] before i die
[1:16:53] let me tell you god never failed me
[1:16:56] how many want that testimony
[1:16:59] really
[1:17:00] you really want that testimony
[1:17:02] then be like joshua
[1:17:04] be strong in the lord
[1:17:06] and the power of his might
[1:17:08] be of good courage church
[1:17:10] jesus said be of courage because i've
[1:17:12] overcome the world amen amen praise god
[1:17:15] amen the world your the world has
[1:17:17] already been beat today man you just got
[1:17:19] to trust god and jesus will walk you
[1:17:21] through all your victories amen
[1:17:23] he's already defeated the world
[1:17:26] you just got to let him defeat in your
[1:17:27] life
[1:17:30] he gave them rest according to all that
[1:17:31] they swear to their fathers and there
[1:17:33] stood not a man of all their enemies
[1:17:35] before them one guy emailed me and said
[1:17:36] i heard how you said that you that you i
[1:17:39] fell down at your feet and i haven't
[1:17:40] emailed him back yet because i'm waiting
[1:17:42] on the lord
[1:17:43] but anybody knows i wasn't talking about
[1:17:45] natural falling at my feet i never even
[1:17:47] seen the man
[1:17:49] he just came up in a debate
[1:17:51] the point i was making his spiritual his
[1:17:53] evil spirit that was trying to stand
[1:17:55] before me it couldn't convince me to
[1:17:57] leave the truth
[1:17:58] and i stood there and that spirit left
[1:18:01] that's what i was saying
[1:18:03] the lies fell at my feet not the man the
[1:18:06] lies
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:08] by the truth and sell it not praise god
[1:18:11] that's what we know
[1:18:12] if we keep god's word no man no lie no
[1:18:15] demon will be able to stand before us
[1:18:17] all the days of our lives
[1:18:20] and you'll stand for jesus christ
[1:18:23] when other times other people might have
[1:18:24] fallen
[1:18:26] you'll stand
[1:18:28] these people don't have to follow my
[1:18:29] feet i could care less about that
[1:18:31] it's their lies and their uh their false
[1:18:33] doctrines and their temptations and
[1:18:36] their devils that's what's going to fall
[1:18:37] at my feet
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:41] the lord delivered all their enemies
[1:18:44] into their hand
[1:18:46] hallelujah
[1:18:49] they're failed not
[1:18:51] ought of any good thing which the lord
[1:18:54] had spoken
[1:18:56] to israel
[1:18:57] and all
[1:18:59] came to pass
[1:19:02] how many want that testimony amen
[1:19:05] everything the lord told me has come to
[1:19:08] pass
[1:19:10] you know we've seen that song every
[1:19:11] promise in the book is mine well not
[1:19:12] exactly
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:17] it kind of depends how you what if god
[1:19:19] don't want to hear you then is that
[1:19:20] promise yours what
[1:19:23] paul said three times lord take away
[1:19:25] this devil and the lord said no my grace
[1:19:27] is sufficient well i thought every
[1:19:29] promise in the book was his
[1:19:33] you see
[1:19:34] there's times and seasons now next time
[1:19:36] we've seen that y'all gonna be like
[1:19:37] should we sing this well jesse when are
[1:19:38] you gonna leave this off the the
[1:19:40] the easy worship
[1:19:41] that's not what i'm saying
[1:19:44] let me say like this every promise in
[1:19:46] the book to you is yours
[1:19:48] but it's got to be to you think about it
[1:19:50] two thousand years of christians have
[1:19:51] died thinking they'd be the ones that go
[1:19:53] in the rapture that promise wasn't to
[1:19:55] them
[1:19:56] where they'd be changed in the moment
[1:19:58] drinking alive they've got to go by the
[1:19:59] grave
[1:20:00] and the dead in christ will rise first
[1:20:01] so let's be careful what we're thinking
[1:20:02] about sometimes
[1:20:04] right
[1:20:07] church i want to say that that god
[1:20:10] brought me into the baptism holy ghost i
[1:20:11] battled battle battled and then i
[1:20:13] enjoyed my seasons of rest
[1:20:15] and i can say that god was faithful to
[1:20:20] everything god gave me every good thing
[1:20:23] that i needed
[1:20:24] amen not one thing he said ever failed
[1:20:29] not one thing i asked did he not somehow
[1:20:32] answer my requests
[1:20:34] do you want that tonight
[1:20:35] let's stand to our feet
[1:20:40] i didn't get to go where i wanted to go
[1:20:42] but i've already preached over an hour
[1:20:43] and ten minutes so let me stop right
[1:20:44] there lord willing maybe i'll pick that

[1:21:05] church let's just bow our heads for a
[1:21:06] moment
[1:21:07] is there any obstacle that you can't get
[1:21:09] around
[1:21:10] you can't get under you can't get over

[1:21:17] remember your trials god allowed them
[1:21:21] so that means god is going to bring you
[1:21:22] through them
[1:21:24] the bible said god will not give you a
[1:21:26] temptation that you can't overcome
[1:21:30] these trials are more precious to you
[1:21:32] than gold
[1:21:33] because they will give you a portion of
[1:21:35] god's character you will gain more trust
[1:21:38] for god you'll gain more love for god
[1:21:40] going through the trial than you would
[1:21:42] if you didn't go through the trial
[1:21:45] and you learn more when we suffer when i
[1:21:47] suffer when you suffer we learn more
[1:21:50] than if we don't suffer
