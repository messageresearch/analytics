[0:00] heart lately I like to look at music and
[0:03] worship tonight just a general a general
[0:05] look at music and worship because
[0:07] tomorrow I'm headed to Junction City
[0:09] and I felt led last time I like to
[0:12] preach to them on some of these
[0:14] scriptures so I like to revisit this I
[0:17] preach on music in 2021 there in January
[0:20] so I just want to just revisit a few of
[0:22] those things by the grace of the Lord
[0:24] I trust you'll be blessed how many are
[0:26] blessed already to be in the house of
[0:27] the Lord tonight amen
[0:29] hallelujah it's always a joy to serve
[0:30] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[0:33] so second Kings chapter 3 verse 15 it
[0:35] was read one verse and have you be
[0:36] seated here by the grace of the Lord
[0:46] it's really neat brother Levi brother
[0:47] Thomas both came out of the Amish
[0:49] community and that's something I've got
[0:50] a lot in common there by God's good
[0:52] wonderful testimonies praise God so
[0:54] let's look to like a look at just a
[0:56] general thought of music and worship
[0:58] I'll probably start looking at worship
[1:00] verses and then just a few verses and
[1:02] quotations about music
[1:08] second Kings chapter 3 verse 15 we can
[1:10] all read this here if we can here uh box
[1:13] Grace and honor the word of God let's
[1:14] read this on three one two three but now
[1:17] bring me a Minstrel and it came to pass
[1:21] when the menstrual played that the hand
[1:24] of the Lord came upon him praise God may
[1:28] God as the blessings to dream of his
[1:29] word you may be seated praise God
[1:31] praise God of course most you know this
[1:33] context here I believe it's the prophet
[1:35] Elisha
[1:36] and uh
[1:39] he was visited by Jehoshaphat and uh
[1:43] also the son of Ahab and now ahab's son
[1:45] wasn't a very good man he was a corrupt
[1:48] man
[1:48] but Jehoshaphat was a pretty good man
[1:51] he was a
[1:53] he was good but he disobeyed in some
[1:55] areas the Bible said but overall he no
[1:58] doubt he was saved you can switch over
[2:00] have a few quotes here
[2:02] I just want to bring out of this thought
[2:03] just the power of worship and music
[2:06] Elisha was a prophet and
[2:10] these two men these two kings came to
[2:12] him and said we need the word of God
[2:14] and he didn't want to do it because it
[2:17] was ahab's son but he said for
[2:19] jehoshaphat's sake I'll do it
[2:22] he was a little bit uh upset Prophet
[2:25] we'd say
[2:27] because he knew the testimony of ahab's
[2:29] son was not a good testimony
[2:31] it turns into how it is you know
[2:32] sometimes we love our enemies but we
[2:34] don't love what they do
[2:37] so the prophet was not happy with what
[2:39] ahab's son was doing
[2:41] uh but because of the believer brother
[2:44] calls him one place the lukewarm
[2:45] believer another place he calls him the
[2:47] foolish virgin
[2:49] uh the wise I'm sorry yeah the wise
[2:52] would have been Elisha right he said but
[2:54] because of that believer
[2:56] I'll I'll answer your request
[2:58] and so uh
[3:00] to get it to get to get the profit out
[3:02] of this bad mood to get the profit out
[3:03] of this discouragement that this at this
[3:05] sinner you know is kind of just trying
[3:07] to get a word from the Lord from him he
[3:09] says bring a menstrual down here and a
[3:11] minstrels just say skilled musician
[3:14] uh who plays stringed instruments so he
[3:17] brought some string instrument down
[3:18] there maybe a harp or a
[3:20] something like that some type of guitar
[3:22] or some some type of a string instrument
[3:24] he started playing and as soon as he
[3:26] starts playing
[3:27] the Bible says the hand of God comes
[3:29] upon God's servant now how many know
[3:31] that sometimes when you really start
[3:33] worshiping God you feel God's presence
[3:35] come on you I feel it tonight praise God
[3:38] I don't know if you felt it tonight or
[3:40] not praise God hallelujah
[3:42] and so we just got ahead to get out of
[3:43] his bad attitude he had to just get into
[3:45] the worship
[3:46] and as soon as he got in the worship he
[3:48] felt God's presence come on him
[3:49] Hallelujah
[3:51] Hallelujah and then we know the story
[3:52] you know dig the valley full of ditches
[3:54] and everything like that and of course
[3:56] it led to their deliverance and their
[3:58] Victory but that's not really want to
[3:59] look at I just want to look at the
[4:00] importance of music and worship praise
[4:03] God so I want to uh you know I felt led
[4:06] to look at revisit this uh in the last
[4:09] few weeks you know I've been talking to
[4:11] some other brothers about music and and
[4:13] so forth and I just want to I'll get to
[4:14] that music but I first want to look at
[4:16] just some general scriptures on worship
[4:18] uh as some of you as most of you know uh
[4:21] I bapt in in April I baptized 17 former
[4:25] Amish people in the name of the Lord
[4:26] Jesus Christ
[4:28] it was all God God used brother Levi and
[4:30] I was just I was just standing there
[4:31] watching God do it I didn't do nothing
[4:33] they just needed a preacher to baptize
[4:35] him what's that
[4:37] that's how it always is God gets all the
[4:39] glory
[4:40] but I was just standing there watching
[4:41] what God was doing Chad Lamb was there
[4:43] and his friend Brother Kyle the minister
[4:46] well but they come out of a man-made
[4:49] legalistic church I mean it was so
[4:52] legalistic outside of the Bible they had
[4:54] a book like this thick of their own
[4:56] human rules they had to follow that
[4:58] weren't in the Bible
[5:00] and on the very first sermon I said well
[5:02] who's sick and who wants prayer only one
[5:04] person was sick I said are there any
[5:05] other needs and every other person
[5:07] raised their hand I need deliverance
[5:09] from the fear of man
[5:12] I thought wow
[5:14] here uh the Believers you know they were
[5:17] all like I was looking at they look
[5:18] healthy they look fine
[5:20] but that's from the outside
[5:22] right God saw down to the inside
[5:25] and they were tormented by the fear of
[5:28] their former Pastor now thank God
[5:30] they're free
[5:31] they prayed anointed the place with oil
[5:33] and the pastor left by God's grace it's
[5:36] now they're free in Christ Jesus
[5:37] Hallelujah
[5:38] but it was really just something and you
[5:40] know to see them just come out of
[5:42] basically come out of legalism
[5:45] and just want the truth and so I just
[5:46] felt inspired to start preaching on
[5:48] preach on the Seven Seals uh the baptism
[5:51] of the Holy Ghost to them just laying
[5:53] these foundational truths that they need
[5:54] I preach a little bit on Dancing that
[5:56] was good by God's grace I got to dance
[5:57] around the brother's garage that was
[5:59] wonderful so I had to make sure I didn't
[6:01] hit my head on the garage door things
[6:03] there
[6:04] but it was great just to be free in the
[6:05] Holy Spirit and last time we were there
[6:07] we preached on the baptism Holy Ghost
[6:09] and the leaders weeping and crying he
[6:10] said he said I can't imagine for 58
[6:13] years I never knew this but now I'm 59
[6:15] and now the Bible's becoming a brand new
[6:17] Bible to me because he's not under the
[6:20] fear of man he's under the fear of God
[6:21] hallelujah
[6:23] amen but Lord willing tomorrow the Lord
[6:25] tarries and if the Lord guides our steps
[6:27] and we stay healthy and everything I
[6:28] want to preach on some of these
[6:30] scriptures about worship just general
[6:32] scriptures about worship tonight uh and
[6:35] I'll preach it Lord willing to them uh
[6:37] tomorrow now the first time the word
[6:38] worship is used in the Bible is of
[6:41] course with Abraham
[6:42] when he went to uh he was told by God to
[6:45] sacrifice Isaac we know it's just a test
[6:47] God is not a murderer right it was just
[6:50] a test and Abraham passed the test
[6:52] Hallelujah
[6:53] but he was told to go worship now of
[6:55] course we know there are other examples
[6:57] of worship before this like with Noah
[6:58] they had burnt offerings and and of
[7:00] course Cain and Abel different examples
[7:02] of worship some were accepted some were
[7:04] rejected and we want accepted worship
[7:06] praise God we want God to accept our
[7:08] worship praise God now worship is simply
[7:11] in the Hebrews means to bow down that's
[7:13] why I was bound down during that song
[7:14] you know I thought about this and that's
[7:16] just it's one way to worship
[7:18] now we know it's more important to Bow
[7:20] your heart than to Bow your knee
[7:23] but we know every knee will bow praise
[7:26] God
[7:27] if you don't bow your knee now to Jesus
[7:29] Christ one day you will praise God so
[7:31] let's do it now while we have life and
[7:33] breath praise God
[7:34] Hallelujah
[7:36] what God really wants though is a heart
[7:38] that's bowed to do God's will
[7:41] in other words God wants a humble heart
[7:43] that will hear the word of God receive
[7:45] it with gladness and then obey it praise
[7:47] God
[7:48] that's the Bowing that's the worship
[7:50] that God really wants tonight praise God
[7:52] and yes the real worship of God will
[7:54] make you fall down maybe lay at the
[7:56] altar maybe kneel at the altar here
[7:57] maybe kneel at your chair there and seek
[7:59] God and go home and pray in your closet
[8:01] praise God to make a bow down at your
[8:03] bed and pray and close your eyes and cry
[8:05] out to God it'll make you do that too
[8:07] praise God
[8:08] but what God wants is your homage or
[8:11] your respect that's what God wants
[8:13] now the word homage to us means respect
[8:15] or recognition or admiration or honor so
[8:18] if someone says well I'm a worshiper of
[8:20] God what they're what they're trying to
[8:22] say is I admire God I honor God I'm
[8:25] recognizing God hallelujah
[8:27] and so there's a lot of uh you know
[8:29] synonyms and and so forth
[8:32] and so we can understand basically
[8:34] homages worship and his respect it's
[8:36] giving God glory in other words praise
[8:38] God
[8:39] now of course we see this in the New
[8:41] Testament as well Jesus said God's a
[8:43] spirit and God is looking now previous
[8:46] verse says God's looking for worshipers
[8:48] amen praise God I wonder where he'd find
[8:50] him he'd find them right here tonight
[8:52] praise God that's where he'd find them
[8:54] amen you're not going to find him in the
[8:56] bar necessarily he's not going to find
[8:57] him at the movie theater he's going to
[8:59] find them in the house of God hallelujah
[9:02] this is God's house Hallelujah
[9:04] and so he's looking for true worshipers
[9:07] that will worship Him in spirit and in
[9:09] truth praise God and so now we see
[9:11] through Jesus this is the same of course
[9:13] in the Old Testament God wants people
[9:15] that will worship in the Holy Spirit and
[9:17] worship in truth praise God
[9:20] Hallelujah now it's very simple to
[9:21] understand you know uh Worship in the
[9:24] spirit means you're actually following
[9:25] the leading of the Holy Spirit
[9:27] the holy spirit's anointing you the holy
[9:30] spirit's empowering you amen
[9:33] and then at the same time you're obeying
[9:35] the truth of God's word amen
[9:37] amen you're not following some man-made
[9:39] idea or Jesus said a tradition of man
[9:41] like a traditional man is praying to
[9:42] Mary you never find that in the Bible
[9:44] that's a tradition of man
[9:47] or listening to a woman preach you'll
[9:48] never see a woman preacher in the Bible
[9:50] that's a tradition of man
[9:52] so there they are worshiping but they're
[9:54] not worshiping in the truth
[9:56] but Jesus said Worship in spirit and in
[9:59] truth praise God Amen that's the word
[10:01] here tonight by God's grace Amen to
[10:04] Worship in spirit and Truth Now the New
[10:06] Testament worship means to kiss like a
[10:08] dog licking his Master's Hand and I got
[10:10] a fresh experience that when I wrote
[10:12] with Austin last week his dog jumped all
[10:14] over me and licked me I felt like I'd
[10:16] taken a bath there
[10:17] laughs he was just licking me all over I
[10:20] don't have a dog or so it's kind of
[10:21] fresh to me you know
[10:24] also means you know just the act of you
[10:26] know kissing your hand out to kiss a
[10:28] man's hand is is worship that's why we
[10:30] don't kiss men we don't kiss the Pope's
[10:33] hand we don't kiss any man's hand
[10:35] because destruction of worship it also
[10:37] means profound reverence so the most the
[10:40] most possible respecter or an admiration
[10:43] you give to anybody that's worship but
[10:45] we don't give it to uh people we give it
[10:47] to Christ amen
[10:49] we respect everyone here but we don't
[10:51] respect them as much as we respect God
[10:54] because if someone in here told you to
[10:55] do something wrong you would
[10:57] respectfully decline amen because you
[11:00] respect God's word more Hallelujah
[11:03] amen but of course you should love your
[11:05] all your family friends and
[11:07] so forth
[11:09] we understand that so we get the idea
[11:10] it's this idea of giving the highest
[11:13] respect the highest honor is worship
[11:16] you know other definitions I remember
[11:18] are just you know someone's value right
[11:20] when you worship them you show their
[11:22] value
[11:23] I'm glad we could come here we can we
[11:25] can play the piano the organ and raise
[11:27] our hands and clap and stomp and and
[11:30] wave our hands we show God how much we
[11:32] value him praise God
[11:34] we don't do that for anybody else amen
[11:37] or anything else praise God we do that
[11:39] for Jesus only praise God
[11:41] he's worth it praise God Amen he's
[11:44] worthy of it Hallelujah because he died
[11:47] on the cross and he rose from the grave
[11:49] and he sent the Holy Ghost into our
[11:51] hearts Hallelujah that's why he's worthy
[11:53] amen
[11:54] Glory
[11:55] so just simple we get in the spirit by
[11:57] obeying the truth Simon preached out on
[11:58] Sunday right how do you walk in the
[12:00] spirit how do you walk in the light you
[12:02] obey the truth it's that simple whether
[12:05] you feel the anointing or not if you
[12:06] keep obeying you're going to feel the
[12:08] anointing praise God
[12:10] I eventually come back praise God you
[12:12] know if you grieve the Holy Spirit he's
[12:13] like the Dove and he flies away but if
[12:15] you keep obeying he'll come back and
[12:17] anoint you praise God hallelujah
[12:20] sort of walk in the spirit you have to
[12:22] obey and then crucify the desires of the
[12:24] flesh we saw that in Galatians 5 on
[12:26] Sunday
[12:28] and then church now that we got that now
[12:30] that we're obeying and we feel God's
[12:32] spirit now we start praising God just
[12:36] like Elisha amen hallelujah
[12:38] and the spirit drops down upon us like I
[12:42] wasn't anticipating to preach like this
[12:43] tonight I know the prince of God is here
[12:45] amen foreign
[12:49] before service now you won't see me
[12:51] yelling the rest of the service praise
[12:53] God I tell you thank God Amen
[12:56] because the spirit of God perks you up
[12:58] amen it anoints you it empowers you
[13:00] Hallelujah
[13:03] now there's many expressions of worship
[13:05] and this is what I want our former
[13:06] former Amish friends I want to call them
[13:07] Amish anymore I want to call them The
[13:09] Junction City Saints because they're not
[13:11] Amish anymore
[13:12] Hallelujah they come out of the Amish
[13:14] community
[13:15] I want to give them the right name but I
[13:16] want to just show them you know and just
[13:18] remind us some of the simple ways we can
[13:20] express worship
[13:22] now before I go on you know there's
[13:23] there's lots of ways to express worship
[13:26] to God I'll just share a few you know uh
[13:29] you know when we're over there in
[13:30] Napoleon a couple months ago
[13:33] and we had that six hour service
[13:36] I preached for two hours brother and
[13:37] then the children danced
[13:39] uh I dance we scream shouted we cried at
[13:42] the altar the Holy Ghost fell in six
[13:43] people for two hours we did that two
[13:45] hours straight
[13:46] but what started that I started dancing
[13:49] and then remember Haven come running up
[13:52] see so at some point someone's got to
[13:54] get in the spirit as well
[13:56] you've got to do something to get in the
[13:58] spirit
[13:59] all right
[14:00] amen see I I watched a video we want to
[14:02] watch the video didn't we last week
[14:03] I was dancing all by myself and then
[14:05] pretty soon Heyman comes up and then
[14:06] it's like a rush of the Holy Ghost fell
[14:09] remember you guys remember that yeah
[14:11] someone had to do something amen you
[14:14] need a Miriam out there amen
[14:17] and Moses to start singing in the spirit
[14:19] praise God amen amen he's somebody to
[14:22] act on the word to love God to worship
[14:24] God to show God some homage Hallelujah
[14:27] to show God some respect Hallelujah to
[14:30] show him some honor praise God
[14:33] now you remember brother Troy sweetie
[14:35] sweetie right uh it's been a while he's
[14:37] up in Michigan I just lost touch with
[14:38] him I wouldn't invite him to preach
[14:39] again I love his ministry
[14:41] he was the one that prayed for uh sorry
[14:44] he's the one that prayed for brother
[14:45] Philip who had a cane and he and he went
[14:48] when he went back to his seat he said I
[14:49] feel burning in my leg within one week
[14:52] he no longer needed the cane anymore
[14:55] because Jesus Christ is the same
[14:56] yesterday today and forever
[14:59] he still does Miracles he still heals
[15:01] the sick he still raises the dead praise
[15:03] God
[15:04] maybe not when we want to but when he
[15:06] wants to praise God
[15:08] anyways brother Troy always tells this
[15:10] story I think he told last time I was
[15:11] listening to a sermon
[15:13] he said one time he was in the service
[15:15] and he said he heard a voice say stand
[15:17] up on the chair
[15:20] no way
[15:22] he just went back to singing you know
[15:23] you know Troy you know he's probably
[15:24] like this
[15:26] and you heard the voice again stand up
[15:28] on the chair
[15:29] and worship
[15:34] the third time he said stand up on the
[15:36] chair brother said he stood up on the
[15:37] chair he said as soon as he did that the
[15:39] Holy Ghost fell people started screaming
[15:41] shouting there was tongues
[15:42] interpretation weeping out the altar I
[15:44] don't know all the testimonies but he
[15:46] had to obey the leading of the Holy
[15:48] Spirit
[15:50] right just like this just like with uh
[15:52] the Prophet Elijah you have to oh yeah
[15:54] someone has to do something
[15:56] God is leading someone to do something
[15:58] right God's leading me to God's leading
[16:01] you God's leading us to do something but
[16:03] we got to do what the Holy Spirit wants
[16:04] us to do praise God
[16:07] amen
[16:08] like what led me that remember a few
[16:09] weeks ago what let me to say Austin you
[16:11] have a migraine this morning remember
[16:12] that
[16:14] I didn't even know he had a migraine it
[16:15] was discernment
[16:17] and then we prayed for him and it left
[16:18] in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[16:22] it was God it was just God speaking
[16:24] through me
[16:25] I mean how privileged are we that God
[16:28] could speak through US praise God
[16:29] because we're nothing we're nobodies
[16:33] what a privilege he'd borrow our lips
[16:35] and our in our confused Minds sometimes
[16:37] you know in our our bad attitudes he can
[16:40] still use us but we got to get in the
[16:42] spirit first amen
[16:44] [Applause]
[16:45] we just got to get in the spirit
[16:48] spirit and Truth praise God I know we
[16:50] got the truth
[16:52] I've written two books on it no one's
[16:54] ever stood up to it so I know we got the
[16:56] truth
[16:56] and that's because it was first in the
[16:58] church age book that's why I just
[17:00] borrowed those I just borrowed it and
[17:02] expanded on it
[17:03] now let's look at some of these examples
[17:04] you know and I want these you knew worst
[17:06] person no I want you to know too you can
[17:08] bless God with a loud voice in church
[17:12] now traditionally when we come into
[17:13] church we come in real quietly because
[17:15] the world is so busy right we can I mean
[17:17] who is busy today
[17:19] I thought my head was going to spin off
[17:21] I had so much going on well get Malachi
[17:22] the haircut I get this oh don't forget
[17:24] that get the car seats in the car I was
[17:26] like man
[17:28] I was so busy
[17:29] and that's why when we come in we don't
[17:31] come in talking we try to calm down and
[17:33] talk to God
[17:36] because our now we're eventually going
[17:38] to get loud praise God
[17:40] but the world is so loud there's so many
[17:42] distractions there's so many voices so
[17:44] many
[17:45] notifications and dings and videos and
[17:47] then
[17:48] we got to quiet our Spirits a little bit
[17:52] we got to say bring me a bring me a
[17:54] Malachi bring me an amen bring me a
[17:56] Lydia
[17:58] is that right Church bring me a
[18:01] menstrual bring me a Brother Ray who can
[18:02] play the tambourine or sister Naomi
[18:04] plays that or whoever whoever else plays
[18:06] that bring me a neutral praise God
[18:09] so we quiet down and we try to get in
[18:11] the spear and make sure we're obeying
[18:13] the truth praise God
[18:15] amen
[18:17] but the Bible says
[18:19] you know when Jesus here a week before
[18:22] he was arrested
[18:24] Palm Sunday they were the people were
[18:27] shouting blessed be the king that cometh
[18:28] in the name of the Lord peace in heaven
[18:30] glory in the highest and some of the
[18:32] Pharisees among the multitudes sending
[18:34] him Master rebuke our disciples and he
[18:37] answers to them I tell you if these
[18:38] would if these should hold their peace
[18:41] the stones would immediately cry out
[18:44] because the Bible had said uh it was 500
[18:47] years earlier that when Jesus came
[18:49] riding on a cult the foul of an ass that
[18:52] the Bible said they would shout Hosanna
[18:55] so God said it's going to happen it's
[18:57] going to happen
[18:58] Hallelujah and if the people wouldn't do
[19:01] it God said I'll raise up stones and do
[19:03] it praise God it's going to happen
[19:05] someone's going to shout with the loud
[19:07] voice saying blessed be the king Blessed
[19:10] Be King Jesus Hallelujah
[19:13] somebody's gonna do it praise God
[19:16] Hallelujah
[19:18] don't understand Jesus and say yeah
[19:19] you're right you know we should quiet
[19:20] down and maybe not praise praise me so
[19:22] much
[19:24] he said let him praise me amen
[19:27] hallelujah it's written God wanted it to
[19:29] happen that's why God prophesied about
[19:31] it praise God
[19:33] so we can expect that Hallelujah now we
[19:36] don't have the body of Jesus but when
[19:38] the spirit of Jesus comes in then we can
[19:40] shout blessings honor praise Glory
[19:42] Majesty might Old Dominion goes to
[19:45] Christ Our King Hallelujah
[19:47] [Applause]
[19:49] that's right
[19:50] [Applause]
[19:52] so you got the right to do that that's
[19:54] true worship
[19:56] also you can kneel
[19:58] or stand with their hands up you can
[20:00] stand like this if you want or you can
[20:02] kneel down
[20:03] whichever one you want or you can sit
[20:06] with your hands up you might as well now
[20:07] you got all three levels right standing
[20:09] kneeling and sitting you got all three
[20:11] levels
[20:12] and you can do that praying in a loud
[20:14] voice if you want
[20:16] now normally we wait till after the
[20:18] preaching right because the preaching is
[20:19] God's message to his people
[20:22] that's what the Bible says the ministers
[20:24] the Bible say they give themselves to
[20:26] study to word and prayer God gives them
[20:28] the word you come out the you sing and
[20:30] worship the spirit comes down you preach
[20:32] the word of God God's people receive
[20:34] God's word and then it's time to worship
[20:35] hallelujah or then it's time to cast out
[20:38] Devils Hallelujah
[20:40] amen
[20:41] because God's power is present to heal
[20:44] Hallelujah
[20:47] there's numerous examples in this case
[20:48] it's Solomon Solomon was kneeling in the
[20:51] blue there kneeling on his knees with
[20:52] his hands spread up to heaven he prayed
[20:55] his huge long prayer I think it's a
[20:56] whole chapter long
[20:58] so he's praying on his knees and and
[21:00] he's blessing God asking God to anoint
[21:02] the house and then he stands up
[21:04] and then He blesses all the congregation
[21:07] of Israel with a loud voice
[21:09] so he prayed with a loud voice and then
[21:11] he blessed the people of the LIE Bush
[21:13] saying blessed be the Lord hallelujah
[21:16] amen he blessed the Lord Jehovah the
[21:20] self-existent one
[21:23] now church it's okay like we know
[21:25] there's a balance too it's okay to
[21:26] quietly praise God we're going to get to
[21:27] that the Bible said be still and know
[21:29] that I'm God
[21:31] when you're going through difficult
[21:32] times you don't feel like shouting you
[21:33] don't always have to right
[21:35] right there are times to be quiet but
[21:36] I'm just letting you know God love this
[21:38] amen that was the service where God the
[21:40] priest couldn't even get in the temple
[21:42] because God failed it Hallelujah
[21:45] God stop the priest from ministering
[21:47] because God wanted to dwell in that
[21:49] place hallelujah oh that's real worship
[21:51] Hallelujah
[21:52] that'd make you get on your knees
[21:54] wouldn't it
[21:55] if you saw a miracle if you saw the Holy
[21:57] Ghost if you saw somebody speak in
[21:58] tongues and interpret if you saw
[22:00] somebody healed by a miracle it'd make
[22:02] you fall on your knees and give God
[22:04] praise Hallelujah
[22:06] it's exactly right
[22:08] just for our visitors both Steve and
[22:09] Shelby you know my mom was here with
[22:11] cancer when I was eight years old
[22:13] she was dying of cancer she had bruises
[22:16] all over her back in the hospital the
[22:18] doctor gave her six months to live
[22:21] it's in it's incurable there was cancer
[22:23] of the liver
[22:25] and my dad said no and then someone else
[22:28] gave her a word of Prophecy from Psalm
[22:29] 118 17.
[22:31] I shall not die but I will live and
[22:34] declare the works of the Lord
[22:36] and one night my dad went he touched
[22:38] that location the cancer he rebuked in
[22:39] the name of Jesus Christ the next day it
[22:42] vanished
[22:43] she's still alive today
[22:46] never had any more cancer
[22:51] that will make me stand and give praise
[22:53] amen all the rest of my life Hallelujah
[22:58] and if you need America ask God for a
[23:01] miracle praise God
[23:04] man
[23:06] can I be like Solomon thank you God I
[23:09] bless you God I thank you for all you've
[23:11] done you've done great things Hallelujah
[23:15] you're the only one that can heal cancer
[23:17] you're the only one I can say my soul
[23:19] Hallelujah
[23:21] you're the only one that can fill with
[23:24] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[23:25] [Applause]
[23:29] I think we got some more Solomons in
[23:30] here
[23:33] Hallelujah
[23:35] if you ever see a miracle you'll glorify
[23:38] God hallelujah
[23:43] because that's the very definition
[23:44] America is something God can do that we
[23:47] can't do praise God
[23:49] that's why we praise him that's why we
[23:52] sing Hallelujah that's why we give him
[23:54] our offerings Hallelujah makes you want
[23:56] to sing a ham by God's grace
[23:58] Paul said in the New Testament I wish
[24:00] men everywhere would lift up their hands
[24:04] pray without doubting
[24:07] Lord are you are you still in heaven now
[24:08] don't we all do that to yourself
[24:10] Lord are you sure you're there
[24:12] is anybody listening up there Paul said
[24:15] stand there lift up your hands don't
[24:17] doubt know that God hears your prayers
[24:19] amen
[24:21] sorry
[24:24] so I wish ever I will that's what I want
[24:26] everybody to do praise God
[24:29] stand there and give God praise know
[24:31] that he's close know that he'll never
[24:33] leave you nor forsake you no Romans 8 28
[24:37] that all things will work together for
[24:39] your good because you love God
[24:41] hallelujah
[24:42] [Applause]
[24:48] now when you're in despair you can do
[24:50] the same thing Solomon fell down in just
[24:52] total Adoration of the the Holy Ghost
[24:54] fill in the temple but Ezra saw all the
[24:58] sin that had taken over Israel and
[25:01] Jerusalem especially the people in
[25:02] Jerusalem
[25:03] so he falls down the Bible says and he
[25:06] spreads out his hands to God and you
[25:08] should read this chapter I read it this
[25:09] morning he he confesses his sins the
[25:12] sins of his fathers the sins of the
[25:14] people
[25:15] they were marrying the wrong people
[25:17] they're marrying Sinners they were doing
[25:18] child sacrifices they were working on
[25:21] the Sabbath day
[25:22] and the Bible said he ripped out his own
[25:24] hair
[25:25] I don't advise that I mean you can do
[25:28] whatever you want I mean God might lead
[25:29] you to that I guess
[25:31] I've never done that
[25:34] but I want you to see you know God God
[25:37] heard that worship
[25:40] and he blessed it
[25:42] he helped Ezra teach the people they
[25:44] already had the house right the house of
[25:46] God as we're taught the people and then
[25:47] Nehemiah come and builds the house
[25:49] Hallelujah it was a it was a it was a
[25:52] waiting game it was Lord be it was Lord
[25:55] give me patience I know you're going to
[25:56] finish this but Lord clean out our lives
[25:58] as well amen separate the people from
[26:01] their sins help us obey your commands
[26:03] help us to Worship in truth amen
[26:06] Hallelujah
[26:08] we got the Holy Spirit now help us to
[26:10] Worship in truth praise God
[26:13] let us marry the right people praise God
[26:16] let us honor every command of God
[26:19] hallelujah
[26:21] then we're gonna get somewhere with God
[26:25] number three giving God praise and
[26:27] thanks to Jesus name is an acceptable
[26:29] sacrifice
[26:30] think about that people say I just want
[26:32] to find God's will I just want to do
[26:34] something for God we'll stand here and
[26:35] give him praise
[26:37] and now you've done it
[26:40] Hallelujah
[26:42] tell Jesus thank you and you can walk
[26:44] out that door knowing I gave God a
[26:46] sacrifice tonight
[26:47] that's what the Bible says
[26:50] by him therefore let us offer the
[26:52] sacrifice of praise
[26:55] to God not just Sunday
[26:58] not just Wednesday night now
[27:00] continually what is this the fruit of
[27:03] your lips giving thanks to Jesus's name
[27:08] that's why I love leaving here after
[27:09] church I said praise God God help me to
[27:11] obey the word of God
[27:13] I know I'm the worst of our praise God
[27:15] Satan can't talk me out of it
[27:17] amen I know I praise God I know I thank
[27:20] God I'm not forgetting that I'm a
[27:22] worshiper praise God
[27:24] I'm the one God is seeking after the one
[27:27] who worships in spirit and in truth amen
[27:32] I did what God wanted me to do praise
[27:34] God
[27:38] like I told you you can lay down your
[27:40] head at night and say God thank you Lord
[27:42] I know I paid your word tonight praise
[27:44] God
[27:45] I know you're gonna wake me up in the
[27:46] morning and I can obey more of your word
[27:49] hallelujah praise God
[27:51] thank God here he says it again Peter
[27:54] you are not a dead stone you're a living
[27:57] Stone
[27:58] we see a lot of dead stones out there
[28:00] right but you're different you're not
[28:02] dead you're not getting kicked around
[28:03] pushed around you're part of a building
[28:07] you're part of a living building it's
[28:10] called the body of Christ Hallelujah
[28:13] I'm a part of a living breathing body a
[28:17] building that keeps building ah it's an
[28:20] awesome brother I got my piece in and
[28:22] then you come in and then Austin came in
[28:25] and we all got our pieces we're part of
[28:27] the living body of Jesus Christ on Earth
[28:30] amen
[28:32] Hallelujah so my suggestion is find your
[28:35] place Hallelujah
[28:37] don't leave here until you know your
[28:39] place in the body of Christ Hallelujah
[28:43] Gloria
[28:45] this also includes keeping your body
[28:47] separate from sin that's what we all
[28:49] have trouble as Sinners the Bible said
[28:51] present your body as a Living Sacrifice
[28:55] right holy so you can't live Unholy you
[28:59] can't do drugs
[29:00] you can't get drunk you can't have sex
[29:02] before marriage you can't be a
[29:04] homosexual the Bible's against all that
[29:06] that's Unholy you've got to present your
[29:09] body a Living Sacrifice holy and
[29:11] acceptable to God God only accepts you
[29:13] when you come through his word
[29:15] hallelujah
[29:17] yes and that's reasonable if you want to
[29:20] get to heaven you've got to obey the
[29:21] king of Heaven praise God
[29:24] if you want to be part of the the king
[29:26] of kings kingdom you've got to obey the
[29:28] laws of the king praise God
[29:30] Hallelujah
[29:32] don't be conformed don't be molded to
[29:34] this world don't be slowly Changed by
[29:36] what you see on Tick Tock I don't even
[29:38] have tick tock
[29:39] don't be molded by what you see on the
[29:41] news don't let the word of God mold you
[29:43] praise God
[29:46] that the word of God molds you and
[29:48] change you to be a Living Sacrifice
[29:53] and then you'll have a renewed mind
[29:54] you'll feel like like the brother said
[29:56] all that weight when he got saved all
[29:57] that weight come off of you it felt like
[29:59] a feather
[30:00] [Music]
[30:02] I was cleaning out you know art this may
[30:04] be silly illustration but I was cleaning
[30:07] out a broom you know kitchen brooming
[30:08] had all this hair on it and I tried to
[30:10] throw it down
[30:11] but the wind picked it up and I thought
[30:13] this is strange this big Bob of hair
[30:15] this handful of hair I thought wow the
[30:18] hair is flying like that I thought wow
[30:20] look at the power of how the wind lifts
[30:22] lifts something up praise God I'm
[30:25] expecting it to fall but God sends a win
[30:27] and it lifts it right up that's what the
[30:30] brother said that's like our sins right
[30:31] we cast them down but they all taken
[30:34] care of they all Fly Away praise God we
[30:36] become lives of feather we become brand
[30:39] new we're transformed praise God
[30:41] [Applause]
[30:42] just flies away
[30:46] send away
[30:48] see we have to keep our bodies separate
[30:50] from sin if we want to be a sacrifice
[30:53] fourth is sing songs
[30:56] and hymns Psalms and hymns and these
[30:59] help us be filled with the spirit
[31:01] Hallelujah Amino singing is very
[31:03] powerful
[31:05] if you want to experience God in your
[31:06] car in your home in your church
[31:10] at your job sing there
[31:13] sing that's what the Bible says be not
[31:16] drunk with wine where in his excess but
[31:19] be filled with the spirit speaking to
[31:22] yourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[31:23] spiritual songs singing and making melt
[31:25] in your heart to the Lord giving thanks
[31:27] always for all things oh I could say
[31:29] that again praise God
[31:30] because that's what I need that's what
[31:32] we need to give thanks in all things
[31:34] praise God no matter what comes my way

[31:41] not to complain not to have a pity party
[31:43] but Lord help me to give thanks in all
[31:46] things praise God
[31:47] unto the father in the name of our Lord
[31:49] Jesus Christ so the Psalms are of course
[31:52] David's Psalms and the other writers of
[31:53] the book of Psalms hymns are sacred
[31:55] songs according to the Greek they're
[31:57] songs of sacred praise
[31:59] to these really like some of the ones we
[32:01] sang tonight so ones we sang on Sunday

[32:06] done on Earth as it is in heaven

[32:46] I've danced around this church many
[32:47] times this last year here hallelujah
[32:50] because I didn't realize all the freedom
[32:52] we had to dance praise God till this
[32:54] year

[32:58] his might

[33:13] but he was using all of his might to
[33:16] give God praise Hallelujah
[33:20] Hallelujah
[33:23] he was leaping and dancing
[33:26] before the Lord
[33:28] see church that's what we've got to
[33:30] realize when we come here you're not

[33:33] the Musicians you're clapping and
[33:35] singing to Jesus Christ
[33:38] I'm not really preaching for you I'm

[34:40] David even told Macau
[34:43] she criticized him to say oh you were so
[34:45] she used sarcasm oh you were So Glorious
[34:48] today
[34:49] he said it was before God
[34:52] and if you didn't like that I'm going to
[34:55] play before the Lord again
[34:57] if you don't like the first round wait
[34:59] till round two comes

[35:32] praise God
[35:33] that's what the Bible said
[35:35] he lead with all of his might and the
[35:38] woman has said uh she never had a child

[35:44] to show God his thanks
[35:46] oh let's give God thanks tonight praise

[46:53] before you and sing and imagine the
[46:55] mountains
[46:56] we just saw them over there in
[46:57] Pennsylvania a few weeks ago I didn't
[46:58] know they were singing to me actually I
[47:00] should have I should have listened a
[47:01] little harder there they were singing
[47:02] the whole time I was driving up those
[47:04] mountains on the curves boy I thought I
[47:05] was gonna fall off but the whole time
[47:07] they were singing praise God and all
[47:09] those trees were clapping their hands
[47:11] saying God is with you God's going to
[47:13] keep his word if God raised us up if God
[47:16] placed this mountain here hallelujah
[47:17] then he knows everything and he knows
[47:19] all the mountains in your life praise
[47:20] God hallelujah hallelujah he knows
[47:23] you're a tree of righteousness the Bible
[47:25] says
[47:26] ah Hallelujah thank God
[47:29] and saying amen is a part of church too
[47:33] in Deuteronomy 27 God had Moses given
[47:36] the law and he gave blessings and curses
[47:39] he also did in the days of Joshua and
[47:41] after every blessing the people said
[47:43] amen that means so shall so shall be so
[47:47] be it in other words truly barely that's
[47:49] right
[47:51] and so cursed be he that setteth his
[47:52] light by his father-in-law that means
[47:54] the disrespect
[47:56] to make light of a father mother and all
[47:58] the people shall Say Amen
[48:00] so be it
[48:01] curse of me he that removes his
[48:03] neighbor's Landmark you start to see on
[48:04] property
[48:05] and all the people shall say
[48:07] Thou shalt not steal I shall not steal
[48:11] I'll say amen hallelujah
[48:14] when people speak in tongues
[48:16] and they don't interpret Paul says how
[48:18] are people going to bless God
[48:21] in the occupying the room and the
[48:22] unlearned how should they say Amen when
[48:24] you're giving thanks for unknown tongues
[48:26] because they don't understand what
[48:28] you're saying
[48:29] see God wants every part of the service
[48:31] so the people can say Amen
[48:33] man like those songs on Sunday Naomi and
[48:35] I were talking we were talking we all
[48:37] said amen to those songs brother
[48:39] right hopefully you're saying Amen to
[48:41] this sermon
[48:43] Amen to the songs Amen to the greetings
[48:45] Amen to the testimonies praise God
[48:48] wants you to say Amen to his word that's
[48:51] what he wants you to do praise God
[48:54] Glory
[48:55] and there's times of fast don't eat and
[48:57] then there's time to feast
[49:02] Ezra going back to azer before he
[49:03] confesses sins in chapter 9 in chapter
[49:05] eight he's like I don't even know how
[49:07] we're going to get to Jerusalem
[49:09] so he said we got to have a fast nobody
[49:10] eat and we're going to get on our faces
[49:12] we're going to afflict ourselves before
[49:13] God I'm not eating breakfast I'm not
[49:15] eating lunch I'm not eating supper until
[49:17] God shows us how we're going to get our
[49:19] kids healthy how we're going to get to
[49:20] Jerusalem with all of our kids safe
[49:22] that's what the Bible says I Proclaim to
[49:25] fast before God to seek him a right way
[49:27] for us and for our little ones and for
[49:29] all of our substance when I didn't have
[49:31] a job I fasted and God gave me the job I
[49:34] got now
[49:35] what I didn't know about supposed to
[49:37] preach I fasted and God look at it look
[49:39] at me now I'm preach still preaching all
[49:40] these years 19 years later
[49:42] you got it fast praise God if you want
[49:45] to know the way praise God if you want
[49:46] to know Jesus he is the word he is the
[49:49] truth he is the Lord and if you want to
[49:51] know the word you gotta fast Hallelujah
[49:54] at least one time
[49:57] I'd say more than that
[49:59] but then Jesus says when you make a
[50:01] feast Saints call the poor the maim the
[50:03] lame and the blind now that's hard for
[50:05] us in this day and age
[50:06] that's why we got to give alms to people
[50:08] that's why we got to Give in secret
[50:10] praise God
[50:11] because everybody around me is wealthy
[50:14] just like we're we're Americans we're
[50:15] all have a certain level of wealth
[50:17] right I don't have to bite them
[50:19] right but I can't yeah I got my bands
[50:22] almost filled up what so what can I do I
[50:24] can give out alms praise God
[50:26] but Jesus said there's nothing wrong
[50:28] with having a feast
[50:29] now that's why I like I like some of the
[50:31] churches how they have these Feasts
[50:33] but they shouldn't brag about it
[50:35] you shouldn't know what your right hand
[50:37] your left hand should know what your
[50:38] right hand is doing
[50:40] right so may God give us wisdom praise
[50:42] God
[50:43] see that that's what we need there's
[50:44] nothing wrong with having a feast Jesus
[50:46] was a part of all the feasts of Israel
[50:48] and the Feast of Pentecost was a feast
[50:50] of rejoicing
[50:52] so was the Feast of trumpets and
[50:54] Tabernacles and Jesus stood up on
[50:56] Tabernacles and said If any man thirst
[50:59] let him come unto me praise God
[51:01] he was right there amongst the feasts
[51:03] and praise God
[51:05] nothing wrong with feasting just honor
[51:07] God in your Feasts
[51:11] anybody ready for a Thanksgiving meal
[51:13] this is
[51:15] no pressure honey
[51:18] there's many of these I mean I could put
[51:20] I couldn't put a number on there so many
[51:21] more
[51:22] another way to worship is to receive the
[51:25] word
[51:26] gladly in other words be happy for the
[51:29] sermon that you heard
[51:31] if it's if it's the Bible now if it's
[51:33] not the Bible you don't have to be happy
[51:34] about it
[51:35] but if I'm preaching you the Bible you
[51:37] ought to leave here happy
[51:39] because it's God's word
[51:41] and I'm making it easy for you don't
[51:43] have to turn your bible really you can
[51:44] just look off the screen here
[51:46] right try to make it as convenient as to
[51:49] me it's to redeem the time praise God
[51:51] because on Sunday nights that's when
[51:52] we'll go through the Bibles right Sunday
[51:54] nights we'll all turn to the Bible if I
[51:55] want to conserve my time while I'm here
[51:57] by God's grace
[51:59] so God wants you to receive the word
[52:01] with happiness give prayers wash each
[52:03] other's feet in communion take the bread
[52:05] and the wine
[52:06] ask for Doctrine ask doctrinal questions
[52:10] remember the Bible said the women aren't
[52:11] supposed to ask them that that was the
[52:13] case where they were challenging the
[52:14] preachers
[52:15] he said ask your husbands at home women
[52:17] because they had some contentious women
[52:19] in Corinth
[52:20] right
[52:22] so he said don't ask him in public ask
[52:24] him in private
[52:26] but that don't apply to us we're Holy
[52:27] Ghost filled Saints and a holy ghost
[52:29] woman wouldn't do that to a holy ghost
[52:30] preacher
[52:32] and none of you have either so God bless
[52:35] you I'm glad to be your pastor
[52:39] but we should want fellowship with
[52:40] everybody and we should gather more
[52:43] see that day approaching
[52:45] don't come to lest Church come to more
[52:47] Church
[52:49] then you know you're serving God
[52:52] the Bible said and they that gladly
[52:54] received Peter's word he preached were
[52:55] baptized if you haven't I forgot to put
[52:57] that one there get baptized if I've been
[52:59] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:02] not fathers and Holy Ghost because
[53:03] that's the title there's one name to the
[53:05] father son only goes that's the name of
[53:07] the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:09] that's a Catholic dogma
[53:11] the same day we're adding them three
[53:13] thousand Souls what a Revival well you
[53:15] had 14 or we had 17 brother they had 3
[53:17] 000.
[53:19] and they continue to steadfastly in the
[53:21] apostles Doctrine and failures in other
[53:23] words they said teach me more teach me
[53:25] more of the word show me how to live a
[53:26] Christian Life let's Fellowship let's
[53:28] get together let's have a picnic praise
[53:30] God
[53:32] and the breaking the bread let's have
[53:34] communion and let's pray together praise
[53:36] God
[53:39] now just to summarize this just to give
[53:41] I want to do this for the Junction City
[53:43] Saints tomorrow night
[53:45] so your body's allowed to dance or be
[53:47] still whatever God leads you to do
[53:49] no pressure just let God pressure you
[53:53] or let God push you I'll say like that
[53:55] or let God encourage you
[53:58] yeah
[53:59] right God might want you to stand or he
[54:02] might want you to kneel or he might want
[54:03] you to bow
[54:04] whatever you feel like to do I'm not the
[54:07] Holy Ghost
[54:08] God's holy ghost
[54:10] he's going to tell you what to do
[54:12] these are all expressions of worship you
[54:14] might leap like I did
[54:16] you might have hands up or hands down
[54:19] you might be playing instruments
[54:23] or you might not be
[54:24] you might be tapping your feet like
[54:25] brother now brother bran was a prophet
[54:27] he died in 1965 but he prophesied
[54:29] numerous things in in advance and they
[54:32] came to pass
[54:33] he would tell people they're healed
[54:34] years before they were healed one time
[54:37] he told a woman thus say the Lord you
[54:38] have a baby she waited 10 years and she
[54:40] had the baby
[54:41] 10 years is no joke
[54:44] to wait the whole year all nine years
[54:46] like I said am I gonna have a baby or he
[54:47] said those other they're coming to pass
[54:49] God's word will never return void amen
[54:52] God's word will always be true praise
[54:54] God
[54:56] and he left us he left us instructions
[54:58] for the Bible Hallelujah
[55:01] brother says stomp your feet tap your
[55:03] feet of course I can go along with the
[55:04] symbols and the timber right
[55:06] fasting or you can Feast you can clap
[55:09] you can physically be gathered with the
[55:10] Saints you can take communion and be
[55:12] baptized now who wants to worship praise
[55:14] God
[55:17] doing that the last 23 years
[55:19] it's the greatest decision I ever made
[55:21] in my life Hallelujah I'm going to keep
[55:23] doing it for the next 23 praise God
[55:25] I gotta saved in the year 2000 so it's
[55:27] easy for me to calculate how many years
[55:28] I've been saved
[55:29] what can your voice do can be loud or
[55:31] can be quiet
[55:33] like you Lord
[55:36] you're not the only one
[55:37] there's more message Believers than just
[55:39] Akron
[55:40] I feel like we're the only ones
[55:42] they're down there in Kentucky aren't
[55:44] they
[55:45] they're down there in Delaware
[55:48] hallelujah or Navarre Navarre that's
[55:50] where that's your own Navarre
[55:52] I drive by Delaware
[55:54] singing you might sing you might praise
[55:56] you might thanks you might give a
[55:57] blessings you might magnify God you
[55:59] might shout you might speak in tongues
[56:01] of men or Angels Hallelujah
[56:03] you might say Amen you might ask to
[56:05] learn Doctrine you might uh ask for a
[56:07] fellowship with the Saints you might
[56:08] laugh for Joy like David did
[56:11] but all these are ways God loves to be
[56:13] worshiped
[56:15] I just proved it to you by the Bible
[56:17] praise God what more proof could we want
[56:19] praise God
[56:20] the Bible is good enough for me the
[56:22] b-i-b-l-e yes that's the book for me
[56:25] I stand upon the word of God
[56:28] the b-i-v-l-e
[56:30] Hallelujah
[56:34] now it's 8 15 already now how are we
[56:36] gonna how are we going to close this
[56:37] service here
[56:39] we're looking back what's going to
[56:40] happen here
[56:44] I think uh
[56:47] you know with music I'm just gonna I'm
[56:49] just gonna go from memory okay I studied
[56:51] three hours a day so I'm just gonna
[56:52] trust the Holy Spirit
[56:54] that first part was a lot longer than I
[56:56] thought
[56:56] let me set a timer for 15 minutes let me
[56:58] just do 15 minutes on this here now
[57:00] music
[57:02] for many years it wasn't a big issue
[57:05] but it's become a big issue because
[57:07] Satan has pressed his way into a lot of
[57:08] churches
[57:10] now we just had another witness that
[57:12] said they enjoy our worship right
[57:15] almost every Preacher Brother just
[57:17] before God almost every preacher that
[57:19] comes says that same thing yeah I just
[57:21] stand back and say well it's all Jesus
[57:24] we just love Jesus
[57:26] no one here deserves praise I mean you
[57:29] look nice but you
[57:31] a handsome guy but you know
[57:33] Jesus gives all the praise
[57:36] and then I fail every day you fail every
[57:39] day we know we're not worthy of any
[57:40] praise
[57:41] but there's someone who helps us
[57:43] overcome every day too
[57:46] and that's Jesus Hallelujah
[57:49] Glory
[57:53] but just a pair of just a just a
[57:55] shortness rock and roll is seeping its
[57:58] way into churches
[58:00] now if the churches are playing rock and
[58:02] roll they're already spiritually
[58:03] rebelling against the Holy Spirit
[58:06] that means their arms rays are in vain
[58:08] God doesn't receive it
[58:10] because the rock and roll spirit is a
[58:13] sexual spirit
[58:15] what does rock and roll mean it means
[58:16] sexual immorality we're between
[58:19] man and a woman I guess well I don't
[58:21] know what they do today but people do
[58:22] whatever they filthy filthies things
[58:25] today
[58:26] but it's it's basically fornication
[58:30] right two people knowing each other
[58:31] carnally the Bible says
[58:34] well once rock and roll gets in
[58:37] you they never get it out
[58:40] and then it it's the Bible says like
[58:42] leaven or Yeast it's going to make
[58:44] everything in the dough blow up
[58:48] it's going to make the problems worse
[58:54] and brother Brandon had a vision of this
[58:55] now think of this in 1965 brother brand
[58:58] had a vision I see I see the Church of
[59:00] America dancing to rock and roll
[59:03] and Church Rock and Roll didn't get in
[59:05] the churches to like the late 90s
[59:08] early 2000s how do I know because I was
[59:10] raised in charges I was raised in the
[59:12] church
[59:13] it didn't get in there until the late
[59:15] 1990s
[59:16] 30 over 35 years after brother Branham
[59:20] died
[59:22] God's word does not return voids Saints
[59:24] amen you can hang your soul on thus save
[59:28] the Lord hallelujah
[59:33] Hallelujah
[59:35] so that's what we got to watch out for
[59:37] me we have to make sure rock and roll
[59:38] doesn't get in our church and by God's
[59:40] grace we're doing a good job
[59:42] but we just want to review I just want
[59:44] to rehearse a few of these things
[59:45] because there's all my heart
[59:48] the sin of rock and roll is that the
[59:51] beats are sexually stimulating
[59:54] and if you're not sure about that go
[59:56] watch when Elvis first sang on Ed
[59:58] Sullivan go watch it
[1:00:00] the girls are shaking like they're going
[1:00:01] crazy and then a couple of concerts
[1:00:03] later they're throwing their
[1:00:04] undergarments up there on stage
[1:00:08] just the beat
[1:00:10] the Rhythm
[1:00:15] that will cause people to go sexually
[1:00:17] immoral just the beat
[1:00:19] right
[1:00:21] they didn't know that back then the
[1:00:23] Sinners didn't know that but God's
[1:00:24] Prophet knew that
[1:00:26] Hallelujah why because God chose the
[1:00:28] prophets the mysteries of God hallelujah
[1:00:32] God said I'll do nothing except I'll
[1:00:35] show my secret to my servants the
[1:00:37] prophets Hallelujah
[1:00:39] oh this is Rich amen glory
[1:00:44] because it was foretold and we got it on
[1:00:46] tape from 1965 and then the rock and
[1:00:48] roll didn't start to around 2000 35
[1:00:50] years in advance thus say the Lord can
[1:00:53] never fail
[1:00:54] Hallelujah
[1:00:56] I know where we're standing we're not
[1:00:58] standing on a Creed we're not standing
[1:00:59] on a denomination like Baptist or
[1:01:01] Methodist or Lutheran we're not standing
[1:01:03] on that we're standing on the true
[1:01:04] interpretation of God's holy word we're
[1:01:07] standing on the Living God hallelujah
[1:01:12] Glory
[1:01:16] [Applause]
[1:01:18] and other men predicted rock and roll
[1:01:20] would take over none
[1:01:22] because none of them are prophets but
[1:01:24] God sent us a prophet Hallelujah
[1:01:27] as he promised in the Bible
[1:01:29] Malachi four five and six right
[1:01:31] Hallelujah Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 30.
[1:01:35] Hallelujah
[1:01:36] God prophesied of it he did it it's
[1:01:39] finished praise God thank God Hallelujah
[1:01:42] I just want to encourage you now there
[1:01:44] there were some foreshadowing so the
[1:01:46] origin of rock and roll was of course
[1:01:48] Satan
[1:01:49] right Satan was the worship leader in
[1:01:51] heaven according to Ezekiel 28.
[1:01:54] but then
[1:01:56] you know when when when Israel made the
[1:01:58] golden calf they had a noise of war and
[1:02:01] isn't that what rock and roll sounds
[1:02:02] like
[1:02:03] like I used to listen to Metallica right
[1:02:05] it was like
[1:02:08] man it's growing the war out here or
[1:02:10] something like that someone's gonna die
[1:02:12] today
[1:02:13] yeah we played before the football games
[1:02:14] like I'm gonna kill you
[1:02:19] it's a devil
[1:02:20] it's the devil
[1:02:24] it's the devil well this I mean there
[1:02:27] was origins of this even in the Old
[1:02:28] Testament
[1:02:30] any music that wasn't worse than God was
[1:02:32] Antichrist
[1:02:34] was from hell
[1:02:37] the Bible said it caused them to go
[1:02:38] naked
[1:02:41] so look at those women out there with
[1:02:43] bikinis on the beach they're practically
[1:02:44] naked they're full of demons
[1:02:47] and men that will wear
[1:02:50] this show disgusting body parts and show
[1:02:52] their body parts like that they got
[1:02:53] demons too
[1:02:56] they both got demons
[1:02:57] halleluia
[1:03:00] because they listen to rock and roll and
[1:03:01] rap and R B and Country and all it's all
[1:03:04] from hell
[1:03:06] because it worships man it worships
[1:03:09] Satan it worships whiskey bottles
[1:03:12] we go out to the Mexican restaurant I
[1:03:14] got this guy's thinking about whiskey
[1:03:15] like a hundred like every song is about
[1:03:16] whiskey like
[1:03:17] why do you worship alcohol
[1:03:20] the Bible said he'll come back and bite
[1:03:21] you like a snake
[1:03:23] in the end
[1:03:24] look at these people we got old family
[1:03:26] members they drink so much their liver's
[1:03:29] giving out on them and they look like
[1:03:30] they're orange almost
[1:03:32] I wonder if the orange man Trump drinks
[1:03:34] alcohol I don't know
[1:03:35] he sure looks Orange
[1:03:37] may God save his Souls my prayer
[1:03:40] all I know is when you drink alcohol
[1:03:42] your liver makes your skin look colors
[1:03:46] and what kind of dance did herodius's
[1:03:48] daughter do to make Herod say I'll give
[1:03:50] you half of my income
[1:03:52] now it's just a general statement you
[1:03:54] know I don't think they would actually
[1:03:56] give her half of the Kingdom
[1:03:58] but it's a statement like you've really
[1:03:59] pleased me what kind of dance would this
[1:04:01] girl do
[1:04:03] sexual how to be sexual right so what
[1:04:05] that's a pre-figure of rock and roll is
[1:04:06] not new
[1:04:08] any dance that's sexy produces sexual
[1:04:11] seduction is rock and roll
[1:04:15] it's playing
[1:04:16] they admit it all these guys admit it
[1:04:18] they don't have to you know you have to
[1:04:20] look very hard to find that
[1:04:21] this is a 1957.
[1:04:24] well the man said a lot of preachers try
[1:04:26] to justify Elvis Presley which is
[1:04:27] nothing in the world but a modern Judas
[1:04:28] is scared see he used to sing for God
[1:04:31] but then he sold out God's church and he
[1:04:33] went and sang For the Devil
[1:04:35] and look how he died he died on a toilet
[1:04:38] overdosed on drugs reading a book about
[1:04:40] sexual Magic
[1:04:42] a demon possession that's how he died
[1:04:45] but he could have stayed in the church
[1:04:46] and he could have been saved
[1:04:48] where did rock and roll get him
[1:04:50] what was he 40 40 37 or 42 remember
[1:04:54] brother
[1:04:56] young 40s
[1:04:58] that that's the poster boy the king of
[1:05:00] rock who wants to be like the king of
[1:05:02] rock
[1:05:03] and die on a toilet
[1:05:08] and church that rock and roll is trying
[1:05:09] to get in here we got to keep the rock
[1:05:11] and roll out
[1:05:12] it's every church not just us every
[1:05:14] Church
[1:05:17] well Graham said Judas got 30 pieces of
[1:05:19] silver Elvis Presley got a million
[1:05:21] dollars in a fleet of Cadillacs but he
[1:05:22] sold out same thing Whitney Houston did
[1:05:24] same thing Beyonce did they all started
[1:05:26] in church and they sold out their gifts
[1:05:28] to worship Satan
[1:05:29] you can see it there's videos Beyonce
[1:05:31] she's like I don't have power to sing
[1:05:33] but when that Spirit comes on me now she
[1:05:35] can sing
[1:05:36] and you can see her face it looks like a
[1:05:38] demon and then she starts dancing like a
[1:05:39] devil
[1:05:40] it's satanic
[1:05:43] filled with demonic Powers but thank God
[1:05:45] we're the opposite we're filled with the
[1:05:46] Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise God I
[1:05:49] raise my hands I can get on my knees I
[1:05:52] can leap for Jesus I can praise God I
[1:05:54] can sing his Praises I can wave my hands
[1:05:56] I'm filled with God's spirit Hallelujah
[1:06:00] I can be still and know that he's God
[1:06:02] here tonight
[1:06:04] whatever God leads me to do
[1:06:07] same thing for you
[1:06:10] Bill Graham said in 1957 I don't pull
[1:06:12] any punches on it
[1:06:13] he's a modern Judas
[1:06:16] he Elvis Presley said yeah I trust God
[1:06:18] for all my success how would a living
[1:06:20] holy God ever give success to vulgarity
[1:06:24] Elvis is on tape bragging about all the
[1:06:27] sexual adulteries he has
[1:06:30] like when he when he whenever he travels
[1:06:32] they would find prostitutes and he'd
[1:06:34] just do all kinds of filthiness and oh
[1:06:36] he sings Good gospel songs he's an
[1:06:38] imposter
[1:06:40] he's an impersonator
[1:06:43] right he's a pretender
[1:06:46] right
[1:06:50] he said I don't have any apology at all
[1:06:52] calling a guy like that old dirty filthy
[1:06:54] rock and roll and I was watching that
[1:06:57] video he was just singing that what song
[1:06:58] was saying the Hound Dog song we
[1:07:00] listened to that we said that's not that
[1:07:01] bad it was totally from hell
[1:07:04] he's telling girls you aren't anything
[1:07:06] but a hound dog
[1:07:08] how would that go over today
[1:07:10] uh yeah you want to go on a date you
[1:07:12] little hound dog I mean what
[1:07:14] what else you got I mean
[1:07:16] and people I mean they're
[1:07:19] they're shaking they're screaming
[1:07:21] he's basically degrading them
[1:07:24] and they fall in love with him
[1:07:26] and they lose their morals to him
[1:07:28] and he could never get it back
[1:07:30] now they can repent and get saved but
[1:07:32] they'll never get their integrity back
[1:07:34] that moment
[1:07:35] they can be saved or they'll repent
[1:07:38] noticeably says if you believe me to be
[1:07:40] God's Prophet remember there's an
[1:07:42] incarnate devil absolutely
[1:07:46] yeah he's pulled the devil
[1:07:49] now here's the vision brother brothers
[1:07:51] saw a vision and I'm going to skip ahead
[1:07:53] brother he's first sees a vision of the
[1:07:55] the true worshipers called the Jesus
[1:07:57] called them his bride in John chapter
[1:07:59] three
[1:08:00] they're walking in Step pretty young
[1:08:03] they got the stride of woman they're
[1:08:04] very gracefully ladylike that's the way
[1:08:06] she was walking
[1:08:08] so he first saw the True Believers walk
[1:08:10] really beautifully and then the he said
[1:08:12] the church
[1:08:13] of United States
[1:08:16] he said was led by a witch
[1:08:19] how many of these women singers are
[1:08:20] witches
[1:08:22] a lot of them are Tom Brady said his
[1:08:24] ex-wife was a witch did you know that
[1:08:27] he said his wife told him which years
[1:08:29] he'd win the Super Bowl and which ones
[1:08:31] he wouldn't
[1:08:32] and she trained him to set up altars in
[1:08:34] his locker to worship these demon
[1:08:36] spirits
[1:08:38] yeah
[1:08:39] yeah he won seven Super Bowls but he's
[1:08:41] possessed with demons probably
[1:08:43] his ex-wife certainly is
[1:08:45] and they just admit it right there I
[1:08:46] mean they admit it
[1:08:50] he said
[1:08:52] he said there were March into the time
[1:08:54] of twist and rock and roll
[1:08:56] he said they were holding like a a
[1:08:58] newspaper a gray newspaper
[1:09:02] he said holding in front of them like a
[1:09:04] hula skirt
[1:09:06] and completely nude from the waist up
[1:09:10] right twisting carrying on that music
[1:09:12] walking up and said that is the church
[1:09:15] and brothers he said I almost fainted he
[1:09:17] saw the he saw the first church go he
[1:09:19] said praise God and then he saw the
[1:09:20] American Church
[1:09:22] and then he said I won't say that if
[1:09:23] that's what is trying to be presented to
[1:09:25] Christ as a bride that kind of a immoral
[1:09:28] rock and roll
[1:09:29] uh naked Church of all the efforts and
[1:09:32] things I put forth to try to bring forth
[1:09:34] a bride for Christ a vulgar dirty filthy
[1:09:36] looking prostitute like that the bride
[1:09:37] of Christ it made me sick of my heart
[1:09:42] then he says it again she was twisting
[1:09:44] rocking moving herself one side the
[1:09:46] other like a modern dancers they had
[1:09:48] today
[1:09:49] using yourself in an immoral act so
[1:09:52] she's dancing sexy
[1:09:54] little man said I'm not responsible for
[1:09:56] things these things I can only say what
[1:09:58] I've seen and God is my judge but that
[1:09:59] was a church from the USA
[1:10:01] later he says this is thus saith the
[1:10:03] Lord and look it's come to pass
[1:10:06] look at Rock and rolls in every Big
[1:10:08] Church
[1:10:10] no wonder people don't want to come here
[1:10:11] we don't have rock and roll well good
[1:10:14] I don't want rock and roll
[1:10:16] I don't want prostitution here
[1:10:19] I want Holiness here praise God
[1:10:21] I want men that are true to their wives
[1:10:23] Hallelujah I want women that are true to
[1:10:26] their husbands praise God Like Jesus
[1:10:28] said one man one woman until death
[1:10:30] Hallelujah
[1:10:31] that's what Jesus said praise God not a
[1:10:33] bunch of like the Bible says
[1:10:35] whoremongers it's the Bible word
[1:10:38] and then he said when they passed by
[1:10:40] look he had to look in the vision and
[1:10:41] they didn't have any back covering on
[1:10:42] their back
[1:10:44] he said it almost felt faint and sickly
[1:10:48] but then God said the bride will come
[1:10:50] into preview again
[1:10:52] and here the bride came behind the very
[1:10:53] same looking bride that passed at the
[1:10:55] beginning lovely ladylike
[1:10:57] holy
[1:10:58] my heart jumped for joy to know that
[1:11:02] there will be a bride and she'll be made
[1:11:04] of the same thing clothed in the same
[1:11:06] thing the one that was at the beginning
[1:11:08] she used to be called in other words the
[1:11:10] church in our day is going to be just
[1:11:12] like the book of Acts Church hallelujah
[1:11:15] amen hallelujah
[1:11:18] hahaha
[1:11:19] this Bible is going to live again
[1:11:21] Hallelujah
[1:11:23] God's going to restore the church
[1:11:25] Hallelujah
[1:11:27] Elias shall Truly Come and restore all
[1:11:30] things Matthew 17 11 says
[1:11:34] and I know that's the truth Saints if
[1:11:36] that isn't true than every Vision I've
[1:11:38] ever had in the back has been wrong
[1:11:41] like the vision of the woman having a
[1:11:43] baby 10 years later
[1:11:44] all divisions of all the sick people
[1:11:46] getting well they were all true
[1:11:48] because that's what God does God God
[1:11:50] doesn't lie Hallelujah
[1:11:54] and anyone knows that one thing he's
[1:11:56] ever told us but was the truth it come
[1:11:57] to pass can you see then the filthiness
[1:11:59] of the modern Church calling herself a
[1:12:01] church
[1:12:02] there's my 15 minutes
[1:12:06] a church some of the some of the debates
[1:12:07] say can we have drums or not well it all
[1:12:10] depends how you use them
[1:12:12] drums can either be holy or they can be
[1:12:14] Unholy depending how hard you bang on
[1:12:16] them
[1:12:17] and what kind of Beats you do with them
[1:12:19] too
[1:12:21] because that's all tambourine is it's
[1:12:23] just like a it's a handheld drum
[1:12:25] right
[1:12:28] didn't Miriam have a drum in her hand
[1:12:33] Glory it's a percussion instrument right
[1:12:37] and God said praise me with percussion
[1:12:40] praise me with loud symbols
[1:12:43] Hallelujah so there's a place for loud
[1:12:45] worship
[1:12:47] where people dance
[1:12:50] right people might leap around the
[1:12:52] church
[1:12:55] it might be fanatics but they love God
[1:12:59] they're God's Fanatics Hallelujah
[1:13:04] brother Brian was talking about our text
[1:13:06] we read at the beginning the prophet
[1:13:07] Elias I'm sorry uh Elisha he said they
[1:13:11] got to play in the music now listen if
[1:13:13] you can't be the prophet you can be one
[1:13:14] of the instruments
[1:13:16] how many know you're not a prophet
[1:13:18] good every every hand should be up I'm
[1:13:20] not I'm not I'm not looking
[1:13:23] right if you can't be the prophet be one
[1:13:25] of the instruments
[1:13:26] that plays the music to bring the spirit
[1:13:28] down to the prophet and brother said
[1:13:31] today the prophet is the Holy Ghost
[1:13:34] now that can be through your gift of
[1:13:35] Prophecy a gift of a dream
[1:13:37] speaking the word speaking to mountains
[1:13:40] and prophecy couldn't do any of that
[1:13:42] praise God
[1:13:43] he said you know I mean you know what I
[1:13:45] mean they begin to play they begin to
[1:13:47] beat the drums and play the instruments
[1:13:52] see drums aren't bad things as long as
[1:13:54] you're using the right way praise God
[1:13:58] these days God might raise us a little
[1:13:59] drummer up out of those little girls out
[1:14:01] there
[1:14:03] we got just enough room about right here
[1:14:06] for a drum
[1:14:08] I'll just try not to hit him when I'm
[1:14:09] dancing around
[1:14:11] trying to trip over the drums
[1:14:14] see there's a holy way to beat the drums
[1:14:18] remember Elijah said bring me a
[1:14:20] menstrual Minister was a player
[1:14:21] stringing bring me music if we want the
[1:14:23] spirit of God let's worship God
[1:14:28] here's another holy way brother I was
[1:14:29] talking about oh
[1:14:31] yeah brother I have said what we need
[1:14:34] today is the prophet arrives on the
[1:14:35] scene with thus say the Lord that was
[1:14:36] him and strip those things to the bottom
[1:14:38] and say that they become a stink the
[1:14:40] church denominations our dominations has
[1:14:43] grown our churches are big and they're
[1:14:44] finer than they ever was we'd be a lot
[1:14:46] better off with a tin pan standing on
[1:14:49] the Alley again with the guitar out
[1:14:51] there beating a drum or something other
[1:14:53] with the real Pentecostal fire in our
[1:14:57] souls Hallelujah
[1:14:59] ah I feel good amen
[1:15:03] I'd rather have freedom I'd Rather Have
[1:15:05] Jesus amen
[1:15:07] in a big church and fancy views and
[1:15:10] million dollar organ I'd Rather Have
[1:15:12] Jesus hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:17] Glory
[1:15:19] thank God
[1:15:24] just a guitar
[1:15:25] all we had was a guitar and a tambourine
[1:15:28] we've been doing better praise God thank
[1:15:30] you Jesus I love you Jesus hallelujah
[1:15:34] we're better off amen
[1:15:36] that was filthy rock and roll
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:41] Hallelujah
[1:15:43] remember we're that original Church
[1:15:46] we're not the church United States we're
[1:15:49] the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:53] we might live in the United States but
[1:15:55] we're really from Heaven Hallelujah
[1:16:02] boy can I ever close
[1:16:05] but ma'am also said Jesus is the great
[1:16:07] composer and in his Symphony he said
[1:16:10] there's heart there's violin there's
[1:16:11] Bass
[1:16:13] there's trumpets there's drums
[1:16:17] so now we got three quotes saying drums
[1:16:19] are okay
[1:16:20] but people come out and say no drums I'm
[1:16:24] sorry you can't take my Liberty from me
[1:16:28] if I remember Galatians chapter 5. verse
[1:16:30] one he put it
[1:16:33] up the Bible says
[1:16:35] and sister Karen shared this verse
[1:16:37] remember the Republic
[1:16:37] right before we started dancing remember
[1:16:39] that
[1:16:40] she said brother Jesse I always remember
[1:16:41] Galatians 5 verse one you know how she's
[1:16:43] so old she's so sweet
[1:16:45] about Jesse he reads Galatians 5 verse
[1:16:48] one that's right before he started
[1:16:49] dancing
[1:16:50] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:16:53] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[1:16:56] not entangled again with the Yoke of
[1:16:58] bondage
[1:17:00] that's why I'm preaching it to the uh
[1:17:01] the former Amish tomorrow
[1:17:04] I don't want the the devil to get them
[1:17:06] back into bondage we can't sing We got
[1:17:08] to be scared of the preacher all the
[1:17:09] time you ought to fear God but then you
[1:17:11] ought to rejoice in God hallelujah
[1:17:13] yo thank God when he hears your prayers
[1:17:15] you ought to give up you have a voice of
[1:17:17] Triumph when God answers your prayers
[1:17:19] Hallelujah you got to clap and sing and
[1:17:21] give God praise because God is so
[1:17:23] faithful praise God
[1:17:25] [Applause]
[1:17:27] the whole things together in a rhythm so
[1:17:30] there is a holy beat
[1:17:32] and there's an Unholy beat
[1:17:34] Hallelujah I'm glad we got the Holy One
[1:17:37] Hallelujah
[1:17:40] you want to hear all the Unholy one just
[1:17:42] put on Michael Jackson
[1:17:46] whatever the guys are today Jay-Z or
[1:17:49] Kanye whatever I don't know the guys who
[1:17:50] knows
[1:17:51] T.I 50 Cent and everything
[1:17:54] he's worth about 50 cents his mer his
[1:17:58] music ain't worth 50 cents
[1:18:01] it needs to be burnt and sent back to
[1:18:03] hell that's where he needs to go and he
[1:18:04] needs to repent and get saved
[1:18:07] now brother man does warn us though
[1:18:08] there's a devilish way to beat drumsy
[1:18:12] he says talking about worldly dances
[1:18:13] like nightclubs right I don't believe
[1:18:15] you would go up now surely not but if
[1:18:16] you used to go to dance clubs they'd
[1:18:18] play up the hop up music now that was
[1:18:21] 1954 talk
[1:18:23] what they call it sick music now or
[1:18:25] whatever they got that's sick or that's
[1:18:27] fire fire music I don't know I don't
[1:18:29] know I'm 42 I don't know a lingo
[1:18:31] and beat the bands and beat the drums
[1:18:33] and every kind of thing there was about
[1:18:35] it and women run out there half naked
[1:18:37] everything else and dance on the floors
[1:18:38] get you in the spirit of dance well you
[1:18:40] get in the spirit of it it's a spirit of
[1:18:42] the devil
[1:18:44] glad you said amen because it's the
[1:18:46] truth
[1:18:47] I just for Artie privacy by the Bible we
[1:18:49] don't need to read the Bible again
[1:18:49] there's other examples too so there's a
[1:18:52] good drums bad drums good dance bad
[1:18:55] dance I want the good stuff just give me
[1:18:56] the give me the good Lord and I know I'm
[1:18:58] gonna find it right here in your Bible
[1:19:00] praise God
[1:19:01] I'm gonna find a ride here I'm almost
[1:19:03] done
[1:19:06] now
[1:19:08] as I've danced and we've shouted we've
[1:19:10] played live music some people say oh
[1:19:11] that's too much well let me tell you
[1:19:13] what a prophet of God said
[1:19:15] he said I know there's a lot of
[1:19:16] fanaticism people carrying on I know
[1:19:18] sometimes they do it when the music's
[1:19:20] jumping up and down and everything I
[1:19:22] know that goes he says and I believe
[1:19:24] that too
[1:19:26] I've seen people in the day when as long
[1:19:28] as the music's playing everybody was
[1:19:30] jumping and screaming but when the music
[1:19:31] stopped they stopped now let me just
[1:19:33] pause right there that happens in most
[1:19:35] churches once the Music Stops people I
[1:19:37] mean we try to clap but most churches
[1:19:39] they just stop right because the music
[1:19:40] stopped
[1:19:42] there are special moments though when
[1:19:44] the Music Stops we start we keep worship
[1:19:46] and praise God
[1:19:49] so brother man is making the point some
[1:19:51] people just try to pump really loud the
[1:19:53] music but then the worship dies down
[1:19:55] after that
[1:19:56] Bill ramp said that's all right even if
[1:19:58] they do that
[1:20:00] he says but when they stop the music
[1:20:01] stops see that's still all right as far
[1:20:04] as I'm concerned as long as the people
[1:20:07] lives right
[1:20:10] see that's the balance of it
[1:20:12] we gotta live right
[1:20:14] you know I dance all over here I I
[1:20:17] leaped off of this I don't know if
[1:20:18] Steve's ever seen somebody leap off of
[1:20:19] Pulpit but he it might be the first time
[1:20:21] but you know tomorrow Steve I gotta go
[1:20:23] fight the devil Devil's going to come
[1:20:24] sometime tomorrow and try to tempt me I
[1:20:26] gotta defeat the Devil tomorrow just
[1:20:27] like I defeated him today
[1:20:30] I gotta keep living right if I don't
[1:20:32] live right I'm a hypocrite
[1:20:34] now we all sin so Devil Makes Us all
[1:20:36] feel like Hypocrites but when we repent
[1:20:38] we're no longer hypocrites
[1:20:40] I said I'm sorry and I'm asking God to
[1:20:42] change my life change my heart
[1:20:45] make me more dedicated to Christ
[1:20:47] Hallelujah
[1:20:49] your flesh will always be hypocrite but
[1:20:51] your soul will help you make up for that
[1:20:53] by repenting
[1:20:55] and saying God I want to overcome
[1:20:58] I mean how many Overcomers we got here
[1:21:01] all right praise God Amen
[1:21:07] let's stand to our feet
