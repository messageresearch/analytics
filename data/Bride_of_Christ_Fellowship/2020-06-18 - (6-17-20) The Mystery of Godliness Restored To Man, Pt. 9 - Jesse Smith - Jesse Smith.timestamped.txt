[14:56] after with this prayer we'll get right
[14:57] into the word of god here tonight
[15:01] just a few announcements here and a few
[15:02] prayer requests
[15:04] jose just sent me a text and said
[15:06] remember him in prayer tomorrow he gets
[15:08] his
[15:09] tooth removed that's causing him trouble
[15:11] so i told him we'll be happy to pray for
[15:12] him
[15:14] uh here tonight
[15:18] let's pray for this brother uh from
[15:20] texas out he's the one i was witnessing
[15:22] to on the phone or trying to help out
[15:25] seems wesley and he said since we talked
[15:30] he said the devil's really been fighting
[15:32] him but he's he knows it's because he's
[15:33] trying to get right with the lord so
[15:35] let's remember him in prayer
[15:38] nothing's more powerful than prayer
[15:40] praise god
[15:44] so let's remember uh these prayer
[15:45] requests jose
[15:47] uh this gentleman named wesley in texas
[15:50] uh let's remember my wife the the um
[15:53] poison ivy has spread
[15:54] so it's really really hard for her to um
[15:56] do anything
[15:57] you know genevieve can't even sit on her
[15:59] lap you know or anything because it's
[16:00] just there's
[16:01] too much itching and it's really painful
[16:03] she's not sleeping well
[16:05] so i told her we pray for her let's
[16:07] remember
[16:08] this woman in copley dying of this liver
[16:11] trouble
[16:13] i haven't heard anything but i need to
[16:15] email her father
[16:17] see how she's doing
[16:20] let's remember the uh the race relations
[16:22] in america
[16:24] they're doing police reform i don't know
[16:25] if you saw they're trying to get some
[16:26] police reform done
[16:27] which will be good but the main thing is
[16:29] heart reform
[16:31] i should say heart repents
[16:34] and let's remember the supreme court i
[16:36] was really disappointed this week they
[16:37] had the you probably saw the ruling
[16:39] um it's really not good for churches um
[16:43] so let's just remember their hearts and
[16:45] prayers well
[16:46] i was really disappointed but god knows
[16:48] all things and
[16:50] you know god's in control
[16:54] he's sovereign and whatever he decides
[16:56] whatever he allows we'll give god glory

[22:22] bibles we want to read two
[22:24] portions of scripture here let's go to
[22:25] second peter 1 6 and then we'll read our
[22:27] memory verse
[22:28] from first thessalonians 5.
[22:33] so 2nd peter 1 6 we like to look at
[22:35] temperance tonight
[22:36] by god's grace uh
[22:40] ii peter 1 6.
[22:44] while you're turning there i don't know
[22:45] if you remember but last summer i
[22:46] preached on patience i don't know if you
[22:48] remember that
[22:49] we had visitors from my school come it
[22:51] was on a couple of sunday nights
[22:53] in july so lord willing i'll probably
[22:56] skip patience i'll just you know briefly
[22:58] review it next time lord willing
[23:01] because we've already heard it recently
[23:03] who doesn't need more patience though
[23:06] god knows i need more of it praise god
[23:08] remember it's so
[23:09] important the trials and the suffering
[23:11] is what produces patience
[23:13] and we can't run from that we have to
[23:14] welcome that we have to praise god in
[23:16] the midst of the storm
[23:17] that's what will give us grace to be
[23:19] more patient so ii peter
[23:21] 2 i'm sorry second peter 1 verse 6.
[23:23] thank you let's read this one then we'll
[23:25] read our memory verse
[23:27] uh one two three and to knowledge
[23:30] temperance and to temperance patience
[23:33] and the patience godliness let's go to
[23:36] first thessalonians 5
[23:37] 14. thessalonians 5 14.
[23:50] we'll read 14 down to uh 23
[23:54] by the grace of god remember this is
[23:56] right after the rapture text
[23:58] praise god
[24:01] this is his advice here let's read 14-23
[24:04] 1 2 3 now we exhort you
[24:08] brethren warn them that our unruly
[24:11] comfort the feeble-minded support the
[24:14] weak
[24:15] be patient toward all men see that none
[24:18] render evil for
[24:19] evil unto any man but ever follow
[24:23] that which is good both among yourselves
[24:26] and to all men rejoice evermore
[24:30] pray without ceasing in everything give
[24:33] thanks
[24:34] for this is the will of god in christ
[24:37] jesus concerning you
[24:39] quench not the spirit despise not
[24:42] prophesying
[24:43] prove all things hold fast that which is
[24:46] good
[24:47] abstain from all appearance of evil
[24:50] and the very god of peace sanctify you
[24:53] holy and i pray god your whole spirit
[24:57] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[25:01] unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
[25:04] may god has a blessing and rhema his
[25:05] word may be seated praise god
[25:14] well i'm coming off a great week on the
[25:16] lord you know i had some great services
[25:18] sunday and
[25:18] it's been a great week you know today i
[25:20] got two emails one from
[25:22] uh af or congo and then one from india
[25:25] people are enjoying the videos online
[25:27] and
[25:28] learning in it and one of them wants to
[25:30] translate my book for me
[25:31] into one of the india languages or
[25:34] dialects so i'm not sure about that
[25:36] i appreciate that but uh i gotta check
[25:39] him out first you know make sure he's a
[25:40] good
[25:41] good soldier uh so just encouraging
[25:44] there
[25:45] and uh it's been a great week in the
[25:48] lord we're still working on writing the
[25:49] seventh uh church age chapter by god's
[25:52] grace
[25:53] so that's a great study it's going
[25:55] really good i'm learning a lot of things
[25:57] about the church ages i never knew
[25:59] um so it's been really great um
[26:03] i just there's so much to it but i love
[26:05] it and uh thankful for god's grace here
[26:07] i guess we'll just get right to the word
[26:09] here uh
[26:11] so let's look at temperance here tonight
[26:12] i got some good quotes here some
[26:14] i've never read to you before i've just
[26:15] been listening you know to brother
[26:17] branham and
[26:18] finding these good quotes so i think
[26:20] they'll be a blessing to you
[26:21] about temperance here by god's grace
[26:25] now uh here peter the man remember he
[26:27] had the keys to the kingdom
[26:30] and he also had the keys to a statue of
[26:32] a perfect man
[26:33] praise god he had both what a what a
[26:35] commission this guy had
[26:37] he had he had keys to open salvation to
[26:40] all
[26:40] bibles that he had the gospel to the
[26:42] circumcision
[26:44] so he was the preacher to lead the
[26:47] jews with the holy ghost and then paul
[26:50] was the preacher
[26:51] the gospel to the uncircumcision so wow
[26:54] paul and peter just those twin towers
[26:56] there i'll say it like that just twin
[26:58] pillars
[26:59] ah what amazing uh what amazing faith
[27:02] they had praise god and remember paul
[27:04] was the messenger to the age because he
[27:06] rebuked peter
[27:08] in church that's what i like about peter
[27:10] he had so much experiences with god
[27:13] but look how humble he was he was humble
[27:15] enough to accept correction
[27:17] from a man that didn't know jesus
[27:20] personally
[27:20] but he knew him by the holy spirit
[27:23] amen what uh what a godly man peter my
[27:27] uh i just think so much of these bible
[27:30] saints you know
[27:30] i always you know look i don't know
[27:32] about you i was trying to look up my
[27:33] life which one am i most like you know i
[27:35] try to
[27:36] i try to see which one am i most like
[27:38] which is the least among all of them you
[27:40] know
[27:40] that's who i'd say i would be like but
[27:42] uh such
[27:43] amazing things such amazing revelations
[27:46] that god and that's what i believe i
[27:48] believe jesus
[27:49] will have paul and peter right there on
[27:50] the side so that's what i believe
[27:52] i could be wrong but the gospel to the
[27:55] circumcision
[27:56] gospel to the uncircumcision uh i just
[28:00] believe it'll be that way i could be
[28:01] wrong that just struck me right now i
[28:02] never thought about that
[28:04] uh my what amazing testimonies those men
[28:08] have thank god for their testimonies
[28:10] but remember it's all by grace it's all
[28:12] by god's mercy
[28:14] so temperance is a fourth portion of the
[28:16] holy spirit
[28:18] it's another level we'd say of anointing
[28:21] and it means in the greek self-control
[28:23] as we said on sunday i kind of close
[28:25] sunday night
[28:26] it's the virtue of one who masters his
[28:29] desires and passions
[28:31] especially his sensual appetites
[28:35] so when you have self-control
[28:38] you are able to master your sight what
[28:41] you look at uh
[28:44] you're able to master your taste what
[28:47] you eat
[28:48] or drink what you touch
[28:51] what you smell and what you hear
[28:55] okay so that is the quality
[28:58] of temperance it's the anointing of the
[29:00] holy spirit
[29:01] in other words without god's spirit you
[29:03] can't really
[29:05] monitor and control what you look at
[29:08] right or what you eat or what you
[29:09] what you see or what you smell or what
[29:11] you taste you won't be able to
[29:13] control that without the real power of
[29:16] the holy spirit
[29:18] amen that's why god gave it to us at the
[29:21] fourth step
[29:22] was temperance and it's interesting four
[29:25] is the earthly number right
[29:26] so temperance is control over the body
[29:29] right and the body is an
[29:30] earth bound uh temple right it's earth
[29:33] bound
[29:34] so that's interesting four deals with
[29:36] that and so
[29:38] you know once you know once you have
[29:39] faith you know god's way once you have
[29:40] virtue you have strength to
[29:42] to to walk it knowledge helps you
[29:45] understand
[29:45] why you're walking on it right turns the
[29:47] lights on
[29:48] uh and now temperance gives you the
[29:51] control to remain on the way
[29:54] so you don't leave the the narrow way
[29:56] and go to the broadway where everybody
[29:58] oh i want to i want my lust and my flesh
[30:00] to be satisfied and
[30:01] i just got to have another smoker that
[30:03] was my battle right
[30:05] i just got to have another uh marriage
[30:07] partner
[30:08] i just gotta get married a third time
[30:09] you know like so many people do
[30:12] uh but see temperance will keep you on
[30:14] the straight and narrow praise god
[30:16] it won't let you satisfy your flesh
[30:20] above the soul praise god and that's a
[30:23] great anointing that god
[30:24] gives us uh in other words temperance
[30:27] empowers you to be more
[30:29] spiritual than carnal
[30:33] right what remember what does the bible
[30:35] call sinners the bible calls them brute
[30:38] beasts
[30:39] right so man or woman without the holy
[30:42] ghost
[30:42] is nothing but a beast but when you get
[30:45] holy ghost temperance
[30:47] now you're beginning to control the
[30:48] beast
[30:50] right that black dog now you're
[30:52] beginning to control that black dog
[30:54] and not feed him and you don't become a
[30:57] beast now you're becoming a saint praise
[30:59] god
[31:00] now you're becoming separated hallelujah
[31:02] the bible called them saints in the old
[31:04] testament
[31:04] and they weren't born again right but
[31:07] they were separated
[31:09] by the holy spirit praise god the
[31:11] anointing they could receive on their
[31:13] flesh
[31:13] and in their mind they were separated to
[31:16] that praise god
[31:18] and so now you become a more spiritual
[31:22] person rather than
[31:23] everything is decided by the flesh
[31:26] like just in a small way like little
[31:28] kids right they got to go out and use
[31:30] the bathroom three or four times a
[31:31] service not not ours you know but some
[31:33] at some churches
[31:35] not not naomi's not i'm not not nobody
[31:37] here is what i'm saying
[31:38] but you know at school i got kids like
[31:41] that
[31:42] i'll just say it like that uh and then
[31:45] they gotta
[31:46] you know they can't control their eating
[31:48] right they they just
[31:49] they have a heart they're just such
[31:51] carnal creatures
[31:53] uh that they can't control themselves uh
[31:56] their their sensual appetites and and
[31:59] but
[32:00] these must be brought into subjection or
[32:02] obedience to the holy spirit
[32:05] in other words once you have temperance
[32:07] you
[32:08] work by god your your sixth sense
[32:10] instead of your five senses
[32:13] right because temperance is that it's
[32:15] control
[32:16] it's your sixth sense faith having
[32:19] control over your five senses
[32:22] praise god that's what it means that's
[32:24] what temperance is you can control
[32:26] your fleshly appetites that's right
[32:31] remember faith is a substance right it's
[32:34] a substance
[32:35] of things hoped for the evidence of
[32:37] things not
[32:38] seen praise god now you know this but
[32:42] galatians 5
[32:43] 24 25 it sums up the spiritual versus
[32:47] natural battle so it sums up the battle
[32:50] of temperance
[32:51] versus fleshly lust and the bible said
[32:54] and they that are christ
[32:55] have crucified the flesh with the
[32:58] affections
[32:58] and lust if we live in the spirit let us
[33:02] also walk in the spirit praise god
[33:05] so your your victory if you're going to
[33:08] be spiritually minded if you're going to
[33:10] live by
[33:11] faith the sense of faith the spiritual
[33:14] sense
[33:14] rather than the natural sense it only
[33:17] comes through crucifying
[33:19] and abstaining from the lusts of the
[33:22] flesh
[33:23] praise god
[33:26] uh see so crucifixion is a slow cruel
[33:29] death
[33:30] just like jesus's crucifixion and he
[33:32] says take up your cross
[33:33] daily and follow me and paul said die
[33:36] daily
[33:37] he's talking about uh crucifying his
[33:39] temptations
[33:40] through the five senses amen
[33:44] all right so that's a pretty good uh
[33:47] introduction there to temperance
[33:49] now as i wrote this i just kind of felt
[33:51] inspired
[33:53] uh to get to the the three channels of
[33:55] temptation so we'll be getting that in
[33:57] just a few moments
[33:58] but if you got your bible uh go to first
[34:00] corinthians three
[34:11] i want you to notice here in first
[34:12] corinthians 3 1-7
[34:14] paul calls the church carnal
[34:17] which means they were they were living
[34:20] in their flesh and they were satisfying
[34:23] the desires of their flesh now remember
[34:26] this is the same church that had tongues
[34:28] interpretation prophecy knowledge
[34:31] gifts i mean they had all the gifts so
[34:33] much that paul said just two or three in
[34:35] a service
[34:36] right he had so much they were i'll say
[34:39] like this they were so
[34:40] gifted but yet they were so carnal
[34:43] now we find the opposite many times say
[34:46] we're more dedicated than natural but
[34:47] we're not as spiritually gifted as we
[34:49] like right like
[34:50] who wouldn't want to prophesy like right
[34:52] brother amen like i would love to speak
[34:54] in tongues and then interpret it i wish
[34:56] i could
[34:57] but god doesn't work that way by what we
[34:59] want god gives us what he knows we need
[35:01] amen
[35:03] but they were the opposite brother amen
[35:05] they had so much
[35:07] gifts but yet no control over their
[35:09] bodies now which one would you rather
[35:11] have brother adam tells you
[35:12] he'd rather have the consecrated life
[35:16] right because brother braham said
[35:18] brother branson look at that ephesian
[35:19] church paul didn't have to rebuke them
[35:21] about sleeping with their mothers in law
[35:23] right or i'm sorry their stepmom
[35:25] he'd have to rebuke him and teach him
[35:27] about gifts he got down to the deep
[35:28] things of god
[35:30] how you were chosen in christ before the
[35:31] foundation of the world
[35:33] amen oh my
[35:36] so see but remember god loves a variety
[35:39] god likes gifted churches
[35:41] you know god likes god god has churches
[35:43] that are extremely gifted but more
[35:45] carnal
[35:46] but then he's got real spiritual
[35:48] churches with not as many gifts
[35:49] god has a variety right just like he's
[35:52] got big families small families
[35:54] black families white families brown
[35:56] family he loves a variety god
[35:58] is and god's in all that praise god and
[36:00] none of us can add
[36:02] any cubit to our stature but i'll say
[36:04] this we can covet the best gifts amen
[36:07] remember we saw that sunday night you
[36:09] and i can covet we can say god give
[36:12] us more praise god because remember amen
[36:15] my wife asked me a good question i'm
[36:16] going to share this with you
[36:17] my wife said how come there you know
[36:19] there aren't more gifts many times and i
[36:21] it just came to me and that's what i
[36:22] found out the gift just makes room for
[36:24] itself when people ask me questions many
[36:26] times the gift will just operate
[36:28] and the scripture came to me that the
[36:30] bible says let
[36:31] no man take your crown
[36:35] right and every gift is a talent and
[36:38] jesus said if this man won't do the
[36:39] talent i'll give it to another man
[36:43] so see when it comes down to gifts if
[36:45] we're not earnestly coveting and praying
[36:47] for more
[36:47] gifts of operation god will say well if
[36:50] you're not going to use it i'll give it
[36:51] to brother amen
[36:53] i'll give it to sister lydia or you know
[36:55] you know what i mean
[36:57] because and that's why brother abraham
[36:58] said the holy ghost can fall on one
[37:00] person one time
[37:02] to do one gift and then never use that
[37:04] person again well that may be because
[37:06] they grieve the holy spirit after that
[37:08] or it could be nobody else was open to
[37:11] it nobody was
[37:12] open to being yielded to the holy spirit
[37:13] so god chose that person amen
[37:16] because they were open to it praise god
[37:20] like my wife was saying my wife had a
[37:22] very prophetic dream like you like you
[37:24] guys have dreams
[37:25] and she went and warned the woman and
[37:27] she laughed it off and said oh i'd never
[37:28] wear pants or cut my hair
[37:30] within a couple years she did it and my
[37:32] wife's never had a real prophetic dream
[37:34] like that
[37:35] since in the same case to me i did the
[37:36] same thing i warned a minister's
[37:38] uh son-in-law yeah son-in-law and they
[37:42] just went right to it a few years after
[37:43] that
[37:45] but that's like a one-time thing like
[37:47] right now in my life and recently in my
[37:49] ministry i'm seeing more speaking the
[37:51] word
[37:51] faith i'm that's what you know like with
[37:54] who is dad
[37:56] uh and then my friend's dad and then the
[37:58] the two couples that couldn't have
[37:59] children you know
[38:00] so it's just interesting you know you
[38:02] look at your life church and and
[38:04] see and ask god to show you which gifts
[38:06] are operating in my life and help me to
[38:08] be faithful
[38:09] with the talents you've given me praise
[38:10] god
[38:12] help me to earnestly covet the best
[38:14] gifts
[38:16] but look he finds a carnal church first
[38:19] corinthians
[38:20] 3 1. we're going to read one to seven so
[38:22] lydia can you put him up there hun yeah
[38:24] you're good at that thanks you're good
[38:25] too okay
[38:26] i'm the bad one and i brethren could not
[38:29] speak unto you as spiritual
[38:30] now look at this but as in the cardinal
[38:32] even as unto babes in christ
[38:34] they remember they prophesied all the
[38:36] time they had miracles
[38:39] but yet he said spiritually you're
[38:41] babies because you're
[38:42] carnal in other words you don't have
[38:44] temperance right
[38:47] my they were coming to church they were
[38:49] operating the gifts for the amen
[38:51] but they were carnal and didn't even
[38:53] have temperance
[38:55] right remember paul called that man
[38:58] who slept with his step uh i'm sorry his
[39:02] mother yes stepmom paul called him a
[39:04] brother
[39:06] paul said put him under the blood our
[39:08] brother that he
[39:09] might give him over to satan that he
[39:11] might be saved
[39:12] a brother that means he at least had
[39:15] justification
[39:17] now there's no way he had the holy ghost
[39:18] doing that kind of evil thing
[39:20] but he was at least justified and paul
[39:22] gave the benefit of the doubt
[39:24] sometimes christians that are not born
[39:25] again make sexual sins like that and
[39:28] it's a shame
[39:29] it shouldn't be named once in the church
[39:31] of god but sometimes it happens in the
[39:32] church of god
[39:34] when people don't have temperance
[39:39] look you're babies but yet they had all
[39:42] kinds of
[39:43] powerful gifts and operation see out
[39:46] today church
[39:47] this is this is a great mystery this
[39:48] christianity is a great mystery you
[39:50] better we better know christ amen
[39:52] we need to know the revelations you know
[39:55] we need to know the revelation of the
[39:56] mystery but thank god he said it will be
[39:58] finished in the last days amen
[40:01] oh what a blessing we have to have the
[40:03] revelation of the mystery of god amen
[40:05] amen so see no matter how spiritual
[40:08] people are but amen no matter how
[40:10] much supernatural we may see in other
[40:11] people's lives that's fine
[40:13] but let's watch how they live afterwards
[40:17] let's see how they act the next week
[40:22] amen let's see what they act like let's
[40:24] see what they say
[40:25] let's see how they treat the not the
[40:28] highest people in the church but the
[40:29] least
[40:30] esteemed people in the church let's see
[40:33] if they can even love
[40:35] the unlovable let's see how they can
[40:38] love their
[40:38] enemies praise god
[40:42] paul said i gotta rebuke you you're just
[40:43] babies number two
[40:45] i'm sorry verse two i have fed you with
[40:47] milk and not with meat
[40:49] see you couldn't go into the deep things
[40:51] before the foundation of the world
[40:53] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[40:55] it neither
[40:56] yet now are you able remember he said
[40:57] melchizedek was a deep thing remember
[40:59] that
[41:00] that was in hebrews 5. no i'm sorry
[41:03] hebrews 6.
[41:04] no it's five and six sorry verse three
[41:06] for ye are yet carnal for whereas there
[41:09] is among you envying and strife and
[41:11] divisions
[41:11] are you not yet carnal and walk as men
[41:14] mine
[41:15] they were christians but walking like
[41:18] the world
[41:19] because of those go back to three
[41:21] because of what
[41:22] envying strife and divisions
[41:25] anytime you see a church that has
[41:28] envying divisions and strife
[41:30] they are not mature christians they're
[41:32] baby christians
[41:35] is that right that's that's the word of
[41:37] god think about all the church splits
[41:40] people have
[41:40] it's because they're baby christians now
[41:44] unless there's a good reason for you
[41:45] know if the leadership's off the word
[41:46] yeah then you should separate
[41:48] if they won't take corrections yes you
[41:49] should separate and divide yourself
[41:51] don't be amongst 11 right be unleavened
[41:54] praise god
[41:57] next verse verse 4 for while one saith
[42:00] i'm a paul another i'm of apollos are
[42:02] you not
[42:03] are you yet carnal see they were
[42:05] bragging it's not a sin to say well i go
[42:06] to brother jesse's church i go to
[42:08] brother
[42:08] samuel's church or brother cam that's
[42:10] not a sin
[42:11] but paul gets down to their sin they in
[42:14] the next verses they were proud of it
[42:17] they were bragging on the preachers
[42:19] instead of bragging on jesus
[42:20] amen okay next verse 5
[42:24] who then is paul who's apollos but
[42:26] ministers by whom you believe
[42:27] even as the lord gave to every man see
[42:29] every man's got a preacher
[42:31] every man you're gonna everybody's gonna
[42:32] go to some pastor's church
[42:34] but that don't make you any better and
[42:36] we shouldn't end the other people
[42:38] and we shouldn't exalt ourselves above
[42:40] anybody else
[42:42] verse six i have planted apollos water
[42:46] but god gave the increase oh i love how
[42:48] paul says it
[42:51] remember that remember uh paul went to
[42:54] ephesus remember
[42:55] and and he said have you received holy
[42:57] ghost since you believe and
[42:58] apollos was out of town and they got the
[43:01] holy ghost well
[43:02] paul said i planted that seed in their
[43:04] souls and then apollos came back and saw
[43:06] they were filled the holy ghost
[43:08] and watered it praise god but paul never
[43:10] said i'm better
[43:12] because you know you got the you got
[43:14] they got the holy ghost under me
[43:15] i'm greater paul never said that paul
[43:18] said we're all working together
[43:20] to make these seeds quicken and to bring
[43:22] forth fruit unto god
[43:24] next verse so then neither is he that
[43:27] planted
[43:28] anything neither he that watereth but
[43:30] god that gives the increase
[43:32] amen see you and i cannot increase
[43:35] i can't give you a revelation you can't
[43:38] give me a revelation
[43:39] only god can give it amen but we all
[43:42] work together
[43:44] we all do our little parts and if each
[43:46] of us
[43:47] does our little part each of us pray and
[43:50] create an atmosphere during the song
[43:51] service
[43:52] and worship god and love god and covet
[43:55] earnestly the best gifts
[43:57] then god gives an increase in the church
[43:59] amen
[44:00] praise god go back one verse though
[44:02] verse six
[44:05] god gives the increase i just want to
[44:07] see that i want you to see that again
[44:08] paul planted the holy ghost as far as
[44:11] they got the holy ghost
[44:12] they got the seed of god through paul's
[44:14] preaching and praying
[44:15] but apollos come afterwards and watered
[44:18] that
[44:19] but god is the one that gave the
[44:20] increase
[44:23] in other words god is the one that saved
[44:25] you don't say brother jesse save me or
[44:27] brother branham save me or
[44:29] no no one saved you jesus saved you
[44:32] praise god
[44:33] jesus gave the increase thank god
[44:35] somebody shared the word with you i
[44:37] thank god for simon
[44:38] but simon didn't save me christ saved me
[44:40] amen
[44:42] christ gave me the increase simon
[44:44] watered
[44:46] amen brother brooks planted uh
[44:49] simon show me the seed
[44:52] but then you know and then here and
[44:54] being a pastor you know god waters
[44:56] through me
[44:57] praise god but i'm just i'm i'm just on
[44:59] the same we're all on the same level
[45:01] we're way down here christ is way up
[45:03] there amen
[45:05] but see paul calls them you carnal
[45:07] church you baby church
[45:09] i don't want to be a baby message church
[45:11] that's what they do they
[45:12] they exalt some preachers and you've
[45:14] heard it you know some people exalt some
[45:16] preachers way above others paul said
[45:18] it's not that way
[45:20] it's not that way shouldn't be that way
[45:22] because he said that's when you're
[45:24] carnal
[45:24] that's when you're not you're not
[45:26] walking in temperance you're looking at
[45:28] how look you're you're going by your
[45:29] sight and what you hear
[45:30] oh i can hear this person on the
[45:32] internet and oh i see what kind of big
[45:34] church they have or
[45:35] what kind of nice clothes he's wearing
[45:37] his vehicle is a lot nicer than other
[45:39] people's you know
[45:40] uh they they live off of those things
[45:44] rather than the holy spirit because the
[45:46] holy spirit respects no man above any
[45:48] other
[45:50] he's not a respecter of persons but he
[45:52] is a rewarder
[45:53] of those that diligently seek him amen
[45:56] he's not a respecter he's a rewarder
[45:58] amen
[46:01] glory see they couldn't handle meat
[46:04] preaching remember meat preaching is
[46:05] discerning good and evil
[46:07] that's why the man that's why the man in
[46:09] the in chapter five
[46:10] that's chapter three in chapter five the
[46:12] man sleeping with his step
[46:14] mom the bible said they weren't even
[46:15] upset about it
[46:17] see they they couldn't handle the meat
[46:19] the meat would have told them
[46:21] that's wrong and they would discern
[46:23] that's evil paul had to come by and be
[46:25] their meat for them right he had to be
[46:27] he had to be their discernment for them
[46:29] he said you need to get rid of him put
[46:31] him out front of the blood
[46:32] and let his soul be saved on that day
[46:35] see we don't want just uh milk preaching
[46:39] there is a time for milk preaching
[46:40] especially for the children
[46:41] or the justified or you know or those
[46:44] who have you know
[46:45] just getting virtue or knowledge or
[46:46] something like that but pretty soon you
[46:48] have to grow up into meat praise god
[46:51] and you have to uh you have to stop
[46:53] looking at preachers
[46:54] and start looking at the word christ
[46:57] behind all of it
[47:01] if not you're going to be extremely
[47:02] carnal extremely extremely envious
[47:06] extremely divided because you only like
[47:09] this type of preacher
[47:10] only like that type of preacher unlike
[47:12] preachers from that state or only like
[47:14] preachers that act like this and that's
[47:17] carnal and it should not be in the
[47:20] church of god
[47:22] amen
[47:25] now i'd skipped a little bit but let me
[47:26] go back to this remember
[47:28] in order to get every anointing on the
[47:30] statute perfect man you have to reject
[47:32] something
[47:33] right with faith you got to reject
[47:34] unbelief right
[47:36] with virtue i forget the one you gotta
[47:38] reject i can't remember that now
[47:39] with knowledge you gotta reject
[47:41] reasoning well with temperance
[47:43] you have to reject sensuality
[47:46] now pull up the scripture well yeah pull
[47:48] up jude 1
[47:49] 18 19.
[47:54] [Music]
[47:57] now over time church this is going to
[47:59] encourage you amen
[48:02] over time
[48:05] you can judge christians who have
[48:08] temperance
[48:08] by the church they go to
[48:13] right because the bible says they went
[48:15] out from us because they were not of us
[48:19] so if you look at the long-term
[48:21] membership of a church
[48:22] and the people that really love god
[48:26] you're going to find the people that are
[48:27] temperate that's true
[48:29] look at this how they that told you
[48:32] there should be mockers in the last time
[48:34] are we living the last time they're
[48:36] mocking us
[48:37] they're mocking christians who should
[48:40] walk after their
[48:41] own ungodly lust next verse these be
[48:44] they who separate themselves
[48:46] sensual not having the holy spirit
[48:51] there's always going to be a few judases
[48:53] hanging around and the church said
[48:56] but for the real godly saints they're
[48:58] the most the people
[49:00] that's what i can say thank god for our
[49:01] church praise god most of the people in
[49:03] the church
[49:04] if they're temperate then they're
[49:06] staying here because this is a place of
[49:08] holiness
[49:10] because those that are sensual the bible
[49:13] said they separate themselves
[49:15] they don't like to hang around you holy
[49:17] rollers praise god
[49:18] because you don't want to do the things
[49:19] they do praise god
[49:22] see so as time goes by like we've been
[49:23] hanging about run bang now for 20 years
[49:26] almost
[49:27] he's a holy man by the holy spirit not
[49:30] by because he's something great you know
[49:31] i'm nobody either i'm just saying he
[49:34] loves holiness
[49:36] he hasn't separated himself but many of
[49:39] our friends have
[49:41] right many of our friends have separated
[49:45] themselves from our fellowship
[49:46] because they're sensual they like the
[49:48] lust of the flesh and so they're
[49:50] uh they don't have the holy spirit see
[49:54] so see there is something to be said for
[49:56] church attendance
[49:58] and staying at one church there's
[49:59] something to be said for that
[50:01] it proves you got the holy ghost praise
[50:02] god
[50:04] and you're temperate hallelujah
[50:08] remember judas hung around so long but
[50:10] he couldn't go to the pentecost
[50:12] he showed his colors oh thank you lord
[50:16] go to second timothy 2 22.
[50:22] remember paul said follow me as i follow
[50:24] christ so brother is not here but we
[50:25] follow his message
[50:27] but you have to follow somebody
[50:28] physically and paul tells us
[50:31] who to follow he tells you to follow
[50:33] people who are not
[50:34] sensual not carnal in other words follow
[50:38] people that have
[50:39] temperance flee also youthful lusts
[50:43] but follow righteousness faith charity
[50:46] peace
[50:47] with them that call on the lord out of a
[50:50] pure heart
[50:52] ah that's what i like i like to be on a
[50:54] church where they're calling upon god
[50:56] they're worshiping god
[50:58] and they're doing it from the purity the
[51:00] sincerity they're not doing it for show
[51:02] they're doing it because they love god
[51:04] and they need god we need more of god as
[51:08] time goes on
[51:08] we're need more of god to make it
[51:10] through laodicea
[51:12] amen amen so the bible said
[51:15] flee from those youthful lusts
[51:18] right we'll get to some examples in just
[51:20] a moment here
[51:23] literally flee them
[51:26] remember any of these lusts anything you
[51:28] see taste
[51:30] uh feel smell hear anything that
[51:33] that uh abstain from all appearance of
[51:36] evil the bible says
[51:38] brother cam gave me a good tip and i
[51:39] need to do this so i'm just i'm saying
[51:41] it so i remember
[51:42] cam said he said his uh phone did he say
[51:44] that he set his phone to the 12 year old
[51:47] setting you know how you can do like
[51:48] 12 18. uh you can do explicit
[51:52] nc 17. i didn't realize that but i'm
[51:55] gonna have to do that
[51:56] he said he put it on 12 years old and so
[51:58] he don't get any of the ads anymore that
[52:00] show like you know women in bikinis or
[52:02] uh you know things like men wearing
[52:05] underwear
[52:06] i thought man that's a good idea i need
[52:07] to do that
[52:09] that's a great idea i didn't know you
[52:11] could do that
[52:12] because you know as a christian we don't
[52:15] purposely go to those things but satan
[52:17] tries to surprise us with it
[52:20] and it kind of upsets us at times right
[52:25] now i don't know about you but i get
[52:26] most of my news from youtube
[52:28] i you know subscribe to fox and a few
[52:30] other places uh daily
[52:32] wire and a couple other guys well i pay
[52:34] 13
[52:35] a month so i don't have to see those
[52:36] filthy ads to me it's worth every penny
[52:41] 13 bucks is a deal not to see those
[52:44] filthy ads
[52:46] because i'll take it because i don't
[52:47] want to hear the filthy rap i don't want
[52:49] to hear the fear of the filthy country
[52:50] music i don't want to see the
[52:52] alcohol i don't want to see the ads for
[52:54] new cars
[52:56] i don't want to see that so i want to so
[52:58] i want to learn and this
[53:00] should be true for all of us we should
[53:02] get better at being holy on our phones
[53:04] and our tablets as time goes on
[53:08] it should be more holy praise god if not
[53:12] we need to get rid of it
[53:13] or stop saying where holy ghost filled
[53:16] nine
[53:18] so flee from it and then follow
[53:21] those people that call upon god with a
[53:24] pure heart
[53:26] amen
[53:29] i love that that's beautiful so church
[53:32] you can see we're starting to see a huge
[53:34] difference but amen as i've been around
[53:36] the message just you know just about 19
[53:38] years
[53:38] i can i can tell now looking back i can
[53:41] tell which churches
[53:42] were temperate and which ones weren't
[53:45] because
[53:46] of the things they saw tasted touch
[53:49] smelled and heard
[53:51] they would they would talk about hearing
[53:53] and enjoying things that i knew was
[53:55] wrong
[53:56] right and then i heard then they would
[53:58] talk about their relationships that were
[54:01] in
[54:01] you know some deacons and preachers
[54:02] married two or three times
[54:04] how is this happening in this church and
[54:06] they want me to preach
[54:08] you know just you know you as you
[54:11] it's very easy you just have to to
[54:14] discern just
[54:15] listen to what they say and look at what
[54:17] they do
[54:19] right look at their five senses which
[54:21] sense are they feeding the most
[54:23] the five senses or the sixth sense
[54:27] amen let's feed faith amen let's be
[54:30] faithful
[54:33] now let's look at this uh real briefly
[54:35] so as i as i was writing
[54:37] this is months ago maybe a year ago i
[54:39] felt led of the holy spirit this would
[54:40] be the right place to put
[54:42] the lust of the eyes the pride of life
[54:44] and the lust of the flesh
[54:46] because temperance is where you get the
[54:48] victory
[54:49] over all those things at least the lust
[54:52] of the flesh and lust of the eyes
[54:53] i felt it was so inspired i really
[54:57] believe it was inspired
[54:59] see your temptations come in one of
[55:01] these three categories either
[55:03] lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride
[55:05] of life
[55:07] now let's look at some very simple lust
[55:10] of the flesh
[55:11] examples now i define this
[55:14] as sinful acts that bring your flesh
[55:17] pleasure
[55:18] or satisfaction in a sinful way right
[55:22] in a simple way because there's nothing
[55:23] wrong with you know wanting to
[55:25] go eat you know supper not wrong with
[55:28] that
[55:30] but here's the first one the bible
[55:32] clearly says drunkenness
[55:34] perverts your moral judgment according
[55:36] to proverbs 31
[55:38] 4-5 and drunkards will not inherit the
[55:41] kingdom of god
[55:42] praise god so that's a very simple one
[55:46] most of us of course wouldn't get drunk
[55:48] uh so that's a very simple one now
[55:51] here's the one where i have some new
[55:53] quotes i've never read before
[55:55] and this is what i wrote months ago pull
[55:57] up proverbs 23
[55:59] 20 lydia proverbs 23 20. let's look at
[56:02] overeating because i mentioned this on
[56:04] sunday
[56:07] and this is one that's awful in america
[56:09] that's why we have diabetes
[56:11] because people overeat they especially
[56:12] the pop and sugar
[56:14] it's like they're idle they got to have
[56:16] mountain dew or dr pepper or
[56:18] whatever even sugary coffee drinks my
[56:20] coffee i don't put any sugar in my
[56:21] coffee just milk
[56:23] i don't put anything in there because i
[56:24] don't want i don't want diabetes down
[56:26] the road
[56:28] i don't want that i stopped drinking pop
[56:30] 20 years ago
[56:31] because i saw the effects that it was
[56:33] having on my life
[56:34] but look at proverbs 23 20 be not
[56:38] among wine bibbers among riotous eaters
[56:41] of flesh so see
[56:43] right to so lots of parties feasting
[56:45] eating next verse
[56:47] 21 for the drunkard and the glutton
[56:52] shall come to
[56:53] poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a
[56:58] man with rags
[56:59] so see that someone that overeats what
[57:01] does that mean they
[57:02] overspend on food and not only that but
[57:06] if they overspend on food that becomes
[57:08] an evil habit
[57:09] and then they just overspend on
[57:11] everything
[57:12] see because you over overspend you spend
[57:15] too much money on food
[57:17] spend too much time on food and then it
[57:20] leads to an addiction
[57:22] of spending too much money on everything
[57:24] so the bible says
[57:26] those that are gluttonous often come to
[57:28] poverty
[57:29] because they put all their money in
[57:31] eating and then they can develop bad
[57:33] habits
[57:34] of of spending too much money as well
[57:37] look at philippians 3 18 and 19 lydia
[57:41] paul now we'll get to this eventually
[57:43] when we preach our series that the lord
[57:44] tarries
[57:45] and he keeps directing me to philippians
[57:48] paul says in philippians 3 18 for many
[57:51] walk of whom i have told you often and
[57:52] now tell you even weeping now this made
[57:54] paul cry
[57:56] that they are the enemies of the cross
[57:58] of christ can you imagine
[58:00] being an enemy of the cross of christ i
[58:02] don't want to be an
[58:03] enemy of it i want to be a supporter of
[58:05] it praise god
[58:06] i want to be an advocate for the cross
[58:08] in other words more people need the
[58:10] cross amen i need the cross
[58:12] we all need the cross but some people
[58:14] paul would cry and say they're
[58:16] fighting against the cross well how are
[58:18] they doing that verse 19
[58:20] whose end is their destruction whose god
[58:23] is their
[58:24] belly so they really don't worship god
[58:28] jesus they worship right here
[58:31] so i can get satisfied that's the most
[58:34] important thing of the day is where am i
[58:38] going to eat next
[58:40] or how can i convince these christians
[58:43] to give me more money
[58:44] so i can go feed myself
[58:47] and this made paul cry whose glories and
[58:50] their shame
[58:51] who mined earthly things all they
[58:53] thought about was the next meal
[58:55] and the next indulgence to the flesh
[59:00] now it might not be a problem in our
[59:02] church but you go to other churches
[59:04] you're gonna find a lot of people are
[59:05] overweight
[59:07] now sometimes people can't help it but
[59:10] most of the time
[59:11] people can help it because look
[59:14] it's in the word i'm not talking about a
[59:17] five or ten extra pounds i'm not talking
[59:19] about that
[59:20] i'm talking about when when you and i
[59:22] know when we know in our minds
[59:24] we've got a problem our biggest concern
[59:27] is our belly
[59:29] instead of heavenly treasures
[59:32] praise god let me read you some quotes i
[59:35] thought you
[59:35] might like these from brother branham
[59:38] this is from the absolute after the
[59:40] seals december 1st
[59:42] that's my brother paul's birthday
[59:45] paul brother runs into a brother and he
[59:47] says i met brother uh buddhist out here
[59:50] and i hadn't seen him since i've been
[59:51] here and i said height where you been
[59:53] he said getting turkey dinner ready for
[59:55] them and so i was telling him i'd lost
[59:57] some weight and he said you
[59:59] i said you haven't changed a bit he said
[1:00:01] neither have you i said that's real
[1:00:03] diplomacy
[1:00:05] i said but you know i have lost weight i
[1:00:08] went from 170
[1:00:10] to 145 so i sure have
[1:00:13] changed so brother brahms
[1:00:16] lost some weight here 25 pounds
[1:00:21] my suits all too big a little too big
[1:00:24] for me
[1:00:25] and someone just got me one the other
[1:00:27] day so i could wear it down here
[1:00:29] one that didn't hang off my shoulders
[1:00:31] and the waistline lap
[1:00:33] over so brothers were watching brother
[1:00:35] branham
[1:00:36] and he was so skinny that his suits look
[1:00:39] funny on him like a clown
[1:00:41] his waist would lap over maybe the belt
[1:00:44] would be really really tight and
[1:00:45] you know how pants look when they when
[1:00:47] you're they're too big for you
[1:00:49] and people noticed his jackets were just
[1:00:51] too big for him
[1:00:53] and so the brother's like can i buy you
[1:00:54] a new suit
[1:00:56] you kind of look like you're you're a
[1:00:58] little guy in a big suit
[1:01:01] brother ram said now here's what he says
[1:01:03] about losing 25 pounds
[1:01:05] i'm trying to do my very best for jesus
[1:01:09] christ
[1:01:10] while i have a chance to do it
[1:01:13] amen brother man lost 25
[1:01:16] pounds after the seals so he could do a
[1:01:20] better job
[1:01:21] serving jesus christ anybody knows
[1:01:25] once you get overweight and you lose
[1:01:27] that weight you
[1:01:28] just have more energy right
[1:01:32] anyone knows that brother branham knew
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:37] and he says it not one time i got multi
[1:01:39] i got three quotes here
[1:01:40] mouth of two or three witnesses anybody
[1:01:43] knows that
[1:01:44] now i was joking the other night i was
[1:01:46] up up late eating ice cream and that's
[1:01:48] true i did that a couple of nights
[1:01:50] but i don't do it every night because if
[1:01:52] i do you'll see pimples all over me
[1:01:54] my wife will see them on my shoulders
[1:01:56] and my back i just break out i just
[1:01:57] can't handle much sugar
[1:01:59] every now and then i'll have a little
[1:02:00] extra ice cream that i'm probably
[1:02:01] supposed to have
[1:02:03] but it's just you know five or ten
[1:02:04] minutes it's a little bowl
[1:02:07] i'm not talking about eating three or
[1:02:08] four bowls in a week i'm not talking
[1:02:09] about that
[1:02:12] and people ask me brother amen how come
[1:02:14] you're not gaining weight i said well
[1:02:16] because i try to take care of i try to
[1:02:17] make it spiritual because it is
[1:02:19] i the reason i exercise and i love
[1:02:21] exercising with malachi
[1:02:22] but the reason i do it is so my temple
[1:02:25] will last a little longer
[1:02:27] so i'm not in the hospital and i can
[1:02:28] serve jesus christ
[1:02:30] that's the reason i do it most of my
[1:02:32] friends by the
[1:02:33] their bellies instead of looking like
[1:02:34] this they're looking like that
[1:02:37] and they're only 38 39 40 41 42
[1:02:40] and they're ch they got three or four
[1:02:42] chins you know i'm not making fun of
[1:02:44] them
[1:02:44] but church i believe if you're if you
[1:02:47] don't if you have temperance
[1:02:49] you can control how much you eat see it
[1:02:52] proves when they get overweight
[1:02:54] on purpose it proves they don't have
[1:02:57] temperance
[1:02:59] but peter said add it amen
[1:03:02] instead of adding the food add
[1:03:04] temperance instead praise god
[1:03:06] i mean overeating food because normal
[1:03:08] foods good if you eat enough
[1:03:10] green vegetables and and green beans and
[1:03:13] carrots and everything like that you're
[1:03:14] going to lose weight you're going to be
[1:03:16] healthy praise god
[1:03:18] the trouble is they eat a taco bell and
[1:03:20] most of that has
[1:03:21] preservatives in it and then they'll go
[1:03:23] home and eat a snicker bar
[1:03:24] and then they'll drink a lemonade or an
[1:03:27] iced tea or something like that
[1:03:29] and it's all the wrong food and it's not
[1:03:32] what your body needs you're not giving
[1:03:33] it what it needs so it turns it into fat
[1:03:36] but see the bible says he who has temper
[1:03:38] is temper in
[1:03:39] everything amen that means he can drive
[1:03:42] by a taco bell or mcdonald's or you can
[1:03:44] walk
[1:03:45] by the ice cream section and not be a
[1:03:47] slave to the ice cream section a giant
[1:03:49] eagle amen
[1:03:50] or all to you that's where i mostly shop
[1:03:52] aldi you understand
[1:03:54] but so many people in the message are
[1:03:56] addicted to the fleshly things
[1:03:59] overeating and that is a clear sign
[1:04:03] brothers and sisters they don't have
[1:04:04] temperance maybe they had it at one time
[1:04:07] but remember you can lose the anointing
[1:04:10] you might have good treasures in your
[1:04:12] house but if you let that devil in there
[1:04:14] of
[1:04:14] of overeating and gluttony he'll rob
[1:04:17] he'll spoil
[1:04:18] that temperance and he'll take it away
[1:04:20] from you and tie up your faith
[1:04:24] praise god
[1:04:29] it's true i mean i i don't think brother
[1:04:32] brother brooks would mind me saying this
[1:04:33] but
[1:04:34] every time he's here he goes for a jog
[1:04:37] right he was jogging friday and saturday
[1:04:38] and i think monday morning he took a jog
[1:04:41] he said brother jesse i got to work so
[1:04:42] hard to keep he'll run four or five
[1:04:44] miles
[1:04:45] and he's in his 60s just to keep his
[1:04:48] weight
[1:04:49] normal because his his metabolism is so
[1:04:53] slow if he doesn't do that he'll just
[1:04:55] keep going
[1:04:57] and that's what i admire about him and
[1:04:59] that see that shows me
[1:05:01] that shows me that if you've got
[1:05:02] temperance you're going to keep trying
[1:05:04] even in your 60s
[1:05:06] right because he's the father of he's my
[1:05:08] spiritual father
[1:05:10] and that's what i love about that he's
[1:05:12] taking care of himself he realizes
[1:05:14] if i don't take care of the natural i'm
[1:05:16] going to get diseases
[1:05:18] and that's going to hinder my service to
[1:05:20] god but i want to be a servant of god
[1:05:23] who's faithful i want to be a servant of
[1:05:25] god who's trustworthy amen
[1:05:28] who can who's devoted to the work of god
[1:05:31] and not the work of getting a happy
[1:05:34] living in laodicea
[1:05:37] that's why i try to fast you know as
[1:05:38] much as i can
[1:05:42] so brother man lost 25 pounds why to win
[1:05:45] a fashion show
[1:05:46] to win a beauty contest to win a strong
[1:05:49] man contest brothers
[1:05:51] the arnold expo they have an arnold expo
[1:05:55] you know where they pose and everything
[1:05:56] like that
[1:05:57] no he did it so he could serve christ
[1:05:59] better
[1:06:01] 25 pounds that was in december 63.
[1:06:04] now this is in november 61.
[1:06:09] brother braham said right now i'm not
[1:06:11] eating pleasant foods
[1:06:14] and i have it since the going away of my
[1:06:16] mother so when his mom
[1:06:18] died he just stopped eating pleasant
[1:06:22] foods
[1:06:25] he said i'm seeking the lord for a new
[1:06:27] vision can you imagine that
[1:06:29] someone you love so much dies and you
[1:06:31] say god i need a new vision so i'm going
[1:06:33] to stop
[1:06:33] eating as much as i used to
[1:06:38] i'm just eating soft things as little as
[1:06:41] i can get by with
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:44] see in america we're always seeing how
[1:06:45] much we can get for our money
[1:06:47] right how much can i eat at that all
[1:06:51] you can eat buffet now they won't have
[1:06:52] any more because of corona virus but
[1:06:54] that's that's the attitude of all a lot
[1:06:56] of friends a lot of people in the
[1:06:57] message
[1:06:58] i want to get as much as i can for my
[1:07:01] money and by the way i'm saying
[1:07:02] when i need a vision from god a new
[1:07:04] spiritual devotion from god
[1:07:06] i need to eat as little as i can just
[1:07:09] enough to get
[1:07:10] by with it he was a small man church
[1:07:12] brother man was not a big man
[1:07:17] he says now i'm not fasting so see
[1:07:19] eating a little bit is not fasting
[1:07:22] no just to do that that ain't giving
[1:07:24] that to the lord
[1:07:26] see he's saying i'm not fast he said i'm
[1:07:28] not fasting to lose weight
[1:07:30] he said because that wouldn't be for the
[1:07:31] lord that'd be for me
[1:07:34] right he says you want to give the lord
[1:07:38] the best you got he says it twice there
[1:07:42] amen when you need a new vision when you
[1:07:45] need a breakthrough with god
[1:07:47] he said i'm just eating less so see i'm
[1:07:50] more
[1:07:50] spiritual more temperate
[1:07:53] instead of being so carnal all the time
[1:07:58] you know you ever heard that expression
[1:07:59] hangry
[1:08:02] you're so hung hungry that you're angry
[1:08:06] it's funny but it's wrong unless like
[1:08:09] you're gonna die or something like that
[1:08:11] but a lot of people get like that
[1:08:12] especially in america
[1:08:15] if they don't get what they want when
[1:08:16] they want it if i don't get my chipotle
[1:08:18] i like chipotle that's why i'm saying
[1:08:19] that
[1:08:20] if i don't get my panera if i don't get
[1:08:21] my whatever they get angry
[1:08:25] see that shows a lack of temperance
[1:08:29] and that's carnal
[1:08:34] here's the last one
[1:08:38] but this is in uh hebrews chapter 1
[1:08:42] uh 1957.
[1:08:48] he says now uh i may fly to california
[1:08:50] up to maine just where he would call me
[1:08:52] that's the reason i don't set long
[1:08:54] itineraries i can't do that my ministry
[1:08:55] is not cut out that way which is
[1:08:57] different
[1:08:57] now i came home for a little rest i lost
[1:09:00] 20 pounds
[1:09:01] in the last meeting and brother mercer
[1:09:04] and
[1:09:05] brother goad was up a little while ago
[1:09:07] and said brother branham i notice what
[1:09:08] you do
[1:09:09] you put your whole heart into it
[1:09:13] so brother branham and god had to show
[1:09:15] them this
[1:09:16] brother branham god told him to go up in
[1:09:18] and hunt so he could rest his mind and
[1:09:20] body
[1:09:21] and while up there he would you know eat
[1:09:23] meat and he would gain weight you know
[1:09:25] because
[1:09:26] he has all those animals to eat
[1:09:29] but then when he would go into a long
[1:09:31] meeting all the strain on his body and
[1:09:33] his mind all the staying up
[1:09:34] preaching for pete no preaching and
[1:09:36] praying for the sick he would lose
[1:09:38] weight
[1:09:40] and the brothers noticed like brother
[1:09:41] branham you're a lot thinner
[1:09:44] and he said that's because he said i'm
[1:09:47] putting my whole heart into it
[1:09:49] now church that should be for us too
[1:09:51] anytime we're putting our whole heart
[1:09:53] into serving jesus christ
[1:09:55] our spiritual desires should be greater
[1:09:58] than our natural desires
[1:10:01] i think the reason i'm preaching on this
[1:10:02] so long is because this is the biggest
[1:10:04] one of the biggest problems in the
[1:10:04] message i see with temperance
[1:10:06] people just can't control their bodies
[1:10:08] they can't control what they eat
[1:10:11] they can't most people have a hard time
[1:10:13] with that
[1:10:15] and they just balloon and balloon and
[1:10:16] balloon and i'm not saying there's
[1:10:17] nothing wrong with a just you know a
[1:10:18] little bit of weight as you
[1:10:20] gain a little weight as you get older
[1:10:21] i'm not saying about that but i'm saying
[1:10:23] about the spirit of this laodicean
[1:10:25] church age
[1:10:26] the spirit of lusting for the things of
[1:10:29] the flesh
[1:10:31] brother man said yeah he said you put
[1:10:33] your whole heart into it he said i said
[1:10:35] yeah that's right that's the only way
[1:10:36] you can do a right kind of job for the
[1:10:38] lord
[1:10:39] is to put everything you got right in
[1:10:42] the forefront for christ
[1:10:43] all your strength all your soul all your
[1:10:45] heart all your mind
[1:10:47] everything you got amen hallelujah
[1:10:51] amen give everything you got to christ
[1:10:56] even how much food you eat
[1:10:59] i'm not saying starve yourself yeah for
[1:11:02] many years i've been taking a
[1:11:03] multivitamin so
[1:11:05] you know i get those nutrients i may not
[1:11:07] get during the day
[1:11:10] and then i can eat less
[1:11:13] he said whatever you got put it in the
[1:11:15] use of god's service
[1:11:17] so there's three quotes but ram said the
[1:11:19] reason i lose weight
[1:11:20] is i want to give my very best to jesus
[1:11:24] christ
[1:11:26] now i appreciate marriage banquets i
[1:11:27] preach it as well i've told sisters and
[1:11:29] brothers
[1:11:30] yeah the reason you might want to lose
[1:11:31] weight is to be more attractive to your
[1:11:33] spouse
[1:11:34] but your spouse should never put you
[1:11:35] down for your weight
[1:11:37] male or female we're supposed to be
[1:11:40] children of love
[1:11:42] right but there's nothing wrong with me
[1:11:45] well i like to
[1:11:46] look healthy so my wife thinks i'm
[1:11:48] attractive
[1:11:50] that kind of sounds kind of silly but
[1:11:55] yeah that's the funny thing about
[1:11:56] marriage you know but there's nothing
[1:11:58] wrong with that brother said it's part
[1:11:59] of a woman to be pretty
[1:12:01] but ram said there's nothing wrong with
[1:12:03] a woman wanting to be pretty for her
[1:12:05] husband
[1:12:06] there's nothing wrong with that but you
[1:12:08] don't let it
[1:12:09] go overboard right where you dress sexy
[1:12:13] or you
[1:12:14] or you know you starve yourself or you
[1:12:16] develop you know what do they call that
[1:12:17] throw up
[1:12:18] syndrome what do they call that anorexia
[1:12:21] thank you sister that's right
[1:12:23] yeah that was big when we were growing
[1:12:24] up and when i was in high school that a
[1:12:25] lot of the girls did that
[1:12:27] they would eat and then you see one at a
[1:12:28] time they go into the bathroom and
[1:12:30] you'd hear and they throw it up just to
[1:12:32] stay slim and trim
[1:12:34] which is very unhealthy
[1:12:37] that just is evil right because what a
[1:12:39] waste that is
[1:12:40] you gorge yourself and then you go throw
[1:12:43] it up
[1:12:44] that's what a waste that is so vain
[1:12:48] right so i want to move on now but does
[1:12:51] everybody understand
[1:12:53] i preach really hard about that brother
[1:12:55] amen i preach hard on having big
[1:12:56] families and
[1:12:58] a lot of people don't like me i preach
[1:13:00] holiness like
[1:13:01] let's live it if it's in the bible let's
[1:13:03] live it praise god
[1:13:04] and nobody to this day has ever shown me
[1:13:06] a scripture against it either overeating
[1:13:08] or having a big family no one's ever to
[1:13:10] this day show me
[1:13:11] i've had preachers come in here and say
[1:13:12] i know you believe in big families
[1:13:14] brother jess
[1:13:15] well that's because it's the word and no
[1:13:17] one's ever showed me a scripture
[1:13:19] where it's okay to limit it now unless
[1:13:22] the mother's sick right unless the
[1:13:24] mother we know that
[1:13:25] that's wisdom right you don't put
[1:13:27] yourself in a evil situation unless you
[1:13:29] know god like brother branham
[1:13:30] remember brother bram uh he knew he's
[1:13:32] gonna have a joseph and the doctors say
[1:13:34] we gotta we gotta close up we gotta get
[1:13:35] rid of your wife's ovaries and
[1:13:37] everything like that
[1:13:38] uh she just had too many babies too many
[1:13:39] c-sections
[1:13:41] brother man said doctor that's fine but
[1:13:42] you aren't touching that because the
[1:13:44] lord told me i'm going to have a baby
[1:13:46] another i have a boy that's different
[1:13:49] that's different remember the doctor
[1:13:51] said you know her uterus is so
[1:13:53] so thin it'll it'll break and they'll
[1:13:55] lose the baby and she'll lose her life
[1:13:57] and brother man said it doesn't matter
[1:13:58] what your science says god told me i'm
[1:14:01] going to have a son praise god
[1:14:02] that's different that's different
[1:14:09] but if the mother's life is in jeopardy
[1:14:10] no of course we don't tell the mothers
[1:14:12] to
[1:14:13] put their lives in jeopardy unless
[1:14:14] they're feeling led of the lord because
[1:14:16] if they're in god's hands they're in the
[1:14:17] perfect hands
[1:14:18] they'll be totally safe all right so
[1:14:21] let's move on
[1:14:22] i hope that's a blessing i may preach
[1:14:24] that again on sunday as well
[1:14:26] because i want the whole church to hear
[1:14:27] i know some people don't hear wednesday
[1:14:28] nights because i don't know why but
[1:14:30] sometimes so i want to make sure i
[1:14:32] appreciate it again i hope you can sit
[1:14:33] through that maybe again on sunday like
[1:14:35] just a little bit of that
[1:14:36] because i want them to see what brother
[1:14:37] ram said we got to give god our best
[1:14:41] we got to give god our best and it's too
[1:14:44] easy church
[1:14:44] it's too easy to be worldly in america
[1:14:47] hopefully naomi and beatrice can say
[1:14:49] amen to that one
[1:14:51] this is the world of plenty this is the
[1:14:53] land of the plenty right
[1:14:55] if there ever was a laodicean age it's
[1:14:58] right here
[1:14:59] but we've got to master that we've got
[1:15:00] to deny that and take up a cross brother
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:03] and follow jesus praise god
[1:15:08] hallelujah
[1:15:10] the next one is sexual sins the lust of
[1:15:12] the flesh
[1:15:13] remember david's son amnon he was so
[1:15:16] vexed with fleshly lust that he raped
[1:15:18] his half-sister tamar
[1:15:20] and then he was later murdered by her
[1:15:22] full brother absalon
[1:15:24] and remember we know it was lust because
[1:15:27] as soon as he got done with it
[1:15:29] done raping her he started hating her
[1:15:32] right afterwards
[1:15:33] real love will wait to the wedding night
[1:15:37] so i hope our sisters and young girls
[1:15:39] hear that any man that would mistreat
[1:15:41] you and try to steal
[1:15:43] something so precious as your innocence
[1:15:45] that's not even a man that's a beast
[1:15:47] that's a dog
[1:15:49] amen but a real man who'll wait to the
[1:15:52] wedding night and wait to the marriage
[1:15:53] life
[1:15:54] that's a man that's got real temperance
[1:15:56] praise god holy ghost temperance amen
[1:16:02] paul said purge out put away that wicked
[1:16:05] church member brother who was
[1:16:06] fornicating with his stepmom purge him
[1:16:09] out he's dirty he's
[1:16:10] filthy purge him out of the church
[1:16:14] now drugs is another one the word
[1:16:16] witchcraft in the new testament means
[1:16:18] drugs
[1:16:20] so anyone addicted to drugs that's a
[1:16:21] lust of the flesh
[1:16:23] we've had you know the young guys that
[1:16:24] used to come to our church that was
[1:16:25] their big thing drugs which witchcraft
[1:16:27] though
[1:16:28] and one of the brothers told me but amen
[1:16:30] when he would he would do it so he could
[1:16:32] see
[1:16:32] demons in that realm and they would try
[1:16:35] to get him to jump out the window of
[1:16:36] like a four-story building
[1:16:39] and he would and his friends would have
[1:16:40] to save him from jumping out that's
[1:16:42] witchcraft
[1:16:43] when people take those uh drugs and
[1:16:45] opioids or whatever
[1:16:47] they're they're messing with demons and
[1:16:49] adam will my cousin will tell you that
[1:16:51] he's seen demons he's felt demons when
[1:16:53] he was high on those drugs
[1:16:54] all those years cocaine all that like
[1:16:56] that that's the realm of
[1:16:58] demonic spirits uh
[1:17:02] it's witchcraft and remember he just
[1:17:04] wants to get started on one little one
[1:17:06] like smoking and then i'll get you on
[1:17:08] the next one drinking
[1:17:09] and then the next one marijuana and the
[1:17:11] next one you cocaine and it keeps going
[1:17:13] and going and going
[1:17:14] because he wants to steal kill and
[1:17:15] destroy
[1:17:17] christians will not do that because
[1:17:19] they're going to inherit the kingdom of
[1:17:21] god
[1:17:23] now let's remove the lust of the eyes
[1:17:24] this is a very simple one as well
[1:17:26] now remember lusting of the eyes is very
[1:17:28] close to covetousness
[1:17:31] because you want you covet you often
[1:17:34] covet the things you see
[1:17:36] like right now i'm battling this i'll
[1:17:38] just be honest
[1:17:40] i covet having all my houses the outside
[1:17:43] landscaping looking so beautiful
[1:17:46] i just don't i want to get rid of all
[1:17:47] the weeds you know i'd
[1:17:49] so i've got to be careful like not to go
[1:17:51] overboard on it
[1:17:53] because i just i like things looking
[1:17:54] nice and in order right like at the
[1:17:56] church we want things to be nice and in
[1:17:57] order
[1:17:58] i got to be careful because i drive i
[1:18:00] did i was driving my house was like wow
[1:18:01] look at that landscape and that is
[1:18:03] awesome
[1:18:04] but i gotta remember ah that's just
[1:18:05] temporary they might not even know jesus
[1:18:08] our lives gotta be what's in order
[1:18:10] praise god
[1:18:11] so that's something i have to battle
[1:18:13] just a simple something as simple as
[1:18:15] that
[1:18:16] so sexual attraction is one of the
[1:18:17] biggest lust of the eyes
[1:18:19] right that's what david fell to the lust
[1:18:22] of the eyes caused him to commit
[1:18:24] adultery then murder
[1:18:27] jesus says to look in lust is the same
[1:18:29] as adultery
[1:18:32] property jesus said in the great supper
[1:18:34] parable
[1:18:35] that a man turns down can you imagine
[1:18:37] turning down an invitation to the
[1:18:38] wedding supper of the lamb
[1:18:40] so he can go he said i must first must
[1:18:43] needs go and see
[1:18:44] my recently purchased land in luke 14.
[1:18:47] he wanted to go look at his hills and
[1:18:49] valleys and mountains and say my look
[1:18:51] what i got
[1:18:52] and he turned down the marriage supper
[1:18:54] with christ
[1:18:57] just because he saw the land he saw the
[1:19:00] building he saw the business
[1:19:05] material possessions is another one
[1:19:07] remember uh aiken saw
[1:19:09] the babylonian garment the silver and
[1:19:10] the gold and it led to 36
[1:19:13] israelis dying
[1:19:16] because they lost the next battle they
[1:19:18] tried to fight i think it was a.i
[1:19:21] 36 lusting after the eyes and stealing
[1:19:24] gold silver and babylonian garments
[1:19:26] led to the death of 36 men
[1:19:30] because he couldn't he didn't have
[1:19:31] tempers he couldn't control
[1:19:33] his desire just to look that's a really
[1:19:34] nice jacket and
[1:19:36] tie i think i'll steal those those are
[1:19:38] snake skin belt and i don't believe in
[1:19:40] killing snakes like that but
[1:19:41] they're more expensive oh that's a
[1:19:44] leather oh i'll steal that
[1:19:46] and it proved aiken didn't have the
[1:19:48] temperance that he should have had
[1:19:51] he had it at one point right he had it
[1:19:53] because they crossed over in the
[1:19:54] promised land
[1:19:55] but then he let it come back on he lost
[1:19:56] that temperance
[1:19:59] and so see that's a good example brother
[1:20:01] i want to show this one that's a good
[1:20:02] example sister naomi
[1:20:04] crossing over river jordan was like the
[1:20:06] baptism of the holy ghost right
[1:20:08] because egypt was justification
[1:20:10] wilderness sanctification
[1:20:12] river jordan baptist and holy ghost
[1:20:15] but see you we got to be real careful
[1:20:17] how we use that right
[1:20:19] because aiken had already crossed over
[1:20:22] into baptism holy ghost
[1:20:23] but god swallowed him up into the earth
[1:20:27] so we got to be careful how we use that
[1:20:29] right
[1:20:31] i don't think i don't think how could a
[1:20:33] holy ghost phil person today
[1:20:34] steal gold and treasures and money out
[1:20:37] of people's bank accounts can you
[1:20:38] imagine that
[1:20:39] or steal clothes can you imagine that so
[1:20:42] see we got to be very careful how we use
[1:20:44] our types don't we
[1:20:46] i have to be very careful
[1:20:50] remember financial prospects a lot of
[1:20:52] these are with money
[1:20:54] a lot the bible said he looked towards
[1:20:56] sodom i never set my timer did i
[1:20:58] okay let me set it now give me 10 more
[1:21:00] minutes
[1:21:02] i even got that reminder on my phone i
[1:21:03] forgot to look at it lot
[1:21:05] saw a sodom and he said it looked like
[1:21:08] the garden of eden so he
[1:21:09] pitched his tent towards sodom pretty
[1:21:11] soon he's mayor he's one of the mayors
[1:21:13] or judges of sodom
[1:21:15] sitting in the gates judging and then he
[1:21:18] lost almost everybody's family to the
[1:21:19] fire and brimstone
[1:21:22] almost everybody's family and then we
[1:21:24] know he led to
[1:21:25] incest with his daughters ah
[1:21:28] he should have stayed with abraham's
[1:21:30] seed praise god
[1:21:32] he should but the man said he forgot
[1:21:33] about the promised son amen he forgot
[1:21:35] about jesus's return
[1:21:37] amen balaam
[1:21:40] he was the unfaithful prophet
[1:21:43] and he greedily rejected god's perfect
[1:21:46] will
[1:21:47] uh to seek balak's lucrative offer and
[1:21:49] cause
[1:21:50] israel to stumble
[1:21:54] now let's go to the pride of life i'm
[1:21:55] almost done here
[1:21:57] well maybe a little bit pride of life
[1:22:00] now this is
[1:22:01] interesting now you know what pride of
[1:22:02] life means it means self-promotion
[1:22:06] self-will and self-praise
[1:22:10] so when someone is in the pride of life
[1:22:12] they want to be promoted
[1:22:14] they want to do what they want to do and
[1:22:16] they want to be praised by other people
[1:22:19] always be careful when someone
[1:22:20] compliments you always try to say
[1:22:22] something like well it's by god's grace
[1:22:24] that's what i do try not to accept we
[1:22:27] need to try not to accept praise
[1:22:29] i just said i always try to say this
[1:22:31] john 15 5 without him i can do nothing
[1:22:34] if there's anything good that came out
[1:22:36] of me it wasn't me it was
[1:22:38] christ because pride of life is i will
[1:22:42] like satan i will ascend
[1:22:44] i will exalt my throne i'll go above the
[1:22:46] stars i will do this i will do that
[1:22:50] so see pride of life now i have four
[1:22:52] examples here
[1:22:54] reputation is example of the pride of
[1:22:57] life we want a reputation remember tower
[1:22:59] of babel
[1:23:00] what do they want for the amen to make a
[1:23:02] name for themselves
[1:23:05] pride of life they said let's put brick
[1:23:07] and mortar let's build until they get to
[1:23:09] heaven like brother brooks said they
[1:23:11] they could have got there somehow i
[1:23:12] don't they would have crossed a mention
[1:23:14] somehow
[1:23:15] they were so smart but they wanted to
[1:23:17] make a name for themselves
[1:23:21] herod herod the ruler was smitten by the
[1:23:24] angel
[1:23:24] lord and worms ate him because he
[1:23:27] accepted praise as god
[1:23:30] rather than giving god the glory in acts
[1:23:32] 12 22-23 remember that
[1:23:35] they said oh herod's a god and so the
[1:23:38] bible said god smote him
[1:23:39] ange lord sworn him and the worms ate
[1:23:41] them all up because of the pride of life
[1:23:46] the next pride of life battle is with
[1:23:48] greatness
[1:23:49] the disciples were battling
[1:23:50] self-promotion arguing who's greater
[1:23:54] i'm the greater evangelist i've i'm a
[1:23:56] better preacher
[1:23:58] i i have more miracles i i
[1:24:01] no no me no arguing who's greater
[1:24:05] that's the pride of life king
[1:24:08] nebuchadnezzar
[1:24:09] had to wander with the beasts of the
[1:24:11] field for seven years
[1:24:13] with a beast mind because he believed it
[1:24:15] was his
[1:24:16] own power that established the
[1:24:18] babylonian kingdom
[1:24:20] praise god and i've got to be careful
[1:24:22] too amen if i think well because of me
[1:24:24] look at our church it's not because of
[1:24:26] me if there's anything good of the
[1:24:27] church
[1:24:28] it's because of god's grace i'm just
[1:24:31] doing it
[1:24:31] i just have to be faithful doing my part
[1:24:33] i just have to water praise god
[1:24:35] like i get home i just got to get out
[1:24:37] the hose every week and just let it
[1:24:38] water
[1:24:39] i just got a water that's all i do but
[1:24:41] god's the one who gives life to the
[1:24:43] believers amen
[1:24:45] he's the one that gives life i just work
[1:24:47] in water i just hold the host and turn
[1:24:49] on the host
[1:24:51] do my duty go turn off roll back up the
[1:24:53] hose i'm done
[1:24:56] like the bible said i'll go to sleep
[1:24:58] i'll wake up and they'll be sprung up
[1:25:01] because god is the one who makes us live
[1:25:03] and grow and move amen
[1:25:08] oh i'm so great because my babylonian
[1:25:10] kingdom i'm so great look at my church
[1:25:12] no there's none great but god
[1:25:15] even jesus wouldn't let them call them
[1:25:17] good right he said who you calling good
[1:25:20] there's only one good but god he's
[1:25:22] talking about his flesh
[1:25:24] the next pride of life area is strife
[1:25:26] remember we had up there in the corinths
[1:25:28] the corinth church had strife strife is
[1:25:32] election earring electioneering for your
[1:25:34] office or your promotion
[1:25:36] so it's like it's like politics vote for
[1:25:38] me give me money because i'm trying to
[1:25:40] be the next leader
[1:25:41] they're electioneering right they're
[1:25:43] trying to they're doing politics
[1:25:45] and korah and nathan were doing politics
[1:25:48] trying to become the real priest of god
[1:25:52] so moses said well god's going to show
[1:25:54] who it is let's get that rod out
[1:25:56] remember brother brooks in cambridge on
[1:25:57] that
[1:25:58] let's put that place in the holiest
[1:25:59] voice let's see whose rod
[1:26:01] brings forth in the prince of god amen
[1:26:04] let's see who god vindicates in the
[1:26:06] friends of the lord amen
[1:26:08] let's see whose life produces the real
[1:26:10] fruit of the holy spirit
[1:26:13] that's god's servant
[1:26:20] and then remember king uzziah he tried
[1:26:22] to become a priest
[1:26:24] the bible said he was a godly king he
[1:26:26] did everything right until the end of
[1:26:28] his life
[1:26:29] when he tried to become a priest in
[1:26:32] second chronicles 26
[1:26:34] and the lord smote him with leprosy to
[1:26:36] the day that he died
[1:26:38] oh church i i i want to live by i want
[1:26:40] to remember that one
[1:26:42] i always remember that one in solomon i
[1:26:44] it doesn't matter what i've done for god
[1:26:47] it doesn't matter how good i've served
[1:26:49] god in the past
[1:26:50] i've got to make sure i keep serving god
[1:26:53] in other words i want god to crown my
[1:26:55] life with holiness
[1:26:57] not crying in disgrace
[1:27:01] i want to start strong i'm going to stay
[1:27:04] strong
[1:27:05] and i want to finish strong praise god
[1:27:07] amen
[1:27:10] i don't want to give up at the end and
[1:27:11] lose my temperance
[1:27:14] and then become fleshly and sinful
[1:27:18] and be crowned with disgrace
[1:27:22] and then the last one is murder now we
[1:27:24] don't you know cain
[1:27:25] murdered abel because of his pride of
[1:27:27] life but brother
[1:27:29] says and jesus says we murder people by
[1:27:30] being mad at them and
[1:27:32] damaging their character right
[1:27:36] and that's the pride of life see someone
[1:27:39] attacks somebody else they're accusing
[1:27:41] the brethren
[1:27:41] because they're trying to promote
[1:27:43] themselves or their church or their will
[1:27:46] or they're trying to make you think how
[1:27:48] spiritual they are
[1:27:50] that's why they attack other people
[1:27:57] all right three minutes i'll close with
[1:27:58] this yeah it works out good
[1:28:01] hebrews 1 9 can you put up there
[1:28:05] now i never saw this before until i was
[1:28:07] writing this book
[1:28:10] but both eve and jesus had through the
[1:28:13] threefold temptations
[1:28:16] jesus overcame while eve fell
[1:28:20] eve was tempted with the lust of the
[1:28:22] flesh because the tree was good
[1:28:24] for food see lust of the flesh
[1:28:28] food right she was tempted with the lust
[1:28:31] of the eyes because the tree was
[1:28:32] pleasant to the eyes
[1:28:36] and eve fell to the pride of life
[1:28:38] because the tree would make her
[1:28:40] wise i can be like god i will be like
[1:28:44] god
[1:28:46] and she fell in all three areas
[1:28:50] oh but thank god there came the woman's
[1:28:52] sea
[1:28:53] later the seat of the woman jesus christ
[1:28:56] born of a virgin amen
[1:28:59] and jesus came by and it was the
[1:29:01] greatest temptation
[1:29:03] ever on a man this wasn't just some
[1:29:05] other lust demon or
[1:29:06] this wasn't just a drunk demon or
[1:29:08] something like that
[1:29:09] this was satan himself
[1:29:14] the old serpent the old dragon
[1:29:18] himself satan himself and jesus was
[1:29:21] tired
[1:29:22] and hungry and thirsty after 40 days
[1:29:26] and in this weak state he still overcame
[1:29:28] because of this right here
[1:29:30] he still overcame because why
[1:29:34] he loved righteousness
[1:29:37] more and he hated iniquity amen
[1:29:41] he loved to obey god
[1:29:46] see you and i we will overcome
[1:29:49] satan every time if we love
[1:29:52] to obey more than we love to give into
[1:29:54] the flesh
[1:29:57] and remember to always be love that
[1:29:59] determines all your actions
[1:30:01] because faith works by love amen
[1:30:05] this proves it right here the reason
[1:30:07] jesus turned him down
[1:30:09] about the future kingdoms and the stone
[1:30:11] of bread and doing a miracle
[1:30:13] and trying to do all these the reason he
[1:30:15] turned him down to all three areas
[1:30:17] because he loved his father and he loved
[1:30:19] to make his father happy praise god
[1:30:23] love oh this is beautiful ah look at
[1:30:26] that
[1:30:27] iniquity is purposely transgressing you
[1:30:30] know it's wrong
[1:30:31] and yet you do it that's called iniquity
[1:30:34] and jesus had a choice i either do
[1:30:36] righteousness
[1:30:37] or i do iniquity which one did he love
[1:30:40] more he loved to obey more
[1:30:43] that's one thing satan can never do he
[1:30:45] can never
[1:30:46] love god amen he can never love the word
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:51] but you and i love the word that's what
[1:30:54] separates us from satan and all the
[1:30:56] demons and all the lukewarm
[1:30:58] we love to obey god's word
[1:31:01] it's all based upon love
[1:31:04] let's stand to our feet
[1:31:09] jesus overcame
[1:31:13] by love
[1:31:16] love always overcomes
[1:31:21] now let me here's a real thought that
[1:31:22] struck me by amen i think you'll like it
[1:31:25] jesus said thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:31:27] thy god in other words don't test
[1:31:30] god with miracles but god did say to
[1:31:32] test him with a couple of things
[1:31:35] ties and offerings amen
[1:31:38] hallelujah there's times you test god
[1:31:41] church
[1:31:42] not with miracles now you test him with
[1:31:45] your finances
[1:31:47] that's where you test him is that right
[1:31:50] he said prove me see if i won't pour
[1:31:52] open the gates
[1:31:53] right the the windows of heaven and pour
[1:31:56] out the blessing that's a fresh
[1:31:58] revelation that came to me when i was
[1:31:59] writing
[1:31:59] my there are times you test the lord he
[1:32:02] said
[1:32:03] prove me and see if i won't do it praise
[1:32:05] god
[1:32:07] oh i love the word don't you church ah
[1:32:11] the lesson is
[1:32:14] quoting and obeying the word defeats
[1:32:17] satan
[1:32:17] anytime anyplace anywhere
[1:32:21] and if you speak god's word love god's
[1:32:23] word stand
[1:32:24] upon god's word satan will leave us for
[1:32:27] a season
[1:32:29] and he'll never give you a test that you
[1:32:31] can't overcome
[1:32:34] you'll always have the ability to break
[1:32:36] through that
[1:32:37] and love righteousness and obey it
[1:32:40] instead of giving in to the flesh
[1:32:44] how many of you want to be a more
[1:32:45] spiritual christian
[1:32:48] i want preachers to come in like cam and
[1:32:50] brother brooks and simon and say this is
[1:32:51] a real
[1:32:53] spiritual church i want them to be able
[1:32:56] to say wow
[1:32:57] i gotta the lord gave me some deep
[1:32:59] things when i was studying last night
[1:33:01] because i
[1:33:02] you guys can't i mean you're beyond milk
[1:33:04] you could handle milk but
[1:33:06] you wanted something deeper than just
[1:33:07] milk that's what i want to see when
[1:33:09] guest preachers come in when i come to
[1:33:11] the pulpit
[1:33:11] i want to feel such a liberty that we
[1:33:13] can go deep in the deep things of god
[1:33:16] and discern right from wrong in our
[1:33:18] daily lives
[1:33:20] so we can grow to be more like christ
[1:33:23] rather than backslide into a lukewarm
[1:33:26] condition where there's no spiritual
[1:33:29] hunger anymore we're hungering more for
[1:33:31] the things of the world
[1:33:33] let's hunger and thirst after
[1:33:34] righteousness musicians if you'll come
[1:33:37] lord willing on sunday we'll look at the
[1:33:39] fruit of temperance did you know that
[1:33:41] there's a attribute of temperance and
[1:33:43] the statue of man but then there's a
[1:33:45] fruit of temperance
[1:33:46] it's just like faith faith is an
[1:33:48] attribute on the status perfect man but
[1:33:50] there's also a fruit of faith
[1:33:53] same thing with temperance in other
[1:33:55] words there's a
[1:33:56] very mature level of temperance
[1:33:59] that only holy ghost-filled saints
[1:34:02] experience
[1:34:03] that's what i want to experience i know
[1:34:06] it's going to be hard
[1:34:07] haven is going to be tough but if i'm
[1:34:10] faithful to the lord
[1:34:11] he'll help me to be able to bring my
[1:34:15] body into subjection
[1:34:17] instead of feeding my flesh so much i'll
[1:34:20] be able to feed my soul more
[1:34:23] that's what i love about you know i'm
[1:34:24] working outside more i'm trying to get a
[1:34:26] little tan here you know
[1:34:28] but i get to listen to sermons while i'm
[1:34:30] doing i put those headphones on
[1:34:31] i get to listen to sermons so it's all
[1:34:33] jesus that's like a two
[1:34:35] two three hours of sermon listening to
[1:34:36] the lord listening to his words singing
[1:34:39] his songs praising them that's one thing
[1:34:41] i love about working outside
[1:34:42] i just gotta make sure i don't get my
[1:34:44] eyes in the lust of the eyes
[1:34:46] not trying to make it you know fancy
[1:34:50] but just trying to keep all the land
[1:34:52] under control i'll say it like that
[1:34:54] keep it under control
[1:34:58] let's bow our heads for a moment church
[1:35:03] we only overcome by love
[1:35:07] satan will never love god he'll never
[1:35:10] love the word
[1:35:11] but that's where we're different we love
[1:35:13] the word
[1:35:15] we love to obey
[1:35:20] let's pray that god will help us to hate
[1:35:22] iniquity more
[1:35:24] and more and yet we'll grow in love
[1:35:28] for god will love righteousness
[1:35:31] more and more now as
[1:35:34] we pray i went through these areas i'm
[1:35:36] just going to read them real quick
