scripture tonight by god's grace i've been getting progressively longer with my sermons and i'm trying to go the other way actually so let's uh go uh right to the word of god let's go to ephesians 5 32 and then we'll do the memory verse brother vang had you know i want to read that on sunday i just forgot with brother brian here and everything i just forgot to do that so i apologize about that uh ephesians 5 32. then we'll read ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. ephesians 5 32. it's a great mystery that jesus would want to choose us as his bride isn't it people that's in or people that's fallible people that make mistakes but nevertheless he chose he chose us he saved us he sanctified us he filled us with the holy ghost and he's continually washing us by the waters of his word what a blessing our lord is so gracious so merciful let's read ephesians 5 32 on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church praise god go to ecclesiastes 12 1 please ecclesiastes 12 1. great scripture for our youth here our children and teenagers great great scripture for them hopefully everybody's recovered from uh the daylight savings everybody recovered we're still trying to recover at our house i don't know about you guys but we're still trying to recover thank the lord for his grace amen ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. let's read that together saints ready one two three remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them amen let's have a word of prayer let's ask god to minister to us tonight we had a wonderful service last weekend and then last wednesday with a wonderful service let's ask god to bless us here tonight in his presence heavenly father we just come reverently lord god we're happy lord to be in your house tonight oh lord how will you think about lord wanting to be in that number when the saints go marching when the bride goes marching in and hear what orb we've been preaching this is our 11th service on the bride the mystery of the church as the bride lord we're just grateful lord that you would call us we're not worthy but lord we're grateful lord that you call us save us sanctifies fill us with the holy ghost and each week and each day continually wash us in the waters of your word we're grateful lord and father as we've gone through these messages lord we can truly see how there has to be a bride church somewhere lord god everyone's claiming to be the whole book of revelation is about a true bride and then an imposter bride lord the whole the whole plan of redemption is about this subject there's got to be a true bride and lord by your grace we believe we're a part of that so father wash us here tonight and and bless us and help us lord god lead and guide me on nothing without you i never was anything i never will be anything only lord if you can just use me lord in some humble little way and bless your people use them tonight as well father for we know there's all nine gifts here today lord god and father we want to be in tune with your holy spirit and father we want to do your will for your glory and so lord we thank you for your grace and mercy tonight let the holy spirit have preeminence we pray in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god okay so tonight we'll look at uh more on the church as the bride we'll probably have a couple more services on this one i forgot to let the church know on sunday too i put a new youtube video out on sunday afternoon and it's about the sixth vision is the sixth vision fulfilled and my answer is no i don't think so at least not yet it's in the process of coming to pass so i've got i got some good feedback on that and people really appreciate that so i've been thankful i'll just try to rehearse it real quick i don't think the fourth vision is fulfilled because brother branham said the church age book we're still awaiting the road systems uh we don't even have the driverless cars yet we're getting close there's a couple uh the waymo company out there in arizona and california they do have driverless cars right now but it's just they're kind of testing them um but the road systems brother ramsay were still awaiting them so they weren't on the scene yet and he said they're either all come to pass or they're in the process of coming to pass the fifth vision now brother brown said to be a fifth vision would be a state of undress amongst the women now this one i don't know i still don't think it's fulfilled but it could be um i was thinking more like you know brother ram saw the vision of the women that had like he said plastic transparent dresses that had three spots darken you know the three main parts of a woman there uh i would just think that would be more like a public thing but it could be we are in the state of undress could be i don't know i just felt like if he saw the vision that we'd have to see it i don't know anybody that's seen that out in public um so that's what i put on there and then i just don't think the sixth vision is fulfilled brother bram said to be a most beautiful woman most beautiful woman most people don't think she's very beautiful miss harris uh the other thing was brother braham said she'd get in by a popular vote of women and we know there was voter fraud and we know they didn't win the election they did all the fraud to win the election that's that's all the facts are true there uh what was the third one there there was no one more thing i thought about oh she doesn't have she doesn't have total power uh the vision said the whole nation would bow to this woman and bowing in the bible's worship because every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that jesus is lord so the nation has to bow and confess whatever this beautiful woman is whether she's the catholic church or a future woman president or something like that i just don't think based upon those details of the vision that it's fulfilled of course a lot of people do what happens with most message people they a lot not most i should say some they want to try to jump ahead and they want to be the first to have a revelation right they want to be the first i was the first one that knew the prophecy was fulfilled or something but i think it's always best to wait i just found that it's best to wait everybody's jumped to all these conclusions and thought well that's 2009 or 2015 and 2018 they all make all these guesses and i just don't want to get in the habit of that i want to i just wait upon the lord so i just put that out recently hope that would be a blessing to us i've kind of preached it here next i'm working on the clarence larkin video i'm going to show brother brandon used clarence larkin quite a bit and he didn't always reference him but it's not plagiarism because plagiarism is when you you steal it and you don't mention it and you say it was all original but we have so many quotes brother brahms says uh he used all these books he names at least six or seven books at the beginning of preaching the church age book he lists he says there's about six or seven he lists three or four um and you can see the exact quotes i have i have larkin's book electronically you can see the exact quotes brother brandon used many exact quotes from clarence larkin but then there's a quote brother ram said i'm very grateful to dr larkin for his views so there's a quote on that but they're making it sound like he plagiarized everything and uh and said brother branham uh never referenced him well he did it just wasn't exactly in every sermon he didn't reference him but there was numerous times he did reference the people he used and church remember a seventh grade educated man probably can't write a good document right and reference everything he's not that scholarly trained right uh now level may have been maybe libreo should have been if he was a real doctor i don't know if he was or not um so yeah maybe that was more of maybe that was more of lee vale's kind of failure there i don't know i wasn't there just that you know that's kind of what we're studying on next by god's grace so praise the lord well i want to just start with st patrick since today's st patrick's day america has totally lost the reasoning behind the saint patrick's day today it's a day of folly it's a day of drunkenness it's a day of revelry it's an absolute disgrace to the man who was a saint saint patrick so i studied on him this summer and i used uh one resource it was hazeltine rachel hazeltine it's the book she's the woman historian brother branham used in the church ages in fact that was the most uh history i found that's the resource brother brad used most was rachel hasselton and he says it in there a woman he said rachel has a time so brother ram read a woman's book to get a lot of the genuine history so let's just go over this real quick uh he lived from 372 to 461 uh a.d his given name was suckat or sukkat he's a saint from the pergamian age and like jesus said he held on jesus name and he kept his faith because that was the command of the church age patrick was robbed of his childhood i think he was well they say around 14. one article says 14 but he was robbed of his childhood in a way he and his two sisters were kidnapped and sold as slaves and patrick was taken to northern ireland to herd swine and he used dogs there but it was there in ireland where he repented and he was converted by god's spirit history says he didn't have any man there to preach to him so god converted him praise god god came looking for him amen and he converted there as a swine herder well with dogs and uh history says that uh then the holy spirit told him your ship awaits you and so he went to get on his ship and then brother brown said he had the dogs trained so well he he kind of sold the dogs to the shipmaster but then he snuck on and hit himself and had he had a certain noise for the dogs to kind of hide him but once the boat was off and then he he gave the signal and the dogs went crazy and everything and and uh he said the dogs are going to destroy everything unless you let me go on the on the ride or on the boat that was heading back to england and so he said of course we'll let you stay and so then he got the dogs back under control when he got back to england he then went to france and he enrolled in his uncle martin's bible school this is the same martin who was the church age messenger to the pergamon church age and let me get a little bit about martin just a little bit martin was such a mighty man of god uh he was taught by saint hillary well he's not called saint but hillary uh from france he was a mighty man of god he converted his pagan mother and sister to christianity this is martin now the church age messenger and then he built a school and this was a school plus a prayer chapel and so many men were trained up of god in this school and sent forth from uh by the holy spirit to do great works in jesus name there in france god performed so many miracles in martin's ministry uh it was because he didn't dedicate himself to prayer study uh fasting uh now this is the history from hazeltine again brother madam use hazeltine uh god used such great miracles that the laws of nature were defied and they they were used by god used martin to stand against idolatry and you probably you might remember this from the church ages uh doors were supernaturally opened just based upon martin's prayer so doors of us of a city or structure compound were opened by the power of god and history says golden light actually shone from his body and the dead were raised to life so it's like moses how he was shown the light shone this is what the rachel hasselton wrote he has literal history of him his face shining with the glory of god and they'd ra he'd raise the dead she said the best way to describe his life from his conversion to his death was one constant miracle how would you like that to be the description of your life one it was just one miracle from the time he got saved all the way till he died he was his life was a constant miracle uh he traveled 300 miles to plead with spanish bishops for the life of one friend he drove or he traveled three not drove it might have drove horses but he traveled 300 miles to plead for one soul of one friend he refused any fellowship with the first church of rome he saw how rome's man-made creeds their idolatry their killing their lies left the roman church powerless of the holy spirit and as a testament to the holy ghost on him many sick touched his tomb and were healed and just like elisha's bones in second kings 13 21 and this says he was uh never canonized by rome but he was canonized by god amen now that's martin right that's that's patrick's uncle patrick's uncle now let's get back to patrick so after patrick got on the boat there the dogs covered him and he got on loose he went to his uh uncle martin's bible school he grew in grace and faith and then he had the leadership of the holy ghost to take the gospel to ireland where he was once a slave and he took many ministers over there as well and they saw the holy ghost do many miraculous miracles in fact one barbarian chief one of the first ones he saw so many miracles in patrick's life that he and his entire house repented and received christ imagine a whole family repenting a heathen just heathen plain heathens on ireland's uh the isle there the emerald isle they repented just because they saw a miracle after miracle after miracle in a man's life amen beautiful testimony of patrick history records also uh that he took up serpents we know there's a lot of serpents on uh the ir the isle of ireland but he took up many and he was never hurt by them just like jesus said you'll take up serpents and they will not hurt you he laid on his hands on the sick and they recovered by jesus's faith just like his uncle martin did one time patrick was approached by an embassy from rome and they wanted him to come visit but he refused because they knew their wickedness he knew they were going to try to get him to compromise right that's what they always do they try to give you money and power and authority but he turned them down flatly imagine that he turned out all those uh money all the prestige all the power he turned that down and he just stayed there in ireland for god's glory in fact it is believed the entire island received the pure gospel of the lord jesus christ through patrick's efforts that's hasselton's history there the whole island receive the gospel now sadly a hundred thousand of patrick's spiritual children were slaughtered through the roman jesuits in 1640. so that was about 164. that was about 1200 years after his death so see because rome couldn't get him uh they came 1200 years later and just destroyed the whole island well not the line but i'm sorry destroyed 100 000 of a spiritual converts but church we know if you have genuine faith in jesus christ's name then you receive a martyr's crown in heaven amen a hundred thousand so that if that was just a hundred thousand of his uh converts uh were were martyred there how many more converts to that one man have that one man have and that's the history i got from hassletime now today it's all it's all tommy rock can i say it like that uh the the chicago uh the city of chicago put green dye in the river today right to celebrate they do that to celebrate all the irish people in chicago they'll they'll spray their hair green right uh though the kids today all the kids come in today dressed like leprechauns or and the teachers act like leprechauns invaded the school we had a teacher that does that every year they kick over their trash and they put glitter and and stars everywhere and today there's nothing about it there's nothing about patrick as really being a man of god that he was but this was a man who cast out devils this was the man who prayed for the sick and they recovered this is a man that was bitten by serpents and just like paul cast him down and never had a problem because he was a man filled with the holy ghost and fire amen but they leave all that out right they leave all that out they forget that this is the reason why we rej or america had a holiday for this man because he left everything and he converted an entire island for the gospel of jesus christ amen so that's the reason why this nation started uh honoring this man not because of leprechauns and shamrocks and things like that now it was said that he didn't teach you know god was a father-son holy ghost uh through the shamrock they do say that which that that that's actually closer than that's that's actually pretty close right three manifestations it's still one it's still one plant right it's still one uh leaf but it's got three parts to it that's right god is one person but he's got three manifestations right or three offices brother ram says so you can still use that it's not three separate plants right it's one plant god's not three persons he's one person amen so we see a great uh a great example of christianity from uh patrick a wonderful man of god and broadband talks about him a lot in the church age book as well so uh that's that's great okay now we'll move on here let's go back to the uh the mystery of uh the church as the bride so let's see i got give me 30 minutes here we'll preach about 30 minutes on this okay you've got your bibles uh let's go to first samuel let's look at hannah we ended with macau or i'm not sure exactly how to say that macau last week and it taught us that we should get in the spirit we should be loudly worshiping praying at times there's times to be quiet of course there's a time and season for everything praise god and we should use our bodies our emotions despite any reproach that anybody says and let's not be a judas iscariot or a macao let's be a david who gets in the holy ghost praise god that's a great lesson to learn churches that don't do that they will be blind i'm sorry they'll be barren childless and no one ever be born again by the holy ghost we've got to be the ones uh that pray through right that cry out that that that shout and holler amen and don't mind uh how we act right we we want to forget when anybody's around we just want to make sure we know jesus is around praise god we just want to act like jesus is in the house praise god amen the bible said wherever jesus went it was noise abroad that he was there right you couldn't keep him quiet right because they knew jesus was there so you couldn't keep people quiet they just oh jesus is coming the healer's coming the messiah is coming the savior's coming the son of david's coming you couldn't keep them quiet because jesus was a man of power amen a man of love amen thank god okay so we look at hannah let's look at hannah now what does hannah teach the bride today hannah was the wife of alcanna and mother of the prophet samuel and she's best known for desperately and emotionally seeking god for a child that uh she wouldn't be barren right she's known for pouring out her soul before the lord in prayer for a natural child for a natural child right eli then comes in while she's praying and mistakes her emotion for drunkenness that's a great type on the day of pentecost he said what are these new wine they say we're not drunk this is what joel said this is that which joel spoke of praise god i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh amen see there's a great connection there to being filled with the holy ghost and looking like a drunk person praise god that's why we believe if someone gets the holy ghost something's got to happen to them some type of emotion something has to happen because even here it was foreshadowed it was typed that some emotional change has to happen right if you because remember that's what the holy ghost is it's a nature change right god bless you nature that's a great name it's a nature change and brother said your nature is dead and dead in sin until the holy ghost comes and then you get a holy nature praise god you get life you get god's life as your nature amen and so how can something not happen praise god right something has to happen when the nature goes from death the bible said dead in sins right and then but then you get the nature the name the the soul gets quickened made alive by the holy spirit something has to happen praise god amen but eli thinks oh she's just drunk and she's no she said i'm pouring out my soul before the lord that's why i encourage young people our teenagers that's what you gotta do you gotta seek god and you gotta pour out your soul you gotta get in desperation from the holy spirit praise god it's something you gotta be desperate and it's just not something you walk into it's something you're seeking you're seeking the new birth you're seeking to be born again praise god you're desperate you're hungry jesus said you got to be hungry and thirsty for righteousness amen it's something you got to move into right just like a natural birth it's something the woman has moved into right uh the birth pains get shorter it's a it's just something that takes over the woman right it's something natural something inside and that's what the the birth pains of being born again they get closer and closer until they're born again of the holy spirit amen hallelujah and because eli sees this after he listens to her explain her desire he gets led by the holy spirit and he says god's heard you god's approved of and he's going to answer your requests and your vow think about that man this this man later you know he he got too heavy he ate too much food didn't take care of himself lost his eyesight uh was almost blinded but at this spot of his life he was still he could still uh discern the holy spirit and he got anointed by the holy spirit and basically prophesied and said you you have what you asked for of course we know according to time of life uh she conceived hannah conceived brought forth samuel and she weaned samuel uh until she took him there to leave him at the house of god what kind of amazing faith is that praise god lord if you give me a son i'll give him back to you and i'm just not talking a prayer of dedication i'm talking about i'm going to leave him in the house of god for service that's real desperation praise god reminds us of that one gentleman who made the desperate vow for his daughter i can't remember his name now was it jaffna jeff jeffna i could never say that name jeff not now i don't believe she was killed i just believe she lost the ability to be uh married that's what i believe as far as because why would god ask a you know a husband or a daddy to keep his word you know to lose his daughter i don't i don't see how that could be in the scripture but anyways hannah here keeps her promise and after samuel's wean she sews in mako a prisco and ephodon and takes him to the house of god right it's such a beautiful story of uh of this is uh spiritually what we've got to do as parents we've got to raise our children and we've got to put them in the hands of god god i don't know that's what my mom told me i was talking to my mom last year and i said mom how did you you know because i was talking about lydia i said how can i let lydia get a car you know how can i let her drive a car you know she's my baby you know and my mom's like jesse you just got to pray and let him go in the hands of god i'm like easier said than done uh you know because my mom drove me to akron and dropped me off after 18 years to have me she just dropped me off and left me i don't know how she did that that takes a special kind of love i guess with your you naomi and wesley leaving their parents you know they can kind of their parents can relate to that leaving everything and that was it was difficult but that's what hannah did she was she if amen if god was going to keep his word she was going to keep her word amen hallelujah that's what we should do if we make a promise we ought to keep it by god's grace amen now for time's sake i guess i won't read that but here's the lessons we learned we learned the value of natural children and spiritual children i preached on this many times but most churches allow the killing of babies through abortion pills right and i put that in the book so that people will be able to see that but true churches of god they despise natural death right they despise that and they value all life because we're children of life amen remember birth control pills prevent fertilized uh embryos from attaching to the uterine wall that's the natural but spiritual bride churches are desperate to see new life come forth uh in the natural and spiritual womb of the church praise god like there's a church not there's a church up here mega church used to be a mega church just a few miles up the road on route 77. uh and then you go on route 8. there's a church up there it used to be big time during the 50s and 60s that's the one that has the restaurant that wasn't finished i'm not sure if you know which one i'm talking about it was the one of the first uh churches on tv so it's like uh it was like the original mega church well after that original gentleman left the guy that came in had all those people and he told them the lord is so so near he said don't have any children. and out of that has come forth some really wicked things they have now they have i think over 20 abuse cases where the pastor and the different ones there have abused people and it's been really awful and now look how the devil the man says uh if the devil can't get you from seeing the truth he'll push you real far off on it so they were able to see the coming of the lord is soon of course they don't follow brother or anything like that but because uh they still love the things of the world the devil is able to push them over to the side of well don't have children the rapture is going to come and now most of that generation is dying all that all that generation that didn't have kids they're dying look there's no their their name is not carried on right they have no inheritance right they have no offspring to kind of carry on the name and and be uh the next generation for jesus in other words the church is dying right but we don't know when jesus is coming so we gotta pray we gotta put footprints in the sands of time in case there is another generation praise god but see that church is gonna die and there's nobody to carry on the torch for jesus because they're all not deceived right and it's going to be hard for any many of those any of them to be saved because they went so far also on this false doctrine and now it's tied to money and saying on the tv but they started out good it was a blessing brother brothers were telling me there's a blessing when it was the original was old-fashioned and and they prayed and they they really preached the gospel simple gospel get saved repent be baptized fill with the spirit but see that's what happened when a church despises the natural babies but church we don't despise the natural we receive the natural praise god but here's what we have to do we have to be more desperate for spiritual babies being born that's what we've got to do i know i said last week how many there's been numerous times three or four times i prayed lord send the holy ghost to akron for jesus's sake now i think after each time somebody did get filled with the holy ghost and so i want to be led by the holy spirit uh to have a burden for that praise god because if somebody's really filled with the holy ghost you'll see their new life right it's a new life it's uh like we said a nature that was dead but now it's a living nature it's god's nature praise god and it just brings new life into the church praise god amen so see we learn these lessons from hannah's life if we want to see life in the natural or life in the spiritual we got to be desperate for the lord now remember jose and i prayed for two barren couples and we desperately prayed in tears and god heard both of them and now they can quote and i think that one of them sent me this quote first samuel 1 27 for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him praise god amen hallelujah that's right natural couples i wonder the couple share that with me for this child i prayed amen and god has given me the petition which i ask how many thankful that god hears our prayers remember the bible said children are a reward not a trial children are a reward if you love them if you don't love them there'll be a trial if you love them they'll be a blessing praise god i know i was a child of my mom so mom forgive me making a heart on you if i ever made a heart on you i'm sure i did a couple times probably more than that but the word reward in hebrew means a payment of a contract or a salary your children are your salary from the lord amen we're singing that song i'm rich but not from satan wages [Laughter] i think about that till right now amen i'm rich in these little arrows the lord has given me praise god my wife and i thank the lord they're a reward of the lord at psalms 127 the fruit of the womb is his reward or salary from god praise god like my mom was telling me the last time i remember when she had that kidney stone she said uh you know she was talking about the different blessings all the children have been so one of my brothers he while she went into the hospital to get the the surgery my one of my brothers sat in the parking lot all night and just stayed awake all night just sat there and praying and waiting for my mom to come out and then when she come out uh he picked her up and took her to my sister's house and then my sister took care of him she said i couldn't be taken care of any better i just look at that and then you know my mom told me about some of the other brothers that have helped with money and and plumbing and all these things and it proves that children are a reward they're a payment praise god they're god's payment god's blessing to you as his servants amen praise god so my mom in other words was telling me all the salary she's earned from having all these kids praise god so that's what the word says the bible said they're a payment and what's interesting too i just got my irs payment this morning from the government and it's a it's a larger sum because i have more children so it's just interesting how things work out when i'm preaching on that today i'm just planning on preaching that this is the day it comes in the the bank account interesting all right so now get your bible if you would go to galatians 4 19. this is a very peculiar scripture rush maybe interesting or i should say maybe mysterious would be the better word so lydia get galatians 419 malachi hebrews 4 1. would you um lydia galatians 4 19 and then malachi hebrews 4 verse 1. now before we read this as i said church we've got to be willing to pray earnestly for new converts to be born again by the holy ghost baptism because acts chapters 1 and 2 show 120 converts the bible said they went into an upper room now i don't know what kind of room what size of a room do you need to fit 120 men and women in how many chairs do we have here like 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 nine does one two three four five so we have less than 45 chairs in here what kind of room what kind of upper room do you need to fit 120 people in for 10 days 10 days what was the size of this room but the bible said they sat there the bible said they prayed the bible said they tarry no doubt they sang no doubt they ate but the bible said when they were sitting just sitting around the holy ghost came sweeping in like a rushing mighty wind praise god amen it just swept through and that's what hula said who has said when she got here that one time she felt the holy spirit just come through this wall struck her and she got healed of the flu but brother amen did it which that's all right that happens she felt the wind come through amen that was when brother cam was here a couple times ago probably about two years by now but look they gathered there they prayed and they're just waiting earnestly sincerely waiting upon the promise praise god so that takes a lot of sincerity to wait that long and wait for the holy spirit to come right so so bride churches have to be willing to go to great lengths to be born again because going just going to church and just doing your regular thing that's not enough we got to die to ourselves praise god you got to really hunger for it you really got to thirst for you really got to want to be filled with god's life amen god's power now lydia read this one uh this is an interesting scripture so read this one i say it's mysterious what an amazing scripture now remember this is the this is the same church that was formed i believe it was formed right after the philippian church paul left there and then he went there later to galatia i think maybe a couple trips later it was on one of the stops on that third missionary journey right uh but look what he says now this is chapter four remember chapter one he said if you preach anything outside of christ you're cursed right and then remember chapter two he had to correct peter to his face then chapter three talks about circumcision the church got got the holy spirit to visit them but then they started accepting legalism back into the church and he says these amazing statements here my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you now we know ephesians 4 30 you're sealed until when the next revival the next time brother cam comes the next time brother brooks comes is that the night is that when you're sealed to no you're seeing to the day you get a body change amen but paul's saying look i've got a travail where i've got to be in birth pains again until christ be formed in you so in other words they didn't get the holy ghost some of them didn't get the holy ghost the first time he was there think about that they had the holy spirit father no doubt there were signs wonders and miracles because remember paul says it in this chapter he says did you receive the holy ghost by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith remember that so they had miracle workers there there was people that had the holy ghost ministering through gifts and everything like that but he said i'm gonna have to travail again we gotta go back in other words we gotta go back to the altar amen we gotta go back to praying we gotta go back to seeking the holy spirit so you guys can get born again that's what he said so until christ be formed in you because that's what it's about christ in you the hope of glory christ dwelling in our hearts by faith amen glory so what is it going to take it's going to take like a hannah anointing that's why brother cam and brother brooks came last june that's why it was such a great service because they just labored they labored through all the people remember they prayed for that they just labored through all the people that wanted prayer for the holy ghost and i was so exhausted and tired i could hardly pray i just prayed a little bit because i was totally worn out mentally i was worn out and exhausted but i'm thankful that they were laboring in prayer for all of our uh children all the visitors that come up for prayer i think that was mostly children that come up oh yeah brother uh joe joe carter came up for prayer that's right now malachi read hebrews 4 1 because this uh connects to it keep that up there remember this chapter this is the chapter about joshua in jesus right he was showing how israel never entered into the real rest the rest of the soul and he said if joshua had given them the rest then there would not be a need to talk about another rest but he said you can't come short of the promised land of the baptism of the holy ghost so church we've got to have this desire that we do not fall short of being born again because that's what paul found out in galatians 4 they come short they come all the way up to kadesh barnea but never entered in never crossed over jordan and so we got to be willing to labor with people for that desire amen so what does hannah teach us we need to love natural children and we got to desperately cry out for spiritual children as well when i was up in new york the last time it must have been 2018 the pastor up there was telling me his uh adult daughter yeah she i think was 18 or 19. she was going worldly and astray she wasn't married anything but she was really getting into uh maybe some bad i can't remember what the sin was it doesn't matter but anyways her her wife i'm sorry his wife felt led to go down into their basement and pray and fast and she prayed and fasted for three days she would just come up just to go to sleep she just was down there listening to sermons the whole time praying this is in new york and i've been to their house it's nice downstairs it's just like a regular downstairs you know where there's couches in there it's a nice downstairs pictures all over the wall but she was down there for three days on the third day that a 19 year old daughter came home and i think she was wearing pants i think at this point no she was raising the message uh she just went into her room she broke down started crying and then her dad went in there and then her mom came up at that same time and they came to see the daughter to see what was wrong and she said i'm ready to repent i'm ready they said they got right down there on their knees and prayed and they said she got the holy ghost right there but that mother fasted for three days now does that sound like hannah does that sound like hand in the bible just we pouring out ours oh oh god fill my children with the holy ghost fill my my mother or my wife or my husband or my grandfather my dad fill them with the holy ghost they had to get desperate praise god that's what we need more of amen now of course there'll be times and seasons there's always a time and season for a birth and the church said right you can't if the baby's on the way you can't make it come when you want to right there's a time and season for it but as that time approaches that people should be hungry and thirsting for that that's why i always like i always like to fast and pray on sunday mornings you just think that's usually the height the highlight service right where everybody's really dialed in and there's a real sincerity a lot of good anointing i always want to be ready because a couple of times people have received the holy ghost when i prayed for him after service amen and i always want to be ready to have uh my body in that in that uh that that that mindset i always wanted to have a body that's uh feasting spiritually and i've got zeal of the lord and i'm not tired from eating supper i'm not tired from uh anything carnal i'm having a spiritual feast amen and then i'm able to labor to enter into that rest pray because that's what happened with sister who got the holy ghost remember we prayed the first time remember that lydia uh we dismissed and didn't seem like you know anything happened and uh then lydia came in to want to pray for the holy ghost i come back out and i said you know what let's pray for sister who again we pray we all got down there together and we know the holy ghost fell right there praise god so it took a second prayer amen took a second time seeking the lord so never feel bad i didn't get the holy ghost the first time i i prayed for i prayed for it numerous times i didn't get the holy ghost the first time in fact that one day i think i told you in my college house once all my buddies were out i was on saturday night i remember on saturday night because the next day was a sunday i just went to my upper room there i got on my knees and i shouted and screamed and cried god come in here fill me with the holy ghost i was expecting angels to come in i was expecting to see a light it didn't happen that day but it happened months later but i was seeking for it i was i was generally i genuinely wanted to be filled with the holy ghost i wanted to know that life had come in me praise god and i was crying out for it i wouldn't be born again i want to i want to know that christ is in me i want the life of jesus in me praise god so you got to be desperate for it it's got to be something you're hungry and thirsting for it's got to be more to life it's got to be more it's gotta mean more than life to you that's what hannah teaches us what a lesson from hannah she's willing to go to the house of god and just pour out her soul god i want the holy ghost more than anything praise god that's what we learned from a saint like hannah as malachi said as he read there from hebrews we must be careful not to fall short of it we've got to enter into the promised land so church what do we learn from paul's example legalism and any church that reverts instead of going on with the holy ghost like say like this instead of going higher and higher with the holy ghost when people go lower and lower and go into legalism and man-made creeds that proves they were never born again to begin with like all the message preachers that have fallen away that prove they were never born again in the first place because they went into legalism or they went into criticizing brother branham or basically blaspheming brother branham and then the bible and jesus right if they go into that type of behavior it proves they were never born again in the first place and then we'd have to echo the words of paul we need to travail and birth again until you get christ born in you praise god amen we've got to try that birth again praise god because they never got the original birth all right how much time i got five minutes okay i'm just gonna stay on this thought here i'm just gonna yeah i'm gonna just preach here you know i'm not even gonna close my notes i'm just gonna prank for a little bit the greatest meetings i've ever preached anywhere have been when i preach on the baptism of the holy ghost i've never seen greater meanings in those meetings uh we had a four or five hour service over there in albion when i preached on uh the baptism of the holy ghost and i thought it is so and it's nothing that i ever planned out i just i i i studied one day or one actually maybe i studied for a week or whatever on the baptism of the holy ghost how do i receive the holy ghost and i just showed all the scriptures where there was wonderful works shouting speaking in tongues prophesying rejoicing boldness i just showed every all the examples there's five examples in the book of acts right and you showed all of those and so church i've learned the message god likes the most that i've ever preached that he's ever given me is the one about being born amen the one about being born into his family god loves the sermons on the birth amen like cam right when cam came last last summer that was the that was the most anointed service i think i've ever been in our church was he preaching on the holiest of holies the baptism of the holy ghost i know jesus likes that why because that's where you mean him amen that's where you meet him and jesus has proved to me over and over i still remember when i preached in guy and i still remember this in guyana the church was so small i can i can show you the youtube video of the church because they have another video there brother brooks was outside in the sand the church is so small the church isn't even this size inside of it much smaller so brother brooks was out past the back door i was preaching on the holy ghost saints god is my witness he would every him and all the people around were on his knees this was probably a four or five hour service as well he was on his knees in his suit in the sand because it was all sand it's like a beachy sand right there and guy on that island where we were at and church i could see the water almost piling up like uh from his tears it was just it was hitting the same spot and it was like tiny little puddles just he was so we were so moved by the people that were desiring to be filled with the holy ghost and brother brooks uh said the holy spirit gave him a great touch that day and it was it's not it's not anything about me it's just what the lord gave me for those people right uh i'm gonna think i'm gonna pause the live stream because i'm gonna say something personal so god bless the live streamers love you by the amen i think he's right uh streaming tonight all the same god bless you let me know when it's off there
