[5:12] much more than I do I'll learn to seek
[5:17] your face and the knowledge of you grace
[5:21] I want praise God
[5:36] okay well let's take our Bibles here we
[5:38] like to I think the Lord willing we'll
[5:40] finish this little series on the mystery
[5:42] of the rapture so we've done three parts
[5:47] on it this will be part four so let's go
[5:53] to 1st Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 so Lord
[6:20] willing tonight we'll finish up with the
[6:22] rewards for receiving the revelation of
[6:24] the rapture and then the consequences as
[6:28] well I just say this you know with God's
[6:40] grace but you know after Wednesday night
[6:43] service about the rapture and the more
[6:45] we go over these the more it is just
[6:47] more clear to my heart and I trust to
[6:49] yours that this message has the true
[6:53] revelation of the rapture you know acts
[6:56] 3:21 says Jesus remains in heaven until
[6:59] the restitution of all things Matthew 17
[7:03] 11 the Lord Jesus himself says Elias
[7:08] must come and restore all things and if
[7:10] if John the Baptist was that
[7:13] he'd restore the law and so that part
[7:17] wasn't referring to John the Baptist and
[7:20] in the days of the Son of Man there had
[7:22] to be another Son of Man coming and then
[7:25] you know seeing brother Graham's six
[7:28] statements about thus saith the Lord his
[7:32] ministry was the last sign to the
[7:33] Gentiles I think that's makes it very
[7:35] clear for us we can see the scripturally
[7:37] in Genesis chapter 18 as well the last
[7:41] sign God's last visit before the
[7:44] promised son to Abraham and his seed
[7:47] were changing their bodies and then
[7:49] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[7:51] their heart so just getting more clear
[7:55] praise God
[7:57] so 1st Thessalonians 4 16 and 17 I'll
[8:01] read these but then we'll read our
[8:02] memory verses well that God who write
[8:04] those scriptures upon our hearts for the
[8:07] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[8:08] with a shout and with the voice of the
[8:10] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[8:13] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[8:16] we which are alive and remain shall be
[8:19] caught up together with them in the
[8:21] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[8:24] so shall we ever be with the Lord all
[8:30] rights go to Philippians 4 sorry I'm
[8:35] it's a little cold here as you'll see me
[8:36] blowing on my hands probably well chilly
[8:39] my hands are a little dry as well first
[8:41] sorry Philippians 4 7 & 8 you can hear
[8:47] the birds singing which is really nice
[8:49] clear just saying that song the birds in
[8:51] the sky seen their songs the Lord so
[8:53] we're happy to join them
[9:02] Philippians 4:7 and eight will read our
[9:04] memory verse here let's read that on
[9:06] three one two three and the peace of God
[9:10] which passeth understanding shall keep
[9:13] your hearts and minds through Christ
[9:15] Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things
[9:20] are true whatsoever things are honest
[9:23] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[9:26] things are pure whatsoever things are
[9:30] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[9:34] report if there be any virtue and if
[9:37] there be any praise think on these
[9:40] things
[9:41] praise God may God's blessings the
[9:42] reading of the word so Lord willing
[9:47] we'll finish here tonight with rapture
[9:49] mystery and I really like this format
[9:54] you know now I can really clearly see
[9:55] why brother Branham would preach the
[9:58] church age series in 1960 before
[10:00] publishing the book in 1965 because
[10:04] revelation comes as you preach it and so
[10:08] I've had numerous cases of that with
[10:11] this in particular this chapter I've
[10:14] seen how God opening it up that it seems
[10:17] like the foolish virgin will not have to
[10:20] suffer and go through the judgments and
[10:24] condemnation of the tribulation now of
[10:27] course it seems like they'll have to die
[10:29] and give their lives but the reason
[10:33] behind that was because a lot lot was
[10:37] spared the suffering or the we'd say the
[10:41] the wrath of God and that was a Bible
[10:43] principle God said I will not let the
[10:46] righteous suffer with the wicked so
[10:50] that's a beautiful promise of God so
[10:52] that's been a further understanding I
[10:54] never really had that understanding
[10:55] until you know starting this series and
[10:58] preaching this I think a few weeks ago
[11:01] by God's grace so we finished Wednesday
[11:05] night with the first reward for
[11:08] receiving this revelation that was the
[11:10] assurance that you're going in the
[11:12] rapture
[11:12] and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:14] that's the token praise God and it was
[11:17] foreshadowed in in numerous places but
[11:21] the main - we looked at was Rahab
[11:23] scarlet cord before the destruction of
[11:26] that Gentile city and then the token of
[11:33] the blood of the Lamb that spared Israel
[11:38] and their firstborn before the first
[11:41] Exodus then we know the second Exodus
[11:44] was the disciples on the day of
[11:46] Pentecost leaving man-made religion to
[11:49] hold a ghost full religion and the third
[11:52] Exodus will be the bride of Jesus Christ
[11:57] leaving the spiritual religion in - you
[12:00] might say eternal religion by God's
[12:03] grace that might be it
[12:05] so thank the Lord praise God so let's
[12:07] look at part 4 we read our text out of
[12:10] first Thessalonians 4 16 and 17 so the
[12:15] second reward after the assurance you
[12:17] get in your heart is escaping death and
[12:22] so that was the scripture we read the
[12:25] Bible says those who are alive and
[12:28] remain will not die but will instead
[12:34] have their vile mortal bodies changed
[12:38] into immortal ones remember even
[12:42] believers that die today you know they
[12:47] they have to go through death but
[12:49] remember Paul told us he said death
[12:51] where is your sting
[12:52] so the sting of death is gone but
[12:56] believers who die before the rapture of
[12:59] course have to go through death that
[13:01] that cold door brother random calls it a
[13:04] cold river but there the angels of God
[13:09] just assure your soul into the presence
[13:12] of God because Paul said when I'm absent
[13:14] from the body I'm present with the Lord
[13:17] and so this group who lives to see the
[13:23] rapture and our church is just it's all
[13:25] it's awesome
[13:26] it's humbling to think that most of us
[13:29] weren't raising the message but God
[13:31] seeks us and finds us as little sheep
[13:34] right he leaves a 99 to get the 1 and I
[13:39] didn't grow up knowing anything about a
[13:42] rapture nothing yet we come to this
[13:45] message and the full emphasis is loving
[13:48] Jesus Christ and being ready for the
[13:50] rapture it's quite awesome because we
[13:54] can see how God called us to it God's
[13:56] inviting us to it and we just need to
[14:01] fully surrender to Him and no doubt if
[14:04] we do our part if we yield our freemore
[14:06] agency fully and diligently seek Him
[14:12] then we know God will honor his word you
[14:17] know guy I can't force anybody to go in
[14:19] the rapture but if we her and thirst
[14:22] after it we shall be filled
[14:23] that's clearly taught in the scripture
[14:27] so you know countless funerals have
[14:33] happened down through the six thousand
[14:34] years of human history but there's gonna
[14:37] be a small group of Holy Ghost filled
[14:39] Christians that will not need funeral
[14:40] services so if they had insurance they
[14:44] won't need that they won't need to cash
[14:45] that in families won't need it it's a
[14:48] one-time once in a lifetime once in a
[14:54] church age we'd say once in a Gentile
[14:57] times of the Gentiles opportunity it's a
[15:00] worldwide death pass that God offers
[15:04] believers it's the first and only time a
[15:08] large group of saints will escape death
[15:11] we know two people have Enoch and Elijah
[15:14] such fortunate Saints both escaped death
[15:19] but there will be a larger group now we
[15:22] know to be small compared to the you
[15:24] know the population of the world I think
[15:26] right now we're at 7 billion going to 8
[15:29] billion this would be a very small
[15:31] number a fraction of a fraction but
[15:36] there will be a small group because Paul
[15:38] said so
[15:39] Jesus promised
[15:41] we know it's going to happen all their
[15:44] saints have had to die but think of it
[15:47] we could be the fortunate blessed
[15:51] privileged generation to see the coming
[15:53] of the Lord and if not us certainly the
[15:58] next generation or the generation after
[16:01] certainly one of the next generations
[16:04] will see it so that's the second reward
[16:06] the first is the assurance you'll get to
[16:10] meet Christ in the air
[16:12] the second is escaping death so let's go
[16:16] to the third the third is experiencing
[16:20] two glorious events in heavenly places
[16:27] while the earth is going through the
[16:30] Great Tribulation Period the first is
[16:33] the meeting in the air and the second is
[16:35] the wedding supper of the Lamb so I'm
[16:39] sure our Bible reader screen readers can
[16:42] get ready here we'll be going through a
[16:43] few so the first one is the meeting in
[16:49] the air that's what Paul said in
[16:51] Philippians we shall meet Christ in the
[16:54] air with the dead in Christ
[16:57] imagine Peter Paul Mary Tabitha brother
[17:02] branham Mita hope sister Mary Sanchez
[17:08] other brother browning brother James
[17:12] browning the saints that have gone on
[17:15] before meeting them in the air after the
[17:19] rapture
[17:21] you know you'll shake hands with these I
[17:23] don't know if we'll shake hands in the
[17:24] air but will instantly recognize them
[17:27] like Martin Luther and John Wesley and
[17:30] st. Paul as we said my soldiers of the
[17:34] cross
[17:35] Timothy all those wonderful Saints but
[17:40] that's not quite the greatest reward of
[17:41] that event the greatest reward will be
[17:44] seeing Jesus face-to-face that will be
[17:47] the greatest event as I wrote this
[17:51] chapter I started tearing up my I
[17:53] started tearing up
[17:54] I realized that was the greatest event
[17:57] of meeting in the air as much as I want
[17:59] to meet you know brother branham and
[18:01] Paul and Peter you know all the saints
[18:04] James you know that gave His life you
[18:07] know for the gospel Steven much as I
[18:09] want to meet warriors like that
[18:13] I think we all want to meet Jesus and
[18:15] he's the worthy one and we all want to
[18:18] see him face to face
[18:19] and that we shall be we shall behold the
[18:25] desire of Nations the bright morning
[18:28] star the fairest of ten thousand the
[18:31] root and offspring of David the Holy One
[18:34] of Israel and the faithful bridegroom
[18:37] the first and the last the Alpha and
[18:39] Omega the beginning in the end what a
[18:42] blessing it's at that moment the Bible
[18:46] says we no longer see through a glass
[18:50] darkly but that's when we'll see him
[18:55] face to face when I'll be our first
[18:56] scripture Lydia can you read 1st
[18:58] Corinthians 13:12 and Malachi can you
[19:00] get Philippians 3:21 so I'll say that
[19:04] again 1st Corinthians 13:12 for Lydia
[19:07] and Philippians 3:21 for Malachi so
[19:23] Lydia Glen so Paul you know of course
[19:36] he's laying out the gifts of the Spirit
[19:37] and the Corinthians Church but then by
[19:41] God's grace he breaks into this thought
[19:44] where these are all these gifts the Holy
[19:47] Spirit are tremendous blessings there
[19:49] helps there's such an encouragement but
[19:54] they're all partial blessings and but
[19:57] Paul says even with the gifts of the
[19:59] Spirit
[20:00] you know we things are really dark you
[20:03] know it's fuzzy
[20:06] because we're human and our minds wander
[20:10] our minds get discouraged we forget get
[20:14] discouraged at times but Paul says when
[20:18] when he sees Christ face-to-face he will
[20:22] not see through a glass darkly but I'll
[20:27] see Christ face-to-face and not only
[20:31] will we see him face to face
[20:32] but he'll change our bodies as we
[20:35] mentioned on Wednesday Abraham and Sarah
[20:37] had a body change and so Jesus would do
[20:41] the same thing for Abraham and Sarah's
[20:43] spiritual seed Malachi can read that
[20:45] please you sometimes wonder how is God
[20:59] gonna you know change our bodies well
[21:01] the Bible says right there he can subdue
[21:03] anything if he can calm the storms if he
[21:06] can walk on water if he can come down
[21:10] from heaven and meet Abraham and just
[21:13] you know pull dust upon him and make him
[21:16] a flesh body well then surely he can
[21:18] change our bodies if he placed all the
[21:21] stars in the skies we've seen that song
[21:24] and they never missed their timing then
[21:26] surely he can change our bodies in the
[21:28] moment and the twinkling of an eye
[21:30] because he has no limits he's unlimited
[21:33] he's omnipotent all-powerful almighty so
[21:38] we know we'll see him face to face that
[21:41] will be the moment we see him face to
[21:43] face
[21:43] praise God and we'll have change bodies
[21:47] like it under his glorious body so this
[21:56] is where we sing that song I believe
[22:00] it's it as well with my soul where Lord
[22:02] hates the day when my faith shall be
[22:04] sight and so this is the moment when our
[22:08] faith becomes sight I guess you might
[22:11] even say Lord willing if we get to see
[22:13] the Saints before the rapture if we get
[22:15] to see the dead in Christ rise first
[22:17] then truly our face will
[22:19] come sight at that moment see such
[22:24] supernatural miracles would make our
[22:29] faith present right it's all it's
[22:32] obviously a substance inside of us but
[22:34] when we see people there well if we see
[22:37] saints dead in Christ risen first and
[22:40] our faith truly has become sight the
[22:43] reality of our faith would be standing
[22:45] before us and when we meet Christ in the
[22:47] air the no doubt our faith becomes sight
[22:50] that moment so no longer will we be able
[22:55] to say Peters words in first Peter 1:8
[22:59] miss Peter says having not seen you love
[23:05] so once we get to the meeting in the air
[23:08] that wonderful reward we'll be able to
[23:11] say I have seen the Lord and I love him
[23:15] even more because we have perfect bodies
[23:18] perfect minds right no longer and the
[23:22] ability to sin by the grace of the Lord
[23:24] so Peter said having not seen you love
[23:27] but there having seen we love even more
[23:34] praise God so there's not a lot of
[23:38] questions on our minds about the meeting
[23:40] in the air of the rapture
[23:42] it's the catching of the way our
[23:44] catching away of the bride of Jesus
[23:46] Christ to meet the Lord in the air now
[23:52] the second event is the wedding supper
[23:56] of the Lamb now this one seems at this
[24:00] moment we have less details about this
[24:04] event but we are given a couple
[24:06] important scriptures and perhaps shirts
[24:10] you know as the Lord tarries you know
[24:12] the Lord will open up more revelation
[24:15] you know regarding these events for
[24:20] example I can see in the church age book
[24:21] where brother man talks about will read
[24:24] it now so Lydia can you get 2nd
[24:27] Corinthians 11:2
[24:34] so Paul taught our brother man talks
[24:36] about the church age messenger from each
[24:39] church age presenting his group of
[24:46] believers from his age presenting them
[24:49] spotless presenting the bride to the
[24:53] husband
[24:54] and from what I've listened to I haven't
[24:57] heard brother Ram labor on that thought
[24:59] it seems like it's a revelation that God
[25:01] gave him as he wrote he and lavell
[25:03] worked on writing the church age book
[25:06] that's an example of at the end of
[25:08] brother Rams ministry God gives him even
[25:11] fresh even more fresh revelation about
[25:13] the rapture we know the shout voice
[25:16] Trump in December of 1965 was fresh
[25:19] revelation or the Branham had never
[25:21] preached it that way at least that I've
[25:23] heard so the Holy Spirit keeps guiding
[25:29] us into all truth well we should expect
[25:30] that then the Holy Spirit will reveal
[25:32] more about these future events the
[25:36] meeting in the air and then also here
[25:38] the wedding supper of the Lamb so the
[25:44] first the first event of the wedding
[25:48] supper at least from my understanding
[25:50] seems to be the presentation of the
[25:53] bride to the bridegroom Jesus Christ I
[25:57] just I just remember that scripture the
[26:01] first shall be last and the last shall
[26:03] be first so that may tie in here I'm not
[26:07] certain but it may tie in here if the
[26:10] first goes last that would mean the
[26:13] first church age would be last in order
[26:15] and then the last church age would be
[26:18] presented first so that's just one
[26:21] thought I'm not certain on that but
[26:22] that's just something that I thought was
[26:23] interesting about the scripture because
[26:26] a member Jesus quotes that after the
[26:28] parables where he's talking about the
[26:30] wedding and his coming about the rapture
[26:34] so that's just an interesting scripture
[26:37] to keep in mind by the grace of the Lord
[26:41] so that he can read that second
[26:43] Corinthians 11:2
[26:45] for I am jealous over you with godly
[26:47] dossier I despised you to one husband
[26:50] that I may present you as a chaste
[26:51] virgin to Christ good now the Corinthian
[26:55] church was birthed under Paul's
[26:57] preaching in acts 18 1 to 17 and then
[27:03] Paul says I've already espoused you two
[27:07] to Christ so he that means he engaged
[27:14] them so it seems like the messenger from
[27:19] each age presents Jesus Christ in such a
[27:22] way where the people want to merit want
[27:25] to accept his marriage proposal and so
[27:30] because the messenger is the one who
[27:32] presents the bridegroom to the bride
[27:35] Paul says I have espoused you and
[27:39] another way to look at it as Paul said
[27:41] you have many teachers in the Lord but
[27:43] not many fathers so it seemed like the
[27:47] church age messenger could be like a
[27:48] father figure right and then the Saints
[27:52] or his converts could be like the
[27:55] daughter because that that seems to fit
[27:59] the symbolism God is giving here of
[28:04] kinda like Eleazar
[28:06] you know presenting the bride to Isaac
[28:10] kind of get that same type of symbolism
[28:13] here so Paul says he has his duty since
[28:20] he's espoused them he said that I may
[28:23] present you so he does he's desiring to
[28:27] do it and it would seem like the logical
[28:30] time to do this would be at the wedding
[28:33] supper because no doubt on earth you
[28:39] know after Paul left the city of Corinth
[28:42] numerous Saints as time went on would
[28:44] just die and pass on and so Paul didn't
[28:47] physically present them to Christ during
[28:50] their lifetime we'd say but he says that
[28:54] I may present you as a chaste virgin to
[28:57] Christ
[28:59] so again that's a great scripture for
[29:00] being a virgin to Christ
[29:03] meaning no interaction no idols no
[29:08] intercourse with the things of the world
[29:10] you know money and idolatry and
[29:14] spiritual fornication worship of idols
[29:18] so that's a great scripture there you
[29:21] can tie in together so all this tell the
[29:27] Corinthian church who heard Paul's
[29:29] preaching about the baptism the Holy
[29:31] Ghost they'll be resurrected resurrected
[29:33] rather for the rapture and gathered
[29:36] there in heaven for the wedding supper
[29:38] and it seems like that's where Paul will
[29:41] present his church age to Jesus Christ
[29:45] and that's where we believe brother
[29:47] Branham will present our church age
[29:50] including us to Christ Jesus now another
[29:56] thing another part of this would be the
[29:59] awards or the rewards for the Saints
[30:02] Paul said that the Saints every one must
[30:05] appear before the judgment seat of
[30:07] Christ and brother Branham had a dream
[30:09] about this where he was called up after
[30:12] Ormond Neville he was caught up to the
[30:14] throne of God to get his rewards and the
[30:17] stand before the throne of God and he
[30:22] said when he got up to the steps he said
[30:24] he said he felt something touch his hand
[30:26] that was hope and then he was really
[30:28] happy and then he's felt something
[30:30] touched his other hand and that was meda
[30:31] and he said both of his wives played
[30:37] such a role that they would stand before
[30:40] the throne of God together for rewards
[30:42] he said I hope it's that way and that's
[30:46] what we hope - we hope that that dream
[30:48] was a scriptural dream it seems to be
[30:50] because Paul says in first Corinthians 3
[30:54] that we must all stand before the
[30:56] judgment seat of Christ then Peter says
[30:58] husbands and wives are heirs together or
[31:02] inheritors together of the grace of life
[31:06] so that's another aspect another reward
[31:08] the meeting in the air
[31:12] the awards rewards and then the the
[31:16] presentation and then there's one more
[31:19] the communion service followed by yeah
[31:22] which would be an eating service as well
[31:26] as a member before Jesus was crucified
[31:29] the Bible said he desired to have
[31:32] communion or the lat are the Lord's
[31:34] Supper the Passover with his disciples
[31:36] he desired with desire and then once we
[31:44] get to the marriage supper he wants to
[31:47] have communion with his entire bride
[31:50] praise God so he had it there with his
[31:52] apostles but then after the rapture
[31:57] he'll have it with his entire bride for
[32:00] sure so on earth
[32:06] Jesus's last communion signaled the end
[32:10] of their earthly communion but when
[32:15] Jesus has communion heaviness signals
[32:17] the beginning of the eternal communion
[32:19] praise God
[32:20] so we can see the Jesus ends his
[32:23] communion with communion and then he
[32:25] restarts the communion I'm sorry the
[32:28] fellowship with communion which is a
[32:31] beautiful thing to see we're not going
[32:37] to read it but in Genesis 14 remember
[32:38] Melchizedek has communion with Abram
[32:41] after gaining the victory and so that's
[32:46] why we can see that communion service
[32:49] with bread and wine we can see that as a
[32:51] meal between Abraham and Melchizedek
[32:55] then we can see that that's what the
[32:58] bride of Jesus Christ and Christ will
[33:00] experience together a communion in
[33:02] heaven by God's grace after the trials
[33:06] of life are over
[33:07] you know we suffer like we said over the
[33:10] Easter weekend we have sufferings
[33:12] persecutions but Paul says they're light
[33:14] afflictions and
[33:18] but if we're faithful and we keep the
[33:21] faith we keep his word of patience to
[33:22] the end he'll keep us from the hour
[33:24] temptation that he will serve us
[33:26] Communion at that great event the
[33:31] heavenly communion the marriage supper
[33:33] the lamb remember Abraham defeated four
[33:37] kings in Genesis 14 he took his trained
[33:42] army and restored lot and in fact all
[33:46] the people and goods of sodom and
[33:48] gomorrah
[33:48] and that was prophetic or that was a
[33:52] type of the saints a day defeating the
[33:58] four horse riders because we know the
[34:00] fourth horse rider we know his name is
[34:03] death and he was just a combination of
[34:06] the previous three riders because it's
[34:09] the same rider all the way down so just
[34:12] as abraham defeated four kings will
[34:14] defeat those same four temptations from
[34:19] the same the one the same antichrist
[34:22] spirit so the white was deception
[34:28] remember the black which are the red was
[34:35] death so their their ability to control
[34:38] church and state and then black that was
[34:44] famine and the Dark Ages capturing the
[34:47] wealth of the world so all those are the
[34:51] components of spiritual death and we
[34:53] defeat all those by the grace of God
[34:56] even death especially death at the
[34:58] rapture right because we escaped death
[35:00] it's a praise God and then Christ of
[35:09] course he keeps the promise he made to
[35:10] his disciples in Matthew 26 29 he said
[35:14] but I say unto you I will not drink
[35:17] henceforth of the fruit of this vine
[35:19] until that day when I drink it new with
[35:23] you in my father's Kingdom
[35:25] think of that 2000 years Jesus has got
[35:28] that promise he hasn't drank of the
[35:30] fruit of vine
[35:31] somehow in heaven there's gonna be the
[35:35] fruit of the vine up in heaven and he
[35:37] can have communion with the Saints again
[35:40] okay the fourth reward here is raptured
[35:47] Saints get to experience the 1000 year
[35:50] millennial reign with Christ this is the
[35:53] honeymoon for Christ and his bride as
[35:56] the rapture is the wedding ceremony
[36:00] right now is the engagement so thankful
[36:03] to be engaged to Christ praise God I
[36:04] know he's coming for me he's giving me
[36:06] the the wedding band of predestinated
[36:09] unmerited grace right
[36:12] I made my vows to him he made his vows
[36:15] to us for his word and we know God keeps
[36:20] his word so we are married to the Lord
[36:22] engaged to him praise God and we'll be
[36:24] married physically face-to-face at the
[36:26] rapture so this is a single day of the
[36:32] Lord because the day of the Lord is as a
[36:34] thousand years with man
[36:36] that's according to 2nd Peter 3:8 and
[36:39] there's no sin in this day oh what a
[36:41] glorious day this is the day we long for
[36:44] [Music]
[36:50] just imagine I just imagine a thousand
[36:54] years no aches pains sicknesses no
[36:57] coronavirus no death no destruction
[37:02] there'll be no abuse no cursing no
[37:08] wickedness no selfishness no the will be
[37:13] the kingdom of God on earth fully the
[37:21] full government of Jesus Christ with a
[37:24] rod of iron ruling over the nation's now
[37:28] we're not going to read through all this
[37:29] just for times sake how we doing on time
[37:31] looking but revelation 20 verses 4 and 6
[37:35] says I saw Thrones and they that sat
[37:38] upon them so they it's a group of people
[37:40] sitting on Thrones judgment was given
[37:43] unto them
[37:45] the souls of those that were beheaded
[37:46] for the witness of Jesus and for the
[37:48] word of God which had not worshipped the
[37:51] Beast neither His image neither received
[37:54] his mark upon their foreheads or in
[37:55] their hands army they lived and reigned
[38:00] with Christ for a thousand years we just
[38:04] don't live we reign we rule in that
[38:07] Kingdom but the rest of the Dead lived
[38:11] not for a thousand years and this is
[38:14] called the first resurrection and again
[38:19] it says they shall reign with him a
[38:22] thousand years church that's all this
[38:24] life is this life is a testing time to
[38:27] see who wants to reign who if we let
[38:31] Christ reign in our life now then Christ
[38:34] will he can trust us to reign in his
[38:38] kingdom later praise god we've got to
[38:40] let Christ reign over our freemore
[38:43] agency now because it's the only hope
[38:46] for our lives our lives will be wasted
[38:49] our lives will be sad and despair if we
[38:52] don't let Jesus Christ have control of
[38:55] our freemore agency because we know he
[38:59] has the best design for our life he has
[39:03] the best plan for our lives he can his
[39:05] highest thoughts are way higher than our
[39:07] thoughts as that sky is higher than all
[39:10] of us right so are the Lord's plans for
[39:13] our lives way higher than our thoughts
[39:18] [Music]
[39:22] now remember the rest of the Dead lived
[39:24] not 2000 years so the foolish virgin
[39:28] will not live during this time it's
[39:33] because they were warned to get the oil
[39:35] but they neglected it Hebrews 2 verses 3
[39:41] and 4 says we must not neglect such a
[39:44] powerful Holy Ghost gospel with signs
[39:47] wonders and miracles and then of course
[39:52] millions billions of unbelievers will
[39:55] miss the rapture I'm sorry I missed the
[39:58] thousand your
[39:59] lynnium just because of their unbelief
[40:04] so imagine this a thousand years no
[40:06] devil no temptation no lusts no greed no
[40:10] murder no destruction and thankfully no
[40:14] politics right Christ will be king King
[40:20] of Kings Lord of lords for 300,000
[40:26] sixty-five days in a row pure peace joy
[40:31] great victory beauty joy joy out of me
[40:36] joy unspeakable full of glory some
[40:39] Christians were even rule over nations
[40:41] lydia revelation 2:26 mecca luke 1917
[40:48] some christians will rule over nations
[40:51] and some christians will have authority
[40:53] over ten cities these are the words of
[40:57] the lord jesus we looked at these last
[40:58] year I think when we looked at diligence
[41:00] and rewards for those who are diligent
[41:03] for the kingdom of God so Lydia Luke -
[41:07] I'm sorry revelation 2:26
[41:10] [Music]
[41:16] that was spoken in the Sardis church age
[41:19] Martin Luther's church age the
[41:21] overcomers that came out of the Catholic
[41:24] denomination Anglican denomination all
[41:26] the all the denominations of men and
[41:31] were born again jesus promises them
[41:35] ruling over nations now Kyle Luke 1917
[41:49] so this is the man who was given five
[41:52] talents and he doubles it and so God
[41:55] says I'm gonna make you ruler you said
[41:56] you have ten talents I'm gonna make you
[41:58] ruler over ten cities the church we need
[42:00] to look at that right we can look at our
[42:02] church as a little city right and if we
[42:05] can be faithful over one little Church
[42:07] we can be faithful look at your house
[42:09] look at your job this is just one little
[42:11] city one little town
[42:13] look at something very small if I can
[42:16] just rule over this and let the Holy
[42:18] Spirit have preeminence in every part of
[42:22] this administration of this little
[42:25] government you know God's made your
[42:28] little governor right you know we thank
[42:30] God for the Governor of Ohio and all the
[42:33] godly governors you know in America and
[42:36] around the world but we have to realize
[42:39] we're governors I'm a governor of my
[42:41] home I'm a governor of my my my job I'm
[42:44] a governor of the church and if I can
[42:48] rule over this well and if I can keep
[42:51] investing in it until more and more
[42:54] spiritual fruits and hopefully natural
[42:56] fruits of souls being saved and
[42:59] testimonies coming out of the Word of
[43:03] God being preached then then we believe
[43:06] God will make us ruler over Moore later
[43:09] he said if you're faithful with a little
[43:11] you'll be faithful with a lot so let's
[43:16] be faithful now by God's grace so if you
[43:22] can submit everything to Christ and be a
[43:25] cross carrier in this life can you
[43:31] handle the the weight of the Cross way
[43:35] to the cross and follow Jesus in this
[43:39] lifetime let's not throw off the cross
[43:42] what's the cross it's your burden it's
[43:45] something God is placed on your life
[43:47] that's it's challenging but God has
[43:50] called you to it maybe it's a gift of
[43:51] the Holy Spirit of you as we preached on
[43:53] if it's a ministry its ministering your
[43:57] family that's a lot of people's cross
[44:00] many times
[44:02] maybe it's ministering other ways with
[44:04] gifts and ministries helping this the
[44:08] poor clothing that those that don't have
[44:12] much clothes there's many many kinds of
[44:16] ministries you can have remember the
[44:20] women that they just went around
[44:22] I can't remember the name of it Susanna
[44:24] all the women that followed Jesus's
[44:27] ministry and they just donated their
[44:29] money you know to help out the brothers
[44:31] as they preach God's Word and no doubt
[44:34] God will bless the faithful sisters in
[44:35] our church and brothers that maybe not
[44:38] preachers but if they're providing for
[44:40] the preachers and the guest ministers
[44:42] and helping we take the ties and send
[44:45] them to missionaries and do all that and
[44:47] I believe God will honor you and bless
[44:50] you and I'll see your your investments
[44:52] in his kingdom for those things jesus
[44:58] said he that's faithful in the least is
[45:01] faithful also in much according to Luke
[45:04] 16:10 a Christian who's faithful over a
[45:08] few things will be ruler over many
[45:10] things in Matthew 25:21 remember this
[45:15] quote from brother Branham he said if
[45:18] you keep doing works faithfully until
[45:20] the end you'll be given power over the
[45:24] nation's he said you'll be a strong
[45:27] capable unbending ruler who can cope so
[45:32] powerfully with any situation that's we
[45:36] want to be in this hour and I think of
[45:38] and hooah
[45:39] you know they have a difficult situation
[45:41] but they gotta cope with that and they
[45:45] gotta let the Holy Spirit continue to
[45:46] love and believe and pray through that
[45:49] and not let their emotion or the
[45:51] discouragement or the difficulty of that
[45:54] situation overcome them and get them in
[45:57] the flesh they need to bring that bring
[46:01] those bring those tests under control of
[46:05] the power of the Holy Spirit just as all
[46:08] of us go through different tests in our
[46:09] lives and different ones get sick or
[46:12] losing jobs or difficult things happen
[46:14] to us we have to be able to cope with
[46:18] every situation and in the middle the
[46:20] difficult situation give God praise and
[46:23] don't give the flesh an opportunity to
[46:27] sin
[46:30] so praise God that is the conclusion of
[46:34] the rewards so I got one one and a half
[46:38] more pages here I'm at 46 minutes so
[46:42] praise the Lord so there's there's one
[46:51] main consequence for rejecting this
[46:53] revelation and that's being unprepared
[46:58] so Lydia Malachi can you get Luke 12
[47:01] both you go to Luke 12 if you can't I
[47:05] [Music]
[47:10] think it's a little chillier than we
[47:12] thought out here try to finish up by
[47:15] God's grace so the first consequence is
[47:25] being unprepared or foolish or slothful
[47:30] is another word for it so Lydia can you
[47:32] read 45 and 46 Luke 12 I'm sorry Luke 12
[47:38] 45 and 46 you read 47 a sobering
[48:24] scripture we're in the message and we
[48:27] know that the Lord is coming soon so
[48:29] it's important for us that have heard to
[48:34] be faithful be diligent because this
[48:38] parable gives a great picture of it if
[48:41] we're faithful we will honor the
[48:44] in our care so in this in this parable
[48:49] the man had done faithfully served his
[48:52] people their meat in due season and he
[48:55] had to be sober and he had to do the
[48:57] Lord's will but if he was slothful he
[48:59] would give them you wouldn't feed them
[49:02] their meat in due season you give them
[49:03] something out of season wouldn't be
[49:05] wouldn't be what they needed for that
[49:07] hour he'd get drunk and he wouldn't be
[49:10] alert and watching and he wouldn't do
[49:13] he wouldn't do Christ's will he would do
[49:15] his own will so especially me as a
[49:17] minister I got to be very careful to
[49:19] give you the God's meat in his season
[49:21] I've got to keep a sober mind serious
[49:26] mind I got to do God's will and not my
[49:29] will so see the shout has gone forth in
[49:34] this parable
[49:35] they knew the Lord was going to return
[49:38] that's what Brella ram's message does it
[49:41] prepares us for the coming of the Lord
[49:43] but most people will be overtaken the
[49:46] Bible says but Paul says don't let these
[49:51] things slip in Hebrews 2:1 church we
[49:55] don't want to let something slip out of
[49:57] our hands you know I've I have numerous
[49:59] children and each one when I'm putting
[50:01] them down for the nap the little ones
[50:03] not the big ones with the little ones if
[50:04] they're holding on to something that
[50:06] slips out of their hand right and so
[50:09] that's the picture Paul's giving this
[50:10] this this man this leader he's sleeping
[50:14] he's drunk and these things slip out of
[50:16] his hand these opportunities are right
[50:18] in his hand if they slip right out of it
[50:21] the message is right in our hands the
[50:23] revelation of God's Word this Bible is
[50:26] right in our hands we have the keys to
[50:28] unlock we have the revelations to unlock
[50:31] the mystery of God we can't let these
[50:34] slip out of our hands we got to give
[50:35] ourselves more diligently to the word of
[50:38] the Lord
[50:39] and give ourselves wholly to the
[50:42] doctrine of God I'm committed to that I
[50:44] want to meditate upon these things
[50:47] because you are what you eat and I want
[50:49] to eat God's Word so foolish is the only
[50:53] word that God can give to the people
[50:56] that
[50:57] reader that that reject the rapture that
[51:00] don't prepare themselves for his coming
[51:04] because member Church this was hid from
[51:06] ages and from generations in Colossians
[51:08] chapter 1 Christ in you the hope of
[51:10] glory this Holy Ghost baptism was hidden
[51:13] for four thousand years but in these
[51:16] last two thousand years it's been made
[51:19] available we must take advantage we must
[51:21] drink of the living water we must know
[51:24] what it feels like to have waters of
[51:26] praise as waters of Thanksgiving to flow
[51:29] out of our hearts like a like a river
[51:32] praise God amen thank God just to praise
[51:35] his name and to worship and love him
[51:38] it's like living waters springing up in
[51:41] your soul those the those who reject the
[51:47] revelation but die before the rapture
[51:50] they of course they're absent from the
[51:52] learned they don't rise with the dead in
[51:54] Christ they miss the marriage supper and
[51:57] most likely the Millennium but the
[52:01] foolish virgin that live long enough to
[52:05] miss the rapture and be alive during the
[52:07] tribulation they'll have to die during
[52:10] the tribulation I don't believe that
[52:12] they'll have to suffer the vials or the
[52:16] trumpets or the hail fire brimstone
[52:19] I believe that's reserved for those who
[52:23] took the mark of the beast
[52:24] just like lot how lot was spared from
[52:28] the fiery destruction and judgment that
[52:30] came upon Sodom and Gomorrah
[52:32] remember God will not suffer the
[52:34] righteous to die like the wicked but one
[52:40] thing we know that will happen Jesus
[52:41] tells us this in Matthew 25 11 12 and 13
[52:44] the foolish version will come and knock
[52:47] so they'll have some type of prayer
[52:50] meeting and say Lord let us in Oh God
[52:54] let them take us us take us in the
[52:56] rapture as well and Jesus will say
[52:57] verily I say unto you I know you not
[53:01] I want Christ to know me now I want I'm
[53:03] gonna lay my heart open don't you I lay
[53:06] my heart open now so Christ knows me now
[53:08] because he's gonna tell the foolish
[53:10] virgin I don't know you
[53:11] but I want Christ to search every door
[53:13] my heart I'm opening my door say Jesus
[53:16] come in and sup with me praise God and
[53:18] while you're here clean everything out
[53:20] purify my heart my mind my soul I just
[53:24] want to obey your word and do all of
[53:26] your will and not my will yes those dumb
[53:34] believers will suffer the sudden
[53:36] destruction Paul said in first
[53:37] Thessalonians 5 it'll be a time of
[53:40] trouble such as never was since there
[53:42] was a nation even to that same time
[53:45] that's a corn first thessalonians 5:3 in
[53:48] daniel 12:1 so in conclusion I just have
[53:52] these last few words I want to say
[53:54] that's the conclusion you and I know the
[53:59] revelation of the rapture it is a sudden
[54:03] secret snatching away of Christ
[54:06] taking his bride off the earth before
[54:09] God's judgments of wrath or poured a pop
[54:11] poured out upon this wicked generation
[54:16] [Music]
[54:17] that is the revelation through a shout
[54:20] voice Trump through the power of the
[54:22] Holy Spirit the same spirit that
[54:24] quickened Jesus body will quicken our
[54:26] mortal bodies amen it'll swallow up our
[54:30] bodies of death in life and transform us
[54:33] in a moment the twinkling of an eye six
[54:37] reasons prove that it's a
[54:38] pre-tribulation rapture so we must stay
[54:41] awake alert daily wearing the armor of
[54:46] God and utilizing the sword of the
[54:48] Spirit when we must fight against the
[54:50] enemy by God's amazing grace we'll
[54:55] accept his invitation we'll be prepared
[54:57] for this once in history event a large
[55:01] group of privileged Christians will
[55:03] escape death as Jesus changes their
[55:08] bodies in a moment of a twink of an eye
[55:10] that will see Jesus face to face and so
[55:13] shall we ever be with the Lord
[55:15] what a beautiful revelation remember
[55:21] 2,000 years ago in Revelation 10 7 the
[55:24] Bible said that
[55:25] mystery of God would be finished and
[55:26] taken around the world and we're
[55:29] fortunate to know the mystery of God now
[55:32] it's our responsibility to echo it to
[55:35] our friends our neighbors those on line
[55:37] who will be able to receive it and
[55:40] church I'll say like this we can say
[55:45] referring to revelation 10 7 to 11 the
[55:50] day this scripture is fulfilled the
[55:53] mystery of God is finished and now as we
[55:55] take it around the world and we send
[55:57] brothers to do it and you know using the
[55:59] the tool of YouTube or the internet we
[56:04] can say this day the scripture is being
[56:06] fulfilled here the mystery of God is
[56:08] being echoed and the prophecies of God
[56:11] gave brother Paul brother Peter brother
[56:15] John and brother Branham are being
[56:18] fulfilled in this hour thank God and we
[56:22] can say that that we are one of them
[56:24] we're so glad we can say we're one of
[56:26] them and this day the scripture is
[56:27] fulfilled I hope that was a blessing to
[56:30] you my I just I'm so thankful I'd just
