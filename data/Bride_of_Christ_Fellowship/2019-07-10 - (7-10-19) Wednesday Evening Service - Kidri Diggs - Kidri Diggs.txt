gone except for a little spot and and then they wonder do more chemo and she said no I'm done with that and so but the doctors said the chemo didn't actually take away the cancer so they said you need to do these four more treatments and so they the doctors didn't know what took it away but cam and the church believe it was prayer by God's grace and then because of the cancer her dimmed and she

all men unto you know so father let the word do the drawing Lord and Lord God just let us be obedient following prayer to bless this church continually Lord brother Jesse and his family lost Church family and all those connected in the name of Jesus Christ we pray in church say men a man of you have your Bibles let's turn to the book of Judges judges 6 I believe our judges 6 praise the Lord judges chapter 6 and to make the reading short let's just let's just started on verse 11 judges 6 and verse 11 the Bible says and there came an angel of the Lord and said under an oak which was in Ofra that pertained them to Joe as the abra Knight and his son Gideon threshed week by the winepress to hide it from the Midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou mighty man of Valor and Gideon said unto Him o my lord if the Lord be with us why then is this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our Father told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the LORD hath forsaken us and deliver us into the hands of the Midianites let's go to 1st John chapter 5 first John chapter 5 first John chapter 5 and let's read verse 13 this thing have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us amen may Lord bless the reading of his word you can have your seats amen praise God today brother imp of the Lord I want to dig in a thought it may sound kind of strange but you know my thought tonight is the blessing of not knowing the blessing of not knowing now you know as I look in the Word of God you know and one thing I realize about God he loves to unveil himself dad loves to reveal himself to his people and you know so so that's kind of where my topic is coming from today that there areas in our life that we don't know God so God being God has to reveal himself in a certain way so he could be expressed because God's desire is for us to know him and to know him completely amen not just know a part of God but as his children as his seed he wants us to know him in fullness that's why God unveiled himself from generation to generation from church age to Church change because the first church age didn't know all about God so God kept unveiling himself so he had to keep creation going amen because God and he wanted to be known amen he wanted to know he wanted his creation to know all of his expressions but for us it's such a blessing when God reveals himself because what happens when God reveals himself in a certain way it produces the confidence to us hey man you know I think about when God filled himself to me as a healer that puts such a smile on my face you know and it produced a confidence in that area of my life then nobody could take away heylia so you know just like the scripture says it says you know and this is the confidence that we have in him then we ask anything according to his will he hears us now when it comes to healing we should have a confidence because I believe healing is his will hallelujah so when we go to God we go to God not knowing but we go in that breathy hallelujah that God is able to reveal you know when I when I look at this where he were Gillian you know and we look at how God does things you know Church it's mind-blowing that we read the Bible we look really closely we see God is a God of patterns oh yeah he's a God of patterns the Bible says he says I'm the Lord and I changed now if you read through the scripture you can see that he constantly kind of their sleeves the same way and he calls people and they do things the same way you know and as I look at her and I thought about you know just stop the blessing of not knowing you know Abraham he didn't know God but yet it was a blessing because when God calls him God was going to reveal himself in such a way that it would erase all Abraham's doubts oh yeah so if we can say that I want you to examine your life and just maybe you know go into the depths of who you are baby well but God is obligated God is obligated to reveal himself so you ought to not necessarily challenge God but but prove you're a man say say Lord you know you stand neither of wholesale financial situation God has to prove himself as being a provider or we should know they will call him Jehovah Jireh hell yeah so therefore it's a blessing to you to not know because God has to prove him hire you you know hi you know I look at this way Gideon this was a strenuous time you know in the land and you know the media nights they were putting pressure on them you know but you look at God God comes to us in times of fear you know and we are afraid it's a cure if you cannot take the word confidence confidence is the complete opposite of being secure you know but confidence comes when God hire you totally annihilate your fears and you look what he came cagillion he came in a time when he was most afraid hey he's back there hiding behind a request because of the Midianites and in the moment when he's hiding and sharing some his life he's sharing from his moment God comes in and God calls him a mighty man of Valor through the visitation of angels oh my what a mighty God he also in that blessing of not doing God and that mighty deliverer not knowing God you know of one who can come in and change the whole situation just like that it was a blessing and not knowing because God had to show Gideon how great he is so you get the stages God took just to show just to bill Gideon's confidence because guinea was like if the Lord is with us then why I always been following us you know we asked that question a lot sometimes you know we ask God say Lord if I got the Holy Ghost so I'm trying to serve you and you doing Lord you know why's my life go like this you know God is a confidence booster so you have to have areas in your life that you kind of feel kind of weak or you may feel kind of insecure because you didn't have moments like that there'll be no need for mighty God so God allows us to go through fears and insecurities that all these things so he could show his greatness in your life where he can build a company where in that moment in that place of time you can look back and you can see man in that moment when I was afraid when I was insecure when I was worried well I didn't know what was gonna happen God came in and gave me a confidence oh yeah showers breast not to know God so by knowing God by not knowing God trying to make sure that I knew him whom I just loved the god of simplicity cuz you know in one place apostle of God he said Amen you you you you you you solve the equation by the problem or you take the you take you take the solution and the problem and put it together and you get your answer you know but when it comes to you rejecting us up as a teacher to check your work you have to take the answer and process a portion and get the beginning and all that stuff so just we have to be able to see God in the midst of doing something you know churching as I look at Gideon Gideon he he he wasn't confident in the calling of God but God wanted to make him sure so what God did go ahead I want you to go down tear down the grows everything I'll be with you he was like Lord I don't know my dad and God I need a son eyes me I need I need a sign it he took the sweet sweet on the story of the fleece you know and he said I out and one was place he said I need the fleece to be driving the ground where God did that that should have been enough to build his confidence but you know what you know what church God knows how much it will take and God is willing to go the extra mile to make sure we know him and you look what God did God didn't just stop earlier he didn't just see in that moment where he made the speech dry in the ground way God proves who he was he was he proved that what he said again I'm agree with you he proved it he didn't have to do anything else but just to make sure we are confident just to make sure haria we are confident in him he'll go the extra mile to prove his will that's why he says this is the confidence we have that when we ask anything hallelujah we have got anything according to his will we'll have what we ask for now God didn't have to come and make ground dry in the fresh wet but he did that because it was his will to show Gideon how great he was and not just when I say how great he was not just God being great but his greatness being revealed and Gideon so that's why higher your God produced his confidence he said and this is the confidence that we have in him hurry that if we ask anything according to his will so you know God made the fish drive hurry up and the ground wet and Gideon comes back and Jesus says make the ground dry and the free sweat why did God fulfill that second desire because it was his real hallelujah it was as real to show Gideon that you are mighty man of Valor and I'm sending you to come against hurry these ungodly God's earlier so god he he fulfills what we ask when it's according to the will of God huh so church as we see Gideon girls and heshes obedient to God he he turns down the girls but he does that still with an element of fear after all God did he still has an element of fear why where does that fear coming from not knowing the blessing of not knowing cuz not knowing and not being able to trust in God and God who's a person who Leah oh my just think about this God will use us when we don't even trust him he's getting and getting didn't even trust God oh my he didn't believe that regard said he was gonna do he's gonna do it earlier but God still use the man even though he was doubting him huh gosh did you Sarah even though she was doubting him huh - did you ever ham even though she was doubting him God use Moses even though he was dumping his vulnerability the blessing of that knowing huh because when we feel like we don't know what God's gonna do God or come to show himself and to prove to us who eat her Leah she turns the mall oh my and Burgess I feel my hippo coming on honey the more I feel I find myself in trials the more I realized I'm not the one really being tried catch me earlier if I say I'm a child of God it's I say I'm a believer so who's the one on trial my god oh yeah because I go around testifying you know like I said it was healing my God is a healer I'm not a child anymore my Guardians I go around and say my God is a provider hurry up I'm not the one on child as being the provider my god is so if I don't know how God has to come and fulfill that to me God has to come and unveil the mystery of Leah's to me so I can rock this journey in confidence hallelujah so what we have to do we have to look at our life our child's our tribulations as a blessing because this is how it happens Church in the Old Testament the worship well let's just say you and I the rush book will come and we offer a sacrifice and we bring the sacrifice to the priest for all seems to be forgiven and this priest had to offer the sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins but what happened to the worshiper he tell the worshiper you go ahead this right here is all about your sacrifice hurry up I want to make sure your sacrifice is worthy of bringing it before God that your sins may be forgiven huh now Jesus Christ is our sacrifice earlier so in anything we do hire you if God proclaims himself to be the perpetuation are to claim himself to be the supreme sacrifice that means hurry wherever we stand in need of he is the supreme meat he is the supreme answer for honey hey man y'all so we will get Gideon and Gideon you know God didn't stop God wanted to increase his right reputable I would say I'm kind of I'm kind of leery about saying increased his faith because I believe the faith we need for every situation is already in us so I don't like to say increase your faith I like to say release your faith huh Leah because wondering about God when God created you hug he didn't have to come back and add stuff to you everything you need is already in you can you imagine God creating me or creating you with no eyes and he said oh I forgot let me put some eyes in you're dealing with somebody when that happens you're dealing with a creator that doesn't know what he's doing or he's going to trial and error that means that the Creator halia has a level of fault in him see see and that's the prime example Harlan why God created a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman because God is not a creator by default that's who he is huh he doesn't make mistakes so can you imagine the LBJ cutie community how he said you know they say well I was born this way I'm rich man trapped in a woman's body no that'll be saying God didn't know what he was doing that gotta be saying that he's not perfect that'll be saying that he's not omnipotent or omniscient oh yeah he's not all-knowing all ooh yeah now how can you be God and not know what you're doing oh yeah to be God you and your subjects cannot be on the same level just Jesus have to have something to look up to know the Bible says that we are as in joint heirs of Christ but that's on this side cuz we have to hurry we on this side we have to look up God so that in --see we are joint heirs see it's like climbing in July oh yeah but just see God is building our company and you know you know when I think about you know what they say about you know God is the God of love and all these things you know and and you know like I said I'm on this animal I'm a woman in a man's body walk man in a woman's body and they say you know I was born like just no no demons have perverted your mind honey amen and what they've done they've come to take away your confidence and that's what he does to a person that's in that condition that man is no longer confident being a man honey so he wants to be a woman because of things that have befallen his life and his vice versa with the woman the woman is no longer confident being a woman she tries to be a man because what you're trying to do build her confidence but God building our confidence is about us knowing who we are oh yeah so as he reveals of himself he's really showing us who we are hariya so as God look at how he did it all throughout the Bible you know in times of fear and times of turmoil and peril you know God came in he done things that you can only imagine you know like I said he called Moses and Moses were like no I can't talk and God says who made your mouth hey you know Moses comes with skills that you and God see see bad is like God is like a an operating room you know that well he wants you to die from yourself he just flat lies huh he does it in such a way where you can't even say nothing else huh and that's what I did in Moses Moses came excuse an excuse an excuse and then God told Moses hey you be God and it Aaron be a prophet now what is is he gonna say after God tells him you be God see God came with the ultimate confidence placing in Moses he see Moses said I came talking I can't be delivered and I can't be this and I can't do this it people hear me and who gonna say should I come and then God God just flies the whole situation and God says hey I won't say how would you remote touch he does the same thing to us when we get in situations you know God tells us why cross back to situation he lies the whole situation he wants us to die to what we know and believe in him honey you know but Jesse that's the place I'm getting I'm getting to by God's grace that I'm looking at situations of my life and different situations well I'm just taking a step back hey I got the proof nothing this is all you got this is all about you I walk around I be clean I got the greatest guard ever this is a real I walk around up a clean my god is a provider this is on him oh yeah so when God does these things Malachi it should produce a confidence so when these situations arise we don't step into it that we're not knowing no we were already blessed in that area of not knowing now we have confidence look look what God does he uses God uses people at the time I believe at the time when God called most of the men in the scriptures didn't really know who they were they didn't have the confidence to walk as prophets and you know what mighty men of valor and you know as kings and all these things know God had to develop that in him it was a growth process man it's like it's like it's like uh uh uh Michael Jordan didn't you know when he was in college or let's just say high school he didn't believe he was the greatest he's gonna be the greatest player cuz he had trial and error he even got caught in his earlier days he got caught but as he began to hone in on his crash terrain as he began to grow into who he was [Music] get to some saddle what was that confidence I like I like to talk about this the game way where the Bulls played the Celtics in the playoffs in Jordan scored 63 against the bull of Larry Bird he scored 63 against that team and they interview Jordan they asked him they said what was going through your mind in that moment he said that I was unstoppable see he believed Harley even though he was in a room with four other guys on his team but he felt like he was the one that was unstoppable he won't worry about team oh yeah see he had such a confidence he had such a confidence in that moment I do he pretended to put the ball and what God is trying to do for us is produced such a confidence in us that we can walk with God he talked to God we have session with him that we could go to him in our time of need and asked what we will and God hears us that's what confidence does confidence when you go to God and prayer you're believing he's going to answer back that's why prayer should be a relationship holy you know but I'm gonna be too much longer but as I looking and I think about Gideon go I challenge you to go back and read after Gideon turn around the groves you know they said we don't kill him who did this we don't kill now he didn't know all that was gonna come after he did whatever God said but I want you to see something the blessing of not knowing God told him to do that but God didn't tell him what was gonna be the outcome so who has to handle everything after that if you do what God says coz if you do what God says the repercussions of you doing it he's not on you he's on God my prophet will come and he would say if God sends you he's obligated to take care other God called you to do called you to do anything he'll provide Holly on that other hand whatever he told you honey that's how God works he has to why because he's a confidence builder and you think about him being God this is one thing I believe here the Bible says you know that um John 3:16 hugging it they got saved the sins of the whole world he died for the whole world sins of the whole world you know but we know everybody's not gonna be saved so why would God die and illustrate it and he died for the sins of the world because nobody's gonna be able to say in that great day his blood was throwing up for me nobody is gonna be able to say that that's why God presented his life to the whole world that was up to us to accept it by faith surely see God did his fatherly he did his part now the rest all the other steps we have to make her knowing honey she we make a step towards healing God already took a nap ah he's just trying to produce confidence in you honey that's how he wants nobody would be able to stand there in in in the reeks of judgment in the reeks of having that great gain is they well you said you know you died for see the whole world but I'm not saved and gotta say simply because you didn't take home the sacrifice I gave you the price but you did not receive it huh I offered us supreme sacrifice Oh think about this church there gonna be people standing there and they're gonna be saying to God what about me and God's gonna say I'll put you a covering but you never took but you know I look at God look at how he chooses he he chooses heal heal heal you we know that according to God's foreknowledge predestination he already knows who's bride who's not Brad but we don't know the stages of our life so we go through battles and different things and God gives us more and more confidence look at God David didn't know he was gonna have to fight a lion he didn't know he was gonna have a bear fight a bear what was that those were confidence boosters cuz he was glad to get to Goliath so sometimes things will happen with us not knowing oh yeah David didn't know that he was gonna have to fight a lion or have to fight a bear but that was a blessing and not knowing because God was setting him up for greater hallelujah can you think about it I like to say this you know you throughout a relationship or maybe a relationship between husband and wife if you knew everything about that person the relationship would be very dull and boring because you'd be like you robots no okay I can't surprise him because I know he knows you imagine you come on one day to your spouse with some flowers like oh yeah and he's gonna do that already what kind of relationship is that see so it's a blessing and not knowing every step because you have the ability you you you you you have the makeup to be surprised huh and that's why God hurry constantly unveils himself to us because he wants to keep us in surprise mode hurry up cuz we're getting situations and you'd be like why me why this happen why does the next thing you know you turn around and God has some flowers in your face I wasn't expecting that but see that makes a relationship so good cuz you have x in there when it's spontaneous other times in there when you're not expecting certain things hurry and what does that do that puts a smile on your face and it also boosts your confidence oh yeah you know if you your your relationship you come home every day and you got the same meal every day every day rice and gravy fried chicken greens macaroni and Cornbury that's a supreme meal for me I mean what did I walk smiling tell me but if I come home to that every day it will be boring because there'll be no more element of surprise and you know what if that happens every day hurry I could no longer crazy I don't know to crave it or have a desire for it because it's always there it's always there I don't I don't have a chance to miss it failure and that's what God does to us hurry up he keeps us in ammo when we're hungry and thirsting for righteousness oh yeah we're craving and desiring more God what does that do that gives the relationship because it's a blessing and not knowing what you're walking into think about a church God told Abraham I want you going wrong and walk my faith Church walking my faith is the ultimate hallelujah way of getting God's attention he says Abraham I need you go down to the land you know whose buildings and makers that man we know the story and Abraham starts the walk Abraham leaves the place where he's supposed to go and I he's walking down he's looking at his wife he's like man girl you look good you say you know what the king gonna try to kill me he's thinking all of King gonna try to come try to kill me cuz you look good he say you know what hey the closer we get down here when we get down in this land was talking to a ram fear see he doesn't have the confidence yet in his God Church he's the father faith but in this moment where was his faith it was still locked up earlier but God still didn't take away God is a man I can use you I gotta give me another father thing no he knows he does we initially call God know what he's doing when he initially call you the child and tribulation does not change God's purpose in your life just like when Peter denied the Lord three times that did not change that he was a son of God he denied him three times not only the night but he's trying cost the last time oh yeah but you look before you got there God aren't over here gave him the keys to the taint of God to touch for we never realize God is more confident in you blessing you not knowing it keeps it keeps my relationship with God fresh huh because I'm walking right now by faith I don't know what are you gonna do honey but I believe oh yeah I got I got I got financial issues in Hong Kong other stuff but hurry God said he will be my provider oh yeah so look what he's gonna do I don't know how certain bills certain things gonna be paid but I know he's done it before huh so I have my confidence in waiting call yeah so as I wait earlier God is looking at me watching my behavior in my demeanor and everything and then God gets surprised you say man is blowing on doubt me let me go and drop that blessing here waited long enough okay now I got you honey she sees the confidence you have him you're not wavering honey it doesn't matter what you're freaking me saying other people say all these things the problem that God said earlier when God took jobs through his trial God wanted to see somebody hallelujah that was gonna stand in his favor no matter what the church people were saying no matter what they saw with the eyes God told somebody who he was confident about it God he don't put us in situations to fail he put us in situations to grow honey that night night we've all had failures you know why we fail because we didn't listen while we were going through it that's why we fail without just fail that's not God God don't put us in positions of failure he put us in positions of growth honey you know you know you don't put your child on the porch if they can't walk so they can fall around and bust a head no God no things like that is your child learning how to walk you put on a level ground huh true level ground in areas of where we wish where they can't get hurt oh but they'll fall down but you know they'll get back up again you're expecting them to fall but you know in that moment they'll get back company they won't be so damaged by the fall they just walk away from no get back up again and that's what God does God doesn't put us in positions where we're so distraught we were like oh I can't be a Christian no he puts us in position hurry he pushes in situation when things come out of us hurry when the confidence comes out when we even know we had and just just a prime example God chose Abraham goki the boy and I get to the moment a man a confidence comes out that I didn't tell him anything about he says I'm the lad gonna go and I let go turn where did that come from there is a blessing of not knowing he didn't know if you did he will say this child or kill his child he just had to walk by faith and in him not knowing God was already produces a confidence such a confidence was coming up in that moment and Abraham didn't even realize what he was doing he speaks to his situation god never told him go down there and i'ma stop the night no he said o killin see the blessing your not knowing holy not knowing that confidence is right there in God and now in that moment Abraham says either they're gonna go huh I don't like a return that was the first step that God has been working on it oh and now he's just down there Arlena everything is gathered you got the fire you got you got you got you got all to all these things and Isaac says that I see everything else whereas the sacrifice Abraham's confidence speaks out against God we provide himself the confidence in that moment holier may hurry up what he needed materialized is the same thing happened in our prophets journey honey they were walking and going to God told him then you know he'll kill a silver to the caribou and all this he killed the caribou had vision everything just net killed the caribou and walking back down the mouth he said they could see clearly down from where the campground was to where he was and as they details burned wasn't a boy I was wrong with him blowing now you said that years will get a simple tip grizzly by the time you get back down here he said I was Lord told me he's a yeast you show right you mean down into the bottom where that guy standing with the green check shadow huh he said yeah he they bars you down he said how you say you play so he said but I can see clear to the bottom but the confidence God had but the confidence the prophet had in God he kept saying yes that's what God said yes I'm gonna get the Silvertip yes between here and there I'm gonna intercept him so whether the seventh team come from it came from his confidence not knowing what's gonna happen next believing in God and here comes the superchip he kills the Silvertip holy church before I close look God uses Gideon in when he scariest moments you know he's back yet hiding an angel comes and visits him in that so like God huh in one of your scariest situation God does something ugly to give you such a confidence that change a life forever you think you think about new Hebrew boys hallelujah now they already had an element accompli but God was gonna turn into supreme confidence he say he said music come maybe we need to come everybody fall down and worship then boy's head not else told me we don't worship without God we fall down we dance nothing our music we do another that and besides how God is able to deliver us every don't dude listen to this confidence if he doesn't deliver us we him Morris awesome nobody else could see but you know what talking talk is good oh how we say talk is cheap but what happens when you got to go through it you know you know we say you know who's in the world and different they used to happen who say you're mouthing didn't wrote a check that that you can't cash it look like the Hebrew boys my head wrote a check because in cash but it wasn't up to them because their conference was in there God the great deliverer look before they got to the fire they were already saying our God to deliver else now I was goggles stand back haven't even told the whole kingdom how God is using heosu magazine no I don't feel like delivering the night he got to because he got the big confident some more you know that new chance a lot of times your child is not for you but it's for the people watching you cuz God would have build that confidence in the real God you you'd be surprised and how many people I've met her that have had cancer or brain to like me and they tell me out my testimony help them so it wasn't hariya just me going through a trial no God will use that testimony to build go in a church he was they get down and walking put those in fire they step in fire God already plotting in heaven god I really look at that scene God got angels nothing oh come on let me go let me go deliver just let me go deliver them because they know that's his weight they know God's weight is a way of deliverance honey so god honey the angels are standing back saying go to this time let me go to this time I love when you use me in the motion of deliverance can I go let me meet wormwood I mean those Gabriel I can be mighty I can do and God says nope ain't none of y'all go understand they asked for me they said my God is able to deliver us so since I just believe I just believe before they even stepped in the fire God was already in there and when they walk did holy church when they walked in honey when they've stepped into that fire all three of them everybody got no then feel anything huh the clothes the clothes became fire resistant Wow they cause became fireproof they became firefighters before there ever was a firefighter Church and then oh yeah the witnesses come back and say I thought you do three of them in there they say no I see four look like the Son of God Seaton hey dealing with the confidence of the people looking around huh and think about it when the boys stuff not to fire everybody everybody around knew that their God was real produce the confidence in the whole land where where where they probably changed the whole ordinance on worship I'm a close I'm patata closer Gideon Gideon God wasn't doing him God say I want you to go down and fight take over everything so give me steps out with his large army but the army he wouldn't fight was three times bzees if it was 90,000 get it only had 30 that's already defeated battle unless you got some ammunition some secret weapons that day never seen before but this is all new to Gideon Gideon ain't know how to fight so just what God does God oh yeah God be your confidence it'll be unshakable now the blessing in not knowing getting is like how I got my 30 pound leg up by landing what we gonna do so God beginner God we're gonna do things that seem even more ridiculous God there you know you got two minutes just shake that down about ten dollars so he shake it down some more so they go out and he you know he thought yeah the only they just you know on the way in God says hey I want you separate I want you to put this group of winners group overhead you don't watch how they drink the water you know what y'all know I'm paraphrasing Bobby - ain't just like I'm paying phrase for the sake of time you know and you got this group over here this group / - everybody drinking you know I got him the Lord that drink you know ain't looking around Jim Jim didn't want you alone but he wasn't drinking and watching where they do it the other one she won't and just so happened it was only 300 m now you go from thousands to 300 it looked like Gideon should have no more confidence the one thing I love and blessing and not knowing how he's gonna win this battle because God made it look impossible so when he won the battle it would produce his confidence from there on out - never doubt God again he takes 300 million honey you go down God honey go into the camp stay at the camp and I always didn't not run Gideon had did nothing what was it it was the mighty God behind him it was mighty God it wasn't even the 300 me it was the mighty God behind him in one place before they're gonna fight God see some bees out and one of my favorites and I do this sometimes one of my favorite the king of the king of Syria wrote Hezekiah a letter tell Hezekiah not to trust in his God don't you trust in your God you seen what I did and you Brian you see what I did to the other kingdoms who trusted in any God don't you be foolish enough to trust in your God so you know his guy did Hezekiah took the letter did he win in the prayer and the Bible says he spread a little before a Lord and he was down to pray he read the letter to God he's a lord this is what the king of Syria is saying about you take your light wheel take your mortgage holder take your bank statements Oh God and you say this is what my financial situation is this is what they say that I shouldn't trust in you and my provider and better yet if I played my time it doesn't matter what it look like you still alive I'm already blessed I'm just waiting on God just feel my confidence in this area honey so Gideon wins the battle and you better leave from that point he never doubted God again look with Abraham gather the knife he was going down early the Bible says Abraham now I know you feel honey he says I won't hide nothing from you from this point on he and just just just give up stages of his journey in one place he was afraid told the king that's his right I mean I said sister when I was his wife he was afraid but then when God began to move with his life and God brought him out of that city can you imagine you lied to a person get all the stuff and that person come back you saying I'm sorry for you lying to me the key came back and apologized to Abraham for Abraham has lied to him wouldn't that builds your confidence we did let you know that God is behind you you didn't be in the room and the person you did wrong to come back apologize kneel and passing you on your journey now can't you see what color Abraham would take hallelujah uh-uh 318 service and go fight two kings because God had built this confidence back here even though he know he was wrong honey now he's going to get his brother hallelujah I'm gonna read you something that I'm a close and this is the statement just blows me away blows me away Church listen and if you witness if you are witness to anything you're just as guilty as being a project of it so if we witness say oh yes they are to have done this and so and so be careful what you say because you're guilty the way you judge the way your judgment goes if you can't decide don't say nothing honey you can't decide they'll say I'm gonna do this I'll be ready you don't know just say I don't know listen he said just leave it alone then when you testified that you are Christian then you're guilty see you're guilty of being a Christian and you must live to that and when that listen this is where I'm going and when God makes a promise in the Bible I see a man here in a wheelchair when God makes a promise he's guilty of that promise unless he brings it to pass huh my childhood Danny look skim milk to me hallelujah that's vitamin D right there huh he said when God makes a promise God is guilty of fulfilling that promise listen I it's gonna resonate a little bit more listen he said God is guilty when he makes a promise and oh my oh my let me back up back up he said what God makes a promise in the Bible hurry I see a man here in a wheelchair when God makes a promise he's guilty that promise unless he brings it to pass God is guilty when he makes a promise and the Scriptures are guilty until they are fulfilled oh I feel like the Pentecostal preacher y'all don't hear me God is Dukie unless that promise that you be in is fulfilled in your life this purchase I put myself in every broke my 70 book or so the Bible says higher if you delight yourself in the Lord he promised to give you the desires of your heart I know I got desires and I delight myself in the Lord so the stitches are Gucci a deal my desires are fulfilled promises all over the Bible and God has fulfilled him not to remain guilty I got a promise right now that God is working old because the Bible says that the Holy Ghost is unto you and unto your children the scriptures are duty with the Holy Ghost not in QG oh yes the scriptures are guilty hunt is the field in your life oh my see that's right as a statement that God has made and it's got to be fulfilled or God is guilty how can I innocent God be guilty he can't because that's not a part of his character you'll never find God guilty so one way or another he has to fulfill what you believe in and what does that do that Purdue see right now I'm confident I'm confident honey because I'm blessed in that know what's gonna happen but I'm confident because right here I just read a quotation that said God is guilty holy and to the promise of the word what I believe is fulfilled our life the Scriptures are guilty so if I go I want you to go home tonight read your scripture reread was pertaining to you read it earlier and read it sincerely huh really sincerely Lord this is your word I believe in you honey and God is guilty until that script the Scriptures are guilty and tears for fields in your life and you know what I might be I might be doing a whole night of the night so many things in I believe holding that I want to see in my life huh I might bridge s I might just start with I'm the head and not the tail okay I'm blessed tonight cursed her let the weak say I am strong hope so many promises in here earlier it has to be fulfilled oh my God look he did it again he said is Robbie with us there were be all the miracles huh he said I needed sweets to be this honey but God didn't stop dead kept building his confidence early God read I'm going to battle her looking like he was much more insufficient did he had a mighty guard on his side my mr. Church does have a word of Prayer Lord Jesus father we thank you for your word Lord and Lord for us as your children just to be able to look at the stall and think of it you our God being guilty there's no way possible that you could ever be guilty Lord father because you are your word you are reflected in your work you are revealed in your word so long the Scriptures have to come to pass so long we await for those promises to be fulfilled without us nor we thank you for us tonight Lord though we know that you're setting us up like you did Gideon for miracles to boost to build to sustain our confidence in you cuz it's not about us it's about the great God we serve so long we pray father that you will just keep our eyes attentively consecrated on you Tina bless brother Jesse his church lawyers family Lord all those Lords of this ministry connected over use all in the glory Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
