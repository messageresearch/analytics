[40:34] one that wrote that right there analyse
[40:37] amen she's she's famous around the world
[40:41] for that little song I guess we've sang
[40:42] it everywhere and I know it's been a
[40:44] lesson to many people she's working on
[40:47] another one something about and she
[40:49] ain't got it together yeah but it's
[40:50] something about when the devil says boo
[40:52] I say who and how many it's gonna be a
[40:55] good one I know it's coming on and I'm
[40:57] just waiting for it amen
[40:59] but we we like to see the Lord bring
[41:01] inspiration a man that
[41:03] I believe it can come no matter what the
[41:05] age is I don't think it has to be you
[41:07] know any kind of great big adult type
[41:10] thing you're nothing like that God could
[41:12] fall on a little sister here it could
[41:13] fall on sister here it could fall on
[41:15] these little young uns I I just believe
[41:17] God's mindful of us and he gives us
[41:20] songs in the night I think this at one
[41:21] time Amen I I like that hey let's turn
[41:25] in the Bible again diffusions chapter
[41:27] for a man I want to go a little bit
[41:30] different route this morning I felt like
[41:33] the the message as far as I'm concerned
[41:37] was right on target and I just feel like
[41:40] it's where we're living at and where
[41:41] we're at and I really felt like it was a
[41:44] blessing to the people and and I trust
[41:46] you were blessed by the words that were
[41:48] sitting you know usually in evangelism
[41:50] you and you you like brother Joel Forney
[41:53] says you helicopter up and parachute out
[41:55] well one thing I like about coming to
[41:58] Akron is I don't have to get in that
[41:59] mode when I'm there I can kind of slow
[42:02] down teach a little bit pardon me and
[42:07] get into a couple things and the depth
[42:09] of the scripture I I kind of like that
[42:11] because anybody that knows anything
[42:12] about my ministry at all they know I
[42:14] like to teach and I enjoy that I guess
[42:17] I'm a teacher at heart and I I enjoy
[42:20] being able to teach people the Word of
[42:21] God I think one of the most important
[42:24] things forgive me that we can learn is
[42:27] the precious Word of God don't you think
[42:29] so amen it's food and life and substance
[42:33] to all of us and I just thank the Lord
[42:36] for the Word of God all right you're
[42:38] reading with me now in Ephesians chapter
[42:41] 4 and we're gonna pick it back up again
[42:44] the Lord well in here on verse 25 and
[42:46] then we just want to read just a a verse
[42:49] or two of that the Lord helping us and
[42:51] then I want to try if got to give me the
[42:52] grace to get down to a few more places
[42:55] that I wanted to get to this evening
[42:58] wherefore putting away lying speak every
[43:01] man truth with his neighbor he says for
[43:06] we are members one of another did you
[43:10] notice that we are members one of
[43:14] another we are
[43:17] what not divided we're one a man we're
[43:21] one body and members in particular when
[43:24] one hurts we all hurt when one rejoices
[43:27] we all rejoice right now verse verse
[43:32] thirty-two drop it down there to where
[43:35] we picked up this morning for our
[43:36] thought be ye kind one to another be ye
[43:42] kind one to another let's pray
[43:46] Lord Jesus we thank you for your word
[43:49] Lord what a privilege it is to be
[43:51] gathered again in the house of the Lord
[43:54] hear the songs of Zion sang and how it
[43:57] thrills our hard to hear people to
[43:58] worship and for Lord we know that you
[44:00] dwell in our worship and our praise you
[44:04] come like is a place that we would make
[44:07] a boat a house or a bed or rest our
[44:10] praise is that place for your weary feet
[44:13] traveling through lady who see you Lord
[44:15] God may we just wipe those precious feet
[44:18] with the tears and with the hair no God
[44:22] as it was with a little prostitute that
[44:24] time and we take our glory for the
[44:26] woman's hair is her glory she laid it at
[44:29] the feet of Jesus Lord may we do that
[44:31] even right here this evening Lord lay
[44:33] all of our glory thoughts and attitudes
[44:35] and opinions and ever what might be of
[44:37] us that we laid at the feet of the Lamb
[44:40] of God help us as we look into the word
[44:43] I pray your blessing speak to us now as
[44:45] we commit the word to you both speaker
[44:47] listener in Jesus name Amen amen god
[44:52] bless you may be seated
[44:53] I usually have to ask the Saints to say
[44:56] man but thank you sir but y'all had such
[45:00] a good a man that I didn't even have to
[45:01] say everybody say hey man that was all
[45:04] right I like that and I thank the Lord
[45:07] for what we've read here I believe this
[45:09] is the Word of God
[45:11] and part of maybe a little drink water I
[45:14] got a tickle in my throat there you know
[45:16] that's one thing I don't like to tickle
[45:17] the devil I like to yell at it maybe
[45:20] it's like that now looking at the the
[45:23] verses that we read I want to really
[45:25] concentrate upon this what you hear in
[45:28] verse 25
[45:30] we are members one of another that we
[45:33] are one body one soul one mine in the
[45:38] book of Philippians Paul identifies when
[45:41] he says be you therefore like-minded
[45:44] he said be like-minded the term that he
[45:46] uses they're like-minded actually in the
[45:49] original Greek word means to be of the
[45:51] same soul in other words to be knit
[45:54] together as one or I feel that if we
[45:57] could recognize that part of the reason
[46:00] the Apostle Paul was dealing with the
[46:02] people in this regard was that he wanted
[46:05] them to understand that you are one body
[46:09] one mind one purpose your knitted
[46:12] together by the Holy Spirit and if you
[46:15] got the Holy Ghost and I've got the Holy
[46:16] Ghost brother Brennan said that Jesus
[46:19] burst himself on the day of Pentecost
[46:21] and that one pillar of fire went to you
[46:24] and went to me and went to others he
[46:26] said then when we come together to
[46:27] church like this he said it's like
[46:29] bringing that pillar of fire all back
[46:31] together again so we we are we are knit
[46:34] together in that relationship of being
[46:37] Christians children of God born again by
[46:39] the Holy Spirit and all of God's virtues
[46:42] everything you vested down inside of us
[46:45] to make the character of the bride of
[46:47] Jesus Christ it's given to us for the
[46:49] purpose of not only edifying Christ to
[46:53] the world but being able to take that
[46:55] little part of God that lays down inside
[46:57] of your heart and being able to use that
[47:00] to benefit the rest of the body Paul
[47:02] goes on to tell us and we don't have
[47:03] time to read these things I'll keep you
[47:05] here another two hours if I get into all
[47:06] that but I ain't gonna preach that loan
[47:08] tonight I'm just gonna jewel for any
[47:11] helicopters up parachutes I'm gonna use
[47:13] a parachute I'm just gonna get to the
[47:15] end and jump out and amen I I know it's
[47:17] I know it's Sunday evening but I want to
[47:20] just look for just a moment at a couple
[47:22] things about this body of Christ now
[47:24] going back into Ephesians there I want
[47:27] you to just to back up to the first
[47:29] chapter in that forth I'm sorry the
[47:31] first verse I mean to say in the fourth
[47:33] chapter and just read just a moment or
[47:35] two if you would just to get a
[47:37] background of this what I want to say
[47:38] what she says I therefore the
[47:42] of the Lord beseech you that you want
[47:44] worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are
[47:47] called with all lowliness and meekness
[47:49] long-suffering bearing forbearing one
[47:52] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[47:54] unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace
[47:58] there is how many bodies one body there
[48:03] is one spirit even as you called in one
[48:09] hope of your calling one Lord one faith
[48:13] one baptism one God and Father of all
[48:17] who is above all through all and Paul
[48:20] was a little bit of a bill Hillary is
[48:22] sitting in y'all amen
[48:24] it's in us that Christ as I referred to
[48:27] you earlier about this Jesus being
[48:30] Christ in you but notice one one one one
[48:35] one all through the theme of this is one
[48:38] body one Lord one Christ
[48:41] now we recognize that I'm just going to
[48:43] touch that for just a moment because I
[48:45] just want to get that in there so you
[48:46] can understand where I'm heading tonight
[48:48] but for us is the body of Christ
[48:50] everything that we are is made up of God
[48:54] now you remember what the prophet of God
[48:55] said in the rapture message he said that
[48:57] if you're a Christian right here tonight
[48:59] you were in God your father before the
[49:02] foundation of the world every gene every
[49:05] attribute every thought of God was in
[49:07] Christ before there was a son before
[49:10] there was a moon before there was
[49:11] anything at all God had all of us inside
[49:15] of him could you say it this way that we
[49:18] were one in Christ Jesus before the
[49:20] foundation of the world our names wrote
[49:22] on the Lamb's Book of Life our part to
[49:24] play was laid there in the mind of God
[49:27] we were one now we know according to
[49:30] what happened in the Garden of Eden that
[49:32] Satan then separated that fellowship
[49:35] from God and mankind
[49:37] you realize you look at the Garden of
[49:39] Eden what a perfect situation it was and
[49:41] you look at how the Holy Spirit set them
[49:44] or the Jesse in a paradise of God
[49:46] perfect every way that a man could think
[49:48] of perfect perfect love perfect joy
[49:50] perfect peace all of these perfect
[49:52] existed in the Garden of Eden
[49:55] yet you realize that God never intended
[49:58] for them to remain in that condition god
[50:01] never intended for the Garden of Eden to
[50:04] remain perfection but rather contrast
[50:07] the holy spirit had ordained Eve to be a
[50:10] type of condition her body everything
[50:14] was orchestrated so that Satan could get
[50:17] to her and caused the fall as he did in
[50:19] the Garden of Eden and in doing so it
[50:22] would break this place of perfection
[50:24] because remember the Prophet tells the
[50:26] spoke Virgil seed also Christ as the
[50:28] mystery that God predestinated Eve that
[50:31] she would fall from the Garden of Eden
[50:33] so it was not God's intention to place
[50:36] man in this perfect paradise place he
[50:39] brought thereby and and then allowed
[50:40] them to stay in such a state of
[50:42] perfection but actually God to break
[50:45] that perfection and allow it to be
[50:47] broken so that all of the attributes
[50:50] that laid on the inside of a man could
[50:52] be manifested through this negative line
[50:55] of Satan coming and defiling mankind and
[50:58] bringing all of his unbelief and what
[50:59] more to the earth now that was entirely
[51:02] and perfectly part of the will of God
[51:05] God intended for man to come to the eden
[51:09] come to this place of perfection and
[51:12] then allow the devil to break it through
[51:14] man into the permissive will of God and
[51:16] yet now this is what God intended to
[51:20] wrap back around in the end that he
[51:22] would take man out of permissive will
[51:24] place him right back into oneness again
[51:27] and then take him right back into the
[51:29] Garden of Eden and make it just as
[51:31] though he never fell in the beginning
[51:33] Amen it's a beautiful plan it's a
[51:35] beautiful plan of redemption it's a
[51:37] beautiful program that God's laid out
[51:39] for you and I but in this condition down
[51:41] here on the earth were all busted up
[51:43] were not one together like we should be
[51:45] one but there's separations there's
[51:48] schisms there's family strains and
[51:50] genetics and this thing and that thing
[51:52] that makes us different one from another
[51:55] for example there's people sitting in
[51:57] this room tonight in this little church
[51:59] here that they've got German running
[52:01] through them some have got Irish running
[52:03] through them some have got maybe maybe
[52:05] African descent running through them
[52:07] some have
[52:08] Asian descent running through them all
[52:10] of these little differences that let you
[52:11] you know this I found out just recently
[52:14] the name nor odd we thought come from
[52:16] France but actually goes farther than
[52:18] that it actually comes from Nordica from
[52:21] the Vikings and that's where the name
[52:23] narada ridge i said that's the reason i
[52:24] preach like i do i'm part viking amen i
[52:28] plunder and steal and all that kind of
[52:30] stuff but it's just the devils king and
[52:31] that's all I'm working on amen steel
[52:34] enjoy back in steel in peace back a man
[52:36] a man and you realize all of these
[52:38] different strains and things running
[52:40] down through us there's little divisions
[52:43] even in our skin color and our culture's
[52:45] and how we were raised
[52:47] the backgrounds of our alive and yet as
[52:49] we looked at as we closing this morning
[52:51] how that the Prophet said and the
[52:53] Michael said that God wanted unity out
[52:56] of his people he wanted us to be one
[52:58] even jesus prayed that way let them be
[53:01] one even as we in heaven are one Oh God
[53:04] now we realize in order for us to get
[53:06] there then we're first going to have to
[53:08] recognize our position in the body of
[53:11] Christ amen amen
[53:14] because once you see your position in
[53:15] the body of Christ then you realize
[53:17] nobody can take your place let me just
[53:21] say it this way once God puts you in
[53:23] nobody can hire you nobody can fire a
[53:25] man it's just as simple as there is
[53:28] saying one two three because once you
[53:30] are born again as a child of God once
[53:33] you receive the Holy Spirit you are in
[53:35] the body of Christ and can never be
[53:38] separated from the hand of God
[53:40] hey even Paul made the remark he said
[53:43] tell me what can separate us a man he
[53:46] said can famine can death can peril can
[53:48] sword can any of these things separate
[53:51] us he said no he said nothing can
[53:53] separate us from the love that is in
[53:55] Christ Jesus amen so as we were one with
[53:59] God we were also one with another the
[54:02] woman said to brother Branham at time
[54:03] said now brother Brennan said I don't
[54:05] understand this about Jesus being one
[54:07] with God being God you know and all this
[54:09] he said then the Bible say my wife and I
[54:12] are one said that's right and maybe it's
[54:14] the brother talkin and the sister EVER
[54:15] who spoke it I think she stepped out of
[54:18] her sister me t stepped out and other
[54:20] madam said now it's
[54:21] different in this way said we're one he
[54:23] said but when you see me you don't see
[54:25] me T he said but when Jesus spoke he
[54:27] said when you see me you've seen the
[54:29] father he said so a man and woman can be
[54:32] one but true one this goes beyond just
[54:34] being United in marriage
[54:36] just just consummating a marriage and
[54:38] being united by the way of the flesh
[54:40] remember what Paul spoke there in the
[54:41] book of Romans or Corinthians rather
[54:43] when he said that a man that joins
[54:45] himself to a harlot he's one with her he
[54:48] might be one by the way of the flesh his
[54:50] flesh may join with that woman and by
[54:52] the way of the flesh there might be a
[54:54] unity and even science will tell you
[54:56] there's a mixing of the chemistry
[54:58] there's a mixing of all types of little
[55:00] things that take place whenever a man
[55:02] and woman lay in the bed together
[55:03] forgive me for being plain but that type
[55:06] of oneness is not the kind of oneness
[55:08] that God is wanting out of us in other
[55:10] words the Lord Jesus is wanting us to be
[55:13] so absorbed in him that when you see us
[55:16] you see the Lord Jesus Christ when you
[55:18] see Christ you see the bride we are one
[55:21] we are one we are one in Christ Jesus
[55:25] amen amen oh it just gets good and good
[55:29] and good or don't it him had a man
[55:30] that's right then Paul tells us let all
[55:33] these things bitterness and wrath and
[55:34] clamor evil speaking want more let them
[55:37] depart and put them away from us why
[55:39] because we are one amen why would you
[55:44] want to have hatred against your arm I
[55:47] like my arm I like where is that if I
[55:50] Know Who I am how could I get mad at my
[55:52] foot your stupid foot I don't like it
[55:55] I'm gonna cut him off I would want to do
[55:56] that he's me a man if my foot stupid the
[56:00] rest of me is stupid hey hey come on
[56:02] somebody because what I am everything
[56:04] else is that's right exactly right now
[56:06] watch now as we as we look at this
[56:09] oneness of the Holy Spirit now I just
[56:11] want you to look at this remark ritum
[56:14] Adam says like this and I just love how
[56:16] he says about going to the house of God
[56:18] he said you see when you really hang on
[56:20] to every word of God he said see it's a
[56:23] leper who said like you take a boy and a
[56:26] girl going together he said if that
[56:28] young lady says well mama wants me to go
[56:30] with this guy but I can't stand him
[56:34] could you imagine what a love affair
[56:36] goes that way you pick it up for a date
[56:39] you imagine you curled your hair you're
[56:41] ready you see got perfume on the whole
[56:43] thing and he shows up you don't care if
[56:46] he's late you don't care if he's early
[56:47] you don't care if he ever shows up you
[56:50] know mama making me curl my hair mama
[56:53] making me wear perfume mom making me do
[56:55] this that the other well I've got to cuz
[56:57] that's what she said on a new hey man
[57:00] brother man said that's no love affair
[57:02] he said that when people go to church
[57:04] why does he preach so long what about
[57:08] all this other stuff and everything like
[57:10] that but man says see you're not in love
[57:14] amen he said because that woman he said
[57:17] if she's heard that girl said if she's
[57:19] going with that boy and she really loves
[57:21] him then it took it's not a drudgery so
[57:25] her it's not a chore do you know coming
[57:27] to church for some people as a chore
[57:30] it's a drudgery it's something they got
[57:33] to do to keep from going to hell you're
[57:35] not loved because if you're in love with
[57:38] Jesus coming to church and got nothing
[57:40] to do with keeping from going to hell if
[57:42] you're in love with Jesus coming to
[57:44] church is so that you can get me amen oh
[57:47] I just love it don't you love it so you
[57:50] come to the house of God it's so that
[57:51] you can find love of God so you can talk
[57:55] to your lever to your Redeemer any man I
[57:58] just love it that's why you come to
[58:00] church some I say well I come to church
[58:02] because I like the singing wonderful
[58:04] some I said I come to church I like the
[58:06] preacher wonderful but why are you in
[58:08] the house of God if it's not for a love
[58:10] affair that's what God wants out of us
[58:13] is a love affair with Jesus Christ
[58:15] that's right remember even brother Bama
[58:18] said it like this I quoted this some
[58:20] time ago and I'll tell you I I turned
[58:22] some message people upside down the
[58:24] other day and I didn't mean to because
[58:26] they are kind of these intellectual
[58:27] bumps they thought maybe the more they
[58:28] memorize the more they were going to go
[58:30] to heaven
[58:30] I guess there's going to be a special
[58:32] place in heaven for the folks that
[58:34] memorized every quote I guess I don't
[58:35] know to them it must have been and I
[58:38] quoted this under the inspiration of the
[58:40] Lord I didn't mean to say it it just
[58:41] comes through the inspiration of
[58:43] preaching and I said to know the book is
[58:45] not to know him well
[58:47] you should sing the metres per cup
[58:48] because today I'm knowing the book was
[58:51] life but then I found in several places
[58:53] where the prophet of God said to know
[58:55] the book is not to know life but to know
[59:00] Him who is the author of this word
[59:04] that's what life comes people that's got
[59:08] it in their mind I'll memorize the
[59:09] message I'll memorize the quotes I
[59:11] memorized that's wonderful but that's
[59:13] still you can do all of that and still
[59:15] not know Jesus Christ exactly said see
[59:18] you're not in love but when you hang on
[59:20] every word oh that's how I see people
[59:22] come to church if I have if I have a
[59:25] training class for people this is going
[59:27] to be the first lesson right here learn
[59:29] how to hang on every word falling in
[59:31] love of Jesus
[59:32] I promise brother sister the problem I
[59:35] think that we see around the message
[59:37] friends is that people just aren't in
[59:39] love with the Lord that's what it really
[59:41] boils down to they they like the church
[59:43] they like the people that go to the
[59:45] church they enjoy the area or the
[59:46] location or whatever just like when I
[59:48] was in Grand Falls new Newfoundland this
[59:51] last weekend now you don't know where
[59:53] Newfoundland is unless you're a new for
[59:54] yourself because nobody goes there it's
[59:56] not a vacation spot you might go there
[59:58] to see twill and gating icebergs but
[1:00:00] after 20 seconds tours over it just
[1:00:03] isn't a vacation spot is cold all the
[1:00:05] time we were there last weekend I mean I
[1:00:08] don't think you got above 60 degrees one
[1:00:09] day I think you'd hit 72 and that was a
[1:00:12] heat wave people were out in their
[1:00:13] bikinis and everything on the lawns and
[1:00:15] and playing in the water I thought God
[1:00:17] we still got a coat on a man it's not
[1:00:20] even right just yet you understand but
[1:00:22] you know those people down there their
[1:00:25] pastor died on about five about four
[1:00:27] years ago and I was asking some of the
[1:00:30] people this question now they're the
[1:00:31] only church in that area there's not
[1:00:33] another Church within about four and a
[1:00:35] half hours is the only other Church on
[1:00:36] that island out there and I asked some
[1:00:39] of them folks I said not ask you a
[1:00:40] question I said if God sent you a man
[1:00:43] toot willing gate which is two and a
[1:00:44] half hours away from them I said in God
[1:00:47] sent you a pastor two and a half hours
[1:00:48] away I said how many of you be willing
[1:00:50] to pack up and move well you talk about
[1:00:52] a mule staring at a new gate everybody
[1:00:55] looking at me I said so in other words
[1:00:57] what you're trying to say is that you
[1:01:00] want go
[1:01:00] to provide a manager convenience rather
[1:01:04] than provided because you're in love of
[1:01:06] Christ and I wonder friends if that
[1:01:08] ain't why some people just come to
[1:01:09] church because it's convenient for them
[1:01:12] to come to the house of God because it
[1:01:14] works into their schedule Oh Lord the
[1:01:16] longer I preach quarter sum you get now
[1:01:19] this that's exactly what you got to ask
[1:01:21] yourself remember the Queen of the South
[1:01:23] a brother broke it down one time and
[1:01:26] I'll tell you that the numbers are
[1:01:27] staggering when you look in today's
[1:01:29] figures all of that money and things
[1:01:31] that she was able to put together it was
[1:01:34] in the billions and the trillions of
[1:01:35] dollars that she's sold and brought with
[1:01:38] her and what more to hear the wisdom of
[1:01:40] Solomon you know I think about some of
[1:01:42] you people sitting out here
[1:01:43] amen some of you got two and three hour
[1:01:45] drives going in out-of-home I think
[1:01:47] about these folks here Wendy and some of
[1:01:49] y'all that live way on alpha wait amen
[1:01:52] you're not coming all these miles to
[1:01:54] occupy a room I know air conditioned in
[1:01:56] it because you like the Church of the
[1:01:57] color of the chairs but you're coming
[1:01:59] because you love Almighty God and you're
[1:02:01] hoping to meet Jesus while you're here
[1:02:05] amen but yet brother Bama said people
[1:02:07] and air-conditioned Cadillacs won't go
[1:02:09] across the street to hear the gospel and
[1:02:11] she sold out everything she had to hear
[1:02:14] the wisdom of Solomon Amen it wonders
[1:02:17] makes you wonder are people in love
[1:02:18] today the question that I really want to
[1:02:21] find out from message people as I travel
[1:02:23] is are we really in love with Jesus or
[1:02:26] we love with a message or a messenger or
[1:02:28] a church or a way of doing things that
[1:02:31] makes us feel good about our religion
[1:02:33] you see people can go to a scary movie
[1:02:36] and they can have chills run down their
[1:02:38] back then come church and have the same
[1:02:40] feeling we don't come to church for the
[1:02:43] feeling of it I love to feel the Lord
[1:02:46] but my loyalty doesn't move on the
[1:02:48] feelings I feel
[1:02:49] hey come on some on it I don't move
[1:02:51] because I feel a certain way I am a
[1:02:54] priest called of God to sacrifice and
[1:02:57] worship and you know what whether I feel
[1:02:59] him or whether I don't feel it I am
[1:03:01] called to worship him anyways ever and
[1:03:03] eyelash of no matter whether I feel it
[1:03:05] or I don't but for some people it's the
[1:03:08] convenience of the thing if Jesus is
[1:03:11] having and being it for them to feel
[1:03:12] blessed or they'll be blessed that night
[1:03:14] but they don't want to move out of their
[1:03:15] comfort zone to work in a way that maybe
[1:03:18] the blessing would be a far off but
[1:03:20] you've got to work for it oh I know we
[1:03:23] don't like this kind of preaching as
[1:03:24] human beings because any time we have to
[1:03:26] work that's hard we don't like that I
[1:03:28] think some Christians have moved into
[1:03:30] spiritual retirement around this message
[1:03:32] a man they just want to sit on a Pew and
[1:03:35] draw a spiritual pension well I'm
[1:03:37] getting over am i but it's the truth
[1:03:39] anyhow
[1:03:40] hey that's right but to get somewhere in
[1:03:42] God you've got to make the efforts that
[1:03:44] it takes to be able to bond in the holy
[1:03:47] spirit that's right he said see you're
[1:03:50] not in love he said hanging out when you
[1:03:52] really love him you're hang on to every
[1:03:54] word he said just as the Holy Spirit
[1:03:56] gave warning this morning he said
[1:03:57] hanging every word he said he might have
[1:03:59] been talking about that see it's eternal
[1:04:01] life every word of God then he says
[1:04:04] these words and listen to this it's a
[1:04:06] joy to go to church under any
[1:04:09] circumstance I didn't know the second
[1:04:12] dinner won't be waiting on that part but
[1:04:14] I think the Lord let me put this quote
[1:04:16] in here just for this little body this
[1:04:18] weekend but brother BAM says whether
[1:04:20] it's hot you ought to be able to say
[1:04:23] Amen relied on that one
[1:04:24] and whether it's cold whether it's
[1:04:27] indifferent whether the people are
[1:04:29] fussing or growling or whatever they're
[1:04:31] doing it is a joy to hear the word of
[1:04:34] the Lord amen amen
[1:04:38] he says then you're in love then with
[1:04:40] Christ you love to go to church he says
[1:04:44] Oh hallelujah oh thank you lord thank
[1:04:48] you lord
[1:04:48] now that's where a Christian are to look
[1:04:51] at this because we are one body we are
[1:04:55] one together in a way that the Holy
[1:04:58] Spirit has knit us together now watch
[1:05:00] this you have to have respect for each
[1:05:03] other now this morning we were looking
[1:05:05] at a couple of things that Paul said one
[1:05:07] thing that we didn't touch was this on
[1:05:08] anger be ye angry and sin not now let me
[1:05:12] just give you the idea what anger means
[1:05:13] here anger is clamor or noise or
[1:05:17] disorder or men words that men would use
[1:05:20] in a brawl men the words that meant men
[1:05:23] would use in a brawl he said but
[1:05:25] Christians are
[1:05:27] to be calm there are to be serious
[1:05:30] without contention and strife and he
[1:05:32] said without brawls and Tolman's he said
[1:05:35] not to be known among the people he said
[1:05:37] but anger is also unreasonable anger it
[1:05:42] makes sense when somebody does something
[1:05:44] to be upset about it you're a human
[1:05:46] being you're never going to turn that
[1:05:47] off somebody does something wrong cut
[1:05:49] you off in traffic ever what it might be
[1:05:51] that human reaction raises up that's
[1:05:53] something that's a part of you all the
[1:05:56] days of your life but don't give
[1:05:58] yourself over to becoming unreasonably
[1:06:01] angry angry to the point to where you
[1:06:04] start making steps or taking steps to
[1:06:07] try to get back at that person or to try
[1:06:09] to show them your mind I've told people
[1:06:12] a thousand times
[1:06:13] be careful giving pieces of your mind
[1:06:15] the way you've only got so many you may
[1:06:16] end up running out after a while
[1:06:18] amen but everybody's got this attitude
[1:06:21] this idea well glory to God I want to
[1:06:24] tell you something right now they've
[1:06:25] done such and said I'm gonna boil it out
[1:06:27] for it that's unreasonable anger there
[1:06:30] is an anger that is reasonable to God
[1:06:33] you say well I don't believe that well
[1:06:35] you just need to read the Bible Jesus
[1:06:37] looked on him with anger amen brother
[1:06:40] man who said he was acting like a deacon
[1:06:41] when he took chords and beat him out of
[1:06:43] the temple one day well that's what he
[1:06:46] said he said he was acting like the part
[1:06:49] of a deacon playing the role of the
[1:06:50] deacon he said Amen listen if a deacon
[1:06:53] walked in here tonight and took chords
[1:06:54] and beat you out of the church you had
[1:06:56] put it on the Better Business Bureau on
[1:06:58] Facebook you would join we believe the
[1:07:00] sign and everybody they wouldn't wasn't
[1:07:01] believed in the Sun hey come on somebody
[1:07:04] why because as humans that humans
[1:07:07] something in us always trying to get
[1:07:09] back
[1:07:09] amen but Paul says you're one you're one
[1:07:14] and if you realize what you do to this
[1:07:17] one you're doing it to yourself what you
[1:07:20] do to that one you're doing it to
[1:07:22] yourself because if they're a part of
[1:07:24] the body of Christ and I'm part of the
[1:07:25] body of Christ what I do to you is I'm
[1:07:28] doing it to myself
[1:07:29] exactly listen this for example in
[1:07:32] respects here's a good example of one
[1:07:34] tall mount paragraph 165 with a man who
[1:07:36] says now if you can't respect the man
[1:07:39] respect the office that he holds a man
[1:07:43] that's exactly right he said see if a
[1:07:45] minister comes your pastor he said
[1:07:47] always respect him I've heard
[1:07:49] congregations talk about their pastor
[1:07:52] run him down ridiculing he said how is
[1:07:56] that pastor ever gonna do anything for
[1:07:59] you he can't do it he said I don't say
[1:08:03] this Church but I see churches he said
[1:08:05] that that's done that he said you've got
[1:08:06] to love your pastor you've got to know
[1:08:09] that he's a human being
[1:08:10] oh don't rush past that that's a good
[1:08:14] thing to know you got to know he's a
[1:08:16] human being
[1:08:18] listen I know Jesse's repopulating Ohio
[1:08:22] I get that I know he's Superman I know
[1:08:26] he can he can leap a troop and I know
[1:08:29] the man can do anything but he's still a
[1:08:32] man I know that he doesn't keep a
[1:08:36] Superman ass underneath that shirt and
[1:08:38] tie that he's wearing he's a human being
[1:08:41] he gets discouraged sometimes he gets
[1:08:45] upset at conditions he sees people get
[1:08:47] into sometimes that human part gets
[1:08:51] aggravated see you know a Manjula but
[1:08:55] see if I hadn't run past that quote we'd
[1:08:56] have some good preaching right here but
[1:08:58] to me this is the good preaching but
[1:09:02] he's everybody's a he's a pastor he
[1:09:04] should put up with it he's built to do
[1:09:05] it but he's still a human being and
[1:09:08] listen just because the man has got a
[1:09:10] gift in his life that doesn't mean that
[1:09:12] he doesn't feel sometimes like you wish
[1:09:13] he didn't have it well hallelujah we're
[1:09:19] gonna get as quiet as a method sent here
[1:09:21] for us over with he's a human you got to
[1:09:25] understand that are you saving Laurie to
[1:09:27] God if he's a pastor he can't make no
[1:09:30] mistakes where's that in the Bible I'd
[1:09:34] like to know chapter verse and quote I'd
[1:09:40] like to see where people get this idea
[1:09:42] if he's a preacher he's not allowed to
[1:09:44] make any mistakes
[1:09:45] what about turn that around on
[1:09:46] congregations what about set it on a
[1:09:50] message congregation your
[1:09:52] to make any mistakes because you're a
[1:09:55] congregation getting quietly amen
[1:10:01] hey sauce for the goose is good for the
[1:10:03] gander y'all what if you turn two thing
[1:10:06] around but you see as human beings were
[1:10:10] bound to do things and miss the mark
[1:10:12] sometimes there's times that I that I
[1:10:16] the Lord of correct me on something I
[1:10:18] realize I've absolutely missed the mark
[1:10:21] of God Lord of show me I have to make a
[1:10:23] tried oh it discourages me to death when
[1:10:26] I find out that I've done something this
[1:10:27] pleases the Lord I hate it I hate it I
[1:10:30] kicked around for days oh I repent and I
[1:10:32] put it his hands all that but I still
[1:10:33] remember the crazy thing I remember what
[1:10:35] I did and it frustrates and I get
[1:10:38] aggravated at myself and I think why in
[1:10:40] the world did you do the stupid thing
[1:10:42] that you've done ten thousand times you
[1:10:44] know you shouldn't have done it you done
[1:10:45] it again anyhow but I'm a human being
[1:10:48] I'm susceptible to do things as a human
[1:10:52] would do it so before you can have the
[1:10:55] right respect you got to know he's a
[1:10:57] pastor but he's a human bastard hey man
[1:11:03] we we bout to sing a man a man and a man
[1:11:07] hallelujah right but yet God made him
[1:11:10] his pastor with him said his pastor like
[1:11:13] that the Holy Ghost made him overseer
[1:11:15] and you've got to respect him in that
[1:11:18] manner in what manner that he's a pastor
[1:11:21] but he's also a human listen friends
[1:11:23] I've heard people around this message
[1:11:25] look at that I mean in their way there
[1:11:27] may not say this from their lips but
[1:11:29] they're looking for the perfect Church I
[1:11:30] said it doesn't exist and if it did the
[1:11:32] minute you show up you've earned it but
[1:11:37] you're not perfect yourself neither am i
[1:11:39] there's no way that we can have
[1:11:41] perfection amongst us Christ is the one
[1:11:44] that perfects us Christ in Christ alone
[1:11:48] our perfection is between my soul and
[1:11:52] God my flesh will never be perfected it
[1:11:56] can't be it's an enemy to God only the
[1:12:00] best thing I can do is take this enemy
[1:12:02] and put the chains of the Word of God
[1:12:04] around him and drag
[1:12:05] the rapture and make him live right
[1:12:10] make him pray make him go to church make
[1:12:14] him love one another mm-hmm were one
[1:12:19] you've got to respect him you said if
[1:12:22] you can't respect him in your heart as
[1:12:23] God's servant he said you said then you
[1:12:26] respect can't respect to manage that
[1:12:28] respect his office if you could respect
[1:12:30] him in your heart as God servants that
[1:12:31] God will respect you for doing that
[1:12:33] amen that's right he that receiveth me
[1:12:36] receiveth him that sent me a man jesus
[1:12:40] said I said he's a representative or an
[1:12:43] ambassador of me either don't receive me
[1:12:46] receive him that I sent rather cannot
[1:12:48] receive me he said that God was there
[1:12:51] they said god is our father Abraham is
[1:12:53] our Father instead of God with your
[1:12:55] father and so forth he said you would
[1:12:57] understand me he said but you are of
[1:12:59] your father the devil why because they
[1:13:01] would not receive Jesus whom God sent to
[1:13:04] the earth as a representative of
[1:13:06] Almighty God but then remember he said
[1:13:09] you've got to respect him and believe
[1:13:12] him that he is Martha standing at the
[1:13:15] chat the grave of Lazarus the pastor
[1:13:17] didn't respond in four days now you know
[1:13:21] what a lot of people would have done
[1:13:22] then it picked up their membership went
[1:13:24] somewhere else I can't get him to answer
[1:13:27] the phone I can't are you serving the
[1:13:29] pastor you're serving God which one are
[1:13:31] you serving and then you take a man like
[1:13:35] brother Jesse he's raising a family like
[1:13:37] I said he's repopulating Ohio him my
[1:13:43] brother-in-law is the same way I keep
[1:13:45] quoting to him what brother mom said to
[1:13:46] Billy Paul that dot he said multiply and
[1:13:48] replenish but he didn't leave the job
[1:13:50] all in one person he works he's got a
[1:13:56] job I'm just I'm just I'm picking on
[1:13:58] everybody today I guess he's got things
[1:14:01] that he's got to do he's got kids he's
[1:14:02] got a raise he's got a wife he's got to
[1:14:04] take care of he's got a minister he's
[1:14:06] got to think about he's got outreach is
[1:14:08] out there people can't expect a man to
[1:14:10] be at their beck and call although they
[1:14:12] do they expect that they expect the man
[1:14:15] to have all the answers a moment they
[1:14:17] ask him
[1:14:18] well here at pasture you should know the
[1:14:20] answer but is a human pastor he's a
[1:14:24] human being that may not know the answer
[1:14:26] till he prays about it a while studies
[1:14:29] have added a while sees what the
[1:14:30] prophets see what brother bream said and
[1:14:32] the Bible said about certain things he's
[1:14:34] a human being but can you understand
[1:14:37] just this little example how disjointed
[1:14:40] the people of the churches can get if
[1:14:42] we'll one they cannot take their attack
[1:14:45] against their own body do you realize
[1:14:47] that when the churches attack the pastor
[1:14:50] the pastor attacks or the church
[1:14:52] attacking one another do you know what
[1:14:54] it is it's called suicide it's the very
[1:14:58] same principle is if a man or woman
[1:15:01] would hang them set foot a gun to their
[1:15:03] head it's the same idea altogether to
[1:15:06] assassinate your brother is to hurt you
[1:15:09] as well praise the Lord
[1:15:14] spiritual suicide in the churches listen
[1:15:17] to this and why we're not a denomination
[1:15:19] but Bevin said one reason that we're not
[1:15:21] a denomination he said because we don't
[1:15:23] answer to anybody he said I like that
[1:15:25] I'd rather stay clean and pure before
[1:15:27] the word of God he said and stand there
[1:15:30] and say there's no man's blood upon my
[1:15:31] garment he says is the best way we
[1:15:34] stayed to brendham tabernacle we're not
[1:15:35] Assemblies we're not oneness we're not
[1:15:37] Jesus only
[1:15:38] we're not Methodists we're not Baptist
[1:15:40] this little Tabernacle here we have no
[1:15:42] denomination all were free in Christ
[1:15:45] that's why we stay the way we do and God
[1:15:47] has blessed us and helped us he said now
[1:15:50] we tell why we take what he said we tell
[1:15:52] you why we take communion and tell you
[1:15:54] why we take feet wash and we don't won't
[1:15:56] let members take it if we know that
[1:15:58] they're in sin he said that's why this
[1:16:00] last two or three weeks I've been going
[1:16:02] from one member to another and watch
[1:16:04] this well you're a little having your
[1:16:06] little fuss is going around going around

[1:16:12] other on the road and turn your head
[1:16:13] shame on you he says you who took the
[1:16:18] blest cup of God across this altar here
[1:16:21] and call you brothers and sisters and
[1:16:24] then get on the telephone and get off
[1:16:26] about one another you're not fit to be
[1:16:28] called Christians when you're that way
[1:16:30] he said that's right keep
[1:16:32] often telephones or Facebook or Twitter
[1:16:34] or Instagram or whatever else they're
[1:16:36] using if you can't talk good about
[1:16:38] somebody don't talk at all amen
[1:16:41] remember God's gonna hold you
[1:16:43] responsible not now why is brother
[1:16:45] Branham dealing with this because we're
[1:16:48] one I mean friends if if they're not one
[1:16:53] then why even care
[1:16:54] let him fuss let them argue let him just
[1:16:58] let them carry on and create a bunch of
[1:17:00] nonsense it who cares let them do it
[1:17:03] they want to do I've heard I've heard
[1:17:04] ministers of the Gosselin I don't care
[1:17:06] what they do something wrong cuz we're
[1:17:10] one and if we're one we should care one
[1:17:13] another
[1:17:14] listen if you don't show up to church
[1:17:16] here pull is missed your pool is missed
[1:17:20] you don't take part in communion it's
[1:17:23] missed feet washing brother jewel for
[1:17:27] nieces foots washing all of these things
[1:17:32] make us body make us one we're one in
[1:17:36] spirit one and heart that's right
[1:17:41] well somebody started a little something
[1:17:44] said he needs to come to me my bands oh
[1:17:46] no you're wrong he said the Bible said
[1:17:49] you go to him
[1:17:50] hi-y friends because we're one if
[1:17:55] something is wrong with my body and
[1:17:57] let's say a gangrene sets up in the in
[1:17:59] my finger well I'm not gonna look at
[1:18:01] that gangrene say when you're ready to
[1:18:04] get it right come see me I'm going to it
[1:18:07] I'm gonna go right to the source of that
[1:18:09] problem and I'm gonna say you're getting
[1:18:12] fixed if I ignore don't kill me if I
[1:18:17] ignore it it'll take Christ right out of
[1:18:19] my life we're a body don't forget this
[1:18:22] is one body right he said now he said
[1:18:26] when they won't listen to you take a
[1:18:28] witness he said then they tell it to the
[1:18:30] church and then 30 days is these people
[1:18:32] that sit in sin now and done things you
[1:18:34] know that's that's Bremen said insulting
[1:18:36] the women or trying to make perverts on
[1:18:38] the boys or something like that but he
[1:18:40] said if they want to live right live
[1:18:41] clean you know the blood of Christ
[1:18:43] protects them but he said as long
[1:18:45] as that brothers under the protection of
[1:18:47] the church the blood of Christ is
[1:18:49] protecting that's the reason the church
[1:18:51] doesn't get rolling he said notice he
[1:18:54] said for example say Leo and I had a
[1:18:56] fuss here he said well you know you
[1:18:58] wronged me he said I'm supposed to go to
[1:19:01] him he's a member of this church he
[1:19:03] become a Christian takes communion the
[1:19:05] rail with me here been baptized the name
[1:19:07] of Lord Jesus walking upright his
[1:19:08] brothers he said it ain't the man he
[1:19:11] said what you realize 90% of the time
[1:19:13] it's the devil that's got between people
[1:19:16] hey man and as long as you're letting
[1:19:19] the devil do that you're harming your
[1:19:22] brother so you see for yourself when
[1:19:27] something's wrong you don't wait for
[1:19:29] somebody to come make it right with you
[1:19:31] that'd be like saying okay gangrene fix
[1:19:34] it you got a you got a a deadly sore
[1:19:38] it's gonna kill you but you be the fixer
[1:19:41] he can't he's sick and the Bible said
[1:19:45] you that are spiritual or can I say this
[1:19:47] way you that are healthy you go to the
[1:19:50] sick one and you try to restore them
[1:19:52] back into the phone hey man that's Bible
[1:19:55] teaching but BAM said if there's
[1:19:57] something wrong with Leo and I said we
[1:19:59] go make it up he said it's your duty to
[1:20:00] come say now both boys have got this
[1:20:03] together they're getting the things
[1:20:04] straightened up he said they come to the
[1:20:06] church and said at first we find it
[1:20:07] can't agree when you come to the church
[1:20:09] like that they said as long as you don't
[1:20:11] do nothing about it the blood of Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ protects us both lyses words he
[1:20:16] said but that old cancer will start
[1:20:18] another cancer and then that cancer will
[1:20:20] start another cancer and another and
[1:20:22] another and another until the heart
[1:20:24] church will be sick over this one little
[1:20:27] thing he said then you'll come to church
[1:20:30] and it'll be just as cold the janitor
[1:20:33] will have to break the icicles before
[1:20:35] the congregation can even get in why
[1:20:39] because people don't recognize were one
[1:20:42] one body one group were one of another
[1:20:46] amen were one of another notice in the
[1:20:50] word of the church Christ is the mystery
[1:20:52] I'm not gonna read the whole thing we've
[1:20:53] read it probably ten thousand times but
[1:20:55] I just want to catch a couple highlights
[1:20:56] he said love one another
[1:20:59] but everything love one another there's
[1:21:06] John the Revelator he wrote the seals
[1:21:08] wrote the thunders wrote the plagues
[1:21:10] wrote the vials and his dying days they
[1:21:13] set him up in a low chair could even
[1:21:15] stand and preach anymore and just leaned
[1:21:17] back as a little children love one
[1:21:19] another it is the theme of all of our
[1:21:24] Christian experience if we are one with
[1:21:26] another then above everything else love
[1:21:30] one another no matter what the devil
[1:21:32] tries to say glory you're all one big
[1:21:35] great sweet group now but remember my
[1:21:37] warning Satan won't let it stay that way
[1:21:40] boy did he ever come in and fulfill
[1:21:42] these words later on he said he'll shoot
[1:21:44] everything if he has to bring somebody
[1:21:46] in to make him the target he'll bring a
[1:21:49] critic unbeliever and cause them to
[1:21:51] fellowship under quietness and things
[1:21:53] and shoot that guy with poison stuff and
[1:21:57] when we talked about this morning then
[1:21:58] boysenberries shoot him with poison
[1:22:01] stuff and he'll start through the church
[1:22:03] with it don't you take sides with it
[1:22:05] don't have nothing to do with anything
[1:22:07] else they loving sweet kind one to
[1:22:08] another pray for the man that he'll be
[1:22:10] saved or the woman ever who it is pray
[1:22:12] for him and stick one with another amen
[1:22:16] that's exactly right and he says not the
[1:22:18] Klan or make yourself clannish we are
[1:22:21] one is I couldn't say to my left hand
[1:22:25] I'm mad at you he said I'm gonna get rid
[1:22:28] of you he says in my left hand I want
[1:22:30] him right where he's at he said don't
[1:22:33] get rid of that pop body part hold on to
[1:22:35] it you realize friends that many times
[1:22:38] when we come to the house of God I don't
[1:22:41] think we fully recognize that we are one
[1:22:43] body and being one say you look at the
[1:22:46] church tonight and you're sick in your
[1:22:48] body well you want somebody to pray for
[1:22:50] you sure but you know that goes beyond
[1:22:53] just those type of things
[1:22:54] everybody in this church right here has
[1:22:56] a gift of some sort you some people are
[1:22:59] gift of organizers they know how to
[1:23:01] organize a fellowship they know how to
[1:23:03] make the thing run other people try to
[1:23:05] organize a fellowship and they're
[1:23:06] pulling their hair out by the end of the
[1:23:07] day but there's other people that are
[1:23:09] gifted in the ability of knowing how to
[1:23:11] entertain
[1:23:12] people and people in churches will get
[1:23:15] jealous of things like that Oh what the
[1:23:17] world a the ones always doing the thing
[1:23:19] well you have your party see how it
[1:23:22] works out a lot of times people just
[1:23:25] aren't gifted for it but rather than
[1:23:27] grab the football from the one who's got
[1:23:29] it blocked for the one who's doing the
[1:23:31] good because we're one if the body is to
[1:23:34] operate remember the body right here in
[1:23:37] Akron the body is not Jesse Smith the
[1:23:40] body is everybody Amen it's not just the
[1:23:43] pastor in other words but it's the
[1:23:45] entire body of Jesus Christ I got my
[1:23:48] clock I'm gonna go long tonight so here
[1:23:50] we go for six verse 32 Amen there's an
[1:23:54] old expression I'm gonna try to give you
[1:23:56] your money's worth as the fresh and goes
[1:23:57] with Amen I I know I know you're tired
[1:24:01] you wore out you've been traveling you
[1:24:02] working hard and and I understand that
[1:24:06] thank God for it

[1:24:10] words of the Lord Jesus for if you love
[1:24:12] them which love you what thank have you
[1:24:16] in other words what glory do you get out
[1:24:18] of that to me it's an easy thing to like
[1:24:26] people who like you to love people who
[1:24:30] love you that's easy the hard parts when
[1:24:33] they don't when they don't have nothing
[1:24:36] to do for you even Jesus said here for
[1:24:39] sinners love those that love them do
[1:24:45] give to them to do good to you if you do
[1:24:47] it
[1:24:47] what think have you for sinners do the
[1:24:49] same if you lend to them who have a hole
[1:24:51] in habit of whom you have excuse me I
[1:24:54] can't even talk lord have mercy if you
[1:24:56] lend to them of whom he had hope to
[1:24:59] receive I get it out one of these nights
[1:25:01] God mercy all right let me try it again
[1:25:04] praise the Lord all right are you ready
[1:25:06] if if you lend to them of whom you hope
[1:25:10] to receive hallelujah what thank have ye
[1:25:13] in other words if you give to somebody
[1:25:16] hoping to get Ussery off of it you
[1:25:18] didn't do it right because when you give
[1:25:22] you're supposed to give out of the
[1:25:24] abundance of your giving into your bro
[1:25:26] there's bosom not looking for return why
[1:25:31] does everybody think we're talking about
[1:25:32] money maybe you're a gardener
[1:25:35] maybe you've got a good garden this year
[1:25:37] share your mater's share your taters
[1:25:41] oh that's tomatoes and potatoes for you
[1:25:44] northern folk maybe God has given some
[1:25:50] of you sisters the ability to sell so
[1:25:52] something for somebody we're one your
[1:25:56] gifts are to edify the body brother was
[1:26:00] talking about being involved in real
[1:26:01] estate let him buy your house amen
[1:26:08] well one do something one for another in
[1:26:10] other words whatever gifts you've got
[1:26:12] put it into circulation amen
[1:26:15] mmmm talked about going he said I read
[1:26:18] it the other day and investments were
[1:26:19] talking about don't hold on to your
[1:26:20] money he said make it work he said put
[1:26:23] it into circulation Jesus used the same
[1:26:25] idea whenever he talked about the
[1:26:27] thought about the idea come Jesus I
[1:26:29] should savor the RAM use the idea but
[1:26:31] the Lord Jesus said about taking your
[1:26:34] talents and sending it to the exchangers
[1:26:36] that doesn't mean it's necessarily being
[1:26:39] able to make it investment on a dollar
[1:26:41] or $10 or $100 or ever what it is but
[1:26:44] maybe your investment would be maybe
[1:26:46] you've got a family in the church that
[1:26:48] don't even have a good bed maybe you can
[1:26:50] go to Walmart Miami nice air mattress
[1:26:51] you with me just a little bit amen
[1:26:56] this is what Jesus is talking about that
[1:26:58] we are one with another I'll give to
[1:27:01] them looking in exchange
[1:27:02] that's what sinners do sinners do the
[1:27:06] exact same thing don't do that but love
[1:27:09] you your enemies and do good lend hoping
[1:27:12] for nothing again could you imagine that
[1:27:15] hoping for nothing again I give to this
[1:27:17] brother oh I sure hope he don't give
[1:27:19] nothing back to me now that sounds
[1:27:23] ridiculous don't it but that's exactly
[1:27:24] what Jesus said amen and hope that he
[1:27:27] doesn't give it back and your reward
[1:27:30] shall be great and ye shall be the
[1:27:32] children of the highest where he is kind
[1:27:36] unto the unthankful
[1:27:39] and to the evil that was me I'll help
[1:27:44] you out - that was you as well
[1:27:46] we were the Sun thankful in this evil
[1:27:49] sure we was God gave you life how long
[1:27:52] did it take you - for it really thank
[1:27:54] him for it
[1:27:55] he lived every X amount of years on this
[1:27:58] earth until you really really when you
[1:28:00] got saved till you really recognized you
[1:28:03] needed to be saved
[1:28:04] ah are they tears did you wake up every
[1:28:08] single morning from the time
[1:28:10] you's a little bitty baby if your baby
[1:28:11] hands in the earth thank you Lord for
[1:28:12] life you couldn't you didn't we were the
[1:28:17] unthankful God gave to us and gave to us
[1:28:19] and gave to us and we were this group
[1:28:21] right here but he was kind to me he gave
[1:28:27] to me not even looking to see if I'd
[1:28:30] ever return it back hey man don't you
[1:28:35] think about something how many people in
[1:28:37] this world will wake up and go to bed
[1:28:40] today and God will bestow on them one
[1:28:44] best after another and never come and
[1:28:47] ask them to get anything out of it he
[1:28:52] offers them eternal life they can take
[1:28:54] it or leave it
[1:28:57] he doesn't say I'll give you the breath
[1:28:59] of life
[1:28:59] how many pet babies will be born just
[1:29:02] today just today how many thousands of
[1:29:06] babies will God grant eternal life and
[1:29:08] you'll never see him come down in that
[1:29:10] operating room or in the hospital room
[1:29:11] or at home wherever they do it the
[1:29:12] Midwife or ever had goat and never stand
[1:29:14] there and say I give you that baby now
[1:29:16] thank me for it praise the Lord
[1:29:21] he gives and never asked for nothing
[1:29:24] returned this is the reason why when I
[1:29:27] come to church I like to give and give
[1:29:30] and give and give and give and give and
[1:29:33] give as much as I can give to Jesus
[1:29:35] because he's never asked me he's never
[1:29:37] demanded could you imagine me sitting -
[1:29:38] Samantha Kay back there you back tell
[1:29:40] her you love me today if she had to tell
[1:29:43] me there's something wrong if I had to
[1:29:46] ask her there's something wrong
[1:29:48] that's right that's right same way with
[1:29:51] the Lord Jesus same exact way then he
[1:29:56] says verse 37 judge not you shall not be
[1:29:58] judged condemned not you shouldn't be
[1:29:59] condemned forgive you shall be forgiven
[1:30:01] give it shall be given to you good
[1:30:03] measure pressed down shaken together
[1:30:05] running over shall men give into your
[1:30:07] bosom so I was quoting a moment ago for
[1:30:09] with the same measure that you meet with
[1:30:12] all shall be measured to you again a man
[1:30:17] that works in the positive but you know
[1:30:19] that works in the negative too whenever
[1:30:23] we pull out on a measuring stick of
[1:30:24] whether we think a person's a Christian
[1:30:26] be careful because the measuring stick
[1:30:29] you use against he that same measuring
[1:30:31] stick will be used against thee a man
[1:30:36] you cannot condemn and say hotsauce
[1:30:39] aren't living right keep the focus on
[1:30:42] here on yourself don't look its own so
[1:30:45] look at yourself right look at Romans
[1:30:49] chapter 12 verse four four and five
[1:30:51] Romans chapter twelve verse four and
[1:30:53] five ain't got much longer to go we
[1:30:55] almost to be in that Alright Romans
[1:30:58] twelve four and five for as we have many
[1:31:01] members in but one body all our members
[1:31:07] have not the same office so we're the
[1:31:14] same but we're different we're one but
[1:31:19] God vested in us different qualities not
[1:31:25] everybody can do what I'm doing not
[1:31:28] everybody can do what you do not
[1:31:31] everybody can play piano like brother
[1:31:32] lures not everybody can run technical
[1:31:36] things like light brother back there
[1:31:38] not everybody can deal in real estate I
[1:31:41] just tried to use real-world things
[1:31:44] brother I ain't begging but I guess I am
[1:31:46] picking I've been faking or anybody all
[1:31:47] man yes not everybody can sing not
[1:31:51] everybody can do certain things but God
[1:31:53] give you something you can do God give
[1:31:58] everybody the ability to do something
[1:32:02] I said I got nothing to do wait a minute
[1:32:04] wait a minute if you're a part of a body
[1:32:07] every part of my body has a function
[1:32:13] even the skin on the bottom of my feet
[1:32:17] serves a purpose I got to laughing today
[1:32:20] to myself one of John's little girls I
[1:32:23] forget which one it was I looked over on
[1:32:26] his old hard concrete I turned she's
[1:32:27] walking barefooted and I want to holler
[1:32:31] say hey what part of Tennessee are you
[1:32:33] from that's why we could never have a
[1:32:36] doctor about open-toed shoes in
[1:32:38] Tennessee because all of our sisters
[1:32:40] take their shoes off all the time
[1:32:41] barefooted all the time some of them old
[1:32:46] country girls I've seen and walk on
[1:32:48] rocks and I'm our proxy and Here I am
[1:32:51] old Tenderfoot who they have calluses on
[1:32:56] the bottom of their feet tough man but
[1:33:00] the bottom of their feet serve a purpose
[1:33:02] even the skin on the bottom of their
[1:33:04] foot served a purpose
[1:33:06] everything has a ministry everything has
[1:33:09] a mission you can look at parts of your
[1:33:12] body
[1:33:12] somebody said so many years ago in
[1:33:15] science and the medical world said you
[1:33:17] don't need your gallbladder lose it one
[1:33:19] time see if you don't need it
[1:33:20] I had mine take it out back in 2000 and
[1:33:24] I could eat certain foods and my stomach
[1:33:27] stays tore up a whole time why because
[1:33:29] that little that little function of that
[1:33:31] gallbladder
[1:33:31] was it reserved some of the goal in my
[1:33:34] stomach and if I was to eat fatty foods
[1:33:36] medically speaking then that gallbladder
[1:33:39] it adds a little bit of gall in with
[1:33:42] those fatty foods to help for digestion
[1:33:44] they know I can live without it but god
[1:33:47] I sure wish they wouldn't have took it
[1:33:48] out believe me when I started hurting
[1:33:52] with him gall stones and I was glad they
[1:33:54] did but after I was gone I missed it I
[1:33:56] still miss it that's been nearly 20
[1:33:59] years and I still miss my gallbladder
[1:34:02] it's got a function every purpose every
[1:34:07] part of the body has a function it
[1:34:09] serves some purpose so the devil likes
[1:34:12] to come on say you're not nothing to
[1:34:14] nobody don't you ever believe that
[1:34:16] lie of the devil Satan is a liar the
[1:34:19] word tells us different everybody has a
[1:34:22] purpose I said one reason God allowed
[1:34:26] babies to be born
[1:34:28] just so everybody to have somebody to
[1:34:29] teehee at church with her in church
[1:34:36] everybody's got a purpose but Van talked
[1:34:40] about a mother he called her the fifth
[1:34:42] gospel he said there's Matthew Mark Luke
[1:34:44] John and then mother said she's the
[1:34:46] fifth one said she gets him before the
[1:34:48] rest of them get him
[1:34:49] why because where did they learn the
[1:34:52] Bible they learned it home from that
[1:34:54] mother from that godly woman that's
[1:34:56] sitting there taking the Bible like my
[1:34:58] little Annalise back there when she was
[1:35:00] just a baby maybe oh I don't know maybe
[1:35:03] even two or three years old and she's
[1:35:05] just not like Jessica there she's just
[1:35:07] getting started and III used to laugh at
[1:35:11] her she'd get her Bible out and mama
[1:35:13] always read her Bible certain ways and
[1:35:15] certainly I'd see LaVon he's sitting
[1:35:17] over in a corner with a book open she'd
[1:35:19] have see spot run in her hands but she
[1:35:21] was reading that was her Bible she was
[1:35:22] reading her Bible for the day where do
[1:35:24] they learn these things there's a
[1:35:26] function there's a purpose in the body
[1:35:28] and that body works together in unison
[1:35:32] in harmony once you're in a first
[1:35:37] Corinthians chapter 10 now verse 17
[1:35:39] first Corinthians 10 verse 17 for we
[1:35:43] being many are one bread one bread now
[1:35:48] you take this type you can run this back
[1:35:49] to the old testament to the bread of his
[1:35:52] presence show bread it was the showbread
[1:35:55] seed that the light of god shown on that
[1:35:58] show bread seed the priest would eat
[1:36:00] that bread amen and Paul says we are one
[1:36:04] body we are one bread now last I checked
[1:36:14] every part of a food piece carrot stem
[1:36:20] little white part
[1:36:21] on the inside of a green pepper bitter
[1:36:24] you cut them things out suam what I was
[1:36:26] thinking of today says you want that's
[1:36:28] what makes your mouth numb every part of
[1:36:32] it a good chef you like to cook you like
[1:36:36] to cook a little bit burn water you can
[1:36:39] you you I'm talking to you you like to
[1:36:42] cook a little bit not really let me tell
[1:36:47] you I don't I hated it too I turned 40
[1:36:51] and for whatever reason I fell in love
[1:36:53] with cooking as you can see I like to
[1:36:55] eat you like to cook says you you like
[1:36:58] to cook I got to read these books about
[1:37:02] chefs to me whenever I would chop up
[1:37:07] something I put it in a bag or put it in
[1:37:09] a pot or what I do I think y'all them
[1:37:12] scraps laying on the table now here I'm
[1:37:15] gonna give you a cooking lesson okay you
[1:37:16] ready all them scraps on the table most
[1:37:19] of people they just throw them away but
[1:37:20] a good chef tell you don't do that hold
[1:37:23] on to your scraps you know what I found
[1:37:25] out all of them green peppers scraps and
[1:37:29] all of them broccoli stems and all that
[1:37:30] stuff it makes a pretty good stock if
[1:37:33] you may save it and make it a little bit
[1:37:35] later put it in a pot put some water in
[1:37:37] it just cook it for a little while
[1:37:39] you don't even have to touch it you just
[1:37:40] let it cook I thought hallelujah this is
[1:37:44] my kind of cooking but every part serves
[1:37:48] a purpose in the kitchen defeating
[1:37:51] Saints he called us one bread all of us
[1:37:56] have a purpose you may think you're
[1:37:58] scrap but even your scrap serve a
[1:38:00] purpose in the body of Christ your
[1:38:03] flavoring somebody's life just you just
[1:38:05] have it just takes somebody gifted to
[1:38:07] know how to where to put him and how to
[1:38:08] handle it in order to get the flavor out
[1:38:11] of their life
[1:38:12] I didn't mean embarrass you I was just
[1:38:13] asking him I just wondered amen
[1:38:18] all of us have a purpose in God one body
[1:38:22] we're all partners of that one bread
[1:38:25] hallelujah I'd like to do an example but
[1:38:28] I didn't bring my loaf I'm gonna do this
[1:38:31] one these days Sam don't let me forget
[1:38:33] to bring a loaf of bread I want a nice
[1:38:34] big thick of
[1:38:35] Italian bread one of these days so I'm
[1:38:37] gonna preach this again somewhere else I
[1:38:38] want to use this bread for an example
[1:38:40] but you just picture it in your brain
[1:38:42] okay one loaf you can pull the piece of
[1:38:46] that bread off and set it aside another
[1:38:48] piece set it to the side you can just
[1:38:50] keep holding that bread apart until you
[1:38:52] have thousands of little pieces of bread
[1:38:54] on that table but the end of the day
[1:38:57] it's one loaf of bread think of it like
[1:39:02] slicing bread you know many many slices
[1:39:04] in that loaf of bread but it's one loaf
[1:39:07] of bread it may be a black it may be a
[1:39:11] light it may be Vietnamese it may be
[1:39:15] Japanese it could be Indian but it's one
[1:39:20] lump one loaf we're all together you may
[1:39:24] speak French I may speak German you may
[1:39:28] speak English you may speak Dutch but if
[1:39:31] we're all one in Christ Jesus
[1:39:32] Alleluia it's one loaf of bread just
[1:39:35] like Paul said right here we're all
[1:39:37] partakers of that one bread didn't Jesus
[1:39:40] say
[1:39:41] they came from God out of heaven down
[1:39:44] and fed the children of Israel he said
[1:39:47] eat my body drink my blood and he said
[1:39:52] you'll have life with me every part even
[1:39:55] the scraps serve a purpose somehow
[1:39:57] another oh god I wish I hadn't run that
[1:40:00] mile now first Corinthians chapter 12
[1:40:05] verse further we're going to quit all
[1:40:07] right the body is one and hath many
[1:40:11] members and all the members of that one
[1:40:13] body being many are one body so also is
[1:40:17] Christ amen for by one spirit glory we
[1:40:22] are all baptized into one body amen
[1:40:27] whether we be Jew or Gentile whether it
[1:40:31] be bond or free we've all been made to
[1:40:34] drink into one spirit oh brother that's
[1:40:40] shouting ground right there cuz I'm
[1:40:43] gonna tell you something you don't
[1:40:45] matter how different you and I are if
[1:40:46] we've been drinking of this same waters
[1:40:49] life if we've been made to partake at
[1:40:52] the same holy spirits you're my brother
[1:40:54] and I'm your sister and vice versa and
[1:40:56] back and forth all the way around the
[1:40:58] body of Christ we're one for one
[1:41:02] look at verse 20 same same chapter for
[1:41:06] screen 12 verse 20 but now are they many
[1:41:09] members yet but one body Colossians
[1:41:14] chapter 3 verse 15 he said let the peace
[1:41:17] of God rule in your hearts to the to the
[1:41:19] which also ye are called in to one body
[1:41:23] and be ye thankful amen I'm thankful
[1:41:27] that's what body
[1:41:28] I'm thankful in the church age but then
[1:41:31] talks about how that man tried to take
[1:41:34] control he tried to take control of the
[1:41:38] entire church absolutely wanted control
[1:41:41] of God control of the money control of
[1:41:45] the people control of the singing
[1:41:47] control of everything listen where the
[1:41:50] prophet of God says church Facebook he
[1:41:52] said the false man was getting a hold
[1:41:54] and teaching rulership by man was right
[1:41:56] it taught that the church had to be
[1:41:58] governed it top control over the people
[1:42:02] instead of doing it's God's way they
[1:42:04] simply took authority invested all the
[1:42:07] spiritual power into their own hands and
[1:42:09] came out with a holy priesthood standing
[1:42:11] between God and the people they went
[1:42:14] back to the old Arabic system they
[1:42:16] became the Anti Christ they became the
[1:42:18] Antichrist the pot disposed that
[1:42:21] disposed of his own meteor ship and
[1:42:23] imposed their own God hated that amen
[1:42:26] the Ephesians hated that and any true
[1:42:29] believer will hated - amen he said we
[1:42:32] will have to be we'd have to be stone
[1:42:34] blind not to see the same at the word
[1:42:36] the same at war thing it worked through
[1:42:37] all these ages and now it is the worst
[1:42:39] of all he said that separated people
[1:42:41] God's people are supposed to be one by
[1:42:45] one spirit they are all ALL baptized all
[1:42:48] baptized into one body and everyone is
[1:42:51] to be moved on by the Holy Spirit and
[1:42:54] everyone everyone participate in the
[1:42:58] worship of God the Lord reveals
[1:43:01] something to me in Monticello Kentucky
[1:43:03] other day no no I was I was down there
[1:43:07] preaching and I was talking about
[1:43:08] denominational systems and the Holy
[1:43:13] Ghost give this to me just as sure as
[1:43:15] I'm standing here and I was talking to
[1:43:17] the people and I said now I realize why
[1:43:20] I say come on somebody it's because God
[1:43:23] didn't want me to be the only one
[1:43:24] worshipping this is a body move it

[1:43:38] is holler cut on somebody but God did
[1:43:41] not expect you to come to this church to
[1:43:43] be spectators expects you to be
[1:43:46] participators he wants us to worship
[1:43:50] together amen because why we're one body
[1:43:55] one body but if Adam said God doesn't
[1:43:58] dwell on his sears and roebuck harmony
[1:44:00] house God's God of variety he makes red
[1:44:03] flowers blue flowers pink flowers all
[1:44:05] different kinds why didn't you just make
[1:44:06] him all light or in why didn't make big
[1:44:09] mountains and little mountains and palm
[1:44:11] trees why did you at all because he
[1:44:13] likes variety he said you know what I
[1:44:16] mean he likes variety
[1:44:17] why to make the mountains the plain the
[1:44:18] real dry desert in the wet sea
[1:44:20] he's a god of variety but he wants it
[1:44:22] all this at this statement to harmonize
[1:44:24] together that's why he made me as an ear
[1:44:28] nose a mouth he said this is you the
[1:44:32] same way it all harmonizes for one body
[1:44:35] he said that's the way we do harmonize
[1:44:37] in our different opinions we can still
[1:44:40] harmonize because we are God's people
[1:44:44] marching together for one great purpose
[1:44:49] Alleluia and he said my sincere desire
[1:44:52] is to see God's great bouquet of God's
[1:44:56] gathering together he said in gathering
[1:44:59] together this bouquet called it until he
[1:45:02] comes to take us home well BAM said
[1:45:05] Marvin sheer desire is that I just love
[1:45:10] this
[1:45:11] he wants us to harmonize the same way my
[1:45:16] nose does the same way my ears too
[1:45:18] the same way my eyes harmonize you
[1:45:22] realize one reason that I can see you
[1:45:24] and hear you the harmony between my eyes
[1:45:27] and my ears
[1:45:29] there was no harmony let's say my eyes
[1:45:31] and ears had a church split and the one
[1:45:36] wasn't talking to the other they might
[1:45:39] be able to hear but they can't see might
[1:45:42] be able to see but they can't hear it
[1:45:46] has to be a harmony all of the body
[1:45:49] brother Jesse has to harmonize together
[1:45:51] I know some churches I heard recently
[1:45:57] one church said something the fact I've
[1:46:00] said so well we we've done everything we
[1:46:03] need to do in this last day we don't
[1:46:05] even need young people no more I said
[1:46:07] God have mercy what if what if the
[1:46:10] comment of the Lord went on another
[1:46:11] forty years it wouldn't just be the
[1:46:14] elders and the hoary head of wisdom
[1:46:16] sitting there they'd be in a box
[1:46:18] somewhere another buried six foot under
[1:46:19] the ground
[1:46:20] you'd need another generation you need
[1:46:25] girls like our sister here and our
[1:46:26] brother back there and these young kids
[1:46:29] here Wendy
[1:46:30] different ones or young brother there
[1:46:32] you need young men that know how to
[1:46:35] harmonize with things could you imagine
[1:46:37] what it would have been if Elijah would
[1:46:39] I had that attitude when the chariot
[1:46:42] come down for him I said well don't need
[1:46:45] a Malaysia little bald head get rid of
[1:46:49] him but it was the harmony between
[1:46:53] Elijah and Elijah that kept the
[1:46:56] succession of that anointing of the
[1:46:59] logic going on until we come down right
[1:47:01] here to this very last day when God
[1:47:03] sitting to John the Baptist he said that
[1:47:05] same Elijah anointing a William Branham
[1:47:06] he'll send that same Elijah anointing
[1:47:08] over to the Jews after the bride is
[1:47:10] taken out of here it's harmony of the
[1:47:14] entire body of Christ we are horn I
[1:47:20] don't care what anybody tells you the
[1:47:24] love of God
[1:47:25] we'll make you one listen I'm winding
[1:47:28] down Brenda Bevin said the love of God
[1:47:34] will make a tuxedo wrap his arm around
[1:47:37] and overhaul and call him a brother
[1:47:39] [Laughter]
[1:47:41] glory to God he said he was standing
[1:47:46] there that little finished boy was
[1:47:47] raised from the dead he said them grown
[1:47:50] men stand there crying like babies he
[1:47:52] said anything that make a fin put his
[1:47:56] arm around a Russian he said that bang
[1:47:59] was settled every war he said it would
[1:48:02] bring peace to every place because Jesus
[1:48:05] Christ is the answer he said they stood
[1:48:08] there and wept and cried together they
[1:48:11] hollered shyamalan wah
[1:48:14] that's God's peace rest upon you them
[1:48:16] Russians and Finns put their arms around
[1:48:18] another he said that's right he said
[1:48:22] it'll make a silk dress and a calico set
[1:48:24] together and say God bless you you're my
[1:48:27] sister the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:48:30] cleanses us from all sin straightens all
[1:48:33] wrongs takes all prejudice out let me
[1:48:37] hit something real quick before we go
[1:48:38] home prejudice in color
[1:48:45] people can have prejudices that have
[1:48:47] nothing to do with skin color or race or
[1:48:50] culture or anything they like sometimes
[1:48:53] people can get prejudice because
[1:48:55] somebody does something more in the
[1:48:57] church and the other person it's the
[1:49:00] same time for prejudice some people can
[1:49:03] get wise he get to do a why does she
[1:49:05] that's a prejudice spirit but if you're
[1:49:09] a part of the body of Christ surely you
[1:49:11] don't look at your heart and say why is
[1:49:13] he always the one pumping the blood
[1:49:15] cuz that's his job a man the problem is
[1:49:21] my friends as Christians many folks just
[1:49:25] simply don't find their place in the
[1:49:27] body they're always wanting to take
[1:49:30] somebody else's place that's why we've
[1:49:34] got to find our position it takes all
[1:49:37] the prejudice out
[1:49:38] heals the sick and makes us new
[1:49:40] creatures oh if that don't make you
[1:49:44] holler a man I don't know what will
[1:49:45] hey man brother Brandon said lookee here
[1:49:50] came down to the meanest city in the
[1:49:52] earth he said well that means many
[1:49:54] Annapolis has got a chance then don't
[1:49:56] they say come to Nazareth a little
[1:49:59] virgin who was living right before God
[1:50:01] the poor not the rich and hearty a
[1:50:03] haughty rather God don't look at your
[1:50:05] money or the way your dress he looks at
[1:50:07] your heart
[1:50:09] he said that's what's the matter with
[1:50:11] the church today closing here they got
[1:50:14] too starchy too much pride he said what
[1:50:19] are you anyways but six foot of dirt and
[1:50:24] how can one lump and look at another
[1:50:27] dirt and say you're better than I
[1:50:31] they're both lumps of dirt hey man this
[1:50:38] is why Paul said these words be ye kind
[1:50:42] one to another because he's looking at
[1:50:47] everything everything that's going on
[1:50:50] the body of Christ these people he's
[1:50:52] preaching to probably had a lot of gifts
[1:50:53] themself but I love this years ago
[1:50:59] whenever a king would set a banquet
[1:51:03] history records to us that often what
[1:51:07] that King would do we know this from the
[1:51:10] message to brother men talked about this
[1:51:12] a little bit
[1:51:12] how'd it when they would come into the
[1:51:14] back door we'd say or into the end of
[1:51:17] the place where the bank was going to be
[1:51:18] held every person had to take their
[1:51:20] clothes off and put a robe on that way
[1:51:23] if the guy walked in he had a
[1:51:24] three-piece suit on or nothing walked in
[1:51:27] and he had just rags on when they
[1:51:29] undressed and put that garment on him
[1:51:32] they all looked the same they had the
[1:51:35] same type of clothing the same quality
[1:51:37] of clothing but in old history another
[1:51:39] thing that these Kings would often do is
[1:51:41] they would adjust the height of the
[1:51:43] seats and they would take the short guy
[1:51:46] and set him in the tall chair another
[1:51:50] one put him in the middle sized chair
[1:51:52] and take the tall guy and sit him in the
[1:51:54] little chair and they said that way when
[1:51:56] the King walked out and looked across
[1:51:58] that great audience every man and woman
[1:52:01] was equal in the look of him as they
[1:52:05] went down through the table remember
[1:52:07] what Jesus said he said woe be unto them
[1:52:11] if they say manners of evil it'd be
[1:52:13] better for them if they had a millstone
[1:52:15] you ever seen a millstone you know the
[1:52:17] millstone is it's a big grinding stone
[1:52:19] mmm where they grind and grind and grind
[1:52:22] heavy super heavy hurt you heavy kill
[1:52:26] you heavy and Jesus said I had be better
[1:52:29] to have one of them hung about your neck
[1:52:30] and drowned in the sea then to offend
[1:52:32] one of these my little ones
[1:52:34] why was he saying such things Church
[1:52:37] listen to me he was saying that because
[1:52:39] the little ones he was referring to was
[1:52:41] him and he was those little ones
[1:52:46] remember the prophet of God said arise
[1:52:48] in the Sun he talked about Adam and Eve
[1:52:50] and how they were one body he said sighs
[1:52:53] Christ and the bride glory he said not
[1:52:56] only is she power of his power life of
[1:52:58] his life dynamic of his dynamic but he
[1:53:01] said she is him
[1:53:05] she is him because were one be kind one
[1:53:15] to another put away lying let him at
[1:53:20] steal steal no more speak every man
[1:53:22] truth with his own neighbor put away
[1:53:25] clamor and evil speaking don't blaspheme
[1:53:28] one another's name why why Paul why
[1:53:31] would you exhort us this way because as
[1:53:34] there's one body
[1:53:35] there's many members of this one body
[1:53:38] stand with me hour and 25 minutes you
[1:53:44] all survived amen amen I got I got my
[1:53:47] watch going I'm keeping track I know you
[1:53:51] got a I know you got a long way to go
[1:53:53] amen let's just have a word of Prayer
[1:53:57] before we close
[1:54:00] I just thank God for His mercy don't you
[1:54:04] Amen let's let's just pray look thank
[1:54:08] you for this lovely day Lord father
[1:54:12] thank you for making it tolerable in
[1:54:13] this room it's not super hot outside and
[1:54:16] I can only believe Lord you let it be
[1:54:18] that way so we can enjoy the weekend
[1:54:22] thank you for the many blessings I heard
[1:54:26] him singing the song just this song
[1:54:30] service gone by count your blessings
[1:54:33] Oh God Lord how many hundreds and
[1:54:38] hundreds and hundreds of blessings could
[1:54:41] we just save things you've done in our
[1:54:44] lives I'm so grateful and Lord with all
[1:54:51] these great blessings that you've placed
[1:54:53] in our lives with all these great things
[1:54:56] you've done for us when you take one man
[1:54:59] that's got blessings and accumulate that
[1:55:02] with another man and then another sister
[1:55:04] and then another brother then another
[1:55:06] sister the brother then on and on
[1:55:08] Lord Jesus when you look at the
[1:55:11] accumulative blessings the aggregate of
[1:55:15] blessings it lets us know that you are
[1:55:19] unlimited in your blessings just as your
[1:55:22] unlimited healing we think of it Lord
[1:55:25] how many thousands of people have been
[1:55:27] healed and yet Lord many of them aren't
[1:55:31] even saved but they cut their finger on
[1:55:34] a kitchen knife the prophet of God said
[1:55:37] a doctor can stitch it but it takes God
[1:55:38] to heal it and yet all that virtue and
[1:55:42] healing power goes out from you
[1:55:45] and not many really receive it as being
[1:55:47] a blessing and yet there's as we would
[1:55:51] say down home buckets of it bucket loads
[1:55:54] of blessings still in reserves Lord
[1:55:57] because you can't run out you are the
[1:56:00] supernatural and you do supernatural
[1:56:02] things that's what your prophet taught
[1:56:04] us so Lord we look at all of the great
[1:56:08] things you've done for us what a
[1:56:10] blessing it is for one man but lower
