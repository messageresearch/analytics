give you thanks for everything that goes on today to magnify the name of Jesus in Christ's name we ask it and the Saints said amen praise God let's take our Bibles here to Matthew chapter 24. like to kind of continue last week's thought but just kind of look more General at the order of events here towards we're looking going to the Rapture and of course all the events that come after that by God's grace so Matthew 24 verse 3. I'd just like to title this when shall these things be because that's what the disciples asked Jesus over 2000 years ago when shall these things be and so we'll look at Jesus's answer here Matthew 24 verse 3. here's the question of course in the rest of the chapter gives Jesus his answer praise God Matthew 24 verse 3. let's read this together if we can here by God's grace ready on three one two three and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be this sign of thy coming and of the end of the world may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated God bless you you can switch over our episodes some slides I'd like to show here by God's grace if you just keep your Bible there in Matthew 24 we'll try to start there by the grace of God I just kind of want to give you a little look at what Jesus said here to his disciples when when they asked him and I love this text because you know Jesus disciples were the ones who left everything to follow him and that's what we've done you know most recently we've seen it with Austin Lena leave everything to follow we saw brother amen leave everything to follow the lord Jesus Christ we saw sister Sia leave everything to follow the lord Jesus Christ so once a person leaves and forsakes their family they have no other family other than the spiritual family of God Amen and so when these disciples leave they're here at this is right at the end of Jesus ministry just weeks before his crucifixion if I'm not mistaken and they get to him privately they say Lord when are these things going to happen and so then Jesus gives this entire chapter as a uh as an answer to three questions so also we'll kind of look look at this like the a subtopic of order of the end time events before the Rapture and look at some of the events after the course the main thing is to be ready for the Rapture praise God that's that's the main thing anything that we talk about after the Rapture doesn't really mean anything as far as to us really it doesn't really matter if we're right or wrong we do want to be right of course uh if we have the spirit of Christ we have the spirit of Truth we want to believe the truth we don't want to believe a lie or anything false of course no one's no one's equal with God here none of us have the same you know none of us are Eternal none of us have infinite knowledge so we're all growing in the same time the Bible actually says to pray to grow in Revelation to grow in the knowledge of God and that was of course that's my prayer I'm sure that's your prayer as well by the grace of God but there's just some things that from last last Sunday's sermon I kind of couldn't get away from so I I thought I would just come back this and we'll look at a little bit more on Russia here today by God's grace and but have your Bibles there handy in Matthew 24 our text was 24 3 and Jesus gives us three questions I'm sorry disciples asked three questions in here and so we want to look at each one of those and uh and then I'd just like to briefly read this chapter I'm a pretty fast talker I'm a pretty fast reader I think so I can go through these kind of quickly and I just kind of want to give you an idea how you know Jesus has asked three questions but he gives the answer and whoever recorded this answer Matthew either either Jesus gave the answer totally out of order or Matthew recorded it totally out of order and the purpose behind that would be to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it unto babes such as would learn that would be God's motive behind that as you'll see if you ever if you ever have read Matthew 24 you're kind of scratching your head well which one does this apply to which what what is that all about and so uh we understand God is hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent it's just like Jesus's first coming praise God you know the first prophecy was Genesis 3 15. uh the Lord said uh that that the serpent would bruise the heel of the Messiah right the woman's seed but then the woman seed would bruise his head praise God well that was four thousand years of waiting But as time went on God gave more details it'll come out of the seat of Abraham and then a thousand years after that it come out of the seat of David praise God and then then pretty soon he'd be born in Bethlehem praise God and then Isaiah 800 years would say uh he'd be a branch that would write raise out of David and he'd be wounded for our transgressions and and David said he'd cry my God my God why is Thou forsaken me praise God so we see that God gives Revelation uh prophecy and then he gives more information about the same Revelation and that's what's happening today by God's grace we're learning more about these end time events and and trying to understand more about the coming of the Lord praise God and so you know we see the three questions they came privately said when shall these things be what should be the sign of thy coming now the first question was about when will the temple be destroyed because they'd ask him in verses when it or Jesus had said in verses one and two that not one stone will be left upon another okay so when will these things be the temple be torn down that was herod's Temple and number two what should be the sign of thy coming the Rapture and what will be the end of the world Armageddon right Armageddon uh would be the end of the world of man's day and of course the Millennium would be the Lord's Day praise God and so uh we see now verses 7 and 8 Speak directly of the events of two thousand years so imagine Jesus squeezed 2 000 years in two verses right two thousand years and two verses so we're going to read this here and think about this church how many wars have there been in 2000 years many many wars how many pestilences have there been in 2000 years how many earthquakes have there been in 2000 years so again Jesus you know he gives us uh these these these prophecies but they're very broad right they're very Broad and so I would take a spiritual mind uh to understand well we're going to have to look at more more than just this chapter right we're going to look at Revelation chapters two and three amen with the seven churches the Gentile churches the Gentile cities at that we have to look at more prophecy Daniel chapter 9 10 11 and 12. uh then the entire Book of Revelation that God gave to John on Patmos you know we have to look at all these combined together and no doubt many many more and then the Holy Spirit as we're seeking God as we see God's face he reveals more of himself praise God Hallelujah as you draw night to God God will draw closer to you praise God Hallelujah that means as Jesus is coming we're going to be Drawing Near as he's coming in the Rapture I'll say I'll use this this visual from up above we'll be drawing closer to him praise God we'll be drawing more and more closer to him when we draw not to him he draws nigh to us so as time goes on here church we get a better understanding now think just from the times of brother Branham brother random thought the end of the world would come in 76. and here we are all these years later see so we have see we have greater revelation we have a great we have more information about the same Revelation praise God now we can see oh there's going to be more birth pains there's going to be more more pestilences more Wars we're going to see all this come up and then we have the pressure of the mark of the beast and the One World Government so we're getting a much better understanding as time goes on our vision gets more clear praise God it doesn't get more blurry in fact it gets more clear all the time praise God as long as you're looking through the lenses of the Holy Spirit praise God put on your put on your uh your spiritual lenses make sure your eyes have the eyes out of the Holy Spirit the anointing to take away any sickness in our sight right any blurriness of our vision may God give us the vision of the word of God hallelujah that we can see exactly what's going on here praise God now I want to read verse 4. I'm going to read fast because I'm just a fast talker my I've had teachers tell me that my students tell me that I just pre talk really fast so forgive me verse 4 and Jesus answered and said to them take heed that no man deceive you this is actually speaking of the church ages as well I'm sorry Verses 4 to um four to eight are the two thousand year Church ages verse 5 for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many every year there's another preacher from somewhere he calls it he says I'm literally Jesus there was one and I forget which Eastern nation it was there was uh one in Canada there's one in South America a few years ago they just they literally say they're Jesus of course they're Liars verse six and ye shall hear of Wars here we are Wars rumors of War say Russia Ukraine right recently see that you be not troubled for all these things must yet come to pass but the end is not yet now think of all the wars the papal Wars right of the Dark Ages think of all the wars then think of all the American wars from the 17th 18th century on all the American roads the revolution Spanish-American War all these wars right that's just the end of these last two thousand years what about the beginning of these 2000 years the Roman wars look at all these see now uh verse 7 for nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there should be famines pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places and all these are the beginning of Sorrows of course the end of Sorrows will be the seven trumpets and the Seven vials and then the three woes those will be the end of Sorrow those will be the final pouring out of God's Wrath on a wicked generation that would not seek the Holy Ghost that is the end of Sorrows right and then a new a new day amen A New Earth is birthed out of that praise God the Millennium praise God that's the new birth amen it's birthing the Earth has to go through these pains to bring forth A New Earth praise God a new Heaven and new earth the Bible says praise God Amen that's right now once we get to verse 9 now we have some new prophecy to those three questions then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you should be hated of all Nations for my name's sake now that's that looks like uh uh the answer to uh the end of the world remember how Russia and the kings of the East are going to come against Israel we read that last week I know it's a lot to remember there's a lot happening this week for everybody's life right Ezekiel 38 and 39. they're going to come up and try to uh try to kill them now verse 10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall bow in the love of many shall wax quote now actually verse 11 we actually apply in verse 11 and 12 we actually apply that to the church ages brother Brandon does verse 13 but he that endure unto the end the same shall be saved verse 14. now here we get now this goes back here to uh the the 2000 Church ages and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the king I'm sorry in all the world for a witness unto all nations then shall the End come now that should remind us of Revelation chapter 10 where John said eat the book and you go prophesy again to Every Nation Kindred people tongue and try praise God see how there's just there's different prophecies there's different there's three different prophecies in here and you have to line them up the right way all right now I guess in verse 9 you could even apply that to the wise and foolish version when the squeeze comes down I guess you could apply that so again I I'm I'm not saying I have the perfect understanding of this chapter I'm just gonna let you know as you'll see there's different there's three prophecies that are being fulfilled and it seems the answers are all spread out in here now verse 15. now look at 15 here we go to the Jews when ye therefore see the abomination of desolation spoken of in Daniel the pro I'm sorry of by the Daniel the Prophet was Daniel in the chapter nine stand the holy place whoso readeth let him understand now Daniel 12 actually says this takes place 30 days after the Covenant is broken between Israel and Rome so look Jesus goes he's talking about the Rapture or the Gentile and then he goes right to three and a half years after that right the end of the world verse 16 then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is in on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and wound to them that are with child to them that give suck in those days but pray that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day now that's interesting I've always applied this to when the temple was destroyed because Broadway says it doesn't matter when the Rapture takes place if it's summer winter that doesn't matter it's not about physically Rapture it's a spiritual Rapture praise God right it's a meeting in the air god changes your body so see again here is prophecy about the temple being destroyed most likely and look he's just hidden right in there whether Matthew's choice or Jesus choice but ultimately Jesus's Choice whether Jesus spoke it like that on purpose or if Matthew just recorded it in a in an order that's not the correct order to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent now look at verse 21 now this is interesting for then shall be great tribulations such as not yet since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be so I don't know if this is referring to when Titus came if that was the greatest tribulation I would think the greater tribulation would be at the end of Daniel 70 weeks at the end of the Great Tribulation period that's what I would think when you have the vows again the trumpets and the woes that's what I would think now look at verse 22 and except those days should be short and there should be no flesh saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened again not sure which verse that one applies to I've always applied that to the church ages God has to shorten the day so that somebody save because then the awful tribute the awful Wrath of the tribulation comes but again I could be wrong on that verse 23 that if any man shall say unto you Lo here's Christ or there believe it not for there shall rise false Christ now we always apply this to today right for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and of course we know the elect cannot be deceived you cannot be deceived praise God Hallelujah there's little things that will fall short on you know those are little sins but we're not deceived on those we know we're doing wrong many times when we do those but he's talking about anyone that will say I'm Christ or here's Christ or there's Christ or there's the Messiah or there's the rapture we will not be deceived on that because we have the spirit of Truth praise God just so you know Joseph Branham my my friend I'm gonna call my friend he put that verse out yesterday and said we are the ones with the wrong spirit because we're putting preachers ahead of brother Branham he just said we are the ones deceiving the very elect and I wrote him back I said no sir this morning actually running back I said no sir you're the one deceiving the elect think about that he just called us the Antichrist spirit so I said no you are and it's either one or the other Church to either and it is his point was well you're making a five-fold greater than brother Branham and I said we're not making anybody greater we're making them equal that's how it's always been praise God no one's greater than others I said but God don't send dead men to preach God says living men praise God and show me where that's ever changed in the Bible I said just to make your fancy he keeps calling the prophet is the greatest gift I said just to suit your fancy brother I said brother random said the Apostle is greater than the prophet and I gain the quote I said you could look it up but I'll give it to you anyway since he claims to believe everything on the tapes see I just nah see you see how this see we're the church we're living in this time where it's becoming more and more deceptive praise God fewer few are going to be able to receive it now think about that you just got he's already called us make-believers unbelievers and he's called us demises and now he's calling us the Antichrist spirit and I just say right back that's you because I know where I stand praise God I cannot be deceived because the Holy Ghost lives in my soul praise God it just fires up my righteous thing to Nation so I know everybody just says you know I'll smile on with me and everything like that but I'm standing against it I'm not standing with that that's that's wrong I said I said please stop Whispering your dad and his tapes please stop doing that I just also you can do is bleed for him all you do is pray for them and plead for them said please repent brother please repent and you know what your team made over a million dollars in donations last year the IRS went and audited all these people you know he made more money than Benny Hinn last year guess who made the most money last year or this year with all the donations Joyce Meyer she beat out Joel Osteen I don't know if that's the first time that's ever happened but think about that the preacher America likes the most is a woman preacher because it's a woman's Nation right because they control by sex control and all these things like that Temptation and everything and of course America is like into a immoral woman right 13. so interesting just thought I'd share that with you by God's grace see there's a reason he's saying press play plus pray because he he's got all the tapes right he wants he wants to be the headquarters he wants you to send his ties to him now he says he don't but actions speak louder than words Hallelujah all right now see that's a that's a very relevant verse for today we just got called The False Spirit but I said no you're the false Spirit verse 25 behold I have told you before verse 26 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he's in the desert go not for it behold he's in the secret Chambers believe it not now look here 27 now for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even in the west so also shall the coming of the son of man begin that beautiful the Rapture is going to be like lightning praise God he's going to come down and anoint us get our bring our glorified bodies and take us up to meet at theophany amen like lightning Hallelujah think about that people may be around you and then they'll see you and you'll be gone in a moment like lightning because lightning you can see it for a moment but then it's banishes but you still see like the after effects on your eyes that's how the Rapture is going to be praise God verse 28 now look another uh Church age verse for wheresoever the carcass is the fresh meat there where the Eagles be gathered together where where the lightning is where the Rapture is verse 29 immediately after the tribulation of those days now he gets tribulation so here he goes into another one of those answers right because the church the church ages we don't go through tribulation right shall the sun be darkened oh that ought to remind you something The Sixth Seal yeah that's right the six seal and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken that's the second half of the tribulation that can't happen until the very end when the trumpets and the vows and the woes are poured out that's right and the Bible says for the finishing verse uh I'm sorry go to the verse 30. then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn see they're going to be trying to kill themselves but they want the God's going to give them over to some insane Spirit where they can't even kill themselves right the Bible says they're going to be tormented for five months with scorpions and all these different torments death is going to escape them see all the tribes are shall mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory that's the battle that we come back on the battle of Armageddon praise God we just come and Jesus is leading his bride Jesus just brings his bride comes out and he just pours out judgment and he pours out wrath and he just shows the Earth before he judges him he just shows the Earth this was my bride amen hallelujah this was my blood raw bride and you rejected her and you killed her down through the church ages and you martyred hundreds of millions of her but this was my bride and now judgments being poured out praise God Hallelujah he comes back one more time to show all the nations who his bride really is aren't you glad Church you're in the bride of Christ this ain't a light thing this is the greatest blessing my brother said the greatest thing in your life is that you're invited to the marriage supper of the lamb praise God by the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen Hallelujah verse 31 and he shall send his angels with the great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the foreign that's Israel from one end of Heaven to the other that's Israel the Bible says that later he has to draw them all from the ends of the there's Old Testament scripture that says that as well gather Israel from all the four corners of the Earth now look verse 32 now learn a parable of fig tree that's Israel when his branch is yet tender and put it Forward leaves he shall know that summer is not so likewise he when ye shall see all these things know that the know that it is near even at the door so when Israel becomes mature know that all these things are going to come to pass soon okay well that's not speaking of the uh that's not speaking of Titus that's speaking of uh the end of the world right when Israel's gathered together as a nation the fig tree verse 34 verily I send you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled now this is the scripture brother random use brother random use the scripture uh that's why he thought that uh the world would end in 1976 because he thought all these things have to happen when Israel becomes a nation how many how many remember when Israel became a nation what year was it 1948. so he said a generation would be 80 80 1988 and did you know there was a famous preacher that said 88 reasons Jesus is going to come back in 1988. I remember seeing the book on the shelves I was eight years old did he come back in 1988 no but brother man was using this scripture oh the fig trees how many times did he sing that the Fig Tree is growing Israel's restoring the signs of the prophets were told that's why he thought the coming would be before 77. and all these things are going to come to pass before this generation is fulfilled but now we can see it's been a generation since 48 right so now we can see that brother man was just doing his best programs uh uh brother's Ministry was to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers to finish the mystery of God to show the sign of the son of man praise God his ministry wasn't to actually tell us the day and hour of the Rapture or the year of the raps or anything like that he was just doing his best as a Bible student which Christian doesn't want to know the year the Lord's coming all of us want to know praise God we're all just doing it and he never said thus saith the Lord on 1976 but see he was doing his best to interpret the word of God that's what I'm trying to do today but now we're all these years we're 56 years after brother random and the Holy Spirit is still guiding us into more truth amen Hallelujah so see that's we've got to be very careful with that verse 34 is always stumble people I've had different people come to our church off and on saying brother what they've asked me specifically brother Jesse what about Matthew 24 34 brother man said all these things are coming to pass I said well that he never said thus saith the Lord we've got to let brother random have his opinions and that they never said nothing back they just said okay thank you see we can you just cannot make every word thus saith the Lord You're Going to tie yourself in knots you're going to create all these false doctrines like these people do verse 35 Heavener shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but out of that day and hour now look day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only that's the Rapture the day and hour of the rapture yes right Church everything is based upon that day because as soon as the bride goes up God comes down to Israel right and Satan comes down to the Antichrist they make that seven year Covenant and then we know is though those two prophets have three and a half years 1260 days like everything is based upon that unknown day and hour and then after that you know they die their prophets die they're raised and then there's only three and a half more years until Armageddon everything is based upon that unknown day and hour it's a secret snatching away it's going to come in a time when they don't win the world doesn't expect it it's going to time when the foolish virgin don't expect it but we'll expect it because the spirit of God will be with us amen the spirit of God has always prepared Believers Elijah Enoch praise God hallelujah every saint that's ever been raptured every saint that's ever been delivered God has always prepared his Spirit loving his holy ghost abiding his obedient children to escape judgment God will do the same today praise God Hallelujah he's always done to praise God verse 37 but as the days of nowhere so shall the coming of the son of man be okay that's brother Ram's ministry right we can see that from those days that they were before the flood they were eating and drinking Mary and giving him heirs until the day that Noah entered in the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shout now here we go then shout to be in the field one shall be taken the other left does that fit any of the other descriptions it only fits the Rapture when's the sign of your second coming right the second coming it doesn't fit when the temple is going to be destroyed well they're only going to take one of you when the temple is destroyed they're only going to take one of you I'm only going to take one of you at the battle of Armageddon it doesn't make any sense verse 41. two women shall be grinding at the Mill the one shall be taken the other left watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord does come aren't you glad you're watching and praying today that you could be out there tailgating for the football game you could be out there uh get uh trying to get over a hangover something like that but where are you you're in the house of God you're telling God Lord I love you I know you're coming soon I'm watching and praying I'm doing exactly what you told me to do I'm obeying your word praise God hallelujah amen remember Jesus said if you keep the word of my patience I'll keep you from the hour Temptation that comes upon the face of the Earth praise God hallelujah you have a thus saith the Lord promised praise God Hallelujah that's what I'm anchoring my life on praise God my soul everything praise God now look at verse 43 but know this that if the good man of the house had known in which in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh see most of the world is not going to be ready for us coming he's going to come at an hour when you think not that makes me think he might come in a time of prosperity because that's that God always told that to Israel when you got rich and increased with Goods you forgot about me oh it's all through the Old Testament whenever they get focused whenever they have natural blessings that's when they would fall away it's always that way Now by God's grace we can balance it by the grace of God but we also go through highs and lows in our finances right none of us are just constantly oh here twenty thousand eighty thousand hundred thousand two hundred thousand I got 10 million I mean none of us are going like that if you are I would have seen it in the ties right then you're steal from God if you if you're not paying tithes no we don't desire to be rich on this end but God has blessed us mercifully and so we thank God for that we try to help out we give all of us we help out the people that are less less uh less blessed than we are so he said watch verse 45. now here's what we want to be who then is that faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made him rule over his house to give them meet and due season so God needs faithful preachers to feed us the meat of God at the right season praise God blessed is that servant whom is Lord when he cometh shall find doing so think about all those preachers let's go back to 1977. think about all those preachers Karen and Laura saw they were just they were taking brother Adam's ideas and making it thus at the Lord and they warned all those people the Rapture is coming were they given the Rapture is coming by next year were they giving them meet and seas in church no that think about that was that meat in season like you got let's say it's October you got two more months and the Rapture is going to happen by set by 77. was that meat in due season no what would have been the meat in that new season well get the baptism Holy Ghost getting three would get Justified sanctify fill with the Holy Ghost that's all the meat for the season so see church that's why we can't just get we can't get our eyes off of what's most important we got to keep focused on loving the Lord with all of our hearts Souls mind and strength we gotta we gotta trim our lamps praise God this is uniting time we gotta we gotta become more mature we got to lay in the prince of the sun we got to stay connected to Jesus we got to bring forth fruit in a season praise God and the danger is that now is like back in 2015 Bengal remember and amen and who and uh everybody I was here uh the blood moons right the blood moons I heard a person who left the message this week he was on a podcast he left the message one of the reasons he left because his his message preachers kept predicting the end of the world first it was 77 then it was 2005. I don't know where they got there from and then it was 2015 with the blood moons and finally he's like I'm out because they don't have they don't have any more reasons I see Church where was that was that message Church giving them the meet and due season no no but see I desire to give you the meat in due season praise God and I believe God has helped me to do that praise God and if he hasn't somebody like I told on Wednesday somebody come let me know praise God so I don't want to get your eyes off the main thing I'm gonna get your eyes on Jesus Christ praise God Hallelujah keep your eyes on Christ now verse 46 blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find him so doing verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delays is coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with a drunken now see that now that we got to watch that too because I told you last week I don't feel like the Rapture is any day now and someone might be confused and say well you say he's delaying his coming no I'm saying I don't think I'm I'm going to guess it like it's going to be next week because I don't have that same spear because I'm not getting drunk with the things of the world you see they're falsely predicting like Joseph Branham and all those preachers they said back in March the Lord was coming here we are where is he they're wrong praise God see it's just if there is a fear-mongering system to keep them empowered keep looking to them keep looking at them rather than looking to the word of God praise God Jesus had been delaying his coming for 2000 years we want to live like he's coming any moment but we also want to keep our lives holy and keep serving praise God and keep focused be faithful because Jesus said if you do that I'll make you rule over much praise God so once you understand that I'm saying I don't believe it's going to be any moment because that's what the the preachers who are calling themselves the greatest of all time they're saying it's going to be like now or next week or something like that and they've been wrong for the last 10 months or eight months or so so I I just want you to understand we got to have balance on these things I hope I hope you understand by God's grace for some reason I just feel like I just can't say it the right way in other words Jesus choosing to delay but we can also be ready for the Rapture spiritually by the grace of God all right I hope you got us forgive me now look in verse 49 see he smites his fellow servants eat and drink with drunken the Lord of that servant shall come in the day when you looketh not for him in an hour when he is not aware of him now look we're looking for Jesus today we're looking for Jesus praise God we're looking for him to come today praise God but our lives are going to stay cleaned out to the word of God we're not going to let our lives slip we're not going to compromise we're not going to worship idols we're not going to enjoy worldly things we're going to take our pleasure in one thing that's the Gospel of Jesus Christ and if he delays praise God he delays but if he comes praise God he comes we're ready praise God verse 50 the Lord that servant shall come today yeah when you looketh not for him in an hour when he's not aware and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites that's the tribulation and there should be weeping and nationality well there's a chapter okay so see there you have the you somewhere in there you have the destruction of the temple which was uh pray that your flight be not in winter when you got to run with the babies away from Jerusalem because remember they surrounded Israel and they starved out Israel for was it five years they starved out Israel and then they slew Israel until the blood ran out of the house of Herod before they destroyed it Josephus wrote about it Titus did awful things some of the most wicked things but it was judgment because they rejected Messiah well you also you have the Rapture the sign of their coming and the end of the world Armageddon can everybody see that all right hopefully you can see that by God's grace all right so that's a great mystery you know God hid uh it's a great uh mystery godhead all those three answers in there but they're not in chronological order all right now just re think of some recent birth pains I was meditating on this this week think of the recent birth pains since brother Ram left I showed you pictures I'm going to show you again these 1970s right after brother left had a time of awful inflation and even gas shortages my dad told me about it um and Jimmy Carter ran up inflation to the highest it ever was in January 1981 I always remember that because I was born in November of 80. and I just remember that date but then that awful birth pain like it looked like the end of the world did it not you've got to stand in line to get gas for your car it looks like the end of the world right your money all the jobs are going away there's no Brett there was actually bread lines and things like that but then in 1980 Ronald Reagan came in and it became a nation of prosperity and I was alive I was eight years old when they started the Desert Storm War I remember that I still remember going to the grocery stores and hearing them announce it seen on the magazines there's a short war Desert Storm War just like Jesus said Wars rumors of wars and then of course the Afghanistan War 2000 it was 20-year war and then Biden left all the billions of dollars of weapons there for those Wicked people they kill Christians and it's just all this wicked stuff and there was a time of prosperity but then the 20 I'm sorry 2008 recession hit right with a housing recession it impacted the whole world but then under President Trump there was a time of prosperity the uh everything reached its highest level the uh the stock market and everything housing prices and then what happened in 2020 and covet happened another enough pestilence right and I think they said last time it was six million people died from covert which is about the same as the flu every year if there is a coven bank and I talk about that something but we also saw The Birth the worst birth pains though were the mandates where you're going to lose your job if you don't take this vaccine which is a pre-figure to the mark of the beast right and now we're seeing course inflation Rising inflation because they printed off trillions of dollars don't go to work we're going to pay you not to go to work worst decision worst decision they can make and keep the kids out Works everybody at my school and other schools are talking now the kids coming down to school they're so far behind everybody else because they were the generation that didn't go to preschool and their parents must not spend any time with them but I mean I I have students that are very Advanced a couple of because their parents spent time with them every day so Church you got to spend time with your parents I'm sorry the parents you got to spend time with their kids if you want them to be smart don't push them in front of the screens that's what I got today I gotta I over 70 of my classes below level in Reading it's unbelievable I I just I'm shocked I go into work every day I'm like help me Jesus and I got the behavior problems on top of that I'm being spit on and slapped and pulled my tie and all these kind of things but all because of coven it's a bird pain right it's a bird pain and now here we have another pain like two in a row 20 20 and 20 22. a Roar and all the preachers are saying oh this is the sign of the Rapture is it the sign of the Rapture we'll see but let my voice be recorded if time goes on let my voice be recorded of what I said I'm going to make a video on that if this goes on and that war ends and we just go back to I'm going to make a video on this and show everybody I'm gonna put the actual preacher's videos on there see because they're they're not praying about these things before they're preaching them same thing happened in the 70s same thing happened just not even 20 years ago I'm not saying there's going to be a a Prosperity but what if time goes on something has to happen right it's been that way it's been this way for two thousand years sorry Mercy two thousand years wars rumors of wars pestilences earthquakes peasants uh all all this it's been going on for 2 000 years we can see they're getting closer all right now I just have a little just this will help Austin lean on those who didn't know about Daniel 70 weeks but so Daniel 70 weeks is broken up into three parts the first set was seven weeks that was uh from 4 45 to about about 500 BC okay let me just get these up here so I'm done with all the all the in build-ins are they're called them okay so so the Holy Spirit told Daniel Israel has 490 years left well 49 years was to the building of the temple and then 434 years was till the time Messiah was cut off but then there was a pause and then God said I'm going to Blind the Jews I'm going to go get me a gentile bride amen since they rejected my Messiah says they rejected the bridegroom I'm going to go get a a gentile bride praise God and no one knew how long this would be well actually the Bible did prophesy of it it said after two days I'll return to Israel after 2 000 years amen I'll return I'll give you a former Atlanta Reign praise God that's right Jose did prophesy that I was wrong on that so now we've had 2 000 years of seven Church ages the last so another in other words Israel has seven more years of ministry okay they had 483 years so far in Ministry and now they've still got seven years left in Ministry did I finish that one okay all right so does that help Austin Lena does that help Daniels Daniel chapter 9 is so important for understanding the end times and if I I may preach on it you know again we'll see but so important because as soon as the Rapture goes that time that clock starts it's like God paused the clocks kind of like today like with the daytime savings you know he just really reset the clock well it's like God press pause on the clock 2000 years ago on Israel's clock they've only got seven more years left and that's then Jesus returns and he sets up the millennial Temple the Bible said Everlasting righteousness will come in at the Millennium praise God they had 490 years until Messiah was set up Everlasting righteousness on the earth praise God Amen remember there's a six-fold purpose that Gabriel's coming remember that we last preached on that long long time ago it's five or six years I have to break that one out and preach refresh that and bring it on up to date by God's grace now I just want to share a little bit more on Russia um now my wife was listening yesterday so my wife gave me this quote sometimes when you find a quote share with me you might make it in the sermon my wife on this call with me and shared with me I showed you numerous quotes last week wrote brother man made it sound like Russia could bomb the USA now look at this 1961. now but if Russia ever comes to United States which is one of the leading nations of the western world they wouldn't want to blow it up they would not want to blow it up and the church said see brother was living in a time where it was a very stressful time right both racially politically globally nuclear Wars right Cuban Missile Crisis and so sometimes you make it you'd be really stressed out about it other times he would say no they're not going to invade they're not going to blow us up they might know this court exists I didn't even know this court existed this was preaching Canada Alberta they wouldn't want to blow it up now if you've got if you make every word thus say the Lord like Joseph Branham and all these people how do you make this make sense Russia doesn't want to blown up but Russia will drop one and but we'll be gone moments before it drops because we're hiding in Jehovah Eagle under his feathers how in the world do you make that fit you can't you just got to be insane to accept it they could do it but if they want to do it right now or we could or we could blow that up see we could we could blow brush you right but they'll never ever Say Never Never now this is not thus saith the Lord I just want you to hear I just want you to hear program has different opinions about this they'll never do what he said well I thought this was thus saith the Lord Brother Joseph you see Church you see how we just can't we just can't be deceived thank God Amen we won't be deceived amen because they would destroy everything they want the wealth of the nation and that's scripture that is absolutely scripture I'm going to show you to you again we read it last week I'm gonna show you again Russia wants the natural resources they want the wealth of the nation they don't want uh America all burned up and and all destroy where they can't enjoy the resources of it so therefore they'll try to put them to sleep spiritually and one thing I do not think the war will be a missile Warfare oh so you see now now he says the war with Russia won't be a missile Warfare it'll be a spiritual warfare you should see some of your faces now that'll come and just come in and just take the nation over and put them to sleep oh so we're going to get hit with spiritual bombs from Russia to put us to sleep now not us I'm talking about the nation we'll never go to sleep we're Children of the day yeah let me rephrase that they won't put us they'll put the Sinners to sleep till they get in and get a hole well if they get a hold there and take the United States Canada's a small thing for them now there's nothing in the scripture about Russia taking the U.S or Canada I showed it to you last week all I found is them trying to take Israel so therefore there is nothing really in the world that we can build our hopes upon see that's what the preachers are doing they're building hopes upon oh the Rapture is going to be any day now or any week or any hour they're building their hopes on that and what happens when they find out they're wrong what have they neglected in this time right there's going to be neglect because they're not getting the meat that they need in the due season he says there's nothing we can build our hopes upon upon any achievement that we could give in this world because there isn't no hopes for it there's only one hope that is Christ it's true so I want to thank my wife publicly thank you for finding that quote honey you know she every Saturday morning she listens and she's listening to him in order you know from 1960 I think she started and so this is where she was at on Saturday so thank you darling sure helping me out today praise God I just knew that was God I was studying on this yesterday and she sent me the text right when I'm sitting at my desk that's got to be God Amen now actually I changed this there's five reasons here let me change that I did I forgot to do that one I said this last week I increased it to five there's five reasons I don't think nuclear war is imminent first they're ignoring Revelation 13 16 where brother Branham said they're fear-mongering us and they're ignoring brother Adams pick up the pen and write description the pickup in Penn says uh that the bride members will be forced to stop preaching and won't be able to minister to the saints that need Ministry well how's that going to happen uh if the bomb comes while we're sleeping and we get rapture while we're sleeping how they're going to stop us from preaching they're not so that's that's what they're saying they're saying things like that see they're ignoring what brother bam said about Revelation 13 16 and he said the Holy Spirit told him to write that and they're also now imminent nuclear war would also mean there's no squeeze time which is why one of the brothers says it's just a spiritual squeeze we're in right now he said we're in the spiritual squeeze right now now Church listen we've always been in a spiritual squeeze you don't think Paul was spiritually squeezed when he knew death was coming and he had to go give his life and get his head chopped off as a martyr don't you think he felt squeezed every believer down through the age has been squeezed but the squeeze we're talking about is the squeeze of the United States and their nominations take laying down the mark of the beast and saying if you don't take this Mark you can't preach that's the squeeze we're talking about that's perfect that's prophecy that's Revelation 13. so see they got to confuse we've always had spiritual squeezes it's always been spiritual difficulties but we're talking about the one in Revelation 13. so they're wrong I believe we're right praise God now the laws could change overnight but they have to be so cruel right that we'd already hear rumors about them taking the life of dissenters or the conservatives or closing churches we haven't heard any but see with with covid we did see some churches close now they didn't have to but they actually elected to do it right because we didn't close we we just stopped Wednesday night for a few months and Sunday night we stopped we just met once a week for a couple months March April but in May I put it back in there I said well live or die it's 50 days it's Jubilee time and Ms Pastor cam they never stopped any service right but covert went through our church because we went through your church because we went through almost every Church right but it was a birth pain we could see oh here's how the mark of the beast is going to look like it's gonna be this mandate they're going to prep they're going to push it on all the media push it on social media push it on all the TV screens push it everywhere lockdowns mandates because they're eventually going to have a mandate for the mark of the beast cannot preach unless you join our Union also the birth Pains of course get more and more intense doesn't seem like the intensity right now is as severe as the government being licensed to kill all those who defy the mark of the beast just doesn't look like America is ready to kill everybody that doesn't take the mark of the beast doesn't look like that to me number two they're ignoring now get your Bible here uh they're ignoring the fire in the Book of Revelation I didn't really get this one studied out last week so I wanted to bring this out to you today go to Revelation 13 13. I want you to show this I'm just trying to make a point here now fire is used 25 times in the Book of Revelation just the word fire but Revelation 13 13 is the atomic fire and the church said this is the only time I know and I could I'm not God this is just the best I know this is the only time I know atomic fire is mentioned in the entire Bible other than maybe the fervent Heap Peter talked about but we don't know about that that's in second Peter chapter 3. but Lydia can you read that for us read Revelation 13 I'm putting her on the spot today Revelation 13 30. thank you thank you who does that who's he the Beast out of the land that's America United States of America Satan in the United States of America so a br a beast brings fire down from heaven that's and that was Nagasaki and Hiroshima 1945 where's Malachi to correct me on that okay I think that's right so as far when I read the book of Revelation I can find no other fire verses that come from a he or a nation it looks like they're all from Angels now could Angels bring like an atomic fire of course they could they could do anything but if there's another Atomic drama atomic bomb dropping in the Bible we'd have to look for Under Fire or something similar to that now let's go through a few of these here um now most of them are before this Revelation 13 13. but we'll read a few of them here uh Revelation 8 verse 5. who's got a sister's name when can you read that Revelation 8 verse 5. I'll start calling on some people here so thank you amen thank you now this is right before the trumpets are blown so here's Fire coming down from heaven and it's right after the Seven Seals open which is the rapture so this could be atomic fire or this in this case to be holy fire which would act a lot like atomic fire okay right after the Rapture not before after the Seven Seals open okay now if you go to the net in the same chapter verse seven sister who can you read eight verse seven this is the seventh I'm sorry this is the first trumpet if I'm not mistaken um amen that sounds like atomic fire a third of the grass is burned up when was last time I see my watches I've seen pictures of Hiroshima namas Nagasaki I gotta get online and check some of those out to see if all the grasses burn up I imagine it was even the it's even the uh even Pompeii remember when the volcano went off even that was that even all that volcanic ash wiped out all the all the grass let alone fire from heaven now of course that this is this this uh Revelation chapter eight would be the second half of the tribulation period that last three and a half years when the trumpets and the vows and the woes are being poured out okay so that's another case of fire in verse 8 it says uh also and the second Angel sounded as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was cast in the sea a mountain burning with Fire cast into the sea and a third part of the sea became blood a third part of the sea became blood so there's fire again could be atomic fire but the mountain burning with fire thrown into the ocean how's that going to happen only by Supernatural forces okay now Revelation 9 verse 17 we see horses having breastplates of fire that doesn't look like atomic fire uh Revelation 19 8 by these three was the third party men killed by the fire by the Smoke by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths actually I'm going to get my Bible there because it might go a little faster Revelation 9 18. thank you for your patience now church this is what we should always be doing right if there's a question the Bible has the answer right you got a Bible question the Bible's got to answer for you amen this is the sixth trumpet Verse 18 by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths the three what the Three Angels the Bible says were loosed okay so there we go there's fire again now the next one is chapter 10 verse 1 of course that's right that's brother random that's that's the pillar that's the pillar of fire and uh The Cloud of 1963. now Revelation 11 uh verse 5 is fire coming out of the two prophet's Mouse which I believe is spiritual but it could be natural so that's not atomic fire uh 1313 of course is what we read atomic fire that's the uh two atomic bombs 1945. Revelation 14 10 is there tormented with fire and brimstone that's not atomic fire 14 verse 18. I'm gonna turn there Revelation 14 18. this is Armageddon according to Scofield and I believe too and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and crowd cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickles saying thrust in the sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the Earth for her grapes are fully ripe that seems to be the 144 000 gather that last Harvest but an angel comes out who has fire so again that could be atomic fire uh Revelation 15 verse 2 this is uh the last seven plagues the Bulls and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingle with fire and then they had gotten because that's Heavenly that's a Heavenly Fire and then they had gotten the victory over the Beast over the image and the mark and over his Mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God that's Israel in heaven so a c uh mingle with fire sea of glass being with fire Revelation 16 18. this is the sixth I'm sorry seventh vowel seventh wow this is the last vial Verse 18 and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as not since men were upon the Earth is that Los Angeles it looks like it to me and so mighty earthquake and so great that was I'm sorry that was 16 18. I'm sorry that was 16 18. I'm sorry I read the wrong one 1618. there's a great earthquake and I'm kind of jumping ahead there but I believe that's the Los Angeles one I could be wrong it could be before the Rapture I don't know but whatever earthquake it is it is the greatest earthquake there ever was what could be greater than that I don't know okay now 16 verse 8 was where I want to go 16 verse 8 the fourth vow and the fourth Angel poured out his vowel upon the son and power was given unto him to Scorch men with fire so an angel has power to Smite men with fire could be Atomic could be holy fire could be the fire of the Sun the heat of the Sun okay uh now Revelation 17 verse 16 says uh the mother heart is going to be destroyed with fire we know that's Russia brother man gave us thus saith the Lord on that Russia will destroy Babylon with fire atomic fire and that's God judging mystery Babylon now Revelation 19 12 as Jesus has eyes of fire amen Revelation 19 20. uh Satan and the Beast are cast in the Lake of Fire Revelation 20 I'm almost done Revelation 20 verse 9. is the Millennium fire comes down from heaven at Battle of Gog and Magog and saves Us in Jesus amen hallelujah Revelation 20 verse 10 the devil's cast in lake of fire and brimstone Revelation 20 verse 14 death and hell were cast in Lake of Fire in Revelation 20 verse 15 anyone not found the Book of Life casting Lake of Fire and Revelation last one the last fire mentioned in the Bible is revelation 21 verse 8 the fearful unbelieving abominable are Liars are cast in the lake which burned with fire Brimstone which is the second death now see church I went through all those to show you this I don't I don't know when the other fire atomic fire is going to be but I just I listed all of them for you there could be some of those I don't see fire before the Rapture I don't see any more atomic fire before the Rapture but again I'm not God I could be wrong God don't have to tell me us God don't have to tell us every time there's going to be atomic fire he can do whatever he wants but with what we know it seems like there won't be uh see like they're ignoring the fire scriptures in the Book of Revelation there have a lack of scripture for what they're saying oh Russia is going to send atomic fire then the Rapture goes well where's that in the Bible can somebody show me that so far the answer is no now remember Church the Earth cannot be heard until after the 144 000 Jews are sealed with the Holy Ghost okay number three the current conditions I mentioned this earlier feel like another birth pain like the 70s and 80s this doesn't feel like the squeeze I shouldn't say that I got the name up there okay so this is what it was like when my dad was uh he would have been in his 20s they didn't have gas they said ask the president for some there was lines for gas I've seen this in Guyana they had to do that in Guyana got they had a gas shortage when I was there they had to line up to get gas for their lawn mowers and everything and this was what I showed last week so it seems like the current war is just another birth pain and now remember church we could see more wars in the future and it would still be pre-rapture prophecy being fulfilled think about that America has gone through two world wars don't you think those people thought the Rapture was any time world wars the entire world fighting but yeah look what happened after the 40s we had the 50s 60s sexual Revolution 70s 80s here we are 90s 2000s here we are I would think of any time there would have been end of the world after those atomic bombs dropped I thought this is the end of the world now everybody's going to start bombing each other but we could still have the end of this war there could be another War think about what if the Russian Ukrainian War goes on 20 years like the Afghanistan war went on it would not be outside of scripture because Jesus said there's going to be Wars Kingdom Rise Against Kingdom all right now number four Russia wants natural resources go to Ezekiel 38-11 Malachi read that for us buddy please I'm gonna put him on the spot there thank you buddy he's on the spot with the piano I'll just make up some song or I'll start off the wrong key all right and amen to you know bless their hearts Sinners don't want to die Vladimir Putin doesn't want to die president Xing from China he doesn't want to die they don't want to they don't want atomic war unless they would have started one already they have no hope for the future they're going to hell if they don't repent they have no guarant they have no future hope they want their best life now like Joel Osteen's book they have no Eternal hope they don't want a nuclear war and one one bomb drop would instantly start all these other nations dropping bombs who who be left to stand remember Russia wants the physical resources of Israel remember I need to show you that if I can show you that they have pictures before 1948 of Israel it's like a wasteland there's I mean the there's no grass that the waters are dried up and then Israel comes back and you should see the pictures now it's it's Lush it's Lurch or it's flourishing with milk and honey I mean uh the buildings and businesses everything's fruitful oh my God because God's people are back in the word God's people are back in the land when God's people start obeying God's word all these blessings come back under that old Covenant praise God and that's what Russia is going to want the Bible says it so Malachi uh Ezekiel 38 11 12 and 13. to take a spoiler to take a prey to turn my hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and the people that are gathered that I've gotten cattle in the midst of the land Chiba and data and the merchants of tarshish with all the young minds there are shall say unto thee Art Thou come to take a spoil past them gathered my company to take a break and carry away silver and gold and take away thank you now remember if you read earlier this is the King of the North God tells us hello I love it amen God tells us exactly what they're thinking praise God just like when was it Elijah or Elisha uh one of the kings of Syria said how does Elijah and Elijah know this and the answer was well God tells the prophet what you're saying in your secret secret Chambers amen here it is God is telling us what Russia is going to say they're going to want the spoils and resources of that blessed land Israel praise God they don't want to destroy they want brother like brother man said that quote Russia doesn't want to destroy America they want America's resources that's what the quote says now I can't find any scripture for that but I can find scripture where Russia wants Israel's resources they've been thinking real hard again today praise God Hallelujah now I added this one the Rapture must be unexpected this is a secret snatching away the world will not be thinking this is the end of the world think about that they will not be saying this is the end this is the end well we better get ready Jesus is going to be coming back they're not going to be ready for it it's going to be an unexpected time they're gonna be the Bible says it's gonna be a time of night time they're going to be sleeping they're not going to think nothing's wrong there's not gonna be any Rapture they're they're going to totally miss it but with all this nuclear war talk they think it's the end of the world right so that's a fifth reason I put in there it has to be unexpected where people are not looking for does everybody understand by God's grace so I just gave you five reasons there I'm glad this is on a recording there I can always go back and update my uh my thoughts and my reasons right our reasons now remember there's two quotes don't worry about Russia I read these last week Bill said many are thinking Antichrist is Russia he said don't worry about Russia it's Rome Rome is anti-clark Rome is the Antichrist it's either Antichrist sits right by you that's a Deceiver of course they're sitting right by you there in Jeffersonville but they're not actually gathering in church so I actually can't say that another one was see don't worry about Russia Russia is a small pebble on the beach don't worry about communism you watch romanism when it's uniting with the churches see that's what we're looking for church that's what I'm that's what I'm looking for I'm looking for America to unite with the churches and Rome and change laws in times and seasons that's what I'm looking for because that's what Revelation 13 says and I preach that to you all these 16 years now I'm going on seven almost 16 and a half years pastor and yeah you know by God's grace that's what I've been looking for all these years because that's what brother said in the church age book spoken words Original Seed 1962. now let me just rehearse these briefly I'm almost done here almost done everybody should be feeling at least one hour healthier today right so you can handle a little bit more preaching today now I have a video about this uh sorry it's it's ours sometimes I say my videos are ours but really it's ours because I couldn't afford all this uh technology without your ties so that's why I say there are videos but it's our third most popular video only 128 000 but you know makeup's our most popular long hair and then long dresses is our fourth most but so I put all these on that video uh seven years old yeah so 2015. so uh we have thus saith the Lords about the driverless cars which I still think is future personally because I've never seen a family driving down the road playing checkers yet but I'm I'm looking for it I wouldn't even mind if it's my family praise God I don't like driving I'd rather spend my time on better things than driving um United States we have Let's see we have five six seven Broadband gave us seven thus saith the Lords about the United States Los Angeles will be judged in sync now I showed you where that was I think it's Revelation six no I'm sorry I think it's Revelation 16 18. that's what I think I think that's the worst earthquake I could be wrong um U.S will take the mark of the beast woman will rule United States next major Vision I still think that's future God will destroy the USA God will never have a nation I'm sorry USA will never have a nationwide Revival USA will have a Peg and Rome like persecution I believe that's a tribulation that's thus saith the Lord America is going to kill uh dissenters like Rome did uh in the Pagan the Pagan ancient Rome time and the seventh major Vision that's the that's the explosion in America I don't that's one I don't know I just showed you all the fire Scriptures it could be one of those fire scriptures in Revelation or it could be the day of the Lord that burns like an oven where the Bible said they'll be destroyed with fire I don't know where America being destroyed in the Bible is and if any of you uh find out you let me know I believe God can speak through you I believe God can give you Revelations and the church said I'm not the only one God speaks to right God speaks to you too praise God but it has to be it would be like some type of explosion some that's where everyone said he said on explosion and craters so I don't know where that one is but we believe it's thus saith Lord because all the other things brother Adam said thus say the Lord that have come to pass so far and all the scriptures he gave us the doctrines he gave us with us saith the Lord that we know are right all right now Mark of the Beast it will be some form of unionized religion you have to agree with the the church and the state and brothers said thus saith the Lord denominations will talk take the mark and I shared with your brother on a text of last month I said are you ready to come out of that denomination I never heard back from him but just so you know brother I love those guys I told him I love you I'm praying for you I said we talked about that now it's probably been like five or ten years ago I said when are you going to come out of that I shared it with love I always do by God's grace it's thus saith the Lord they'll take the mark of the beast uh now I forgot I didn't have time I just forgot I must got busy you know get ready for church or something like that but there's thus hate the Lord's about Roman Vatican Russia will destroy the Vatican in one hour it's thus saith the Lord revelation 18. and then reassurance for Christians brother Adam said thus saith the Lord the message of Malachi 4 will turn our hearts back and we will have the fullness of Pentecost in the latter rain that's thus saith the Lord Brother Adam says praise God in church we're so close all we need is a little more power praise God we've got the right Doctrine we've got holy living praise God we got all these we got so much of the apostolic right we got the baptism we got the godhead we have so much we have we have wonderful testimonies all year God answering prayers all we just need is a little more power amen that's nothing for God Amen we just need a little more power Hallelujah and they had power where a lame man they could say raise and walk and the man got up that's we just need a little more power by God's grace Hallelujah you think that you think that's hard for God you think raising up a a paralyzed man is hard for God no right and brother Brown says that's not even the greatest Miracle the greatest Miracle is getting the Holy Ghost amen being saved amen so see we have power we just need a different kind of power amen ah hallelujah amen thank God I had we had friends come over a couple weeks ago from the horse Ministry and they said we he said something along the lines that we've hardly ever met a family like yours and they said you're our favorite family that they interact with no I wasn't trying to be we're not trying to be the favorites we just love Jesus but that's a man and he said I work he said I have meetings weekly with all these Millionaires and these Christians and of all that he looks at our family he said he said there's something different about your family see he's with all those denominations amen he's with all those wonderful over there millionaire denomination guys but he comes down to our family he says there's something different about you it's the word it's the holy spirit it's Jesus Christ praise God how did this real Holiness amen it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's Christ in us working mightily praise God we get those all the time it's not just once in a while we get those often there's something different about this message this message is the message of Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah and then I gave reassurance for Christians brother Randolph said if there ever would be an invasion he said the bride will be gone before that thus saith the Lord because the bride doesn't suffer through the tribulation period but again there's Christians dying around the world Nigeria Kenya there's all kinds of Iran China there's all kinds of examples Christians are still dying they're still Martyrs so we can't say we'll never have trials we can't say we'll never have tribulations but the bride as a whole will not go through the trumpets and the vows and the woes thank God for his Mercy praise God now I made another video about this one 14 Signs Now this there's a lot of overlap on here uh put it out eight months ago another church we all we almost have 14 000 subscribers and most of our videos don't even get a thousand views you know so who cares that's why that's why I've never asked for one subscriber I'm like I just want God to take his word and just give it to the person who needs it I've never asked for one penny one subscriber I've never said well you like And subscribe and all those things I will you will you support me on my my campaign I only got one campaign that's to finish the Great Commission praise God to preach this words and to preach this word until the last soul is saved Hallelujah amen anyways oh I got these out of order sorry I got them out of order so the Sinners will be unaware of the Rapture the Mantra will be peace and safety scoffers mocking Jesus coming Noah's conditions right silence conditions homosexuality that's obvious deceivers will grow worse and worse like Joseph Branham Falling Away few will have genuine Faith birth pains men will love themselves more than God gospel preached to Every Nation new laws and the squeeze but later rainfalls is returning to Homeland and nominal churches in laodicean condition now I'm about ready to close here so just bear with me everybody take a deep breath can you I'll try to put a lot in here today by God's grace I want to just show a few more visuals here now these are the ones we could be wrong on I could be wrong about the ones before the Rapture I just tried to show you what Jesus Christ said in Matthew 24. everybody understand that by God's grace okay now in two look I put this out in 2007. I printed this on 2 April 21st 2007. I just started I just been a pastor for one year right and I said this is subject to change by further Revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ I said that in August 3rd 2008. so this is my order of events the maturation of the wheat and tears or the squeeze next was the catching away the church the Rapture uh the Great Tribulation and then the battle of Armageddon the millennial Reign I forgot the marriage supper lamb happens at the same time as a tribulation uh St Louis at the end of the Thousand Years Gog and Magog white Throne judgment second death new Heavens new Earth now the reason I want to show that is because brother Brown puts it up here he said when you start talking when you start getting mad about when things happen you don't even get the message of your day he says don't get caught up arguing about the order of events he said because you'll miss what God is doing so I'm not arguing about anything but I've had all these I've had 16 years to preach I mean at some point I might as well preach I need to preach on the order of events because we have how many have questions about the end times I do everybody does we got to address it at some point I love this quote brother man says he says now it might come the same way today wouldn't it be too bad if it would and we've we've got to all draw it out and we've had so much schooling until we make a chart and tell you almost the hour he's coming now that's what message preachers are doing today I could show you the video again I've showed you the video they say he's coming any hour he's coming in any day now that's what they're saying he's coming in and well we tell you whether he's going to be riding on a white horse or in a cloud we just know how it's going to be and it might be all together different when he comes he says I tell you it pays us to be ready say see just be ready for that hour so the point I'm making here hope everybody's okay out there uh the point we're making here is that we don't spend our two a lot of too much time on debating when things are going to happen but every now and then I like to revisit some of these events because like I said we get a clear picture about the order of events especially I hope you can see that with 1977 my if there ever was a time where you guys where we can see you we got to give the people the meat and due season that's a clear example clear example we've got to feed the meet and do season and remember Church remember brother brother Loris and sister care remember what they were saying there was Couples they had so many weddings in 1976 and there were so many people maxing out their credit cards and not wanting to pay it back that's stealing and the preachers allowed it was that giving them their meet and due season no see buy their fruits you're known and the church said let me just give you some examples there by God's grace now I try to list all these events before the Rapture so I tried to organize them now what's happening now now these are all the same these are all things brother Adam says the wheat is maturing we're laying in the presence of the sun it's uniting time we're uniting with Christ one another it's laughter me time it's Malachi 4 time and the church said that's what's going on now also we're eating and prophesying again which is the same thing we are finishing the Great Commission here in Akron we just got Austin Lena two Marcels in by God's grace see God knew there were some souls in Akron that wouldn't be saved and Arizona Hallelujah I believe there's some more out there in Arizona too that are going to get saved by God's grace we're believing hallelujah it's happened praise God we've seen it happen Hallelujah so we just gotta do our part and if God ever anoints me maybe one of these young men right here maybe be a missionary someday we'll see where's that little Zion where's he at here he's got the energy for a missionary we might God might send him out there and he's got the language too he's quite a talker right I'm no pressure Malachi I'm just saying like at some point I like to do missionary work after I retire Lord willing like to put another Pastor in here be faithful and I'm gonna go out and be a missionary by God's grace I like to spend if the Lord Terrors I like to spend my final years you know turning people to Christ I want to feed you while while we're all young feed you get you all strong and spiritually fed and mature filled with the Holy Ghost and everything I like to go be a missionary at some point now what's happening in the world right now the tares are maturing and being bound together right also here's what we're seeing mostly the wars pestilences earthquakes family that's what's happening in the world what's happening with Israel they're returning their Homeland according to all those verses and I told you last week I don't know if you saw the video but they're preparing for a temple they are soaking the wool in the insect uh body parts and turning them red they show you right there on the video we are doing exactly what Aaron said they're getting ready to worship praise God they're getting ready for animal sacrifices all you gotta do is bust down that uh that that uh that Shrine there what's that Muslim Shrine called Temple Mount yeah what's this is Islamic Shrine Shrine on the Temple Mount he's got to break that down somehow and build up a Jewish temple yeah Dome of the Rock thanks buddy all right I got two I got two extra mines two SEC two I got a second and third brain that's what I'm trying to say now here's here's what is rupture there's got to be a squeeze and a lot of rain for us there must be a squeeze of the One World roman-led Government now I don't know when these are going to take place I don't know if is Israel's gonna are they gonna start the temple before or not the Rapture I don't know I think we'll see that beforehand uh the driverless cars undress I mean that could be argued could be no I don't know they could go out of order I don't know um woman leader I believe that's Rome I believe that's I believe that is that I believe the sixth vision is Rome putting down the mark of the beast and the explosion we don't know the explosion okay now during the first three and a half years of the tribulation you have a three and a half of your ministry of Mosin Elijah and they begin tormenting with plagues now we don't know how many people they torment the Bible just says they torment uh then the Antichrist is revealed he makes a seven year Covenant with Israel and I didn't have time to put all the verses on here but I got them in my book the Jewish temples rebuild or finish in animal sacrifices are resumed remember Church the tribulation is also called Jacob's trouble because all the armies come against Israel and contains the Sixth Seal like Jesus said then the second half you have the end of the first half of the Covenant Rome breaks the Covenant Israel no longer allowed to have animal sacrifices the two prophets are killed raised from the dead are Rapture in the sight of the whole earth my and then a tenth part of Jerusalem falls in an earthquake 30 days after the broken Covenant according to Daniel 12 11 Rome sets up the abomination of desolation I believe that's the Pope in the Jewish temple 45 days after that the Jews will be blessed now I believe that's when uh though 144 000 will receive Christ and a nation will be born in one day that's what I believe then sometimes Roman or Allies like Russia the kings of the north Russia King of the South Egypt and kings of the East China they send all their armies against Israel and then sometimes Jesus reveals himself 144 000 uh you have the seven trumpet sound I don't know when the Vatican is going to be destroyed in there or the seven vows poured out I don't know if that's the fervent heat before the millennium and then of course after that you have Armageddon Antichrist Castle Lake of Fire now here's some things I didn't put on here remember it takes seven years to burn the weapons of the King of the North King of the South and kings of the east east seven years Israel burned their weapons so that goes into seems like the millennium and then for seven months they're going to be bearing dead Russians Egyptians Chinese anyone and all the nations that come against Israel for seven months they're going to be bearing them that's what Ezekiel 38 and 39 say then you have the millennial reign of Christ okay so again Daniel 70 weeks I'm almost done I keep saying that but I am almost Daniel 70 weeks have broken up into three parts seven weeks 62 weeks one week the church ages are right in here I already showed it yeah so you have the seven weeks the 62 weeks until the time a size cut off 69 of the 70 weeks have been fulfilled then you have Jesus okay then we got this one I'm gonna skip this one because I already did that one uh I'll just do the new one here it's my last one let's stand to our feet a musician's gonna come I'll just do the last one now here's the best I can do so far I got a couple more dates to get on there but the best I could do so far the first thing is the rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ that ends the time of the Gentiles God goes back to the Jews now here's a good question I thought about this on the way to church when is the mark of the beast laid down actually I think it might be during the second half and the reason I believe that did I have my notes up here yeah the reason I believe that I just thought about while I was praying I didn't plan to do that the reason I believe the mark might be in the second half because if they laid down the Mark at the beginning the 144 000 Jews would be killed because they're not going to worship Rome if they take the mark they're eternally lost then they can't get the Holy Ghost did you ever think about that I never thought about that all these years till this morning so there might be pressure leading up to the mark before the rapture but the mark probably won't be laid down until the Beast makes himself like he's God in the temple of God claiming that he is God so I don't know something to consider of course that would mean the foolish version then wouldn't be killed until the second half of the Great Tribulation so for the first half you have the torment Ministry of Moses and Elijah then you of course that's the temple being rebuilt then you have the Sixth Seal which is the second half that's also Jacob's trouble The Sixth Seal of course the pope breaks a covenant you have the death Rapture of Moses and Elijah or two men with their Spirit then you have the abomination of desolation 30 days after that and then you have Jesus reveals himself and seals the 144 000 Jews 45 days after that I believe then you have the seven trumpets seven vows Vatican the kings of the north south east all battle against Israel Armageddon fire I don't know how much time's in there then you got the millennium and the church said amen God bless you praise God let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer When shall these things be Church it is a normal thing for a holy ghost-filled Christian to ask those questions when are these things going to be when is the sign of your coming Lord God these are normal things to ask and church if we're Faithful Servants God will give us the meat we need in
