I've done a couple song specials but they're far view between and struggled and stumbled through them by God's grace so this morning we taught on the Antichrist spirit ways to look at identify it we want to obviously want to do our best to sit on always we want to do our best to identify the Antichrist spirit seek the mind of God and do our very best we can so I heard through the grapevine a little thought a brother a head and I thought on and I thought on it I thought it was it's very simple but I think I taught just at home on Wednesday by the grace of God and I went well very well so we went to hopefully Lord will be a blessing here again tonight I think our pastor Jesse there for inviting us out and being with us so if you want we stand here ever the reading of the word by the grace of God simple little thought if we're going to go through the three passages of Scripture by grace by the grace of God in Matthew 728 since God as the rapture draws near we want to have our we want to have full understanding full revelation ready to go at a moment's notice spiritually speaking and if you think about everything that's going on in the world today there's always a spiritual type in the natural we have Preppers they're storing food there's a Malaysia ammunition and guns escape routes and but in the spiritual we are also Preppers and we were eating the Word of God we have our Bible full of nuggets we have Prayer speaking the word spiritual warfare all those things so as you think on everything natural that comes to you there's a spiritual reason so here in Matthew 7 verse 28 he says and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes who is this man why is he speaking in such a way go to Matthew 13 verse 54 Matthew 13 verse 54 and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said whence has man this wisdom who was this guy who is this guy he says and these mighty works not only could he speak in such a way and act in such a way but power signs wonders and miracles follow as well he says and now here's as investors verse 45 is not this the carpenter's son isn't that not his mother his mother called Mary and his brother and James and Jose's or josie's and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not all here with us whence hath this man all these things so they're confounded by this man Jesus they're compounded by Christ one more set of scriptures here in Matthew 5 verse 48 the Bible says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so let's bow our heads this evening here do you have the father Lord Jesus we just love you Lord Lord we're not tossed around by every wind of stranger doctrine Lord where Lord we were not even concerned about this life Lord and nor with though some may be short here or lacking here or a loved one here or Lord there's a concern maybe a little anxious desiring their heart Lord Lord we're not worried Lord Lord we we see the devil coming in like a flood Lord but Lord you promised in your word Lord to be a standard guard Lord he would raise up Lord and we just love your Lord and Norway we just be so humble over here and may take full control of Lord my little mouth here God and tongue Lord and and Lord just bless the people or be the here may they just catch the revelation the very thought here we're trying to express Lord we love you so much Lord bless the people Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats so today tonight here we want to speak on be perfect in this a just the end of the end time is far spent I was at home preaching this and I raised my hand I said are you guys gonna give up anyone here ready to give up fold up just head on back into the world do the things this can't this came to me the other day my sister had went to a search and I believe was like a a wedding or something there was DJ's there playing and come to find out as we come into the Word of God and the truth the our many men brothers and sisters of faith at that time we witnessed to them and they rejected it and the Bible says when you reject the Word of God you you you wander into darkness and at this wedding or wherever they were at there was some DJ's playing and here they were Christian DJ's in the name of the the DJ thing was divine symphony or divine inspirations or something like that and here they're playing ac/dc they're playing Metallica they're playing all these things and yet they're Christian DJ artists so it shows that the world the Christian nominal Christian world is not living the truth I've been in the trades now a construction for almost 15 16 years I'm sorry 18 years almost now and in that course of span of working in the construction I'm at one Christian true true Christian as far as the majority Christians I meet they're they still they still cuss and swear til dirty Joe they drink socially they my smoker cigarette here are there they live just like the world listen to ungodly music and those things but one man I didn't meet and I watched him the entire job I watched him and looked over him and tried him and I seen when he was next to someone who told a bad joke and he he didn't even crack a smile and I thought that was a gallant of him and remarkable for even in a sanctified state you know did a tremendous job and I at the end of job I walked to him I said John Babcock I said you're a real Christian and I shook his hand and he said thank you brother Simon I said I watched you and I said you're clean he said thank you brother so I appreciate that so anyhow we want to preach on on be there perfect a thought had common and in first Corinthians two if we could let's turn to 1st Corinthians 2 verse 6 the Bible says here st. Paul the prophet of that day that one that packed packed the Word of God that understand and had the revelation of Jesus Christ in his day look how he starts this he says howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect how many here is perfect by the grace of God we know perfect is not in the flesh perfect is not in the spirit realm but it's down into the soul of the Holy Ghost believer and that's what we're looking and that's what we're talking about this morning he says howbeit we speak the wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world saints of God it scientifically it doesn't matter a medically a does not matter we're talking about spiritual perfection here he says he says uh yet not the wisdom of this world nor the prison's world that come to naught he says all these things come there still finding scientific discoveries that are being disprove of old science they had see they think this happens and that happens and this takes root but every day there's a new scientific discovery and they have to rewrite now their science books so they should be he says but we speak the wisdom of in a mystery he says even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they had known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory right he says now in verse 9 he says but as it is written eye hath not seen he says as nor ear heard neither have loved into the enter have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath before prepared for them that love him see so in our greatest understanding we cannot understand what Jesus Christ has for us over there up beyond or up in heaven as we pass through the heavenly portals these earthly portals moving into the heavenly ones we cannot end as a as I taught back home there and have you ever seen doctor Kent Hovind he's old creation the Evangelist he said he said now he says maybe we if we cross over there he says what do you think about colors he says new colors have noises your colors smell up there is there more colors we know by the the scientific spectrum of light eases or frequencies there's only a certain portion and we can actually see of the the waves there okay the light waves but but the majority we cannot see he says what if there's new colors show me a new color we could put purple and blue and pink together but but that would not be what I'm talking about we're talking about something heavenly up there there's things we can't even imagine or even comprehend with our mortal minds right he says but God has revealed to live unto us our spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of God he saw so if God has his plan and he's up there and he's only revealed a very important of his plan here that shows that he goes much much much more deeper than we can even comprehend over here correct a man he says for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man he said we can't even understand the true nature of God he says but the Spirit of God he says now we have received not the spirit of world but the spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God so the things that he give us he said now there are he's does anything get in freely he says we could keep him absolutely he said but only those things that he gives correct he says which things we also also we speak not in the word is in words that which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual everything you know everything you were heard bring it back to a spiritual sense you must to be perfect you must be spiritual we were born in these fleshly bodies in this fleshly world to snatch your world but we must now a sand into something heavenly saints of God every natural battle battle you see is caused by a spirit as they were confounded with Jesus Christ why were they confounded to Jesus Christ they're hearing something they've never heard before they're seeing something they've never seen before correct a man he says that which also things we speak not in words of man's wisdom teaches but with the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual he says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God if you remain in a natural state if you keep your carnal mind right here present and never ascent into a higher thought into a higher understanding you'll remain a carnal believer you'll remain a carnal Christian right but in order to receive these spiritual things you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I heard someone just recently preached this he said brother he says maybe we've been preaching the Holy Ghost all wrong how what do we teach here in this message if you repented me baptize in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost everyone that comes and here's this word and God reveals and open up that mystery and is baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ do they all receive the Holy Ghost they don't many have left come and go as they please the Bible prophesies of a foolish virgin well I thought the Bible said then if you repent ameba ties in the name of Jesus Christ for their missionary sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the man said he said this he said there's a one throne room in your heart there's an open little void that science is even proven is open and there's no blood in there no blood vessels is a little chamber in your heart is for the Soul and if you never put Christ on the throne room of you if you never open that if you never take yourself off the throne room of your heart you'll never enter in why because we baptism represents a death we bury dead people and when I was baptized I went down as dead as I could but it was not until a year and a half later I received a full baptism of the Holy Ghost amen yes Lord now see so what we must die out to ourselves fully the reason people do not receive the Holy Ghost the full baptism of the Holy Ghost is because they never let Christ in the throne room Lord have thy perfect will in perfect way I looked at my than one of the other forms of the job and I said Jeff I said and I told him that same little thought there I said it Jeff em you were seeing the Holy Ghost I said I said would you be willing if God told you told you to go to Thailand would you be willing to go he's like I don't know I don't know he says he you can go he'd go he's not ready to die out yet oh my now he says but he that a spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man see so if you're spiritually minded you can judge all things as a very but we have the mind of Christ to be therefore perfect you must have the mind of Christ we must elevate it's time brother just when we were in the world and that we were just was pretty big in basketball I play basketball I practice basketball I love playing basketball but there's a sayings that elevate and decide in the air well I didn't have much hang time but I did I did decide lot of things before I jumped in after I jumped but here we must decide before we get in the air amen he says but we have the very mind of Christ he rose rich and not to the world I work with a man he's in the outlaw motorcycle club he's in the outlaws and he's a one-percenter which is the one of the highest you can get in that Club will he ever read the Bible probably not if I witness to him absolutely the Bible is not written for unbelievers it's written for believers but if you search the scripture there's two kinds of people that God is dealing with in this Bible there's the spiritual and there is the carnal there's the there's the Holy Ghost field and there's one still caught in the flesh and we want to discern which ones we are we want to because remember only the Bride of Christ will make this rapture correct and Romans 8 for he says he says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh after it so we must want every day wake up say our prayers what pray our prayers and read the scripture what he says he says and then what we must walk in the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh he says but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so they that are in the flesh cannot God here Paul is identifying two kinds of believers there's carnal believers and a Holy Ghost filled believers there's spiritual believers and then there's flesh believers a man sure and of course we know he says now yeah but you're not in the flesh if but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwelling you here how many here have their baptism of the Holy Ghost we are believing that we have the baptism the Holy Ghost and if you have the bathroom the Holy Ghost you must now start if you have not already which we believe we have we must now elevate our minds into the spiritual realm okay now in Philippians 2 verse 1 here he says if there be any be there for any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye might be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord or one mind he says these wonderful beautiful words here he says let nothing be done through strife and vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves listen if we can come in contact with one another we must lift the other one up you're the great one your higher Eman you're you're the one that God I'm here to serve absolutely he says and he then he says he says let not let not other every earth look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus Christ came and did the exact same thing for you and I he says who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God this is also in her mind you have to be spiritually minded to catch right here let this mind be in you which was in also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God equal with God as far as Authority the weapon jury spiritually the same the same garments as far as his righteousness the same favors the same sonship all of God he says but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of the servant amen and was made in the likeness of men a man sure we have to have this very mind okay now moving on here in Psalms 40 verse 4 it says blessed is that a man that maketh the Lord his trust and respected not the proud nor such as turn aside unto lies her to lies he says many O Lord are my god are they wonderful works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us word if God has his mind and it's deeper than deep and he has these thoughts about us he said is it he said he said he's in other words God has all these wonderful things he's thinking about us right he has all these wonderful things he wants to share with us they are caught up what in the very mind of God they cannot be reckoned up in order lunch knee if they would declare to speak of them for they more than can be numbered saints of God if we were to draw a circle right now in front in the air here and you would be able and I was like that's all within the circles all of your thoughts I say all knowledge if everything that could be known on the earth was in this circle how much would you know just maybe a little sliver of that circle would be your intelligence do it how many here knows all the plumbing code how many know is here to teach children maybe just how many here knows the electrical code how many knows botany all botany life ornithology who knows Oliver thorn ornithologist study of birds huh I don't I don't know all that see so we're very limited in what we understand and what we know but the Bible says God he's the creator of all things he knows all these things amen it confounds many in Psalms 92 verse 5 O Lord how great other works and the thoughts are very deep amen science still refuses to believe that God created all nature they still reject you they might but even if they look at the smallest thing it's so complex sure the various sale the may I'm me by the way single-celled organisms more complex almost than a human being even though they can dwell within us sure uh now here in in isaiah 55:6 seek either lower while he may be fine but be found he says he says call upon how on upon him while he was near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts amen saints of God is this not the time to call on Jesus Christ the world is falling apart sister when he said all of Hong Kong is an uproar they're called they're trying to pass laws you can deport anyone whether it's false accuser nor true acute accusation wherever they can deport you back to China and then he's then you're pretty much done you're in China's courts then I just saw a thing on Facebook every five minutes a Christian is martyred and a lot of them in China saints of God this is a serious battle the Bible says when you're in prayer he says pray for the ones overseas that are in bounds that are inbound and going through all kinds of hardships Saints absolutely he says he so see we must seek the Lord while he is near ye may be found he says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts he said we must get away from these carnal thoughts okay he says in lay him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God and He will pardon abundantly pardon he says for my thoughts are not your thoughts he says neither are you my he says your ways of my ways saith the LORD for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts since we must understand we have to think like Christ how many spiritual here any spiritual I mean really understand the word let me see so now as we go into the word of God the logos was made flesh he come down onto the earth and this is very simple you know why I love and November they think about this now the Bible is the Bible is the Word of God right it is all the thoughts of God now one thing I love about the Bible is that Christ the Bible was written and he did not just include himself what if there is a Bible what if the by what if got her in the Bible and was all just about him it was all just about his majesty nasgo I wish there isn't contained in there it's think it's contained in there but he was so good that he included Abraham and and Adam and Eve and he included Moses and all these wonderful brothers and sisters of us absolutely he included all those he shared his glory with us he put those things in there but now if you look here in Matthew 4 verse 1 for thousands of years the Old Testament was the law the Old Testament is the way of living eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth it was completely carnal it showed you it it told them how to live naturally the natural Commandments were here then that do this naturally do this naturally do not do this naturally do not do this naturally this naturally this all ordinances and all those things right all natural but when God come on the scene in the form of man in Matthew 4 verse 1 after he the spiritual one came down he was baptized and received the baptism the Holy Ghost but notice tear after directly after the baptism look what happens here then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil the verse November he was tatties water boilers and we know that but he was he was fasting forty days and forty nights in other words the spirit led him right into death it was time for him to die out can you imagine not eating for ten days five days I don't know how many went the longest I ever made it was four days and I just get lightheaded and already passed out from working all that kind of stuff but here our Savior was brought in for 40 days and 40 nights here into the world to be tempted and he fasted 40 days and after he's a hunger now remember here's a man full he's almost dead almost brought up right to the point of death lean had an agent there's nothing but it was met the commandments of the Spirit he says and when the tempter came to him he says if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread right now these are temptations and one by one they would come to Jesus Christ absolutely and Christ would uh he would deal with them a certain way and now Satan is bringing these things and he's challenging him in the natural but Christ now is firing you right back in the spiritual right he says it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I wonder if there's coming a time Saints we know there's a collapse coming how can you be trillions and trillions of debt this nation in debt the entire world is in debt to who we know who how can it last it can't last we know there is coming an economy of collapse it's coming and I wonder sometimes if this spiritual law here is going to have to come into fact I'm so hungry I'm so thirsty let's read the Word of God and it takes control of it it takes it takes it under control what if we will have to do this [Laughter] now thanks you thanks parish what was Christ doing before he even took him he said he was a hungered and he was tempted create something unnatural and here he said he says I'll eat the Word of God we must elevate now our minds Versailles you'll die if you don't eat natural food will I Christ it if you just ate on the Word of God you would live now remember what was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was God from heaven in human form so if God sees it this away then we must see it this way too he was showing how it is up there every way that Jesus Christ act everything that Jesus Christ did reflected how it was up there everything every word every action reflected up there but what was what was he showing here he got tempted three times what was he showing what was he what what major combat ative weapon was he showing what exactly was he trying to convey to who us now the readers and those at that time and to Satan to display the tactics you remember the prophet of God he said Jesus Christ had all power in heaven and earth and he could have done anything he wanted he was at every major gift he could have just spoke this spoke glad the Bible said he was the second Adam and we know the first Adam spoke the Word of God the second Adam could speak the word as well right but here at this time he could have pulled any power out but what did he use used only the word of God right amen what was he displaying saints of God how many is getting hammered here as far as we're getting as far as I was like in my church right now there are many many battles going on many broken marriages cancers sprung up our brother that's been with us now too and a few years still in the wheelchair God has not healed them he's healed but does not manifest her but our church is in an almost like an uproar Satan has come in in such a way but what do we what if was Christ trying to teach us here in James chapter 4 verse 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resists the proud but giveth grace to the humble now look what he says submit yourselves therefore to God and he says what resist the devil at Christ's weakest spot he was at the point of death hasn't eaten for forty days and forty nights and he needed one thing he resisted the temple if anything comes to you I don't no matter he says resist the devil what kind of forms does devil come in financial difficulties mayor told problems physical disease yes any problem any form the devil comes to you in resisted if I went and got tests and said brother sigh you got cancer no I don't did God as brother said enthuse God tell you that I know he didn't tell me that there are many times I've woken up and I had one time I felt like my left arm was paralyzed I couldn't even move it and I saw it for the first time I thought about caught off work and I said you know what I'm in control here God gave me the authority and I said you know what a little arm here you're going to work and you're gonna like it and I got dressed one arm they got everything on one-armed I drove the work one arm and it came back I got to the back of the van I was ready to pull on ladder and say guess what buddy tonight it's time to shine and I made that arm and in their heart I don't know what happened that night but it hurt and by the end of that day I want this thing and it was about 80% back you command whatever you speak the word what you want this is not the will of God that this arm does not work and I spoke it and I made it work and it works never had promised ins resists the devil in any form and he will just say when their timetables on this on July the 3rd know at 4 p.m. no it said and he will flee from me what was that oh I don't know if I should say this maybe one cut this out a certain brother I'll say Lee's a certain brother came and preached at our church and he said he said did you know you're the god of the devil and when he said that I like absolute that's all I needed now I can control him I tell him we wouldn't prayed over a brother that bril Jesse knows and I said death you cannot have this one three days later somebody else from that town died and not him was up now I told death what to do I talked to that brother later on he says he's pretty down and I said brother didn't you just say that you're the god Devils oh my goodness I should listen to my own sermons I said brother when you said it went down deep it told me what now I understand my authority now I understand what I what God has ordained me to do we are here to destroy the devil's is his fortresses his kingdom must be thrown down the power of God must be displayed one more time amen lots more Lord praise be to God so here the Holy Ghost annoys James he says resist the devil and he will flee from you he says draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you he says cleanse her hands he sent his pure hearts you double-minded a man in Ephesians 4:26 he said be easy be angry and sin that it's okay to be mad he's but just don't sin he says let not the Sun go down on your wrath he's anemic neither give place to the devil absolutely I heard the man Achmed say he said he said a lot of times he said he said if you're diagnosed with anything if you would just let it go and not accept the ESA's you'll get better it's how you accept what's present to you yes that's me or no that's not me Amen now let me read this testimony here I'm gonna show you a little testimony here by Malachi 4 by the grace of God okay yes now I want to read because this is so powerful I really really enjoyed this and I read to the home church there and now we know where the Prophet the man of God had had stomach problems right early on when he first became a Christian largest warfare when I was healed with stomach trouble why I remember holding my stomach along here and Jesus and when I was prayed for I didn't have nobody with the gift of healing to pray for me 9 spiritual gifts in the body one of them is miracles and one is healing and he did not have anyone with the gift of healing to pray over him you think he had the easy way out no he had to fight it and sweat it out like the rest of us he's decided to have nobody with the gift of healing pray for me the elder anointed me with oil I read it in the Bible he says I seen God's Word was right and I know he had the right though he was a Baptist preacher you come along anointed me he said the Bible said he poured some all my head he says now do you believe you get well he said I said God I'm asking with all my heart let me get well I went right on down home to start eating my to start into my eating you're not eating I've been drinking barley water and prune juice for about 3 to 4 months his stomach was so bad but he read in the Bible that if the elder anoint you with oil you shall be well that's it that's it they've settled it the doctor now look what the doctor the doctor said one mouth food was sorry one mouthful of solid food would kill you right now any solid food you're dead you're dead you know what I done I went right down home and we had corn beans bread and onions for dinner now look at other than that now that the doctor said this now look at the battle in the home mother was we never had a prayer at home and my dad he was a Catholic he says now he's now going to try and ask a blessing he gets home he's ready Jesus he says let's pray for a blessing he says I'll never forget poor old dad how he cried he thought his boy was gonna die they all sat down around the table and they said they knew they knew that what the doctor said and his dad's watching watching him and he started crying and mother said I don't mind you having a religion honey he said but the doctor said it would kill you daddy said you're gonna die mama sit here and die here the doctor said you're gonna die but he had one scripture if you know what me with oil you will cover but God said I would live and if I die I'm coming up to your house and I meet you the door I died trusting in your word amen he says I tried doctors long enough and doomy didn't do me no good let me tell you something you

going across the floor you know she said how you're feeling wonderful fine she said you're about to die no ma'am no ma'am he smiled back down and kept on going I just smiled his past I could hot water all in my mouth you know he went across room I seen they'd all gone I got the room I start across the floor saying he says what so he got in the room by himself he just laid down you said your mother dies No man just and what he started he starts singing I can I will I do believe I can I will I do bill he started singing I can I will I do believe that jesus heals mean he was resisting the devil why because up there he doesn't have a stomach problem up there there are no problems and if you resist long enough things are going to come to pass you just hold on amen he says I just got weak I almost fell across the the of the bed like that I said all mercy oh mercy and I got up the next day I walked down the street he's still alive you know he says my I didn't care mother come in she watched me all night long sure I'd be dead next morning all them beans was laying right there in the same place said what do you want I want some more beans and cornbread what he's challenging the devil he said get off Harvey this is mother body God gave me this this is my vessel this is God's temple amen this is the devil's temple this is God's temple and the devil is not supposed to be in here he's supposed to be out in John places amen yes though he says he said oh yeah I want some more beans and cornbread yes Oh devil wasn't going to cheat me out of this one no no God said look at the military stance he takes with the Word of God no gift of healing in a Baptist preacher just an argument oil it this was Malachi for what and he had a fight every year every inch for his healing a man that's right he said that's right he said I'd rather who saw well he says he said he's bringing it down to me he said whosoever will as far as just put your name in there and they'll be healed he's about but every who said well I know it's mine uh-uh let's see here no he says and I said wonderful I go down the street mouthful of beans swallow them back no no I wasn't going to spit them out no sir strong the right back the Lord blessed them their mind kept on let's see he says as he was walking down straight is his hello hello brother he said hello how you feeling he said wonderful confession he's fighting him back he would come up he'd swallow down come out and swallow down and he did that until he was completely healed every day every day and the people ministry how your feelings is wonderful now somebody asked me that long ago brother Branham were you lying no I wasn't no I wasn't they were asking how my body was how my body filled I was answering how my faith filled every situation how does your faith feel I'm telling you I I know it looks crazy brother just me our dad still smoke still unbeliever but I just my faith does he's whole if he's Holy Ghost filled every one of my family is Holy Ghost filled I just have the face I just believe it every one of the father's given us will come Jesus said amen if you have faith for just speaking I just believe it nothing could take it from me I just believe it absolutely any man they was asking me how my body they asked me how my body was feeling I was answering how my faith was it was wonderful yes sir yes sir my faith was feeling wonderful because I took God at His Word I didn't care how it felt amen he says if I've been belching up I'd still say I'm healed yes sir that's right sure because God's Word is right do you believe it amen let's sing off amen oh praise the Lord that just lifted my faith up I was like my goodness so here in Matthew 4 verse 17 Christ now is going is starting his ministry everything it went from carnality the word that the Old Testament it was dealing we know the share of the type that was dealing with the flesh man but it was also a type of the spiritual correct notice the very first thing to we're talking about spiritual amnesia lifting the spiritual amnesia having the mind of Christ right being therefore perfect how do you be perfect now watch Christ elevate this watch him elevate in Matthew 4 verse 17 and from that time Jesus began to say in reach they repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand not a natural kingdom a spiritual kingdom and so now he says the spiritual Kingdom is about ready to be set up he's not by the Sea of Galilee salts you but it's up Andrew his brother casting that scene for they were fishermen they were fishers and he said to him follow me and I'll make you fishers of men so what God hand-picked two men who were natural fishermen and these natural fishermen were raised up by their daddy as fishers showed how to fix nets how to throw nets how to cast on this side cast on this seat side you know and then the waves come in now deal with the ocean and the winds and all these things and God said I've been preparing you from your birth up he says you've been can't you been fishing naturally but now it's time to fish spiritually so now these men are going natural fish spiritual fish now we've most of all come in it we've all come into this we already are know these things but notice how he's God is challenging these men now to think higher is this water know the sea is multitude peoples nations and tongues fish in the people fish in the people my how many are going lost in the hell right now thousands and millions are dying every day seven billion people pawn to face the earth you go a generation at seven billion people that majority will prime go to hell if we don't do something or but God knows all things so the first thing here now is easy as easy as look he says it's a spiritual Kingdom spiritual fisherman now moving now on to Matthew and here's the hard thing right here Matthew 18 verse 21 and this is I was healed pretty heavy the Lord healed me after a couple sermons here spiritually and it did just tremendous wonders for me and Matthew 18 verse 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times a brother a brother not a worldly person someone you really love hey brother in the church a system to church look what Jesus Jesus of them I say into thee until seven times but until until seven times seven seventy times seven saints of God if I sin against my sister Wendy here and she's like Versailles bah bah bah I said we forgive me she says yeah what do you have to do to move on because remember up there there's forgiveness and also up there is forgetfulness forgive and forget absolutely clear it out of your mind any offense that someone does unto you you forgive them and forget we can always forgive but forgetting is a very very hard part and that's where I struggled for years until this thought came right here can you forget it can you move on and just say that is it this is out of my mind and look at the individual as a brand-new brother and sister can we do that this is the mind of Christ moving up higher can you totally forget every occurrence a man thirty five so likewise shall my father Matthew 18 verse 35 so likewise shall my Heavenly Father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother hid their trespasses so we must forgive amen now why is that see one of the beautiful things about the Old Testament is shows law this and this if you do this this death do this it's death you this it's death right you'll be stoned or this or that and however you can allow to hold all these things inside of you you're allowed to do that but if you go to Leviticus 19 verse 17 Leviticus 19:17 thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart in thy heart thou shout in anywise rebuked thy neighbor and suffer and not suffer sin upon him thou shalt not avenge neither he says nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord you know my God says that because God does not hold any grudges God does not hold any evil in his heart millions and millions of people treat God like he's absolutely non-existent and God does not hold it to heart there is a time coming well that will come back upon them but for right now he lets them live and do what they want to do but he is God is able to fully forgive and forget it is a higher mindset the very mind of Christ amen in Matt Micah let's see here in Micah 7:19 and he will turn again he will compassion on us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea amen what he wipes it completely out right and if it's like that up there it must be like that here be therefore perfect as your father's in heaven is perfect in Isaiah 1:18 he says though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow saints of God if I sin or you sin we should just be able to cover one another's faults and failures with the I love amen that's exactly right says now 107 as high as heaven as the earth so great is his mercy towards end the period for as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us and I hope we treat each other like this from this day we're forward any fault you see in me just put it as far away from me as I can and these fall I see in you or whatever it's just as it's like it's not even it doesn't even exist amen this is the very mind of God absolutely now I want to show you something here in the Old Testament God was given the laws and the prophets said he that they should have rejected them laws the Ten Commandments correct so look here in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory and the glory as of the only begotten of father full of grace and truth so here we were dealing with the glory of the Sun right the glory logos right he says then in John 17 verse 24 father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory he switched ours given me for that allows me before the foundation of the world there's something special about the logo Saints remember the logos is what the word the Word made flesh what was that what was supposed that word F that logos packing all Redemption was right there because none of the word had to be made flesh and that flesh saved us who were caught in sin in the flesh correct amen so it must be a different thing and now here I'm gonna show you this this deals with it's a it's the shadow of the thunders in Exodus 33 verse 17 Exodus 33 verse 17 and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found grace in my sight and I know thee by name and he said I beseech thee show thee show me thy glory Moses had show me your glory Lord memmer was father-son descending God within the logos and he said I will make all goodness pass before thee and and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will shew mercy on the who mouths show mercy and the Lord said to Moses here in Exodus 34 verse 1 remember the Ten Commandments were broken God brought now this man he said Moses he says I'm going to meet you on that mountain bringt for two more tablets he says and I'm going to show you my glory and our break eases and I will write upon these tablets the words which were in the first tablets we saw break us and be ready in the morning and come in the more come up in the morning upon Mount Sinai and present thyself to me in the top of the mount and in verse 4 and he huge Moses huge two tables of stone like in the first and Moses rode up early rose up early in the morning and went up unto Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded and he took in his hand two tables of stone now look what takes place and the Lord descended in a cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord in the in the tenth commandment says thou shalt not this thou shalt not that shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt not in God when the show Moses something greater he said that's not me he said that's just low that's just something to live by but let me show you some about me and the Lord passed by reform and proclaimed the Lord the Lord our God is merciful he's azan gracious and long-suffering and abundant goodness and truth they might that's the god of the New Testament inna that's exactly who Jesus Christ is keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity transgression and sin and that by no means clear the guilty a man now that's the real God that is the glory of God amen because up there he's not don't do this don't do that he's like I am full of grace and mercy amen yes Lord amen now this ties right in here with Matthew five and verse 1 as he went now into up into the mountain Matthew 5 verse 1 and seeing the mountain he went up into a mountain and and when he was sad the disciples came under him so here is God now descending or came upon a mountain and what did he start to teach and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven he's jesus christ is taking away all natural stuff don't think carnal anymore in the book of psalms david always wondered he said God why do the wicked always prosper why do the people who do wrong always get this and get that and he's always questioning God but that's not the spiritual law then the spiritual law has blessed our poor in spirit for theirs of the kingdom he says blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted Ignite remember the opposite what they think is good is absolutely what is good I say that's like what they think of good is after two what God would think sure because up there what everybody's uh uh there's the kingdom that those that are mourned down here will be comforted of theirs and our meek shall inherit the earth they either do hunger thirst at the righteous they shall be filled he says blessed are the merciful so they they shall obtain mercy this is totally contrary to the Old Testament he says he says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers relieved she call shall be called the kingdom of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of now you want to persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my many my name's sake rejoice to be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven all these natural trials yield spiritual rewards absolutely this is Howard to look at it so just we're almost an hour here we'll just be calling her momentarily obviously can go through all the Gospels and pull out all these high thoughts why did Jesus Christ curse that fig tree according to time of season that fig tree was not supposed to bear fruit but he cursed it anyhow why because up there the tree of life yields fruit every 12 every month in the Garden of Eden up little rubber in the private realm of God the trees bear fruit every man yes sir now look at this here now look he's diving now in Matthew 5 verse 21 you gave heard it was some of them of old time thou shalt not kill but then now he said that's natural law but now I said what's over in whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be a danger of judgment he goes deeper he goes forget about even killing anything are you even angry with him he brings it from a natural act to a spiritual problem this is a higher thought these are things about now we're going into eventually saints of God we are going to into spoken word again this will manifest this very spoken word where we will actually speak and things happen will come into play very shortly but we must get these smaller things ready in Matthew 5 and 27 you have heard that it was said of them a little time thou shalt not commit adultery what does adultery it's a natural act but he says but that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery already with her in his heart see so that is and that is the dealing with the natural acts but there's a spiritual problem yes so in the Old Testament you were guilty if you perform the act in the New Testament you're guilty if you just think about it see the mind of Eldon must elevate to his mind and when we resist the devil we the reason we're resisting a devil by doing these things identifying the spiritual problem what it's in the heart it says now look at this in Matthew 5 verse 38 you have heard that have been said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that ye resist not evil don't resist evil in this way when evil comes just take it just resist Satan now say like that in other words in other words uh but whosoever shall smite you on the treat on the cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at law take away that take away thy coat let them take away thy coat let him also like let him have thy cloak also and who's there shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn out now away in other words give all that you have if something bad happens just wait on God it'll subside but just take it whatever has suffer yourself to be defrauded amen now now look here in Matthew 5 verse 43 ye have heard that it's been said notice Jesus said it is written he did not say it is written he said you have heard so notice the Pharisees and scribes of that day they had added to the Word of God thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy that is nowhere in the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor the Bible says there is no where it says hate thine enemy they added to the Word of God because Christ said ye have heard that have been said he did not say it is written so he catches this and he says he said that's not true but I say if you love your enemies he says bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them the spies easily and persecute you hey man that's right a higher thinking higher law of everyone a man just a little bit longer and of course after all these first five chapters there he's dealing with many things in Matthew 5 in verse 48 be therefore perfect even his father which is in heaven isn't perfect I wonder if you fulfilled us those first four first five chapters you'll met you'll reach that perfection if you can just operate in that you mean you don't have to speak the spoken word you don't have to lay hands on the sick and they shall be recovered you just have to do these simple things and you are perfect you've done the perfect will of God [Music] so here Christ is he's bringing this new doctrine and the people the Bible says were astonished at his doctrine because it's a higher law and then after these doctrines he's bringing forth he what goes on a healing campaign now why is their healing campaign because there's no one sick up there there's no one demon-possessed up there amen that's right because what up there is perfection amen and if we have the mind of Christ we want to see this place just like it is up there if you encounter someone sick go up to it's a brother sister may I pray for you absolutely if you see someone lost a brother sister dear friend do you need Jesus Christ salvation do you even need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you need to receive the Holy Ghost amen do you need to come up higher amen in the Word of God amen amen we are fully trusting in his word because the Bible when I wrote the word even all that which was spoken it will accomplish everything they don't leave that I believe that as well in Matthew 6 verse 25 therefore I sent you take no thought for your life I saw saying one time as you get older you you realize how little time you have and at that point wait when you get a little bit older you realize you're willing to sacrifice more of your life because there ain't much left but if we could we could have caught that earlier on when we were younger therefore I take no thought for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink no yet for your body what you shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than arraignment behold the fowls of the air they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns for your heavenly father feed them or are you not much better than they of this before the fall I didn't have to have job he did not have to work anyone up to that level yet I'll quit my job I'm resigning it and I'm gonna trust God that he's gonna pay all my house payments my bills my electrical bill my eating and all that and my car payment but I'm trusting later have I arrived there yet the Bible says work while you're still daytime but at night there's coming a time will you not work saints of God there's coming a time where we're going we are gonna put this word to the test and God is gonna perform magnificently he is going to perform exactly how he said he would he is going to take care of his bride I believe it there is nothing that could sway me anyway I know he is going to protect us sister you're newer here or whatever I don't know right no you in Matthew I'm sorry in revelations 13 it talks about if you study the scripture study history it deals with America and there's a great persecution coming to America it's hit almost everywhere and we're looking forward to it here we must prepare ourselves we just want to alert you there's these things coming if you look in the religious realm laws being passed things there is a religious movement coming in Matthew 13 the Bible says that Jesus would gather the tares first he'll gather the faults together to be burnt but then he'll bring the wheat into the barn so one of the things we're going to see before the rapture is going we're going to see the binding of the tares and the interpretation that would be the binding of the false churches everywhere they're calling for unity come together come together we must all be one layer down lay down lately aside all doctrine no no we must hold fast to the doctrine we must build her house on that Iraq amen amen yes now in closing in closing if you want to stand here by the grace of God I know I've been a little bit long here I know second services rough keep away there I want to I want to show you one more one more thought here things of God I want my mind to be so transformed to these to this level of thinking for the cam i put my pastor had just talked to a kid just talked to a an evangelist very gifted evangelist very spiritual and he's coming in july i'm gonna be there and he said brother john he said my church is getting tore up it's the devil is infiltrating everything John said praise be to God he says it shows you're on the right track why because the spiritual mind sees battles as Satan's angry whatever is fixing to take place there Satan is trying to stop it and he is the spiritual mind to say praise the Lord sounds like you're on the right track see but the carnal mind is like oh my goodness beside this and brother sigh this and both side that brother sigh that Hunnam God isn't for control we're not gonna let one hair our head turn gray because of worry it's gonna be old age or nothing Amen now here let's end here in John 19 John 19 this is a very some thoughtbut it to me sayings it does tremendous gives me tremendous strength and insight these are simple fundamental thoughts here but this is spiritual if you can if we can always think on this there are many things I see in my own life I went changed and I'm just believing for them I'm waiting patiently I'm resisting everything that I can within me I'm resisting it I'm refusing to look at it but I'm actually want to see what God has promised in John 19 here verse 7 then the Jews answered him we have a law and that by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of God when pyle therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid and when again into the judgment Hall and said unto Jesus whence art thou but Jesus gave him no answer then said Pilate unto Him speakest thou not unto him or speak is now not unto me knowest not that I have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee what did Jesus say thou could have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin Christ was ready to be offered up as a sacrifice to into death and he said let me tell you something my father's in full control here he said anything that's it if there's a government that comes against you law judicial whatever police anything that comes in religious comes against you God has fully allowed this to take place fully allowed it you cannot have any duty was Jesus Christ worried all here he was not worried one bit he said no he knows my father's in full control every time I'm on the road and something happens to a vehicle like it dies or whatever I'm saying Lord I can't wait to see how you get me out of this every situation I run to on the job I'm like lord I know you're gonna show me how to fix this and I he always does he gives me the way am I the smartest guy absolutely not but I always I always when I'm a plumber and when I look at a certain situation here how am I gonna fix this it's underneath the concrete how am i do this does this I say your sander and I kind of wait I wait for the revelation to strike and then once I see oh now I know and I go with it I don't get worried don't get stressed I just wait on God for the answer hey man Saints so I hope that you can elevate your mind tonight to these thinking's think everything you must everything spiritual why is a maje Oh haven't so much rain I really believe the natural then the latter rain is on its way this thing is is ready to go I really believe Saints
