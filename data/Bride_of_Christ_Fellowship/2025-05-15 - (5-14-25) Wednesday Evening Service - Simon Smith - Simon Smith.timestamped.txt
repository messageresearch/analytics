[0:01] Just a couple of things I'd like to
[0:02] stress on tonight. Maybe Pastor Jesse
[0:05] could pick this up wherever he feels led
[0:07] or to go into deeper. And
[0:10] uh excuse me.
[0:13] Um this thought came by re by way of uh
[0:16] brother Andy Burton. Uh but man, ever
[0:19] since he said it, it's been just eating
[0:22] me up and just kind of saints of God,
[0:24] there's so much hope for us. You have fa
[0:28] have to faith in God.
[0:30] Uh so if we could just turn to 1
[0:32] Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[0:37] one and
[0:42] uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 1
[0:48] through3 Paul called to be an apostle of
[0:51] Jesus Christ through the will of God and
[0:54] Sathanes our brother unto the church of
[0:58] God which is at Corenth to them that are
[1:00] sanctified in Christ Jesus called to
[1:04] be
[1:06] saints with all that in every place call
[1:09] upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:12] both theirs and ours. Grace be unto you
[1:15] and peace from God our father and from
[1:18] the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's say a word
[1:21] of
[1:22] prayer. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we love
[1:25] you and Lord, you've seen my work day.
[1:28] Lord, you've seen their day. Lord, their
[1:30] workday. You've seen everything they
[1:31] went through. Lord, you've seen every
[1:34] mind battle, everything the devil was
[1:36] trying to place in their hearts, their
[1:37] minds, trying to make a nest, trying to
[1:40] focus, trying to get their minds to
[1:41] focus on
[1:42] negativity, on what they don't have or
[1:44] what they're lacking or what we would
[1:46] think we're lacking. And yet, Lord God,
[1:48] Lord, did we turn that around and look
[1:51] at what God has given us? And Lord
[1:54] Jesus, I believe Lord, if even we could
[1:56] uh even tonight after service, just
[1:58] gather around in a circle there, Lord,
[2:00] and just take out pieces of paper and
[2:01] just write the blessings uh from the
[2:04] time from the our earliest memory, Lord,
[2:06] till right now, Lord, of everything
[2:08] you've
[2:09] done. And we can acknowledge it's all
[2:11] from you, Lord. Lord God, that we would
[2:13] be here for uh days and days going back,
[2:16] Lord, rehearsing, then even giving
[2:18] testimonies and and just talking with
[2:20] one another of what all that God has
[2:22] done in our lives, Lord. And each one of
[2:23] us will have a different angle. Each one
[2:26] of us will have a different thought,
[2:28] Lord. A different battle. I've never
[2:30] seen never been on that battlefield, but
[2:32] God brought you through. Amen. And Lord,
[2:34] many Lords have never been through my
[2:35] battlefield. But Lord Jesus, you brought
[2:37] me through, Lord. And Lord Jesus, would
[2:39] you be a blessing to your wife tonight,
[2:41] God? We ask you be with us, Lord. You
[2:42] would speak through me, Lord. give me
[2:44] very thoughts and inspiration Lord God
[2:46] on these scriptures Lord on this thought
[2:48] Lord that uh you Lord or brother Andy
[2:50] Lord to place into my mind I couldn't
[2:53] get away from it Lord but I cannot take
[2:54] credit for any of this Lord but Lord we
[2:56] love you bless the people Lord bless
[2:58] your bride in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:00] amen you may be
[3:03] seated sorry I'm like coughing right
[3:05] into the mic so
[3:07] um so I was riding I was actually after
[3:10] service I was sorry after work I had to
[3:13] pick brother uh brother Daniel and
[3:17] uh the night before we were eating some
[3:22] pizza and
[3:26] uh we were talking about the original
[3:29] sin and just the power of it
[3:32] just just something about it you know I
[3:35] love baptism I was baptized in the name
[3:37] of Jesus Christ I remember when I first
[3:39] heard it that that night I had to get
[3:42] baptized I went to Lima We drove the
[3:44] line at 1:00 in the morning, got
[3:45] baptized by brother Isaiah Brooks, and
[3:47] uh then drove back, got home probably
[3:49] two or three, four, who knows when it
[3:50] was. And then went to sleep, of course.
[3:53] But uh I remember that night and
[3:58] uh just seeing all that the that God has
[4:01] revealed to us, you
[4:04] know, and one thing about the Bible, one
[4:07] thing about the message that was sent,
[4:08] you know, is uh you know, the prophet of
[4:12] God said he's he he just hit the
[4:14] highlights, right?
[4:15] And uh I I was telling my wife that uh
[4:18] you know if I was to go out outside and
[4:20] capture a bug, you know, and I could
[4:23] take that little bug in a glass. Did I
[4:24] share this? Did I say this last Sunday
[4:26] or if I could take this little bug and I
[4:28] put like a little glass
[4:29] container and uh I would say, "Hey,
[4:33] brother Malachi, what's what's in this?"
[4:34] And I would hold it like 5t away. I
[4:36] said, "Brother Malachi, what's in this
[4:37] container here? What's in this little
[4:39] glass jar?" So he could clearly see
[4:41] through and see what it is. Like what is
[4:43] that? He could he could by his own
[4:45] wisdom and and and and knowledge and
[4:46] understanding of the world around him,
[4:47] things he was seen, he could identify
[4:49] that. Oh, brother Simon, that's a
[4:51] cricket or that's a grasshopper or
[4:53] that's a ladybug or however like
[4:55] absolutely that's that's exactly right.
[4:57] Sure. Sure. Absolutely identified
[4:59] correctly. But then if I was to go and
[5:00] say if I start talking and I take that
[5:02] little bug and I put it under a
[5:05] microscope, right? I start looking at it
[5:08] under a microscope like, "Oh my
[5:09] goodness, look at the antennas. Look at
[5:11] the antennas on this thing." and you're
[5:13] brother Malachi's like what are you talk
[5:15] antenna I go how many do you think there
[5:17] is and he's like well I don't know so
[5:20] even though I'm dealing with the exact
[5:22] same thing he he could identify but it
[5:25] takes that that that microscope to go
[5:27] down and really identify and pick out
[5:29] the fine points of the exact same thing
[5:32] and saints of God we could get down to
[5:34] an electron microscope that could
[5:36] actually look at the cells of a a
[5:38] ladybug and say oh I could start talking
[5:40] about this and even do like a a a a
[5:42] genetic test on it. Now we're dealing
[5:44] with the genetics of it and how this
[5:45] ladybug is red and has little black dots
[5:47] and this one's this one, this one, that
[5:49] one. And now we're beyond what we can
[5:51] even think of, right? And that's the
[5:53] word of God. It goes to such depth,
[5:55] saints of God. God will take you as far
[5:57] as you want to go.
[5:59] He will show you things that many
[6:01] ministers will have no will know nothing
[6:03] about. Right? Because what it's not God
[6:06] is not a respector of persons. Just
[6:09] because a man uh gets behind the pulpit
[6:12] or just because a a man maybe go
[6:14] overseas or any any of the ministry that
[6:16] doesn't mean God's a respector of that.
[6:18] And now he honor he he he will use the
[6:20] gift. Okay. But remember each one of us
[6:23] most of the time like I said before many
[6:25] times I'm usually in the seats. I'm
[6:27] usually in the ley seat and saints of
[6:28] God. But God can use the gift within
[6:31] you. Right? And God if God gives you now
[6:33] remember all revelation comes from God.
[6:36] I can't give you revelation. you can't
[6:38] give me revelation anything that go
[6:39] anything anything that would quicken to
[6:41] your spirit to say ah and and the Bible
[6:44] says how he had to open the eyes of
[6:46] Lydia right and so though she could see
[6:49] the word of God that takes a revelation
[6:52] from the father himself that takes a
[6:54] revelation from God himself right so as
[6:58] I was driving and we were talking about
[7:00] original sin the very night before
[7:03] uh my mind was still thinking on it
[7:04] because I've I've studied I looked at it
[7:06] and I marveled
[7:08] And that was the avenue that was the
[7:10] very uh uh vehicle that God chose to uh
[7:13] show and bring glory to his own
[7:15] children. That that that that was the
[7:17] way he did it, right? And I thought I I
[7:20] asked him, I said, "Brother Daniel, I
[7:22] said, why why is original sin uh just so
[7:26] profound?" You know, why is that just
[7:28] something that's
[7:30] uh to me it's always been something
[7:32] that's been a just such a key to the
[7:35] Bible? something I think about actually
[7:37] almost every day. I think about those
[7:39] things. I think about uh always waiting
[7:41] for the Lord and and and I and I thought
[7:43] today and I was in fact I said, "Brother
[7:45] Daniel, what do you think about that?"
[7:46] And he said, "Oh, he went he said,
[7:47] "Well, this and that was that was the
[7:49] way God had to do it." And that was
[7:51] that's what he said. He said because
[7:52] Satan was not a creator. He could not
[7:54] create. So, he actually had to find a
[7:56] different way to fight God. And when he
[8:00] seen when Satan seen God bring forth
[8:02] children, Adam and Eve, he was like,
[8:04] "How do I how can I attack them? How can
[8:06] I get to them? How can I destroy them?"
[8:09] Right? And all these minds, he had to he
[8:11] had to, the Bible said he was full of
[8:13] wisdom and he was the sum of all wisdom
[8:14] and super intelligent uh very very
[8:17] intelligent uh being uh completely evil
[8:20] uh but intelligent uh but he found a way
[8:22] to do it, right? And God set the stage
[8:24] for that, right? We know those things.
[8:26] But then as I was thinking on this, I I
[8:28] I I said, why was this so important? But
[8:31] if you actually look after d like
[8:33] directly after the
[8:35] fall, one of the first things that God
[8:38] did when he came to Adam and Eve is he
[8:40] actually uh found them hiding. They had
[8:42] they had sewn fig leaves, right? And and
[8:45] we know that the prophet God, he said
[8:47] he'd liken that to a false religion or
[8:49] to a man-made covering, a man-made
[8:51] religion, right? And that was not the
[8:52] way. That was not what God was wanting.
[8:55] In fact, he then had to give he had to
[8:56] actually cover them with what? Lamb's
[8:59] lamb skkins skins, right? Uh w with with
[9:01] with with skins of lamb with he had to
[9:03] he had to make a sacrifice himself,
[9:05] right? And then now notice as uh as
[9:09] after after salvation, literally that
[9:11] was salvation. He he kept them. He
[9:12] covered them with his own with his a
[9:14] type of his own a shadow and type of his
[9:16] own self. Right? But one of the first
[9:18] things that he revealed to Adam and Eve
[9:22] is right here in Genesis 3.
[9:26] 14 and 15 and we see that God now is
[9:29] speaking to the serpent and he says
[9:31] because thou has done this thou art
[9:32] cursed. But look when in verse 15 and
[9:35] notice God said and I will put now not
[9:38] no doubt Adam and Eve are right there he
[9:40] says no doubt he says he says I will put
[9:43] emnity between thee and the woman and
[9:45] between thy seed and her seed. Amen. So,
[9:48] one of the first revelations, the first
[9:50] thoughts that God opened up when when
[9:53] God was dealing with the serpent. I was
[9:54] like, or the serpent, we say like that,
[9:56] uh, Adam and Eve are sitting there and
[9:58] God is literally teaching them original
[10:00] or serpent seed, right? He said, there's
[10:02] going to be a seed, a serpent seed. The
[10:05] serpent has seed. And that was one of
[10:07] the original mysteries or teachings
[10:08] right there uh uh that God revealed to
[10:10] Adam and Eve. And I said, "Well, if it
[10:12] was important for them, for God to tell
[10:14] them and reveal to them this thing, how
[10:16] much more for the bride?" Because
[10:19] remember, Christ and Eve were what? The
[10:20] shadow and or Adam and Eve were the
[10:22] shadow, a type of Christ and the bride,
[10:24] right? Amen. So, I thought that was
[10:26] interesting because that goes right back
[10:27] to the scriptures. One of the first
[10:29] things that uh God reveals to them. Now,
[10:32] now that's not the topic or the thing
[10:33] we're going for tonight, but uh uh I
[10:36] would like to teach on
[10:39] Corinthianism. Amen.
[10:42] And in this we know by by scripture we
[10:47] know by the teaching this hour John the
[10:50] John the divine when he was he was
[10:53] publishing the word of God. He was
[10:54] bringing forth the word. He was teaching
[10:56] about Jesus Christ. He was doing he was
[10:59] pastoring a church and those sort of
[11:00] things. And they what they kidnapped
[11:01] him. They they they took him and they
[11:04] tried to boil the Holy Ghost out of him.
[11:05] Right? They tried to kill him with oil
[11:07] but they could not be killed. So they
[11:08] banished him to an island, right? And
[11:10] God had to get him alone onto an island
[11:14] by himself. And because of that and God
[11:18] God knew that he had to do that. Uh so
[11:21] God allowed that to take place by God's
[11:25] grace. And uh uh we know what came out
[11:28] of that is the revelation of Jesus
[11:29] Christ. God had to get St. John set
[11:33] aside from all his pastoral duties, from
[11:36] all the duties of of going to this that
[11:38] he had to get him alone in a place where
[11:40] there was absolutely no hope. He already
[11:42] survived an assassination attempt. And
[11:44] now he's on an island. He's like, "Lord,
[11:46] what have I got here? He's there was a
[11:48] penal colony back then where the wicked
[11:50] or the worst of the worst were there.
[11:52] There was snakes there. There's all kind
[11:53] anything that everything on that island
[11:54] would kill him, right?" But God had to
[11:56] get him in a spot like that. Much like
[11:59] John the Baptist had to go in the
[12:00] wilderness. He had to pull John out
[12:02] there and to what? He had to break he
[12:04] get him to a spot where it had to just
[12:06] commune with Christ the entire time. He
[12:08] had to fully lean on Jesus Christ at
[12:10] that time. And what took place? The
[12:12] revelation of Jesus Christ. And one of
[12:15] the first mysteries, one of the first
[12:17] things we see in chapter one is what
[12:19] that that John was going to address
[12:21] these things. This is this mystery was
[12:23] to seven churches.
[12:30] I guess this kind of goes this actually
[12:31] fits right in here with this and we know
[12:34] out of those seven churches what was the
[12:36] worst
[12:38] one ledia here we are you're in this age
[12:43] is the worst of the worst right but as
[12:46] St. Paul was a forerunner before even
[12:50] John. Paul was the first church age
[12:52] messenger. He wrote the majority. He
[12:54] also wrote books to what? He seven
[12:56] churches.
[12:59] And of course, what was the one of the
[13:00] worst churches he dealt with?
[13:03] Corinthians.
[13:05] In fact, he if you look what he dealt
[13:07] with, he had he had to deal with a
[13:08] church completely out of out of line.
[13:10] Completely in disarray. Now, look what
[13:13] the prophet God says. He
[13:15] says, he says, he says, "My ne my
[13:17] ministry's never been too effective in
[13:19] America, but oh, how it goes overseas,
[13:22] Brother Moore, I say like this. I've
[13:24] I've heard many uh people who've been
[13:25] overseas preach this, this, and go to
[13:28] meetings this, uh even uh Brother Cam,
[13:30] Brother Jesse, uh uh um Brother Randy,
[13:34] Brother Brooks, they've had powerful
[13:35] meetings overseas, very very powerful
[13:37] meetings."
[13:40] He says, "Brother Bram, as hard as you
[13:42] as as hard as you preached this week, if
[13:44] that would be anywhere outside the
[13:46] United States, he says, you'd see two,
[13:48] threeund,000 souls went to Christ."
[13:50] That's right. But now you see a shocking
[13:54] see what a shocking living condition
[13:55] we're in here. Oh my. He says it's
[13:57] becoming a mass Corinthianism.
[14:00] He's called that America mass
[14:02] Corinthianism. You can go on YouTube and
[14:04] find this teacher. This one, this one
[14:06] teaches this. This one teaches this. And
[14:08] the the majority of them are all
[14:10] completely off the word, right? Why?
[14:12] Because it's got to come back to this
[14:14] this revelation.
[14:16] And God sent us a prophet. What? To give
[14:18] us the prophetic eyes and how the how
[14:21] God would reveal these things to the
[14:23] prophet and how the prophet how God used
[14:25] the prophet to see these mysteries to
[14:26] see the truths right in the scripture
[14:28] and not just just have a quote for it,
[14:30] not just have a revelation, but show it
[14:32] right in the word. In other words, the
[14:34] great thing was what? This is an
[14:35] absolute and everything we believe,
[14:37] everything we teach, everything we live
[14:39] must come back to the scripture, right?
[14:41] Sure. Back to the Bible. He said,
[14:43] "That's right. Just everything this is,
[14:44] thus, thus, and we did," he says, "We
[14:47] won't have anything to do with this or
[14:48] that. Back off and take the word,
[14:49] believe God." He says, "Poor little
[14:51] America. Feel sorry for them, for the
[14:54] hour is at hand. God can't judge just a
[14:57] just people. They've passed from
[14:58] judgment." This is, of course, 1950 585
[15:01] 57. Now,
[15:05] um, and now notice what he says here.
[15:08] 1962, he says, "We know the Corinthian
[15:10] church, Paul continually had to tell
[15:12] them. One had a psalm." He says, "One
[15:14] had a tongue, one had this, one had
[15:16] that." Why? If Paul believed in speaking
[15:18] in tongues, he didn't have to tell it to
[15:20] the Ephesians. He could teach them
[15:22] predestination and great things. But
[15:24] these babies, he had to get them baby
[15:26] food. Yet, see, he couldn't raise them
[15:28] and tell them the high things. Amen.
[15:32] He says the world is full of
[15:34] Corinthianism today. Right? So saints of
[15:37] God when we come together we should we
[15:39] should have revelations.
[15:41] Hey brother Malachi Lord the Lord showed
[15:43] me this and this and this this oh my
[15:45] goodness powerful just like brother
[15:46] Randy called me and told me about this.
[15:47] I like unbeliev There it is laying right
[15:49] there right and then it strikes and it
[15:51] just starts you feed on these things.
[15:53] You think on it you start reading a
[15:54] scripture and then wow you see the
[15:56] picture of what's being taught right of
[15:58] what God was revealed right. hope. If
[16:01] Leodysia is the worst uh uh church, is
[16:04] there even hope for Leodysa?
[16:07] Is there is there a people that could
[16:08] possibly come out of Leoa?
[16:12] Turn around. Look around. You're looking
[16:13] at them. That's right. Look at those are
[16:16] your fellow sjourers. Amen. Thank God
[16:18] that I was like the young ones here, you
[16:21] Malachi and there they are born of the
[16:24] message.
[16:26] Oh, that's a blessing. I hope you saw
[16:29] that some things this weekend, right?
[16:31] How blessed you are to
[16:33] understand
[16:36] holiness. Some of us received it a
[16:38] little bit later, but nonetheless, we
[16:39] received it. It had to come God's
[16:42] provided way. Right? Amen. So, praise
[16:45] the Lord for
[16:46] that. Now, in 1 Corinthians
[16:49] 1, Paul, I'll tell you this. If if if
[16:52] people can come out of
[16:53] Leodysa, in fact, that's the worst of
[16:56] the worst. Then how hard it would be for
[16:58] Corinthians?
[17:00] Shouldn't be any harder, right? Is it
[17:02] possible that God could show them the
[17:04] way, could bring them out of these
[17:07] things and and those sort of things?
[17:08] What? Preparing for the rapture.
[17:10] Absolutely. Sure. But now notice in 1
[17:13] Corinthians 1, notice he says, "Now I
[17:15] beseech you, brethren," in verse 10,
[17:17] "Uh, by the name of our Lord Jesus
[17:18] Christ, that ye all speak the same
[17:22] thing, and that there be no divisions
[17:25] among you, but that ye be perfectly
[17:28] joined together in the same mind and in
[17:30] the same
[17:31] judgment." That's the first thing he
[17:33] hits with a church out of complete
[17:37] disarray, completely messed up church.
[17:41] Leodysia lukewarm hot and cold a church
[17:44] that oh my goodness that what Christ is
[17:46] actually Christ was not out of this
[17:48] church the Bible doesn't say that but
[17:50] Christ is actually being kicked out of
[17:52] Leodysia
[17:54] but notice what's so important that we
[17:56] have to have the exact same
[17:59] mind and that takes what not just
[18:02] teaching but it comes it takes
[18:04] revelation from the Holy Ghost it takes
[18:06] a bornag again experience I'll say it
[18:09] like
[18:10] Because remember each one of us has our
[18:12] own ideas on this on this. But when it
[18:14] comes to the mind of Christ who is
[18:16] teaching us the hidden man within us,
[18:19] the Holy Spirit within us should be
[18:20] teaching us all the same things. Right?
[18:23] We should be able to speak the same
[18:24] things. And look at he that you all
[18:26] speak the same things and there be no
[18:28] divisions among you.
[18:32] Right. Absolutely. Should be no
[18:34] divisions. There should be we should we
[18:36] should be able to reason come together
[18:37] and reason in all things and look at
[18:39] every quote and then bring it what look
[18:40] at every scripture that that quote deals
[18:42] with right these quotes deal with now
[18:45] notice but they eB be perfectly joined
[18:48] together in the same mind and the same
[18:50] jud judgment he's hitting oneness
[18:54] he's hitting oneness in the body
[19:00] why because if you have been born again
[19:03] you are one with
[19:05] Christ and Christ is one with you. And
[19:09] if we have been born again, then we
[19:11] should start receiving the mind of
[19:13] Christ. The mind of Christ should be
[19:15] seeking down within us and revealing the
[19:18] same things. Now, each one of us are
[19:19] different ages, right? As far as uh uh
[19:21] levels of revelation, levels of
[19:23] understanding, levels levels of faith,
[19:25] right? But when it come down to like uh
[19:28] uh uh just general revelations or
[19:30] general thoughts in the scriptures, we
[19:32] should all have the same mind.
[19:36] For it has been declared unto me to you
[19:38] that, brethren, by them that are the cl
[19:40] house of Khloe, that there are
[19:42] contentions among you. There's little
[19:45] quarrels, little problems here, little
[19:47] problems there. This, this, this, what,
[19:49] and what those little quarrels are
[19:50] disagreements cause
[19:53] division. What if someone is to call you
[19:55] and well uh and start to uh bad mouthing
[20:00] the pastor, right?
[20:04] Well, what would you say? Well, brother,
[20:06] let's uh do you have a problem with
[20:07] pastor so and so or this brother this
[20:09] this and they maybe you ought to go talk
[20:12] to
[20:14] them. Maybe you should go talk to that
[20:16] brother maybe. And I'll say like this.
[20:19] Should you if you have a have a problem
[20:20] with a brother or a sister when you when
[20:23] you're supposed to go talk with them, do
[20:26] you make it an open show or do you do it
[20:28] in private? What's the Bible say? To do
[20:30] these things what? In privately.
[20:32] First you go oneon-one monoemono.
[20:36] Brother Malachi, if you don't understand
[20:38] this and this this and brother Malachi's
[20:39] like, well, brother Sai, if you don't
[20:40] understand this and this this and then
[20:42] if we can't hash it out and one of us is
[20:45] wrong or one of us is right or however,
[20:46] then the other one would bring another
[20:48] witness and say, "Hey, this this this is
[20:50] wrong." And but we're to bring these
[20:51] things in private first. And if they
[20:53] don't receive it, then the second
[20:55] time then then we make it public. Right?
[20:59] It's one of the revelations lost
[21:01] here. He says that there are contentions
[21:04] among you. The very first thing, the
[21:06] problem in this church, not this church,
[21:07] but in a church like Corinthians is
[21:10] there's division and God does not like
[21:14] division. Now notice where does division
[21:17] say come from can come with within the
[21:20] church. Look at verse 12. And this I say
[21:23] that every one of you saith, I am of
[21:25] Paul. I am of Paul and I am of Casus and
[21:27] I Christ.
[21:31] Notice within this
[21:33] church, I don't I don't even know. I'll
[21:35] be honest. I don't even know who the the
[21:37] pastor of this church
[21:39] is. But notice these people within the
[21:42] church are now putting their headship.
[21:45] They're leaning on Apollos who is the
[21:47] Bible says mighty in the scripture. Some
[21:50] were putting their weight on
[21:52] Paul. They were leaning on others
[21:55] outside their
[21:56] pastor. They're elevating. And I have
[22:00] Sorry. And I have Cphus and I have
[22:03] Christ. Look at this. All kinds of well
[22:06] well brother and so and so teaches it
[22:08] this way and well this other brother
[22:09] teaches this way and within this this
[22:11] church right here we could have three
[22:12] different ideas on the same subject
[22:14] because you're listening to this one,
[22:16] you're listening to that one, you're
[22:17] listening to this one, you're listening
[22:17] to this one and now saints of God, what
[22:19] do we do? Too much contention. But what?
[22:22] There's a pastor in the church and
[22:24] that's who we believe what God is
[22:26] speaking out through the pastor.
[22:29] Doesn't matter saints of God. If you are
[22:32] a member of this church, then brother
[22:33] Jess is your
[22:36] pastor. You know my pastor, brother,
[22:38] brother Cam Smith is my pastor. That's
[22:40] geography. That's just what this how God
[22:41] in fact brother Jesse or God God used
[22:44] brother Jesse to ordain a church over
[22:46] there. That's a powerful thing. So now
[22:50] notice is Christ divided? Was Paul
[22:53] crucified you or were you baptized in
[22:55] Paul's name? So, saints of God, we're
[22:58] not to what? Christ is our head.
[23:01] Amen. Now, look what he says. He says,
[23:04] uh, and I want to, this comes from the
[23:07] sermon I was listening to on the way
[23:08] here. When I heard
[23:11] this, and this is a key right
[23:14] here. Well, this brother sees it this
[23:16] way. And this brother, saints of God,
[23:18] there's one thing God's looking
[23:20] for. This is Christ, the mystery of God
[23:22] revealed, paragraph 303. God is known by
[23:25] simplicity and a revelation of Jesus
[23:27] Christ to the most illiterate person.
[23:29] See, not your theology. It's a
[23:31] revelation of Jesus Christ. He says,
[23:33] "Upon this rock, I'll build my church."
[23:35] No, the rocks accepted, but no other
[23:36] things accepted, no other Roman rock. He
[23:38] says, "No Protestant rock, no other
[23:40] school, no nothing but on exactly the
[23:43] revelation of Jesus Christ through the
[23:45] new birth." Literally, you have to have
[23:48] you make gota you got to make sure
[23:49] you're born again.
[23:51] He says he's born in there and he
[23:53] injects his own life and your life is
[23:55] gone.
[23:59] Do you see your life
[24:02] gone? And then all you see is Christ. He
[24:05] says he's born in there. He injects his
[24:07] own life and your life is gone. And the
[24:09] life of Christ is projecting itself
[24:11] through you with preeminences to the
[24:13] people that they may see the very life,
[24:16] works, signs and wonders that he did. He
[24:19] says is doing the same thing through
[24:23] you outside of it's like brother Malachi
[24:26] you're still working in the
[24:27] orchard. Let's say little uh brother
[24:30] Malachi is a big man now graduating
[24:34] soon. You get little Timmy junior
[24:38] freshman uh high school junior high kid
[24:40] wants to come work with you. Little
[24:42] Timmy's like uh Malachi uh I'm going to
[24:44] get this ladder. I'm going to reach
[24:45] these apples. Brother Malachi like be
[24:47] careful. Watch the ladders are a little
[24:50] dangerous, right? Little Timmy climbs up
[24:52] the stream. He falls over,
[24:56] right?
[25:01] Uh he's got to be
[25:06] careful on what he's doing. But Malachi
[25:09] is there to try to instruct him and show
[25:12] him or teach them. And what and I'll
[25:13] tell you this. He falls off and breaks
[25:15] his arm. Brother
[25:17] Malachi by the life that's in him knows
[25:19] there's a physician on the scene. He
[25:22] knows he's packing the physician. And he
[25:25] goes to little Timmy. Timmy's like, "Oh
[25:28] my arm, my arm." Malachi, "Hold peace be
[25:31] still, my brother." And he goes down
[25:33] there and says, "Brother Timmy, let's
[25:34] relax. Relax, Timmy here." And brother
[25:36] Malachi starts praying on him even in
[25:39] front of who knows other co-workers and
[25:40] this this. He starts praying on him and
[25:42] what God heals the brother right there.
[25:44] He was that young man that would be the
[25:46] very life that's coming out that's
[25:48] living in him because automatically
[25:50] brother Malachi's is he like this 911 no
[25:55] that's a thought but the racial thoughts
[25:58] like Jesus can help him and I'm packing
[26:00] the
[26:01] Lord and he does what God
[26:04] does outside of that he says he says and
[26:08] the life of Christ is projecting itself
[26:10] through you with the premises to the
[26:12] people that they see the very life
[26:14] signs, works, signs, and wonders as he
[26:15] did in the same thing through you.
[26:17] Outside of that, the rest of this is not
[26:18] even called to at all. He says, "Watch
[26:21] God's great revelation
[26:23] unfolding by lack of this revelation, we
[26:27] have so many different divisions among
[26:29] us and so much mockery."
[26:32] Saints of God, if we could get back to
[26:34] Christ and Christ alone, Christ living
[26:36] and breathing in you, you feeding Christ
[26:39] within us and he's what living his life
[26:41] fully out of you, saints of God, this is
[26:43] going to change everything because what
[26:45] what do people want? Oh, they want love.
[26:47] Sure, they want love. They want to see
[26:49] what do they want to see? They want to
[26:50] see a real living
[26:53] God. But brother said, he says this is a
[26:56] lacking of revelation. And what does
[26:58] this cause? He says that's why there's
[27:00] so many different divisions like just
[27:01] like
[27:02] Corinthians. Oh, everybody has this
[27:04] intellectual thought on this,
[27:05] intellectual thought on that, or this is
[27:07] this, I got a psalm, I got this, this
[27:09] saints of God, we need to see the life
[27:10] of Christ.
[27:14] So much division among us is because the
[27:17] people lack that revelation. See, they
[27:19] lack that revelation. He says the
[27:21] teachers,
[27:23] right?
[27:26] Absolutely. See there, there, see there
[27:28] is the gospel. He said that's the gospel
[27:30] Christ living out. I was like this if
[27:32] brother Malachi and me were well I see
[27:33] it this way and I see it that way.
[27:35] Saints of God, even if God has not
[27:37] revealed it to me and has reveal
[27:38] revealed it to him or vice versa, at the
[27:40] end of the
[27:41] day, this is my brother right here and I
[27:45] will stand with him against anyone
[27:49] to the
[27:50] end because it's it's not always we're
[27:53] even though we should be on the same
[27:55] level on many things, it's not going to
[27:57] be perfect all the time. Just like St.
[27:59] Paul says, he says, "I don't want to
[28:00] deal with Mark." And then later on in
[28:01] the ministry, he says, "Bring Mark."
[28:04] What? Paul had to catch a revelation
[28:05] that he was a valuable person in the
[28:07] ministry. Right? See now he says but
[28:10] there it is. He said the gospel. See he
[28:11] says go into all the world preach the
[28:13] gospel. He says didn't go say go teach.
[28:15] He says go preach. Demonstrate the power
[28:16] of these signs. You follow them. Just
[28:18] teaching doesn't do it. It's the actual
[28:20] spirit itself demonstrating these signs.
[28:23] Amen.
[28:27] Now discord or divisions.
[28:31] One of the six
[28:32] things that God
[28:34] hates in Psalm sorry Proverbs
[28:38] 6 verse 12. A naughty person, a wicked
[28:41] man walketh with a forward mouth. He
[28:43] winkketh with his eyes. He speaketh with
[28:44] his feet. He teacheth with his fingers.
[28:47] Forwardness is in his heart. He devisth
[28:50] mischief continually. He sweth
[28:53] discord. Saints of God, we're not here
[28:55] to divide
[28:56] anyone. And I'll say like this. uh if if
[29:01] in the deeper things I'm not talking
[29:03] about baptism or even godhead this and
[29:04] this but even deeper than those sort of
[29:06] things or however you want to say uh
[29:08] into the seals and those sort of things
[29:09] saints of
[29:10] God not everyone's going to see
[29:12] perfectly perfectly together
[29:16] right but the main thing is we can keep
[29:19] the presence of God among us real divine
[29:23] love displayed between us right because
[29:26] what at the end God's gonna God's going
[29:28] to sort it all on these sort of
[29:30] things. So notice, therefore shall his
[29:33] calamity come suddenly, suddenly there
[29:35] shall be broken without remedy. These
[29:37] six things does the Lord hate. Yay,
[29:39] seven are an abomination to him. a proud
[29:42] look, a lying tongue, hands that shed
[29:44] innocent blood, a heart that devises
[29:46] wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
[29:48] to running to to to mischief, a false
[29:51] witness that speaketh lies, and he that
[29:52] sowed discord among the
[29:59] brethren. So if uh once again, me and uh
[30:02] let's say me and sister case have a
[30:04] disagreement on something. I say I call
[30:07] up brother Malachi. Malachi case just
[30:10] doesn't understand this thing. You know
[30:11] what I mean? You know what I mean? She's
[30:13] just a girl. Wait, sorry. She's just a
[30:15] young woman. She's not She's not a
[30:17] revelated. Now I'm sewing discord
[30:19] between in their own household between
[30:21] brother and sister.
[30:27] And God hates that.
[30:31] Amen.
[30:33] Now he says now presuming 62 he says
[30:36] that's what we did when the revival
[30:38] started about 14 years ago. Pentecost
[30:40] found out she couldn't stretch herself
[30:41] no further further because she'd
[30:43] organized into little groups and hated
[30:45] one another. So that swed that discord
[30:48] among the brethren and the revival
[30:51] struck it and the evening come in. But
[30:53] what did she do? She couldn't do nothing
[30:55] because she'd organized. She'd lost her
[30:57] strength, her brotherly love, the fruits
[30:59] of the
[31:00] spirit. That discord will run the spirit
[31:03] of God right out. And that was the first
[31:06] thing, the first problem the Holy Spirit
[31:09] uh addressed through St. Paul to the
[31:12] Corinthians. Now
[31:16] notice, let's just I'm just going to hit
[31:18] this quote right here. Hebrews uh
[31:21] chapter 7 number two 57. And you people
[31:25] with those sawblade tempers that's
[31:27] always spouting off in the mouth at
[31:29] somebody can't be put and things like
[31:31] that, be careful. You're guilty if you
[31:34] speak a word against your
[31:37] brother. You're guilty if you speak one
[31:40] thing against your brother or
[31:43] sister. Now, why is that?
[31:47] because of this brother right here or
[31:49] this sister right here or this these
[31:51] saints right here or that if you have
[31:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost within
[31:56] you, you're not just dealing with the
[31:58] people because the Bible says if you're
[32:01] born of the flesh, you are flesh. But if
[32:04] you're born of the spirit, you
[32:06] are now I'm speaking bad against a
[32:09] spiritual person, against a spirit, not
[32:12] not flesh. Notice the holy Jesus did not
[32:14] even recognize your flesh after you're
[32:15] born again. He says he that is spirit is
[32:18] spirit and
[32:21] flesh. Spirit alone. You become you. So
[32:25] see that's why you're a new creature.
[32:26] You are a spiritual being when you're
[32:28] born
[32:30] again. You're not dealing with the flesh
[32:32] there. See something in their flesh may
[32:34] have anointed you. Something in their
[32:36] flesh may have done something wrong to
[32:37] you. But saints of God, if they're born
[32:39] again, they are spirit. And you better
[32:42] be careful.
[32:44] I've seen a lot of this go on
[32:47] recently. You're guilty. You speak one
[32:49] word against your brother. That's not
[32:51] that's not
[32:53] right. Not that you justify in yourself.
[32:55] Not you're justifying your heart. Uh not
[32:58] just go around and tear it down. He says
[33:00] you don't have to stick a knife in a
[33:02] man's back to kill him. You can break
[33:03] his character and kill him. Kill his
[33:07] influence.
[33:08] He says, "Speak against your pastor
[33:10] here. Say something bad about him, you
[33:13] might as well just shot
[33:17] him right from here." Because remember
[33:20] your word, the Bible says what? If you
[33:22] speak the word of God, it's a
[33:24] double-edged sword. And it's what these
[33:26] you're dealing with a the most powerful
[33:28] force in the world right here. Your
[33:30] words because out of them will either go
[33:32] life or death.
[33:40] told something that wasn't right about
[33:41] him. Well, it'll kill his influence with
[33:44] the people and things like that. And
[33:45] you're guilty of
[33:47] that. What Jesus
[33:50] said, writing the Corinthian
[33:56] church. One thing I
[33:59] like, well, I'm going to skip that back.
[34:02] Now, let me keep jumping
[34:05] here.
[34:12] In is 1 Corinthians
[34:15] 2, St. Paul starts dealing
[34:18] with spiritual men and carnal
[34:22] men. He says, "But God has revealed them
[34:24] to unto unto us by his spirit. For the
[34:27] spirit searchth all things, yay, the
[34:30] deep things of God.
[34:33] So if you are Holy Ghost filled, your
[34:35] mind, God should eventually somehow in
[34:38] time or due season or however when when
[34:40] there's deep things being taught, deep
[34:42] things being preached, you should be
[34:44] like hungering for that. Yes, that was
[34:46] for me. And then your alone time, you
[34:49] start having deep thoughts about the
[34:51] word of God. You start having things
[34:53] you're wondering about the word and the
[34:54] the future home and this and that and
[34:57] original sin or or the depths of the
[34:59] godhead and the logos and all those
[35:01] things of God that the Holy Ghost will
[35:03] lead you to the depths. Did he say he's
[35:06] going to leave you as a shallow baby
[35:07] feeding you milk? No. He's going to give
[35:09] you meat
[35:11] because wherever the eagles are
[35:14] gathered, there will the carcass be.
[35:15] What is the carcass? The word of God.
[35:22] He he says, he says, "For what man
[35:24] knoweth the things of a man, but save
[35:26] the spirit of man which is in him? Even
[35:28] so the things of God knoweth no man but
[35:31] the spirit of God." So if you want to
[35:33] know the things of God, you need the
[35:34] spirit of God within you. Now we have
[35:37] received not the spirit of the world but
[35:38] the spirit which is of God that we might
[35:40] know the things that are freely given uh
[35:42] to to us of God which things we also
[35:45] speak in the words which man's wis not
[35:47] not in words which man's wisdom teaches
[35:49] but what the Holy Ghost teaches
[35:50] comparing spiritual things with
[35:52] spiritual that's that's the very
[35:54] important part right there you can't and
[35:56] I'll say this even with dealing with the
[35:57] quotes of the prophet well the prophet
[36:00] said this was that the flesh of the
[36:02] prophet was that his idea or was that
[36:04] the mind of Christ
[36:06] that takes
[36:09] discernment. Will you see what a
[36:11] prophecy from
[36:13] 1954 when that new pope that new pope
[36:16] comes out of America, the United
[36:19] States? We've heard that before, but
[36:21] man, is that going to happen? Was that
[36:23] thus sayith the Lord or not? Well, here
[36:25] we go.
[36:27] In fact, the sister just told me I said
[36:29] uh uh three weeks ago I was at their
[36:31] house and she's like, "Brother Simon, I
[36:33] was telling everybody I was telling
[36:34] everybody that the pope's come out of
[36:35] America. The pope's come out of
[36:36] America." The quote I said, "Well, hold
[36:38] on, sister. She he never said thus
[36:39] sayith the Lord." She's like, "Oh, oh my
[36:40] goodness. Maybe I shouldn't have said."
[36:41] I was like, "I don't know. I just didn't
[36:44] see thus say the Lord." Well, come to
[36:45] find out. Here we are.
[36:50] That must have been obviously the Holy
[36:52] Spirit speaking out of the prophet.
[36:57] But I wasn't too quick to jump on that
[37:02] wagon. I'll never forget when brother
[37:04] Jesse was making a video
[37:06] on Kla Harris in the purple
[37:10] dress. Thus say that's it, brother.
[37:12] She's the one. She's the vice president.
[37:14] She's dressed in purple. This this
[37:16] brother Justin's like, "Well, I never
[37:18] forget. I watched that video." He's
[37:19] like, "Well, he never said thus say the
[37:22] Lord." So, let's just hold back. Wait
[37:23] and see.
[37:25] come and gone. She's out the door. That
[37:29] wasn't it.
[37:31] Now it's looking like it could be just
[37:33] the Catholic
[37:35] Church. See how See what you got to take
[37:37] spiritual things. You got to weigh
[37:39] everything through the word. Brother
[37:42] himself himself he said he said when
[37:43] it's thus say the Lord he says then it's
[37:45] the Lord. He he said a lot of this is
[37:48] me.
[37:49] Amen. Now, but notice in verse 14, he
[37:51] said, "But the natural man receiveth not
[37:53] the things of the spirit of God." See, I
[37:56] marvel. I
[37:58] marvel. I just marvel so much when the
[38:02] things that we have received and you
[38:05] share them with people and that light
[38:07] strikes down and nothing comes back.
[38:13] How many How many people have you have
[38:14] we witnessed about baptism? brother, you
[38:17] need to get baptized. Or sister or lady,
[38:18] you ever hear about baptis name Jesus
[38:19] Christ? Like uh you know really doesn't
[38:22] matter.
[38:24] But as soon as I heard it, once that
[38:26] light flashed upon us, he what it it
[38:30] struck that seed and it started to
[38:32] quicken and grow.
[38:35] See that that's the and it might not be
[38:37] their predestinated moment. Might not be
[38:38] their pred predestinated time, but
[38:40] saints of God, why doesn't this thing
[38:42] should start clicking? You know,
[38:46] this should click something strike
[38:48] home. He says, "But the natural man
[38:50] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[38:51] of God, for they are foolishness unto
[38:53] him." They're foolishness. Well, you
[38:54] know, what does it matter? God knows my
[38:57] heart. Neither can he know them, for
[38:59] they are spiritually
[39:02] discerned. Look what he's working with
[39:04] those Corinthians. Notice he continues
[39:07] on in chapter 3, 1 Corinthians 3:1. And
[39:10] I brethren could not speak unto you as
[39:12] spiritual but as unto carnal as even
[39:14] unto babes in Christ. So St. Paul says
[39:16] he says I can't even deal with the deep
[39:17] things right now. Right now in this
[39:19] letter I'm writing about carnality.
[39:21] There's divisions. There's divisions.
[39:22] There there's discord. There's this one
[39:25] saying this this one saying that. No one
[39:26] can agree on anything. This place is a
[39:27] complete mess.
[39:33] So he to teach
[39:34] them. He said, "You've got to compare
[39:37] spiritual things with spiritual." You've
[39:39] got to com because remember Jesus what
[39:41] the words that I speak are spirit and
[39:42] our life. If we want our ideas or
[39:45] thoughts on this, we've got to look at
[39:47] this scripture, this, this, this, and
[39:49] saints of God, it'll ring true in there.
[39:52] He says, now notice verse three, I have
[39:54] fed you with milk and not with meat. For
[39:56] where uh thereto you were a not able to
[39:59] bear, and neither you are able to now,
[40:02] for ye are yet carnal. For whereas there
[40:04] is among you envying and strife and
[40:06] divisions, are you not carnal and walk
[40:08] as men? So much carnality. These people
[40:11] were living in the
[40:17] flesh. Here I'm at service Wednesday
[40:21] night. Praise the Lord. Man, I wish I
[40:24] could play like brother
[40:27] Malachi. Man, he's so gifted. Kind of
[40:31] jealous of you guys.
[40:35] What a loser.
[40:38] See, that's carnality.
[40:41] But when we come in here, man, it's
[40:43] Wednesday night. My brothers, my nephew
[40:45] is playing
[40:47] tonight. I got to I got to watch him
[40:49] when he had little bug eyes, big eyes,
[40:50] and he was just here, wait, right? I got
[40:53] to watch now. He's playing. He's leading
[40:55] songs for the bride of Christ. He's
[40:58] singing for the bride of Christ. And
[41:00] what do I want to do? I don't want to I
[41:02] want to say let's enter to worship. We
[41:04] are here to praise the king. Amen. And
[41:07] saints of God and he's what that's a
[41:09] sacrifice unto the Lord. Does he have to
[41:13] uh brother Malai? You know I want you to
[41:14] play. He's like you know I I really
[41:16] don't want to do it tonight. I you know
[41:18] I'm not just I don't want to be just
[41:20] used for my talents and this and this
[41:21] and I'm He willingly like a lamb a sheep
[41:26] willingly lays down his own
[41:29] rights because he has rights. She has a
[41:31] choice. No, Dad. I'm not playing
[41:40] tonight. You have to lay down your
[41:42] life for others. He doesn't do that for
[41:45] himself. He's not up here magnifying
[41:46] himself. He's doing it what? For
[41:51] you. He says, "Are there not strife and
[41:55] divisions? Are you not carnal? Walk as
[41:56] men? For while one saith, I am Paul and
[41:59] another saying, "Am I Paul? Are you not
[42:01] carnal?" Look, he goes back to
[42:03] that. Well, brother Jessica, God, bless
[42:05] you. Brother Jess is my pastor. And but
[42:08] you know, I like how brother Malachi
[42:10] sees it on this different angle, too,
[42:12] you know, but I think I kind of lean
[42:13] towards Brother Malachi's version of,
[42:14] you know, saints of
[42:16] God. If our pastor can take it back to
[42:18] the word, and that's the right way. It's
[42:20] got to go back to the
[42:23] scripture. Now look what he says here.
[42:26] For for a while one saith I am a Paul
[42:28] and another I'm Apollos. He says are you
[42:30] not
[42:31] carnal? Who then is Paul and who's
[42:34] Apollos? But ministers by whom you
[42:35] believed even as the Lord gave unto man
[42:37] saints of God. Every person is what?
[42:40] Given to you sister Naomi is given to us
[42:43] by who? The Lord. The Lord brought her
[42:45] here. The the children were brought here
[42:47] by God. You sister Z was brought here by
[42:50] the Lord. Brought back to the word and
[42:51] and all those sorts of things of God.
[42:53] It's for each other. We're to what? Pull
[42:55] off our strength.
[42:59] What if the only ones that showed
[43:00] tonight were Aacia and Malachi? I just
[43:03] had to focus because you showed up.
[43:05] Because you showed up. What? It gives
[43:07] strength with there's there is strength
[43:08] with numbers, saints of God. I could
[43:11] back here you guys are singing and you
[43:12] it was it was a loud noise. Why? Because
[43:14] with what the Bible says what a
[43:16] three-fold cord is not easily broken
[43:19] instead of a one or two but a three.
[43:20] Saints of God, wherever two or three I
[43:22] am in the mid, there are in the midst,
[43:23] there I am in the midst. Right? Wherever
[43:24] three are gathered, there I am in the
[43:26] midst. Right? Saints of God, all we have
[43:28] to do, it doesn't say you have to pray.
[43:29] He says, where two or three are
[43:30] gathered, you just got to show up and
[43:32] he's there. He's protecting his wife.
[43:35] He's with his wife is with his
[43:38] bride. He says, "I have planted
[43:40] Apollos's water, but God gave the
[43:43] increase." We're just up here laboring.
[43:46] He's laboring. We're laboring. your
[43:48] laboring and worship. But what it takes
[43:49] God to give the increase. No glory can
[43:52] come to anyone. It is glory to God, the
[43:55] Lord Jesus Christ or doesn't go
[43:56] anywhere. It's to him. Everything must
[43:59] go to him
[44:01] because he's done it. But God gave the
[44:04] increase. So then neither is he that
[44:06] planteth
[44:07] anything. Why do a lot of Bible studies?
[44:10] Means nothing. He says neither he that
[44:12] waters. Someone's come to preach and
[44:14] brings what? The power of God down.
[44:15] Listen to this. And the anointing comes
[44:17] down. all things God, but God that
[44:19] giveth the
[44:21] increase. Everything of Christ, Christ
[44:23] chooses, Jesus chooses to either bless
[44:26] it or not, or just leave his hands off
[44:27] of
[44:30] it. Now, he that planteth he that watth
[44:33] or one, and every man shall receive his
[44:34] own reward according to his own labor.
[44:36] Right? Now,
[44:38] notice, I'm going to I'm going to uh in
[44:41] chapter 3 again, 1 Corinthians 3, St.
[44:44] Paul warns the Corinthians. What he say?
[44:47] He says, "I have laid the foundation as
[44:48] a wise master
[44:50] builder." This this original word here
[44:52] come this fresh word coming to you. God
[44:54] allowed me to lay this down to build
[44:56] this foundation. And what does he tell
[44:59] you? He says, "Be careful how how you
[45:01] build on
[45:03] this. Be careful how you build. Be
[45:06] careful how you teach this. Be careful
[45:08] how you interpret this. Be careful how
[45:11] you think about this word." Why? because
[45:14] he says for no foundation can another
[45:17] way. I don't I think Paul was wrong
[45:18] here. No, Paul said in Corinthians he
[45:20] said also he said he said Jesus Christ
[45:21] will come and judge. He's a judge by my
[45:24] gospel. The foundation is set saints.
[45:27] How have we built on it? How have we
[45:30] thought it? He says now if any man build
[45:32] upon this foundation gold, he says
[45:35] silver, precious stone, wood, hay,
[45:37] stubble, every man's work shall be made
[45:40] manifest.
[45:42] That's scary thing. It is scary to what?
[45:44] Fall into the hands of a angry God or to
[45:46] the living God.
[45:50] I was like this. It's one thing when
[45:51] brother Ram approached the angel, but
[45:53] when he came in the presence of God, he
[45:55] passed out. Passed out. Saw Christ
[46:00] twice. Couldn't take it. He's standing
[46:03] sideways. As soon as he turned to him,
[46:04] he's out. Look at John Revelations one.
[46:08] He says, he says, "And he fell as one
[46:09] dead before
[46:11] Christ." We're talking about the
[46:13] Almighty God. He says, "For every man's
[46:16] work will be made manifest, for the day
[46:18] shall declare it, because it shall be
[46:20] revealed by fire." He says, "And every
[46:22] man's work of what sort it is. If any
[46:25] man's work abide which heath built
[46:26] thereon, he shall receive a reward." So
[46:29] saints of God, if you if especially
[46:31] sister Naomi right here has children, if
[46:34] she builds these children up with the
[46:37] word of God, she doesn't even have to.
[46:40] Brother said, "What? She's the uh was it
[46:42] the six-fold in the house? She teaches
[46:45] she has more time with these children
[46:46] than anyone has." Even Pastor Jesse or
[46:48] any of the ministers, if she builds the
[46:51] word of right of God right with these
[46:53] children, raises them, trains them up in
[46:55] the admonition of the Lord and she does
[46:56] it correctly, there's a rewards come
[46:58] with that. Just the same as a minister,
[47:01] as a wife with with your husband and and
[47:04] how you build and this you display
[47:05] yourself, your character, how you speak
[47:07] uh with meekness and all sorts. Thanks
[47:09] to God, if she does that right, there's
[47:11] a reward coming.
[47:16] He says, "If any man's work shall be
[47:17] burned, he shall suffer loss. But by he
[47:19] himself shall be saved. So as by
[47:22] fire." Now notice he hit all that. And
[47:26] then chapter
[47:28] five, look what he hits. 1 Corinthians
[47:32] 5:1. It is reported commonly that there
[47:34] is no that there is fornication among
[47:38] you. Wait a second. He hit division and
[47:42] contention and strife and envy and oh,
[47:45] I'm of this and I'm of that before this
[47:47] sin.
[47:51] Why? Because one is a spiritual
[47:54] sin. This one's made manifest in flesh.
[47:56] That's obvious. But now it takes the
[47:58] Holy Ghost to discern what's going on
[48:00] here. And St. Paul said he only had to
[48:02] hear a rumor of it. And then what? The
[48:04] Holy Ghost within him started dialing in
[48:05] and says this, this, this, this, this,
[48:07] this.
[48:09] But he hit dis he he he hit contention
[48:12] he get division before
[48:14] this and such fornication is not so much
[48:18] as named among the Gentiles that one
[48:19] should have his father's wife. He says
[48:22] and ye are puffed up and not rather
[48:24] mourned. He says, "But you have done
[48:26] this deed, but he that done this deed
[48:28] has been taken away uh might be taken
[48:30] away from among you. For I verily as
[48:33] present as present in body, but uh
[48:35] absent body, but present in spirit have
[48:37] judged already as though I were present
[48:39] concerning him that does such this deed.
[48:41] In the in the name of our Lord Jesus
[48:42] Christ, when you gather together when ye
[48:44] gather together in my spirit and with
[48:47] the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to
[48:48] deliver such as one unto Satan for the
[48:51] destruction of his flesh, that the
[48:52] spirit may be saved in the day of the
[48:54] Lord Jesus. Your gloring is not good.
[48:58] Need know ye not that a little leaven
[49:00] leavenventh the whole lump?
[49:08] Notice they were g they weren't even
[49:10] ashamed of
[49:11] that. You know why? Because there was
[49:13] probably some people that actually sided
[49:15] with
[49:16] them. Well, I you know I don't I can't
[49:18] find these you know I I don't know the
[49:20] scripture that well, but I'm sure
[49:21] there's I'm sure it's probably
[49:23] okay. Well, no, no, brother. There's
[49:26] there's Old Testament things that that
[49:28] strictly prohibits that.
[49:31] Well, you know, is it very specific? is
[49:32] a truly written like word all like
[49:35] completely flatout word. Is there
[49:36] anything for that? So there's even
[49:38] probably has a division on that because
[49:39] some were puffed up on it. Hey brother.
[49:42] Oh hey sister so and so. How's your uh
[49:45] dad's? But
[49:51] no. Purge you therefore with the old
[49:53] tent leaven that you be new lump as ye
[49:55] are unleavened. For even Christ our
[49:57] passover is sacrificed for us. Look what
[50:00] he hits here.
[50:02] And then so notice he deals with
[50:04] fornication right in the church. What is
[50:06] going on here? But there's divisions the
[50:08] worst. This is
[50:10] bad. Now notice what are the what are
[50:12] these most what what are the problems
[50:13] he's dealing with? Is he dealing with
[50:15] problems in the church of Corinthians
[50:17] from the things that are happening
[50:20] outside? All their problems are eternal
[50:23] internal problems. All their problems
[50:26] have to do with brothers in the church.
[50:29] Brother and sister in the church.
[50:31] brother and sister in church or sister
[50:32] and sister in church because notice what
[50:34] he goes to next here in chapter six.
[50:37] Dare any of you having a matter against
[50:39] another go to law before the unjust and
[50:42] not before the saints between you cells?
[50:45] Me and brother Malachi. Brother Mali, I
[50:47] got this business to you I want to do
[50:48] with you. I need only $5,000 of your
[50:50] cash and we can make this thing work and
[50:52] this and this. And Malachi's like,
[50:53] "Sure, brother. I trust you. You're my
[50:55] uncle. Gives me a check for this this."
[50:56] I go and wager it on something else or
[50:58] invest in this. I lost it all.
[51:03] Malai, I'm
[51:05] sorry. Mali's like, "That was $5,000,
[51:08] bro." Uncles. Uncle, he's like, "Got me
[51:12] by the
[51:15] neck." And he calls the popo. He's
[51:17] calling the popo on me, right? No.
[51:19] What's he supposed to do? Go before you?
[51:22] He's supposed to first of all deal with
[51:23] me again. Go before you. Say,
[51:26] "Hey, let's come in." Bible says
[51:28] actually grab the least that's that's
[51:31] respected as least in the church or the
[51:32] what someone would think would be the
[51:34] least in the church and have them
[51:38] judge. Brother, tell me your story
[51:40] again. I gave Uncle Simon $5,000 invest
[51:44] and he lost it. I think I need
[51:46] retribution. Well, brother assim. Yeah.
[51:48] Yeah, but you know it's all risk. You
[51:49] know, business is risky,
[51:53] right? You should be able to judge
[51:55] between me and him.
[51:57] [Laughter]
[51:58] We should settle this not in the
[52:00] people's court, but in the bride's
[52:02] court.
[52:05] I don't know if you know what the
[52:06] people's court is. Anyhow,
[52:08] now he says, "Go to law before the just
[52:10] before the saints. Know ye not that the
[52:12] saints shall judge the world?" You're
[52:14] going to judge those you've lived with.
[52:17] You're going to be judging people you
[52:18] never even met before by what is flashed
[52:21] upon that great screen of their lives.
[52:23] Right? He says, "And if the the world
[52:25] shall be judged by you, are you unworthy
[52:27] to judge the smallest
[52:30] matters?" Well, Uncle Simon lost $500.
[52:33] Not five grand, 500. Maybe it was $50. I
[52:36] still lost it. And I should be saints of
[52:40] God. The the smallest things. Can we
[52:43] weigh? Can weigh the smallest things? Do
[52:45] we have the ability in the spirit to to
[52:47] judge between right and wrong or the
[52:49] smallest
[52:50] things? Just like Solomon. Two harlots
[52:53] come up. One baby died. The other one,
[52:55] they're both pleading their case. That's
[52:57] my baby. That's my baby. Solomon's
[52:59] looking at
[53:00] him. The real
[53:02] mother would love that baby and we give
[53:06] everything for it. Sama says, "Bring me
[53:08] a
[53:10] sword." Grabs the baby. In fact, when I
[53:12] were a little child, uh my mama had a
[53:14] little child's uh picture book and they
[53:17] showed Solomon with the baby. hang that
[53:21] baby up upside down by one leg and he
[53:23] was ready to chop it in half. He hung
[53:25] that baby upside down in that picture
[53:26] and I was like pretty extreme. Guess
[53:29] what? That that got I've never forgotten
[53:31] that. But look how he just grabbed What
[53:34] if that really took place? We don't
[53:36] know. What if he just grabbed that baby
[53:38] by one leg? Baby starts crying. The real
[53:41] mother's like, "Don't you touch my
[53:42] right?" And he says, "Cut discernment.
[53:45] The smallest things."
[53:48] Now, let's continue on here because I
[53:50] don't want to wait too long. In chapter
[53:51] 7, 1 Corinthians
[53:53] 7. The Bible talks about uh marriage and
[53:57] divorce. Notice how St. Paul's working
[54:00] these things. He's getting division out.
[54:03] He's getting sin out. Now, he's dealing
[54:05] with the biggest thing that needed
[54:07] answer in this day and
[54:08] age. Oh, this brother's been married
[54:10] three times. This brother's been married
[54:11] two times. This this brother man was up
[54:14] on the mountain and God revealed
[54:17] it and yet the Bible the Bible has been
[54:20] here for 2,000
[54:21] years and people still did not
[54:23] understand marriage or divorce even
[54:25] though it's in 1 Corinthians
[54:27] 7. What was the
[54:29] revelation? The Bible says a woman once
[54:32] married cannot be remarried if she leave
[54:33] her husband. A man cannot be remarried
[54:36] if the if the husband and wife separate
[54:39] or divorce. The husband cannot remarry
[54:42] save for fornication. That's
[54:46] it. Other than that, they have to remain
[54:48] single the rest of their lives. Right?
[54:50] Simple. That's
[54:51] scriptural. And yet, even in the sermon,
[54:53] people are getting messed up in that
[54:55] sermon. Now, chapter
[55:00] nine, 1 Corinthians
[55:03] 9, what does Paul hit here? Paul hits
[55:07] how he's a worker for the for for God.
[55:11] He says, "Am I not an apostle? Am I not
[55:15] free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our
[55:17] Lord? And yet ye and not and are not yet
[55:21] ye my work in the Lord?" He says, "Have
[55:24] I not I begotten you?" In the in in the
[55:26] scripture and he goes on and talks about
[55:28] how he says, "Do not I have power to
[55:30] lead about a sister as a wife? I have
[55:32] the right to get married. I have a right
[55:34] to do this. I have a right to do He
[55:35] says, "But I've laid down my
[55:37] life for everything else. I've given
[55:39] up." In other words, I've given up. I've
[55:41] surrendered all my
[55:43] rights. So, notice he's dealing with the
[55:45] Corinthian church. He's being an
[55:47] example, right? So, between all of us
[55:49] right
[55:50] here, well, I've got I've got a right to
[55:52] do this. I've got saints of God, we
[55:55] surrender all of our rights.
[55:59] If this sister or this sister needs
[56:01] something and you're busy that day and
[56:03] you have to do something of your own,
[56:04] saints of God, surrender your rights.
[56:07] Well, my stuff's more important. Saints
[56:09] of God, if a little one or a sister
[56:12] who's doesn't have as much
[56:15] muscularity,
[56:17] vascularity, height, stature,
[56:19] strength, then brother
[56:22] Malachi, this sister's
[56:24] moving. But Malachi's like, "Well, I got
[56:27] to go shoot guns today." in my big truck
[56:29] carrying my all my guns in my big truck
[56:31] to the shooting
[56:33] range and the sister needs to move. He
[56:36] lays down all his rights and goes help
[56:38] the sister move because St. Paul was ex
[56:41] He says follow me as I follow Christ.
[56:43] What my What about my life? What? It is
[56:46] gone. Your life is gone. But because I
[56:49] died, you died a long time
[56:51] ago. When you receive salvation, saints,
[56:54] you and when you've been born again,
[56:57] you're no longer flesh. These flesh have
[56:58] no this flesh has no more rights. You're
[57:00] now a spiritual what? Worker of Christ.
[57:03] You're a spiritual tool of Christ. And
[57:05] you lay down your rights because what?
[57:07] If the spirit of God within you that the
[57:10] same one that was in him, he laid down
[57:11] his rights. He became a lamb. He became
[57:13] He followed the dove. He became a lamb
[57:16] and laid down all his rights. What? To
[57:17] save others. To live his life for
[57:20] others. Amen. Now notice he's talking
[57:25] about them giving up your things.
[57:28] He even says in uh 1 Corinthians 9:11,
[57:31] "If we have sown unto you spiritual
[57:33] things, is it a great thing if we have
[57:34] reap your carnal things?" In other
[57:35] words, take tithing, takes offerings.
[57:37] But even St. Paul said, he says, "I
[57:38] don't even do that. I don't even take
[57:41] anything from
[57:43] you." Why? Because he doesn't want to be
[57:45] a burden to
[57:46] them. Well, they are to give the pastor
[57:48] a salary. Why do you have to give Paul
[57:50] St. Paul? Don't give don't give me
[57:52] nothing. I'm I'm
[57:55] good. Now, let's continue. What is St.
[57:58] What is the Holy Ghost doing for St.
[57:59] Paul right here? He's trying to get this
[58:03] church in order. And he's teaching that
[58:06] church, he's telling that church how to
[58:09] get in order because he's leading up to
[58:14] something. The worst church out of the
[58:17] book of Acts, seven churches,
[58:19] Corinthians was the
[58:20] worst. Galatians was bewitched, but the
[58:23] Corinthians all messed up.
[58:26] But notice how the spirit of God leading
[58:29] like a like a like a father leading the
[58:31] child. Come here. Quit doing this. Quit
[58:34] doing this. Stop. Stop. Stop. No.
[58:36] No. Come here. Okay. Do it this way. Do
[58:40] this. Do this way. He's bringing this
[58:42] bride. He's bring He's dealing with this
[58:44] young woman, this young church, and
[58:46] saying, "No, you're supposed to act like
[58:48] this. Act like a bride. Act like a lady
[58:51] instead of a worldly one. Not carnal.
[58:55] 1 Corinthians 10, he's dealing, he's
[58:58] warning against
[59:03] idolers. So stay away from adultery,
[59:05] right? Idolatry.
[59:08] Now in 1 Corinthians 10, he also says,
[59:10] "All things are lawful for me, but all
[59:13] things are not expedient. All things are
[59:15] lawful, but not all things
[59:17] edify." Praise God. You have rights to
[59:19] do. You're an American. America, right?
[59:22] You can go, you can go do this on
[59:23] Saturday, you can do this on Friday, you
[59:25] go out to eat on Thursday night, you can
[59:26] go, you can do whatever you want as long
[59:28] as I give you funds and you have free
[59:30] time. But what if God wants you to
[59:34] pray on Wednesday nights when the church
[59:38] doors are open? Should not we have a
[59:40] desire to go to
[59:41] church and what? fellowship with one
[59:43] another in the
[59:45] word, in singing and praise and worship
[59:48] and hearing these things, saints of God.
[59:50] We lay down our
[59:53] rights. Now, 1 Corinthians
[59:57] 11, he says, "Be ye followers of me even
[1:00:00] as I am of
[1:00:02] Christ." And what does he do in this
[1:00:04] chapter? He start dealing with
[1:00:07] headship. He know the problem. He says,
[1:00:09] "Women, you got to let them let that
[1:00:11] hair grow.
[1:00:13] He said that hair was given for a
[1:00:14] covering. Brothers, you hippies, you
[1:00:17] bike riders, hurry guys, cut the hair,
[1:00:21] keep her trimmed. He said because these
[1:00:23] outward appearances mean something. Hair
[1:00:26] and dress, sanctification, don't look
[1:00:28] like the world. Whatever the world's
[1:00:30] doing, do the opposite of that. Be holy,
[1:00:32] undefiled, be separate people unto
[1:00:37] God. What's he doing? He's cleaning them
[1:00:41] up.
[1:00:43] Look what it says here at the end of 1
[1:00:45] Corinthians 11. What does he get?
[1:00:48] Communion. Take, eat. This is this is
[1:00:51] this cup is the blood of the New
[1:00:54] Testament. Why? Take the unleavened
[1:00:57] bread. Do the feet
[1:00:59] washing. But there that's a very
[1:01:01] dangerous spot here. That's one of the
[1:01:04] most important. I I taught that a while
[1:01:05] back. That was literally the last second
[1:01:09] to last thing be before the rapture the
[1:01:12] as far as the cut
[1:01:14] off Corinth as I communion will show who
[1:01:18] you are. If there's sin in your life,
[1:01:20] communion will show
[1:01:24] it. Wherefore, whosoever should eat this
[1:01:26] bread and drink of this cup unworthily
[1:01:28] shall be guilty of the blood, the body
[1:01:31] and blood of the Lord. But a land let a
[1:01:34] man examine himself so that he him eat
[1:01:36] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[1:01:38] he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[1:01:41] eateth and drinkketh damnation to
[1:01:43] himself, not discerning the Lord's
[1:01:45] body. That was taking place the entire
[1:01:48] time because there's envyings and and
[1:01:51] discord and divisions. What? Against the
[1:01:53] Lord's body because you're the Lord's
[1:01:56] body. You're the Lord's body. You're the
[1:01:58] Lord's body. You're you are the body of
[1:02:00] Christ. You know why that place was all
[1:02:02] messed up? Because they're right here.
[1:02:05] They did not discern the Lord's body.
[1:02:07] There actually is a curse that comes
[1:02:08] with
[1:02:10] this. Now, here's a here's a revelation
[1:02:13] with
[1:02:14] this. But St. Paul, I'm sorry, saw he
[1:02:18] was riding the horse, right? Coming to
[1:02:19] Damascus, and the light shone down from
[1:02:21] heaven, knocked him off his horse. He
[1:02:23] saw the light. He said, "And what did
[1:02:27] Jesus say? It is hard for you to kick
[1:02:29] against the
[1:02:32] pricks." And Paul, St. Paul said, "Lord,
[1:02:35] who are
[1:02:36] you?" And he says, "I am
[1:02:39] Jesus," right? Look at look at
[1:02:42] this. Let's just say this. For this
[1:02:45] cause, many are weak and sickly among
[1:02:47] you and many
[1:02:48] sleep. You know why people get sick that
[1:02:51] are
[1:02:53] Christians? Have they discerned the body
[1:02:55] of Christ correctly?
[1:02:57] Correctly. Because this is one of the
[1:03:00] signs they have not judged correctly.
[1:03:02] They have taken
[1:03:04] communion
[1:03:05] unworthily. There's still sin in their
[1:03:08] life. They backed this. They back talked
[1:03:10] to this person. They've railed against
[1:03:12] this
[1:03:12] person. I've seen this
[1:03:18] happen. Notice Acts
[1:03:22] 9:5. Saul, why pers persecutest thou
[1:03:26] me? St. Paul's dealing with what? The
[1:03:28] body of
[1:03:29] Christ. You eat or drink unworthily.
[1:03:32] Look what Jesus said. Saul, why
[1:03:33] persecutest thou
[1:03:37] me? Look at the oneness between Christ
[1:03:41] and his bride, Christ and his
[1:03:44] church. When you back talk or judge
[1:03:48] unworthily your brother or sister,
[1:03:50] you're doing that against Jesus. That's
[1:03:53] because what the Bible says what? He
[1:03:55] that is joined with Christ is one. When
[1:03:57] you're born again, you become one. You
[1:03:59] are Mrs. Jesus Christ. The Bible it says
[1:04:01] the husband and wife are one flesh.
[1:04:03] Jesus the Bible talk about he says he
[1:04:05] said that we are bone and bone bone of
[1:04:07] his flesh and bone of his bone and flesh
[1:04:09] of his
[1:04:10] flesh. We have to be careful how we
[1:04:13] handle one
[1:04:14] another. This is the most this is one he
[1:04:17] hits this twice about what? Be careful
[1:04:20] how we treat another one another because
[1:04:22] you're not that's not you.
[1:04:25] That's not sister Z. That's Jesus
[1:04:27] Christ. Not brother Malachi that's Jesus
[1:04:28] Christ. You are Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ. Unless he's lying. Did God
[1:04:35] lie, then what are you? You are the
[1:04:38] feminine attribute of Christ of
[1:04:40] God. You and God are
[1:04:47] one. Now, after he gets after we get
[1:04:51] this understanding about the oneness
[1:04:53] communion, be careful how we're see. We
[1:04:55] got to come clean. We got to make sure
[1:04:57] everything's clean. And then what takes
[1:04:58] place next? What is he working with? He
[1:05:00] brought him all the way from division,
[1:05:02] fornication in the church. And what does
[1:05:04] he hit next in chapter
[1:05:08] 12? Let's get these spiritual gifts
[1:05:12] going. So he's bringing the complete
[1:05:14] carnal church into the spiritual
[1:05:18] gifts. What's he building to? He's going
[1:05:22] to what? Form a
[1:05:23] bride. He God what? St. Paul says, "I
[1:05:26] have espoused you to one husband, even
[1:05:29] Christ." And this is the kind of wife
[1:05:31] that Christ want. Let's talk like this.
[1:05:33] When uh Isaac was looking for his wife,
[1:05:35] he sent Eleazar, right? Elezer comes in
[1:05:38] there, he's at the well, and he's like,
[1:05:40] "Lord, give me this is the sign that I
[1:05:42] need." And sure enough, uh Rebecca comes
[1:05:45] and she does her thing and uh Eleazar's
[1:05:48] like, "That's her." What does the Bible
[1:05:50] say? He gave her gifts and she put on
[1:05:53] those gifts, those ornaments. And
[1:05:56] brother Ram said, he said, "Those were
[1:05:57] the gifts of the spirit." So we see
[1:06:00] where she put them on, show me one
[1:06:02] scripture where she took them
[1:06:05] off. So if the bride, if Rebecca want
[1:06:08] the gifts, if the bride has to have the
[1:06:10] gifts, that's what God wants. She wants
[1:06:13] you displaying what? His life working
[1:06:15] through each one of our gifts.
[1:06:21] Now, and what is he working into after
[1:06:24] verse 12? For as the body is one and
[1:06:27] hath many members, and all members of
[1:06:29] that one body being many are one body,
[1:06:31] so also is Christ. I need I need these
[1:06:35] gifts. This I can't even begin to think
[1:06:39] how complicated that
[1:06:41] is. But when he looks at those, he sees
[1:06:44] when he looks at these white keys and
[1:06:45] them black things on top, are those keys
[1:06:49] When all those keys there, he sees a
[1:06:52] song. Me, I'm just looking. They're
[1:06:55] black and white. They make noises and uh
[1:06:58] I have no idea how that works. I can't
[1:06:59] even figure it out. I need that
[1:07:03] gift. You have
[1:07:05] gifts. I need it. Sister Z, do you have
[1:07:08] the gift of
[1:07:10] prophecy? I don't know. I don't know.
[1:07:12] But if you got it, we need that. Do you
[1:07:15] speak in tongues? I don't know. Do you
[1:07:17] have that healings, miracles? We need
[1:07:20] these operating.
[1:07:22] And the prophet said, he said, if we're
[1:07:24] a good praying church, he said these
[1:07:27] things will be multiplying among
[1:07:35] us. So he brings back down to body
[1:07:38] again. We need these gifts. We need
[1:07:39] these within us. What? Because this gift
[1:07:40] is what keep the church
[1:07:42] clean. Then of course he gets verse
[1:07:44] chapter 13. What was he dealing
[1:07:47] with? Divine
[1:07:49] love. So after the gifts that divine
[1:07:53] love has to resonate in us, faith, hope,
[1:07:58] and love or charity. But the greatest of
[1:08:00] these is charity. What's he working to?
[1:08:04] He's bringing this church from the
[1:08:06] depths
[1:08:08] of
[1:08:09] insanity, from being controlled,
[1:08:11] completely controlled of Satan. He's
[1:08:13] trying to make him her the
[1:08:17] bride. Charity suffereth
[1:08:21] long guy drives me
[1:08:26] crazy. I always have to look up to him.
[1:08:28] Hurts my
[1:08:31] neck and his kind. Charity ever evident
[1:08:34] not look at those
[1:08:36] muscles vaunted himself up.
[1:08:39] I'm still older than
[1:08:40] Malachi is not puffed up. Well, brother
[1:08:43] Malachi, I'd like to shoot. I'd like to
[1:08:46] take your truck in my car and we'll see
[1:08:47] who races on the drag speed out here.
[1:08:50] Who can do the wheelies and the
[1:08:51] burnouts? No, divine love has that's not
[1:08:54] even on my
[1:08:59] mind. Do not behave itself
[1:09:02] unseemingly, seeketh not her own, is not
[1:09:06] easily provoked. thinkketh no
[1:09:09] evil now abide faith hope charity these
[1:09:11] three but the greatest of these is
[1:09:13] charity when I was a child I spake as a
[1:09:16] child and I stood as a child I thought
[1:09:17] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:09:18] away se childish things what is he
[1:09:22] bringing he's bringing us into
[1:09:24] maturity almost
[1:09:26] done chapter 14 what's he doing he says
[1:09:29] get these gifts going now we got to get
[1:09:31] the gifts in
[1:09:33] order speaking in tongues that's great
[1:09:35] he says but I'd rather you prophesy
[1:09:38] He says, "Because when someone here
[1:09:39] comes in here to speak in tongues,
[1:09:40] they're like, "Oh, this is barbarian
[1:09:42] barbarians, right?" But if then after
[1:09:44] someone speaks in tongues and someone
[1:09:45] interprets and bring forth the prophecy,
[1:09:48] surely God is in this place.
[1:09:52] See, this is this is the Holy Spirit
[1:09:54] bringing this people, this church
[1:09:58] back. Now, let me read you
[1:10:01] something. Is it possible for the
[1:10:04] Corinthians to make the rapture
[1:10:07] if they follow these
[1:10:10] guidelines because look at this in 1
[1:10:12] Thessalonians 4 verse 13 through 18.
[1:10:15] This is the rapture. This is
[1:10:17] rapture. For if we believe that Jesus
[1:10:20] died and rose. Oh, let's verse 13. But I
[1:10:24] would not have you to be ignorant,
[1:10:25] brethren, concerning them which are
[1:10:26] asleep that have passed
[1:10:28] on, not as others which have no hope.
[1:10:30] For if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:10:32] rose again, even so them also which
[1:10:34] sleep in Jesus shall God bring with
[1:10:40] him. For if we believe that Jesus and
[1:10:43] dies, uh oh yeah, for this for this we
[1:10:46] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:10:47] that we which are alive and remain. So
[1:10:49] you've got not only you have to be alive
[1:10:51] at the rapture, but you must remain in
[1:10:53] the word.
[1:10:55] you must remain because what does the
[1:10:57] Bible talk about in Hebrews 6, Hebrews
[1:10:59] 10, those that turned
[1:11:01] back and Cain left the presence of the
[1:11:05] Lord. John 666, and they no longer
[1:11:09] walked with
[1:11:10] Jesus. We have to remain in the presence
[1:11:13] of God in the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:19] He
[1:11:20] says that we which are alive remain unto
[1:11:22] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:11:24] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[1:11:25] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:11:27] shout, with a voice of the angel, and
[1:11:28] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[1:11:30] Christ shall rise first. So what does he
[1:11:32] hit first? The dead in Christ. And then
[1:11:35] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:11:36] caught up together with them in the
[1:11:39] clouds. 1 Corinthians
[1:11:41] 15. 1 Corinthians 15. The first part
[1:11:44] deal with what? the resurrection of the
[1:11:49] dead. First of all, we need to clean
[1:11:51] this church up. Not saying this,
[1:11:53] but get the church clean. Get the gifts
[1:11:57] operating. Then he starts dealing with
[1:12:00] what? The dead in Christ
[1:12:03] rising. Now
[1:12:07] notice, for the dead rise
[1:12:10] not, for if the dead rise not, then is
[1:12:13] not Christ raised? Then is not Christ
[1:12:15] raised? And if Christ be not raised,
[1:12:17] your faith is vain, and yet are you in
[1:12:18] your sins? Then they also which are
[1:12:20] fallen asleep in Christ are perish. If
[1:12:22] in if in this only life only we have
[1:12:25] this hope that we are men most
[1:12:26] miserable. But now is Christ raised from
[1:12:28] the dead and become the first fruits of
[1:12:30] them which slept. So if Christ was the
[1:12:32] first fruits and he rose up, then those
[1:12:34] that died in Christ will rise up again.
[1:12:38] He says, "For since man, since by man
[1:12:40] came death, and by man also came the
[1:12:42] resurrection of the dead." See, Christ
[1:12:44] did it as a man. He rose up. Then the
[1:12:46] dead in Christ will rise up as well. For
[1:12:48] as in all Adam, for in Adam all died,
[1:12:50] even so Christ shall all even so in
[1:12:53] Christ shall all be made alive. But
[1:12:55] every man in his own order, Christ the
[1:12:57] first fruits. After they that are at
[1:13:00] Christ at his coming. So at the coming
[1:13:03] Lord, who are the first fruits? The dead
[1:13:05] in
[1:13:09] Christ. That's great.
[1:13:12] But then now 1 Corinthians
[1:13:14] 15:50. But now I say this, brethren,
[1:13:16] that the flesh and blood cannot inherit
[1:13:18] the kingdom of God. Neither does
[1:13:20] corruption put incorruption inherit
[1:13:23] corrupt incorruption. Behold, I show you
[1:13:25] a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but
[1:13:27] we shall be changed. Saints of God, he
[1:13:30] brings this church completely messed up
[1:13:34] to being ready for the rapture.
[1:13:38] The worst church. He says, "If you
[1:13:40] follow my
[1:13:43] plan, this is what takes place next."
[1:13:48] Well, brother Sai, man, uh, my home life
[1:13:51] or I'm not really, just follow the
[1:13:54] plan. As brother Jesse said one time,
[1:13:57] textbook
[1:13:59] Bible, you don't know how to make the
[1:14:00] rapture, just read 1 Corinthians and go
[1:14:03] all the way to 15. And in there, you'll
[1:14:04] find how to make the rapture. He takes
[1:14:06] you step by step by step by step
[1:14:10] cleaning up, cleaning up, cleaning up.
[1:14:12] Oh, let's get spiritual now. Get these
[1:14:14] gifts going. This and that. But maybe
[1:14:16] after all these, no matter what gifts
[1:14:17] you got, he said, "We got to have divine
[1:14:18] love." Once we That divine love is
[1:14:20] there, what? We're ready for the
[1:14:23] rapture. Let's
[1:14:32] stand. I'm sure many men I wonder
[1:14:37] What Apollos? Because remember some say
[1:14:39] I'm of Cphus. I'm Apollos. I'm of uh
[1:14:42] Peter. I'm of I'm of Jesus. I wonder if
[1:14:45] uh Apollos would came to Corinthians
[1:14:46] what he would hit. He probably preached
[1:14:48] something deep
[1:14:50] mystery. If if Peter would come there
[1:14:52] and says, "Repent. We are faith. You got
[1:14:54] faith. You're a children of the faith."
[1:14:56] Why? Because he was a fire brand,
[1:14:58] right? But the first church age comes on
[1:15:00] the scene and sees a church completely
[1:15:02] out of
[1:15:03] chaos. And the Holy Spirit says, "Get
[1:15:05] them in line. I want them in the
[1:15:08] rapture. They must make this rapture."
[1:15:11] And now, not even when he's in their
[1:15:13] presence, but he writes a
[1:15:15] letter so inspired of God that shows
[1:15:18] them how to make the rapture. And he
[1:15:20] sends it
[1:15:21] out. And everyone in that church,
[1:15:23] Corinthians, will be judged by those
[1:15:27] letters. Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:15:31] His word is rich. His word is
[1:15:35] right and we can have confidence in
[1:15:38] that. Saints of God, I want to
[1:15:41] be now what's what what did the prophet
[1:15:44] say that this age would
[1:15:47] produce? Oh, another Corinthians. No,
[1:15:51] another
[1:15:53] Ephesians. He said there would come
[1:15:55] another Ephesians to this. He said even
[1:15:57] Christ, he says, was an Ephesian. What
[1:15:59] was an Ephesian? They were as Corinthian
[1:16:03] was in that kind of a condition. The
[1:16:06] Ephesians were already in line. They
[1:16:08] were already in
[1:16:09] order. They were a mature church. He
[1:16:12] could bring predestination within the
[1:16:14] first chapter. And they're just like,
[1:16:17] "Yeah, that's
[1:16:21] right." And he brought what? The second
[1:16:23] greatest mystery in the
[1:16:24] Bible between between Christ and the
[1:16:27] bride. I think he says this is a great
[1:16:30] mystery. Out of the 12 mysteries, two of
[1:16:33] them are great. Godhead and first
[1:16:35] Corinth or Ephesians 4 or Ephesians 5,
[1:16:38] I'm
[1:16:39] sorry. Let's be the Ephesian. But saints
[1:16:43] of God, if we still have some
[1:16:44] characteristics of remember, we're in
[1:16:45] America. There is probably a little bit
[1:16:47] of Corinthianism in us. We've got to get
[1:16:49] out. But that takes by what? The Holy
[1:16:51] Spirit. Saints of God, we can do nothing
[1:16:53] except God alone.
[1:16:55] We can't. We can't even. I would love to
[1:16:58] grow a little bit taller. We can't even
[1:17:00] do that. I would love to have a little
[1:17:01] more hair right here. I don't know if
[1:17:02] you noticed, but I would love to do
[1:17:04] this. Saints of God, you can't add one
[1:17:06] thing to yourself.
[1:17:09] Malachi is looking at Mr. Bubs. Mr.
[1:17:11] Bub's like, "Oh yeah, Malachi, you're
[1:17:13] getting pretty big, but I'm still
[1:17:14] bigger." Right? Mal's like, "Well, look,
[1:17:16] saints of God, let's get ready for the
[1:17:19] rapture. We know the path. Let's grow in
[1:17:23] maturity." Amen. Brother Mal if you want
[1:17:25] to come play
[1:17:29] here. Thanks God these things were
[1:17:31] written for edification. These things
[1:17:34] were written for what? That we would
[1:17:36] know how to deal with these things.
[1:17:38] Because remember most of these things in
[1:17:40] the Corinthian church they were dealing
[1:17:42] with things within their own assembly
[1:17:44] with an individuals with within the same
[1:17:48] assembly is what it all comes down to
[1:17:50] this. If Christ's in you and Christ is
[1:17:52] in me, we've got to work this out
[1:17:55] together. We've got to be in the same
[1:17:56] mind. We've coming to a
[1:17:59] oneness. Read John 14 15 and 16 tonight.
[1:18:03] Even 17. Jesus said he said that they
[1:18:06] may become one. Now, the World Council
[1:18:08] church is going to use that scripture
[1:18:12] too. John
[1:18:14] 17:21 20 21 22. But that's that
[1:18:18] scripture is for the bride. This bride
[1:18:20] is going to come to a oneness with
[1:18:22] Christ and one another. This body will
[1:18:25] be built again.
[1:18:27] Amen. Well, hearts, minds clear. If you
[1:18:30] need prayer, saints, God, we will be
[1:18:31] happy to anoint with oil and say a
[1:18:35] prayer. But let's just say a word here.
[1:18:38] Let's bow our
[1:18:40] heads. Lord Jesus, there's many things
[1:18:43] written here, Lord. Many things said,
[1:18:46] and Lord Jesus, I just brought it with
[1:18:48] awesome God. just the only way I could
[1:18:50] bring it.
[1:18:51] Lord, thank you for this thought. Lord,
[1:18:53] we know you gave it to our brother, God.
[1:18:55] Came fresh from heaven, just
[1:18:57] showing how much you love this
[1:19:00] Corinthian church.
[1:19:02] Lord, even though we're such
[1:19:06] uh carnal believers,
[1:19:09] Lord, in fact, St. Paul said they were
[1:19:11] sanctified. He didn't say anything about
[1:19:12] being filled with the Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost, but they were sanctified. And
[1:19:18] Lord Jesus, you took that you took that
[1:19:20] woman, that church, Lord, in that
[1:19:21] condition and you tried to work her up
[1:19:24] to the stage to be the bride, Lord. And
[1:19:27] Lord Jesus, right now, every church on
[1:19:29] the face of the earth is a woman. It's a
[1:19:32] type of the woman. And Lord God, every
[1:19:34] church is in a
[1:19:36] condition. And Lord Jesus, Lord, we do
[1:19:39] never want to identify ourselves with
[1:19:41] the Corinthian church, Lord. But Lord
[1:19:44] God, we choose Lord to accept and
[1:19:46] believe, Lord, that we are the
[1:19:47] Ephesians. And Lord God, whatever it
[1:19:49] takes to get us to that Ephesians state,
[1:19:52] God, to get us to the Ephesian level,
[1:19:54] God, that sort of maturity, God, Lord,
[1:19:57] we're there was only one letter, a small
[1:20:00] letter written to the the Ephesian, the
[1:20:02] mature church, and that would get them
[1:20:05] in the rapture, Lord.
[1:20:08] And Lord Jesus, as you said, the mi the
[1:20:11] great mystery, Lord, is between you and
[1:20:12] the church. Lord, how we should
[1:20:14] reverence ourselves to our
[1:20:18] headship. Lord, some of us have
[1:20:20] children, some of us has husbands and
[1:20:22] wives, some of us have jobs, but Lord,
[1:20:24] unless you are the
[1:20:25] preeminence, unless that wife submits
[1:20:28] herself totally to the husband,
[1:20:30] Lord, then Lord God, who would you be
[1:20:33] interested in that kind of a woman,
[1:20:34] Lord? But Lord Jesus, Lord, we yield
[1:20:36] ourselves. We humble ourselves, Lord. We
[1:20:38] can we dedicate ourselves once more,
[1:20:41] Lord, as we do daily, God. Lord, Lord,
[1:20:43] we want to stay clean, Lord. We want to
[1:20:45] make you, we seek first you uh the
[1:20:48] kingdom of heaven, Lord, and all these
[1:20:50] things will be added unto us, Lord. We
[1:20:52] love you. Bless the people, God. Bless
[1:20:55] Pastor Jesse, God, and his wife. And
[1:20:57] thank you for the child for safe
[1:20:58] delivery, Lord. Had to come a different
[1:21:00] way, but Lord, you are in full
[1:21:02] control. No life was lost, Lord, but
[1:21:05] life was brought in, Lord. We love you.
[1:21:07] Bless the people, God. Give them
[1:21:09] strength, God.
