[0:00] house the Lord
[0:01] hallelujah let's go to James chapter 1:8
[0:03] we'll read James 4:8 I want to continue
[0:05] this little series here wasn't expecting
[0:08] it to be a series
[0:10] but feeling the inspiration of the Holy
[0:12] Spirit praise
[0:14] God so part one we looked at James 1 and
[0:17] James 4 and then Eli and Wednesday night
[0:19] we looked at part two we looked at James
[0:21] chapter 3 and we looked at the life of
[0:23] King Saul so that was quite astounding
[0:26] to me I'm certainly enjoying the word of
[0:28] God I trust it's a blessing to you
[0:30] Hallelujah today we want to look at a
[0:32] little bit about the fivefold ministry
[0:34] here as it relates to the scripture so
[0:37] James chapter 1 ver
[0:41] 8 read James 4
[0:46] ver8 James 1 ver8 this is the this is
[0:50] the double mindedness that you and I
[0:52] will battle uh because we go through
[0:54] tests trials we have to suffer through
[0:56] patience right learn patience and this
[0:59] is a double minded that will battle Lord
[1:01] do you hear me Lord uh am I going to
[1:04] make it through this trial Lord what's
[1:05] your will Lord I need wisdom that's the
[1:07] double-mindedness that will battle
[1:09] praise God all right now let's read
[1:11] verse eight ready one two 3 a
[1:13] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:17] ways we saw that with Eli he was
[1:19] unstable in his parenting unstable in
[1:21] his spiritual walk with his health right
[1:24] we saw it with everything in his life
[1:26] was unstable because he was
[1:28] double-minded now let's look at uh 4:8
[1:31] by God's
[1:42] grace let's read this on three one two
[1:44] three draw nigh to God and He will draw
[1:48] nigh to you cleanse your hands ye
[1:51] Sinners and purify your hearts ye doubl
[1:55] minded amen let's have one more word of
[1:57] prayer if you have a need on your heart
[1:58] let's make ano unto God God sees all our
[2:00] needs this morning God is able God is
[2:02] faithful Hallelujah he's Eternal he
[2:03] knows all things he already knows what
[2:05] tomorrow holds father God we thank you
[2:07] again for today Lord let your bride come
[2:09] forth as we've sang Lord God we know
[2:10] we're Onward Christian Soldiers we're
[2:12] marching as to war with the cross of
[2:15] Jesus going on before Lord God
[2:17] hallelujah we remember the cross Lord
[2:18] and remember you died to forgive our
[2:20] sins and then you sent your spirit to
[2:22] empower us to live a Christian Life on
[2:25] the front lines of the battle so
[2:26] strengthen us today Lord God as we all
[2:29] battle double mind Lord as the
[2:30] scriptures Plain on this father help us
[2:32] to learn from these examples of Eli uh
[2:35] Lord uh we saw King Saul on Wednesday
[2:37] Lord and the scriptures we be looking at
[2:39] here today Grant it Lord Jesus may your
[2:41] spirit minister to every need Lord God
[2:43] and we know Lord all things are possible
[2:45] Lord to them that believe so father
[2:46] minister to your people in Jesus
[2:48] Christ's name amen God bless you as
[2:50] you're being seated praise
[2:55] God hallelujah so remember uh James 1
[2:58] deals with you and I we'd say the these
[2:59] are the battles that we would struggle
[3:01] with as far as we'd say holy ghost
[3:03] filled Saints uh by the grace of God uh
[3:06] lacking wisdom sometimes we lack wisdom
[3:08] for our lives we need God's Direction
[3:10] what is God's will for our life and the
[3:12] Bible tells us to not be tossed to and
[3:14] fro uh but to have a revelation to seek
[3:17] God and trust God lord if I ask you for
[3:19] wisdom you're going to give it to me
[3:21] Hallelujah then we saw in James chapter
[3:23] 4 in the beginning there was Wars and
[3:25] fightings among the church members and
[3:28] also there was adultery in the church
[3:30] and uh James says these things ought not
[3:33] to be so he said because these people
[3:35] are double-minded they've got dirty
[3:37] hands and dirty Hearts is what James
[3:40] told us so we see there's two kinds of
[3:42] double-mindedness there's a double
[3:43] mindedness the believer who's living in
[3:45] Victory will uh have to battle and
[3:48] overcome but then there's double
[3:49] mindedness uh we'd say for make
[3:51] Believers or foolish virgin or something
[3:53] along those lines where uh they haven't
[3:56] got enough Grace to really live above
[3:58] the things of the world praise God how
[4:00] many want to be James chapter 1
[4:01] Believers that's what I want to be
[4:02] Hallelujah I want to be one of those now
[4:04] I want to take this thought this thought
[4:06] struck me real good I think I mentioned
[4:07] in a couple times but not really
[4:09] preached on it um James 1 verse6 so
[4:12] right before verse 8 where we get the
[4:14] double-minded
[4:15] man verse six says but let him ask in
[4:18] faith nothing wavering so you can ask in
[4:21] assurance and this is what we're you
[4:23] know we're taught brother BR taught us
[4:24] this I try to remind you of this after
[4:26] we say a prayer for you go back and
[4:28] thank God that he heard your PR prayer
[4:30] praise God while you're finishing the
[4:32] service praise God uh on Monday praise
[4:35] God on Tuesday amen praise God let it be
[4:37] a uh let it be something that's finished
[4:39] in your life praise God it's got to be
[4:41] finished right because we have to ask
[4:42] with an assurance Lord I know you heard
[4:44] my prayer last week uh think about it
[4:46] you know last time you come up for
[4:47] prayer are you still hanging on to God's
[4:49] promise amen hallelujah that's what the
[4:50] Bible's telling us don't be
[4:52] double-minded be assured if God didn't
[4:54] send it a week then he'll send it next
[4:56] week brother BR says if you send it
[4:57] don't send it next week he'll send it
[4:58] next month Hallelujah
[5:00] so you have to have that confidence
[5:01] that's what we have to ask in faith with
[5:04] nothing wavering you I think about my my
[5:06] loved ones that I prayed for over the
[5:07] years you know for I prayed for my dad
[5:09] for almost 40 years I'm 40 almost 44
[5:11] I've probably been praying for him my
[5:13] whole life but I I I have to apply this
[5:15] to my life I'm not going to waver I'm
[5:17] going to trust God right now my mind
[5:19] might battle but I've ultimately got to
[5:21] choose either Faith or unbelief and by
[5:24] God's grace we're going to choose Faith
[5:25] Hallelujah because you got to ask in
[5:27] faith ask with Assurance I know hears me
[5:30] with nothing wavering for he that
[5:33] wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[5:35] driven with the wind and tossed so
[5:39] here's the this is like a metaphor James
[5:42] gives us when someone asks for a prayer
[5:44] request if they don't accept that God
[5:46] heard them they'll be tossed like a wave
[5:48] back and forth and we've seen some
[5:49] mighty waves with these hurricanes right
[5:51] this hurricane down there you've seen
[5:52] some mighty waves and today this morning
[5:54] I saw Bridges collapse and fall and be
[5:56] washed away bridges of hundreds of tons
[5:59] of concrete and uh the wa the the waves
[6:02] just wash it away and they and they
[6:04] they'll say now now these roads are
[6:06] roads to Nowhere or that bridge is no
[6:08] more there's no more Bridge there right
[6:10] and that's that's the imagery James is
[6:12] giving us our faith can't be like that
[6:14] we can't be driven well I believe it
[6:15] today or I don't believe it tomorrow
[6:18] we've got to we got to have such a walk
[6:20] with God that God's word I say gives us
[6:23] a revelation it does something deep down
[6:25] inside of us something is quickened on
[6:27] the inside of us praise God we've got to
[6:30] be able to come back to that when God
[6:31] quickened it to me God revealed it to me
[6:33] uh God made it known to me Hallelujah
[6:35] the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against
[6:36] that Revelation
[6:38] hallelujah it's either that or we're
[6:40] going to be tossed like those waves
[6:42] tossed back and forth uh is he does he
[6:44] hear me will he answer does he care does
[6:47] he love me of course God loves us
[6:49] hallelujah amen but we need reminders of
[6:51] that Hallelujah that God hears our
[6:53] prayers amen and we got to have that
[6:55] kind of Faith but we we see that we get
[6:57] this idea of being tossed this means
[7:00] agitate Hallelujah so uh they're tossed
[7:03] like waves agitated like
[7:05] waves Hallelujah it means to Breeze up
[7:08] uh like a fan or Billows like we sing
[7:11] about the Billows roll Hallelujah to
[7:13] Breeze up toss back and forth so if
[7:16] we're not truly convinced when we come
[7:18] up for prayer if we're not truly
[7:19] convinced when we even pray at home then
[7:21] we're going to be tossed back and forth
[7:23] and James said that's not the place you
[7:24] want to be as a Believer you want to
[7:26] know that God will work out uh that P
[7:29] patience will have her perfect work in
[7:31] your life hallelujah
[7:34] amen Bible says in James 1:7 let not
[7:36] that man think he shall receive anything
[7:39] of the Lord now this is this is book of
[7:41] Acts faith and the church said James was
[7:44] one of the original book of Acts
[7:45] Believers amen he was a step brother to
[7:48] Jesus we'd say you know that's right and
[7:50] so he's writing the first uh Epistle of
[7:53] the New Testament the first letter
[7:55] inspired Bible piece here or letter of
[7:58] the New Testament and he tells us we
[8:00] cannot expect to receive anything unless
[8:02] we have faith that God heard our prayer
[8:05] amen hallelujah so God help us to
[8:07] believe I know some Services church it's
[8:08] harder for others to believe than others
[8:10] but our desire is to encourage everyone
[8:12] let's believe on God's word hallelujah
[8:15] let's believe with all of our hearts we
[8:16] all go through ups and downs sometimes
[8:17] we find oursel on the mountain top
[8:18] praise God it's easy to say Amen those
[8:20] times other times we find ourselves in
[8:22] the valley it's hard even to squeak out
[8:23] of Amen but either way God's word is
[8:26] true Hallelujah and God will come
[8:28] chasing us down right God will come uh
[8:30] seeking us out as the the great Shepherd
[8:33] who seeks and saves that which was lost
[8:34] did you ever think of that that sheep
[8:36] was always a sheep is that right church
[8:38] he was never a goat that sheep was
[8:40] always a Sheep amen you always a child
[8:43] of God you're always a daughter of God
[8:44] Amen and God will come looking for you
[8:46] because he's the great Shepherd
[8:47] Hallelujah he's the faithful one but
[8:50] James says please don't be double-minded
[8:52] because this produces an a condition of
[8:55] being
[8:57] unstable or inconstant Conant is another
[9:00] word that's why I like the name constant
[9:01] from our Lamplighter book there
[9:04] Hallelujah the certain ey of The
[9:06] Splendid way Hallelujah he was
[9:08] constant now I read I read this to you
[9:11] last month or maybe a month before
[9:12] brother R was talking about Abraham
[9:14] Abraham was no special man he said come
[9:16] down from the Tower of Babel perhaps
[9:17] come out of an idolator Bunch his father
[9:19] no doubt they were making Idols he came
[9:22] down to the land of Shar down there to
[9:23] dwell in the city of er while he was
[9:25] there God spoke to him by
[9:27] Grace he said oh how Abraham tested
[9:31] God's
[9:32] patience notice the human the believer
[9:36] tests God's
[9:38] patience we all experience that times
[9:40] don't we right we all struggle to
[9:42] believe does God hear me or not and
[9:44] during those times we're actually
[9:46] testing God's patience but Church beyond
[9:49] all of it behind all of it it's actually
[9:50] God testing our patience Hallelujah so
[9:54] we see it in our human failures in our
[9:55] human uh weaknesses when we get
[9:57] feeble-minded or we get tired or worn
[10:00] out or depressed or discouraged it's
[10:02] it's as if we're testing God's patience
[10:04] but God's patience can never fail
[10:07] Hallelujah brother Maham said Abraham
[10:10] spoke of us God took Abraham by grace
[10:13] and saved him that's how he takes you by
[10:16] Grace he said how do we test his
[10:18] patience he says today we're up tomorrow
[10:21] we're
[10:22] down one day we believe the next day
[10:25] we're
[10:26] wondering isn't that the truth I I was
[10:29] hoping to to hear some more amens
[10:30] Hallelujah isn't that the truth someday
[10:32] we you think about where you were last
[10:33] Sunday or the Sunday before or the last
[10:35] time you had a great experience in your
[10:36] life where are you not today where
[10:39] where's that same Victory we had two
[10:41] weeks ago or a year a year ago even
[10:44] where is that see we're up and down God
[10:46] help us to be faithful God help us to be
[10:48] constant God help us to remember that
[10:50] Revelation that he already put in our
[10:52] soul
[10:53] Hallelujah Satan tries to make us forget
[10:56] but God wants us to remember the
[10:57] promises of God that's that's why Peter
[10:59] said stir up uh yourselves by way of
[11:05] remembrance he says one day we believe
[11:07] the next day we're wondering today we're
[11:09] Methodist tomorrow we're Baptist right
[11:11] and some Churches you know today I go to
[11:13] this church in the city tomorrow I go to
[11:14] the next Church in the city right just
[11:17] toss all about toss from that to that I
[11:20] believe I don't believe that church to
[11:21] this church is toss all around that's
[11:24] what he says tomorrow the tummy a comes
[11:26] and we don't know whether we believe it
[11:27] or not
[11:30] God help us but yet in the midst of all
[11:33] that God wants us to stay
[11:36] put it's the so it's the battle it's the
[11:39] battle to stay single-minded on God's
[11:42] word despite our sickness despite our
[11:44] struggles God wants us to be
[11:46] single-minded but brother says but he
[11:49] saves us anyhow if it wasn't the grace
[11:51] of God we'd all be gone sure God Saves
[11:55] Us by his
[11:56] grace all right now I saw this
[11:58] connection James 1:6 with Ephesians 4:14
[12:01] so if you have your Bibles go there by
[12:03] God's
[12:04] grace and while while we're turning
[12:06] there I just thought of that you know
[12:07] this this whole series was of course
[12:08] stirred up by what brother Dennis
[12:09] preached and then brother Ben NAD uh but
[12:12] then also there was a question on
[12:13] YouTube I made a video about Derek
[12:15] Prince I don't know if you saw that or
[12:16] not um Derek Prince said uh brother
[12:19] brandham had two Spirits working in him
[12:21] and that didn't sit with me really good
[12:23] that didn't sit good at all with me and
[12:25] I thought about it and uh and that's not
[12:28] true you know uh he he uh Derek Prince
[12:31] said brother Ram was controlled by two
[12:32] different Spirits that's a
[12:34] lie to be controlled means to be
[12:38] possessed so it's just ridiculous he
[12:40] don't even the people don't even know
[12:41] what they're saying now blessed his soul
[12:42] he passed on in 2003 but I'm not trying
[12:44] to rebuke him or anything like that God
[12:45] bless him for his faithful years of
[12:46] service but to say something like that
[12:49] it it would mean you're possessed by God
[12:50] and the devil at the same time I'm sorry
[12:52] God doesn't operate his business like
[12:54] that hallelujah what what he was trying
[12:57] to get at which he was wrong what what
[12:59] he was trying to get at is that
[13:00] sometimes Church were double-minded
[13:02] that's how this opened up to me I was
[13:04] like there there's got to be something
[13:05] he's talking about in the scripture and
[13:07] that's how it opened up to me the
[13:08] double-mindedness now brother R was
[13:10] single-minded on Christ I be people like
[13:13] Derek Prince and other ones you know uh
[13:15] Gordon Lindsay and different ones Ern
[13:17] baxer I believe they were the
[13:18] double-minded ones now I say that humbly
[13:19] but I believe I got proof of that
[13:21] because they reject the Lord Jesus
[13:22] Christ baptism they reject serpent seed
[13:25] they reject the God's one person you got
[13:27] to be double-minded to accept things
[13:28] like that that's right Hallelujah now we
[13:31] know Ephesians 4:11 speaks of the
[13:32] fivefold ministry praise God what does
[13:35] this do verse 12 it perfects the Saints
[13:39] for the work of the ministry so it
[13:41] perfects you uh gives you the work of
[13:43] the ministry and it edifies the body of
[13:45] Christ Hallelujah see it does three
[13:47] things there until so it's going to do
[13:49] this until we all come in the unity of
[13:52] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[13:54] Son of God unto a perfect man so mature
[13:56] unto the measure of the stature of the
[13:58] full fullness of Christ so all the
[14:00] fullness of Christ that were to manifest
[14:02] the fivefold ministry will bring you
[14:04] into that hallelujah praise God why wh
[14:08] so what's the point of that because we
[14:10] want to avoid verse 14 which is
[14:11] connecting with James 1:6 that we
[14:14] henceforth be no more children see it's
[14:16] children it's it's immature Christians
[14:18] that are tossed to and fro remember
[14:20] James gave us that same language tossed
[14:23] right tossed to and fro carried about
[14:26] with every wind of Doctrine
[14:29] see so so one week they believe this
[14:31] side of the doctrine the next week
[14:32] they're back over there few years later
[14:35] they're over here and over there and all
[14:37] these different things that that they're
[14:38] get they get tossed back and forth I
[14:40] used to believe this I don't believe
[14:41] that God help us to find the truth on
[14:43] something and stay with the truth
[14:45] Allelujah see that by the slight of men
[14:48] now that means the uh like the the
[14:50] rolling of dice so false preachers get
[14:53] anointed by demons and and they they
[14:55] they just try to gamble they just try to
[14:57] deceive a person with their preaching
[14:59] ing make it a A sly they put like they
[15:02] try to put sly little lies in their
[15:04] sermons that's right and cunning
[15:07] craftiness whereby th Li and weight to
[15:09] deceive now often they're trying to
[15:11] deceive you mostly into money mostly
[15:12] false preachers are after money that's
[15:14] the one they're after the most right but
[15:16] then there's women also popularity so
[15:19] that's why they want to deceive mostly
[15:21] it's because of money right because what
[15:23] where do most people want to go how many
[15:24] people we had just this year come by and
[15:26] say oh we're looking for a church and
[15:28] they say well there's another church
[15:29] here there might be the same distance
[15:30] which church do they normally choose the
[15:32] bigger church right my wife and I my
[15:35] wife and I seen that different three or
[15:36] four couples this year uh which church
[15:38] you want to go to the big church little
[15:39] church it's always the big church and
[15:41] that's fine go where God leads you right
[15:43] but see most people are attracted to
[15:45] crowds money buildings all these type of
[15:47] things but we've got to be attracted to
[15:49] the word of God hallelujah we just got
[15:51] to be what God called us to be brother
[15:54] bam I just listened to brother BR
[15:55] yesterday he was saying the whole armor
[15:57] of God he was saying we're just a little
[15:59] group here we only have 300 or 400
[16:02] people now we call that a big group but
[16:05] brother said we're just a little group
[16:06] that was in
[16:07] 1962 he said we're not with that big
[16:09] group he said but you notice God's
[16:11] normally with the small group not the
[16:14] multitude he said wherever two or three
[16:16] are gathered there I am in the midst
[16:18] Hallelujah so see it's you know it
[16:21] applies of course to the 300 as well you
[16:23] know but it's wherever the Believers are
[16:25] praise God so notice if if if listeners
[16:30] to preaching if they don't accept the
[16:31] true five full ministry what would they
[16:33] do they'll be tossed to and fro on every
[16:35] wind of Doctrine and I preached
[16:37] doctrines of devils two years ago I went
[16:39] through all those examples the main one
[16:41] right now is Prosperity Gospel oh if
[16:44] you're in the message you ought to be
[16:45] rich and healthy and God wants to heal
[16:46] you every time and all these what a
[16:48] bunch of
[16:49] nonsense yet the very same people that
[16:51] say that their loved ones will die or
[16:52] you know uh where was your faith you
[16:54] know they're almost admitting that
[16:56] they're wrong I mean their own actions
[16:57] prove they're wrong right but they're
[16:59] they're admitting through their
[17:00] preaching showing that they're wrong
[17:02] praise God no healing rest in any man uh
[17:05] no no blessing rest in any man blessing
[17:08] and healing only rest in the will of God
[17:11] hallelujah that's right Church you can't
[17:13] add Bible said you can't add one cubit
[17:15] to your stature praise God you can't
[17:17] make one hair red or one hair white or
[17:19] whatever now they can do it with with
[17:21] with dyes but that that's a demonic we
[17:23] know that Hallelujah you can't make one
[17:25] white hair black or or brown or whatever
[17:27] the color is it's God who's in control
[17:30] praise God so see if we have the true
[17:33] five-fold Ministry we will not be tossed
[17:35] to and fro that's my testimony that's
[17:37] many people's testimony I know in the
[17:39] message they're no longer tossed to and
[17:42] fro God has showed them the truth
[17:44] they're on the highway to Holiness
[17:46] praise God
[17:47] Amen like I told you I had that one
[17:49] college roommate he was good man good
[17:52] man but you know when things were going
[17:54] good he would wear the sweatpants you
[17:56] know but I remember specifically in the
[17:57] summertime uh he he he claimed to be
[17:59] Holiness he's the one that would speak
[18:00] in tongues and so forth like that all
[18:01] the time he'd speak in tongues I said
[18:03] that's fine I remember specifically that
[18:06] one hot day he said he looked at me he
[18:08] said he said Jess he said man this is
[18:10] too hot for me I'm sorry he said I'm
[18:11] sorry I've got to break the Holiness
[18:13] standers I got to take off my shirt and
[18:14] my sweatpants and we're standing amongst
[18:16] all these people and all these all these
[18:18] Sinners are watching him take off his
[18:20] shirt and strip down while I stay in my
[18:22] my t-shirt and
[18:23] sweatpants and that's just how it was he
[18:25] would go back and forth right wavering
[18:28] back and forth tossed right back and
[18:31] forth moved by conditions but a child of
[18:34] God is not moved by conditions amen like
[18:37] like Simon Simon told me a few years ago
[18:39] he went to Cedar Point and guess who he
[18:41] runs into a piano player in a certain
[18:43] church and she's got short song because
[18:46] it's so hot she got long hair it's uncut
[18:50] maybe I guess I can't always tell that
[18:53] but then she you know she and he's like
[18:55] oh my goodness you know in his mind he's
[18:56] like Mercy oh what's happening you know
[19:00] see that that's what happens to so many
[19:01] people when conditions change their
[19:04] standards change they get tossed by the
[19:07] Heat or they get tossed by by by by
[19:09] pressures of the world but a real child
[19:11] of God stays with the word of God
[19:13] hallelujah brother said if you don't
[19:14] catch in these minor things he said when
[19:16] the major Comes The Rapture it's going
[19:18] to go right over your head he's talking
[19:19] about cutting hair and wearing the right
[19:20] clothes and dressing holy and modest we
[19:23] got to catch it in everything
[19:25] hallelujah it's got to be a reality to
[19:27] us without compromising on the word of
[19:29] God that's right Hallelujah but see
[19:31] these fluctuate to and fro and this is
[19:34] the same guy you know that uh I love a
[19:36] man but this is the same guy he would go
[19:38] to meetings one time we were praying for
[19:39] the Holy Ghost in our three or four of
[19:42] us and he started breaking out in one of
[19:43] these holy ghost laughing spells he
[19:44] called it but I found out later that
[19:46] wasn't the Holy Ghost they literally
[19:49] laugh until they can't laugh anymore
[19:52] like they're just you know we're praying
[19:53] and if you haven't seen it Kenneth Hagen
[19:55] did it Kenneth copelan all these false
[19:57] prophets it's an evil spirit to possess
[20:00] people I always thought that was really
[20:02] strange but I found out later it goes
[20:03] along with that speaking in tongues is
[20:05] the evidence if they take that and they
[20:08] they try to pretend to speak in tongues
[20:09] they can actually get an evil spirit
[20:11] possessing them right because there's no
[20:14] there's no correction on the tongues
[20:15] brother Ram said if you don't have an
[20:16] interpretation for the tongue then you
[20:18] don't know where it came from and that's
[20:20] a very dangerous thing to
[20:22] do right that's why tongues unknown
[20:25] tongues are not the evidence of the Holy
[20:26] Ghost amen how Hallelujah a baptism of
[20:30] the Holy Ghost will produce a see and
[20:32] hear experience it'll produce the Life
[20:34] of Christ amen it'll put you into
[20:37] service so you can Faithfully serve God
[20:40] hallelujah hallelujah you're into
[20:42] service amen you can serve the Lord
[20:44] under the power of God hallelujah amen
[20:47] glory to
[20:49] God but see these outside the fivefold
[20:52] ministry are those disobedient to the
[20:54] five-fold ministry they fluctuate
[20:56] they're tossed to and fro from every
[20:58] move or every exciting thing or every
[21:00] every wind of Doctrine now church I'm
[21:03] not I'm not throwing anybody under the
[21:04] bus because like I said brother man says
[21:05] sometimes we struggle we got a tummy
[21:07] ache I'm trying to be gracious today
[21:10] right I want to be gracious today
[21:12] because I might be on the mountain top
[21:13] you might be on the valley or in the
[21:15] valley and I know what it's like to be
[21:17] in the the valley too we've all been
[21:18] through there but thank God he walks
[21:20] with us with us through the valley
[21:22] praise God now verse 15 what is the what
[21:24] is the true five-fold Ministry produce
[21:26] it speaks the truth in love and it grows
[21:29] up into him in all things which is the
[21:31] head even Christ so see remember all
[21:34] things right that that's if a person is
[21:36] single-minded then their whole life is
[21:39] stable I made a list uh and I didn't
[21:42] read it on Wednesday night so let me
[21:44] scroll up to that because we talked
[21:45] about how Eli was unstable in every era
[21:48] of his life he couldn't get it under
[21:49] control he couldn't get his health under
[21:51] control he couldn't get his job under
[21:53] control his family finances
[21:55] relationships now that's just five areas
[21:58] right there
[21:59] now some people say there's more erors
[22:00] such as attitude priorities thinking
[22:03] commitments Faith generosity values and
[22:06] growth that's what John Maxwell thinks
[22:07] there's there's 12 domains in the human
[22:10] life but see that's what the real
[22:12] fivefold ministry will produce if we
[22:14] love God it makes us stable in all
[22:17] things we grow in our health we grow in
[22:20] our occupation we grow in our faith we
[22:22] grow in our relationships amen we become
[22:24] mature we become more stable in Christ
[22:27] hallelujah amen now is it Satan's job to
[22:30] shake every one of us yes right he's
[22:32] like a lion lion seeking whom he may
[22:35] devour but thank God Jesus came that we
[22:37] might have life and have it more
[22:39] abundantly praise God how many living in
[22:42] the Overflow today we almost s that one
[22:44] by God's grace but I thought I better
[22:45] limit this song
[22:48] service and look at verse 16 from whom
[22:51] the whole body fitly joined together see
[22:53] that's why the body of Christ needs one
[22:54] another we're joined together and we're
[22:57] compacted by that which every joint
[22:59] supplies see every Born Again believer
[23:01] provides something for the other
[23:03] believer that's why brother Ben was
[23:05] preaching to to us stay in your position
[23:07] amen right because that's what it says
[23:09] right here every joint you know every
[23:11] person has a joint or or you're
[23:13] connected somehow according to the
[23:15] effectual working in the measure of
[23:18] every part see every uh yeah every
[23:21] believer has a Measure of Faith as a
[23:23] measure of the one of the nine gifts of
[23:25] the Spirit perhaps more than one praise
[23:27] God Hallelujah and it makes increase of
[23:31] the body unto the edifying of itself in
[23:34] love so it is a love of God that works
[23:37] through every believer to edify one
[23:39] another to strengthen one another we got
[23:41] to have love love has to be our most
[23:44] important attribute hallelujah amen
[23:46] because the love of God Will Supply what
[23:49] we what the other person needs in the
[23:50] body of Christ
[23:53] Glory so the Bible said no I'm sorry now
[23:55] I'm going to Webster's Dictionary
[23:57] Webster's Dictionary agitate so tossed
[24:00] agitate means to excite often trouble
[24:02] the mind or trouble the feelings to
[24:06] disturb so again people disobedient to
[24:09] the five-fold will be disturbed in their
[24:12] mind and their feelings now we all get
[24:15] feelings Disturbed quite often right
[24:17] sometimes every
[24:19] day but it's a pattern we want to look
[24:21] at the pattern of Our Lives which
[24:23] direction is our life going is it more
[24:25] like Christ or we kind of just you know
[24:27] staying the same God help help us not to
[24:28] stay the same Hallelujah brother R says
[24:30] you really can't stay the same right we
[24:33] should see a trajectory of mostly going
[24:35] up kind of like the stock market right
[24:36] it should kind of be like that
[24:37] constantly going up right we should get
[24:39] Victory on Victory growing in grace and
[24:41] the knowledge of the Lord the word
[24:43] fluctuate in Webster's Dictionary means
[24:45] to shift back and forth
[24:48] uncertainly so see surprises you know
[24:51] sometimes people's character surprises
[24:53] us it shifts from good to bad like Eli
[24:56] like King Saul was just a classic
[24:57] example I think I counted there was 10
[25:00] or 11 shifts from good to bad good bad
[25:03] good bad bad bad bad good bad bad bad
[25:06] good it was it was constantly this man's
[25:09] life was uh it was a constant unstable
[25:12] life Hallelujah and church I looked it
[25:15] up that's what I was telling the
[25:16] children I tell my Lydia helped me on
[25:18] this one he killed 85
[25:21] priests and their families that's what
[25:24] the Bible says King Saul killed 85
[25:27] priests and then families on top of that
[25:30] and God still forgave that man that's
[25:33] why we sing about God's Amazing
[25:36] Grace Hallelujah that's why I told the
[25:37] children what I did after I turned off
[25:39] the live stream you know God can save to
[25:41] the
[25:42] utmost think about that God can wipe out
[25:45] 85 Plus murders in a moment prayer now
[25:48] look was he sincere he was up all night
[25:50] church on his face all night and all
[25:52] morning praying on his face remember
[25:55] that we just looked at that in 1st
[25:57] Samuel 28 that's sincerity see if a man
[26:00] or woman are sincere God will get down
[26:02] to business with you Hallelujah but if a
[26:05] person's wavering toss back and forth
[26:08] James says don't let that person think
[26:09] they're going to receive anything from
[26:11] God see even Saul had to get down to
[26:14] business he had to get on his face and
[26:16] lay before God and say take this uh uh
[26:18] spirit to kill David take this off me
[26:21] right take this off me and God did it
[26:24] how many know God's faithful amen oh my
[26:27] so agit
[26:30] fluctuating remember all those that
[26:32] oppose the true five-fold ministry will
[26:34] fluctuate by every wind of
[26:37] Doctrine
[26:39] Hallelujah we see that because a
[26:41] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[26:43] ways now I got a picture on my phone I'm
[26:45] not going to show it but Simon preached
[26:47] a sermon three years ago and brother
[26:49] Steven was sitting right there now he's
[26:50] got a baby him and Elizabeth there I'm
[26:52] just trying to uh what's his last name
[26:53] naava I think he changed it now he
[26:55] changed it to something else anyways
[26:56] brother Stephen and I was s right right
[26:58] be in the back and Simon put up three
[26:59] unstable scriptures and I thought oh my
[27:01] goodness something just struck me about
[27:03] that well this is the morning three
[27:04] years later I'm going to preach it
[27:05] praise God so there there's always a
[27:07] time and season for Everything James 18
[27:09] says a double-minded man is unstable in
[27:12] all his ways that's the one that impacts
[27:14] us when we need to know the will of God
[27:16] when we need the wisdom of God but it
[27:18] seems far away seems like God doesn't
[27:21] hear us anybody ever felt that like God
[27:22] didn't hear your prayer well you're not
[27:24] alone James says join the club he said
[27:27] but you better get get Faith amen you
[27:30] better seek God till you get a
[27:31] revelation praise God CU you're not
[27:33] we're not going to receive anything from
[27:34] God until we're determined that God hurt
[27:39] us now the other there's two more
[27:41] unstables in the scripture second Peter
[27:43] 214 and 15 now this is speaking of false
[27:46] preachers like balum uh I think Cain's
[27:49] even in this section if I'm not mistaken
[27:50] and Kora having eyes full of adultery
[27:53] again look again adultery just like
[27:54] Eli's sons and just like James chapter 4
[27:56] adultery sexual sin in the church
[27:59] and that cannot cease from sin they just
[28:01] can't get the
[28:02] victory you know church we ought to come
[28:04] to church sometimes and we're walking in
[28:07] Victory Hallelujah we all go through
[28:09] seasons of Trials Seasons when the enemy
[28:11] is fighting but let's thank God when it
[28:14] when it's our season when we're not
[28:15] fighting trials
[28:18] Hallelujah but see the but these people
[28:20] that are like balum uh who the other
[28:23] ones Kora forget the other one Kane yeah
[28:26] Kan
[28:28] they can't cease from sinning so Cain
[28:30] kept sinning wherever he went right
[28:33] balam kept sinning even though he didn't
[28:35] give a false prophecy he he was true to
[28:37] his gift in that sense of Prophecy he
[28:38] couldn't curse Israel but then he kept
[28:40] sinning he taught Israel to commit
[28:42] fornication isn't it interesting how
[28:43] sexual sin is always tied into these
[28:45] things man beguiling what do they do
[28:48] they beguile unstable Souls they deceive
[28:51] them like Eve was beguiled to morally or
[28:54] utterly
[28:56] seduce and heart they have exercised
[29:00] with Covetous practices curse children
[29:02] now just focus on that word remember
[29:04] Paul said in Timothy we should exercise
[29:06] ourselves unto what
[29:09] godliness so see Church what what
[29:11] matters is our daily lives our daily
[29:14] life is our exercise our spiritual
[29:16] exercise how many know that your
[29:18] exercise isn't going to be so much today
[29:20] it's going to be tomorrow and Tuesday
[29:23] and Wednesday that that's going to be
[29:25] your I mean you can exercise one day a
[29:26] week you'll get a little bit of benefit
[29:28] I I exercise usually one day a week
[29:29] maybe two you'll get a little bit of
[29:31] benefit but if you're exercising three
[29:33] or four times a week you're going to get
[29:34] a lot more benefits praise God so this
[29:37] is the the illustration he gives us we
[29:39] must ex ex I'm sorry we exercise
[29:43] exercise oursel unto godliness I can't
[29:45] say that word
[29:48] today but see these uh Sinners the false
[29:51] preachers they are exercised unto
[29:54] covetousness so see it's all about them
[29:56] the money women popularity
[29:58] it's all about them verse 15 they have
[30:01] forsaken the right way and have gone
[30:04] astray fing the way of balam the son of
[30:07] Boer who loved the wagees of rightness
[30:09] you look at what a person does for money
[30:11] many times you're going to find out
[30:12] where they stand with God sometimes how
[30:15] do they handle their money look at balum
[30:17] right look at all these people so see
[30:20] it's it's it's connected in there look
[30:21] at all these false preachers like I told
[30:22] you that preacher uh he just came out
[30:24] this week he was 73 years old he was one
[30:27] of the he was one of the Holiness
[30:28] preachers now of course they let their
[30:30] women wear pants but he was considered
[30:32] the Holiness preacher and he had a
[30:34] 5-year relationship with a 29 year old
[30:36] woman so 29 28 27 26 25 he's a 73 year
[30:40] old man thought to be the most one of
[30:42] the most holy
[30:43] preachers and see church people can hide
[30:46] these things for a long time but your
[30:47] sin's going to find you out Hallelujah
[30:50] that's right we must love uh we must
[30:53] love the wages of Holiness praise God
[30:55] Amen but these people love the wages of
[30:58] unrighteousness the popularity and you
[31:00] know what you know what he he confessed
[31:01] to he says it was because he traveled
[31:03] Alone by himself he didn't travel with
[31:05] his wife all the time and who knows who
[31:08] did a good job of that brother Bram and
[31:09] who also Billy Graham do you remember
[31:12] that brother BR said Billy Graham before
[31:13] he go into any hotel room he would send
[31:15] a man in there to check to make sure
[31:17] there was no women hiding in there
[31:18] because they they were that happened to
[31:19] him before they tried to tempt him with
[31:21] prostitutes bil Graham said that right
[31:24] they'd send a man there make sure
[31:25] there's nobody in there and Billy so
[31:26] Billy Graham never traveled alone
[31:29] right and how did this man fall in 2024
[31:32] actually 5 years earlier 2019 through
[31:35] just travel alone having all this free
[31:37] time without that
[31:40] accountability so see how much wisdom we
[31:42] can get from these preachers now I know
[31:44] Billy Graham got off as he got older but
[31:45] when he was in the beginning he was
[31:47] pretty faithful he was brother Ram said
[31:49] he preached salvation like nobody else
[31:50] could preach
[31:51] it right Hallelujah now he got off by
[31:54] the end he was basically saying it was
[31:56] okay to commit abortion by the end end
[31:58] he believed in
[31:59] abortion how does that happen my
[32:01] goodness but look at this here the wages
[32:05] of unrighteousness so see wherever the
[32:07] money's coming
[32:09] from if the people are Unfaithful
[32:12] they'll be devoted to the money and
[32:14] they'll they'll just follow the money
[32:16] right they usually say follow the money
[32:19] Trail is that right Hallelujah that's
[32:22] right Church my goodness so see so we
[32:25] see unstability or instability
[32:28] James says it they'll be in unstable in
[32:31] their ways of their life all their ways
[32:33] second Peter 2 says these preachers like
[32:36] balum
[32:37] unstable they can't stay on the way of
[32:39] right now second Peter 3:14 and remember
[32:42] Simon had this right up here so I'm kind
[32:43] of uh piggybacking his thought
[32:46] there maybe I should say eagle backing
[32:48] or something like
[32:51] that lamb
[32:53] backing second Peter 3:14 wherefore
[32:56] beloved seeing that you look for such
[32:58] things what the
[33:00] Millennium Hallelujah and the future
[33:02] home that's what he's talking about new
[33:03] Heavens new Earth be diligent that you
[33:05] be found of him in peace without spot
[33:08] and
[33:09] blameless and account that the
[33:11] longsuffering of the Lord is salvation
[33:13] see that's why time's going on there's
[33:14] nothing wrong with the bribe God's
[33:16] saving more souls Hallelujah that's why
[33:18] we're still here God still saving Souls
[33:21] amen
[33:23] hallelujah like a brother just texted me
[33:25] a brother texted me yesterday he said he
[33:27] was out in a meeting with brother Ben
[33:28] NAD in Arizona he said brother Jesse he
[33:30] said I can hardly contain myself I know
[33:32] I got the Holy Ghost now so I thought
[33:34] God bless brother
[33:35] Ben brother Ben picked him up from the
[33:37] airport they had Fellowship all weekend
[33:39] they went to all these meetings in a row
[33:40] God is still filling with the Holy Ghost
[33:42] you just got to bring an empty vessel
[33:44] Hallelujah he said bring your empty
[33:46] vessels not a few hallelujah amen God's
[33:49] still filling with the Holy
[33:51] Ghost and church he oh yeah that's right
[33:53] he uh he's from Northwestern United
[33:57] States so he traveled very far all the
[33:59] way down to Arizona to go to those
[34:01] meetings see God honors a
[34:03] sacrifice
[34:06] Hallelujah that's why God is holding off
[34:08] the Rapture that's why God is holding
[34:10] off the Millennium because God is still
[34:12] showing
[34:13] longsuffering even now look at verse 15
[34:16] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[34:18] according to the wisdom given unto him
[34:20] hath written you now leave that up there
[34:21] this is just struck me Peter calls Paul
[34:24] Beloved the same man that said you're to
[34:27] blame MH see now that's real Christian
[34:29] love right you can take rebuke some from
[34:32] somebody to their face and turn around
[34:35] and say that's my beloved
[34:38] brother oh that's real love right there
[34:40] amen right that's real Christian
[34:43] love oh I love it isn't that beautiful
[34:46] remember brother man said Paul brother
[34:48] man dramatized it he walked right up and
[34:50] put his finger under his nose and said
[34:51] you're the one to blame segregating
[34:54] against the
[34:55] Gentiles Hallelujah he said that's my
[34:57] beloved brother my beloved friend would
[34:59] do that to me praise God hallelujah
[35:02] verse
[35:04] 16 as also in all his Epistles speaking
[35:08] in them of these things which in which
[35:11] are some things hard to be understood
[35:13] how many remember when we preached
[35:14] through Romans some of those things were
[35:15] hard to
[35:18] understand now here here we go here
[35:20] we're getting to this uh fact where
[35:21] people turn away the fivefold ministry
[35:23] or they're double-minded which they that
[35:25] are unlearned so that means they don't
[35:27] study enough before they decide on a
[35:29] matter and the Bible said it's a shame
[35:31] and Folly to answer a matter before you
[35:33] hear it that's right right it's a shame
[35:37] it's a f it's foolishness to say there's
[35:40] no such thing as serpent seed if you
[35:41] haven't studied it out praise
[35:44] God that's
[35:47] right they're unlearned they don't pray
[35:50] brother they don't pray enough they
[35:52] don't fast enough they don't seek God
[35:53] enough they don't study their Bibles
[35:54] enough to really get the revelation of
[35:56] it that's right right what do they do
[35:59] they're unlearned and they're
[36:02] unstable what do they do they rest that
[36:04] means twist like a serpent like a
[36:06] serpent twist
[36:08] right that's what the so he connects
[36:10] them back to uh to
[36:12] balum see these these people these false
[36:15] preachers they'll preach the prophet's
[36:17] message but they're twisting it for
[36:20] their cursed
[36:22] practices that's right Hallelujah
[36:25] remember the wages of
[36:29] righteousness Hallelujah where do they
[36:31] do that as they also do other scriptures
[36:35] unto their own destruction now these are
[36:37] people that are lost now these are lost
[36:40] preachers so I'm not talking about
[36:41] foolish virgin preachers I'm talking
[36:43] about lost preachers so the Lost
[36:46] preachers will twist the scriptures for
[36:49] the wages of unrighteousness or women or
[36:53] popularity or money now money and
[36:55] popularity often go together right
[36:56] because you've got a big church you
[36:57] become the big you become the big
[36:58] preacher right you become the big guy on
[37:00] the on the Block verse 17 ye therefore
[37:04] beloved seeing ye know these things
[37:07] before beware less also being led ye
[37:10] also rather being led away with the air
[37:13] of the wicked fall from your own
[37:15] steadfastness so there see there's the
[37:17] toss there's the
[37:19] instability see church God wants us to
[37:23] steadfastly to eagerly do what's right
[37:25] all the time amen how many still got the
[37:28] fear of the Lord we preach on that one
[37:30] brother uh texted me he said he Saidi
[37:32] just listened to all your three fear of
[37:33] the Lords he said ' I was so encouraged
[37:35] he said I wept I shouted I cried I
[37:37] screamed God gave me the victory over
[37:39] depression he' been bow in depression
[37:40] all week I said Thank God Amen that's
[37:43] what the fear the Lord will do amen
[37:45] it'll bring back your love for God your
[37:47] reverence for God hallelujah
[37:51] amen so that and that's a precious
[37:53] brother who battled a lot of health
[37:54] problems he B he told me he batt a lot
[37:56] of health problems sometimes he felt
[37:58] like he couldn't even get up out of the
[37:59] bed and he was feeling sorry for himself
[38:01] so he got depressed but he watched those
[38:03] videos and the fear of the Lord anointed
[38:05] him Hallelujah to get up and trust God
[38:08] hallelujah Not To
[38:10] Doubt amen God bless that man I know his
[38:12] name
[38:13] too see so so instability will c will
[38:18] will cause you to fall away from being
[38:20] steadfast marching forward Hallelujah I
[38:25] love verse 18 but growing
[38:28] Grace and in knowledge of the Lord and
[38:31] Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both
[38:34] now and forever amen those are Peter's
[38:36] last words before he's martyred right
[38:38] shortly after that he's martyred what's
[38:39] his last words grow in the grace and
[38:41] knowledge of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[38:44] have more grace have more knowledge more
[38:47] understanding of the riches of Christ's
[38:49] Grace hallelujah oh it's
[38:52] beautiful now I'm just going to give you
[38:53] a simple example here I've done it
[38:55] before but I just thought it would be a
[38:56] perfect time to add this in because it's
[38:58] speaking of the five full
[39:01] ministry friends have you heard me say
[39:03] before brandom Tabernacle is resting or
[39:06] twisting many scriptures now I'm not
[39:09] saying they're the the destroyed group
[39:11] but they're certainly off the word of
[39:13] God they're twisting the
[39:15] scripture which means to pervert or
[39:19] change it these are the five main areas
[39:21] remember they neglect the preaching gift
[39:23] so they're basically telling preachers
[39:25] go bury your gift in the ground that's
[39:27] what they're telling them to
[39:28] do right sit down and bury your gift
[39:32] Don't Preach now how many I hope I hope
[39:35] the devil's not uh bwing anybody today
[39:37] and say I wish brother Jesse would stop
[39:39] preaching right but but that that's the
[39:41] idea right that's the idea that that
[39:43] brandom Tabernacle I'll just oh just
[39:45] press play you don't have to
[39:47] preach second they neglect Gathering
[39:51] more as we see that day
[39:53] approaching right they haven't had a
[39:55] church service since March 20 20 20
[39:58] they've not physically gathered in
[40:00] church since March of 2020 when the
[40:03] Indiana shut them down the state of
[40:06] Indiana because they have too many
[40:06] people right you remember that you had
[40:08] you had to have like six feet between
[40:09] every person remember that bu of
[40:11] nonsense and then now they admit it's
[40:13] wrong well this one's going to get cut
[40:14] off of YouTube eventually in two years
[40:16] their Bots will finally chase us down
[40:18] say we removed your sermon from YouTube
[40:20] go ahead and remove it Mercy God's word
[40:23] cannot be stopped
[40:25] Hallelujah see they haven't gathered Ed
[40:28] since two since March
[40:30] 2020 I'm just going to say this if if
[40:32] those PE if those leaders had a real
[40:34] Shepherd's Heart they would at least use
[40:36] the facilities that they got they got
[40:38] brandom Tabernacle you can sit 300
[40:40] people in there they have the the the
[40:42] youth building you can sit at least like
[40:44] 500 in there why not at least Gather in
[40:46] those two and do like a satellite church
[40:48] like Elevation Church does I think they
[40:50] have uh 12 Satellite churches for Steven
[40:53] fdick all these churches around the
[40:55] nation they all just sing they got their
[40:57] live bands and they all sit down and
[40:59] watch the screen at pastor pastor fdick
[41:01] preaching with his big guns right
[41:03] there his big muscles see so because
[41:07] what did Brother Bram do when brother
[41:09] Bram had Construction in in early 1963
[41:12] did they still meet in the brandom
[41:13] Tabernacle yes and what did they do they
[41:16] just let if there's an overflow he said
[41:18] you got to sit in your cars and you know
[41:19] what he did he got radios like at a
[41:21] drive-through theater you could set the
[41:23] radio on your
[41:25] window that's a pastor's heart
[41:28] at least come to
[41:30] church at least gather Moors to see that
[41:32] day approaching but for four years
[41:35] they've neglected the Gathering Together
[41:37] of the Saints praise God and you know
[41:39] they they have communion today at 5 o'
[41:41] and so that uh everybody can drive by
[41:44] this weekend anybody could drive by the
[41:46] Tabernacle and pick up the wine they
[41:47] need for communion so it's just like a
[41:49] it's like a fast food thing like just
[41:51] stop in get my wine see I'm going to go
[41:53] have church in my house except brother
[41:55] Bram never did that right right except
[41:58] look at that there's no preacher serving
[42:00] them the the bread ah see they've
[42:02] neglected the five-fold ministry they
[42:05] become their own that's the Book of
[42:06] Judges right there the glory they become
[42:08] their own judges right they become their
[42:09] own priests my goodness gracious there's
[42:12] no Pastor there's no preacher to feed
[42:14] them the Bread and Wine and next Sunday
[42:16] we've got communion praise God brother R
[42:18] said it's a showdown
[42:20] Hallelujah that's right to Showdown are
[42:22] we with the word are we believing the
[42:24] word of God and as I've said before I
[42:26] encourage everybody to take communion
[42:28] every time because I don't see many
[42:30] people I don't see brother random
[42:31] sitting out of communion when he was
[42:32] going through tough times right we
[42:34] talked about that I preached over that
[42:36] recently I would say always take it but
[42:38] make sure you take it with a pure heart
[42:40] because many are weak and sickly among
[42:42] you if they don't discern the Lord's
[42:44] body praise God that's right amen
[42:48] hallelujah three they add so much to
[42:51] brother braham's word they say so much
[42:52] brother Braham didn't say fourth they
[42:55] add to the Bible and they changed the
[42:57] Bible which fifth ultimately leads to
[43:01] idolatry so that's what I believe and
[43:04] remember Brother Joseph is 69 years old
[43:05] he was born in 1955 he'll be 70 years
[43:08] old next
[43:09] year and that that church back in 2010
[43:12] had $110
[43:13] million saved up in bank accounts and
[43:16] assets and everything like that where
[43:17] are they at now the reason they had to
[43:19] build the church was because they have
[43:20] over 1,000 people and they didn't have a
[43:23] congregation for a thousand people so
[43:25] many people have moved into
[43:26] Jeffersonville
[43:29] so how how much tithing can you get out
[43:30] of a thousand people maybe 250 tithe
[43:32] payers there and it's all flowing in
[43:35] nobody's coming to church they're just
[43:36] sitting at home see Church which one is
[43:39] it money women or popularity I'd say
[43:40] it's two of them that caus them to twist
[43:44] the scriptures brother brandom fulfilled
[43:47] all the five full ministry I'm sorry
[43:48] that's a twisting of a
[43:50] serpent Hallelujah he did not but oh you
[43:54] can sit at home while we're having
[43:55] construction that's a twisting of thep
[43:57] scripture brother Ram never did that he
[43:58] never said that Hallelujah see that uh
[44:02] every word on tape is thus say the Lord
[44:04] I'm sorry brother Ram never said that
[44:05] hallelujah it's twisting it like a
[44:08] serpent twists around its
[44:10] prey choking them so much they won't
[44:13] even gather together more as they see
[44:14] that day
[44:16] approaching in
[44:19] 2017 I watched the video this morning of
[44:22] Brother Joseph saying I never told
[44:23] people to leave the churches and just
[44:25] play the tapes well look what happened
[44:26] he now led them into
[44:29] that seven years later that's what he's
[44:32] LED them into he says I've never done
[44:34] that that's what he's
[44:35] done
[44:37] right the next year see actions speak
[44:40] louder than words anybody can say
[44:42] whatever they want it's how you act
[44:44] that's right it's how you actually the
[44:46] words you say the actions you do the way
[44:48] you live your life how you exercise
[44:51] yourself whether unto uh righteousness
[44:53] or
[44:54] unrighteousness that's what matters
[44:56] praise God and then remember the very
[44:57] next year brother Joseph said they've
[44:59] got to catch the vision they've got to
[45:01] play the tapes I'm sorry you can't do
[45:03] both you can't say I'm for the five-fold
[45:06] ministry preaching and then say no
[45:07] they've got to play the tapes you can't
[45:09] say that you got to say one or the other
[45:11] praise God and see they've made their
[45:13] stand but thank God the true bride has
[45:15] made her stand as well amen Lord let
[45:17] your bride come forth
[45:19] Hallelujah and remember in 2020 and I
[45:22] want to show you remember I mentioned
[45:23] this this is the tossing of the waves in
[45:26] 2020 Joseph said let's elect Pete Buddha
[45:29] remember he was running for president
[45:32] too they said brother brother Joseph I
[45:35] heard him say he said get that gay man
[45:36] in there so we can go home that's what
[45:38] he said and everybody's clapping and
[45:40] screaming so so see he somehow he thinks
[45:43] a gay president means the Rapture
[45:45] where's the bible say that anybody got a
[45:46] Bible verse for that I'll be waiting
[45:47] brother William I've sent lots of
[45:49] messages I'm I'm really studying the
[45:51] scripture to see where it ever says that
[45:53] does that is that the sign of the
[45:54] Rapture no two years later
[45:57] uh with the war in Ukraine he said look
[45:58] there's the war going on we'll be going
[46:00] home anytime soon so see they go from
[46:03] this they go from Pete budajudge then
[46:05] they go to war in Ukraine and then was
[46:07] the war in
[46:09] Israel all these are supposed to be
[46:11] signs that they're the true bride
[46:15] church right in 2020 they finished their
[46:18] church building we saw it right Carris
[46:20] and Victoria we saw we took pictures
[46:21] with it
[46:23] like this is an empty church it should
[46:25] be filled but it's an empty church
[46:27] they're not Gathering more see I'm a
[46:28] witness they they're breaking uh Hebrews
[46:30] 10:24 and
[46:32] 25 they finished it in
[46:35] 2022 but it still remains empty no one's
[46:38] Gathering more as they see that day
[46:40] approaching did Brother Ram teach that
[46:42] absolutely not
[46:45] Hallelujah and now they're having
[46:47] communion in homes rather than with a
[46:49] preacher giving them the bread and the
[46:51] wine as Jesus modeled Hallelujah Jesus
[46:54] said happy are ye if you do this
[46:56] remember remembering my death till you
[46:57] come remember next Sunday communion by
[47:00] God's
[47:01] grace remember Church they got they got
[47:04] 25
[47:06] lives uh four times they've called
[47:09] themselves the tape bride think about
[47:11] that tape bride everybody hear me on
[47:13] that let me say it again they call
[47:14] themselves they're the tape bride um
[47:17] does that does that come up if you
[47:18] search the quotes no it don't come up oh
[47:21] so they've added something to the bride
[47:24] yeah of course they have they've added
[47:25] some twisting of the scripture
[47:28] three times Joseph says it in 2024 July
[47:30] he said we are sure and we are not
[47:32] ashamed to tell the world we are your
[47:34] tape bride Sorry God don't have a tape
[47:36] bride he's got a five-fold
[47:38] bride he's got the fivefold until we all
[47:41] come in the unity of the faith
[47:43] hallelujah
[47:45] amen he said in September of 2023 he
[47:49] said dear tape bride what a day we're
[47:51] living in what a great time the
[47:52] Mysteries the secrets all that's being
[47:53] revealed to us every day Oh you mean
[47:55] like uh every word on tape is thus sayi
[47:57] the Lord I'm sorry that's not a
[47:58] revelation from God that's a revelation
[48:00] from the
[48:01] enemy because that exalts brother
[48:03] brandham as equal with God you'd be
[48:05] surprised how many people send me
[48:07] comments and say uh brother you follow
[48:10] William brandom how can you make his
[48:11] every word thus sayith the Lord see
[48:13] that's the connotation people have that
[48:16] if you follow brother brandom every word
[48:18] he said was th thus say the Lord I said
[48:19] when did I ever say that I said brother
[48:22] R is a prophet of God but prophets make
[48:24] human mistakes they're only infallible
[48:26] with thus say the Lord thank God we've
[48:28] got thus sayith the Lord hallelujah but
[48:30] see that's the connotation around that
[48:32] the devil's told so many lies on it but
[48:34] thank God that we've got the truth thank
[48:36] God that the Holy Ghost is uniting us
[48:38] hallelujah under the fivefold ministry
[48:39] into all truth hallelujah amen and
[48:41] they're the ones that let the women
[48:43] preach and let the women cut their hair
[48:45] and watch filthy movies and get filled
[48:46] with demons por porn demons all these
[48:48] things depressed demons all these uh uh
[48:51] cigarette demons alcoholic demons they
[48:53] get all these demons in them and they
[48:54] say we're the ones off tear the ones off
[48:57] amen whose whose works are exercised
[49:00] unto godliness God help us to see that's
[49:02] one of the greatest blessings we have is
[49:04] that we exercise ourselves unto
[49:06] godliness Hallelujah because remember
[49:08] the false Church uh the Bible said we
[49:10] have more and more
[49:12] ungodliness that remember preach that on
[49:14] avoiding uh vain babblings they increase
[49:16] unto more ungodliness so see Church
[49:19] you're going we are going one one way or
[49:21] the other thank God we can look at our
[49:22] lives today as I said on Wednesday thank
[49:24] God we can look down at our fruit
[49:25] baskets then we look at get your fruit
[49:27] bastic this week you got some good love
[49:29] in there got some good uh longsuffering
[49:31] in there got some joy in there anybody
[49:33] got any gladness today amen but you
[49:36] really need it for other people that's
[49:38] why you need those
[49:39] fruits right look down at yourself you
[49:43] know I always see Haven carrying in the
[49:44] basket of eggs well that's kind of what
[49:45] we do we carrying the fruits of the holy
[49:47] spirit in the church show some love so
[49:49] show some longsuffering have have some
[49:51] Faith praise God amen amen that's what
[49:54] we should show
[49:57] but brother uh William how come my list
[49:59] of these false brandom Tabernacle
[50:01] doctrines how come that keeps increasing
[50:03] more and
[50:04] more right it used to be 10 I was
[50:08] looking at my notes I used to have
[50:10] started with seven I had seven false
[50:11] doctrines then it went to 10 then went
[50:13] to 20 now I'm at
[50:16] 25 and they're never repenting of
[50:18] anything now church I'm not saying pat
[50:20] yourself on the back I'm saying let's
[50:22] realize the impact of the fful ministry
[50:24] on our
[50:25] lives let's make sure were really
[50:27] obeying the word of
[50:30] God see because it's going to produce
[50:32] it's it's supposed to produce this Bible
[50:35] preached by men who are filled with the
[50:36] Holy Ghost are it's supposed to preach
[50:39] and produce maturity the fullness of
[50:42] Christ in your life not the fullness of
[50:44] the godhead body that was only Jesus but
[50:47] the the full maturity of a Christian
[50:49] that's what this Bible is supposed to
[50:50] produce if you eat the book amen
[50:53] hallelujah amen that's what it's
[50:55] supposed to produce
[50:57] right but we'll all be tempted on our
[50:58] journey we all be tempted there'll be
[51:00] traps laid there where it'll try to make
[51:02] us double-minded or traps certain places
[51:03] we got to bypass the traps praise God we
[51:06] got to bypass those and we got to keep
[51:08] pressing on with a single mind we got to
[51:10] be steadfast the Bible says how many
[51:12] want to be steadfast
[51:13] amen that's what the fivefold ministry
[51:16] helps us
[51:18] do
[51:20] Hallelujah and again he said it in uh
[51:22] December
[51:23] 2020 dear resting ones
[51:27] he said we're happy because we're eating
[51:28] the Holy Ghost food that doesn't have a
[51:30] bone or a seed in it and yet brother Ram
[51:31] said his sermons have seeds in
[51:33] them again saying something brother Ram
[51:36] didn't
[51:37] say it's these people are insane they're
[51:41] they're just
[51:42] insane he says we call it tape food for
[51:45] a tape
[51:48] Bride come on that's what I say to come
[51:50] on brother that's why I just stopped
[51:52] giving up I sent about 50 emails after
[51:54] I'm like I give up they're probably not
[51:56] even getting to him I just can pray for
[51:57] him but see at least they email me he
[52:00] emailed me back at the beginning he
[52:01] actually wrote me a letter back at the
[52:02] beginning which I greatly appreciate but
[52:04] my last email was brother does the third
[52:07] person of the Trinity burn in your heart
[52:09] did I show you
[52:11] that and he he just wrote back one
[52:13] sentence he said brother Jesse I believe
[52:16] every word on the tapes is from the Lord
[52:19] okay so that I just wanted a yes or no
[52:21] answer that wasn't a yes or no answer so
[52:23] he's basically saying yes the third
[52:25] person of the Trinity draws in my heart
[52:26] well how many people do you have in your
[52:28] heart then how many people are
[52:30] possessing
[52:31] you hallelujah how many
[52:34] people see now that's now to me that's
[52:38] ears that can't
[52:40] hear right that's a unstable person that
[52:45] can't take anything back to the word of
[52:47] God you mean you can't take three
[52:49] persons and and look at a quote that was
[52:51] in 1953 so you can't look eight years
[52:53] later where brother man says three
[52:55] persons is thus say the Lord you can't
[52:56] look at that understand brother brandom
[52:58] just he corrected himself no he's got to
[53:00] so correct or so worship and adore every
[53:03] word of his father on tape that's an
[53:05] idolatrous Spirit you can't and you
[53:08] can't even look church we should be able
[53:09] to look at our own lives what things
[53:11] have we understood better now that we're
[53:13] further along the
[53:14] road goodness I told you that one
[53:16] example uh sister Zur sent me that
[53:18] message for brother Brooks was preaching
[53:19] in 2007 and uh he said Paul could not
[53:23] have lived in this day he said so we've
[53:25] got we've got to have the greatest Faith
[53:27] there ever was and I stood up and said
[53:29] amen and now I I think no Paul
[53:31] definitely could have lived in this
[53:33] day right because we're all growing in
[53:35] the understanding I see things I don't
[53:38] amen anymore right because I understand
[53:40] things better praise God I say it like
[53:42] this my Zeal doesn't eat up my wisdom as
[53:46] much some of you caught that good
[53:49] because you understand I'm not saying
[53:51] I'm perfect I'm far from perfect but one
[53:53] thing that for for sure this word is
[53:55] perfect am and we should see ourselves
[53:58] by love edifying one another right
[54:02] through the love of the Holy Spirit uh
[54:04] The Joint supplying all that we have
[54:06] need of and we should be seeing
[54:08] ourselves mature in the stature of
[54:10] Christ
[54:13] Hallelujah that's
[54:15] right the Bible doesn't call them tape
[54:17] bride Bible just says his wife has made
[54:20] herself ready she's the bride she's the
[54:23] one Paul wrote about Hallelujah
[54:26] let let me go through these 24 lies real
[54:28] quick I got it it's only 11 I got plenty
[54:31] of time Hallelujah not even 12:00
[54:34] usually 12 I'm like okay I better finish
[54:35] up here I still got half an hour the
[54:38] first lie every word on tape is thus say
[54:40] the Lord tapes can never be wrong tapes
[54:42] have no mistakes tapes have every answer
[54:44] number two all the answers are on the
[54:46] tapes number three un and Joseph says
[54:49] this unquestionably believe everything
[54:50] on the tape in other words pull off your
[54:52] discernment you don't need discernment
[54:54] anymore I I've got the video videos all
[54:56] these number four every church is a tape
[55:01] church and you've got to press play on
[55:02] the tape it's a it's a false vision of a
[55:04] denominational mandate he said every
[55:06] church has got to play the tapes number
[55:09] five the tapes are the
[55:11] token that means like I said that means
[55:13] my phone has the token brother because I
[55:14] have all brother BR sermons on here my
[55:17] how is my phone born
[55:20] again looks like it's just getting older
[55:22] all the time don't look like it's born
[55:23] to me I got to keep cleaning it don't
[55:24] look like it's born again verse I'm
[55:26] sorry the sixth lie tape boys are the
[55:28] true five-fold Ministry tape is the
[55:31] primary Ministry preaching is secondary
[55:33] brother brandom said opposite brother
[55:34] said tapes are secondary I've got the
[55:37] quotes on the video number seven Billy
[55:40] Paul bless his soul my wife prayed for
[55:41] him the 9 he died she come up for prayer
[55:43] crying for Billy Paul Billy Paul said
[55:46] brother random was uh equal to Jesus in
[55:49] every way except the Corporal body
[55:51] that's a lie that means brother Mam's
[55:53] soul and mind was exactly like Jesus
[55:55] that's impossible brother Maham sinned
[55:57] many times he said I make thousands of
[55:59] mistakes number eight they call they
[56:01] called anyone Deus who doesn't play
[56:03] tapes so we're a Deus I'm not a Deus I'm
[56:07] a Paul I'm a Timothy or something like
[56:09] that I'm not a Paul I'm a Timothy you
[56:10] know I follow the prophet because they
[56:13] said brother Bram is dead but uh he
[56:15] still got a living Ministry I'm sorry
[56:17] once you die like like God told Moses
[56:19] God told Moses you're going to die and I
[56:21] need a man to stand in your place to
[56:23] lead the people in and out and church
[56:25] isn't he the same yesterday today and
[56:26] forever
[56:27] am right
[56:31] Hallelujah number nine uh they said
[56:33] Revelation 2216 is Jesus telling us to
[56:36] be tape churches but no it was uh Jesus
[56:39] telling us is Jesus telling us to listen
[56:41] to all the letters right in the Book of
[56:44] Revelation he said uh he said uh uh make
[56:47] make sure the churches hear the letters
[56:49] that that that he gave to John it's to
[56:52] they totally they totally twist these
[56:54] scriptures they suck the life out of the
[56:56] the people number 10 they said the angel
[56:59] of revelation 22 6-9 is brother brandham
[57:02] so they say brother Bram is revealing to
[57:03] John all these Mysteries I'm sorry
[57:05] there's no pre-existence of souls
[57:08] brother Ram plainly taught us that they
[57:10] said brother Ram do you believe in the
[57:11] pre the Mormon pre-existence of souls do
[57:13] you see this I just struck
[57:16] me Mormonism has infiltrated brandom
[57:19] Tabernacle they got a false prophet and
[57:22] they got pre-existence of
[57:24] souls right they' got a false prophet
[57:27] like Joseph
[57:28] Smith and they've got PRI instance of
[57:31] Souls and brother said I he said I know
[57:33] you're wondering if I believe in that I
[57:34] do not believe in that well then how
[57:37] could brother R exist to reveal the Book
[57:39] of Revelation to St John if there's no
[57:41] pre-existence of
[57:44] souls oh my help us Lord number 11 they
[57:47] say the absolute are the tapes no
[57:49] they're not the absolute points us to
[57:50] the
[57:51] tapes brother Bram said an absolute is
[57:54] all powerful
[57:56] Unlimited in power Hallelujah and
[57:59] brother R said I don't have all the
[58:00] power brother R said actually I have no
[58:03] power Jose Lopez has no power but he's
[58:06] got
[58:07] Authority amen hallelujah brother
[58:10] William you have no power but you've got
[58:12] Authority Hallelujah but see the
[58:14] absolute has all power that's the word
[58:17] of
[58:17] God number 12 then they name calls make
[58:20] Believers or unbelievers those who don't
[58:22] play tapes in church they say we're make
[58:24] Believers number 13 they say and he said
[58:27] this thus sayith the Lord brandom
[58:28] Tabernacles in the perfect will of God
[58:29] by playing the tapes while decreasing
[58:31] live preaching I'm sorry I just can't go
[58:33] along with that you can't be in the
[58:34] perfect will of God and you can't you
[58:36] can't be in the perfect will of God and
[58:37] change one thing Paul
[58:39] said one thing yet they've Chang many
[58:43] things but if they change one thing Paul
[58:45] said they cannot be in the perfect will
[58:47] of
[58:48] God number 14 they say brandham
[58:51] Tabernacle is the greatest Christians of
[58:52] all time I've made a video on that I got
[58:54] the screenshot they haven't changed it I
[58:55] checked they didn't take it down they
[58:57] still think they're the greatest
[58:58] Christians of all time and they don't go
[59:00] to church brother
[59:01] William they say brother R was the
[59:03] greatest prophet of all time and Joseph
[59:06] said I've got the greatest Ministry of
[59:08] all time just to press play he said I've
[59:10] got the greatest Ministry of all time oh
[59:13] then he said Billy Paul was the most
[59:14] blessed person on the earth because he
[59:17] got to know brother brandom the Most
[59:18] Blessed see the
[59:20] greatest it's all about who's the
[59:22] greatest the pride of life
[59:26] God help us to be humble in this
[59:29] time but the question is can we be
[59:31] content with being
[59:33] humble can we be content with
[59:35] that and not have to have more Applause
[59:38] to our name oh yes Jesse yes brother
[59:40] Jesse yes yes brother William yes yes
[59:43] Malachi
[59:45] yes can we just stand with God's word
[59:47] whether people clap or
[59:49] not that's what God wants to see
[59:52] Hallelujah stand up stand up for Jesus
[59:55] ye sold soers of the Cross Hallelujah he
[59:58] said prophets are not judged they he
[1:00:00] said prophets cannot be corrected that's
[1:00:02] number 15 I'm almost there he said
[1:00:04] prophets do not make mistakes and yet
[1:00:06] even Joseph corrects his dad on tape I
[1:00:08] have a video of that he corrects his dad
[1:00:11] because there's a quote brother said
[1:00:12] there can't be any more time there can't
[1:00:14] be another generation and Joseph on tape
[1:00:16] says well look God has had Grace on us
[1:00:18] and now there is another generation he
[1:00:20] actually corrects his dad and yet he's
[1:00:22] the one that says you can't correct it
[1:00:24] my
[1:00:24] dad oh God help us what would daddy say
[1:00:27] my goodness number 16 they say brother
[1:00:29] Ram is their Pastor no dead man can be
[1:00:31] your pastor right can't marry you can't
[1:00:33] bury you you know can't dedicate you
[1:00:35] can't do those things he can't feed you
[1:00:37] the word of
[1:00:38] God number uh that was number 16 yeah
[1:00:42] brand T brother Bram is their Pastor
[1:00:44] that's why it gets into spir
[1:00:46] spiritualism because even with their
[1:00:48] email this weekend they they have a
[1:00:50] recording they say Press Play Let
[1:00:52] brother brandham pray for the symbols
[1:00:54] the bread and the wine he said they said
[1:00:56] brother brandham is going to pray for
[1:00:58] our
[1:00:59] symbols and then brother br's going to
[1:01:01] pray for us while we wash one another's
[1:01:02] feet like acting like he still alive and
[1:01:05] he said wait until brother R prays then
[1:01:07] partake of communion because now it's
[1:01:09] been blessed by the
[1:01:12] pastor these people that's all I can say
[1:01:15] these people see how much they hate the
[1:01:18] five full ministry church I've told you
[1:01:21] no one's treated me worse online than
[1:01:22] the Bram Tabernacle people call me Judas
[1:01:25] up and down devil Satan all these things
[1:01:28] all because I stood on other quotes that
[1:01:30] they don't like because I got quotes
[1:01:32] from my side brother Jose you know I got
[1:01:33] quotes we got
[1:01:35] quotes we got quotes amen right no one's
[1:01:39] been more harsh to me and that's okay
[1:01:42] they can do whatever they want I'm
[1:01:44] almost done 17 they don't gather more uh
[1:01:48] as we see that day approaching and they
[1:01:49] claim to have home tape churches which
[1:01:52] do not exist in the Bible number 18 they
[1:01:55] said like life only comes through the
[1:01:56] tapes it doesn't come through preaching
[1:01:58] I don't know about you but how many got
[1:01:59] a good blessing from a preacher lately
[1:02:01] we had a lot of preachers in 2024 we
[1:02:04] needed a little break here financially
[1:02:05] but also TimeWise as well they said it
[1:02:08] only comes through tapes it doesn't come
[1:02:09] through
[1:02:11] preachers now we know it comes through
[1:02:13] Christ but it's through the five-fold
[1:02:19] ministry all right next one I got a
[1:02:20] scroll I didn't get them all in the same
[1:02:22] place number 19 God's program is to
[1:02:25] press
[1:02:26] which deletes the five-fold ministry
[1:02:28] brother brother said God's program is
[1:02:29] preaching the word of God there's exact
[1:02:31] quotes on the exact opposite side just
[1:02:34] brother said don't change a thing number
[1:02:37] 20 Joseph said we're now in the wedding
[1:02:38] ceremony brother R says the wedding
[1:02:40] ceremony is the
[1:02:42] rapture right that's why I preach
[1:02:44] invisible Union we're only we're only
[1:02:46] United invisibly to Christ not
[1:02:47] physically the wedding ceremony hasn't
[1:02:49] happened yet he said we're going to the
[1:02:51] meeting in the air that's the wedding
[1:02:52] ceremony number 21 the tapes are God
[1:02:55] speaking lip to ear to Joseph and his
[1:02:58] church that's what he
[1:02:59] says that was and lip to ear is not even
[1:03:02] in the Bible it's mouth to mouth in
[1:03:05] numbers 128 God said I'll speak with
[1:03:07] Moses mouth to mouth so lip to ear is
[1:03:11] not even the scripture it's mouth to
[1:03:12] mouth or face to
[1:03:13] face right but they believe if you press
[1:03:16] play it's God speaking to us just like
[1:03:18] it's God in in our face see they' made
[1:03:20] God the tape everybody see that now
[1:03:22] everybody the God is now the tape
[1:03:26] God is not the Holy Spirit we say God is
[1:03:28] the tape because every word from the
[1:03:30] tape is thus sayith the Lord that that's
[1:03:33] what they say not I
[1:03:37] say all right I'm GNA try to build this
[1:03:40] up eventually so I can get some amens
[1:03:41] back in the church I know this makes us
[1:03:43] kind of feel bad but I just I want you
[1:03:44] to see what the fivefold ministry should
[1:03:47] produce and I I have to I want to show
[1:03:49] you the contrast I haven't done this for
[1:03:50] a long time church right I haven't I
[1:03:53] haven't really blasted you know the
[1:03:54] brandom Tabernacle for a while but I
[1:03:56] want you to see this is what a
[1:03:58] double-minded condition brings you to so
[1:04:01] far off my goodness you're off on here
[1:04:04] on the tapes you're off on preaching
[1:04:06] you're off on the pastor you're just off
[1:04:08] on
[1:04:10] everything tossed back and forth oh Pete
[1:04:13] Buddha Jud is a sign of the Rapture no
[1:04:15] no it's Ukraine no no no it's Israel and
[1:04:17] Hamas what's the next one Camala is is
[1:04:21] Cala the sign of the
[1:04:24] Rapture the sign of the r Rapture is
[1:04:26] that we love his appearing glory and the
[1:04:28] fivefold is uniting the church into one
[1:04:31] Faith hallelujah
[1:04:32] amen other words the latter rain amen
[1:04:35] abing faith is striking the church and
[1:04:37] it'll bring her right back to where they
[1:04:39] were at the beginning that's thus sayi
[1:04:41] the Lord from Joel 223 through 26 Amen
[1:04:44] in her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[1:04:47] hallelujah amen that doesn't mean that
[1:04:49] doesn't mean you and I have to produce
[1:04:51] all of Pentecost it just means we have
[1:04:53] to do our
[1:04:54] share amen amen Church how many people
[1:04:57] do you think how many people are
[1:04:58] recorded telling a paralyzed man to rise
[1:05:00] up and walk oh we just talked about that
[1:05:02] didn't we
[1:05:04] um like Peter Peter the Bible only
[1:05:08] records one person doing that it wasn't
[1:05:10] like every person had the power oh such
[1:05:12] as I have give I Thee such as I have
[1:05:14] give I Thee such as see we we think
[1:05:16] about the Rapture and uh rapturing Faith
[1:05:19] like all of us are going to be speaking
[1:05:20] the storms and and raising people up and
[1:05:22] emptying out the hospitals but is that
[1:05:24] exactly what the Bible says says the
[1:05:27] Bible doesn't say that that's just what
[1:05:29] some people make of it see I want to be
[1:05:32] mature I want to know the fullness of
[1:05:33] Pentecost is going to be in our church
[1:05:35] but we've only got to do what God's
[1:05:36] called us to do there's no pressure on
[1:05:39] it right there's not pressure it's just
[1:05:40] the love of God working in your heart
[1:05:42] see Peter already had that he said such
[1:05:44] as I have amen glory he already had he's
[1:05:47] like I know I've got this in me I know
[1:05:49] God's revealed this to me I seen a
[1:05:50] vision hallelujah praise God such as I
[1:05:53] have see God's going to lead you
[1:05:56] uh to minister your gifts right God is
[1:05:58] going to lead you into the ministry of
[1:05:59] gifts by the grace of God just like at
[1:06:01] Pentecost God will do what God wants to
[1:06:04] do praise
[1:06:05] God not what we want to do that's
[1:06:09] right right like I I how many how many
[1:06:12] wouldn't want to speak salvation to
[1:06:14] their parents right or their uh best
[1:06:17] friends or their co-workers or their
[1:06:18] children who wouldn't want to be a Hatty
[1:06:20] right right but not everybody was a
[1:06:23] Hatty
[1:06:23] right not every not everybody got the
[1:06:26] power of the spoken word it's you and I
[1:06:28] staying obedient Glory it's you and I
[1:06:30] staying stable in the word of God until
[1:06:32] God wants to pick up this vessel now I'm
[1:06:34] going to use this vessel for the glory
[1:06:36] of God hallelujah I filled this vessel
[1:06:39] now it's time for me to use this vessel
[1:06:40] I know right where that vessel's at I'm
[1:06:42] going to go get that vessel I want a
[1:06:43] real good drink of Pentecostal water
[1:06:46] amen amen glory to God Amen
[1:06:49] Hallelujah see that's what happened when
[1:06:51] when God sent me out to Iowa God sent
[1:06:53] Malachi and I out to Iowa that's what
[1:06:54] happened we we went out there and God
[1:06:55] used us as vessels for a good drink of
[1:06:57] Pentecostal water so two people could
[1:06:59] get
[1:07:00] Miracles and how many men how many men
[1:07:03] wept their way up to uh Deliverance by
[1:07:05] God's grace let's say five 10 praise God
[1:07:07] hallelujah that's five more than they
[1:07:08] had
[1:07:09] before God wanted a drink of Pentecostal
[1:07:12] water now what does God want today
[1:07:13] Hallelujah that's the question it's just
[1:07:16] a home Church you know just a regular
[1:07:17] Sunday but what kind of drink does God
[1:07:19] want today in our lives Jose sees it
[1:07:21] amen hallelujah that's that right
[1:07:24] brother we're all vessel God wants to
[1:07:27] take God wants to use us so he can have
[1:07:29] a drink so he can pour out his
[1:07:31] Pentecostal blessings upon the
[1:07:34] church
[1:07:36] Hallelujah you've been very faithful
[1:07:38] here thank you Church number 22 they say
[1:07:41] they hear from God just like Abraham did
[1:07:43] in Genesis 18 how did God hear from
[1:07:46] Abraham Abraham came to him in a
[1:07:47] physical body so now they believe the
[1:07:50] tape is just like the physical body of
[1:07:52] God it's complete idolatry
[1:07:57] just like genesis 18 I said that's
[1:07:59] idolatry you guys are insane you're not
[1:08:01] you're not hearing that same way it's
[1:08:03] not the
[1:08:04] same a tape is not God brother Braham
[1:08:07] said mechanic God never ordained
[1:08:09] mechanical devices to preach the gospel
[1:08:11] praise God that's what he said
[1:08:15] amen number
[1:08:17] 23 press play and Obey is the perfect
[1:08:20] will of God and God is and will be
[1:08:22] pressing play in heaven now there is a
[1:08:25] quote where god brother man talks about
[1:08:26] God pressing play in heaven but it's
[1:08:28] only one
[1:08:29] quote but they're making it seem like
[1:08:31] God is going to come up and say okay
[1:08:33] Angels be quiet time to time to have
[1:08:34] church let's PR let's press play on
[1:08:36] brother bram's tape tape cassette click
[1:08:39] and God's just going to sit down they
[1:08:41] make it like God's going to sit down and
[1:08:42] listen to the tapes of brother brandom
[1:08:43] now come on people God's going to stand
[1:08:46] there and he's going to speak he's got
[1:08:48] eyes like fire Jehovah amen hallelujah
[1:08:52] he's got eyes like fire amen he can talk
[1:08:54] for himself Hallelujah
[1:08:56] he's not a tape he's God he's a spirit
[1:08:58] he's a person he's Eternal he's Jehovah
[1:09:00] hallelujah
[1:09:02] amen 24 they say you got to put brother
[1:09:04] R back in the Pulpit because this is his
[1:09:07] Pulpit brother Ram said many times
[1:09:08] that's uh he said the world is my Pulpit
[1:09:11] right he saying as a as a missionary the
[1:09:13] world is my Pulpit but he wasn't saying
[1:09:16] that I need to I I need to be in every
[1:09:18] person's Pulpit by pressing play that's
[1:09:20] a
[1:09:22] lie if that was the case why did Brother
[1:09:25] Ram tell Perry green to start a church
[1:09:27] and preach and ordain him and we got the
[1:09:29] 45 minute sermon on it where he says God
[1:09:31] will bless brother green to preach the
[1:09:33] gospel he never said press play brother
[1:09:36] Green Goodness all right I gota get
[1:09:39] under control here okay
[1:09:43] now I've always liked when Donnie Reagan
[1:09:46] or other people like they they other
[1:09:48] preachers they have this great
[1:09:49] Revelation and I I always like when they
[1:09:50] make this disclaimer they say what I'm
[1:09:53] going to preach uh they say one uh after
[1:09:55] I preach this I'm no longer liable for
[1:09:58] the way I act because I might be
[1:09:59] shouting and rejoicing and screaming all
[1:10:00] over the
[1:10:02] place I was like that one amen sometimes
[1:10:05] I want to feel like that
[1:10:07] too okay and that was 24 right was that
[1:10:10] 24 and then 25th is now the tape bride
[1:10:14] that's the 25 did I get
[1:10:19] 24 I just want you to see some stability
[1:10:21] examples of stability yes yep okay so 25
[1:10:24] is tape uh tape bride there is no tape
[1:10:27] bride in the Bible there's no tape Bride
[1:10:29] on the
[1:10:30] tapes all right now let me try to
[1:10:37] close brother Ram's talking about making
[1:10:40] ready he says now you say certain things
[1:10:44] will take place and then I'll Make Ready
[1:10:46] brother ramam said make ready now for
[1:10:47] the
[1:10:49] Rapture I've just related to you Pearl
[1:10:51] Harbor of many places where they refuse
[1:10:53] to hear the warning
[1:10:55] they refused to listen to it nothing was
[1:10:57] left but Divine judgment upon the people
[1:10:59] now all that will not go in Christ will
[1:11:01] be under God's Wrath and divine judgment
[1:11:04] please don't let that happen to you so
[1:11:05] he's talking about the Rapture right
[1:11:07] he's talking about Pearl Harbor oh I I I
[1:11:10] uh by God's grace I brought in September
[1:11:12] 11th and now we can see with this flood
[1:11:14] and hurricane Church it went up into uh
[1:11:17] North Carolina and they they didn't
[1:11:18] think it'd go up there these people had
[1:11:20] no warning like we never know that's
[1:11:23] like they asked Jesus when that remember
[1:11:24] when that uh Tower fell Jesus said were
[1:11:26] they more Sinners than anybody else and
[1:11:28] Jesus said no basically that was God's
[1:11:29] plan that was God's time for them to go
[1:11:31] a tower fell on them and people died and
[1:11:33] Jesus said that was God's time we better
[1:11:35] be ready by God's grace is that
[1:11:39] right that's what brother Ram saying
[1:11:41] make ready now now look no matter what
[1:11:44] the brandom Tabernacle ever turns out to
[1:11:47] be don't you let it be
[1:11:51] you he's basically saying if brandom
[1:11:53] tabernac Tabernacle turns out to be bad
[1:11:55] don't be
[1:11:56] bad he said you be a servant of Christ
[1:11:59] oh man it just struck me there they're
[1:12:01] serving the tapes they're serving their
[1:12:04] Pastor instead of serving Christ because
[1:12:07] if they serve Christ they do the word of
[1:12:10] God let me say like this whatever bride
[1:12:13] of Christ Fellowship let me bring it
[1:12:14] down home amen come on Church whatever
[1:12:17] this church turns out to be you follow
[1:12:19] Christ Hallelujah follow the word of God
[1:12:22] if brother Jesse gets off on some false
[1:12:24] thing you try to corrected by the word
[1:12:25] but if he don't be corrected you stay
[1:12:27] with the word hallelujah amen that's
[1:12:30] what see that's what brother does the
[1:12:31] church is named after him but he's
[1:12:33] saying it's not in a church I mean you
[1:12:35] must gather more as we see that day
[1:12:37] approaching that's part of it but if a
[1:12:38] church if you're if you can't be in Love
[1:12:40] with a Church you got to be in love with
[1:12:41] Christ
[1:12:45] Hallelujah don't let it be you no matter
[1:12:47] what the church world does you be a
[1:12:48] servant of Christ it's not up to the
[1:12:50] brandom
[1:12:51] Tabernacle neither is it up to any other
[1:12:54] Church see I can't get you ready this
[1:12:57] church coming to church can't get you
[1:12:58] ready you've got to get ready every
[1:13:01] that's what brother man is saying Bram
[1:13:02] Tabernacle can't get you
[1:13:04] ready right you've got to get yourself
[1:13:07] ready for the coming of the lord it's up
[1:13:09] to you as an individual to be ready at
[1:13:12] the coming of the Lord you must be ready
[1:13:14] I must be ready I'll sweep my own steps
[1:13:17] it's up to you to sweep your steps I
[1:13:19] usually sweep mine with a broom or my
[1:13:21] blower right I got my uh my blower there
[1:13:24] I forget the name name the brand name of
[1:13:25] that one I got my Ryobi blower and I
[1:13:28] every almost every day I go by and blow
[1:13:29] all the leaves off my steps that's what
[1:13:32] brother BR says we got to clean out our
[1:13:33] steps praise
[1:13:35] God he said it's up to you to sweep your
[1:13:38] steps leave mine alone me leave yours
[1:13:41] alone you've got to make your garment
[1:13:45] ready again he says it later you might
[1:13:49] have the name of church you might have
[1:13:50] the name of brandom Tabernacle or
[1:13:52] Methodist or whatever you Church you go
[1:13:53] to that isn't it friend see it's
[1:13:57] something different it's your character
[1:13:59] that's what God is a looking
[1:14:02] at Hallelujah so God's not looking at oh
[1:14:04] you go to this church you go to that
[1:14:05] church go to that church God's not
[1:14:07] looking at that he's looking at what
[1:14:08] does your character speak are you
[1:14:11] exercising under righteousness or are
[1:14:13] you exercising unto
[1:14:15] unrighteousness what's your daily life
[1:14:17] look like
[1:14:20] Hallelujah then brother said this don't
[1:14:22] forget he says
[1:14:26] forgot to highlight this
[1:14:28] one he says don't forget this Tabernacle
[1:14:32] will lose its strength brother Braham
[1:14:35] said that in uh
[1:14:37] 1963 this Tabernacle will lose its
[1:14:39] strength remember that this is the
[1:14:41] target where Satan's got every gun in
[1:14:43] Hell trained on
[1:14:45] it see that where has Satan been
[1:14:48] attacking the most brandom Tabernacle
[1:14:51] and boy they've really they've really
[1:14:53] suffered spiritually
[1:14:56] every gun in Hell think of that every
[1:14:57] gun in hell just like in the days of
[1:14:58] Wesley right or days of Martin Luther
[1:15:00] every gun in hell was pointed at Martin
[1:15:02] Luther John Wesley and then isusa street
[1:15:04] right and then brother brandham and
[1:15:06] they're still today and brother BR said
[1:15:07] this Tabernacle will lose its strength
[1:15:09] what strength do we have the word of God
[1:15:11] is the only strength we have you're only
[1:15:13] as strong as your adherence to the word
[1:15:14] of God hallelujah all right I'm closing
[1:15:18] with this because it's almost 12 I'll
[1:15:19] try to close before an hour and a half
[1:15:21] okay I put this quote out this week
[1:15:22] anybody see the quote I put out about uh
[1:15:25] be certain of God anybody see that on
[1:15:26] online okay good well good amen
[1:15:29] hallelujah
[1:15:30] good so brother man was talking about
[1:15:32] Elijah and the widow woman remember she
[1:15:35] had a she had she's a widow and she only
[1:15:36] had one son brother Ram said she
[1:15:38] probably stayed up all night brother
[1:15:39] Jose praying because she knew this is
[1:15:41] going to be our last day I've just got
[1:15:43] enough oil and flour to make one more
[1:15:46] cake my son and I are going to eat it
[1:15:48] and then we die that's what brother
[1:15:49] man's talking about so brother man's
[1:15:51] talking about a woman who saw day after
[1:15:53] day inflations Rising more and more
[1:15:58] famine more and more famine my days are
[1:16:01] numbered it's almost
[1:16:02] time it's almost time to die every day
[1:16:06] was more and
[1:16:08] more God didn't answer all those days
[1:16:11] think of that God didn't answer all
[1:16:13] those days
[1:16:15] nothing and this is what brother man
[1:16:17] says in this context you know it's a
[1:16:20] strange thing may God let this soak into
[1:16:22] every one of you if you never never hear
[1:16:25] me preach again let this be a message
[1:16:27] it's a strange most strange that
[1:16:29] sometimes that God does things that
[1:16:32] way God will not answer your prayer for
[1:16:35] day after day after day after month
[1:16:38] after month after
[1:16:41] year God let a a mother with one child
[1:16:45] to feed one she only has one mouth to
[1:16:47] feed God let that mother
[1:16:50] battle where is God all these days where
[1:16:52] is God Where's God what about my baby
[1:16:54] God what about my baby God what about me
[1:16:57] God let it go down brother said isn't
[1:16:59] that
[1:17:00] strange you know when we have confessed
[1:17:03] our sins and met every requirement that
[1:17:06] God requires we've believed on God
[1:17:09] there's a circumstance that has to be
[1:17:11] met it's according to his will so
[1:17:14] brother says look at this situation this
[1:17:16] is God's will God allows these things
[1:17:20] it's his
[1:17:21] will he says and we've confessed our
[1:17:23] sins and we've made all all the wrongs
[1:17:25] that we have done right done everything
[1:17:27] that we know how to do every requirement
[1:17:30] that God has made or asked we've met
[1:17:32] that requirement and yet he lays silent
[1:17:36] he just won't answer
[1:17:40] us so that woman with the one child
[1:17:42] prayed all those days all those months
[1:17:44] the famine was wasn't it three yes three
[1:17:45] and a half years three and a half years
[1:17:47] she prayed God I need some more oil God
[1:17:48] I need some more need some more bread
[1:17:50] need some more it's like God never
[1:17:53] answered
[1:17:55] God was silent right some people write
[1:17:58] the silent God right sometimes he is on
[1:18:01] purpose brother tells us why it's for
[1:18:04] his
[1:18:05] will I'm sure that I'm speaking to
[1:18:07] people this morning who has come to that
[1:18:09] place anybody come to that place
[1:18:11] before he's like God God's silent God
[1:18:14] don't hear me God why haven't you
[1:18:16] answered me the widow woman felt the
[1:18:18] same
[1:18:19] way after this brother R breaks into
[1:18:21] Shadrach mikhak and abedo after this
[1:18:24] same thing well God we're not all we
[1:18:26] knows we're not going to sin we'll die
[1:18:28] for our
[1:18:29] faith I'm going to trust you whether God
[1:18:32] Saves me whether God lets me die I'm
[1:18:34] just going to trust God Amen I'm not
[1:18:36] going to compromise and worship these
[1:18:39] Idols amen
[1:18:41] amen he's brother man says I've been
[1:18:43] there many times myself when I've went
[1:18:45] back and traced my life and turned over
[1:18:47] every
[1:18:48] stone that I find I've did something
[1:18:51] wrong I'd go confess and say Lord I'll
[1:18:53] make it right and go do so so brother am
[1:18:56] say well Lord last year I said this to
[1:18:58] my wife he'd go to his wife honey
[1:18:59] forgive me then oh yeah maybe I did that
[1:19:01] wrong to brother Billy Paul Billy Paul
[1:19:03] forgive me he would go through his whole
[1:19:04] life and confess everything and then ask
[1:19:07] God and then God still want to answer
[1:19:10] him how many of us have done
[1:19:12] that you've actually how many of us have
[1:19:15] spent time going back this last week
[1:19:17] Lord did I do anything wrong is that why
[1:19:19] you're not answering me brother BR says
[1:19:21] I've done that many times
[1:19:25] he said I turn over every
[1:19:27] stone you ever done that look at every
[1:19:29] area of your life is there any sin under
[1:19:32] here did I do anything wrong Lord have I
[1:19:34] mistreated anybody have I done anything
[1:19:36] wrong financially have I anything wrong
[1:19:38] with my health have I anything anything
[1:19:40] wrong with my job brother BR would go
[1:19:42] through every area of his
[1:19:44] life he said Lord I'll make it right and
[1:19:48] then come back and say now Lord Thou Art
[1:19:50] God you'll answer me surely I met every
[1:19:52] requirement that you require me to do do
[1:19:55] and every requirement I've met it okay
[1:19:58] so look look what brother would say I
[1:19:59] confess to my wife I confess to this
[1:20:01] come back and say God surely you'll hear
[1:20:03] me and then he
[1:20:04] says these
[1:20:07] words and still he won't
[1:20:13] move seems to set silent that's when
[1:20:16] you've got to be sure that he's
[1:20:20] God don't be discouraged
[1:20:24] the only thing is that in your heart you
[1:20:27] have to be certain of
[1:20:30] God hallelujah think about that he went
[1:20:33] through every era of his life now come
[1:20:35] back and say surely God will answer me
[1:20:37] now and God still don't answer I've met
[1:20:39] every requirement God how come you don't
[1:20:41] answer me because God is still God and
[1:20:44] he has a will for your
[1:20:47] life see church sometimes this is what I
[1:20:50] feel like too sometimes sometimes I feel
[1:20:51] like we have to earn things like we get
[1:20:52] in the mindset well if I earn it then
[1:20:54] he'll surely get give it to me whatever
[1:20:56] we're longing for
[1:20:58] right brother R tells us plainly I I've
[1:21:00] done this many times and still he won't
[1:21:04] move he said be certain first before you
[1:21:07] do anything be certain in your heart
[1:21:09] that it's God and when you've met
[1:21:11] everything that he said then you're sure
[1:21:13] that he's God that's when Faith goes to
[1:21:16] work right there Faith stands steady for
[1:21:19] it knows that he is so what we talking
[1:21:22] about double mindedness right surely
[1:21:24] this surely this mother battled
[1:21:25] double-mindedness well God did you hear
[1:21:27] me I I I felt anointing yesterday surely
[1:21:29] you heard me no year after year three
[1:21:31] years month after month she was battling
[1:21:36] uncertainty but she had to be certain
[1:21:39] that God was God she had to be certain
[1:21:42] God had a plan for Life how many know
[1:21:43] God's got a plan for your
[1:21:45] life but we don't like the part of the
[1:21:47] plan when God doesn't answer us God
[1:21:50] seems like he's
[1:21:53] silent I've met every
[1:21:55] requirement and still God's
[1:21:59] silent he says and if you've met every
[1:22:01] requirement you believe that he is Faith
[1:22:04] holds steady oh blessed be his
[1:22:07] name Faith won't move for it's sure that
[1:22:10] God is and a rewarder of those that
[1:22:12] diligently seek Him amen so see you got
[1:22:15] to look we got to look at it like if
[1:22:17] God's not answering my prayer he's
[1:22:18] asking me to be more diligent right he's
[1:22:21] building up diligence in my life Faith
[1:22:22] virtue knowledge Temperance patience God
[1:22:24] is brother kind he's trying to build
[1:22:26] this up in my life he's trying to make
[1:22:28] sure that I I really got the goods
[1:22:31] amen he wants you to have patience he
[1:22:34] wants you to have longsuffering he's
[1:22:35] trying to build this up in your life if
[1:22:37] he still hasn't answered your
[1:22:40] prayer brother Bram said may this go way
[1:22:43] down deep and never move from you
[1:22:45] brandham Tabernacle let me say like that
[1:22:47] may this go down deep bride of Christ
[1:22:49] Fellowship and may it never leave from
[1:22:51] you praise God if you've met God's
[1:22:53] requirements and in your heart you
[1:22:55] believe that he is God is only testing
[1:22:57] your faith for he loves to do
[1:23:00] that
[1:23:03] amen if God hasn't answered your prayer
[1:23:05] yet youve met every requirement God
[1:23:07] loves you he's just testing your faith
[1:23:10] hallelujah hallelujah it's a test it's a
[1:23:15] trial think about this woman three and a
[1:23:17] half years never got to answer till the
[1:23:20] last day Hallelujah think about all
[1:23:22] these saints that never got to answer
[1:23:24] and die
[1:23:27] right there was no there was no great
[1:23:29] miracle at the end nothing nothing
[1:23:31] exciting nothing
[1:23:32] Supernatural the the Bible said they'll
[1:23:34] get the reward on the other side
[1:23:36] Hallelujah they died not receiving the
[1:23:39] promise Hebrews
[1:23:47] 11 Hallelujah he says he's only he loves
[1:23:50] to test your faith you confessed your
[1:23:52] sin and you met every requirement that
[1:23:53] God requires and still he lays silent
[1:23:55] remember faith says that he is then
[1:23:59] Faith holds on to it not knowing what
[1:24:00] it's all about but it knows that he is
[1:24:03] and it's certain that he is God I'm
[1:24:06] almost done I got three or four more
[1:24:07] paragraphs so bear with
[1:24:10] me then remember if he is his words has
[1:24:13] to be true and if he required you to
[1:24:16] meet these circumstances and you did
[1:24:17] he's obligated to take care of his word
[1:24:20] don't back off and say well I never got
[1:24:22] healed oh he said oh poor weak faith
[1:24:25] don't believe that if everything is
[1:24:27] confessed and everything is out and you
[1:24:28] met God's requirement Faith holds right
[1:24:32] there there's nothing will move it he is
[1:24:35] and you're sure and then he quotes
[1:24:38] Isaiah they that wait upon the Lord
[1:24:40] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:24:41] Mount up with wings of eagles they shall
[1:24:43] run and not be weary if they walk they
[1:24:45] shall not faint Hallelujah Oh Glory wait
[1:24:50] then or sorry he says wait when you've
[1:24:52] met his requirement that brings your
[1:24:54] faith to a showdown if you've met God's
[1:24:56] requirements that he's made and you
[1:24:59] fully considered it and you've done
[1:25:00] everything God has required you to do
[1:25:02] then your faith rests right there that
[1:25:04] he is be certain of God two more
[1:25:07] paragraphs I'm almost
[1:25:08] done you know he loves to test us so he
[1:25:11] says it again he loves to test
[1:25:15] you he loves to see if you'll pass the
[1:25:18] test now I like I love giving tests
[1:25:20] brother William but I don't like grading
[1:25:21] them so much I could do without the
[1:25:23] grading
[1:25:25] the giving is fun because I get it's a
[1:25:26] nice and quiet I just get to walk around
[1:25:27] and help people everybody stays in their
[1:25:29] seat takes their nice test real good
[1:25:31] right nature you've seen it I love
[1:25:33] giving tests but I sure don't like great
[1:25:35] in
[1:25:35] them but God loves to test us he loves
[1:25:39] to see the reaction oh he loves to see
[1:25:41] the reaction of your faith in other
[1:25:43] words God loves to see you say Lord I
[1:25:45] trust
[1:25:46] you I haven't seen the answer I I I I
[1:25:49] haven't heard your voice it seems like
[1:25:50] you're silent but I still love you am
[1:25:52] cuz I know you're a rewarder of those
[1:25:55] who diligently seek
[1:25:59] me he loves to see you give praise even
[1:26:03] when things aren't going your
[1:26:07] way in other words he loves to see your
[1:26:09] he loves to see that you trust him even
[1:26:11] when you're not getting what you want
[1:26:13] because what does that show that shows
[1:26:15] unconditional
[1:26:17] love should our love be conditional well
[1:26:20] God gave me what I want that's why I
[1:26:21] love him or should it be unconditional
[1:26:23] should be uncondition
[1:26:26] like God's
[1:26:28] love you know he loves to test us he
[1:26:31] loves to see the reaction of your faith
[1:26:33] did you know that God likes to see how
[1:26:35] you'll react when you say oh Lord I
[1:26:37] believe you Thou Art My Savior I believe
[1:26:39] that you are the Healer I believe that
[1:26:40] you're the one who gives me the Holy
[1:26:42] Spirit and these things that I'm
[1:26:43] requiring you are the God who gives that
[1:26:45] and then when you confess all your sins
[1:26:47] and promise God what you'll do if you'll
[1:26:49] get well and then because it don't
[1:26:51] happen you run off like a coward
[1:26:53] somewhere God can't use that there's no
[1:26:56] way for him to use you there's no way
[1:26:58] for him to answer you because he only
[1:26:59] Answers by
[1:27:01] faith then all of a sudden you go away
[1:27:03] and he can't answer but true real Faith
[1:27:05] stands there being sure that God is be
[1:27:09] certain that he is so see that that
[1:27:11] widow woman she didn't run off to Ahab
[1:27:14] and say okay I'll worship Jezebel's
[1:27:16] Idols I'll go to Jezebel's Temple she
[1:27:18] could have but she had faith and God
[1:27:20] sent her a prophet amen hallelujah she
[1:27:23] could have sold out
[1:27:25] she could have been a pro she could have
[1:27:26] been a prostitute right she could have
[1:27:27] gone in the city been a prostitute make
[1:27:29] money and come out there but she stayed
[1:27:30] true to God and God sent her a blessing
[1:27:32] praise
[1:27:33] God
[1:27:36] hallelujah last paragraph and if God
[1:27:39] asks for this thing to be done his
[1:27:41] requirements like confessing sins
[1:27:43] praising
[1:27:45] him to confess your sins and so forth
[1:27:47] and you've done it faith says that he is
[1:27:50] it's certain that it's going to happen
[1:27:54] your request has to be granted oh I hope
[1:27:57] you don't miss that if you're sure of
