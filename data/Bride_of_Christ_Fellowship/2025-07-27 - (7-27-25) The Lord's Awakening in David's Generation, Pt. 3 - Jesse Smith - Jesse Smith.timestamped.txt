[0:00] You guys should have seen Nia. He looks
[0:01] so handsome yesterday. I said he's got
[0:03] this black shirt on and black tie. I'm
[0:05] like, that's the most handsome I've ever
[0:06] seen, that guy. So,
[0:10] you looking good, brother. Hallelujah.
[0:12] So, I just so appreciate everybody by
[0:13] God's grace.
[0:15] So So, we want to read uh 65 and 66.
[0:20] Put those up there together. Thanks
[0:21] again, brother Vang, for doing that,
[0:23] brother.
[0:25] We'll read both of those together. It's
[0:26] only two verses. Okay, let's start on
[0:28] three. 1 2 3. Then the Lord awakened as
[0:32] one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
[0:35] that shoutth by reason of wine, and he
[0:38] smoked his enemies in their hinder
[0:41] parts, he put them to a perpetual
[0:44] reproach. Let's have one more word of
[0:45] prayer. If you have a need on your
[0:46] heart, let's make it known unto God. We
[0:47] know the word of God is how faith comes
[0:50] into our life. I'm sure we all want more
[0:52] faith today. Hallelujah. Lord, increase
[0:54] our faith or as brother Diggs preached
[0:55] to us, unlock our faith. Father God,
[0:58] we're thankful for today, Lord God. We
[0:59] know, Lord, there's a there's a a
[1:01] spiritual element to it and a
[1:03] predestinated element. Lord, the Bible
[1:05] says add to your faith virtue and
[1:06] knowledge and all these things. And
[1:08] Lord, there's also the uh spiritual
[1:10] element of it where uh the seed of God
[1:12] that's in us has all the potentials
[1:13] already, Lord God. So, Father, we pray
[1:15] just add to our faith today, Lord God. I
[1:17] have my plans, what I felt led of the
[1:20] Holy Spirit to bring out while I was
[1:21] preparing, but Lord, you're free to take
[1:23] your servant, Lord God. Help me just to
[1:24] serve your purpose. And Lord, just go as
[1:26] the people pull, Lord. Whatever they
[1:28] have need of today, God, help me not to
[1:30] uh sway, Lord God, but help me to be
[1:32] faithful to your commands. Bless your
[1:34] people today, God. They've come out to
[1:36] the house, Lord. Everybody looks so
[1:37] happy and healthy. It was such a
[1:38] beautiful day, Lord God. I pray just let
[1:40] your spirit have preeminence today.
[1:41] Bless your people today, Lord God. Thank
[1:43] you for the reality of thus sayith the
[1:45] Lord. Thus sayith the scripture in our
[1:46] lives. Thank you for this fellowship,
[1:48] Lord. Protect us, strengthen us, Lord
[1:49] God. Help us to uh Lord have our way
[1:52] filled every day with love, the love of
[1:55] Jesus Christ. Charity, it's the capstone
[1:57] for the believer, the stature, the
[1:59] fullness of Jesus Christ in our lives.
[2:01] God grant it today. Bless his preaching
[2:03] of thy word in Jesus Christ's name. And
[2:05] the saints said,
[2:06] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[2:07] seated. Praise God.
[2:17] Hallelujah. So, let's um I'm going to
[2:19] set a timer here just to see how far I
[2:21] can go. Now, the last few Sundays,
[2:23] Brother uh Austin and Brother Chris and
[2:25] I have had Sunday night Bible studies.
[2:26] So, if you'd like to be a part of that,
[2:27] let me know. I I can do a Google meet. I
[2:30] can send out a link if people want to be
[2:31] a part of that by God's grace. It's got
[2:34] to end before 8 o'clock because that's
[2:35] the time about Malachi's got to go to
[2:36] bed. So, uh we normally do it about
[2:39] 6:30, 6:45 or 7 to 8 or something like
[2:41] that. So, um, we want our mothers, you
[2:44] know, with the babies, we want them to
[2:46] have enough time to rest and recover
[2:47] before, uh, they fully devote themselves
[2:50] to devote a whole day at church. That's
[2:51] a long time. And, um, so we want to give
[2:54] them full time, uh, to adjust with the
[2:56] family here by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[3:00] So, let's look at this thought here,
[3:01] part three, the Lord's awakening in
[3:02] David Generation. I hope you enjoyed
[3:04] Wednesday night. That was to me that was
[3:05] a really special, beautiful message from
[3:07] the word of God. We showed uh through
[3:10] all the New Testament verses that
[3:12] someone is sleeping when they're
[3:14] committing sexual fornication
[3:16] and engaging in lust lustful cravings,
[3:19] taking advantage of brothers and sisters
[3:21] for their own gain. They're into other
[3:23] people's business like maybe a gossip or
[3:25] something. They're lazy. They're
[3:28] dishonest. They're rioting which is late
[3:29] night parties. Chambering, which is
[3:32] sleeping from house to house. Strife or
[3:34] division in the church. envying others,
[3:37] wanting to be like others, wantingness.
[3:39] Is that say that right? Wantedness.
[3:41] Wantedness. There it is. Wantedness.
[3:44] Okay, which is uh lentiousness. In other
[3:46] words, again, cravings of the the flesh.
[3:50] Filthy words. If people are saying
[3:51] filthy words or coarse jesting or jokes
[3:53] that shouldn't be told, that's someone
[3:55] who's sleeping on God. And luxuries, uh
[3:59] buying things that you don't need with
[4:00] money you don't have. Hallelujah.
[4:03] Covetous. Uh wanting things other people
[4:05] have. And then any idol in someone's
[4:07] life that's sleeping. Hallelujah. Now,
[4:10] if you don't have any of those,
[4:12] hallelujah, you're wide awake today.
[4:13] Hallelujah. Amen. That's a blessing. And
[4:16] we also we ended with by by showing Saul
[4:19] only one time did he approach the ark of
[4:21] the covenant. Think about that. One time
[4:23] he had access his whole life to talk to
[4:26] God. Think of that. He had access to
[4:29] talk to God as much as he wanted. And he
[4:31] only did it one time and it was only
[4:32] halfway because as the noise got louder,
[4:36] he said, "Withhold your hand, priest."
[4:38] He said, "I'm going out to battle." Now
[4:40] he got the victory. But think about
[4:42] that. Of all the times he could have got
[4:43] thus sayith the Lord, he only did it
[4:45] half a time. So church, I think my wife
[4:48] was even sharing with me one time
[4:49] recently, you know, uh we look at we
[4:52] look at Israel, they had a pillar of
[4:53] fire and all these things, right? I
[4:54] think we were talking about that one
[4:55] time. And we we we would envy them,
[4:57] right? We would say, "My, they had God
[4:59] every time." But we've got actually more
[5:02] than that. We've got the word of God,
[5:04] &gt;&gt; right? There's more Bible verses, right?
[5:06] God can talk to us more through here
[5:08] than just uh we say a manifestation of
[5:11] God leading us by a fire.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand that? By God's
[5:15] grace, in other words, yeah, that fire
[5:16] will lead us physically, but this will
[5:18] lead us spiritually.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; And we have I I feel like we're more
[5:23] advantage. How many believe that we have
[5:24] better promises, a better covenant?
[5:26] Praise God.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we can get thus sayith the
[5:29] Lord all the time.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; I think it was Claude who was texting me
[5:33] questions, right? We're texting about
[5:34] Adam and Eve, right? Was that you,
[5:35] brother? I thought so. I didn't know if
[5:36] it was Patrick. I couldn't remember. But
[5:38] I love it. You know, when the when the
[5:39] saints have questions, look to the
[5:41] scripture. The scripture will give us
[5:43] thus sayeth the Lord.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; We're such a privileged people. Now, I
[5:48] would I would appreciate a pillar of
[5:49] fire that if it was here would lead us,
[5:51] you know, to go to that house or go I
[5:53] would appreciate that. But we also have
[5:55] so much more. But if I didn't have the
[5:56] word of God, I'd feel I'd feel like a
[5:58] little deprived. Wouldn't you?
[6:00] &gt;&gt; But to know we have thus sayith the
[6:02] Lord. We can go look every time we need
[6:04] something and find a truth in the word
[6:06] of God. No wonder we sing that song,
[6:08] come and dine. The master calleth, you
[6:10] can feast at Jesus table anytime.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; So friends, let's be awake today.
[6:16] Hallelujah. Not just physically, but
[6:18] spiritually. And if we have sin in our
[6:20] lives, we must only confess them. Now, I
[6:22] want to bring this out just briefly.
[6:24] It's it's a little bit of a a
[6:27] background on Psalm 78:65.
[6:30] Uh notice in verse uh 66 though, he
[6:33] smoked their enemies in their hinder
[6:35] parts. So when God started waking up, he
[6:38] started putting diseases on people's
[6:40] hinder parts, their backside.
[6:43] That was in the book of uh Samuel,
[6:45] right? 1st Samuel 5:6. But the hand of
[6:48] the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod,
[6:51] and he destroyed them, and smokeote them
[6:52] with emeralds,
[6:55] even Ashdod, and the coast thereof. 1st
[6:58] Samuel 5:9, he smoked the men of the
[7:01] city, both small and great, and they had
[7:04] in their secret parts.
[7:06] So when God started rising up, he
[7:08] physically smoked the Philistines in
[7:11] their back parts. Hallelujah. Amen. Now
[7:14] church, look what God's done with this
[7:16] homosexual community.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; All the diseases, all the STDs, God has
[7:22] smoked them.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Right? What does it but that what does
[7:25] that mean? That's just one sign to us
[7:26] that God has risen up and he's awakened
[7:28] our lives. Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; He's he's driven all that nonsense.
[7:32] Right? None of that's ever come into our
[7:34] church because God has risen up. He's
[7:36] defeated those foes and those enemies
[7:38] have been put under our feet.
[7:40] Hallelujah.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I told you, brother Mike
[7:43] Durle, he passed away a few years ago,
[7:45] but he was an open homosexual until
[7:48] someone handed him a card. We had used
[7:49] to have those cards out there where
[7:50] Brother Bram's picture was on it. And
[7:52] someone just handed him a card and it
[7:54] said, "God sent a prophet." He wrote a
[7:56] letter to Jeffersonville. They sent him
[7:58] books. He started reading and he left
[8:00] that community. Amen.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; What is God doing? God is raising people
[8:04] up. He's wakening people spiritually,
[8:06] raising them up so they can fight for
[8:08] the Lord. They can be on the winning
[8:10] team because the battle belongs to the
[8:12] Lord. Hallelujah.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, God is doing that. Hallelujah.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; And this was part of what the scripture
[8:20] said. This was God wakening. He said,
[8:22] "Now I'm going to fight against my
[8:24] enemies." Hallelujah. Now I'm going to
[8:26] deliver my people, church. If you need
[8:28] to be delivered, God is here.
[8:29] Hallelujah.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; You don't have to remain defeated. You
[8:33] don't have to remain in a beaten
[8:34] position. You can be an overcomer. You
[8:37] can put any any enemy under your feet.
[8:39] Hallelujah.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; I would I would go as far as saying, I
[8:44] believe anything anybody's struggling in
[8:46] with here today, you could find somebody
[8:48] else in this church who has overcome it.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; And you could talk to them and if you
[8:55] under the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[8:56] and honesty and integrity and maybe with
[8:58] another witness, you could talk with
[9:00] them. How did you get the victory? And I
[9:01] believe if you were humble enough, you
[9:03] could find the way to get your victory.
[9:05] Hallelujah.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like I was sharing with you, I'll
[9:09] just share it. Um well, I don't think
[9:11] I'll share this, but the a preacher came
[9:12] in recently and said, "I'm working my
[9:14] way up to fast in a whole week and he he
[9:16] was working on get up to seven days and
[9:19] he was seeing more victory in his life."
[9:21] Hallelujah.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; I've said this before. Banks heard me
[9:23] say this. If you want a victory you've
[9:25] never had before, you've got to do
[9:27] something you've never done before.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that doesn't mean
[9:32] worldliness. You got to be more
[9:34] spiritual.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But see, God has already given us
[9:37] the victory, the word. But each one of
[9:39] us have to find the channel how that
[9:41] victory is going to come through.
[9:42] Hallelujah.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; That's right, church. Hallelujah. Now,
[9:46] for me, remember my battle over sugar? I
[9:48] had to do a 21-day sugar fast. And that
[9:51] was the defeat, the temptation of the
[9:53] lust of the flesh.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; I had to do something I'd never done
[9:57] before to get a result I never had
[9:59] before.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; And so yesterday, Brother Mua tried to
[10:02] give me all these pops. I'm like, "No
[10:03] thanks, man." I said, "Let me show you
[10:05] the emeralds I got smoked with."
[10:08] Hallelujah.
[10:09] I appreciate everybody's kindness. But,
[10:12] uh, we see it there. You know, by God's
[10:13] grace, if we want a victory, God is
[10:15] going to find God is going to give us
[10:17] some truth in the word of God. We got to
[10:19] be willing to walk in that path. Why,
[10:21] church? And it's got to be important to
[10:23] you because when you get a testimony,
[10:24] you can help other people get a
[10:26] testimony.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Think about that. When you're finally
[10:29] walking in victory over your enemies,
[10:31] you can be a witness to other people.
[10:33] Hey, if I did it, if God did it for me,
[10:35] God can do it to you. Hallelujah.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Because he's mighty in battle.
[10:39] Hallelujah.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; He smoked his enemies, the Philistines,
[10:43] and their hinder parts. And then he put
[10:45] them to a perpetual reproach.
[10:48] Hallelujah. They were shamed and
[10:50] reproached. The Bible says in 1st Samuel
[10:53] 5. Now, if you study the Philistines,
[10:55] eventually they run out and they're just
[10:57] they're they're kind of swallowed up by
[10:59] uh the Assyrians and the Babylons, and
[11:01] the Philistines are no more. Church,
[11:03] it's a good lesson for us. We might
[11:05] battle Philistines for years, but if we
[11:07] believe in God, if we put God's word to
[11:09] work, the Philistines will be no more in
[11:11] our lives. Hallelujah.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; It'll be the the the battle, the enemy
[11:15] will get swallowed up. The Bible said
[11:16] they'll get swallowed up in life.
[11:18] Hallelujah.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're able to get victories where
[11:20] we don't struggle with those things
[11:22] anymore. If we just take it to God, if
[11:24] we just believe God's word, if we just
[11:26] go further than we've gone before.
[11:28] Hallelujah.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Like I've told different ones, you know,
[11:32] uh try to fast till lunchtime and then
[11:34] try to fast till 3:00. Cornelius fasted
[11:37] till 3:00 and that's when he heard the
[11:39] thus sayith the Lord from Peter and the
[11:41] angel. Try to go to 3:00 or 6 p.m. or
[11:45] whatever you can. And if you need God to
[11:47] move in your life, you got to be willing
[11:48] to sacrifice.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:53] And as we'll see, we got to be willing
[11:54] to find thus sayeth the Lord as David
[11:57] did. Hallelujah.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to see here, um,
[12:03] remember the Bible said, we will never
[12:04] be ashamed. We have, thus sayith the
[12:06] Lord, that the fullness of Pentecost
[12:08] will be in the bride. Now, in some ways,
[12:10] we're a far way off. Other ways, we're
[12:12] very close.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; We've got the right doctrine. We got the
[12:15] love of God. Hallelujah. We need more
[12:17] power. Hallelujah. But power comes with
[12:19] sincerity.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, Brother Ram makes
[12:22] it seem like the sincerity will come
[12:24] once the squeeze comes on
[12:26] &gt;&gt; when there's pressure.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; Because if you if you listen to the
[12:29] sermon, desperation, right after brother
[12:31] preached the token, he said, "It's a
[12:32] shame, but humans normally need God to
[12:34] bring them into desperation."
[12:37] &gt;&gt; And we're going to need desperation to
[12:38] go in the rapture.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They needed desperation on
[12:41] the day of Pentecost, did they not? They
[12:43] had to wait up there 10 days. They were
[12:44] in fear of the Roman guards. It took
[12:47] desperation to get them ready. But
[12:48] church, God, help us to seek God. God,
[12:50] help us to have desperation for other
[12:52] victories in our life other than the
[12:54] rapture. We know it's going to come, but
[12:55] God, give us desperation to be ready to
[12:57] get victories in this time before the
[12:59] rapture. Praise God.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:04] Amen.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Joel 2:23, "Be glad then, you children
[13:07] of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your
[13:09] God, for heath given you the former rain
[13:11] moderately, and he will cause you to
[13:14] come down for you the rain, the former
[13:16] rain, and the latter rain in the first
[13:17] month." The former rain was Brother
[13:18] Ram's ministry. We're waiting for the
[13:20] latter rain, and the floor should be
[13:22] full of wheat, and the fats overflow
[13:24] with wine and oil. And I'll restore to
[13:26] you the years that the locust hath
[13:27] eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar,
[13:29] the Palmerworm, my great army, which I
[13:32] set among you. So God is going to
[13:33] restore the book of Acts in our lives.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:38] I was listening to a sermon I preached
[13:40] back in uh 2011 at CAM church and it was
[13:42] just everything I said it was shouting
[13:44] and screaming. That was a great time of
[13:46] revival for us.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Everything I said shouting and screaming
[13:50] from 2011. Uh so I would say that was
[13:52] like some of the time from 2010, 11, 12,
[13:55] 13. So that was some of the greatest
[13:57] revival that we've seen temporarily. But
[14:00] the best part is God can restore it
[14:02] again. Hallelujah.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said you can't withstand a
[14:05] revival past about three or four years.
[14:07] Three years. But that doesn't mean a
[14:10] revival can't come back.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; It can come back. Hallelujah. And
[14:14] another generation, the younger
[14:16] generation, the younger generation has
[14:17] to be willing, hungry for it. So does
[14:19] the older generation has to get out of
[14:21] our ways and then God can give us
[14:23] another revival.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a possibility. like Cam
[14:27] Preach here. Samson had to realize
[14:29] there's a possibility God can bring the
[14:31] power back again. Hallelujah. There's a
[14:34] possibility for revival. My hair's
[14:36] growing back. Samson said, "Hallelujah.
[14:38] There's a possibility God will restore.
[14:40] If I just die to myself, God will
[14:42] restore power." Hallelujah.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Church, remember, these are all
[14:48] given by God.
[14:50] And let me just say like this. If we're
[14:52] not guilty of all those sins we listed
[14:53] on Wednesday, you know, uh, sexual sin,
[14:56] uh, all the grudges and idolatry,
[14:58] church, then we are awakened God and
[15:00] we're just waiting for God's timing for
[15:02] revival.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Is that everybody understand that?
[15:06] &gt;&gt; God will send a revival in his time.
[15:08] Now, we know we have to be yielded for
[15:10] it, but if we can look at our lives and
[15:11] say we don't have any of these works of
[15:13] sleepiness, spiritual sins in our lives,
[15:15] then God can give us revival
[15:18] &gt;&gt; and God will do it as his at his
[15:20] appointed time. Hallelujah.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:24] Now, where I want to get to is verse 26.
[15:26] And ye shall eat him plenty and be
[15:27] satisfied. And praise the name of the
[15:29] Lord your God, that I dealt wondrously
[15:31] with you, and my people shall never be
[15:34] ashamed.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; See, God made the Philistines ashamed.
[15:38] He put He put uh emrods in their back
[15:41] parts. He made them ashamed. But God is
[15:43] saying, "My people will never be
[15:45] ashamed. Amen.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; My people will be thankful for the word
[15:50] of God. We're not ashamed of the word.
[15:51] We're thankful for the word.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this church or our
[15:55] beliefs. I'm thankful for them.
[15:57] Hallelujah.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; I built my life upon it. My ministry, my
[16:01] family, everything of me, I built my
[16:04] life upon the Bible, Revelations. I'm
[16:06] not ashamed of this message. Hallelujah.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; God won't let me be ashamed. Hallelujah.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Because I just have to look at other
[16:14] people and that don't believe the
[16:15] message. look at their lives and that
[16:17] makes me sad for them, but it makes me
[16:19] thankful for the truth. Hallelujah.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; That's right, church. God's people will
[16:24] never, let's say, never, can we?
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Never
[16:26] &gt;&gt; be ashamed. Hallelujah.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; You'll never be ashamed to be a real
[16:29] Holy Ghost fil believer. You'll never be
[16:31] ashamed of that. You'll be thankful for
[16:33] that. Hallelujah.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Now, remember Psalm 41:11. Psalm 41:11.
[16:39] Remember, this is how you know God's
[16:41] given you favor. By this I know that
[16:44] thou favors me
[16:47] because my enemy do not triumph over me.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do I know, brother
[16:54] Jesse? I'm getting the victory because
[16:56] God doesn't let fear overtake you.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; God doesn't let depression ruin your
[17:02] life.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Or suicidal thoughts. And the church
[17:05] said,
[17:06] &gt;&gt; "God does not let that trial. Yes, I
[17:08] battle it. Yes, the birds fly over my
[17:10] barn all the time. But I always knock
[17:12] them out. Amen.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; That's how I know God is with me. God
[17:17] favors me. Because of my own self, I
[17:19] would have failed many times with lust
[17:21] of the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of
[17:23] life. I would have failed many times,
[17:25] but they did not triumph over me. I'm
[17:27] still in the house of God. I'm still
[17:28] giving God praise. I'm still seeking
[17:30] God's face. They did not triumph over me
[17:33] because God's fighting for me.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; God favors me. Hallelujah.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:40] Anyone else's favor doesn't really
[17:42] matter. But if you've got God's favor,
[17:44] you are more than a conqueror in Christ
[17:46] Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; And you can face any enemy, no matter
[17:50] you whether you feel God or not. Jesus
[17:52] never said, "Did you feel it?" Jesus
[17:54] said, "If you can believe it."
[17:55] Hallelujah.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[17:58] believe. Hallelujah.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Look at verse 12. And as for me, thou
[18:04] upholdest me. Now what? See this? We
[18:06] looked at integrity last week.
[18:08] What did God do? God upheld David in his
[18:12] integrity.
[18:14] What does uphold mean? I'm upholding the
[18:16] Bible. So God is the hand. God is the
[18:19] nail scarred hand holding up your
[18:21] integrity.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, God is your strength.
[18:25] God keeps you from sinning because you
[18:27] probably would have done it.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Your flesh would have loved to do it
[18:30] because your flesh is enmity against the
[18:32] Holy Spirit.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; But God helps you keep your integrity.
[18:36] Amen. Amen.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God keeps you from giving
[18:39] into sin. God keeps your enemy from
[18:41] trying over over you. God holds up your
[18:43] innocence. Hallelujah.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:48] And he setest me before thy face
[18:51] forever. Hallelujah. So God almost he
[18:54] holds up your integrity and you're set
[18:55] before his face forever. In other words,
[18:57] you're constantly in the presence of
[18:59] God.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; I know God's here. I know God's watching
[19:02] over me. Amen.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; I just like Austin and I were saying, we
[19:05] just can't stop thinking about God,
[19:07] which is God's on our thoughts wherever
[19:08] we go. No matter what we do, we always
[19:10] feel like we're being watched by God.
[19:11] Amen.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's how it is. Amen.
[19:14] Whether we're struggling or victorious,
[19:16] we know God's right there. That's such a
[19:18] confirmation that you're a child of God.
[19:21] Hallelujah.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Because the the the true believers, the
[19:25] Bible said they want God in all their
[19:27] thoughts.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, Lord, help me not
[19:31] to forget you. Lord, bring you bring
[19:33] your word into every part of my day so I
[19:36] can see before your face. I can be in
[19:38] your presence and I can be an overcomer.
[19:40] I can see that you favor me.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Blessed be the Lord God of
[19:46] Israel from everlasting to everlasting.
[19:49] Amen and amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look, David's obedience,
[19:54] we'd say, or his love for God or his
[19:56] integrity or his fear of the Lord made
[19:59] it so much easier to defeat his enemies.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:05] Let's remember this, friends.
[20:06] Selfishness is not your friend.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; It's your enemy.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; When you want to do something and you
[20:12] know it's against the word of God, or
[20:14] you want to do something and your
[20:14] husband or wife doesn't want to do it,
[20:16] and you know you're being selfish, you
[20:17] know just you want your way, that's your
[20:19] enemy.
[20:21] That's not your friend.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Easy living or laziness or
[20:25] tiredness, not giving God your best
[20:28] diligence, that is not your enemy.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Laziness is not your friend. Hallelujah.
[20:35] Now, if you've overworked yourself and
[20:36] you've been going on three hours of
[20:38] sleep for a while, then yes, you need
[20:39] some rest. Hallelujah. Get you some
[20:41] rest, they'd say. Hallelujah. Or if you
[20:43] had a rough night or something like
[20:44] that. I'm not talking about that. I'm
[20:47] talking about consistently not giving
[20:48] God time that he deserves in your life.
[20:51] Hallelujah.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; That's not your friend. Hallelujah.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; We'd say fear is not your friend. Fear
[20:57] is your enemy.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Lust is not your friend. Lust is your
[21:03] enemy.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Money is not your friend. Money is a
[21:08] tool. How about that? Hallelujah. The
[21:11] Bible says that. Amen. It cannot be your
[21:13] God. You cannot love it. You must see it
[21:15] as a tool. Praise God.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; And see friends, these are enemies. The
[21:21] love of money is the root of all evil.
[21:23] Praise God.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; These must all be viewed as enemies and
[21:28] they must be conquered because God is
[21:30] for me, not against me. Hallelujah.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; God is for you and God wants to
[21:35] strengthen you. Hallelujah.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Glory. Now, the main meat of my message,
[21:40] I think, is this. Let's look now if you
[21:42] got your Bible, let's look at David,
[21:43] some of David's victories. Uh, and he
[21:45] and many times he consulted the ark.
[21:48] Now, I could find at least at least nine
[21:50] times David mentioned the ark, honored
[21:53] the ark, or went to the ark for
[21:55] guidance. How many did Saul do? One. He
[21:58] actually went to the ark once. That's if
[21:59] you don't count the last one where he
[22:01] said, "I tried to go there, but I've got
[22:02] to go to a witch." Right? The ark
[22:04] wouldn't answer me. So, at least maybe
[22:06] once or twice he tried, but he failed
[22:09] because he ignored it. church. He
[22:10] neglected God for so many years. Oh. Oh,
[22:14] my friends. If we could just realize,
[22:15] Amen. No matter how many weeks we've
[22:17] wasted or months or years we've wasted.
[22:20] God said, we just read it. God will
[22:21] restore the years. Hallelujah.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Don't waste your years. Don't waste your
[22:26] weeks. Don't waste your months. God will
[22:28] restore the months. Hallelujah.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; God will restore the weeks. If you
[22:32] wasted time, get back to God. Let God
[22:35] turn it around. God said, "I will." Not
[22:37] you will. God will. Hallelujah.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:43] God redeems wasted days, weeks, months,
[22:47] years. God knows how to redeem it.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; He puts himself, he puts his spirit into
[22:52] our lives.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 23 2 3 and 4. Now, this is
[22:59] after David has ran from, he's been
[23:01] running from Saul for a while.
[23:05] 1st Samuel 23:2. Therefore, David
[23:08] inquired the Lord, saying, "Shall I go
[23:09] up and smite these Philistines?" And the
[23:11] Lord said to David, "Go and smite the
[23:13] Philistines and save Keela." Can you do
[23:15] verse three and four? And David's men
[23:18] said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here
[23:19] in Judah. How much more if we come to
[23:22] Keela against the armies." Now look at
[23:23] this. He gets thus say the Lord, but all
[23:26] of his friends in the message are a
[23:28] little afraid.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Does God say, "I'm done with them?" No.
[23:32] God understands that we battle fear.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is even this is
[23:36] awesome too because go this this
[23:38] validates God will repeat his perfect
[23:40] will for you even when you're afraid.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; Do I know if it's the right move or not?
[23:44] Let me just go seek again. Let me just
[23:46] let me take another little moment. Let
[23:48] me go spend time with God in prayer. Let
[23:49] me make sure I've got the right leading.
[23:51] God will accept you in that.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's okay to wonder.
[23:56] Well, did I hear it right the right time
[23:58] or the first time? Did I hear it right?
[23:59] Uh I want to make sure I know God's
[24:01] heart. Amen. And God will gladly receive
[24:04] you. If he received David, he'll receive
[24:06] you.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Verse four. So now, well, here's the
[24:11] second time we know he went to the ark.
[24:14] And David inquired of the Lord yet
[24:16] again. And the Lord answered him and
[24:17] said, "Arise, go down to Kila, for I
[24:19] will deliver the Philistines into your
[24:21] hand." So he gets a double confirmation.
[24:22] The church said,
[24:24] &gt;&gt; "God always confirms with two or three
[24:26] witnesses.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Should I go?" Everybody's afraid. Should
[24:30] I do this? Should I confront confront
[24:32] the brother? Confront the sister. Uh,
[24:34] let me ask God and follow God's will.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Always follow God's
[24:39] first saying
[24:41] &gt;&gt; right
[24:42] &gt;&gt; now. Look, look, church. Look, God
[24:43] answered David the same way both times.
[24:45] God didn't do that with Balum.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God knew Balam wanted to
[24:49] go.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; That's why brother used that word
[24:53] neutral. You've got to be neutral.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm not leaning one way
[24:57] or the other. I just I'm waiting on God.
[25:00] Yes.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; See, the first time Balam wanted to go,
[25:04] he didn't get the word. So Bale said,
[25:06] "Go, go again." And he said, "Fine, go
[25:08] with them." Right? So he got the
[25:11] permissive will of God. But here, Dave
[25:13] is neutral. Should I go to Keela? Yes.
[25:14] Oh, but my men are afraid. Let me go ask
[25:16] God again. Yes. Even though they're
[25:17] afraid. Amen.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Even though you're afraid, church, go
[25:20] with God's word. God's word will always
[25:22] get the victory.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Even if other people are afraid, you
[25:27] stay with God's word. Hallelujah.
[25:30] That's right.
[25:32] So, there we go. Twice he double checks
[25:36] his hearing from the Lord and make sure
[25:38] it's right. That's what I do, Brother
[25:39] Austin. I double check, Brother Vang, my
[25:41] sermons before I preach them. I make
[25:42] sure I got two or three witnesses on
[25:44] there. And if I don't, I don't preach
[25:46] it. Hallelujah.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; I'll just put that on the shelf for
[25:49] later. Like I said, I'll put that up
[25:50] there. Hallelujah.
[25:53] You double check. Now, go down to verse
[25:56] 9. Samuel 23:9.
[26:03] Now David feels a trap is getting set
[26:06] for him by Saul. Let's look at 9 10 11
[26:10] and 12. Let's start with nine. And David
[26:12] knew that Saul secretly practiced
[26:13] mischief against him. And he said unto
[26:15] Abathar the priest, "Bring hither the
[26:16] ephod." Now remember the ephod was the
[26:18] outer robe or this outer vest that the
[26:20] high priest wore and it had 12 stones on
[26:22] it. Each stone was represented a tribe
[26:24] of Israel. So the high priest would go
[26:27] in with it on and it would flash with
[26:30] and maybe God would seem like God would
[26:31] speak and uh God would answer and the
[26:34] the stones would flash the light off the
[26:37] light off the ark of the the covenant
[26:39] would flash and that'd be a vindication
[26:41] of what God wanted to do.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; We're children of the light. Hallelujah.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; See, when the word jumps off the pages,
[26:48] when God's word, when the light of the
[26:49] Holy Spirit shines on God's word, that's
[26:52] our proof that the word of God is for
[26:54] us. Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:58] Now look what he says there in verse 10.
[27:01] Then said David, oh Lord my or Lord God
[27:03] of Israel, thy servant has certainly
[27:04] heard that Saul seeketh to come tequila
[27:06] to destroy the city for my sake. In
[27:08] other words, I'm hearing all this all
[27:10] this noise about me. I'm in trouble. I
[27:13] need your word.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; My life's in trouble. My testimony's in
[27:18] trouble. The enemies are after me. God,
[27:20] what should I do?
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Sound familiar to anybody? Hallelujah.
[27:24] Verse 11.
[27:26] Will the men of Keela deliver me up into
[27:28] his hand? Will Saul come down as thy
[27:30] servant hath heard? Oh Lord God of
[27:32] Israel, I beseeching us. See church,
[27:34] this is what we need sometimes.
[27:34] Desperation. Beseech means to beg. In
[27:36] other words, David's like, I'm begging
[27:38] you, God. Where do I do? Is he going to
[27:39] come down? A church. When have we got
[27:41] that sincere with God?
[27:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. There's
[27:44] times we got to be desperate where we
[27:46] know we're going to be desperate for the
[27:47] rapture. But if we want victory in our
[27:49] life today, we got to find ways to be
[27:51] desperate now. Hallelujah.
[27:54] I see he's begging. That means to beg. I
[27:56] beg you, God.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; This wasn't well Lord, you know what's
[28:01] your will? Okay, Lord. Okay, now I'll go
[28:03] out and I'll go hunting and try to get
[28:05] some game or something like that. It was
[28:06] I'm desperate.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I beseech you. Am I going to die?
[28:10] A trap is set for me. The enemy is on my
[28:13] He's on my tail. Uh he he's got a trap
[28:16] set for me. I don't want to fall into
[28:17] the trap. I don't want my testimony
[28:19] marred. I want a testimony of
[28:21] overcoming. Hallelujah. I don't want to
[28:23] die. I want to live. Hallelujah.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said he will come down. So
[28:32] the Lord shows him what the enemy is
[28:34] going to do to try to overtake his life.
[28:36] So now he knows what the enemy is going
[28:38] to do. He can find a way out of the
[28:40] enemy's plans.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, God always makes a way of escape.
[28:44] Hallelujah.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't that beautiful promise in 1
[28:47] Corinthians 10:13? Temptation is common
[28:50] to every man. You've not gone through
[28:52] something that someone else hasn't gone
[28:54] through.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in every case, God
[28:58] will make a way of escape. Hallelujah.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what he did here. God makes a
[29:03] way of escape for David. Church, we
[29:05] don't have to fall. We don't have to go
[29:06] into shame. We don't have to be
[29:08] defeated. If we seek God, God will show
[29:10] us the way out. Hallelujah.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's beautiful. Did I read 12?
[29:18] Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. No, 12. Then said
[29:20] David, will the men of Kela deliver me
[29:22] and my men into the hand of Saul? And
[29:24] the Lord said unto him, they will
[29:25] deliver thee up. And so then David knew
[29:28] what to do. Hallelujah. God gave him
[29:31] thus sayith the Lord. Now that's the
[29:32] third third time. Is everybody keeping
[29:34] track?
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Three times he's gone. Three times he's
[29:37] got the victory.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; All right. Fourth time. 1st Samuel 30 7
[29:43] and 8.
[29:45] This is one of the lowest spots of
[29:47] David's life.
[29:49] David is already on the run. He's left
[29:51] the promised land of Israel. He's living
[29:53] in the Philistine country. He went and
[29:56] fought some battles and left his wife
[29:58] and all the kids behind. And every one
[30:01] of them was taken away.
[30:03] Now, can we imagine like Vang and I uh
[30:06] going to work, coming home, and
[30:07] everything's gone. Everything in our
[30:10] house is gone. Brother Vang, can you
[30:11] imagine that? What an awful moment.
[30:14] And you know what David does? He doesn't
[30:16] go raging and doesn't go doesn't doesn't
[30:18] go try to rage himself like be a rage
[30:20] monster children. He doesn't try to be a
[30:23] rage monster and do what he wants to do.
[30:24] He goes to God in that moment.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Does that remind you of somebody named
[30:29] Job?
[30:30] &gt;&gt; He lost everything. And what did Job do?
[30:32] Job says the Lord gives. The Lord takes
[30:34] away. Honey, don't talk like a foolish
[30:36] woman. Should should we receive good at
[30:38] the hand of God and not evil? Look at
[30:40] the integrity. The integrity of both men
[30:42] when they've lost everything is go to
[30:44] God. What's your will? What's going on,
[30:46] God? Hallelujah.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; It wasn't, "I'm done with Christianity.
[30:50] I'm done with this church. I'm done with
[30:51] the message." It wasn't that. It was
[30:53] like, "God, you're in control. You
[30:54] blessed me before. You've gotten me
[30:56] here, but Lord, I need to know what's
[30:58] going on. Show me. I'm going to you."
[31:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not turning on the God who had mercy
[31:04] and grace on me.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not turning on God's people just
[31:08] because something bad happened.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; The church said,
[31:15] What a beautiful story.
[31:18] Hallelujah. What does he say? He says,
[31:20] "Priest, bring me the hyot." In other
[31:24] words,
[31:26] in other words, that's in a difficult
[31:27] time, Malachi, bring me the Bible.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Let's see what this is all about.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Where can I find myself in the
[31:35] scripture?
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Where can I find this situation in the
[31:38] scripture? Now, first friends, confess
[31:40] all your sins. Hallelujah.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; That you know nothing is held against
[31:45] you. If you're in a difficult trouble
[31:46] situation, confess all your sins and
[31:49] know that it's all under the blood
[31:51] &gt;&gt; because the Bible promises under the
[31:53] blood. Hallelujah. And then say, "God,
[31:56] somebody bring me a Bible. Somebody put
[31:58] on a sermon of brother Brandham.
[31:59] Somebody get me a prayer meeting.
[32:00] Somebody give me some time where I can
[32:02] just have a few minutes in the presence
[32:03] of God. Let me find God's will for my
[32:05] life." Why? We'll have to watch this
[32:07] week and see if anything happens this
[32:08] week. My goodness.
[32:11] I wasn't planning on that. He says,
[32:15] "Shall I p shall I pursue after this
[32:18] troop?" Now, you would think it'd be
[32:20] common sense. Yes, go get your wife and
[32:22] children. But David stops to ask, "Lord,
[32:25] what's your will? Shall I do this?" In
[32:27] other words, shall I do this now?
[32:29] Hallelujah. And he answered him,
[32:31] "Pursue, for thou shalt surely overtake
[32:34] them and without fail recover all." What
[32:37] a promise. What protection David had.
[32:40] Amen. Even though he's out of the will
[32:42] of God, he's not in the promised land,
[32:45] he still got promises. Oh my.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, if you've ever been
[32:49] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:51] Christ, you've got the promises of
[32:52] heaven. Hallelujah.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; You might be out of God's will, but yet
[32:56] you started in the promised land. Maybe
[32:58] you're out of it. Just remember, even
[33:00] though you're out of God's promise,
[33:02] God's promise is never out of you.
[33:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[33:09] If you've been buried in the name of the
[33:11] Lord Jesus Christ, God's promise is with
[33:13] you.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:18] Even though David forsook God, God never
[33:21] forsook him.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Even though there's times we forsake
[33:24] God's word or God's way, God will never
[33:26] forsake us.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; And he gets the promise, you'll get it
[33:33] all back. That sounds like Job again to
[33:34] me.
[33:36] Job got it all back. All seven children
[33:38] if I'm not mistaken. Well, maybe had
[33:40] seven sons and daughters. I can't
[33:42] remember exactly. But he got everything
[33:44] back. Hallelujah.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; By the grace of God. Now, not everybody
[33:47] does. We know that. But look at these
[33:49] men of integrity. In their darkest
[33:51] moments, they reach out to God. In other
[33:53] words, they say, "Where's my Bible?"
[33:56] &gt;&gt; I got to find what is what's going on.
[33:59] Where somebody will get on their phone
[34:00] and say, "Well, let me do Facebook or or
[34:01] let me do Instagram or let me do
[34:03] whatever. Let me do chat GTP to try to
[34:05] find the answer to my problems. We
[34:06] should go to God Almighty, church,
[34:08] &gt;&gt; right? Or let me call my dad or my
[34:10] grandma or my mama or or my even my
[34:12] pastor. He might be your pastor might be
[34:14] a help. Praise God.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; But you know, look at this. They're
[34:17] going to God. I need to hear from God. I
[34:20] need thus sayith the Lord. Amen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, the hunger is to go to
[34:25] God and say, God, what's going on in my
[34:27] life?
[34:29] &gt;&gt; And God will show up and answer.
[34:32] So before David's king, church,
[34:35] there's four times that the ark is
[34:37] mentioned and all four times he hits it
[34:40] exactly.
[34:42] God never fails David when he goes to
[34:45] the ark. Now remember, did he go to the
[34:47] ark about Basheba? Of course not. The
[34:51] Bible said he despised the ark. That's
[34:53] the time where he set his Bible down and
[34:54] said, "I don't care what that says. I've
[34:56] got feelings. I've got passions. I've
[34:58] got desires. I'm going to do what I want
[35:00] to do." Church, be careful. Don't do
[35:02] that.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Humble yourself.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; If you do that, just say, "God, forgive
[35:08] me." Go back and pick it up. Praise God.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Go back and pick it up and say, "I've
[35:12] got to do this. I've got to find God's
[35:14] will."
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Now, the next one. Now, there's five
[35:19] times after he becomes king that he
[35:21] speaks of or mentions or treats the ark
[35:24] in a certain way. 1 Chronicles 13:3.
[35:29] Yeah, this we read this on Wednesday.
[35:31] And let us bring again the ark of our
[35:33] God to us, for we inquire not at it in
[35:36] the days of Saul. So this imagine,
[35:39] brother Vang, this whole generation was
[35:41] used to not going to God. What were they
[35:44] going to then? What what what were they
[35:47] doing?
[35:49] I'm not doubting them because how often
[35:51] do we go to the word of God?
[35:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about on Sunday and
[35:54] Wednesday. I'm talking about throughout
[35:55] the week.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. I ask you to open your Bibles. Look
[35:58] at that. Claw and Patrick. Great job,
[35:59] brother. Got the Bibles right open on
[36:00] their laps. Malachi's got the B. I I
[36:02] appreciate that. We're going to the
[36:03] Bible today. But I'm talking about when
[36:05] during the week when you go through
[36:06] difficult times, do you first think of
[36:08] the Bible?
[36:10] &gt;&gt; It's okay if you don't, but let may your
[36:12] second thought be scriptural.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; If your first thought is not scriptural,
[36:16] may your second or third be scriptural.
[36:17] Hallelujah.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; To get you back in the word of God.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Now, church, look at look at the glory.
[36:25] Look at the This is why God honors
[36:27] David. He wants God's word to inquire
[36:31] of, to ask of.
[36:34] And this is why God honors our church.
[36:37] And God honors you because you want the
[36:40] ark of God in your life constantly.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; He He didn't want to ask, "Well, once in
[36:45] a while we'll go there." No. Every
[36:47] Sunday I'm going to go here. Every
[36:49] Wednesday, and all throughout the week,
[36:51] I'm going to go here.
[36:53] I was reading my Bible the other day and
[36:55] then some some later on in the day that
[36:57] verse came right out. I needed it right
[36:58] there when I was talking to somebody out
[36:59] in public. I couldn't remember exactly
[37:01] maybe it was when I was working there on
[37:02] Friday at my friend Adam's house. It was
[37:05] the very verse I read. It's like ah
[37:06] perfect right there. Amen. Just when I
[37:09] needed it. Praise God. See God God wants
[37:12] to speak to us every day. And so we got
[37:14] to make time to inquire of the Lord.
[37:17] Lord, what's your Bible say about this?
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Now you here's what I do. I can use chat
[37:21] GGP to find answers to my questions,
[37:24] right? Because it's a little faster.
[37:26] But then I got to go double check it in
[37:27] the scripture.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; You got to double check it in the
[37:34] scripture just like just like we've used
[37:36] Google for years. I used to just I mean
[37:37] it's just another form of Google, right?
[37:40] I used to Google where is this found?
[37:41] Where's that? And so we got to double
[37:44] check it. Make sure it's backed up in
[37:46] the word of God.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The second mention, I love
[37:49] this one. 2 Samuel 6:1.
[37:57] And David gathered together all the
[37:58] chosen men of Israel, 30,000. Look at
[38:00] this. Verse two. What a revival,
[38:02] brother. 30,000 message believers. And
[38:05] David arose and went with all the people
[38:06] that were with him from Baal of Judah to
[38:09] bring up from then the ark of God, whose
[38:10] name is called by the name of the Lord
[38:12] of hosts that dwelleth between the
[38:14] cherubams. Verse three. And they set the
[38:16] ark of God upon a new car and brought it
[38:18] out of the house of Abinadab that was in
[38:20] Giba and Yuza and the sons of Adanab
[38:22] drove the new cart. Now you remember the
[38:24] story. I'm not going to read all this.
[38:26] They're bringing the ark in the wrong
[38:28] way. It wasn't supposed to be on a cart.
[38:31] It was supposed to be carried by
[38:32] Levites,
[38:34] &gt;&gt; not by not by wooden animals, but by
[38:37] men.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; God's word always comes by living men.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; And so Usuza tried to catch it and
[38:44] steady it. And God smokeed him right
[38:46] there. And David's like, "What
[38:48] happened?" In other words, David wasn't
[38:49] He didn't ask about that. Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't ask the ark. How
[38:54] do I carry the ark?
[38:56] &gt;&gt; He neglected the Lord on that. See, he
[38:59] got Look at that, church. He got caught
[39:00] up in the big meeting.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Everybody got you?
[39:03] &gt;&gt; He got caught up in when the guest
[39:05] ministers come around. Now, there's I
[39:06] get I get excited too about Don't get me
[39:08] wrong, I love guest ministers. I
[39:09] probably love that more than when I'm
[39:10] just regular pastor because I get a
[39:12] break. No, I love it all. But in other
[39:14] words, he got all caught up in the big
[39:16] meeting, 30,000.
[39:18] But then he forgot to ask God, "God, is
[39:20] this how I bring your ark? Is this how
[39:21] the word supposed to come at the
[39:22] revival?"
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:27] That's why I told my cousin, I said,
[39:28] "Yes, you can come on Sunday. I want you
[39:30] to give a testimony, but I'm going to
[39:31] preach first."
[39:32] &gt;&gt; See, the words always got to come first.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:39] And then the Bible said David danced
[39:42] with all of his might before the Lord.
[39:45] So the David and all the house of Israel
[39:47] brought up the ark of the Lord with
[39:49] shouting.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; See that's what I This is my vision
[39:52] someday. Patrick and Claude mercy
[39:54] someday. My vision is see everybody in
[39:56] here shouting the praises of God.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Then we're going to have revival.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Right. Didn't didn't Psalm 78 say
[40:04] when God rose up, he shouted.
[40:08] Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; In other words, when God is anointing
[40:13] you, something's got to go. You've got,
[40:15] Brother Am says, all this pressurees got
[40:17] up. So, you got to let the steam off.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. We need the fire
[40:24] of God inside of us and it'll blow out
[40:26] some praises. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[40:29] Jesus. Glory to God. The word is here. I
[40:31] have thus, say the Lord, God's fighting
[40:33] for me. Hallelujah. My enemies are
[40:35] defeated. God's made me a conqueror.
[40:37] Hallelujah.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So, I'll do it
[40:42] for most of you today. Okay?
[40:44] &gt;&gt; I'll shout for the glory of God today.
[40:45] If you won't do it, I'll shout it. Thank
[40:48] you, Jesus, for the victory. Thank you,
[40:50] Jesus, for your word. Thank you, Jesus,
[40:52] for thus, sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah.
[40:56] Glory. Amen.
[40:58] I'm not under Satan's foot. Satan's
[41:01] under my foot.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:05] All those scriptures about sleeping in
[41:07] Jesus, we've got victory over those.
[41:09] We're defeating Satan. He's under our
[41:12] feet. We're the conquerors. Hallelujah.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; That makes me want to shout. Hallelujah.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just like David, he danced
[41:21] with all of his might. He was praising
[41:23] God. Now I can have thus, says the Lord.
[41:26] I don't have to be like Saul. Glory.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be like that other
[41:29] generation. I can have God's word every
[41:32] day of my life. Hallelujah.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be like my daddy or my
[41:41] father-in-law.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be like my
[41:45] mother-in-law. I don't got to be like my
[41:47] mama. I don't got to be like that other
[41:48] generation. I can have thus sayeth the
[41:51] Lord. I can hear from God myself.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; If we just did more of that, we'd be
[41:59] happier. Yes.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; If we just went to God and g gave God 30
[42:05] minutes or half an hour or I'm sorry,
[42:06] that's the same. Or an hour. Praise God.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; We'd be much happier. We would know what
[42:12] we're supposed to do because God showed
[42:14] us what to do.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; We're We're not guessing because God
[42:18] showed us the word of God.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:23] That's what made David dance when he
[42:25] knew every day I can ask God about
[42:28] something.
[42:31] Anytime I need God, I can go to God's
[42:34] word and I've got thus sayith the Lord.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[42:43] Look at 1 Chronicles 15:2.
[42:48] David gets the revelation. 1 Chronicles
[42:51] 15:2.
[42:54] David goes after somebody dies, after a
[42:57] great loss, a loss. After Usuza died, he
[43:02] he went back to the scripture. He says,
[43:03] "None ought to carry the ark of God but
[43:06] the Levites."
[43:09] &gt;&gt; See, when tragedy happens, church, when
[43:10] tragedy happens, it's supposed to point
[43:12] you to the word of God.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Now, listen. Well, if you want to,
[43:18] I mean, you're going to, but I mean, I
[43:21] was I talked to a man this week. He's a
[43:23] police chief. I told Malachi about it.
[43:28] He said, "My dad died unexpectedly a few
[43:30] days ago." I like, "Oh, I'm so sorry."
[43:32] No, I'm sorry. He did expectedly. Yeah.
[43:34] He had two strokes. And I said, "I'm so
[43:37] sorry." He's like, "Well, no, we knew it
[43:38] was coming. He loved the Lord." All
[43:40] these things. It's nice to know a chief
[43:41] that likes Jesus. Hallelujah.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Police chief. He said, "But you know
[43:45] what I've learned? Uh about 15 years
[43:48] ago, we I had a niece that was seven
[43:50] years old and he she had some disease
[43:52] and she was only supposed to live like a
[43:54] few days. She ended up living seven
[43:55] years.
[43:57] He said, "But when she died at seven
[43:59] years old," he said, "that shook me to
[44:01] my core." And it taught me though at a
[44:04] young age, see church, we're talking
[44:06] about tragedy, right? Out of uza came
[44:09] learning.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Out of tragedy came learning to put the
[44:14] word in its right place. Hallelujah.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And he said when this sevenyear-old
[44:19] died, I don't know if it was cystic
[44:20] fibrosis or whatever it was, when she
[44:22] died at seven years old, he said, "I
[44:24] learned this lesson. Nothing else
[44:27] matters except God."
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Life is so short. Life is so temporary.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Like Shang told me yesterday, he's
[44:38] getting old.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Shang told me he's getting old. Brother
[44:41] Vang, I'm about ready to give him a big
[44:43] hug and say, "No, you're young, buddy."
[44:46] Hallelujah. But look, time goes so fast.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "When that seven-year-old died,
[44:52] it showed me I've got to love." He said,
[44:55] "With my fullness, I've got to enjoy
[44:57] every moment because we never know when
[45:00] people will leave this place and go to
[45:02] heaven." Hallelujah.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, out of death or out of
[45:05] mistakes comes great learning if we'll
[45:08] only go back to the ark, back to the
[45:10] word of God like David did. Hallelujah.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Death is a reminder to get your life
[45:19] with God right.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And last uh this week I just
[45:23] talked to a man. He was playing beach
[45:24] volleyball. He's a good He's a Christian
[45:26] man. Now he don't believe the message,
[45:28] but he can be a Christian man. He was
[45:30] playing beach volleyball with another
[45:31] dad over in Copley. I think I told you a
[45:34] little bit about it. The man said, "I'm
[45:36] getting tired." He goes home. He passes
[45:39] out as his house.
[45:41] And so the family calls this other my
[45:43] friend and he goes over there. He tries
[45:45] to give him CPR, but he passed away. A
[45:47] man in his 40s. So just in the last
[45:49] three weeks, we have two men in their
[45:50] 40s that have passed away. What am I
[45:53] saying? We don't take anything for
[45:55] granted.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; We rejoice. We make the most of this
[45:58] service. We make the most of the time
[46:00] that we have. Hallelujah.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; And now I said, "Are you okay? Do you
[46:05] want to talk to me?" He said, "No, I've
[46:06] already talked to my pastor. I talked to
[46:07] the doctor. All these things are being
[46:09] helpful." He said, "I feel encouraged in
[46:10] the Lord."
[46:12] &gt;&gt; But what is that? That's a reminder.
[46:14] Look to the word. Look to the ark.
[46:16] Hallelujah. When there's trouble, look
[46:17] to God. Spend time with God. God God has
[46:20] a day. Brother said, "God has a day.
[46:23] He's going to pull our card."
[46:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I can do this right.
[46:28] Brother said each one of us got a card
[46:31] and only God knows when that card's
[46:33] going to call.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; God might say tomorrow calling Jesse
[46:39] home.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Come forth son. Hallelujah.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; He called my card. I hope I got 40 more
[46:46] years because 50 50
[46:49] whatever the Lord allows. But there's
[46:51] going to come a time he pulls the card.
[46:54] And church we may be ready. We might not
[46:56] be.
[46:57] But from each loss, let us remember
[47:00] there's something to be gained.
[47:01] Hallelujah.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Your spiritual condition can improve.
[47:07] David gained from the death that
[47:10] happened to his fam. I'm sorry, to his
[47:11] church. We'd say he gained from that.
[47:14] Now we bring up the ark the right way.
[47:17] Now we got everything lined up with the
[47:18] word of God.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:25] You know, I've talked to numerous men in
[47:27] the message, husbands that lost their
[47:29] wives. And one brother in particular
[47:31] told me out in Iowa, Brother Vang, you
[47:33] probably know he lost his wife. He said,
[47:35] "I was a mess for years. His wife cooked
[47:38] for him, cleaned for him,
[47:41] did everything for him." Brother Vang is
[47:43] basically like he got up. It's almost
[47:44] like his wife brushed his teeth, his
[47:46] wife helped him get dressed,
[47:48] and he just went to work.
[47:51] That was a brother that was addicted to
[47:52] Diet Coke and the Holy Spirit showed him
[47:54] it was and he couldn't walk upstairs.
[47:56] Brother Chris, he was drinking so much
[47:57] Diet Coke he couldn't even bend his
[47:59] joints. And then somebody said, "You
[48:01] should stop drinking Diet Coke and now I
[48:02] can walk up fine."
[48:05] That's all the trash that's in that
[48:06] stuff. Oh, that's right. They tried to
[48:07] hand that to me yesterday.
[48:10] Bless their hearts. I know I can't have
[48:12] it. Praise God. I I can't have it.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; But it took him years, brother. He even
[48:18] told me he fell out of church.
[48:20] Brother Isaiah's like, "Where you at?
[48:21] Where you at?" I'm struggling. I'm
[48:23] struggling. Church, it took him years to
[48:26] get this spot where he could finally get
[48:28] himself taken care of, get himself
[48:30] dressed. Come on, church.
[48:32] Get himself in the right condition. And
[48:34] now, brother uh brother Austin Sister,
[48:37] he's texting me verses to encourage me.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Before he was so discouraged, he fell
[48:42] off the planet. I'm like, "What happened
[48:44] to brother? Where is he? How could he
[48:45] leave the message?" He wasn't. He was
[48:47] going through a dark season, but he
[48:49] learned even through the loss, he
[48:51] learned he's got to have his own walk
[48:53] with God.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Now he's encouraging me. I'm like,
[48:57] "Thank you, brother." Hallelujah. Praise
[48:58] God. May God give you more fire. He's
[49:01] sending me quotes from Brother Bram. I'm
[49:03] going to send you one back. Hallelujah.
[49:05] You stir me up, I'm going to stir you
[49:07] up. Praise God.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; See, church, out of losses, if you go to
[49:12] the word, you'll you'll find the
[49:14] victories out of the losses.
[49:16] There's a famous saying, sometimes you
[49:18] have to lose in order to win.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; David had to lose Usuza in order to win
[49:25] the thus sayeth the Lord. The perfect
[49:27] will on how to bring the ark up.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Churchly, we all brother Brandon had to
[49:32] lose his wife and Sharon Rose in order
[49:34] to know who to go minister to the
[49:35] Pentecostals.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; That's hard for us to understand, but
[49:39] God did it in the Bible, right? There's
[49:40] Usuza. There's one example. Hallelujah.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Now, there could have been things behind
[49:44] it like Job. Maybe it was just a test
[49:46] for brother Ram. Brother Ram says it was
[49:47] his his fault. But we don't know that's
[49:50] thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah. In
[49:52] other words, things we don't always
[49:53] understand why we have trouble. Why do
[49:55] we have discouragement? Why do we have
[49:57] tragedy? But in every case, if we're
[50:00] still here, we still have the ark.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; If we're still here, we still have the
[50:10] word of God we can try to I'm sorry, we
[50:12] should go to we should try with all of
[50:14] our hearts to go to and find what's your
[50:16] purpose, God,
[50:17] &gt;&gt; for this loss in my life.
[50:20] Hallelujah.
[50:23] And church, what did he do there?
[50:26] Go down to verse 25, 26, 27, 28 in 1
[50:29] Chronicles 1500.
[50:32] David learned from this. If we've got
[50:35] the ark, now we can inquire every day.
[50:38] Now we can carry it the right way. In
[50:40] other words, we can bring the preachers
[50:42] back. Sister Beatatrice, no more tape
[50:45] players. We're going to bring the
[50:46] preachers back.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; It's going to come on the shoulders.
[50:50] Hallelujah. That's right.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; I was listening yesterday to spoken word
[50:54] original seed and brother Ram said,
[50:56] "Life only comes through the body." And
[50:59] you know, every one of these examples
[51:01] was like uh Peter to Cornelius. Every
[51:04] example was a living man, not a machine.
[51:07] Jose
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Philillip uh in the unic uses that he
[51:13] says oh he said glory. He said life
[51:16] always comes through the body. Life
[51:18] doesn't come through a machine. Life
[51:19] doesn't come from your phone. Life comes
[51:21] from a believer. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; That's why I admire brother Austin.
[51:29] Brother Austin's been helping out Chris
[51:31] and going to different ones, right,
[51:32] brother? We talked about that. I told
[51:34] you that might be why you're born to go
[51:36] after people because life only comes
[51:38] through the body.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; It don't come through machine.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Even my videos, that's good. I mean that
[51:44] but that's not me. That's not me
[51:46] physically there.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And encourage you. Brother Ram calls
[51:50] that secondary. But the primary way is
[51:52] preaching or witnessing face to face.
[51:55] That's the primary mode for God to save
[51:57] souls. Hallelujah.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody got that? I got less amen. So
[52:03] everybody must understand that already.
[52:04] Praise God. Or maybe it doesn't apply to
[52:05] your life right now.
[52:08] Ah 25 26 27. So David, the elders of
[52:10] Israel and the captains over thousands
[52:12] went up to bring the ark of the covenant
[52:13] of the Lord out of the house of Edom
[52:14] with discouragement.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; When he had the ark, was he discouraged?
[52:19] Oh God, help us. Amen. God, help us to
[52:22] have some joy when we leave this place.
[52:24] Hallelujah.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; We've got Sorry, brother. We've got
[52:27] God's mind. We've got God's word. We've
[52:30] got thus sayith the Lord. We should have
[52:31] joy. Praise God.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, I was out I was at the
[52:35] denominational church yesterday. Thank
[52:36] God for it. But we know they don't have
[52:38] thus sayith the Lord,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if it was my church, I'd
[52:41] say the same thing, brother. If it was
[52:42] Delta, Ohio, you know me, buddy. And it
[52:45] don't matter if it's a Catholic church
[52:46] or anything, you can tell they've got
[52:48] thus sayith the Lord. You can tell who's
[52:50] got the ark, church. We have the ark. We
[52:52] have thus say the Lord. We ought to live
[52:54] by it. We ought to inquire of it. We
[52:57] ought to be thankful for it. Hallelujah.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; How did they act when they had the word
[53:03] of God joy?
[53:05] &gt;&gt; You know, when I talked to brother Mua,
[53:06] he said, "I want to thank you and the
[53:08] church for all your support when he lost
[53:09] his wife.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; We sent him a love offering, too."
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And he got remarried right away. He's
[53:15] like, "I was lonely. I want to be
[53:17] remarried.
[53:19] He's like, "Look at my bride." He said,
[53:20] he started showing me pictures of his
[53:21] bride. Look at my bride, brother. Okay.
[53:24] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. See,
[53:27] church, people remember every little
[53:30] kind thing you do when they're
[53:31] struggling.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Try to reach out to them.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Try to be an encouragement. Try to
[53:37] support them. Just text them. How many
[53:39] times did I invite him to church? Like
[53:40] five or 10 times.
[53:42] Now he's moving to Minnesota. And that's
[53:44] all right. But see, it shows in the in
[53:47] the dark times, in the in those in the
[53:49] trying moments, help out people. Reach
[53:51] out to them. And church, God God will
[53:53] vindicate to them that you're a man of
[53:55] joy. You're a woman of joy. You're a
[53:57] child of God.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Bang, he was walking me through
[54:00] the church with his armor on my
[54:02] shoulder. He's He grabbed me by the
[54:03] shoulder. He starts coming. He said,
[54:04] "Come here, brother."
[54:06] I got like a a Holy Ghost escort from
[54:09] him. He was taking me around trying to
[54:12] get me food and water and everything
[54:13] like that. Like, I didn't expect all
[54:14] this. He was so happy to see me. Why,
[54:17] church? Because we've got the ark. Now,
[54:19] he's got more of the ark as far as than
[54:21] what he had.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; We believe if we have the message of the
[54:24] hour, we have the fullness of the word.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; All the mysteries revealed. Hallelujah.
[54:29] But he went from Baptist to Pentecostal.
[54:32] Amen. So, he went up. He went up from
[54:34] the stalk to the head of the wheat.
[54:36] Hallelujah. He's got more life. Amen.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I move on from that. That just
[54:42] really blessed me yesterday.
[54:46] Okay. Now, 1st Chronicles 16
[54:51] 1-6. Now, let's read one and then uh I
[54:54] think we'll do six. One and six. So,
[54:56] they brought the ark of God and said in
[54:58] the midst of the tent that David had
[55:00] pitched for and they offered burnt
[55:01] sacrifices and peace offerings before
[55:03] God. Now, pause right there, church. Who
[55:05] remembers what I preached two Wednesdays
[55:06] ago? Throne of God. Now, you're the
[55:09] tent. Let's say I'm the tent. Ready? I'm
[55:11] the tent. You're the tent of God. So,
[55:13] you've got to put the word in your tent.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; That's what David did. Saul wasn't like
[55:18] that. Saul was like, "I'll just go
[55:19] fight. I'll do the best I can with my
[55:21] own efforts, with my own human strength.
[55:23] I'm taller than everybody. I'm
[55:24] handsomemer than everybody. I I'm the
[55:25] king. I can do whatever I want." It only
[55:27] got him five victories.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; But church, David said, "I want that ark
[55:31] living with me."
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Nia, he said, "I want the ark in my
[55:35] heart every day."
[55:36] &gt;&gt; I know that's what you want, too,
[55:38] brother. Hallelujah. I want I want a
[55:40] tent for it. I want it to be right next
[55:42] to me. Praise God. Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; I want the word to be in me in this
[55:48] tent. Hallelujah.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; And church, for some of us, we have to
[55:52] you're going have to memorize some Bible
[55:53] verses.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Write them in your heart. I'm sorry.
[55:57] Plant them under your tent.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; If you don't memorize Bible verses, you
[56:02] need to start
[56:04] &gt;&gt; because that's the only thing you're
[56:05] going to have when the devil comes.
[56:07] All
[56:07] &gt;&gt; right? The devil's not going to shake if
[56:09] you just shake your Bible. He's not
[56:10] going to leave you shake your Bible.
[56:11] You've got to speak the word.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the uh original seed.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; It's original power.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; There's power in the word. The spoken
[56:20] word.
[56:24] Go down to verse six. What did David do
[56:26] once he got it in the tent church?
[56:27] What'd he do? Baniah also and the Jezel
[56:31] the priest with trumpets continually
[56:32] before the ark of the covenant of God.
[56:34] Did you know this? You probably know
[56:35] this. David was the first one to set up
[56:38] constant worship around the ark. So
[56:41] imagine the days of Moses, brother B,
[56:43] Aaron would go in there and be totally
[56:44] quiet except for the bells, right? Cam
[56:46] remember Cam preached on that. Holy,
[56:48] holy, holy. It just be quiet. Holy,
[56:50] holy, holy. He come out. Everybody's
[56:54] forgiven. The day of atonement's come.
[56:56] All your sins are forgiven. Ah,
[56:57] hallelujah. Glory to God. And they go
[56:59] out and sin the next day.
[57:03] One day they're all forgiven. Then it
[57:04] all s the next day.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; But with David, David gets the ark and
[57:10] as he's going in there, holy, holy,
[57:12] holy. I imagine David was out there a
[57:14] few times leaping, praising God.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; If he did it when they got it, I imagine
[57:19] he did it a couple times after.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; When when when Abathar goes in there,
[57:25] David's Let's praise God. Praise God in
[57:28] the sanctuary.
[57:30] Praise him in his mighty heavens. Praise
[57:34] him for his acts of power. Praise him
[57:37] for his surpassing greatness. Everything
[57:40] with breath. Praise God. Everything with
[57:44] breath. Praise God. Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And Abathar is like, "Holy, holy, holy
[57:50] is the Lord God Almighty." What I'm
[57:52] trying to say is their worship services
[57:54] were a lot better under David.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; When you've got the ark in your tent all
[57:59] the time, your worship services are a
[58:01] lot better. And the church said,
[58:04] &gt;&gt; "Not some dead service, but they've got
[58:06] praise." David set that up. God needs to
[58:09] be praised. Hallelujah.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Get some men and women with some gifts
[58:13] of the spirit on the instruments. Get
[58:16] some special singers. Get some clappers
[58:18] in here. Get some trumpet players. Let's
[58:20] have the gifts of God operating. Let's
[58:22] give God glory because God is here to
[58:24] answer our needs.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] It's the hardest I preach in a long
[58:32] time. Hallelujah. I appreciate the
[58:34] polls.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; So see church, when the ark becomes more
[58:40] precious to you, you worship more.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You'll praise God more because now it's
[58:47] like it's not just something, well, I
[58:48] read my Bible sometimes or I worship God
[58:50] sometimes. Every day you ought to
[58:52] worship God
[58:54] &gt;&gt; because it's in your tent now.
[58:56] Hallelujah. Hey buddy, if you need to,
[58:59] you and uh Claude, you need to put Jesus
[59:01] music on if you don't do that already.
[59:02] You need to put Jesus music on in the
[59:04] morning at your house.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; We got it going last week. I danced in
[59:08] the kitchen last week. Now, I got
[59:09] interrupted. I had to go take somebody
[59:10] to work. But I think Genevieve and I got
[59:12] started on a dance. Where's Genevie?
[59:14] Didn't we get started on a dance, Jen?
[59:15] Yeah, we because I just preached. I'm
[59:17] like, I haven't danced in my kitchen in
[59:18] a long time. Amen. It's time to get out
[59:20] the dances. Hallelujah.
[59:23] But see, this is what when the word
[59:25] becomes closer to you, that's what you
[59:26] do. You spend more time singing,
[59:28] praising God, giving God worship. You
[59:31] spend more time asking God what he
[59:33] wants.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; What does God want in your life, church?
[59:37] What does God want in your life right
[59:38] now?
[59:40] Hallelujah.
[59:42] What does God want in my life?
[59:44] Hallelujah.
[59:47] Last one. So, we've already gone through
[59:49] eight. Here's number nine.
[59:52] 2 Samuel 7:1 and2. I'm almost done. I I
[59:56] I forgot to set my timer. I moved it
[59:58] over there and I forgot to set my timer.
[1:00:02] This is the last mention of David with
[1:00:03] the ark. See now, I dwell in a house of
[1:00:06] cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth with
[1:00:09] curtains. Oh, yeah. Look, he got look.
[1:00:11] Oh, yeah. Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah.
[1:00:13] Came to pass when he sat in his house,
[1:00:15] the Lord had given him rest from all his
[1:00:16] enemies. Now, Brother Chris and I have
[1:00:18] been talking a lot this week, but
[1:00:20] brother Chris, there's going to come a
[1:00:21] time when you're going to get rest from
[1:00:22] all your enemies. Lena could say amen to
[1:00:25] that.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sure Austin could have some time.
[1:00:27] Vang Jose, you're going to have a time
[1:00:29] where you're like, oh, I don't feel all
[1:00:31] the enemies battling me so much.
[1:00:34] That's what David did.
[1:00:36] When David realized, my I've got victory
[1:00:38] over this. I got victory over that. I'm
[1:00:41] not struggling with that anymore. I got
[1:00:43] that. I got victory here. Then he starts
[1:00:46] thinking about, "Oh, I'd like to build a
[1:00:48] better place." In other words, I want
[1:00:50] God more permanent in my life.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I want a permanent dwelling place for
[1:00:55] God in my life. What could I build God?
[1:00:58] What could my life really accomplish?
[1:01:00] What do I want to do for God that would
[1:01:02] be just greater than what I've done?
[1:01:05] Oh my church, may God help us. Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; When we get to the spot where we get
[1:01:10] victory, that we can spend more of our
[1:01:12] time focused on what can I do for God.
[1:01:14] Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Do you understand, church? When you're
[1:01:17] fighting enemies, it's like, "God, do
[1:01:18] something for me. God, do something for
[1:01:19] me. God, do something for me." But when
[1:01:21] you get victory, it's what can I do for
[1:01:23] God?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Right. God, pour out your financial be
[1:01:30] blessings.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Pour out your power over temptation.
[1:01:33] God, give me this. Give me this. Give me
[1:01:35] this. But finally, David's like, "I've
[1:01:36] got it
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; now. God, what can I do for you?" Amen.
[1:01:41] What can I do for Jesus? Hallelujah.
[1:01:43] Glory to God.
[1:01:46] And it's the last mention of the ark.
[1:01:48] Brother Mercy,
[1:01:49] he's got all enemies. In other words,
[1:01:51] God has awakened in his life. What can I
[1:01:54] do for God?
[1:01:57] God has awakened. God is here. I don't
[1:01:59] have to talk about the ark. I don't have
[1:02:01] to dream about the ark. I can go to the
[1:02:02] ark.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; I don't have to talk about the message.
[1:02:05] I don't have to wonder what the message
[1:02:07] says. I can go to the message.
[1:02:09] Hallelujah.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now what can I do for God?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to build a house for
[1:02:17] God, a more permanent." In other words,
[1:02:21] I want every generation, Brother Jose, I
[1:02:23] want every generation to hear this
[1:02:24] message.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want all my children after me
[1:02:29] and my grandchildren of the Lord
[1:02:30] terrorists. I want all them to have a
[1:02:33] place where they can worship God.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; See, when you get victories over your
[1:02:36] enemies, now you start thinking about
[1:02:38] other people.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just your problems.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, each one of us has to
[1:02:47] have to battle little problems, right?
[1:02:49] Little no matter where we are. But I'm
[1:02:52] just bringing out the point. Once you
[1:02:53] get victory over all these temptations
[1:02:55] and they're all put under your feet, now
[1:02:58] you can put all your attention on God.
[1:03:00] What can I do for you?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; How can I impact the children, the
[1:03:05] children's children? How can I impact
[1:03:07] the next generation? That's one thing I
[1:03:09] like about my YouTube videos. They can
[1:03:11] impact people far beyond me.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Now, if YouTube goes down and goes to
[1:03:15] Rumble, I already got them saved. I can
[1:03:16] just upload them on there on Rumble,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; right? My books, I can pass those on
[1:03:21] down to the next generation. I want to
[1:03:22] leave something behind so that people
[1:03:25] knew what I believed. So people knew
[1:03:27] what the Bible says. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Something permanent for the next
[1:03:32] generation so that they'll know about
[1:03:34] the kindness of Jesus Christ,
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; the love of Jesus Christ, the power of
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Think about that today. What would you
[1:03:49] what would you do if you had all your
[1:03:51] enemies under your feet? Again, whether
[1:03:53] it was fear, lust, pride, money issues,
[1:03:57] job issues, if you had all that taken
[1:03:59] care of, what would you do? That would
[1:04:01] show whose heart you're after.
[1:04:04] If you were like David, you'd want to do
[1:04:06] something for God. God, what can I do
[1:04:09] for you? You have done so much for me,
[1:04:11] God. What could I do for you? You give
[1:04:14] me victory over pride and lust of the
[1:04:17] flesh and lust of the eyes. You give me
[1:04:18] victory over all my enemies and all my
[1:04:20] naysayers and all all all my critics and
[1:04:23] everything. You give me all these
[1:04:24] victories and none of them are bothering
[1:04:26] me. What could I do for you, Lord Jesus?
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; What a position to be in.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; What a position to be in when all
[1:04:35] enemies are under your feet.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:41] Now, I don't expect everybody to be
[1:04:42] there today, but you should be hoping
[1:04:45] for that. You should be praying for that
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; first. Get the ark in your life. Bring
[1:04:50] the ark and make a tent for it in your
[1:04:53] house.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like, let me share this. Rod
[1:04:56] shared with Malachi this week, and
[1:04:58] Malachi thought it was maybe a word from
[1:04:59] the Lord.
[1:05:01] Rod worked at a jail for over 30 years.
[1:05:04] I think he said it was the most
[1:05:06] demonpossessed place he'd ever worked
[1:05:07] in.
[1:05:09] And Malachi, correct me if I'm wrong. He
[1:05:11] tried going there just on his own power,
[1:05:13] just his regular time with God, maybe a
[1:05:15] few minutes. And he he was failing.
[1:05:19] So he had to make a decision. I don't
[1:05:21] have enough power to defeat the enemies
[1:05:23] there. He said, "I've got to get more
[1:05:25] power." So what did he do? He woke up at
[1:05:27] what, 3:00, 3 in the morning. He worked
[1:05:30] first shift. He got up at 3:00 a.m. so
[1:05:32] he could read the Bible for 45 minutes
[1:05:36] and then could pray for
[1:05:38] 45 minutes.
[1:05:41] And church, he told me when he walked in
[1:05:43] there the first day, everybody's
[1:05:44] blasphemy in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:46] all around. He told me he took oil and
[1:05:48] he put it on all might be able to see
[1:05:50] the leftover. I had it up there. You
[1:05:51] could used to see the I anointed this
[1:05:53] room with oil. It used to be up there. I
[1:05:56] don't know where it went. He said he
[1:05:58] went through all the cells, right? He
[1:05:59] went through everybody's cell while they
[1:06:00] were cleaning the the prison. He
[1:06:02] anointed with oil and he's praying under
[1:06:03] his breath. In Jesus Christ's name,
[1:06:05] sanctify this place in the name of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ. He said it took him six months,
[1:06:08] but by six months he only heard the name
[1:06:10] blasphemed only once or twice when
[1:06:12] before it was being blasphemed all day
[1:06:15] every day.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've got to fight spiritual
[1:06:20] battles."
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that's a man who won't accept
[1:06:25] William Brandham as a prophet of God,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; but he respects him.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; What should you and I do
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; when we know a prophet of God has
[1:06:33] visited this generation?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] What should we do? That that's what I'm
[1:06:38] saying. Are you willing? He was willing
[1:06:39] to go. He's a sanctified man, church. He
[1:06:42] was willing to go further than he ever
[1:06:45] gone to get a result he never had.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Getting up at 3:00 a.m.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; to make sure he could defeat the
[1:06:52] battles. The devil's at his job.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know where your devils are.
[1:06:57] You know where your devils are.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; You know, are they on the job or is it
[1:07:00] in your room,
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; right? Or is it in your car? Where are
[1:07:03] the devils batting you most? Fight back
[1:07:06] with the word of God.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Put the ark in its place.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I know you're getting tired. I'm not.
[1:07:17] Unfortunately, I'm just already I'm
[1:07:19] sweating. This the most I sweat a long
[1:07:20] time. You got to put the ark in its
[1:07:23] place.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's a great testimony.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's why before school, I always pray,
[1:07:29] read my Bible home. I know most times
[1:07:31] unless I sleep in and can't wake up this
[1:07:32] old tired carcass I got here.
[1:07:36] But you got to start you got to you got
[1:07:38] to get more power in here than the
[1:07:40] powers of darkness that you're going to
[1:07:42] fight against.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Now church. Now, now we're not ignorant
[1:07:50] of how to overcome. You've heard it.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; If you need victory on your job, if you
[1:07:55] need victory in your house, you've heard
[1:07:56] it. You've got to go further than you've
[1:07:59] ever gone if you want victories you've
[1:08:00] never had
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; because a man has walked in here and
[1:08:04] testified of it. And it's the it's the
[1:08:06] truth.
[1:08:08] Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Now, thank God I don't have that many
[1:08:11] devils at my work. Brother Mercy, I'm
[1:08:14] thankful. I just got little kids that
[1:08:16] get little demons on them and they jump
[1:08:18] off.
[1:08:21] But that man had demons filled up with
[1:08:24] his workplace. And he said, 'I knew that
[1:08:27] was the only way I could get the victory
[1:08:30] was to put the word in its place every
[1:08:33] single day.
[1:08:38] Okay, in closing,
[1:08:43] guess how long is that recording?
[1:08:47] Hour and eight. Oh, I got plenty of
[1:08:48] time.
[1:08:51] Do a few few more thoughts. Uh, I've
[1:08:54] been listening to spoken words original
[1:08:56] seed
[1:08:57] and uh, Brother Brandham says
[1:09:01] there's a secret to being the bride.
[1:09:05] You know, there's a secret for uh, my
[1:09:07] wife to be my wife. She had to accept
[1:09:10] all my advances, right?
[1:09:13] Oh, you're beautiful. Would you go out
[1:09:14] on a date with me? That was before I was
[1:09:16] a Christian. You know, she had to accept
[1:09:18] my advances. There's a secret. She had
[1:09:21] to accept my word, right? Like Lena had
[1:09:23] to accept Austin's word. Cia had to
[1:09:25] accept Vang's uh request over the
[1:09:28] internet.
[1:09:31] Hallelujah.
[1:09:33] There's a secret, Brother Ram says, to
[1:09:34] being the bride. And it ties in
[1:09:36] perfectly with the ark. Here is what
[1:09:38] brother says. Here's the secret. How
[1:09:40] many know the secret to being the bride?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; A couple people did. Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the
[1:09:50] bride.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That's it.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's the only secret to being the
[1:09:56] bride. You've got the ark in the bride.
[1:09:59] You got the ark under the tent. You've
[1:10:02] got thus sayith the Lord in your soul.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; That's the secret.
[1:10:15] Here's the secret. The word is in the
[1:10:17] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:10:20] what he wants done with the word
[1:10:24] and she does it in his name. She has
[1:10:28] thus sayeth the Lord. Now I'm not a
[1:10:30] prophet but I have thus sayith the Lord.
[1:10:32] We're supposed to gather more as we see
[1:10:34] that day approaching.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; We have thus sayith the Lord enter enter
[1:10:38] into his gates with praise and
[1:10:39] thanksgiving. Enter into his courts with
[1:10:41] praise.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. We have thus said the Lord. The
[1:10:45] five-fold ministry is going to bring
[1:10:47] unity to the bride and bring us to the
[1:10:49] stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, everything we're doing
[1:10:57] today is based upon thus sayeth the
[1:10:59] Lord. That makes us the bride because
[1:11:01] the the word is at the very heart of it.
[1:11:04] And the bride only does what is thus
[1:11:06] sayith the Lord.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's a good clue why we're in this
[1:11:11] church and not another church this
[1:11:12] morning.
[1:11:13] Hallelujah. Like I told you for years,
[1:11:15] if I found a church that was closer uh
[1:11:17] and Vang and I, that's why we started
[1:11:18] the church with my wife and the other uh
[1:11:20] the other four that we started. If we
[1:11:22] knew a church that was closer that had
[1:11:23] thus sayith the Lord, we'd close down
[1:11:25] house and go go support them. But we
[1:11:28] never have.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we stand with thus sayeth
[1:11:32] the Lord. The word is in our hearts.
[1:11:34] That's why we're not bride of Christ
[1:11:36] fellowship just by name. We're bride of
[1:11:38] Christ fellowship because the word is in
[1:11:40] us. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "How do you know?
[1:11:46] When someone speaks against the word,
[1:11:47] you speak for the word."
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram calls that the word test.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; When someone says something against the
[1:11:54] word, they've shown where they're at.
[1:11:56] And so you speak the word back. And that
[1:11:58] and then you pass the test, they fail
[1:12:00] the test.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's the secret, brother. Brother
[1:12:05] Claude, the secret to high school. Let
[1:12:07] me tell you, the word is in you.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Patrick,
[1:12:13] let me tell you the secret to high
[1:12:14] school. The word is in you.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris,
[1:12:20] let me tell you the secret to working at
[1:12:22] a Amazon or delivery company. The word
[1:12:25] is in you.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Jose is a grandfather. He's got all
[1:12:30] these grandchildren. Let me tell you the
[1:12:32] secret to being a wonderful grandfather
[1:12:34] and father and a great worker on the
[1:12:36] landscape and community. Brother, can I
[1:12:38] tell you the secret?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] The word is in you.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Major, I use you a lot. Can I tell you
[1:12:47] the secret to middle school?
[1:12:50] The secret is the word is in you.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Genevie, our newest
[1:12:57] Christian. Let's give her a round of
[1:12:57] applause here.
[1:13:01] Let me tell you the secret, Genevieve,
[1:13:02] to serving God as long as Vang and Jose
[1:13:04] has and Beatatric. Let me tell you the
[1:13:06] secret. You want me to tell you a
[1:13:07] secret?
[1:13:08] The word is in you.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Let's give God. Amen.
[1:13:17] It's not so much a secret anymore, is
[1:13:19] it?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's a secret.
[1:13:25] I wonder how I could get the victory. I
[1:13:27] wonder how I could get victory over all
[1:13:28] these enemies. My I fought the devil for
[1:13:30] so long. I've got a secret for you. The
[1:13:33] word is in you.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] Let me know. I'll call you up and
[1:13:39] whisper the secret in your phone
[1:13:40] sometime.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; The secret's in you.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; The word is in you.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; They do only his will.
[1:13:52] No one can persuade them differently. No
[1:13:54] one will persuade you to be baptized in
[1:13:56] father, son, holy ghost
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; or accept a sprinkling of water.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; No one be able to convince you of that.
[1:14:03] That's and that's the elementary things.
[1:14:05] Now, what about the other things? Well,
[1:14:07] it's God's will for you to have this
[1:14:09] gift or it's God's will for you to move
[1:14:10] to that there or go to that church or or
[1:14:13] it's God's will for you to this or this
[1:14:14] or that and the other. See how we need
[1:14:16] God's will more and more in our lives
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; because the questions shift. The
[1:14:20] questions change as our lives go on.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Should I go to college or not? All my
[1:14:28] friends quit. I went. I'm glad I went.
[1:14:30] I'm glad I heard the voice of God,
[1:14:31] Brother Chris. So, I get more time with
[1:14:34] my wife. I had to ask my wife this week,
[1:14:36] you know, or last week. I said, "Would
[1:14:37] it be better to have more money or less
[1:14:39] time with me?" She said, "I'd rather
[1:14:40] have more time with you." I said, "Thank
[1:14:41] you, Lord.
[1:14:43] I could use some more money. Who
[1:14:44] couldn't?" All these bills come up.
[1:14:48] I go to the dentist. It cost me $2,400
[1:14:50] to go to the dentist. That's before
[1:14:52] insurance.
[1:14:54] Just think about it. I mean, just think
[1:14:55] about how life changes.
[1:14:58] But we got to make choices.
[1:15:01] and other people, you know, and church,
[1:15:03] just trust God will guide those people
[1:15:04] the way he wants them to go if they're
[1:15:06] willing to listen to the ark of the
[1:15:08] covenant.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; They have thus sayith the Lord or they
[1:15:15] stand still. Then they do the works of
[1:15:18] God, for it is himself in them,
[1:15:21] continuing his word to fulfill as he did
[1:15:24] as he did not complete all the word in
[1:15:26] his day. In other words, Jesus didn't
[1:15:27] fulfill all the prophecies. There's
[1:15:29] something for you to fulfill. Pardon me.
[1:15:32] I got two more verses and I'm closing.
[1:15:34] Everybody take a deep breath. Ready?
[1:15:38] Round two. Here I go.
[1:15:41] John 5:20.
[1:15:45] Feeling a second wind of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:47] here. Hallelujah. John 5:20. Here's the
[1:15:50] verse, Brother Ram says that proved
[1:15:53] Jesus had the secret of God. Let's read
[1:15:57] it together. One, two, three. For the
[1:15:59] Father loveth the Son, and showeth him
[1:16:02] all things that himself doeth, and he
[1:16:06] will show him greater works than these,
[1:16:09] that he may marvel. This is the verse
[1:16:11] brother Ram uses to show the secret. The
[1:16:13] secret to high school, the secret to be
[1:16:15] a delivery driver.
[1:16:18] I'm a pastor, Malachi. What's the secret
[1:16:20] for me to be in the bride? Tell me
[1:16:22] what's the secret.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; What's in me? Word.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; The word's in me. Thank you. Sometimes I
[1:16:28] forget.
[1:16:30] Having all the trials in my life,
[1:16:31] sometimes I forget. What's the secret?
[1:16:33] How do I know I'm the bride? The word's
[1:16:35] in me.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; But where do I get the word? How does
[1:16:39] the word get into me? It comes from my
[1:16:40] father.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; See, you must have a close relationship
[1:16:44] with your spiritual dad.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; You must cry, daddy. Daddy, aba, father.
[1:16:50] Aba, aba, I don't know which way to go.
[1:16:52] I need your direction, Aba.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Aba, what what what do I do? I don't
[1:16:57] know what to do. Lord, show me. Amen.
[1:17:00] And church, you can use this verse.
[1:17:01] Lord, you showed Jesus, so you have to
[1:17:03] show me because I'm He was the firstborn
[1:17:07] among many brethren and I'm one of the
[1:17:09] brethren. How many brethren do we have
[1:17:11] here of Jesus here?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a couple. Amen. Thank God for
[1:17:13] that. Hallelujah. I'm one of his
[1:17:15] brethren because I follow him. Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; I was baptized in his name. Hallelujah.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I'm one of his brethren. Chris, you're
[1:17:22] one of the brethren. Praise God. You've
[1:17:24] been buried in the name of the Lord
[1:17:25] Jesus Christ. So all you have to say is,
[1:17:27] "Daddy, dad, show me. Show me what I
[1:17:30] need to do and I'll go do it."
[1:17:35] John 8:29. Let's read that one. My last
[1:17:37] verse.
[1:17:40] Let's read it. 1 2 3. And he that sent
[1:17:44] me is with me. The Father hath not left
[1:17:48] me alone, for I do always those things
[1:17:52] that please him. Let's stand to our
[1:17:53] feet. How many enjoyed the word today?
[1:17:54] Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Let's thank God for the word.
[1:17:56] Hallelujah.
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Here is the secret. The word is in the
[1:18:09] bride.
[1:18:11] Let's invite our musicians as well by
[1:18:12] God's grace. Let's get your Bibles like
[1:18:13] we do on Wednesday. Everybody get your
[1:18:14] Bible. Not everybody here was on
[1:18:16] Wednesday. That's understandable.
[1:18:17] Everybody's got work and things.
[1:18:20] Get your Bibles out here.
[1:18:22] The word has to be in you to be the
[1:18:27] bride.
[1:18:28] And brother Ram would later on go to
[1:18:30] show Mary had the word in her that made
[1:18:31] her the bride. Hallelujah. That made her
[1:18:35] the mother of the son of God. The word
[1:18:39] was in her.
[1:18:41] I like you to hold up against your your
[1:18:43] your heart, would you? Your natural
[1:18:44] physical heart. Hold up there.
[1:18:47] This is the secret to being the bride.
[1:18:51] I'm glad God whispers his secrets to us.
[1:18:53] Hallelujah. Amen. He lets us know that
[1:18:56] we're his bride.
[1:18:59] She only does his will. No one can
[1:19:03] convince her otherwise.
[1:19:08] Let's bow our heads,
[1:19:10] church. I don't know where you're at
[1:19:12] today. Are you at the spot where you're
[1:19:13] trying to fight off enemies like David
[1:19:15] was? You might be there. Maybe you're
[1:19:18] fighting off sickness,
[1:19:21] fear, doubt, discouragement, critical
[1:19:24] spirits,
[1:19:26] lust,
[1:19:28] uncertainty, financial difficulty,
[1:19:30] doubt.
[1:19:32] Maybe you're fighting an enemy today.
[1:19:35] Your answer is the ark.
[1:19:39] Your answer is inquire at the word of
[1:19:42] God.
[1:19:45] [Music]
[1:19:50] Now, I'm not going to ask you to raise
[1:19:51] your hands, but I would guess if I if I
[1:19:53] said, "Who's fat fighting an enemy
[1:19:55] today?" I'd imagine lots of arms would
[1:19:56] go up.
[1:19:58] Amen. I saw some heads nods. Praise God.
[1:20:03] I mean, you're in a fight right now. You
[1:20:05] might be fighting off an enemy, and
[1:20:08] you're just struggling
[1:20:10] to overcome this enemy. Remember,
[1:20:15] God's favor for you is proven because
[1:20:18] that enemy has not triumphed over you
[1:20:21] yet. That proves God favors you. You're
[1:20:25] still in church. You still got the right
[1:20:28] attitude. You're still sweet with
[1:20:30] people. You still love people. You still
[1:20:32] worship and shout and praise God. Some
[1:20:33] of you clap your hands today. Some of
[1:20:34] you raise your hands maybe are shouting
[1:20:36] for the first time in a while. Praise
[1:20:38] God for that. Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] But when God is moving in your life, he
[1:20:43] defeats the enemies. Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] As you let him.
[1:20:50] So that's one group. You're fighting
[1:20:52] enemies today. Or maybe you're at a spot
[1:20:55] where all enemies are under your feet.
[1:20:58] You're walking in victory.
[1:21:01] And so your prayer today is, God, what
[1:21:04] can I do for you?
[1:21:06] I don't need victory over my enemies. I
[1:21:08] already got it by your grace.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; You brought reproach upon my enemies.
[1:21:15] You smitten them on their backside and I
[1:21:18] stand as a as more than a conqueror
[1:21:20] today by the grace of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:23] You're in one of these two camps today.
[1:21:25] But church, thankfully for us, we've got
[1:21:28] the answer. No matter which camp you're
[1:21:30] in, you've got the ark against your
[1:21:32] heart.
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:35] As we pray, church, you pray for
[1:21:37] whatever you need. Listen, whether
[1:21:39] you're fighting enemies or whether you
[1:21:41] need something to do for God, pray for
[1:21:43] it.
[1:21:45] And then listen, we'll take a I'll set
[1:21:47] my timer. Let's listen for three
[1:21:48] minutes. And we Let's listen for three
[1:21:51] minutes and see if God would just speak
[1:21:52] something to your heart. Church, we
[1:21:54] don't spend enough time listening.
[1:21:55] Brother R said, we do all the talking
[1:21:56] sometimes. We need to listen to God.
[1:22:01] And church, I don't even don't even
[1:22:02] bother me if you sit down and open your
[1:22:04] Bible and start reading. If God puts a
[1:22:06] scripture on your mind, go read it. But
[1:22:08] let's go to the ark. Let's go to thus
[1:22:11] sayaith the Lord. That's what David did.
[1:22:13] That's what set him apart.
[1:22:16] So I was like, well, one time I'll spend
[1:22:18] half a minute reading my Bible to try to
[1:22:21] find God's will. Let's spend some time
[1:22:23] finding God's will. Let's pray.
[1:22:27] Father God, these are the people you
[1:22:29] placed
[1:22:31] under the sound of my voice to preach to
[1:22:33] them. Lord, most of them would call me
[1:22:34] their pastor. Lord, I imagine.
[1:22:37] Thank you, God, that the sheep have
[1:22:38] heard from the great shepherd today.
[1:22:40] Lord, I preach your word. This came off
[1:22:42] a lot different than I thought. Lord
[1:22:43] God, I pray for them in Jesus Christ's
[1:22:46] name. Lord, holding their Bibles
[1:22:49] next to their tent, Lord God.
[1:22:51] Hallelujah. That's what David did. It's
[1:22:54] what made him a man after your own
[1:22:55] heart. Hallelujah. He brought the ark
[1:22:58] into a tent. And Lord, this is symbolic.
[1:23:00] We're bringing the ark into our tents.
[1:23:03] Father, if they need victory over
[1:23:05] enemies, I pray you'd show them the
[1:23:06] victory. We went through Brother Rod's
[1:23:09] testimony. Hallelujah, Jesus. Lord, may
[1:23:12] we be willing to do things we've never
[1:23:14] done before
[1:23:16] to get victories we've never experienced
[1:23:18] before.
[1:23:20] Lord, I pray victory for the church. I
[1:23:22] pray against the enemies fighting the
[1:23:24] church in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh
[1:23:27] God, let us be victorious, Lord, for the
[1:23:28] glory of God.
[1:23:30] Bring a revival, Lord, if it's your
[1:23:32] season, God. May we not be sleeping on
[1:23:34] Jesus, but may we be awake unto
[1:23:36] righteousness. I pray,
[1:23:39] you know the thoughts intents of the
[1:23:41] heart, Lord. I don't.
[1:23:44] So, I pray for each person who needs
[1:23:46] victory over the enemies. May they hear
[1:23:48] from the ark,
[1:23:51] Lord. I pray for those who have the
[1:23:52] enemy under their feet. They're not
[1:23:54] currently addicted. They're not
[1:23:56] currently struggling.
[1:23:58] They're currently not under any
[1:23:59] condemnation. I pray for them that
[1:24:01] they'll look up to heaven and say,
[1:24:02] "Lord, what should I do for the next
[1:24:06] generation?
[1:24:07] What can I do for somebody outside of
[1:24:09] me? You've already given me the victory.
[1:24:11] Well, how can I help out others, Lord?"
[1:24:16] Now, church, I'm going to set a simple
[1:24:17] timer. Let's listen for three or five
[1:24:20] minutes. You talk to God.
[1:24:23] You got the ark.
[1:24:26] You know the secret of the bride. The
[1:24:28] word is in her.
[1:24:31] I'm going to pray for my life.
[1:24:37] Hallelujah. Let's start.
