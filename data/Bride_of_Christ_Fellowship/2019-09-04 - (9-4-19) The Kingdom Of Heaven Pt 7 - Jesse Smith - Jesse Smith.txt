by the grace of the Lord Matthew 13 verse 3 like to greet everybody the name of Lord tonight good to see the Saints in the house the Lord and thanks again for supporting the Sunday service with brother Nathanael I talked to him last night and he was really happy with how everything went he said we had a little strange visitor so he tried to talk to him and just know that in the future if that would happen you know we have to watch those people kind of closely and that's probably my fault I know I knew someone was bringing the person but I just thought he'd be a normal person I should have warned you know maybe Aaron or brother Amen or somebody to kind of watch him so I do apologize about that brother Nathaniel was concerned and he shared some of some concerns with me but thank the Lord that everyone was okay by a grace of God what I mean is that one of our visitors maybe had some mental trouble so I'm not sure if you could tell or not on Sunday but we thank the Lord that all as well praise God thank God for His grace Matthew 13 3 we had a wonderful time in Pennsylvania I'll be sharing some specific testimonies I there was it was such a wonderful move of repentance it was mostly in repentance numerous people came up for healing - I don't know who may have got healed though instantly I don't know if it'll be a if it was a miracle or if it'll be divine healing or how will work but on Sunday I want to give like some specific examples just to kind of show all of us that no matter what stage of life because we had young old very young come seeking the things of God was really beautiful and brother Jim said it was one of the best revival meetings they've ever had in the church so all glory to Jesus for that the Lord was leading Eve to fast and pray you know a couple days last week for the meetings and I'm sure some people were there fasting and praying as well but it was such a wonderful move of the Lord and I think our last service was five hours on Sunday so we got start at 11:00 and we got out of 4:00 p.m. so it was a la nice long service a lot of Prayer I still got my voice so I thank the Lord for that so praise the Lord Matthew 13 3 so praise God now I'd like to look at tonight with part 7 familiar parable I want to go a little deeper into it because I want to preach all these 16 parables we looked at last well we've been looking at the last few weeks and trust it'll be a blessing to everyone okay I was looking for something all right there's a little DAP tur all right it's Matthew 13 verse 3 and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where there where they had not much earth and for with they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them let's all read verse 8 if we can let's hear your voices and we'll join all of our voices together on verse 8 on three one two three but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold verse nine who hath ears to hear let him hear let's have a word of Prayer if you have anything on your heart just make it known unto God maybe through raising a hand or you know we're private requests in your heart I need the Lord's help here tonight Heavenly Father we love you Lord God Lord as as we go on serving you Lord those words ring more true that the longer reserved via the more we need you Lord God and we need the every hours that song says Lord it's made more clear to me all the time that I need you more every hour dear Jesus not less I need you more Lord so help me tonight I'm reporting from my post to duty Lord Jesus I need your grace bless the lady the Saints and all your people the young and old Lord and father just pray your spirit will bless us speak to us here tonight father we love you we want to hear from heaven dear God and we prayed for that Lord and I just pray that Lord each and every heart would receive your word and bless the Saints those here those live streaming that maybe couldn't make it and those that don't have a home church that are live streaming God may administer them may they find a good home Church Lord so they don't have to livestream anymore the father will give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you being seated notes have been I've used in the past about two years ago because this is at the parable on the four kinds of ground so I'm not quite ready for it yet then even I'll switch over in just a moment and do some teaching on the parables okay should be ready now the Lord willing we'll look at these here and I'll just to be a blessing to everyone so we like to look at this thought here and also this Sunday as we said carry in and then I like to preach one service will have two services one service I like to preach on the gifts of the Holy Spirit as we start looking at which gifts we may have and I really appreciate you know we've had people come up for prayer in the last few weeks and asking God to show them their gifts that's a beautiful prayer I've prayed the same thing in my life and and in fact almost the whole church on Sunday and now being came up for prayer to know their gifts or to be more diligent with their gifts so it was a really special time in the Lord I think anyone that really is sincere about Jesus Christ wants to know what gifts they've been given so that they can be faithful with them we know this is not a picnic kingdom this is a laboring in the kingdom that we don't join the kingdom of God to go to a picnic we join the kingdom of God that we might labor in the vineyard praise God and we might you know as it were climb up on those ladders and you know pick some apples out in the vineyard or labor and the hot Sun and you know we know we just got a labor one our church you know we're not much longer to labor so may God help us to labor more as we see that Day approaching praise God so I want to devote one service to looking at gifts and just come prayed up if you would I'll probably have like little sheets to pass out that's my what's what I got playing in my mind right now I don't have it printed out yet but I want to give everybody a sheet that has the nine gifts of the Spirit on it and descriptions of each and then you can write down where you've seen it in your life or in the life of saints here or it could be you know someone outside the church just so we have a better idea about the gifts of the Holy Spirit because most of us know pretty it's pretty clear about miracles divine healing tongues interpretation those are pretty clear okay but the ones we need many times to understand more our discernment wisdom and knowledge and I'm missing one or two there so so I want to look at that one service and then the other service I like to look at the Holy Ghost so I had some good questions from some of the Saints and I'd like to look at the Holy Ghost they were asking me about is the Holy Ghost a new birth or is it just the baptism so I want to look at that question on Sunday and what I'll do I'll probably call it rightly dividing the word because it's one of those subjects where brother Branham changed his teaching as the message went on and so we we want to we want to recognize that and then we want to find we want to find the foundation in the word so and we want to show that to you by the grace of the Lord so were good questions and I want to be able to help the Saints so Lord willing unless the Lord would change something he's of course all in control unless he would change something I want to look at that direction I'd like to set a date for communion so I'll try to text the church maybe let's shoot for October for another Lord's Supper and then I can I like to I like to let brother Aaron know so you can take off work and then anyone else like sister Connie maybe could take off work or maybe find the Sunday that Connie doesn't have to work and then all the saints can be here for the Lord's Supper praise God all right so let's look here to the Word of God here tonight let's look at part 7 and trust to be a blessing to you so let's review real quick those 16 parables and there are themes so you see themes in the the kingdom of heaven two of them deal with sin again the mustard seed and then the leaven hid by the woman and then three of them deal with the rapture or the Holy Ghost this is the parable of the wedding garment ten virgins course we owe the oil and the great supper that's when I was reading today and that one's you it just deals with excuses if you remember that they made three excuses and he made three calls that the the Bible just calls him a rich man it wasn't a king it just says a rich man made a feast a great feasts and he made three calls the first was rejected made light of the second one was calling the the main hall in the blind which looks like divine healing and then the last one was the highways and hedges and then Jesus and Jesus actually speaks it to a Jew so Lord willing maybe we'll look at that one next Wednesday because I've been studying on that one so it's spoken to the Jews because the man kind of cozy up to Jesus and he said oh Jesus he said blessed is he who eats bread in the kingdom of heaven and Jesus said let me tell you a parable buddy he kind of had to correct him a little bit because this man what the man was doing he was he was kind of like saying oh it's all okay in other words he's saying we don't have to worried about the present everybody's gonna be ok let's just look to the future but brother man warned us not to look to the future too much help us to see what God is doing right now and that's why Jesus had to adjust his thinking he said don't think about oh it's not don't think like the kingdom of heaven is something far off he said the invitations out now and that's what we need to see as well that's a mystery of the kingdom of heaven because Jesus calls it he's the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven are given to you to them they're not given because they don't want to accept the invitation alright so we'll look at that Lord willing maybe next Wednesday now five of them deal with salvation treasure in a field the Pearl great price laborers in the vineyard unmerciful servant and the seed cast in the ground now last week I was it last week yeah we looked at the wheat and the tares and the net cast into the sea and then the Jew and Gentile there's one parable on that how the kingdom was sent to the Jew but they rejected it and going to the Gentile and then we looked at the talents and pounds last week I believe it was and then today we'll look at the four grounds which is familiar but I do want to go over it again and add a few more thoughts if we can do that by the grace of the Lord all right so I'm gonna be pulling some quotes from this sermon I preached you can see when I preached it almost well yeah over three years ago okay so over and we were I think in that other sanctuary I just want to pull a few quotes from that in just a moment but let's hear now we read our text now let's go to it back to Matthew 13 let's go to verse 18 if you got your Bibles there so Jesus interprets this parable for us and here's the revelation if I try to challenge myself to put each revelation of every kingdom into one sentence and so this is the revelation of the sower and the foregrounds this is what I believe from the scripture and the message there are four heart reactions to hearing preaching about Jesus Christ you can only react in one of four ways to the gospel of Jesus Christ and that's fitting because four is a earthly number how many know that four is a number that always applies to the earth like the four winds right I got a whole list of them I can't remember all of them but there's a bunch for always deals with the earth now in verse 18 thank the Lord that he interprets this for us so church we can't we can't hardly get this one - wrong - too much because he gave us so many symbols verse 18 here he therefore the parable the sower when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside but he that receiveth the seed and stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it now this is one of the most deceptive ones because these people actually get excited about the word the first kind doesn't get excited it just goes off Satan snatches out their heart but this one they get excited about the word of the message but then in verse 21 yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while does he only believe for a while but when tribulation or persecution arises arises because of the word by and by he's offended now we've seen people go through this that have maybe they've lasted six months in them in their church some of last of the year year and a half two years some from other churches have last decades they believe for decades until some little thing rose up they got offended and they no longer believe the Word of God so this is quite a mystery that's why Jesus calls these mysteries he said to you it's given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given verse 22 he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful and verse 23 but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty now that church should remind us a lot of the parable of the talents and the parable of the pounds see both of those parables talked about an increase right we looked at that scripture how they abounded and so see we see the same thing here the most genuine believer is gonna grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord not get stale and stagnant we don't want to get stagnant with the Lord we don't want to come to a standstill with the Lord but we find that with Israel they just went around the same circle in the wilderness for 40 years they got stagnant and that's what a lot of people do in the message right they just they never try to seek God they stop fasting and praying they never get closer to God what happens is they just give themselves up to the cares of the world they become worldly message believers and they become stagnant there's no more hunger for God they don't really care to grow any closer to the Lord they're happy with what they know they're not beating their body and bring it under subjection they start getting bad habits and habits are spirits bad habits are demon spirits that get in people's lives and so we've got to really make sure we don't become this third ground where the cares of the world creep up in our lives bad habits form and we don't see the real genuine fruit of the Holy Spirit now Jesus gives us the interpretation now there can only be four reactions after hearing preaching about Jesus Christ because there's four grounds now this seed represents God's Word that's found in Matthew 13:19 the seed member of the seed last week represented you now the seed represents the word preached and the heart represents the heart of the ground represents the heart of the believer now this church should make us think about what Pontius Pilate asked when he stated what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ see you and I are gonna do something with Jesus that's called Christ see everybody's gonna hear about Christ everybody's gonna receive something about Christ and those that don't perhaps God will raise them up but in the Millennium brother branham says maybe they'll get a chance in the millennium to hear the word and be saved we don't really know for sure like let's but say aborted babies and something with that seed that ground has to be treated in one of four ways praise God and so what shall we do with Jesus see God is watching what you and I do with the word that we've heard remember the Bible says you'll either be two kinds of people come to church you'll either be a hearer or doer of the word how am I gonna be a doer of the word so you'll either leave Church doing what the preacher said what brother Nathaniel maybe one thing he was trying to say right if we could think about that if we could just add one thing from every sermon we heard that's like a hundred fifty things right because we about three services a week you would add a hundred fifty blessings or good habits to your life a year or maybe get back to a hundred fifty good things if you're repenting or renewing your strength - renewing your faith if you can just apply one thing from every sermon praise God then you know you'll be directed back to the Word of God and I encourage you to do that you know I see that in my life a lot where one thing I'll preach it'll come back in my life later that week so for example on Monday night I had a real evil attack from an evil spirit and I hardly slept at all Monday night I don't think I told my wife about it I had a real attack the enemy tried to come and attack me and so it was such a bad attack I just had to get up from the bed and go study the Word of God and pray because I thought if I don't do this I'm gonna get I'm gonna get an evil spirit on me it was such an awful attack right after great meetings you know we had some tremendous meetings and then the enemy comes on Monday night I can't can't even sleep and so see the very things I was preaching about and trying to get the people was those spirits came and tried to get on me but by the grace of God I only say that by God's glory by the grace of God he helped me overcome it met five hours of sleeps out five hours on Monday four hours last night so I'm really low on sleep this week but that's okay I realized Satan's trying to battle me but I've got to overcome this in church whether I'm tired or not whether you're tired or not no matter where do you got enough rest or not enough food or not you and I must be overcomers the Bible says in Hebrews 12 very few of us have ever resisted sin to bleeding right or to death which one of you have ever had to choose between well I obey the message or go to jail or I obey the message or get punched in the face you know none of us really have we haven't resisted sin unto like bleeding or death right but we have to resist sin to some degree so well I find many times I've got to resist sin Eve even if that means I don't get up sleep you might see like this I have to resist sin that I lose friendships people don't want to be around me so I've got to choose do I want to have more friends or less I'll take Christ give me Jesus praise God see we got to resist us something so there's gonna be some type of standard that we've got many times it's money you know we take a little extra money and break the word of God or we'll be a little poor but yet please the Lord see there's there's always a cost and we even teach on first grade there's what's called an opportunity cost whenever you have a choice I tell the first graders whatever you whatever you turn down that's that's the cost of it right and Jesus said if you wanted to be a disciple you got to count the cost you're gonna lose something you have to sacrifice something and Jesus says if you can't follow me daily and crucify the flesh daily he said you can't be my disciple you can't be a learner well if we're gonna be learners we got to crucify something every day and if we're not learning then we're what's called the Bible says forgetful here's where we forget even what was preached on Sunday we forget what was pre shell Wednesday night and that's what we're talking about you know these these certain kinds of grounds where people can come to church but if they are not doing what the the Word of God says and even the preachers if the preachers aren't living what they're preaching then it just becomes a backslidden condition praise God and and God is watching what we do with the word amen now I want to I want to move over to that slide I was trying to pull it up here and I'll just put it up there so everybody can see I'll just start with that now we're gonna get down to this there's four kinds of grounds we'll get to that a little bit but how many remember this when I put this up here of three years ago everyone remember okay some people do so everybody falls into one or two categories there's two destinies saved or lost and then the saved are called believers the loss the loss can have a make believer like lot or Lot's wife rather we'll get to that or like Judas we'll get to that a little bit or unbeliever there's two kinds of lawsuit so when we say there's three kinds of believers that's what we're talking about but then the Prophet gives us another revelation he said there's another class of believer called a foolish virgin there's a wise version a foolish version they're both saved but then we still have to make believer believer and you see it all throughout the Bible Abraham was wise but lot he was kind of foolish he was barely saved and then you have Lot's wife she was lost because she almost made it but she turned around and cried for the world see she was sad about losing things from the world we ought to be happy about losing things from the world right we ought not to look back and oh my like Jesus said any man who puts his hands to the plow and looks back he's not worthy of the gospel right and then the sodomites of course they were obviously firmly lost all right now let's look at this first kind of ground actually you know let me keep going here you'll see this in revelation 22 the Bible said at the time of Jesus's rapture he that's holy let him be holy still well let's read now let's get our Bibles here why don't we just read that I can see that revelation 22 11 so it's just so beautiful you know like I said we see these four types all the way through the scripture revelation 22 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that's holy let him be holy still praise God now remember so there's three kinds of believers in four classes so you have to save than the loss I'm just going through these kind of quick either saved and given a white robe of eternal life or you have to burn for some type of a amount of time but eventually you won't burn for eternally right no no loving God will let someone burn eternally just for like 15 or even a hundred years of sin God would never be so evil horror so hard-hearted to make somebody burn eternally without end just for a few years of unbelief or a few years of sin at some point they'll stop stop existing they'll be annihilated and that's Scripture there's lots of scripture on that so here's the four classes you have the save you have the elect the wise virgin you have the foolish virgin the Gentiles and Jews that were the souls under the altar oh yeah these had these were the Jew or Gentile with Holy Ghost oil you have the loss you have the make believer that's Judas he was filthy because Jesus said remember he said all of your clean except one of you remember that and then like Pharaoh he was unjust he never believed in the first place so you can see all these all the way through the Bible and I already showed you Abraham and there's a few examples there as well so two destinies I'm gonna skip past that we're pretty familiar with that you know the Bible call it's the saved or vessels of mercy they're called wheat they're called sheep they're called children of God they're called good seed The Lofts are called vessels of Wrath tears goats children of Satan and bad seed praise God and then there's three kinds of believers now we saw that believer make believer unbeliever now I'm gonna skip past that program oh we're familiar with that now here's where brother Ram said there's another class of believer so I want to read that to you I'm gonna skip this for times sake okay she but indeed she shall be with him and his throne this speaking of the bride now the bride the wise virgin the holy person but not more than righteous but holy she shall be with him Christ in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in the section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world secondly there's another class so see how brother Branham categorizes it he calls it another class huh me know that brother Branham worked about four years on the church age book does anyone know that for years and there's tapes where brother Branham would he would make audio notes with lavell on how to correct the church age book and brother Branham said he was warned of God to preach the seven Church ages when he saw JFK become president a Catholic president the first Catholic president he was warned of God to show the people what our were living in so that God's people might be ready for the rapture amen and so he worked on this for five or four years from the end of 1960 and then all the way to 1965 so he says secondly there's another class he said their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the bride not having been born again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life praise God help me understand that is that is that clear okay I hope it is by the grace of Lord so another class we have to remember that brother Adam used those words another class now some people don't like the church age book but you'll never find a quote about that some people have stories which they may be true I don't know but some of you have stories and they say you know brother Ram was eventually against the church age book I never find that in any of the quotes I always seem promoting it he's happy about it he calls it his commentary he says if you've got any light at all on you you'll see truth in the church age book so I don't see any reason to doubt that this book was rebel Aidid truth to us from God all right I'm gonna skip past that Judas is the third type and then Balaam Oh baylin's a third type as well and finally those ones were never on the books of life okay so now we can see now we can see the wise virgin is called the bride the foolish version Judas and Balaam are like the make believers and then there's unbelievers who never believed in the first place now there was four crosses when Jesus died I'm not gonna take time to read the quotes but Judas was actually on a tree because the Bible said cursed it is he who hangs on a tree Jesus took the curse of all of us thank God and the Bible said he died on a tree because that where the cross was made out of a wood from a tree so Jesus was the the wise version the foolish version was the safe thief on the cross Judas was the lost I'm sorry to make believer and then the lost thief was the unbeliever now for the earthly number brother Graham said and for classes a clear Bible doctrine okay so I'm just ranking those down so you can see it and then here I'll just stop right here so here we see the four types of grounds there's a good ground thorny ground stony ground and wayside ground first Peter 4 says there's elect believers righteous believers ungodly believers and sinners and Enochs day Enoch was raptured Noah had to go through the tribulation borderline believers were those who maybe hung around Noah but then rejected him and then we have mockers those that mocked Noah the Bible said just like in the days of Noah there'll be mockers in the end time I'm glad I'm not mocking the things of God I'm blessing the things of God hey men praise God so now let's look at this here these let's look at these four kinds of grounds we're gonna start right here with the wayside now the wayside is someone that hears the word but does not understand it the birds present Satan the wicked one and they snatch away God's Word from the person's heart birds usually represent Satan as you'll see in other parables all right the heart that ultimately rejects God's Word is lost and not saved Jesus says most people fall into this category wayside because Jesus said few there be that find it all right and that's Matthew 7:14 few people will find this narrow road up here this Enoch Road amen this dedicated Road amen hallelujah thank the Lord now the second ground is another sad heart condition called the stony places this person rejoices over the word for a season and he can believe for a while the Bible says but then he rejects the truth due to tribulation or persecution you got your Bibles let's read that let's go to Luke 813 so you can see that Luke 813 if you got your Bible I want you to see that see the Bible says you can believe for a while and people that say once saved always say we talked about that the only way that's true is if you're for ordained and predestinated the salvation by God's foreknowledge but doesn't mean that every person that receives or believes a seed is gonna be saved that's clearly not right in the parable whoever was foreknown whoever God foreknew they would believe yes they can never be lost but those who who God knew would fall away like the Judas like the Balaam like mrs. lot of course they they won't be saved if they reject salvation now Luke eight thirteen they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away now recently even this weekend we were fellowship in and and we were we were trying that we were we were discussing people that that we've known the message that came to the message but they never ever shown any joy at any time of their their time in the message and that's true there's there's been some people we've known I've known and other ones have known we were talking over there and it was so sad they came to church this their whole lives and never ever showed any joy about the word some people have been amongst us and church they never said Amen one time some people have sat in our services and never come up for prayer one time can you imagine that means they think so little of yours your prayers and my prayers they never asked for our prayers when the Bible said we should always pray for one another praise God we've sat amongst people that never came up for prayer never said one Amen never showed any joy about the things of God never Shout in the spirit never songs never cried never wet down at the altar oh my thank God for believers who yield all their emotions to God but see there's some of us that have come around us that have never even expressed joy about the things of God but see at least see at least these people these stony people at least they show some emotion see our emotions are good as long as they line up with the Word of God God wants your emotions to be used but only as they line up with God's Word emotions don't prove God it's God's will what proves God's will is the revelation of God's Word that proves God's will when something comes to pass but just emotion itself doesn't mean it's from God because we've all seen emotional people that get off the word right they make emotional decisions thinking it was God but it's really not God so it's got to be emotion well the RAM said don't look for a motion but a motion comes with it that's quite a balance I know it I know it may be a little deeper but but what you want what I mean is that a heart that loves God no matter how emotional before they make the decision they'll go back to the word and make sure that decision lines up with God's Word praise the Lord that's right they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away so this is the kind of person like Judas they love they love God but they end up not loving God as much as they love money or as much as they love the world or as much as they love popularity or fame or a relationship or another man or woman they actually love that man or woman or that lust or drug addiction or whatever they actually love that more than they love God may God help us to put God first in our lives may we love God with all of our hearts Souls mind and strength because these love God for a while but then they end up loving the things of the world more than they love God see they fall away that's why I knew you know when I was battling Monday night you know that's why I knew this is a temptation also I going to do it took me a while you know I thought about it for about an hour like wait this is a battle this is a demon power I've got to get up and do something about that see I didn't want to get up because I don't want to lose sleep but I wasn't gonna get sleep anyway with those demon powers battling me hey man I had to get up and pray reading my Bible and go study a little bit and I got the victory praise the Lord my heart I mean when I laid back down my heart was so clear and pure before God I know it sure is because I went through anything I know what I'm talking about because I experienced it amen see I'm not I'm not one that likes to miss sleep I hate missing sleep because then I start you know I don't know not as sharp as I need to be but I just realized that God was allowing me to go through a trial to make sure I lived what I preached because I preached really hard we had a couple preachers come up and say my brother Jesse he sure is a hard preacher but it's the truth he's they said see so the devil was testing me now of course God allowed it right and what good is a sermon if it's not lived anyway right so God allowed it so I could be an overcomer so I thank the Lord I thank the Lord for His grace and mercy so hope everybody can see that the the stony ground believes for a while but they don't have the deepness of God's Word in their hearts and I read this to you a few weeks ago I don't know if you remember it maybe it was months nine weeks and months get all intertwined I know I say that all the time but brother have said the reason people turned down the word is because they don't pray enough he said they don't dig down deep enough in revelation amen he said you got to dig down deeper and prayer to get in the spirit of Revelation hey glory and here's what it says that's what the scripture says here for a while they believe but they don't have the deepness of a Christian heart in other words they don't have a deep sincerity for Jesus Christ they're not sincere enough they've got to go a little deeper right dig a little deep or get more sincere dig out like what man so you got to dig out like Isaac had to dig out well after well and that third well was the one that did it praise God the third labor of love digging out all the world and finally struck a well a water well amen she had to dig it all move out all the trash praise God move it all out and then dig down deep enough to get in the spirit of Revelation Oh hallelujah praise God see the rejection occurs because there's no root in himself meaning no deep genuine love for Christ because Paul says Christians are rooted and grounded in what never said look see that's why it's stony that's why it's Tony they're not rooted in the love of God because Paul says we're grounded in love so see their roots are in stony things right but not in the real fertile soil of the love of God amen hallelujah thank you lord that's beautiful beautiful Scripture Jesus says this type of stony hard experience starts off excitedly lasting longer than the wayside but then slowly withers away but the Bible says in psalms 1:3 that the godly have leaves that shall not wither glory real Christian love is not wither away Jude describes apostates as clouds without water and trees whose fruit withereth if you went to my house right now I could show you our apple tree boy it would look pretty good a few weeks ago but now all the apples are withering away I looked at some of them this week when I was mowing I thought man I'm gonna go up and eat one of those though it looks juicy it was a from a far away off but as I got closer I started looking at I think there's some wormholes on there and the one I grabbed I turn around its rot it looks good on one side rotting on the other that's about a lot of church members lives they look good at church but turn around and go to home they're rotting praise God and they're withering away instead stronger more excited more thankful for God they're more bitter they're more they're more upset they're more depressed right they're more distressed instead of being more confident in the things of God they're less confident you would be surprised how many I'm sure it went Sunday but you'd be how many some surprised how many people need a prayer just for doubt they just doubting God doubting if they're believer doubting if they're born again just doubt battling doubt but see we should we should be able to grow beyond that now we all go through trials remember God said he'll never give us a battle that we can't handle see growth not decreasing not rot and withering away I'm getting weaker and weaker and weaker we've got to grow stronger who the Bible said when you're planted by waters your fruit will not wither amen and that's the waters of the Holy Spirit hallelujah thank you Lord amen say boys we should always be drinking on the waters of life drinking from the fountain right from the rivers of the waters of life glory see it's clear the stony places heart is apostate which means they reject the word and they're lost because they're withering away and dying just as the wayside heart now the third ground now this is the one we really got a watch church if you're sincere if you up Dave if you are your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life section then this is the one we really got to watch for how many can say amen to that well Graham said there's three things you got to watch for and later to see them down so I wouldn't forget I always forget one of them there's three of them I don't know why I can't remember the third one but they're soft living riches and nervous tensions so Graham said our age has three things to worry about soft living we're life so easy don't work too hard don't labor too hard for Jesus I don't have to fast you know you don't have to I'm not of course we don't talk we don't say that the nursing mothers nursing mothers need to eat because they're feeding another baby now unless God supernaturally somehow feeds you and the baby but see soft living where Christianity is not you know it doesn't it doesn't cost anything there's no sacrifices see you just come to church let the preacher sacrificer let the musicians or let brother so-and-so or sister so and so let them sacrifice but me I don't want to sacrifice anything I just want to have a nice simple humble or eat I'll say not humble a nice easy week see what Jesus said and brother branham said Christianity is all self-sacrifice amen that's all Christianity is a sacrificing amen because the Bible said not only do you sacrifice one time what the Bible say you are a living sacrifice so you're constantly applying yourself to sacrifice yourself I could do this I could live a little softer but I'm gonna choose the harder way because I love Jesus because I know I've got to live for others I can't live for myself cuz that's not gonna it's not gonna do any good for the kingdom of God I've got to live for others and then riches right putting all your money saving all your money for yourself now you should save if you need a retirement yes you should save but like just like John Wesley said save as much as you can and give as much as you can just do do more you know just do a little more right but don't Shrive for worldly riches don't make that your goal because riches are fleeting they're here today gone tomorrow and no man or woman on her deathbed ever said I wish I had more money nobody ever said that they said I wish I had more time I wish I had more love right like I've talked to who was recently but someone would say and we were talking that they wish that they could have an order person was getting ready to die I forget who it was man what was it and they were saying they wish they they could love their their family more that's the one thing they wanted was to love their family more that's what they regret it and their life may God help us and not have regrets like that redeem the time by the time back use the time for God's will amen love your family love those closest to you redeem the time but see the us that's the two soft living and riches then the third one nervous tensions did you know brother Ram said I think I put this up here a few weeks ago how many remember abode Ram said nervousness is the worst feeling you can ever have like nervous tension and that's one of the demon powers we fight most in Laodicea a nervous person and brother bran also calls it it's someone who crosses bridges before they get there they worry so much about that appointment next week mother got all figured out I'll do this or maybe the next the next deal they're gonna do they they cross they they get everything in their mind all lined up before they even get there and brother Branham had to teach people to get rid of that and he had to teach them instead of worrying and plant now it's okay to plan but when you go overboard it becomes a sin because it's a nervousness it's a nervous spirit so boat ran would tell those people instead of nervousness seeing at home how many of you sang in your kitchen while you're cooking or Eden this week I was singing last night because I was thinking about that like Lord I got to create a better atmosphere sing he would tell those nervous people sing all day I think he said in one place sing all day but those are the three things we got to watch out for that they're gonna try to choke out your life and suffocate the life of God or God's life breathing in you because it chokes the word it doesn't let the word have life cares I'm sorry nervous tensions riches and soft living now this is called thorny because it receives seed with and thorns spring up and choke it making the plant unfruitful so see it had little addictions and habits that we're living in their lives and there's a load of people that were pending of those two habits things that are growing up something has life in my heart that shouldn't have life in my heart there's something living in my heart that I'm feeding and I shouldn't be feeding it right I've developed a bad habit and I shouldn't have this habit this habit should die but then they let it grow up and it's okay brother so-and-so sister so-and-so does it I don't matter it matters what the word says varies God when we never judge ourselves by other churches we never judge ourselves by anyone else other than Jesus Christ can we take wisdom from brother Branham yes can we take wisdom from that brother yes but we've ultimately got to align ourselves up and look in the mirror of the word not look in the mirror of pastor so-and-so er sister so-and-so or brother Zones oh no we don't look at anyone else we don't commend ourselves for to ourselves like Paul says we have to look to Christ for our example hallelujah so this third heart here's the word and get some little growth goes for a while that seed grows up but then it chooses the care for the world riches and pleasures more than Christ although this heart lasted much longer than the previous two it still missed the ultimate goal of Christianity which is fruitfulness fruitfulness is the goal of Christianity the goal of any wheat plant is to what produce ripe kernels so you can you can break them off I forget the name of that winnowing process and then grind them up and make what wheat flour that's the whole point of it is fruitfulness what good is the apple tree if it doesn't fourth fruit Jesus wants us to bring forth fruits to serve our God ordained purpose think of how rare how many people do you know that bring forth the fruit of love that they love Christ more than everything else I mean everything a fruit of love how many people you don't have the fruit of joy they have that genuine joy of the Lord peace who has the peace of God in their heart because it's rare because this is the rarest kind of heart this good ground it's the rarest kind of ground it's very hard to find amongst even churchgoers who has long suffering that even if you say something wrong and you hurt them they still love you back with long-suffering who has that who has gentleness that when you you that you're mean to them they're gentle back to you they don't bite your head off faith who's really expressing faith or revelation the will of God with real maturity how about meekness so meek that they never they never exalt themselves they always humble themselves and how about temperance or self-control that's what I was preaching I'm pretty hard over there or it's about people that they have no control over you know eating sugar late too many sweets too many donuts they drink too much night coke they can't live without it and it causes diabetes and cancer I just saw another article this week that said soda causes cancer like how many warnings do people need see they have no temperance then they can't control that if they can't control the natural things how can they control the spiritual things like their tongue they can't they can't do it and that's a fruit of the Holy Spirit when you're planted by Jesus Christ I'm sorry yeah by His Spirit you're planted by the Spirit of water then you'll produce temperance you're able to control your appetite you're able to control your words you're able to control your your passions your sensual bodily passions that we all have you're able to control that because so mature you're so strong because you're planted by the rivers of the Spirit thank the Lord uh-huh thank you Jesus Jesus said he chose the disciples to go forth and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain Paul warns all Christians that riches can cause believers to follow the temptation snares and to many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition Paul's advice to Timothy a man of God is to flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness we shall literally run from the prosperity gospel we should literally run from nervousness we should run from the riches we should run from soft living he said flee these things run from them and follow after a dedicated life Paul prophesied in 2nd Timothy that men in the last days are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God that's what the Bible says but of course these people can be saved as we saw earlier with the quote that we saw from brother Branham so examples are lot and the thief on the cross I have them up there no I don't have them let me see if I got it on the next one I thought I did it there bear with me I thought I oh sorry about that I want to just put those names up there so everybody could see him I just want to it the highlights of this so we're all focused on the the kingdom of God sorry I should have looked this up earlier I was looking for the actual names on there okay there yeah that's so kind of one oh yeah so there you have Judas then you have mrs. Lotte the safe thief yeah there it is saved still a believer but he lived a life as a murderer right he murdered that's why he was like the other Barabbas Barabbas was released but the one that was on the other side that died they were both thieves and they were both murderers so they died right by Jesus they were died justly Jesus died unjustly and so we see they can still be saved like lot and the repentant thief all right now and then Paul says a man can be saved but suffer the all loss of reward so let's read that real quick since we got our Bibles 1st Corinthians 3:13 let's go there in the scripture see love is the greatest motivator if you love God he said you'll keep my commands so these these people that are saved they love God but they don't love God as much as the others because they love they love some habits they love some worldliness rather than loving the word like they ought to praise God all right so I said 1st Corinthians 3:13 every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is now that includes me that includes every preacher that includes each one of us the fire we'd say the fire of trials will test every one's ministry to show what they're made of because the Bible said the fiery trials of our faith the trials we go through will prove if we've really got what we say we got verse 14 if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward see his work has to withstand the fire verse 15 if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire and the best example of that is right here all of lot's all of Lots possessions were burned in Sodom Haven praise God what was any of Abraham's reward burnt no sir hey hey man why cuz he was looking for the promised son and you and I need to look for the promised son Jesus Christ lot forgot about the promise son so everything he was living for was burned by fire and brimstone he got two daughters out and produced a moab backslidden nation right I never really believed to begin with so all of his investments in his entire life was burned by fire I don't want that kind of testimony so see we we have to remember lot looked at Sodom and he saw the money so he went towards money rather than you know staying see could have stayed somewhere else I remember him and Abraham couldn't stay together there was enough room for their cattle but he could have chose somewhere else but instead of choosing somewhere else he chose for money and he chose to hang around the homosexual community right that's right but see Abraham said I know better than that and so Abraham's ministry was this Abraham's ministry was this Church he was praying God if 50 say 50 if there's 45 if there's 30 if there's 25 if there's 10 that was Abraham history abraham's ministry was prayer ministry amen he had the prayer ministry and he was trained in his family he was trained his servants with the commandments of God but lot was over there sitting at the gate as the mayor as a leader and he's trying to judge between these sinners what you say it would this homosexual person what violent crime did they do and he would try to judge and the Bible said everything he saw and hurt everyday MEXT his righteous soul he saw the evil he heard the evil words everything tormented him he lived a life of torment but Abraham was out here as a prayer where he had peace with God amen because he separated himself from the things of the world we must separate ourselves from things that torment us and that's the life Abraham lived as a child of God because he kept the good ground of his heart where as lot he was kind of let's see it shows lots heart was a little off because his wife was lost perhaps his wife you know encouraged him to move down to Sodom but we know scripture just says that he saw it and he saw the welled gardens of Sodom it looked like the Garden of Eden he thought and so he he was influenced by riches he was influenced by money and power as a mayor because he sat in the gate judges always sat in the gate mayor's leader sat in the gate he was more influenced by that than by living a life free from sin and I was gonna tell testimony I'll say that for Sunday cuz that that thought brought someone to the altar alright just a moment here all right so can everybody see that you can be saved but yet with no reward see that you can be saved but have no reward that's the thorny ground there's a thorny ground they'd have no fruit they'd have no reward to show for all that labor because it was done in vain cuz they love they let other things grow up they fed other things other habits rather than the godly habits of the Lord so true so true all right now all right let's look at this final kind of ground here how we doing on time pretty good let me check I got a few notes I want to make sure I I go through okay I got those oh yeah I'll save one for the end now this fourth kind of ground is the good ground that brings forth fruit in one of the three quantities either get 30 fold 64 or 100 fold Jesus caused this I love it let's read this let's go to Luke 8:15 you got your Bible I love what Jesus calls us this is so wonderful Luke 8:15 look what Jesus calls this good heart or the good ground heart but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience can you say amen to that so that means this heart isn't as honest right if this heart is totally honest with God and Britain keeps the Word of God so that means this heart doesn't keep all the word and isn't exactly honest I say brother how you doing sister how you doing you say oh I'm okay but yet all rowdy you're not okay are you honest then or not that's why I like people if you're not doing good just say well I'm not doing as good as I need to do can you pray for me praise God this this kind is not as honest they're not as honest in their hearts as they should be now I'm not I'm not saying to go like program said I'm not saying to go bragh on the devil the devil's beating me up brother Aaron this week my he's kicking me to the curb let's not praise the devil okay but just be honest say you know I'm really struggling can you pray for me I want to be an overcomer can you can you pray with me please see honest honest but what do we have and sister Beatrice will know this she been around the word a long time how you doing if you are cup people how you doing and they say fine but yet they're lying through their teeth pretty soon they're out in the world pretty soon give him a few weeks or months we know that right so see an honest and good heart so rare to find someone that can be honest and tell the truth and keep the word that's being heard that's right see they here the word they keep the word and then they see the fruit of their lives hey man thank you Jesus with patience one of the fruits of the spirit see they're patient I know if I do good if if I by God's grace if God helps me if I just keep doing the good habits I keep investing in the Word of God I keep crucifying the flesh I keep these habits going I know if I keep doing this I know I'll bring forth patience I'll bring forth the fruits of the Holy Spirit see if you're honest hearted Christian you'll produce the nine fruits of the spirit because you're honest about your spiritual condition you won't let money riches or pleasures choke your love for God's Word as you love God with all your heart soul mind and strength you'll hate even one sin you'll hate even one stain upon your beautiful white garments James says pure religion is keeping yourself unspotted from the world the Bible says you won't let one evil root of bitterness spring up and trouble your heart because you're completely focus on seeing an abundant harvest for the Lord's glory amen you all let one root of bitterness or root of anger or anything root of depression root of doubt you all let one root of doubt rise up in your life you'll have it weeded up by the the great Master Gardener the Lord Jesus praise God that music on do anyone hear music a key thing is like one of my computer's like here like a instrumental music alright so we've seen those examples I'm almost done here oh yeah times fine when you have in the glorious time now we see the four kinds in Abraham's day we see the four crosses now here's one we didn't get to I like to see it is second Timothy to verse 20 let's go there second Emily to verse 20 this is one you may not have seen too often 2nd Timothy 2:20 thank God if God calls us to have a good heart then God has to make a way for us to get there it's through a honest and good heart praise God a heart that loves the word more than anything else he's got to make away and that way is love hallelujah love love the Lord your God the first and greatest commandment and that Jesus said you're not far from the kingdom love the Lord love the word love obedience love to sing love to worship love the preaching love to read your Bible love to pray love God with all your hearts love 2nd Timothy 2:20 but in the great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also wood and earth and some to honor and some to dishonor ok here it is right here yeah here's the the row gold so there's kind these are all the kinds of vessels in house gold silver would earth notice there's four there's always see God's placing them in for God is speaking to us through the number four all right so see the gold represents good ground silver the thorny wood the stony and earth is the wayside obviously gold is more valuable or useful or better than silver just as Samuel told Saul that David was better than he was right God saw David's life was more useful than saws because of David's pure heart okay wood and earth are dishonorable disposable vessels showing that the two hearts are lost the wood and earth was an honorable vessel did you know that Jesus literally called him a chosen vessel huh me know that hey Laurie Paul was a chosen vessel praise the Lord to bear his name to the Gentiles Kings and Israel the Bible calls Pharaoh a vessel of dishonor and that's in Romans 9 17 to 23 now here's a beautiful scripture proverbs 16:4 let's read that proverbs 16:4 alright proverbs 16:4 it's a beautiful scripture right here so this scripture shows that God has all kinds of vessels and they all have a purpose proverbs 16:4 the Lord hath made all things for himself yay even the wicked for the day of evil see God has a purpose for every kind of vessel so these wicked vessels over here would an earth they have a purpose it's for the day of destruction it's the day of judgment they've got a purpose to be burned but these other vessels have a purpose to be used by God praise the Lord let me look here I may have one or two more thoughts and I got at least one more but let me look here at my notes okay let's now let's go to Luke 14 here yeah Luke 14 18 [Music] there's only four reactions to the preaching tonight Haven glory you'll react in one of four ways tonight's sermon how many believe that that's right so this sermon is either having one of those four effects it's either fallen by the wayside falling on stony ground it's falling in a heart that's all kind of clogged up with thorns bitterness roots of sin or it's fawn on a good ground an honest heart that's the kind of heart we want tonight Luke 14 verse 18 it's my last thought now this is the parable the great supper I'll preach Lord willing the whole message on this one and the parable the king's son because they're very very similar there's a few differences kind of like the talents and the pair and the pounds they're very very similar let's just start up 16 Robert oh sorry Luke 14 16 then he said to him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must go I'm sorry and I must needs go and see it I pray thee have me excused now can everybody see what is this ground talking about this ground is the cares of the world can Bri see that isn't that such a ridiculous excuse he's like mom I want to go look at my ground I just want to see it the king is like I've got everything ready Maya the food is hot and you sisters know how hard you work on dinner don't you and the Kings got all his his cooks got it all laid out you can smell it even the desserts but the guys like yeah yeah the gospel smells good to you but let me go look at my ground that I bought I'm really gonna transform this property look at my hills look at my lakes look at my rivers what a foolish thing to do the cares of this world why would you care so much about the property when you've got all the feastings of the king you got all the delicious tastes when there's a tablespread where the saints of God are fed Oh hallelujah come and dine hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus praise God a memorable Ram said that's what brother Neville was feeding the people the whole time remember the the dream said that sister had a dream earned her husband mr. Collins I think it was and they had a dream that brother Neville was delivering all the most delicious food in the tabernacle and they got scared and ran from it but brother said no see that's the message that we've been feasting on this whole time so live preaching when it goes right to the word is the most delicious food you can eat oh yeah because it's eternal life it's the word in due season and it's the most delicious food so see this land is the cares of the world he cared more about this land than he did about the great supper next in verse 19 and another said I bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused now here we see the deceitfulness of riches right because these oxen would eventually allow them to plant seed and go harvest and then go sell it for money so the first guys just like look at my land then the next guy is like well I'm gonna go make some money I've got to go get the seen the ground I've got to get rich I've got to have a harvest rather than feasting on the things of God of course the last one and another said I've married a wife and therefore I cannot come he's a newlywed so what is he interested in the pleasures of life there's nothing wrong with being married but when a great man asks you to come to a wedding I'm sorry comes to a great supper you should come to the great man supper praise God because this is such a rare thing to be invited to the supper of the key or the great man praise God but see this guy looked at his relationship and he said well I love this relationship more than I love the
