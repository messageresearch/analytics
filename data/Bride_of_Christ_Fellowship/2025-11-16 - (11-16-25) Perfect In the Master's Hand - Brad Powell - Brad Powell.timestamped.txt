[3:04] enjoy the fellowship. We'd love to have
[3:05] you. So um if you would let's just go
[3:09] ahead and stand. We'll get into the
[3:10] word. And is it okay if I take this coat
[3:12] off?
[3:15] Okay.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, here we are. Right here.
[3:21] Can't fight with a coat on.
[3:25] If you would turn with me, if you would
[3:26] in the scriptures to the book of Job,
[3:30] the book of Job. And while you're
[3:32] turning there into the to the book of
[3:34] Job, I want to just read you something
[3:36] that the prophet says. And he he's
[3:38] quoting Revelations 1:6. And he says,
[3:41] "He hath made us kings and priests unto
[3:43] God and his father. To him be glory and
[3:46] dominion forever and ever."
[3:49] &gt;&gt; And he goes into the quote in the church
[3:50] age book and he says, "He hath made us."
[3:54] He says, "Oh, there's certain truths
[3:56] that we need to emphasize." And this is
[3:59] one of them. He He made us. Salvation is
[4:04] his doing. Salvation is of the Lord. all
[4:07] of grace. He redeemed us for a purpose.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; He bought us
[4:12] &gt;&gt; for a purpose.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Your life is for a purpose. You're not
[4:17] here by chance. There is a reason that
[4:19] you're sitting in this building tonight
[4:21] under this ministry, under this city.
[4:24] It's for a purpose. He says, "But now we
[4:27] are spiritual kings." Now, I want you to
[4:29] grab a hold of this. You are spiritual
[4:32] kings and we reign over a spiritual
[4:34] kingdom. He says, "Right now, we reign
[4:38] with Christ,
[4:39] &gt;&gt; having dominion,
[4:41] &gt;&gt; over sin."
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; You have dominion over sin. That means
[4:46] you own it.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; You have dominion over sin over the
[4:51] world, over the flesh,
[4:54] &gt;&gt; and over the devil.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; He says, "Showing forth his praise and
[4:57] glory, showing forth himself, for it is
[5:00] Christ in us." Amen.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't say it was just Christ in the
[5:05] preachers. It was just Christ in the
[5:07] ministry or it's Christ in this. It's
[5:09] five in the five. He said it's CHRIST IN
[5:11] US, ALL of us.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; And it's Christ moving in us. And he
[5:16] said he's showing forth himself,
[5:17] willing, doing his good pleasure. Yes,
[5:20] indeed. Even now, we are seted seated in
[5:24] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. So
[5:27] brothers and sisters, we think about
[5:28] this and we see that God in this age
[5:31] that we're living in, this hour that
[5:33] WE'RE LIVING IN, GOD is moving.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; God is moving IN HIS PEOPLE. GOD is
[5:39] delivering his people. God is healing
[5:42] his people. God is restoring his people.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we serve. Now,
[5:48] let's look at let's go into this and
[5:49] let's look at now Job for if we could
[5:51] for just a minute.
[5:53] There was a man in the land of Oz. His
[5:57] name was Job. And that man was perfect
[6:00] and upright and one that feared God and
[6:03] a skewed evil.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Now we look at that word is skewed evil.
[6:07] Now I'm sure you've been taught this.
[6:08] You've got a very very good biblical
[6:11] solid teacher as your pastor.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; So I'm a little intimidated to be
[6:15] preaching up here just to be honest.
[6:18] But he we look at that word is skewed
[6:21] evil and it means to deliberately avoid
[6:24] or abstain from.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; So we see that Job in his mind in his
[6:29] heart he deliberately stayed away from
[6:32] the evil things.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; He deliberately stayed away from things
[6:36] that would hinder him from walking in
[6:38] the life of of God.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Deliberately.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; There were born unto him seven sons,
[6:45] three daughters. His substance was 7,000
[6:47] sheep. 3,000 camels, 500 oak yolk of
[6:50] oxen, 500 sheasses, a very great
[6:53] household. So that this man was the
[6:55] greatest of all men in the east. His
[6:58] sons and went his sons went and feasted.
[7:00] Now I want you to grasp this. His sons
[7:03] went and feasted in their house,
[7:04] everyone his day, and sent and called
[7:07] for their three sisters to eat and drink
[7:10] with them. Now watch what Job does. Job.
[7:13] It says, "And it was so that in the days
[7:15] of their feasting were gone about that
[7:16] Job sent and sanctified them. He rose up
[7:20] early in the morning and offered burnt
[7:22] offerings according to the number of
[7:25] them all. For Job said, "It may be that
[7:27] my sons have sinned and cursed God in
[7:29] their hearts." What was Job doing? Think
[7:33] about this. What was Job doing? Job was
[7:36] taken in the mind of his of his own self
[7:38] and he was thinking of his children
[7:40] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Look, my children has have
[7:42] went. I know that they had a get
[7:44] together. I know they had a little
[7:46] party. I know that they done this. So,
[7:48] I'm going to go give them a burnt
[7:49] offering. I'm going to make a sacrifice
[7:53] so that my kids are covered under the
[7:55] blood."
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Job was being the Holy Ghost to his
[7:59] children until they got the Holy Ghost.
[8:02] Listen, young listen listen people.
[8:05] We've got to be as adults. We've got to
[8:07] be the Holy Ghost to our children
[8:10] &gt;&gt; if they don't have it.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; And Job is DISPLAYING THIS RIGHT HERE.
[8:14] I'M going to make a sacrifice for them.
[8:16] So Job was being the Holy Ghost. Let's
[8:18] go on down. Now, this is where it gets
[8:20] interesting. And this is where we're
[8:21] going to go.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Now, there was a day when the sons of
[8:24] God came to present themselves before
[8:26] the Lord, and Satan came also amongst
[8:30] them.
[8:34] We're here today, sons and daughters of
[8:36] God, assembling to come before the Lord
[8:38] to hear what the Lord's got to say.
[8:39] Where do you think Satan's at today?
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He come in the door, too.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; And it's not on any anybody here, not a
[8:49] flesh. We're not we're not pointing
[8:50] fingers. But we got to realize that
[8:52] there's atmospheres.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; There's anointings. There's atmospheres.
[8:56] There's spirits.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[8:59] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence
[9:01] comest thou?" And Satan answered the
[9:04] Lord and said,"Well, from going to and
[9:07] fro in the earth and walking up and down
[9:10] it." Where you Why are you here, Satan?
[9:14] &gt;&gt; This is a conversation that's going on.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Between God and Satan.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU HERE, SATAN? WELL, let me
[9:24] tell you, God, I've been traveling the
[9:27] earth. I've been going to this church
[9:29] and I've been going to that church and I
[9:31] visited this this person's home
[9:33] &gt;&gt; and I visited that person's home and and
[9:35] I went to that young person's school and
[9:37] I went to over here. You see what I'm
[9:39] saying?
[9:41] &gt;&gt; AND SO NOW GOD AND this conversation is
[9:44] taking place. Now Job has no idea that
[9:47] this conversation is taking place.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; You see, a lot of times God is
[9:52] petitioning for our benefit
[9:55] &gt;&gt; and we have no idea what is taking
[9:58] place.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Satan, "Hast thou
[10:03] considered my servant Job?" Oh, what a
[10:07] glorious statement.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; "Hast thou considered my bride?
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Hath thou considered my church in Ohio?
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Have thou considered Malachi? Have thou
[10:17] considered the different ones sitting
[10:19] here? Have they has have you considered
[10:21] these young people?
[10:24] &gt;&gt; The conversation taking place.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; There is none like him in earth. A
[10:31] perfect and upright man. One that fearth
[10:33] God and escueth evil. I want to title my
[10:36] message today perfect in the master's
[10:39] hand.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Perfect in the master's hand. Let's just
[10:42] bow our heads and pray. Heavenly Father,
[10:44] we come before you this morning with
[10:46] grateful hearts. Thankful Lord for the
[10:48] opportunity to be here and how we've
[10:50] been so blessed over the last day and a
[10:52] half here and now the opportunity to
[10:55] come and just to minister the word.
[10:56] We've had fellowship and we've had
[10:58] beautiful singing and testimony and but
[11:00] now we come to the most important part
[11:02] and that's the preaching of the word
[11:04] where the word goes forth. The word that
[11:05] that changes our lives. The word that
[11:08] delivers us from from habits. The word
[11:10] that heals our bodies. It's based upon
[11:12] this word, the heavenly word. the words
[11:15] of Jesus Christ. Father, we ask that you
[11:18] would come down this morning and you
[11:19] would just move and as we set aside this
[11:22] time just to to worship you and serve
[11:24] you and and hear what you would have in
[11:26] store for us. You know, we're needy
[11:27] people and you know the needs of your
[11:30] people.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; So God, we ask that you would just sweep
[11:34] in our presence as we feel the presence
[11:37] already. that you would just go in and
[11:39] out of the aisles and up and down the
[11:41] aisles of our hearts this morning and
[11:43] open our hearts, Lord Jesus, that as the
[11:46] word goes forth that the the anointing
[11:48] and the and and as the word goes forth,
[11:49] it would be received deep down into our
[11:51] hearts a lifechanging
[11:55] word of God this morning.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord. We thank you, Lord.
[11:59] We give you honor, praise, and glory.
[12:01] And we lift your name on high. In your
[12:03] precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. You
[12:06] can have your seat. Sorry to keep you
[12:08] standing so long.
[12:10] Now, Brother Tommy preached last night
[12:13] or he ministered and ministered through
[12:15] testimony and I don't believe he broke a
[12:17] sweat.
[12:19] Well, that ain't me. I'm going to sweat.
[12:22] I'm going to spit. I'm going and I'm not
[12:24] hollering at you, but it's just the way
[12:25] it comes out.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; So, just just pray for us. Pull. You
[12:29] pull. I'll preach. I'll preach as long
[12:31] as you pull.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[12:33] &gt;&gt; There's no limitations on what God can
[12:35] do.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; We're looking here at Job and we begin
[12:39] to look at the life of Job. And and and
[12:41] many of us, we would begin to look at
[12:42] this and we would say immediately we
[12:44] think about Job and we would say, "Oh,
[12:46] this poor pitiful Job. This poor pitiful
[12:49] man named Job. Look at all he's going
[12:51] through. Look, look at all that that
[12:53] that that he's going to be going
[12:55] through." Because we know the story,
[12:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[12:57] &gt;&gt; And we look at the story and our mind
[12:59] goes to a place of trials. Thank you,
[13:01] brother.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Our mind goes to a place of trials. And
[13:05] it goes to a place of hardship. It goes
[13:08] to heartache and pain and remorse and
[13:10] agony. BUT WHAT WE'VE got to realize is
[13:12] that things aren't always as they seem
[13:15] to be.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Things aren't always as they seem to be.
[13:18] Because those words that I just said,
[13:20] agony and distress and pain and
[13:22] heartache. Those are just descriptive
[13:25] words describing the circumstance that
[13:28] Job was going through.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; It in no way describes the man Job.
[13:35] It doesn't say anything about the
[13:37] character of Job,
[13:39] &gt;&gt; but it is descriptive words that our
[13:41] mind goes to and we think of and we
[13:44] begin to look at those. Now, I want you
[13:46] to listen to what the prophet says about
[13:48] Job. The prophet says Job was a great
[13:50] man.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; He says there was nobody like him in all
[13:54] the days. Job was a prophet. He said
[13:57] people would come from far and near to
[14:00] hear Job.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; He said here they were. they would come
[14:03] and and God blessed him. He prospered.
[14:06] He was rich. He had thousands of cattle
[14:07] and sheep and things that he had. He
[14:10] said people, now I want you to watch the
[14:12] way God looks at Job versus the way we
[14:15] think about Job.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet says this. He says people,
[14:21] he would go out into the streets and
[14:23] young princes from the east, the magi,
[14:25] the wise astronomers, they would bow
[14:28] before him to ask for a word of his
[14:32] wisdom.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Now, that is describing the character
[14:37] &gt;&gt; of Job.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; That's describing the man Job, who Job
[14:42] was as a believer. Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; And brothers and sisters, Satan may use
[14:46] a lot of different words to describe
[14:49] what you're going through. He may use a
[14:51] lot of different words to describe what
[14:54] you are going through in your life. If
[14:55] you lose your job, he may say you're a
[14:58] failure.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Think about this.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; I If things are not going just like you
[15:04] want it to and life's not going well,
[15:07] he'll call you depressed.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; He'll call you stressed. He'll call you
[15:13] anxious.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; He'll say that you're fear.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; You know what fear is? False evidence
[15:19] appearing real.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; It's not descriptive of who you are.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; It's descriptive of a circumstance that
[15:28] you're going through.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; So here we look at this. We look at this
[15:32] and we see that sometimes things are not
[15:34] going well and he may look at you young
[15:36] people and he'll say, "You're lost.
[15:40] You don't have the Holy Ghost.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Has he ever said Has he has he ever
[15:45] spoke to any of us?
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure he has. He speaks. He'll say,
[15:48] "Are you you're lost? Your life is
[15:50] hopeless." These are the things he says.
[15:53] But brothers AND SISTERS, WHEN GOD SPOKE
[15:54] ABOUT JOB, HE DIDN'T use any of these
[15:56] words of negativity. He didn't use any
[15:59] of these words of doubt. But the Lord
[16:01] says there is none like him.
[16:04] So when Satan comes knocking on your
[16:06] door, it's up to us to say THERE IS
[16:08] NOBODY LIKE ME.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MY GOD SAYS.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; There is none like me in the land. And
[16:14] and he says he was a perfect and upright
[16:17] man, one that fearth God and is skewest
[16:19] evil. So brothers and sisters, the devil
[16:22] may call you a lot of things in this
[16:24] life,
[16:26] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD [screaming] SAYS YOU'RE MY SON,
[16:29] &gt;&gt; you're my daughter.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MY SWEETHEART. YOU'RE MY LOVE.
[16:33] YOU'RE MY BRIDE.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY GOD SEES YOU.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; NOT AS DEFEATED, NOT AS DEPRESSED, NOT
[16:40] AS STRESSED, NOT as anxious.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; He sees you as bride.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; So don't ever let the circumstances.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the circumstances
[16:58] describe who you are.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Amen.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; You see, we all have circumstances.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; We all have circumstances.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; That's the reality of this thing we call
[17:11] life.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; But the bride don't quit.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; The bride don't don't give up.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; The bride don't throw IN THE TOWEL.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE GOING gets hard, she gets she
[17:23] rises up to the occasion.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; When the pressure BEGINS TO BUILD UP,
[17:27] SHE SAYS, "I KNOW WHO MY redeemer is. I
[17:30] KNOW WHO MY GOD IS.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; you see, our minds think the way uh
[17:39] don't always think the way that God
[17:41] thinks.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; And us as human beings, we get into a
[17:46] place that we see things in a bubble,
[17:48] might we say. Well, let's say it this
[17:49] way, and I preached it this way before.
[17:51] Just imagine if I were to stretch a
[17:53] string across this wall all the way
[17:55] through the building and it went all the
[17:56] way through the building and right in
[17:58] the center of it we tie a knot in this
[18:00] nylon string.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Now you can't see the beginning of it
[18:06] &gt;&gt; and you can't see the end of it
[18:09] &gt;&gt; but all you see is a knot.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the way our life is. Yeah,
[18:14] that's right.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Our life is just a knot on a big long
[18:17] string that you can't see the beginning
[18:19] from the end because it was in God's
[18:21] mind from the foundation of the world
[18:23] and it runs all the way through
[18:25] eternity. But we see a lifespan
[18:28] &gt;&gt; three score and 10. Ain't that about
[18:30] right? Hallelujah.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking at. And it
[18:33] looks so big and so magnificent, but in
[18:35] God's mind, it's just a dot on a string.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; But yet, we get bombarded. We get to
[18:43] thinking these are look at what we're
[18:45] going through. Look at the stress. Look
[18:46] at the look at the things that Satan's
[18:48] doing. Look at how he's affected our
[18:49] church. Look how he's affected our
[18:51] youth. Look how he's affected my home.
[18:53] Look how he's affected my career.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; And it's all in that knot.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the knot. Look at THE
[18:59] FINISH.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD says it this way. He said,
[19:02] "My thoughts are not your thoughts.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; My thoughts are not your thoughts.
[19:07] Neither are your ways my ways." Yes sir.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we GOT TO GET OURSEL OUT OF
[19:12] THE way in any decision we make in life
[19:14] and say God what is your will?
[19:16] &gt;&gt; What is your way?
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAY. MY
[19:21] WAYS ARE HEAVENLY.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; My ways are higher than your ways.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. THAT'S RIGHT.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; GOD DOESN'T THINK EARTHLY.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; We think earthly.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Job was a perfect and upright man. And
[19:38] we think about the word perfect and we
[19:40] know that that word means it means
[19:42] without thought, without defect. And we
[19:45] think about perfection. I I got to
[19:47] thinking about the a diamond. And you
[19:49] know, brother Brandham, he talked about
[19:51] he was down there in the Kimberly mines
[19:53] of South Africa, one of the greatest
[19:55] diamond mines where they produce all the
[19:56] diamonds and a lot of the major diamonds
[19:58] of the world. And he said the guy told
[20:01] him he looked over there and he seen a
[20:03] he seen a pile of diamonds.
[20:06] And the prophet said he was looking at
[20:07] and there was nothing for it. There was
[20:08] nothing to look at. But there sat this
[20:11] pile of diamonds and he asked why are
[20:13] these worth so much? There is nothing to
[20:15] look at. And the guy goes back and he
[20:18] responds to him. He says what you're
[20:20] looking at is the unfinished product.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; These stones have to be cut.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; They have to be cut to show what's on
[20:30] the inside of them.
[20:34] Hallelujah.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Perfect in the master's hand.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; The word diamond comes from the Greek
[20:45] word Adamus. Now, I want you to look and
[20:47] know what the word Adamus means. When
[20:50] you look at a diamond and you take that
[20:52] Greek word Adamus, it means
[20:53] unconquerable or indestructible.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. GOD LOOKS AT
[21:01] [screaming] HIS BRIDE AND SAYS, "LOOK,
[21:02] THIS IS MY BRIDE. SHE'S JUST LIKE A
[21:04] DIAMOND. SHE'S BUILT HARD. She's built
[21:06] tough. She's built resilient. She's
[21:08] indestructible. She's uncorruptible.
[21:10] She's undestructible.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; That is God's bride.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; How do we get there? We look at this. We
[21:17] think, "HOW IN THE WORLD DO WE EVER GET
[21:19] THERE? How do these diamonds, we look at
[21:22] them in and a diamond we know is so
[21:24] beautiful? It sparkles. It glistens.
[21:26] It's beautiful. It radiates light."
[21:29] Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Now, some of us as Christians sometimes
[21:32] we're not radiating the light we should
[21:34] be radiating.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "I'm a Christian. I
[21:39] go to church about once a month."
[21:44] &gt;&gt; And a lot of light shining.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Hey, I I I told I preached the other
[21:52] night at home. I said, "It's Wednesday
[21:54] night. We we we running about twothirds.
[21:57] Where's the other third? What's so
[21:58] important?
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; This ain't in my notes, brother Jesse.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; That's good, sir.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; But where's the other third?
[22:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; What's so important?
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; We need to be in the house of God. WHY?
[22:11] BECAUSE THE HOUSE OF GOD is the house of
[22:12] correction. THE HOUSE OF GOD is where we
[22:15] get cut. It's where we get molded. It's
[22:17] where God shapes us and shows us who we
[22:19] are.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; He begins to bring out the brilliance.
[22:22] How? Through the word of God.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Through the preaching of the word.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:31] Diamonds. You see, they are some of the
[22:33] most
[22:35] remarkable creations that God has.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; But these diamonds, they don't come
[22:41] easy.
[22:43] When a diamond for it to be built, for
[22:45] it to be formed, it has to go under
[22:47] intense amounts of pressure.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Heavy, heavy, heavy pressure. 90 to 100
[22:54] miles down deep into the earth. and it
[22:56] goes under the pressure of about 725,000
[23:02] pounds per square inch.
[23:05] To give you an illustration of what that
[23:06] would be like, they said the
[23:08] illustration would be like taking the
[23:09] Eiffel Tower, turning it up on its top,
[23:12] and balancing it on a sugar cube.
[23:19] We're built for pressure.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; We're built for challenges. Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Here we are. This this diamond here is
[23:27] under the ground and and in the earth's
[23:29] mantle and all this pressure and this
[23:32] heat 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
[23:36] We don't like it as humans. We don't
[23:38] like it when the heat gets turned up.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; We don't like it when the challenges
[23:42] come.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; We don't like it when the devil knocks.
[23:45] We don't like it when we don't have food
[23:47] to eat or the cupboards bare or or we
[23:49] don't know how to make the next payment
[23:50] or or the the kids get sick or the you
[23:53] know what I'm saying.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; But that is heat that's being put on the
[23:57] diamond
[23:58] &gt;&gt; and it is making something special out
[24:00] of you. Why? Because you don't retreat.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Every day your feet HIT THE FLOOR.
[24:05] YOU'RE IN A WAR. YOU'RE IN A BATTLE.
[24:07] YES, SIR.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; And deep down inside the earth,
[24:15] these diamonds are sitting down there
[24:17] where it's dark and it's hot
[24:21] and the pressure's on.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; But it's right there where the magic
[24:25] begins to happen.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; It's right there where the magic begins
[24:29] to happen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Circumstances.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Circumstances.
[24:36] LIFE.
[24:37] LIFE IS WHAT transforms the ordinary
[24:40] carbon into an extraordinary
[24:43] piece of work.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; It's the life challenges that create
[24:48] that perfect diamond.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; The earth begins to quake.
[24:56] Challenges begin to come. You ever had
[24:58] your life shaken, brother? Sure. WE HAVE
[25:01] YOUR LIFE. SOMETIMES YOU GO THROUGH LIFE
[25:03] AND life begins to shake you and it
[25:04] quakes you.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; But what it's doing is it's building.
[25:08] It's it's beginning to bring something
[25:10] up to the top of the surface.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; That diamond lays there under that
[25:14] pressure, under that heat, and the
[25:16] volcanic begins to erupt and it begins
[25:18] to push up what's down deep down inside
[25:23] &gt;&gt; and it brings it to the surface. And if
[25:26] we were to reach and grab it, we would
[25:27] say, "Look at this old rock." You see,
[25:30] the work's not done.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; The work's not done. There takes more
[25:36] than that. A and I got to watching and
[25:38] and I kind of get get hung up and I told
[25:40] the church at home, I said, you know, I
[25:41] get to watching this guy on YouTube.
[25:44] Forgive me,
[25:46] but he's a diamond specialist
[25:49] &gt;&gt; in New York. And they bring him these
[25:52] diamonds and he he begins to grade them
[25:54] and he'll scale them out and he looks at
[25:55] them and he examines them and he he
[25:57] takes and he looks at them and they'll
[25:59] bring him I'm talking 250 $300,000
[26:02] diamonds. One diamond. not not a bunch,
[26:05] one. And they bring it to him and he
[26:08] begins to look at it and and he says,
[26:09] "You know what? There's four things that
[26:11] determine the quality of this diamond.
[26:13] One is cut, one is color, one is
[26:15] clarity, and one is carrot weight." And
[26:18] he gets his little scope and he begins
[26:20] to look at that diamond and and he says,
[26:21] "You know what? I liked the cut of this
[26:24] diamond." He said, "It's it's cut just
[26:26] like I like it."
[26:28] You see how they cut diamonds is they
[26:30] take a wheel and it's it's cut it's
[26:33] covered with little pieces of diamond
[26:35] because a diamond is the strongest
[26:37] material on the face of the earth. So a
[26:39] diamond has to cut a diamond.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; So God has to cut.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? But that that
[26:50] master cutter, he'll take that stone and
[26:52] he glues it onto a onto a rod and it
[26:54] goes into this machine and he'll take
[26:56] and he'll take and he'll set it down on
[26:57] that grinding wheel and he'll hold it
[26:59] down there and he picks it up and he
[27:00] looks at it. I like that. But the work's
[27:04] not done.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; He takes and he takes that machine and
[27:07] it's got little dial on it. He'll move
[27:08] it one degree and he'll set that stone
[27:10] back down and he begins to hone on it
[27:12] again. And this goes on and on and on
[27:14] and he'll change this degree and that
[27:16] degree. What's he doing? He's cutting
[27:18] out all the imperfections. He's cutting
[27:21] out all the impurities. He's cutting out
[27:23] everything that would keep that diamond
[27:26] from being exactly what he wants it to
[27:28] be.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; So when God comes cutting in our life,
[27:32] &gt;&gt; and God begins to grind us on the wheel,
[27:35] &gt;&gt; what's he doing? He's saying, "I'm
[27:37] getting rid of this. I'm getting rid of
[27:39] tobacco. I'm getting rid of pornography.
[27:41] I'm getting rid of lust. I'm getting rid
[27:43] of doubt. I'm getting rid of fear."
[27:46] WHY DO WE LET FEAR CONTROL OUR LIVES
[27:48] WHEN THE Bible says fear not?
[27:51] &gt;&gt; So God, WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE those
[27:53] fears, those anxieties, those doubts and
[27:55] depressions
[27:57] &gt;&gt; and go to GOD AND SAY, "GOD, CUT me and
[27:59] hone me into the image of you.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost hone down the Holy
[28:07] Ghost bride."
[28:10] And
[28:11] &gt;&gt; that inspector, he looks at that stone
[28:13] and he begins to look at it and he says,
[28:14] "You know what? I like the cut. It's cut
[28:16] perfect,
[28:17] &gt;&gt; but now we got to look at the color."
[28:20] And he takes a stone and he puts it in
[28:22] this in this piece of paper. It's folded
[28:24] up like this. And he sticks that stone
[28:27] in that crease. And it's a solid white
[28:29] sheet of paper. Do we have any diamond
[28:31] inspectors here? Works for GIA. I I'll
[28:33] make sure I'm on the right track here.
[28:34] No. Okay.
[28:36] So he puts that diamond in that paper
[28:38] and he looks at it. He says, "Ah. Ah,
[28:41] that's clear.
[28:43] That's a good diamond.
[28:46] That's clear.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; The master cutter knew what he was
[28:50] doing.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; He knew how to cut that stone SO PERFECT
[28:53] THAT NOW WHEN the light hits it,
[28:58] &gt;&gt; it's reflecting exactly back where it
[29:00] came from.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; There is NO SMUD IN THAT DIAMOND.
[29:04] There's no fog in it. It's clear. It's
[29:07] crystal clear.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; That's the way God is working on us in
[29:11] our lives.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; He's clarifying us.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; The cut, the the the color, the clarity.
[29:18] He's clarifying us to be what he wants
[29:20] us to be.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the one that I really like,
[29:24] and it's carrot. You see, carrot is is
[29:28] important.
[29:30] Women, you like that big diamond, don't
[29:31] you? Look at you smiling.
[29:35] All of you is thinking, "Man, one of
[29:36] these days Mr. Wright comes along. I'm
[29:38] gonna get me one of them big old
[29:39] diamonds. You too young ladies. Y'all
[29:42] y'all be patient."
[29:46] &gt;&gt; But he say, "I I look at this diamond. I
[29:48] want this big giant diamond."
[29:51] Well, that ain't always what you're
[29:53] looking for
[29:56] &gt;&gt; because you can take a the the good
[29:57] thing about the way God's economy works
[30:00] is you don't have to be some big
[30:01] somebody.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just who I am.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Like I told you last night, I'm country
[30:08] as cornbread.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; I have a farm. I work. I fish. I hunt. I
[30:12] I got a job. I'm just an everyday normal
[30:15] guy. Just like Tommy, just like Troy.
[30:16] We're just everyday normal people just
[30:18] like you. Yes, sir.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; I'm nobody big.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; But it's not how big you are.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; It's how well you've been cut.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; It's okay. Give him praise.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; It's the challenges you've been through
[30:39] in your life that makes you who you are.
[30:41] You see, a half karat diamond that is
[30:43] cut appropriately
[30:46] &gt;&gt; is worth way more than some big somebody
[30:49] over here that hadn't been through
[30:51] nothing.
[30:53] [applause]
[30:54] &gt;&gt; That little diamond sparkles and shines
[30:57] so much brighter
[30:59] &gt;&gt; because why? It's been through things.
[31:01] It's been through hardships. God has
[31:03] been molding. God has been making. God
[31:05] has been building. And God has been
[31:06] perfecting you into the image he sees
[31:10] from you.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, this immense
[31:15] amount of pressure that Job endured,
[31:19] what was it doing? It wasn't God wanting
[31:22] to break him down. It wasn't God trying
[31:26] to humiliate Job. It wasn't God trying
[31:29] to make Job think, "Oh, your life is the
[31:31] pits." That wasn't what he was doing.
[31:33] But he looked at Job and he said, "This
[31:34] immense amount of pressure I'm putting
[31:36] you under is going to make you love me.
[31:38] It's going to bring you closer to me
[31:40] than you've ever been before."
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Just like that raw diamond, Job had
[31:48] value from the beginning. Like that pile
[31:50] of diamonds, they were valuable.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Job had value, but his trials were
[31:56] necessity
[31:57] &gt;&gt; to bring out the brilliance.
[32:01] Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Crushing experiences.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; I've been through crushing experiences
[32:07] in my life.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy has been through crushing
[32:11] experiences in his life. Brother Troy,
[32:14] &gt;&gt; you
[32:16] know, we could spend days sitting here
[32:18] telling our story. We've all got one.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Betrayed.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Lied about.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Made fun of.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; For the stand you take for the standing
[32:32] on the word.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; These look like to our flesh crushing.
[32:38] Family can hurt you.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Friends can hurt you.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; But it begins to get build this
[32:46] transformation on the inside. This
[32:48] transformation that happens on the
[32:50] inside.
[32:52] And when God puts us through those
[32:54] things,
[32:55] &gt;&gt; it's not to punish you,
[32:57] &gt;&gt; but it's because he trusts you.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Think about this. When Job was sitting
[33:04] there and the Lord said to Satan, "Hast
[33:06] thou considered my servant Job?"
[33:09] &gt;&gt; And he says that to him, Brother
[33:10] Brandham said, "God had confidence in
[33:12] Job?"
[33:14] &gt;&gt; He said he had confidence. WHY? BECAUSE
[33:16] HE HAD FELLOWSHIP with him.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; So when you're in your trials, go to
[33:20] God. Amen.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; When troubles come, stay before God.
[33:24] Fellowship in the light of God. He said
[33:27] God knew Job trusted him and so he
[33:30] trusted God. He said Satan, he told
[33:32] Satan, now listen this conversation, Job
[33:34] still has no recollection of this
[33:36] conversation.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; You think you think Satan don't talk to
[33:39] God about you?
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure he does. Sure he does. And so
[33:47] now here's this conversation going on
[33:49] and and and and God says, "All right,
[33:51] Satan, you go on. He's at your hands,
[33:55] but don't take his life. You can do
[33:58] anything else to him."
[34:02] And the prophet says that that that he
[34:04] says, "And Satan is good as his office
[34:08] and away he goes."
[34:11] &gt;&gt; So let the torment begin.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We're not going to spend too
[34:15] much more time on Job, but I want you to
[34:17] realize a lot of times we don't look at
[34:19] Job through the through the exact thing
[34:20] we hear about Job and and his boils,
[34:22] right? That's the big thing. Well, let
[34:24] me tell you a little bit about that
[34:25] those BS. You see, I I'm a nurse by
[34:28] trade, so I look into things probably
[34:30] different than some of you do. So, I
[34:31] thought, what is this? WHAT IS THIS
[34:33] BOILS? What is this disease that Job
[34:34] had?
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Remember now, Job is sitting on an ash
[34:38] heap.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know what an ash heap is? An ash
[34:43] heap is where they take all the garbage
[34:44] in the town in the community and they
[34:46] put it in there and burn it. That's
[34:48] trash. It's it's broken pieces of
[34:50] material. It it's it's dung from the
[34:53] septic
[34:55] and they take it there and burn it. And
[34:57] now Job is sitting there on this ash
[34:59] heap covered in bulls.
[35:02] It's actually a syndrome that the
[35:03] medical field has named Job's syndrome.
[35:09] And we hear about the bulls.
[35:11] You often wonder why did he take a piece
[35:13] of broken vessel and was scraping?
[35:14] Because he was in a garbage pile. He
[35:16] found a piece of broken glass and he's
[35:19] itching so bad. This Job syndrome causes
[35:21] you to have bulls on the outside from
[35:23] head to toe and you itch so bad that you
[35:26] just want to claw. So he picks up a
[35:28] piece of garbage, a piece of broken
[35:30] vessel and he is scraping his bowls
[35:33] and we think we got life hard.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; And he's scraping his bowls. And these
[35:38] bowls don't just stop on the outside.
[35:40] They go down onto the inside and he
[35:42] begins to get bulls on his lungs.
[35:47] It becomes even worse as the pestule
[35:50] begin to come out of the gums of the
[35:51] teeth.
[35:54] Staff infection, MRSA,
[35:58] these are major major bacterias. So here
[36:01] Job is up here on this ash heap and he's
[36:03] going through all of this. So all of
[36:05] this looks like that he is in a place
[36:08] that there is no recovery. Sometimes we
[36:11] feel that way.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; God, I don't know if I'll ever GET
[36:13] THROUGH THIS. GOD, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
[36:14] EVER COME out on the other side of this.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; But here, Job sits there and brothers
[36:19] and sisters, Job, God knew that Job had
[36:21] the fight in him that he was going to
[36:23] overcome the temptation to throw in the
[36:25] towel.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; How many times have we said, "I just
[36:28] want to quit."
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Jesse, 20 years, pastor, and
[36:32] there's times, I'm sure you've said, "I
[36:33] just want to quit."
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Why do we do this?
[36:43] Yes sir.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; But God
[36:45] &gt;&gt; has the confidence.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; God has the confidence in the man of the
[36:50] hour and the man of the scene. There was
[36:52] no quit IN HIM. NO MATTER WHAT THE
[36:54] CIRCUMSTANCES, no matter the hardship,
[36:56] no matter Job believed that God could
[36:59] fix it.
[37:02] [sighs]
[37:03] &gt;&gt; I hope this is hitting home.
[37:06] When sickness came, Job knew that God
[37:08] could make him well.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; When this fortune was taken, everything
[37:14] that he owned, HIS CHILDREN GONE.
[37:17] EVERYTHING he owned taken, Job trusted
[37:19] God could restore.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And when death came to take his
[37:23] children, Job trusted God.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; And that's hard.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; That's hard.
[37:33] We need such a trust in God that
[37:35] circumstances don't matter.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; And we're here. I I hope this this will
[37:40] build your faith. I'm going to give you
[37:41] some testimonies.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Because our God is a miracle working God
[37:45] who's doing miraculous things. Not in
[37:48] just our church, not in just that church
[37:51] over there or this church or this
[37:52] church, but worldwide. God is doing
[37:55] things. And it's the hour that we're
[37:57] living in. We're living in an hour where
[37:59] we see Mark 16:17 coming into action.
[38:02] Signs and wonders.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Now, somebody told me, they said, "Let
[38:06] you you preaching signs and wonders
[38:08] awful hard. Is everybody going to look
[38:10] to signs and wonders?"
[38:11] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brown said, "You have
[38:12] to be careful preaching signs and
[38:14] wonders."
[38:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because people will look for
[38:17] an an emotion or or something like
[38:19] that." We're not looking for a dance.
[38:21] We're not looking for a shout. We're not
[38:22] looking for that. But what we're looking
[38:24] for is for God to move in his people and
[38:27] to follow the believers like the word
[38:29] says.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders shall follow who?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; The believers.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; How many believers do we have?
[38:38] &gt;&gt; I told somebody the other day, I said,
[38:40] "Listen, we're going to pray for this
[38:41] situation and we're going to believe God
[38:43] is going to move in in the way that
[38:46] we're that we're asking."
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Now, we want his perfect will in
[38:49] everything,
[38:50] &gt;&gt; but we're going to believe.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Why? because I'm a believer.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Why would I doubt?
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD I DOUBT WHAT GOD SAYS CAN BE?
[39:01] &gt;&gt; It's up to him.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about Cody.
[39:07] How long have I been up here? I I
[39:08] usually look at the clock.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about Cody. So, Cody
[39:14] Cody is my nephew.
[39:17] Cody as a as a young child.
[39:20] Cody as a young child was one of the
[39:22] most tender, sweetest young young men
[39:24] you had ever as a young child growing
[39:26] up.
[39:28] Satan come into his mother and father's
[39:30] marriage. My sister-in-law and this is
[39:33] okay. I I promise I'm not I've talked to
[39:35] him. I can share this because it helps
[39:37] people.
[39:40] Satan come into there and separated the
[39:42] home.
[39:45] Cody couldn't handle it. Cody at the
[39:47] time didn't have the Holy Ghost. He'd
[39:49] been in church his whole life, been
[39:51] raised in the message, been raised to
[39:53] know right and wrong, to been underneath
[39:55] good leadership, good teaching, good
[39:57] good uh good uh spiritual leadership,
[40:00] but it was more than he could handle
[40:02] when that pressure came on. A young man,
[40:05] so he turns
[40:07] to drugs.
[40:10] He turns to hatred.
[40:14] Hatred.
[40:16] Hatred is a is a evil evil enemy.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And he became so he he became addicted
[40:23] to these drugs that he just couldn't get
[40:25] enough. And and his life was just going
[40:27] downhill downhill downhill in shambles.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; And I would pray and I and the Lord just
[40:35] would I just couldn't go say nothing to
[40:37] him. He he he knew where I stood and I
[40:40] it just the Lord wouldn't lead me to go
[40:42] to him yet. His mom calls and says,
[40:46] "Cody's really going through it." And I
[40:48] said, "Okay, I'm gonna pray." So, he
[40:50] don't like to talk to nobody about it.
[40:51] You know how that you know how that
[40:53] spirit is
[40:54] &gt;&gt; when that spirit gets on somebody. Don't
[40:55] talk to me. You don't know.
[40:59] So, one day I Lord laid it on my heart.
[41:01] I said, "Sarah," I said, "I'm going to
[41:03] go talk to Cody." She said, "He won't
[41:05] talk to you." I said, "I'm going
[41:07] anyway." I said, "Now's the right time."
[41:10] So I go and he's at his house alone and
[41:12] I I knock on the door and he Uncle Brad
[41:14] come on in real nice. I said and we
[41:16] talked a little bit and I said, "Cody,
[41:18] you know this this road you're going
[41:19] down, it it's not a good road. I know."
[41:23] I said, "Well, I just want you to know I
[41:24] love you.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; No matter what you're going through, I'm
[41:30] here for you. I love you."
[41:33] &gt;&gt; We talked for a few minutes. I I didn't
[41:35] say nothing to nor about church,
[41:37] nothing. We just small talked. I left.
[41:40] Few weeks later, he calls and he he's
[41:44] decided, I need Christ. I need God back
[41:47] in my life.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Now he's facing the biggest challenge
[41:54] because he has an addiction.
[41:56] So now he's facing a challenge that he
[41:59] he's never had to face before and that's
[42:00] coming off of that addiction.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; So he his mom calls. It's before a
[42:05] service on a Sunday. She calls and and
[42:08] says, "I need to bring Cody there. When
[42:10] you can you you and brother Ber pray for
[42:12] him before service." I said, "Yeah, come
[42:14] on. Bring him here." Well, he he don't
[42:16] want to come and he's in his pajamas,
[42:18] but he said he'll come. I said, "I don't
[42:19] care what he's wearing. Bring him."
[42:23] &gt;&gt; She brings him into the back door into
[42:24] the side door of the study. And me and
[42:26] Brother Ber are talking and and Brother
[42:27] Cadre Diggs was there that morning.
[42:29] Y'all know Brother Cadre.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; So, he was there that morning and I
[42:34] said, "Cody, what's going on?" on. He
[42:35] said, "I'm tired of living this way. I
[42:37] can't do this no more.
[42:40] I cannot do this anymore."
[42:42] And I said, "You believe God?" He said,
[42:44] "I don't believe in your God."
[42:48] And the next words broke my heart and
[42:51] his mother's heart. He said, "I hate
[42:54] your God."
[42:59] I said, "You don't mean that. You don't
[43:02] mean that. You know better, Cody.
[43:06] He said, "What's he ever done for me?
[43:10] He my my home's ruined. My my my dad's
[43:12] over here. My my home What has God ever
[43:14] done for me?"
[43:18] I said, "Cody,
[43:20] you don't mean that. God's been good to
[43:21] you."
[43:23] And I said, "Those circumstances,
[43:26] there's nothing in your control. That
[43:28] has nothing to do with you. There was
[43:30] decisions made, choices made that led
[43:33] down that road.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; WHY DID HE LET MY DAD go that way,
[43:40] the decisions he made, it wasn't God
[43:43] done it,
[43:45] &gt;&gt; it was the decisions he made.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; I said, "Listen here, Cody. You got two
[43:50] choices."
[43:52] And and forgive me for being just blunt
[43:55] if that's okay, if I can just put it
[43:57] that way, but this, you know, sometimes
[43:59] people just need to hear where the
[44:00] rubber meets the road.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; And I said, you got two choices today.
[44:04] You got choices to make.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; I said, Cody, you can go back and you
[44:08] can find God and you can go right back
[44:09] to where where that sweetness was, where
[44:12] that tenderness was, where that Holy
[44:14] Ghost was at, and you can find yourself
[44:16] back in church and turn your life around
[44:18] or you can just be the butthole. Forgive
[44:20] me. That's what I told him. That's
[44:23] that's as honest as I knew how to be
[44:27] because he was so mean, so angry.
[44:31] I mean, you could not stand to be
[44:33] around. Nobody wanted wanted him at the
[44:35] We didn't want him at Thanksgiving.
[44:36] Didn't want him at We didn't want him
[44:38] nowhere around because he was miserable
[44:40] and he wanted everybody around him to be
[44:41] miserable.
[44:44] We prayed
[44:47] and I'd like to say that instantly
[44:51] it changed. But it didn't. It didn't.
[44:52] Brother Jesse, we prayed and he said,
[44:55] "Take me home. Mama, take me home. I'm
[44:59] leaving." I said, "No, Cody, you said if
[45:02] that you said if if if Kaye, that was
[45:03] his sister, she was in town. You said if
[45:05] Kaylee would come and bring you here,
[45:07] you would come here and you'd stay for
[45:08] the service. You're not going home.
[45:11] Take me home, mom." mom. I said,
[45:13] "Listen, your mama's not taking you
[45:15] home."
[45:18] I said, "You're going to be a man of
[45:20] your word. You're going to listen to the
[45:22] service. You're going to stay here.
[45:22] You're going to listen to the service.
[45:24] I'm not going out there." I said, "You
[45:25] don't have to go out there. Stay right
[45:26] here. I'll stay right here with you." He
[45:29] stayed there. God began to move. God
[45:32] began to work. God began to to do
[45:34] something in his mind that began to
[45:36] change the way he was thinking.
[45:38] He began to realize this is not the life
[45:41] that I want to keep living. This is a
[45:43] life of destruction. This is a life of
[45:44] death.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; He checked himself into rehab. Now, we
[45:51] know that rehab is is just rehab. It
[45:54] takes God to do the work.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with those programs. He
[45:58] needed to get away. He needed rehab.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; So, he over time,
[46:05] couple weeks go by and I'm getting
[46:08] reports from from his mom and he's
[46:10] having a hard time and he's withdrawing
[46:12] and he's got the shakes and it it was so
[46:15] bad and and it was so bad that that
[46:17] people were almost willing to give him
[46:19] the drugs he needed because he was in
[46:21] such a detox before he went. It was bad
[46:25] fentinel.
[46:28] And so here he is now and he's he's in
[46:31] this detox state and things are not
[46:32] going. But all of a sudden once he got
[46:34] rid of the the spirit that was the
[46:36] addictive spirit.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Now he's beginning to realize, hey, God
[46:41] can do something for me.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; God can make a difference in my life.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; And he he he he I caught him. I you had
[46:49] to wait two weeks before he could talk
[46:50] to anybody. You know how it is. They
[46:52] lock you up like a prison and you ain't
[46:53] talking to nobody because you got to be
[46:55] under their their control. So, two weeks
[46:58] go by and I call him. I said, ' Cody,
[46:59] how's it doing? He said, 'Uncle Brad, he
[47:02] said, 'I just want to say thank you.'
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And I said, 'What do you mean? What?
[47:06] Thank Thank me for what? What did I do?
[47:09] I said, "What? What? What? What? What
[47:11] did I do?" He said, "Thank you for
[47:13] talking to me the way you did." He said,
[47:15] "If you had not talked to me and if you
[47:18] had not told me what I needed to hear
[47:20] and that God loved me and you love me,"
[47:22] he said, "I couldn't have done this."
[47:25] About six months ago, he celebrated one
[47:28] year of complete sobriety,
[47:30] serving the Lord,
[47:32] &gt;&gt; going to church,
[47:34] &gt;&gt; serving the Lord.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Now, he's asked to God to give him a a
[47:39] Holy Ghost filled uh uh uh girlfriend,
[47:43] might we say. So, he's talking to
[47:45] somebody now in the church.
[47:49] And it it gets better than that. Let me
[47:51] share this with you. We'll go on to
[47:53] something else. They told Cody that he
[47:55] he got to going to church and he got to
[47:57] going. Well, he started going on not
[47:58] only Sundays, not Sunday afternoon, but
[48:00] he started going on Wednesdays.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Well, he's locked into this house. They
[48:04] won't let him, you know, you got to be
[48:05] here. You got to be there. You got to go
[48:06] to your job. Come here. You got to
[48:08] report. They come to him one day after
[48:10] he'd been going to church for about two
[48:12] or three months. Every Wednesday, every
[48:13] Sunday, every Wednesday, every Sunday,
[48:15] and they said, "We've got a new rule."
[48:17] Now, listen to how Satan is. We got a
[48:19] new rule.
[48:21] Everybody living here has to be here for
[48:24] our service on Wednesday. We've got a
[48:26] Catholic priest going to come in and
[48:28] preach to y'all on Wednesdays.
[48:32] He said, "Uh, I go to church." They
[48:35] said, "It don't matter. The rules are
[48:36] rules. You have to follow the rules. If
[48:37] you're going to live here, you got to
[48:38] follow the rules." He said, "You'll have
[48:40] to kick me out because I've got a
[48:42] church." And we don't believe the
[48:44] doctrines of the Catholic Church. We
[48:46] believe the God of a Holy Ghost fil God.
[48:49] I go to church. I'm coming in. I'm
[48:51] reporting. So, either you kick me out or
[48:53] I go to church. He's still going to
[48:55] church. They said, they told him, they
[48:58] said, we have seen such a change in you.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; You have our permission. You
[49:07] one out of however many people was
[49:09] there. You got my permission to break
[49:11] the rules.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; God is a miracle working God.
[49:19] my brother-in-law come up and we got our
[49:22] church has a lot of a lot of family. A
[49:23] lot of Tommy's family, a lot of Troy's
[49:25] family, a lot of my family. We're just a
[49:26] big family church, okay? But different
[49:28] families, just a bunch of us.
[49:32] My brother-in-law comes up and he can't
[49:34] hardly walk. He's coming down the aisle
[49:37] and he's almost in tears. Now, my
[49:39] brother-in-law is what, six, 63, 6'4,
[49:41] 200, John 6'4 or 6'2, 63, 200, whatever
[49:45] pounds. Big guy.
[49:47] sawmill logger. Big guy, strong. I I I
[49:51] seen him and his brother pick up a motor
[49:53] one day out of a Detroit engine and take
[49:57] off and walk with it. Big guy. And he's
[50:00] coming down the aisle and he's almost in
[50:03] tears, just barely moving,
[50:06] barely walking.
[50:08] And he don't he don't come up a whole
[50:09] lot. I said, "What's the matter? What's
[50:11] the matter, John?" He said, "My back."
[50:14] He said, "I can't hardly walk. I can't
[50:16] understand this. He said, "They they're
[50:18] saying I need surgery. They're saying
[50:19] all this." I said, "You believe God can
[50:21] heal you?" He said, "I do. I that's why
[50:24] I'm here." I said, "We're going to pray
[50:25] that God just heal you."
[50:27] &gt;&gt; So, we began to pray. We anointed him
[50:28] with oil. We prayed. And after the end
[50:30] of the service, I went back into the
[50:31] study and something just said, "Sign
[50:34] that handkerchief and put a date on it
[50:36] and say, "Healed from sciatica."
[50:40] So I found a magic marker and I took
[50:42] that handkerchief that I had I preached
[50:43] with and I wrote on there John Ler
[50:46] healed of sciatica and the date and I
[50:49] took it to him. I said you put this in
[50:50] your pocket and you just keep claiming
[50:53] that healing.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; You keep believing it. You keep
[50:56] believing it.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Time goes on. Time goes on. Time goes
[51:00] on. And I finally one day I thought I
[51:01] said, "How's your back?" He said, "I'm
[51:03] fine."
[51:05] &gt;&gt; About a year passed, he pulled out of
[51:07] his pocket. And he said, "You remember
[51:08] this?" I said, "I do. I remember it very
[51:11] well." He said, "Never been a problem
[51:14] since
[51:16] &gt;&gt; that's God. That's not man. I can't do
[51:20] that. Brother Jesse can't do that.
[51:22] That's God moving on the scene."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Sister come down to the down to the
[51:27] prayer line one day. She says,
[51:30] "I'm having tremendous pain in my back."
[51:34] And she said, 'Ive been to the doctor
[51:35] and they said that that that there is a
[51:38] nerve that that's being pinched in my
[51:40] back. I said, 'I got an answer for you,
[51:42] sister. That morning, when I was out
[51:45] doing my my morning exercise, I had my
[51:47] headphones on and I was listening and
[51:49] Brother Brandham was talking and he was
[51:50] preaching and a sister had come up down
[51:52] to the prayer line and she said, "I he
[51:55] looked at her. He said, "You're blind,
[51:56] aren't you, sis?" And she said, "Yes, I
[51:59] am." And he says, "What it is is a
[52:02] Satan, a spirit has got in there and has
[52:04] grabbed a hold of the nerves behind your
[52:06] eyes."
[52:09] He said, "We'll pray that it will be
[52:11] released." So I told her, I said, "You
[52:14] know what? It's not that you got a
[52:16] pinched nerve by your bones. Satan has
[52:18] come in and grabbed a hold of your
[52:21] nerves."
[52:22] I said, "But God said
[52:24] &gt;&gt; through a messenger
[52:26] &gt;&gt; that that we could pray and that Satan
[52:28] would have to release his grip on your
[52:30] body."
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, in that message, he he
[52:33] prayed for that woman. He said, "Now you
[52:35] can see me, can't you?" He said, "Look
[52:36] at my finger. How many am I holding up?"
[52:38] She said, "One, brother."
[52:42] &gt;&gt; I pray we prayed for her and I said,
[52:43] "Satan, release your grip off of our
[52:45] sister. There is no peach nerve in her
[52:47] back, but Satan has got a hold of her.
[52:49] release the release this grip you've got
[52:52] on her and let her be well.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; And of course, me being medical, that's
[52:59] not always a good thing. I'm a nurse by
[53:02] trade. Being medical, I called her a
[53:05] couple days later. I said, I said, "Hey,
[53:06] how's your back doing?" I said, "Are you
[53:08] getting any better? You feeling any
[53:09] better?" "Uh uh yeah. You feeling any
[53:11] better? Is it getting better?" She said,
[53:12] "Why would you ask such as that?" She
[53:14] said, "I'm healed. I've had no more
[53:16] problems.
[53:18] I'm still trying to see the symptoms.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy comes up for prayer. He
[53:23] you heard a little bit about it last
[53:24] night, but you got to realize he didn't
[53:26] tell all the story. He told a little bit
[53:28] about his condition that he had. This
[53:31] aorta that he has
[53:33] or had, we'll say,
[53:35] &gt;&gt; let's put it in the right tense.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; This aortic dissection. I'm a nurse. I
[53:41] know how tremendous this is. My
[53:44] grandfather died in 30 seconds of an
[53:47] aortic dissection.
[53:49] Most people never make it to the
[53:51] ambulance. Most people never make it out
[53:52] of the driveway. When this thing tears,
[53:56] blood rushes out of the bottom of the
[53:58] aorta, the biggest val the biggest
[54:00] vessel in the heart. So, you've got
[54:02] seconds to live.
[54:06] He comes up to me and he says, "I
[54:10] believe I'm healed." I said, "Praise the
[54:12] Lord, Tommy." tell what I said, "Praise
[54:14] the Lord, Tommy." He said, "But they
[54:17] want me on medicine." He said, "I'm not
[54:18] taking any more medicine. I want you to
[54:19] pray that I don't need medicine." And
[54:21] I'm thinking, "Oh my Lord,
[54:23] [sighs] oh God, how could you ask me
[54:26] such as that?"
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know I know how important it is
[54:31] that his blood pressure stays perfect.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I know how important it is that blood
[54:36] flow stays perfect in his body.
[54:42] He's got a wife. He's got a child. He
[54:44] needs to be there for him.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; We can't just be going out here and just
[54:49] willy-nilly throwing things around and
[54:50] praying and believing. So, we can't. And
[54:52] I'm thinking, hold up. You're looking at
[54:55] it through the eyes of medicine.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And as he's standing there, they come to
[55:00] my thought, it come to my mind. If he
[55:02] believes it, who are you to doubt it?
[55:08] I said, "Let's pray." How many medicines
[55:11] you on now?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; How many?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; That's his faith. That's his belief.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; God is good. We got a young couple in
[55:25] the church. Can I give a couple more,
[55:26] Brother Jesse? Yes, sir.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; We got a young couple in the church.
[55:30] She'd been wanting they've been wanting
[55:31] to have children for some time.
[55:34] Maybe a year maybe. I think maybe a
[55:36] year. Brother Troy
[55:39] couldn't couldn't couldn't conceive.
[55:41] Couldn't conceive. Couldn't conceive. We
[55:43] had meetings and and we had a prayer
[55:44] line and and and brother Andrew Spencer
[55:47] was there and brother Timothy and
[55:48] several of us ministers were up there
[55:50] and she come through and just tears and
[55:51] you knew exactly you knew immediately
[55:53] what what she wanted, what her desire
[55:54] was.
[55:56] She said, "We want a child. We want a
[55:59] child. So we prayed.
[56:02] The other day she brought the ultrasound
[56:04] to church. Ain't that right?
[56:08] &gt;&gt; God moving in his people. God moving in
[56:13] his people. On the scene in his people.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; One more and then we're going to move
[56:17] on. Our pastor's wife, my sister Donna,
[56:21] many of you may have heard. I don't know
[56:22] if you know her, but she comes and she
[56:24] she come into the study one day and man,
[56:26] Brother Ber's back there and she's just
[56:28] in tears and she says, "My back and hips
[56:30] are just they're just killing me.
[56:32] They're hurting me so bad. I can't I
[56:34] can't stand I can't get no relief." So,
[56:36] we began to pray and we prayed and she
[56:38] got a little bit of relief, but but come
[56:40] to find out, she had had a she had had a
[56:42] wound and and she'd kind of kept that
[56:45] secret. It was it was private. It was it
[56:46] was a wound on her breast. It's okay to
[56:48] say. and she thought maybe it was a
[56:51] maybe a spider bite.
[56:53] And this wound just wouldn't heal. It
[56:55] wouldn't heal. So, they end up they talk
[56:58] her into going to the doctor and and I'm
[57:00] sitting at home and and my phone rings
[57:02] and I say it's my pastor. I answer the
[57:05] phone and there's a pause and then I can
[57:07] hear in his voice the the tears and the
[57:09] trembling. I said, "What's the matter?"
[57:11] He said, "It's not good." And he's just
[57:13] he's just in tears. I said he said,
[57:15] "It's not good." I said, "What what's
[57:17] going on?" He said, "We went to the
[57:19] doctor and they say she's got cancer and
[57:21] it's it's in her hips. It's in her back.
[57:25] It's in her lungs. It's in her lymph
[57:27] nodes.
[57:28] Where else?" It it was they said, and
[57:31] this doctor looks at her and says,
[57:35] "You got three months to live. You're
[57:37] going to die. You're going to die from
[57:39] this cancer."
[57:41] Now, how would you like that to be your
[57:42] doctor?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; How would you like that to be your
[57:47] doctor? you're going to die from this
[57:48] cancer. So, he calls and we get
[57:51] together, me and my wife and and and
[57:53] another sister in a church is a nurse
[57:55] and we're trying to help and lead and
[57:56] guide him. I said, "First of all, we got
[57:58] to get to somebody who believes
[57:59] different than you're going to die."
[58:03] &gt;&gt; So, so they go into see another doctor
[58:06] was a local doctor, just a primary
[58:08] doctor in town. And the doctor looks at
[58:10] him and says, "You're not going to die
[58:11] from this.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; You're not going to die from this. Now,
[58:16] which one you going to listen to?
[58:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to listen to the one that
[58:20] says, "You're not going to die from
[58:21] this."
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; So, we begin to take it to the Lord. We
[58:24] begin to take it to the Lord. And and on
[58:25] a Wednesday night, we had a all night.
[58:28] We well, not all night, but we had an
[58:29] immediate emergent prayer meeting
[58:32] &gt;&gt; and we begin to commit this to God and
[58:34] we begin to to bind our church. Now, let
[58:36] me tell you, we come together and she
[58:38] said, "I will not let this control me."
[58:40] Amen.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; A diagnosis is just an opinion.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[58:49] &gt;&gt; A diagnosis is just an opinion.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; She began to she continued to teach her
[58:56] her grandchildren in homeschool. She
[58:58] kept she kept the house clean. They told
[59:00] her to get hospice ready. They said,
[59:03] "Get your affairs in order. Call it get
[59:05] ready to call in hospice."
[59:07] How long ago was that?
[59:10] year and a half.
[59:12] She just got a report the other day.
[59:15] Things are still going good.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Scans are clearing up.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; The wound is closed up.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; The prayer of faith.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; We need these kinds of stories.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; We need these kinds of things. Let me
[59:32] tell you what that done. It made
[59:33] something happen in our church that we
[59:35] hadn't seen in 30 years.
[59:38] It created a It created a a bond and a
[59:41] unity within our within our church.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; It it caused us to have a different kind
[59:46] of desperation.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; It caused us to believe in a way we've
[59:51] never believed before.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Sister Donna told us, she said, "I I
[59:55] know. I don't know why I had to go
[59:56] through this, but what I do know is it
[59:58] changed Brother Thomas's ministry and it
[1:00:00] changed your ministry
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; and it's grew our church. Yes.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Our church used to be a little bit
[1:00:08] separated, a little bit standoffish from
[1:00:10] one another, but now, no, it's brother
[1:00:12] and brothers and sisters are are are all
[1:00:14] coming into one big unity and and and we
[1:00:16] we're having fellowship and we're
[1:00:18] getting in the word of God and we're
[1:00:20] watching God move on the scene. See,
[1:00:22] it's about what God does through the
[1:00:24] circumstances.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; God is in control.
[1:00:36] Let's go to another masterpiece.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy, be honest with me. How
[1:00:40] long have I been up here?
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Is this okay, brother?
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Let's get back now. Let's look at
[1:00:49] another masterpiece. The prophet tells
[1:00:50] us, he says, God has been again making
[1:00:53] him a masterpiece.
[1:00:55] He said, "Because he struck Adam to get
[1:00:57] a piece off of him, a part of him, a rib
[1:01:00] to make him a wife.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; He struck him." Now, remember, we're
[1:01:05] talking about Job. We've been talking
[1:01:06] about diamonds. We've been talking about
[1:01:08] cutting. But he says, "Now, here was
[1:01:10] Adam in the garden, and God struck him
[1:01:12] and pulled a rib out of him." Why? WHAT
[1:01:14] DID HE WHAT WAS HE DOING? It was God
[1:01:16] trying to get the very image out of his
[1:01:18] mind into the creation in the Garden of
[1:01:21] Eden.
[1:01:22] He said, "Here is a perfect man.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect. Let there be Let
[1:01:26] there be light. Let there be water. Let
[1:01:28] there be Let there be cows. Let there be
[1:01:30] fish.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Let's make man in our own image."
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And out of that man, he pulled out a
[1:01:37] rib. And he said he struck him and he
[1:01:40] got that rib and he said, "But next
[1:01:42] thing we see is the masterpiece that he
[1:01:44] struck on Calvary."
[1:01:48] So now we've got Jesus up here on the
[1:01:50] cross. And he said he got a piece of
[1:01:52] him.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; He was smitten, struck on the side.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What was he doing?" He
[1:01:58] said, "That was the the New Testament
[1:02:00] fulfilling the Old Testament." He said,
[1:02:02] "What it was?" He said, "It was the
[1:02:04] Jehovah, the Old foreshadowing the New.
[1:02:07] It was Christ, the masterpiece that was
[1:02:09] TO BE FULFILLED." NOW on Calvary,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; he pulls out a bride.
[1:02:16] Yes, sir.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; That's been washed, that's been
[1:02:18] redeemed, that's been justified,
[1:02:20] sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:02:22] by the blood on Calvary.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And he said, now what is he doing? He's
[1:02:27] got his bride fulfilling everything that
[1:02:30] is in the New Testament.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Another masterpiece in the making.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Your life is not ordinary.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Your life is not ordinary. He said it
[1:02:42] taken him 4,000 years to make this
[1:02:45] masterpiece and now another 2,000 years
[1:02:47] in making this masterpiece. A bride for
[1:02:50] Christ, another masterpiece.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; He said in doing so, he does it with his
[1:02:58] neverchanging method. The same way he
[1:03:00] made his masterpiece, the word.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; You see, it's not a big secret. It's the
[1:03:06] word. It's the word. So that's why it's
[1:03:08] so important that we're identified back
[1:03:10] with the word.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; When you're identified with something,
[1:03:13] that means that there's something there
[1:03:15] that you're relating with.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; It's something that you're going back
[1:03:18] to. You're recognized. And we have to
[1:03:20] recognize that the word in this hour is
[1:03:23] what identifies us with Christ. So when
[1:03:26] we look and we see Mark 16 in action,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; it's nothing more than the word of God
[1:03:32] manifesting itself in an identified
[1:03:34] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:37] You see, by their fruits you shall know
[1:03:40] them.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Now, listen. There's thousands, 44,000
[1:03:44] denominations that are having a church
[1:03:46] service somewhere today.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Think about this.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; They worship God.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; They're praising a God.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; They're singing songs that that and we
[1:04:00] sounded beautiful. You guys sounded just
[1:04:02] beautiful this morning. But they've got
[1:04:04] stage productions. They've got smoke.
[1:04:06] They got lights. They got mirrors. They
[1:04:08] got people coming down from the
[1:04:09] ceilings.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; But by their fruits,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; where is the power?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Where is the demonstration? Because the
[1:04:19] word says by their fruits. So when we
[1:04:22] see these cancers being healed, when we
[1:04:24] see the lost being saved, when we see
[1:04:26] loved ones who's been astray and going
[1:04:28] out into the world PULLED BACK IN,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; THERE'S YOUR FRUITS. There is your Mark
[1:04:34] 16 in action. Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; It's not because we dance and we shout.
[1:04:39] We don't dance to try to get the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; We don't sing to try to get it. We sing
[1:04:44] and dance and shout because we've got
[1:04:46] the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; That's why we do it. IT'S BECAUSE GOD is
[1:04:50] moving in our midst and he's working in
[1:04:52] our lives and he's transforming people.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; I got to try to find somewhere to get
[1:05:01] off. Brother Jesse, I know. I've been up
[1:05:03] here.
[1:05:05] But you see,
[1:05:08] who we identify with tells us a lot
[1:05:10] about who we are.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; You know, when you identify with
[1:05:16] someone, you become what's called an
[1:05:18] associate.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; An associate. So, if if I if if I'm
[1:05:24] doing the things of Christ, I'm an
[1:05:26] associate of Jesus Christ. Why? Because
[1:05:28] I'm associated with him. I'm associated
[1:05:30] with him on the basis of the blood that
[1:05:32] was shed on Calvary that there was a
[1:05:35] blood that says I have been redeemed
[1:05:37] made perfect
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; and when you let me tell you when you
[1:05:42] throw that word perfect out there people
[1:05:45] will kind of look at you and like be
[1:05:46] careful
[1:05:48] be careful sir
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; but let me tell you what the prophet
[1:05:51] said he said God was looking through the
[1:05:53] blood he doesn't see you no more as a
[1:05:55] sinner
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; oh he doesn't see you no more as a
[1:05:58] sinner he sees you as redeemed. He says
[1:06:01] you're redeemed because he always sees
[1:06:03] you through Christ. That's the reason we
[1:06:06] can be perfect.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we can be perfect. Not
[1:06:11] in the respect in the sense that we're
[1:06:13] uh uh perfect as sinners, but we're
[1:06:15] perfect in the eyes of God when we're in
[1:06:18] Christ.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Now, WE WE TALKED A MINUTE AGO about a
[1:06:22] conversation above us,
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; a conversation between God and Satan.
[1:06:27] And in that conversation, there's
[1:06:29] decisions to be made.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And so now we look and we say, "What do
[1:06:33] we identify with?" You see, it goes both
[1:06:35] ways. You can identify with Christ or
[1:06:37] you can identify with sin and unbelief.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And if you identify with sin and
[1:06:42] unbelief, you're going to act like a
[1:06:43] sinner.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Right? If you identify wi with with with
[1:06:46] with unbelief, it's going to lead you
[1:06:48] down roads that take you down tobacco
[1:06:51] use,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; alcoholism,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; adultery, fornication, pornography.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; This is the road that unbelief takes you
[1:06:59] down.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; So you don't want to be associated with
[1:07:03] the wrong spirit.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; You want to be associated with the Holy
[1:07:07] Spirit. The truth is numerous people
[1:07:10] around the w world and around the
[1:07:12] country don't know a thing about Christ.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Tommy witnesses. He he's a is a
[1:07:18] a tremendous witness. Brother Troy,
[1:07:20] tremendous witness.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; But you know, if they go out and they
[1:07:25] ask people about Christ, how many of
[1:07:28] them really know him?
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He's shaking his head. No, we live where
[1:07:32] we live. Let me tell you, we live in the
[1:07:34] Bible, but I don't know how it is up
[1:07:35] here in Akran, Ohio. But we got a church
[1:07:38] on every corner, on every street.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; We got a church that that may be called
[1:07:44] the First Baptist, and this one across
[1:07:46] the street may be the second Baptist,
[1:07:47] and the one beside it may be the First
[1:07:49] Baptist. Repeat.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; We live in the Bible belt. So around us,
[1:07:54] this sound this sounds this sounds like
[1:07:56] that this is a foolish statement to
[1:07:58] make, but people around the world don't
[1:08:01] know Jesus Christ.
[1:08:03] That's why it's so important that they
[1:08:05] see the life lived through God's people,
[1:08:08] through God's bride, that somebody can
[1:08:09] look at you and say, "That person's
[1:08:11] different.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; There's something about them that's
[1:08:13] different. They live different. They act
[1:08:15] different. They treat me different.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says talking about the
[1:08:27] Isuza Street." Now when we talk about
[1:08:29] Isuza Street, we immediately our minds
[1:08:32] go to Pentecostal, Holy Ghost, falling
[1:08:35] of the spirit and then we we think
[1:08:37] Pentecost, we think dancing, shouting,
[1:08:39] running. We think of all those things.
[1:08:42] But the Isuza street was different than
[1:08:44] what that was. Brother Brandham talks
[1:08:46] about that Isuza Street. He said that's
[1:08:48] where the first falling of the Holy
[1:08:50] Spirit was when it pulled the people
[1:08:51] together. Now watch what he says. He
[1:08:54] said when Christ came down amongst those
[1:08:55] people, they were I want you to notice
[1:08:58] the spirit about them. They were gentle.
[1:09:01] He didn't say they were ripping and
[1:09:03] running. They were gentle. They were
[1:09:06] peaceful. They lived godly lives. They
[1:09:10] lived sacrificial lives. He said they
[1:09:14] were willing to give in. They were
[1:09:16] willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. How
[1:09:20] many this morning would say, "God, I'm
[1:09:22] willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:09:26] willing to allow you to move in my life,
[1:09:28] to work in my life." He said, they
[1:09:29] didn't care what people said. They
[1:09:31] didn't care if they called him
[1:09:32] oldfashioned, crazy, or whatever.
[1:09:35] They wanted to be led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; identified by the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Now, we live in a world where identity
[1:09:45] has become prominent.
[1:09:47] If you're a woman, you identify as a
[1:09:49] woman. If you're a man, you identify as
[1:09:51] a man. Some men are now identifying as
[1:09:53] women, so they act like what? Women.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Some women identify as men, so they act
[1:09:58] like what? Men. They build themselves
[1:10:01] up. They they they look all burly and
[1:10:03] and like a brute. So if you identify
[1:10:05] whatever you identify with, that's what
[1:10:06] you'll become.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; So if you want to identify as a a as a
[1:10:10] as an outlaw, you're going to break the
[1:10:12] law.
[1:10:14] when he identified as an outlaw,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; he broke the law.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; The same goes true for any of us. But if
[1:10:23] you identify as a believer,
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; you're going to speak like a believer.
[1:10:28] You're going to act like a believer.
[1:10:30] You're going to quote like a believer.
[1:10:31] YOU'RE GOING TO BE able to do the things
[1:10:33] and have the faith that believers have.
[1:10:36] Why? Because you are a believer. Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, he said, "You
[1:10:41] know, when I was a kid, he said about 12
[1:10:43] years old." He said, "I went to the
[1:10:44] library and they had a book." And he
[1:10:46] said, "I got that book and I read about
[1:10:47] the Lone Ranger."
[1:10:50] He said, "I rode my mama's broom till it
[1:10:53] wrote it to death around the house being
[1:10:54] the Lone Ranger."
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "And then after that," he said,
[1:10:58] "I read about a man called Tarzan of the
[1:11:00] apes." He said, 'I took my mama's rug
[1:11:02] off the floor, cut it up, made me a
[1:11:04] cloth, and he said, I slept out in the
[1:11:06] trees to be Tarzan of the apes. He said,
[1:11:10] 'But the greatest thing that I ever
[1:11:11] found when I found something real and I
[1:11:14] found something and I found God. He
[1:11:16] said, that's when I found out that
[1:11:18] that's what I wanted to identify with
[1:11:19] was the real living word of Jesus
[1:11:22] Christ. That's where we need to be in
[1:11:24] this hour, brothers and sisters.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; God moving in our midst.
[1:11:33] We're going to get to the end here.
[1:11:35] Brother Brandon was talking about he
[1:11:37] said he got sent down to meet with the
[1:11:39] Pentecostals in California.
[1:11:41] And he said he went down there to the
[1:11:43] talk to the Pentecostals and meet with
[1:11:44] them down in California. And they they
[1:11:46] took him to the burial place of Amy
[1:11:48] Simple McFerson. And he said he was
[1:11:51] there and he was looking and he was
[1:11:52] going all around there and he was
[1:11:53] looking around and paying his respects.
[1:11:55] And he said all of a sudden he turned
[1:11:57] the corner and he said there stood a
[1:12:00] statue of Moses
[1:12:02] and he said Michelangelo made that
[1:12:04] statue of Moses and he said he was a
[1:12:07] great sculptor and he said there he was.
[1:12:10] This was the masterpiece his capstone
[1:12:12] work of his life. This masterpiece of
[1:12:15] Moses and he said he sat there and he
[1:12:17] noticed and he looked at it that this
[1:12:19] statue looked perfect. It looked smooth.
[1:12:22] Stand up for me brother. Come on up
[1:12:24] here. You're the center of attention.
[1:12:26] Now turn around there. Look at this
[1:12:27] strapping young man.
[1:12:30] Hold your tablets. Moses.
[1:12:34] There stood Moses,
[1:12:37] a statue of perfection.
[1:12:40] Brother Brandham said he stood there
[1:12:41] with his beard. He had the tablets of
[1:12:43] Ten Commandments in his hand. He said
[1:12:45] you could, as Michelangelo looked and he
[1:12:48] felt, he's smooth. Wasn't a flaw in him.
[1:12:53] Michelangelo looked at it. walked around
[1:12:55] him.
[1:12:58] Wow.
[1:13:00] Look at this
[1:13:03] perfection
[1:13:05] perfection. And he said, "Michael
[1:13:07] Angelo, he got SO INSPIRED by looking at
[1:13:11] the perfection of the work that he had
[1:13:12] done, the vision of his mind that had
[1:13:14] now come into reality. years and years
[1:13:17] of chipping and chiseling and working
[1:13:19] and breaking off this piece of stone,
[1:13:21] breaking off this doubt, this fear, this
[1:13:23] anxiety, breaking off ALL THESE PIECES.
[1:13:26] NOW, here's a smooth, polished, perfect
[1:13:29] specimen, the vision in his mind.
[1:13:34] And he said, "IT IS SO INSPIRED,
[1:13:36] MICHELANGELO, THAT HE TOOK THE hammer
[1:13:38] and he struck his right knee and said,
[1:13:40] "Speak."
[1:13:41] You can have your seat. Thank you.
[1:13:43] And he said, "Speak."
[1:13:47] What was that? It was so such a perfect
[1:13:50] thing that it looked like it WAS BECOME
[1:13:51] SO LIFELIKE THAT HE WANTED TO hear it
[1:13:53] speak. And brother Brandham said people
[1:13:55] that people said that Michelangelo
[1:13:57] almost ruined the statue. But he said,
[1:13:59] "No, that's not the way I saw it." He
[1:14:02] said, "I saw where he struck the leg and
[1:14:04] put a mar on it and marked it." He said,
[1:14:06] "That's what made him perfect."
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And he said, "There was Jesus up on
[1:14:11] Calvary. Come on.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; There was Jesus up on Calvary and he
[1:14:16] said there he was perfect and God had
[1:14:19] placed Jesus in a perfect position for
[1:14:21] the entire world to see what perfection
[1:14:24] look like.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; So here is Jesus perfection. Never
[1:14:29] doubted, never had fear.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Never never give in to Satan. Sinless.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He said there he sits up there. Perfect.
[1:14:45] He said, "There he was sitting there to
[1:14:46] fulfill all of God's handiwork
[1:14:50] down through the ages." Now, think about
[1:14:52] this. DOWN THROUGH THE AGES, STARTING
[1:14:54] back in the Garden of Eden, there was
[1:14:56] Adam. He took out of his side to make a
[1:14:58] bride for Adam.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; She was what? Imperfect.
[1:15:04] We hear the stories about Moses. And we
[1:15:06] think about how great Moses was. But
[1:15:08] down through time, what did Moses do? He
[1:15:10] gave in to temper.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; We look and we see Abraham. We think,
[1:15:15] man, what a great man Abraham was. Look
[1:15:17] at all he did. But he became a liar.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, she's my sister. You know the story
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; twice.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; David, what a great man he was. What a
[1:15:31] what a great story. We hear ABOUT DAVID
[1:15:33] AND DAVID out there doing all these
[1:15:35] wonderful things until murder, adultery,
[1:15:39] lust came in on the scene.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; But now down through God's handiwork,
[1:15:45] down through time, finally he says,
[1:15:47] "This is my Jehovah."
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; The perfect picture of what I've been
[1:15:52] trying to get through all of these
[1:15:53] years. Absolutely perfect.
[1:15:59] And he said, "Now that perfect
[1:16:01] masterpiece
[1:16:04] up on Calvary,
[1:16:07] God had to smoke it."
[1:16:11] Just like Michelangelo's statue of Moses
[1:16:13] was so perfect, not a flaw in it,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; he had to hit it. AND NOW CHRIST SETS UP
[1:16:20] ON Calvary the perfect image of what
[1:16:23] what what what the world needs,
[1:16:26] what the world deserves. Listen to me.
[1:16:30] And the prophet said there he stood.
[1:16:34] Marred.
[1:16:37] I said what the world deserves.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Marred,
[1:16:42] bruised, bloody,
[1:16:46] striped.
[1:16:47] He said he sat there and he just looked
[1:16:49] like a big pile of blood and bones
[1:16:52] walking together.
[1:16:54] That's perfection.
[1:17:00] A big pile of blood and bones walking
[1:17:04] together. He didn't even look like a
[1:17:07] human being.
[1:17:11] So marred.
[1:17:13] Why?
[1:17:14] As he was smitten in his side, God said,
[1:17:17] "I got to make a bride."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I got to make a bride.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Perfection became imperfection
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; so that imperfection can become
[1:17:30] perfection.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] As we close the service here, I want to
[1:17:46] share one more quote with you just to
[1:17:49] encourage you and build you build your
[1:17:50] faith through the weeks to come. You
[1:17:52] say, "How do I overcome? How do I do
[1:17:54] this? If I if I've got this bad idea or
[1:17:56] these bad thoughts or or whatever, you
[1:17:58] know, we're still flesh.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We're flesh. We battle. Every day we get
[1:18:02] up, we battle.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; How do I overcome this?" Brother
[1:18:05] Brandham said, "How if you want to
[1:18:07] overcome it, here's the way you do it."
[1:18:09] He said, "Just become a lamb again.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Just go back to Calvary."
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Just go back and get under that blood.
[1:18:18] Get under that cleansing blood of Jesus
[1:18:20] Christ.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And and and confess what you have need
[1:18:23] of. He says Jesus is the high priest of
[1:18:25] our confession. It's that simple.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. He says, "When you
[1:18:30] accept that you're not saved, you're not
[1:18:32] in a good place."
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Right? But if you'll just accept that
[1:18:36] you're saved and and you say, "I'm
[1:18:38] saved.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm saved." He says, "You, I'm saved
[1:18:44] because God, I've met every requirement
[1:18:47] that God required of me. I'm saved
[1:18:49] according to the Bible,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; not because you feel saved,
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; there's a lot of days I think, oh Lord,
[1:18:55] where am I at?"
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; But if I go on my feelings,
[1:19:05] I'll never make it on my feelings.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; You'll never make it on your feelings.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet says that he makes
[1:19:12] it very clear. He said, "Satan can whoop
[1:19:14] you around the stump time after time on
[1:19:16] your feelings." But it's when you use
[1:19:18] thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; How many do we have saved today?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Let's say it. I'm saved.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[1:19:28] He says people, he says people may look
[1:19:31] at you and say there's no difference in
[1:19:32] you.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; But you keep with your confession.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I'm saved. He says, "And before you know
[1:19:43] it, your neighbors will know you're
[1:19:45] saved."
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Everybody will know you're saved. Why?
[1:19:49] Because you're confessing it. And he is
[1:19:51] the high priest of your confession. And
[1:19:53] he's making good on what's your
[1:19:55] confession. Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I need the Holy Ghost. I GOT THE Holy
[1:20:00] Ghost.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Keep saying it.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Keep believing it.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Keep living it. Keep surrounding
[1:20:05] yourself around that environment.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Young people, be in church.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Older people, be in church.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Bride, be in church.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a young man and and
[1:20:18] and there's a young man that was having
[1:20:20] a desire for the Holy Ghost. He he he
[1:20:24] just just had lived just just a good
[1:20:25] life and and just a just a fine young
[1:20:28] man. He had a desire for the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:31] He was in some meetings where Brother
[1:20:32] Ron Spencer was and he went up in there
[1:20:34] and he went up to brother Ron and he
[1:20:36] said, "Brother Ron,
[1:20:38] I just want the Holy Ghost
[1:20:41] and he was getting discouraged because
[1:20:43] he could see other people getting the
[1:20:44] Holy Ghost and he could see other things
[1:20:46] moving." And you know what brother Ron's
[1:20:47] wisdom was to him? He said, "You just
[1:20:49] stay in that atmosphere.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will grant your desire.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Stay in that atmosphere.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; God will grant your desire.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Weeks go by, he still has a desire. More
[1:21:03] discouragement. He goes to another
[1:21:05] meeting. Yeah. Are you with me? He's
[1:21:07] staying in the environment.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; He goes to another meeting. Brother
[1:21:10] Ron's preaching at that meeting. He goes
[1:21:13] up again and you know what he says to
[1:21:14] Brother Ron? Brother Ron, I want the
[1:21:17] Holy Ghost.
[1:21:19] He said, "I'm going to pray for you
[1:21:20] again." Stay in that environment.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Stay in that environment.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; They pray. He says, "God's going to
[1:21:27] grant your desire. Stay in the Stay in
[1:21:30] the environment.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; If you want to be Christlike, stay in
[1:21:34] the environment."
[1:21:36] Yes,
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Couple weeks go by, this young man's out
[1:21:41] mowing yards.
[1:21:44] He's mowing yards. Are you with me?
[1:21:48] He had his headphones on. He was
[1:21:50] listening to a service.
[1:21:52] He was listening to a service. And all
[1:21:55] of a sudden, the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; mowing a yard.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost comes down and falls
[1:22:05] upon him. Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; He shuts the mower off and lays face
[1:22:09] down in the customer's yard for an hour
[1:22:12] and a half
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; as he's receiving the gift of the Holy
[1:22:16] Ghost.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; He calls me and he says, "I know that I
[1:22:20] KNOW I'M GOING TO HEAVEN." I SAID,
[1:22:22] "That's the plan all along."
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE stayed in the
[1:22:26] environment.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, when life looks
[1:22:29] tough, when things look discouraging,
[1:22:32] stay in the environment. Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; This last one and we're going to we're
[1:22:37] going to close it down. Brother Brandham
[1:22:38] says the same thing about healing.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you accept him as your
[1:22:43] healer, renounce your feelings."
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the symptoms. Don't look
[1:22:47] at the diagnosis. Don't look at the
[1:22:49] pain, the hurt.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the the the things that's
[1:22:52] going on in your mind.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But look to your healer. It's not by
[1:22:56] feelings. It's by faith. If you're
[1:22:58] healed, believe you're healed.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "And act like you're healed."
[1:23:03] Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Now watch what this next one he says.
[1:23:06] Associate with those who believe in
[1:23:09] healing.
[1:23:13] [applause]
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; It's who you identify with, what you
[1:23:15] associate with.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; If you want healing, believe and
[1:23:20] associate those who believe in healing,
[1:23:22] and God will bring you right out to
[1:23:25] perfect soundness of health.
[1:23:30] And he finishes that statement with it
[1:23:32] will not fail.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; How many believes the words of the
[1:23:36] prophet?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for the five-fold
[1:23:38] ministry?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; The words of a prophet in this hour that
[1:23:41] we have. Praise the Lord. Brother Jesse,
[1:23:43] won't you come? Musicians, won't you
[1:23:45] come?
[1:23:49] Won't we just bow our heads and
[1:23:52] have a word of prayer?
[1:23:56] You got just place something softly
[1:23:57] there for the Malachi.
[1:24:03] Lord, we're so thankful, Lord, and for
[1:24:06] this service. Lord, I
[1:24:09] just want to say how how much I
[1:24:11] appreciate you coming today.
[1:24:14] I I just felt your presence from the
[1:24:16] moment we arrived and such a sweet
[1:24:19] [music] spirit on the church here, the
[1:24:21] ministry,
[1:24:24] the people. [music]
[1:24:30] We just thank you for visiting us today,
[1:24:33] Lord.
[1:24:36] Lord, I I I [music] feel like it was
[1:24:38] just a broken up message, Father.
[1:24:42] But Lord, I [music] trust it spoke to
[1:24:44] somebody. I know it spoke to my heart,
[1:24:46] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Lord,
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; that Lord, no matter what we're going
[1:24:51] through, no matter what challenges we
[1:24:53] face, no matter the circumstances, just
[1:24:55] like Job had circumstance [music]
[1:24:56] after circumstance after circumstance,
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; you delivered. You restored two-fold of
[1:25:03] whatever he had before, you gave [music]
[1:25:05] back to him. And Lord, we stand before
[1:25:07] you this morning declaring who we are,
[1:25:10] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:14] And Lord, what a masterpiece as we
[1:25:16] looked at Calvary
[1:25:20] and how much you cared for us, Lord,
[1:25:21] that you sent your perfect son, [music]
[1:25:23] the sinless one, the perfect one, to a
[1:25:27] place called Calvary.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And your word tells us that it pleased
[1:25:32] you, oh Lord.
[1:25:35] It pleased you.
[1:25:39] It didn't please you because you had to
[1:25:40] hurt him. It didn't please you because
[1:25:42] there there had to be a smitten side,
[1:25:45] but it pleased you because you could see
[1:25:47] the perfection. And in that perfection,
[1:25:49] you was able to pull out a perfect
[1:25:50] [music] bride hidden and tucked away
[1:25:53] under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:57] Lord,
[1:25:59] thank you for calling us in this [music]
[1:26:00] hour, for moving in our lives, for being
[1:26:04] our healer, for being our deliverer, for
[1:26:07] being our burden bearer,
[1:26:10] for taking all the fears and all the
[1:26:11] doubts and all the anguish and worry and
[1:26:14] helping us to realize that you're in
[1:26:17] control.
[1:26:19] It's not me. It's not man. When man gets
[1:26:21] into ideas in the way, it's just that in
[1:26:23] the way. So Lord, we just dedicate
[1:26:26] ourselves. We rededicate ourselves today
[1:26:30] and ask Lord that you would just have
[1:26:32] preeminence [music] in our lives.
[1:26:34] If there's somebody here that needs
[1:26:36] healing, we ask that you heal them. If
[1:26:38] there's somebody here that needs
[1:26:39] deliverance from from the from from from
[1:26:41] some habit or some form of wickedness,
[1:26:44] Lord, we ask that you deliver them. If
[1:26:46] there's somebody here that just needs
[1:26:47] redemption, we ask that you redeem
[1:26:49] redeem them this morning. [music] If
[1:26:51] there's a lost soul here, just continue
[1:26:53] to work and pull them into your fold.
[1:26:55] Father,
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; if there's somebody here with a desire
[1:26:58] for the Holy Ghost,
[1:27:00] grant [music] their desire, Lord.
[1:27:03] Bless this church, we pray. Bless bless
[1:27:06] Brother Jesse and his efforts here,
[1:27:07] Lord. Such a sweet, sweet group people.
[1:27:10] Lord, move in their way in their midst
[1:27:13] in a mighty way in the weeks to come, in
[1:27:15] the years to come. May they may may
[1:27:17] [music] they see May they see growth.
[1:27:19] May they see the the uncction of the
[1:27:21] Holy Ghost and and the power and the
[1:27:23] demonstration of what you're doing in
[1:27:25] this hour through their people as they
[1:27:28] receive the word as as brother Jesse
[1:27:30] preaches and ministers and his love is
[1:27:32] portrayed to the people. May they grasp
[1:27:34] a hold of it's you speaking to them,
[1:27:37] Lord. It's you calling us up higher.
[1:27:40] It's you cutting the the the the things
[1:27:43] out of our lives that we don't need.
[1:27:46] So Lord, we dedicate ourselves to you
[1:27:48] today, Lord, and we give you praise and
[1:27:51] honor and [music] glory
[1:27:53] as our savior Jesus Christ.
