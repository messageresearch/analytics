========================================

but on the internet I didn't put it as a part two because I want to focus more on this idea of we depart from iniquity and on the same lines of we are not the workers of iniquity so I want to take tonight and I want to look at that uh chain of scriptures down through the Bible Matthew 721 you have your Bible Matthew 7:21 by the grace of God and then we'll go back to 2 Timothy 2:9 Matthew 7:21 some have called this the scariest scripture in the Bible now we don't have uh fear of man right but we fear the Lord hallelujah and it just makes us sober as Christians you know we we we trust we're saved we believe we're saved we confess we're saved uh but we look at this scripture soberly and the Bible says Paul says examine yourself he said to make sure you're in the faith Hallelujah he he said either Jesus Christ is in you or your reprobate which means rejected so you either have the spirit of God working on you in one of the three stages of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost which is new spirit my spirit I'm sorry uh uh new spirit uh I'm sorry new heart new spirit my spirit so the spirit of God is in you working in one of those Realms or a person is rejected so we want the spirit of God to deal with us hallelujah no matter where we are on our spiritual journey we want the spirit of God God to woo us with his love Hallelujah Clean us out make us pure Hallelujah Matthew 7:21 turn there my Bible now I'll read 2122 then we I'll read 23 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven praise God that's that's the heart of Christianity I don't want to do my will I want to do God's will that's how we all feel verse 22 many not a few but many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out Devils so that's balum Judas are some examples there prophesy it's correct casting out Devils Judas and in thy name done many wonderful works so any of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit there any of the five preaching gifts in verse 23 let's read that 1 2 3 and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity all right let's go to Second Timothy 2:19 2 Timothy 21:19 so tying these verses together we're looking at the word of course iniquity we depart from iniquity that's my thought for tonight but it's just like a part two let's read that on three ready one two 3 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated by God's grace appreciate your honor and respect for the word of God hallelujah we're very thankful that God knows us hallelujah God knows them that are his hallelujah it's a real blessing uh to have that understanding and that knowledge and church how many of you feel like uh one of the sheep that Jesus left the 99 and you feel like you're the one he left all the 99 to go get that one how many feel like you're that one Hallelujah I know that for sure in my life I was running far from God and who came looking for me Jesus came looking for me Hallelujah so all of us should have that awareness in our lives we remember the time when Jesus came running to us and what did he do he threw us on his shoulders and brought us into the fold Hallelujah brought us back what a blessing what a promise Hallelujah so I want to look here tonight let's just I want to Define iniquity by the uh the Lexicon and then how brother random gives us like a more simplified uh version of it uh in in the in the Lexicon um iniquity means illegality which is a violation of the law or wickedness so it's like a purposeful transgression of the law okay so iniquity is uh you purposely violate the law on purpose right uh and it's to transgress iniquity wickedness okay brother random uh says it like this iniquity is something that you're going out and you do it and you know you oughtn't to have done it Hallelujah now uh we all could take a few moments if if we wanted to and think of just this past week did we do something that we knew we should not have done did we kind of bend the truth a little bit on a lie did we take something that wasn't exactly ours we didn't maybe ask for it do we Harbor an evil thought and do we maybe text something or email something we probably should not have said uh did we watch something we should not have watched we all can look at our lives and and recognize you know we have iniquities in our life but the beautiful promise and this is the quote brother Ram gives us the same quote he says uh but don't forget the benefits to being a Christian David cried forget not all his benefits bless the Lord oh my soul in Psalm 103 verses 2 through three 2-5 and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits brother says benefits what is a benefit in the journey and he says this who forgives all mine iniquity if he did it under the blood of bulls and goats surely it's even better under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then brother R gives that definition iniquity is something you're going out you do it and you know you oughtn't to have done it but he forgives it you ask him he forgives you amen hallelujah it's that simple right it's such a simple transaction you repent you ask for forgiveness he gives it to you freely Hallelujah he said forgives all of my iniquity heals all of my diseases hallelujah what a promise amen so we can see the simple definition there you know as I Was preparing this uh sermon I had numerous thoughts and so I guess the thought the the kind of Direction I want to go is I've been you know reading through I read through Ezekiel Jeremiah the last few months and now I'm in lamentation so my mind has been on you know Jerusalem's destruction so I want to just briefly go through the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar around 585 BC around 585 BC and church if you pull up Lamentations 4:6 AAA I just want to just review this briefly so you have an understanding um remember uh uh David said this is the city of the great king we sing about it great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and uh the B David called it the joy of the whole earth and it was beautiful under David's day but in Solomon's day it was even more magnificent all the gold and the Magnificent uh uh reflection of the the sunlight on the gold all the gold and and the brass and Solomon's uh beautiful magnificent Temple but the reason God destroyed it and God destroyed it some uh 300 it's either 345 or 355 years after Solomon started building Pagan temples in Jerusalem God gave him window over there about 345 or 355 years and when they wouldn't repent now that's almost the 400 years kind of like uh uh with uh Abraham God told Abraham you know the cup of of the iniquity of the amorites wasn't full yet he gave them 400 more years so why did God destroy Jerusalem verse uh lamentation 4:6 tells us for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom that was overthrown and as in a moment and no hands stayed on her so uh the the the writer of lamentation says Jerusalem's destruction was worse than Sodom and gomorrah's destruction I showed you the videos I showed you some pictures of last year about how the sulfur still is still in existence in the in the ruins of Sodom there the video's got over millions of views and uh the one guy took a little chunk of that sulfur burn it and lit it up and just burned right there and you can still see shapes of humans and shapes of buildings that are still there and they were destroyed in a moment's Time by fire and brimstone but but the holy spirit says God's destruction of Jerusalem was worse than that and so Adam Clark this is just his thought uh seemed like he said but uh Sodom was destroyed in a moment Jerusalem though they fell by the most lingering calamities so it's like the Judgment was coming and it wasn't fast it was slow like oh it's kind of foreshadowing here something's bad I can see it's getting closer and closer and the destruction is getting closer and it wasn't just something simple and fast it was a lingered out judgment because uh they were uh surrounded by King Nebuchadnezzar now he came uh he came there and uh as we said in 585 BC the actual destruction was made but it was either 18 or 30 months that Nebuchadnezzar used to try to weaken Jerusalem first he he put a Siege of soldiers all around uh Jerusalem so nothing could get in and nothing could go out so he put a Siege around him and then after a few short months there was a famine the Bible said in second Tim 2 Kings 259 he burnt the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem and all the houses of the Great Men burned he with fire reminds us of Los Angeles doesn't it Lamentations 4 said said 4:10 said the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people so during The Siege the famine was so severe that people resorted to eating the little ones but they were warned about this in Deuteronomy 2853 God told them if you don't kill your enemy your enemy will kill you Church remind us reminds us we better destroy the demons that are trying to destroy us hallelujah and how do we destroy them cast them down rebuke them in Jesus Christ's name don't give in them don't feed them don't give them even a moment's look don't stop and think about it for just a second don't even give it any thoughts just run to God flee to Jesus Hallelujah get as far away as you possibly can so it was either 18 to 30 months it began in the ninth year of King zedekiah's Reign according to 2 Kings 25 verse1 and then of course it went to famine and eventually uh desperation remember what you know the sad part is you know uh the the the very night where uh the the king got caught the Bible said all the men of War fled By Night by the way of the gate in the two walls these men left all the women and children behind not very manly doesn't sound like very manly right look what iniquity brings you down to this is what iniquity brings you down to right destroying your uh you know eating family members I know it's it's unheard of we would never even consider that but this is what happens to people that that God used to visit them 350 years earlier God would visit them with a pillar of fire church the pillar of fire visited brother brandom hallelujah amen is that right amen the pillar of fire visits us hallelujah when God does a miracle God speaks something God does Supernatural it's as if the pillar of fire has visited us hallelujah but they got so used to not having the pillar of fire that they started compromising and worshiping other gods so uh the The Siege caused a famine and Desperation the F I'm sorry the city fell and was destroyed so about 18 to 30 months and it was uh an awful awful destruction and what caused it Church iniquity now see we see it many ways too some sometimes people among us you know they'll they might fall Away really fast or it might be really slow people that live in iniquity right even amongst us or other message churches you know I talk to lots of pastors right and I hear they they experience the same thing people uh can can just instantly just turn on them right and take the wrong Spirit right or it just might be a slow kind of descent well first they don't come to the evening service and then they miss Wednesday and then they start changing the way they're dressing and you know and then they start changing the way they're talking and it's just a slow iniquity has a slow impact on other people or it can come very quick just like Sodom and Gomorrah but it was uh it was disastrous to see how all this uh could take place to a people that knew God a people that had prophets right people that had the pillar of fire Miracles worship and yet because of compromise see church as soon as Solomon built that first Pagan Temple that was the first step away and see once you allow one sin look then you can start allowing all the others so see you got to go back to that first one get rid of the first one makees you get rid of all the sin Hallelujah because it's so easy if you just compromise on one thing well then I can just start doing that and I can just start doing that that's clearly works of iniquity Hallelujah but we we want to live in a way where God can forgive our iniquity because we'll confess our iniquity we'll take the idols out of our Lives we'll make the land clean again Hallelujah so what iniquities did uh Israel commit you know as I said I've been reading through lots of uh books here and they're all related to the same thing here with jermiah many many evils in Jeremiah 2: 13 He said my people have committed two evils they forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water imagine leaving a beautiful Fountain of water to go drink on some uh Dead uh dirty stinking water corrupt water you leave the Fountain of Living Water to go drink some diseased water or just worse than that anything you could imagine this is the first evil they forsook God they left God and then they hewed to themselves sists broken sists that can hold no water so they tried to create sisters that could hold their own water see create their own religion but see it couldn't hold water right it uh it was a broken system right their lives couldn't their lives couldn't contain uh even the sin right it was just like a leaking sstn but see uh the believer has a a Fountain of Living Water brother man said you've got a gushing stream all the time that you have access to if you want to drink from God's spirit Hallelujah you have access has to it all the time praise God you can drink from The Fountains of life amen what a blessing and as I turn the pages you know uh idolatry is a huge one uh and God Called It lovers it's as if every one of their Idols was a different lover that they loved other than God they forsook loving God and they took all these other lovers I love what God promises though in Jeremiah 322 I preach it when I preach the backsliding series return ye backsliding children and I'll heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our God so see God will heal if we return hallelujah what a promise that he gives us now it's interesting in chapter 4 there's makeup and face painting in verse 30 Jeremiah 4:30 you see so many sins in here look idolatry uh the wrong uh uh marriages you see face painting uh you see their uh when they got rich and they got more money that's when they fell into sin's traps I call it the prosperity trap because I probably heard somebody say that before it's not I didn't coin that okay uh that's in Jeremiah 5: 2728 and 29 when they became wax and Rich they were wax and fat they forgot the fatherless they forgot the needy and then their Prophet started prophesying falsely they started believing false prophecies Hallelujah and the the amazing thing is that the people loved to have it so they loved lies I'm just amazed these false prophets online they they they they tried to uh make Co stop and in the name of the Lord it didn't happen in other words these people are getting all these lies and they keep giving them money it's because they they love the emotion of it because they they they know he's in sin and he's living in sin and if as long as he lives in sin then I can live in sin too I'm going to keep supporting him because he's uh he's living in sin and I like sin too see because he's tickling their itching ears letting them marry two three times and who knows what else my goodness the Bible said he said God's people Israel love to have it so they love false pre Preachers and Prophets we don't love them here hallelujah we love real preachers here hallelujah real prophets here like William Brandon was a real prophet of God hallelujah that's what we love here hallelujah he even even speaks of the reprobate mind in Jeremiah uh 6:30 reprobate and silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejected them remember God tells Jeremiah not to pray for Israel in Jeremiah 7: 16 therefore pray thou not for this people now look idolatry was a family affair look at uh Jeremiah uh 7:18 the children gather the wood the fathers Kindle the fire and the women need their dough to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven so it's a family affair and that's how it is today the little children will get their little Nintendo devices and worship those games and they don't teach them nothing about Jesus right and then the dads got their porn or whatever they got and the moms got their gossip I'm just throwing things out there they got their Shopify whatever you know who knows what they who the men got their tools and they worship their Tools in their trucks you know you know you know what I'm saying everybody's got their own Idols it don't have to be one particular thing but see it was a family affair everybody partook in that somebody should have stood up and said no we're K we're taking this Idol out of the house let's serve God hallelujah let's let's serve a real living God let's drink from the fountain Hallelujah of Living Waters Hallelujah but nobody did very few people did the one time this is pretty great in uh Jeremiah 7:29 the one time God told people to cut their hair was when they were full of idolatry and iniquity so you you you'll never find a verse where God ask a Godly woman to cut her hair but God does tell them in iniquity and this one you can't even tell if it's a male or female right so it's so it's so uh vague God never asked a Christian or Jewish woman to cut her hair if she's a Godly woman verse 29 he said cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem so he's speaking to the whole City oh Jerusalem and cast it away take up a lamentation on high places for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of the rest did they no but yet look at Nineveh Nineveh would repent in dust and Ashes a bunch of heathens right this is why Jerusalem got the worst judgment because they knew even better they they the Bible said Angels uh ministered and brought them uh the word of God Moses brought it down on tables of stone written with the hand of God hallelujah they saw the pill of fire they saw the Miracles they saw the Red Sea cross but because they lived in iniquity they lived opposite to what they knew God gave them a greater judgment a long lasting drawn out rebuke and judgment man and I'm just flipping through here because I I I've written so much about it here uh in my Bible here just look at all the all the different uh sins that they commit let me skip ahead even hezekiah's son the son that he prayed for remember he prayed he said God accept my life even hezekiah's own son caused this destruction he had a big part in it in Jeremiah 154 isn't that something remember brother R tells us and the Bible said that was the permissive will of God God did a mighty miracle for Hezekiah but he should have died when God wanted to take him home because his son that grew up helped cause the destruction of Jerusalem look at verse four and I will cause them to be removed in the kingdoms of the Earth because of Manasseh the son of who see wanting a longer life wanting uh goods and and money and all these things that's not always God's will right look what it produced amen now was he sincere yes Hezekiah was extremely sincere but see wanting something other than the will of God is a is an awful thing we should not want the permiss the will of God we should want the perfect will of God hallelujah brother Chris you got a question brother yes oh yes yeah you can read the whole chapter brother you can see all the evil that he did I don't have that studied up here for tonight but yeah you could easily if you like have a Bible dictionary just type in Manasseh son of Hezekiah it would list all the things you could just do chat GTP too that's that's really handy I've been I've been getting a lot of good notes from JP as far as they give you gives a list the scriptures there so think of that you know even the permissive will of God now I'm going to jump ahead here Idols yeah let's go to chapter 19 Idols in 19 ver4 because they forsaken me and estrange this place and have burned incense in it to the other gods whom neither they have they or nor their fathers have known nor the kings of Judah and have filled this place with the blood of Innocence so they're burning incense and then they're shedding innocent blood it's it's babies verse 5 they have built also upon the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal which I commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind so because they sacrificed their children God tells them in verse nine you're going to eat your children look at verse n and I will cause them to eat the Flesh of their sons and their flesh of their daughters and they shall eat everyone the Flesh of his friend in The Siege in the straightness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straighten them my goodness this is uh let's see 8855 this is 20 years before it happened Jeremiah says thus sayith the Lord if you don't stop these abortions here's what you're going to do and I hate to repeat it but that's what that's what they're going to that 20 years look at this over and over again year after year Jeremiah warns them thus sayi the Lord thus say the Lord thus say the Lord they threw him in prison they threw him in a pit of mud and he almost died and God's like just stand there and speak it and Jeremiah's like I'm done preaching but he said but then a fire was burning like a fire burning up in my bones and I've got got to say what God's called me to say no doubt Jeremiah walk all around the Bible said Jeremiah would would go in there they'd be worshiping there in the temple of God and walk outside and there's temples erected that Solomon had erected to false gods burning children doing all these wicked things right outside there and he constantly was thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord and they still wouldn't turn he was very sorrowful he even curses the day he was born he was so discouraged that they wouldn't listen to him I ought to be encouraged I got so many people that listen to my preaching I get so many people that come up and repent now for a small church I thank God for that but Jeremiah didn't get that he just had a few people that he was put in jail in chapter 20 and now church now look at verse 20 verse 7 now here's God's grace on prophets look look look look at what he says Jeremiah 20:7 oh Lord thou Hast deceived me and I was deceived did God deceive Jeremiah no but see sometimes remember your words this is calling God a deceiver you're calling God a deceiver who said this Jeremiah Church in our Darkest Hours we'll utter the the most foolish things why he's in prison uh he he's rejected he's he's not getting fed and he was in prison multiple times do you know he was carried away at the end of his life to Egypt and died in Egypt didn't even die in The Promised Land for a prophet of God that we all look to no no wonder he's called uh The Sorrowing Prophet like Jesus was sorrow preaching thus sayi the Lord warning them don't do this to your children don't erect these Idols don't live like that don't do these things and yet people wouldn't take heed thank God that there uh thank God that there was a Jeremiah and Ezekiel hallelujah thank God that there was somebody Hallelujah that believe the word of God he curses the very day he was born in verse 14 cursed be the day in where and I was bornn sound like sound familiar like job church sometimes Believers can get discouraged they don't see all the fruits of their Ministry oh but they're going to see it on the other side Hallelujah is that right God will reward them richly on the other side if they're faithful with the little God will make them rule over much hallelujah oh my you can just see all the all the wickedness of Jeremiah's uh generation yeah okay now so we see idolatry false worship of God child sacrifice to Pagan deities shedding innocent blood and violence they just let this go on sexual immorality and spiritual adultery they oppressed the poor the orphans and the widows no wonder God said don't even pray for these people and they desecrated the Sabbath in Ezekiel 20:8 but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man Cast Away the Abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt then I said I will pour out my Fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst in the of the land of Egypt Hallelujah moreover verse uh 12 Ezekiel 20:12 moreover also I gave them my Sabbath to be a sign between me and them that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them but the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walk not in my statutes and they despise my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my Sabbath they greatly polluted then I said I would pour out my Fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them it seems like everything God told them to do they did the opposite they refused to repent when a prophet gave them thus sayith the Lord Jeremiah 7:26 yet not they hearken not unto me nor inclin their ear but Harden their neck they did worse than their fathers now I've read this one before to you this is a beautiful scripture 2 Chronicles 36:16 let me turn there because there's a beautiful verse in there 2 Chronicles 36:16 you know You' you do yourself some real good church if you listen to brother brandom and then if he rebukes you on something go make it right go confess your sins that would do you some good that does me good Hallelujah 2 Chronicles 36 because why it shows you're re you're you're accepting a prophet's word you're accepting the prophet that's why when I heard brother man say a man shouldn't have long hair quickly cut my hair by God's grace 2 Chronicles 36:16 nobody ever told me that nobody preached that to me yeah verse let's do 15 15 is so beautiful it's been a while since I preach this and the Lord God of their fathers sent up sent to them by his Messengers rising up bee times and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his Dwelling Place he didn't God didn't send Jeremiah or brother Ram to bother us God sent brother in Jeremiah and Isaiah to show his compassion to us right to treat our children the right way to uh to worship the only thing that's worth worshiping Hallelujah to honor the Sabbath for us it's a Sunday don't work on Sunday honor Sunday Hallelujah give God a full day of worship praise God uh taking care of the poor the widows the people that really need it Hallelujah but instead of uh instead of them accepting the prophet what do they do to uh Jeremiah brother brandom Isaiah they mock The Messengers of God and despise his words and misuse His prophets until the Wrath of the Lord rose against his people till there was no remedy now Church what's interesting is Solomon set up his first Idol in either 345 or 35 I'm sorry in uh either uh 936 uh or is it 938 ad and then uh Jerusalem was the destroyed in 585 uh BC so it either went 345 years till destruction came or 355 how many knows uh how long has our nation been going on we're coming up on 249 almost 250 well I'm starting at 1776 when we declared independence so I got out the I got the calculator today so we're already at 249 years now think think of all the babies they killed what about America it's over 70 million it's over 70 million and there's some reports I was rejoicing at first it seemed like it says there was less abortions now some Reports say now there's actually more abortions since roie Wade so I don't know what to think all I know is say God have mercy on us God have mercy on what you who you can it's hard to know who what to believe but that's why we put all of our trust in the word of God hallelujah so they had corrupt leadership corrupt priests corrupt false prophets and so because of this God had to send Nebuchadnezzar and Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the walls uh burnt the house of God burned it with fire and it was a slow like I said 36 to uh I'm sorry 18 to 30 month process of just slowing everything gets worse and worse day by day day by day day by day until God destroys it God said that was worse than Sodom and Gomorrah God gave the religion people his own people that were supposed to be his people gave them a worse judgment than Sodom and Gomorrah because of iniquity they knew better now Church how many know God's so merciful in the New Testament Lydia found this verse put up Leviticus 20:1 this was a great thought we're talking on Bible time I think on Sunday night Leviticus 20:1 because we've been preaching on the Corinthians series the man sleeping with his stepmom what would happen to that man in the Old Testament and the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness so see uh the husband's uh wife is called his nakedness because that's that's the marriage bed it's referring to that so A man that would uh take his father's wife or stepmother both of them shall be surely put to death their blood shall be upon them so if if that man in Corinth had been in the Old Testament just a few years earlier they had the right to take him out and stone him so in the old Testament you would deliver them to the Believers to Stone them but in the New Testament Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:5 deliver them unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh so the Old Testament the Believers would take care of it in the New Testament God said let Satan take care of it Hallelujah so in one way it seems a little merciful now what what did it say in the New Testament that his soul might be saved so that that in that in itself is more merciful Hallelujah that God will use that to bring that one to repent so he can he or she could get saved hallelujah what a what a striking uh uh difference here in the Old Testament New Testament now let's look at some new uh Testament iniquities as well by God's grace verse uh Matthew 23:25 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but inward you're F of full of extortion and ex excess extortion of course money moneya laundering so they put on an outside show and act it all holy but they're Hypocrites Jesus said you wash the outside but inside you're filthy I appreciate everybody's clean modest clothes but what we want really want is your heart to be clean some of you make your hair so great I try to make mine clean too some of you make your face so shine somebody try to get that shirt just tucked in exactly the tie just just the right length we go to such lengths to make sure everything looks good on the outside God's looking at the inside Hallelujah he wants to make sure everything on the inside's in good order and that we're doing what we say we believe in right nothing's worse than a hypocrite we know that because Jesus said the HP the the Pharisees get greater damnation those that work iniquity right workers of iniquity get worse damnation now this is supposed to be an encouraging message it's coming across a little more rough than I thought you know I wasn't really you know sometimes I think it's going to come happy and then it comes rough sometimes going be rough and it comes happy or joyful that's that's a better word hallelujah now I want to look at this Matthew 24:12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold here's a good indication when someone's living in iniquity they don't they don't have the love they used to have for others and the church said that's what Jesus said it's a clear sign when people live in iniquity they don't have the same love they maybe won't shake their hand like they used to they won't spend much time talking to you like they used to won't text you and try to encourage you or smile at you like they used to Something's Wrong sin has cut off the love of Christ Hallelujah that's a great sign that's why it's so important to love one another Jesus said that's the whole sign you're a Christian amen by this they'll know that they're my disciples because they have love one for another Hallelujah will you find people they just they might cross their arms at you after service just walk away from you won't look won't even shake your hand won't won't won't hug you or nothing like that what is that that's iniquity cutting off the love of God hallelujah everybody see that it's a it's prophecy it's prophecy oh man Hallelujah God knows what he's doing church God knows what he's doing so we can see iniquity is a hard heart it's a heart that doesn't want to turn to God hallelujah so many verses that teach us about uh iniquity I want to look at another iniquity is uh specifically for our days Revelation three about the lukewarm iniquity how many know that's a real thing today think about that church no other age had that said about them except our age lukewarm which just means not hot not cold and hot remembers boiling so let's look let's look at our uh let's look at our spiritual stove today is it boiling Hallelujah do we got the water boiling on the inside Hallelujah it ought to be Hallelujah and if not let's make sure it's that way before we go Hallelujah that's why you came sometimes to get on the stove Hallelujah have the Lord Jesus uh stir you up by God's grace the Bible say stir up your gifts Hallelujah stir up your faith verse uh Revelation three verse 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that ye were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth so uh that's rejected from the body of Christ right if you're in if you're in the body of Christ right you're a part of the body of Christ so this would be like Judas workers of iniquity you're no longer in you're no longer apart you're rejected there it is there's a rejection right uh the reprobate mind rejected lukewarm would of course be doing some works of iniquity and some works of righteousness Jesus said that doesn't work in my body Hallelujah that makes me sick Hallelujah then he says I never knew you right regarding those that did that the workers of iniquity Matthew chapter seven now here here here's a good here's a good uh idea of people's words that are workers of iniquity here's what they say because thou sayest I'm rich and I'm creased with Goods I don't need anything I don't need more of God God can't use that type of person God can't use us if we're going to put our spiritual lives on cruise control right well I've got enough I'm doing fine I'm just going to keep doing what I always do and but in reality you don't right or people will stop doing what they used to do you got to always examine your life and make sure I'm I'm I'm sincere I'm doing what I'm supposed to do praise God hallelujah amen I don't want to become lukewarm I want to uh keep my mind boiling I want to keep the thoughts of God right up here and I want to see the right Works come out of my life as well Glory he spews out the lukewarm they're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing our prayer ought to be tonight Jesus I need you I need you to forgive all my iniquities I need you to heal my body all those uh Psalm 103 verses amen I need all that I need you constantly I need you every day Lord I need you every hour I need you Hallelujah that's right so see this is how you'll know people that are in lukewarm condition that well I don't have time I don't need to go to church I don't need to read my Bible I don't need to go there I don't need to spend more time with God they don't have need of it so they don't they don't do it but we should say I definitely need more of God I'm I'm just aware I'm just daily aware that I need more of Christ in my life Hallelujah that's the lukewarm words I don't need that I don't have to do that I don't need more of the Lord and that's the prosperity trap as we saw in Jeremiah Israel got into that as well and so Jesus says you you you say you don't need anything but you don't even realize you're you're wretched miserable poor blind and naked so these people are in a in a in a deceived condition they don't even realize their spiritual State their iniquity has caused them to re they can't recognize the actual state that they're in they they're blind that Tick Tock makes them uh Fall Away From God they're blind to that they they don't they don't understand that they don't understand that drinking out with the sisters or drinking with the brothers or the boys or the workers and getting drunk they don't understand that these things are making them fall away from God they can't see it they're they're blind miserable wretched Verse 18 but Jesus still gives them counsel Jesus still offers counsel because he's merciful Hallelujah merciful I counsel to to thee of me to buy gold tried in the fire brother ra said that's a a a fir tried character Jesus says you need to purchase this you need to let your faith be tested and trust me through trials then you'll have a gold testimony you have faith like gold that's been tested and tried and all your unbelief and all your struggles are all burned out all your little sins and little uh uh uh what do they call them uh Tendencies and all those sinful Tendencies all your past uh uh you know just just weaknesses they all get burned out and you become a stronger Christian that's right and white rment right reignment is actually the opposite of iniquity white reignment is the righteousness of saints the Saints do what's right and then isav isav of course went on your eyes you can see what is eyesight it's understanding it's spiritual understanding or knowledge so anoint thy eyes with isow that they might might see us your real condition and if you see your real condition you'll be able to accept verse 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen if you really got spiritual eyesight you'll be able to recognize oh the Bible says I'm falling short there then Lord forgive me and help me to obey it next time because he loves me right he don't he won't let me stay the same be zealous therefore and quickly in other words be zealous and and repent so quickly repent Hallelujah and what do you get Church oh yeah verse 20 behold I stand the door and knock If any man hear my voice open the door I'll come in and Su with him and he with me so Jesus is going to eat with you and he's going to tell you some of your good parts he's going to tell you some of your bad Parts because he's got to rebuke you sometimes Hallelujah but to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne brother mam calls this there's no higher compliment he could pay to Holy Ghost filled people the highest compliment is you overcame come sit with me on my judgment Throne there could be no greater compliment than that you overcame leoa so now you're a judge to the world and judge to Angels Hallelujah he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church how many's hearing what the spirit says tonight Hallelujah GE if we're real Christians he'll help us depart from iniquity sins that we know are wrong right and in many cases God has us do that if someone sins against us Jesus said we got to go to them and face them one onone let's pull up these verses uh Matthew 185 and we're going to go down to 20 H so sometimes God think about that sometime God will use you to help somebody correct their iniquity and church usually that's the last thing I want to do it's the last thing you want to do I got to go to that person you keep praying oh God help them to get right help them to get right they don't get right well whose turn is it to go correct them you the Holy Ghost says I want to use you to correct them you're like oh God why I got to do that okay Lord if you say so if you lead me if you guide me moreover If thy brother shall trespass against thee that's another word that's another word for iniquity remember trespass is another word for iniquity go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou shal thou Hast gained thy brother next verse verse 16 but if he will not hear thee then take with thee two one or two more oh one or two you could take okay you can take two praise God you don't have to just go with two you can do two you can do three that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established verse 17 and if he now I'm sorry if he shall neglect to hear them tell it to the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a Publican and then you're going to see it you're going to see it later Paul says just ignore them that they'll be ashamed of themselves is that right okay now go to verse uh go to uh Romans 1617 here's another one now remember Paul would not teach anything different from Jesus so have to see how these tie together I beseech your brethren mark them that cause division so Point them out to the church and offenses contrary to the doctrine or the instruction or the Bible that word means commands too which you have learned and avoid them so there's that they're like a heathen Publican just avoid them don't spend any time with them if someone will trespass against you a child of God part of the body of Christ and won't repent of it God says avoid them don't talk to them oh no what about all that love stuff we're talking about what happened all the 1 Corinthians 13 Love This is Love because that man ought that man or woman ought to be ashamed of themselves for sinning against a Christian another brother and sister and failing to repent of it and and Jesus says I'm going to rebuke you as many as I love if I love you I will rebuke you and what what are you supposed to do uh kind of repent or zealously repent zealously don't hold anything back say oh oh forgive me yes you're right God forgive me I had an evil spirit on me that day or whatever you should be so zealous to repent Jesus said if they don't avoid them that's love because if they really have the Holy Ghost they'll know they've grieved the Holy Ghost they'll be ashamed of themselves and they'll want the Holy Ghost back in their lives if they really got it 1 Thessalonians uh 5:14 now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly see you give them that warning go oneon-one then you take one or two with you warn that are unruly that means insubordinate which means you won't submit to the authority of the church or even the uh your brother or sister anyone that would go against uh the word of God insubordinate won't submit uh the Bible says warn them give them warnings give them one give them two then you tell to the whole church then the whole church is supposed to reach out to them right for what for iniquities they know better someone tells them they don't repent two three people tell them that that's just again more witnesses you're not making it right you need to make it right Hallelujah we always say we want to be the Church of the Living God the book of Acts Church here's the book of Acts church right here Hallelujah remember God even killed Anan and Fus because they lied to the Holy Ghost they lied to Peter that was the book of Acts Church Hallelujah yes now uh 2 Thessalonians 3:6 here's where we see uh more of this idea of there are Heathen and a Publican unto you now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ withdraw yourselves from every brother or sister that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which you received of us hallelujah go to verse 14 will you go down to verse 14 says note that I'm sorry yes and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note him see Mark him let everybody know tell it to the church right because iniquity is in the in the camp note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed not go to hell but be ashamed and repent it's a brother it's a sister Hallelujah so we see this all through the Bible this is how God teaches the church to do loving correction we don't like to do it sometimes but who else is going to do it Church Jesus tells us it's love that causes you to go to a brother or sister to try to correct them that's love have you ever been uh uh face to face with somebody accusing you have sinned against them how about a group of two or three how about a whole church I've never had a whole church I've only had one just one person coming at a time or maybe I guess I've had two I've I've had to I'd say that yes by God's grace but this is how uh this is what happens and see Church iniquity works on people as we said earlier the love that they had for the individual or individuals is gone look at I found this yesterday morning I'm like oh my goodness Lamentations 2:10 now these are Lamentations these are complaints of of Israel because of their iniquity and look at the body language here the Elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and keep silence so they're they're quiet they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth the Verdin of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground so look look at their they're quiet their heads are down remember we talked about self-pity remember we talked about self-pity feeling sorry for yourself what do you it's just like pouting like a baby see this is is what iniquity does this is supposed to be the people of God but the the the sin of iniquity took all their worship out it took all their love out for God and for God's people hallelujah look at Ezra 9:6 and I said oh my God I'm ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my God for our iniquities are increased now Ezra is interceding not for not not maybe for for all his iniquities but for the the iniquities of all the people and his iniquities have made him so ashamed he keeps his head down and he can't even look up to heaven now church when I was a sinner I've told you this before I would sit in the somebody's of God church and I would just sit there with my head down like this when is this going to be over and you better believe I was silent I wasn't singing no worship or anything like can't wait to get out watch the football watch the basketball like this and the Bible said that's a sign of iniquity they hang down their heads silent what what does that iniquity makes you ashamed in the presence of God so you don't worship God you don't love God's people is that right now look look what happened when the people though got on fire in uh Nehemiah 8:6 now verse 10 is a very familiar scripture the joy of the Lord is your strength how many know that that's what we need tonight we need some enjy in our hearts Hallelujah that'll make us strong but but notice when they're having their Revival after the Captivity after their return from captivity through zerubabel here now Ezra Nehemiah and Ezra blessed the Lord the great God and all the people answered what they answer amen amen with lifting up of hands so this is Revival mode before their heads are down their hands are down they're silent but when God starts doing something they lift up their heads they shout amen amen and they praise God God because they're in Revival their iniquities are forgiven Hallelujah same city same people hallelujah Jews God's people hallelujah see what iniquity does cuts off all your praise cuts off all your love look at Psalm 63:3 because thy loving kindness is is better than life my lips shall praise thee so when they come to church they actually praise God and worship God remember before they're silent their iniquities made them silent with heads down won't worship God verse four thus will I bless thee while I live I'll lift up my hands in thy name it's such a victory if you honestly you lift your hands and say God I Surrender I want more of you I'm praising you if you really with a sincere heart you actually say Amen with a sincere heart that's a sign of Revival Hallelujah it is I just showed you how those in iniquity don't have those signs in their lives we all know if you're honest with yourself you ought to say Amen already Hallelujah Psalm 134 verse one a song of degrees behold bless ye the Lord all ye Servants of the Lord which by night stand in the house of the Lord lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the Lord not hang your head down as lamentation said and keep your hands down but actually look up to heaven Lift Your Hands Say Amen worship God praise God why because you're forgiven because you know God's loving kindness has forgiven you and you're not walking in iniquity you're walking in the Purity the Integrity the righteousness of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm almost done it's already 8 o' it go so fast hallelujah how many enjoying the word tonight amen hallelujah it's a blessing it's a blessing to know that we always depart from iniquity once God shows us it might take every time it's a little different you know but as as soon as possible we should depart from iniquity say God don't let me go back there again don't let me walk down that road of iniquity again let me go in the way of everlasting Hallelujah let me stay on the narrow road Hallelujah I don't want to go back there don't God don't let me go back there but see workers iniquity they just right go right on that path they just keep you you you try to you know one at a time you try to talk them out of it they just keep on going then you take two or three hey please turn around they just keep on going just right walking right into it and then while they're walking they don't love nobody right nobody that they ought to love right right right here in the scripture the love of Jesus Christ will make you try to correct somebody if you really love them Hallelujah that's what God's love does glory I'm saving it for my punchline here we ready for the ending here by God's grace I've been building up all this Doom and Gloom to try to bring it down here by God's grace so the question comes to the end how do we overcome iniquity Psalm 11957 Thou Art my portion oh Lord I have said that I would keep thy words verse 58 I intreated thy favor with my whole heart see you got to put your whole heart into it God let your blessing be on me let your Spirit be on me with everything I got be merciful unto me according to Thy word here it is verse 59 brother preaches numerous times from from that time on I thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies how do we overcome iniquity we we recognize the path we're going the path of Disobedience we recognize we're on the wrong path and we think about God's word and we turn our direction we repent and go the other way and walk in the the path of obedience look at verse 60 he didn't wait a whole week he didn't wait a month to get right he said I made haste and delayed not to keep that Commandments Amen in other words as soon as I got out of church I made it right how much more if one if a brother comes you and a sister comes you and says you sin against them how how much more should you quickly make it right as soon as possible but some people they'll be rebuked I say no no I didn't do that keep going and they keep going headl WR that way that's not the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ is I'm going to quickly make this right I'm going to quickly make sure my brother or sister knows that I love them hallelujah hallelujah that's right Ezekiel 18:30 therefore will I judge you oh House of Israel everyone according to his ways sayith the Lord I'm sorry Lord God repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin see what iniquity does it makes somebody ruin their whole life like I said with some of my family members I've seen them ruin Decades of their lives but some people ruin lives for a week or a month or or six months or a year or two years or three they ruin entire lives but God is able to rescue them if they're able to turn back to the righteous path Hallelujah so we're singing about the Lord is my shepherd see what iniquity does it ruins a life it ruins a testimony but we will not be the workers of iniquity verse 31 Cast Away all your transgressions just throw your bad habits and your your desires and your sins and your your pride or or or or lust or bitterness or whatever may be uh Throw It cast it away from you don't don't hang on to it cast it away from you whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart does that sound familiar a new heart and a new spirit Hallelujah you make it you see but you can't get a new heart and spirit until you cast away the old the old sin the iniquity God's not going to give you a new heart or new spirit while people hold on to sin and iniquities for why will you die oh House of Israel for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth sayith the Lord God wherefore turn yourselves and live turn from the the path of iniquity and walk in the narrow road of obedience Glory so true but church we realize the power of Jesus Christ is present in our lives and it's hard to calculate how much this means to us but acts 3:26 gives us a good Insight in here unto you first God having raised up his son Jesus Christ sent him to bless you how did how did how did Jesus bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities look at this great blessing Jes Jesus Christ came he died he rose he sent his Spirit and the blessing is that God takes you off of your path of self-destruction and puts you on the path of Eternal Redemption hallelujah amen what a blessing Hallelujah that was the blessing the blessing was to turn you from your self-destructive path of hating self hating God to turn you to love God love God's people love the way of life and receive eternal life Hallelujah this is the blessing of Jesus Christ this is why if you have the spirit of Christ you won't be in iniquity too long till the Lord Jesus Christ corrects you I just want to share this testimony this kind of came to my mind here U there's a brother that was emailing me this week he's way older than me I think he's I shouldn't say way older he's in his 60s I'm almost 50 by God's grace but he said when he got married he didn't know the message and I just want to I want you look at the patience and look at the respect for the word of God this man could have easily went in iniquity he said from a right after he got saved he you know he married a unbeliever they're both unbelievers he got saved received the message got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he says I know I'm called to preach now think about this he's 20 he's know he's called to preach but he's got an unbelieving spouse he could have said I don't care what they what those churches say I'm going to go to church where I can preach because I know I'm called to preach you know what he did he waited on God waited on God and he let he just waited on God for decades and there was something else that happened in there I'm not sure exactly what happened but he waited until uh uh you know and then oh yeah then his wife never turned to Christ so all these decades he was dealing with his wife wouldn't accept the message wouldn't accept Christ I know I'm called to preach I know I'm called to preach and all these Temptations and he knew like and even his Pastor died and and he knew his Pastor would have let him take over even in that marriage situation another temptation to try to just do iniquity just do whatever you want to do and don't care about the word of God he said but then God moved him to different places and then finally he said and this he wasn't praying for his wife to pass away but his wife eventually passed away and he's in his 60s and now finally he can start preaching and he's traveling overseas seeing missionary work people saved heal healed filled with the Holy Ghost but God was testing him not for one year not for two years but for decades 40 years God was testing him saying are you going to stay in the truth or you're going to walk in the path here here's the path if you want to go which way you going to choose and he said now God give him a wonderful wife a believing wife now but he had to wait 40 years are we willing to wait 40 years on God see Satan makes the path of iniquity look so much better oh well I know I I know this and I know that I would do that I would do that but God wants your obedience God wants your your righteousness and not your unrighteousness I thought that was a beautiful testimony 40 years and now he's finally in the 60s now he's finally traveling overseas with these brothers taking the message books to Nations that don't have it I mean it's just a beautiful me beautiful testimony able to wait on God Lord I love you I and and then he he emails me about all these different doctrines that we see eye to eye on it and all these years he's had the Holy Ghost since he was 20 and waiting 40 years the Bible said wait upon your ministering amen hallelujah he'd rather wait wait and suffer and suffer in a very hard relationship he'd rather wait on that and trust God Hallelujah for God's timing rather than trust in feelings and run after this and opportunities and opportunities right it's test is what they're called they're called tests Sor I'd share that it was a great testimony to me this week I'm like oh my goodness waiting 40 years before God waiting 40 years so God can you can finally feel like God's really using me let's wait on the Lord the Bible said if you wait you'll renew your strength you renew your strength when you wait on God like I told that I told another brother I said never push your way yeah I told a man on the email he feels led to preach I said you'll never have to push your way into anything if if it's God's will I never had to push anybody to be Pastor I never I've never asked to preach anywhere I've never had to do anything God if God's in it God will open the door at the right time won't have to divide a church or steal ties or you know like people do with churches starting churches and all this nonsense he won't do any of that if God's really called you you'll be able to keep the word and then God will provide for you Hallelujah if he's called you to do something he'll make a way for you to do it praise God God won't lead you into iniquity Hallelujah I'm closing with these last few things here I got a couple more things here thatat your perfect man brother Ram says we have to die to ourselves he said in order uh to have the Life of Christ and he Compares it to embalming how many you been to a funeral lately what's inside that body embalming fluid brother says the trouble is he and he Compares that to you and I think about that he Compares us to being dead bodies and we got to be filled with God's spirit but brother says but the thing of it is we don't get the embalming fluid so the people rot away just just a one type and brother's comparing that to the Holy Ghost we've got to die out to ourselves and we got to let God fill us he says with those attributes right there did anybody notice this as as I left Su I'm like that's right brother R said and I had Wendy put these on here these little everybody see this little word Eden you see that little word what's h s spell his let's give her two class got ready for some more Bible studies here it's his faith it's his virtue vir it's his know kind of was refreshing me like that's right when you get God's spirit it's no it's not even your ability it's all his ability when I got faith to believe brother Chris and and finally become a Christian it wasn't hard to go be baptized because I had his faith Hallelujah I had the faith of Jesus Christ I could go be baptized that's why I told my older children I said if you ever feel led to be re-baptized again I said you'll you'll know when it's because you'll know because go it'll be God in you it'll be Christ faith in you Hallelujah and nobody can keep you from those Waters Hallelujah and I I admire our children uh being baptized at such young ages but then as they get older they go through trials that they never went through before but see I went through all those trials before I was a real believer and they've got to go through them and they want to make sure their testimonies are sincere that's that's that's wonderful that that's lovely uh that's admirable and you want to know and how do you know because you know something is filled me amen hallelujah something something has anointed me something has empowered me it's not my faith it's not my virtue it's not my knowledge it's Christ's Faith Christ virtue Christ knowledge Christ has given me Temperance I didn't have his self-control but now I got it but it's not mine it's all Jesus's Hallelujah that's the blessing of God he gives me his anointing to keep the word of God brother bam says he says if you die take the blood out of a man you embalm him the troubled is a lot of them never got embalmed he's talking about the spirit of God filling a man you take the blood out of a man he's gone then the only thing you you do is put another uh blood back in him he's going to live again you took his blood out blood transfusion and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in and it brings the faith of Jesus Christ it brings the virtue of Jesus Christ did you know that when you're a Christian you don't have your faith you have the faith of Jesus Christ Hallelujah if you're you're really serving God you have real Faith because it's not your faith it's the faith of the Son of God Paul says in Galatians you get the knowledge of Jesus Christ you get the temperance of Jesus Christ you get the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ see that's why you can treat your brother and sister in the right way because you have Christ kindness glory and the love of God he says which is Jesus Christ my goodness Hallelujah so you get all these attributes of Christ and then you get Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Capstone he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation Faith he says amen controlled by the head there you are there's the perfect Mana of God when he possesses these virtues or these attributes Hallelujah so that's what we want church we want the Faith of Christ The Virtue and as I said on on on Sunday if you're struggling with patience say just just talk to God and say God I don't have the patience I need your patience recognize the difference my patience won't be enough to get through this like that brother a human patience couldn't wait 40 years that's why he need the patience of Jesus Christ amen and he got it and now he's obeying the word and God's blessing his life as a beautiful testimony of the patience of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Church each one of those the Bible says we have treasure in Earth and vessels in 2 Corinthians I believe it's chapter 3 each one of these is a treasure when you have the Faith of Christ that's a treasure and see you just get more treasure more anointing more power of God as you go until God caps it off and you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and then you have then you you have all that in there you got to renew it every day but it's in there there's a portion of it and you'll realize it's not my ability it's not my power it's got to be the power of Christ Hallelujah now how do you build it back up the Bible said hear the word and pray I go to Jude chapter one building up your Most Holy Faith that's why Church brother B talked about praying through how many you heard of praying through before other you got to pray through the unbelief until you feel the faith Rising brother man says pray until building up your Most Holy Faith I think it's Jude 1:20 honey I could be wrong that's just on memory yeah but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost so if we see ourselves short today on any of these if you know you're supposed to go correct a brother or sister but you don't have the you don't have enough of this you got to pray and say God fill me with your brotherly kindness so I can go correct that brother and go correct that sister because it can't be yours it's got to be Christ's if Jesus was would here Jesus would correct him if Jesus was here Jesus would correct her there's only two genders thank God president Trump knows that our current president said there's thousands of genders Church in any area over there any area you see your lacking you should come up to the altar you should get on your seat tonight and say God I don't have it give me yours amen or I've just got a little bit give me more Hallelujah pray until you feel empowered that's what the Bible says pray till you need the faith pray I'm sorry till you got the faith pray till you got the temperance of the patience pray till you have that godliness where you can love the unlovable Build It Up Everybody understand in other words God give me that embalming fluid that Eternal embalming fluid now let me be dead and let Christ live in me Hallelujah glory and as I said on Sunday Ezekiel 36 he gives you a new heart new spirit my spirit now what was my spirit he said I'm going to write the word of God on the fleshly tables of your heart see when we really love Jesus we say Jesus Come into my heart don't just come in and eat with me come in and then after supper take some time and start writing your word on my heart acts 238 just write it right there repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall let's say shall ready shall you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost write it on my heart I know I'll get it I know he's with me he he promised me Hallelujah write it on my heart Hallelujah so it doesn't leave it doesn't fly away it's a part of me Hallelujah the word and I have become one Hallelujah I'm one with the word because the word is on my heart Hallelujah he wrote it there when we had Fellowship Hallelujah he wrote he put that brotherly kindness right in there in my heart I know I got it that's what he does and church and then then Jesus will say I know you see the workers of iniquity they never let Jesus do that so Jesus said I never knew you you never let me come in and take some time and and just write all my word upon the fleshly tables they never open themselves up they would just try to do some Miracles right they would actually get in the the spirit but then they run off in in on their path of iniquity but Jesus said I never knew you but he's supposed to know us because he writes his word on the fleshly tables of our heart and if he writes his word on our heart then the Bible says uh Thy word have i hidden in my heart that I might not sin against God I might not walk in the path of iniquity I think it's Psalm 11911 if I'm not mistaken Hallelujah write it on my heart so I don't sin I don't go in iniquity against you and whatever attribute whatever strength you need whatever power you need pray until you feel it Hallelujah that's why I told you when I go in the barber I know there I just put my hand out I just start praying I pray until I I'm ready to go in there by God's grace last verse Galatians 49 I'm going way longer than I thought Galatians 4:9 that's how it always is Galatians 4:9 but now after that ye have known God or rather are known of God see Church in in the in the final say of this in all reality who knows which one better do we know God better or does God know us better
