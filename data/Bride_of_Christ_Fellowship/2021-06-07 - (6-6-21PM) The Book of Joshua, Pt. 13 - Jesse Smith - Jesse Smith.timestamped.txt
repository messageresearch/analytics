[23:16] saint said amen god bless you let's take
[23:19] our bibles here
[23:21] let's go to hebrews 11 here
[23:24] i think we'll start there in hebrews 11
[23:25] by the grace of the lord
[23:30] we'll try to look at this thought i want
[23:32] to keep going in joshua
[23:36] hebrews 11 30. let's read that one
[23:54] hebrews 11 30.
[23:57] all right i'm gonna try to set a timer
[24:00] here i'll try to just preach an hour
[24:02] we'll see how the holy spirit moves but
[24:04] we want to just be sensitive to the time
[24:06] hebrews 11 30. let's read that one
[24:08] together can we
[24:09] on three one two three by faith the
[24:12] walls of
[24:13] jericho fell down after they were
[24:16] compassed about
[24:17] seven days amen may goddess blessings of
[24:20] the remus word
[24:21] may be seated praise god i want to just
[24:24] pick up there where we left off and
[24:25] i don't have any slides i didn't have
[24:27] really time to prepare those
[24:29] um because there was so much going on um
[24:32] but i want to pick up there and preach
[24:34] on that
[24:36] uh about crossing over this morning uh
[24:39] but amen i'll just background a little
[24:40] bit for you buddy
[24:42] uh we basically looked at the iniquity
[24:44] of the amorites
[24:46] and we saw how uh 462 years before
[24:50] joshua and moses started driving them
[24:52] out
[24:54] god had given them all that time to
[24:56] repent god knew they were going to
[24:58] backslide into iniquity
[25:00] and uh god gave them all that time
[25:03] but leviticus chapters 18 19 and 20
[25:06] detail all their sins the reason god
[25:10] spewed them out of the land was mostly
[25:12] sexual sins and then idolatry
[25:15] um there's all kinds of other ones here
[25:18] i
[25:18] should just look at my notes just trying
[25:20] to go off memory oh witchcraft abortion
[25:23] cursing parents
[25:26] and all all those all just any sin any
[25:29] abominable sin
[25:30] in you could imagine and so
[25:33] then we we looked at that we looked at
[25:35] amorites then we saw how the cup of
[25:37] america's iniquities filling up
[25:39] and we just looked at how brother
[25:41] branham said uh america's on a downward
[25:44] angle we saw her position in revelation
[25:46] 13.
[25:47] brother braham says thus saith the lord
[25:49] uh that the persecution
[25:52] from the days of pagan rome will be
[25:55] repeated when the mark of the beast is
[25:56] laid down he said it'll be repeated thus
[25:58] saith the lord
[26:00] uh in the united states that was in 1958
[26:02] he said that
[26:03] then we saw some false prophets i went
[26:05] through sid roth i
[26:06] i respect the man but i really want him
[26:08] to repent but he's a false prophet you
[26:10] know he
[26:11] missed he false prophesied all those
[26:12] things about chronovirus trump and
[26:14] everything else well now he's predicting
[26:16] uh the greatest revival in history for
[26:19] 2021
[26:20] where people will be they'll have to put
[26:22] masks back on because of the glory of
[26:24] god
[26:25] like moses that's what he's that's what
[26:26] he's already predicted that the lord
[26:28] told him that
[26:29] so what we found is that lying people
[26:31] just keep lying
[26:32] if they won't repent they just they go
[26:34] deeper into iniquity right just like the
[26:36] amorites
[26:37] if they won't repent they just go deeper
[26:39] and deeper iniquity
[26:40] but thank god we go from faith to faith
[26:43] from glory to glory praise god
[26:45] that's a real christian and so we're
[26:47] we're striving
[26:48] to go along that r that route and then i
[26:51] just ended with a little story from
[26:53] iowa and i probably won't go into too
[26:55] much detail because we're on live stream
[26:56] that maybe i'll share at the end
[26:58] but just about how god can heal god
[27:00] wants to get into our dark places of our
[27:02] lives
[27:03] and he wants his light to shine in there
[27:06] uh
[27:06] and bring healing so i just kind of
[27:09] generally speak it like that cause i
[27:11] don't like when the things are really
[27:12] personal i'm not trying to try to use it
[27:14] as much as i can if god would help me uh
[27:18] so
[27:18] we'll look here tonight let's look at uh
[27:20] across or
[27:22] the walls falling down because we saw
[27:24] that in hebrews 11
[27:25] 30. church what was the key word about
[27:29] the walls falling down by what by
[27:32] faith they fell down this is the faith
[27:34] chapter
[27:36] right and faith is in the greek it's
[27:39] defined as
[27:40] assurance or trust but we know it as a
[27:43] little deeper
[27:44] uh understanding we know it as
[27:46] revelation
[27:48] right because the reason you can trust
[27:50] and have assurance is because god has
[27:52] revealed to you what's going to happen
[27:55] right the reason they had faith the
[27:57] walls were going to come down was
[27:58] because the angel lord had told them the
[28:00] walls were going to come down
[28:02] and everything he'd said had already
[28:04] come to pass
[28:05] right they come through the the they
[28:07] come through the jordan river just like
[28:09] the angel said
[28:10] right they come through the red sea just
[28:12] like the angel said they got water from
[28:14] the rock
[28:14] just like the angel said so in other
[28:16] words we have to
[28:18] differentiate between faith and hope
[28:20] hope is what we think will happen
[28:22] but faith is what we know is going to
[28:24] happen amen and so a lot of times we
[28:27] just have to be honest and say we're
[28:28] operating by hope
[28:30] right because most of us don't go around
[28:31] all the time well i know thus saith the
[28:33] lord exactly what's going to happen well
[28:35] we don't know
[28:35] in many cases we don't know how long you
[28:38] know we're going to be sick or we don't
[28:39] know how long
[28:41] our lost loved one is going to be lost
[28:42] we don't know we don't know how long
[28:44] it's going to be till they're saved
[28:45] unless god will give us a revelation on
[28:47] that
[28:47] but we know those are few and far
[28:49] between right because
[28:51] to do that you have to be a prophet
[28:54] right
[28:54] you have to be a prophet but that's a
[28:56] special gift that gets uh
[28:58] used at special times okay but
[29:01] so let's just look at that thought now
[29:03] by faith
[29:04] the walls of jericho fell down after
[29:07] they were
[29:08] compassed about seven days when they
[29:10] fall down
[29:11] after the people acted upon the word
[29:15] right so we see remember from hebrews
[29:17] hebrews 10 the bible says
[29:19] we must be followers of them who inherit
[29:21] the promises
[29:23] right but first they must have patience
[29:25] and then they inherit the promise
[29:27] praise god so that that's always the
[29:30] order god gives us the word
[29:31] we show patience the word comes to pass
[29:34] amen
[29:35] amen so promise patience and then the
[29:37] fulfillment praise god
[29:39] that's exactly what happened with
[29:40] jericho that's exactly
[29:42] what happens in our lives and i told the
[29:44] testimony
[29:45] um my niece emma i saw her last week at
[29:48] cam church
[29:49] and she said i just want to tell you
[29:50] your dad hasn't smoked a cigarette for
[29:52] five days
[29:53] so brother that's like a that's a little
[29:55] victory for us because he's been smoking
[29:56] for over 50 years
[29:58] so i just want to i want to thank the
[29:59] lord for that praise god all these
[30:01] prayers and i've been praying since i
[30:02] was a boy
[30:03] so that was i've been praying over 30
[30:05] years that god would help my dad to quit
[30:06] smoking so i'm i believe
[30:09] i'm saying i'm speaking the things that
[30:11] are not as though they are
[30:13] my dad doesn't smoke anymore
[30:17] i'm speaking those things that are not
[30:19] as though they are
[30:20] right my parents though their divorce my
[30:23] parents are getting back together
[30:25] god's going to heal their marriage now i
[30:28] don't have a revelation of that but i'm
[30:30] speaking it by hope
[30:32] right and i'm trusting that god my faith
[30:35] is god can do it i don't know that he's
[30:36] gonna do it but that's my
[30:38] confidence in god my hope in god that he
[30:41] will do it
[30:41] so i'm calling those things that i
[30:43] prayed for i'm calling those things that
[30:45] are not as though they are
[30:47] so i was a great testimony i was really
[30:49] encouraged by that because i've been
[30:50] praying for that over 30 years
[30:52] so i'm just going to trust that the lord
[30:53] will finish what he started so saints
[30:55] faith brings walls down
[30:58] faith will bring down every obstacle
[31:00] remember the bible says
[31:02] we overcome by faith the bible says
[31:06] praise god that's i believe in the book
[31:07] of uh first john
[31:09] uh our victory is even our faith yeah
[31:11] let me pull that up there
[31:13] uh so we can uh so we can read it right
[31:15] out of the scripture
[31:18] some of these i don't have memorized so
[31:20] bear with me i have to search them in
[31:21] the dictionary real quick here or the
[31:22] lexicon
[31:23] first john 5 4 for who i'm sorry for
[31:26] whatsoever is born of god
[31:28] overcometh the world and this is the
[31:31] victory
[31:32] that overcometh the world even our faith
[31:36] hallelujah so anyone who overcomes you
[31:38] know lust and adultery
[31:40] and and and bitterness and and uh lust
[31:43] and
[31:44] and greed all these temptations anyone
[31:46] who overcomes that
[31:48] overcomes by jesus's faith praise god
[31:51] hallelujah so that's an anointing right
[31:53] you are anointed with the faith of
[31:55] christ
[31:56] uh paul said i don't do this by my faith
[31:58] but he said this life
[32:00] i live i now live by the faith of the
[32:02] son of god
[32:03] who gave his life for me and died for me
[32:06] praise god
[32:07] we're living by jesus faith right now
[32:09] praise god
[32:10] i'm an overcomer in the satan's eden
[32:12] right now by jesus's faith praise god
[32:15] hallelujah that's how i'm overcoming the
[32:17] world is the faith of god
[32:20] because i'm born of god and through the
[32:22] the holy spirit in me
[32:23] i overcome the world praise god
[32:27] hallelujah now i want to read this one
[32:30] um for our brother mj and maybe for the
[32:33] children here so we go to john chapter
[32:34] 7.
[32:35] i just want to lay this thought in here
[32:36] that the old testament saints could not
[32:38] have the full baptism of the holy ghost
[32:41] until the blood of jesus was shed that
[32:44] shouldn't be a surprise to many of us
[32:46] and i don't know if it is to you or not
[32:48] but for example david
[32:49] david overcome goliath but then he fell
[32:51] into adultery
[32:53] that's because he didn't have the
[32:54] baptism of the holy ghost they got every
[32:56] the believers got the baptism of the
[32:58] holy ghost on the day of pentecost
[33:00] and then they didn't do those things
[33:02] they didn't you know you never see paul
[33:04] and peter committing adultery
[33:06] right or getting drunk like noah so
[33:08] while we can gain
[33:10] we can gain uh courage from the old
[33:12] testament saints but at some point we
[33:14] have to say
[33:15] we have access to more power than what
[33:17] they had
[33:18] yes right because david fell to adultery
[33:22] david
[33:22] was a murderer right
[33:25] but now that the holy ghost is here now
[33:28] we overcome the world
[33:29] because we're born of god amen
[33:32] hallelujah praise god that's right
[33:34] there had to be a difference between the
[33:35] old and new testament the difference was
[33:37] a new covenant he said i'll give you my
[33:40] spirit praise god hallelujah
[33:41] ezekiel 36 records it very well i'll
[33:44] give you a new heart
[33:45] a new spirit and then my spirit praise
[33:47] god
[33:48] the three works of grace justification
[33:50] same the baptism of the holy ghost
[33:53] let's read that here because that'll be
[33:55] a good help to us as we go along
[33:57] uh john 7 37
[34:01] and i got any uh teenage readers back
[34:03] there
[34:04] notice i said teenagers my teenage
[34:07] children
[34:08] lydia and malachi lydia can you read uh
[34:11] 37 and 38 and then maokai read 39.
[34:26] wonderful let's stop right there this is
[34:28] before jesus is crucified right
[34:31] and he's already saying come to me and
[34:32] get the holy ghost but look at verse 39
[34:35] he's giving them a little bit of a he's
[34:38] giving them an invitation
[34:40] early to let him know that they keep
[34:42] following him they will get the holy
[34:43] ghost they will get the living water
[34:45] right because look at verse 39 malachi
[34:47] could read that
[34:56] all right that's a great lesson most
[34:58] churches can't catch that brother mj i'm
[34:59] not sure
[35:00] how much you've heard about that but
[35:02] most people believe mj when you believe
[35:04] you fill with the power of god that's
[35:05] not true because when i first believed i
[35:07] didn't have hardly
[35:08] any power to do many things i couldn't
[35:11] overcome the cussing
[35:12] and the dirty magazines and the movies i
[35:14] couldn't overcome them yet because i
[35:16] didn't have enough power
[35:17] i was just saved but then as i got
[35:20] closer to god he gives you more and more
[35:22] anointings like peter said that's what
[35:23] that
[35:24] picture is over there by the mj he gives
[35:25] you anointing of faith and virtue the
[35:27] knowledge that's right on
[35:28] second peter chapter one he gives you
[35:31] all those powers and then charity is
[35:32] love and god is love and god is the holy
[35:34] ghost so that
[35:35] that last anointing is charity that's
[35:37] the baptism of the holy ghost so
[35:39] that's how we teach it here uh because
[35:41] when after i got saved i still smoked a
[35:43] little bit i still chewed a little bit
[35:44] of tobacco you know
[35:46] still said some words i should not have
[35:48] said but as i went along god gave me
[35:51] more and more power
[35:52] he was building me up in the grace of
[35:54] god amen
[35:55] and that's where most churches miss it
[35:57] they tell people oh you've got
[35:59] you'll do greater works than jesus
[36:00] that's that's impossible
[36:02] nobody can do greater works than jesus
[36:04] they just misunderstand the scripture
[36:06] right john 14 12 says greater works that
[36:08] will ye do because i go to my father
[36:10] he wasn't saying greater miracles he
[36:12] meant more miracles
[36:14] right if you can do a greater work than
[36:16] walk on water and heal people while
[36:18] you're walking on water
[36:19] do some and then create food while
[36:21] you're walking on water if you can do a
[36:22] greater miracle
[36:23] who's going to do that nobody can do
[36:25] that because that's not what jesus meant
[36:27] jesus met the holy ghost will be in
[36:29] every all these believer's souls so more
[36:31] miracles will be done praise god
[36:33] amen and don't be discouraged church the
[36:36] book of acts was written over 30 years
[36:38] so all those miracles
[36:39] are spread out over 30 years we read it
[36:41] like oh it's
[36:42] every day was a miracle every day was
[36:44] not a miracle
[36:46] right so don't be discouraged did you
[36:48] know on one of those days there was an
[36:49] argument between the
[36:50] the widow grecians remember that
[36:54] this day there was no miracles there was
[36:56] arguing well we're getting
[36:58] we're not getting as much daily bread as
[36:59] the jewish women what's wrong
[37:01] and so what they do they had a little
[37:02] meeting we got to have some deacons here
[37:06] right the preachers got to focus on
[37:08] prayer and the word but we got to have
[37:10] men that will give these
[37:11] grecian widows their daily bread they're
[37:13] not getting their daily portions
[37:16] so that day was no miracle other than
[37:17] the miracle of humbling them
[37:19] i guess you could kind of joke around
[37:20] and say it was a a miracle of humility
[37:24] but these are spread out over over 30
[37:26] years
[37:27] right the book of acts church right
[37:30] there was great miracles
[37:31] but there's also learning just learning
[37:33] how to love one another
[37:35] learning that we need deacons right we
[37:38] need preachers we need prayer warriors
[37:40] amen
[37:42] we need people that will make clothes
[37:43] for people like tabitha dorcas right
[37:45] she made clothes we need people in the
[37:47] clothes ministry
[37:49] right clothing the the the naked or the
[37:52] poor
[37:52] we need people that'll feed the poor
[37:54] praise god we need all these ministries
[37:57] and that's where that book is spread out
[37:58] over 30 years
[37:59] so church let me say it like this we're
[38:01] a part of the book of acts church praise
[38:02] god
[38:03] there's healings we're helping the sick
[38:05] and praying for the sick helping the
[38:06] poor in our little ways that we do it
[38:08] we're building up we're teaching we're
[38:10] training we're people are getting the
[38:12] holy ghost amen
[38:13] people being filled with the holy ghost
[38:15] we're a part of that book of acts church
[38:17] so let's do our part well praise god all
[38:19] that god's calling us to do
[38:21] let's not shirk any responsibility let's
[38:23] meet every responsibility
[38:25] like i was telling the mj if we just
[38:26] seek to seek the lord first
[38:28] everything else will be added enough
[38:30] praise god that's all we have to do just
[38:32] put god first put him first every day
[38:35] and everything else he'll work it out
[38:36] he'll lead you and guide you praise god
[38:39] nothing to worry about there's no worry
[38:40] here praise god
[38:42] paul said don't be anxious for anything
[38:44] amen
[38:46] see that's why you can relax put god
[38:47] first relax the holy spirit's gonna just
[38:49] direct the rest of your day praise god
[38:51] that's what i've seen i've just been
[38:53] serving god now what 21 years so
[38:54] that's what i've seen in my 21 years is
[38:57] that the lord works out everything
[38:59] if we just put him first okay so i hope
[39:02] that helps
[39:04] oh yeah there it is very very saying to
[39:05] you he that believeth on me the works
[39:07] that i do shall you do also
[39:08] greater works than these shall he do
[39:09] because i go to my father nobody can do
[39:11] greater works than jesus
[39:12] i've still never seen anybody uh take
[39:15] mud rub them in a man who
[39:16] has no eyes and make eyes show me
[39:18] somebody that could ever do that
[39:19] they can't do that nobody can do greater
[39:21] than jesus it means more
[39:23] right means more now let's get back to
[39:26] jericho
[39:26] by faith the walls of jericho fell down
[39:30] so see church that their faith made them
[39:33] obey every command from the holy spirit
[39:36] then the walls finally came down
[39:39] can i say like this they had to wait a
[39:41] whole week until they saw the answer to
[39:42] their requests
[39:44] so let's not discourage let's not be
[39:45] discouraging if we have to wait a few
[39:46] days
[39:48] or a few weeks or a few years right
[39:50] let's not be discouraged
[39:51] let's have faith praise god they had to
[39:54] obey
[39:55] all the word until the walls came down
[39:59] they couldn't break it they couldn't
[40:00] they couldn't get tired on god
[40:03] amen they had to keep that word and then
[40:06] the walls came down
[40:08] praise god so remember let's go back to
[40:10] galatians 5 6. can you pull up there
[40:12] galatians 5 6. i just want to reiterate
[40:14] this
[40:15] faith will always follow the word
[40:19] or the directions of the word
[40:22] so this is such a beautiful scripture
[40:24] this has helped me so much in my walk
[40:25] with god
[40:26] when my works get cold i realize i've
[40:29] got to go renew my love
[40:32] because works flow out of faith but
[40:35] faith
[40:36] flows out of love so because the bible
[40:39] says
[40:39] faith works by love
[40:43] so the right order is love faith works
[40:46] that's the right order
[40:48] right if we really love god then our
[40:50] faith will be built up
[40:52] and then we'll want to work for god
[40:54] that's what paul says
[40:55] faith only works by love so our only
[40:58] motivation to work and help the poor
[41:00] give him clothes or give him money or
[41:01] praying fast the our only motivation for
[41:04] that is our love for god
[41:06] it's not fear it's love praise god amen
[41:09] right because god has not given us a
[41:11] spirit of fear but a power
[41:13] and love and a sound mind amen
[41:17] love is motivating us skipping meals
[41:19] right love motivates us to pray this
[41:21] pray for the sick and get the prayer
[41:22] cloth out love motivates because we love
[41:25] god and we know god loves us
[41:26] amen that's right
[41:31] see so by faith the walls of jericho
[41:33] went down to see because they loved god
[41:36] they had faith and then they went to
[41:37] work
[41:39] now history says they had to march 30
[41:41] minutes around that jericho
[41:43] compound there's a 30-minute walk every
[41:46] day right and they were silent those
[41:48] first six days let's go let's read that
[41:50] now let's go to
[41:51] joshua 6. just to kind of get an idea
[41:55] beautiful story
[41:59] a church there's something walking
[42:00] around sometimes god will honor people's
[42:02] faith like this
[42:03] let me just while you're turning there
[42:04] let's let me tell this testimony when we
[42:06] were growing up my mom and dad were
[42:07] divorced
[42:08] you know that across the street was a
[42:10] bar
[42:11] and it was really loud especially on
[42:12] friday and saturday nights well we have
[42:14] church on sunday
[42:16] but mj my mom got she got so moved she's
[42:19] like she would call the cops and be like
[42:20] we're trying to get my teenagers to bed
[42:22] we have church in the morning and the
[42:24] bar would open up their doors and you
[42:25] can hear the rock and roll i remember i
[42:27] couldn't even sleep many times
[42:28] so my mom said i'm doing like a jericho
[42:30] march
[42:31] she she went around that bar and walked
[42:33] around that barf
[42:34] for weeks and weeks and they finally
[42:36] shut down the bar
[42:38] they broke some laws and so the the cops
[42:40] found out they broke some laws in the
[42:42] back they shut them down
[42:44] now they opened back up a year later my
[42:46] mom went around
[42:47] and then they and then the cops would
[42:48] come around and force them to shut the
[42:50] door so we could sleep
[42:51] so in other words it was no longer a
[42:53] problem because that's how my mom could
[42:56] pray you know she didn't have a husband
[42:57] so
[42:58] and i remember her i would physically
[43:00] see her walk out in the morning
[43:02] and walk around the barn just lay hands
[43:04] on the bar and pray
[43:05] and say this this bar is going to close
[43:07] this bar is going to close their door
[43:09] my children are going to get sleep
[43:12] that's a pretty good to me that was a
[43:13] great testimony just as a child
[43:15] oh yeah and then my mama my brother cam
[43:18] got hurt in track and field we were on
[43:19] the we were on the relay team the four
[43:21] by one we did the four by one
[43:23] his senior year he got hurt he tore
[43:26] his was it ace mcl mcl because it wasn't
[43:29] an acl mcl
[43:30] acl will knock you out for good you know
[43:32] at least for a year
[43:34] she had he had an mcl tear
[43:37] you know what my mom did cam really
[43:38] wanted to run his senior year i think he
[43:40] he heard it in uh november and so track
[43:43] was coming around
[43:44] he needed to be healed so he could run
[43:46] track his senior year
[43:48] usually they take like six to eight
[43:49] months my mom and him
[43:51] walked around the track in the snow
[43:54] praying
[43:55] like it was like a jericho march it's a
[43:57] 400 meter
[43:58] for a track is 400 meters so they would
[44:00] walk i forget how many laps they would
[44:01] do
[44:02] but cam and you could ask cam this day
[44:04] cam said while they were walking cam
[44:06] had shorts on by the way which we don't
[44:08] believe in shorts
[44:09] because they're immodest right they show
[44:10] off your your nakedness
[44:12] cam had shorts on he had a brace on and
[44:15] he said i
[44:16] felt the burning sensation of the holy
[44:18] ghost healing my leg
[44:19] and cam ran his senior year we set this
[44:23] we set the school record in the 4x1
[44:25] because god healed his mcl early
[44:28] now don't tell me god don't honor faith
[44:29] church
[44:32] see that's two that's two examples of
[44:33] walking so there's something with
[44:35] praying and walking i'm not making a
[44:36] doctrine
[44:37] i'm just telling you people will take
[44:39] inspiration from the word of god
[44:41] in other words they just pray more can i
[44:43] just say like that
[44:44] hallelujah they just put some action to
[44:47] their faith praise god
[44:49] they just work based upon the faith
[44:51] praise god
[44:53] i heard a preacher tell a story and he
[44:56] said every time his dad would leave on a
[44:57] missionary trip
[44:58] the kids would get sick and he's like
[44:59] i'm tired of this every time i go my
[45:01] kids get sick
[45:02] he said he took his dad took all the
[45:04] kids around the perimeter
[45:06] of their uh estate and they walked and
[45:09] they just kept
[45:09] praying for healing healing healing he
[45:11] said after that i think they made like
[45:13] 10 trips to india
[45:14] he said after that not one child got
[45:16] sick
[45:18] before every time he leave there'd be
[45:20] sickness sickness sickness would strike
[45:21] the family
[45:22] and he said i got tired of it he said i
[45:24] need a victory over this jericho
[45:26] now come on church there's three
[45:27] examples right there the jericho of a
[45:29] loud bar
[45:31] the jericho of sickness every time god's
[45:34] servant's going to leave
[45:35] right and the jericho over knee injury
[45:38] amen
[45:40] our god is mighty and battle praise god
[45:42] amen
[45:45] see there's just three simple examples
[45:47] of someone looking at the word and say
[45:49] my if they got a victory
[45:50] i can get a victory i'm just going to
[45:53] take god at his word and really there's
[45:54] no miracle and walk
[45:55] the miracle doesn't come by walking the
[45:57] miracle comes by believing
[46:00] and praying praise god
[46:03] so you just pray while you walk
[46:06] right you're just praying you talk to
[46:07] god while you walk
[46:09] and then god can do great things how
[46:11] many believe that amen
[46:12] i've seen it three times in my life well
[46:14] i'm sorry i've seen it two times in my
[46:15] life the other one i didn't see i just
[46:16] heard that one preached
[46:18] okay so joshua chapter six i hope that's
[46:20] a blessing there
[46:22] joshua chapter six
[46:26] so see church if we want to see the
[46:29] jericho's come down in our lives we
[46:31] really have to obey the word of god
[46:33] now like i said some of them like
[46:34] abraham they might take it 25 years
[46:37] so i'm not promising you something's
[46:38] going to happen tomorrow it may it's all
[46:40] in god's hand
[46:42] i'm not the promise keeper jesus christ
[46:45] is the promised keeper praise god
[46:46] he's the promise giver and the promised
[46:48] keeper praise god
[46:50] so in other words we have to tap into
[46:51] his mind what's his mind what's his
[46:53] timeline for answering my prayers
[46:56] right and then you can be content like
[46:58] last week let me just tell this
[46:59] testimony
[47:00] last week we had a sister come up for
[47:01] prayer her husband left her 12 years ago
[47:04] and she said i just need to know yes or
[47:06] no is he coming back and i said sister
[47:08] i said listen i said don't put that
[47:10] right now i said
[47:11] god may not give you that right now i
[47:14] said you don't have to live in
[47:16] in fear and not knowing and i took i
[47:18] took that bible right there i said
[47:20] the bible says if you make your request
[47:22] unto god then the peace of god will keep
[47:24] your heart
[47:27] i said and i said you have great faith
[47:30] sister because she does she has great
[47:31] things
[47:32] she she actually wants her husband she's
[47:34] given adultery so many times
[47:35] he actually wants she actually wants him
[47:37] to repent and come back and be part of
[47:39] the family
[47:40] and be a father to the children they've
[47:41] had
[47:43] i said well that's one i said that's
[47:45] fine that's beautiful make your request
[47:46] known to god
[47:48] and we wept there and she cried and
[47:49] praised her hand and scream and praise
[47:51] the lord
[47:52] you know but the whole point was
[47:56] you have to wait until god shows you
[47:58] what he's going to do
[47:59] but while you're waiting the peace of
[48:01] god should rule your life
[48:03] amen right we shouldn't be anxious about
[48:06] anything there's no reason to be anxious
[48:08] if god's offering us peace right now
[48:11] praise god
[48:12] if you have the peace of god then you're
[48:14] not worried about the future praise god
[48:16] because you know he has it in his
[48:17] control praise god
[48:20] he's got the whole world in his hands
[48:22] amen we need to sing that song but
[48:23] that's a reality
[48:24] everything is ordered by the lord praise
[48:27] god
[48:30] the footsteps are right of the righteous
[48:32] our order of the lord we know that we
[48:33] know that we know that let's act like it
[48:35] praise god
[48:37] let's let's have the peace of god
[48:39] because we know god is in control of my
[48:40] life amen
[48:42] he's allowing this test to increase my
[48:46] faith
[48:47] that's what we saw with his sister and
[48:48] she was so happy afterwards you know
[48:50] i said sister i said i said now you
[48:52] watch the preaching i said you watch how
[48:54] your pastor preaches the next few weeks
[48:56] god might give you the answer is he
[48:58] coming home yes or no
[49:00] but i said while you're waiting the
[49:01] peace of god promises to be on you
[49:04] and if it don't come it's because you
[49:06] don't believe it right
[49:08] because the bible says if you request
[49:10] and give thanksgiving the peace of god
[49:12] comes
[49:12] it's a guarantee praise god amen
[49:15] absolute guarantee i appreciate a
[49:17] woman's faith like that that was great
[49:18] faith
[49:19] now joshua chapter six let me get since
[49:21] you're hopefully your turn there now
[49:24] now jericho was straightly shut up
[49:26] because the children of israel none went
[49:27] out none came in and the lord said unto
[49:30] joshua see i've given into thine hand
[49:32] jericho and the king thereof and the
[49:34] mighty men of valor
[49:35] now look it's past tense i've already
[49:37] given to you right
[49:38] that's how god is you already got the
[49:40] victory
[49:42] you're already going to overcome don't
[49:44] worry about the outcome you're gonna get
[49:45] the victory
[49:46] right verse three and you should compass
[49:49] the city all ye men of war and go
[49:51] about the city once thus shall thou do
[49:54] six days
[49:56] and seven priests shall bear before the
[49:58] ark now look
[49:59] where are they at they're before the ark
[50:02] so the priests with the horns are before
[50:04] the ark
[50:06] seven trumpets of rams horns and the
[50:08] seventh day you shall come to the city
[50:10] seven times
[50:10] and the priest shall blow with the
[50:12] trumpets and it should come to pass that
[50:14] when they make a long blast with the
[50:16] ram's horn
[50:17] and when you hear the sound of the
[50:18] trumpet all the people shall shout with
[50:20] a great shout
[50:21] and the wall of the city shall fall down
[50:23] flat and the people shall send up every
[50:25] man straight before him
[50:27] and joshua the son of nun called the
[50:29] priest and said to them take up the ark
[50:30] of the covenant and let seven priests
[50:32] bear
[50:33] seven trumpets of ram horns before the
[50:35] ark of the lord
[50:36] and he said to the people pass on
[50:38] encompass the city and let him that is
[50:40] armed pass on before the ark of the lord
[50:44] so you have the armed man with swords
[50:46] right
[50:47] and then you have the priests with the
[50:49] ram's horns
[50:51] then you have the ark
[50:54] okay so you have our men soldiers
[50:57] trumpet holders ram horns holders then
[51:00] you have the ark of the word
[51:02] see the order that's the order and
[51:04] that's why we do our church service the
[51:06] way we do right
[51:07] we should have prayer first those that
[51:09] are fighting with the
[51:10] the prayer on the battling right the
[51:12] full armor of god amen
[51:14] praying for the success of this day
[51:16] praise god praying for the success of
[51:18] the song service of the preaching of the
[51:20] word
[51:20] that the sick could be healed praise god
[51:22] that if we have anoint people with oil
[51:24] we can anoint them with oil
[51:26] and the prayer of the faith will save
[51:27] the sick praise god
[51:29] and then we have the rams horns or the
[51:30] singers the musicians right
[51:33] the armed men the musicians and then
[51:35] comes the preaching of the word amen
[51:37] then comes the ark the bloody word amen
[51:41] there's blood on the mercy seat above
[51:43] the word amen
[51:44] the bloody word then comes the word
[51:46] praise god
[51:47] amen so that's the order this is where
[51:50] we get the order of our church services
[51:53] soldiers who pray and fight with the
[51:55] word singing
[51:56] preaching of the word praise god verse 8
[52:00] and it came to pass when joshua had
[52:01] spoken to the people that the seven
[52:03] priests
[52:04] bearing the seven trumpets of the ram's
[52:05] horns passed on before the lord
[52:07] and blew with the trumpets and the ark
[52:09] of the covenant of the lord
[52:11] follow them so see music and then the
[52:13] word
[52:14] see that's why music's so powerful
[52:16] hallelujah it just prepares the way for
[52:19] the word
[52:20] so you ought to come out of song service
[52:22] and preach to me amen
[52:24] give me the word of the lord amen i want
[52:26] it i'm saying to jesus i've worshiped
[52:29] him
[52:29] tell me what he says now give me his
[52:32] word preacher right give me
[52:34] give me thus saith the word praise god
[52:36] see that's how it goes
[52:39] now look at verse 9 the armed men went
[52:40] before the priest so see
[52:42] our men soldiers with swords go before
[52:46] the musicians that blew with the
[52:49] trumpets and the reword came after the
[52:51] ark the priest going on
[52:52] and the blowing of the trumpets and
[52:54] joshua commanded the people saying he
[52:56] shall not shout nor make any noise with
[52:58] your voice neither shall any word
[53:00] proceed out of your mouth until the day
[53:02] that i bid you shout
[53:03] then shall ye shout and so the ark of
[53:06] the lord compassed the city going about
[53:08] it once
[53:09] and they came into the camp and lodge in
[53:11] the camp and josh
[53:12] rose early in the morning and the priest
[53:14] took up the ark of the lord when did he
[53:16] rise up
[53:16] early he had specific directions from
[53:19] the lord
[53:20] see if you want a real victory you got
[53:22] to give god your best
[53:23] amen you got to seek god first praise
[53:26] god joshua didn't sleep in
[53:28] he woke up early now sometimes you do
[53:30] need to sleep in
[53:31] let me say that but if you're in battle
[53:33] and you're at a time where god's calling
[53:35] you to battle
[53:36] you have to get up early and seek the
[53:37] lord praise god
[53:39] jesus did it remember jesus david did it
[53:41] all the men of god did it abraham did it
[53:45] if you want that victory you got to get
[53:47] up and show god he's more important amen
[53:51] that's what people tell me they say how
[53:52] do you get up at 5am i say well i got a
[53:54] port
[53:55] appointment who's your appointment with
[53:56] jesus yes
[53:59] he's more important than my boss at
[54:01] school right
[54:03] right so i i can't miss that appointment
[54:06] so it's important to me i'm going to be
[54:07] there that's my time with the father
[54:11] and what's the reward being in his
[54:13] presence amen
[54:16] that's the reward praise god right
[54:20] it's not like i get chocolate or i get a
[54:23] egg mcmuffin out of it or no no the
[54:25] reward is just talking with god amen
[54:28] amen fellowshipping he said i'm knocking
[54:30] on the door and he said open with me
[54:33] i'll come in and stop with you and you
[54:34] with me
[54:36] my reward is eating with jesus
[54:39] hallelujah
[54:40] feasting on his word praise god enjoying
[54:43] his fellowship
[54:44] just talking just casting my cares upon
[54:47] the lord
[54:48] jesus i can't handle this you take this
[54:52] day has a lot lord you go before me i
[54:54] need you in this hour how many could say
[54:56] men in the hatch
[54:58] see we have all these we can be on time
[55:00] for work because we got an appointment
[55:02] we got to make some money
[55:04] but there's greater appointments than
[55:05] that yeah that's
[55:07] you mean you'll be on time for work for
[55:10] mammon but you won't be on time for
[55:12] spiritual riches
[55:13] something's wrong that's true church
[55:16] something's wrong now it's not it's not
[55:20] a legalistic thing but it's when when
[55:22] your heart has grown to love
[55:24] fellowship so much with god like joshua
[55:26] there's a time to seek the lord
[55:29] praise the lord i just want you to
[55:31] understand that i'm not trying to
[55:32] condemn anybody
[55:33] because sometimes i go i i sleep in
[55:35] those 5 30.
[55:37] sometimes i sleep into 6 or 6 30. you
[55:38] know but i want to put god first
[55:42] and i want to be sensitive to the holy
[55:44] spirit to remember that he
[55:46] he deserves first place above everything
[55:48] else
[55:49] see that so he wrote rises early in
[55:53] verse 12
[55:54] the priest took up the ark of the lord
[55:55] and the seven priests bearing seven
[55:57] trumpets of ran horns before the ark of
[55:58] lord went on continually
[55:59] and blew with the trumpets and the r men
[56:01] went before them so see
[56:03] you have our men so can you just picture
[56:05] that soldier's going before you
[56:07] you have soldiers what what an army this
[56:09] is imagine what an army you have all
[56:10] these armed men going before you
[56:12] and after that you got the trumpet you
[56:14] got the music
[56:16] and then after that you got the word oh
[56:18] that sounds like a great church service
[56:20] to me praise god
[56:21] all these warriors walking in ready to
[56:23] pray and then we got the music
[56:25] and then we got the word coming this is
[56:27] god's army this
[56:29] is a joshua invincible army church
[56:32] praise god that's why we're still
[56:34] standing today is because we're
[56:35] invincible army
[56:37] when the word is first amen
[56:41] so true see we we learn these lessons
[56:46] see now verse 14 the second day they
[56:48] compass the city once returned the camp
[56:50] so they did
[56:51] six days and it came to pass on the
[56:53] seventh day that they rose early about
[56:54] the dawning of the day
[56:56] so right about when sun comes up
[57:00] encompass the city after the same manner
[57:01] seven times only
[57:03] on that day they compass the city seven
[57:06] times
[57:07] now i said i said it this morning god
[57:09] was like a silent assassin here right
[57:12] six days there's can you imagine the
[57:14] people looking over the walls you know
[57:15] they had armed men out there
[57:16] what are these people doing what are
[57:18] these people doing and god was
[57:20] making god was making them god was
[57:22] tormenting them
[57:23] because he was going to pour out his
[57:24] wrath upon them all the incense
[57:27] or i'm sorry all the incest they did all
[57:29] the murders
[57:30] all the adulteries all the all the rape
[57:33] they did
[57:34] god was going to destroy them he was
[57:36] bringing his wrath
[57:37] so he lets them shake there for six days
[57:39] but don't forget rahab had time to get
[57:41] saul saved amen
[57:43] see god had for anybody who wanted to
[57:46] save
[57:46] be saved god had a house where they
[57:48] could be saved amen
[57:50] god had a place of refuge amen even in
[57:53] the midst of a corrupt nation
[57:55] god always has a place of refuge amen
[57:58] there's always a hiding place oh there
[58:00] it is the secret place
[58:02] there's always a place in the cleft of
[58:04] the rock amen
[58:05] where god will hide the real believer
[58:07] praise god amen
[58:10] so while they were silent six days
[58:11] rahab's like get him in come on
[58:13] look get him in get him in that's what
[58:14] we see today we see the judgments of god
[58:17] are falling get in the ark
[58:18] get in the baptism of the holy ghost you
[58:21] children if you're not born again
[58:22] be born again praise god i don't know
[58:25] what brother mj has been been taught
[58:27] but if he's not born again i say be born
[58:29] again praise god
[58:31] i say it to our church all the time if
[58:32] we're not born again be born again
[58:35] get in that home where the scarlet cord
[58:37] is hanging because that home won't be
[58:39] touched by the wrath of god
[58:41] that home is a home of rest a home of
[58:43] mercy praise god
[58:45] the promise of god will stand and when
[58:47] judgment falls
[58:48] that home will be spared praise god
[58:52] because of the blood of jesus christ
[58:54] that's right
[58:56] thank god
[59:00] so that's the seventh day they rose up
[59:02] and they go about seven times now this
[59:04] is just
[59:04] this is just my thought i could be wrong
[59:08] but for but for six church ages there
[59:11] was no shout
[59:12] so six days there was no shout
[59:16] the shout only came on the seventh day
[59:19] because the rapture comes in the seventh
[59:21] church age
[59:23] that's just my thought okay because i'm
[59:26] typing this to the end of the world
[59:27] because paul said there's a shout voice
[59:30] trump at the rapture
[59:33] right so a shout means a stimulating cry
[59:35] it awakens you
[59:37] and it gives you a direction that's in
[59:38] the greek
[59:40] so see the shout was the ministry of
[59:42] brother william brown that was the shout
[59:44] it started a revival in 1947 it's still
[59:46] going on today
[59:48] amen hallelujah still going on today
[59:51] in us praise god in our sister churches
[59:54] and all those who love jesus christ with
[59:56] all their heart soul mind and strength
[59:58] amen still going on today it awakened
[1:00:01] the bride
[1:00:02] it awakened the people said trim your
[1:00:04] lamps make yourself ready
[1:00:05] go you got to meet him praise god there
[1:00:08] was no
[1:00:08] shout in the first six church ages only
[1:00:11] the seventh
[1:00:13] that's the way i can see it by god's
[1:00:14] grace i see it as a type
[1:00:17] now there has to be seven rounds seven
[1:00:20] cycles
[1:00:21] here in the in this on the seventh day
[1:00:24] so seven cycles on the seventh day now i
[1:00:27] don't know what that means i just think
[1:00:28] it means seven seals
[1:00:30] that's uh because the seven seal book is
[1:00:33] open in chapter six right
[1:00:35] and then that that book comes down in
[1:00:36] chapter 10 of revelation
[1:00:38] that open book the seven seals are now
[1:00:40] loose and it has to go to around the
[1:00:42] world
[1:00:44] right every nation people tongue so to
[1:00:46] me i'm just guessing but i think it's
[1:00:48] the seven seals
[1:00:50] because you have a seven on the seventh
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:54] seven revelations uh this case would be
[1:00:57] seven revolutions
[1:00:58] on the seventh day but it's it seems
[1:01:01] like it's very connected okay that's
[1:01:03] just a side note
[1:01:04] because that that's really not the the
[1:01:06] emphasis of the text
[1:01:08] okay so yeah i wanna make sure i just uh
[1:01:10] preach these thoughts here that i think
[1:01:12] are important
[1:01:13] now verse 16 it came to pass the seventh
[1:01:16] time when the tree
[1:01:16] when the priest blew the trumpets joshua
[1:01:18] said the people shout
[1:01:19] for the lord hath given you the city and
[1:01:22] all the city shall be accursed even it
[1:01:24] and all that are therein
[1:01:26] to the lord only rahab the harlot shall
[1:01:27] live and she and all
[1:01:29] look at that all that are within her
[1:01:31] that are with her in the house
[1:01:33] remember paul told that philippian
[1:01:34] jailer believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:01:36] and thy and thy house
[1:01:38] shall be saved in other words anyone who
[1:01:40] believes in your house
[1:01:42] will be saved praise god but they have
[1:01:44] to believe
[1:01:46] because she hid the messengers that we
[1:01:49] sent
[1:01:49] because she honored the word she's going
[1:01:51] to escape the wrath of god
[1:01:53] glory verse 18 and ye in any wise
[1:01:57] keep yourselves from the accursed thing
[1:01:59] lest you make yourselves a curse
[1:02:01] when you take of the accursed thing and
[1:02:03] make the camp of israel curse and
[1:02:04] trouble look that's a prophecy
[1:02:07] right because we knew aiken was going to
[1:02:08] take we know now aiken was going to take
[1:02:10] something
[1:02:11] now look at that 99.9 percent of the
[1:02:14] church obeyed
[1:02:16] right only one man disobeyed and it
[1:02:19] caused death
[1:02:21] 36 people died at the next battle
[1:02:24] because
[1:02:24] one church member disobeyed see how
[1:02:27] important is for us to come to church
[1:02:28] confess our sins right think about that
[1:02:32] are
[1:02:32] any of our unconfessed sin could be
[1:02:34] keeping one of these brothers from
[1:02:35] sisters
[1:02:36] from getting healed could be
[1:02:39] right we don't we don't know so we got
[1:02:40] to come to church and confess all of our
[1:02:42] sins
[1:02:43] remember paul said he said because you
[1:02:46] didn't judge the bodies and many are
[1:02:48] weak and sickly among you and many have
[1:02:50] died
[1:02:51] let's read that first corinthians 11.
[1:02:53] just for uh the sake here i don't know
[1:02:55] brother mj did you know that scripture
[1:02:57] brother
[1:02:58] okay that's a good one to read then
[1:02:59] thank you buddy first corinthians 11.
[1:03:01] this was
[1:03:02] and brothers a fresh revelation to me
[1:03:04] just this past year
[1:03:06] uh because i never i never really
[1:03:08] thought there was curses in the new
[1:03:09] testament but there are
[1:03:10] there are because this is a curse first
[1:03:13] corinthians 11. so
[1:03:16] starting in verse 23 is the communion
[1:03:19] order
[1:03:20] eating of the bread drinking of the cup
[1:03:24] now look at verse 27 whosoever i'm sorry
[1:03:27] wherefore
[1:03:28] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:03:30] this cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[1:03:32] guilty of the body and blood of the lord
[1:03:34] so people who go through communion and
[1:03:36] don't treat christians right they're
[1:03:38] going to be
[1:03:38] guilty right of mistreating christ
[1:03:43] verse 28 but let a man examine himself
[1:03:45] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:03:46] drink of that cup
[1:03:47] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy
[1:03:49] eateth and drink a damnation to himself
[1:03:51] not discerning the lord's body
[1:03:55] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:03:58] among you
[1:03:58] and many sleep many all because now we
[1:04:02] do it out here brother mj we get out
[1:04:04] i i usually make the communion bread and
[1:04:06] we already have wine that somebody made
[1:04:08] so we do it right here i pull we know we
[1:04:10] pull it out here
[1:04:12] and the bible said many people died in
[1:04:15] the corinthian church
[1:04:16] because they didn't examine themselves
[1:04:18] and treat the other people the right way
[1:04:21] and yet this church had lots of gifts
[1:04:24] they had so many tongue speakers he had
[1:04:25] to say
[1:04:26] just do three at the most remember that
[1:04:28] that's in chapter 14.
[1:04:30] they had so many prophecies and gifts
[1:04:32] but yet they had so many people die too
[1:04:36] because they weren't discerning the
[1:04:37] lord's body we need to be very careful
[1:04:39] how we treat one another
[1:04:41] with love mercy kindness
[1:04:44] and respect right because look just
[1:04:48] just mistreating someone in the body may
[1:04:50] cause you to get sick
[1:04:52] may cause you to to die by mistreating
[1:04:55] someone so let's be very careful how we
[1:05:00] treat one another amen
[1:05:02] praise god i want to show you that now
[1:05:03] back to joshua 6.
[1:05:05] i just thought i'd bring that out i hope
[1:05:06] that was a blessing there
[1:05:11] god warns them don't touch anything in
[1:05:14] here
[1:05:14] it's all it all needs to be destroyed
[1:05:18] okay verse 19 but all the silver
[1:05:22] gold vessels of brass and iron are
[1:05:23] consecrated unto the lord they shall
[1:05:25] come into the treasury
[1:05:26] of the lord so the people shouted when
[1:05:28] the priests blew with the trumpets and
[1:05:30] it came to pass when the people heard
[1:05:31] the sound of the trumpet
[1:05:32] the people shouted with a great shout
[1:05:34] that the wall fell down flat so the
[1:05:37] the people went up into the city every
[1:05:39] man straight
[1:05:40] before him and they took this city this
[1:05:43] reminds me of when paul was in prison
[1:05:45] and they sang at midnight and and
[1:05:47] everything shook and every
[1:05:48] and they were able to get out by the
[1:05:50] praises of god amen
[1:05:52] but notice in this day they had to hold
[1:05:54] it in for six days can you imagine not
[1:05:56] praying
[1:05:56] or not speaking the word for six days
[1:06:00] oh i imagine they just felt they were
[1:06:02] just ready to shout but he said you stay
[1:06:04] quiet
[1:06:05] for six days he said save that shout
[1:06:08] save that victory shout
[1:06:10] for the seventh day save it for the time
[1:06:12] you're really gonna get the victory
[1:06:14] praise god
[1:06:16] and they had it all bottled up it's like
[1:06:17] new wine
[1:06:19] glorious like elijah with that new wine
[1:06:21] he had to wait
[1:06:22] wait for job to get done wait for his
[1:06:24] three friends and then he let forth all
[1:06:26] that revelation there in the book of job
[1:06:28] new wine this is throwing up new one
[1:06:30] this is you in other words
[1:06:32] this is you and i waiting for the
[1:06:33] opportunity to witness to our loved ones
[1:06:36] can i say it like that this is you and i
[1:06:39] holding our words until we know
[1:06:41] that's when the holy spirit wants us to
[1:06:42] say it
[1:06:44] see and it may be a great battle maybe a
[1:06:47] great test
[1:06:47] but if we wait upon the lord if god's
[1:06:49] telling us to wait then we wait
[1:06:52] right i always i just i do like this
[1:06:54] when i'm talking to somebody i just say
[1:06:55] lord
[1:06:56] give me the opportunity lord let them
[1:06:57] ask you a question lord i'm ready to say
[1:06:59] it if you'll give me a chance
[1:07:01] most of the time i don't get the chance
[1:07:03] because they'll leave or something will
[1:07:04] happen
[1:07:05] but i love when i get the chance right i
[1:07:08] love when i get the chance
[1:07:10] now when on thursday when i met brother
[1:07:11] mj he's the one that he said oh i love
[1:07:13] your hat
[1:07:14] he said that jesus had on
[1:07:17] so that was god opening up that
[1:07:18] conversation
[1:07:21] and but when i put on that hat that
[1:07:22] morning i was ready i whenever i put it
[1:07:24] on i'm saying lord
[1:07:25] i'm ready to tell anybody about jesus if
[1:07:27] they say anything negative i'm going to
[1:07:28] tell them
[1:07:29] how could i say anything negative about
[1:07:30] jesus he healed my mom of cancer
[1:07:33] what are you going to say then most
[1:07:34] people love their mom you know
[1:07:36] right so i'm ready i'm always ready with
[1:07:38] that comeback oh you don't love your mom
[1:07:40] god heal my mom jesus gave my mom a
[1:07:41] cancer that's why i wear this hat
[1:07:44] i'm not ashamed of the gospel amen it's
[1:07:46] the power of god
[1:07:47] under salvation amen hallelujah amen
[1:07:51] so anyways he he made that statement and
[1:07:53] remember i said brother i said something
[1:07:54] like this said
[1:07:55] i said i love to i love jesus he healed
[1:07:57] my mom of cancer how could i not love
[1:07:58] jesus
[1:07:59] and then he started testifying to me
[1:08:00] about all god had done to him
[1:08:02] i remember that worker there was a
[1:08:03] worker right next to you she was
[1:08:04] listening over smiling looking at us
[1:08:07] so see there's a chance we got to
[1:08:08] witness the love of jesus
[1:08:10] to his co-worker now whether she repents
[1:08:13] or not or whatever
[1:08:14] she heard about at least two miracles
[1:08:17] god did in our lives
[1:08:19] praise god so just waiting for that
[1:08:22] right moment i'm glad you said that
[1:08:23] brother
[1:08:24] see that's what we have to do talk about
[1:08:26] jesus amen
[1:08:28] testify about jesus amen so people can
[1:08:30] hear the word of god
[1:08:32] it's a blessing to it's a any
[1:08:34] opportunity to get this speak the name
[1:08:36] of jesus is a privilege to us amen
[1:08:39] it's an absolute privilege
[1:08:43] now verse 21 they utterly destroyed all
[1:08:44] that was in the city both man
[1:08:46] and woman young and old ox and sheep and
[1:08:48] ass and the edge of the sword
[1:08:51] so in other words god was saying on this
[1:08:53] battle in particular
[1:08:55] i'm taking all the spoils this is mine
[1:08:59] in other words this is my first fruits
[1:09:01] this is for me
[1:09:03] now if you look at all the rest of the
[1:09:04] battles joshua got to fight all of them
[1:09:07] take all the spoils but not this one
[1:09:09] god said jericho's mind this big fight
[1:09:12] this big
[1:09:13] this big warrior i'm showing you that
[1:09:16] i'm going before you
[1:09:18] i'm showing you that i'm the captain of
[1:09:20] the host
[1:09:22] joshua you're not the captain i'm the
[1:09:25] captain amen
[1:09:26] and if you lean upon me i'll give you
[1:09:28] victory after victory
[1:09:30] you'll go from strength to strength from
[1:09:31] glory to glory
[1:09:33] from bible experience to bible
[1:09:35] experience amen
[1:09:37] hallelujah and i'm taking all the credit
[1:09:39] on this one i'm thinking
[1:09:40] i'm doing everything comes to me on this
[1:09:42] one
[1:09:43] you can have all the other ones but this
[1:09:44] one's mine the first is always god's
[1:09:47] always pay your tithes first that's
[1:09:49] right before you pay any bills pay your
[1:09:51] tithes
[1:09:52] god will bless you i'm a witness no
[1:09:55] doubt
[1:09:56] always pay i used to wait till saturday
[1:09:58] night on the day i get paid on thursday
[1:10:00] i pay on thursday now even before the
[1:10:01] funds are actually my bank account
[1:10:03] i just pay it early i want to be i want
[1:10:05] god to be first
[1:10:08] i know he's faithful now look
[1:10:11] everything goes to god but joshua said
[1:10:13] unto the two men that spout the old
[1:10:15] country verse 22
[1:10:16] go into the hare's house bring out
[1:10:17] thence the woman and all that she had as
[1:10:19] she swearing to her
[1:10:20] and the young men that were spies went
[1:10:22] in and brought out rahab and her father
[1:10:23] and a mother and her brother and all
[1:10:24] that she had
[1:10:25] and they brought out all her kindred and
[1:10:28] left them without the camp of israel can
[1:10:29] you imagine rahab going out of there
[1:10:31] can you imagine she's probably screaming
[1:10:33] and shouting crying
[1:10:34] my whole family saved everybody else
[1:10:37] died and said
[1:10:38] it was slain but we're all saved i got
[1:10:41] all my family i got my
[1:10:43] my nieces my nephews i got my mom and my
[1:10:45] dad
[1:10:46] god saved all of us all because of grace
[1:10:49] all because i heard the word and
[1:10:51] believed amen
[1:10:53] let that be our testimony praise god i
[1:10:55] believe
[1:10:56] every word of god i'll hide the word of
[1:10:58] god in my heart praise god
[1:11:01] lord just save all my family that's my
[1:11:03] prayer amen
[1:11:06] everybody else was dead laying around
[1:11:08] all the destruction but
[1:11:09] just her and her family comes out we're
[1:11:11] the victors
[1:11:12] we're more than conquerors god spared us
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:16] god kept his god keeps his word amen
[1:11:19] hallelujah the only family
[1:11:23] that made it out was rahab's family the
[1:11:24] harlots family
[1:11:26] oh hallelujah because the blood washes
[1:11:29] white as snow
[1:11:31] beautiful
[1:11:34] verse 24 they burnt the city with fire
[1:11:36] and all that was there and only the
[1:11:38] silver the gold the vessels of brass and
[1:11:39] of iron
[1:11:40] they put the treasury of the house lord
[1:11:41] and joshua saved rahab in the the heart
[1:11:43] of the lie look they're still calling
[1:11:44] her a harlot
[1:11:46] but like the preacher said one day in
[1:11:47] heaven she won't be rahab the harlot
[1:11:49] she'll be sister rahab
[1:11:52] because there we know heart that's there
[1:11:54] the harvest is destroyed in the lake of
[1:11:55] fire
[1:11:57] right there's no harness they're just
[1:11:58] forgiving saints there amen
[1:12:00] because we're all heartless spiritually
[1:12:02] right any friendship with the world is
[1:12:04] adultery with god
[1:12:06] so god forgive us we got and he will he
[1:12:08] will forgive us
[1:12:10] and i'm almost done i got 11 more
[1:12:11] minutes on my hour so bear with me here
[1:12:14] uh and her father's household verse 25
[1:12:16] and all that she had
[1:12:17] and she dwelt in israel even unto this
[1:12:19] day because she hid the messengers
[1:12:21] which joshua sent to spy out jericho see
[1:12:24] see just
[1:12:25] hide the word in your heart and god will
[1:12:27] bless you
[1:12:29] that's all she did she just hid the word
[1:12:32] right my girls asked me
[1:12:33] this week was it okay to sin and i said
[1:12:34] well scripturally
[1:12:36] it's only okay to lie if you're hiding
[1:12:38] messengers
[1:12:40] scripturally right that's that's the one
[1:12:42] time god honored
[1:12:43] a lie right i mean can you think of
[1:12:46] another one
[1:12:47] you say okay yeah yeah me too i've
[1:12:51] always wondered about that
[1:12:52] how could god but god but that's the
[1:12:55] whole reason even hebrews records that
[1:12:57] that's her faith caused her to lie no
[1:13:02] so that's really something the bible
[1:13:04] said by faith rahab
[1:13:06] received the messengers and hid them
[1:13:08] from the guards
[1:13:11] so that's really it's just really
[1:13:13] something but that's the one time god
[1:13:15] allowed it
[1:13:16] where it seemed like it worked out for
[1:13:18] his glory oh let me share this too
[1:13:21] church even out of our worst decisions
[1:13:23] god can still bring redemption
[1:13:28] i cam or simon i heard simon preach this
[1:13:30] on wednesday so i'm preaching simon's
[1:13:31] thought here
[1:13:34] we remember lot being saved out of sodom
[1:13:36] right he was saved out of the homosexual
[1:13:38] community right
[1:13:40] he and his two daughters were saved well
[1:13:42] we know they did evil things what evil
[1:13:44] thing did they do
[1:13:46] incest right
[1:13:49] that was an awful thing
[1:13:53] but i just want you to show out of that
[1:13:55] came moab
[1:13:57] right and moab was always a thorn in
[1:14:00] israel's side
[1:14:02] but god was so gracious that even out of
[1:14:05] a cursed seed like moab
[1:14:08] god would call out a ruth
[1:14:12] hallelujah look out of incest
[1:14:16] god still offered their offspring grace
[1:14:19] and mercy
[1:14:20] and saved anyone that wanted to believe
[1:14:22] even ruth
[1:14:24] and he gave her so much grace she he
[1:14:28] he made her what grandmother to david
[1:14:32] and great great great great great
[1:14:33] grandmother to jesus christ our lord
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:37] look so even out of evil situations god
[1:14:40] still delights in life
[1:14:42] amen god delights in mercy amen
[1:14:47] even out of an awful act so even like
[1:14:49] someone that would rape
[1:14:50] be raped and have a child they should
[1:14:52] keep protect that baby because god
[1:14:54] would use that baby for his glory
[1:14:57] right even out of something so awful as
[1:14:59] incest
[1:15:00] god could bring out a roof god could
[1:15:03] bring out
[1:15:03] a boaz right an obed a jesse a david
[1:15:07] all the way down so you get a godly the
[1:15:10] baby the baby jesus praise god the
[1:15:13] messiah the savior of the world
[1:15:15] now wrap your mind around that a little
[1:15:16] bit
[1:15:19] i have a hard time wrapping my mind
[1:15:20] around that sometimes
[1:15:22] out of incest god could bring out a ruth
[1:15:26] out of the lineage
[1:15:30] that speaks love to me
[1:15:33] god is a god full of compassion
[1:15:37] full of love that's beautiful thought i
[1:15:40] never thought that
[1:15:40] i heard simon say i'm like oh my
[1:15:42] goodness no wonder god uh
[1:15:44] god was merciful you know because he
[1:15:46] knew there'd be a ruth come out of there
[1:15:48] there probably wasn't many saved out of
[1:15:50] there but there was one that really
[1:15:52] believed
[1:15:53] faithful ruth hey amen got some of this
[1:15:56] virtuous roof amen because this whole
[1:15:59] city knows she's a virtuous woman amen
[1:16:02] such a godly woman that came out of
[1:16:04] there she said your god
[1:16:06] will be my god naomi is that right
[1:16:09] wherever you go i'll go because you've
[1:16:12] got holiness you've got that law
[1:16:13] you've got jehovah's on your side amen
[1:16:16] your god jehovah's my god amen
[1:16:19] i see the love of god in your life
[1:16:21] praise god i want to be like you so i'll
[1:16:23] go wherever you go
[1:16:24] and it letter into the lineage of the
[1:16:26] messiah amen
[1:16:27] amen oh my thank you lord
[1:16:30] beautiful story beautiful i can't do it
[1:16:33] justice in my
[1:16:34] in my backward preaching style i can't
[1:16:36] do it justice but anyways
[1:16:39] look what god can do out of a harlot's
[1:16:42] home
[1:16:43] he can bring salvation i wonder what
[1:16:45] other acts may have happened in that
[1:16:46] home
[1:16:48] but at the end it became a home a haven
[1:16:50] it became a haven of rest
[1:16:53] it became a house of deliverance praise
[1:16:55] god hallelujah
[1:16:57] that's what god he he's an expert in
[1:17:00] that
[1:17:00] he's an expert on taking awful things
[1:17:03] cleaning them up
[1:17:04] and making them so beautiful because
[1:17:06] that's what he did in my life
[1:17:09] my awful dirty life my my sin soaked
[1:17:11] life
[1:17:12] he cleaned me up he took spin me around
[1:17:14] right wash me with this blood
[1:17:16] and now i'm a sanctified holy
[1:17:17] ghost-filled saint amen
[1:17:19] hallelujah blameless the bible said we
[1:17:22] have blameless before the public praise
[1:17:24] god
[1:17:24] we should be blameless before one
[1:17:26] another amen
[1:17:29] you can say that about me as a sinner i
[1:17:30] had a lot of things you could blame me
[1:17:31] for
[1:17:32] but now by the blood of christ we're
[1:17:34] blameless amen
[1:17:35] yeah we fall short but we say we're
[1:17:37] sorry we're blameless
[1:17:39] it's under the blood
[1:17:43] all right let's finish this chapter then
[1:17:44] we'll be done here i still got six
[1:17:46] minutes on my hour so you've been a
[1:17:47] patient group
[1:17:48] you've been patient so i want to
[1:17:50] encourage the people like i preached
[1:17:51] this morning i don't know if you saw it
[1:17:52] but i preached this morning about
[1:17:53] falling asleep in church
[1:17:55] it's okay if it's you know i ate too
[1:17:57] much because then you can change that
[1:17:58] you can eat less next time
[1:18:00] right i can change that or i didn't get
[1:18:04] enough sleep last night i can change
[1:18:05] that well hopefully with our little kids
[1:18:06] sometimes it's hard right brother thank
[1:18:08] you sometimes
[1:18:09] especially my wife bless your heart uh
[1:18:13] so so there's things if we're sleepy
[1:18:15] they can change but we have to make sure
[1:18:16] we don't get the spiritual slumber
[1:18:18] of the comp the backsliding state of a
[1:18:21] back of a lukewarm christian
[1:18:24] because that will that that's a real
[1:18:25] demon spirit
[1:18:27] and the example i gave was we used to
[1:18:28] have people come to the church that they
[1:18:30] would sleep almost every service i was
[1:18:32] preaching
[1:18:33] now when a guest preacher would come in
[1:18:34] they were all shouting amen
[1:18:36] wow wow but when i preach for the bang
[1:18:38] every time they're sleeping
[1:18:40] and i knew their life they were up all
[1:18:42] night watching youtube
[1:18:44] netflix huh
[1:18:47] so they missed out think about all those
[1:18:49] nuggets they missed out on
[1:18:51] think about all the bread they missed
[1:18:52] out on think about all the drinks of
[1:18:55] living water they missed out on
[1:18:57] because that demon power they'd stay up
[1:18:59] all night to watch
[1:19:00] sin and they enjoyed that sin but then
[1:19:03] when it come to the real thing the real
[1:19:05] the real power of god that's changed our
[1:19:07] lives they're sleeping right through it
[1:19:09] and then church sometimes laugh about it
[1:19:13] laugh about sin that's how you know
[1:19:15] you're really backslidden when satan
[1:19:16] gets you to laugh at sin
[1:19:18] sin paul said should make us tremble
[1:19:22] right he said work out your own
[1:19:24] salvation with what
[1:19:25] fear and trembling
[1:19:29] paul said kick out that brother who's
[1:19:31] sleeping with his stepmom
[1:19:32] he said you should have mourned over
[1:19:34] this in other words you should have fear
[1:19:35] and trembling
[1:19:36] that this man was sleeping with his
[1:19:37] stepmother get him out of the church
[1:19:39] he shouldn't be in the church
[1:19:43] so see many times how people act during
[1:19:45] the preaching kind of shows their
[1:19:46] spiritual state
[1:19:48] i'm not talking about once in a while if
[1:19:49] you had a rough night i'm not talking
[1:19:50] about that
[1:19:51] i'm talking about if service after
[1:19:53] service people don't feed on the word
[1:19:55] and then they wonder why they don't have
[1:19:56] more god in their lives
[1:20:00] to me that proves beyond a shadow of a
[1:20:02] doubt they're in sanctification still
[1:20:04] because that's the attitude of israel
[1:20:07] after they rejected the promised land
[1:20:08] this morning
[1:20:10] they called the they called the manna
[1:20:12] light bread and they started loathing it
[1:20:17] right in other words they they didn't
[1:20:20] like coming to church anymore they'd
[1:20:21] rather stay up late and watch youtube
[1:20:24] now and they watch violence on there
[1:20:26] there's a killing on there
[1:20:27] there's evil words there's sexual scenes
[1:20:29] on there
[1:20:30] and say they got the holy ghost i'm
[1:20:32] sorry a holy ghost-filled saint eats on
[1:20:34] the real corn in the land
[1:20:37] the mature the mature meat of the word
[1:20:40] amen hallelujah praise god amen
[1:20:44] they enjoy the meat of the word
[1:20:46] discerning good and evil right
[1:20:49] growing in the things of god getting
[1:20:51] stronger in our faith
[1:20:52] not falling away but pressing on amen
[1:20:56] forgetting those things out of the past
[1:20:58] pressing on with the high mark
[1:21:00] of the high calling in christ jesus
[1:21:03] amen hallelujah
[1:21:09] so that proves to me beyond a shadow of
[1:21:10] a doubt they've made the word of god
[1:21:12] light bread i love this light bread
[1:21:14] broth ram talks about you should look it
[1:21:16] up
[1:21:17] he said his church members that don't
[1:21:18] enjoy coming to church anymore
[1:21:20] that proves beyond a shadow of doubt
[1:21:22] their attitude towards the word
[1:21:23] they are not born again because they're
[1:21:25] still in the wilderness
[1:21:30] you never saw joshua saying oh this is
[1:21:32] light we don't like this corn land oh
[1:21:34] they ate it all up brother
[1:21:36] sister they ate up all that corn and all
[1:21:38] the good corn
[1:21:39] and the meat of the land and the milk
[1:21:40] and honey they're they're feasting
[1:21:42] they're drinking milk and
[1:21:44] honey on the bread and oh my they're
[1:21:45] enjoying all the blessings of god
[1:21:47] that's what we get three times a week
[1:21:49] amen by the word of god
[1:21:51] feasting on milk and honey and the meat
[1:21:54] of the word hallelujah amen
[1:21:57] i've listened to other churches they
[1:21:58] don't preach the meat like we do
[1:22:01] right they preach the little bits of it

[1:23:37] be captured
[1:23:40] and remember paul said we obey all the
[1:23:42] commandments by what
[1:23:43] love so it's not hard it's easy just
[1:23:46] love jesus yes
[1:23:48] if you love jesus you'll love his
[1:23:50] children it's actually easier for us
[1:23:53] because love fulfills all the law
[1:23:56] see everybody had to be in the right
[1:23:58] order everybody had to be quiet they had
[1:24:00] to follow all the directions
[1:24:01] and they just went around and around and
[1:24:03] around
[1:24:05] around until it was time to be done
[1:24:08] sir doesn't that remind you of the
[1:24:09] potter's wheel
[1:24:11] just around the potter had to shape them
[1:24:13] to see
[1:24:14] he was shaping patients in them
[1:24:17] he was pouring water on them and six
[1:24:20] days he was molding their character
[1:24:22] just trust god you can trust me right
[1:24:24] just
[1:24:25] obey all my commands and he's shaping
[1:24:27] israel as a vessel unto
[1:24:29] honor praise god amen
[1:24:32] round and around and around he's molding
[1:24:35] their character
[1:24:36] just do this week after week now for us
[1:24:38] month after month
[1:24:39] year after year i'm molding your
[1:24:41] character i'm
[1:24:43] shaping you into an invincible army
[1:24:47] oh that's glorious amen glorious
[1:24:51] god's hands are all over us praise god
[1:24:55] remember i showed you that scripture
[1:24:56] last week he said i'll never leave you
[1:24:58] or forsake you
[1:24:59] amen you've never left god's hands
[1:25:03] he's had you the whole time he's just
[1:25:04] holding you there in his hands you go

[1:25:11] just like israel
[1:25:12] around jericho praise god time after
[1:25:15] time
[1:25:16] after time this is how god
[1:25:20] shapes us can you pop up a few
[1:25:21] scriptures real quick
[1:25:25] proverbs 10 verse 4 he becometh poor
[1:25:29] that dealth with a slack hand now that's
[1:25:31] natural but also spiritual
[1:25:34] if you're lazy in the spiritual things
[1:25:36] you'll have
[1:25:37] a poor christian experience
[1:25:40] right because paul said we preach the
[1:25:42] unsearchable riches
[1:25:45] right so if you're lazy you'll be a
[1:25:47] spiritually poor person
[1:25:50] you won't enjoy all the blessings right
[1:25:52] joy and peace and healing
[1:25:55] prophecy all all the blessings of god
[1:25:57] that we enjoy
[1:26:00] but the hand of the diligent maketh rich
[1:26:04] see if we can like they were diligent
[1:26:06] every day every day
[1:26:08] god made them rich in testimonies right
[1:26:11] rich and saving souls praise god
[1:26:13] let's go and stand we're gonna let's
[1:26:15] stand and get ready musicians can come
[1:26:16] i'm gonna
[1:26:17] read one more scripture this is our
[1:26:19] that's my hour already
[1:26:20] proverbs 12 24 the hand of the diligent
[1:26:24] shall bear rule so who is god gonna let
[1:26:26] rule his kingdom
[1:26:28] the diligent christians not the lazy
[1:26:31] ones
[1:26:34] right
[1:26:36] i'm sorry 24-10 honey i'm sorry i'm
[1:26:39] sorry 12 24 i'm sorry 12 24.
[1:26:42] yeah not 10 24 i'm sorry 12 24.
[1:26:47] the hand of the diligent shall bear rule
[1:26:49] so was joshua diligent or not
[1:26:51] oh yeah he was up early he told
[1:26:54] everybody what the lord told him
[1:26:55] he said thus saith the lord this is what
[1:26:57] the lord said if we do this it's going
[1:26:59] to happen
[1:27:00] did they get what they asked for
[1:27:01] absolutely
[1:27:03] christ came down broke down those walls
[1:27:06] he broke down the walls praise god
[1:27:08] they come in they spoil the city
[1:27:12] and the people are victors the people
[1:27:14] have
[1:27:15] overcome the world what a beautiful
[1:27:18] testimony how many want to be overcomers
[1:27:20] in this life
[1:27:20] amen praise god god
[1:27:24] honors those that pay attention to the
[1:27:27] details of their life
[1:27:30] praise god those that are those that
[1:27:32] silently obey even
[1:27:34] now what i mean by silent is not
[1:27:35] complain that's what i mean
[1:27:38] right we should be silent when it comes
[1:27:40] to complaining
[1:27:42] right we should bear our burdens and not
[1:27:44] complain this is what they did they
[1:27:46] silently obeyed
[1:27:48] day after day god's going to bring the
[1:27:49] victory god's going to bring the victory
[1:27:52] he told me to do this he told me to go
[1:27:53] around and around this potter's wheel
[1:27:55] i'm just going to keep being shaped by
[1:27:56] him
[1:27:57] i'm going to get the victory he's
[1:27:59] forming something in my life
[1:28:03] praise god i better stop right there

[1:28:49] i want you to believe with all your
[1:28:50] heart that god's gonna bring you the
[1:28:52] victory
[1:28:53] he didn't say when now in this case in
[1:28:54] jericho he did but with us he doesn't
[1:28:56] always say when
[1:28:58] we've got to be diligent
[1:29:02] we've got to keep all the word that we
[1:29:04] know by love
