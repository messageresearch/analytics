[0:00] Uh why don't we start in Jude 1 vers9.
[0:03] We'll just start there. I like to preach
[0:06] on archangels and cherubims this morning
[0:09] here by God's grace.
[0:12] I'll leave the tithes and offering
[0:14] basket up here for today. All right.
[0:16] Norma, I have it over there, but um I'll
[0:19] just sit over there because of the the
[0:20] bread and the wine and so forth by God's
[0:23] grace.
[0:27] So, Jude 1:9 and then we'll go to Daniel
[0:29] chapter 12. Uh, by the grace of the
[0:31] Lord,
[0:44] Jude 1:9, and then Daniel 12:1.
[0:51] I'll read verse 9 and then we can all
[0:52] read uh Daniel 12:1 together. Jude 1:9
[0:56] says, "Yet Michael the archangel when
[0:57] contending with the devil, he disputed
[1:00] about the body of Moses, dur not bring
[1:03] against him a railing accusation, but
[1:06] said, "The Lord rebuke thee." Let's go
[1:08] to Daniel 12:1.
[1:14] There's only two mentions of the word
[1:16] archangel in the entire Bible. So, this
[1:18] is a a smaller pool we we'd say uh to
[1:21] draw from as far as understanding
[1:24] archangels.
[1:27] Uh cherubims would be the most uh
[1:29] there's over 60 mentions of cherubim in
[1:32] the Bible. So I imagine we'll spend most
[1:34] of our time on the cherubim today by
[1:36] God's grace. And of course ties in
[1:38] perfectly with communion uh because
[1:40] that's the first place where God told
[1:42] Aaron and Moses he'd have communion with
[1:44] them between the wings of the cherubam.
[1:46] So, I'm thankful it lines up here uh by
[1:48] God's grace. And I trust you have a
[1:50] wonderful service here today as we
[1:52] approach the Lord's the Lord's supper,
[1:54] the Lord's table. Amen. Daniel 12:1 is
[1:57] speaking of, of course, the tribulation
[1:58] period, a time of trouble that the world
[2:00] uh will never see. Has never seen the
[2:03] likes of it before nor after. Daniel
[2:06] 12:1. Let's read if we can. 1 2 3. And
[2:09] at that time shall Michael stand up the
[2:12] great prince which standeth for the
[2:14] children of thy people. And there shall
[2:17] be a time of trouble such as never was
[2:21] since there was a nation even to that
[2:24] same time. And at that time thy people
[2:27] shall be delivered, everyone that shall
[2:29] be found written in the book. Let's have
[2:32] one more word of prayer. Father God,
[2:34] we're thankful for the word of God
[2:35] today. Lord, again, Lord, we see another
[2:38] witness of you, Lord, sending your angel
[2:40] to deliver your people, Lord God. We
[2:43] learn that, Lord, in the book of Psalm
[2:44] 34:7,
[2:46] how you send your angel to encamp around
[2:48] us and to deliver your people. Lord,
[2:51] here we see again another angel that
[2:53] will deliver your people. Lord, thank
[2:55] you, God, for sending help to the heirs
[2:57] of salvation. We are humbled to know
[3:00] that we're heirs of salvation by the
[3:02] grace of God. May it never become
[3:04] common, Lord God. May we always fear the
[3:06] Lord and may we always reverence your
[3:08] presence. Dear Lord, bless this reading
[3:10] of thy word to your people as we
[3:12] approach your table, your supper, the
[3:14] communion in Jesus Christ's name. And
[3:17] the saint said,
[3:18] &gt;&gt; amen. God bless you as you're being
[3:19] seated. Praise God.
[3:28] So we'll start with archangels. Uh we
[3:30] looked at uh of course the angel of the
[3:31] Lord for two services and uh we showed
[3:34] how the greatest angel there ever was
[3:37] would have been God in angel form.
[3:39] Hallelujah. We'd say it's the Lord Jesus
[3:41] in his logos form. And we saw how he uh
[3:45] revealed himself to numerous men uh
[3:47] attached to his covenants. He would make
[3:49] a covenant and then he would reveal
[3:51] himself to that person with the
[3:53] covenant. Praise God. And uh thankful
[3:56] I'm thankful to know the angel Lord came
[3:58] down in Revelation chapter 10.
[3:59] Hallelujah. I'm thankful that we have
[4:01] received a messenger, a prophet of God.
[4:04] Praise the Lord. That received uh the
[4:07] covenant by the grace of God. Do you
[4:09] remember church? Brother Am said outside
[4:11] of the seven seals and the seven church
[4:13] ages. He said that was my commission
[4:15] from God. He said outside of that, who
[4:17] remembers what was the highlight of his
[4:19] ministry? The token. Does anybody
[4:21] remember that by God's grace? He said
[4:23] that in desperation 1963, brother Ram
[4:26] said, "Outside of my regular commission,
[4:28] the most important message to get to the
[4:30] people was the token that we are all
[4:34] right.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; You're baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[4:37] Your soul is sealed unto the day of its
[4:40] redemption."
[4:41] &gt;&gt; That was the highlight sermon other than
[4:44] the commission that the Lord sent him to
[4:46] do. Hallelujah. Amen. And what is the
[4:49] token? It's the It's the confirmation
[4:52] that the covenant has been received.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The token is we'd say the
[4:57] ticket to get on the plane or the ticket
[4:58] to get on the bus and we all got to have
[5:00] the ticket if we're going to fly and all
[5:01] these things. That's what the token is.
[5:04] It's the ticket knowing that God has
[5:05] received you that you're going to be in
[5:08] the rapture.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; What a token. Hallelujah. And so, we're
[5:12] thankful that God came down as the angel
[5:14] of the Lord. Met with brother Brandham
[5:15] day after day to deliver uh the
[5:17] revelation of the seven seals.
[5:19] Hallelujah. We know there's a little bit
[5:21] left uh to be revealed. Hallelujah. Some
[5:23] of it will not be revealed. Amen. It's
[5:26] the unknown day and hour of the rapture.
[5:28] Hallelujah. That revelation of the
[5:30] seventh seal. No man knows the day or
[5:31] the hour. Uh that will not be revealed
[5:33] to any man. Even Jesus says he doesn't
[5:36] know it. Only the father knows it.
[5:38] Hallelujah. So there are some secrets of
[5:40] course God keeps to himself. Amen. And
[5:44] of course, you know, in each of those
[5:45] services, we I took the last few minutes
[5:47] and just looked out looked at how we
[5:48] have a guardian angel given to us. And
[5:52] the guardian angel is there to deliver
[5:54] us uh to help us because we are the
[5:56] heirs of salvation.
[5:59] Amen. And brother Bram said, I'll just
[6:00] rehearse from the last time. Brother
[6:01] Bram said, when that angel comes around,
[6:03] people start weeping. People start
[6:06] crying. He says sometimes they'll shout,
[6:08] sometimes they'll weep. He says,
[6:10] "Sometimes they'll bow their head.
[6:11] Sometimes they'll throw up their hands
[6:13] and scream uh because the presence of
[6:16] the angel of the Lord. Hallelujah. So we
[6:18] want to be mindful of that today.
[6:20] Hallelujah.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; We should uh invite the presence of God
[6:24] into this service every service.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; We should invite the presence of God
[6:28] into our lives on a daily basis.
[6:30] Hallelujah.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; And when the angel of the Lord comes, he
[6:33] brings a special feeling. The Bible most
[6:36] often calls it fear. uh they the the
[6:38] believers had fear that the angel was
[6:41] there. And so that's how we would feel.
[6:43] Brother Ram would say his angel that
[6:44] would come to him. He said uh uh was not
[6:47] an archangel. It wasn't a wasn't a
[6:49] cherubam or anything like that. He said
[6:50] just it was a regular angel. Uh he said
[6:53] there since his birth, he said but he
[6:56] could always notice. He said he's here.
[6:58] The angel Lord is here. Hallelujah. So
[7:01] he could recognize the presence of the
[7:03] angel Lord. And church that's what we
[7:04] want to do today. We want to recognize
[7:06] God's presence in our lives.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he's going to come and
[7:10] visit us in a special way. We want to
[7:12] recognize that and be beneficiaries of
[7:14] that.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; We do not want to grieve the angel of
[7:17] the Lord. Hallelujah. Uh we want to
[7:20] invite the presence of the Lord and we
[7:22] want to receive what he has for us
[7:23] today.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Remember that last one I read? Remember
[7:26] the woman battling arthritis? Brother
[7:27] Ram said for a day in a row the angel
[7:30] would hover over her with his arms
[7:31] folded and she just couldn't accept it.
[7:33] I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy to for my
[7:35] healing. But brother Ram said, "Look how
[7:37] faithful God was." He kept sending the
[7:38] angel until after the final meeting, the
[7:41] angel stood there. And when everybody's
[7:43] dispersed, everybody left. She's still
[7:45] there sitting in her wheelchair. She's
[7:46] finally able to accept it and she gets
[7:49] up, gets healed of arthritis, pushes out
[7:51] the wheelchair,
[7:53] &gt;&gt; testifying that an angel has visited me.
[7:57] Amen. Hallelujah. May God visit us
[7:59] today. Hallelujah. He might visit you in
[8:01] your home or in a service or something
[8:03] along those lines, but let's keep
[8:05] trusting in God. Let's let's be able to
[8:07] accept the promise of God when he sends
[8:10] it to us and receive it and be
[8:12] beneficiaries because we're heirs of
[8:14] salvation.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Now, let's get to archangel here. I
[8:18] don't want to spend too much time on my
[8:19] review. Uh the archangel uh seems to be
[8:23] uh one of the highest angels. Now,
[8:25] there's only two mentions. We read one
[8:27] of them in uh Jude 1:9 speaking of
[8:30] Michael and of course Michael here in
[8:33] Jude 1:9 is connected to the body change
[8:36] of Moses. We know Moses was uh almost a
[8:40] perfect type of Christ. So when Moses
[8:42] died up on the mountain uh at some point
[8:44] Satan went looking for his body but God
[8:47] had resurrected that and God had taken
[8:50] Moses uh and the body to heaven. And we
[8:52] know that because 1500 years later,
[8:55] Jesus is on Mount Transfiguration and
[8:58] Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus.
[9:01] Hallelujah. And so, Brother Bam tells us
[9:04] God didn't keep Moses out of the
[9:05] promised land. God eventually let him in
[9:07] the promised land. Hallelujah. He just
[9:09] had to wait about 1,500 years. But of
[9:12] course, time goes faster in heaven.
[9:13] Hallelujah. Amen. So, God was gracious
[9:17] to Moses. Amen. God will be gracious to
[9:19] us. Hallelujah.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we see that mentioned and we
[9:23] only see one other time the word
[9:25] archangel mentioned in the Bible. 1
[9:27] Thessalonians 4 verse 16 again in the
[9:31] rapture text or a body change text.
[9:36] And so at this point, you know, alls I
[9:37] can do is just presume. And uh as long
[9:40] as I let you know I'm presuming, then
[9:42] there's no harm in that. Hallelujah.
[9:44] Because I'm not trying to express that I
[9:46] have some greater revelation. Uh I
[9:48] don't. I'm just noticing uh patterns in
[9:51] the scripture. But in uh 1 Thessalonians
[9:54] 4 uh 16, we're we're seeing the three
[9:57] steps of the rapture process. For the
[9:59] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[10:00] with a shout and with the voice of the
[10:03] archangel. Now, one archangel, one voice
[10:07] from one archangel. So, people have
[10:10] specul speculated, could this be
[10:12] Michael? It could be. Could it be
[10:14] another archangel? It could be, right?
[10:18] But in the Bible, we're only told about
[10:19] one archangel, Michael. Now, there's
[10:21] quotes. Brother Ram says there's
[10:23] archangels, right? So, more than one.
[10:26] And I'm not here to I can't say only
[10:28] what the Bible says, right? So, perhaps
[10:30] there's many archangels, but in the
[10:32] Bible, they just list one archangel.
[10:35] Praise God. And so, we wonder, could the
[10:38] voice of Michael be the voice that
[10:40] resurrects the dead? Because Michael's
[10:42] connected to the resurrected Moses.
[10:45] Hallelujah. So, could it be? I don't
[10:47] know, church. But alls I know is that I
[10:49] want to hear it. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[10:51] Alls I know is I want to if I if I pass
[10:53] and go to the grave, I want to hear the
[10:55] voice of the archangel that will raise
[10:57] up the dead in Christ. Hallelujah.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; But there's a connection to resurrected
[11:03] Christians with voice, one voice of one
[11:06] archangel. Hallelujah.
[11:09] Now, some will say that Michael is
[11:10] Christ. I don't believe that. There's
[11:12] only a couple of quotes on that and
[11:13] brother Bram never preaches a whole
[11:14] sermon on it uh because of all the other
[11:17] quotes where brother Bram talks about
[11:18] how angels uh are lower than Christ and
[11:21] I don't I don't ascribe to that but it's
[11:24] not it's nothing for me to argue out
[11:25] about with somebody
[11:27] &gt;&gt; unless you're trying to correct or
[11:28] connect that uh Michael is Christ as
[11:31] some form of salvation then you've went
[11:33] too far and then you're uh then you're
[11:36] inching into to uh I say polluting the
[11:40] gospel of salvation.
[11:42] Brother Ram said you can never major on
[11:44] a minor.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; So when people start uh messing with
[11:48] salvation and maybe connect it to some
[11:49] angel or something like that, salvation
[11:51] is by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not by accepting an
[11:56] angel or not by speaking in tongues or
[11:58] saying you believe the message of the
[11:59] hour or God sent a prophet. Salvation is
[12:01] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[12:04] when you repented of your sins, knowing
[12:06] that Christ became your sin that you
[12:08] might be made his righteousness.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The good old gospel of the good
[12:13] news. We're not saved by works. We're
[12:15] saved by grace. Hallelujah.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:19] So, we stand where the Bible stands.
[12:21] Hallelujah. We stand on the truths of
[12:22] the Bible, the majors of the Bible.
[12:24] Amen. And so we see a connection here
[12:27] with the voice of the archangel with the
[12:29] resurrected dead in Christ. Hallelujah.
[12:32] And then the final step of course is the
[12:34] trump of God where uh he tells us also
[12:37] Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 15 it's
[12:39] in the moment in the twinkle of an eye
[12:41] at the last trump that those that are
[12:43] alive and remain their bodies are
[12:45] swallowed up in life. Death is swallowed
[12:48] up in life. Hallelujah.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; By the trump of God. Amen.
[12:53] Uh, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[12:55] first. Hallelujah. Let's just read 17 is
[12:58] such a promise. Then we which are alive
[12:59] and remain shall be caught up together
[13:01] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[13:04] in the air. So shall we ever be with the
[13:07] Lord. Amen.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; So we see the dead in Christ rise first.
[13:11] Now, Brother Ram takes us back to the
[13:13] resurrection of Jesus and how the the
[13:16] people on earth saw the resurrected
[13:17] bodies before Jesus ascended, right?
[13:20] before they met in the air, we'd say, or
[13:21] the meeting in the air. And brother Ram
[13:23] says, perhaps that'll happen in this
[13:25] second coming of Jesus Christ. Perhaps
[13:28] we'll see the dead in Christ rising, he
[13:30] said, for 30 or 40 days, or he said, or
[13:32] a month or so. Perhaps we'll see that. I
[13:34] hope we do. But all I know is that Jesus
[13:37] will get his bride ready and the rapture
[13:39] will not be one moment late. Hallelujah.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; If he got them ready for the first
[13:44] coming of Christ, he'll get us ready for
[13:46] the second coming of Christ. Amen. God
[13:48] knows how to do it. Amen. And there will
[13:50] not be one that misses the rapture that
[13:52] was supposed to go in the rapture
[13:54] because God had a book, hallelujah, in
[13:56] heaven called the lamb's book of life.
[13:58] And every name on that book, hallelujah,
[14:00] is redeemed by the lamb and empowered by
[14:02] the lamb and in love with the lamb and
[14:04] married to the lamb. Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, brother tells us, I'm
[14:09] just going to read this quote from 1955,
[14:11] the presence of the Lord Jesus. Brother
[14:13] Ram said, "We know Joseph Smith didn't
[14:15] receive a true angel because that angel
[14:17] added entire books to the Bible." Amen.
[14:20] He said, "A real true angel will come
[14:22] and vindicate this scripture to the
[14:24] dot."
[14:26] &gt;&gt; So if anybody would ever say, "Well,
[14:27] brother Jesse, I met an angel or an
[14:28] angel visit me." I would say, "What did
[14:30] that angel say?"
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Because Satan transforms himself into an
[14:35] angel of light.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:37] And a true angel of God will never add
[14:39] or take away one dot or tit from this
[14:43] scripture. Hallelujah.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; One jot or one tit. Forgive me if I said
[14:46] that wrong. Amen. You know the
[14:49] scripture. And I mentioned that even
[14:50] last Wednesday how that man in Africa
[14:52] predicted the rapture and was way off.
[14:54] He did not see Jesus. He saw Satan
[14:56] disguised as Jesus
[14:58] &gt;&gt; because the Bible said Jesus said no man
[15:00] knows the day or the hour of the coming
[15:01] of the Lord.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; So it's it's easy to know. Hallelujah.
[15:05] It's e I shouldn't say it's easy. Uh
[15:07] it's obvious to know the elect cannot be
[15:09] deceived. Hallelujah.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; We have that promise. We will not be
[15:12] deceived. Amen.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Now, the deception has to get worse and
[15:15] worse and more cunning and more cunning.
[15:17] But what will that move you to do? That
[15:19] will move you to have a closer walk with
[15:21] the Lord.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; So, thank God, church. We ought to thank
[15:25] God for our trials today because they're
[15:26] drawing us closer to Christ. We'll thank
[15:29] God for that difficult person in our
[15:31] life because that difficult person
[15:33] forces us down to our knees to pray.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That difficult work
[15:38] situation or when things are tight
[15:40] financially, what does that do? It gets
[15:41] you on your knees saying, "God, I need
[15:43] to hear from you." And that prayer time
[15:45] with God, that communion with God gets
[15:47] you closer to his heart. Helps you to
[15:50] hear his voice. Hallelujah.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Where you might not have that if you
[15:53] weren't going through that particular
[15:55] trial. All things work together for good
[15:58] to them that love the Lord. I said all
[16:00] things work together for good.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; All things. Praise God.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Now, we also know that Michael was uh
[16:07] the leader of God's armies in heaven in
[16:09] Revelation 12:7. Honey, you want to pull
[16:11] that up there? And then there's other
[16:14] mentions of Michael, of course, where we
[16:16] see Michael is the is a winner of a war.
[16:19] This angel didn't lose. This angel only
[16:22] knows how to win.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, do you think he's going to win
[16:26] in the tribulation or not? Do you think
[16:28] Satan's going to be able to gather all
[16:29] the all the armies uh the uh the kings
[16:32] of the east and the kings of the north,
[16:33] Russia and China? Do you think that
[16:36] Satan's armies could possibly defeat
[16:38] Michael's armies? I'd say certainly not.
[16:41] If he beat him before, he can beat him
[16:43] again. Hallelujah.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. God will stand up for
[16:47] Israel. And I'm talking about the
[16:48] 144,000. Hallelujah. Not those that are
[16:52] uh abominable and so forth. Like like
[16:54] Paul said, not all Israel is Israel.
[16:57] Hallelujah. Only the elected, the ones
[16:59] whose names are in the Lamb's book of
[17:01] life. And last time I checked, that was
[17:02] about 1% of all the Israelis on the
[17:05] earth. 1%, hallelujah, will actually be
[17:09] saved. So think about that. 99% are
[17:11] lost. Only 1% is saved. Hallelujah. I
[17:15] would say the bride is less than that.
[17:16] We just passed eight billion people on
[17:19] the earth. I would say the bride is less
[17:21] than a tenth of 1%. Hallelujah. But
[17:24] either way, God's in the minority, but
[17:27] we are not alone. Although we're smaller
[17:29] number, we're not alone. As Elisha knew,
[17:31] we are encamped by angels that surround
[17:34] us. Praise God.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; God's angel armies are with us.
[17:38] Hallelujah.
[17:41] Now brother said now these minor angels
[17:43] perhaps he says and he says notice he
[17:47] said it's angels with us that comes to
[17:50] your humble servants. So brother says a
[17:52] minor angel comes to him in his in his
[17:55] we would say in his regular ministry of
[17:57] praying for the sick. Now did the Lord
[18:00] Jesus meet him? Yes. To open the
[18:01] revelation of the seven seals. He told
[18:03] us that. He said the pillar of fire
[18:04] would be there and show him the vision
[18:06] of the meaning of of the seal. He'd have
[18:08] to write it down as long as the pillar
[18:09] of fire was there and spend the rest of
[18:11] the day searching it out to make sure
[18:14] the revelation came from the Bible.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, that's probably a minor
[18:20] angel, but when Gabriel comes, brother,
[18:23] that's something really on the road.
[18:25] Something major going to happen." I'll
[18:27] say it like this. When Michael comes,
[18:29] something major is going to happen. A
[18:32] prophet's going to be resurrected.
[18:34] Hallelujah.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The dead in Christ will rise
[18:37] when Michael stands up. Hallelujah.
[18:39] Amen. And when he comes back at
[18:41] Armageddon, uh the entire armies of the
[18:43] world will be defeated because Michael
[18:46] standing up for his people. Hallelujah.
[18:49] 144,000 will receive the baptism of the
[18:51] Holy Ghost. Because Michael's there
[18:53] standing up for the people of God. No
[18:56] weapon that's formed against them shall
[18:58] prosper. Hallelujah.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Because God will send his angel to
[19:01] protect his people. Glory.
[19:04] My something major is on the road. Now,
[19:06] brother says this, I don't understand
[19:08] this, but he says, Gabriel announced the
[19:09] first coming of the Lord Jesus, and
[19:11] Gabriel will announce the second coming
[19:13] of the Lord Jesus. So, I don't know if
[19:15] that's already happened or not. I don't
[19:17] know, and I don't have a scripture. I'm
[19:19] just reading you the quote. Amen.
[19:21] Hallelujah.
[19:23] So, we see Revelation 12:7. Let's read
[19:24] that, hun again, just to show what a a
[19:27] warrior Michael is, uh, by the grace of
[19:29] God. Then, we'll go to Daniel 10. And
[19:31] there was war in heaven. Michael and his
[19:32] angels fought against the dragon. And
[19:34] the dragon fought against uh fought and
[19:36] his angels. Let's do the next one here.
[19:38] By God's grace, and prevailed not,
[19:40] neither was their place found anymore in
[19:43] heaven. So, I like that that Michael
[19:45] keeps the place of the angel. Michael's
[19:48] going to keep the place of the Jewish
[19:50] people, the real Jews. Michael's going
[19:52] to keep the place of the dead in Christ.
[19:54] Hallelujah. In other words, God has a
[19:57] protection for his people. Every true
[20:00] believer is gonna their place is going
[20:02] to pro be protected by the angel of the
[20:04] Lord.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And church, you and I
[20:08] have a position in Christ. The Bible
[20:11] said we're seated in heavenly places to
[20:14] be kings and priests unto God. Let me
[20:17] say it like this. Who's going to keep
[20:19] you praising God? The angel of the Lord.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who's going to keep you
[20:23] praying? The angel of the Lord.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're going to help you
[20:28] keep your position so you don't fall
[20:30] away. You don't get cold on God.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; You don't leave God. You don't desert
[20:35] God. You don't go away like Judas or
[20:37] something like that. But you stay with
[20:39] God because the angel of God is camped
[20:41] around you to minister to your needs.
[20:44] Hallelujah. The Bible calls them
[20:45] ministers of flames of fire. Hallelujah.
[20:48] The Bible calls them deliverers. God's
[20:51] angel will deliver you so you can keep
[20:53] praising God so you can keep praying to
[20:55] keep you as a king and priest unto God.
[20:58] Hallelujah.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Like brother Rod said, he was this far
[21:01] from falling away. What kept him,
[21:02] church? The angel Lord kept him from
[21:03] falling away.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We read it last night uh
[21:07] with with Moses when he's pushed on the
[21:09] ark. Brother Ram said, "What protected
[21:11] that ark with all those crocodiles in
[21:12] the Nile?" Brother Ram said the angels
[21:15] of God were around him. And so when the
[21:17] crocodiles would come up, the angel
[21:18] would pull out the sword and they'd tuck
[21:20] tail and run away from Moses.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God protecting his children. God
[21:26] protecting the position of the believer.
[21:28] Hallelujah.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; God needed a prophet. So God uh sent
[21:33] angels to protect their position. God
[21:35] needs a bride. So he sent his angel pro
[21:38] to protect his bride today. Church,
[21:40] you're protected by the almighty hand of
[21:42] God and his angels. Amen.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; What a blessing that we have today.
[21:46] Hallelujah. Now remember Daniel 10:13.
[21:49] If you pull that one up there,
[21:52] we see Michael again.
[21:56] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[21:58] withtood me 1 and 20 days.
[22:03] So this is a particular angel. I don't
[22:04] know what kind of angel this is. I know
[22:06] earlier in the book there's a watcher
[22:07] angel. We'll get to that maybe next
[22:09] service, Lord willing. But this minor
[22:12] angel can only get to Daniel through the
[22:15] help of Michael the archangel.
[22:18] Hallelujah.
[22:21] He says, now
[22:23] he said, uh, the prince of Persia
[22:25] withtood me one in 21 days, but oh,
[22:27] Michael, one of the chief princes. Now,
[22:28] here we go. One of the chief princes.
[22:30] So, this makes it seem like there's more
[22:31] than one archangel,
[22:34] right? Because another word, another
[22:35] King James word for archangel would be
[22:37] prince. that great prince Michael,
[22:40] right? But lo, Michael, one of the chief
[22:42] princes came to the help came to help me
[22:44] and I remained there with the kings of
[22:46] Persia. Then that then down in verse 21,
[22:48] it says, "But I will shoe thee that
[22:50] which is noted in the scripture of
[22:52] truth, and there's none that withholdeth
[22:54] with me in these things, but Michael
[22:56] your prince." Hallelujah. Amen. So he
[23:00] have God had Michael assigned to get
[23:03] this revelation to the prophet of God.
[23:05] Oh, glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[23:08] There was an angel in heaven that God
[23:10] commissioned to get brother Brandham the
[23:12] word of God, the word of truth. Thus
[23:14] sayith the Lord for us. Hallelujah.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; And church, do you realize God sent the
[23:18] angel? You know, sometimes we seek
[23:20] revelation and all these things.
[23:21] Sometimes we want to know God's will.
[23:23] But did you know if God ever sent you an
[23:25] angel, he would he would tell you
[23:27] something in here?
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; So what does that encourage you? Just
[23:31] stay in here. Hallelujah.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Just look in here. An angel visit.
[23:35] Daniel said, "Look back to the
[23:36] scripture." If an angel angel visits,
[23:38] Brother Ram, look back to the scripture.
[23:40] If an angel visits us, it'll say, "Look
[23:42] in the Bible. Look for the truth."
[23:44] Hallelujah.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He's not going to add one
[23:47] word. He's not going to take one word
[23:49] away. Praise God.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:54] The archangel. Amen.
[23:56] So, that's all I'm going to say about
[23:57] archangel. Now, let's look at the cherub
[23:59] here or the cherubims. Uh, by God's
[24:01] grace.
[24:03] Now
[24:05] recently I preached on the throne of
[24:07] God. How many remember that a couple was
[24:08] it last month I preached on the throne
[24:09] of God? Now casea let's let's just
[24:12] review here briefly.
[24:16] Cherubam here. Let's look at this
[24:18] briefly. I kind of showed this when I
[24:19] preached on it. I don't know if you
[24:21] remember. Maybe you remember once you
[24:22] see it. Does anybody remember? Raise
[24:23] your hand. Does anybody remember? Okay.
[24:25] Couple. All right. Glory. Hallelujah. So
[24:27] I I did a little study on this. A
[24:29] brother, precious brother from Minnesota
[24:30] asked me, could you do a a teaching on
[24:32] it? And so I took a couple weeks and off
[24:35] and on tried to look at it. So man is
[24:37] three parts, right? Now we know Larkin
[24:40] Larkin had these wrong. Brother Ram
[24:41] straightened it out. Soul is the
[24:43] innermost part. Uh spirit, mind, and
[24:46] then body. And so Moses Moses saw Moses
[24:50] saw this in heaven, right? And he copied
[24:52] it. But we know man is the temple of the
[24:54] Holy Ghost as well, right?
[24:56] But Moses saw this in heaven. And Moses,
[24:58] there was a outer court, holy place, and
[25:01] holiest of holies. Hallelujah.
[25:04] And remember the cherubam were right
[25:06] seated. They were connected to the mercy
[25:09] seat. Hallelujah. So, brother makes a
[25:12] statement. He said cherubam are
[25:14] interested in humans.
[25:17] Now, this could open up a whole another
[25:19] angle, but I've I've consider this. It's
[25:22] possible your guardian angels are
[25:24] cherubam. It's possible. You can't rule
[25:27] that out.
[25:29] because of this.
[25:31] Now, I just I just what I taught you is
[25:32] I said, "Well, there's possibly a
[25:34] separate group of angels called
[25:36] ministering spirits, right? That are
[25:37] guardian angels, but there's also a
[25:39] possibility that our guardian angels are
[25:42] cherubam because your throne, I'm sorry,
[25:45] your heart is also another throne of
[25:47] God."
[25:49] And what do the cherubam do? They sit on
[25:52] the throne. Hallelujah. and they're face
[25:56] in to the presence of God, right? The
[25:59] two cherubam face each other, their
[26:01] wings touch, and they're there looking
[26:03] in to the mercy seat. And the mercy seat
[26:07] is where God's presence dwells. And
[26:10] there's also blood. So, the worshipper
[26:12] can talk to God and be accepted. Without
[26:15] blood, no communion. Hallelujah. Without
[26:19] blood, no fellowship.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Thank God we've got the blood of Jesus
[26:23] Christ today. Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; This is why some people can't have
[26:27] communion with God or they can't learn
[26:29] the things of God because they've never
[26:31] let the blood be applied to their lives.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; They say, "I don't know what God wants
[26:35] me to do or I I I can't find the will of
[26:37] God." I'm talking about people that can
[26:38] never find it. Never. Right? They might
[26:41] come to church and all these things, but
[26:42] they can never find it. It's because the
[26:44] blood must be applied.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; And that only comes by repenting of all
[26:50] your sins.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And not not on a list but just God you
[26:53] know everyone forgive me and to really
[26:56] mourn over your sin.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:00] So there is a possibility that your
[27:03] guardian angel is a cherub. It's very
[27:06] possible because cherub were right on
[27:08] the mercy seat in the very presence of
[27:11] God. Hallelujah. Now Moses what Moses
[27:14] saw some something in heaven very
[27:16] similar the sacrificial altar and
[27:19] brother Ram tells in the fifth seal the
[27:21] Jews which this this makes perfect sense
[27:23] the Jews since the days of Jesus that
[27:26] rejected Christ but were saved and kept
[27:28] the law he said the Jews are under the
[27:30] altar crying how long oh Lord Ram said
[27:33] the Holocaust victims there the true
[27:35] Jews that 1% I'll say like that right
[27:38] that's how it is for every every nation
[27:40] right just barely few saved he said the
[27:42] Jews accuser under the sacrificial altar
[27:44] crying, "How long, oh Lord, holy and
[27:46] true, dust thou not avenge our blood
[27:48] upon the face of them on the earth?"
[27:50] Right? But the Lord comes back and says,
[27:53] "There's still a number of brethren that
[27:55] must give their lives." So this is a
[27:58] beautiful picture. Israel can't come
[28:00] into here because they they're blinded
[28:03] to the Messiah. They were never truly
[28:06] under the blood of Jesus
[28:08] &gt;&gt; because God had to blind them because
[28:10] they rejected him and he had to take a
[28:12] gentile bride. Ah,
[28:14] &gt;&gt; but in here, but in here in the throne,
[28:17] we see 24 elders, hallelujah,
[28:19] surrounding the throne. And they're
[28:21] they're joining the the cherubam crying,
[28:23] "Holy, holy is the Lord all Lord God
[28:26] Almighty, all glory, power, dominion,
[28:29] might." Hallelujah. So we see people
[28:31] here, we see people out here. So people
[28:33] that are in here, they've accepted the
[28:36] blood of Jesus Christ. They've repented
[28:38] of their sins. They know Jesus as their
[28:40] Messiah. So in one way spiritually, the
[28:43] blood or the spirit of God's been
[28:45] applied to our hearts. May we repent of
[28:47] our sins, church. Each and every one of
[28:49] us repent fully of all of our sins that
[28:51] the spirit of God can be applied to the
[28:53] throne of our hearts.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this is where the Bible
[28:58] picks it up and shows there's four
[29:00] cherub.
[29:02] Hallelujah. The Bible calls them beasts
[29:04] or living creatures as well, which we'll
[29:05] look at here today.
[29:08] There's four beasts or four living
[29:10] creatures that are around the throne.
[29:12] Hallelujah. Now, don't leave out this
[29:15] holy place there, right? Prayers. You
[29:17] got to pray. If you want the Holy Ghost,
[29:18] you really got to learn how to pray.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just, Lord, bless the
[29:22] food and Lord, I lay me down to sleep,
[29:24] but really pray, pour out your heart
[29:26] before him in love. Hallelujah. Really
[29:28] die out to yourself. Brother Abraham
[29:30] says, of course, a sea of glass in there
[29:31] as well. That's connected. We see that
[29:33] revelation with the uh Israel as well
[29:35] because they have the song of Moses
[29:37] around the sea of glass. So notice
[29:38] Israel not able to go in because they
[29:41] didn't accept the blood of Jesus Christ.
[29:43] All right. Now that's just a very
[29:44] general statement there.
[29:47] Now, for some reason, I emphasized this
[29:49] holy place in here. Uh I'm not sure why
[29:52] I did that, but anyways, a closer look.
[29:53] You get a closer look at the throne of
[29:54] God, the rainbow, the lamb. Uh and you
[29:56] have the four cherub there by God's
[29:59] grace.
[30:00] I'm just going to give you some visuals
[30:01] and we're going to read about these
[30:02] here. Now, I made that just with AI.
[30:04] That's a chat GTP uh and just took my
[30:07] words and tried to make it there. I was
[30:08] just trying to show how uh the throne of
[30:11] God has has brother said it's moved,
[30:15] right? It's moved or it's been different
[30:17] places. So, here in in the garden, there
[30:19] was a throne of God. There was a tree of
[30:21] life. Hallelujah.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Right? And we know that was the spirit
[30:24] of Jesus. Satan was the tree of
[30:27] knowledge and good evil. Hallelujah.
[30:30] That's a deep revelation there. Now,
[30:32] when Adam and Eve sinned, the Bible said
[30:34] in re or Genesis 3 that God placed
[30:37] cherubam there to guard the way of tree
[30:40] of life.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; And I read this morning, brother Random
[30:43] said, "This is where Cain and Abel would
[30:46] go to worship God." Amen. Doesn't that
[30:48] make perfect sense? There's cherubam
[30:51] protecting the presence of God.
[30:54] So this is where Cain and Abel would
[30:56] come and Abel would slice the the throat
[30:59] of the lamb, let the blood bleed out and
[31:01] God would somehow vindicate that
[31:03] sacrifice, but Cain would just bring uh
[31:06] fruit, right? Or or vegetables or
[31:09] something like that. It wasn't blood,
[31:12] but this was the place of worship. So
[31:15] again, we see connected, we see blood
[31:17] and God's presence, and we see cherubam.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. always connected. They're
[31:24] always connected. So, this was the
[31:25] throne of God on earth. Brother Ram
[31:28] calls them throne guards. Another word
[31:30] is zoom in the Greek. You'll hear
[31:32] brother say zooms or I'm sorry, zoo with
[31:35] an n. Zoom. How many heard that? 1961
[31:38] the revelation series. Brother preach
[31:39] that. Zooms. He called them living
[31:42] creatures. But here, look. We see man,
[31:44] God, the throne of God, cherubam, blood,
[31:48] worship. That's where God's presence
[31:51] was.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Now Moses built this and he said in
[31:56] Exodus 25:22,
[31:58] "And there I will meet with thee and I
[32:00] will commune with thee from above the
[32:02] mercy seat from between the two
[32:03] cherubams which are upon the ark of the
[32:05] testimony of all things which I give
[32:07] thee in commandment unto the children of
[32:10] Israel." Amen. So anything God was going
[32:12] to speak to them, it's going to be
[32:14] between the cherubam. Oh, hallelujah.
[32:17] Anything God reveals to you, it's going
[32:19] to be on the throne of your heart.
[32:21] Praise God.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; I love that verse. I think it's in uh
[32:24] Acts chapter 7 where Stephen, he's not a
[32:26] preacher, but he's uh rebuking the
[32:28] Pharisees that are about to stone him.
[32:30] And he says, "When Moses was about 80,
[32:32] the Bible says it entered into his heart
[32:35] to visit his children, his brethren."
[32:37] And I love that. Where did it enter,
[32:39] church? Where did the word of God enter
[32:40] Moses? Into his heart. The throne of
[32:43] God.
[32:45] So see church, you may not hear voice of
[32:47] God. You might not hear the voice of
[32:49] Jesus. You might not hear the voice of
[32:50] the angel, but when God speaks to you,
[32:52] he's going to speak to the throne of
[32:54] your heart at times. You've heard people
[32:56] say, "I just got a burden on my heart
[32:58] for this. I've got a burden on my heart
[32:59] for that." Many times I preach it just
[33:01] cuz I had a burden on my heart. And
[33:02] someone will say, "That's exactly what I
[33:04] needed to hear."
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Because God speaks to us from the throne
[33:08] of our heart.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; How do we know? I don't know. It's just
[33:11] a presence on my heart. Amen. It's just
[33:14] God place something there. In other
[33:15] words, God's presence is there and it's
[33:18] urging me to do something. Amen.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So may we keep our heart
[33:22] holy for Jesus. Not let anything get
[33:25] upon the throne of our heart. Amen.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Not let any idols in. Don't let any
[33:29] idols in. Don't give anything else your
[33:31] heart. Don't give it to Delilah. Praise
[33:33] God. Don't be like Samson. Give God both
[33:35] your strength and give God your heart.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:42] the days of Moses again the high priest
[33:45] would offer. Now, he doesn't have on the
[33:47] urum, so I'm not sure. It must not have
[33:49] been a complete picture. But anyways,
[33:51] you have the throne guards there. So,
[33:52] blood had to be there. Blood had to be
[33:54] there. Hallelujah. The blood brought the
[33:58] fellowship between God and man.
[34:02] And church, you're here today. Why?
[34:04] Because you want fellowship with God.
[34:07] And it comes by the blood of the lamb.
[34:10] It comes by the Holy Spirit communing on
[34:13] the throne of our hearts.
[34:16] So, let's be sensitive to what the Holy
[34:17] Spirit is putting on our hearts today.
[34:20] Amen. Now, again, I'm just showing the
[34:22] picture as a review there with the uh
[34:24] the three furniture elements in the in
[34:26] the holy place before they move into the
[34:28] holiest of holies. So, here the here
[34:32] Israel is divided into four camps. Those
[34:34] four camp represent the four cherubam up
[34:36] in heaven. Hallelujah. Because they
[34:39] surround the presence of God. All right,
[34:42] everybody see that? And of course, each
[34:44] one had four flags uh with the four uh
[34:47] three animals and the one human head,
[34:49] right? The the wisdom of man.
[34:51] Hallelujah. So, those are connected to
[34:54] each one of the camps. And these
[34:56] represent cherabs. Hallelujah.
[34:59] Brother Brandon calls them throne
[35:00] guards. Then we see them in Revelation
[35:01] chapter 4. Just another artist picture.
[35:03] I love these artist pictures. Amen. Just
[35:05] makes me long for heaven. Hallelujah.
[35:07] Makes me wish I could draw like that.
[35:08] Amen. Uh just how beautiful it's going
[35:11] to be. And uh imagine the glory of God
[35:13] in the presence of God. And the Bible
[35:15] said angels surround the presence of
[35:17] God. Hallelujah. Around the throne. But
[35:21] there's four in particular, cherub that
[35:24] are around the throne of God. Again,
[35:27] another picture say same idea here. 24
[35:29] here. You see the 24 elders and you see
[35:32] the four beasts around the throne of
[35:33] God. Now, brother Ram says those two uh
[35:36] I'm sorry, the two throne guards
[35:38] revelation. I'm sorry. There's two
[35:39] revelations of the throne guards.
[35:40] Brother Ram said there's there's four
[35:41] anointings to the churches, right,
[35:44] throughout the seven church ages.
[35:46] Hallelujah. So, we know it was uh we
[35:48] know it was lion and then axe and then
[35:50] man and then eagle. So, we're in the
[35:53] eagle age. We're the only one that's
[35:55] flying up in the heavenlies which
[35:57] represents revelation and sight.
[35:59] Hallelujah. Amen. We're the only ones
[36:02] with the book revealed with thus sayaith
[36:04] the Lord.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. were the only ones that know the
[36:06] revelation of the mysteries of God with
[36:09] thus sayeth the Lord.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brother Ram said then
[36:13] these four cherubam they protect the
[36:15] book of acts and he gives us two
[36:17] examples.
[36:20] He gives us uh salvation and divine
[36:23] healing. This just a beautiful picture.
[36:25] Brother man said you can do this with
[36:26] every doctrine. Uh he said but he only
[36:29] gives two when he has time to preach it.
[36:31] So salvation and water baptism is in the
[36:34] book of Acts is connected to Acts 238.
[36:36] But baptism is protected. The water
[36:39] baptism of Acts is protected by all the
[36:41] four gospels.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John says there's much
[36:45] water, not sprinkling when you're
[36:46] baptized. Luke says you're you get
[36:49] repentance and remission of sins in his
[36:52] name.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Jesus commands go be
[36:55] baptized. He whoever is baptized shall
[36:58] be saved.
[36:59] And Matthew speaks of uh being saved in
[37:02] Matthew 1 7 and 28:19. Go ye therefore
[37:06] and teach all nations baptizing them in
[37:08] the name of the father, son, and the
[37:10] holy ghost, which is the Lord Jesus
[37:12] Christ.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't you love that? Any truth
[37:15] God has, God protects it.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then the last one I have
[37:20] is brother said, divine healing is
[37:22] protected. Now, I could I preached on
[37:24] the book of Acts last year, so I could
[37:26] put lots of different verses in there
[37:27] like Acts chapter 3 when the lame man
[37:28] gets healed. Divine healing is protected
[37:31] by all the four uh gospels. Hallelujah.
[37:34] Matthew protects it when Jesus sends out
[37:37] the 12. Luke is another uh repeats that
[37:39] where Jesus sends out the 12. Now, all
[37:42] the the New Testament church is given
[37:44] power for healings and miracles in Mark
[37:47] chapter 16. And then Jesus said in John
[37:49] 14, "These signs shall follow them that
[37:52] believe." He said, "And uh the works
[37:53] that I do shall you do also."
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I think that's my last
[37:57] one. Yeah, that's my last one. Okay. So,
[38:00] I hope that was a helpful review. Is
[38:02] that helpful by God's grace? It's just a
[38:04] tie all together. Amen. Hope that's a
[38:06] help there since it was it was it was so
[38:08] fresh. It was so familiar to me about
[38:11] the throne of God. How cherubam surround
[38:14] the throne of God. Hallelujah. Now, we
[38:17] saw in Genesis 3:24, these cherubam had
[38:20] flaming swords on the earth. Hallelujah.
[38:24] And they were protecting the throne of
[38:26] I'm sorry, the presence of God on earth.
[38:29] And that's where Cain and Abel came to
[38:31] worship. Then we saw Exodus 25, God's uh
[38:36] uh communion or fellowship with Moses
[38:38] and Aaron was between the two cherubs on
[38:41] the mercy seat. That's where he dwelt in
[38:44] the days of Moses. Hallelujah. Now, I
[38:46] like Psalm 18:10. I like this one. Now,
[38:48] pull this one up here. This one is the
[38:50] one that makes me think perhaps our
[38:52] guardian angel or cherub. But again, I'm
[38:55] not sure, but this one makes me think
[38:56] it. What angel does God fly on when he
[39:00] comes down to rescue his people? The
[39:02] wings of a cherub.
[39:04] The Bible said, and remember this is
[39:06] thus sayith the Holy Spirit,
[39:08] &gt;&gt; right? And he rode upon a cherub and did
[39:11] fly. I love this. Yay. He did fly upon
[39:15] the wings of the wind. God don't have to
[39:18] use a cherub,
[39:19] &gt;&gt; but he gives the cherub a position.
[39:21] Amen. He gives the cherub a job because
[39:25] God loves his creation.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God don't have to use you. Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Despite all of our faults and our
[39:32] failures and our mistakes and the guilt
[39:33] and shame we go through, God don't have
[39:35] to use us, but he still uses us.
[39:37] Hallelujah.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; We're not worthy. That's why we must put
[39:40] on the white raignment today. Don't
[39:42] don't let that beat you up. Okay. If it
[39:44] does, repent of your sins. Get that
[39:45] white raignment back on. Praise God.
[39:47] Don't live in guilt. Don't live in
[39:48] shame. That's not what Jesus died to
[39:50] give you. He died to give you white
[39:52] raignment. Hallelujah.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Not stained up and guilty and bloody,
[39:56] all kinds of uh dirty raignment, filthy
[39:58] raignment. He died to give you white
[40:00] ramen. Hallelujah. He counseledled you
[40:02] to buy that. Hallelujah.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Remember, he he's the great counselor.
[40:06] Says, "You need to buy these three
[40:07] things."
[40:09] Now, thank God I've never went to a
[40:11] counselor, but if I had to go to a
[40:12] counselor, if that counselor said, "You
[40:13] got to do these three things and you'll
[40:15] make it," I'd surely do it.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; If the doctor said, "Go get these three
[40:19] things and you'll be healed of that."
[40:20] I'd do it in a heartbeat.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Now, what about Jesus offering us three
[40:24] things today? Amen.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Buy the gold, buy the white raignment,
[40:28] and make sure you buy the eyes.
[40:30] Hallelujah.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; If you do that, you'll be an overcomer
[40:34] in Leodysia.
[40:36] And you just won't be there at the
[40:38] resurrection. You'll be seated with him
[40:40] in his throne at the resurrection.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:45] Let me use Claude and Patrick since I
[40:47] saw them and they had a good soccer game
[40:48] yesterday. Now they lost, but they were
[40:50] really tried hard. You guys stand up
[40:51] here. Stand up. Come stand up here.
[40:53] Would you brothers do that? My pastor
[40:54] used me all the time when I was growing
[40:55] up. So he said, "Just come up." Okay. So
[40:59] I'm gonna use Oh, he's sleeping. You can
[41:00] stay there, buddy. You're his pillow.
[41:02] That's You stay right there, buddy. So
[41:04] cloth. Now here it is. If you overcome
[41:06] Leodosia, church, Jesus is seated on his
[41:09] throne. But then he'll have all these
[41:11] overcomers. This is the white throne
[41:13] judgment.
[41:14] Right now, just let's pretend he's
[41:16] sitting. He's not sitting, but let's
[41:17] pretend he's sitting. And Jesus will be
[41:19] separating uh the sheep from the goats.
[41:23] And a a goat will stand before him and
[41:25] say, "Well, Lord, uh I was a teenager in
[41:28] high school and and I I I I couldn't
[41:30] overcome. The temptations were too
[41:31] hard."
[41:33] Right? and he'll have all the excuses.
[41:36] And the Bible says the Lord will rise
[41:38] up. Rise up, Claude.
[41:42] And he'll be able to say, "I overcame
[41:44] high school temptations by the blood of
[41:46] the lamb and the word of the testimony."
[41:50] &gt;&gt; And the Lord will say, "Thank you. Be
[41:52] seated." Now, he can be seated. Let's
[41:53] give him a round of applause there,
[41:54] buddy. I say, you can be seated. He
[41:57] said, "Therefore, by the testimony of
[41:59] this believer that judges you unworthy.
[42:02] Depart from me, you worker of iniquity.
[42:04] I never knew you."
[42:07] So, see, church, you've got a you've got
[42:09] a purpose over there at Ken State,
[42:10] Sister Charlotte. Amen. You got a
[42:12] purpose. My wife went to Ken State, too.
[42:13] She's God could use her, too. Amen.
[42:15] Hallelujah. You got a purpose. There's a
[42:18] reason you are where you are. God wants
[42:21] you to overcome there.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God has equipped you to
[42:26] overcome. Amen. Just while you're there
[42:29] at Ken State or while you're there at
[42:30] Garfield High School, buy the gold, buy
[42:33] the white raignment. Hallelujah. And by
[42:35] the ice and you will overcome.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; It's impossible for you not to. Praise
[42:41] God. Because this is what Jesus requires
[42:44] as a counselor. Get these three things.
[42:47] Hallelujah. And you will overcome the
[42:50] wicked one.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, your heart will be
[42:55] a throne of God if you can just get
[42:58] these three things in Leodysia.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:04] So, getting back to this, God flies on
[43:06] the wings of Cherub. Now, I went through
[43:08] all 69. There's 69 mentions of cherub.
[43:10] Uh 68 in the Old Testament, one in the
[43:12] New Testament.
[43:14] And I tried to pick out the ones I
[43:15] thought might be a blessing.
[43:18] Now, it's interesting. Let's go to
[43:19] Ezekiel 10:2 just to get you a further
[43:22] picture of uh heaven. And church, I hope
[43:26] it makes you long for heaven.
[43:30] That's Ezekiel 10:1 and two. Then I
[43:33] looked, and behold, in the firminant
[43:34] that was above the head of the
[43:35] cherubams, there appeared over them as
[43:37] it were a sapphire stone, as the
[43:39] appearance of the likeness of a throne.
[43:41] Okay, so this is in the Old Testament.
[43:43] Now, something changed. I don't know
[43:44] what changed in the New Testament. Well,
[43:46] we'll get to that in just a moment.
[43:48] So there's cherub, but above the cherub
[43:50] is a throne. That sounds really good.
[43:53] Jesus is the high high exalted one. High
[43:56] lifted up. Nobody's higher than Jesus.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like that. Amen. The
[44:00] cherubam are high, but there's a throne
[44:02] still higher.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the king of the universe.
[44:06] Amen. Verse two. And he spake unto the
[44:09] the man clothed with linen. He said, "Go
[44:11] in between the wheels, even under the
[44:13] cherub, and fill thine hand with coals
[44:15] of fire from between the cherubams,
[44:19] and scatter them over the city." And he
[44:22] went in in my sight. So I want you to
[44:26] notice this. The reason I bring this out
[44:27] is to show you the coals are not far
[44:30] from the cherub. But then what else is
[44:32] there? Saraphim.
[44:34] Saraphims are the ones with the coals.
[44:37] And friends, even saraphim have
[44:39] interaction with human, right? Because
[44:42] they interacted with Isaiah.
[44:44] And what did they do for Isaiah? They
[44:46] cleansed him from his filthiness. He
[44:49] said, "I'm a man unclean of unclean lips
[44:52] and I dwell amongst unclean people." God
[44:54] said, "I've got a remedy. I'll send a
[44:56] seraraphim with a coal of fire. I'll
[44:58] send holy fire to clean out your mouth
[45:01] and make sure you say the right thing."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Amen. So, not only are
[45:07] cherubam interested in humans to come
[45:10] down and save humans, as the Bible said,
[45:12] God rides on the cherub, but God also
[45:15] sends seraraphims to give us the spirit
[45:17] of burning to clean us out.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:25] Hallelujah. So, I want you to see this.
[45:28] You have the throne. Underneath that,
[45:30] you have cherubam. And not far from that
[45:33] are these coals of fire.
[45:35] heavenly fire. Hallelujah. God uses the
[45:39] heavenly fire, right, to cleanse his
[45:41] servants and send them out. Now, go down
[45:44] to verse 20 in uh Ezekiel 10:20. Here's
[45:47] where they're called living creatures.
[45:52] This is the living creature that I saw
[45:54] under the God of Israel. Amen. By the
[45:56] river Chabbar. And I knew that they were
[45:59] the cherubams. Hallelujah. Don't you
[46:02] love that? Amen. living creature under
[46:05] the God of Israel. So Ezekiel knew the
[46:08] God of Israel sits on the throne.
[46:09] Hallelujah. He's still the God of
[46:11] Israel.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; He's still the God of the Gentiles. He's
[46:15] still the God of the bride. Hallelujah.
[46:17] And I'll say this, he still sits on his
[46:19] throne.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And church, we can have
[46:22] communion with that God today.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; The God of Israel, the God of the
[46:27] Gentiles. Hallelujah. Those two becoming
[46:29] one. As uh Ephesians chapter 3 says, the
[46:32] great mystery, God breaking down the
[46:33] middle wall, partition between Jew and
[46:36] Gentile, making one man by the baptism
[46:38] of the Holy Ghost.
[46:41] So there, the Bible calls them living
[46:43] creatures in Ezekiel 10:20.
[46:46] But let's go back up to verse 14 and 15.
[46:49] Ezekiel 10:14 and 15. Here's where we
[46:51] get a little bit. This is the thing I
[46:53] don't understand about cherub, of
[46:54] course, as I mentioned. Verse 14 says,
[46:58] "And everyone
[47:00] had four faces, and the first face was
[47:03] the face of a cherub,
[47:05] right? Cherub. And the second face was
[47:08] the face of a man." Now, this should
[47:10] this should sound very familiar with the
[47:12] picture I just showed you, right? And
[47:13] the third was the face of a lion,
[47:17] and the fourth the face of a eagle. Now,
[47:20] that's very familiar, right? Cherub,
[47:21] man, lion, eagle. The only one that's
[47:23] missing is the ox.
[47:26] So, does the ox have a face as a cherub?
[47:28] I don't know. That would be the most
[47:30] likely guess that I would I would I
[47:32] would say if I'm guessing, but I'm not
[47:34] here to guess. I'm just showing you here
[47:36] the correlation. Ezekiel sees the cherub
[47:39] in heaven and they got those four faces
[47:41] that we're so familiar with.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, verse 15. And the
[47:46] cherubams were lifted up. That is the
[47:48] living creature that I saw by the river
[47:51] Chabbar.
[47:53] Hallelujah.
[47:54] So Ezekiel sees these high lifted up and
[47:58] he sees those four faces. And brother
[48:00] Ram said, John and Daniel and Ezekiel
[48:03] and Moses, Amen, they all saw the same
[48:06] thing in heaven. Hallelujah. Glory.
[48:08] Let's go to Revelation 4:6. Revelation
[48:11] 4:6.
[48:20] And before the throne there was a sea of
[48:22] glass like under crystal. And the midst
[48:23] of the throne around about the throne
[48:25] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[48:29] behind.
[48:31] All right, so future past, right? Verse
[48:33] 7. And the first beast was like a lion,
[48:36] and the second beast was like a calf.
[48:38] Now, maybe that's the face of a cherub,
[48:39] right? As Ezekiel 10 says, I don't know.
[48:42] And the third beast had a face as a man.
[48:44] And the fourth beast was like a flying
[48:46] eagle. And these four beasts had each of
[48:49] them six wings round about him. And they
[48:52] were full of eyes within, and they rest
[48:54] not day or night, saying, "Amen, holy,
[48:56] holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and
[48:59] is and is to come."
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So we see their
[49:05] whole life is surrounding the throne of
[49:08] God and giving God praise, saying,
[49:11] "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[49:13] Almighty." That's what our lives should
[49:15] be. Our lives bel should should say
[49:18] holy, holy, holy in everything that we
[49:21] do.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Because your heart is the throne of God
[49:25] as well.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] These are the same uh beasts, living
[49:31] creatures, the zoons, brother Brandham
[49:34] calls it. And the Bible said they had
[49:35] six wings there in Revelation. Each
[49:38] beast had six wings. And brother brother
[49:40] tells us what they are. I don't
[49:42] remember. Uh action uh service and
[49:46] humility I think are yeah action action
[49:48] service humility. Brother tells us
[49:50] brother said that's a real servant if I
[49:52] ever saw one.
[49:54] Amen. A servant in action right? A
[49:56] servant with humility. Hallelujah. That
[49:59] type of servant. That's what we need to
[50:01] be servants for our Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] Now
[50:10] I can't uh go further without mentioning
[50:12] the other chair we know Lucifer.
[50:17] Let's go to uh Ezekiel 28
[50:20] 14.
[50:26] Ezekiel 28:14.
[50:41] Now, we've already said he's like a lion
[50:43] roaring about seeking who whom he may
[50:45] devour. He transforms himself into an
[50:48] angel of light. So, he transforms
[50:51] himself like he's trying to bring some
[50:53] revelation or or bring some assistance
[50:56] or bring some help. He's not bringing
[50:58] anything but division.
[51:00] That's what he's bringing.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll say it. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:07] Amen. I'll have to amen myself a little
[51:09] bit here. That's okay. I know. Maybe I'm
[51:10] going along here.
[51:12] About 50 minutes. That's not too bad.
[51:14] Ezekiel 28:14.
[51:17] Now, actually, I'll go up to 12. I'm
[51:19] just going to skip down. It's a It's a
[51:20] compound prophecy of the king of Tyrie.
[51:23] Thou seals up the sum full of wisdom and
[51:25] perfect in beauty. So, nobody was more
[51:27] wise. Nobody was more beautiful than
[51:29] Lucifer.
[51:32] So, think about that, church. By the
[51:33] There's major angels, minor. Satan was
[51:36] the major of all of them.
[51:39] Nobody was more wise. Nobody was more
[51:42] beautiful.
[51:45] Church, consider it a blessing. If
[51:47] you're not the most beautiful or the
[51:49] most wise or the strongest or the most
[51:51] handsomest, consider it a blessing on
[51:53] your life.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:55] The Bible said not many great ones can
[51:58] receive the revelation of the gospel.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It is such a temptation to be the
[52:04] strongest or the the the handsomest or
[52:07] the prettiest, anything like that. It's
[52:09] such a temptation. Why? Because Satan
[52:12] recognizes that's how I was,
[52:15] right? And he tries to influence that
[52:17] person who so outwardly looks like they
[52:19] got everything together.
[52:22] My goodness. Let's be mindful of the
[52:25] battle Satan's fighting. Hallelujah.
[52:27] Let's let's turn him down at every one
[52:29] of his tricks. Brother Abraham says,
[52:31] right? And you turn him down with it is
[52:33] written.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, the Bible says, the
[52:35] Bible says,
[52:37] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[52:39] Now 13, thou hast been in Eden, the
[52:41] garden of God. Because Michael kicked
[52:43] him out right down into the garden.
[52:45] Every precious stone was thy covering,
[52:47] the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the
[52:48] barrel, onyx, jasper, the sapphire,
[52:50] emerald, and the carbuncle, and the
[52:52] gold. So, he's got a he's got an
[52:54] imitation gold. We don't want that kind
[52:55] of gold. We want the gold of Christlike
[52:58] character.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That's one thing Satan can't do. He
[53:02] can't live this word. Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; He cannot love God, church. We ought to
[53:06] be so encouraged that you love God and
[53:09] you can obey God. Satan cannot do that.
[53:11] Hallelujah.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; He cannot live the word of God. He
[53:15] cannot overcome his own sin and his own
[53:18] pride. We ought to feel so thankful if
[53:21] God's given us grace to overcome certain
[53:23] addictions in our lives. It proves we're
[53:25] overcomers. It proves we're not serving
[53:27] him. It proves we're serving Jesus
[53:29] Christ.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:33] Now, he has to obey what God says, but
[53:35] he don't like it.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; So, church, let's obey God and like it.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris,
[53:45] &gt;&gt; certainly. Yep. Yeah. Uh yeah, every
[53:49] person has free will. Yeah, brother Ram
[53:51] says that's and because God because God
[53:53] gives free will then nobody can condemn
[53:55] him on the day of judgment. But God even
[53:58] said though, God even says in Romans
[54:00] nine though, even if that's their
[54:01] argument, God said, "Well, can't the
[54:03] potter do whatever he wants with the
[54:04] clay? Who you going to tell God? Who's
[54:06] going to tell God he can't make
[54:07] something the way he wants to do it?"
[54:10] Right? So either way, and and I could be
[54:12] wrong. If there's no free will, that's
[54:13] fine, too. But uh Brother Bam says
[54:16] there's free will. The Bible says,
[54:18] "Choose you this day whom you may
[54:19] serve." The Bible lays because you chose
[54:22] this. Right? Uh the Danny Henry prophecy
[54:24] of brother Brandon because you chose
[54:25] this because you chose the harder way.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Right. So each one Yeah. I believe God
[54:31] gives free will and that works perfectly
[54:34] with predestination. Brother Ram says
[54:35] this in the message Thirst 65. If you
[54:37] want to listen to this thirst 1965,
[54:40] brother Ram said uh that God has to give
[54:42] free will, but he can predestinate
[54:44] because he knows what they're going to
[54:45] choose in their free will. So therefore,
[54:48] he can still predestinate
[54:50] because he knows what you're going to
[54:52] choose.
[54:53] Does that make sense, brother? He gives
[54:55] you a free will, but he's so great he
[54:57] can't be limited. He knows what you're
[54:58] going to choose. He knows you. He knew
[55:00] he knew you'd choose the message. Amen.
[55:02] He knew it. Hallelujah. And he he So he
[55:04] can do both. That's why we're not
[55:06] Calvinists and uh Armenianist,
[55:10] I'm sorry, Calvinist and Armenianism.
[55:12] Calvinist is like, "Oh, God. Uh it's all
[55:15] predestinated, all predestinated." Uh uh
[55:17] the the the ar I can never say that
[55:19] word. Armenium. Armenianism. Say it,
[55:21] honey. Armenian. Thank you. Thank you. I
[55:24] always appreciate you, honey. Armenian
[55:26] says you got free will. It's all free
[55:28] will. But brother says when you got two
[55:30] camps, the truth is right down the
[55:31] middle. Right. There is free will and
[55:34] there is predestination,
[55:37] &gt;&gt; right? Because if if you take the
[55:38] Calvinist, well, you leave out all these
[55:40] verses. If you take the Armenian, you
[55:41] lose out all the Cal the Calvin verses.
[55:44] So, we're not Calvinists. We're not
[55:45] Armenius. We're Holy Ghost fil
[55:47] Christians. My wife and I went to this
[55:49] supper two Saturdays ago where Malachi
[55:51] was playing the piano. And it it was
[55:53] just fresh. It was just it was just uh
[55:55] fresh for me to say it. Uh the man shook
[55:57] my hand right away. Uh his name was
[55:59] Marlon. He says, "So, what church what
[56:01] church are you a part of? And I said,
[56:03] 'Well, if I said, 'If there's anything
[56:04] that we're a part of, uh, most like it's
[56:06] like Pentecostal except we don't have
[56:08] tongues as the interpretation or tongues
[56:10] is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost,
[56:12] but we follow a prophet named William
[56:14] Brandom who restored the Bible back uh
[56:16] the revelations of God. I said, but just
[56:18] to make it plain, we call ourselves Holy
[56:21] Ghostfilled Christians.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; So, I went on this big long rant and I
[56:24] just I'm like, "Okay, I'll just say it
[56:26] the right way. We're just Holy Ghost fil
[56:28] Christians." Amen. And he said, "Okay."
[56:30] And he moved right on. I was like, I
[56:32] went to all that length just to get
[56:33] that. I was hoping he'd say, "Who's
[56:35] William Brandom?" Or, "You got a sermon
[56:36] or something like that." But it, you
[56:38] know, you try to explain what am I? I'm
[56:40] a Bible believing Holy Ghost fil
[56:43] Christian. Praise God.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know God sent a prophet
[56:46] named William Brandham with thus sayith
[56:48] the Lord. Praise God. But I will not be
[56:51] attached to any organization because
[56:53] organization is death. Hallelujah.
[56:56] And all those daughters will be thrown
[56:58] back into a bed with their mother, the
[57:00] mother harlot, and they'll be burned
[57:01] with fire. My goal is to give them an
[57:04] idea of what I believe, but not be
[57:06] attached to the mother harlot.
[57:07] Hallelujah. There's one mother I want to
[57:09] be attached to. That's the new
[57:10] Jerusalem. Hallelujah. That's all of our
[57:13] mother. Amen. The new Jerusalem.
[57:19] Glory.
[57:21] Now, Satan was in the garden. He's got
[57:23] that false gold. the workmanship verse
[57:25] 13
[57:27] of thy tabs and of thy pipes was
[57:29] prepared in the in the day that thou was
[57:31] created. So here we see the pipes and
[57:32] tabs tablets is like a tambourine. So he
[57:35] had some type of a tambourine instrument
[57:36] and then pipes like we see on a pipe
[57:38] organ.
[57:39] He had all this music ability
[57:44] and verse 14 thou art the anointed
[57:46] chair. Now that word anointed means
[57:48] overshadowed
[57:50] uh possibly mean wings. So in other
[57:52] words, uh maybe maybe Lucifer had the
[57:54] biggest wings of all of them, but he was
[57:56] the most beautiful and he was the wisest
[57:59] of all the cherub.
[58:01] Now George, does this surprise anybody
[58:03] that brother Ram would say cherub are
[58:05] interested in humans? Does this surprise
[58:07] anybody that Satan is interested in
[58:10] humans?
[58:12] He's interested in getting worshiped by
[58:14] humans.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Right? Because God created the cherubam,
[58:17] protect the throne of God. Uh bring the
[58:20] people into worship. Protect the word of
[58:22] God so God's people can worship. And
[58:24] Satan saw that and he wanted that
[58:26] worship.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:30] He wants the worship. So we must make
[58:32] sure all the worship stays with Almighty
[58:35] God.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Now there I told you about that letter
[58:39] that was sent out about me. Now this is
[58:41] more personal for our church but uh four
[58:44] pastors have called me on that or I'm
[58:45] sorry two have called four of uh two
[58:47] others have sent messages
[58:50] and they said brother Jesse I feel led
[58:52] to tell you this that I was uh God used
[58:56] me to bring a man into the message. He
[58:58] became my song leader.
[59:01] He said he faithfully served song leader
[59:03] for 15 years and then he turned on me
[59:05] with an accusation
[59:08] against me and he said I feel he said I
[59:11] thought this was about you brother Jesse
[59:12] he's from South Carolina he said I
[59:15] thought this letter was about you
[59:16] because it said Akran on it and he said
[59:18] I just called you to encourage you he
[59:20] said when I went through that it was the
[59:22] hardest thing I ever went through so I'm
[59:23] sharing this in kindness here
[59:26] &gt;&gt; that God has somebody who's gone through
[59:28] something you're going through
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] And he said, he said, "When this song
[59:34] leader came against me," he said, "It
[59:36] hurt so much, but then I reached out to
[59:38] other pastors and they they had song
[59:40] leaders come against them." And he said,
[59:43] "Brother Jesse, we've just found it in
[59:44] churches." He said, "It's not always the
[59:46] song leader. With Jesus, it was the
[59:48] treasurer,
[59:49] &gt;&gt; right?" In other words, Satan's going to
[59:51] try to And how many preachers have
[59:52] fallen away from the gospel?
[59:55] The brother's point was when certain
[59:57] people get power and they feel like they
[1:00:00] want more then there's divisions in the
[1:00:03] leadership in the church.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I just wanted you to call
[1:00:07] you up to let you know, be encouraged.
[1:00:09] You're not the only one who's had a song
[1:00:11] leader or a trustee, right, or a deacon,
[1:00:14] right? Or a treasurer turn against
[1:00:16] them." Hallelujah. And he said it was
[1:00:19] just like God. He said God was like the
[1:00:21] pastor in heaven and Lucifer was the
[1:00:23] song leader,
[1:00:25] right? And so what what broke up the
[1:00:27] heaven church? It was the song leader.
[1:00:30] Now I'm not saying that about what
[1:00:32] happened with our church. I'm not making
[1:00:33] anybody out to be the devil. But he just
[1:00:36] said that. He said, "Be careful to the
[1:00:38] people who are in leadership. Make sure
[1:00:40] you stay humble." And the church said
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; because he said Satan had all this power
[1:00:46] and all this influence and then all of a
[1:00:48] sudden it wasn't enough
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; and he wanted more. He wanted worship,
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; right? And we've all been part of
[1:00:56] churches for years. Some of us were
[1:00:58] raised in churches. I've seen it since I
[1:01:00] was raised. Uh there's always sa Satan's
[1:01:03] trying to battle the leadership. He's
[1:01:04] trying to get the pastor discouraged.
[1:01:06] I'll say like this. He's trying to get
[1:01:07] the song leader discouraged. He's trying
[1:01:09] to discourage the leadership. So,
[1:01:11] they'll want to quit and give up and
[1:01:12] then the sheep will be scattered, right?
[1:01:14] The sheep will be scattered from the
[1:01:15] shepherd.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about me. I'm talking
[1:01:17] about Jesus as the shepherd. But you
[1:01:19] have to have an earthly shepherd
[1:01:20] according to Ephesians 4:11.
[1:01:23] So, I just want to tell you church that
[1:01:25] whatever you're going through, there's
[1:01:26] somebody else who's gone through it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Take courage. Stand upon the word. Stay
[1:01:33] with the word of God. Know that God's if
[1:01:35] he himself has to ride down on a chair
[1:01:37] of him, he's going to come strengthen
[1:01:39] you. Praise God. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; He's going to help you out in your time
[1:01:42] of weary, your time of discouragement.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And church, I didn't know someone from
[1:01:47] South Carolina would think of me. I
[1:01:49] never even talked to the man, but he
[1:01:50] just saw me on YouTube, I guess, or
[1:01:52] something like that. And he just had it
[1:01:53] on his heart to tell me, uh, he said,
[1:01:56] "Just keep loving. Just keep showing
[1:01:58] love." He said, "Just keep standing for
[1:02:00] the word of God." He said, "God, just
[1:02:02] keep praying. God will take care of
[1:02:03] everything." How many believe that?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:08] Verse 14. Thou art the anointed cherub
[1:02:10] that coverth, and I've set thee so. So
[1:02:12] God, brother Chris, he just stepped out.
[1:02:14] God said, God knew he was the most wise.
[1:02:16] He was the most beautiful. God sent him.
[1:02:19] Brother Ram said he was the right hand
[1:02:20] man to fellowship.
[1:02:22] That's quite a statement.
[1:02:24] Satan was God's right-hand man to
[1:02:26] fellowship. See, you can you can see how
[1:02:29] that would be because he was the wisest.
[1:02:31] Who else could talk with God about
[1:02:32] theology?
[1:02:35] Now, it's a little bit of a joke, but
[1:02:36] you understand. Who else could talk to
[1:02:38] God? Who was the smartest of all the
[1:02:39] angels? Lucifer was,
[1:02:42] right? But he was that cherub. He was
[1:02:45] near the throne of God.
[1:02:50] He said, "I've set thee." So, thou was
[1:02:52] upon the holy mountain of God. Thou
[1:02:54] walked up and down in the midst of the
[1:02:55] stones of fire. Verse 15, "Thou was
[1:02:58] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[1:03:00] thou was created till iniquity was found
[1:03:02] in thee."
[1:03:04] And I think I'll stop right there. Oh,
[1:03:05] I'm sorry. Let's go to verse 17. Thine
[1:03:07] heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:03:08] beauty. Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[1:03:11] reason of thy brightness. He was so
[1:03:13] bright. Remember Isaiah calls him the
[1:03:15] son of the morning.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is called the morning star.
[1:03:21] And the church said,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Like Jesus the bright morning star, but
[1:03:25] the second brightest was Lucifer, son of
[1:03:28] the morning.
[1:03:30] He was so much like God, right? He was
[1:03:33] he was smartest. He was the the
[1:03:36] handsomest every everything most
[1:03:38] powerful most wise that made him think
[1:03:40] he was something and he tried to split
[1:03:42] the church and he succeeded taking a
[1:03:45] third of the angels right
[1:03:47] but this is Lucifer a fallen cherub
[1:03:52] church I'll just say it like this he
[1:03:54] fell from the presence of God he fell
[1:03:57] from the throne of God may God help us
[1:03:59] to always be a heart and soul that can
[1:04:02] be the throne of God let us always be a
[1:04:04] throne where the presence of God can
[1:04:06] dwell is what I was what I want to say.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm kind of mixing up my words
[1:04:10] there. I'm trying to get it across. In
[1:04:11] other words, Satan left the presence of
[1:04:13] God. May you and I always stay in the
[1:04:15] presence of God.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Glory. How do you do that, Brother
[1:04:19] Jesse? Repent. Hallelujah.
[1:04:22] Revive. Get it. Revival. Hallelujah. Get
[1:04:24] your first love back. Buy of Jesus.
[1:04:27] Those three uh three uh articles you
[1:04:30] need to buy for the Leodysian church
[1:04:32] age.
[1:04:33] Glory.
[1:04:35] Now,
[1:04:38] brother Bram said, I'm going to read the
[1:04:39] quotes now where he said they're
[1:04:40] interested in human beings. Brother
[1:04:41] Brham said, notice these cherubams that
[1:04:43] John saw must have been interested in
[1:04:45] keeping the tree of life. So, they must
[1:04:47] be interested in human beings. So, Satan
[1:04:50] is interested in trying to steal your
[1:04:51] worship. But the cherubams of God are
[1:04:54] interested in trying to get you to
[1:04:56] worship God. The angels of God are here
[1:05:00] to help you worship him.
[1:05:03] Hallelujah.
[1:05:08] Now, is that a good refresher? Let me
[1:05:10] take a pause. Is that a good refresher
[1:05:11] on archangels and cherub? It's been a
[1:05:13] while. It's been five years since I
[1:05:14] preached on angels, at least according
[1:05:16] to my records. Hallelujah. So, now let
[1:05:18] me uh bring this down to close. I'll
[1:05:20] preach an hour.
[1:05:25] Here's a thought I want to close with.
[1:05:26] Now, if you got your Bible, let's go
[1:05:27] back to the book of uh Matthew here.
[1:05:31] Matthew 4:11.
[1:05:37] Now, I'm going to go back to the Lord
[1:05:39] Jesus here. The Lord Jesus getting
[1:05:41] visitations from angels. Now, did a
[1:05:43] cherub visit him? Perhaps,
[1:05:46] right? Perhaps it was a cherub. We're
[1:05:48] not told this specific kind of angel.
[1:05:51] But let's read Matthew 4:11.
[1:05:55] Then the devil leaveth him, and behold,
[1:05:58] angels came and ministered unto him. Not
[1:06:01] just one angel, but angels came to
[1:06:04] Jesus.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he was hungry, right? How
[1:06:07] many Do you remember how many days he
[1:06:08] fasted? 40 days. Hungry, thirsty. He
[1:06:12] hungered all these things. Satan brings
[1:06:14] the three hardest attacks he could
[1:06:16] possibly bring on a hungry man. And even
[1:06:19] a man who's anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:21] as the Holy One of Israel. He brings him
[1:06:23] the three hardest temptation. Lust of
[1:06:25] the eyes, lust of the flesh, pride of
[1:06:27] life. Jesus overcomes every one of them.
[1:06:32] But there was virtue that went out of
[1:06:34] him in o in order to overcome. In other
[1:06:36] words, brother Chris, it took spiritual
[1:06:38] strength to overcome those temptations.
[1:06:42] See, church, that that's what we need to
[1:06:43] remember. In the moment of temptation,
[1:06:45] we have to call on God for strength.
[1:06:49] It takes strength. Let me say like this.
[1:06:51] We've all done it before. I'm sure we've
[1:06:53] all just given in to temptation without
[1:06:55] a fight. You don't have to say amen. You
[1:06:57] could just say ouch or something like
[1:06:58] that, right? Sometimes, church, we just
[1:07:01] give in without really putting up a
[1:07:03] fight. But that's not what Jesus taught
[1:07:05] us. Jesus taught us to fight with the
[1:07:08] word of God. As we preach on, we wrestle
[1:07:10] not against flesh and blood. Jesus
[1:07:11] taught us to get out the sword of the
[1:07:13] spirit and fight against the enemy and
[1:07:15] cast him down at all of his temptations.
[1:07:21] Now, think about this, church. Jesus
[1:07:22] withtood three of them. Sometimes we
[1:07:24] fall on the very first temptation
[1:07:27] because we're weak, right? We're human
[1:07:30] or we're not walking in the spirit. But
[1:07:32] I'll say like this, we can overcome
[1:07:34] Satan on the first one, but that might
[1:07:36] mean he come with a second temptation or
[1:07:38] even a third. If he left after three
[1:07:41] with Jesus, well, I think he would leave
[1:07:42] after three with us as well. But we got
[1:07:45] to be willing to fight and overcome. But
[1:07:48] I want you to see this. He fought with
[1:07:50] the word here. Hallelujah. And then
[1:07:53] after the trial, after he got the
[1:07:54] victory, after he overcame, God sent him
[1:07:57] angels to strengthen him. Hallelujah.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We saw that with Elijah. Remember
[1:08:03] a couple weeks ago, I preached on
[1:08:04] Elijah. We saw that with him. Hopefully
[1:08:06] you brothers able to live stream that
[1:08:07] one.
[1:08:10] But he was running for his life. He was
[1:08:11] suicidal. And he said said, "God, I'm
[1:08:14] I'm no better than my fathers. Take my
[1:08:16] life." And what did God do? God sent him
[1:08:18] an angel. Touch him. Get up and eat. Go
[1:08:21] back to sleep. Touch him again. Get up
[1:08:23] and eat again. Hallelujah.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; So, see, when you're discouraged and you
[1:08:28] feel like quitting and you feel like
[1:08:29] giving up, God's going to send you help
[1:08:32] because God is faithful to help his
[1:08:33] children.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which parent here if Lily
[1:08:37] needed help? Wouldn't don't you think
[1:08:39] Vang would do everything in his power to
[1:08:41] help out Lily?
[1:08:43] When my children need help, don't you
[1:08:44] think I do anything in my power to help
[1:08:45] them out?
[1:08:47] And if if that's how we feel naturally,
[1:08:50] how much more does God feel with a
[1:08:52] divine love? And then God promised, I'll
[1:08:54] never give you a temptation that you
[1:08:57] can't overcome.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] So after every major temptation, when
[1:09:07] you stand upon the word of God and you
[1:09:09] feel weak, God will send help. God will
[1:09:12] spend spiritual supplies from heaven.
[1:09:15] Hallelujah. Praise God. He'll send you
[1:09:18] an angel that can touch you and
[1:09:19] strengthen you. Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] And the last one, L, this is my last
[1:09:24] verse, then we'll do the Lord's supper.
[1:09:26] Luke 22. Well, we got to read our text,
[1:09:28] too. Luke uh 22:39.
[1:09:33] Luke 22:39.
[1:09:40] Here
[1:09:47] we see the Lord Jesus again getting
[1:09:49] visited by angels
[1:09:52] in the garden of Gethsemane.
[1:10:00] The Bible says and he he went I'm sorry
[1:10:02] he came out and went and as he was want
[1:10:04] to the mount of olives and his disciples
[1:10:06] also followed him. And when he was at
[1:10:08] the place, he said unto them, "Pray that
[1:10:10] you enter not into temptations." Let's
[1:10:12] pause right there. Brothers or sisters,
[1:10:13] when we feel temptation, the best thing
[1:10:15] to do is pray.
[1:10:18] Pray. Jesus said, "Pray so you don't
[1:10:21] enter. You don't fall into that
[1:10:23] temptation."
[1:10:25] So before you go yell at somebody or
[1:10:27] before you go to have some pleasure,
[1:10:30] before you do any of those things, pray.
[1:10:32] And the Holy Spirit will help you to
[1:10:34] overcome those temptations.
[1:10:36] Hallelujah.
[1:10:38] Pray that you don't enter into that.
[1:10:45] You know, like I told you before, my mom
[1:10:47] before every day we go to school, went
[1:10:48] to public school, she would always make
[1:10:49] us gather around a circle and pray as
[1:10:52] teenage boys. That was hard. That was
[1:10:53] hard to do. I wasn't a believer. It was
[1:10:55] hard to humble myself. But I just had to
[1:10:57] respect my mama because she'd been
[1:10:58] healed of cancer. And of course, she was
[1:11:01] our uh she was the only one in in the in
[1:11:03] the house. I had to respect her. Okay. I
[1:11:05] always had that respect for her. But
[1:11:06] what was she doing? She was praying for
[1:11:08] us so we wouldn't enter into the same
[1:11:10] temptation that other people would at
[1:11:11] the high school. Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] Pray so you don't enter into it. Verse
[1:11:18] 41. And as he was was withdrawn from
[1:11:21] them about his stones cast, he kneel
[1:11:24] down and prayed. Church, when was the
[1:11:26] last time you knelt down and prayed?
[1:11:28] Hopefully this morning.
[1:11:31] Look at this. Jesus and church. How many
[1:11:33] know brother Ram said this is when he
[1:11:34] really got the victory of Calvary. This
[1:11:36] was the victory of Calvary right here.
[1:11:38] He had to get his mind willing to accept
[1:11:40] Calvary.
[1:11:42] This is what eventually caused him to
[1:11:44] overcome the cross was prayer.
[1:11:50] So the the holiest man like brother said
[1:11:52] the holiest man in the holiest place
[1:11:55] goes through the most hardest
[1:11:56] temptation. And how does he pray? He
[1:11:58] gets down on his knees and prays up to
[1:12:01] the father.
[1:12:03] Now, how many of us now think about
[1:12:04] church, how many of us are ashamed to
[1:12:05] get on our knees here at church?
[1:12:08] How many of us are ashamed to maybe jump
[1:12:10] and shout and praise the Lord in a
[1:12:11] church service? Look at Jesus. Was he
[1:12:14] ashamed to get on his knees? No.
[1:12:17] In his most sincere moment, he got on
[1:12:20] his knees. And the B the Bible said
[1:12:22] about a stones throw from his his other
[1:12:24] apostles. He got on his knees. So we see
[1:12:27] church the way you approach God even
[1:12:30] with your body it's important it sends a
[1:12:32] message to God.
[1:12:35] Hallelujah.
[1:12:38] The way you sit even today the way you
[1:12:40] stand or uh the way you respond it tells
[1:12:43] a message about your life.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Didn't didn't those quotes from brother
[1:12:49] aren't those true? When the angel of God
[1:12:50] comes you weep or you cry. You praise
[1:12:52] the Lord. Right? And yet we we can also
[1:12:55] fight against that. We don't want to
[1:12:56] fight against that. We want to yield to
[1:12:58] that. Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Your soul is the throne of God and God
[1:13:02] visits his throne. Hallelujah. God
[1:13:04] dwells on the throne of our hearts.
[1:13:05] Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; See, there's something about this.
[1:13:13] He gets on his knees. Hallelujah. And he
[1:13:16] gets down and prays saying, "Father, if
[1:13:17] thou be willing, remove this cup from
[1:13:19] me. Nevertheless, not my will but thine
[1:13:23] be done."
[1:13:25] The greatest prayer that could be
[1:13:27] prayed, let God's will be done in my
[1:13:30] life, not my will, not what I want.
[1:13:33] Church, are we so selfish that we want
[1:13:35] our way? Or could we be so humble and
[1:13:39] accept God's way with our life?
[1:13:42] Let us not be selfish and have to have
[1:13:45] what we want in life.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Let us be willing to accept when God
[1:13:49] communes with us, let us be willing to
[1:13:51] accept what God wants in our lives.
[1:13:54] Amen.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; What does God want in your life? He'll
[1:13:56] tell you on the throne of your heart.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, especially the big ones
[1:14:01] are marriage, right? After salvation,
[1:14:03] second one is marriage. That's a real
[1:14:04] big one. So, I'm looking at my single
[1:14:07] friends here by God's grace. That you
[1:14:09] really must make sure you have the
[1:14:11] leading of God on that one. Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] So important
[1:14:17] to do the will of God, not your own
[1:14:19] will. Hallelujah. Verse 43. And there
[1:14:23] appeared an angel unto him from heaven.
[1:14:27] Hallelujah.
[1:14:29] Strengthening him. Hallelujah.
[1:14:33] Think about that, church. He was praying
[1:14:35] so sincerely, he was running out of
[1:14:37] strength.
[1:14:39] He was praying, "God, I don't want this
[1:14:41] to happen. God, I don't know why this
[1:14:43] has to happen." He was praying with so
[1:14:45] much strength that God has to send help
[1:14:47] to give him more strength. The Bible
[1:14:49] said he prayed three times this prayer.
[1:14:52] So he went back to God two more times.
[1:14:54] Lord, take this cup if it be possible.
[1:14:57] If not, then Lord, let me let me do it.
[1:14:59] Let let me do thy will, not my will. He
[1:15:02] needed strength to pray that church.
[1:15:05] Don't you know you need strength to obey
[1:15:07] God's word? You need strength from an
[1:15:09] angel to overcome temptation.
[1:15:13] Hallelujah. I don't know what you've
[1:15:15] been tempted with this week. I don't
[1:15:17] know. Or maybe this month. I don't know.
[1:15:19] But I know this. If you're praying and
[1:15:22] seeking God in the midst of your
[1:15:24] temptation and you feel weak, keep
[1:15:26] praying. God will send you strength to
[1:15:28] get you through that temptation.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; You don't have to fall.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to give in. You don't
[1:15:37] have to be defeated. You can overcome.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And being in agony, he prayed more
[1:15:46] earnestly. So he strengthened so he can
[1:15:48] pray more sincerely.
[1:15:50] and his sweat was as it were great drops
[1:15:52] of blood falling down to the ground.
[1:15:57] And it's not in here, it's in it's in
[1:15:59] Matthew, but the word uh the word about
[1:16:01] him in agony is the the deepest word for
[1:16:04] depression.
[1:16:06] So, brother Chris, Jesus knows what it's
[1:16:08] like to be depressed. If any man was
[1:16:10] ever depressed, it was the Lord Jesus
[1:16:12] right here in Gethsemane. So, nobody
[1:16:15] would be able to say on the day of pen
[1:16:16] or the day of judgment, well, I couldn't
[1:16:18] overcome depression. Jesus overcame
[1:16:20] depression,
[1:16:23] the oppression that he was to go and he
[1:16:25] knew he'd get his beard ripped out and
[1:16:27] uh slapped and spit on and the catine
[1:16:30] tails and beaten and nails through his
[1:16:33] hands and his feet. He knew all that was
[1:16:36] going to happen. Moses and Elijah came
[1:16:37] to talk to him about his decease.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; He knew what the scriptures said.
[1:16:41] Brother said he knew his place in the
[1:16:43] word of God. And so we got to know our
[1:16:45] place in the word of God.
[1:16:48] And this made him sweat drops of blood.
[1:16:52] The most agonizing sweat or of any type
[1:16:56] of a sweat or suffering. Our Lord Jesus
[1:16:58] went through it.
[1:17:01] But how did he do it? Through the power
[1:17:02] of an angel. Church, this tells me at
[1:17:06] your hardest time of life, God will
[1:17:08] dispatch angels to help you get through
[1:17:10] it.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] I don't know if anyone else us would
[1:17:17] say, "Well, right now is the hardest
[1:17:19] test in my life." I don't know if
[1:17:20] anybody would say that right now.
[1:17:23] If it is, well, take courage. The angel
[1:17:26] of God will strengthen you.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; But surely, church, we can all look back
[1:17:30] a year ago or two, five, whatever it was
[1:17:32] your hardest moment in life. What got
[1:17:34] you through that? It was the anointing
[1:17:36] of God that came upon you to strengthen
[1:17:40] you to get through those difficult
[1:17:41] moments.
[1:17:44] Now, a lot of us are younger, so let me
[1:17:46] just say this. It's likely your hardest
[1:17:47] days are to come,
[1:17:51] right?
[1:17:52] It's likely, and I didn't get any amens
[1:17:55] on that, which is understandable.
[1:18:00] Listen, church, but the longer, if
[1:18:02] you're younger, the longer you live,
[1:18:03] there's more tests you're going to have
[1:18:04] to go through.
[1:18:08] So, I just pray that the Holy Spirit
[1:18:09] would bring this to our remembrance,
[1:18:11] church, when we need it.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; When we're wrestling with God, what I
[1:18:16] don't understand this, what is
[1:18:17] happening? What do you want me to do?
[1:18:19] What's your will for my life? I trust,
[1:18:22] church, by God's grace, he'll bring this
[1:18:24] back to us to remind us that when we're
[1:18:26] tested with the greatest test of our
[1:18:28] lives, we'll look to Christ. We'll look
[1:18:31] to heaven for help and we'll receive his
[1:18:34] help and pass the test. Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] Hallelujah.
[1:18:42] Verse 45. And he rose up from his prayer
[1:18:44] and was come to his disciples. He found
[1:18:45] them sleeping for sorrow. He said them,
[1:18:48] "Why sleep ye? Rise and pray, lest ye
[1:18:51] enter into temptation."
[1:18:54] And while he yet spake, behold, a
[1:18:56] multitude, he that was called Judas, one
[1:18:58] of the twel, went before him, and drew
[1:19:00] near unto Jesus, and kissed him. Now,
[1:19:03] this is my last thought here.
[1:19:06] I've always thought about this.
[1:19:09] Notice notice the contrast between the
[1:19:12] Garden of Eden and the Garden of
[1:19:13] Gethsemane.
[1:19:16] In the Garden of Eden, sin entered
[1:19:18] humanity
[1:19:20] through the serpent. Right? In the
[1:19:23] garden of Gethsemane, sin was confronted
[1:19:26] and overcome through prayer.
[1:19:29] Hallelujah. In another garden. Isn't
[1:19:31] that beautiful? Hallelujah. One garden
[1:19:33] they fell. One garden Jesus overcame.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] Eden was paradise perverted. Gethsemane
[1:19:42] was a deep place of sorrow and prayer.
[1:19:45] Hallelujah. Amen. And that Gethsemane
[1:19:48] victory will bring us back to the
[1:19:50] garden. We'd say or the new Jerusalem,
[1:19:52] our future home, the heavenly city, the
[1:19:55] true paradise of God.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] In the Garden of Eden, man's will
[1:20:01] prevailed. In the garden of Gethsemane,
[1:20:04] God's will God's will prevailed.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; In the garden of Eden, temptation
[1:20:09] overcame. Hallelujah. In the garden of
[1:20:12] Gethsemane, temptation was overcome.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] Amen. In the Garden of Eden, death
[1:20:20] entered the world. Amen. In the Garden
[1:20:22] of Gethsemane, the remedy for sin began
[1:20:24] through Christ's prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:20:27] Amen. The garden of Eden was the
[1:20:29] presence of Adam. The garden of
[1:20:32] Gethsemane was the last Adam.
[1:20:33] Hallelujah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:36] The garden of Eden was separation. Adam
[1:20:39] and Eve hid from God. Amen. In the
[1:20:41] garden of Gethsemane, Jesus came to God
[1:20:43] and was united to God. Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; For the purpose of redemption.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] In the Garden of Eden, there was blood
[1:20:54] because the blood had to be a sacrifice,
[1:20:56] right? And even we know in the act of of
[1:20:58] the serpent and Eve there was blood. But
[1:21:02] here in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus
[1:21:04] sweat blood in order to make a way for
[1:21:06] eternal life. Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The garden of Eden was a a a life that
[1:21:11] brought death. The garden of Gethsemane
[1:21:13] was eternal life through the sweat drops
[1:21:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:21:18] Amen. In the garden of Eden, the curse
[1:21:20] began. Hallelujah. In the garden of
[1:21:22] Gethsemane, the curse was overcome and
[1:21:25] we become a blessing through the power
[1:21:26] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] The garden of Eden was the tree of
[1:21:34] death. The garden of Gethsemane was the
[1:21:37] tree of life, the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:21:39] I'll say like this, the mercy tree that
[1:21:42] followed the garden of Gethsemane, the
[1:21:43] cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The
[1:21:47] second Adam restores all that the first
[1:21:49] Adam lost.
[1:21:52] Romans 5:19, "For as by one man's
[1:21:54] disobedience many were made sinners, so
[1:21:56] by the obedience of one shall many be
[1:21:59] made righteous." 1 Corinthians 15:22,
[1:22:02] "For as in Adam all die, even so in
[1:22:05] Christ shall all be made alive." I hope
[1:22:07] somebody can say amen to that.
[1:22:08] Hallelujah. You're You live because
[1:22:11] Christ live, you shall live also.
[1:22:12] Hallelujah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Because of Gethsemane. Hallelujah. Yes,
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; because of what Jesus did in the garden
[1:22:18] to conquer sin and temptation and the
[1:22:20] curse and to become a curse that we
[1:22:23] might be blessed.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 15:45. And so it is
[1:22:27] written, "The first Adam was made a
[1:22:29] living soul. The last Adam was made a
[1:22:31] quickening spirit. And now that
[1:22:33] quickening spirit comes upon us." How
[1:22:36] many want that quickening spirit?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet by God's grace.
[1:22:39] Musicians can come as we prepare
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; for the Lord's supper.
[1:22:45] The last Adam is made a quickening
[1:22:48] spirit.
[1:22:50] Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts here as
[1:22:52] we approach the Lord.
[1:22:54] As we normally do at our church, so our
[1:22:57] sister Charlotte's aware, before
[1:22:58] communion, we do still take prayer
[1:23:00] requests. If anyone wants to come up for
[1:23:02] prayer, we still do that just in case
[1:23:04] there's special needs that people want
[1:23:05] lifted up.
[1:23:08] The Bible says the prayer of faith shall
[1:23:10] save the sick. call on the elders of the
[1:23:12] church, anoint the sick with oil, pray
[1:23:15] the prayer of faith, and God will raise
[1:23:16] them up. So, we want to be mindful of
[1:23:19] that before we start the Lord's supper
[1:23:21] today.
[1:23:25] Hallelujah.
[1:23:29] Lord, we thank you for the word of God
[1:23:30] today, Lord God.
[1:23:33] Thank you, Lord, for this.
[1:23:36] We'd say second garden, Lord God.
[1:23:42] Lord, you sent an angel to make sure,
[1:23:44] Lord God, that your son Jesus was able
[1:23:47] to overcome
[1:23:50] in his darkest hour, darkest trial.
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:24:00] Because the Lord got the victory over
[1:24:02] the battle of the mind, he was able to
[1:24:04] bring his body into subjection, taking
[1:24:06] the body to the cross to die for us.
[1:24:08] Lord God, what an overcomer. Lord God,
[1:24:12] thank you for sending your son to
[1:24:14] overcome
[1:24:16] temptation. Lord God,
[1:24:21] Lord, I just felt your presence, Lord
[1:24:23] God, on that statement there about
[1:24:26] in our greatest trial, may we pray and
[1:24:28] remember that there is help to get us
[1:24:32] through our greatest battle on this
[1:24:34] earth.
[1:24:36] If you send it for Jesus,
[1:24:39] you'll send it to each one of us. For we
[1:24:42] are the heirs of salvation. We are the
[1:24:43] children of God by faith.
[1:24:51] Lord, I'd probably say the hardest thing
[1:24:53] in my life would be maybe the divorce of
[1:24:55] my parents, Lord God.
[1:24:59] Certainly the miscarriages my wife has
[1:25:01] had, Lord God. Those been very trying
[1:25:03] times.
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] But Lord, if it be that the hardest
[1:25:12] moment is still in the future for me,
[1:25:14] Lord God, I pray this remembrance to me,
[1:25:17] Lord God, when I need it.
[1:25:22] That when I'm tested and tried,
[1:25:25] like Job said, I'll come forth as gold.
[1:25:31] I pray that for your people as well,
[1:25:33] Lord God.
[1:25:37] Lord, most of us are young here.
[1:25:42] If you Terry, Lord, if you Terry, many
[1:25:46] decades left.
[1:25:48] Tulsi is not even five months. Lord God,
[1:25:52] the average age of a worldwide is 73.
[1:25:56] Lord God, if you Terry, she would have
[1:25:58] about seven decades left of life.
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:02] But Lord, in those decades, in our
[1:26:04] lives, Lord, we have great hours of
[1:26:06] trial, hours of testing.
[1:26:09] We've got our Garden of Gethsemane
[1:26:11] moment, Lord God. And I pray, Lord, in
[1:26:14] our greatest battles, Lord God, we would
[1:26:16] be able to say,
[1:26:18] Father, let this cup pass from me.
[1:26:20] Nevertheless,
[1:26:22] not my will, but thy will be done.
[1:26:26] As I said, Lord, I don't know if the
[1:26:28] people are going through their hardest
[1:26:29] battle or not.
[1:26:32] Thou know us all things.
[1:26:35] You're faithful. You're watching over
[1:26:38] them. I pray if they are, Lord, I pray
[1:26:40] you'd ride the wings of a cherub today,
[1:26:42] Lord God. Come down and minister to your
[1:26:44] people. Deliver your people, Lord, in
[1:26:46] the midst of their trials, Lord God.
[1:26:49] Send your angel to minister strength,
[1:26:51] Lord God. strength so they can keep
[1:26:53] praying, keep worshiping as we said, be
[1:26:55] a king and priest unto God.
[1:26:58] That their heart would remain a throne
[1:27:01] unto God where your presence would dwell
[1:27:03] there and they would worship you.
[1:27:08] They'd pray to you, Lord God.
[1:27:11] They would praise your holy name for you
[1:27:13] are worthy.
[1:27:16] We thank you, Lord, for today.
[1:27:20] Thank you for the greater garden, the
[1:27:22] garden of Gethsemane. Lord God, thank
[1:27:25] you for these great works of restoration
[1:27:28] you did.
[1:27:31] For in Christ shall all believers be
[1:27:33] made alive. Thank you, God, for these
[1:27:35] promises. in Jesus Christ's name.
