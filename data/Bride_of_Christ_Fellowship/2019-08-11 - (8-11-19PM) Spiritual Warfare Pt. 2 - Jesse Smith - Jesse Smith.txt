[Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless the live streamers here God's grace god bless all the saints that showed up tonight by His grace happy to be in the house of more famous Asian chapter 6 verse 12 how this was such a good reminder this week I wasn't sure my little testimony how we prayed for that amen God given a good victory on the job so we're very grateful for that Lord really moved as we prayed so we thank the Lord for moving and that's the purpose behind this series just real briefly to look at the power of prayer for someone to children does have a good understanding of that as they grow up and remember this is the this is a ministry anybody can be called to every Christian is called this ministry so children when you feel burdened to pray for someone this is God calling you to be an intercessor visions six that's just our verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of his might but on the whole armor of God that you may both be able to stand against the wiles of the devil let's all reversible ready one two three blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that one more word of Prayer father in heaven we thank you for this word Lord we bread it break it to us now Lord God teaches Lord thank you for answering one prayer request this week lord as we cried out to you Lord and prayed for you to intercede we thank you Lord and they continue to teach us Lord to battle for your glory in the spiritual warfare in Jesus Christ it sure said look at I want to look at these four forms of evil that we wrestle with last week I was looking at it and it looked kinda look like levels like hierarchy levels but as I studied it this week it didn't really seem like that we know there are hierarchy levels but it seems like seems like because all these if you notice all these are plural so we look at Lydia people Ephesians 6:12 or blessed for the banking systems anymore bless you bless you James and Lily praise the Lord last we got these were kind of like four levels but as I look at this later as I studied this weed I looked at the Greek it didn't really seem like that because principalities is plural powers is plural and rulers is plural so as I looked at that it didn't seem like it was four levels anymore we know there are levels though last we saw the Prince of Persia last week there's the Prince of Greece show so we saw that last week in Daniel 10 so over these kingdoms were demons so I believe there's a demon over the United States programs there's fear on every Church on every nation and of course churches - if you're not born again but we're born again Jarrett came and so the Holy Spirit old rusted the Holy Spirit I believe that but there's a spirit over Russia there's one demon that kind of rule over then he's got little demons under him controlling but as I look at this I would just rather say this is four forms of evil maybe not levels but we know there are levels so let's look at each one and then we will look at all these and some there's numerous scriptures now we'll look at and now I'm going to end with a few scriptures on prayer just to remember or to remind us of the power of prayer that we have so being out here a little testimony brother amen was having a real bad work situation so we went to special prayer on Monday and Tuesday I went to special prayer in a prayer closet he said he got the victory on Thursday so I just wanted to thank the Lord for that so it took a little extra prayer and it seemed like and I was wrestling in the prayer clause I just tried to have faith and speak against the evil you know just speak against that and evil and claim the victory and so the Lord brought the victory by Thursday so I think the Lord for that and I think that's why I think that you know sometimes God allows that to teach us the very reality of this scripture that we're not wrestling against you know people on the job we're not resting against family members who don't believe wrestling against spiritual powers that that they are letting control them right like we saw this morning with with Jesus speaking to Satan like Lydia and I were talking about Jesus said get behind me Satan but he was speaking to Peter but still I say was on his right shoulder you know what he's right behind him Jesus was not speaking really to Peter but the spirit that was on Peter we'd say above Peter if you know just want to look at it as a as a image in your mind so let's look at these here and there's so what I did as I looked at each scripture each Greek meaning and then trying to find the most important scriptures that use the same work now first wrestle wrestle and the Greek means a contest to throw the other and it says it was decided and the Greek it was decided you know you had wrestled one when you were able to hold down your opponent and put your hand up on his neck when you had him by the neck and he was down and couldn't breathe anymore it's like today they do martial arts on TV and when they choke him out sometimes they cut off their breathing and that's when they that's when they win the fight sometimes that's kind of like this wrestling in the Greek when they had somebody down by the throat and they said okay no more I can't breathe then you wrestled and you want at that point because you can't breathe anymore that's what this wrestling means and then in the spiritual its our struggle with the power of evil okay so it kind of deals with the neck and your air right and that's interesting too is that interesting it just struck me remember the four kinds of grounds the third one was like the foolish virgin remember it got choked out there is the there's the same type of thing so see that that's why that's why we need to be wise virgins so our prayer life doesn't get choked out so Satan doesn't defeat us but we defeat Satan we've got the rests on the piece Satan by prayer and that's the only way we're going to overcome so children I want you to know that as you grow older the only way you're over covers from prayer you've got to pray I know mommy spent significant time pray I spent significant time pray every Christian should start your day or sometime early the morning started with prayer that's how you're going to get the victory because that's what you're wrestling your rest against all the spirits remember remember God told Cain he said if you do well great but if not what's laying at your door sin so as soon as Cain left the house was right there even powers ready there to battle him right now we know they can be in the house as well but God just gave that example if you don't obey the Word of God you're gonna open your door up to demons open your life up to demons okay so that's what we have to remember children as you get older you're gonna overcome through prayer wrestling that's kind of like when I was praying for a man I was just praying on my knees just I was speaking against the spiritual powers how we're working at his job okay any sick person I prayed for I'm wrestling against it right we've been listening to brother Rams life story - you just have to keep praying and rebuke the demon spirits and pretty soon they would leave so we have to remember that we got to keep trying we have to keep wrestling they have to do the wrestling match spiritually until we got Satan down by the neck then he then he goes because he's overpowered so there's power in prayer that's what we're praying for word from Jose as you pray this morning that God would give him the victory in his in his vision and also he's got pressure in his in his head so we need to keep praying for that and trust God to him the victory has been wrestling against the spiritual powers all right now the word principalities here means the first place the rule or majus magister Cena says so the Principality the rules so these are the rulers so against the rulers now there's a few good scriptures I want to get to personally of all up 2nd Peter 2:19 how did Satan even get power of course we know God allowed him to have power but how did he get power here's how Satan really got the power from Adam while they promise them Liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption but here's where we're getting to for whom a man is overcome of the saying he has brought bondage why is man under Satan's principalities because Adam gave over his power when Adam power when he was under the anointing of the Holy Spirit before he said he had all the power he had all the dominion over the earth right but then when he saw his life of that condition he saw a hard condition he said well I don't want to lose her I love her she's a part of me so I willingly partake of the fruit I'll partake of that and so what he did he was overcome that by sin and because he forfeited that from the power dominion over the earth it went over to Satan the one who overpowered it one overpowered him as well so that's how Satan got this power of principalities over the earth that's why he's boomer over the earth now remember Saint already had we looked at last week Satan already had power in heaven right a little bit of power because he includes the third The Devil's in there the angels and other devils he was able to slander God or he'd say Christ or might call him one you instead don't leave Michael is Christ though he was able to slander you know the Archangel Michael and maybe God on his throne he was able to slander and deceive a third of them to following him and he had this power and so then when he was cast down to earth he was able to find a way in to get the power of man on the earth that's how he did it now here's a beautiful scripture romans 8 37 and 38 so keep this in mind there's nothing that can separate you from the love of Jesus Christ now keep it in mind for your lost loved ones right or that your friends aren't serving God and children they may seem like they're so far from the love of Christ but remember the scripture they and all these things we as believers are more than conquerors through him that loved us next scripture prime for suena neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities so any high rulers any demons nor powers nor things present or things to come can separate us or shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord amen so see there's no reason to fear any demon or any scary movie or any scary feeling that you have because there's nothing that can separate us from the love of Jesus Christ the love of the Cross is so powerful that no demon can keep you from it if you want God's love and if you want to be loved by God there's no demon that can stand in your way and keep you from it but never be able to hold you know to keep you from it you if you just say I'm coming in on repent God forgive me of all my sins that demon has to move right out of the way and you can't go right the threats of God amen it only takes four pets because it's repent and be baptized and you shall receive of the Holy Ghost I need even a slide all you have to do is say that will get behind me I repent God forgive me my sins I'm trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ and there's God of you a Jesus is the way the truth of the life you knew you would be on the way to serve God amen that's just so keep that in mind that's beautiful now here's another come on let's go to Ephesians 1 verse 20 ephesians has a lot about this proceeding to 120 which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set it at his own right hand in the heavenly places look at this is beautiful far above all principality there's that word remember we wrestled we're wrestling against principalities but where is Christ Christ is way far above that amen so see your prayers we may not be like each other but if we believe and we really trust God and we have no sin our lives our prayers go far above that layer of demon principalities everything with me because it basically the demon powers is the fifth dimension right because you have the third dimension is everything we see taste touch feel smell here the fourth dimension is the invisible you know Internet waves and TV waves and sound waves and all these things but the fifth dimension is that demonic dimension that's the Principality six dimension is the believers seventh dimension is a throne of God Revelation chapter four and five gives us great picture that so the Bible says God Christ is the seventh the dimension is far above the t-nut demonic dimension and our prayers go far above that amen hallelujah remember day you remember Daniel sprayers they went far above all those demon powers but the answer came down by an angel he came down that fifth dimension a wrestle three weeks and then Michael came it helped about have brought the ensign amen so we got to keep believing children keep praying because our our God is far above all that and then he can send out the health through this spiritual layer of demonic power he's far above all principality power Mike Dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also and that which is to come amen children if you ever have any fear if you ever fear any spirit just speak the name is used to say the name of Jesus Christ because it's every day he's far above every name that's name whether it's fear whether it's discouragement whether it's depression whatever demon power you're feeling just speak the name of Jesus Christ and this far above any principality and he named it to be Nick praise God all right now so get a couple more here now before I move on here oh yeah let's watch this - 14 - 14 and the only bar that's me now here's what Christ did he blotted out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross all right that's good patina and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it what is good sure how they do you so jesus spoiled or robbed and remember how did that how did he rob honey spoiled principalities and powers he went down to the heart of the earth and took all the believers away from the heart of the earth it's how he spoiled it because spoiling is robbing out of Jesus Rob the devil but the devil had he had he had dominion over all the believers because they were under the blood of Jesus yet until he came in shed his blood so he come down there and we know he took the keys of death and hell you kicked over Satan's door right he spoiled all this all his believers he took all those believers and he also took the keys of death and hell and then he tried to over them when he walked on the earth and all those Saints were seen by people all over there it was a triumph amen there's a great parade and Jesus by his own blood and triumph over the enemy and he's showing the hopefully triumphing over them in it now I want to look at a few more scriptures let's go to book of John maybe I'll get there in just a minute let me put this truth yeah John 12:31 now I don't know if this is exactly right but this is the way it seems like it is it's like Satan before them the bat I'm sorry before the crucifixion of Christ it's almost as if Satan had up had that list of ordinances against us it's almost like Satan had a list of complaints against us but then the Bible said Jesus nailed that to his cross so there was a spiritual nailing of those sins that we had to the cross because look at the look of Jesus says he know he doesn't get crucified - later I think a chapter 18 or 19 Jesus says now is the judgment of this world now shall the Prince of this world be cast out hey man so see the Prince of this world is Satan so somehow Jesus going to Calvary Satan would be cast out so almost as if we and this is the same time where the Bible said Jesus would crush or bruise the head of the serpent right but Jesus's he would be bruised so this is almost a casting out of Satan's power or the casting out of Satan's proof that he had power over us or maybe his his write to us right in Satan's right to keep Daniel in the heart of the earth Satan's right because the blood of bulls and goats never really forgave them right so he had a right to kind of keep them in the heart of the earth but when Jesus brought his own blood now the power of Satan was cast out amen and now these Saints can come right up to heaven amen that's beautiful to see that the Satan's power any power that he had to influence and try to accuse the Brethren was no longer there that power was cast out amen John go to John 16 11 there's another powerful scripture but not only is Satan and his accusations cast out which means it doesn't hold a place before God anymore now the Bible said that Satan's already judged a men of judgment because the prince of this world is judged praise God so see like the Bible said like the Bible said Jesus said in Moses and just as Moses lifted up the brass surf or the wilderness yeah so shall the Son of Man be lifted up as well and that brass serpent represent that sin was already judged in other words the payment for sin has been money paid amen so Satan is judged because all the all the wrath for sin has been paid amen it's argument baby Jesus took the penalty for sin so there's no more penalty for sin for the believer because jesus paid the price amen he prints the worldís cash now the prince of this world is judged that's why Jesus that's 1,000 Jesus is far above all principalities and powers than men because he's already cast out all his accusations against the believer his claim on people on the Old Testament Saints and those Saints who were yet under the blood Jesus Christ Jesus Jesus but paying the price and the Prince of this world is judged a mentum yeah there's a great change right there's a great change that happened in Calgary the transition from the Old Testament the New Testament remember the veil kept everybody on the Friends of God now we go right the prints of God they had nothing can keep us out it's not just one man once a year the high priest but now that Satan's medicines been judged and since been paid for and now the believer by repentance can go right the presence of God amen the windows of heaven are open they men hallelujah we just got a heap Ranger children we got to keep praying and keep wrestling against these spiritual wickedness and not give up that's what Satan wants us in he wants us to give up but we can't give up we got to keep offering prayer and keep wrestling until we can get the stranglehold on the devil praise God amen yeah that's right now let's go to the next one so that was principalities now powers the powers means one who possesses authority or a ruler someone who is the leading or more powerful one created beings superior so here we see we have to wrestle against Satan's authority or anyone who has power over someone else we have to be able to wrestle against them so let's look at a few scriptures of this year wrestle against principalities and powers so let's look at a few parts go to Luke 4 5 Luke 4 5 this is Jesus temptation we look at this this morning a little bit and the devil taking him into an high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and he said to him all this power would I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and who saw her I will give it if therefore thou will worship me all shall be thine now we see here we wrestle against the power so we wrestle against you go back to verse four I'm sorry verse five Luke four or five the kingdoms of this world so the kingdoms of the world are governed by powers and Satan has the power of them and he gives them to whomsoever he will right shaking decides I would eat it off I hate to say but perhaps Satan allowed trump to be elected is that's what it seems like which many of these presidents but but what God can do though God though can cut down and he God can annoy unbeliever and still use him right yeah just like Cyrus God came down and called Cyrus my servants Cyrus was a Ethan king but God anointed him to do good to Israel look at God's be able to no trouble to do good for Israel like all the previous presence had not done that I'm not a big Trump fan I mean I pray for a soul that's what we pray for Obama so pray for all them but this is the power that we have to wrestle against the power has over the United States government because that's the authority of power and authority that the scripture is talking about so the same word power is used the powers of the kingdoms of this world okay so let's look at maybe one or two more here yeah here's the same power vote up revelation 13:2 that if you could hunt so I like I like how God does it God allows Satan to have control over all these demons whatever you know that God will say you know what I'm gonna move this God in my purpose I'm gonna noise Cyrus and to be good to my people Israel I'm annoyed I'm an anointed Trump to be good to my people Israel that's what he did that's what it seems like so every now and then God will intervene to bring about prophecy to bring about his will look at revelation 13:2 here's this power and authority is the same word here now you know this is Imperial Rome from right around the turn of the last millennium and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear in his mouth as the mouth of a life this is the Roman Empire and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority so it was Satan giving Rome their pot his power and authority right so this is what we've got to wrestle against you have to be able to wrestle against these spiritual powers that are over the United States government and more other governments like when we pray for people like an Iran or the Saints in the Philippines or anyone being persecuted well we need to realize that we can actually pray and try to influence the powers over that country we need to try and do that and perhaps it's in the will of God to do it not always I think God's what it do it but there are times where God does do it let's look at one where you can clearly see this so go to Acts chapter 12 X 12 1 up try to try to understand especially the church I hope you can catch this dog here God doesn't always hear the prayers you know to overcome these kingdoms but there are times he does and this is kind of a little bit limit personal I'd say personal but it's just kind of I guess sad in one way but in other way we can see the power of God now verse 12 verse 1 12:1 now about that time Herod the King stretched forth his hands to vex earth of the church and he killed James the brother of John with the sword this is Harry God allowed Herod to arrest James who wrote the book of James and he was a martyr there in the early church now God never intervened to stop that God allowed James to be a martyr right look at verse 3 and because he saw it pleased the Jews he proceeded further to take Peter also then were the days of unleavened bread and we need apprehended and he put him in prison and delivered him to four courtiers nyrians of the soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him and when Herod would have brought aboard the same night Peter receiving between two soldiers Muhammad two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison behold the angel Lord came upon him and a light shined the prison and he spoke Peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands praise God look here's one where where no doubt the church was praying for James as well they were praying for James but God allowed him to go home but now the church cries out to God said god minister to Peter st. Peter so this time God does hear the prayers the prayers go up above all the principalities of Rome praise God they go above the principalities of Rome than God sends out an angel other this angel broke through those spiritual powers really max didn't he because Peter was in a maximum prison right maximum security this guy's such a bad guy the eyes of hair he's got he's got to sleep by two soldiers that's max from security he's not even in isolation he's got two prisoners right next to him he's got guys sleeping on both the shoulders but God God so moves upon the prayers of the Saints that he sends down the angel right for that fifth dimension comes right through those inner powers smites Peter said I sell quickly we got to get out of here amen let me ask you who had more power their new role or did the church have more power the church but the church will only see the results when it's the will of God everybody understand that but should we should should we what should we do should we give up on prayers we pray every time somebody gets arrested pray every time somebody gets arrested and then if it's God's will God will bring the man out if not then don't go home and their heavenly reward he's got that beautiful who's more powerful that Rome or the church who's more powerful today the United States government or this church our church if we're truly the Church of God under the blood of Jesus Christ then our prayers are more powerful see we're of a different Kingdom but we have to pray for the will of God to be done praise God hey man now go to John 19 10 this says it beautifully right here and this is the same thing there 4x chapter 12 then said Pilate unto him speakers down not unto me Jesus was keeping silent like a lamb at this point the worst now now that I power and crucify their power to release thing notice what Jesus says jesus answered thou goodness have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above amen what uh what uh what uh for the consolation what a confidence we haven't got no government can hurt us no police can arrest us nobody can kill us unless it would be God's Widow unless God would allow in other words we are in the hand of God our entire life is in the hand of God if anything would happen to us it would have to be God that would allow it and we know still even if God allows danger to happen to us there's nothing that could separate us from the love of Christ amen Alleluia thank you lord therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin see there's levels of sin you know that there's levels of sins than others I want you to see that power I've could have no power at all you have no authority over me except my father allowed it mm-hmm so see everything that happens to us has to be allowed by God praise the Lord okay now let's let's go to this one to refers to the end 6:12 now this is the scripture I used to overcome tobacco and other sins I just kind of quoted this scripture right in the scripture many many years ago notice the washing comes by the blood and the Holy Spirit verse 11 and such were some of you here wash your sanctified your justified the name of Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God so immerse you got to get washed that verse 12 says all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any Amen Lucy because because they look at our lives that's why we go to church what power is ruling me what Authority is ruling me even in our house right in our house what's what's moving you you know what's moving each of the children of the adults and banging on we're leaders in our home what authority is moving us what do we obey are we obeying the powers of darkness or the powers of Christ's crew obeying the powers of Christ amen if not you be under you'd be under the influence of demons demon TV shows demon movies right see but we are under the power of Christ and then we have the we have the desire I'm not going to be brought under the power of any except God Almighty praise the Lord so that's a good scripture for that so you can see that that we have to live to look at our lives and say what is moving my life is it the power of God or is it the power of darkness now let's go to Luke 4 again we were there twice this morning let's go for 32 and in sugar this is where you're gonna see we've been preaching on this lately the power of the spoken word here's how you have power over wickedness look at the Bible said and they were astonished at Jesus's doctrine for His Word was with power so Jesus would speak the word and the devil's move see I had an experience that my life Luud with my addictions I had to speak against the addiction until they finally left you got a you speaking so if you children want to see more victory in your lives you want to see victory for Adam you're gonna see victory for other Benjamin Austin these things we got to speak the Word of God and ask God to do it in prayer we have to ask him I'm good to make our request they don't have to God let's see your friends safe you got that speak it because the word is with power there's power in the Word of God okay and then if God does it praise the Lord if not then we know it's a time or season we have to wait for the time or season or perhaps it's not God's will to save them but we do have we do what to ask right we do want to be burden for people to be saved all right so it's always by the word of power we have to speak that word okay now let's look at another here actually we'll just move on the next one let's go to rulers let me go back to Ephesians 6:12 those scriptures are very similar so let's go back of course we know what the Word of God Jesus spoke the demons right there in people's lives and they moved out I think I told this testimony of a few months ago we had two people sitting on this side of the church like right in this row right here - there's two people on the side and they both came up for prayer dinner service saying that demons were trying to tempt them to leave the church and do evil things while I'm preaching demons are in this building but they both got the victory by the blood of Christ by coming up for prayer by resisting the devil so I want the tutor know that these are real things now the Spirit of Christ protects us right it's a hedge about us but there are times we get tested and God may pull back that heads a little bit to see if we'll overcome he wants to test us right to make sure we'll pass the test I want you to know that that that though there's voices going on there there's a battle going on even now praise God and we've got to believe and we've got to speak the Word of God and know that we've got power the blood of Christ our word has power amen that's why you don't have to even have need pray you can just pump the altar and just as your bread you just speak against whatever is tempting you come against depression I need depression the name of Jesus whatever whatever Satan's trying to battle you with you got power because you got the Word of God that's right and you have to refuse him and keep wrestling against him and choke him out so he has no more influence so he leaves you resist him and no fleet praise God amen so thou rulers of the darkness of this world I showed you two rulers last week the Prince of Persia and the Prince of Greece of Princeton Greece and they both battled angels two for in order to stop prayers being answered to God here every prayer though yes he did does God hear every one of your prayers yes he does but there are times and he won't he lets us know the Angels bowed out until he answers it praise God so these are rulers of the darkness of this world that's what wrestling against Peter and the church wasn't wrestling against Herod their runs against the powers above here mara what happened to Herod never happen next well right after that after Peter got out whatever what happened he I made a speech and they said oh he's like God and what happened God smote him right there and the worms ate of them from of that so see how bored it is that we remember like vengeance is the Lord's we're not they weren't rest against Herod the rest against the spirits that were influencing her and all we got to do is pray for God's prisoners or God's children to be set free and let God deal with the unbeliever praise God so that's our duty church is to pray against wrestle against the rulers of this world now the word ruler in the Greek means the lord of the world which is saying but this scripture says rulers of the darkness so we know it's not just speaking of Satan's become Satan and that higher demons the rulers of the darkness of this world and I'm just going to put this last one last one together here because I want to watch the time spiritual wickedness in high places this means the heavenly regions so we wrestled against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places but he came up Ephesians 2:2 here visions tumors - okay now I want everybody to see this here we're in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air so I'm glad children I'm glad you weren't here when I was a sinner if you would have saw me if you tur saw me I was walking according to the Prince and the power of the air I was living like every other sinner I wasn't being a good boy that was being a good teenager I was living a very simple life I was walking the course of the world I was only doing the things I wanted to do the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so Satan is the Prince of the power of the air and then his spirit is Christ's spirit is what's working in people that disobey the Word of God so now you know your friends that haven't given their hearts to the Lord they're walking according to the Prince and power of the air when they disobey the word they haven't they have the spirit of disobedience so we've got to pray God help them to repent so they have obedience because right now there's spirits working up in their minds and controlling them to walk in disobedience to the Word of God and our prayers have to be lord help them to repent and walk under the sphere of obedience instead of a spirit of disobedience all right so this is scriptural this is what we're wrestling against spiritual wickedness in high places the spirit of disobedience in other words the spirit of rebellion they're under Satan's influence of the spirit of their day okay now let's finish with this I want to go through a few scriptures on prayer and then we'll be done maybe give you about 1500 soon okay let's go to 2nd chronicles 7 again we're in 10 chronicles 20 earlier this morning service let's go to 2nd chronicles 7:14 now this is Solomon praying and remember this morning we saw how Jehoshaphat he was surrounded by the Syrians and he had no choice of what it was what jobs that did was he recalled the prayer of Solomon and prayed he cried to God a prophet prophesied they received the word they started worshiping and during their worship God ambushed all the enemies so worship is a weapon now here some oven says this and this is a very familiar passage but let's just look at it and revisit it here let's go to verse 12 the Lord appeared to Solomon by night instead of him I have heard that prayer and I've chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice if I show up Evan that there be no rain or if I command or locusts to the bow the land where if I send vessels among my people if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways sorry of themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and I will hear Oh heal their land now mine eyes shall be open in my ears attend under the prayer that is made in this place praise God now we as Christians should never be in a spot where we're so evil that God cuts off all the blessings from us in other words we should have lived like sinners we should be living the holy calling of God but I just want to bring this out because brogrammer mentioned this the scripture many times about the humility of Prayer if the Bible says in verse 14 God's people that are gone guys they humble themselves and pray turn from their wicked ways then he'll hear from heaven forgive their sin and heal their length okay so there's a clear promise if my people humble themselves and cry out to God I will hear them and heal their land all right so we know though America's not gonna have a national revival and it's already that saith the Lord they won't so we've got to do is pray for small little revivals in other words we have to pray God send a revival to our little church yeah revive our church save all the souls in Akron because we know that all of Akron is going to be saved now all of Ohio is going to be saved but there there can be small pockets of revival right here in Akron now I don't know remember I told you this honey remember brother Steve Alexander that the deities of the sable guide talked I told her God needs to come to church I reach out to him and I remember he said I've been praying for a church in Akron since the 1990s he told me so he showed us such as say 1995 just middle of the decade in 1995 Steve Alexander starts praying for a church and after 95 2005-2006 11 years later God raised up a church in Akron and so but God has done is he started a revival right here in Akron and there's at least one person we know that was praying for a message Church in Akron and now God's done it amen faces are so see this is what God is doing just little revivals and the last cleaning there's there's a few stalls in Akron God wants us to glean those but if we want to see more save we have to continue to humble ourselves and pray and seek God's face you know I remember talking with brother James brownie before he passed away and I said brother you know did you guys because I like doing outreaches I might give you did the postcards last year and he said I said what about outreaches he said we never did outreaches like that he said we would just pray over the years for God to save souls and God would save souls so there in other words he to the same thing we're doing we're just praying God saves Souls and then God will send them in see we're praying against the spiritual wickedness that's over people's lives but we got to keep wrestling we can't give up we got to keep credit there he's God so we have to humble ourselves though and pray and you know I'm thinking about this I'm praying about maybe changing the order of service a little bit you know in the future months we'll see I would like to maybe start with a little more prayer time so I'm just I'm letting you know I'm praying about that if God would lead me to do that here's why you know Jesus says that in Mark 11 17 is it not written my house should be called of All Nations in the House of Prayer so I feel like we should have more prayer time at church if people can't make it early to pray then maybe we should just pray more together in church and I'll try to short my sermons a little bit but as I've been studying prayer I've been seeing how this is so important I go to first Timothy 2 and a few more scriptures first Timothy 2 verse 1 [Music] [Music] first Timothy 2:1 I exhort therefore that first of all prayers which are supplications prayers intercessions and of giving thanks be made for all men as that beautiful almond so it is God's will God loves it when you children raise your hand for a prayer request right God loves that because that's what's supposed to be done we're supposed to give thanks we're supposed to intercede for all men and he says first of all so paul sartre the first of all i want to remind you we need to pray for everybody we need to pray verse 2 for kings so for us that be present and for all that are in authority so our Senators and Representatives and our governor our mayor that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty mm-hmm praise the Lord a church when was the last time we prayed for the mayor of Akron I don't know if I ever have a right those last time we prayed for governor Mike DeWine from Ohio I remember maybe one bunch of twice but see I think myself even as a Christian and other Christians we just forget that we need to pray for these people and if we're not doing it at our homes that we've run into a reminder to do it here and then we'll take it to our homes you see Mike going time he prays around election time but we need to pray more than that meeting pray for that the Bible said first of all do this make prayer for all men verse 3 this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will have all men to be saved that all who have that word hat means wishes who wishes all men to be saying and come to the knowledge of the truth verse 5 there's one God I want to eat mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus did you catch that mediator we'd have to go through the mediator Jesus Christ its first ones that we have to make intercessions for all men so we are going to Jesus saying Jesus please intercede further as we said Benjamin Oster some of these we've been praying for Jesse's dead Justin's mom everyone's were praying for me to go to Jesus and say Jesus will you intercede on behalf of these people cuz you're the mediator verse 6 who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time where do I learn ain't a preacher an apostle I speak the truth in Christ I lie not a teacher the Gentiles of faith emeriti I will therefore that then for anywhere everywhere just a church everywhere that's what I said well I can't remember the last time I prayed in my home for some of the leaders in the government you know Kepler maybe the president and students freeport the Bible said pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting so when we pray we need to be assured that God is going to hear our prayers because we want to lead a life of quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty now let's look at two more scriptures before we finish here let's go to Romans 10:1 Romans 10:1 brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be insane so this last one I want to bring out we should pray for Israel mm-hmm we should pray for Israel and remember they will be saved because the fist seal tells us that because their souls are the author they only have the testimony of the Word of God they don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ they don't have white robes yet which is eternal life so they cry out have vengeance but it will be when will we be avenged remember that but then the Bible says your brethren have to suffer a little while and then you'll be amazed right the Bible said white robes were given to them they didn't have eternal life on the earth so they got eternal life there in the sixth dimension there in heaven so see we got to pray for his role that God will save them I was watching a video yesterday on on Facebook on the Temple Mount faithful and there's Jews there just walking right up there by the Wailing Wall just singing and praying to God never saying God build the third temple build the third temple will rebuild the temple of Israel their brain workers are making their crane and fasten the Jews are praying and fasting because they want to see that tumbleweed be rebuilt now you and I know and that temple gets rebuilt and the coming of Christ is very near if it's not fast mm-hmm because remember they worship we saw that couple weeks ago we saw last week or two weeks ago in Daniel the Antichrist cuts off the daily sacrifice remember so the Jews will get a temple rebuilt and they'll have a daily sacrifice they'll make a cover with the Antichrist and it'll be cut off in the middle of the week so after three half years of the Covenant go get cut it off now the only way that can happen is if Jesus are decayed and he leaves the Gentiles takes the Gentiles in a rapture then he goes back to the Jews so we don't know which side that rebuilt temples on but we know the rebuilt temple is part of the end times the coming of the Lord and they're marching right now saying God rebuild the temple give us this land back amen let the mosque of Omar be torn down and let the temple of God be built amen Paul saying let's pray for Israel that they'll be saved amen praise God let's go to Psalms 122:6 Lydia 122:6 it's owns 122:6 ii Alaska a church when I read these scriptures doesn't it I hope it does YouTube it makes prayer more of a reality doesn't it at the end of the service I'm gonna ask their buddy lift their hands England sugar let's lift up holy hands and pray that their the service because God's a great aviator he said we're called to make intercession and pray for all these different levels and see if God will move on our behalf praise God alright what's about to say pray for the Peace of Jerusalem they shall prosper that lovely amen see that's what I mean to pray for Israel have peace God once this people have peace God is constantly protecting Israel I just saw an article last year the palace some of the evil Palestinians they're not all evil that's ours they don't do all the evil things but some of the terrorists they had dug a channel you know there's a oh here's the wall where Israel's protect I think it was which part of us on Eastern Israel and there's a wall and they they dug a secret tunnel under Israel under the ground to try to bring in terrace at the very last moment somehow the government figured it out and they were able to stop them from getting in I think that was just last year and see the Bible says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem so see someone's prayers were heard yeah because the these evil I'll just say like this thing's an evil demon worshippers these terrorists were trying to destroy disrupt the Peace of Israel but God protected them no doubt because the prayers of the Saints maybe even their prayers as well just like we saw last week with the Six Day War God had this tiny little country defeat three big countries he confused their communication right amen he had sneak attacks come where where weren't expected the Israel to attack God will make away God is with Israel how sadness God is with us say no best a to our feet here let's let's just have Malachi come here's the last Scripture Ephesians back to Beaton's 6 verse 18 so he says if we're gonna we have we're gonna wrestle we got to have the full armor of God and then verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints all right he's got to all Fred all prayer whether supplication intercession personal prayer any prayer we should make it to the Lord and if we're fully armored with the armor of God and we can pray with confidence that God hears us praise God Lily just turn off the livestream now god bless them I don't want anyone to feel I don't want the children to feel like nervous if anyone's watching so you can just throw it off outside I do it them to raise their
