[30:10] beer casted I'm sorry perfect love

[30:31] Father I pray you to meet the need of
[30:33] every heart Lord that's hungry for
[30:35] righteousness
[30:36] that's thirsty for holiness Lord you
[30:38] said you fill every hungry and thirsty
[30:41] heart you promised it Lord you're not a
[30:43] god
[30:44] that breaks promises or you keep it so
[30:47] we know Lord we are truly hungry and
[30:49] truly thirsty today we shall be filled
[30:51] Lord God with your blessings with the
[30:54] desires of our hearts to be more like
[30:56] you Lord Jesus thank you that perfect
[30:59] love casts out all fear and help us to
[31:02] understand this law on your prophets
[31:04] head of numerous times this is the law
[31:06] of God it's another principle Lord a
[31:09] spiritual one father God just like
[31:12] natural ones with gravity Lord Godin and
[31:15] chaos and all these things Lord God
[31:18] Father but this is a spiritual law so
[31:20] much more important dear God and we ask
[31:23] the Lord God that your sphere would
[31:24] minister to us or homely coming before
[31:26] you bowing our heads before you we've
[31:29] worship You Lord you sang your praises
[31:31] Lord God we're thankful for the Lamb of
[31:33] God who took away our sins at Calvary

[31:38] Lord God Father that we might glorify
[31:41] you on this earth Lord during our our
[31:43] vapor of life through our God in our
[31:45] lives are just a vapor upon this earth
[31:47] of us to glorify you with all we have
[31:50] Nord let's be faithful may be said well
[31:53] done my good and faithful servant enter
[31:55] ye into the joys of the Lord have been
[31:58] prepared for you from the foundation of
[32:01] the world
[32:01] we love you Lord unless justice this day
[32:04] Lord Jesus Christ II never said he meant
[32:08] God that should be the Lord one could
[32:14] mean house lourdes morning and looking
[32:15] forward to where's the Lord this morning
[32:23] we like to look at the law of perfect
[32:26] love this morning by God's grace tonight
[32:28] we'll be doing a Bible study on
[32:29] sanctification and so we'll just go
[32:32] Bible study with questions and answers
[32:33] so we'll have everybody who comes to
[32:34] necks in the front row and we'll take
[32:36] questions about sanctification it's kind
[32:38] of Felton led to go that direction so
[32:40] we'll look at sanctification here
[32:42] tonight the grace of the Lord so we're
[32:45] looking at our thought here this morning
[32:46] of the law of perfect love I want to
[32:49] review this quotation this is from 1954
[32:51] Jarius and divine healing now the
[32:55] Prophet said the only thing that we can
[32:57] do is work according to the law of God
[33:00] for our healing and the Prophet said
[33:03] what is the law of God he answers his
[33:06] own question is love perfect love any
[33:10] quotes first Peter 14 perfect love casts
[33:13] out all fear the Prophet said love and
[33:15] faith is the same thing see love perfect
[33:18] love casts out all fear
[33:21] which gives us faith so we can't have
[33:25] any faith as long as there's fear in our
[33:27] minds or in our hearts we must have love
[33:31] first then when love fully feels our
[33:34] thoughts and our minds then we can have
[33:37] love and that love casts out all fear
[33:39] and then we can have perfect faith in
[33:41] God's Word the Prophet said it's a love
[33:44] as the law now you said if you'll just
[33:47] love God with all your heart and if
[33:50] you've done something to your neighbor
[33:52] or somebody just say in your heart now I
[33:54] love them too or if you said if you
[33:57] criticize me just say Lord with brother
[34:00] branham I'm criticized a little bit but
[34:02] I love you anyhow so brother Branham
[34:05] dealt with that in he said if you have a
[34:06] criticism toward me you must say Lord I
[34:08] love brother Branham anyhow even though
[34:10] I criticized him I still love him I'm
[34:13] brother man so that's the love of God
[34:15] the law
[34:15] so I want to remind us that this man is
[34:18] a three-part being all said the very God
[34:21] of peace will sanctify you wholly and I
[34:23] pray you're a whole spirit soul and body
[34:25] be preserved blameless and the coming of
[34:27] the Lord Jesus now I always loved the
[34:32] beginning of my school year I started
[34:34] this year and a few years ago our
[34:36] district bought the book called the
[34:37] seven Habits of happy kids and it's a
[34:40] book from the cubby family he's the man
[34:42] who wrote the seven most ways to be
[34:45] effective or something like that I
[34:47] forget the name of it the seven Habits
[34:50] of Highly Effective People thank you
[34:51] guys and his son Sean Covey I believe it
[34:55] if I'm not mistaken wrote this book and
[34:57] so our district bought it and supportive
[34:59] so once the district buys it it's good
[35:01] forever unless they get it out you know
[35:03] the board has to approve all the books
[35:04] so in Chapter seven of this book is the
[35:07] last habit and that's called balance
[35:10] feels best and so I get to teach my kids
[35:12] every year that they have three parts
[35:14] and there being a body soul and spirit
[35:16] because that's actually in the book I
[35:18] could use cartoon characters and this
[35:21] week I got to teach them that I said you
[35:22] have a body soul and spirit and I love
[35:25] how I get to teach the Word of God right
[35:27] there in school and it's not it's
[35:28] imported by the district whether they
[35:30] know it or not but the Bible says we
[35:32] have three parts so we have are what the
[35:36] Bible said we have a body at your
[35:38] physical nature of course then you have
[35:41] your human spirit or we call it the mind
[35:43] that there's our mind everybody has in
[35:46] mind huh and then everybody has a soul
[35:49] the soul is the inside of the inside we
[35:51] know that by the grace of the Lord
[35:53] somebody has a body mind and soul now if
[35:57] you have your Bibles go to mark 12:30 if
[36:00] you would the other battles mark 12:30
[36:02] gabba 12:30 and I've always based you
[36:08] know my doctorate am i teaching upon the
[36:10] true Word of God I mean no there's no
[36:13] contradictions in God's Word amen but
[36:16] yet God allows so many details in the
[36:18] word that it causes the unbelief or the
[36:20] stumble but he said with father son Holy
[36:22] Ghost Loretta said that was Jesus
[36:25] talking in mystery he said but the
[36:27] unbelievers or make
[36:28] leader stumble over that and cut down to
[36:30] three persons but brother branham said
[36:32] well Graham said if Jesus was still here
[36:35] he would have said the same thing today
[36:36] i baptize to the baptized in the name of
[36:39] the Father Son Holy Ghost because
[36:41] there's a mystery behind it because only
[36:43] the true children of God would really
[36:45] seek out the revelation of the mystery
[36:47] it's the honor and glory of Kings to
[36:49] search out of matter who Jesus no
[36:51] superficial Christianity will never get
[36:54] the revelation of the word of God it
[36:56] takes somebody that really wants to know
[36:57] God something that wants to dig down and
[36:59] God's Word and find a vein of gold amen
[37:02] the may no syllable redemption and deity
[37:04] Jesus knows the real believer knows that
[37:07] what a surface level relationship they
[37:08] want to go deep at the things of God
[37:10] that's why Jesus today went to snow set
[37:13] baptized the name of the cars only ghost
[37:14] and then when someone got the Holy Ghost
[37:16] they would have said Jesus Christ
[37:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[37:20] because God loves to hide himself from
[37:22] the wise and prudent interview themself
[37:24] in debates such as would learn now mark
[37:27] 12:30 you got your Bibles here jesus
[37:30] said this and thou shalt love the Lord
[37:31] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[37:35] soul with all thy mind and with all thy
[37:39] strength this is the first commandment
[37:43] now this might stumble people but Jesus
[37:46] use for descriptions and if you apply
[37:49] those four to the three realms of man
[37:51] what you'll find is that heart
[37:53] represents emotions because we'll see in
[37:56] a few slides you know what Jeremiah and
[37:58] ha Group said about about the heart the
[38:02] heart is deceitfully wicked above all
[38:04] things in other words your emotions
[38:06] control by your human sinful nature is
[38:08] wicked above all things because your
[38:12] emotion you can feel good when somebody
[38:13] falls into sin but that's evil
[38:16] well I really want to see this person
[38:18] fall could my emotions are telling you
[38:20] that's a good thing that's an evil thing
[38:22] right or I really want to get back at
[38:25] that person or I really want to get this
[38:26] money or I really want to get this
[38:28] another relationship that's unlawful by
[38:31] the Word of God like hair and running
[38:32] are odious is known as emotions one
[38:35] but that's evil that's when your
[38:37] emotions are deceitfully wicked in the
[38:40] bubble above all things so Jesus said
[38:44] love God with all your heart which is
[38:46] your emotions which is one of those five
[38:48] realms in your human spirit and he said
[38:50] love God with all your soul that's your
[38:52] nature
[38:53] they said love God with all your might
[38:55] not the other four parts of your human
[38:57] mind and then he said love God with all
[39:00] your strength everybody here has used
[39:02] your human strength to come to the house
[39:04] of God this morning aren't you glad
[39:05] you're here not in the hospital we're
[39:08] laying in the mall or something like
[39:09] that we're very blessed to be able to
[39:11] use our human strength remember the
[39:13] house of the Lord so we see this is how
[39:16] Jesus says we must have love and
[39:18] remember the law of God rovaire said is
[39:20] love and what's the greatest commandment
[39:22] love jesus said you have to love God
[39:25] with all your body soul mind and
[39:27] strength in other words all of your
[39:29] being must have the love of God flowing
[39:30] through it now let me back this up the
[39:33] heart means your emotion jesus said love
[39:35] God with all your heart if you read the
[39:37] whole Old Testament you'll see that
[39:38] heart represents emotions because the
[39:42] box Jeremias at the heart of the
[39:43] secretly wicked above all things and so
[39:46] see your emotions must be brought into
[39:48] life to the Word of God if your emotions
[39:50] are against the Word of God you have to
[39:52] cast out your emotions if it's a memory
[39:55] I'm not going to listen to them I'm not
[39:57] gonna act upon them I'm gonna act upon
[39:58] God's Word amen we all feel that like
[40:01] for example with my children I might get
[40:03] upset with my children and and I
[40:05] shouldn't do that but I've got to take
[40:07] that emotion I've gotta say God forgive
[40:09] me help me not to be angry help me to be
[40:11] patient amen that's right and then the
[40:14] book of Proverbs that above all guard
[40:17] your heart for out of it flows the issue
[40:19] of life so either your emotions flows
[40:23] your life right here your heck your joy
[40:25] your sad or your life flows out through
[40:27] people sometimes go to their emotions on
[40:29] their sleeve right you can tell them
[40:31] they're down you can tell them they're
[40:32] up you can tell because out of their
[40:34] emotions flows what's in their heart and
[40:36] mind right so we know heart means
[40:39] emotions so Jesus says love the Lord
[40:41] your God with all your heart soul mind
[40:44] and strength and this is the law
[40:46] god it's only by doing this loving God
[40:48] with all of you and you would have
[40:50] anything because you have enough that
[40:53] love first that casts out all fear
[40:55] and then perfect love I break spacing
[40:58] then Galatians 5:6 says a love operates
[41:01] faith a net so here's the next one
[41:04] we must love God with all of our heart
[41:07] and mind then we can add a fake we can't
[41:10] have any faith in God's Word
[41:12] do we have God's love in every part of
[41:14] our being
[41:15] you must love God with our body you must
[41:17] make our body obey the love of God we
[41:21] must have love in our soul for the word
[41:23] of the Lord amen we must have love in
[41:25] our affections which is our emotions we
[41:27] must have God's emotions we must not we
[41:30] must love God with our conscience
[41:32] meaning that I know I've done the right
[41:34] thing I have a good conscience toward
[41:35] God I don't have a bad conscience now I
[41:38] know I didn't make that Rider we must
[41:40] have love in our conscience we must have
[41:42] love in our memory we must bring up
[41:44] things we must not bring up things under
[41:46] the blood grace God you must never have
[41:49] the bad memories and and dwell on those
[41:51] bad memories I remember when she did
[41:52] this to me I remember when he did that
[41:54] to me that's not having love love
[41:56] forgets those things any man love
[41:58] remembers the good parts about people
[42:00] that's what divine love does but see
[42:02] that's my people many many people can't
[42:05] have faith because they they they
[42:06] stopped up love their flu SIA carved up
[42:08] in one of these they have the wrong
[42:10] emotions they live off the wrong
[42:11] emotions they have a bad conscience
[42:13] toward God they're not clean toward God
[42:15] they remember all the bad things and
[42:17] then they reached and the reason God's
[42:19] words that's okay if I can break the
[42:21] word here it's okay if I break the word
[42:23] there God understands and so love
[42:25] doesn't flow through there until they
[42:27] just reason and say I'm going to Vegas
[42:29] word above all things and then that's
[42:32] real love when you obey God's word above
[42:35] all things and you reason with the word
[42:37] you take God's word rather than your own
[42:39] mind and here's where we get a lot of
[42:42] complexes in imagination or maybe laughs
[42:45] people can imagine all I only was
[42:47] married to that person or if I'm only
[42:48] married to that person imagine a
[42:50] magining things well God's love is not
[42:53] in that phrase God God's love is
[42:55] according to
[42:56] word right or some people match all this
[42:59] sister or the preacher or the song you
[43:01] play or something
[43:02] they must have this against me because
[43:04] they're treating me like this or
[43:05] treating me like that when when someone
[43:07] accepts those socks there's not the love
[43:10] of God in there and so because there's
[43:12] no love in there they can operate
[43:14] people have a hard time believing God
[43:16] will answer their prayer does that make
[43:18] sense by God's grace
[43:19] I'll get upset if you get in the
[43:21] greatest battle her fault if you have a
[43:23] list of that he says whenever we get
[43:25] something clogged up in here cause up
[43:27] the love of God in our minds and then
[43:29] the love that's in our soul can't flow
[43:30] out through my mind and we can't speak
[43:32] God's Word you can't believe God's Word
[43:34] we can't act the right way because sin
[43:37] has clogged up God's love
[43:39] I'm not love the threw all their
[43:41] beans hey man this is permanent this is
[43:44] the law of God it's got to flow out so
[43:46] let me go back see if I can go back here
[43:48] but let me go back okay let me go back
[43:52] to there yes I think I'm just go back to
[43:53] here so we have to have love in our soul
[43:55] for God and who cross the greatest
[43:57] battles letting love flow through our
[43:59] mind we always think bad thoughts we
[44:01] often imagine the wrong thing and we'll
[44:04] remember the wrong thing rather letting
[44:06] the love of God of our minds and then
[44:08] straight have you got all of our
[44:10] strength making the human sacrifices of
[44:12] our body possible we must do that and
[44:15] the Prophet said if you'll just love God
[44:18] without her heart and if you've done
[44:20] something to your neighbor just taking
[44:21] your heart now I love them Jude so see
[44:24] he's trying to get the love to flow from
[44:26] the soul out to the mind and out to the
[44:28] body throw bang God's words that help by
[44:31] the grace of Lord I hope that helps
[44:33] somebody now let me read a few quotes if
[44:37] I can these quotes say that love is
[44:40] prerequisite to faith if you've ever
[44:43] gone to university or high school you
[44:45] know there are prerequisite courses
[44:47] right you have to take these courses
[44:49] first before you get to your major
[44:52] courses right so brother Adam says this
[44:56] he says a personal experience with God
[44:58] that you're looking for
[45:00] always say we have faith we have love
[45:03] but if we had love we'd have faith
[45:06] because perfect love casts out all fear
[45:09] and when fear is gone faith is perfect
[45:13] you're scared he won't keep his word but
[45:16] I believe he does amen so see this is
[45:21] the first commandment we must have love
[45:23] first then we can have faith in God's
[45:26] Word
[45:27] let me read this with next this is from
[45:29] the way to fellowship 1955 he said
[45:36] that's what's the trouble with the
[45:37] people tonight you're scared that's the
[45:40] biggest curse there is on the blue
[45:41] gospel beat book or any other people did
[45:44] you catch that the greatest cursed is to
[45:46] be fearful that's the greatest curse he
[45:49] says God has made provision but you're
[45:52] afraid to take this word for it if you
[45:54] want afraid tonight why you would take
[45:56] your healing by faith and know that God
[45:58] promised it and the thing would just so
[46:00] blow them away from you afraid scared
[46:03] and I've noticed that's the reason I'm
[46:05] such a believer in healing I know that
[46:07] if you can get away from that scare and
[46:09] get love in its place something's going
[46:12] to happen
[46:13] amen father there we go he said the only
[46:15] way you can have faith is to have love
[46:17] first let's say love first ready love
[46:20] first the only way you could happen how
[46:23] many want faith that's the assurance of
[46:25] God's going to keep his word before you
[46:27] can have the faith you've got to have
[46:28] love first the Prophet said the Bible
[46:30] says that for love produces faith love
[46:35] has to come before faith we must love
[46:37] God first then faith flows out from that
[46:40] love he says you get it perfect love
[46:43] casts out all fear
[46:45] I remember the story of the killer blow
[46:48] he read he rehearses the story for us
[46:52] and he says when I started to cross the
[46:54] field right on the big open field not 30
[46:57] yards from me this big fellow raised up
[46:59] through his horns down and let out a big
[47:02] bellow if you know what I'm talking
[47:04] about and there he was
[47:04] horns like this and here he come so I
[47:07] was walking across the field trying to
[47:10] pray for somebody and a big bull races
[47:12] up in this hole
[47:13] I was charging a brother branham program
[47:15] said at first it scared me I thought you
[47:19] got the Holy Ghost brother man he does
[47:20] have the Holy Ghost but its first human
[47:22] reaction is fear at first it scared me I
[47:27] look for a tree that wasn't any tree I
[47:29] know he could outrun me to the bed so I
[47:31] thought well this is it so he's already
[47:33] fearful and they said well this is the
[47:35] end of me here's my death and that's how
[47:38] it will experience to write our first
[47:39] human reaction is normally fear he said
[47:43] but then he says then something happened
[47:46] he said Oh God if that would only stay
[47:49] there instead of going away that love
[47:51] he's talking about something happened I
[47:53] wish God would let it happen to
[47:54] everybody here tonight just long enough
[47:56] to get healed amen
[47:58] see that what are we talking about we're
[48:00] talking about the revelation of God's
[48:02] love we're not living from the human
[48:06] mind but letting the love of God flow
[48:07] out from our soul the revelation that
[48:10] God loves us and we love God we say
[48:14] casting down fear right casting down a
[48:16] beer and letting love take control of
[48:18] our minds he said something happened now
[48:24] that I wasn't scared of a goal I felt
[48:28] sorry because I disturbed him I was in
[48:31] his field
[48:33] they said fellow I'm sorry I disturbed
[48:35] you he said now you're God's creature
[48:38] and I'm God's servant now the Creator
[48:40] has made you that made me I am a servant
[48:43] and I'm on my journey across the hill to
[48:45] pray for one of his sick children if I
[48:47] know you've been laying there I wouldn't
[48:48] combine disturb you so now in the name
[48:50] of Jesus Christ go back and lay down no
[48:53] he's saying that in the matter of the
[48:55] Bulls running at him he said don't lay
[48:58] down the name of Jesus Christ so he was
[49:00] scared at first but then love took over
[49:03] how many glad God's grace takes over for
[49:05] us we were fearful first but then if we
[49:07] really got love and give them a chance
[49:09] will that love anoint our mind the love
[49:12] will come if we've got love it will come
[49:14] and then it will flow out to believe
[49:16] God's Word if prophets and the judgments
[49:20] are you'll see that Barton's alive the
[49:22] bull looked at me to walk
[49:24] lay down he said that I walked right
[49:26] past it within 5 feet of him he said why
[49:29] did he do it
[49:30] because instead of hating him I loved
[49:32] him love will conquer anything so love
[49:36] conquered fear said it first but because
[49:39] he had to my love love to go over praise
[49:42] God
[49:43] remember God will never give you a
[49:44] battle you can't handle and he promised
[49:47] there's no way out what was the way out
[49:48] love what's the way out for you today
[49:51] love love God trust God believe God's
[49:54] words now look what he says this this is
[49:57] beautiful
[49:59] he says love will conquer anything
[50:02] that's what conquered my heart when I
[50:04] know that God so loved me and gave His
[50:07] only begotten Son that I wouldn't have
[50:09] to perish a day
[50:11] what does brother Adam say where this
[50:12] love come from it comes from the Gospel
[50:15] of John 3:16 amen I know the churches
[50:18] miss you John 3:16 I know they miss
[50:21] apply it where did brother Hyrum say is
[50:23] safety came from knowing that God loved
[50:25] him and Charlie 3:16 the love of God is
[50:29] what inspired him to know God loves me
[50:31] and God is going to get me away from
[50:32] this killer goal
[50:34] John 3:16 that God so loved riding
[50:38] Christ fellowship God so loved brother
[50:40] song so sister so-and-so
[50:42] God so loved me that he sent me a son
[50:44] and that love will conquer a killer bull
[50:47] or a killer mind battle or a killer
[50:49] disease that love will come for that it
[50:52] will just love God Mac he said I know
[50:57] that I was born in this world a sinner
[50:59] in perishing and God loved me
[51:01] that he gave his son for my life to be
[51:03] redeemed and I couldn't hate no more I
[51:06] had to love that's what these results
[51:08] I'm sorry that's what brings results
[51:09] that you see it's love any minute so
[51:13] what's going to bring results in your
[51:14] life loving God more grace God it's
[51:17] gonna be this loving God with your heart
[51:18] never all your emotions everything in
[51:21] your mind your soul and your body I let
[51:24] all those love God and that will bring
[51:27] results amen next he tells about the
[51:31] Hornet remember the hornet's nest
[51:32] he's mulling in his backyard he said he
[51:35] had a you know bare naked chest is what
[51:36] he said he took off his shirt
[51:38] and he said at first I was truly scared
[51:40] truly he says so in both cases of a
[51:44] killer bull Hornets though stadium right
[51:47] in both cases fear set in first because
[51:51] that's the natural human reaction but in
[51:54] both cases love took over he said after
[51:58] that I said oh I'm sorry I hit those
[51:59] fellows not because I was afraid I was
[52:01] going to get done but really it sounds
[52:03] juvenile but if we could just be more
[52:06] Tuvan I'll humbly would say help me to
[52:08] be more tubing up
[52:09] tell me about more childlike faith we
[52:13] could just be more childlike it's the
[52:15] simplicity of God that surged college
[52:17] students around he says be simple in
[52:19] these things looks like a baby just rely
[52:22] and believe don't try to push yourself
[52:24] just relax don't try to work yourself up
[52:27] Oh God
[52:27] oh no yeah how big are we good he said
[52:29] that's no good just believe it and walk
[52:31] on amen he said love I can't produce it
[52:35] I can't work it up God's got to give it
[52:38] so but I'm innocent
[52:39] God gave me his love with John 3:16 and
[52:41] he kept believing and keep loving and
[52:43] then then this love I know God loves me
[52:46] I've obeyed all God's Word then it flows
[52:49] down to all the battles that we face in
[52:51] life hallelujah now look at this when
[52:56] you separate from divine love he says
[52:58] the same quote you can't overlook
[53:00] another brother's mistakes no more so
[53:03] now I brings it down to our local church
[53:04] or your mother sisters in Christ see so
[53:08] when people live in here they can't
[53:10] forgive from their mind somebody's
[53:11] commit to that one let me see it back to
[53:13] that one they remember like I said oh no
[53:17] they just remember everybody's fault
[53:18] they can't overlook that I can't treat
[53:20] this brother better because he just did
[53:22] this and he's that mother random said
[53:25] when you separate from / we can't
[53:27] overlook your cutters mistakes so more
[53:29] now listen you've got the ballin out for
[53:32] it you got the bottom out you can't
[53:36] overlook your sisters mistakes no more
[53:39] because you got away from that divided
[53:41] love part but if you really love the
[53:44] Lord Jesus if a sister or brother does
[53:47] something to you oh well that's all
[53:48] right
[53:48] they didn't mean to do it that's the
[53:50] kind of love that Christ
[53:51] I forgive them they don't know what
[53:54] they're doing
[53:55] my dad brings it down so starts out
[53:58] bulls and hornets and then he brings it
[54:00] down to how do you treat your brothers
[54:02] and sisters we need to overlook their
[54:04] faults and say I love them anyhow well
[54:07] RAM said what if Jesus had said held my
[54:10] sins against me this is how we can
[54:13] forgive others because we know Christ
[54:15] forgives us what an awful person
[54:18] I was but he loved me so well and if he
[54:21] forgave me for them when I was son then
[54:24] if he forgave me he loved me with the
[54:26] pure love and that's how I often forgive
[54:29] others how many want to forgive others
[54:31] I've sinned against you if you have
[54:33] divine love that forgiveness will
[54:35] overlook their faults now that doesn't
[54:37] mean you have to do Matthew 18 if
[54:40] somebody sins against you you're really
[54:42] learning he to go to talk to them about
[54:43] this right you go face to face
[54:46] positive about that there's something
[54:47] wrong and you don't do that and the
[54:49] Bible said that leaven will grow up in
[54:51] the church we've got to do that and what
[54:55] drives you to that divine love drives
[54:57] you to that it's exactly right
[54:59] don't see this one there's another chord
[55:01] about this love it's a prerequisite for
[55:04] faith we must have this the proper said
[55:10] we have great things we can do in the
[55:13] realm of faith even great works for us
[55:17] to tell our faith till you have love
[55:20] that's just all there is to it perfect
[55:23] love casts out all fear as long as you
[55:26] got fear you can't have faith so you got
[55:31] to have love first it drives all fear
[55:35] out and then faith comes in and takes
[55:38] the place of fear I want to give you one
[55:42] more quote that you can't have faith
[55:45] without having love you can't have faith
[55:48] and fear at the same time you've got to
[55:50] have divine love
[55:51] [Music]
[55:53] I carried this next one here by the
[55:58] grade school I think you like this my
[55:59] name's talking about his own life he
[56:04] says brother when you come to a place
[56:05] where you got loved it will never fail
[56:08] that's right how many believe that when
[56:10] you have loved it love can never fail
[56:12] I'm no scripture says that he said if I
[56:15] if my wife trusted me because I gave her
[56:18] ten dollars every time I left my brother
[56:20] that wouldn't be very much sign that I
[56:22] loved her like to pay it off to be
[56:24] faithful he said but when she knows that
[56:27] I love her when I know she loves me
[56:29] there's a perfect trust between each
[56:31] other no worry at all then when you got
[56:33] perfect love of God in your heart you
[56:36] don't question God about anything when
[56:38] the Bible says I'm the LORD thy God that
[56:40] heals all that diseases you say Amen
[56:42] Lord that's right that's me he says that
[56:48] settles it anything God says you love
[56:51] him so much you believe it oh I feel
[56:54] religious right now to think that
[56:56] perfect love casts out all fear
[56:58] you're not scared about nothing you're
[57:01] just resting he says you're not thinking
[57:05] this so listen there as I read this
[57:06] you're not thinking this oh I'm a
[57:08] backside tomorrow I'm a backside next
[57:10] week hear that brother Rand says when
[57:12] you got love in your heart you don't
[57:14] worry about backsliding next week you
[57:16] don't worry about Mack siding next year
[57:18] because he says you've got love in your
[57:20] heart he said I won't worry about that
[57:23] he said I'm not trying to hold on Jesus
[57:26] is holding on for me hard on the gun and
[57:29] Jesus put a love in my heart that holds
[57:32] fair
[57:33] it's Jesus holding me not me holding him
[57:36] if it was me holding him I'd probably
[57:38] turn loose but as long as he's holding
[57:41] me he'll never turn me loose jesus
[57:43] promised he wouldn't even Oh glory I
[57:46] hope you like that jesus said I'll never
[57:48] leave thee nor forsake thee either
[57:51] here's my words that believeth on him
[57:52] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[57:54] shall not come into condemnation but is
[57:57] passed from death unto life praise the
[58:02] Lord
[58:04] program person as long as I know there's
[58:07] something in me making me love the Lord
[58:09] Jesus oh well I don't want to do wrong
[58:12] I'm angered how many feel that in your
[58:15] heart there's something in your heart
[58:17] that makes you love Jesus so much you
[58:18] don't want to do wrong and you feel
[58:20] anchored to God Almighty
[58:22] I already feel that way there should be
[58:24] love in our hearts that I feel anchor
[58:26] I'm not worried about falling away and
[58:28] personally I'm not wearing out falling
[58:30] away because he's holding on to me
[58:32] because his love is holding on to me
[58:34] hallelujah brother Branham said if I
[58:38] tried to say well I quit this and I put
[58:40] that he said I doubt you ever quit it
[58:43] but when something in here happens he
[58:47] says that's what does it and they tell
[58:49] the story about loosing his first wife
[58:51] hope and Sharon rose and a brother came
[58:54] up and asked him afterwards that Billy
[58:56] how are you feeling now remember he just
[58:58] lost his wife and his child he said mr.
[59:01] Eisler you know how I'm feeling we said
[59:04] I want to ask you one thing solid Billy
[59:06] all right ask me mr. Eisler what do you
[59:09] think about the Lord Jesus now after
[59:11] he'd taken your baby your wife
[59:13] everything you had I turned around took
[59:16] him by the hand looked him in the eye
[59:17] and said senator I want to tell you
[59:20] something
[59:21] he's more than life to me amen
[59:24] can you imagine losing a dear family
[59:27] member and something come up and ask you
[59:29] what is it Jesus meeting you now he said
[59:30] more than life to me look what he says
[59:34] next he said do you love him then I said
[59:37] I love Jesus with all my heart soul mind
[59:40] and strength how can brother bear him
[59:42] still love because he's not basing his
[59:44] love for God on these he's basing his
[59:47] love upon the Word of God he could have
[59:49] had a memory and say what God took my
[59:51] wife or God took my baby I just can't
[59:53] believe God loves me and he could have
[59:54] stopped loving God but instead of
[59:56] believing these all these were lined up
[59:59] with the Word of God he didn't believe
[1:00:01] any of these if they weren't in
[1:00:02] obedience to the word and the mister
[1:00:08] Iser said the senator said well what
[1:00:10] about after taking your item baby and my
[1:00:12] man said though he would send me to hell
[1:00:14] if there's such a thing I could still
[1:00:16] I love them anyhow he's always right and
[1:00:19] I'm boy strong and I love you I didn't
[1:00:22] say that this morning Jesus is always
[1:00:24] right what he allowed to happen in my
[1:00:25] life he's always right I'm not going to
[1:00:28] get upset at Christ I've been a lot of
[1:00:29] Christ but Graham said I'm so glad to
[1:00:32] know that by grace he put that in my
[1:00:35] heart that powerful thing of love it
[1:00:38] conquers you know conquer when you lose
[1:00:41] our dear one love will conquer that I'll
[1:00:44] conquer when you go through difficult
[1:00:46] times and it will conquer local
[1:00:48] conquerors
[1:00:49] Greed's and temptations and lust love
[1:00:52] will conquer all that that's what love
[1:00:54] is therefore to do to conquer all things
[1:00:56] Amen hallelujah so can everybody see
[1:00:59] this love is prerequisite we've got to
[1:01:02] have love before you can have faith in
[1:01:04] God you've got to love God with all your
[1:01:06] heart soul mind and strength we must
[1:01:09] love him
[1:01:10] here's another one I want to bring out
[1:01:13] another quotation one of the greatest
[1:01:19] hindrance I know in the church today
[1:01:20] right here in Edmonton or Prince Albert
[1:01:24] says is fear but blood of perfect love
[1:01:28] casts out fear the reason you're fearful
[1:01:31] is because the right temperance of love
[1:01:33] has never entered yet that's he says
[1:01:37] when there's real love all fear passes
[1:01:39] away any bed can ever understand that if
[1:01:44] we fear about anything in life it's
[1:01:46] because we don't have enough love how
[1:01:48] many want more love of God programs that
[1:01:51] we don't have the right temperance of
[1:01:53] love has never entered into us yet Oh
[1:01:56] God's love more than anything else amen
[1:01:59] to love God with all our heart soul mind
[1:02:02] and strength that will cast out every
[1:02:05] fear every doubt here's our honor it is
[1:02:10] to profession I'm not condemning you I'm
[1:02:13] only trying to bring something to light
[1:02:15] that you could look at so he's telling
[1:02:17] them you can if you have any fear you
[1:02:19] don't have enough love if he says I'm
[1:02:20] not condemning you I'm just trying to
[1:02:22] bring the light to your life you can see
[1:02:24] conditioned urine I'm gonna appreciate
[1:02:26] that preacher sometimes up the ball out
[1:02:28] deep part things but a real preacher is
[1:02:31] it trying to condemn people they're
[1:02:32] trying to help people praise God and the
[1:02:34] program says the same thing so the thing
[1:02:37] of it is it's a lack of love a profit
[1:02:39] center no matter how many prophecies we
[1:02:41] have how many great preachers I'm gonna
[1:02:43] see algae we know how great church who
[1:02:45] we belong to if love does it temper that
[1:02:48] together it's a nun effect he said what
[1:02:53] the church is lacking is divine love I
[1:02:55] don't mean affection in love for one
[1:02:56] another I mean the agape love the godly
[1:02:59] love and have it so richly into your
[1:03:01] heart until you just love the Lord and
[1:03:03] everything just take his word for it
[1:03:06] you don't mistrust him amen
[1:03:10] Gloria you don't want to mistrust the
[1:03:13] Lord
[1:03:14] now look what he says here he tells the
[1:03:16] story again if he goes overseas his wife
[1:03:19] doesn't have to grab him by the neck
[1:03:20] ties they promise me you'll be faithful
[1:03:22] remember that Club promise me be
[1:03:24] faithful she said let me tell you good
[1:03:26] man you know let me tell you my wife I
[1:03:28] love that story but ma'am said now if
[1:03:32] somebody would come to me and say mrs.
[1:03:35] Branham it's not true to you brother
[1:03:37] branham can you mention that somebody
[1:03:40] gave you said your wife is a faithful to
[1:03:42] you your husband is a banquet to brother
[1:03:44] Graham said we should have enough love
[1:03:45] to tell them they're wrong
[1:03:47] amen he says I wouldn't believe it you
[1:03:52] couldn't make me believe it no sir pride
[1:03:55] confidence in love they did it he said
[1:03:59] you couldn't make me believe my wife
[1:04:00] wasn't true to me why because I've got
[1:04:03] love for her I know she would have
[1:04:04] sinned against me Gloria and I'd say oh
[1:04:09] you reckon she is what will happen to my
[1:04:11] children the devil would say see oh so
[1:04:13] that's the wrong oh maybe she is on
[1:04:14] pavement what's gonna happen to my
[1:04:16] children fear can settle in that quick
[1:04:18] when someone brings doubt or someone
[1:04:20] brings confusion but brother there's a
[1:04:23] no I wouldn't believe in the first place
[1:04:25] because I love her and as long as I love
[1:04:28] her that way I've got that confidence in
[1:04:30] her as a woman
[1:04:31] grace not a man you see that so love
[1:04:35] produces conference
[1:04:37] that's why I said last week you know
[1:04:38] when people say I've lost confidence in
[1:04:40] this person I lost confidence in that
[1:04:41] person sometimes that's some of the
[1:04:43] hardest words to hear like I do a
[1:04:44] bastard but at numerous families
[1:04:46] sleeping search he told me that he said
[1:04:49] all these people that had told me they
[1:04:50] have no more confidence I mean he's
[1:04:51] crying on the phone and these maybe
[1:04:55] these dear families didn't know what
[1:04:57] they were saying but they're basically
[1:04:58] saying we don't have love for you
[1:05:00] because love produces faith and faith is
[1:05:03] confidence he's God and brothers and I
[1:05:06] have confidence in my wife that when I
[1:05:08] leave to go overseas and the people
[1:05:10] trying to tell me she's unfaithful he
[1:05:12] said I can't believe that because I've
[1:05:14] got confidence I love her she loves me
[1:05:17] love produces confidence they've met
[1:05:19] it's exactly right remember no matter
[1:05:24] what you say the days of miracles is
[1:05:26] fast God don't do this
[1:05:28] God don't do that he said you might
[1:05:30] adjust well save your breath I love
[1:05:32] Jesus and I believe Jesus and I take him
[1:05:35] at his word so that settles it
[1:05:37] God said so and if you can get to the
[1:05:39] place where you love him it will cast
[1:05:41] out the fear that you have that he will
[1:05:44] keep his word oh that's so important for
[1:05:46] us to defend oh my if we love our wives
[1:05:49] and husbands and husbands love their
[1:05:51] wives so much so much if we love them so
[1:05:54] much we can trust them what about God we
[1:05:58] should know God will keep his word every
[1:05:59] time I appreciate the law of perfect
[1:06:01] love well I appreciate an amen
[1:06:04] that's what it is it's love love
[1:06:06] produces faith if we can't have faith if
[1:06:08] we can have confidence is because
[1:06:10] there's fear there and we need more love
[1:06:12] of God to cast out all fear
[1:06:14] praise the Lord amen all right you got
[1:06:19] your Bibles go to acts 23 I want to get
[1:06:21] to a spot a moment here we'll get to the
[1:06:25] st. Paul just in a moment I want to
[1:06:28] bring in just another thought out I
[1:06:29] preached this before not this story I
[1:06:32] want to bring another thought out how we
[1:06:36] we love God first then the revelation of
[1:06:39] faith will come okay so love God first
[1:06:42] then the revelation of the word got us
[1:06:45] to us and then we have faith right
[1:06:46] that's right that's how it happens love
[1:06:48] God have some all fear then
[1:06:50] thumbs which is the revelation of God's
[1:06:52] Word all right so I said x-23 11 we'll
[1:06:57] get there in just a moment now let me
[1:07:03] read this quote as before we read that
[1:07:04] brother Graham talked about the maniac
[1:07:05] in Oregon I was going to kill him
[1:07:07] someone said brother Branham was you
[1:07:10] scared I said no sir not a bit imagine
[1:07:13] having somebody that's a foot taller
[1:07:14] than you 200 more pounds than you saying
[1:07:17] I'm going to kill you and he said I
[1:07:18] wasn't scared one bit not as long as
[1:07:22] Jesus is there as long as he told me to
[1:07:24] do this and I'm in his widow there's
[1:07:27] nothing to fear as long as you're doing
[1:07:30] what he says to you and you know you're
[1:07:32] directly led well then there's nothing
[1:07:34] to fear perfect love casts out all fear
[1:07:36] there's no fear in God love takes away
[1:07:40] fear so I want to start with that so see
[1:07:45] God had already talked of the RAM to go
[1:07:47] to Oregon so when he's standing there at
[1:07:49] the pulpit he has to remember God
[1:07:51] already revealed to me that he sent me
[1:07:53] here so now I have nothing to fear
[1:07:55] praise God like my dad said a preacher
[1:07:57] she got the leadership of the Holy
[1:07:59] Spirit to go on missionary and go
[1:08:02] overseas he says when they put their
[1:08:04] feet on the new ground they can say I
[1:08:06] come here in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:07] and nothing's going to hinder me God
[1:08:10] sent me to Africa God sent me to Sri
[1:08:12] Lanka or God sent me to Ghana
[1:08:14] you know God sent me here my theater
[1:08:16] here and the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:08:18] nothing's going to hinder me do you
[1:08:20] understand that it's the revelation
[1:08:22] first you gotta have the revelation that
[1:08:24] faith only comes when we've already
[1:08:26] gotten love for God we can't have any
[1:08:28] sin in our hearts you got all the all
[1:08:30] the doubts cast down all the all the
[1:08:32] negativity all the strike all the
[1:08:34] complexes on the fear that's got to be
[1:08:36] all cast down by love and then the
[1:08:38] revelation of the word comes now let's
[1:08:41] go to acts 4 2311 here I'm gonna get
[1:08:45] there - after 2311 we might read a few
[1:08:49] scriptures around their acts
[1:08:51] 2311 i want you to bring out this quote
[1:08:54] because the prophet
[1:08:55] talks about this st. Paul 2311 now
[1:09:04] we're looking at red-letter words here
[1:09:07] so this is the Lord Jesus here speaking
[1:09:09] the st. Paul now let me give you the
[1:09:12] background of chapter 23 this was right
[1:09:14] before 200 Roman soldiers took Paul to
[1:09:18] Caesarea from Jerusalem he got a two
[1:09:22] hundred soldier Roman army escort that's
[1:09:25] how much God loves his prophets sorry
[1:09:29] he gave a lot at you to retreat but in
[1:09:31] this case he gave Paul a two hundred
[1:09:33] Roman centurion soldier escort from
[1:09:36] Jerusalem assess Surya
[1:09:38] because member there was forty men that
[1:09:41] had taken a vow said we're not gonna eat
[1:09:43] till we killed Paul remember that in
[1:09:44] Scripture they violated we're not gonna
[1:09:47] eat but then Paul was the nephew Paul's
[1:09:51] nephew heard I remember that and was
[1:09:53] nephew went and he told the leader told
[1:09:55] Paul about it and then also the the
[1:09:57] guards they found out he was a Roman
[1:09:59] citizen and so now Paul's waiting for
[1:10:02] this two hundred soldier escort and what
[1:10:05] concerts he loves God so much what comes
[1:10:07] the revelation comes he's in love with
[1:10:10] God so much that red letter revelation
[1:10:13] comes to him was completed verse 11 and
[1:10:18] the night following the Lord stood by
[1:10:21] him and said be of good cheer Paul for
[1:10:24] as now has testified of me in Jerusalem
[1:10:26] so thou must bear witness also at Rome
[1:10:30] and when it was day certain of the Jews
[1:10:34] band together and bound themselves under
[1:10:35] a curse saying that they would neither
[1:10:37] eat nor drink - they kill Paul night
[1:10:40] remember that by God's grace he's all
[1:10:43] he's taking captive here Amen Jesus told
[1:10:49] in other words he said that you're going
[1:10:51] to Rome or Lydia you're going to Rome
[1:10:53] Jesus have told him and that were never
[1:10:56] found
[1:10:57] absolutely not where's the eye now he's
[1:10:59] in Jerusalem and Jesus tells them you're
[1:11:02] going to Rome hey man so in other words
[1:11:05] it's not saith the Lord I got a
[1:11:07] revelation I'm going to Rome let's take
[1:11:09] a loo say like this we need a revelation
[1:11:11] that we're going the rapture price
[1:11:12] neither undulation that we're going
[1:11:14] somewhere we need the redlener words we
[1:11:17] need goddess pay to enter into our soul
[1:11:19] to know that God is giving us his
[1:11:21] learning that his will prize
[1:11:24] glory amen now you know the story Paul
[1:11:32] gets shift assessor Rita he gets a two
[1:11:34] hundred Roman soldier guard escort these
[1:11:37] forty men can't kill Paul because he had
[1:11:40] a revelation I love Jesus and Jesus told
[1:11:42] me I'm going to Rome I don't care how
[1:11:44] many people come against you you've got
[1:11:46] a revelation crisis got to protect you
[1:11:48] all the fears cast out and love is going
[1:11:51] to protect you mate men got a race of
[1:11:53] sinners Romans uncircumcised ethan's god
[1:11:56] raises them over the government to
[1:11:58] protect his holy prophet amen
[1:12:00] why because he loved God and he all the
[1:12:03] love it casts on all the fear all had
[1:12:05] nothing to fear God will make a way amen
[1:12:07] boy on that red letters Jesus first sent
[1:12:12] policy Rome amen now if you would go to
[1:12:16] acts 28 now a lot of things happen
[1:12:20] between chapter 23 and 28 but others and
[1:12:23] a few of a memory goes to Jerusalem and
[1:12:25] they said well we can't judge him here
[1:12:27] he's for Roman citizen they send him on
[1:12:29] a boat remember the boat the ship that
[1:12:30] he wrote and they they all think oh you
[1:12:33] know if they're on it for two weeks and
[1:12:35] they'll think we're going to sink and
[1:12:36] we're gonna do all these things but Paul
[1:12:37] goes down to the bottom of the boat and
[1:12:39] he prays that the ancient Lord meets him
[1:12:41] there and said you're not gonna lose one
[1:12:43] man he said stay in the ship I remember
[1:12:45] that anyone who stays in the ships of
[1:12:48] the ship he stays
[1:12:49] the Bible said and so see Satan was
[1:12:53] trying to convince them that oh we're
[1:12:54] all going to lose our lives on the ship
[1:12:56] and Paul had the word of Lord now I've
[1:12:58] got to go to Rome and then the aged Lord
[1:13:01] told me that no one would lose their
[1:13:03] lives from this from this ship crews
[1:13:06] that were on or the ship up on a journey
[1:13:08] that were on and Satan tried to defeat
[1:13:11] that he tried to kill many but the men
[1:13:13] stayed on the ship and God's word was
[1:13:15] true don't you love what God's Word is
[1:13:16] truly it looks like it's not going to be
[1:13:19] true but God makes service where it
[1:13:21] comes to pass how they do you let's go
[1:13:23] to acts 28 first woman
[1:13:25] X 28 verse 1 now Paul he swims
[1:13:29] I think he's floating on a piece of wood
[1:13:31] if I'm not mistaken
[1:13:33] look at verse 28 sorry chapter xxi 1 and
[1:13:37] he they actually land on the island of
[1:13:39] Malita right they land on the island of
[1:13:43] Malita look at verse 1 and when they
[1:13:47] were escaped then they knew that the
[1:13:50] ayah was called Lolita and the barbarous
[1:13:53] people showed us no little kindness they
[1:13:55] were very kind for they kindled a fire
[1:13:58] and received us everyone because of the
[1:14:01] present rain and because of the cold he
[1:14:03] imagined God might give eternal life to
[1:14:05] these people just because they made a
[1:14:07] fire for God's prophet remember jesus
[1:14:10] said if you just give a drink of water
[1:14:11] you'll get a reward and here these
[1:14:14] barbarous heathen people are showing
[1:14:17] kindness that god's prophet law imagine
[1:14:19] honey would bless them tremendously look
[1:14:22] at verse 3 and when paul had gathered a
[1:14:25] bundle sticks now here's a prophet he
[1:14:27] just sat in a ship for two weeks church
[1:14:28] with very little food and water he just
[1:14:31] swam from a broken destroyed ship on him
[1:14:34] on a piece of wood all the way to the
[1:14:36] land he gets up here and while he keeps
[1:14:37] on working paul was a worker he didn't
[1:14:40] say i'm god's prophet you guys served me
[1:14:42] he goes out and gets wood for the fire
[1:14:45] he was a worker how many workers
[1:14:46] begotten here by God's grace oh the
[1:14:49] Bible says the greatest among you are
[1:14:51] the servants not those who are served
[1:14:54] but he said the greatest among you are
[1:14:56] servants so here Paul he's tired he's
[1:14:58] worn out he's not fed all the way but he
[1:15:01] still digs down deep and let the love of
[1:15:03] God move in his heart to go get some
[1:15:06] sticks and help with a fighter he's
[1:15:08] always find a way to help out a man but
[1:15:10] a servant of the Lord back glory and
[1:15:14] when Paul gathered a bundle sticks and
[1:15:16] laid them on the fire there came a viper
[1:15:18] out of the heat he just got through the
[1:15:23] trial of men wanting to kill him and
[1:15:25] then almost a sunken ship and now guys
[1:15:27] another God allows another trial to
[1:15:29] happen
[1:15:29] right after this
[1:15:30] you know what my man said the rest that
[1:15:33] the stronger you getting God the more
[1:15:34] trials you get and it doesn't make you
[1:15:38] weaker it's too perfect you is to make
[1:15:40] you a complete perfect Christian and you
[1:15:43] learn a constantine upon the Lord and
[1:15:45] lean upon his love and not our feelings
[1:15:47] and not our creases and our memory our
[1:15:49] punches
[1:15:50] that's what trials are for and Peter
[1:15:53] said they're more precious than gold any
[1:15:55] amount we can get in our bank accounts
[1:15:57] any mail we get our church treasurer cup
[1:15:59] any mail we can get in there the trials
[1:16:01] that God allows that are like actually
[1:16:02] more precious than all that filthy money
[1:16:04] what's it like that all that money
[1:16:06] they're more precious than gold the
[1:16:08] Bible says so he just got off this
[1:16:10] two-week almost starvation where people
[1:16:13] want to kill him but yet thus saith the
[1:16:14] LORD happens amen he goes on he keeps
[1:16:17] working and keeps bringing in sticks and
[1:16:19] I'm ready to reach this out and get them
[1:16:21] on the hand
[1:16:23] look over there said now this is I said
[1:16:25] all of that to get to this point inside
[1:16:27] man 1953 isn't about perfect love
[1:16:31] program said we think of the great st.
[1:16:33] Paul one-time landed on a certain island
[1:16:36] Malita the ship was wrecked God had
[1:16:38] promised him that he was going to make a
[1:16:40] certain destination Laurie here he is on
[1:16:43] the Leedom of God said you're not gonna
[1:16:45] stop and Malita you're going all the way
[1:16:47] to Rome praise the Lord he was going
[1:16:50] back to Rome and stand before Caesar and
[1:16:53] he believed God he believed God no
[1:16:57] matter who is happening on the ship no
[1:16:59] matter of two weeks of storms and almost
[1:17:01] starvation it doesn't matter
[1:17:02] God said I'm going to Rome and I love
[1:17:05] God so much
[1:17:06] I believe it's word amen and these
[1:17:08] current situations I'm not going to
[1:17:10] trust any of my thoughts or emotions I'm
[1:17:12] not gonna trust what I see with my five
[1:17:14] human senses
[1:17:15] jesus said I'm going to Rome and I love
[1:17:17] Jesus and I know he's gonna take me in
[1:17:19] her home but dad said so he was helping
[1:17:22] the man he had changed a runner my
[1:17:24] presser how put him in changed her
[1:17:26] putting the change
[1:17:26] he's got changed and he's picking up
[1:17:28] sticks can you imagine going over there
[1:17:30] he's got chains on and he's helping out
[1:17:33] and he lays his six hours and a Viper
[1:17:35] jumps out and sinks into
[1:17:38] and when he had thrown some wood down a
[1:17:42] great deadly beast serpent bit him right
[1:17:45] through the hand and the Beast was so
[1:17:49] deadly
[1:17:49] so if it been a person they usually drop
[1:17:52] dead within a minute or two
[1:17:53] and so the native said that man look his
[1:17:56] chains on him he's a prisoner he must be
[1:17:58] a murderer because he might has hit the
[1:18:01] storm but he's not gonna hit that
[1:18:02] serpent and he's gonna die
[1:18:04] so look what they thought they thought
[1:18:05] oh if he got bit by a snake and he said
[1:18:08] change he must be they're using their
[1:18:11] reasoning right well anyone that's a
[1:18:15] prisoner would be an evil person anyone
[1:18:17] remember what the jail would be an awful
[1:18:18] person and then all this snake bit him
[1:18:22] not open think it must be an awful
[1:18:24] person he's gonna die here's a Bob
[1:18:29] Anderson he said this he said a moment
[1:18:34] he said Paul looked and seen this the
[1:18:36] Viper he said there is not a speck of
[1:18:39] fear because Jesus said they take up
[1:18:43] serpents and it will not harm them he
[1:18:46] looked at that deathly bite no fear if
[1:18:49] you fear and Satan steps in Satan's fear
[1:18:54] but perfect love casts out all fear fear
[1:18:57] he said there you are Paul said I am
[1:18:59] God's man there hangs a serpent but
[1:19:02] there is not one speck of fear here or
[1:19:04] there see it's all in harmony they said
[1:19:08] why Paul aren't you too afraid you'll
[1:19:09] fall dead he said why certainly not
[1:19:11] I can't fall then the Holy Spirit's
[1:19:14] inside of me now the very holy spirit
[1:19:17] that made the heavens the earth had that
[1:19:19] man so charged with this power Oh glory
[1:19:23] till the death in that bag of the
[1:19:25] servant wouldn't even go into his body
[1:19:28] in man
[1:19:29] because his whole body was full of that
[1:19:31] spirit just as it's full of blood nidia
[1:19:36] beautiful dark rays of the Lord I hope
[1:19:40] you got that his body was so full of
[1:19:43] love let me go back to that here his
[1:19:47] body was so full of love
[1:19:51] his body used so called the Holy Ghost
[1:19:54] boy from his soul out to his mind that's
[1:19:56] the Holy Ghost anointing on him
[1:19:58] what is that the poison come into his
[1:20:00] body brother Branham said because he was
[1:20:02] stilled love amen he said that every
[1:20:08] little cell of blood is a light and
[1:20:10] there you are all charged full of the
[1:20:12] Holy Ghost
[1:20:13] why certainly they walked on water
[1:20:14] they've done great miracles why they
[1:20:17] were so perfectly in harmony with God
[1:20:19] that first church and Christian friends
[1:20:22] we got to get back to that it's a
[1:20:24] perfect love and confidence in God is
[1:20:26] just what brazen we may shout be buddy
[1:20:29] speak with tongues he made me break
[1:20:31] teachers of theology have DVDs hanging
[1:20:33] on it but it'll never work until this
[1:20:35] comes in harmony with God's love hey man
[1:20:39] is that beautiful this soldier this
[1:20:41] prophet went through all of these hard
[1:20:44] things and because he had love of God
[1:20:46] going out because he had revelation that
[1:20:49] he was going to Rome he didn't fear one
[1:20:51] bit
[1:20:51] he just threw the Viper in the fire
[1:20:53] Romero said he sent that devil right
[1:20:55] back to Hell where he came from
[1:20:56] hey Penn he didn't fear I got hit by
[1:21:00] serpent her Viper I'm gonna cast it down
[1:21:05] [Music]
