[26:55] grace of Lord I like to look at times
[26:58] and seasons again and in 1st Kings 17
[27:01] verse 1 like to start therefore our text
[27:05] from the word of the Lord how many
[27:08] believe this is thus saith the Lord to
[27:10] you praise God amen I believe that it's
[27:15] God's will for you and I for skiing 17 1
[27:19] 2 7 so let's look at this little type
[27:21] here and of course the Prophet preached
[27:23] this message spiritual food in due
[27:25] season 1965 so I'm holding some quotes
[27:28] from that just a wonderful message it
[27:30] was the evening message he had preached
[27:32] anointed ones at the end times in the
[27:33] morning and then in the evening he
[27:36] preached the sort of message on
[27:38] spiritual food and due season and typing
[27:41] it out to today
[27:42] and how we're in need of the food of God
[27:46] today praise the Lord we need a special
[27:47] food today aren't you glad for the food
[27:50] of God amen
[27:51] every time we open up this Bible God is
[27:53] speaking to us with this food for each
[27:54] day and it's fresh every day praise God
[27:58] 1st Kings 17 verse 1 and Elijah the
[28:02] Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of
[28:04] Gilead sat under a hab as the Lord God
[28:07] of Israel liveth before whom I stand
[28:08] there shall not be do nor rain these
[28:11] three years but according to my word and
[28:14] the word Lord came unto him saying get
[28:16] the hence and turn the eastward and hide
[28:19] thyself by the brook
[28:20] earth that is before Jordan and it shall
[28:23] be that thou shall drink of the brook
[28:25] and I have commanded the Ravens to feed
[28:27] thee there so he went and did according
[28:31] unto the word of the Lord for he went
[28:33] and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is
[28:35] before Jordan and the Ravens brought him
[28:38] bread and flesh in the morning and bread
[28:40] and flesh in the evening and he drank of
[28:42] the brook let's read verse 7 together
[28:45] one two three and it came to pass after
[28:49] a while that the brook dried up because
[28:52] there had been no rain in the land amen
[28:54] let's have a word of Prayer
[28:55] if ever need on your heart just making
[28:57] known unto the Lord here as we pray
[29:00] Heavenly Father were grateful again to
[29:02] take you this one day to Time Lord or we
[29:05] know this is a marathon Lord you told us
[29:07] to lay aside any sin that easily besets
[29:11] us any weight that would hinder our race
[29:13] Lord he told us to lay it aside father
[29:15] we do that now Lord help everyone that's
[29:17] that's listening to do that now Lord God
[29:20] that we lay aside anything hindering our
[29:22] running speed in our course Lord and
[29:25] father we just ask Lord God you take
[29:27] this word and break it to our hearts
[29:29] Lord God help us to see this spiritual

[29:56] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[29:58] name and the church said Amen god bless

[30:26] bang and SIA they're still not here okay
[30:27] hey bruh and God bless you Sarah good to
[30:29] see you
[30:29] I told everybody about that little
[30:30] testimony about your uncle so thankful
[30:33] for that
[30:34] we missed Karen and Brenda's birthday
[30:36] where Brenda's was yesterday and then
[30:38] Lilly's coming up on the 19th and Wendy
[30:40] on the 27th let's give the birthday
[30:41] people around flowers god bless you Lord
[30:45] grant you another year of wonderful
[30:47] faithful service to his great name so we
[30:50] appreciate everybody and birthdays are a
[30:54] nice time to reflect reflect on the
[30:57] great blessings of the year not always
[30:58] nice to come those numbers but but is a
[31:05] real blessing to see God's mercy for
[31:07] another year amen
[31:08] and also you know the world is
[31:10] celebrating st. Patrick's Day this was
[31:12] course the day he died but he was a real
[31:15] Saint
[31:15] we know Pratt Patrick was a real Saint
[31:17] each year I get to show a video in the
[31:19] classroom and and it shows how God he
[31:22] heard the call of God after after he was
[31:24] taken as a slave to Ireland and was a
[31:27] shepherd there and I was ready reading
[31:29] an article about him yesterday in his
[31:31] journal he said as a shepherd as a slave
[31:33] he was he was very peaceful and he said
[31:36] that time was the time he got to talk
[31:38] and learn to pray to God and he said he
[31:41] prayed all day with this she said he
[31:42] prayed all night with the sheep then he
[31:44] heard the call of God to go back and so
[31:46] we went back to Rome and saw in a bad
[31:48] condition he devoted his life to serving
[31:51] the Lord and then the church there in
[31:53] Rome sent him to Ireland where he spent
[31:55] 20 as a missionary
[31:57] so we know he was a Roman Catholic we
[32:01] know that he's a real Saint that's why
[32:04] they called him Saint so you know not
[32:08] really like a holiday for us but it is
[32:12] nice to remember great Saints like that
[32:15] that adored of their life to the Lord
[32:16] and how many one devote your life to all
[32:18] your life to the Lord praise God that
[32:20] you're a saint
[32:21] and we know you don't have to be dead to
[32:22] be a saint you can be a living Saint
[32:24] so thank God that we're living Saints
[32:27] today so let's look at part thirteen
[32:29] here of this times and seasons and trust
[32:31] be a blessing to you by the grace of the
[32:34] Lord I've ever really been enjoying this
[32:37] little series here Lydia I do have quote
[32:39] to you if you'd like to share them by
[32:42] God's grace so we read our text and I
[32:49] like to I actually forgotten the order
[32:52] of these notes I'm actually going to
[32:54] start with a little different text so if
[32:55] you have your Bibles I believe it's in
[32:58] Daniel chapter 7 let's turn there for a
[33:00] moment and then we'll look at the next
[33:03] one Elijah so I guess I get had these a
[33:05] little bit out of order so let's go to
[33:07] Daniel 7 and I was able to get through
[33:11] all 150 of those quotes where brother
[33:13] Branham talked about times in seasons so
[33:15] I'm finished with that study so I'm very
[33:18] thankful to find the completion of that
[33:21] and all that seemed worth Graham said
[33:25] about that times and seasons so Daniel
[33:33] chapter 7 now
[33:40] the chapter begins with a look at the
[33:43] beast
[33:43] there's four beasts and we know them we
[33:46] know them as the the times of the
[33:47] Gentiles and the Bible said that their
[33:50] lives would be prolonged for a season at
[33:54] a time and so let's look at a few
[33:57] scriptures here and we'll be able to go
[33:59] through these and kind of review these I
[34:01] think in 2017 I preached a little series
[34:03] on the whole book of Daniel so this is a
[34:05] little bit of review so I'm in Daniel 8
[34:11] no wonder I couldn't find it there
[34:12] Daniel 7 here we go yeah Daniel 7 and
[34:19] look at verse 7 we'll start to over 7 so
[34:21] in verses 1 and 1/2 3 we have the beast
[34:25] and then verse 4 is nebuchadnezzar
[34:27] babylon verse 2 is Medes and Persians as
[34:30] the bear Nebuchadnezzar was the lion
[34:35] sorry and then verse 6 is
[34:37] Alexander the Great and the Grecians
[34:41] like an under leopard and then in verse
[34:43] seven and I saw in the night visions and
[34:46] behold a fourth beast dreadful and
[34:47] terrible and strong exceedingly and had
[34:50] great iron teeth notice that iron teeth
[34:55] everywhere this beast goes it's crushing
[34:57] and it's it's it's smashing out real
[35:01] Christian life right it's trying to
[35:04] smash out any desire for anyone to have
[35:07] a real walk with Jesus Christ trying to
[35:09] smash it up it devoured and brake in
[35:13] pieces and stamped the residue with the
[35:15] feet of it and it was diverse from all
[35:18] the beasts that were before and it had
[35:20] ten horns which we know are the ten
[35:23] dictators spoken of in revelation 17 the
[35:27] future dictators here that will unite
[35:30] with the harlot verse eight and I
[35:32] considered the horns and the behold
[35:35] there came up among them another little
[35:36] horn that's the Antichrist before whom
[35:39] there were three of the first horns
[35:41] plucked up by the roots and behold in
[35:45] this horn were eyes like the eyes of man
[35:48] and a mouth speaking great things all
[35:52] right now verse 9 and I beheld till the
[35:58] thrones were cast down in the Ancient of
[36:00] Days did sit whose garment was white as
[36:03] snow and the hair of his head like pure
[36:05] wool does that remind you Revelation
[36:06] chapter 1 Jesus Christ with hair like
[36:09] wool his throne was like the fiery flame
[36:12] and his wheels as burning fire
[36:16] ah what a throne and a fiery stream
[36:19] issued and came forth from a form
[36:21] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[36:24] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[36:27] stood before him the judgment was set
[36:29] and the books were open I was kind of
[36:32] expecting to hear a little shot of Amen
[36:34] there because those those thousand
[36:37] thousands were you and I brother man
[36:40] said who ministers to the husband but
[36:43] the wife
[36:44] Gouri seems like it was a little tired
[36:47] today so maybe Lord will help us to wake
[36:49] up a little bit yeah what was that
[36:51] daylight savings catching up with you
[36:54] maybe maybe all we're sick this week may
[36:57] God grant you say Amen so see judgment
[37:02] so this is judgment so we're fast
[37:05] forward to the judgment there the the
[37:07] judge since the Ancient of Days Jesus
[37:09] Christ with white hair and thousands
[37:12] ministered to him that's got to be his
[37:14] life and then thousands stambha form as
[37:17] well
[37:18] probably the Jews maybe or maybe it's
[37:22] the angels or maybe it's maybe it's all
[37:25] those being judged verse 11 and I'd be
[37:27] happy because of the voice of the great
[37:29] words which the horn spake I beheld even
[37:31] till the beast was slain and his body
[37:35] destroyed and given to the burning flame
[37:37] all right
[37:39] verse 12 as considering the Beast they
[37:42] had their dominion taken away yet their
[37:44] lives were prolonged for a season and
[37:47] time so see the Beast here were all done
[37:53] away with right
[37:54] we know Babylon was done away with by
[37:56] the Medes and Persians that was in the
[37:57] lifetime of Daniel but you know Medes
[37:59] and Persians last a lot longer and
[38:01] weren't done away with till later when
[38:03] Alexander fell and then the Rome in the
[38:08] Roman Empire lasted about fifth century
[38:10] AD and then that fell it was wounded
[38:14] which had a wound like unto death but
[38:16] the Bible said that she got a got a new
[38:19] lease on life and that was through the
[38:22] the holy or the unholy Roman Empire and
[38:25] so those other beasts were to play with
[38:28] but here the Bible says that this little
[38:31] horn would had to be dealt with and of
[38:35] course that's the Antichrist and so the
[38:38] Bible describes that season in time this
[38:41] is quite a time right this is a quite a
[38:43] long length of time that this beast
[38:46] rules here
[38:47] so this beast was in Rome the Roman
[38:49] Empire now in the Holy Roman Empire it's
[38:52] been about 2,000 years for this season
[38:54] so sometimes season or short remember
[38:56] Wednesday night so
[38:58] robear said you could have a season of
[38:59] Prayer after a service
[39:01] so sometimes season are really short 10
[39:03] minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes sometimes
[39:06] seasons can be 2000 years so we see that
[39:11] from the scripture remember that was the
[39:13] Ancient of Days which was Christ a touch
[39:17] this is quite let me just say this is
[39:19] the most deepest Godhead scripture I've
[39:22] ever read as Daniel 7 I think maybe I've
[39:24] shared this before I don't know but here
[39:26] we is we see in verse 9 the Ancient of
[39:29] Days sits and he's likened to a man
[39:31] right he's got a garment and he's got
[39:34] hair like wool and then it's quite
[39:37] shocking to me because one like the Son
[39:40] of Man comes and stands before the
[39:42] Ancient of Days now this is where
[39:44] Trinitarians will say it's two persons
[39:46] now to me how it's saying there is no
[39:48] such thing as two persons okay so to me
[39:52] what has happened is that either this
[39:54] could be one of two things either the
[39:57] Ancient of Days could have been there
[39:59] and this could have been speaking about
[40:01] a time in the future or it could have
[40:04] happened that God had God had a
[40:06] theophany that looked like Christ there
[40:08] but then when Jesus's body came there
[40:11] maybe that's theophany change into a
[40:14] pillar of fire maybe it was just a
[40:15] glowing light or something like that but
[40:18] one thing we know for sure God never
[40:19] said I'm two persons so just so you know
[40:23] Trinitarians will use this verse 9
[40:26] Daniel 7 9 and 13 because they make it
[40:28] look like to one person come stands in
[40:30] front of another now we know that's not
[40:32] scriptural in fact that's what the
[40:34] Mormon prophet Joseph Smith saw he said
[40:37] God it has two personages he said when
[40:39] when God met him to tell him to write
[40:41] the Book of Mormon he said he saw two
[40:44] personages he said he saw an old man and
[40:46] he saw Jesus the son well he probably
[40:48] got it from a false interpretation of
[40:51] the scripture because you'll never see
[40:53] two persons but bromium said what
[40:56] happened was that when Jesus came and
[40:58] took the book out of the right hand of
[41:00] the right hand was just symbolic but
[41:03] brother Branham said all that happened
[41:05] was that the supernatural God changed
[41:08] his mask and he went from a light to
[41:10] being a
[41:11] praise the Lord so he just changes form
[41:14] so here's what I believe happened
[41:16] I believe the Ancient of Days were
[41:18] sitting there and then when the body of
[41:19] Christ came that I believe he just must
[41:21] have transformed back into or changes
[41:24] mass back into a pillar of fire that's
[41:27] what I believe but I could be wrong but
[41:29] notice what it says here the beasts had
[41:33] their lives prolonged for a season and a
[41:36] time and the Bible said there as we read
[41:41] in verse 14 let me read it again so I
[41:47] haven't read that yet no ya verse 13 is
[41:50] when I saw in the night visions and one
[41:52] like the Son of man came with the clouds
[41:54] of heaven and came to the Ancient of
[41:55] Days and they brought him near before
[41:57] him so that's where they would say verse
[42:00] 13 there that's where they would say
[42:02] that it's two personages but the Bible
[42:04] never says that amen so he cannot add to
[42:07] the word although it's mysterious we
[42:09] cannot add to the Word of God and in
[42:11] verse 14 and there was given him
[42:13] Dominion and glory the speaking of
[42:14] Christ and the kingdom that all people
[42:17] nations and languages should serve him
[42:19] his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[42:21] which shall not pass away and his
[42:23] kingdom that which shall not be
[42:26] destroyed a man Lori thank God for that
[42:29] amen
[42:30] there's coming a kingdom and it's a
[42:32] thousand-year Kingdom praise God and it
[42:35] shall now pass away and all nations the
[42:37] Bible said the Bible said all nations
[42:40] will pay tithes and offerings into this
[42:42] great Kingdom price of the heart and the
[42:44] Bible said all nations will come to
[42:46] worship before Jerusalem during this
[42:48] millennial reign and the Bible said also
[42:50] this is something I learned this morning
[42:51] read the scripture the Bible said also
[42:53] that they'll keep the Sabbath amen
[42:56] God will make this entire world during
[42:58] the Millennium keep the Sabbath amen so
[43:02] it's like God went from one day a
[43:04] physical day to a spiritual day and then
[43:08] he goes back to a physical day again
[43:09] which is interesting amen
[43:11] they'll even have to force to keep the
[43:13] Sabbath now thankfully for us we get to
[43:15] keep most Sabbath's
[43:16] Sundays our Sabbath praise the Lord but
[43:20] also the baptism of Holy Ghost is the
[43:23] real Sabbat today
[43:24] because that's the rest Isaiah said this
[43:27] is the rest with stammering lips and
[43:30] another tongue when I speak to this
[43:32] people amen that's the rest I want you
[43:34] to have is the rest from your sins and
[43:37] rest in the power of God amen
[43:41] so I feel sorry for people that they
[43:44] only get the rest on Saturday my I get
[43:46] the rest Sunday and every other day I
[43:48] get the rest from that sinful nature and
[43:51] I get to live with the divine nature of
[43:53] Jesus Christ amen
[43:54] that's a pretty good elbow there
[43:55] hopefully my elbows okay thank you lord
[44:01] praise the Lord now program tells us
[44:03] this in Revelation 14 he said the Beast
[44:06] was wounded unto death but lived again
[44:09] is Imperial pagan Rome that fell to the
[44:12] onslaught of the barbarians and thereby
[44:15] lost her temporal power but she regained
[44:18] it in papal Rome you see it the nation
[44:22] that ruled by crushing all and which
[44:24] became the strongest Empire ever known
[44:26] was finally wounded to death her power
[44:29] was gone physically as controlled by
[44:31] armies etc but under Constantine she
[44:34] came back to life for papal Rome has
[44:36] infiltrated the whole world and her
[44:38] power is absolute so just like amp the
[44:44] Roman Empire would go into a city and
[44:46] divide the city in conquered so does the
[44:49] the Roman Catholic Church today they'll
[44:52] take their false doctrines and though
[44:54] though go into two churches right as we
[44:58] know people the message have seen this
[45:00] they'll send in Jesuits like our brother
[45:02] down in North Carolina
[45:04] they sent Jesuits into his church and
[45:06] and tried to become good friends then
[45:08] tried to divide the church and the Holy
[45:11] Spirit picked it up and and called it
[45:13] out and thank God that the Holy Spirit
[45:16] is the discerner of the thoughts and
[45:17] tents of our hearts amen to be able to
[45:20] CERN those evil thoughts intents of our
[45:22] hearts but also they go into families
[45:25] because mother have said in in Daniel
[45:28] that the feet were a mixture of iron and
[45:30] clay and that's how Rome conquers out
[45:34] people that's our Rome crushes people's
[45:36] faith
[45:38] Satan will trick believers into marrying
[45:41] someone who's not a believer and then
[45:42] mother Ram says when you have two people
[45:45] either one's gonna make the other one
[45:47] like that one like Christ or the other
[45:49] weak one's gonna pull the other strong
[45:51] one down
[45:52] he says gonna be one of the other that's
[45:55] why if you're the believer the Bible
[45:57] said you're you gotta live sanctified in
[45:59] your home the Bible said your life
[46:00] sanctifies the life of the one who
[46:02] doesn't believe amen now that is
[46:06] sanctifies the children praise God so if
[46:09] you're the real believer you got to be
[46:10] strong hallelujah you got to cling to
[46:13] God's Word you got to be faithful
[46:15] hallelujah you got to be a soldier in
[46:17] the army of God but that's how brother
[46:20] banana said Daniel saw role would
[46:23] conquer so today it doesn't have to be
[46:27] well I didn't marry Catholic or alright
[46:29] things like that it can anyone who's
[46:31] it's not a real believer right and that
[46:34] person's life will eventually smash out
[46:36] and crush the person's spiritual life
[46:39] who really wants to serve God because
[46:42] they start compromising on the Word of
[46:44] God but how many no there's no
[46:45] compromise in the life of a Christian
[46:47] hey there's no compromise but this is
[46:52] how Satan with those iron Tina picture
[46:54] that a beast with iron teeth teeth and
[46:57] he wants to crush your spiritual life he
[46:59] wants to crush your Bible reading your
[47:01] prayer time right here was to crush your
[47:06] devotion to God's Word and he crushes it
[47:09] slowly because it's a beast right and if
[47:11] they don't you fast animals chew slowly
[47:13] we have a little cat now in the midst
[47:15] our house and that cat will bring up
[47:17] animal carcasses and just chew it slowly
[47:19] and so they the tutor get to see that
[47:21] all the time of crushing it you know get
[47:24] the mouse or whatever they got and
[47:26] that's what this beast does this is what
[47:29] the Roman Church does that spirit behind
[47:32] it that spirit of death help me know
[47:35] that's the horse rider today spiritual
[47:37] death it's slowly you know he's just not
[47:41] one service you you died during that
[47:43] service it's over the course of a month
[47:45] in a week and years and and it crushes
[47:48] the life so there's no more
[47:50] there's no more faith there's no more
[47:52] real confidence in God's Word and the
[47:55] people take on a denominational
[47:57] anointing rather than God's holy
[47:59] anointing can very see that by God's
[48:04] grace it was it was given life and
[48:07] prolonged for a time and sees in two
[48:10] thousand years papal Rome's been really
[48:14] influential since around no 325 AD with
[48:18] Emperor Constantine uniting church and
[48:19] state where we're familiar with that and
[48:22] so it slowly crushes with iron teeth
[48:26] people's spiritual lives we have to make
[48:29] sure Church were not being the ones
[48:31] crush we've got to make sure we're
[48:32] crushing Satan's Kingdom because the
[48:34] Bible said you can bruise Satan under
[48:36] your heel and then you and I are the
[48:41] crushers amen we're supposed to crush
[48:44] that almost temptations all the mind
[48:48] battles all over the US and all the
[48:50] pride we're supposed to crush that and
[48:52] cast it out of our lives amen either
[48:56] getting crushed or your question I'm not
[49:01] going to be crushed by Satan I'm gonna
[49:02] crush him because I'm more than a
[49:04] conqueror in Christ Jesus now look he
[49:08] says the Roman Catholic Church uses
[49:10] Kings and merchants and in her deadly
[49:12] religious and financial strength she's
[49:14] governing as the goddess of this present
[49:16] age she's also the dragon that stood
[49:19] waiting to devour the manchild Hera
[49:21] tried to kill Lord Jesus and fail later
[49:23] Jesus was crucified by Roman soldiers
[49:25] but now it's caught up to the throne now
[49:30] remember in Daniel 7 remember the lion
[49:33] representing the Babylonians the bear
[49:36] means mem everybody remember this
[49:38] picture when I showed it a few years ago
[49:39] leopards ancient Greeks and here's the
[49:41] iron teeth now that doesn't really give
[49:43] much description to the beasts it just
[49:45] said I had iron teeth and horns but
[49:47] that's the Roman Church that's what you
[49:49] and I are fighting today not necessarily
[49:51] that color or something like that but we
[49:53] are fighting a beast how many can say
[49:55] amen to that you know a couple of Sunday
[49:58] nights ago I ended with the full armor
[49:59] of God that all have been encouragement
[50:02] for us to fight this thing
[50:04] have you ever had an animal you had to
[50:06] fight off your property right have you
[50:09] ever had that you got to fight and
[50:12] that's a mentality like we're not
[50:13] fighting the air or the wind
[50:16] we're fighting a spiritual power of
[50:18] death and the only way to defeat death
[50:21] is by life amen and so the life of God
[50:25] the Word of God must be in our mouths
[50:28] right we must have the shield of faith
[50:29] the sword of the way and we must realize
[50:32] we're fighting this immoral beasts and
[50:35] to know that we're more than conquerors
[50:37] and we can't overcome by the power of
[50:38] God remember when I said these four
[50:43] beasts combined into one beast in
[50:46] Revelation 13:1 210 and I'm not going to
[50:48] go through that I think the next chapter
[50:51] we're on in our series is chapter 13 so
[50:54] maybe I'll get to that Wednesday those
[50:56] four beasts combined into one beast now
[50:58] that's some other artist illustration of
[51:00] all those beasts together you know got
[51:02] your leopard got your bear got your line
[51:04] and got your you know got your horns
[51:07] there so they're all kind of mixed
[51:08] together and of course that's the I
[51:10] think that's the Vatican I'm not
[51:11] mistaken and that's a pretty good
[51:13] picture I like that picture it's a
[51:15] pretty good representation of what's
[51:17] happened as the dragon stands there at
[51:20] her seat in Rome and so remember Daniel
[51:25] 2 is just a different picture of this
[51:29] does ever understand that this is the
[51:30] same thing the four divisions here are
[51:33] the four beasts it's just another
[51:35] picture of it does ever understand that
[51:36] and then they're all combined into one
[51:39] in Revelation 13 thank God for the
[51:42] revelation of the Holy Spirit today now
[51:45] you know Daniels not a mystery to us
[51:47] revelation is not a mystery just why
[51:49] because God sent us Elijah to restore
[51:51] things amen and the whole purpose of
[51:55] Secrets that Deuteronomy 29:29 says the
[51:59] whole secret is that the children of God
[52:02] might know the word of God and do the
[52:04] commandments of God a mad that's why God
[52:08] want you to be his friend so you can do
[52:10] his word I don't know if you listened on
[52:14] Wednesday but I brought enough that
[52:15] little thought it was very important
[52:17] there's
[52:18] one thing required to recognize that
[52:20] beast and it's wisdom let me know that
[52:22] that's all this wisdom if you have
[52:24] wisdom you can know that Hills if you
[52:26] have wisdom you'll know the mark or the
[52:28] number 666 you'll need that and how do
[52:31] you get wisdom James said just ask God
[52:33] for wisdom wisdom is so easily
[52:39] accessible it's kind of like his self
[52:42] I'd say it cuz it's compared to that
[52:45] osteology all it takes to apply that
[52:47] broad is just plain common hyssop that's
[52:49] all you need to get wisdom to recognize
[52:51] this beast it's just a plain simple
[52:53] prayer well that ought enlighten us that
[52:56] most people are not saying sincere
[52:58] prayers if all nations are going to take
[53:00] the mark of this beast and if all the
[53:02] nominations are going to take the mark
[53:04] of the beast
[53:04] it shows you what selfish prayers
[53:07] they're praying you and I must pray
[53:10] selfless prayers we must that's why
[53:12] every player should either end or start
[53:14] with let thy will be done not my will
[53:17] amen there's very few people that are
[53:20] praying honest sincere prayers today
[53:23] because all is required for wisdom to
[53:26] recognize the false church and be part
[53:28] of the true church is a prayer for
[53:30] wisdom and most people won't even get
[53:32] that because they can't even pray in
[53:35] that powerful the real father is that
[53:38] struck me the other day I was right in
[53:39] need on the next chapter in the book
[53:40] like mine that means most people just
[53:43] pray for God give me food God give me
[53:46] money God give me a marriage God give me
[53:49] a house God give me a big car yeah they
[53:51] just pray for lustful things but you and
[53:54] I when I when we lift our voice to God
[53:56] you say God though you slay me will
[53:58] trust you let your will be done then I
[54:00] go through fiery trials all I want to do
[54:02] is sit on your throne with you amen
[54:05] hallelujah
[54:06] the Lord's give me the character of
[54:08] Jesus Christ hey hey
[54:10] hallelujah let me not love the world nor
[54:14] the things in the world let me love the
[54:16] world to come that heavenly kingdom that
[54:19] millennial reign the kingdom of the son
[54:21] of David amen ha ha very sort of feel
[54:24] good here amen
[54:25] thank the Lord but also it is there's
[54:28] just it's changing his master
[54:30] just like God changed his mast Satan
[54:32] does the same thing tries to imitate God
[54:34] he just changes his mask and now he's
[54:37] this combined beast with all the parts
[54:40] of the of the the animals and if a hides
[54:44] behind all these now I'm not
[54:46] stereotyping all the priests I know
[54:47] there's some good priests but a hides
[54:48] behind a white collared priest can I
[54:52] take your children in a caddy kiss them
[54:54] and many times they abuse them in
[54:55] catechism behind walls and at high it
[55:00] doesn't look like this is the Catholic
[55:02] and Lutheran priest look like that nope
[55:04] they sure don't look like that but
[55:07] they're all polished up with their white
[55:09] collar odd and deceptive it's so
[55:11] deceptive thank God that Jesus gave us I
[55:15] self you can rub on your eyes and now
[55:18] you can see behind all the false
[55:20] religion you can see behind that and you
[55:23] can give the person the word test to
[55:25] know what they believe about God's Word
[55:27] thank God for I south praise the Lord
[55:31] or Khun grease whatever if you remember
[55:35] remember that story that's that's good
[55:38] stuff you see but those are eyes it's
[55:42] got to be open to the things of God Paul
[55:44] said that to I your eyes be enlightened
[55:46] and illuminated to the things of God
[55:51] thank the Lord
[55:53] that's just another picture now remember
[55:55] Abraham broke it down and he even broke
[55:57] it down to a fifth part so one two three
[55:59] four but the fifth part was the
[56:01] catholicism and protestantism that's
[56:02] where we're at right now as we said they
[56:05] the Catholic Church tries to crush out
[56:08] people by intermarrying into their
[56:10] families and say oh we're all the same
[56:14] we're all the same we are we and that's
[56:18] where the processes are going to get
[56:19] caught up
[56:20] you know when they unite with the Roman
[56:22] Catholic Church they're going to unite
[56:23] on the fact where we at least we believe
[56:25] in the Trinity at least we believe God's
[56:28] three gods I mean three persons they're
[56:29] going to say at least we agree on that
[56:33] but see that proves that churches that
[56:36] won't rebuke you know the weather the
[56:41] iron Beast
[56:42] it proves that their dog
[56:44] of the mother glory but when we stare
[56:49] with the word and we withstand the iron
[56:52] bars and when we rebuke that iron beasts
[56:55] it proves were sons and daughters of
[56:57] Almighty God Amen that's right
[57:01] hallelujah
[57:02] see when they compromise and say oh
[57:04] we're all the same we can all worship
[57:06] together someday we it's okay that you
[57:08] you transform that bread and wine into
[57:11] the literal body and blood of Christ
[57:12] it's okay that you believe in the
[57:14] Trinity it's not okay now we're hoping
[57:15] some of those people get saved right but
[57:18] we don't United with that and we can't
[57:20] agree with that because it doesn't agree
[57:22] that's not God's understanding and
[57:23] there's a beast behind that trying to
[57:26] crush out people's spiritual lives I
[57:29] think we understand I love this picture
[57:32] I just had to show it because at the end
[57:34] of it Jesus Christ comes back and the
[57:36] Bible said he don't hit the head you
[57:38] don't hit the the breasts and arms you
[57:39] don't have the thighs he hits the feet
[57:42] amen
[57:43] he is that woman and the Protestant
[57:47] marriage he hits that and destroys it
[57:50] because that's where we're at in the
[57:52] timeline of God and the nice thing is
[57:54] we're right behind him he leads the way
[57:56] and God's own son will be the leading
[57:59] one but we're right behind the leading
[58:01] one on what horses amen that's the best
[58:05] kind of war you can show up to is where
[58:07] you just stand behind the leader the
[58:08] leaper does all the work and you just
[58:09] sit back and say thank the Lord that's
[58:12] the best kind of war I think I could
[58:13] ever be in is if Christ took scare took
[58:16] care of all the enemies for me praise
[58:18] God oh thank you Jesus not that we're
[58:21] not that we'd be afraid of fighting but
[58:24] that we're so thankful that our captain
[58:27] our general is so strong he don't need
[58:29] us to fight because he wants us to fight
[58:32] right now our time to fight is right now
[58:35] the church said this is our time to
[58:37] fight once you die or once you get
[58:39] raptured then there's no more prayer
[58:40] Me's right then there's no more church
[58:42] services there's no more witness and
[58:43] there's no more of that our time to
[58:45] fight is right now so let's put on the
[58:47] full armor of God
[58:48] hey man let's look for these times and
[58:51] seasons here happening around us now
[58:56] let's get yeah I just I didn't I didn't
[58:58] realize that was first so now let's get
[59:00] to our text here first Kings 17 one two
[59:03] seven now I could probably teach a whole
[59:05] sermon on this but Lord winning I just
[59:07] tried to hit the highlights here as I
[59:11] was looking at the sermon yesterday now
[59:16] I want to read a few things here now
[59:18] elijah during this time had a secret
[59:20] place that God had ordained him to go to
[59:23] that's the thing we want to see now just
[59:25] before we have the prayer line Elisha
[59:27] had a secret place provided by God
[59:28] himself now the church never provided it
[59:31] for him I love that the Jewish church
[59:33] never provided this place for the King
[59:37] never provided it for him he didn't
[59:39] provide himself even praise God but God
[59:44] provided a secret place for Elisha to be
[59:46] fed all the time during the drought
[59:49] where his food was provided day by day
[59:52] he didn't need to wonder what's going to
[59:54] happen tomorrow whether or one of the
[59:56] supplier to run out God said I commanded
[59:59] the Ravens and they'll feed you what a
[1:00:02] wonderful thing a type of our secret
[1:00:05] place in Christ hallelujah
[1:00:09] now church this is on another note this
[1:00:12] is the only time in scripture I've seen
[1:00:14] where a group of birds are used for good
[1:00:19] instead of bad
[1:00:20] remember we preach on that a few weeks
[1:00:21] ago remember all the birds that ate the
[1:00:23] butler's off the butler's basket and he
[1:00:26] died remember all the birds
[1:00:27] Abraham shooed away which represented
[1:00:29] the hymn casting out Devils and remember
[1:00:31] the birds came and ate up all the season
[1:00:33] Jesus said that was Satan snatching away
[1:00:35] this is the one time in the scripture
[1:00:37] I've found that Birds actually represent
[1:00:39] something good and I don't understand it
[1:00:42] I'll be honest I understand it but God
[1:00:44] used these birds to feed his prophet
[1:00:47] praise God when the world counts on all
[1:00:52] that's going on today that says the days
[1:00:54] of miracles has passed the great powers
[1:00:56] of God has been taken out of the
[1:00:58] churches they seem like it anymore they
[1:00:59] don't have nothing but a sounding brass
[1:01:01] and a tinkling cymbal
[1:01:02] we know that to be the truth and a form
[1:01:04] of godliness in denying the power of
[1:01:05] their church most church members I know
[1:01:08] they believe in miracles how many would
[1:01:11] agree with me every friend I know except
[1:01:14] I think I've only met one or two
[1:01:16] Christians over my entire life that
[1:01:17] didn't believe in miracles 1 or 2
[1:01:20] everybody else no matter whether it's
[1:01:22] Catholic or Lutheran or parent pet of
[1:01:25] course Pentecostals do they believe in
[1:01:27] miracles so it must have been a move
[1:01:29] that was more popular in mother Bram's
[1:01:30] day but see they won't believe in the
[1:01:34] miracle of God sending a prophet with a
[1:01:38] message with and that's the main part
[1:01:42] today is the message praise God the
[1:01:46] message is what brother M was talking
[1:01:48] was pointing us to the message they
[1:01:52] won't believe in that miracle no they
[1:01:54] will believe most of them won't believe
[1:01:56] in the miracle of wearing modest clothes
[1:02:00] maybe they believe in healing miracles
[1:02:03] and cancer being here to thank God
[1:02:04] leukemia is here which we agree thank
[1:02:06] God for that but they can't even accept
[1:02:09] the miracle of dressing modest according
[1:02:11] to 1st Timothy 2:9 in this sad church
[1:02:13] the pick-and-choose gospel they give out
[1:02:15] there they make the gospel buffet but
[1:02:18] the gospel is not a buffet it's a
[1:02:21] three-course meal justification
[1:02:23] sanctification
[1:02:26] it's that choose whatever you want and
[1:02:29] leave we're not leaving nothing behind
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:31] if God gives me a meal I'm eating all of
[1:02:35] it because I know he knows I need to eat
[1:02:37] all of it amen
[1:02:39] well I don't want any st. vacations I'm
[1:02:42] gonna leave I'm gonna leave that there I
[1:02:44] would select a to dress sexy I still
[1:02:47] like to do that I still like to take my
[1:02:49] shirt off as a man and try to show off
[1:02:51] how strong I am and wear short shorts
[1:02:53] when I go running or something like that
[1:02:54] I like everybody see what it's home
[1:02:56] person I am
[1:02:57] no God there's a new buffet style God
[1:03:00] said take all of it or none of it right
[1:03:03] Jesus then take up your cross and follow
[1:03:06] me
[1:03:07] hallelujah that's right now we realize
[1:03:11] that we're facing some of the greatest
[1:03:14] hours history's ever known
[1:03:17] because that beast is upon us it's
[1:03:19] trying to smash how every person right
[1:03:23] because it's going to be a worldwide
[1:03:24] mark of the beast that beast is smashing
[1:03:27] churches even today this morning that
[1:03:30] beast is chewing churches and trying to
[1:03:34] get them not to stand on God's Word did
[1:03:37] you see last week the leaders of the
[1:03:39] Mormon Church met in the Vatican with
[1:03:40] the Pope did you see that they've been
[1:03:43] separated for centuries it said and now
[1:03:47] they found common ground on the water
[1:03:50] baptism and father said Holy Ghost
[1:03:52] oh the leaders of the Mormon Church see
[1:03:58] he's little doubt there Luther some of
[1:04:01] the most outspoken against the Catholics
[1:04:06] you see wait we don't even realize
[1:04:09] something sometimes do we miss these
[1:04:10] things this is one of the greatest hours
[1:04:13] where the Beast has almost smashed every
[1:04:15] church he's almost chewed up and spit
[1:04:17] him out right hate to be that graphic
[1:04:21] but he's chewed up their church their
[1:04:23] zeal for God and spit it out where
[1:04:27] people have no backbone anymore
[1:04:29] there's no stand they don't even know
[1:04:31] what they believe it doesn't mean
[1:04:32] anything to him anymore they're not
[1:04:35] fighting against evil anymore but you
[1:04:40] and I have to fight the good fight of
[1:04:41] faith it's a fight now I try to do my
[1:04:46] fight with as much smiling as I possibly
[1:04:48] can
[1:04:48] well I disagree with you up at but this
[1:04:50] is what we believe but there's time
[1:04:52] where it does get a little intense he
[1:04:57] says it isn't exactly the war ahead with
[1:04:59] the bright shiny missile with a head on
[1:05:01] it that we should be afraid of it's the
[1:05:03] church's
[1:05:04] we should be afraid of now of course we
[1:05:09] know God does not give us a spirit of
[1:05:11] fear so that's not Rams not saying okay
[1:05:14] you and I need to be scared of churches
[1:05:16] now be scared of anyone who goes to a
[1:05:18] church it's not a message Church that's
[1:05:20] not what he's saying he's saying it's an
[1:05:23] hour we're living in we should watch but
[1:05:25] notice God made a way for Elijah to
[1:05:27] escape it and he's made a way for his
[1:05:29] believing children to escape it
[1:05:30] now the wrath and things that is to come
[1:05:33] so the words we must be aware we must
[1:05:37] watch and make sure that that
[1:05:39] denominational spirit of death doesn't
[1:05:41] try to smash out chew up our spiritual
[1:05:44] eyes and make us cold and complacent and
[1:05:47] weaken the faith that we stop fighting
[1:05:49] against these things we got to be strong
[1:05:51] and courageous amen and stay with the
[1:05:54] word of God in our head is that true
[1:05:59] my elbows feel a lot better thank you
[1:06:01] lord praise God I really gave that a
[1:06:04] good smash I thought I was gonna start
[1:06:06] seeing blood coming either
[1:06:07] thank the Lord one time Tim Myers was
[1:06:10] preaching up here he went like that and
[1:06:11] he hit this corner his fingers started
[1:06:13] to bleed and he just kept on preach
[1:06:15] that's right that's all I got suffering
[1:06:18] for Jesus thank God we whatever he got
[1:06:20] to suffer we just want to do God's will
[1:06:21] he said remember he went to his secret
[1:06:24] place by the plan of God by the call of
[1:06:26] God and the Word of God Elijah in his
[1:06:29] secret place by God's foreknowledge or
[1:06:31] plan and the call upon his life in the
[1:06:33] court of the word if that ain't the way
[1:06:36] we entered I don't know why we get so
[1:06:40] Berlin says just like Elijah was called
[1:06:43] by God to go someplace all private
[1:06:47] secret so have you and I been called to
[1:06:50] go there as well amen I'd say it's more
[1:06:53] than this church this church is a good
[1:06:55] place to start on your road to the brook
[1:06:58] of sheriff but this church is not
[1:07:00] exactly the book of chair but this
[1:07:03] church will point you to the brook of
[1:07:05] chair and that's heavenly places by the
[1:07:08] Holy Ghost in hice Jesus so but is it we
[1:07:14] can go there too we should know what
[1:07:16] it's like to be down there at the brook
[1:07:19] Cherith why sure do I don't know about
[1:07:22] you but I know what it feels like to be
[1:07:24] alone I don't know it feels like to have
[1:07:25] a drought where everyone around you just
[1:07:28] doesn't want to hear about God and no
[1:07:30] one wants to talk about God and no one
[1:07:32] feels like they've got any real urgency
[1:07:33] for God oh it's hard it's wilderness
[1:07:36] it's hot it's dry the world's dying but
[1:07:39] God promised to feed us twice a day amen
[1:07:43] morning and evening in that striking how
[1:07:46] in Moses day they had a morning and
[1:07:49] evening sacrifice and shouldn't you
[1:07:52] start today with prayer and feeding on
[1:07:53] the word and then shouldn't you end the
[1:07:56] day with prayer worship and singing and
[1:07:59] feeding on God's work shouldn't you do
[1:08:00] that I think that's a good idea don't
[1:08:02] you have you got any free time between
[1:08:04] that's a good time to do it too it is
[1:08:08] it's striking morning and evening those
[1:08:12] sacrifices those times of feeding on
[1:08:14] God's Word if Elijah had to be fed that
[1:08:17] way how much more do we got to be fed
[1:08:18] that way spiritually and notice before
[1:08:22] the job began Elijah went in this place
[1:08:24] of secret for his living a very type
[1:08:27] before the judgment starts to strike the
[1:08:29] earth the church has already called out
[1:08:31] the bride has already chosen and just
[1:08:33] waiting before judgment strikes already
[1:08:35] waiting eating the food of God enjoying
[1:08:37] the blessings of God any man as normal
[1:08:39] mind knows that were headed straight
[1:08:40] were right in the hour of judgment now
[1:08:44] notice we went in by the he went in by
[1:08:46] the plan of God the foreknowledge call
[1:08:47] of God and the Word of God and went in
[1:08:50] before the drop set in now we know that
[1:08:52] judgment is ready to strike
[1:08:54] and then brother Graham tells a story of
[1:08:56] 1964 when he through was what he throw
[1:09:01] in the air of the rock that's right I
[1:09:02] was gonna say dust but is rock he threw
[1:09:04] the rock in the air and he said thus
[1:09:06] saith the Lord judgment was struck at
[1:09:07] the west coast
[1:09:08] he said I went on a pray a little bit
[1:09:10] and I said his judgment striking the
[1:09:13] west coast look at her today look at
[1:09:14] what happened a few hours after that
[1:09:15] Alaska sunk almost and now the whole
[1:09:18] thing is going under we're entering in
[1:09:20] the judgment mercy has been spurned how
[1:09:22] many know that last year California had
[1:09:24] the worst fires in their history I mean
[1:09:25] know that and I had religious people
[1:09:30] emailing me say can't you see God's
[1:09:33] judgments is on California and I'm like
[1:09:35] yeah God's prophets said that about 50
[1:09:36] years ago but the same way that said
[1:09:40] that wants to keep women preachers I
[1:09:42] said well you can't do that but see they
[1:09:46] can recognize they can look at it say
[1:09:49] guess the West Coast is going to be
[1:09:51] judged but can't
[1:09:53] discern all the Word of God can't eat
[1:09:56] all the Word of God oh thank God that we
[1:09:58] can eat all the Word of God thank God
[1:10:01] you don't spit that up and say well I
[1:10:03] could never do that or I could never
[1:10:04] believe that I don't want to eat God's
[1:10:06] Word if God laid his food in front of
[1:10:08] you you and I should be first to eat all
[1:10:10] of it ain't it true even though it's
[1:10:13] hard trust it it'll come out right it'll
[1:10:15] make you feel good it'll make you grow
[1:10:17] strong in God he'll keep you healthy
[1:10:20] that's for sure
[1:10:22] Devlin keep you healthy he said but
[1:10:26] thanks be to God we got hidden food
[1:10:28] spiritual food that we're living on the
[1:10:31] goodness and mercy of the revelation of
[1:10:33] Jesus Christ in these days cookery
[1:10:35] vindicating himself among his people
[1:10:38] amen
[1:10:39] he said they went in Elijah went in
[1:10:41] before the Johnson in I was thinking
[1:10:43] sister Karen how many times have you
[1:10:44] heard of sister Karen a couple maybe a
[1:10:50] score 20 I appreciate don't you
[1:10:53] appreciate you faithful Saints like that
[1:10:55] when I preached that one on the
[1:10:57] astronauts and their CEO how it exploded
[1:11:00] she said we heard that preach two thirty
[1:11:01] years ago and she wasn't upset about it
[1:11:03] she was happy about it she's heard it
[1:11:06] and she believed it and listen church
[1:11:08] she stayed faithful to it amen that's
[1:11:12] all y'all want a testimony of
[1:11:14] faithfulness hallelujah you and I being
[1:11:17] faithful to the faithful one himself
[1:11:20] Amen the faithful witness hallelujah
[1:11:23] Haim it will never be as faithful as him
[1:11:25] but God help us to be as faithful as we
[1:11:28] can amen hey man let's just return to
[1:11:32] some of that faithfulness that he showed
[1:11:34] us he went right in before the judge
[1:11:38] drops it in thank God for being in
[1:11:40] before the judgement sets in now is the
[1:11:43] time of coming out and going in getting
[1:11:45] how those organizations getting into
[1:11:47] Christ are coming out and going in time
[1:11:49] for all true believers then he was gone
[1:11:52] and Satan there remember he never left
[1:11:55] that Brook until God called him and
[1:12:01] after
[1:12:01] was over he called him out there down
[1:12:03] the widow's house notice he called to
[1:12:06] this Widow and this Widow had not
[1:12:08] associated herself with the unbelievers
[1:12:10] nor taken the mark of the beast during
[1:12:14] the drought Amen so he called so Elijah
[1:12:18] called to sustain the woman the widow
[1:12:21] they just had one little cake one little
[1:12:24] thing she was holding on to and Elijah
[1:12:26] said give me that first for thus hit the
[1:12:28] Lord that bear will not go empty neither
[1:12:30] will the cruse run dry until the day
[1:12:32] that the Lord God sends rain upon the
[1:12:34] earth putting God first his word first
[1:12:39] so in the midst of a drought we learned
[1:12:41] that God will sustain us with to
[1:12:44] spiritual meals a day right and then
[1:12:48] when he sends it and then here we know
[1:12:51] God sustained his prophet by the woman
[1:12:54] putting God first right and we know that
[1:12:58] types us putting the message of putting
[1:13:00] the revelations of this day putting this
[1:13:03] force of our family above work a girl
[1:13:07] friends the word must be first above
[1:13:09] everything notice there was me on the
[1:13:14] Barrow every time he/she swen after meal
[1:13:16] there was meal in the barrel there was
[1:13:18] oil in the Cruze every time she went for
[1:13:20] why meal represented Christ than me
[1:13:21] offering the burgers had to be set just
[1:13:24] right to grind every one of them every
[1:13:26] bird of this meal exactly the same
[1:13:27] showing that he's the same yesterday
[1:13:29] today in forever that was the word the
[1:13:31] bread of life following the message to
[1:13:33] vindicate the word oh thank God every
[1:13:40] time church we dig down in this right
[1:13:42] every time we dig down this Bible
[1:13:44] there's more food for us isn't there
[1:13:46] glory
[1:13:49] biblical numerology holiday spiritual
[1:13:53] food and new season the book of
[1:13:56] Revelation every time when we go Lord I
[1:13:59] need to hear from you God speak to me
[1:14:01] every time we dig back in there
[1:14:03] something comes out when we needed amen
[1:14:06] hallelujah church members can't say that
[1:14:09] I have a lot of friends of family that
[1:14:11] say the only reason they go to churches
[1:14:12] is for the music they've told me that
[1:14:15] my face many times or so their kids have
[1:14:18] a good Sunday school which that's good
[1:14:21] as long as they teach the Bible but what
[1:14:24] they're saying is that every time they
[1:14:26] reach down and the preacher tries to
[1:14:29] preach them he don't have nothing to
[1:14:31] reach from he can't get any meal they're
[1:14:35] barrels empty but we don't serve a God
[1:14:37] with the empty barrel we serve a God was
[1:14:39] a supernatural barrel then every time we
[1:14:43] have a need of the world we just got to
[1:14:45] go to the world and pull something out
[1:14:47] and there it is the food for our season
[1:14:50] amen
[1:14:52] thank the Lord amen
[1:14:55] at least that's what I experienced when
[1:14:56] I come to church I hope you can say Amen
[1:14:58] to that tooth absolutely thank the Lord
[1:15:03] that's so true so it is today friends so
[1:15:07] it is today that's the bread of life
[1:15:09] that that children eat on follows the
[1:15:11] message of God to sustain them during
[1:15:13] the time of the drought what if he stood
[1:15:15] not presents today so the thing about
[1:15:16] that what if he stood in our presence
[1:15:18] right now he would act and do just
[1:15:21] exactly like he done the days when he
[1:15:22] was in flesh on the earth the brightest
[1:15:25] part of the husband and the church is
[1:15:26] the same as Christ the works that I do
[1:15:28] shall you do also and is the word that
[1:15:31] done it he told us that the things that
[1:15:34] he would do that we would do also praise
[1:15:38] God
[1:15:39] so picture that if Jesus Christ was here
[1:15:42] today he would act the very same way he
[1:15:45] acted with his disciples not sure I
[1:15:48] believe this I think I hope you'll agree
[1:15:50] to he would act a little more different
[1:15:53] though with us because we're born again
[1:15:55] and in many of those stories his
[1:15:57] disciples weren't born again so
[1:15:59] thankfully hopefully Jesus wouldn't have
[1:16:00] to rebuke me I hope it wouldn't have the
[1:16:04] idea Lord would you just want to send
[1:16:05] fire and burn up all the Episcopalian
[1:16:08] churches or all the you know that's the
[1:16:10] class that John had right John had this
[1:16:12] spirit and Jesus said you don't know
[1:16:13] what spiritual so hopefully he'd act a
[1:16:17] little bit differently hopefully he'd
[1:16:19] get more done because we'd all be in
[1:16:21] harmony by the Holy Spirit but if you're
[1:16:26] wrong then you know Christ would correct
[1:16:29] - if you got the wrong attitude toward
[1:16:31] your wife or your husband you got the
[1:16:33] wrong attitude toward your parents you
[1:16:34] got the wrong attitude towards work then
[1:16:37] be assured Christ would correct to you
[1:16:40] because he corrected everybody came in
[1:16:42] contact with right the high priest his
[1:16:46] disciples Peter his mom his dad
[1:16:47] everybody
[1:16:48] Jesus was the word and the Lord always
[1:16:51] is corrective God my prayers this God
[1:16:55] just helped me to see when I'm wrong
[1:16:56] please help me to see when I'm wrong
[1:16:58] that I can be corrected I don't want to
[1:17:01] be a prideful soul that can never be
[1:17:03] corrected and think I know everything
[1:17:04] about everything God help us to be
[1:17:06] humble that we can be corrected by the
[1:17:07] word because remember he said if you
[1:17:11] want to learn for me you got to be meek
[1:17:12] and lowly of heart you got to be a meat
[1:17:15] Christian yes strong in faith strongly
[1:17:17] against that iron teeth be strong in
[1:17:20] that way but when it comes to learning
[1:17:22] and hearing from Christ we're gonna be
[1:17:23] meek and lowly all nothing Jesus just
[1:17:27] show me where I'm wrong correct me if
[1:17:29] I'm wrong I'm just such a sometimes I'm
[1:17:32] a failure if I if I want if I don't obey
[1:17:34] your commands I'm such a failure but
[1:17:36] with your spirit I'm an overcomer don't
[1:17:39] beat yourself up and no saying sends you
[1:17:42] long garsten no not at all but remember
[1:17:45] we must be meek and lowly to learn from
[1:17:47] God hope that gives the right balance
[1:17:49] there by God's grace now we notice here
[1:17:52] again let me set a timer here so I don't
[1:17:56] where you all out if the word is
[1:18:00] innocent has come to us as it did elijan
[1:18:02] that day it would be the same thing that
[1:18:04] he did he would feed on the secret
[1:18:06] things of God which is hid from the
[1:18:08] world Oh
[1:18:09] again it makes the message in the
[1:18:11] messenger as one the spiritual fruit is
[1:18:14] ready and it's the season now and each
[1:18:17] one of you can have this food if you
[1:18:18] wish it if you're willing to steal away
[1:18:21] from all the unbelief on this hour
[1:18:24] if you're ready to come into Christ and
[1:18:26] come into his promise been that
[1:18:28] beautiful you got to steal away in other
[1:18:31] words you have to leave any unbelief
[1:18:32] behind and you've got to gather and
[1:18:34] rally around faith in God's Word
[1:18:36] that's what church services often do
[1:18:38] right church services are supposed to
[1:18:40] preach faith
[1:18:41] buh-bam said ministers are
[1:18:42] to raise up your faith to believe all of
[1:18:45] God's promises program said to raise
[1:18:50] faith in Christ there's ministers that
[1:18:52] are is your faith in Christ and that's
[1:18:55] what I've been trying to this morning I
[1:18:56] hope by God's grace you can see that
[1:18:58] we're in a time of drought we're at a
[1:19:00] time when that iron teeth beast is
[1:19:02] smashing and crunching everyone almost
[1:19:04] everyone spiritual life who they don't
[1:19:06] they're not their prayers are not being
[1:19:08] heard they're all selfish prayers and we
[1:19:10] have a chance we have a very slim chance
[1:19:12] before the door closes to be the bride
[1:19:14] of Jesus Christ to prey on his prayers
[1:19:17] to be real sincere Christians and to
[1:19:19] humble ourselves and learn from the
[1:19:21] almighty one before he comes back and
[1:19:24] snatches his wife away from the devil
[1:19:26] before the tribulation starts all right
[1:19:28] I was a mouthful breaks God we have a
[1:19:31] small opportunity to be that bride to
[1:19:36] steal away from any unbelief once you
[1:19:38] desire that church God take all unbelief
[1:19:41] out of my heart in mind help me not to
[1:19:43] doubt and as we said on as we said on
[1:19:45] Wednesday I don't know if you heard
[1:19:47] about Amen but we kind of went over
[1:19:48] brother I'm speaking to the mountain I
[1:19:49] don't know if you heard it did you hear
[1:19:50] it
[1:19:50] okay I went over that with program said
[1:19:53] speak to the mountain he said the only
[1:19:54] way you can speak to this mountain is
[1:19:56] when God anoints you to have that kind
[1:19:57] of faith so brother Aaron said he used
[1:20:00] to think it was man doing it without the
[1:20:02] atonement or wonder was it can a man do
[1:20:04] that without being led by God but then
[1:20:06] he realized no the only way he can speak
[1:20:08] to a mountain is if the atonement
[1:20:10] anoints him or God spirit annoys him to
[1:20:12] speak God's Word he said I wouldn't
[1:20:16] preach that for years because I didn't
[1:20:17] understand it can a man speak anything
[1:20:19] and just speak whatever he wants and God
[1:20:21] will honor it no God will only honor
[1:20:23] what he anoints you to speak so that's
[1:20:26] the importance of being anointed and
[1:20:27] that's why it's good to be here because
[1:20:29] God likes to anoint his people here and
[1:20:31] then Mary amen this is where God anoints
[1:20:36] us raise up our faith feeds us
[1:20:38] strengthens us correct us there's so
[1:20:40] many benefits to being in the house of
[1:20:42] God hallelujah let's go to real quick
[1:20:47] back to Hebrews 10 see when you
[1:20:51] physically come to church
[1:20:53] I just want to rehearse that it's been
[1:20:54] on my heart lately Hebrews 10:25
[1:21:00] physically coming to church remember
[1:21:03] it's like Mary and Martha Jesus says
[1:21:05] whatever you receive when you're sitting
[1:21:07] at the feet of Jesus it cannot be taken
[1:21:09] from you amen
[1:21:11] any revelation you receive at the feet
[1:21:13] of Jesus the devil cannot take it away
[1:21:15] from you that's one reason we gather at
[1:21:18] the feet of Jesus the other one here is
[1:21:21] there's lots of reasons but verse 2024
[1:21:26] Hebrews 10:24 and let us consider one
[1:21:29] another to provoke unto love and to good
[1:21:31] works so we come to church we're
[1:21:35] supposed to look at other people and see
[1:21:36] how can we encourage them how can I help
[1:21:38] them how can i minister to them and if
[1:21:42] somebody looks down and say can I pray
[1:21:43] for you or if we find out somebody needs
[1:21:45] something we can try to help them out
[1:21:47] see we're supposed to look at each other
[1:21:49] and say Lord can you want me to help
[1:21:52] Jose or do me to help Lidia who do you
[1:21:55] want me to help it Lord let me help back
[1:21:56] we should come here and consider one
[1:21:58] another that we can provoke or inspire
[1:22:02] them to love God more and to do good
[1:22:05] works I hope that's what you get when
[1:22:07] you come to Bride of Christ fellowship I
[1:22:09] hope you feel people's love and I hope
[1:22:11] you walk out of here wanting to do good
[1:22:13] works and to love God more praise God if
[1:22:16] not you then get a little closer to each
[1:22:19] one of us right amen because I know
[1:22:22] that's what church does to me that's why
[1:22:24] I come to church right here to grow and
[1:22:26] love and to be inspired to do more for
[1:22:29] the kingdom of God you know God put it
[1:22:33] on our brothers heart lately uh - let me
[1:22:38] just share this okay God put it on
[1:22:41] brother Aaron's heart lately to ask
[1:22:42] about brother Jason now how many of em
[1:22:44] brother Jason when he become well I kept
[1:22:46] I reached out to him a few times hadn't
[1:22:48] heard from him and he encouraged me to
[1:22:50] reach out to him again so I did well I
[1:22:51] just heard from him this morning and he
[1:22:53] said well I want to give that big
[1:22:55] security guard guy a big bear hug he
[1:22:57] said he said thanks for being so
[1:22:59] concerned he got a job so thank God for
[1:23:01] that but
[1:23:01] working him seven days a week and he
[1:23:04] said make sure you tell that brother
[1:23:05] amen he said what a good song leader he
[1:23:07] is I can show you to you afterwards
[1:23:08] brother see that's just one example of
[1:23:11] when it used like when people are in the
[1:23:13] house of God they're missing out on love
[1:23:15] and inspiration because the Bible said
[1:23:19] when you gather you consider one another
[1:23:21] unto love provoke them to love and good
[1:23:24] works when I see a men being so
[1:23:27] faithfulness music ministry it makes me
[1:23:29] want to be fed more faithful to my
[1:23:30] preaching ministry and it's likewise
[1:23:33] right well I see bang is a faithful
[1:23:34] father like man lord help me I just want
[1:23:36] to be more faithful to my family that's
[1:23:38] true that's true
[1:23:39] I appreciate that brother bang I do it
[1:23:42] does I see our sisters stand on the
[1:23:45] faith a mix omits any opposition or
[1:23:49] divided houses and all these things when
[1:23:51] I see faith like that it makes you want
[1:23:53] to stand more for Christ amen it's
[1:23:56] inspiring
[1:23:56] we are inspirations to one another
[1:23:59] because it's God working through us
[1:24:02] verse 25 see not forsaking these
[1:24:05] somethings are of ourselves together see
[1:24:07] when when when people don't come to
[1:24:08] church they're abandoning the rest of
[1:24:11] the army I'll tell you it's hard to
[1:24:16] fight that iron teeth Beast all by
[1:24:18] yourself I don't even know what it's
[1:24:23] like so I don't I know you want to try
[1:24:25] and that's all by God's grace keeping me
[1:24:27] healthy I come to the house of God
[1:24:29] because something could happen I could
[1:24:30] miss I could be in the hospital thank
[1:24:32] God he's kept me protected I'm never
[1:24:35] willingly walked away from church since
[1:24:37] I heard this message never but see look
[1:24:41] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:24:45] ourselves together abandoning the army
[1:24:48] while they fight so when we come
[1:24:49] together church we're fighting we're
[1:24:50] fighting spiritual affairs you might not
[1:24:53] see it but I'm trying to kill off all
[1:24:56] these demon doubts amen
[1:24:59] how do you yeah I'm trying to fit off
[1:25:03] and cut away all these prideful spirits
[1:25:05] all these lustful spirits now sometimes
[1:25:07] I look like I'm physically doing it
[1:25:09] right I'm punching the pulpit and
[1:25:10] everything like this but in the
[1:25:11] spiritual the words that are coming out
[1:25:14] of my mouth
[1:25:15] but my words but God's words they're
[1:25:18] finding is demon powers here - all up
[1:25:21] you overkill and set us all free in the
[1:25:23] name of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:25:26] this is an army here this is a lawyer
[1:25:28] we're fighting and when people don't
[1:25:30] come they're abandoning the fight and
[1:25:34] they're missing out on love and
[1:25:36] inspiration oh I'm so inspired how many
[1:25:40] times have I talked about sister
[1:25:41] Brenda's in the inspirational testimony
[1:25:43] how many times of Jose been healed and
[1:25:45] just when they got healed or when they
[1:25:46] tell us this morning it's just such
[1:25:47] inspiration my I could serve God the
[1:25:51] rest of my life it just gives you that
[1:25:54] inspiration god help me to be faithful
[1:25:58] help me to keep fighting the good fight
[1:26:00] of faith as the manner of some is but
[1:26:06] exhorting one another no that means just
[1:26:09] encouraging one another the word
[1:26:10] actually means encouragement so much the
[1:26:14] more as you see that Day approaching
[1:26:15] that's why I like to do to Sunday
[1:26:17] services and most of the year I do but
[1:26:19] there's times I gotta cancel see I want
[1:26:23] to gather more as I see that Day
[1:26:24] approaching don't you I'm gonna gather
[1:26:28] more and fulfill this scripture so
[1:26:34] that's just a little brief look so let
[1:26:36] me try to close here I you know give me
[1:26:37] a couple minutes I got a couple more
[1:26:38] minutes here is that helpful by God's
[1:26:42] grace that's this is so we're a
[1:26:44] spiritual worse getting spiritual food a
[1:26:46] new season here this morning so that
[1:26:49] we're that we don't get overcome and
[1:26:51] that we don't get can't say like this I
[1:26:52] know it's graphic but so we don't get
[1:26:54] eaten alive by this beast this fourth
[1:26:57] beast that's a mixture of all the other
[1:26:59] ones picture that beast I had up there a
[1:27:00] while ago would you like to invite that
[1:27:02] guy well if you're a Christian you do
[1:27:05] find him and you overcome by the sword
[1:27:06] of the word but in the natural you
[1:27:09] wouldn't want to find a line like that
[1:27:10] in the natural it remembers
[1:27:16] Hamas's in malachi for luke 1730 Saint
[1:27:18] John 14:12 the works that I do show you
[1:27:20] do also praise God and how many more
[1:27:23] scriptures of telling Joel 2:28 he says
[1:27:26] rather what he would do in the last days
[1:27:29] and how the prophets said that it be
[1:27:30] light in these last days how it would
[1:27:32] work and what it would do in all the
[1:27:34] scriptures pointing to these last days
[1:27:35] and that is Christ if you can hide away
[1:27:40] in that now in that secret place you can
[1:27:42] eat and see the goodness and mercy of
[1:27:44] God if you're sick there's healing there
[1:27:48] and notice they don't know when he
[1:27:51] called fire down from the heavens and so
[1:27:53] forth and improved his sending of God
[1:27:54] this prophet spirit notice in the word
[1:27:57] is when he was lying there done under
[1:27:58] the juniper tree and angel come down
[1:28:00] with that same kind of meal and baked
[1:28:02] some cakes and fed him and a little
[1:28:04] later on he put him to sleep again and
[1:28:07] woke him up and he had some more meal
[1:28:09] cakes baked there for him and he went in
[1:28:11] the strength of those cakes for forty
[1:28:13] days glory to God he's the same
[1:28:14] yesterday today and forever oh ha we
[1:28:16] love him spiritual food in its season so
[1:28:19] this is a story of God just feeding
[1:28:20] Elijah and all the hard times there's a
[1:28:24] big drought God will feed you by the
[1:28:25] brook and then during that time there's
[1:28:27] a widow's house God's gonna feed him
[1:28:29] there and then after he has a great
[1:28:31] victory and he runs scared for his life
[1:28:33] from Jezebel God's got food for him now
[1:28:38] is that encouraging even after the
[1:28:40] anointing left Elisha he just called
[1:28:42] fire down from heaven he ran away from
[1:28:44] Jezebel God still had food for him even
[1:28:47] though he wasn't anointed I say like
[1:28:51] this in the midst of your hardest trial
[1:28:53] God still has food for you praise God
[1:28:57] God didn't say you know what Elijah I'm
[1:29:01] done with you anointing is not on you
[1:29:03] you're not living the right way no food
[1:29:05] for you
[1:29:07] mercy God in fact no matter that God
[1:29:11] said send the angel with the softest
[1:29:14] wings and the softest hands and take
[1:29:18] Elijah some cakes hallelujah
[1:29:20] and feed him he's a tire Pope in other
[1:29:22] words God has compassion on his children
[1:29:25] when the
[1:29:26] go through the sorbs hallelujah and God
[1:29:30] wants you to know how much he loved you
[1:29:31] and he's gonna send you some food in the
[1:29:34] right season how we love him spiritual
[1:29:42] food in its season it's not meet to take
[1:29:45] the children's bread and give it to dogs
[1:29:47] Jesus said didn't Jesus say the same
[1:29:48] thing to the saira Phoenician woman he
[1:29:50] was sent to his own that's right and
[1:29:52] that's who he he would come he never
[1:29:54] went to the gentle house and now he
[1:29:55] visits the Gentiles in their time and is
[1:29:58] not meet in other words does not meet
[1:29:59] for God to give his word to the
[1:30:02] denomination's
[1:30:03] right it wasn't me to give the Jewish
[1:30:07] word Jesus word to Gentiles it was only
[1:30:10] me Jesus would give it to the Jews only
[1:30:12] go to my people lost house of the sheep
[1:30:14] of Israel
[1:30:15] now with the Gentiles it's not me to
[1:30:18] give them sorry is not fitting to give
[1:30:20] the meat to we'd say the mother harlot
[1:30:24] you say why is it that the message don't
[1:30:28] go out in these great big places these
[1:30:30] big Crusades like amongst the
[1:30:32] denominations how come my pastor brother
[1:30:34] Jesse doesn't get invited to the big
[1:30:35] conventions for Assemblies of God or
[1:30:39] United Pentecostal or the Lutheran
[1:30:44] Assembly how come how come brother cam
[1:30:46] doesn't get invited to the Catholic
[1:30:48] seminary convention to preach brother
[1:30:52] present is not their food it's not for
[1:30:55] them it's not the church so-called food
[1:31:00] it's the bride's food it's spiritual
[1:31:03] food in season it would make them sick
[1:31:06] to their stomach and doesn't a church
[1:31:07] it's too rich for them you can't do it
[1:31:14] but for the children it's bread it's
[1:31:17] life it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:31:19] yesterday today and forever now let's
[1:31:26] send our fee
[1:31:27] gets into a prayer line I just want to
[1:31:29] show you what he calls spiritual food
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:35] church I used to go to a lot of churches
[1:31:37] you did to proudly that they couldn't
[1:31:39] handle this kind of preaching couldn't
[1:31:41] handle it
[1:31:42] Karen's been visiting something lately
[1:31:43] they couldn't handle this preaching you
[1:31:47] know why it's not because it's not the
[1:31:48] right food it's the right food glory
[1:31:51] thank god this is - the trouble is it's
[1:31:54] too rich for them their taste buds
[1:31:58] haven't been trained to the glorious
[1:32:00] taste of God's work amen like your
[1:32:05] little children can't handle the spices
[1:32:07] and they can't handle vegetables of all
[1:32:08] things
[1:32:09] did brother ham say his message was a
[1:32:12] bunch of vegetables the great juicy see
[1:32:16] they're living on junk food only not
[1:32:17] healthy every day then whatever no the
[1:32:20] organic seed one of God amen of the
[1:32:25] skirt the real healthy food of God's
[1:32:28] Word is for you and I we can stomach it
[1:32:31] while they can't because you know most
[1:32:35] of them can't even handle milk lip meat
[1:32:38] of the word of God literally Church they
[1:32:42] have no spiritually spiritually they
[1:32:44] have spiritual IVs hooked up they can't
[1:32:46] even handle the meat of God's Word what
[1:32:50] do you mean what do you mean people can
[1:32:52] hang on them and do miracles and go to
[1:32:54] hell what do you mean brother Ram said
[1:32:56] that sermon right there was meet annoys
[1:32:59] ones the end time that's meat what do
[1:33:02] you mean my pastor is wrong even though
[1:33:03] that's a smoke and drink and strip our
[1:33:05] clothes and bathe out publicly in our
[1:33:07] underwear nude and yet we still have
[1:33:09] miracles what do you mean he's wrong
[1:33:10] preacher he is he is is that right
[1:33:15] Church they can't hit there
[1:33:19] spiritual Ivy they're just hanging on
[1:33:21] and this is this is why they crank up
[1:33:22] the music like that they're trying to
[1:33:24] get people under emotion just to have
[1:33:26] some supernatural thing happen so they
[1:33:28] can still feel like they're right with
[1:33:29] God because when the word comes they
[1:33:32] can't handle any of the real word very
[1:33:35] little the real word
[1:33:36] so god help us not to just want to have
[1:33:39] an IV and just barely get along
[1:33:41] spiritually God help us they eat the
[1:33:43] strong meat of the word and gross
[1:33:44] piercing grow strong so we can really
[1:33:47] fight off this beast power with the
[1:33:49] ayran teeth and crush it under the feet
[1:33:53] of God's bride a glory that we're not
[1:33:59] crushed but we crush Satan's Kingdom but
[1:34:04] Bram says we're getting too late now if
[1:34:05] we don't start the prayer line now so
[1:34:06] this bow our heads just a moment
[1:34:08] dear God food in due season spiritual
[1:34:10] food something that the world knows
[1:34:13] nothing of how we hear our Lord say that
[1:34:16] night or that day down there samara the
[1:34:18] same place that elijah walked up and
[1:34:19] said why the dew will not fall until I
[1:34:21] call for here Jesus stood there telling
[1:34:23] his disciples say master why don't you
[1:34:26] eat he said I have food that you know
[1:34:28] not of truly Lord his food was to do the
[1:34:32] will of God to see the works of God made
[1:34:34] manifest in his hour he was there to see
[1:34:37] that it was done I do nothing except my
[1:34:39] father shows me first what the father
[1:34:41] shows me that I do and father so it is
[1:34:46] today the church the true believer the
[1:34:47] body believers has access to food
[1:34:50] spiritual food that the nominals know
[1:34:52] nothing about the world knows nothing of
[1:34:55] this food father but your church your
[1:34:57] people the brand of your son loves it
[1:35:00] Amen let's just thank the Lord Kelly the
[1:35:04] bride loves the food of God the Word of
[1:35:07] God
[1:35:08] she loves it amen not ashamed of this
[1:35:12] kind of preaching I might be embarrassed
[1:35:14] like in my flesh if somebody said did
[1:35:15] you preach this tomorrow I might be
[1:35:17] ashamed after a while you get me in the
[1:35:19] right under the noid thing I'll say yeah
[1:35:20] I'm not ashamed of that
[1:35:21] that's God's Word when it kind of gets
[1:35:25] shaken out of that you know how you get
[1:35:26] surprised sometimes by the devil's
[1:35:27] attacks one side you know you have to
[1:35:29] get punch one time you're kind of
[1:35:31] stunned a little bit
[1:35:32] well lets you get back from that and
[1:35:34] kind of get your senses no the Bible
[1:35:36] does say this the bible does say that
[1:35:38] the bible does say that and know that
[1:35:39] we've got a prophet that said thus saith
[1:35:42] the lord to back it up the first punch
[1:35:46] might stun you tomorrow but just get
[1:35:49] back from it shake off yeah shake off
[1:35:51] the the dizziness and get back to
[1:35:54] fighting the good fight of faith that's
[1:35:56] what I've seen at least that that's
[1:35:57] that's how it is to me church the devil
[1:35:59] seems to punch me when I'm not looking
[1:36:00] for it when I go into a situation I'm
[1:36:02] ready to fight and they don't want to
[1:36:04] fight it seems like when I'm just maybe
[1:36:06] a minute busier in a hurry trying to get
[1:36:07] something done that's what Satan wants
[1:36:09] punch me catch me off-balance try to get
[1:36:12] me to compromise but thank God for the
[1:36:14] smelling salts of God's Word you know
[1:36:16] you give those boxers smells and sauce
[1:36:17] to kind of wake him up are they gone for
[1:36:19] the salty Christian life that we can
[1:36:21] live
[1:36:25] he said we have access to healing of our
[1:36:27] bodies when the doctors is failed we
[1:36:30] have access to this it's one of the
[1:36:32] foods of God so see now what is food
[1:36:35] food is a promise of God here in the
[1:36:37] Bible
[1:36:38] whether it's healing whether it's faith
[1:36:41] right whether it's wisdom financial help
[1:36:45] whatever whatever need you have it's one
[1:36:48] of God's food items he can give you
[1:36:52] that's right he said he gave his church
[1:36:54] and promised in the last stages but
[1:36:56] children and father help us to be
[1:36:58] believe me children for all things are
[1:37:00] possible to the believers granted dear
[1:37:02] Lord we ask in Jesus name Amen now he's
[1:37:04] in prayer line look what he says it was
[1:37:05] like I got two more quotes three well
[1:37:08] four he said how do you do
[1:37:14] it wasn't that I didn't reach for your
[1:37:16] hand to shake your hand then when you
[1:37:17] put your hand out I was noticing
[1:37:18] something it was a shadow real dark and
[1:37:20] black that's the reason I know I caught
[1:37:22] your hand I'd find it that way see but
[1:37:24] it's a cancer rubber band was going to
[1:37:26] shake his hand with any stall like a
[1:37:27] shadow he said that's cancer you believe
[1:37:29] that God is able to move it it's on your
[1:37:31] breast left side we went to go back to
[1:37:33] Carolina and praise the Lord so he
[1:37:34] discerned him right there two things he
[1:37:36] told me from Carolina is he got cancer
[1:37:38] on your left breast
[1:37:41] he said praise the Lord for being well
[1:37:43] don't you see what I mean let's pray he
[1:37:45] said dear God the name is Jesus Christ
[1:37:47] the one who's president now the children
[1:37:49] eating the bread of God may this child
[1:37:52] also enjoy the faith the bread of God
[1:37:55] that gives him now for his healing may
[1:38:00] he go and be well in Jesus name
[1:38:02] god bless you brother believe with all
[1:38:03] your heart so as a brother who had a
[1:38:04] breast cancer
[1:38:06] a brother and brother man praise God
[1:38:11] give him the food of God that will heal
[1:38:13] him which we know is by His stripes we
[1:38:16] are healed he sent His Word and it
[1:38:19] healed them but see not only was he
[1:38:22] getting bread of God everybody the
[1:38:24] church was getting the bread of God that
[1:38:26] they have need of praise God isn't this
[1:38:31] a wonderful time just look like in all
[1:38:33] sets down over the people maybe it was
[1:38:35] my ears or something like that but BAM
[1:38:37] he blows the microphone I was listened
[1:38:38] to yes he goes hmm
[1:38:40] see he felt the wind of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:44] just make a noise like like that see
[1:38:47] it's the children's Red Sea it's yours
[1:38:49] it's for you it isn't for me it's for
[1:38:51] you I'm very thankful at the right time

[1:39:07] hearts up before God so encourages our
[1:39:10] hearts this is a
[1:39:14] exactly in season what he said he would
[1:39:17] do as it was in days of Sodom so she'll
[1:39:19] be in the coming and sent a man when a
[1:39:21] son of man will be revealed see and
[1:39:22] behold I send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:39:24] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:39:25] Lord he should restore the hearts of the
[1:39:27] people back to the father my brother
