[Music] to Let It Be My Lord let it be amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen God is good all the time uh before I get started I just wanted to thank you all I just wanted to greet you all uh from Brother Jim and all the brothers and sisters back uh East so far away but uh they all send their greetings and one that wanted would have liked to have said it he's here in person so and uh let's see if you would uh let's turn to Revelations chapter 18 said okay if we just talk about some things this morning uh just might might not be preaching like we're like you're used to but uh might be some readings some people don't like when people or when preachers read things they would much rather them flow with the with the Holy Spirit of the preaching and I like that too but some some things that I want to take out of the message as far as quotes uh that supports what I want to talk about this morning I might have spoken on this here before I can't remember uh but if I did my apologies if I didn't well praise the Lord but if it didn't bear repeating it shouldn't have been preached in the first place right so uh just kind of having a struggle uh yesterday this morning and uh I believe this is where the the Lord wants me to be to speak on this morning so uh you know how in the scripture that we're uh with the children of Israel that all the the land was being divvied out or the Lord said something about uh giving the uh each each tribe their portion but he if you notice the Levites did not have a portion of land uh they did not get the material part of it but uh and the Levites we know are the are the priests and uh so we're called to a royal priesthood as it says in in 1 Peter 2:9 that we're a holy nation a priesthood but the whole point of of of the Levites was that their portion was God he himself said I am your portion and that is good enough right so my grace is sufficient for thee so I think of the same thing in this hour that we are called to be a royal priesthood that our portion is God our portion is not the things of the world it's not the riches of the world uh it's not the wisdom of the world but it's all in the spiritual treasures and the blessings of the Lord amen amen so let's uh Revelation chapter 18 uh starting in the first verse Oh yall know by now that I'm nowhere near being perfect right so uh and I'm I'm depending solely on the holy spirit this morning uh that the Lord would be uh gracious enough uh uh to us this morning we're people of Second Chances but we've probably had hundreds if not thousands of Second Chances amen so just thankful for the god of Mercy this morning and every day every morning first first verse it says and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird so we see this is a a demonic uh at atmosphere or whatever it's been loosed for the the demons to be and uh we are in their presence they they're just and and that's what's around us but it's up to us to overcome those things so uh for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed uh fornication with her so and and the kings are are leaders so we we have the different you know the president of the United States the prime ministers things like that th those are the kings of of of the Nations and they've all part partaken with all these evil spirits uh the habitation of devils right so they they've they've partaken uh with her in that fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies so not just the kings of the nation but also the merchants those are your businesses you know uh things like uh uh I I can't even think of Tesla and uh Walmart and different things like that all these all these businesses these big corporations uh your 401 your your financial advisers and all these people have also taken uh part with that evil uh fornications with all of these with Babylon as it's talking about uh with the habitation of devils and the hold of uh every foul spirit so we see uh what's prevalent in this day is the wickedness uh there's corruption in in politicians there's corruption in business so you could see in the scripture how very much applies in this day of of of those that are trying to uh take control of society in this day so verse four it says and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that's us uh that you be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues he's saying come out of her my people we just talked about that we are the Lord's portion so we are his people so if you are his people then this applies to you come out of those things we're not to partake of those things for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much uh torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues uh come in one day death and mourning and in famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord who judgeth her for we know he is mighty mightier than the mightiest amen let's look to the Lord in prayer most gracious heavenly father I just want to thank you one more time for all the blessings that you give unto us we thank you for the privilege that we could stand here before your people to minister your word but father without you I am absolutely nothing but Lord we just call upon the name of Jesus Christ that you would come and that you would speak to your people through me oh God help me to get to step aside and uh just let your voice uh speak uh this morning and help us that uh the people would be blessed and uh that we could say truly it has been good to be in the house of the Lord this morning for Lord we love to come to worship we love to come sing songs onto you and uh Lord we love to hear your word so father we just pray that uh we could be uh a blessing because we have been blessed by so much Lord in Jesus Christ's name we do pray amen you may be seated uh this morning what I'd like to to speak on is uh demonology uh and recognizing Spirits uh see in verse three and now I don't have all Revelation I can't explain everything in here but uh those those things that the Lord gives me those that's what I'll speak on so verse three it says says for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies see it's her strength possibly her wealth her luxuries uh but if you notice the the stronghold that uh the rich have on people uh I guess you could say especially upon the poor people in this day and it just uh seems like it's uh oppressive uh the huge difference between the rich people and the poor people so uh just because of the amount of money that they have and the Mighty Dollar it makes many people crumble right so if some people have a an issue with gambling and they might come into some money and then they lose the money of course that gambling is a very terrible uh investment option uh because it can it can come you might be able to win some but you're going to lose some too you're going to lose big big uh so that's not a very sound investing advice is to go to casinos but it's it's definitely not a place for a Believer amen so talking about the the the strength of the rich uh but the uh the scripture tells us that it's it's not money that is evil but is the it's the love of money that is the root of all evil right so uh with money it also there also comes power so with that power uh uh character without power is satanic right but uh Power with character is fit to rule we we believe that we understand that so uh those that have power tend to uh don't have the The Godly character uh so they tend to run people over uh with their riches right and then they try to gain all that power and it's all uh through a demonic power because because they they just want control now if you had a believer in uh as the richest person in the world a True Believer they would try to uh share their money with people right at the same time to make uh the good Investments that they can continue to have their money to grow that they can continue to share you know so um that that's just how if if if you give all your money away and then you have no way to get get a return to give more money away than uh I mean it's it's a great sacrifice we read in the scripture about the woman that gave her last two mites right so uh you have that but if there's if there's a continual blessing then God has to be in it and and uh so with the money you make more money I don't know why I'm getting on money but uh but the understanding with the riches and the Treasures of the world that it uh that with that comes power and with that power comes pride and it invites all kinds of demonic spirits and and Devils right so uh it's it's like I was saying or like the scripture says it's the love of money that's the root of all evil because that that we call that greed right because you want more you want more so how much is a how much is enough to a rich person is is you know $100,000 enough or or today and by today's standards $100,000 doesn't constitute somebody being rich apparently so you have millionaires you have uh billionaires trillionaires you know how much is enough for these people but they continue they don't say well I've got three3 trillion doll and that's enough for me you know even a billionaire they're not going to say three billion dollars is enough for me but they continue to try to make more because they're trying to compete against the other guy that's the richest guy in the world so they're trying to make more so they're worth more than the other guy see and and that it's just a a competitive spirit and and and it's just like uh uh in in the scripture where the disciples were arguing f Ing and and uh just at one another because they were arguing well I'm the greatest no I'm the greatest and it's just that there's so much of that in this day I know brother Jesse's talked about it uh for him and I have talked about it so I'm pretty sure he's talked about it over the pulpit about uh the goat uh uh you know the greatest of all time and people are looking so much of of who's the greatest of all time I don't care what history of NFL player NBA player uh Major League baseball I don't care because Solomon was great but there's one greater than Solomon that is here amen see there's none greater than the Lord Jesus Christ so that's the one that I want to look to that's who I want to be my example amen so it it's just a rat race of somebody trying to be better than the other instead of trying to serve the other you know the Lord Jesus told us that if if the one that's greatest among you him shall be your servant not to not to exercise Dominion uh the scripture also teaches us to be not many Masters right uh to not have control over people but in treat one another as brother and sister you know having love for one another not treating somebody as a slave not treating somebody uh be con being condescending to somebody or patronizing you know looking down your nose at somebody and saying I'm greater than that person you know each one of us has our strengths our weaknesses we could look at somebody and say man I'm I'm glad I'm not going through that but the Lord has put something in their life that trust he trusted them to go through whatever situation you know the same thing with us whenever we go through a trial he's entrusting us to overcome right so it is to show forth Jesus Christ not to show that we have any power for we don't have any power right but we have the authority through the spoken word of Jesus Christ he said if you'll ask anything in my name amen so uh that's where it's it's not a competitive thing but it's a it's a love thing it's it's not a race of of who's going to be greatest of all we're not worried about who the greatest of all is except one amen so uh then it becomes it becomes a prideful thing this whole Rat Race thing and and through the whole race it takes people further and further away from God and we don't want that right because our heart is to draw closer unto God Amen so in in verse four uh it it's just saying and I heard another voice see there are many voices in this in this day but we got to focus on one voice voice we are sheep we are listening to the voice of Our Shepherd right so and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues see if you partake of what she's doing you're partaking of her plagues right uh you're going to partake of her sins so if you were following after that influence that's going to lead you down to the path of the right wide right or wide left right so but we want want to say straight on so I know this is not the greatest of subjects that people like to talk about but uh I I don't like talking about it myself uh but this is it's what I was called out of uh but I think we take it too lightly when we talk about Witchcraft and we talk about demons uh that it's just a POS thing but look what's out there you have your Harry Potter uh you have all these different things that uh are lifted up if if you would and uh even even Christians are saying oh I love Harry Potter you should you should despise Harry Potter because it it it it tries to uh what's the word I want to try to say disseminate is is the word that comes to my mind I'm not sure if that's the right it it tries to undermine what the Lord is and everything that the Lord has done and we know that's that's what the adversary does is he he takes everything that the Lord made and he perverts it right he makes it uh look at Harry Potter of how cool it looks right they they try to make it look look so great and look so cool that all the kids flock to it and that's and that's what it is see brother brandom said sin is beautiful right sin is a pretty thing but that's not what what we want to look look at right we want to look at the outcome of of uh an influence right and we want it to be a positive thing you know uh how many believes that demons are real beings you know so it it it's it's a real it's not a it's not a mythological thing or some uh something that uh parents talk to their kids at at night to try to scare them to go to sleep you know it's it's not anything like that or isn't that a terrible thing if our parents try to uh some parents not all parents they try to scare their children uh in in some respects we should teach them uh respect but using things like demons and and uh you know evil things to try to scare them into obedience that shouldn't be right because we should teach in everything let it be done in love right with the admonition and the nurture of the Lord so this is not something that's outdated or oldfashioned as some people like to to portray it uh but evil spirits are everywhere and in everything everything that we do see we're stuck in this carnality right so we're we're stuck in this flesh so it's a constant battle we every we go to the store we go to work we go to school uh wherever we're going just down the street whatever it is there are spirits that we're battling there are spirits that we're entertaining there are spirits that we're we're trying to Cast Away right so we're trying to cast evil away so we know that Spirits can be in animals right because we know that Jes Jesus cast uh the the evil spirits into the swine and they and they ran into the water and perished right uh but you also have God as a spirit when he when uh when balam was having a hard time with the donkey because he was out of the will of the Lord and then the the angel of the Lord was in the way of the donkey and Bam balum was whooping his donkey and then uh the the donkey tried to go somewhere else and just everywhere he tried to go the angel of the Lord was in the way and just beating him and beating him balum was beating his donkey because he was disobedient but the lord gave him power to open his mouth to speak what have I done to you balam have and you know I'm not like this I've always I've always been obedient I've always taken you places where you wanted wanted me to go but then you see the Lord opened up this the donkey's mouth to give a rebuke unto baam boy wouldn't that be something to being rebuked by your dog or your kitty cat you know but we ought to be able to discern between good and evil be far from us that it would be so low that our dog or our cat would have to rebuke us because we can't see the spiritual realm but like I said demons are real and this is a quote that brother brand talks about he says friends they are just as real as you are real and I see them many times when they leave right from this platform here I see them some of them in the shape of bats they look look like long hairs hanging on their legs leg but an epileptic demon looks like a tortoise with round legs hanging up like that however he's doing it um but usually a demon of Oppression seems to be more of a cloud form like a wave and it just makes a real funny sound when you're in that other dimension to see the spirit see we aren't able to see the spirits like brother Brandon was there are some people that could see spirits but not everyone uh and be careful what you ask ask for cuz you just might get it but I don't I'm not sure if I want to see the the spirit cuz it probably give me a heart attack it' probably scare me but he says now you may think that's wrong but some of these days you'll realize if you can only take a spiritual Looking Glass and look into your soul you doubt and you find find out what it looks like and the greatest devil you hearing the greatest devil and the chief of all Devils is UN belief he says that's the only sin there is there's no other sin but unbelief all these little morals and things smoking drinking gambling and committing adultery that's just attributes you do that because you don't believe unbelief is what makes you do that if you was a Believer you wouldn't do that right he says now it's uh it's just like I think the gifts of the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is not the Holy Ghost it is a gift but it's not the gifts right so the gifts of the holy spirit is not the Holy Ghost it's the attributes of the Holy Ghost see Gifts of healing speaking in tongues and all those other things are attributes of having the holy spirit it's a fruit that the tree Bears see the trees the main thing we're looking at the tree we're not focused on the branches but the main Life Source is in the tree and then the life extends unto the branches amen no wonder Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches because he is the lifegiving source and the Holy Spirit is God and God is love now I'm speaking directly to Christians so that you could see the pro and con the negative and the positive where there's anybody asked you then you can give them an answer uh now of everything that God has the devil has a counterfeit we know that right you go and whatever you want to do uh you you find these old uh dances that's of the devil but he says but God has a holy dance for the people see from that Holy dance the adversary perverted it to an ungodly dance a a a dance of perversion a a a dance of uh provocative uh influence I guess you could say and that's not what we want but if we dance we dance in the Holy Spirit a Godly dance amen so he says but God has a holy dance for the people the Bible said so and and brother Brandon says this I was one of the greatest Critics on that you ever seen till God told me just what to do I find out that Miriam danced in the spirit David danced when he had Victory all of it was through victory see through victory we dance through victory we worship through victory we give praise am amen it was dancing holy dancing for instance in the Bible if a dreamer dreamed a dream or a prophet prophesied they had a plate called the UR that went over the breast of Aaron and when they went before this plate and spoke in them lights flashed on the plate God would sanction it that it was the truth is that right if it didn't speak on there then it was wrong now look the the devil come around in a pattern of that took a crystal ball see everything that God has everything in the natural types the spiritual and he says I know I'm a typologist and I believe that every natural thing types the spiritual don't you and it goes right over the audience and almighty God excuse me it goes right over the audience and almighty God who we're preaching about and surely to be in the deepest of sincerity I seen those things move over the audience and I've seen them sometimes when the congregation will be just in one Accord in one Accord right uh that they'd see that thing themselves many times hundreds and hundreds of people would see it move see when we're in one mind one Accord when we get caught up into the spiritual realm we get to see things spiritually the Lord will open our eyes just like a ha ey right and he says uh and therefore must take the very deepest of sincerity it isn't a bluff you can't Bluff the devil at all he won't Bluff but whenever you really can produce the blood of Jesus Christ Satan can't stand before that now that is just true I see but when you when you really can't produce the blood of Jesus Christ Satan can't stand before that and that's where we rest amen for Jesus Christ is our rest we rest in that blood that was shed for us you know brother Jim was preaching here uh this this was last year when I think last year when I preached this and I just had a little side note in here and I was set to preach that evening and I had this thought on my mind and uh I was I was probably not the right thing to do but sometimes that's that's what happens you're thinking about you know if you're going to be preaching in the evening you're kind of thinking about what you're going to be preaching on even when somebody else is preaching but how terrible is that right you're supposed to be focused but uh you know something just sparked the thought in my mind and I was thinking about rules and uh you know we we have people amongst us I'm not saying here in church but people uh through this world they just don't like rules okay uh they don't want to comply they don't want to be obedient to they they don't want to be subject to something else having control over them all right so but scripture teaches us that Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft Rebellion is as witchcraft how many how many wants to rebel I don't want to be rebellious because I don't want to go back to witch witchcraft from where I was called from so uh everybody like games you're in the front row so I guess I'll be picking on you you ready to play a game okay it's your move go ahead okay so I don't know you tell me what what are we playing I'm in control of this but you tell me what the rules are you don't know what the rules are right you got to know what the rules are to be able to play the game you see so people want to do these things they they want to do what they want but they still fall under rules you want to live as an American citizen you got to follow under rules if you want to live down in Mexico you got rules to follow whether it's the government or the cartel one or the other but you're going to have rules to follow you go to Italy you're going to have to follow rules I don't like this country I got to get out of here because I don't like the rules what's stopping you but if you try to go to another country you have to fill out all the proper paperwork you have to go through all the the the red tape that you got to go through here so it's the same thing everywhere we go there's a set of rules we fall under law right so we are governed by something but what is it that we let govern us but see you might not like or want rules but that's what we're governed by between good and evil demon demons know the rules of engagement they know that they could go so far before that line is drawn and the Lord tells him uhh you can't touch my people amen just like job Satan was saying oh if it wasn't for all these riches and you spoil him if if you took everything away he would leave you right but we know that that the Lord used job even though he took his children took his cattle took his money pretty much stripped him of everything that he had but he never cursed God amen he stayed true he kept the faith amen so no matter what adversity we go through that doesn't mean that the Lord has left us the Lord is still there amen but see even the demons knew the Rules of Engagement see when uh when when Jesus would go about and he would uh go about for the healings or the teaching to the people you would notice when you read through the evil spirits would come come up and say hey this here is the Christ the son of God and what did he tell him be quiet now is not my time it'll be my time soon enough see they was trying to ruin his plan trying to trying to ruin God's plan trying to expose things early but he still had power over those Spirits so all men are influenced by one side or the other so you have God's side Heaven which is the you know the third heaven 2 Corinthians 12:12 it talks us about the third heaven so it's beyond the solar system then you have Angelic beings which is the second heaven which is the solar system okay Christ which is the Holy Spirit the influence of of the believer going upward first Heaven that is the clouds in the Earthly atmosphere then you have Satan's side spirits of the Dead the Wicked unregenerated Man and then you have demons and then you have hell so you have Heaven and Hell and you have everything in between which is a constant battle between one another everybody okay this morning so brother brand says this I I told you I had some things to to read so bear with me uh he says now let me just show you a simple thing friend now the first thing that if if the two Spirits Jesus said in the last days course some Demon Spirits is arising sure they are we we we see it we see the may be uh becoming more and more wicked and and then each day we wake up man how much more wicked be careful what you ask for how much more wicked is this going to get before we get called home I don't want to see more wickedness but we know that it's going to come it's a vexation of our spirit it's a vexation of our soul because we long to be somewhere else because we are of another Spirit he says of course some Demon Spirits is arising sure they are they've always been here uh they will be until Jesus comes and they live right in people and people don't know it and see that's the issue is people don't recognize the spirit that they are under they can't recognize when that demon Spirit comes in and then they're Bound by that Spirit and the person can't recognize it and that's where they're and then they're a servant to that demonic spirit and then they do things that they don't want to do because they are a servant to this thing that demon that now has control over them and then all of a sudden they start cussing or they might start smoking or they might start doing something else and it's not in them to do that because they've been changed from an unbeliever to a Believer but yet somehow they get caught under a demon spirit and then they do things that they don't want to do that something that that uh uh when they when they finally come to the realization hey I'm under this demonic Force why am I doing these things I don't want to do that that's not my heart see the Lord knows what's on your heart amen see he says uh they've always been here they will be until Jesus comes and they live right in people and people don't know it they give them unclean habits and sicknesses and diseases and all kinds everything everything is caused by a spirit everything that we do is influenced by an evil spirit or a godly Spirit everything is caused by a spirit deafness is a spirit did you know that the doctor says that the nerves went dead but what made it go dead what made it go dead the Bible said when the deaf Spirit come out of the man he could hear is that right so it's a spirit a cancer is a spirit a tumor is a spirit all those things epilepsy is a spirit Jesus rebuked the devil the boy with epilepsy and he fell on the ground and had the hardest fit he ever had but when he got over that one he was finished with it amen glory see a lot of them said well he didn't get healed look at him he's got the worst spell he ever had but that was all of them see that was all the rest of them that he was ever going to have and that's why it was the worst one that he had it was all of them accumulative being CAU up out of him it's got to get worse before it gets better amen see it's a spirit amen he says notice now the woman if I gave you uh gave any of you men here tonight a dollar bill and would say uh or excuse me he says if I give you this envelope and I'd say is that a dollar bill why you'd say certainly not the devil's too smart for that but Jesus said the two Spirits be so close together deceive the elect if it were possible then if I give you a dollar bill it would have to look uh uh uh it would have to look a whole lot like a real genuine dollar or you'd recognize it right now is that right that's how the Devil comes around friends it ain't a communistic spirit it's an antichrist but but that ain't the Antichrist that Jesus spoke of it's an antichrist Spirit but it is not the Antichrist where we know anything not like God is anti-god anything that comes against God is anti-god so the Antichrist spirit is so religious Cain as I've been telling you about was just just as religious as Abel was and those things come right down and they are brothers right so Esau and Jacob everything uh Judas and Jesus some people only see three crosses on golgatha but he says there were four there was Jesus and the one Thief uh uh the one thief on the right the one thief on the left and uh we know the scripture says curses cursed is he that hangeth on a tree and Judas hung himself on a sycamore tree is that right he was on just as much AC cross as Jesus was on a tree he says now there was the son of God come from Heaven returning back to Heaven taking with him the repentant sinner okay Jesus came got the repentant sinner now he's saying there was the son of predition from Hell Come From Hell returning back to hell and he's taking back The unrepented Sinner see if thou be the question mark on God's word if thou be the Son of God but he says but this other one never tried to figure it out he said Lord remember me when thou comest in see the difference between the two thieves on the cross one one is saying well he's a sinner just like us and the other one is saying Lord forgive me for being a sinner one was mocking one was ridiculing but one was asking for mercy so we doing okay uh probably not too much longer so Deuteronomy chapter 18 starting in the ninth verse it says when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee Thou shalt not learn to do after the Abominations of those Nations don't partake of their ways verse 10 it says there shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire which is the the sacrifice that they would do or that useth divination which is witchcraft or an observer of times that's a sorcerer or magician or a soothsayer or an enchanter which is an observer of signs or a wick witch which is sorcery or charmer which they submit others by spells or incantations trickery or deception see these are the spirits that we contend with out there and he's saying be not partakers with them amen so or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard a which is a conjurer or a necromancer a necromancer one who vokes the dead a Ghost spirit of a dead one y'all familiar with the term necromancing necromancing is communication with the dead necro means death if you're trying to summon or inquire of a dead person that is necromancing brother Brandon said that Cath Catholicism is spiritualism and and this is why because it's a communication with dead people see they pray to dead Saints right they ask help help from dead Saints St Christopher St Jude all these different Saints they call for help and each Saint will protect them from certain things or uh one might be a financial Saint you know you pray unto that hey I need more money bless me you know I need protection St I can't remember who which one it is I I don't know it could be St Christopher for all I know but they call upon these Saints they are praying to these Saints instead of calling up calling out to God their prayers are to a human form that has done gone on wherever their destination is that is the spiritualism and that's what brother brandom was talking about and that's what he preached against he said you're so far into spiritualism which is necromancing because you're trying to communicate with the dead but we have one mediator one mediator between man and God and that is the Lord Jesus Christ amen it not s it's not some Saint Nick or anything like that y'all but see in in doing this it's an Abomination unto the Lord oh my oh my verse 12 it says for all that do these things are an Abomination unto unto the Lord and because of these Abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee verse 13 it says Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God for these nations which Thou shalt possess hearken unto Observer observers of times and unto uh divers but as for thee the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee to do so or so to do God didn't ordain us to communicate with them or we would have been a witch or we would have been a sorcerer but we are a child of God and we don't get into these evil things we don't get into tarot cards we don't get into Ouija boards we we don't get into seances but our communication is with our Lord amen see these these demons out there are trying to get us to try to sift us as wheat to try to get us out of the relationship with our Lord and savior I think this is the last quote he says brother I tell you sometimes we need to be skinned down and rubbed a little bit to see where we're standing don't you think so make right right now I'm not condemning the Catholic saints but look the reason that the witch of Endor could call the spirit of Samuel because Samuel couldn't go into the presence of God and that's what happens with people is when they feel that they can't get into the presence of God anymore they're going to go seek something else something else that they can get under the influence of see I'm not condemning Catholic saints but look the reason that the witch of Endor could call the spirit of Samuel because Samuel couldn't go into the presence of God he was in Paradise for the blood of bulls and goats would not take away sin but since Jesus died he divorced sin and taken away sin and the believer now goes into the presence of God Amen and he can't come back Jesus said in Luke when he was talking about the rich man he can't return once you're there you're there that is your destination and he can't come back Jesus said in Luke when he was talking about the rich man he can't return so if you're interceding with any kind of a spirit of someone that's gone on outside of God Christ the only mediator between God and man then you are in spiritualism called religion now where is spiritualism at so be careful what you say about the spirit of God because we know people would talk about they they would mock the spirit of God when there were healings going on when discernment was going on people were mocking those things saying saying that brother Brandon was in spiritualism but what is spiritualism it's communicating with the dead but brother Brandon was communicating with our Lord who is not dead but is risen amen and is alive forever more oh my but there's one thing that I've always thought about that God by the power of his death at Calvary has given to the church power to cast out evil spirits amen because Mark 16 said in my name they shall cast out not I will but they will in my name they shall cast out Devils which is you he's given you power to cast out those Devils he says in my name they shall cast out Devils is that right if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover amen and in Matthew 8:1 16 it says when the even was was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with what his word oh my how powerful the word is but and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick this is the power that he's given us amen now you might say that I oh I believe in the spoken word everybody believes in the spoken word right the scripture tells us that uh that we receive not because we ask not or because we ask but we ask a Miss we don't know what we're asking for we're just asking we're we're just kind of going through the motions you know well I want this power but what do you want the power for what do you want the power of the spoken word for so you could be like balum and try to curse God's people but he couldn't do it the Lord wouldn't let him right because he was bound as a prophet he can only the word comes to the prophet the word of he couldn't speak anything but the word of the Lord when the Lord said speak to the people this he couldn't say anything but that so we should be so close to God that we can't say anything but what the Lord has spoken amen so what is the reason people like the the spoken word for well there's so much power in the spoken word what's the reason why people want to be able to use the spoken word is it that they could have the power to say well look at me like King Nebuchadnezzar look at the Kingdom that I built up look at the people look at the congregation that I built up all these people follow me because I had the power of the spoken word see it's people trying to bring attention to themselves and not bringing it to the Lord Jesus amen but what is the purpose people want the spoken word see Power without character is Satan but with power with character is fit the rule see when we if we have the right character that's that that's why brother Brandon was able to do certain things because he had the right character the Lord entrusted him because he had the right character now if uh what was it the disciples if now we have to be careful if we had that power are we going to be like uh the disciples when when the prophet called fire you know from Heaven under those that kept knocking on the door I think that was with King aiah and uh because he sought another God other than the god of Israel he sought another entity he he sought out a different deity now these disciples were saying the same thing Lord should we call fire from heaven because they had something uh people were doing something that they didn't like well should we just annihilate them he says you don't even know what Spirit you're of you're wanting to call fire from heaven and I didn't come to destroy the law I didn't come to destroy people I came to save save and redeem my people amen so we have to be careful what we're trying to do with the spoken word is it going to be self-fulfilling or is it going to be a benefit to others because we know eternal life is serving others right so just a few more minutes uh Acts chapter 5 and verse 15 I hope this is helping somebody this morning it says in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of pet Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone amen see if we meet the same conditions that that they met back back then then the same thing can apply to us it's not something that's some far off distance that that we can't reach it's if we're believer this is one of our tools amen this is one of our weapons amen see in verse 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison now why did do they do that because evil can't stand good right evil can't stand how prosperous good can be because it why do people get so upset that people read the Bible or live a Godly life it's because it's the same reason Cain and Abel Cain couldn't stand Abel because Abel was more righteous than Cain amen but Abel probably didn't go around and said bragging about it hey I'm more righteous than you nny nanny boo boo you know I'm better than you it wasn't that I don't think he had that kind of a spirit because that's not an attribute of the holy spirit amen so and we we know that Abel was a Son of God so he would carry the same attributes as God I I believe amen so uh and we have that so much in this day that the good is going or yeah the The Good the evil is going to come against good and no matter what we do because we know that Spirits are everywhere Spirits are in everything that we do we encounter Spirits in everything that we do you could even be at home you could be listening to a message and there's going to be a spirit that's going to try to come in a spirit of Doubt spirit of fear whatever it might be but don't you let it in don't you let that in you see we entertain Spirits excuse me yeah we entertain Spirits we entertain angels unaware now see isn't that something we enter entertain enter it means to come in right so you are allowing something to come in entertain we instead of practicing or getting involved in entertainment we need to start practicing exertainment getting these spirits that don't belong get them out amen amen so we got to be careful what we're entertaining uh musicians come see it's when we spend uh the time with those those that are in the world uh or those that are not of of such good character these things Vex our souls and our Spirits amen see if we're not careful that influence you can stand to your feet with me this morning if we're not careful we will begin to act like them if you get yourself into that presence under that influence all the time and you know that you should be in that atmosphere and you constantly get into it eventually it's going to get you well I'm going to talk to so and so and I'm going to try to witness them to them I'm going to try to talk to them you better be prayed up before you go if you that's why we should be you know pray without ceasing that's why we should be praying before we go do anything going to talk to somebody going to our our place of of work or wherever it is we should be in prayer because of the spirits that we encounter we need to be careful of the influence that tries to bring us down remember in the Scripture it teaches us that evil Communications which it which is companionship it corrupts good manners which is our character so let's bow our heads the scripture Hebrews 1301 it says let brotherly Brotherly Love continue and be not forget to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares most gracious Heavenly Father Giver of every good gift lover of our soul we just love you we appreciate you we just thank you for the time that we've had this had here this morning Father I just pray that you would help us uh we're not the most spiritual people in in the world we're not trying to brag we're not trying to uh be prideful um but Lord I just just pray that you would help us that we would recognize the spirits that we encounter and when we recognize those Spirits uh help us to discern uh which Spirits we should be entertaining and those that we should be casting away father we know that your scripture says try every Spirit to see if they are of God or not Lord I just pray that when we do such that uh no evil uh spirit would overtake us that would influence us to to take us away from you but Lord I just pray that that uh you would give each one here this morning in in presence those that are streaming uh just pray that you would uh give each one of us the the strength and help us to be spiritually strong enough to recognize what Spirit we are of and what spirits that we encounter but father uh just pray that uh you would help us as we uh walk through uh this life day by day that uh our discernment would be exercised and exercised well uh that we wouldn't be carried about by every wind of Doctrine but we would stay steadfast upon Thy word and thy word is truth father we just pray as we depart from here that we would never depart from your presence for you yourself even said that you would not leave us nor forsake us and Lord we're counting on that that you would be with us so whenever we encounter danger whenever we encounter uh some influence that we shouldn't be under Lord we look unto you and we're depending on you to keep us safe from those things keep us from harm Lord be it far from us that we would uh get into things such as witchcraft or sorcery or anything that has an attribute to it Lord God I just pray that you would cleanse us and keep us pure from all those things that we could uh stand before you as pure uh uh unadulterated uh children of God or as we could say as your bride that we would be without spot without wrinkle and uh Lord we just pray that you would give this body strength uh that they would overcome continue to grant them Liberty uh day by day oh God we ask it into your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I know it seems a little weird this morning I I told brother Jesse I I just kind of have a strange feel I wasn't going to tell you this but here I'm telling you now anyhow uh just kind of had a strange feeling on my way here this morning and uh I pray that it wasn't me uh and I pray that it's not you but uh I don't know I can't really explain it but uh and that's kind of why I went this way this morning I don't know I don't know what's in store for you I don't have that discernment I don't have that I don't have that Vision but all I can say is if anybody if there's any sick among you let them call the Elders of the church and uh brother brandham also said you know if if you're going through that situation you can put it to any situation that if you're sick then you give yourself you have a vision of a well person and you step into that well you might saywell I'm not spiritual enough to have visions that's not what he's talking about he's saying what you desire you have a picture of what you're of what you desire the condition that you want to be in and you focus on that condition and you step into that amen so I I don't know what's going on if anything it could have been just on the way here I don't know so the Lord be with you all the Lord bless you but we're going to sing songs of praise this morning y'all okay in worship let's let's Worship the Lord a little bit you've heard me talk enough so [Music] amen things
