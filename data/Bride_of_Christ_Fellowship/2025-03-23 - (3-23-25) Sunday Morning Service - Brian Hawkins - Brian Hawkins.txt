========================================

and uh just that's what we want to do is is is we are aiming for the higher ground and and being in his presence is the higher ground so we want to be in his presence that's something that we should be looking for is the influence of the Holy Spirit uh every day day in day out amen so if you would turn with me to Isaiah in the sixth chapter and and sorry that my family has to hear it again but uh it seems like no matter how many times you you could preach the same thing it it doesn't come out the same way but uh we're just grateful to the Lord that he's kept us he gave us safe travels today and he's he's always faithful to see us through whatever we're going through Isaiah chapter 6 starting in the first verse somebody give the Lord Praise Your Name Lord so he says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple as Angels following that his train filled the temple above above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly so if you see where he covered his face and his feet it's showing humility so if if they do that how much more should we come in humility and with Twain he did fly so the the six wings I'm not going to speak on anything uh extremely mysterious uh today but uh and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full full of his glory so even they are coming with Worship in their mouths they are coming with praise in their mouths verse four he says and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips how many here would say the same thing I am a man of or woman of unclean lips but I really like this and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips so not only himself but the people that he resided with so they were of people of of of like passions people of like mistakes so he says for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts but it's something about him seeing that King being in the presence of the king and he says uh so when you get into that presence you know you can't you can't lie to the Holy Spirit you can't uh uh uh try to scam you can't do any of those things but in the presence if you truly get in the presence of the Lord you can't help but confess things you can't help but confess uh and we that's way we want to be is we want to be true we want to have that heart that's that is honest and that is pure right so then he says then said I woe is me for I am undone why because he got in the presence of the Lord amen because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell uh in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which a live coal is fire fire is a cleansing element amen and it'll burn those things out of us so having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged amen how many want to be in that condition this morning and not just this morning but every morning every morning his mercies are new and every morning morning we should have a praise coming off of our lips amen verse 8 he says also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and whom will go for us so he's asking a question who is willing who is willing to take this stand who is willing to come forth to have your mouth touched with the hot Cal to have your mouth your lips touched that's to have pure words coming out of your mouth no longer having unclean speech no longer saying evil things of some someone else no longer speaking negative confessions but he says whom shall I send and who will go for us I was talking to brother Malachi in the back here about you know sometimes I I still struggle I don't know why but Lord why have you chosen me surely there are men more qualified than myself and I was tell talking to somebody about this a little bit ago and then I can't remember if it was David but uh it was somebody who posed a question yeah but are they willing you know there are many people that are called but few are chosen and probably how many how much less are even willing amen that's right but I love Isaiah says here then said I here am I send me how many has that heart this morning Lord I want to do a work for you amen so it's not our work that we want to do but we want to go and fulfill his work let's bow our heads this morning Heavenly Father we just thank you out of the millions of people millions and billions of people on this Earth you have chosen us that we can come and Lord what a privilege it is to be able to speak the name of Jesus from our lips what a privilege it is to come into the house of the Lord to come and worship the one and true God father I just thank you so much for for what you've laid upon us that you've set before us and every provision uh that we have needed that you have met father Lord we thank you so much for your scripture that you've given unto us we thank you for opening our eyes Lord we might not understand all Mysteries we might not uh be a theologian but we want to thank you so much for what we do see we want to thank you for what we do understand for what it it might be a small amount of Revelation but Lord I want to take this time to thank you for that small bit of Revelation because there are so many people out in this world that cannot see truth and Lord what a privileged people we are to be able to stand in your presence and to be able to give praise off of our lips amen Lord we just thank you so much oh Lord be with us help us and guide us as we Minister your word may it be a blessing unto the people and may I get out of the way to let your spirit Speak Lord we don't want to depend on notes but Lord we want to depend on on your spirit coming and speaking with us this morning that we could all say that it surely was good to be in the house house of the Lord for Lord we want refreshment we want that renewing of your Holy Spirit to be upon us Lord we ask all these things all all your favors to be upon us oh God Lord we pray that you would be with brother Jesse as he's ministering out and about to to people they might be in another place but lord they're still part of the part of the body oh God we just pray that you would give them that influence that Godly influence to speak to them and to bring truth to them to lead them into truth and Lord we pray that you would be with brother Ronnie long also as he's ministering back at the home church and uh be with the our brothers and sisters there Lord we ask that you would be with the whole body around the whole world father Lord we ask that we would be led of your spirit in Jesus Christ's name we do ask it father amen and amen you may be seated I think any more I'm just finding finding a place of home I guess so I'm just going to make myself comfortable as if I'm at home so no so if if you've read the message and I'm and I'm I'm not going to try to be the type of person that's brother brandom this brother brandom that and uh I I try not to do that because it it it tends to wear out the the whole name of of brother brandham and and it just has the appeal to to those on the outside that we just look to a man and follow a cult but I think a lot of people don't understand the meaning of cult and its original meaning which uh before was not it did not had have a negative connotation to it but it had a positive it was just it it was a name of what they called a religious gathering but now they have put a negative connotation to it that it's it's an extreme follower of one person or thought or idea and that's what they label people as a cult but you know in in times past uh centuries ago it it was just a term for people that got together and was uh uh labeled I guess you could say as a religious group but if you think about it uh one that came from witchcraft when when people say cult my mind goes to the uh a group of wicked people GP a group of wicens getting together and that to me is cultish so when people refer to us as a cult uh it doesn't really hurt my feelings because I just feel that they don't know what they're talking about because something that they don't understand is what they call something negative you know so it uh we don't want to do that we want to speak nice things of people no matter how much they they might say uh evil things about us right so and what is is that is that us is that our nature no that is the holy spirit within that gives us that self-control to maintain our tongue and to say nice things brother brandom said you know when people were drawing him out what did he say I'm just going to draw the circle bigger and draw you back in so you know we we are members of one body there is one Lord one baptism right so there is one faith and that's where we want to come in unity right to come under that one Lord not under a a man the umbrella of a man I uh I was just preaching at at at home I uh last last week I I preached on the the topic and and it's a a profound question you know it was something so mysterious not really to uh but it was just a question are you a Christian and and that's uh maybe I should preach that this morning but but I I feel led to go another way I I pray that it's on On Target on goal but brother brandham used uh this scripture in Isaiah chapter 6 in the messages of influence so uh we have and and then he goes on to talk about how Uzziah was raised in a home of Godly Parents and that was a influence from the time he was born and the and the time that he was raised is that he was under a Godly influence so uh and then he went on to relate everything to uh like bad things of how kidss act uh young people how they act and he uh uh uh attributes that to juvenile delinquency and then he goes on to say I would say it's more parental delinquency because they're not putting that influence there to their children when they first get it because what does the scripture say treat or raise up a child and the way he should go and when he is older he shall not depart from it right so we want to establish that influence from a very young age so uh what I'd like to speak on this morning is influence so but there's a Twist to this influence is destruction by false witness but see uh when he goes on to say that it's juvenile delinquency parental uh delinquency I think it's more of a character deficiency right so uh we want a good influence in our lives right that that's what we want is that something that we always get no because we have a a like he was talking about Uzziah being raised up having Godly Parents that's an ideal situation but it's not always the case you know I I I was baptized Catholic don't you know don't don't don't judge me on anything I was baptized Catholic my parents bust me off to a Baptist Sunday school okay and then when I grew up I went to the United Methodist Church so you know just because I went to church did not mean that I had an experience with the Lord that's right and even as I uh uh as a young teenager I held a a a spot uh I don't know how I don't know why it was probably by default because nobody else wanted to do it but a leader in the in the youth group and I still did evil in the sight of the Lord on so just because you go to church doesn't make you a Christian You go Okay so I'm probably going to combine a couple couple messages here but you know we'll just let the Lord lead as as as as I want to follow the lord as he leads amen so what is influence influence is the power or capacity of causing an effect and indirect so it could be something that you're around indirectly subconsciously hearing commercials subconsciously hearing things on the radio eavesdropping not meaning to uh hearing other people's conversations so that's indirectly okay so the power capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways meaning to sway people you ever come across somebody uh we were just talking about this Bible study you ever come across somebody they are so nice they are so respectful that it just demands a respect they don't say hey you need to respect me but just the way that they carry themselves the way that they treat you you just feel that you can't do anything but give them respect right so then in that kind of a way that is an indirect influence they can sway you in a good way or a bad way because there are some individuals out there that could do the very opposite they can have an influence negatively and you don't even realize that they're influencing you in that negative fashion right so it could be a a a a negative word here a negative word there and then it and then all of a sudden you wonder you get home and you wonder why you're doubting yourself you get home and you wonder why you're doubting the word am I even a Christian do I even have the Holy Spirit it's because you're you're with something you're in the midst you're in the atmosphere of some kind of an indirect influence and so much more of how we need to be prayed up you know Ephesians 6 uh I was thinking of of of of of brother amen this morning he's not here but uh and I don't know why I wasn't going to say that out loud but Lord Lord be with brother amen but uh I wish he was here because I wanted to talk to him but uh so having the E Ephesians 6 talks about taking on the whole armor of God and why what was the purpose of taking on that armor to withstand the Ws of the devil what are WS WS are tricks indirect influence okay some of it is is forceful some of it's going to come directly right at you so we we need to be prepared for those things another part of influence the act or power of producing an effect without apparent exertion of force or direct exercise of command a corrupt interference with authority for personal gain so some people will use influence because they have the spirit of malice and they are trying to direct you and influence you to the way of their thinking amen so we we also know this as a little leaven leth the whole L right so that that's pretty much influence in a nutshell and we can we can agree and understand with that right so uh what when does a change take place in a person's life if you read through the scripture they heard the word right this is a process of faith we have to hear the word you have to receive it so one you have to hear it two you have to receive it amen and then you just leave it dormant you just leave it lay there but you must act upon it so the same way with influence we hear the influence but do we receive that influence and how do we react and respond to that influence right so what a what a bad influence can do is Proverbs chapter 25: 18 it says a man that beareth false witness against his neighbor is a Maul and a sword and a sharp arrow all of these are instruments of war all of these are instruments of killing people okay so we understand that if you kill a man's influence that you could kill a man right there and be just as guilty as if you don't pick up a weapon and Pierce them through right so these are weapons so he's saying a man that beareth false witness against his neighbor and why do people bear false witness for an influence or self gain it's selfishness is what it is bearing false witness because out of Envy just like Cain of how he slew his brother Abel he was envious right and that's where a lot of this stuff is rooted right is because somebody else gained something that they didn't so then now they have to like use a mul and chop them down by whatever means necessary they have to use a sword to cut their influence down they have to use an arrow to pierce through the heart to take them out wow that is the that is the danger and the power of false false witness bearing false witness right bear false accusation is bearing false witness can we agree with that so uh uh uh uh so if we look at Ephesians 5 CH uh uh Chapter 5 Verse 6 and and and seven this is a way to avoid that right so when we see a problem we have to see a way out we can't just we can't just be there and say hey this is a problem this is a problem this is a problem okay we we say that we have a problem but what's the way out and it just leaves people okay there's a problem what next so Ephesians chapter 5 verse 6 and 7 he says let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience why because it's very it's a very separation God hates the the the the uh uh uh division amongst Brethren amen right it's one of the one of the six things one of the seven things that that the Lord does hate is setting division not not necessarily separating from unbelief you you understand the difference but causing a separation causing division amongst Brethren that's what he hates so uh and that's why his wrath wrath comes upon the children of Disobedience so he says be not ye therefore partakers with them so just shun the very appearance of evil step away from those things you could see that spirit is there light can't fellowship with Darkness so when you see that Darkness you got to step away from that right even if it means that you're going to lose a friend right right amen so we must put ourselves in the good good influence First Peter chapter 2 I'm just going to go through some scriptures here if if if that's all right so which I know I'm I'm home so I know it's okay right y'all love me I love y'all I appreciate y'all so 1 Peter chapter 2: 11 it says dearly beloved I beseech you a strangers and pilgrims abstained from fleshly lust which war against the soul the fleshly lust it's going to war against your soul because this the flesh wants to give into these things be because it's pleasure it's a moment of pleasure if I give into this I'll be satisfied but rest assur that satisfac action is for a moment that's right amen sorry I'm not pointing at at just you I'm just pointing but verse 12 he says having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers why because you're doing good but they speak against you as evildoers that they that uh uh they may by your good works which they Shall Behold because we have written Epistles read of all men they're going to be able to see it they going to see the kind of life that we live so that's how they're going to see so which they Shall Behold your good works is what they're going to behold glorify God in the day of visitation so if you kind of break that that that that sentence a little bit here he says if if you take away some of the punctuation he says having your conversation honest among the Gentiles we just we won't continue uh from there except Until the End glorify God in the day of visitation so having our conversation honest amongst one another right we glorify God in the day of visitation amen now we could put the rest of it in there because they're going to speak evil against you right they're going to they're going to call you evildoers by doing honest work amen for the Lord and then it says that and how are they going to why are they going to call you how what's going to make them call you that it's because of your good works amen which they shall see you performing because you're going to be in that atmosphere amen but we want to be that influence on them we don't want them to have the influence upon us right so First Peter chapter 3 goes right along with what he's saying in in in the previous chapter starting at verse 12 he says for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and we could thank the Lord for that that his eyes are over us not that we are righteous because even on our best day our righteousness is as filthy rags amen it's still not good enough so for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers how we could Rejoice to know that his ears are open to our cry that his ears are open unto what we have need of Amen that his ears are open unto our prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil right right so in verse 13 and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good see you're trying to do good but there's still that evil present no wonder Paul could say that I think it was Paul correct me correct me afterwards if I'm wrong the brother I'll just say the brother because I find myself in trouble because I have the wrong name uh anymore but the brother said that whenever I do good evil is present with me so we understand that evil is still in our midst so that's where the rejection has to come we have to reject that indirect influence that's so he says uh uh uh but and if you suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye happy are we that we could suffer for his you the the disciples were so happy because they counted themselves worthy to suffer for the Lord amen so happy are ye and be not afraid of their Terror neither be troubled but sanctify the Lord God where in your hearts because where uh uh uh as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so we want to protect that right so we want to uh uh uh we want to have that positive influence so but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askthe a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear see how embarrassing and how humiliating it is when somebody will come and ask you well why why are you a Christian Christian come on well I don't know uh my my my mom was my grandma was and and uh they had me to go to church so I guess I'm a Christian too that's not where it is that's right that's right that's not where it is it is where you have your influence to where you could say I was there when the spirit came so you can sing that song with the rest of the Saints I was there when the spirit came I was there because I partook of it well what changed you the spirit of the Lord changed that's right I was there when the spirit came and then what happened oh you might as well just have a seat you can sit down if you can but let me tell you of the glory of what the Lord has done for me because I was there when the spirit came the spirit moved but I had to accept it I had to recognize it as the word then I had to receive it then I could put it into action now see if you try to explain what you believe and you have no Revel it's just spewing out what somebody else told you but it has to become real to each and every one of us right it has to be a revelation to us now we can explain to somebody of the joy that we have in our lives the hope of glory we can't explain it if we haven't had the experience right and it's so much different the way the sister here can can explain it from the way that I can explain it from the way brother Jesse can explain it it that it might be a similar experience but they might explain it in different ways he might be able to reach somebody that she can't she might be able to reach somebody that he can't see we must be able to answer having a good conscience answer when a man asks us that's right of how you have the joy on the inside we're not trying to uh uh deceive anybody we're just giving the truth of what happened because I was there when it happened you're going to try and tell me it doesn't it doesn't work that way baloney I've done experience that one you're going to tell me that God can't heal I see experience right there you're done too late to see because I've already seen it I've seen it time and time again that the doctors were even kind of confused well I saw the the degeneration in your hip I I we see the process but your body must have healed itself yeah a word body healed it because a word body prayed for it amen a word body had faith for it what makes a a young teenage girl to receive her hearing one that was born deaf how what makes a a a a girl like that to receive her hearing in the middle of a service it's the move of God and when people are trying to say it's not true you're done too late why don't you come and taste and see the real happenings you try to say that we're in a cult let me show you the truth amen see God isn't going to work with those and you read it in the scripture where the Pharisees and Sadducees or somebody else is saying we know that God is working through this person because he won't work through a sinner amen he won't work those kind of Miracles through a sinner amen that's good amen yeah I know you can retort that well gifts and callings are without repentance I know you could do that but the Lord isn't going to give those miracles to to just anybody right right and we understand brother brandham did he was not the Healer amen right I am not a Healer brother sister you are not the healers but we know that there was one that is the Healer amen and when we get into that presence and when we meet that re uh uh uh requirement right is to seek him and not some other God that's right not some other entity right but when we seek Him in spirit and in truth amen where was I having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as evildoers even while you are doing good deeds they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation and conversation there means behavior that that they falsely accuse your good conversation or good behavior in Christ they will falsely accuse you if you haven't been so yet you just wait it's probably coming it's probably right around the corner but rest ass sure you better have that that that Armor of God be prayed up amen this is a spiritual warfare that we're in verse 17 for it is better if the will of God be so that ye suffer for well-doing don't suffer for the wrongdoing amen we want to suffer for doing good yes yes because that's the end of the scripture there uh uh uh that you that you suffer for well-doing than for evildoing I want to suffer by doing good good deeds good works not going out stealing not being a murderer not being a a rider I don't want to suffer for those things but I want to suffer for the good works I want to hear that statement enter into the joys of of of thy salvation amen enter the joys of the lord well done thou good and faithful servant that's what I want to hear yes oh you just need a pat on the back from my Lord and Savior yes I do amen yes I do because Praise of man is vain yes yes it is amen but false accusations have caused so many problems and and and has damaged so many lives and innocent people's lives right so first Peter 4:14 it says if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of on their part he is evil spoken of so see you're going to suffer for doing his works on on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part we glorify God on our part he is glorified because that's the influence that we carry because that's the spirit that we carry amen so why is influence so important I'm way behind in this so y'all are okay with that right you know me by now I know know you by now so influence is attained by how by having credibility you're not going to entertain somebody's influence unless they have some kind of credibility right so you're not going to willingly give up your money unless you know somebody credible right unless you're deceived right that's what these scammers are out there is they're deceiving people out of their money I don't want their money I want them to surrender their life to Jesus Christ I don't want their money they can keep their money but influence is attained by having credibility those around you have trust in you right now I'm talking about you as the believer so how are you going to have a good influence you must be credible how are you going to be credible by showing forth the good work works of the Lord right that's good by the fruits that we bear they're going to see who we serve not all influence is good some people just have the Knack to talk people into doing things some people just have that kind of an influence how'd you buy that car I don't know the guy was talking and all of a sudden I shelled out money I don't even need it he just told me I really needed this car see there's people out there that could really easily sway somebody I didn't need another house well how'd you end up with another one it was a really good deal do you realize what he took you for Slickers fast talkers yeah gainsayers is what they're called in the scripture that's right men Pleasers there you go on that's not so with a Believer amen am see it's important for leaders to have a characteristic of influence our influence needs to be without manipulation right we're not trying to manipulate people right it needs to be without elaborate schemes we're not trying to scam people we're trying to show truth right so we're not we're not trying to uh our influence needs to be without other forms of deceitfulness or coercion right like I said we are not trying to scam people we're trying we are leaders trying to lead souls to Christ that's right that's we are trying to lead the Lost amen but good influence is understanding how to work with and through others to achieve a stated objective while staying true to your core values and maintaining your integrity wow that's good see people want to work with you because they respect you see if you go to a job it's hard to work with some people but if we let's see how did this to work through work with people good influence is understanding how to work with and through others if you go to a job like I was saying if it's hard to work with some of those people but if you work with them and through them without compromising your stance amen showing yourself approved of this gospel right by doing the good works you still have to work with people that's true right some people just can't work with other people we understand that you know live peaceably among men as much as with is within you you do the best that you can so when you can have that influence that you still work with those that are undesirable and you work with them you work through them to attain an objective right to get the job done right you are using a Godly influence to get the job done that's right no matter what you feel about them no matter how hard it is you're still working with them that's how we have that Godly influence by not allowing their influence to come upon us that we compromise everything that we believe in right so the Lord told Brother brandham I I know here we go that's why I was that's why I said what I said at the beginning the Lord told brother brandham if you could get the people to believe if you can influence them of who they are and what they can attain if you can get them to believe not coer them not scam them but if you can influence them if you can get the people to believe that not even cancer will stand in the way amen well he say well that's motivational speaking how many times did it happen back then it seemed to be a habitual thing being in the presence of the Lord right it happens to be an issue of the presence of the Lord because when people get into that presence they addict themselves to the presence of the Lord amen because there's something about being in that presence there is Liberty in that presence there's Deliverance in that presence there is healing in that presence there is Faith buildup in that presence right so the Lord Tau him if you could get the people to to believe if we could get the people to believe then what is going to stand in the way not even cancer that's but we allow other things to get in the way or we might not know how to answer when we are asked but you know they might say oh that's just motivational speaking oh that's just to make people feel good that's a Feelgood religion you better believe it it feels good it sure feels good when burdens just get lifted it sure feels good when knees are healed and and somebody who is who is lame can jump up and run it sure feels good amen and I long to feel good amen but you know I want to tell you I don't care what they say they're not my infuence yes amen right they're not credible to me when all they have their argument is to criticize the good works isn't it real the scripture came real before you because we're doing the good works and then they're evil speaking evil of it why because they think that you're a cult wow and you know where it lies is because you go above and beyond the standards amen you maintain high standards they don't want to amen so they can't bring themselves subject unto it wow that is good amen so if they can't meet the standards oh you're eccentric oh you're extremist oh you are a cult like I said I don't care what they say because we will suffer for doing the good works if they can't call us brother and sister then something is wrong with their Spirit right amen because our goal our initiative our directive is to bring people to Christ and if they think that we have some other directive some other agenda then they are wrong they are reading into something that doesn't belong they are reading into something that doesn't exist amen yep I know this is being recorded right so if you turned it on it's being recorded if it's not then but I don't care what they say it's just another it's a cloudthree so just because they have words that come against a Believer doesn't make them true that's right there you go that's right it doesn't make it true it's just empty words it's empty criticism so don't fear it don't worry about it don't let it bring you down but you could be happy in it because you're suffering for the Lord for doing good works we know Salvation isn't attained by by works right it's attained by Grace yes and we do the good works through our faith yes we didn't get there because of our good works we do the good works because of what he's done in us that's right right because the spirit has done a good work in us we return the same because if it's the same Spirit we will do Spirit work we will do Lord Jesus work if it's Lord Jesus on the inside we will do Lord Jesus work amen what is it John 14:12 these same works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than these shall you do right and we understand that to be more not better not not not more in quality not a better quality One Faith one Lord one baptism right amen oh one God we are not polytheistic Believers right we are not polytheists we're monotheists for those that that that might confuse we believe in one God we serve one God we don't serve many gods amen now that gets in a whole trinitarian thing you know if you worship three Gods you worship three Gods but I worship one God I worship one God but we see like I said I don't care what they have to to say because they're not credible they're not true Witnesses right see we want to hear the testimony of a true witness somebody who's actually seen somebody who's actually heard somebody that's actually had experience if if somebody that that comes criticizing that has never experienced any of that then how credible are they to say oh this word isn't true come and dine the master calleth come and taste taste and see come and see but see the problem is is people will come and see but they have a critical spirit the whole time so they want to be blinded the whole time so they won't see anything the whole time well I'm not going to let myself be deceived in there but you wanted to see truth and you're blinding yourself because you won't open up to it no wonder oh what was it the the Lord couldn't do many Works in their midst because of their unbelief that's right right because of their unbelief yes but see people have it in their heart their hearts are are protected and hardened because they've been hurt before and that's where it's hard to have a tender heart to just open it up to anybody brother AAR you're you're probably the closest one that I know that come out of of the world so do I'm sure you probably experienced those things to where it was hard to come out and to let yourself let to open your heart to be wounded again to make yourself s vulnerable again because somebody somebody that I don't know your life but somebody that uh this is where it usually is is somebody that they trusted hurt them somehow right so they develop a Heart of Stone but until they see the real that's where I was at amen but until I saw the real you know they didn't love me to death they love me to life you know we use those I'm about to thirst of death I did this to death I did this to death but they loved me to life amen they they didn't love me to death they loved me to life amen but you've already seen what the Lord has done to build your faith you've already seen it so I don't have to try to influence you but sometimes we just get down because we have a negative influence that kind of obscures our vision obscures our memory of What the Lord Has Done but just remember through the scripture I will not forget all of his benefits I will not forget my Lord that has delivered me and I'm way out but I'm not way out as far as loss but I'm way off my notes is what I'm what I'm referring to but doesn't the scripture tell us to be zealous of what good works amen we should be excited to do the good works we should be excited to be honest we should be excited to love somebody that's unlovable that's a hard one oh let me hit home again we should be excited to forgive amen my brother ourselves because sometimes it's easy to forgive somebody else but it's hard to forgive ourselves we look at the dark the dark things that we've done in the past well the Lord can't use me the Lord won't he won't like the likes of me oh yes he will you can't go so far where the hand of God can't reach you if you've never blasphemed the Holy Ghost There's Hope what do you mean there's hope is there breath still in your body Hallelujah there's still hope now see what people forget and what people don't understand is that we have an advocate with the father but I'm So Far Away I've done this I've done that bring it to the altar amen and leave it there not to pick it up again you've got to leave it there that's right leave it there leave it there bring your burdens and leave it there that's where people struggle they want to take it up again they want to take that same Spirit no got to leave it there right but you know when I know and and I was a young believer at the time and many of you know brother Frank Crosman but I happen to tell him one time because it it dawned on me or my eyes were opened up to it that when I prayed about something and I thought about it all the time it just seemed like either forever or it didn't come but when I forgot about it I told him you know it seems like every time I forget about what I prayed for it comes to pass you ever hear the maybe it's an old wi still I don't know an old adage a watch pot never boils so if you put it in prayer and forget about it what am I saying forget completely forget what I'm saying is in that forget is we are putting in in the trust of the lord we are trusting the Lord with it we don't have to be burdened by it anymore amen everybody know what a tail Bearer is it's one who tells stories right well I think in the scripture is telling uh uh telling things that influence people's thoughts and ideas about a thing or a person a tail Bearer it's one I think the allude it alludes to somebody who's bringing telling false things about somebody a tail Bearer they're bringing false accusation and we and we're no stranger to it we've read it in the scripture how many times did it happen in the scripture so we see real events as as we read it in the scripture of how people were set up it's in the Old Testament and in the new so you can't oh that's just it's just New Testament or oh that's Old Testament we don't believe Old Testament anymore well guess what it's in both so you have no excuse there's no excuse for it so not to bring politics into this but I don't know if anybody's heard an interview or seen an interview with Nancy Pelosi of where she's again I'm not trying to bring politics I'm trying to bring an example and and they openly admit it okay so I'm not speaking ill of her or good I'm not saying one way or the other you draw your own conclusion but this is what was said in an interview with her is she said it's a smear tactic that's what they call it it's a political tactical move as far as where you accuse the other side of what you are doing and then when you present it that the other side is doing it and you bring it out in the open that people are are more likely to believe that so it's a smear tactic and that's what people are trying to do they try to accuse you of what they're doing you see where I'm going with that is all these people that are accusing accusing of being a cult amen these that are accusing of being false teachers are they not the ones that are doing it and trying to smear somebody else for doing good works am that's good that's awesome oh you're following a man you better believe it all these men because even even in the scripture with Abraham when that man was saying oh if you could go and tell my brothers and warn them of this hell and destruction says even if they have the law and the prophets amen a prophet came in flesh a prophet was a man oh my they have the law and the prophets and what else did they say even if one raises from the dead they will still not believe it's because of the hardness of their hearts it's because there's a Heart of Stone and not a heart of Flesh amen I don't know why I'm going to hitting it this hard but you understand what I'm saying but there are people out there that are going to try to ruin your influence because of jealousy because of malice because of a hardness of a heart that's and when they try to smear are they not doing what they're accusing OFW oh my see Joseph back in the day right we know the story of Joseph a very I want to choose the words because I want to say an iconic figure which we don't want to put him up as an idol right so we don't want to put him up as an iconic but a very important figure in the scripture so much as we understand that he types Christ through different things and what he's experienced in his life but in the that day in Piper's house when his wife was trying to coer him trying to subdue her him with her batting of the eyes and the gains saying of the trying to do the influence you grown-ups know what I'm talking about but trying to influence Joseph to do something that he shouldn't be doing and what did he do just casually walk away well I don't belong here I'm just going to move along you and I don't see eye to eye and brother ran he didn't want any part of it right because he was righteous and he didn't want any part of it amen but we understand the story of her influential testimony of how he tried to coers her and force his way upon her so why was her testimony believed and not his that's good I think it had something to do with social status there you go that's right come on but see and that's exactly why the scripture says be no respector of person that's right that's good but see in the mouth of two or three Witnesses oh but wait that could be perverted as well oh it can yes you know the story of Nebo right he had a Vineyard King Ahab said hey I would like to have your Vineyard would you sell it to me I'll give you something that's I'll give you land that's equal to it or the money of the price of what you give it to me what did he say no I can't give it to you I can't sell it to you because this is the land of my fathers I can't do this business transaction no matter how much I would like to he says I'm obligated I cannot do it so what did King Ahab do he ran home and he went in his bed and he cried and he wept and he like a little child because he didn't get his way right because there's something about that social status when you got everything prach it it and when you don't get what you want you cry like a little baby right right that's good I've been kind of hitting on you know people trying to read this book through an American and a a a a us an American mindset a mind frame which we cannot do that that's right yes but that's what it is we live in this country and we're so spoiled on the things even even a poor person is considered rich in the in a in somebody in the third world country's eyes right but see this this King got so upset because he couldn't get what he wanted so his wife comes in oh honey what is wrong I didn't get what I wanted nebb didn't give me his Vineyard and I want want it oh don't worry honey I'll get that Vineyard for you Jezebel we know we know Jezebel right so what did she do she went and she told so and so to get two sons of belal two sons of Mischief now if you understand Spirits Spirits like to cause m Chi that's right that's good that's something that I learned years ago we're learning how to use what you call a Ouija board you could buy it for $10.99 made by Milton Bradley at your nearest store not realizing what what they have on the Shelf there it's an instrument of evil that's necromancing necromancing you know what necromancing is is communicating with the de having fellowship with dead necro means dead so necromancing a Ouija board I don't know why I'm getting on a Ouija board but but that's how the whole thing is is uh uh Spirits would cause mischief to lie to you right an evil spirit would lie to an evil spirit you beta there's no loyalty among Thieves right so if you want to serve evil and you think they're going to take care of you they will devour their own that's right amen just take a look at I better not go there just take a look at what's happening in the political Arena because something didn't happen their way they are devouring one another right okay back to Jezebel got two sons of bow and influence them to speak lies to speak a false influence and what does she say oh go down there take two sons of bow and decree a fast so everybody's going to gather together and they're going to have a fast and make sure you put naboth at the head oh naboth is at the head those two sons of bow are on the opposite and what do they say oh I heard this man blasphemed God oh and the King oh it's one thing blaspheming God but blaspheming the king that's the carnality of it right they try to put a king above God anyways so she brought the influence of the two sons of bow more than willing to do this deed for her this evil deed and what did what did they do they went out and they stoned Nebo over a Vineyard see the damage a false accusation could cause that's right that's good Joseph didn't die but he sure went through it and it was ordained for him to go through those things so we could we could try to have pity on him but we know the outcome so we don't really have to have pity but you know you just feel bad for the guy going through that and somehow a righteous indignation comes up man if I was there you got the wrong spirit because you're wanting to call fire out of Heaven that's but see that's where our influence comes having the character of God having a Godly influence on those whether we can work with them if if whether we agree with them and if we could work with them through it to attain a a goal see we try to get along with with men we try to live peaceably among men as much as with is within us right right so I'm just going to tell you a story well you say well that's that's that's uh old Bible times okay this this is a serious story that I'm going to tell you at at the place that I used to work this happened a couple de probably a couple decades ago but it was probably 15 more than 15 years I can't remember the year so you might say oh all these are Bible examples I'll give you a real life example there was a man that I worked with super nice and just had a Gentle Spirit about him and he was accused of doing of wrongdoing to a couple teenage girls they brought forth an accusation to against him well this man ended up going to jail for it but somehow for some reason these girls were convicted in their hearts and they came out and they revealed the truth because all of us were like this guy oh there's no way there's no way and come to find out the man was innocent the man was innocent but how many times did that happened when these girls football Stars you know sports stars have false accusations against them people of renown people in Celebrity Status having now y'all know how I feel about celebrities but uh people that have these good standing statuses right so and people bring a false accusation against them it about destroys their whole livelihood it destroys the influence and that's what happened with this this man you know he retired so we didn't didn't really get to talk with him unless you knew where he lived which I never knew but when those girls came out and said he did nothing to us we were wrong for whatever reason they had but you know that weigh on that man like nobody's business because even though he was proclaimed innocent it was still put out there for people to doubt so just because that accusation was against him people would always wonder was it true or is it not true and you know that burden weighed on that man so much that he killed himself wow that is the damage of false accusation that is the damage of false influence or a bad influence that is the damage now all of us spoke you know he was a super nice guy all of us felt well those girls should have been held accountable they should be persecuted or they should be tried for homicide for murder because of a false accusation of What They Carried and they caused that man to kill himself right because he couldn't live with people wondering if he did that or not I don't I don't I don't condone suicide but I I kind of have an understanding of why he would I wouldn't want anybody to do that because he couldn't handle that because he would have had to face people people that he knew people that he didn't know and just always wondered and they'd probably always in their minds they would probably always wag their fingers at them shame on you right for what I'm innocent but see that we also do the same thing as we carry we carry those burdens of about and sometimes it gets to be too much for us but we don't have to let we don't have to carry those burdens amen I'm I'm just going to I don't even so I don't know how much longer I'll be I don't know if I'm [Laughter] closing uh but but through that man and look at the look at the same influence during the Salem Witch Trials anybody ever read those how many innocent young girls and uh women suffered at the hand because of an accusation all somebody had to do is say hey I saw them doing such and such hey I saw and heard them blaspheme God and the king and that's all it took now see we know in the scripture in the mouth of two or two or three Witnesses let everything be established if you notice there were two sons of bow so they met that requirement of two or three right but alls it took in Salem is it somebody to bring an accusation and no matter what they said no matter how much they pleaded their innocence it didn't matter because once they were declared a witch or they were practicing witchcraft that was it I think it was PE if so if if if one person was jealous of another that's all they had to do is lie H and when you know it they they claim to be Christian oh all in the name of Christianity Ah that's not the work of a Christian that's right amen backbiting and destroying somebody else's influence is not the work of a Christian that's right amen so everybody familiar with Jim Jones I read this this was a while back and it got me so upset because I see that they tried to accuse brother brandom of being with Jim Jones if you search Jones in the message if you search Jones there aren't that many hits of Jones and when he mentions Jones it's just like keeping up with the Joneses exactly right I think of and when they said that oh that he would have uh meetings with with Jim Jones and Jim Jones was a follower of William brandham he might have been a follower of William brandom but so are a lot of people are follower of the Bible but yet are not Christians all Israel is not Israel every Christian that professes to be a Christian is not a Christian right amen right so you have extremists you have people take the message too far and then you have the other side to where they don't take it far enough right but see and this kind of infuriated me when the accusation came out against Jim Jones because I was trying to find some old Flyers now see you got you got to throw it right back out there right because they're trying to find evidence and wouldn't you know I couldn't find any evidence so all these people have opinions right all these people have empty accusations and no facts yes I don't know why I'm going here but I went I went here at the old church too this this was stuff in my notes but uh I was going to try to leave this part out but but even they're trying to put him with Jim Jones but the whole thing I want to get to with Jim Jones is not so much that with brother Brandon but the whole issue or the whole thing with Jim Jones was you ever hear the the expression if you worked in a factory or someplace people will say oh you drank the Kool-Aid talking about uh you went over to the dark side of of management you know uh so that's where that term comes from is drinking the Kool-Aid because Jim Jones had such an influence on people he had a a thumb on the people kind of ruled them in through fear and oppress them and if they tried to leave they couldn't they were stuck oh it was the oh sounds so good oh come with us the influence but once they were there they were stuck and then when they got caught they had a whole mass of people forced them to drink it or some drank willingly the Kool-Aid that poisoned the whole Camp right and if we're not careful if we allow the poison into the camp it will poison the whole that's right Camp that's we were warned of that there's going to be somebody that comes in that's going to shoot the poison in amongst the Believers and try to call desent cause dissension cause division we don't want that that's where we have to draw that much closer together at the end am I saying this body absolutely am I saying this body the body and Al be absolutely am I saying this body the body in albian the body in Indiana the body in Nicaragua the body in Cuba the body in India yes amen we need to unify that much more amen see we need to figure out what we believe and and that's why it's so important when we are asked of what we believe we should be able to answer in a good conscience of what we believe amen because it has to become real to you it has to be real to me it has to be real to everybody in here here if it's not real to you then you're not going to influence anybody that's right amen amen see with all this this is the same Spirit of Janice and jambre it's the same Spirit of cor and Dayan because it's trying to undermine or pervert the work of the Lord amen so I'm debating what do I want to say next Lord lead me what what do you want minutes I told a story uh at the at the home church when I was little and then uh I'll I'll read a couple quotes because I don't I don't want you to get bored so when I was young and I was in grade school don't don't hold it against me but my my one brother and my sister we we and I don't do this you heard it here but we broke into the school uh we we came from Maryland but we broke into the school down there the window was already broken I'm I'm just saying that and I'm still maintaining that innocence to this day but we got caught and very we we should have got caught we deserved to get caught so uh the principal there I remember her name was uh Mrs Richmond and she stood about this tall I think it's a great school I was taller than her but anyways that's that has nothing to do with the story uh but she had asked me did you did you break the window no we didn't break the window did you break the window did you not hear me the first time no we did not break the window did you break the window no we did not break the window it was already broken because there was tape all over it you know and my brother just pushed it in and open the window okay did you break the window goodness gracious lady no but that was a great schooler I I didn't have that Gusto that I have now so as a as a young I think I was like seven maybe eight years old so easily influenced I maintained that influence but I got so sick and tired of her asking me I just said yes we broke the window and that was it so lesson learned stand your ground right don't fall under the influence because you're going to be buffeted you're going to be hit you're going to be hammered by by this by this doubt by this unbelief by this this by this by this you're going to be hammered but don't fall into it stand your ground amen stand your ground no matter how much Mrs Richmond ask you if you broke the window don't give in amen you maintain your faith that's good and it should make you that much stronger because happy are we to be able to suffer for doing good works for him amen so I'm going to read a couple couple quotes is that okay better get a drink first it's a long good thing you're sitting down G to be long but it's very applicable he says and when we lose our influence as a father as a mother and he goes so far as to say as a Christian he says and we when we lose our influence as a father as a mother as a Christian as a businessman as a minister when we lose our influence with people now we could be very popular in the line of the world and go along with the world but I mean as what we represent we represent Christ amen Christ is it all the the whole thing of what we live for because Paul said for me to die is gain but for me to live to for me to um messing it up but for me to live is Christ amen amen so that should be our mind frame yes if we die it's gain to us but as we live it's it's a gain to us as well because we live unto Christ so he says but I mean as what we represent we represent Christ when we lose our influences that as standing out how can we blend in with with the day when God is so against the day how could M Mah say go on go on up and Prosper my vision is right with yours when he knew that God had cursed that evil people his vision had to be contrary so no matter how much they paid balum to uh curse uh Israel he could not do it why because he was a prophet he had a vision of the Lord he had the word of the Lord and he had to speak the word of the Lord so and and and a man's Vision today that could go with the trend of the world and still remain a minister there there's something wrong with that with the man's Vision you know what God said about this Rich leaan church he put him on the outside or uh Le the leoan church put him on the outside we cannot stand with the popular popular belief and vote of the day we've got to be against that thing does that mean that you have to take up arms because you're against it no you just don't receive it right you just reject it amen right so and that was in 63 in influence in 64 influences he says remember the Bible said you are living written Epistles read of all men right people are going to see our lives if we can't preach the gospel they will see how we live our lives and that is preaching the word so you don't have to stand behind a Pulpit to be a preacher that's right you could preach preach the gospel use words if necessary right so now many that's not my own I can't remember who said it but I I really like it I I say it a lot and and how true it is because a a a life lived is worth more than a thousand words when people see a life lived so now many people won't read the Bible but God has made you a living representative you are a walking letter should be a walking Bible Christ in you amen you should be walking you should be the walking word of God and if you profess to be a Christian what you're influencing will make you have have to answer for many Souls whe that you've turned aside away from Christ in the in that day of judgment see this this is for us and people that are against us that uh and if you profess to be a Christian if you profess to be a Christian what you're influencing will make you have to answer for many Souls that you have turned aside away from Christ that's right whether it's us whether it's denomination whether it's non- denomination that doesn't agree uh with us if we can come and agree that Jesus Christ is the Lord Our Savior that we need to be baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit and that we receive the gifts of God that we have common ground that we can agree on where it gets all muddled up is men's Doctrine when people want to d uh try to bring Doctrine and they put their own interpretation to it or turn it spurn it into the way to fit their lifestyle they will be held accountable of how they've swayed people away from Christ that's right and if we have done so we will be held accountable if we have swayed people away from Christ absolutely so this is this is out to let your light so shine before men in 61 talking about the stoning of Steven continuing on with the with the idea that we are written Epistles read of all men he says and when they stoned him to death throw him outside the city and beat him to death with stones when he was dying he raised his head to heaven and asked for and asked forgiveness for those who was stoning him my who would have a heart in this day to do that come on if we were being beaten would we be able to sincerely look up and say I forgive you because you don't know what you're doing may you find the Lord Jesus Christ would you be able to say that with your dying breath or would you still try to keep on fighting that's good that's the nature of a man is the it's either fight or flight you know and if and if you want to keep living you're going to fight to survive right the same G same as Jesus did at the cross then God seen his little advertisement board wow I really like how he puts that out there then God seen his little advertisement board being taken down Steven looked up to heaven said behold I see Heavens open up or I see Heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God and he fell asleep in the arms of God he was an adverti advertisement board for a hungry world you say well how many was there you uh you said there was maybe 5,000 how many of them got saved there was one he never accepted it right then but years later so you never know the influence that you have on somebody just because you don't see immediate results right see our job is to plant the seed it might be somebody else's duty to water that seed right because when people said oh we're of Apollos we're of of Paul but one planteth one WTH we all work toward one goal is to bring a soul to Christ right and to encourage other believers right so uh he says how many of them got saved he said there was one he never accepted it right then but years later Hallelujah somewhere your influence never dies there was one held held the coat uh Saul that young Pharisee standing there consulted and gave witness to his death but when he saw the that advertisement of the power of the resurrected Christ and that little fellow had never got away from him that same man Paul that one standing there that morning LED tens of thousands of souls to Christ and still is amen yes and still is amen through his influence of testimony of how he stayed true and faithful amen no matter how many shipwrecks he was in no no matter how many times he got whipped right he kept the faith even now his testimony still Rings true it is still bringing souls to Christ amen because one man was willing to give his life to be an advertising board for Jesus Christ what ought we what ought we to do today no matter we don't have to we don't have to have big audiences we don't have to preach to 10,000 we don't have to even preach we could be God's advertisement board how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel some of you older men see old see old women start some some young man on the field out there would win 10,000 souls to Christ is because he saw Christ in you that you presented Christ to him in the simple in the simple power of the Gospel wow that's good see people try to make it so complicated they speak with eloquent words to make it sound like they're the only ones who have the truth come on if we could just speak it simple Paul spoke it simple yes we don't have to make it complicated amen right because it's it's with the hardness of Hearts where people come and say well what about this can I get away with this is what they're saying if I do this but if I could just do this and weasel some some kind of sin in there to still uhh uh play with the world or have common ground with the world no you've got to separate from all of those things but people just can't they can't let go wholeheartedly because they want one foot left out in the world they still want a part of it Lord help us but you never know what kind of an influence that you're going to have on somebody that's right brother sister somebody see a change in your life well what caused that change well let's sit down and let me tell you for a little while this might take a little while but I used to do this but the Lord took that I used to do this but the Lord took that I used to do this and it just opens up you start remembering oh my that's right I used to do this but the Lord took that away I used to do this but the Lord took that away and would you know it the Lord is glorified by your testimony amen amen see I think we need the Christ yes sir only way we see Christ is when he reflects in each other I see Christ in you you see him in me that's how we watch Christ I come to the meeting I start preaching I watch the people you could see whether they're interested or not just a few moments yeah sometimes you could tell I I can agree with that there most times you can tell you look over your audience you could tell whether you're boring them or whether you're not see and the first thing you know now see that that's going to hit somebody well I don't want them to think I'm boring that I'm bored a Believer doesn't want to have that kind of a I don't want that reputation yeah I'm I'm focused we hey I get it sometimes we get tired and and you know it's uh if it's warm I start falling asleep if if it's warm I remember we we we had Brothers man and they're and they're going right in it and I'm enjoying it and I'm sitting there dozing on how am I dozing off right now stay awake buddy but it's hard yeah I get it sometimes it's just hard you know so he says you could tell whether you're boring them or whether you're not he says see in the first thing you know you see them sitting there hanging unto every word under expectation waiting to hear a word of encouragement waiting to hear a word that demolishes the influence that they just came across they're waiting to hear a word from that they're waiting for a a a word to build faith is that what your expectation is Lord I have a need I I want to be closer to you I want to be built up I want this spiritual house built up into what you would be pleased with amen so it might not be something today that you have need of but tomorrow next week next month oh I remember so and so talked about this man that was encouraging I'm I'm not saying to look upon me I'm not saying that at all but as the Lord leads you take that as the Lord spoke to me this way amen because I'm a nobody I'm a nobody so but the spirit that I carry am and carrying his spirit I don't know if I ever preached that message here or not I think I did I am nobody yet somebody see if we can have that mindset I'm I'm a nobody that's awes but yet I'm somebody because I have his Spirit living inside of me see even brother Brandon was saying we don't need big groups following after us we don't need big Billboards out there uh pointing to us but if we can point others to Christ then I'm insignificant and I'm sure brother your pastor believes the same way I'm insignificant but he is everything if you miss if you miss me you didn't miss out on much but if you miss him you miss out on everything so that's my heart this morning and that's the way I that I always want to come and Minister the word to you is in that way but he's saying I'm seeing Christ reflected in that person because he's hungering and thirsting for God is it okay for another quote here yes sir keep going amen he says oh we are here brother sister we are at that time let's let's let the Holy Spirit influence us to the word of God let's let God do the influencing in our hearts and not be influenced by others see this ought to put us into action this ought to put us into action remember what we said what uh when does the change come the change comes after hearing the word that's when the change comes right that's when a person is converted they have to to hear the word they have to receive the word then they have to act upon the word that's and that's a whole uh uh basis of Faith you have to be able to hear it because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God right that's where faith comes in so then we have to receive that word if we can't receive the word then we need to get back to the Altar and seek the holy spirit because something is wrong if we can't uh accept and punctuate every word of God with an amen then something is wrong amen so then we have to act upon that right so he's uh that's where the change comes so he's saying let us have the Holy Spirit influence us to the word of God let's excuse me let's let God do the influencing in our hearts and not be influenced by others see this ought to put us into action with reverence and humility the pillar of fire Vindicated among us again not it didn't die out in in The Exodus when they were led by the pillar of fire it didn't die out God didn't die out then when they crossed after they crossed the Red Sea that wasn't we believe God up to here and then we're going to put a period on look at the vast happenings all through scripture of What the Lord Has Done It doesn't stop here at the last period in Revelation it doesn't stop there come on he's a living God this is a Living Word it's still living on the inside here amen right that's good and I lost my spot but that's exactly what caused those Apostles when they seen that word uh made made manifest that influenced him they they said we are sure of this thing because they saw the truth happening amen he says they got in actions yes when when his promise was fulfilled when they seen that Jesus promised them that he would send the promise of the father upon them Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but take ter ter ye doesn't mean pray it just means wait Terry means wait wait up wait up there at the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power on high endued with power from on high and when this influence of the Holy Ghost struck them it filled them they seen the word that Jesus Promised and fulfilled now I wonder if it would take the same influence on us this afternoon if we seen what what he promised to do in the last days fulfilled what kind of an influence would it give us what all we have seen done in these last days ought to put us in action it sure ought to ought to with reverence and humility amen if you stand your feet I'm just going to read one more quote and this is from that time in 1962 he says there was a maniac one day uh up in gatera who was cutting himself and they'd bind him in Chains now see most people would just count him as lost and wouldn't want anything to do with him well he's lost just let him go now see who was cutting himself and they'd bind him in Chains and his power of 10 times an ordinary man could break the powers of them chains I always thought if he was so perfectly under the influence of the devil and being able to do that see pay attention to what he's saying here if this man under the influence of the devil could do those kind of works amen of how it looked like he was so full of power being demon-possessed uhuh he says what what the devil takes a hold of a person insane it takes men and women to hold him he breaks them chains completely surrendered to the devil if he could break chains how much more could we break completely surrendered to God how much more powerful is God's power than the devil's and there he was this poor maniac and he was always out there in the graveyard cutting himself with stones and and attacked everybody but one day he met God but one day he met God and things changed for him after that he was clothed in his right mind why because he had met God Amen he had met god let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we just thank you so much for the day that you've given oh Lord we thank you for your word and we know it is truth father we just thank you that we are able to see into your word Lord like we said uh at the start we might not know all the Mysteries and even Paul Paul said even if he knows all the M Mysteries if if we don't know the Mysteries but even if he knew all the Mysteries and if he spoke with tongues and he did all had all these gifts but without love it didn't mean anything so Lord if we could have that love if we don't know all the Mysteries if we could still have that love for one another Lord are we going to make mistakes sure we're going to make mistakes we live in this human body we're still in this Fallen condition but Lord we just thank you so much that uh where there something uh incorrect the word comes and corrects the error and I thank you so much for when the word comes and and makes a correction to those things so Lord even if when we were wrong we pray oh God that you would just come and let your spirit come and do that correcting for us because in our hearts we want to be sincere we want to be influencers influencers of of your word we want to carry your word we want to carry your spirit with us to share it with others oh Father Lord we just pray that we would a avoid the fleshly lust and things of the world that would try to uh uh tantalize us and try to tempt us to to uh uh go over to the other side and to forsake your ways because people try to say that this is an old outdated thing that people can't follow it that it's outdated but Lord we know as a group of Believers here as as a body of Believers we have seen your truth in action we have seen things happen amongst the ranks oh Father for Lord we can stand for shorty and say that Thy word is truth so Lord no matter what comes no matter what goes that we would stay steadfast no matter what if somebody's trying to pry your word out of our Lives we just ask that you would help us by your spirit that we would take up the armor of God that we would withstand the Ws of the devil that we would put to shame those uh uh by our obedience put to shame those that would try to false accuse uh uh put false accusations against us oh Lord those that would try to speak evil against us may we maintain our walk with you may it not have any burden on us oh God may it not have any effect of of how we think about you how we feel about you and how we serve you but it it it should have an impact of how we serve you Lord that we should want to serve you all that much more father we just pray that you would be with this body of Believers oh God each of my brothers and sisters in the in the uh hearing of my voice I just pray that you would give them strength that they would withstand in this day for Lord we know this is the lead Dean age maybe it's the end of the lead Dean age coming into a new age oh God but Lord may they stand true no matter what comes and and what tries to batter their sales oh God I just pray that they would continue and sailing on for you oh God that they would keep their keep their minds on you that they would keep their eyes in your truth reading your word praying and living for you oh god

pray that uh each one as they gather here may they be excited to come into the house of God because they can't wait to hear what's going to come and being preached they can't wait to hear the word of God they can't wait to raise their hands and and praise and thanksgiving to you they can't wait to worship you oh Lord father I just pray that you would put that if if any man is lacking that today any woman I pray that you would just feel that in their in their lives today and Lord I pray that you would just speak to the brother Lord you know who I'm thinking of and and you know who come upon my mind oh God I just pray that you would put it upon that brother's heart to let him know that the greatest spiritual battle that he's been ready to face is about to come upon him and Lord I pray that you would just be upon him that he would just take that Ephesians 6 the armor of God that he would uh uh be able to withstand those things and not fall under the devil that's trying to come and take him away father Lord I pray that you would put your strength upon him put your truth in his mind in his heart oh God I thank you Father for all things that you've done thank you Lord Jesus Jesus may you be glorified Lord as we read that scripture on our part you are glorified on their part he is evil spoken of Lord may we never speak an evil word against you may we never speak an evil word against another believer oh god father we thank you in Jesus Christ we ask all these things Lord we also ask that you would be with each one as we depart from here that you would give them safe travels Lord Monday morning is coming and I pray that you would strengthen each one to be able to face Monday morning Lord we could have all kinds of faith on Sunday morning Sunday evening but for some some reason Monday morning comes and it seems to shake many people and it just ruins their day ruins their week but Lord if they could just be H uh refreshed and renewed in your Holy Spirit when they wake up it doesn't matter what would come that they would still worship you and give you praise again we ask all this in your precious name oh Lord Jesus Christ we love you we appreciate you
