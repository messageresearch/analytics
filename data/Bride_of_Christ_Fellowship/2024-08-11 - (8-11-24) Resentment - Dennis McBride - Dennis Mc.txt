lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled Colossians chapter 3 we want to come down to verse 12 Colossians chapter 3 starting at verse 12 it says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering verse 13 says forbearing one another and forgiving one another amen If any man have a

which also ye are called in one body he says and be ye thankful may the Lord bless his word Saints you may be seated praise the Lord okay so there are some new faces that I'm seeing this morning so just as an introduction I'm brother Dennis McBride from uh Columbia South Carolina and uh by God's grace I've been ministering since around about 2000 um It's been a a good experience a wonderful experience overall because I my upbringing I I didn't I wasn't brought up in a Christian environment um I was brought up in in a a real worldly environment um I was surrounded by an atmosphere that uh it's just the grace of God that I am who I am right um CU it it wasn't a good atmosphere at all uh but regardless of my surroundings um God was with me the whole time and I believe we've come to understand that now that even when you didn't know him he already knew you and he was actually with you he was keeping you I can remember situations that I was in and as now that I look back from from where I am now looking back in retrospect I can just see his hand all along the way um I won't go into any details of anything but I'm just I'm grateful I'm grateful so I want to I want to do something very quickly uh from last night we were dealing with the spirit of a tail Bearer and I just kind of feel L to kind of just start off with this because when it comes to Satan and the whole realm of evil spirits we deal with spirits on a daily basis we're dealing with them right now in this service just because we're in church that doesn't mean it's just all God that's here even though he's present evil spirits are just as present and they want to do what they want to for one they want to hinder you and I from getting any closer to God right he want that they want to hinder you and I from being able to become engaged right so they try to bring distraction to our minds to cause our thoughts to drift off on on whatever it can uh just to get us to uh uh not be able to be attentive to whatever the Holy Spirit wants to say to us but that's their objective they want to they want to keep our minds so far away from God and and and hold it there right but also uh the scripture says that uh Satan has many objectives or what have you but the Bible says that he comes to steal kill and destroy right so that's his objective and no matter how he tries to come into a person's life he wants to if if he can take that person all the way out and listen it's a physical death and it's a spiritual death right the Bible says a woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she's living right so Satan want to sweep people off into you know entertainments into the pleasures of his life cuz he knows that he will'll render that person you know spiritually dead right because that becomes a God right a person that continue to give themselves over to those things and give God less and less and less whatever we allow to be exalted above God in our Liv Saints to God is an idol yes sir praise the Lord so as we go over these lessons and what have you there is no way that we can really gain the victory in enter into a place to where we can effectively resist the devil unless we actually have for one the baptism of the Holy Ghost and even if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have to stay in a consecrated place because if you don't stay in a consecrated Place listen even with the Holy Ghost you can slip into a natural carnal frame of mind and you can actually Walk In the Flesh that's right you understand what I'm saying meaning you're not walking according to the dictates of the spirit you're not looking at life right you know and and we hit those snags sometimes right but we thank God for his precious Holy Spirit we thank God for his love right because he comes and he begins to call us from those places because we're his child and we don't belong there right so God is you know he'll come to us and he'll he'll that small still voice will begin to speak to us and say now you need to stop you remember David David said as I thought on my ways that means that he had drifted yes amen but because he was God's child God saw him drifting but he said okay now you've come to your stopping point and the Holy Spirit begin to deal with David's heart and it made David stop and consider his ways when the Holy Spirit is dealing with your life that's what he does he makes you stop and he makes you consider all the things that's contrary to him that might be present in your life and as David stopped to think on his ways God convinced him and he says now I'mma turn my feet back to his testimonies that mean I'mma go back into the way I'mma repent right you're going in one Direction but when you repent you stop and go back in the right direction praise God Amen and when that happens Saints now you're able to come into a restoration you're able to come into a refreshing Glory I don't know about you but I do know about you because we kind of are like light CU I believe you the children of God too right amen when when you when when when you are out of the way or when when the enemy has somehow allow or caused you to drift you feel like a fish out of water yes yes it don't feel right and it'll never feel right because you weren't made to live like that think like that or be like that you can't be comfortable that's a blessing to be able to feel like that because then you know I mean that that's a confirmation to you that you don't belong out there so you must belong with God so let me get back to where I'm comfortable at where I feel my best at praise God amen so we were dealing with the spirit of a tail Bearer on last night and and and and a tail bearing Spirit it it it comes because another part of the characteristics that that that comes from the works of Satan is to divide and to conquer so Satan wants to to each individual he wants to break the individual down we ended on the little foxes spoiling Divine on last night amen those little things Satan comes and injects in a person's life and when you and when you're not obessed when you're not informed about certain things you don't you're not able to readily identify what it is unless the Holy Spirit just really helps you to see it you don't know what you're getting into or you don't know what you're opening yourself up to but that Spirit wants to come in and it wants to wean you away from God and the things of God right and and ultimately it wants to be able to use each individual as a tool to bring A disruption to somebody else's life so these evil spirits are just tools of the devil to bring about division because the Bible plainly says and I'll end scriptural wise on this right here the Bible plainly says that where is no where where where no tail Bearer is that's a person that spreads rumors and Gossel about somebody where there is no tail Bearer The Bible says Strife it ends right there because you don't have nobody that's going about to bring about division amongst the people that's being used by the enemy in that kind of away but I want to leave you with this because this is very important right cuz we're living in the world the spirits are just there and we're all able to be anointed by these Spirits yes but it's one thing that I believe God wants us to keep in mind remember when he was on Calvary when Christ was on the cross what's the most notable thing he said while he was on that cross Saints he said father forgive them for they know not what they do isn't that a blessing Saints amen and when he comes inside of us he's able to help us to gain that same perspective so the prophet brought this out and why are we not a denomination he says and now I've went to everybody that I know it of because in his own church the enemy had come in and he began to bring about disputes and disruptions and arguments and disagreements and differences amongst the homes of the Saints and when he's able to affect homes and individuals you know what else that affects it fects churches right cuz even though you come together you you know you know you're supposed to go to church and whatever but if you come together and people have wrong spirits on them amen it disrupts the atmosphere it hinders the flowing of the spirit he says and now I've went to everybody that I know of brother brother brandom understood the importance of getting differences settled amen he understood the the magnitude of how could it affect the actual Ministry and the church itself he says he says they had little a little something you know he was talking about being against one another he said if there's anything out of the way now you remember I told you a long time ago we was going to get it straightened up and I know that you know there's a different Spirit here than there was before so when all the quarreling and the fussing and the differences and whatever form that might have been in was present it was affecting the atmosphere of the church that's right right and the Holy Spirit had the prophet hone in on that and say we got to get this atmosphere back right again cuz God needs to have freedom Amen to be able to move freely amongst the Saints because every one of us have real needs and we need a real living God to come down in our midst and help to quench everything that we stand in need of but the enemy don't want that that's why he moves in these very slick and subtle ways but the Holy Spirit had the prophet dialed right in on it he says and I know that you know there's a different Spirit here than there was before he says see that's right now don't let it leave no more you be very attentive to how you allow yourself to think and how you allow yourself to operate and how you allow yourself to speak amen cuz we don't want to let the enemy come in no more in the same ways that he was able to do it before Hallelujah watch he says I charge you before Jesus Christ don't let it leave stay right here with it see just keep everything iron he says iron right down and move right on he says you are Brethren it's coming to the Very Special Part here he says it's never your brother or sister right when situations disputes disagreements and things of that nature come about the enemy wants us to focus in on the person and then you start having feelings toward a person you start not wanting to be around the person you understand and that's the very thing that hurts God because we're his family and God don't want any divisions amongst his family but the devil does so he's he's warning us he says it's never your brother or sister he says that does anything wrong can we say Amen to that whenever somebody when whenever you feel like somebody has done you wrong please by the grace of May the Lord help this to come back to your minds it ain't my brother it ain't my sister so I'm not going to look at them and allow myself to get upset with them I'mma pray that this Spirit be cast out from among us and that my brother be reconciled amen back to the presence of God again that we might be able to move forward in a Christian character now you talking about maturity amen God is grooming us Saints to be that church that he had in his mind Lord have mercy he says it start he says he said it's that Spirit of the devil gets in there see he goes RS around he says and just feel sorry for the brother or sister and know it's Satan getting between and if you have some feeling about it meaning you're affected you feeling strange about it he says you get that out of you right quick you see cuz it'll caner you that means it'll come in and it'll begin to work and as you allow it to sit it'll begin to break you down spiritually it'll bring you into frame of minds and cycles of thoughts amen you don't realize if it'll be grieving the Holy Spirit right away from yes sir he said if you continue in this way he said you will hurt your pastor and he said you will cause the spirit of Christ to have to depart meaning his anointing won't be able to abide because he's not welcomed in those atmospheres and that's individually or as a group as a family no matter where you put it at yes everybody understand so now we're going to go into the lesson for the day praise God I just kind of wanted to touch on those things but the lesson for the Day Ties back into that as well okay and what I want to do by the grace of God I'mma go back to Hebrews chapter 12 because this actually ties into the scripture from last night I I believe it was last night it might have been Friday night where Jesus made the statement Jesus said that which goes inside of a man that doesn't defile a man he said but what comes out of a man meaning what comes from the heart spoken by the mouth in words those words have an anointing with it there's a source there's there there's a either an upward Source meaning it's coming from from above cuz the Bible talks about the wisdom that descended right but then there's also another wisdom that comes from the Dark World right and you can tell it by its characteristics you understand and everybody as the prophet said we're we're Mortals living in the first the these three dimensions light time and matter isn't that right brother all right and then we have above us dimensions and that's normally where the the the good things are the Heavenly things all right but then you have also dimensions and I'm saying up and down but just in respect to Good and Evil right so you have other dimensions where demons work you have Dimensions where people that have died that don't know God that didn't know God refuse them they were ordained to it they're being held you know in that Dimension and you have the prophet allow I mean God allowed the prophet to see beyond the curtain of time right and he saw where the saints that went on before us are waiting right wait waiting wait waiting for that rapturing day right but now we're in here in between that and this this Mortal realm and he says you're influenced either from from either side right so your thoughts your words your actions your music what you watch all of that is being influenced you understand what I'm saying and I'm just going to tell you my my personal testimony right this is brother McBride I never the Lord by his grace he took T he I'm not I I've not been bound by television for for many years I have no need neither any dependency upon Television right but we're not talking about just the actual material that is made out of but it's what projected on it right but I don't even want to make that a focal point because anybody that has a phone you might not have a TV but you got access at the swipe of a thumb to everything plus you understand what I'm saying so the Lord has been dealing with me on these things right because it matters to God how much time you pour into things brother bradam he said you don't he you know he he spoke in one wise about a you know a woman that goes and prostitutes herself out right she goes and sells her body to other men and whatever for you know carnal Pleasures or whatever and to receive gain or whatever but he made this statement that always stood out to me he says prostitution is on a higher level he said you can prostitute your time that means that time that could be given to God in prayer and in the reading of his word and listening to the word that he s in this hour it's being neglected or giving a minimal space to have your attention amen but then you know when it comes to our phones and things of that nature look how much time can be given some people spend time they spend hours yes sir the phone has become so addictive until whenever somebody has a break in time they want to pull the phone out and give get on it to be able to see what's there so in a in in a in in a in a in a a a Time range of one day you know how much time people spend on their phones and now okay what are you looking at those algorithms are like demons cuz demons study us right yes sir and they they they they see what you give your attention to they they they they see what you pause yes yes you know for a woman or a man or whatever you know there there are certain things that are attractive and there are certain things that'll never be attractive you know it can be men or other men or women or it can just be things in the earth I've never had an issue with smoking right now it's only by the grace of God now okay I wasn't keep him myself I tried marijuana one time I said I don't know what in the world people do this stuff I tried alcohol coming up I drunk alcohol and you know I'm with my so-called friends I ain't know that they weren friends at that time I thought they was friends but now now now I give my life to Christ I said man that was working for the enemy you know but I I I tried drinking beer and and I tried but it was just so nasty to me I said man how people drink this stuff and eat their food together it make me vomit and I tried hard they call I guess hard liquor or whatever I tried that stuff too but then what cured me from that I was in a Marine Corps and I was at a certain plon or base and a Gunnery Sergeant one of my superiors gave me a little bit and I drunk that stuff man and I had to walk across the parking lot to get to my squad Bay and I couldn't hardly walk across the parking lot I kind of buckled halfway through and when I got to the bay and got in bed I was just so it made me so sick that was the last time that was the grace of God he knew what he had in store for me in the further part of my life and I didn't know that right but he was just protecting me and helping me not to become engulfed you know in those habits and what have you you understand so it wouldn't be too much of a battle for me but I'm I'm saying that everybody have different weaknesses and Satan studies that so when you're on your phone there's things you will pause on that somebody else won't pause on but when you pause that thing is tracking the time that you take to get beyond that particular page and whatever you spend that extra two or three or four seconds on that begins to FL it begin to pick up more of that content and pull it into your page it says this is where their interest is right here and that's what demons do they throw baits out there to see what they can catch your attention by and whatever you pause on the longest time that's the thing it begins to bring more by your way right Hallelujah and if you pay attention to it if you pause the spirit that's behind it when you give your attention to it now think about this eve listen to was serpent right she was perfect fortified behind God's word but when that serpent began to talk to her what did she do she stopped for a moment brother brandom said that's where she made her mistake she stopped just to consider what it was saying and when she stopped listen now that's the that's the real thing God was trying to protect us from when he when it comes to television as well as songs whatever you give attention to the spirit that's inspiring that that brings that song Or that show or whatever about that Spirit comes directly in you right then and that's the thing that pulls people and makes them begin to become addicted I got to look at this I got to listen to this and they can't let it go it's because they've given an open door to that devil yes sir not realizing it so when you're scrolling through your phones those Spirits are ready to transfer amen and get inside of a person because once you're bound by it you can't get away from it it's something that pulls you and and when Eve got anointed by that Spirit by the reception of the word it changed her perspective now what God Said was damned and wrong now she looked at it and said it was good it was that bad it don't bother me to watch this or to listen to this it's that Spirit bringing a deception about that's right G glory to God I don't mean to yell forgive me I just get caught away sometimes but you understand what I'm saying this is what you and I battle with on a daily basis yes sir now if you want this is I'm telling you what the Lord has been dealing you don't need none of that Hallelujah we become accustomed to things we become dependent upon certain things but listen I'm telling you you don't even need it if you got stranded on an island for a whole year no phone no nothing your habits will change once you come back into civilization you ain't a't going you ain't going to be looking for a TV or phone or whatever you would have been without it you would have gone through the withdrawal right all the crying and oh I can't watch my I got my phone oh you cleared up all that be done cleared up now you you normal now but Saints we don't need these things amen this Society has impressed these things upon us but you know what it's done it's weakened us hallelujah how did Paul come to the lifestyle that he did yes that brother said I stay under my body that I might bring it into subjection no distractions no worldliness he had it all around him but the Holy Spirit had him isolated tucked away in that secret place of his soul glory to God he was being control he said I became a prisoner brother brandham said God want prisoners that mean you can't go where you want to go you can't do what you want to do you can only move as God allow you to move you might have a desire well I want to go here and the Holy Spirit check you and say no glory to God Amen that's the place Saints that's where we belong amen that's where Sons and Daughters of God are their best at now you talking about seeing God in a greater way let us eliminate these worldly distractions and allow the Holy Spirit to have more time amen and you talking about seeing another book of Acts amen God moving in his church having his way flowing freely all right brother M Bri you ain't gave us your title Yet brother but the grace of God Saints I want to deal for a brief moment on resentment resentment what does the word resent mean and I want to say this right off Saints none of us are exempt from this and to a to a large degree I believe each one of us have been have been affected by it you might even be affected by it right now right the word resentment it means a it says it's a complex multi-layered emotion that has been described as a mixture of disappointment disgust or anger now resent the word resent it says it's a feeling of bitterness or anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment at a circumstance action or person so I want to set the tone with uh something from the message here so like I said when we're in our homes living Our Lives there's a lot of things that go on Saints offenses come life life life within life you just come in contact with so much but because you are a child of God Satan is always looking for a way to pull you down bind you up right and his most successful to or other people that's the one that's able to get at you the most right you can have a flat tire you know you'll be oh man I got a flat tire depending on if you're trying to get to work or not you'll get a little upset you know it'll make you a little irritated frustrated or whatever you get over that quick but whenever you have issues with other people those things are able to affect you very deeply yes sir if you feel like you've been done wrong and you maybe you may have been done wrong right but the enemy want to take that and he want to pervert that and take it somewhere that it should not go now he wants you to Harbor hard feelings now toward an individual right notice what the prophet says here now this is how this this this is how important this is is this is how important this is for you and I to remain free from these things he says in the message called the 10 virgins and the 144,000 Jews he said see if you got a resenting audience he said the Holy Spirit won't even reveal the minister has been praying he's been fasting laying before God it goes for the ministry too now the ministry ain't free from this right because Ministry I mean I'm a man and human I'm subject to everything just like everybody else so sometimes the hindrance is in the pits that's right yes things that people have encountered battles that people have encountered and they were severely hurt by certain situations uh that involve other people and they really having gotten over it yet amen and they're still going through the motions amen because they know that they're the ministry or whatever they come up behind the pullit and they try to deliver a message or whatever the case might be right but the Holy Spirit listen now the holy spirit is bound yes sir because that hurt has moved over into a perverted a form amen and now it becomes a root of bitterness you understand what I'm saying because they were done wrong they were talked about they were hurt by somebody all it takes is for one person Saints huh listen to what he says the Holy Spirit won't even reveal he says you got to have something that work that's working together he says they are in one place and in one Accord and then there came a sound from heaven like a mighty rushing wind huh so just by resentment being present within a group and there is a refusal to Humble themselves to God's word to get it right that's one side of it and sometimes they might just be ignorant of what's really dealing with them the Holy Spirit that's that's his breeding grounds right there we come together we smile right we say praise the lord we sing songs together and whatever but there is real healing that needs to take place within the depths of people's hearts there are certain people you can think about and when you think about them the hurt becomes so fresh until you're reliving that moment all over over again amen those are the things we need to go before God with in prayer and say Lord please help me because I'm not over this yet I can tell father I'm still hurt by it why do you think when the Holy Spirit In The Prophet's Ministry when the prayer lines and things was being called glory to God Amen what was happening Saints people had had issues many times that were a c that was caused by things that was way back and the Holy Spirit attract that thing back and pinpoint it and bring it up and in the cases that of things that dealt with human relations and things of that nature he'll call it out this is why you're like this because you had this situation going on what does the Holy Spirit what what does the Holy Spirit do Among Us Saints he Pro he promotes making things right amen when we get into that atmosphere it kind of it it melts us down to that place to where we lose all Pride you understand what I'm saying Pride it brings contention when a person refus I mean listen and even the Bible goes further it says that if if if your brother or your sister have a fault against you meaning you've you you've not done anything wrong so much so but they they actually have something against you God said you lay your gifts down and you go and you make things right with that individual sir yes sir that's how much together God want his body to be amen I don't want no lingering feelings of of of of of of of of of hurt and resentment or whatever to be abiding amongst my family that's why the Bible says if any man have a quarrel against any he said we must forbear one another and forgive one another we went over it last night as we was closing out when you stand praying God said you better forgive cuz if you don't forgive listen as I forgiving you freely God is say I want you to forgive also it don't matter what somebody has done to you or how badly you feel like how badly it's affected you God said I want you to forgive and you know what he does remember now Lord have mercy the prophet walked into that Cafe he saw that prostitute looking woman in there and he was like Lord why does my children have to grow up with people like Adam and Earth and he just came to such a disregard why don't you just wipe such off you want to know how the Holy Spirit cured him of that self righteous critical frame of mind you know how the Holy Spirit healed him of that brought him out of that anointing delivered him cast that devil out you know how he did his Saints he showed him himself he showed him his sins and what he had done can we say praise the Lord and he showed him how he forgave him he saw Christ reaching inside his and writing pardon with his own blood over his sins and then he turned around to brother Bram in that Vision he says now I forgiven you but you want to condemn her right the Bible says and if you see a brother overcoming a fault he said we to go to that individual in the spirit of meekness right and with humility why because it says plainly he says considering yourself so God don't want us to you know that's why we were dealing with that Spirit of a tail Bearer on last night you know they want to dig up faults on people and they want to begin to spread rumors about people amen and listen now they're deceived because they are the main culprit their lives might be riddled with sin but they want to find time to talk about somebody else's life and spread rumors and hurtful things about somebody else's life but one characteristic about a tail Bearer they'll never go tell anything on themselves that's right man they'll talk about somebody else all day long but when it come to them oh the Lord he's delivered me everything is fine with me I'm walking in Perfection sometime yeah by chance you come in contact with a tail Bearer and you see that there're running somebody else down in a way that God now is informing You Is Wrong you might just pause and ask them the question can you tell me a little bit about your faults that'll be the exit to the conversation oh I got to go now I got something on the stove you understand amen God I believe God God has taking the time to free us in our minds and me and brother Jesse was talking you know last night because there was a part that we dealt with where God has called he he he pretty much said he's giving us preventative measures and as I was considering what he said you know and how we talked about it you know when when when when when you take vitamins how many take zinc especially when y'all living in this cold country up here you know before the winter come you want to get your body stacked up with the right nutrients right so when those germs begin to fly right you will have a fortification on the inside that'll kind of help you to be able to resist those germs from amen infiltrating your body and bringing you down into a sickness and that's what God does God gives us the vitamins of his word amen amen that we might be fortified against the germs of that evil World evil spirits when they come God will have you so full with of the right things it'll repair those demons they won't be able to come in and abide something that's already on the inside of you will fight them off praise God okay oh my I want to go back back to numbers Numbers chapter 16 we read it on last night but I want to take it from this particular scripture and make a pivot with it by the grace of God number 16 starting at verse one amen it says now Kora the son of isar the son of kab the son of Levi and Dayan and Abraham the sons of eliab and an the son of P sons of Ruben took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renowned and they gathered themselves together against Moses against Aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation Are Holy every one of them and the Lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord and verse four says and when Moses heard it he fell upon his face so last night we we identified clearly that it was a spirit of tail bearing that was working amongst them they even bring this about but I want you to understand also that resentment was within this as well and again resentment means a feeling of bitterness or anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment at a circumstance action or person right the the devil was successfully able to paint a picture within their minds that Moses had done something wrong and they were annoyed by that right but now notice when this Spirit was able to control them and bring them into this action what was the result of them yielding themselves to this spirit and its ways of thinking it ended their lives on the earth so when it comes to resentment Saints God he's very serious about that and he will allow lives to be taken if need be based upon that now I want to give you an example of this in our day some of you are well aware of this particular account but this is from the message of the voice of the sign is mentioned in several other places brother branon begins to say here about two months ago in my church one Sunday morning there was something Satan doing something to attract the attention of the people he says there was an Englishman there by the name of way he says he lives he says you want his address or we can have you to write he says he sends tapes of the meetings from overseas and the man resented what I said heartily watch this now and I looked down and I seen he says that horrible Spirit upon him so whenever there's resentment now listen the prophet was in the spirit and he looked down at a flesh and blood LED man and he said I could see that horrible Spirit the spirit that brings resentment I can see that horrible Spirit upon him he says I had now the only thing brother brandom said and this is how this Spirit works when it anoints somebody it causes that person to become highly agitated by someone else this brother had real problems he had a heart murmur right he asked brother brandom for an interview brother brandom allows him to have the interview the Lord comes down and discerns the man's situation he tells the man look brother you have a heart murmur now this is God himself revealing you understand the unknown by natural man right and in the presence of the Lord that demon had that brother so possessed until when God was speaking to him out of brother brandom's mouth brother brandham said he resented everything I said he didn't know that he was resenting God he goes on to say he says I had him on a private interview I said Mr way you have a heart trouble he even resented that I said why did you come to me for then he say so about a month after that he went to the doctor and the doctor said the doctor said he had a very bad heart he say so he come to the meeting that morning and something was said he says he's a real hot-headed Englishman now everybody don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know if brother way is elect or not because even though he had this instance amen the Lord dealt with him now and we don't know what happened with his life beyond that point at least I haven't come across it right so just because he had this instant that don't mean me he wasn't elect he just had to go on with the Lord so real change can be brought about in his life right but notice this now he says he's a real hot-headed Englishman you know he resented that he says his wife a Wonder a wonderful nor region woman a nurse he says uh and was sitting there with him the thing he resented is brother brandom talked about complexes and he said brother he said how many in here have dealt with complex Le before I don't know how many people but a number of people raised their hands he say see brother way we all deal with complexes I deal with complexes but because that horrible Spirit was on him it made him resent what brother brandham even said there and he turned to his wife and he said to her I resent that now this is how serious this is Saints not only does it in hinder the move of God in an assembly or in a family and within an individual it can call god listen it watch this and I said something and he resented it right quick you know and when he did he was standing to his feet and they were singing and when he did he turned to his wife and said what he said his head went back his eyes just flipped right straight back his feet turned re his face turned real dark red like that desk there and he fell dead to the floor what caused him to die resentment resentment but because brother brandham had the Holy Ghost remember when Moses was being resented the Bible says he fell down on his face before the Lord amen that brother had it because Christ Christ was in not as the Holy Ghost he didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he was so anointed by the spirit of God until even though they came to him and he was perfectly innocent he went to go and stand in the Gap Lord have mercy brother brandham when when that man fell dead I said now we don't know what the heavenly father is going to do and I said maybe he did it for a purpose I said brother way was resenting said he whispered to me his wife said he whispered to me that he was resenting what you said and I said he ought to have done that he says I said Heavenly Father forgive brother way for his error and I called for his Spirit to return He said brother brandom and there he was alive again standing among us see so God let the man's life be taken because of resentment I want to go to another example here because the Bible lets us know that when Jesus was in his own Hometown the Bible says that they were offended in him and because they were offended in him the Bible says many mighty Works he could not do and you know he's the reveal word so an individual's mind toward the message of the hour cuz many people make complaints how come we don't see God moving like he used to move that we know or in the way that we know he can move or whatever amen could you very well be the problem you're complaining about not seeing God move what is your mind toward the message of the hour what's your mind toward your brother or your sister you could be the very hindrance of the moving of God in your midst can we say praise the Lord Saints amen but I'm I'mma share with you this particular situation here Saints and I'm going end with this by the grace of God there was a service blind bmus blind bmus was the service itself and brother brandham talked about this couple that came inside of the service he says and there was a man and his wife first time they was ever in one of my meetings they were sitting in the audience a lady come in and sat down by the side of them and the and the little lady resented it so notice it was a couple that had come in now this couple had a need they both had illnesses they both needed to be dealt with by God in their bodies but then this little lady came in because it was a packed service she looked for a seat to sit in so she went and found a seat that happened to be by the woman and the man but I guess the woman wanted to have her space this is how this is how the enemy is able to slip in the little foxes come in to spoil the vine Saints I guess the woman wanted to have her space you know she ain't wanted to be too tightly in between maybe she was claustrophobic I don't know but she a't want to be too tightly in between people so when a woman came and took her seat the the prophet said here the woman that was sitting there already she resented the lady she became annoyed by her why she didn't go and sit somewhere else he says the lady was setting close he says cuz she was was was she was in her way and the woman that got annoyed by the woman taking a seat by her she made the woman move back now she had a need and the devil knew she had a need and he was trying trying to block her from receiving the healing that she needed to receive so she got annoyed with the lady and she asked the lady could you move back please and the woman kindly did it because they were in a church service but now the woman that was resenting that Spirit came on the woman that had done no wrong now that's the worst thing we can do when you see when you come in contact with somebody that might be resenting you amen you want to pray and ask God to keep you in the right Spirit sir cuz just in a matter of seconds that Spirit transferred from that woman that it initially anointed and moved upon the woman that had done no wrong but because of how she was addressed by the woman of course if somebody talked to you wrong in in a manner that you know with an attitude how is it going to make you feel any one of us if somebody come to us and in a real mean tone or whatever speak to us in a certain way it'll catch you off guard it'll make you feel in a certain way and the Lord has to help you to catch yourself if not you will get annoyed you will get upset or whatever the situation seemingly is provoking you to do so this woman has done no wrong and this woman is talking to her in this mean way and the B not the Bible but the prophet said she be to resent also now watch this the lady was set in close she was in her way made her move back after a while the little lady made her move back he says and this woman that had to move back she resented the woman resenting her so she got she got to praying the woman that did no wrong that was asked to move back she started praying because obviously the Holy Spirit convicted her heart amen watch this now so she started praying she said Lord I oughtn't to have done that forgive me I didn't mean it isn't that the place we want to be in Saints she couldn't help the initial reaction and feeling that she had but because she had a walk with God Amen the Holy Spirit wouldn't let that Spirit of resenting rest on her that's where you and I want to be at Saints we're going to come in contact with things but Lord help us to be so fortified that the spirit that tries to anoint us won't be able to stay upon us and by doing so because now she had obviously she you know she she probably was praying before she came to the service and she was sensitive she couldn't help the thing that CAU her by surprise but the anointing of God obviously was with her and that's the thing that brought her into check amen now watch because of the anointing that was upon her now just like that evil spirit listen to this Saints just like that evil spirit transferred from the woman that it initially moved upon to the woman had that had done no wrong now the right Spirit the right anointing is going to move from the woman that then begin to go to the Lord in prayer and it's going to transfer to that woman that initially got offended watch this he says and then the lady that was in front the one that told her to move back the lady that was in front of her that told her to move back um that had resented her she turned around and said because now God's presence was there she turned around and said sister I'm sorry you see that praise God she was the initial one that was anointed by that spirit that got annoyed with that woman and made her move back but when this woman allowed herself to be humbled in the presence of God and she begin to pray and ask God for forgiveness God begin to deal with the woman who initiated it and brought her heart right into a place listen because she needed healing the Holy Spirit was trying to block her from receiving her heal when you have resentment in your life you block the move of God in your own life this is going to prove it right here cuz when that woman now was touched by the spirit of God cuz the devil ain't going to make you apologize for nothing right that was the Holy Ghost sister I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that amen listen now and the two the husband and the wife were sick and oh watch this just a little bit after that was done so after the woman prayed and asked God to forgive her then the Holy Spirit touched the woman that was really sick that was the first one to be offended and resenting and told a woman to get back but as soon as she made it right brother brandom says just a little bit after that I seen the angel of the Lord standing over them as soon as the woman was able to be freed from that resenting Spirit the spirit of God was drawn to her because they needed healing but as long as that resented Spirit wasn't there the Holy Ghost stayed away right but it was just waiting for it listen how how much time you think it took for them to make that right a few minutes amen as soon as they made it right all of a sudden the prophet saw the angel of the Lord go and stand right over the woman that had just humbled herself to the word of God Amen that was anointing her to make things right and when that resentment left her now she was open to be a recipient of healing Hallelujah glory to God he says I seen the angel of the Lord standing over them called them by name and healed them both and sent them back to their home so when you got a resenting Spirit upon you it can keep you from natural healing and spiritual healing so how many want to stay free from the spirit Spirit of resentment I need the power of God I need the help of God I need the Holy Spirit to be able to come and rest on me amen Lord let me be so anointed until I'm able to respond to offenses just like this Lord amen you might you know man we human some people are a little quick tempered and things of that nature you know amen you can pray and say Lord help me be help me to be delivered from this I don't want to be quick tempered Lord this thing is trying to get me in trouble the devil is using this against me Lord I need your Holy Spirit I need to be filled with your Holy Spirit Lord that all these things can be flushed out so as we stand together Saints right now search your own Hearts your own lives if there's anything or anyone that has hurt you and has done you wrong and you hadn't been able to get over that for one just understand regardless of how they've done you you are never justified in the sight of God withholding grudges or being bitter towards somebody remember God said L the root of of bitterness springing up defile you the word defile here with a word bitter it means difficult to accept admit or bear proceeding from strong animosity resulting from severe grief anguish or disappointment defile means to lower in character quality or value the pess or Excellency the Excellency of it says to make unclean or unfit for ceremonial use huh when you have a spirit of bitterness a spirit that brings about a a root of bitterness in your heart towards somebody or something you make yourself unusable by the Holy Spirit that's what the devil want he want to hinder the body he want to divide the body he want to have us divided and all kind of anger and all kind of just evil dark Spirits just able to have their way freely among us but the light of God comes down to cast The Darkness out and fill the body with light that's what he's here to do right now so as our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed if you need to forgive anybody if you've been having a difficult time letting a particular situation go no matter how far go it's happened or what have you and and you found yourself uh avoiding people because of how badly they've hurt you or how they've treated you they might be absolutely wrong but you don't have to be a wrong you don't have to be wrong along with them we are Sons and Daughters of God and God has called us to a higher calling amen our attitude is is supposed to reflect that of Heaven it's it's it's supposed to reflect the character of God Amen and he said that we should forebear one another and forgive one another if any have a quarrel against any praise God so ask God for forgiveness for that ask God to help you to overcome that by his grace even right now as we have our heads bowed because we need his presence freely flowing in our lives Heavenly Father forgive us Lord for our sins and our iniquities hely father Lord you've allowed any situation that has arisen in our lives you've allowed those things to happen for our good Lord those are now places in which we can grow from father God

demonstration of your life on the inside of a son and a daughter of God it brings about the same expression glory to God and if any be offended if any if any feel that they've been done wrong by
