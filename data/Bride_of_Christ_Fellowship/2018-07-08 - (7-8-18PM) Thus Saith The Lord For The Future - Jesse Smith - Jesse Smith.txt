we'll do our best here to preach the second message of the month here this will be on the stay at the Lord for today I'm sorry for the future sorry partner best aid the Lord for the future so let's go to John chapter 13 verse 16 John chapter sixteen verse 13 and then maokai later on we will do parts of the video so we'll have to watch the volume again on the TV's remote here so John chapter 16 verse 13 it's good to see the Saints here tonight and nice to have Allison we're just so encouraged you came sister Alice so god bless you good to see you brother bang and the family there god bless them appreciate sister Wendy being here thank you sister John 16:13 so we want to read this scripture and then this kind of tells Jesus tells what the Holy Ghost will do when he comes and so the last part is what we're going to talk about tonight but let's read this I'll read the beginning and that we can all read this last part alone I'm sorry together rather howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak now let's read this together on three one two three and he will show you things to come amen may God as busing the reading of his word you may be seated god bless you so we like to look at this thought here tonight about thus saith the Lord for the future and we'll review just briefly very briefly I want to be mindful of the time last week I think I preached a whole hour I didn't mean to preach that whole hour and okay let me just get it on yeah it's showing the wrong thing there I said I want what it's not what I want to see there so forgive me okay that's what I think we need to do well I guess we have to deal with that I'm not sure what happened here so anyways welcome again nice to have our visitor with us Alice we appreciate her coming back by the grace of the Lord and we like to look at thus saith the Lord for the future last week we looked at the stay at the Lord for today and there was about 79 or 80 some views on that on YouTube so that was nice to see that some people are watching and our job is to scatter as much seed as we can we cannot give the increase God must give the increase but our job is to scatter the seed and so that's how I felt led you know to reintroduce or reap reach these foundational doctrines that someone out there and even in internet land will be able to hear the word of God and be blessed by the truth of God's Word and trust as we saw last week come into a real spiritual relationship with Jesus Christ that's what we want to see happen by the grace of the Lord so let's look at let's all just briefly review last week we looked at thus saith the Lord for today and so we saw how we went through numerous doctrines that people need to honor today according to the say at the Lord we found America's destiny which we'll look at a little more tonight but they need to know that for today that America as a whole will not come back to God America will receive the mark of the beast according to Revelation 14 verse 8 every nation will take the mark of the beast every nation will be deceived so when people try to tell us that America will be revived and come back to God we know that's not going to happen that's wishful thinking but that's not going to happen according to the Bible in Revelation 14 8 also it was thus saith the Lord that we must dress in modest apparel because those who dress immodestly will answer the day of judgment for seducing others and causing them to lust that's according to 1st Timothy 2:9 and also Matthew chapter 5 where Jesus said if you if a man looks upon a woman and lust he's already committed adultery in his heart with her so they're both in it together if she presents herself immorally and he thinks immoral thoughts they're both guilty and so that's thus saith the Lord that's the Word of God hair length we know that women should have long uncut hair as long as God will let them grow it out God's not looking for a certain length like 12 inches or 24 inches he's not looking for that he's looking just for long uncut hair and for men he's looking for men to cut their hair and look like a man if he grows it long it's a shame unto God and so we must honor God as long hair long uncut uncut hair represents that a woman is under full submission to her head which is her husband and then her husband's under the headship of Jesus Christ and Christ is under the headship of God we know Christ and then God also we know the Bible says only men should preach the gospel and that's according to 1st Timothy 2:12 that's thus saith the Lord for today so we're grateful to know that also we know it's thus saith the Lord that we need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to acts 2:38 and acts 19:5 also we saw the identity of the mother harlot which was the Roman Catholic Church and the daughter so any denominational Church or non-denominational Church that holds the same doctrines as the Roman Catholic Church and denies the Word of God would be the daughters of the mother harlot and will thus be judged and that's a very serious topic very personal topic but it's thus saith the Lord so we don't argue with that we don't get upset with that we just accept it and then we do what we must do to get in a real church or church that preaches the truth of God amen and we also looked at the mark of the beast last week and we saw that it is joining into this world religious system that will ultimately control finances and everything about the lives of people on the earth so it's going to be a religious Union or organization okay so let's look at the Scriptures for tonight by God's grace so thus saith the Lord for the future so God has told us a lot about the future and let's look at this here I believe and I made a video on this you can watch the whole video I think it's like 15 minutes but God has told us about the advances in science that are going to happen especially with driverless cars God has told us in fact God's prophet brother RAM told us this will be this is the part of the vision that was the head of it or this was the very height of technology in other words brother Branham saw driverless cars on beautiful highways so that's that's the very height of the advances in science so that's what we know we're looking for that mark of the beast will seem a little more about that America will take the mark of the beast we'll look at the Destiny of the United States again we'll see more about that we'll look at the Destiny of Rome and Vatican we have prophecy about that and then we have prophecy for the reassurance for true Christians so we have all these prophecies that we'll watch and we'll listen to brother Branham God's prophet speak them with us say at the Lord so I believe now I'll probably switch over here and we'll begin watching about the driverless cars but if you have your Bible you can go to Daniel 12:4 and we see this as kind of an indirect prophecy of what we're going to hear brother Branham say where the Bible says knowledge will be increased the Bible says the end times will have an increasing of knowledge we see it with the internet we see it with all the technology and the Prophet foresaw that the very height of this technology would be cars that drive themselves so daniel chapter 12 verse 4 and I'm gonna read it like I said because the live streamers can't read it or can't hear it if you read it so I'm gonna read it I like when you read it but I'm doing it for the live streamers but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased okay so we see an increasing of knowledge and we see men and women I'm sorry we see many people running to and fro and so we get an idea that this is through transportation and travel so let me in a a switch over this video here so we can watch and listen to brother Branham as he preaches it okay good so the volume is pretty good okay so I'm skipping ahead to one minute and 45 seconds okay so here we go and this will start talking about driverless cars what brother Ram said to the authoritative phrases thus saith the Lord and in the name of the Lord just as the Bible teaches in James 5 10 and judges 6 8 we begin with advances in science driverless cars in 1958 William Branham shared and recorded a prophecy he originally spoke back in 1933 before the end of the world there would be driverless cars in a type of shape they look like an e the BTCC that will be [Music] we Branum summarize the prophecy about self-driving cars and wrote about this in 1965 the fourth vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the Second World War it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble top car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves an exposition of the seven churches 1965 page 321 without a doubt we can easily see how this prophecy is in the process of coming to pass if you pay attention to the news you will recall that numerous car manufacturers and other companies like Google are putting lots of time and resources into creating driverless cars this prophecy is soon to come to pass all right we'll pause right there okay so we saw the vision brother branham said he said the vision of advances in science was headed up in a driverless car on beautiful highways now a few years ago we saw an article I think it was last year and one of the one of the CEOs of Google I guess there's two guys that started Google one of them said our goal is to have Google cars I'm sorry driverless cars by 2020 so my 16 year old son when he turned 16 in 2020 he doesn't have to drive he can just buy a driverless car so that's his goal we know his goals in two more years to have it on the roads and I don't know if you saw this year though but a goober car that was driverless crashing and it hit a person because the gentleman wasn't paying attention so there may be some delay in that but I'm just letting you know it seems like science is really advancing trying to get this to come to pass and a prophet of God saw that this was the very height of technology and there we have a couple quotes or brother branham says we have the technology we're just rating weighting on the road system so we all see it when we drive around talk about all the time wow these are beautiful highways or the highways are just getting better and better so we know it has to happen the United States we need better highways the technology's not quite there but it's getting there and so we believe this this this prophecy rather will come to pass very soon okay so that covers advances in science now let's look at the United States so if you ever Bible go to revelation 16:18 revelation 16:18 because you're gonna hear a prophecy about the United States brother branham prophesied that Los Angeles was fall into the ocean after an earthquake and he said thus saith the Lord so let's see where that is in the scripture revelation 16:18 so after the seventh vial if you read verse 17 in Revelation 1617 the seventh vial of course is the very last of the vials but in verse 18 it says and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great okay so there was going to be a great earthquake that's never happened before it's gonna have such an effect that the great city in verse 19 divided into three parts and the cities of the nation's fell right to her it is my and great Babylon came in remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath so there is coming a great earthquake and not just one nation or not just one city but numerous cities other nations are all going to be destroyed at this earthquake alright next go to Revelation 13 now we don't have time but revelation 13 verses 11 to 18 is prophecy about the United States which we'll see next revelation 13 11 through 18 and brother Bram tells us this is thus saith the Lord so verses 1 through 10 are about pagan Rome okay and then verses 11 through 18 is about papal Rome in the United States so that's what these scriptures are about now let's go down to verse 16 though and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell save that he had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here his wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six so based upon these scriptures we will see that William Branham prophesies about the United States and it's not very positive in fact it's all negative there's really no hope for the u.s. other than individuals inside this nation who want to accept Jesus Christ amen so let's look at this here I believe it at the right spot here yeah 419 yeah I apologize for all that dramatic music I just kind of put that on there to kind of make people pay attention you know sometimes music can have an effect but it's super dramatic and I'm not really that dramatic but but I did it for the effect to try to catch the attention of people as a nation but individuals must seek God for His grace and mercy in this hour in order to be saved from destruction we begin with a quick summary of the prophecies related to the United States Los Angeles will be judged and will sink into the ocean America we're seeing the mark of the beast a powerful woman perhaps a politician or the Catholic Church will rule the United States before the antenna because of all the sins our country has allowed the God America claims to serve will destroy her America as a whole has turned down the Holy Ghost revival and will never come back to God the United States will come into a persecution like pagan Rome ishi in the fourth and fifth centuries a terrible explosion will come to America and caused craters and debris let's listen now as God's prophet William Branham speaks in the name of the Lord about each prophecy now that's okay there's a lot of prophecies about the u.s. as you can see if it's okay let's listen to them so you can hear them and remember these all come from the scriptures we read revelation 13 and then also revelation 16:18 they all come from there Hollywood will be welded by sender or it'll be the plastic surgeon or a grateful nation about it will be one before hey you take that whatever you wish what we need is down with the author on there this America has become too and what did she do a card revision she elected the wrong person no how long we were taking to run out will be some days thus saith the Lord well she'll never come back again she's gone right in 1965 william branham wrote about a vision he saw of the united states the last and seventh vision was where an i heard a most terrible explosion as i turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America amen alright so Bray understand that by God's grace oh my now we see all the prophecy is negative right about the nation but there is grace for all of us who will come down to the altar right whether you hopefully you've done it already if not you need to get down the altar and get saved amen get filled with the Holy Ghost but if not I'm sorry but for those who love God they will be kept from this destruction and we have two scriptures to back it up revelation 3:10 if you have a Bible you go to Revelation 3:10 revelation 3:10 Jesus gives us a promise a red-letter promise from his precious mouth that if we keep the Word of God he will keep us from destruction revelation 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which will come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth and the church said and this is of course revelation this is speaking of when the mark of the beast is being laid down all right now next just so you know that last statement about America having fire and craters that's from second Peter 3 so we can go there verse 7 second Peter 3 7 because the Bible says 2nd Peter 3:7 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men so there's the but the Bible says right there it could come as it'll come as atomic bombs it'll come as volcanic fire all this destruction brother Branham saw America being destroyed with fire debris craters and the Bible says this is what God is gonna do to pour out judgment upon ungodly men so we must be godly in this hour amen and we will as he'll keep us from the hour temptation if we live godly amen what a beautiful promise of the Lord okay now next we'll look at the mark of the beast we looked at this a little bit last week so let's look at it again now the scripture want to go to is back to revelation 13:16 and I'll take a moment after watch the video I'll take a moment to show you what the number of the beast will be so let's go back though to revelation 13:16 now I don't have this quote up here but brother Branham said the Holy Spirit told him to pick up his pen and write and brother branham said according to revelation three I'm sorry thirteen sixteen he says I believe that the denominations will keep the bride from preaching to the elect of God so the Holy Spirit told brother Branham that in America the government is gonna keep the bride from preaching the true Word of God so we know that is something future if we live long enough and this persecution happens in our day they're gonna close down churches like ours because that's what the Holy Spirit said now you can see it already in the government it's getting so divided between Republican Democrat and Democrats are saying oh you shouldn't serve Republicans in the restaurants and then you know the president before he got president he was saying you should beat people up if they don't agree with you you know I don't know what he says now but I know he said that in his campaigns because I saw it that's not godly that's that's so you can you can in other words you can see the hostility on both sides well at some point they're gonna turn that hostility towards the true believer you can already see it now building up they already don't like each other but the somehow the Beast will cause them to unite and though unite against real spirit-filled Christians and all that hostility will be brought upon us or whoever's left of us you know should the Lord tarry and they will stop us from preaching the true Word of God according to that verse revelation 13:16 okay so let's watch this the mark of the beast and then we'll prove to you what the what the number of the beast is we'll prove his number 666 religion and Christian denominations will take the mark of the beast [Applause] [Music] you can are they will they going to you yes the Medes and Persians in the Book of Daniel took over after Babylon fell so these two are undisputable by the Bible if you follow history though you'll see the next ruler after the Medes them Persians was the Greek Empire and we can prove this I prove this by its I the roll o pyar took over which of course rule in the days of Jesus but then at the bottom the feet were divided of iron and clay and this is where we are today where Rome is ruling through Catholicism which is iron and clay which is Protestantism so that's how that's how is at the end time so we know in our time right where we are we're we're living in a time where Catholicism and Protestantism is ruling the world through politics right through their influence especially the Catholic Church the Roman Catholic Church so we know and Jesus said this has to stand until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled in Luke chapter 21 so this image that Nebuchadnezzar saw Daniel interpreted it and we know Rome is gonna rule to the end time now let me show you how the number of the beast is 666 and how it refers to the Pope of Rome okay so the number of his name the number of the beast is the number of a man the Pope one of the titles of the Pope is vicarious Phil I I don't know if I'm saying the rightful a Philly is it Philly okay Vic Harris Philly day I know it's a day Agnes day I know that so and that means Vicar to the children of God in other words the leader the person who's in the place of God to God's children and you can prove it right here so the number is 666 and the title the Pope is vicarious Philly was it Philly that's right Philly day and that's in where we are right now in our Bibles revelation 13:16 so you can see from this if you take the Roman numerals for this lat Latin word if you take the Roman numerals and the values you add them all up you get to 666 okay so there's one there's one view of it and it shows how one I'm sorry I equals one V equals five x equals ten l equals 50 C equals 100 D equals 500 and M equals 1,000 okay so here's another another visual here's vicarious philly day just another visual it must be noted that in romans i'm sorry that the romans wrote the U as a V sobic Arius will actually be the same amount as a V over here and thus when you add that up then you can get the value of 666 that's the number of his name okay also this is another it's a little more clear did you see how you how you added up it's just a little better visual there you can see how it adds up to 666 now this is easy to calculate church I went on Google and I went to Google and I said translation from Latin to English and I did vicarious which means vicar Philly which means children and day which means God so in other words and then if you type in the whole thing Vic eres Philly day it's the it means the Vicar the vicars I'm sorry Vicar of gods so other mean in other words they're saying the Pope is the in the place of the Son of God they're saying the PO takes Jesus place and church he doesn't he doesn't because he teaches false doctrine he calls himself Holy Father and Jesus called said there's only one holy father and that's the Heavenly Father he takes on the name of God and he blasphemes the name of God by doing that encouraging people and remember the Pope said if if you don't believe Mary as your mother the Pope said you're an orphan and I'll have you to know I'm not an orphan because God is my Heavenly Father my father is alive and well tonight by God's grace I'm not an orphan I'm bought with the price I'm the purchased property of my father the Lord Jesus cry okay so that should be pretty simple to see that that's the number of his name okay so here's where we are all right so we didn't mark of the beast' correct we didn't mark of the beast so now we're at the next part which will be Rome and Vatican ok the Roman Vatican and for your scripture let's go to Revelation chapter 18 Revelation chapter 18 18 verse 10 Revelation 18 verse 10 the Bible says Mystery Babylon will be destroyed in one hour and brother friend tells us to destroy this the Vatican City in one hour he says it'll and he says thus saith the Lord so the prophet tells us revelation 18 drum on and again and that's hard to say and I have friends at her Catholic I nice people sweet people we're not against any people were just again in the Spear organization which teaches people to not honor the Word of God alright so let's watch this here as we look at Rome and the Vatican here should start with okay so we never watch that do we ever watch that do we watch the mark of the beast okay so let's watch that and I think it'll just flow right into Rome in the Vatican yeah yeah we watch that for some reason I went back okay so I'm sorry it's at 10:50 so let me just get ahead here sorry about that church my father sees the mark of the beast Rome in the Vatican now it's profit for told us that world will rule the world not look how there's these statues you know they worship these statues you know it's a it's a place of idolatry ultry it's the mother of all denied enamel because the denomination limits the word of God a denomination says this is all the truth there can be nothing else but when that happens God moves on from those people because they reject the rest of the revelation of the Holy Spirit but you can just see the idolatry right there [Music] [Music] [Music] therefore we should fight Romanism it's spiritual influence and not necessarily the country gods pop hope everybody catches that we're not saying we should fight a war we should fight with prayer right with prayer to call people out of that denominational system so Bram says fight Romanism he doesn't mean go get in a fistfight with somebody or try to knock them out or start a war he's saying pray and battle spiritually put on the full armor of God right you soldiers and pray and ask God to bring people out of that denomination I just want to make sure that's clear okay so everybody see that so that's revelation 1810 standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas I'm sorry that great city Babylon that mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment scum so I'm gonna take one after all the thousands of years where she's tormented the church God's gonna take care of her in one hour God's gonna pour out his wrath and judgement oh my lord have mercy so we've been told a prophet tells us who's gonna destroy one hour it's gonna be Russia okay now lastly reassurance for true Christians so go to first Thessalonians 5:9 and you'll see the reassurance for true Christians first Thessalonians 5:9 now of course we don't have time to read all this - but if you read chapter 4 first Thessalonians you'll read about the rapture and if you read chapter 5 it talks about how God is going to deliver his people from the tribulation because in first Thessalonians 5:2 the Bible says the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night no one's going to know when this rapture is gonna come jesus said no man knows the day or the hour and then in verse three for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape if we go down to verse 8 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation now here's verse 9 I sought to make you rejoice for God hath not appointed us unto wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen this is the context is the rapture and then the tribulation and Paul says we were not ordained to wrath but we're obtained were ordained to salvation which means deliverance through our Lord Jesus Christ amen okay so here brother branham gives us some reassurance that we will not go through the tribulation we will end this video by sharing the good news for the true believer in Jesus Christ Jesus will first-night his bride and then keep his bride or Holy Ghost filled Church away from any doom that comes upon the United States [Music] all right so buddy hear that before God would break down any denominational barriers as any barriers we have with other churches let's say or any other Christians anyone who's a true member of the Bride of Christ God will break down all the barriers and will be united as one true church one true bride so see the world is doing a false unity there United around sin but we are united by the blood of Jesus Christ and the Word of God amen and it's not just our idea it's thus saith the Lord any barriers we have with any believer will come down we'll be united in Christ now be careful with this quote brother brother Bram's says the bride will be gone before any Russian soldiers invade now I don't know that Russian soldiers are gonna invade or not but I just want to prepare you I don't think that part was thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord par is that the bride of be gone before any invasion would happen but we don't know if it's going to be Russia we don't know who it's gonna be I imagine we got to be careful not to that's what I'm trying to say let's not add to the prophecy [Music] [Music] [Music] notice that brother branham never said in Russia would invade with us say the Lord but only that the bride would be gone in the rapture before any invasion would take place all the satanic aahs will be inland in 64 the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that is what Joel chapter 2 verses 23 through 26 says thank you for taking time and watch this video thanks thank thank all of you for watching this video as well amen now I want to tell you Church where all those came from one time a few years ago I I just really stirred up by they believe the sign and stuff and I said well I want to see every every prophesy brother Branham said I don't want to see I don't want to prove he's a prophet so I went through over 3,000 almost 4,000 quotes of thus saith the Lord or in the name of the Lord and then I found every quote that pertained off the ones that were pertain to us okay I save that and then I made this video so that was the video based upon all the future prophecy that I could see that relates to us now there's more of course like you know the move is the on the bride the stay at the lower orders like that but the ones for the future that we can clearly see this is gonna happen that's gonna happen I tried to put those all in this video and I hope that was a blessing by God's grace so that's where I got all that I went and studied you know it took it took me a month or so to get through all those 3,000 or 4,000 quotes and this is what I can see God has showed us cuz remember when the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide us into all truth and he will show us things to come all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna end on time tonight so give me a few minutes here I'll be done in about five minutes so very thankful for that by God's grace I hope somebody here is being blessed and I hope someone out there is hearing the Word of God and rejoice and God's promises and also taking warning because some of these are warning prophecies a lot of them are because there's a lot of destruction we know that's to come upon the earth okay so I'm gonna just kind of repeat this again from last week what does this mean for you and I first we need to pray listen to the sermons and seek God to decide if this man was a true prophet or not I don't know about you but every time I showed you a prophecy I showed you in the Bible where it was so these are not just made-up prophecies this is a true prophet of God who is telling what's already written in the Word of God he's not adding to it like the Mormons add to it they have a whole separate book added to the Bible but here God has just sent us a true prophet that's just office those things in the Word of God [Music] what's gonna happen amen Sikhs you'll find that the word prophet of God we've been explaining at the last watch last Sunday okay next again pray listen to sermons ask God help you to live the original faith the Apostles because we just saw in Joel chapter 2 God's taking us right back to there then we have on our video like I said on our website over 50 he teaching videos we just uploaded one this week I think it was revelation chapter 12 we just uploaded if I can do it this week I want to make the next video on jewelry tattoos in the Bible and you'll see there are certain kinds of jewelry the Bible says we can work there's other kinds that we can't wear and of course tattoos you know God will forgive you if you do but God never wants us to right and Mark permanently on our body that's a perversion because God wants to write his word upon your heart and that's called the mark or the seal of the Holy Ghost that's just a perversion okay and then lastly as we said last week pray ask God to help you find a church that preaches the message of the hour and we're not proselyting but we are calling people out of the mother harlot and all of her daughters all the denominations or all the non denominator nomination was that hold denominational doctrine that doubt all the thus saith the Lord God has given to us they doubt
