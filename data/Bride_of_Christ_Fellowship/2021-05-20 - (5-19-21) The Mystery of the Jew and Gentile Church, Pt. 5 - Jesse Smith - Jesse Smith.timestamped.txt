[37:54] we ask that the holy spirit will have

[37:57] and the saint said amen god bless you as
[38:00] you're being seated praise god
[38:07] all right i'm going to try to preach 45
[38:08] minutes we'll see how that goes tonight
[38:09] here
[38:10] now if you would uh let's go back to
[38:12] romans 2 16 can you put that up there
[38:15] i just kind of want to end or i'm sorry
[38:16] start where i kind of left off
[38:19] last week so romans 2
[38:22] 16 we kind of left off with this thought
[38:25] about
[38:26] paul's gospel as the judgment standard
[38:31] and i think uh i think i want to read
[38:34] this
[38:35] scripture one more time and i want to
[38:36] look at a few
[38:38] uh scriptures i had yeah
[38:49] yeah okay there's yeah i was looking for
[38:50] revelation 21 okay
[38:52] and that day when god shall judge the
[38:54] secrets of men by jesus christ
[38:56] according to my gospel just leave that
[38:58] up there just a moment uh so we ended uh
[39:00] last wednesday by by recognizing that
[39:03] all
[39:04] secrets of men are going uh to be judged
[39:07] by
[39:08] jesus christ according to
[39:11] paul's apostle i'm sorry paul's epistles
[39:13] rather sorry the apostle paul
[39:15] his epistles every secret now church
[39:19] you know as i was driving to church here
[39:20] i just had this thought uh you know in
[39:22] revelation 21
[39:23] 8 you know you can pull that up there if
[39:25] you'd like uh
[39:29] verse 7 revelation 21 verse 7 says he
[39:31] that overcomes inherits all things
[39:34] and i will be his god and he shall be my
[39:36] son
[39:37] so i'm sorry 21 21 yeah thank you
[39:41] so we must overcome right we sing about
[39:44] it tonight we overcome by the blood of
[39:45] the lamb
[39:46] and the word of his testimony now if you
[39:48] look at the next scripture
[39:49] here's what the blood of jesus christ is
[39:51] supposed to help us overcome
[39:54] right verse eight the fearful so the
[39:57] blood of jesus christ
[39:58] gives us victory over fear the blood of
[40:01] jesus christ gives us victory over
[40:03] unbelief
[40:05] right so some of us are gonna have to
[40:06] overcome fear some of us are gonna have
[40:08] to overcome unbelief
[40:10] right abominable abominations right
[40:14] some of us are going to overcome
[40:15] abominations temptations
[40:18] that were abominable uh seemed
[40:21] tempting to us but we had to overcome it
[40:23] by the blood of the lamb
[40:25] praise god in other words we had to seek
[40:26] jesus for forgiveness
[40:29] for any sins related to these right and
[40:32] that
[40:32] and now but think about this also
[40:34] sorcerers okay so we
[40:35] we understand that sorcerers you know
[40:38] witchcraft workers
[40:39] idolaters that's what i think a lot of
[40:41] brother branham worshipers are going to
[40:43] be guilty of that
[40:44] i believe many of them will i'm sure
[40:46] many of them will be lost
[40:47] if they don't repent making brother
[40:50] branham an idol
[40:51] right i was listening to it this week
[40:52] and i was remembering uh uh
[40:54] that that uh and i think i was actually
[40:57] i was listening to last week's sermon
[40:59] and that revelation kind of struck me uh
[41:01] that
[41:02] people that follow brother branham
[41:04] worship or exalt him above
[41:06] paul because they can admit paul had
[41:08] opinions and not every word paul said
[41:09] was thus saith the lord
[41:11] but every word brother branham says they
[41:12] say is thus saith the lord
[41:14] they've exalted brother branham above
[41:16] paul and to equal state of jesus
[41:19] right but what did what did john the
[41:20] baptist say i must decrease
[41:23] he must increase amen they all they so
[41:26] forget about these other scriptures
[41:27] right they get so caught up on certain
[41:29] scriptures
[41:30] but church there'll be a lot of people
[41:31] around the message that are lost
[41:33] because of idolatry they worshipped a
[41:36] man
[41:37] rather than worshiping god almighty
[41:41] now liars
[41:44] people that they wouldn't tell the truth
[41:46] and this lie
[41:47] kept them from being saved right it
[41:50] wouldn't let them receive repentance and
[41:52] justification because of lies
[41:56] now let's just stop there for a moment
[41:57] keep that up there remember church
[41:59] remember
[41:59] some of these are going to be secrets
[42:02] right that we don't find out to the
[42:04] white throne judgment
[42:05] people we thought around the message
[42:07] were doing pretty good or were really
[42:09] good
[42:09] they seem to have a really sound
[42:10] testimony remember that judas hung
[42:12] around for three and a half years and
[42:14] nobody detected him except jesus
[42:17] right so some of these people we're
[42:19] going to meet at the white throne we're
[42:21] going to see them missing
[42:22] in the millennium right we're going to
[42:23] see them missing at the rapture
[42:25] they'll be missing in the millennium and
[42:27] the secrets of their hearts they didn't
[42:30] confess their fear right they didn't
[42:32] confess their unbelief they didn't
[42:34] confess their abominable sins
[42:36] like i've had a brother who keeps uh
[42:40] doesn't live around in this nation but i
[42:42] have a brother who keeps emailing me
[42:43] from overseas
[42:44] and he battles homosexuality and i keep
[42:45] praying for him there's actually a
[42:46] couple of brothers that do that
[42:47] they say pray for me brother jesse i
[42:49] forgot to pray for him tonight i need to
[42:50] do that
[42:51] but the email sits in my inbox and i've
[42:53] got to pray for them
[42:54] now i like that now i like that they're
[42:56] reaching out for prayer
[42:58] because if it's kept secret and it's not
[43:00] confessed
[43:01] they'll be guilty of it but i like a
[43:04] repentant heart not that you have to
[43:05] tell people all your deep dark secrets
[43:07] but you got to seek jesus christ you
[43:09] have to seek his blood and seek his
[43:11] forgiveness
[43:12] that god will deliver you from our
[43:14] secrets right
[43:15] we must have deliverance from our secret
[43:18] sins kind of like that scripture we read
[43:20] that ties in real good with our memory
[43:21] verse keep me from those presumptuous
[43:24] sins right from those
[43:25] really evil ones and this is what and
[43:28] see hormones people that
[43:29] had now let's think about some of our
[43:30] presence like jfk think about all the
[43:32] whoremongering he did
[43:34] they tried to keep it for a secret but
[43:35] it's come out now let's
[43:37] see church we can't hide anything right
[43:40] anything that was a lie think about all
[43:42] the lies that people have had
[43:44] uh they're all gonna be exposed either
[43:47] now or later
[43:49] see so the thing to do is the blood of
[43:51] jesus christ will urge you to come clean
[43:53] and
[43:54] and go through the humiliation now or
[43:56] the shame now
[43:57] and recognize that that we must confess
[44:00] and that jesus actually paid for your
[44:02] shame jesus took your guilt
[44:04] jesus took your shape he paid for it on
[44:06] the cross and he makes
[44:08] you the forgiven one praise god but
[44:10] these are the ones that won't accept it
[44:12] they're going to hide their secrets but
[44:15] paul's gospel came
[44:16] that we could confess all of these
[44:18] personal
[44:19] secret sins and live with a clear
[44:22] conscience amen
[44:23] i'm glad church said that we can come to
[44:25] the house of god and we can really sing
[44:27] we can really praise god we can really
[44:29] have joy in the house of the lord
[44:30] because everything's been confessed amen
[44:33] there's no secrets that we're trying to
[44:34] hide or
[44:35] try to keep people away from looking at
[44:37] our phone or keep people out of this
[44:39] area of our life or something like that
[44:40] you know we all have sins but we're
[44:42] trying to overcome our little
[44:44] mistakes that we make our sins that we
[44:45] make but i'm talking about big things
[44:48] that keep people from being saved
[44:50] we ought to have the helmet of salvation
[44:52] on we ought to know that we're saved and
[44:53] not let anybody talk us out of that
[44:55] praise god because we've gone to the
[44:57] word we've gone to this bible
[44:59] and we said lord i want you to take away
[45:01] my sins now
[45:02] forgive me of my sins i want to overcome
[45:05] these things amen
[45:06] i want to be an overcomer i don't want
[45:08] to be overcome
[45:10] i don't want to be a victim i want to be
[45:12] a victor praise god
[45:13] i want to be an overcomer praise god i
[45:15] don't want to be a complainer i want to
[45:17] be a conqueror amen
[45:20] hallelujah we've got the overcomers here
[45:22] tonight amen we've got any conquerors
[45:24] we've got any victors here tonight amen
[45:27] victors not we're not victims but we're
[45:29] victors amen
[45:31] we're more than conquerors in christ
[45:32] jesus these things will not overcome us
[45:35] we'll overcome them amen oh that's a
[45:38] blessing
[45:39] so i just want to go back and remind you
[45:41] that on the white throne judgment
[45:43] all all these secrets are going to be
[45:46] revealed
[45:47] and we're going to stand there and watch
[45:48] them right and the overcomers will judge
[45:51] those
[45:52] who kept these secrets and didn't
[45:54] confess them
[45:55] hallelujah i'm glad we can confess them
[45:57] and as we're always reminded
[45:58] when they're confessed they're thrown in
[46:00] the sea of forgetfulness
[46:01] you never hear from them again amen i
[46:04] think they just totally washed away
[46:06] totally uh drowned out and totally done
[46:09] away with
[46:10] totally uh put out of all memory right
[46:13] totally forgiven that's the blood of
[46:15] jesus amen
[46:16] glory now i want to start looking here
[46:19] paul
[46:20] teaches extensively on the revelation of
[46:23] one church
[46:25] okay there are about six i'm sorry five
[46:28] books of the
[46:28] of his of his of his new testament five
[46:31] books where he
[46:32] he definitely majors on this he labels
[46:35] this a mystery
[46:36] he gives plenty of evidence that the jew
[46:39] and gentile
[46:40] are in one church so let's go to romans
[46:42] 16 if you would romans 16 25 and 26
[46:45] romans 16 25 and 26
[46:51] now i can't wait to preach on this book
[46:54] if the lord tarries and the lord gives
[46:55] me grace to keep preaching
[46:56] i can't wait to preach on the book of
[46:58] romans i'm going to preach all the way
[46:59] through just like i've done
[47:00] galatians ephesians and philippians i
[47:03] this
[47:05] when i looked at romans this summer or
[47:07] last summer i was blown away uh
[47:10] if you haven't read the entire book
[47:11] lately i encourage you to do it chapters
[47:13] one to five
[47:14] show the universal need for jews and
[47:16] gentiles
[47:17] to receive the righteousness of christ
[47:20] that he's graciously offering because
[47:21] we're all sinners we all fall short of
[47:23] the glory of god
[47:24] but then the bible says therefore uh
[47:26] being justified by faith
[47:28] we have peace with god through our lord
[47:30] jesus christ amen
[47:32] the first five chapters deal with how do
[47:34] we get peace with god
[47:35] jew gentile greek right heathens how do
[47:38] we get peace with god
[47:40] through faith in jesus christ now
[47:42] chapters 6
[47:43] 7 and 8 teach how the new man or the
[47:46] spirit-filled believer
[47:48] overcomes sins how he understands the
[47:50] mosaic covenant
[47:51] and walks in the holy spirit praise god
[47:54] because there's no condemnation
[47:56] to that or them that are in christ jesus
[47:58] amen that walk not after the flesh
[48:00] but walk after the spirit is that how
[48:03] you feel church
[48:04] you feel clean going to work every day
[48:06] you feel clean coming to church
[48:07] you feel clean like there's nothing
[48:09] there's nothing hindering me i'm walking
[48:11] in the holy spirit praise god i don't
[48:12] feel any condemnation
[48:14] i don't feel anything is wrong i'm an
[48:15] overcomer i'm freshly washed i freshly
[48:18] wash my garments
[48:19] my garments are clean amen that's how we
[48:22] should feel we should walk in the spirit
[48:24] and we won't fulfill the lusts of the
[48:26] flesh
[48:28] verse i'm sorry chapters 9 through 11
[48:30] show israel's blindness
[48:32] 9 10 and 11 show israel's blindness we
[48:35] preached on that mystery
[48:36] before this mystery that's what verses 9
[48:38] 10 11
[48:39] now chapters 12 13 and 14 15 16
[48:42] uh show the guidelines for christian
[48:45] living
[48:46] okay now paul ends this book look at
[48:49] look how he ends this book
[48:50] what a tremendous ending to the book uh
[48:53] quite
[48:54] uh quite uh simple but look at his
[48:56] ending
[48:57] his last few words he tells the the
[48:59] romans
[49:00] here he says in verse 25 now to him that
[49:04] is a
[49:04] power to establish you that's to to to
[49:08] stabilize you
[49:09] according to my gospel and the preaching
[49:12] of jesus christ
[49:14] according to the revelation of the
[49:16] mystery
[49:18] so see what when you receive a
[49:19] revelation it makes you stable
[49:22] right it makes you stable like here's an
[49:24] example the mystery of israel's
[49:26] blindness
[49:27] here's a recent one how many know
[49:28] they're getting under major fire right
[49:30] now israel
[49:31] from hamas have you seen the iron dome
[49:34] they have a defense system in israel
[49:36] they're so smart over there
[49:37] they got the blessing of god on their
[49:39] lives since they moved back to the land
[49:41] they're so blessed
[49:42] hamas i saw a video they'll shoot
[49:44] hundreds of missiles
[49:46] and israel has the iron dome where they
[49:49] have missiles ready to fire up and
[49:50] it it destroys them in the air hundreds
[49:54] i think they did 400 the other day
[49:55] israel just has all this
[49:57] so when the enemy comes in god raised up
[50:00] a standard against him
[50:02] and they're so they're so smart they're
[50:03] so protected because god has
[50:05] favor upon them right because god
[50:07] promised
[50:08] he said even though even though you
[50:10] forsake me he said i could never forget
[50:12] you
[50:13] israel amen
[50:16] but see without this revelation that god
[50:18] still honors
[50:19] israel people might say and there's a
[50:21] lot of sinners that do
[50:23] a lot of liberals like democrats and
[50:25] even some republicans
[50:26] they say oh you know israel deserves
[50:28] that you know because they're
[50:29] mistreating
[50:30] palestinians and everything like that
[50:32] well i don't know all the details
[50:33] but one thing they should not be
[50:35] attacking god's people right
[50:37] and so see that so someone might agree
[50:40] with striking israel if they don't have
[50:42] the revelation
[50:44] of israel's blindness that god's mercy
[50:47] still goes out to israel
[50:49] does that make sense i hope i made that
[50:51] okay to understand with my
[50:52] uh my primitive uh understanding here or
[50:55] my primitive
[50:56] language right see someone might
[50:59] think it's okay for israel to be bomb
[51:01] but it's not okay
[51:02] it's god's people and when you've got
[51:04] the revelation of that you're more
[51:06] stable towards that that subject right
[51:09] oh i understand
[51:10] and church we should be praying for
[51:11] israel i should have prayed for them
[51:12] tonight i didn't even think of that
[51:13] let me write it down for sunday uh let's
[51:16] pray throughout the week but we have to
[51:17] pray for israel despite all those
[51:19] attacks they're under
[51:20] how many believe god can hear our
[51:21] prayers to protect israel
[51:23] remind me at the end later malachi lydia
[51:25] remind me at the end let's pray for
[51:26] israel
[51:26] i forgot about that but that's just one
[51:29] area
[51:30] when you understand the revelation of
[51:32] the mystery then you will uh
[51:34] you won't condemn israel you'll pray for
[51:36] them you'll pray for peace
[51:38] right and that's what paul says my
[51:41] preaching
[51:42] establishes you oh according to the
[51:45] revelation which was kept secret
[51:47] since the foundation of the world since
[51:49] the world began
[51:50] these were all secrets but now they're
[51:52] revealed verse 26
[51:56] but now is made manifest and by the
[51:58] scriptures the prophets
[52:00] according to the commandment of the
[52:02] everlasting god
[52:03] made known to all nations for what the
[52:06] obedience
[52:07] of the faith what does god want from the
[52:09] united states
[52:11] he wants obedience what does god want
[52:13] from south africa
[52:15] obedience from australia obedience from
[52:18] africa from europe
[52:19] what does god want from all these
[52:21] nations obedience to the faith
[52:23] he wants men and women that obey the
[52:25] word of god they understand it they know
[52:27] it
[52:27] they obey it and they honor him they
[52:29] bring glory to their creator
[52:32] that's what it is he said that's what
[52:33] it's for why was the mystery made
[52:35] manifest
[52:36] so that you and i will obey the gospel
[52:39] praise god
[52:40] amen why are all these revelations why
[52:42] did god have to finish the mystery of
[52:44] god
[52:44] so he would have us to obey the word of
[52:47] god that we might enjoy his blessings
[52:49] we might enjoy his presence now that we
[52:51] might have the overcoming blood now
[52:53] praise god
[52:54] we might experience the blessing of god
[52:56] now that now
[52:58] you'll have christ in you praise god
[53:00] that we won't just always sing oh
[53:02] in the sweet bye and bye things will be
[53:04] you know things will be great then
[53:06] things can be great now
[53:07] when you walk with christ amen right we
[53:10] always sing that song in the sweet bye
[53:14] we shall meet on that beautiful shore
[53:17] that's all right right we are going to
[53:18] do that one day but we should see the
[53:21] blessing of god now
[53:22] we should have a zeal for god now we
[53:24] should enjoy the benefits of serving god
[53:26] right now we should be overcomers now
[53:29] we should be the joshua generation now
[53:31] amen
[53:32] now's our time to overcome so see
[53:36] so part of it we can't put it off we
[53:37] can't put our victories off
[53:39] to the future we should be victorious
[53:41] right now more than conquerors now
[53:43] praise god
[53:44] he said you are the children of god now
[53:46] he said you have the spirit of adoption
[53:48] now
[53:49] i'm not an orphan i'm an adopted son
[53:51] praise god
[53:52] and i've got the benefits of being an
[53:54] adopted son are the rights and
[53:56] privileges and blessings
[53:58] we've seen them we thank god for healing
[53:59] we thank god for salvation
[54:01] we thank god for the baptism of the holy
[54:03] ghost we thank god for a transformed
[54:05] mind amen
[54:07] oh hallelujah thank the lord
[54:12] so what are these what are these great
[54:14] mysteries why do we say the word
[54:15] mysteries and why do we rejoice
[54:17] because they help us obey the word of
[54:19] god
[54:20] right one of the mysteries the mystery
[54:22] of god's will when we obey
[54:24] we get all the benefits of obeying god's
[54:26] will that we can be assured like we said
[54:28] last
[54:29] wednesday we can have an expected end
[54:32] we know when we die we don't have to
[54:34] fear at death at death's door we won't
[54:36] have to fear
[54:37] we know exactly what jesus is going to
[54:39] say well done praise god
[54:41] amen it's an expected end praise god
[54:44] right because we obeyed
[54:45] on this earth we knew the word on this
[54:47] earth and now we have an expected end
[54:49] and can somebody say amen tonight
[54:51] hallelujah that's right we have an
[54:53] expected end church
[54:54] now look at this this is glorious all's
[54:57] god wants is the gentiles to obey the
[55:00] faith
[55:01] that's all he wants does that sound
[55:03] familiar like deuteronomy 29 29 can you
[55:05] pull that out there
[55:06] deuteronomy 29 29
[55:11] it's such an amazing thing that's one
[55:13] thing satan can't do
[55:14] satan can't obey the word of god
[55:17] right he can't obey it he can't keep it
[55:20] but thank god you can amen
[55:22] and not by your power but by the power
[55:24] of god amen
[55:26] thank god see you can do something satan
[55:28] can't satan can't
[55:29] now he can do some things you can't he
[55:31] has power of darkness and the prince and
[55:33] power of the air and
[55:34] he can do some of these things you know
[55:36] just at his own will when god allows it
[55:38] but see satan can do those things but we
[55:40] can do greater things
[55:41] we can obey god we can love god amen
[55:44] and satan can't do that see the secret
[55:47] things belong to the lord our god
[55:49] moses says it right before he dies in
[55:52] deuteronomy 29 but those things which
[55:54] are revealed
[55:55] belong unto us and our children forever
[55:58] that we may do
[55:59] all the words of this law praise god i'm
[56:02] glad i can lay hands on the sick and
[56:04] they recover
[56:05] amen praise god hallelujah i'm glad
[56:08] i can have peace that passes all
[56:10] understanding amen
[56:12] the world can't have that right they
[56:14] have to have drugs to go to sleep
[56:16] at night right they've got to have drugs
[56:18] to wake them up in the morning
[56:19] they've got to have but we have peace
[56:21] that passes all understanding amen
[56:24] we have so many benefits that they can't
[56:26] experience
[56:27] we can actually have forgiveness in our
[56:29] hearts praise god
[56:31] and we can actually forgive our enemies
[56:33] we can actually do good
[56:35] to those who persecute us amen we can
[56:38] have a positive attitude
[56:39] towards those that have sinned against
[56:41] us because we
[56:43] have the love of god and you'll know all
[56:45] the disciples by our love
[56:47] that they have one for another and our
[56:49] love for our enemies as well
[56:50] we can live in a way they can't even
[56:52] dream of praise god
[56:53] because we're overcomers amen because
[56:56] we've obeyed the faith we've obeyed the
[56:58] mysteries praise god we've done the
[57:00] words of the law
[57:01] so we have the power of the law
[57:05] hallelujah
[57:08] i'm trying to think of a more recent
[57:10] example of that remember i had that i
[57:12] told you about that hindu man that came
[57:13] into our service one time years ago when
[57:15] we were at the waterloo and he's like i
[57:16] can't believe you can preach like that
[57:18] he said if i said any of those things my
[57:20] wife would laugh at me i remember that
[57:21] hindu guy
[57:22] so he was amazed at the power that we
[57:25] had as christians
[57:27] we had power to live above so many sins
[57:30] right we have power to not be a slave to
[57:33] our cell phones right we're not a slave
[57:35] to these things
[57:37] now some people have apps that you know
[57:39] block websites and that's a good thing
[57:41] but see if you're born again you've
[57:43] already got the blocker you you got the
[57:44] blocker right here praise god
[57:47] i already got that downloaded from
[57:49] heaven amen now you can add that it'll
[57:51] be good for your kids until they're born
[57:53] again that'll be good
[57:54] but if a grown-up person who says they
[57:56] got the holy ghost
[57:57] has to have something like that to keep
[57:59] them from evil then they don't have the
[58:01] power of god yet praise god
[58:03] because these these temptations are
[58:06] common to all man
[58:07] right every generation has to overcome
[58:09] these things but every generation has
[58:11] had the opportunity
[58:12] to have the power of god inside of them
[58:15] right and to be more than conquerors
[58:17] this power's been been available all
[58:19] these years
[58:20] and god's people always receive it
[58:22] praise god
[58:24] thank god amen we can do the word
[58:27] they can't do the word but we can do it
[58:31] amen praise god
[58:34] we can pray in secret and not brag about
[58:36] it
[58:38] right we can give alms and not tell
[58:40] other people about it
[58:42] right we can give in secret not go brag
[58:44] about it on facebook
[58:47] right we can do that we can pray in
[58:50] secret
[58:50] right we can do alms in secret we can
[58:54] fast and not tell anybody we're fasting
[58:57] right we can do that because we've got
[58:59] the power of god
[59:01] we're not going to be the pharisees and
[59:02] go try to get compliments from at church
[59:04] right
[59:05] or out in public our best prayers should
[59:08] not be in public
[59:09] our best prayers should be in private
[59:12] right because the pharisees love to pray
[59:14] in the marketplace so they love to play
[59:16] pray in the temple to be seen of men
[59:18] jesus said verily they have their reward
[59:21] he said but i'll reward you when you
[59:23] pray in secret when you pray in secret
[59:25] i'll meet you in there
[59:26] and i'll reward you openly see they
[59:29] don't have the revelation of these
[59:30] things
[59:31] and so they don't get the blessings of
[59:33] them but we have the revelation of them
[59:36] praise god so what does god want from
[59:38] this revelation he wants all nations to
[59:40] obey the word of god
[59:42] now would you pull first corinthians 12
[59:44] 13.
[59:59] first corinthians 12 13. here's how both
[1:00:02] jew and gentile
[1:00:03] become a part of the one church for by
[1:00:07] one
[1:00:07] church membership by one
[1:00:10] water baptism no that's not it
[1:00:14] by one tape no
[1:00:17] by one church attendance no
[1:00:21] no by one spirit amen are we all
[1:00:24] baptized into one body praise god see
[1:00:26] each person has to have one
[1:00:29] holy ghost experience praise god where
[1:00:31] god comes and he approves of your life
[1:00:34] and he comes to live inside of you so
[1:00:36] you're no longer living to yourself
[1:00:37] you're living for others amen i like how
[1:00:41] brotherhood says that by one church
[1:00:42] membership
[1:00:43] by one creed by one denomination
[1:00:46] no by one spirit whether we be jews or
[1:00:49] gentiles bond or free
[1:00:50] we've all been made to drink into one
[1:00:53] spirit praise god so see
[1:00:55] one baptism of the holy ghost experience
[1:00:58] gives you
[1:00:58] all the rights all the benefits all the
[1:01:01] inheritances praise god
[1:01:03] amen now that's the main those are two
[1:01:05] main scriptures right there we're going
[1:01:07] to do five
[1:01:08] romans 16 first corinthians 12 go to
[1:01:10] galatians 3 hun galatians 3.
[1:01:15] now remember galatians 3 is a basically
[1:01:18] an explanation of genesis 12
[1:01:21] 3. so i'm going to you leave that up
[1:01:23] galatians 3.
[1:01:24] go to galatians 3 7 hun i'm going to
[1:01:26] turn up uh i'm sorry i'm going to pull
[1:01:27] up genesis 12
[1:01:28] 3. i don't want you to forget this paul
[1:01:31] takes almost a whole chapter
[1:01:33] to explain what genesis 12 3 meant for
[1:01:36] abraham
[1:01:37] okay let me read genesis 12 3 leave that
[1:01:39] up there uh it says
[1:01:40] and i will bless them that bless thee
[1:01:42] and curse him that curses thee
[1:01:44] and in thee shall all families of the
[1:01:46] earth be blessed
[1:01:48] okay that's a simple scripture we read
[1:01:49] it heard it many times
[1:01:51] but paul paul gives us the divine
[1:01:53] interpretation of this scripture
[1:01:55] this doesn't just mean jews right it
[1:01:57] just doesn't mean
[1:01:58] hebrews that will come out of abraham
[1:02:01] right
[1:02:02] this means all the families of the earth
[1:02:05] will be blessed
[1:02:07] okay so this is in chapter uh
[1:02:10] 3 of galatians paul now quotes this
[1:02:14] and it's amazing to see how much god
[1:02:18] put into this one verse in genesis 3.
[1:02:21] i'm sorry genesis 12 3 rather genesis 12
[1:02:23] 3. now i want you to see
[1:02:25] church anyone with faith in jesus christ
[1:02:28] is of the seed of abraham
[1:02:30] praise god look at verse seven now let's
[1:02:33] i'm sorry let's read verse seven
[1:02:34] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:02:36] faith
[1:02:37] the same are the children of abraham how
[1:02:39] many are of faith
[1:02:41] are you of faith are you of unbelief
[1:02:45] i'm a faith i'm a faith child
[1:02:48] got any faith children here tonight i'm
[1:02:50] a child of faith i'm
[1:02:52] i'm a person of faith that means i don't
[1:02:55] act
[1:02:56] by what i see i act by what i believe
[1:02:59] amen i'm a child of faith praise god
[1:03:04] i didn't feel like coming to church
[1:03:05] tonight i was actually sleeping on the
[1:03:06] couch because i was kind of tired i took
[1:03:08] a little nap before church
[1:03:09] that's probably one reason we were kind
[1:03:10] of late i i didn't really feel like
[1:03:12] coming
[1:03:12] but i don't go based upon my feelings
[1:03:14] because now i feel pretty good amen
[1:03:16] i go by faith what god promises and god
[1:03:19] said if you assemble together more
[1:03:21] i'll meet you there praise god amen i
[1:03:24] don't live by
[1:03:25] what i see i live by faith i'm a child
[1:03:28] of faith amen
[1:03:30] hallelujah like when we spoken about
[1:03:33] your dad
[1:03:33] we just spoke to that mountain i didn't
[1:03:35] speak by what i saw it looked awful to
[1:03:37] what i saw
[1:03:38] or heard but i spoke by faith because
[1:03:41] i'm a child of faith amen
[1:03:44] hallelujah praise god now go to verse 9
[1:03:47] so then they which be
[1:03:48] of faith are blessed with faithful
[1:03:50] abraham
[1:03:51] four times paul says
[1:03:55] anyone with faith is a seed of abraham
[1:03:58] and if abraham called those things not
[1:04:01] as though they were
[1:04:02] that's what you and i must do as well
[1:04:05] but we must have a promise of god for it
[1:04:07] praise god
[1:04:08] we must have a promise like abraham had
[1:04:10] and quote that promise
[1:04:12] in other words we must have a promise
[1:04:13] that's real to us
[1:04:15] amen what's real to you tonight church
[1:04:16] what promises are real healing is
[1:04:18] healing real to you
[1:04:19] is salvation real to you it's holy ghost
[1:04:22] baptism real to you amen
[1:04:24] it's joy and peace and blessing and and
[1:04:26] all those statues of perfect man all the
[1:04:28] fruits of the spirit
[1:04:29] those should be real to you how about
[1:04:31] investing in your talents is that real
[1:04:33] to you
[1:04:34] all these blessings must be real to us
[1:04:37] just like they were real to abraham
[1:04:39] amen i'll say like this thank god a body
[1:04:42] change was real to abraham
[1:04:43] a body change will be real to us as well
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:47] a body change to bring forth the
[1:04:49] promised son
[1:04:52] verse 26 now go to verse 26. there's
[1:04:54] four verses where paul says if you have
[1:04:56] faith
[1:04:57] you are a child of abraham four is the
[1:04:58] number of deliverance right
[1:05:00] or you could say a double confirmation
[1:05:02] brother brahms tells us that
[1:05:04] for ye are all children of god by faith
[1:05:07] in christ jesus remember faith is
[1:05:09] revelation right
[1:05:10] faith is also assurance our assurance is
[1:05:14] in christ jesus
[1:05:16] and that makes you a child of
[1:05:20] abraham and we're a children we're a
[1:05:23] child of god
[1:05:24] all of us are the children of god by
[1:05:27] faith
[1:05:27] in christ jesus praise god and the last
[1:05:31] one verse 29.
[1:05:38] galatians 3 29
[1:05:41] and if ye be christ i like the if there
[1:05:44] right there's got to be if in other
[1:05:45] words you have to believe you have to
[1:05:46] surrender
[1:05:47] you have to be born again and if you be
[1:05:49] christ
[1:05:50] then ye are abraham's seed and heirs
[1:05:53] according to the promise
[1:05:55] so let me go back there how many seed of
[1:05:56] abraham do we have in here tonight
[1:05:58] well if you're the seed of abraham god
[1:06:00] is going to bless you he said i'm going
[1:06:02] to bless them that bless you
[1:06:04] curse them that curse you praise god
[1:06:07] that's what the bible says and the bible
[1:06:09] says you will be blessed
[1:06:11] and you will be a blessing to other
[1:06:13] people
[1:06:14] praise god that's a promise for your
[1:06:17] life you can you can claim that promise
[1:06:19] when you don't feel blessed you can say
[1:06:21] lord you promised i'd be blessed
[1:06:23] you promised if i had faith in christ
[1:06:26] i'm the seed of abraham
[1:06:27] so lord bless me amen let me see the
[1:06:30] blessings pour out from heaven
[1:06:32] you promise to do it bless me lord i'm
[1:06:35] claiming your promise
[1:06:36] just like abraham he claimed it even
[1:06:38] though he didn't see it lord i don't see
[1:06:40] it but i'm claiming it i'm claiming your
[1:06:42] blessing amen
[1:06:44] hallelujah thank god
[1:06:49] thank god we're into the promises of god
[1:06:52] we are
[1:06:52] part of that spiritual lineage of
[1:06:55] abraham
[1:06:58] so we can say like this with my daddy my
[1:07:01] great great great
[1:07:02] daddy he believed for 25 years and he
[1:07:05] finally got it
[1:07:06] he didn't give up after 24 he didn't
[1:07:08] give up after 20.
[1:07:10] he didn't give up after 15 or he didn't
[1:07:12] give up he kept believing
[1:07:14] until he received it and if my great
[1:07:16] great great daddy can do that i can do
[1:07:17] it too
[1:07:18] because i'm a child of his i'm just like
[1:07:21] him amen
[1:07:23] that's in my family lineage right if he
[1:07:25] did it i can do it too
[1:07:27] praise god we must not forget that
[1:07:29] church that we're brought into this
[1:07:30] family
[1:07:31] remember remember jesus said he said
[1:07:33] some of you will sit down
[1:07:35] with abraham isaac and jacob in the
[1:07:38] kingdom of god
[1:07:39] because i'm the god of the living not of
[1:07:42] the dead amen
[1:07:43] some of us are going to sit down right
[1:07:45] by some of these saints amen why
[1:07:48] because they're our family members amen
[1:07:50] i should be sitting by them because i
[1:07:52] got the same faith they got
[1:07:53] faith in christ amen it's true
[1:07:57] i'm of i have faith in jesus christ i'm
[1:08:00] a son of abraham praise god
[1:08:02] hallelujah i'm just now the son of
[1:08:06] snooki and ruby smith i'm a son of
[1:08:08] abraham
[1:08:09] i'm a son of god i'm joy heirs with
[1:08:12] christ
[1:08:12] amen i'm a joint inheritor with jesus
[1:08:16] christ
[1:08:17] we both inherit the blessings of god the
[1:08:19] father amen
[1:08:21] now i'm going to preach on that sometime
[1:08:23] a joint heir with christ
[1:08:26] i'm a co-inheritor with christ
[1:08:30] so see there are certain blessings that
[1:08:32] christ and you and i
[1:08:34] get just because we're human and we
[1:08:36] overcame
[1:08:37] this uh satan's eden down here praise
[1:08:39] god he overcame satan's enemy
[1:08:41] so did i praise god by his grace and so
[1:08:44] there's certain things we inherit that
[1:08:46] are equal praise god
[1:08:48] joint heirs i'm a joint i join in
[1:08:52] with that inheritance
[1:08:55] i want to study on that more and preach
[1:08:57] on that by god's grace joy heirs with
[1:08:59] christ
[1:09:02] because we're in the same family we're
[1:09:05] both trusting
[1:09:07] we're both trusting in god to get us
[1:09:09] through how many trusting in god the
[1:09:10] father to get you through amen
[1:09:12] trusting in your father tonight to get
[1:09:15] through
[1:09:16] well then you got to pray the same way
[1:09:17] if you're trusting and you've got to
[1:09:18] pray the same way
[1:09:19] lord not my will but thine be done
[1:09:22] that's right so there's four scriptures
[1:09:25] church if you're in christ
[1:09:26] you believe in christ you're you're a
[1:09:29] seed of abraham
[1:09:31] you're a seed and he said all nations
[1:09:34] all nations will be blessed
[1:09:35] see paul takes that one scripture
[1:09:38] genesis 12 3
[1:09:39] and he expounds on it now here's the
[1:09:41] here's the highlight right here
[1:09:43] it's verse uh
[1:09:48] well i didn't write down but genesis 3 i
[1:09:50] have to go look for
[1:09:53] i didn't write it for some reason i
[1:09:54] can't believe i didn't write that down
[1:09:57] okay give me a moment it's right at the
[1:10:00] end of genesis chapter 3
[1:10:01] i'm sorry galatians chapter 3.

[1:10:10] there

[1:10:51] god in their lifetime
[1:10:53] we're all one in christ jesus we're all
[1:10:56] receiving the blessings of god
[1:10:58] through christ jesus now that wasn't the
[1:11:02] scripture though that's a good scripture
[1:11:04] that wasn't the one i was looking for
[1:11:06] here we'll read verse yeah okay we read
[1:11:08] verse 29
[1:11:11] at the blessing of abraham that's what
[1:11:12] i'm looking for lydia do you see the
[1:11:13] blessing of abraham
[1:11:17] in chapter three oh there it is verse 13
[1:11:19] 14. sorry
[1:11:20] go to verse 13 and 14. i i use this
[1:11:23] scripture when we preach on the blessing
[1:11:24] and cursing series
[1:11:26] christ hath redeemed us from the curse
[1:11:28] of the law aren't you glad church no
[1:11:29] curse rests on your life
[1:11:32] because i'm redeemed from the curse i
[1:11:33] don't have any curses because i'm
[1:11:35] redeemed from the curse
[1:11:36] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:11:38] written cursing is everyone that hangeth
[1:11:40] on the tree
[1:11:40] here it is that the blessing of abraham
[1:11:42] might come on the gentiles through
[1:11:44] christ jesus
[1:11:45] that we might receive the promise of the
[1:11:47] spirit
[1:11:48] through faith amen what is that
[1:11:51] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:53] what is the blessing of abraham
[1:11:55] the baptism of the holy ghost christ
[1:11:57] living in you
[1:11:58] the messiah taking up abode in you his
[1:12:01] permanent residence
[1:12:03] to live with you inside of you all the
[1:12:05] days of your life
[1:12:06] and all throughout eternity the spirit
[1:12:08] of god constantly dwelling
[1:12:10] constantly moving constantly guiding you
[1:12:12] into all truth
[1:12:14] oh thank the lord amen hallelujah
[1:12:20] this is the blessing of abraham because
[1:12:23] we're abraham's seed
[1:12:26] as many has been baptized into christ
[1:12:28] have put on christ and inherit
[1:12:30] all the blessings to the jew first
[1:12:34] and also the gentile the bible says
[1:12:37] praise god go to galatians chapter 4.
[1:12:44] galatians 4 now that i i'm sorry now i
[1:12:48] say that the heir as long as he's a
[1:12:49] child
[1:12:50] different nothing from a servant though
[1:12:52] he be lord of all
[1:12:53] but as under tutors and governors until
[1:12:55] the time appointed of the father
[1:12:57] even so we when we were children we are
[1:12:59] in bondage under the elements of the
[1:13:00] world
[1:13:01] but when the fullness of the time was
[1:13:03] come god sent forth his son made of a
[1:13:05] woman made under the law
[1:13:06] to redeem that we're under the law that
[1:13:08] we might receive
[1:13:10] the adoption of sons
[1:13:13] and because ye are sons god has sent
[1:13:15] forth the spirit
[1:13:16] of his son into your hearts crying abba
[1:13:19] father
[1:13:20] therefore thou art no longer a servant
[1:13:22] but a
[1:13:23] son and if a son then an heir of god
[1:13:27] through christ hallelujah you are a
[1:13:30] full family member praise god
[1:13:33] right you can i say like this we kind of
[1:13:35] hire people to do jobs at our house
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:38] like we had the uh the granite guys come
[1:13:40] today right
[1:13:41] now do they go into our fridge and eat
[1:13:43] whatever they wanted
[1:13:44] did they hop in the car and drive the
[1:13:46] car on did they they hop on the lawn
[1:13:48] mower and drive the lawnmower around
[1:13:49] those guys
[1:13:51] why because they're not family members
[1:13:53] right
[1:13:55] same idea right we hire outside work
[1:13:57] they come in but do they have all the
[1:13:59] access and privileges like we got
[1:14:01] no because they're not family members
[1:14:03] but the bible says you were
[1:14:05] a servant but now you're a family member
[1:14:08] praise god
[1:14:09] now you have access to all of god's
[1:14:11] blessings amen
[1:14:12] god don't want you to feel strange
[1:14:14] coming to him god
[1:14:15] welcomes you and says god wants you to
[1:14:18] come it says come unto me
[1:14:19] all you that labor and heal me heavy
[1:14:21] laden i'll give you rest for your souls
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:25] he's inviting us to come and experience
[1:14:27] the blessings and benefits
[1:14:29] of being a child amen
[1:14:32] we're no longer servants we're children
[1:14:35] of god
[1:14:36] we're adopted into the family
[1:14:39] and i like verse six brother rahm calls
[1:14:41] verse six paul verse six
[1:14:42] brother branham calls this the capstone
[1:14:45] revelation about the baptism of the holy
[1:14:47] ghost because it goes back to
[1:14:48] sovereignty
[1:14:49] because ye are sons god has sent forth
[1:14:52] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:14:54] cry
[1:14:54] abba father so this is speaking of
[1:14:56] foreknowledge god knew you were a son
[1:14:59] that's why you were born again amen in
[1:15:02] other words if you're born again you
[1:15:04] should have a lot of
[1:15:05] thankfulness in your heart and it should
[1:15:07] prove to you god has called me to faith
[1:15:09] god god has called me to this message
[1:15:12] god has called me to the rapture
[1:15:14] god has called me to the marriage supper
[1:15:16] of the lamb because i am born again amen
[1:15:19] that proves i am a child of god he knew
[1:15:22] beforehand that i want to receive it so
[1:15:24] he made a way i could receive it
[1:15:27] oh thank the lord amen oh it's a
[1:15:30] blessing church
[1:15:32] look at verse 29 galatians 4 29.
[1:15:39] well it seems like so so long ago i
[1:15:41] preached on that by
[1:15:44] actually it's going to 28 now we brother
[1:15:45] as isaac was are the children of promise
[1:15:49] but as then he that was born after the
[1:15:52] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[1:15:54] the spirit
[1:15:55] even so it is now
[1:15:59] now some of our people in the church can
[1:16:01] relate to this if you're being
[1:16:02] persecuted we kind of talked about it
[1:16:04] recently
[1:16:05] when you're being persecuted that's a
[1:16:07] very good sign
[1:16:08] that you're a child of god especially
[1:16:11] when you're being persecuted by church
[1:16:12] members
[1:16:14] right if you're being persecuted by
[1:16:16] church members
[1:16:18] the one who is doing the persecuting is
[1:16:20] normally
[1:16:21] the one who's not the one that's born
[1:16:23] again it's usually the the foolish
[1:16:25] virgin or the one who's a make believer
[1:16:27] right
[1:16:28] because the bible says the the children
[1:16:31] of the flesh
[1:16:32] persecute those that are the children of
[1:16:34] the spirit oh
[1:16:35] that's why the bible said rejoice when
[1:16:37] you're persecuted
[1:16:39] because that proves you're the child of
[1:16:41] god amen you're the blessed one in this
[1:16:43] situation you might not see it yet
[1:16:45] but the blessing's on the way praise god
[1:16:49] oh thank god hallelujah what a promise
[1:16:57] yep so when people call me pitiful like
[1:16:59] they do on youtube or
[1:17:01] life or they call me a sad condition i
[1:17:04] rejoice
[1:17:04] because i know i'm a child of god
[1:17:06] they're the ones persecuting me
[1:17:08] i know i'm standing on truth so i thank
[1:17:10] god that i can be the child of god
[1:17:12] i'm a child of promise and i can return
[1:17:15] their evil words with prayers of
[1:17:17] forgiveness
[1:17:18] hallelujah that's one thing they can't
[1:17:20] do right that's one thing they can do
[1:17:22] they can't show the love of christ and
[1:17:24] they can't receive remember jesus said
[1:17:26] that's one way you know they're not the
[1:17:27] children of god because they can't
[1:17:29] receive the spirit of truth
[1:17:31] right jesus said the world cannot
[1:17:33] receive it
[1:17:34] can you pull that up in uh john i
[1:17:37] believe it's john 17 whom
[1:17:38] the world cannot receive the spirit of
[1:17:40] truth
[1:17:42] it's not always in just the the signs
[1:17:44] miracles and wonders we got to have
[1:17:46] those
[1:17:46] and we thank god for those
[1:17:56] i'll pull it up there john yeah i'm
[1:17:57] sorry john 14 17. i'm sorry
[1:17:59] john 14 17. i knew there was a 17 in
[1:18:01] there
[1:18:03] see just the in any situation church
[1:18:06] when you can see the truth
[1:18:08] that proves you're being led by the
[1:18:09] right spirit
[1:18:11] praise god right john the baptist how
[1:18:14] many miracles did he do
[1:18:15] none but what spirit was he led by the
[1:18:18] holy spirit
[1:18:20] he preached the truth he told the
[1:18:21] pharisees they were a bunch of
[1:18:22] generation of vipers did he not
[1:18:25] he spoke the truth he recognized the two
[1:18:28] spirits in the framework of the church
[1:18:30] ah hallelujah
[1:18:31] praise god now we are called to do
[1:18:34] miracles right the church
[1:18:35] will do miracles so i'm not saying we
[1:18:37] don't have miracles
[1:18:38] what i'm saying is that we have the
[1:18:40] spirit of truth and in every situation
[1:18:42] we should be able to discern
[1:18:43] the right spirit against the wrong
[1:18:45] spirit
[1:18:46] look at that john 14 17 even the spirit
[1:18:50] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:18:52] because it seeth them not neither
[1:18:53] knoweth him but ye know him
[1:18:55] for he dwelt with you and shall be in
[1:18:58] you
[1:18:59] there's something about a christian can
[1:19:00] recognize the truth
[1:19:03] like even with the situation you know
[1:19:05] this family situation we had recently
[1:19:06] you know i was
[1:19:07] my wife and i were involved with that
[1:19:09] with some conversations
[1:19:12] there was just something that was on uh
[1:19:14] you know the anointing that's on my wife
[1:19:16] and i that we can just simply recognize
[1:19:17] truth things i mean just recognizing us
[1:19:20] a plain truth right something is this a
[1:19:24] liar is this wrong right
[1:19:26] sorry is this a liar is this true but
[1:19:28] there's something on a christian that
[1:19:29] can just recognize something
[1:19:31] that's the truth right no matter what a
[1:19:33] famous person says no matter what
[1:19:36] doctors say no matter what reports say
[1:19:39] no matter what famous people say it
[1:19:42] doesn't matter what they say
[1:19:43] it matters what the holy spirit says
[1:19:45] amen
[1:19:46] and when you are born again of the holy
[1:19:48] spirit you can receive
[1:19:50] the truth while other people can't
[1:19:52] receive the truth
[1:19:54] jesus said they cannot receive truth
[1:19:59] so it's so important to have the truth
[1:20:00] of god
[1:20:07] is anybody being blessed tonight praise
[1:20:10] god
[1:20:11] these are all your privileges
[1:20:16] the blessing of abraham upon you
[1:20:20] the blessings of being born again the
[1:20:22] bible says
[1:20:24] all these blessings are upon you you are
[1:20:27] a child you are a child
[1:20:28] of promise so what promise do you need
[1:20:31] tonight
[1:20:32] what promise are you trusting in
[1:20:37] what promise has god given us in the
[1:20:39] word of god that you believe
[1:20:42] is for you when you're a child of god
[1:20:44] you hang on to that promise
[1:20:46] despite the situation right despite the
[1:20:49] circumstances
[1:20:52] praise god i think i'll stop right there
[1:20:54] i'm right about it 45 minutes
[1:20:56] because if not i have to start something
[1:20:58] else and i have to jump in something
[1:20:59] else here
[1:21:02] the blessings of god how many thankful
[1:21:04] for the blessings of god
[1:21:06] i'm going to go real quick here uh yeah
[1:21:07] musicians you can come here
[1:21:09] since i'm in galatians yeah let's go
[1:21:10] right over there
[1:21:14] church there is something about you and
[1:21:16] i being made new
[1:21:18] constantly we are new creatures in
[1:21:21] christ jesus
[1:21:23] if we don't feel new something's wrong
[1:21:25] with our mind
[1:21:27] we stopped get we stopped laying
[1:21:28] ourselves on the altar of sacrifice
[1:21:30] because we're a living sacrifice
[1:21:32] look at galatians 6 verse 15.
[1:21:37] i remember using this numerous times for
[1:21:39] in christ jesus neither circumcision
[1:21:41] availed anything
[1:21:43] nor uncircumcision but a new creature
[1:21:46] what is god looking for in our life god
[1:21:49] is looking for us
[1:21:50] to be made new we're constantly being
[1:21:53] made new in our thought life right
[1:21:56] and what are we thinking about we're
[1:21:57] thinking about the promises of god
[1:22:00] hallelujah we're think we are not
[1:22:03] remember jesus said don't let your
[1:22:05] uh don't build up your treasures on this
[1:22:07] earth storm treasure's in heaven praise
[1:22:09] god
[1:22:11] the only thing that counts is that we
[1:22:13] become new in christ
[1:22:15] every day right as children of abraham
[1:22:19] just like abraham abraham as he got
[1:22:21] closer to the promise
[1:22:22] he started having more changes he was
[1:22:25] dead and his physical body was dead
[1:22:27] sarah's womb was dead
[1:22:29] but as they got closer to the promise
[1:22:30] they got closer to being changed and
[1:22:33] pretty soon
[1:22:34] they started changing and pretty soon a
[1:22:35] 90 year old woman looks beautiful
[1:22:38] grandma don't look so much like the gray
[1:22:40] hair anymore grandma's got that nice
[1:22:42] black hair back
[1:22:44] as they got closer to the promise the
[1:22:46] promises
[1:22:47] became more real praise god and church
[1:22:50] as we go
[1:22:51] close to the promises we become new
[1:22:53] creatures
[1:22:54] and we start to see the changes the
[1:22:56] reality of the changes in our lives amen
[1:23:00] we start acting more like christ we
[1:23:02] start acting more like the rapture's
[1:23:03] coming praise god
[1:23:05] because we're not falling away we're not
[1:23:07] we're not getting cold on god
[1:23:09] we're pressing toward the mark of the
[1:23:11] high calling
[1:23:12] we're blessed not cursed amen we see
[1:23:15] abundance in our lives we see the spirit
[1:23:17] of god
[1:23:18] blessing our lives not chastening our
[1:23:21] lives
[1:23:22] let's stand to our feet here so what
[1:23:25] promise are you hanging on tonight
[1:23:27] church
[1:23:29] what promise
[1:23:32] here's some good ones the fruits of the
[1:23:35] spirit
[1:23:37] now you might have healing in there too
[1:23:38] right you might have the salvation of
[1:23:40] loved ones which we've even prayed about
[1:23:42] tonight let's remember to pray for
[1:23:43] israel
[1:23:45] but the fruit of the spirit is love how
[1:23:48] many need that promise
[1:23:50] having any trouble loving anybody joy
[1:23:54] how about that that's a fruit
[1:23:55] peace peace in our hearts long suffering
[1:24:00] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[1:24:03] temperance
[1:24:03] against such there is no law can you
[1:24:06] pull it up there real quick so that
[1:24:06] people can see that
[1:24:08] verses 5 22 and 523 galatians
[1:24:12] we are children of promise which means
[1:24:14] many things church we've been promised
[1:24:16] but we don't see it yet
[1:24:18] how many times have you prayed haven for
[1:24:19] a lost friend
[1:24:22] guess what you're children of your child
[1:24:24] of promise
[1:24:25] you still believe it amen
[1:24:29] we're children of promise we're not
[1:24:30] children of a flesh
[1:24:32] well i've got to feel something i've got
[1:24:34] to see something to believe it now
[1:24:35] sometimes you need that right sometimes
[1:24:37] sometimes you need that but overall we
[1:24:39] should be children of
[1:24:41] faith that we see it with different eyes
[1:24:44] right hey when we don't see what the
[1:24:45] natural
[1:24:46] we see with the spiritual eyes as
[1:24:49] eagles were able to rise up like the
[1:24:51] eagle right and see long we can see afar
[1:24:53] off amen
[1:24:55] i see that god is going to answer
[1:24:57] because i'm a child of abraham amen amen
[1:25:00] it's a promise in his word he promised
[1:25:03] it
[1:25:05] and so we must see which promises apply
[1:25:07] to us
[1:25:12] we're not children of the flesh
[1:25:15] we're not children of uh
[1:25:18] of shortcomings right we're not children
[1:25:20] of unbelief we're children of faith
[1:25:23] so i guess we'll just close with that
[1:25:25] how many want to be encouraged praise
[1:25:26] god
[1:25:28] how many want to keep confessing the
[1:25:29] promises of god
[1:25:31] that's what abraham did and i love it
[1:25:33] god always came around to encourage him
[1:25:35] whenever he fell
[1:25:36] short just like tonight if you were
[1:25:38] discouraged by any
[1:25:39] any means tonight i hope you'll leave
[1:25:41] here encouraged
[1:25:42] because the holy spirit will come from
[1:25:44] time to time to encourage our hearts and
[1:25:46] remember you're not a
[1:25:47] you're not a child of sight you're a
[1:25:49] child of faith
[1:25:50] and that's real sight praise god that's
[1:25:53] the real spiritual sight
[1:25:55] amen
[1:26:02] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:26:05] peace long suffering
[1:26:06] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[1:26:09] temperance against such
[1:26:11] there is no law praise god
[1:26:15] so church look at the promises of god
[1:26:16] which one do we have need of tonight
[1:26:18] these are all promises i may not be
[1:26:21] totally manifesting it now
[1:26:22] but i've got a promise and i'm hanging
[1:26:24] on to that promise
[1:26:26] i told brother i told brother amen i'm
[1:26:27] going to preach a little message called
[1:26:29] uh what the i am says i am
[1:26:32] because we've seen that song well i've
[1:26:34] heard the people in psalms sing
[1:26:35] i am who i am because the i am tells me
[1:26:37] who i am right
[1:26:39] it's kind of a that's the bridge or
[1:26:42] whatever more that's the bridge
[1:26:43] but i like that thought that's a good
[1:26:44] thought i
[1:26:46] am what the i am says i am if he says
[1:26:50] i'm a child of promise i'm a child of
[1:26:51] promise
[1:26:53] right see they've tapped into so many
[1:26:56] truths
[1:26:56] but they don't know what they got but we
[1:27:00] we should know what we've got amen but
[1:27:03] see the devil fights us so hard we
[1:27:04] sometimes we forget
[1:27:07] and sometimes with them with the other
[1:27:09] groups that's all they do is think about
[1:27:11] what they got
[1:27:12] and they forget about what they need to
[1:27:13] get rid of
[1:27:16] we've gotten rid of a lot church amen
[1:27:19] right i can look at my pictures when i
[1:27:20] was younger i got rid of god's got rid
[1:27:22] of a lot out of my life
[1:27:24] a lot of the flesh moved out of my life
[1:27:28] but see they don't have that but they're
[1:27:29] still looking for all the blessings
[1:27:31] the promises but we've got a cleaned out
[1:27:33] life plus

[1:27:48] them that ain't the bride
