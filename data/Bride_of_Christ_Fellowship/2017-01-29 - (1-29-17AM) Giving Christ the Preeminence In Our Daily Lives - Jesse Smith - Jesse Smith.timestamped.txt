[38:09] Sunday I I really enjoyed uh being there
[38:11] with brother cam we had some wonderful
[38:12] meetings and some good testimonies and I
[38:15] was just really blessed to see how God's
[38:17] really revived their church over there
[38:19] they got a real good revival going on
[38:20] and four new Souls have come to the Lord
[38:22] so it's really great to see that uh God

[38:30] a wonderful job serving the lord so
[38:31] we're very thankful and

[38:37] 1 vers 18 but I got to hear Brother
[38:39] gab's sermons I listened to those a
[38:40] couple times each and really enjoyed
[38:42] them I kind of want to just follow up
[38:43] and do a little more on that I've been
[38:46] uh telling my wife and uh emailing
[38:48] different brothers and and saying I'd
[38:51] like to preach a little more on the
[38:52] family so we'll do a little bit of that
[38:54] but uh if you heard brother Gabe's
[38:55] sermons last week uh uh it just kept
[38:57] hitting the same things over and over uh
[39:00] deal with the home church family
[39:02] technology and all you know complacency
[39:04] and being in the right condition so I
[39:07] just really felt led to uh continue on
[39:09] that I was just so blessed like I was
[39:10] just sitting on the edge of my spiritual
[39:12] seat listening to it I listen to it all
[39:15] week and also listening to marriage and
[39:17] divorce from brother brandom all week
[39:18] just enjoying that that message
[39:21] there but Colossians 1:18 let's read
[39:23] this here by God's grace let's read it
[39:25] together we just have one verse uh let's
[39:27] begin on three 1 two 3 and he is the
[39:30] head of the body the church who is the
[39:33] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[39:36] that in all things he might have the
[39:39] preeminence let's just bow our heads in
[39:41] word of prayer if you have a need on
[39:42] your heart that you'd like to give him
[39:43] preeminence in within your life or like
[39:45] to have his will for an area of life
[39:47] just somehow make that known unto the
[39:48] Lord let's just bow our heads heavenly
[39:50] father my hands raised Lord we want to
[39:52] give you the preeminence this morning uh
[39:54] we want to give you first place in our
[39:56] lives Lord so we just pray see the need
[39:58] on the Heart Lord God see the need
[40:00] behind the hand Lord behind the prayer
[40:02] behind the tear behind the desire Lord
[40:04] behind the song hear our our our cries
[40:08] Lord from our hearts and I pray you just
[40:09] Minister by your word as you always do
[40:12] you are the word Discerning our our
[40:14] souls and spirits and Bone and the
[40:16] Sunder Lord and rightly dividing
[40:18] everything Lord help us this morning to
[40:21] get out of your way Lord and may you be
[40:22] glorified minister to the needs of the
[40:24] Saints live streaming but also most
[40:26] importantly the home home church here
[40:28] Lord God this little flock you've called
[40:30] us to gather in Lord may the great
[40:31] Shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ come and
[40:33] feed his sheep this morning guide us to
[40:35] Green Pastures and pure Waters Lord God
[40:38] and we thank you for that Lord and we
[40:40] just pray now we ask all these things in
[40:42] the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the
[40:44] church said amen God bless you be seated
[40:46] praise
[40:51] God so let's look at this here uh
[40:54] thought by the grace of the Lord Malachi
[40:56] if you'd like to switch over over here
[40:57] buddy you want to um just show some
[40:59] quotes this
[41:02] morning want to look at uh giving Christ
[41:05] the preeminence in our daily lives so we
[41:07] want to look at this thought and uh just
[41:10] kind of continue on what brother Gabe
[41:12] was brought out you know and it was very
[41:15] wonderful I was listening to it he was
[41:16] using some of the very quotes I've been
[41:18] mentioning lately so I just made a
[41:20] little visual there we got priorities in
[41:23] life and we got to first we got to obey
[41:24] Jesus Christ and so our title this
[41:26] morning is giving Christ preeminence in
[41:28] our daily lives that's kind of what his
[41:30] sermons kept going over um and uh I was
[41:34] really I really enjoyed all the teaching
[41:35] you know like his pictures he does
[41:36] pictures a lot better than me but uh I
[41:38] sure appreciate everybody's got their
[41:40] gifts and calling and I sure appreciate
[41:42] his gift amen I was so glad uh that you
[41:44] could hear uh from the Holy Spirit and
[41:47] uh and I know some of the things he was
[41:48] preaching God was dealing with me on and
[41:51] uh I know he's dealing with people in
[41:52] the church on those things oh brother
[41:54] van I'm sorry I can switch it over sorry
[41:55] about that buddy
[41:58] that
[42:01] work
[42:04] okay you'd have to shut down Chrome
[42:06] itself and then start all
[42:09] over so the live stream just
[42:15] off
[42:20] okay okay yeah would probably best just
[42:23] to stop it and try it again but if you
[42:24] don't how to try again it's okay I mean
[42:26] we just okay thank you darling so let's
[42:29] look at this thought here giving Christ
[42:31] prence in our daily lives you know
[42:33] technology like I said does really good
[42:34] about 99% of the time and this must be
[42:36] the 1% this morning you know but uh
[42:39] usually it works really great like I
[42:40] said really great um so our text was
[42:43] just one little scripture Colossians
[42:44] 1:18 I just want to focus on preeminence
[42:46] you know brother Gaye brought out some
[42:47] great quotes I'm going to try to bring
[42:48] out uh those uh and then a few more by
[42:51] the grace of the Lord uh so the word
[42:54] preeminence I thought what does
[42:55] preeminence actually mean you know if
[42:57] they gave it a a definition in the
[42:58] Lexicon it mean
