[1:40] [Music]
[1:44] I'm always
[1:50] easy you
[1:53] know all time knows
[1:56] exactly that's why I'm
[1:58] thankful you know in the message of the
[2:01] Hour come it puts so many things in
[2:03] perspective yes and because God releases
[2:07] his thoughts to you and I and that even
[2:10] where the Prophet would take that in a
[2:11] message dedication he would speak of the
[2:14] church there in Ephesus and he would say
[2:16] that that church ofus he
[2:19] said people amen take that and the
[2:23] message there the
[2:25] message God's not interested
[2:28] inze right
[2:32] [Music]
[2:37] that's that some things they were trying
[2:40] to set up you know for debate and things
[2:42] like that said well you know it's got to
[2:44] be le 200 people you know that'll
[2:48] disqualify most of the New Testament
[2:51] Church you know there's been nobody
[2:53] available you know all and everybody
[2:55] else you know but it's incredible isn't
[2:57] it sometimes how know man always looks
[3:01] at at success and looks at things in
[3:03] terms of terms of numbers and in terms
[3:06] of buildings and things like that just
[3:08] heard the Prophet this morning on the
[3:09] way over he said you know he said here
[3:11] in America he said we we feel like as
[3:14] though that everything's okay if we bu a
[3:16] nice church' done this and he it's just
[3:18] such a deception because God God really
[3:22] doesn't care I God is interested in us
[3:24] he provides a building for us but the
[3:26] real reality is you and tabac hallelujah
[3:31] hallelujah you I are the place of the
[3:33] the House of Prayer place where God can
[3:36] commune a place where God can come and
[3:38] rest and lay his head find Solitude in
[3:41] this hour people that will receive him
[3:44] just welcome it's just such a blessing I

[4:44] actually mentioned this our home church
[4:47] when we had the youth meetings there uh
[4:50] The Joint youth meetings and things but
[4:52] I I looked up there on the platform and
[4:55] I
[4:55] saw you
[4:58] know our boys and
[5:02] see coming up and singing and I thought
[5:06] you know a lot of what people will know
[5:08] behind the scenes is this right here
[5:10] that's actually taking place right up
[5:12] there they used to do that in our
[5:16] basement yes sir they had their own
[5:18] little title in

[5:24] right but uh I thought I tell you what
[5:27] if there's anything
[5:30] or go from they went from there and it's
[5:32] just it's transferred right over
[5:34] Hallelujah we just so appreciate that
[5:36] and just getting in and I I love that
[5:38] those services like that I I love those
[5:41] un service just singing them just

[7:51] Lord just to give ourselves to you that
[7:53] you might just speak to our hearts now
[7:55] we love you and we thank you now father
[7:58] in the preci name of of Jesus Christ
[8:00] amen amen amen and I want to go in the
[8:04] scriptures here if we could
[8:06] to uh Revelations chap 2 and I'm just
[8:11] going to read two verses of scripture
[8:15] verse 12
[8:21] verse3 let you be seated two vers of
[8:24] scripture Revelations 2 verse 12 verse
[8:28] 13
[8:34] it says un to the angel of the church in
[8:36] pergamus WR these things saith he which
[8:40] ha the sharp sword with two edges I Know
[8:44] Thy words and where thou dwellest even
[8:48] where Satan's seat is thou holdest fast
[8:52] my name and Hast not denied my faith
[8:56] even in those days where an my faithful
[9:00] martyr who was slain among you where
[9:04] Satan
[9:05] dwelle may God bless
[9:10] you I'd like to continue to look at that
[9:14] here just a few moments I really thought
[9:16] I may be going just a little different
[9:18] way and this is changed here just but I
[9:21] want to just speak continue on that
[9:23] thought of the authority in his presence
[9:26] we am we spoke for a few moments this
[9:28] morning just how the Lord would take us
[9:30] on the presence of God just to see how
[9:35] how wonderful and how God will work with
[9:38] us in bringing us into his presence and
[9:41] the effects that take place as we enter
[9:43] into the presence of God you you see all
[9:46] the way down through the scriptures any
[9:50] any uh mortal any man or woman that ever
[9:54] amounted to anything to serve the
[9:55] purpose of God what do the difference in
[9:59] their life was when they got into the
[10:01] presence of God yes yes and that's
[10:03] that's when everything changed
[10:05] Hallelujah we find that when any time
[10:06] that one like Moses Moses looked at uh
[10:11] things that were before him he knew the
[10:12] promise he knew things that were
[10:15] promised he even knew what he had been
[10:16] spoken over his life but yet that had to
[10:19] be made personal to amen had to be
[10:22] quickened to him and when Moses god
[10:24] allowed him to come to that place of
[10:26] complete failure where Moses could look
[10:29] at himself and say I'm a failure and we
[10:32] know God actually God doesn't Delight in
[10:36] us coming or or saying that we're a
[10:38] failure but what God want desires to
[10:41] bring us to is to that realization that
[10:44] without me you can do nothing amen amen
[10:47] it's not God God has not called you and
[10:50] I to the word that then it's us going to
[10:52] take our human strength and somehow
[10:55] fulfill the word of God the Bible says
[10:57] in the book of Isaiah that even uh the
[11:00] youth would grow faint and weary so even
[11:04] those as young people that would have
[11:06] the stamina to press through yet it
[11:08] would not be enough to measure against
[11:12] the forces of Darkness against Satan
[11:15] Satan is there's all sorts of Deceit and
[11:19] deceptiveness and everything that's out
[11:21] there but you know you don't have to
[11:23] study deceit the only thing I think how
[11:25] brother BR would put it with Columba how
[11:27] Columba there would actually just take
[11:30] and study the truth because he believed
[11:32] for himself and the other Ministry he
[11:34] said if you'll just study the truth
[11:36] present the truth he said then it will
[11:38] give that discernment to discern the
[11:40] false Hallelujah so that's the whole
[11:42] thing is just like you've heard that
[11:44] over and over the prophet said you study
[11:45] the real dollar bill and then you're
[11:47] able to identify the Hallelujah so we
[11:50] see that that's where the truth itself
[11:53] it makes us free it brings us into a
[11:55] place of Liberty to stabilize us so that
[11:57] we're not walking uh even in fear and in
[12:00] Wonder uh we have we see the promise we
[12:03] see the scriptures that are laid before
[12:05] us that where the spirit even that is in
[12:08] the land the great spirit of deception
[12:11] but there's also if there's the spirit
[12:13] of deception that is here with the
[12:15] strength the Bible said when the enemy
[12:17] would come in like a flood then I the
[12:18] Lord will raise standard against it the
[12:21] spirit of Truth is so much more greater
[12:23] than the spirit of deception Hallelujah
[12:25] so it's God that is ever present to lead
[12:28] us in every in every part in every facet
[12:30] of life and I just want to just draw
[12:33] from this here just a a few moments and
[12:35] looking at this Authority in his
[12:37] presence because as he he spoke to the
[12:41] disciples uh even in the Book of Matthew
[12:44] he says in the very last part when he
[12:46] was commissioning them he says um lo I
[12:49] Am With You Always and so it was God's
[12:52] Comfort even how Paul would even come at
[12:54] the end of the book of Hebrews and Paul
[12:56] would would reach back in the Old
[12:58] Testament and bring that present tent
[13:00] that you know that to the Lord is my
[13:03] helper and how that God is here with me
[13:06] and you know I I will look to him he's
[13:09] my helper he's my strength and we have
[13:11] that promise that many times you can
[13:14] even feel as though we don't feel his
[13:16] presence but I want you to remember this
[13:18] the scriptures going along with that
[13:20] says the angel of the Lord encampeth
[13:22] round about
[13:24] them and deliver and remember there was
[13:28] a prophet by the name of Elisha one time
[13:31] when Gesa became unsteady in seeing all
[13:34] the surroundings but
[13:36] Elisha prayed and asked God to open
[13:40] gaza's eyes and the prophet would take
[13:42] us he says I don't believe the prophet
[13:44] seen those angels but what he had
[13:46] confidence in is the word so I believe
[13:49] that Elisha is the type of us as the
[13:51] bride it brings us to a place to where
[13:54] it's not always something that we have
[13:55] to see or we have to feel but God is so
[13:59] positions us with the faith in the word
[14:02] to say God said it that settles it amen
[14:05] hallelujah God's there to back it up and
[14:07] I believe that's where it brings us to
[14:09] that reality God God has said he'd be
[14:12] with us he'd never leave us nor forsake
[14:14] us then I I believe that we can rest on
[14:16] that as I heard brother Jesse say right
[14:18] before as I was coming out that we want
[14:20] to keep the Commandments of God we want
[14:22] to keep God's word we want to stay in
[14:24] step with God's word well if that's our
[14:26] heart's desire and we just want to to
[14:28] please the Lord then God Will Make A Way
[14:31] through every situation I'm and whatever
[14:33] more that's what we can be confident in
[14:35] is that desire because when it all comes
[14:38] down to the Victory and and the hour
[14:41] that we're living in in Psalms 27 I love
[14:44] how it comes to that place and it says
[14:46] regarding all the situations that was
[14:48] taking place around David David then
[14:51] could say this one thing have I desire
[14:54] and that one thing will I seek after
[14:56] that I may dwell in the house of
[14:59] to behold the beauty of of uh in his
[15:02] Temple to inquire of the Lord so in the
[15:06] midst of all of this David said this is
[15:10] what I'm seeking after Hallelujah this
[15:12] is what I want to be locked in on and
[15:15] you know just God help me to block out
[15:17] every distraction and to be locked into
[15:19] the beauty of of of your Holiness
[15:22] Hallelujah and I I look at this here in
[15:25] the midst of this Authority that is in
[15:28] his presence so his presence is right
[15:30] here is right here uh with us and I look
[15:34] at these group of Believers that here
[15:36] they
[15:37] were right there in in pergamus and here
[15:41] as he writes into there to this age
[15:43] notice where this says that they were
[15:46] dwelling they were there even where
[15:49] Satan's seat is now we recognize Satan's
[15:52] seat that's Babylon right and yet we
[15:55] know that Babylon itself it's no longer
[15:58] a physical thing we're looking right the
[16:01] Bible tells us in the Book of
[16:03] Revelations it's become mystery babyon
[16:06] because it switched from that of being
[16:08] the from that of being Pagan to that of
[16:10] being paple yes and we find the
[16:12] influence that's throughout it and
[16:14] babyon itself the very root of it it's
[16:17] confusion yes and you look at the result
[16:20] of it like things right now today as it
[16:22] is in the world it's come to the height
[16:25] of confusion yes sir it's come to a
[16:28] place of such deception and such uh
[16:31] deceitfulness that is out there and all
[16:34] of these Spirits there are working and
[16:37] it's working to draw people under that
[16:40] of that of of mystery Babylon it works
[16:43] throughout all of her religion it works
[16:46] throughout all of the doctrine it's
[16:47] working through so many different areas
[16:49] because all of this with mystery Babylon
[16:52] is tied throughout every bit of the
[16:54] world yes it's tied within Commerce it's
[16:57] tied not only behind church but it's
[17:00] tied in politics it's all the way
[17:02] through it's woven and there's an effect
[17:05] as a matter of fact when the scripture
[17:06] would pardon me would pick that up even
[17:09] when you look at it here is Rome a
[17:11] nation one of the few things that's
[17:13] recognized like that doesn't even have
[17:15] an army but yet has such control over
[17:17] things that go on in the world right
[17:19] brother right good everybody wants to
[17:20] know what's Rome going to say what does
[17:22] the pope say right and and they're
[17:24] looking for that of a significance and
[17:27] yet you see all of the effects that
[17:29] comes in throughout the world and I just
[17:31] want to say this to you God has called
[17:34] you and I to live in this hour
[17:37] hallelujah amen and not just live as to
[17:40] survive but God's called you and I to
[17:42] overcome
[17:44] Hallelujah and to say this God doesn't
[17:47] put you and I in a position that we
[17:50] would be defeated God puts us in
[17:52] situations that yes the obstacles look
[17:56] great to us we realize the obstacles are
[17:58] more than a match for us but they're not
[18:01] more than a match for the
[18:04] god greater receive that's
[18:08] you that's where our Reliance that's
[18:10] where we rely on because remember his
[18:14] presence that has come to your life is
[18:16] not something that has just come to your
[18:18] life and pulled off of your life but his
[18:21] presence is there dwelling in your life
[18:24] his presence is him it's who he is it is
[18:27] the spirit of God it is the word of God
[18:30] that is the presence of
[18:32] God and it's dwelling there in your life
[18:35] and here while they in in that of the
[18:38] pergamus age and these Believers were
[18:40] right there in Satan's seat but this
[18:43] very much so speaks even to you and I in
[18:46] this hour because remember here they
[18:49] were dwelling in a physical location
[18:51] here they were where Satan's seat had
[18:54] moved that transition had taken place
[18:56] but we understand that that of Satan's
[18:59] seat and all of that it's migrated clear
[19:01] to Hollywood right right brother right
[19:04] things that that started out then it
[19:06] moves to France well what was what were
[19:08] they going after what was it in France
[19:10] brother brand Trac this back and we can
[19:12] go back in history and see it all of the
[19:14] fashions that was coming out everything
[19:17] that was that was wanting to to come out
[19:19] and to pull upon on desires and you
[19:22] think of this uh it's it's not abnormal
[19:26] for for for a a woman for a lady for a
[19:30] young girl to want to look beautiful
[19:33] that's built within her but yet Satan
[19:36] likes to take things that are god-given
[19:38] desires but he wants to try to move upon
[19:42] that and pervert it right right brother
[19:44] because how Satan wants to come with
[19:46] that is is to try to put it that its
[19:48] beauty itself is something to wear that
[19:51] you know things that that that are made
[19:53] to be uh taken away from what is the
[19:55] real true beauty which is character
[19:59] draw things you know clothing and cause
[20:02] things to be accentuated or things to be
[20:04] drawn after and you see that's where
[20:06] Satan he started there with clothing
[20:09] then it made its way all the way down
[20:11] into the church it made it all the way
[20:13] down into so many areas to where the
[20:15] real focus is is no longer upon real
[20:19] character and yet that's what God seeks
[20:21] out Hallelujah God seeks for character
[20:24] let me say this what is character that
[20:26] God's seeking after when he when God
[20:29] found Rebecca character the prophet
[20:32] tells us was one who would stand still
[20:35] and listen to the
[20:36] message Hallelujah character isn't
[20:38] somebody that all starts out right up
[20:41] here or I'm not right no character is
[20:43] where the the the the the Simplicity and
[20:46] willingness just to submit to what God
[20:49] is saying and to be able to receive the
[20:52] word of God hallelujah and then out of
[20:55] that then that word begins to release
[20:58] that character that's on the inside and
[21:00] God's character of life is continuing to
[21:03] unfold things in your life to bring
[21:06] forth who you really are Hallelujah and
[21:08] so right in the middle of it in in what
[21:11] is taking place that here we see all
[21:13] around us all and I think how the
[21:15] prophet when he would say that uh
[21:17] Invasion and the invasion in the US and
[21:20] the United States and then in perfect
[21:21] strength and he would speak about how he
[21:23] said streams of demon powers that are
[21:26] coming out of Hollywood those phrases to
[21:29] me speak so much now because when he
[21:32] says streaming out of there and I'm
[21:35] looking at that and we think of this
[21:37] right now I remember where when I used
[21:39] to live I lived in a community was near
[21:42] Saline Ohio we actually was closer to
[21:44] Rockford is where I went to school near
[21:46] the Indiana border and I mean you know
[21:50] we could come up here to where the
[21:52] church was at and you would see certain
[21:54] candies in the store up here you
[21:56] wouldn't find them where I live you
[21:58] would see certain Styles up here they
[22:00] weren't down there but now we're living
[22:02] in a in a time to where that everything
[22:05] itself is become so globalized right
[22:08] that where you know it's went from do
[22:10] you have a computer with internet access
[22:12] to where now phones right and we have
[22:14] all of these images we find things that
[22:16] are are pressures that come our way and
[22:19] it's not just pressures among young
[22:20] people older people fill with pressures
[22:23] too they begin to feel pressures of I
[22:26] wonder why we can't have what's so so
[22:28] has or or maybe we could go to on a
[22:30] vacation like this you know and not not
[22:32] meaning anything evil but sometimes you
[22:34] get to looking at things but let me just
[22:36] say it like this everything is not
[22:38] always what it seems to be yes yes amen
[22:42] everything is not always what it seems
[22:44] to be but Satan's objective is to always
[22:46] get you trying to chase after something
[22:49] and trying to get you to to chase after
[22:51] it that's how it started to fall in the
[22:52] beginning he puts something there before
[22:55] Eve says oh if you only have this he was
[22:57] trying to promote something to her if
[23:00] you have this you become content there
[23:02] is no content within Satan's kingdom
[23:05] once you have this there'll be something
[23:07] else you have this fashion something
[23:09] else you have this style it'll be
[23:11] something else it's built to work upon
[23:13] that of the appetite but yet in God
[23:16] everything that God lays before you God
[23:19] lets you know I've already provided it
[23:22] for you and you have access to it freely
[23:28] and it doesn't devalue your life it adds
[23:32] value to your
[23:33] life Hallelujah best part of the
[23:37] authority you have in the presence of
[23:39] God is to where when Satan presents
[23:42] things to you on a daily BL basis you
[23:46] have access to the king of glory that
[23:49] you can bring these things before him
[23:52] and say Lord what do you say about this
[23:55] yes Hallelujah think of this if Eve had
[23:59] only said at that time when Satan was
[24:01] putting his spin on things and you know
[24:04] wanting to make it sound just right and
[24:06] show how many likes he had and how many
[24:09] posts he had and wanting to just really
[24:11] if she would have just said all of this
[24:13] seems very inspiring seems very moving
[24:17] but I want to hear what my father says
[24:20] that's right right brother if she' only
[24:22] waited that little bit that little bit
[24:24] of time you know sometimes the the the
[24:26] ways that we get into to the mistakes or
[24:29] the traps or the things that we come
[24:31] into is because we haven't waited that's
[24:33] one of the greatest qualities of the
[24:35] believer says wait on the
[24:37] Lord if you wait on the Lord you renew
[24:40] your strength yes there's never wrong
[24:43] with waiting on the Lord when there's
[24:45] things that are before us decisions and
[24:48] things that we have to make we we're
[24:50] living in a time that like the the Lord
[24:53] told the prophet he says don't get your
[24:55] line tangled up in these kind of times
[24:58] wow good good These are times that we
[25:00] want to be sure of our footing amen
[25:04] These are times that we want to know
[25:05] where we're stepping and and and going
[25:07] through because it's an hour of such
[25:11] deception that's all around but remember
[25:13] we're not to walk in fear God said I've
[25:16] not given you the spirit of fear but of
[25:19] power love and mind he's not given us a
[25:22] spirit of fear we walk around in bondage
[25:24] of do I trust this do I trust this
[25:26] that's where the whole world's at now
[25:28] it's come to such a place to where
[25:30] things that seem so simple where little
[25:33] things here and little things there and
[25:34] little and then people look around and
[25:36] say what's true what can I trust what
[25:38] what's true what's real what because why
[25:41] everything the way Satan is so worth
[25:43] things is to create such instability
[25:47] among people but yet in the midst of
[25:49] this hour God himself has brought a real
[25:53] stability
[25:54] upon I'm telling you what's been exalted
[25:57] is the Rock of
[25:59] Ages and I can can rest and come to rest
[26:03] on and know just like when they landed
[26:05] on Plymouth Rock through all of the
[26:07] perseverance where they had to come
[26:09] through God himself has provided a place
[26:12] for you and I a rock that we can rest on
[26:15] that declares to us this is a land of
[26:18] Freedom a land of liberty where you can
[26:21] really be who God has Hallelujah youve
[26:25] got Authority in his presence
[26:28] and here they were you know even when
[26:30] you you look at this of the scripture
[26:33] when it speaks of this with anthropus I
[26:36] uh this to me is always something very
[26:39] uh strong you know with this anpus with
[26:41] a faithful martyr I believe anpus was
[26:44] the one brother Jesse you correct me on
[26:46] this if I'm wrong but I believe antus
[26:48] was the wrong because I don't have it in
[26:49] front of me he was the one where they
[26:50] said oh antias uh the whole world is
[26:53] against you he said then I'm against the
[26:55] whole world Hallelujah believe I think I
[26:59] have another another file I'm if the
[27:01] whole world's against me I'm against the
[27:02] whole world Amen now think of it this
[27:06] this individual we have no other record
[27:08] of anything else that he ever done but
[27:11] there's one thing that God recorded
[27:13] about him God said he was a faithful
[27:16] martyr
[27:17] yes we don't know was he a pastor was he
[27:21] a de was the we don't know that that God
[27:23] just let you and I know that's
[27:25] irrelevant he yes amen what you be
[27:31] Hallelujah give everything you
[27:36] with on looking at well you Pastor you
[27:39] nakon or you this God that doesn't look
[27:40] at those things sure all of those things
[27:42] are put in the body they all have their
[27:44] purpose God works through those things
[27:46] but in the end when it's all said and
[27:48] done God is looking for faithfulness
[27:51] hallelu what God rewards his
[27:53] faithfulness if you operate and what God
[27:56] has called you I do that's why we got
[27:59] Authority in his presence
[28:01] Hallelujah Glory I think of this of how
[28:05] when brother randam points this out with
[28:07] this of of Satan seat and he speaks of
[28:10] how that in this time that these these
[28:13] these uh Believers in that time he says
[28:16] they were overcoming Satan right in the
[28:19] midst of his own throne
[28:21] room that's powerful statement yes sir
[28:24] they were overcoming Satan right in the
[28:27] midst of of his own Throne Room amen not
[28:30] just somewhere far off but right in the
[28:33] midst where Satan was dwelling all the
[28:37] influences was coming forth from there
[28:40] but here were faithful soldiers of the
[28:44] Cross who were
[28:47] overcoming right in the midst of Satan's
[28:50] seat Hallelujah I tell you there had to
[28:53] be and there was something greater
[28:56] inside of these men than just their
[28:58] intellect Hallelujah it was it was an
[29:01] awareness it was a reality where Christ
[29:04] was was moving and pulsating in their
[29:07] own life brother Bram Likens them to the
[29:10] Mighty Men of David who who dare to go
[29:13] down and to take there of a drink of and
[29:16] get a drink for David from The Well of
[29:19] Bethlehem these these individuals were
[29:22] overcoming we lives that were entrenched
[29:26] and overcome with things that uh you can
[29:29] even bring down the spirits that are are
[29:32] prevailing even in this hour all of the
[29:35] ungodliness but yet there was a word of
[29:38] light that those Satan strong room was
[29:41] right there there was a word that was
[29:43] able to break every hole break every CH
[29:51] deat we can say this sometimes I know we
[29:54] would like to say if I could just bring
[29:56] this situation to church but let me tell
[29:58] you something God has called you he's
[30:01] equipped you where you're at you can say
[30:03] Lord let me just stand as a faithful
[30:07] Overcomer at
[30:09] scho let me just stand as a Faithful
[30:12] over Hallelujah change a lot they were
[30:16] standing forth that of Salvation right
[30:19] there standing in that hour faithful in
[30:21] that time Glory they had Authority in
[30:24] his presence they weren't acting alone
[30:27] it was was the presence of God that was
[30:28] moving and pulsating there even within
[30:31] their lives so I I want to just say we
[30:33] we have that of anus that's here and
[30:36] these things that just press on my heart
[30:39] antus had a testimony in so much that
[30:42] when you consider it a faithful martyr
[30:44] brother R will pick that up and he'll
[30:46] say concerning that with antus of how
[30:49] that you know it's not there's not
[30:51] anything in record that well you know
[30:53] anus was a a faithful prayer Warrior
[30:55] which we know he had a prayer life
[30:57] anus was this or that but what it comes
[31:00] down to is a faithful martyr so he had
[31:02] to
[31:03] seal his testimony yes amen you know the
[31:07] word martyr it actually comes from the
[31:10] word
[31:11] witness and Jesus himself he says that
[31:14] we to go he says go and wait in
[31:16] Jerusalem and you shall be witnesses
[31:18] that very word you break the meaning
[31:20] down Martyrs martyr how am I a martyr
[31:23] when you die to
[31:25] yourself you Di yourself when you give
[31:28] up your life now your life is a Living
[31:32] Sacrifice something that one time one
[31:34] time makes wait that for daily in our
[31:36] life we can sacrifice we can sacrifice
[31:39] our attitude sacrifice our thoughts
[31:42] sacrifice desires sacrifice things
[31:45] things that we sacrific that aren't
[31:47] necessarily uh wrong or sinful but will
[31:50] sacrifice him for the cause and the
[31:53] advancement of Christ and his life among
[31:55] us hallelujah
[31:57] called to live in that way and here as
[32:00] brother BR picks that up with antibus
[32:02] that even in his life you know a and
[32:05] through it all that that that throughout
[32:08] through his that life uh being yielded
[32:11] out that there would be others that
[32:13] would be affected by that and he says it
[32:16] just like this he says uh as as Satan
[32:19] did not Triumph then speaking over
[32:21] antibus even as he did not Triumph when
[32:24] he killed the Prince of Peace for as
[32:27] Satan was despoiled at the cross even so
[32:30] now with the blood of Antipas crying out
[32:32] to hundreds more who will take up their
[32:35] crosses and follow him amen it's a
[32:37] witness I mean even as we've read here
[32:40] tonight and we spoke just a moment of
[32:42] encouragement about antus it's having an
[32:45] effect on our lives tonight yes but what
[32:48] is it it is Christ that was veiled in
[32:50] anpus life as a believer that encourages
[32:54] you that here we are in Satan's Eden
[32:58] that God has equipped you and I in this
[33:00] hour to live an overcoming life
[33:02] hallelujah praise God a testimony amen
[33:06] sometimes sometimes the places that you
[33:09] and I come into we don't always get a
[33:12] choice of where we're placed right we
[33:14] don't if we had our choice we probably
[33:17] would choose here choose there choose
[33:19] but you know you think of it sometimes
[33:21] there's things uh uh uh things that come
[33:24] our way that we we don't have the choice
[33:26] over like like you take for example the
[33:28] the little Maid that was taken captive
[33:31] of Syria
[33:33] yes I don't know how I don't know the
[33:36] first few moments of what she must have
[33:38] felt like when she's taken captive by a
[33:41] Syrian Army she ends up she's their
[33:44] place in ne's house I wonder what all
[33:47] went through her mind I don't know but I
[33:50] know that she's human like you or I and
[33:53] she might be wondering why am I here
[33:55] what am I doing what the I do oh maybe I
[33:57] shouldn't have went to the well at that
[33:59] time maybe I should have went and
[34:00] visited over in this place in Israel
[34:01] maybe I should all those things you know
[34:03] how we are sometimes we're so busy and
[34:06] occupied with if I have done this or if
[34:07] I would have done that if i' have done
[34:09] this and done this and done that done
[34:10] this and we rehashed everything and yet
[34:13] we're still where we are right brother
[34:16] right and here was this ma she's unaware
[34:19] why am I here but God knows why He's
[34:22] placed her there yes and in the midst of
[34:25] it we do not read in the scriptures the
[34:29] humanity part of her yet it was very it
[34:31] was there but God God didn't need to
[34:34] point out and and tell us the humanity
[34:36] that she cried and she wept and she was
[34:39] taken away from her family we can
[34:41] understand that right yes there was a
[34:43] Humanity right yes but in the midst of
[34:46] it she had a testimony even when she was
[34:49] in a place she didn't choose to be yes
[34:54] it shows us that there are times just
[34:56] like Joseph
[34:57] Joseph was in Egypt and he didn't choose
[35:00] to be there yes good Daniel was in
[35:04] Babylon he didn't choose to be there
[35:08] right but here's what's important is is
[35:12] wherever that you find yourself and
[35:15] recognize God has opened this door God
[35:17] has opened this place this is where I'm
[35:20] supposed to be I may not like it but
[35:22] I've got a peace in my heart the rest in
[35:24] that this is where I'm at for right now
[35:27] yes this is where I
[35:28] belong then then at that moment you can
[35:31] be an instrument that God can use
[35:35] hallelujah what is that that's a
[35:37] decision that you and I have to make
[35:39] that's a place of overcoming that's
[35:41] Authority that we have in his presence
[35:44] that though I may not be where I chosen
[35:47] to be but yet here I am like this maid
[35:50] like Daniel like Joseph but yet they
[35:53] were instruments that God was able to
[35:57] have a testimony and even like that M
[36:00] she she had a testimony think about what
[36:03] had to work through her life to be an
[36:05] instrument she didn't say h they took me
[36:08] from Israel they took me from my family
[36:11] I ain't going to help them right right I
[36:14] mean this guy did this on the job did
[36:16] this dog eat dog I'm not going to help
[36:20] him no but the Bible says when she heard
[36:23] that nonon had
[36:25] leprosy she said said to the maiden of
[36:28] the house she said would to God he went
[36:31] to Israel there's a prophet in the land
[36:33] that pray forah and you'll be made whole
[36:37] wow you see even that resolve that she
[36:39] be to say I'm not going to live my life
[36:43] as though that I'm a victim the whole
[36:45] time yeah I'm a victim mentality I'm
[36:49] always the victim I'm always the victim
[36:50] everything's always against me she had
[36:52] to make a decision that just didn't
[36:54] happen she had to make a decision and
[36:58] she had Authority in God's presence to
[37:01] make a decision to Let It Go hallelujah
[37:05] hallelujah Glory same thing when it came
[37:08] even with Joseph by the time that God
[37:11] would bring things around with Joseph
[37:13] and here he would have to stand before
[37:14] his
[37:16] Brethren but God worked all that out in
[37:18] Joseph's life Hallelujah little through
[37:21] every little place worked it out and he
[37:23] wasn't just working out bitterness he
[37:26] wasn't just working out all those things
[37:28] but brother Brown would take us in one
[37:30] little place in the message a prisoner
[37:32] and he said one thing he had to work out
[37:33] at Joseph was Joseph got to feeling like
[37:35] he was a little something because of
[37:36] that
[37:37] dream wow he said he had to bring him to
[37:40] a place to where Joseph could see
[37:42] himself as a total failure wow what am I
[37:46] doing here then he's got a prisoner he's
[37:48] got someone he just just rely and just
[37:50] just just yield and just yield so the
[37:52] things that God brings us to this is a
[37:55] place where we gain author Authority in
[37:57] his presence how do our Authority how
[37:59] does Authority come by yielding
[38:01] hallelujah it's by yielding it's not our
[38:04] our struggling and pushing and trying to
[38:06] move our way through it's by yielding So
[38:09] within this part of of the testimony
[38:11] here I look at this with
[38:13] Daniel and just to take this here just
[38:16] just a few moments when we look at this
[38:19] with Daniel even in that time where he
[38:21] was at that Daniel here he was in a
[38:24] situation he and the other Hebrew
[38:27] children they were in a
[38:29] place they didn't choose to be good but
[38:33] the way that they themselves overcame in
[38:35] the midst of that I took a little bit of
[38:38] these things with our young people back
[38:39] home in some of these parts and I uh
[38:43] looking at that with Daniel of how that
[38:45] from the beginning when you look through
[38:47] the book of when you're looking through
[38:48] the Book of Daniel you realize even when
[38:51] you open chapter one that Daniel and the
[38:54] rest of them had understanding inside
[38:56] Sciences that's right they understood
[38:59] natural things this is why the prophet
[39:01] could say when he would speak of
[39:03] education and he would say education
[39:05] there he said is of the devil what he's
[39:07] speaking of he would remind us when you
[39:10] rely upon Ed that's right and it could
[39:13] be a person that could uh uh you know
[39:16] that could be ignorance can be in mad
[39:18] but if they rely on their intellect even
[39:20] when it comes to scripture that's
[39:22] education right brother right we're not
[39:25] the Bible didn't say son of God are led
[39:27] by education but we're led by the spirit
[39:30] of God hallelujah Daniel and them God
[39:33] knows what they had need of in this
[39:35] Natural Earth yes so it's not something
[39:38] to be if God thought that it was
[39:40] something to be frowned upon he would
[39:42] have said something about it or he
[39:44] wouldn't have included that in the
[39:46] opening part of the Book of Daniel but
[39:48] God saw it fitting to understand to let
[39:51] it be known that they had understanding
[39:53] in The Sciences in those things so to
[39:55] gain understanding to gain knowledge to
[39:57] gain things as young people and others
[40:00] where there skills that you have to have
[40:02] remember God is Jehovah Gyra he knows
[40:05] what you have need
[40:07] of even as if we go further in the Book
[40:10] of Daniel there was that time to where
[40:13] that even the Bible speaks of how that
[40:15] God Advanced the wisdom of Daniel not
[40:18] just in the natural things God was quick
[40:20] to assert also in the spiritual
[40:23] understanding glory and we find through
[40:26] the Book of Daniel when they'll come
[40:28] into situations there these are young
[40:30] people right Daniel and Shadrach meach
[40:33] and abedo these are young people right
[40:36] right in the midst of Babylon I mean
[40:38] they're having to deal with Facebook and
[40:40] I know that's not the young people's
[40:41] thing anymore forgive me that's the
[40:44] advanced older people they were having
[40:46] to deal with you know Snapchat and
[40:48] Instagram and all they having to deal
[40:49] with all those things yes those were
[40:52] things that were present before them you
[40:55] see this is where that when Daniel
[40:57] Daniel saw the king's meat saw the wine
[41:01] that was presented but Daniel made a
[41:03] decision I'm not going to be a partaker
[41:06] of this that's
[41:08] right now what I'm talking about here
[41:10] this is overcoming you know overcoming
[41:13] starts with a decision in your heart am
[41:16] yes said so many times people say if God
[41:19] will just take this evil spirit from me
[41:20] if God will if God will take the
[41:22] drinking from me God will take the
[41:23] smoking from me he said but that's up to
[41:25] you
[41:27] yes yes you've got a decision to make he
[41:29] says it's up to you the Bible say lay
[41:32] aside yes
[41:34] Hallelujah you got to make a decision
[41:36] how do I make a decision you make a
[41:38] decision by faith in his presence Glory
[41:42] let me just tell you something you can
[41:44] be you could sat right here right here
[41:46] and there might be things that that are
[41:48] around your life that you are bound with
[41:51] and you're looking and say how do I have
[41:53] authority because Satan has no no power
[41:57] over you but what you allow him to have
[41:59] that's right Hallelujah he ain't can
[42:02] have no Authority but what you
[42:03] permitting to have listen when the when
[42:06] the prodal son was down there in the in
[42:09] the most uh dire situation when he
[42:12] remembered about home when he remembered
[42:16] that the Bible says that in that moment
[42:19] he said I will return back home yes
[42:22] there wasn't anything that could stop
[42:25] him or hinder him from returning back
[42:27] home you know the only thing that'll
[42:29] hinder you is
[42:30] unbelief right that's why the prophet
[42:33] could say if there's anything holding
[42:34] you back listen this is what he would
[42:36] say over and over if there's anything
[42:38] holding you back don't come through the
[42:40] prayer line tonight you only make
[42:42] yourself worse he said but whatever it
[42:44] is that's holding you back get that
[42:45] remedy because when you pass through
[42:47] here it's got to be Faith it's got to
[42:50] understand this is what God has said I'm
[42:53] included in it he means it for me
[42:55] healing is for me me Deliverance is for
[42:57] me the Holy Ghost is for me Hallelujah
[43:00] so overcoming isn't something that's way
[43:03] far off overcoming begins with a
[43:06] decision
[43:08] Hallelujah that's why the Propet could
[43:10] say his wife hath made herself ready and
[43:12] he says by making that decision we show
[43:16] our faith and respects to God hallelujah
[43:19] we've got decisions to make you know we
[43:21] could put it down the road and well I
[43:23] put it down the road no it's a decision
[43:25] a decision has to be made is to be acted
[43:28] upon when the word of God comes that's
[43:30] the moment to act upon God's word
[43:33] hallelujah Daniel here as a as as young
[43:36] people were overcoming right there in
[43:40] Babylon they
[43:41] refused all of the the the the luxuries
[43:47] of
[43:47] Babylon I'm talking about all the Divine
[43:50] Delicacies and Daniel didn't even have
[43:52] the Holy Ghost like you and I have right
[43:55] right and they live an overcoming life
[43:57] yes sir and even when Daniel to me where
[44:00] I look at it you know this
[44:02] age is an age where it speaks
[44:05] of uh in the last days peress times will
[44:09] come yes and one of the very first
[44:10] things that describes or let you know
[44:13] it's a Peerless time men will be lovers
[44:17] of
[44:18] themselves yes and we're living in a day
[44:22] where it's a it's about
[44:24] me I mean you
[44:26] to need
[44:28] to everything you don't just you know we
[44:32] sometimes we look at those saint but all
[44:33] those things have meaning right yes yes
[44:35] sir you know I'm not I'm not against you
[44:38] know YouTube and those things that that
[44:39] you being used correct but you
[44:41] understand what I'm saying those things
[44:42] they're all out there yes and things
[44:44] just want to come so subtly this is why
[44:47] there's things that we need the
[44:48] discernment of the holy spirit in each
[44:50] things you realize there's things that
[44:52] could you could allow even as a young
[44:54] person simple in innocent things to so
[44:58] Encompass your life to where you miss
[45:00] out on what you should be doing right
[45:02] now that's right amen the strength the
[45:05] stamina the fortitude that you have
[45:07] right now in your life the things God
[45:09] allots that for this season of life that
[45:12] you're living Hallelujah in the time
[45:14] that you're in and here Daniel when
[45:18] everything comes about the vision Daniel
[45:21] looks and he says to um you know I can't
[45:26] remember the the uh the the one who was
[45:28] the ruler uh maybe Ash panz I'm not
[45:31] can't remember that exactly whether that
[45:32] was the name or not but he remember when
[45:35] the king you know he he has the he has
[45:38] the
[45:38] dream and when he has the dream Daniel
[45:42] he begins to go before God In Prayer
[45:44] along with the rest of the Hebrew
[45:45] children and as they pray and they seek
[45:47] after God to me these are little things
[45:50] that I I we a lot of times we we we we
[45:52] think about the stories oh Shadrach
[45:55] mesach and better to go in Daniel but I
[45:57] want you to understand it's s the simple
[45:59] things that led them to overcome it amen
[46:03] when situations arose that they didn't
[46:05] have an answer for they went to prayer
[46:07] amen amen yes they they they they would
[46:10] fast Lord you know let me just say like
[46:12] this I I I hope this all right I'm just
[46:14] just preaching as he just deler amen you
[46:17] know sometimes the fasting itself it may
[46:19] not all together the Bible said when
[46:21] Daniel fasted there before God he
[46:23] abstained from Pleasant me that's right
[46:27] sometimes there's things in our life
[46:29] that you know you you know even in the
[46:31] time we're living in right now you can
[46:33] be on a fast and yet you still might be
[46:35] eating but you're on a fast because
[46:37] you're taking a break from other things
[46:38] that are filling your life that's right
[46:40] right amen we're living in that time to
[46:43] say Hey you know there's there's certain
[46:45] things there's certain times there's
[46:46] times that really matter I I need to
[46:48] make sure that other voices are getting
[46:50] silenced good yeah amen I'm getting in
[46:53] tune with what say amen when Daniel came
[46:57] to that place you know God allows us to
[46:59] come to that place sometimes you know
[47:01] almost the spirit of Babylon it's a
[47:04] spirit of entitlement yes everything's
[47:07] just free we'll just give it to you for
[47:08] free here you just take it as though as
[47:11] yet the Bible says he has freely given
[47:13] us all things but sure all things are
[47:15] for us but you have to fight for every
[47:17] inch of that's right and who yourj it's
[47:20] not God it's fighting our own will yes
[47:24] Hallelujah PR beyond our own self our
[47:27] own comfortableness that's a spirit
[47:30] that's there it's here in this world the
[47:33] prophet would say like this in the
[47:34] church age book he said I'm afraid too
[47:37] many have not have
[47:39] underestimated this last day Spirit yes
[47:43] Hallelujah cooling off it's a spirit is
[47:45] though well you know if God wants me to
[47:47] have it no if you desire it God desires
[47:49] you to have it it's it's yours rise yes
[47:54] Hallelujah just didn't fall down with
[47:57] them sitting down there by the Jordan
[47:59] they had to go and they had to make
[48:00] their way around Jericho according to
[48:03] the word of the Lord
[48:05] yes walls came down you've got to see
[48:08] you have to come to that Resolute in
[48:10] your heart how much does it mean to you
[48:12] how much does God's thoughts mean to you
[48:15] how much does the Holy Ghost mean to you
[48:17] how much does your healing mean to you
[48:19] it's there for you but you'll have to
[48:21] fight for it
[48:23] Hallelujah Glory David Jacob's wrestling
[48:28] was Jacob submitting his own
[48:31] will
[48:33] yes it's our will just say it like this
[48:37] even after the Holy Ghost has come you
[48:39] still got to submit your will yes sir
[48:41] yes you still have to submit your will
[48:44] hallelujah amen it's overcoming hey
[48:46] we're overcoming right here in the midst
[48:48] of this of the time I I thank God for
[48:50] streaming I thank God for that I thank
[48:52] God that God's provided for those things
[48:54] but you know you you've even got to
[48:56] overcome to say h you know tonight H uh
[49:00] you know I'll still pull on the gift of
[49:03] God I'll just set my recliner at home
[49:05] you know and I'll be right behind
[49:06] brother Jessie if you're going to be
[49:08] right behind brother Jesse you need to
[49:09] be here right brother right it's
[49:11] overcoming see sometimes the things we
[49:13] make big oh these big things all this
[49:17] big things sometimes you say oh if I
[49:19] could just walk on the water sometimes
[49:20] you got to walk on your
[49:22] feelings you got to walk be on how you
[49:24] feel amen beyond your
[49:28] thought the great big things out there
[49:30] and it's right here in the simple things
[49:32] that we end uped and we wonder why the
[49:35] big things even look bigger it's because
[49:37] little things
[49:39] yes but this is the authority we have in
[49:42] his presence that we can come in the
[49:44] presence of God and bring this bring our
[49:46] lives bring ourselves subject to the
[49:48] Lord say God you would You Lead Me Guide
[49:51] Me give me the strength give me the amen
[49:53] amen see it's it's just like when Daniel
[49:56] when he when he received that of the
[49:58] Lord I love how Daniel makes that makes
[50:00] that statement Daniel says uh this right
[50:03] here that God has revealed to me
[50:05] regarding that uh of of the image uh of
[50:08] Nebuchadnezzar he said God has not done
[50:11] that for me he said he did it for them
[50:15] yes I want you to think of
[50:17] this the King was going to kill every
[50:20] one of those
[50:21] astrologers magicians all those men yes
[50:24] all those other wise
[50:26] Daniel's the one who spoke up on their
[50:28] behalf they were not even
[50:31] Israelites yes good but Daniel said whoa
[50:34] don't let the king be at
[50:36] haste here was a man living in Babylon
[50:39] which was a
[50:41] kingdom that was built upon
[50:44] sth yes you can see where it got to
[50:46] after a while eventually God pulled back
[50:49] a little bit soon as God pulled back it
[50:51] was God that gave them the authority to
[50:52] come and take Israel God pulled back a
[50:54] little bit look what happened in
[50:55] Nebuchadnezzar I've did this all on my
[50:57] own I've done this all and and God
[51:00] allowed him then he had to he went and
[51:01] ate grass like an ox yes yes right see
[51:05] God pulled back and so that Pride was
[51:07] right there yes so in the midst of that
[51:10] Kingdom it was very much a kingdom that
[51:12] was about self very much things that you
[51:14] had others around were so you know
[51:16] heightening of education but you had
[51:18] others in there that were living an
[51:19] overcoming life and they could see I can
[51:21] go to school I can get this skill I can
[51:23] learn these things right here but it's
[51:24] this is not what I'm worshiping this is
[51:26] only here God's provided God gave me an
[51:28] understanding a GI in this way is to
[51:30] provide down here cuz he's Jehovah Gyra
[51:33] he didn't put me in this earth without
[51:34] something of skill that he could bring
[51:35] out that could provide yes this this is
[51:38] not what I'm here to do this is not my
[51:40] my full purpose is just not this right
[51:43] right hallelujah
[51:46] amen Daniel here in the midst of that
[51:49] time they live an overcoming
[51:53] life and this is why
[51:55] when we when we look at
[51:58] this brother bwood refers to in in the
[52:02] Revelation series and he would asked the
[52:05] question who has more Authority in the
[52:08] presence of God an angel or a
[52:13] sinner says who has more
[52:16] Authority he says the Son of God has
[52:18] more Authority who is it he says where
[52:21] the angels are continuing to worship Him
[52:25] who has more Authority that angel that's
[52:27] worshiping or a son of God that begins
[52:29] to plead that begins to ask Begins the
[52:34] SE amen Son of
[52:37] God God himself will stop that to hear
[52:43] what his son or daughter is
[52:47] asking there's not let me say this to
[52:50] you kind of moving down to a close here
[52:53] there's nothing big or too small about
[52:58] your life that God doesn't care
[53:03] about tells us in God rich in Mercy he
[53:05] says God is interested in you he's
[53:10] interested in everything you anticipate
[53:13] in he's interested in everything that's
[53:16] dra God's interested
[53:19] Hallelujah I believe that amen I believe
[53:23] God was interested in
[53:26] Shadrach and meach and abedo here they
[53:28] were they stood as Overcomers in that
[53:30] time good even when there was a a
[53:32] pressure to just you know let down and
[53:35] conform you know here was an image of
[53:38] Daniel that was erected but they
[53:39] realized wait a minute there's nothing
[53:42] that can or should replace let's bring
[53:45] it down to us nothing should replace the
[53:48] true image of Christ inside of you amen
[53:51] amen nothing should hinder that reality
[53:55] hallelujah amen this is why you know
[53:57] brother BR says Satan's kingdom and
[53:59] Satan's even he said Satan he says he'll
[54:01] take there'll be he says ministers he
[54:04] said that are trying to establish
[54:06] themselves in the people's hearts
[54:08] instead of the kingdom of God yes
[54:10] hallelu he doesn't want another man's
[54:12] image in our lives he wants his
[54:16] image that's why your experience is a
[54:19] personal experience it's not somebody
[54:21] else's Hallelujah personal amen because
[54:24] it's Christ coming coming to reflect
[54:26] himself in you and through your life
[54:29] Hallelujah that's why God has made us so
[54:31] the diversity and how things are made
[54:34] and sometimes from young people and and
[54:36] I know the young people understand what
[54:37] I'm saying but even as sometimes it
[54:39] grows older God doesn't want us being
[54:42] like anybody else he wants to
[54:46] be who he is through your life yes amen
[54:51] that's why there's certain things we can
[54:53] talk about certain quirks and sometimes
[54:55] going quirks and certain ways God's made
[54:58] us the way he's made us for a purpose
[55:00] yes Hallelujah like the prophet he
[55:02] couldn't understand why they were down
[55:03] there shooting up squirrels and they're
[55:05] you know when they're hitting them here
[55:06] you know in the back and hitting them in
[55:07] the head and hitting them here and the
[55:08] prophet's interested in shooting them
[55:10] through the eye those men those those
[55:12] brothers are down there men are having a
[55:14] good old time brother just puts his gun
[55:16] next to the tree and starts weeping so
[55:19] why am I this way why am I this way that
[55:22] it matters that I have to hit him
[55:24] through the aisle and go told him I've
[55:25] made you this way for a purpose amen
[55:29] amen sometimes the things that we're
[55:31] we're trying to alter we want to change
[55:33] or somehow we don't want I'm not going
[55:35] to have a physical operation but
[55:37] sometimes we decide I'm going to have
[55:38] you know some type of an operation you
[55:40] know within my spirit or within my
[55:42] psyche or within myself so I'll act like
[55:44] somebody else God doesn't want you
[55:45] acting like anybody else yes God wants
[55:48] you to be who he's called you to be yes
[55:51] and it'll be Christ Living For Your Life
[55:54] Hallelujah am
[55:56] amen sometimes you know I think it was
[56:00] um Teddy Teddy
[56:02] Roosevelt you get into quoting things
[56:04] somebody say no no someone said that any
[56:07] I'll say Teddy Roosevelt said it I know
[56:09] other might say someone
[56:10] say said
[56:12] comparison is the thief of Joy that's
[56:16] right good comparison is the thief of
[56:19] joy we can battle that from from from
[56:22] time to time and I say that even as we
[56:24] looking just and I just feeling thislike
[56:26] with with even uh with that of the young
[56:29] people and the pressures that was even
[56:31] coming among them in that in that day
[56:33] think if even with these things I'm just
[56:36] trying to close just hit these
[56:37] highlights here
[56:39] but you know Daniel and them never did
[56:43] what they did to try to get
[56:46] promotion right they never said you know
[56:49] what I I want to get in the king's favor
[56:53] I want to I really want to so you know
[56:55] what in order to get in his favor what I
[56:57] think I need to do is I know I know what
[57:00] I'm do in order for them to get to look
[57:02] at me I think I can miss Wednesday
[57:04] nights yeah I I'll pick it up on
[57:06] Thursday morning I'll archive
[57:08] it good you know God understands you
[57:12] know this you know after all God's given
[57:14] me the skill and talent and so we start
[57:17] making corners and cuts on things in
[57:22] order to try to advance
[57:26] right and God himself knows what we can
[57:29] handle when we can handle and how much
[57:32] of it
[57:33] we right God knows
[57:37] that this is why with Daniel and the
[57:39] rest of when you read as you go through
[57:41] this and I know your Bible readers as
[57:42] you go through this you find Daniel and
[57:45] them never ever sought for promotion but
[57:48] every time they stood faithful with the
[57:51] Lord not only did God speak to them
[57:55] but the king had to take knowledge of
[57:57] the favor of God and they were promoted
[58:01] right amen why because it's the
[58:03] principle seek you first the kingdom of
[58:05] God his righteousness yes all these
[58:09] other things will be amen
[58:11] amen with the pressures of music when
[58:15] the pressures of things came around them
[58:17] that was all out there because music is
[58:19] to draw in to worship they play that
[58:22] music music has a way of kind of break
[58:25] now you know kind of mellowing out
[58:28] Satan's not the original he's a copy
[58:31] that's right that's
[58:33] right right but how that they would use
[58:37] that and the music and all those
[58:38] enticements and those things the alment
[58:41] that was around but yet in the midst of
[58:43] that time God gave Grace for Daniel and
[58:46] the rest of them to be able to discern
[58:49] those things that were out there and say
[58:52] that's not Hallelujah
[58:56] where is it
[58:58] taken where where will it direct me even
[59:01] when you you think of some of the you
[59:03] know some of the earlier Parts even with
[59:05] music and I just I go beyond that not
[59:09] just to stay in that realm of music but
[59:10] just to show that there is an overcoming
[59:14] that is set before us as young people
[59:17] middleaged an order there's overcoming
[59:20] that's placed here that you've got
[59:22] Authority in his presence yes don't you
[59:25] understand that God's never too far away
[59:28] God's not way out there he's right
[59:31] here as a matter of fact the prophet
[59:35] puts it straight down in this in this
[59:38] term when he talks about Jonah he said
[59:41] Jonah ran from the presence of the
[59:44] Lord he said but you know when you're
[59:47] trying to run from God's presence you'll
[59:49] find out he's
[59:52] ever Hallelujah that's right
[59:57] you can't outrun and escape the presence
[1:00:01] of God and the plan of God for your life
[1:00:04] Glory Glory Hallelujah I'm glad for that
[1:00:07] amen amen amen amen glory so he's not
[1:00:12] he's never too busy the old song that we
[1:00:14] would sing he's never too busy and let
[1:00:17] me tell you something there's never
[1:00:19] anything that's too insignificant amen
[1:00:22] right God cares about everything in your
[1:00:26] life and I think of this of this
[1:00:28] relationship that's been opened to us as
[1:00:30] children of God in this hour we have
[1:00:32] authority in his presence to bring every
[1:00:36] situation we have authority in the
[1:00:38] presence of God to make decisions glory
[1:00:42] amen we don't have to ask we don't have
[1:00:44] to ask the enemy you think it'd be all
[1:00:46] right could you give me a little SL we
[1:00:48] don't have to ask that's
[1:00:52] right God has given you Liberty but it's
[1:00:56] the things that even in being honest
[1:00:58] listen even even having this Authority
[1:01:00] in the presence of God say Lord increase
[1:01:03] my faith where it needs to be amen for
[1:01:06] what I have need of in my life
[1:01:07] Hallelujah just being that open and that
[1:01:09] honest with God you've got Authority in
[1:01:12] his presence like Esther had to be over
[1:01:16] that's right am it might take you a few
[1:01:19] times before you can finally uncover
[1:01:21] hmon but you know what each time keep
[1:01:24] Ting him back amen keep welcoming the
[1:01:27] presence of the Lord back and God
[1:01:29] himself moves down and that hmon that's
[1:01:34] intended evil that's wanted to destroy
[1:01:37] in the presence of our kid yes is
[1:01:42] exposed so what I do keep on inviting
[1:01:45] keep on entertaining the Pres of the
[1:01:47] Lord Hallelujah Lord increase my faith
[1:01:50] Lord amen increase my sights Lord give
[1:01:52] me Grace in this hour Lord as a young
[1:01:54] young person middleaged what to live
[1:01:56] Lord let me live that Victorious Life in
[1:02:00] Babylon amen I look at it you placed me
[1:02:03] here then you've given me sufficient
[1:02:05] Grace the means to live an overcoming
[1:02:07] life because it isn't always so much
[1:02:09] about what we're to overcome that's how
[1:02:12] yes Hallelujah like brother re says the
[1:02:15] what itself is really insignificant when
[1:02:18] you know how hallelujah how is having
[1:02:21] God's word inside you that's how you
[1:02:25] hallelujah it's having his life inside
[1:02:27] of you you know it's being it's just
[1:02:30] this is part of overcoming because this

[1:03:01] such a neurotic age where there's such
[1:03:03] deepness and darkness that's within yes

[1:04:18] self your own feelings I said God bless

[1:04:23] of Satan's

[1:04:39] always lay there within you just to make

[1:05:59] Satan trying to put up a bluff and a
[1:06:02] hindrance but it's an opportunity that
[1:06:05] God is going leading you to overcome
