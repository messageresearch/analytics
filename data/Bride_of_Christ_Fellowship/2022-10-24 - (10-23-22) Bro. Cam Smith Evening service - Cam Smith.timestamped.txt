[0:00] thank you
[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] foreign
[2:01] during the year Lord put on my heart and
[2:04] uh
[2:06] and we trust it'll be a blessing to you
[2:12] we're going to go to Second Corinthians
[2:13] 11 3 and then Romans 11 33 for our
[2:16] opening here
[2:23] as you can see tonight we're going to
[2:25] preach on the perfection
[2:27] of simplicity
[2:30] wait I thought simple Simplicity was
[2:32] simple
[2:33] there's a Perfection of simplicity
[2:36] sure is we're going to take it right
[2:38] through the word of God and begin to tie
[2:40] some of these things our our topic
[2:41] tonight will be two women crying out
[2:44] so we have the Perfection of Simplicity
[2:46] and then two women crying out and we'll
[2:49] be depending on the great savior to help
[2:51] us out this evening uh Second
[2:53] Corinthians 11 3 it says
[2:56] but I fear less by any means
[3:00] as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[3:03] subtility
[3:05] so your minds should be corrupted
[3:09] from the simplicity
[3:12] that is in Christ all right so the devil
[3:16] is always in the details as far as
[3:18] trying to get you to yearn for more than
[3:22] what is revealed to you right and
[3:24] obviously we have a message that
[3:26] revealed God hidden in Simplicity we'll
[3:29] deal with that in a moment here
[3:30] but notice if Satan can conrupt you from
[3:35] the Simplicity of Christ he's he's done
[3:37] got you like he had Eve right
[3:40] so he says for if he cometh he that
[3:42] cometh preaches another Jesus
[3:46] whom we have not preached or if ye
[3:48] receive another Spirit which you have
[3:51] not received or another gospel which ye
[3:53] have not accepted uh you might be well
[3:56] bear with him all right now I appreciate
[4:00] brother Jesse having confidence in me to
[4:02] be here without him being here that
[4:04] means a lot to me I appreciate that but
[4:07] yet if you actually see what it is by
[4:09] Design God has now left the laity with a
[4:12] different preacher
[4:13] so this is where you count on those
[4:16] things that you have been taught
[4:18] that Holy Ghost buzzer inside that would
[4:21] tie right on with the word uh you would
[4:24] actually be standing on your own two
[4:27] feet so to say and uh this is where we
[4:30] really start taking a little idea about
[4:32] Simplicity and what Simplicity is
[4:34] because Simplicity is something that has
[4:37] actually been transformed to a different
[4:38] image in this day all right
[4:40] so we're going to spend a little time on
[4:42] this and uh there there's a little
[4:44] a little beautiful thought within this
[4:46] if the Lord help us get there
[4:48] so they didn't put up with it did they
[4:50] they preached a different gospel a
[4:52] different Jesus they didn't want nothing
[4:53] to do with it
[4:54] Hallelujah all right Romans 11 33.
[5:07] Romans 11 33 and then we'll say a word
[5:09] of prayer let you have your seats
[5:18] oh
[5:19] the depth
[5:21] of the riches both of the wisdom and
[5:25] knowledge
[5:27] of god wow so the wisdom and knowledge
[5:31] of God is deep
[5:35] how unsearchable
[5:37] are his judgments
[5:40] and his ways past finding out
[5:44] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[5:45] or who hath been his counselor or who
[5:49] has first given to him and it shall be
[5:51] recompensed unto him again
[5:54] for of him and through him and to him
[5:57] are all things to whom be glory forever
[6:00] amen so we can only consist and survive
[6:03] just because of Christ
[6:05] Hallelujah that's why we're made
[6:07] manifest right to be the Bride of Jesus
[6:10] Christ in this hour so uh if we think
[6:12] we're gonna get something up on God that
[6:14] ain't gonna happen right but we're
[6:16] working with this idea the Perfection of
[6:19] Simplicity uh we'll see where the Lord
[6:21] will take this let's bow our heads for a
[6:22] word of Prayer
[6:24] our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ how
[6:26] we love you we appreciate
[6:28] how good you are Lord and as we once
[6:31] again come just crying out to you Lord
[6:34] God that you'd give us a Grace and a
[6:36] mercy Lord surely
[6:38] as On Any Sunday evening the devil might
[6:41] fight with uh fatigue or something like
[6:44] that but we're asking oh God that you
[6:45] just allow your spirit just to remain in
[6:48] the room oh God allowed to be strong in
[6:50] our midst oh God because we don't want
[6:53] to be babies oh God you're your Prophet
[6:55] told us we can't be babies but we should
[6:57] be what we should be trained soldiers
[6:59] Lord so with that we come to the house
[7:02] of God tonight wanting to know more
[7:04] about you Lord wanting to understand you
[7:06] a little bit better so we pray oh God
[7:09] you take these lips of clay take this
[7:10] mind o God and
[7:12] bring a thought that will help the
[7:14] children of God tonight and Lord will
[7:16] surely be glad as the word unfolds so
[7:19] surely be in our midst we love and
[7:21] worship your Holy Name Lord Jesus Christ
[7:23] and the church says together amen you
[7:25] may be seated
[7:35] so once again we'll be working tonight
[7:37] with the Perfection of Simplicity uh to
[7:41] women crying out
[7:45] notice here in Isaiah 35 8 it says and
[7:50] then Highway shall be there and away
[7:54] and it shall be called the way
[7:58] of holiness
[8:00] the unclean shall not pass over it
[8:03] but it shall be for those the wayfaring
[8:07] men though fools
[8:10] shall not air
[8:12] therein my aren't you glad that God has
[8:17] revealed to you the way amen it is a way
[8:21] of Holiness in this untoward generation
[8:25] right but the scripture
[8:28] in looking at simplicity
[8:31] he talks about the way that we should go
[8:34] and that he would make it
[8:37] so plain that a fool shall not air
[8:42] therein Hallelujah so you see the way to
[8:47] this Rapture though it be hidden it is
[8:51] available amen aren't you glad that when
[8:54] the message was ministered to you in
[8:57] whatever form it was that you had ears
[9:00] to hear that word amen hallelujah you
[9:04] added something that Drew you to it amen
[9:06] you knew it was right you knew it was
[9:09] for you you knew that it was the
[9:12] unfolding of God to your generation
[9:14] Hallelujah you heard it right now
[9:19] the path to this Rapture also cannot be
[9:22] that difficult
[9:24] right we realize it's really as simple
[9:26] as receiving the baptism in the Holy
[9:27] Ghost
[9:29] amen
[9:30] Hallelujah the wise had oil right but
[9:33] she was wise all right now
[9:36] we're going to begin to work with
[9:37] Simplicity and the reason why we're
[9:40] going to work with Simplicity is because
[9:43] it over abounds
[9:46] in churches
[9:48] that you actually put the work on
[9:51] someone else instead of doing it
[9:53] yourself
[9:54] and what we understand we're just
[9:55] talking about organizational spirits and
[9:58] so forth but it was actually Satan's
[10:01] great plan that he would fool the church
[10:05] by making men want to conquer the laity
[10:11] they would be perhaps smarter
[10:14] more social
[10:16] they'd be have an anointing or be or be
[10:20] some great somebody and the church would
[10:24] therefore forfeit their rights
[10:28] to what God had for them and try to
[10:30] place it on a man
[10:34] instead of actually living the purpose
[10:36] out
[10:37] for why they're here
[10:38] why is that important because as we see
[10:41] we all are to have the gifts of the
[10:44] Spirit the fruit of the spirit amen
[10:46] we're all supposed to have the shout of
[10:49] a king in the camp amen there should be
[10:51] a God moving in our lives continually
[10:55] amen
[10:56] Hallelujah
[10:58] and it's nice to see it it's nice to be
[11:02] a part of it
[11:03] well that's why we're going this
[11:05] direction this evening to begin to
[11:08] unfold a picture to you about
[11:10] true Simplicity and what Simplicity is
[11:12] now the Bible has this picture so
[11:15] painted in there it's so beautiful so
[11:18] God give us strength to bring this out
[11:20] but I want to start here it's really
[11:23] small
[11:24] but and God is hiding in Simplicity in
[11:27] 63 412 he said God is so great
[11:30] he can make his self simple
[11:34] that's what makes God great to me is how
[11:37] he can make himself simple and that for
[11:40] doing himself he hides himself from the
[11:43] smart
[11:44] and the wise
[11:46] oh my
[11:47] God I don't want to be smart and wise
[11:50] let's take a little balance in a moment
[11:52] now just think of that he hides himself
[11:55] from the smart people and reveals
[11:57] himself to the humble people see how he
[11:59] changed that
[12:01] he hides himself from smart people but
[12:04] reveals himself to Humble people
[12:07] very good very good the Bible said in
[12:10] Isaiah 35 even though a fool should not
[12:12] air in the way it's so simple and as law
[12:16] as you try to figure it out and study it
[12:19] out you just figure away from God every
[12:22] time you do that
[12:25] you just get yourself further and
[12:28] further
[12:29] away
[12:31] quit trying to figure it out
[12:34] just believe what he said did you get
[12:36] that just believe what he said
[12:40] we have literally in the message had 57
[12:44] years of people trying to figure it out
[12:49] right
[12:50] they figured out that the seals mean
[12:52] this the Thunders mean this
[12:56] Hallelujah that what
[12:58] that this is a really prosperous church
[13:01] because they do this this that and the
[13:03] other
[13:05] and everyone is trying to figure things
[13:07] out his Mercy over his Mercy not over
[13:09] just you it's boundless the areas that
[13:13] you can go and there's always something
[13:15] new will he return again well will
[13:17] brother Branham have a mature return
[13:18] Ministry or will he not
[13:21] and it's really made such a confusion
[13:26] that they've actually shown that they're
[13:28] just trying to figure something out
[13:30] but I would say this
[13:32] they're actually figuring out themselves
[13:34] away from God
[13:36] because he said right here you just
[13:39] believe what he said
[13:42] so if we actually want to know what true
[13:44] Simplicity is
[13:46] the Bible will tell us that too won't it
[13:49] Hallelujah now watch it says
[13:54] that's all there is to it just believe
[13:57] it and then he then he hides himself
[13:59] from the wise and shows himself to the
[14:03] simple man can't be that big right now
[14:08] remember who's going to make the Rapture
[14:10] the wise versions
[14:12] many people have demonized
[14:17] their understanding of scripture the
[14:20] understanding of the message on account
[14:23] of misinterpretation of these things
[14:26] the Bible says in Matthew 25 that you're
[14:29] a wise virgin
[14:31] but if I read that wrong I will say it's
[14:34] a shame to be wise
[14:37] see it
[14:40] Hallelujah now what this bursts forth
[14:44] we want to be simple
[14:46] so what we've been taught is
[14:49] just trust your pastor just trust your
[14:52] preacher
[14:54] let your preacher do a most of the
[14:56] praying let your preacher do most of the
[14:59] directing
[15:01] but when brother Branham actually talked
[15:04] positively
[15:05] about First Corinthians 14 where
[15:08] everyone had a Psalm everyone had had an
[15:10] exhortation everybody had something they
[15:12] were going to give in brother Branham
[15:14] actually said that was a positive thing
[15:16] when it was used in the right manner
[15:19] everybody is supposed to contribute in
[15:22] the house of God Hallelujah that was the
[15:25] point this morning every joint supplyeth
[15:28] amen we should know where our gifts are
[15:31] at we should know where God is moving us
[15:33] at and we should be able with that to
[15:36] exhort and strengthen one another
[15:40] that's nicolaitanism and where it
[15:43] destroys what it what it conquers the
[15:46] laity but the laity must come to a
[15:49] position
[15:51] of simplicity
[15:53] where they understand how it's really
[15:54] supposed to work
[15:56] you can't demonize wisdom and have a
[15:59] wise virgin
[16:01] doesn't make sense now does it
[16:04] but brother Branham will Hammer wisdom
[16:06] over and over and over again but how is
[16:08] he meaning that
[16:10] because what we've been taught is that
[16:12] that means that you know what you can't
[16:13] understand your Bible
[16:16] right I've had people they say to me
[16:18] they say brother cam where did Brother
[16:20] Branham say that
[16:23] do you see what they're doing
[16:25] so if I'm going to do this if I can only
[16:28] say exactly what brother Branham said
[16:31] then I got to stay out of the book of
[16:33] Nahum
[16:35] you better watch out there's only
[16:37] certain places I can go in haggai
[16:39] I can't touch much of Zechariah either
[16:44] they're trying to fit people into some
[16:48] mold
[16:49] when that whole word is Christ and is
[16:54] available
[16:55] for teaching exhortation and
[16:58] strengthening to the Bride of Jesus
[17:00] Christ
[17:02] you see how it's going
[17:05] but
[17:06] when you watch this
[17:10] see how the definition ties in
[17:13] it says simple right there it says what
[17:16] what does simplicity really mean what
[17:18] does single really mean
[17:20] to be simple is to be single
[17:23] consisting of one thing
[17:26] Now watch how he brings us out it is
[17:28] uncompounded unmingled
[17:32] so to be simple is to be unmingled
[17:36] [Laughter]
[17:38] Hallelujah God loves one
[17:41] he said be ye separate touch not the
[17:46] unclean thing
[17:48] so if you really want to be simple stay
[17:51] away from that which you're not supposed
[17:53] to mingle with
[17:55] to be simple is actually to be only
[17:58] consisting of one thing
[17:59] what should we be what consisting of
[18:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and its
[18:06] leadership in our lives amen
[18:08] now watch this this is I love this so he
[18:11] says it's combined with anything else as
[18:14] a simple substance a simple idea a
[18:16] simple sound if you keep on defining it
[18:19] it means sincere harmless not complex or
[18:22] complicated
[18:23] we can intellect not wise or sagacious
[18:27] silly uh oh
[18:29] so you may
[18:30] that there's a good simplicity
[18:33] and a bad simplicity
[18:38] I try to make everybody think don't I
[18:40] even on a Sunday night
[18:45] Hallelujah let's look in the scripture
[18:47] let's begin to take a look at this all
[18:49] right Psalms 116 6 it says the Lord
[18:53] preserveth the simple
[18:56] I was brought low and he helped me
[19:01] that sounds good that's as simple I want
[19:04] we want to be simple to God Amen to let
[19:08] him reveal himself to us amen
[19:12] now here we go
[19:14] we're going to go now 62 725 greater
[19:16] than Solomon is here
[19:18] he said
[19:19] then there's nine gifts
[19:23] that's locally in the church speaking in
[19:25] tongues interpretation tongues gift of
[19:27] wisdom knowledge prophecy and so forth
[19:28] them nine spiritual gifts that operates
[19:30] through the church but then there's nine
[19:33] or five office gifts that God puts in
[19:35] the church and oh how we love to see
[19:37] them all operating
[19:39] wow isn't that something
[19:41] we should say well I love to see it
[19:43] operate too
[19:44] amen one of them is Pastor teacher and
[19:47] those things then the others comes along
[19:50] in confirmation
[19:51] gifts are to magnify and God's just got
[19:55] it
[19:57] so even a fool will not be excused will
[20:01] he
[20:05] God makes his gifts his nine spiritual
[20:08] gifts I can preach a whole sermon about
[20:10] that I spent I spent 10 sermons
[20:12] preaching it last year oh I love it
[20:14] you know your Prophet said he said that
[20:16] your that the gifts moving through the
[20:18] church would be just like his gift
[20:21] it's first that's First Corinthians 14.
[20:24] 24 25 26.
[20:27] amen
[20:28] when someone unlearns come what
[20:30] he said if all prophesy one is convinced
[20:33] one is Judge of all
[20:34] and then the secrets of their heart
[20:36] being made known they were what they
[20:38] will have a true say God is with you
[20:42] your brother Brandon says another place
[20:44] he said if the gifts of the Spirit is
[20:46] there he said you will bypass many
[20:49] things
[20:51] Hallelujah that'll make you want them
[20:54] think about all the hard trials that you
[20:56] have in your life that's why God has
[20:58] gifts for the church nine spiritual
[21:00] gifts because when they get single or
[21:03] simple to God God can bring them out and
[21:06] manifest in the church many things that
[21:09] you have to bypass
[21:11] instead of having to go through many
[21:13] trials that you shouldn't have to
[21:15] see why the devil don't want you to have
[21:17] that
[21:18] Hallelujah so
[21:22] but look he said it's so simple to
[21:24] receive the gifts
[21:25] that a fool could narrow there wow
[21:30] it's so simple the way God has made them
[21:34] and I like that
[21:36] so the even the nine spiritual gifts
[21:39] moving in our life are simple
[21:42] he made it so simple
[21:44] what have we done then have we
[21:46] complicated it
[21:47] what have we done
[21:49] the more simpler you become the greater
[21:52] you'll become before God that's right
[21:56] don't never try to lift yourself up when
[22:00] you do you're bringing yourself down see
[22:04] he that exalts himself shall be abased
[22:09] notice how he ties that in
[22:12] he ties in Simplicity once again with
[22:16] not lifting yourself up
[22:20] so what is true Simplicity is being
[22:22] single to God Amen not trying to add
[22:26] yourself in the equation but coming
[22:29] before Christ or coming before Christ
[22:31] God and saying not my will but thine be
[22:34] done amen
[22:36] taking the mind of Christ
[22:39] now
[22:40] let's continue
[22:45] let's now begin to move here for time's
[22:47] sake let's go to Proverbs 7 verse 7.
[22:56] perhaps one of the deepest books in the
[22:59] Bible
[23:01] is the Book of Proverbs
[23:03] we're going to spend some time in
[23:05] Proverbs tonight and we're going to show
[23:07] you a little picture with this okay
[23:09] We Trust will be a blessing to you
[23:12] Proverbs 7 7
[23:15] because we say oh I want to be simple
[23:18] but simple has become an excuse to not
[23:21] read your Bible to not pray to expect
[23:24] everyone else to do the work for you
[23:26] right
[23:28] the place I'm at is a pastor I'll just
[23:30] say this and I'm in a visiting church so
[23:31] I'm not going to tell you things that
[23:33] I'm finding I'll tell you I preach stuff
[23:35] like this about being civil
[23:36] [Laughter]
[23:38] but but I have come to find out that I'm
[23:41] tired of trusting other preachers
[23:43] narratives
[23:47] because if what they're telling me is
[23:49] right it should produce that's right
[23:53] it shouldn't produce no love it
[23:56] shouldn't produce
[23:58] um the organizational Spirits it
[24:01] shouldn't produce that
[24:05] so then I come back I've had to come
[24:07] back and I'm now testing the narratives
[24:10] I literally spent I've told you it's
[24:12] already probably I said I spent two
[24:14] three hundred hours studying the seals
[24:15] out all over again
[24:17] just because I'm like okay what's going
[24:19] on here I want to know and you know what
[24:21] I told my church
[24:23] study it out
[24:26] I'm not the only one here that can study
[24:28] I'm not the only one here that can pray
[24:30] it out
[24:31] because I want to know what truth is
[24:34] if we've had the seals delivered
[24:38] then what's going on and why are things
[24:40] like they are
[24:43] well when we come back and find out
[24:47] a lot of it comes back to what trying to
[24:50] figure things out
[24:52] Hallelujah when you look at the simple
[24:55] truth of it
[24:56] it's a little bit different than what
[24:58] people say this
[25:00] but if you tell them that you better
[25:01] watch out
[25:03] Hallelujah that's for the cam coming
[25:06] from no point in Ohio for you amen
[25:09] hallelujah Proverbs 7 7 and I'd be held
[25:13] among the simple ones well this has to
[25:15] be good
[25:16] this is about simple people
[25:18] Glory
[25:20] I beheld among the simple ones I
[25:22] discerned among the youths a young man
[25:25] void of understanding wait
[25:29] so you can be simple
[25:32] and not have understanding
[25:36] why was this message given to us
[25:40] not that we would be void of
[25:42] understanding
[25:43] but that we would have understanding
[25:47] that understanding is revelation amen
[25:50] that's right Hallelujah now watch this
[25:54] it says passing through the street near
[25:58] her corner and he went the way to her
[26:02] house in the Twilight in the evening in
[26:06] the black and dark night and behold
[26:09] there met him a woman with the attire of
[26:13] a harlot and subtle in subtle heart
[26:19] she is loud and stubborn her feet abide
[26:24] not in her house
[26:26] ah
[26:28] here we have somebody simple
[26:33] but they don't have any understanding
[26:37] and because of that remember our topic
[26:41] tonight is two women crying out
[26:45] here a woman is crying out uh of course
[26:48] you see I have written here she has the
[26:51] attire of a harlot
[26:55] Hallelujah there is a harlot brother
[26:57] sister in Revelation 17. amen
[27:03] she is after simple ones too
[27:08] she's the mother of Harlan and I'll tell
[27:10] you what she has daughters too
[27:13] now that word simple there it means
[27:17] Simplicity or not yet or to be a naive
[27:22] simple foolish
[27:24] open-minded
[27:28] she was simple and she didn't have
[27:31] understanding you know why people cannot
[27:34] move forward with God is because they're
[27:36] told all about the seals but they don't
[27:40] understand that what it's really showing
[27:43] us is how the devil fights us through
[27:45] organizational spirit
[27:48] and if you don't have that understanding
[27:54] your Void of understanding you will be
[27:56] void of understanding and you will fall
[27:57] for it
[27:59] Hallelujah think about this
[28:02] perhaps the biggest church in America
[28:06] in the message they have Halloween
[28:07] parties
[28:10] they have fall fellowships where all the
[28:11] kids dress up like ghouls ghosts and and
[28:15] pumpkins and whatever else they want to
[28:17] dress up to
[28:18] how did it come to a spot
[28:21] that people that believe what we believe
[28:27] they're doing things that are contrary
[28:31] to Common Sense
[28:34] when Halloween
[28:37] is nothing more than than a Catholic
[28:39] holiday that's joined with many Pagan
[28:41] thoughts
[28:45] hallelujah it's good to be simple
[28:49] but we must have understanding
[28:54] Hallelujah there's a harlot
[28:57] that is out to get all
[29:01] she will she'll rule for one hour
[29:04] your Prophet said
[29:06] amen
[29:08] so notice I'm showing you a negative
[29:11] side
[29:12] through the scripture to show you
[29:15] what true
[29:16] Simplicity really is it is to be single
[29:20] but what if I mix it
[29:22] it's not single anymore see it
[29:25] Hallelujah all right now let's look at
[29:27] Proverbs 9 13.
[29:30] I'm showing you the spirit of God and
[29:32] the spirit of antichrist if you can
[29:33] catch it let's just get it right out
[29:36] there amen hallelujah
[29:39] Proverbs 9 13 it says a foolish woman is
[29:43] clamorous right
[29:45] right you're always talking it up right
[29:47] she is simple and knoweth nothing
[29:52] well I thought it's great to be simple
[29:54] the simpler I'll be
[29:56] the greater I'll be with God not this
[29:58] simple
[30:02] she's so simple she don't do what she
[30:05] don't know anything
[30:06] so she's capable to receive anything
[30:09] now watch this for she sitteth at the
[30:11] door of her house on a seat in the high
[30:14] places of the city
[30:15] to call passengers who go right on their
[30:20] ways there it is this woman who knows
[30:24] nothing is simple and she is calling to
[30:30] who
[30:31] who so is simple
[30:35] let him turn in hither
[30:39] wait a minute I thought this was great
[30:41] to be simple
[30:43] ah
[30:45] what's the Lord trying to tell us here
[30:47] now watch this
[30:48] and as for him that wanted understanding
[30:55] it's good to be simple I would say but
[30:58] we must have understanding
[31:02] Hallelujah
[31:04] she saith to him stolen waters are sweet
[31:08] and bread eaten in secret is pla is
[31:12] pleasant but he knoweth not that the
[31:15] Dead are there
[31:16] and that her guests are in the depths of
[31:19] hell
[31:20] this woman that is crying out
[31:23] she is also looking for simple people
[31:27] she wants simple people that have no
[31:30] understanding
[31:33] they don't understand remember even as
[31:36] it's spoken said my people perish for a
[31:40] lack of knowledge
[31:43] we don't read the the Bible to become
[31:45] theologians we read the Bible to put the
[31:49] word in our hearts amen Hallelujah we
[31:52] don't listen and study the message so
[31:55] that we can meet lingo talkers or to
[31:58] appear like we're some know it all we
[32:00] want we listen and follow this message
[32:03] to put the word in our lives amen so
[32:06] that we can know what is right and what
[32:08] is wrong and want to the issue is what
[32:11] the one that's almost right
[32:15] laughs
[32:16] remember if it'd be so close to see the
[32:19] elected if possible
[32:20] not right is not what we're worried
[32:22] about because we see that
[32:25] we are worried about what's almost right
[32:28] that's why discernment is given to tell
[32:30] what is almost right
[32:33] which takes lore doesn't it
[32:36] see that
[32:37] of course clamorous there talking about
[32:40] this woman and noisy has a mouse
[32:43] speaking great swelling words a vanity
[32:45] and blasphemy wow that sounds exactly
[32:47] like the Catholic Church doesn't it
[32:49] imposing of infallibility works of
[32:52] superior irrigation whatever that means
[32:54] merits Miracles wealth and riches and
[32:56] very pressing and important uh to gain
[33:00] proselytes to his religion the priests
[33:03] and Jesuits are compared to noisy
[33:05] clamorous croaking frogs
[33:10] now when you read
[33:12] the managed commentators every single
[33:15] one of them knew that this was talking
[33:17] about Rome
[33:23] but the vast majority of the people in
[33:24] the message never heard that at all
[33:33] I'm just saying something
[33:35] because what I'm saying is we've been so
[33:38] placed in laodicea
[33:40] that we really don't seek out the word
[33:42] like we should
[33:44] we really don't pray like we should
[33:46] we lean on Church experience
[33:50] instead of
[33:52] positioning ourselves in a position
[33:56] where God can fully reveal himself to us
[34:00] right
[34:04] I told my church that said study these
[34:06] seals out
[34:08] I asked later I said who don't study it
[34:09] out brother Simon did a little bit
[34:11] did something I was saying glory to God
[34:14] because when he started studying now
[34:15] he's like brother Kim I see exactly what
[34:18] you see
[34:19] I was like hey man
[34:22] so I always offer that I offer my church
[34:25] I said you want my notes I said you
[34:26] don't want to put the time in it because
[34:27] it takes time it takes time to go
[34:29] through all those quotes
[34:32] you want stuff I'll give it for you
[34:34] bring a jump drive we'll download it
[34:36] right on there in seconds
[34:38] you have a lot before your fingertips
[34:41] because it's good to understand and know
[34:43] what is going on I just had a big a big
[34:46] name preacher just tell me uh just a
[34:48] while back he said well we understand
[34:50] that brother Bram said a lot of things
[34:51] that are wrong
[34:53] what do you mean by that
[34:59] was he a man absolutely
[35:03] but you be careful when and I said well
[35:07] then what is right and what is wrong
[35:09] who's the judge of that
[35:14] see how this really affects our faith
[35:19] well that's what the Holy Ghost
[35:22] the Holy Ghost should be in the preacher
[35:25] congregation
[35:26] it should be in this brother this sister
[35:28] Hallelujah if you're a sister that
[35:31] doesn't mean you can't read the Bible it
[35:33] doesn't mean you can't study it and
[35:35] understand it
[35:37] it just means you have to stay in your
[35:38] position as you do
[35:41] Hallelujah hey we can talk about
[35:43] proverbs 31 women all day long I know we
[35:45] got something here
[35:47] Hallelujah
[35:50] let's continue
[35:52] I'm getting you this picture
[35:54] Proverbs 14 15.
[35:59] Proverbs 14 15.
[36:02] the simple believeth every word
[36:07] is that a good thing or a bad thing
[36:09] well remember what Proverbs does
[36:11] Proverbs will show you a good side and
[36:13] then I'll show you a bad side it'll show
[36:14] you a bad side and then a good side
[36:16] but see but that's not good
[36:20] the simple believeth every word every
[36:22] word of what somebody tells them
[36:29] but The Prudent man looketh well to his
[36:33] going
[36:34] you know what that word Putin actually
[36:36] means wise
[36:40] Hallelujah
[36:42] do we want to believe every word yes but
[36:46] it must be the word
[36:49] Hallelujah who dictates that this fella
[36:53] that fella right while back they come in
[36:56] they said they said the message is the
[36:58] absolute
[37:01] and they said because brother Branham
[37:04] had the angel of the Lord with him his
[37:07] opinions are better than ours I said
[37:10] brother do you drive a four
[37:14] he said uh well uh I already had him
[37:19] because brother Graham said Fords are
[37:21] better
[37:23] I got one today so I can preach this
[37:26] they said well well uh well you know it
[37:30] don't mean that
[37:33] I said so this is what it means to you
[37:36] then it means that the message is the
[37:39] absolute for whatever this person wants
[37:42] to tell you it is
[37:48] and all he could do is call me Nathan
[37:49] and Cora
[37:57] I can see it praise God let the Holy
[38:00] Ghost go from glory to glory in every
[38:02] single life amen
[38:04] because a buzzer goes off and you're
[38:07] like wait a minute
[38:09] how do if I don't catch you somebody
[38:10] better catch it
[38:12] because no man's infallible
[38:15] Hallelujah
[38:17] so we have to make sure when we believe
[38:19] the word that it's the word
[38:23] because as we see that this is com this
[38:26] is being compared to the woman Rome
[38:30] this harlot
[38:31] this is actually pretty staggering
[38:35] The Prudent man looketh well to his
[38:38] going
[38:39] so the wise person
[38:42] is going to okay you're telling me
[38:44] that's the truth
[38:45] I think I'm going to study that out I'm
[38:47] going to take a look at that
[38:49] amen and he got the Holy Ghost you're
[38:51] gonna be all right aren't you
[38:52] if it's a word you'll see it if the
[38:55] words you'll confirm it
[38:57] it puts a lot of emphasis on the laity
[39:00] to come a little bit higher how we look
[39:02] at things
[39:04] amen oh it's great to have anointed
[39:06] preachers it's great to have people that
[39:07] know a lot man glory to God I love that
[39:10] a lot of them people all over the world
[39:12] amen
[39:15] but I'm preaching about something that's
[39:16] going to activate the laity
[39:19] Hallelujah because you know those simple
[39:21] gifts right back there and all the
[39:23] amazing uses that they have I'd love to
[39:25] see that in the church amen I know it's
[39:27] common amen oh we look for a time
[39:29] brother sister well sin will not be able
[39:32] to enter that door amen
[39:34] that's the holies of holies
[39:37] that's what we're looking for will it
[39:38] come to the symbol absolutely but it
[39:41] will be the same symbol who are
[39:43] single-minded to Christ
[39:46] all right
[39:48] so there it is your definition of
[39:50] prudent it means cautious circumstance
[39:52] practically wise
[39:55] so a prudent man is going to look in
[39:57] now think about it if someone tells you
[40:00] if I tell you that that Ford Explorer is
[40:01] a good vehicle and you need to get that
[40:03] are you just going to go get it because
[40:04] I tell you that
[40:06] I got a quick note it says Lincoln good
[40:08] job man he passed it you are practically
[40:11] wise
[40:12] Hallelujah but what are you gonna do
[40:16] my you might
[40:17] you might like brother cam
[40:19] but I think I'm going to look into this
[40:21] a little bit
[40:22] so you start looking at the fort
[40:24] well I found this this that and the
[40:27] other hallelujah it's really it's really
[40:29] easy to waste time on Amazon that way
[40:31] now isn't it
[40:33] Hallelujah hey they got robots making up
[40:36] reviews for you oh my
[40:38] Hallelujah but watch wisdom says well
[40:42] maybe I should look into this because
[40:45] just because it's working for them
[40:47] doesn't mean it's going to work for me
[40:49] Hallelujah
[40:51] just because this preacher is sticking
[40:54] around he's doing good looks like he's
[40:55] in the message
[40:58] if he tells you this is right
[41:01] we should always check into it make sure
[41:03] it's right
[41:04] amen
[41:05] that's a challenge
[41:06] Hallelujah
[41:09] continuing
[41:11] Romans 16 17 says now I beseech you
[41:14] Brethren mark them which caused
[41:16] divisions and offenses contrary to the
[41:20] doctrine which ye have learned and avoid
[41:22] them
[41:24] hmm
[41:25] this is really hard to pull off and
[41:27] and brotherly kindness age
[41:29] we're careful we're trying to be wise
[41:31] about these things for they are that are
[41:34] such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but
[41:37] their own belly and by good words and
[41:41] fair speeches deceive the hearts of the
[41:45] simple
[41:47] wow
[41:49] so how is he going to turn it now
[41:52] for your obedience has come abroad unto
[41:55] all men I am glad therefore on your
[41:57] behalf but yet I would have you wise
[42:01] unto that which is good
[42:04] and simple concerning evil
[42:08] Hallelujah
[42:09] remember
[42:12] wisdom
[42:14] is the ability
[42:16] to know what is the cause between right
[42:21] and wrong
[42:22] and to know which decision to make
[42:25] because of that
[42:27] right
[42:29] so that's comes right back down to
[42:31] afford right you can choose a far
[42:34] because I tell you to but wisdom tells
[42:38] you well I better look a little bit more
[42:40] into the matter because there might be
[42:42] something better out there for me
[42:47] Ma
[42:49] and then you'll make a better decision
[42:50] then when when my car breaks down which
[42:52] is not not this one
[42:56] but if a car breaks down then you say
[42:59] boy I should have done that one we've
[43:01] all done it you buy things sometimes say
[43:03] oh I should have bought that instead
[43:04] what was I doing
[43:06] that money's out the door Hallelujah
[43:11] so what Paul tells them
[43:14] is I want you wise unto that which is
[43:16] good
[43:17] but simple concerning evil
[43:21] if it's evil just have the Simplicity
[43:24] about it and say nope I'm not having
[43:26] anything to do with it
[43:28] David said I hate evil
[43:31] single that's single
[43:36] so as we see
[43:39] true Simplicity is not to see how lazy
[43:43] you can be towards the gospel
[43:45] neither how much you can learn memorize
[43:46] or figure it out
[43:48] true Simplicity is how humble
[43:53] and single you can become to God
[43:56] in order for God to build you up with
[43:59] his wisdom
[44:00] Hallelujah
[44:02] now
[44:03] watch us
[44:06] Proverbs 15 28.
[44:09] the heart of the righteous
[44:13] studieth
[44:14] to answer
[44:16] all right
[44:18] so if someone's righteous
[44:21] when they're given something if they
[44:23] don't have an answer they're going to go
[44:24] study it out they're going to make sure
[44:26] that you get the right answer
[44:29] right
[44:30] but the mouth of the wicked
[44:34] poureth out evil things
[44:37] I'm at a spot where the sister where I'm
[44:39] just I'm all into wisdom I'm all in
[44:41] understanding of stuff because I love it
[44:43] I love it
[44:45] because you know what
[44:47] I want to be at a better place that
[44:49] through yielding to Christ I can bring
[44:51] forth the word better to to whoever I
[44:54] talk to if I Minister the gospel
[44:56] whatever it is I want to bring forth
[44:57] something that will strengthen them in
[44:59] wisdom
[45:01] I think that's good isn't it right
[45:04] I've seen this happen so many times I
[45:06] can't tell you how many times I've seen
[45:07] it
[45:09] and as soon as we read this you'll know
[45:11] exactly what I'm talking about
[45:13] so what the heart of the righteous will
[45:14] study the answer watch this he that
[45:16] answereth a matter before he heareth it
[45:20] it is folly and shame
[45:24] unto him
[45:27] now notice that he that answers a matter
[45:30] before he Hearth it
[45:35] so what that means is and I've watched
[45:38] this just I watch this happen all the
[45:40] time
[45:43] someone and this is where parenting
[45:45] comes into you this you see it's a lot
[45:47] with parenting
[45:49] is that your child might run over you
[45:51] and they said so and so did yes
[45:56] and what you do as a parent
[46:00] if you're a wise parent
[46:01] you say is that right
[46:04] so and so
[46:07] but
[46:09] if you become trained on it
[46:11] like this with Folly and shame
[46:14] you'll hear that matter and you say I
[46:17] knew it was you my son and you just go
[46:20] right off after it
[46:21] but then sometimes if you ain't careful
[46:23] you'll find out later that they didn't
[46:24] even do it to begin with
[46:27] you watch this happen so much in the
[46:29] church
[46:36] oh brother Vang obviously you know if
[46:38] you hear Brother bang I mean Mercy he's
[46:40] mean
[46:42] then all of a sudden you take that and
[46:44] then you begin to treat Vang like he's
[46:46] me
[46:49] happens all the time
[46:51] now brother Vang look at that smile
[46:52] that's a million dollar smile
[46:54] you can't get by that
[46:56] [Laughter]
[46:58] Hallelujah but you see so many times
[47:02] as a pastor I have been I have been
[47:04] convicted numerous numerous times on
[47:08] saying and doing things I've never done
[47:11] all because someone wants their opinion
[47:13] in the way they think things were and
[47:15] Things Are
[47:16] and they wanted to say it like that
[47:18] and then I have somebody that heard that
[47:19] matter and they'll come over and jump me
[47:21] like I'm some evil serpent
[47:24] and I say well
[47:25] you know it didn't happen like that
[47:26] right
[47:28] uh
[47:29] but what is it
[47:32] it's finally insane
[47:36] they're not wise
[47:38] wisdom says let me hear the matter
[47:41] and then we'll then we'll make decisions
[47:43] then we'll do things
[47:47] okay let's watch this let's continue to
[47:49] look at wisdom Proverbs 22 3 a prudent
[47:52] man practically wise
[47:54] for seeth the evil
[47:57] and hideth himself
[48:00] all right
[48:02] but the symbol passed on and are
[48:06] punished
[48:08] ah
[48:10] so we want to be prudent we want to be
[48:12] simple but we want to be yielded to God
[48:19] because these simple ones they don't
[48:21] foresee the evil think about it we're
[48:23] coming on a squeeze right here we've got
[48:25] a squeeze coming up
[48:27] Hallelujah we need to foresee the evil
[48:29] and hide ourselves
[48:31] right in the collapse of the Rock Amen
[48:34] find the safe place amen in Christ
[48:40] While others will tell me brother cam it
[48:42] ain't coming in my lifetime
[48:44] here it is
[48:46] hallelujah I I told a fell the other day
[48:49] he's all worried about his IRA and I'm
[48:51] like I really ain't got no plans for
[48:52] that because it's all going to disappear
[48:53] pretty soon anyway
[48:55] like that and he's like all right well
[48:57] my IRA I'm going to do this this that
[48:59] and then that
[49:01] Hallelujah he don't care about the evil
[49:03] coming he ain't worried about preparing
[49:05] for it he said it'll get better someday
[49:09] but that's
[49:10] not prudence
[49:12] he's trying to be simple thinking that
[49:14] the system will will continue to go on
[49:16] without without the crash but it was
[49:19] made to crash
[49:21] our Prophet said it's going to crash
[49:23] amen it's going to go down
[49:26] Proverbs 27 12 a prudent man for seeth
[49:29] the evil and hideth himself again
[49:32] but the symbol won't pass on and are
[49:35] punished hey wait that's the same exact
[49:37] scripture
[49:38] but once in Proverbs 22 and one's in
[49:40] Proverbs 27.
[49:43] we better be prudent
[49:46] practically wise I'm going to show you
[49:49] in a little bit here where this is going
[49:50] Proverbs 14 18. the simple inherit folly
[49:56] but The Prudent are crowned
[49:59] with knowledge
[50:01] all right so there is a type of
[50:04] Simplicity that we want nothing to do
[50:06] with
[50:08] God is what what makes him great is he
[50:11] can become so simple
[50:13] but he never loses the characteristic of
[50:16] God that he is
[50:18] hallelujah because he is all God he is
[50:21] all wise because he's all God he's
[50:24] omnipotent he's omniscient he carries
[50:26] all the attributes of God
[50:28] but yet what makes him special is that
[50:31] he can become so simple
[50:33] and he can bring wisdom on a level
[50:35] that can be what that can be brought to
[50:38] you to you so you can understand it hmm
[50:41] all right
[50:44] the simple inherent Folly but The
[50:45] Prudent are crowned with knowledge
[50:48] there must be a con a connection between
[50:50] Simplicity the simple bad
[50:53] and The Prudent all right
[50:56] now
[50:57] here we go let's begin
[50:59] remember that woman was crying out
[51:01] where we have another woman crying out
[51:05] Proverbs 1 20. wisdom cryeth
[51:09] without
[51:12] she uttereth her voice in the streets
[51:15] wisdom does
[51:18] wisdom is crying out to you
[51:21] wow
[51:26] 21st verse she crieth in the chief place
[51:30] of concourse in the opening of the gates
[51:33] in the city she uttereth her words
[51:35] saying
[51:36] how long ye simple ones will ye love
[51:41] simplicity
[51:45] she's calling for simple ones too
[51:52] and the scorners Delight in their
[51:54] scorning and fools hate
[51:57] knowledge
[52:00] wait wasn't that the bad simple they had
[52:03] no understanding they had no knowledge
[52:04] they didn't know anything
[52:07] so we can be simple
[52:10] and attain to wisdom
[52:12] and that wisdom is the wise version
[52:15] foreign
[52:19] Hallelujah you know what I can I can
[52:21] just quote stuff uh but sometimes it's
[52:23] just better if I read it that definition
[52:25] of wisdom means The Right Use or
[52:27] exercise of knowledge uh jumping on
[52:29] Daniel it is the faculty of discerning
[52:31] or judging what is most just proper and
[52:34] useful and if it is to be considered an
[52:37] acquirement it is the knowledge and use
[52:40] of what is best most just most proper uh
[52:43] most conducive
[52:44] to Prosperity or happiness wisdom in the
[52:48] first sense or practical wisdom is
[52:50] nearly synonymous with discretion it
[52:52] differs somewhat from Prudence in this
[52:54] respect Prudence is the exercise of
[52:57] sound judgment in avoiding evils wisdom
[53:00] is the exercise of sound judgment either
[53:02] in avoiding evils or attempting good
[53:05] so discretion holds you from evil but
[53:08] wisdom holds you from evil and promotes
[53:11] good
[53:15] my
[53:16] Hallelujah
[53:18] you know why I'm saying this stuff
[53:20] because when you read The Book of
[53:21] Proverbs you read the book of Job
[53:24] you find people that I mean just
[53:29] remember these are the people everybody
[53:30] calls cavemen
[53:32] these are people oh they didn't have
[53:33] phones they didn't have Google they
[53:35] didn't have blah blah blah
[53:37] but look at the wisdom that was coming
[53:39] from these people
[53:40] right job had three miserable comforters
[53:45] and job took their wisdom and said
[53:48] you're a miserable comforter
[53:51] it's not that their wisdom was wrong but
[53:53] they were applying it wrong
[53:55] their whole attempt in their wisdom was
[53:58] to show that job was a sinner not fit to
[54:00] not fit to live I mean that he was some
[54:03] secret sinner some evil person
[54:05] but when Joe brought it back around he
[54:08] said if I was in your shoes I would be
[54:10] trying to build strength in me
[54:13] I would be trying to build up the man
[54:15] that's that's down
[54:19] Hallelujah
[54:20] so wisdom without discretion is is no
[54:23] good
[54:25] so it is sound judgment in avoiding
[54:29] evils or attempting good see why wisdom
[54:31] is so important that's why brother Bram
[54:33] said he said it's the first gift of the
[54:35] spirit of the nine spiritual nine
[54:37] spiritual gifts that has to be there he
[54:40] said because the wisdom will judge all
[54:41] the other ones
[54:43] but wait a minute it's a gift of the
[54:45] spirit
[54:46] not how wise you can be it's how wise he
[54:50] can be in you
[54:51] Hallelujah
[54:55] all right all right it continues
[54:58] Proverbs 9 1 wisdom hath build it her
[55:03] house I told you she was a woman
[55:06] I told you
[55:08] she has hewn out her Seven Pillars
[55:13] seven of them
[55:15] I wonder what that is
[55:18] she hath killed her Beast she has
[55:21] mingled her wife she has also furnished
[55:24] her tables she has sent forth her maiden
[55:27] she crieth upon the highest places of
[55:30] the city what is she crying out for who
[55:33] so is simple let him turn in hither amen
[55:39] as for him that wanteth understanding
[55:42] she saith to him come eat my bread and
[55:46] drink of the wine which I have mingled
[55:50] forsake the foolish
[55:53] this is my parentheses same Hebrew word
[55:55] is simple
[55:56] and live
[55:58] and go in the way of understanding
[56:02] so there's a good simple and there's a
[56:05] bad simple
[56:06] but what now notice who is crying out to
[56:09] you tonight
[56:12] wisdom is crying out to you
[56:17] that you could be more wise in your
[56:19] decisions
[56:20] that you could be wise to avoid evil
[56:23] wise to bring forth good
[56:28] there is a Divine form of that that God
[56:31] wants to manifest in his assembly
[56:33] yeah
[56:35] absolutely
[56:37] all right
[56:43] so down in the red there he says we'll
[56:46] just go there it's the commentator is
[56:48] Gilbert he says though it may be these
[56:50] Seven Pillars May denote in general the
[56:52] firmness and solidity of the spiritual
[56:53] building the church the continuance of
[56:55] its power of God or they may have
[56:57] respect to the seven states of the
[56:58] church in so many periods of time to
[57:00] last to the end of all things signified
[57:02] by the seven churches in the Book of
[57:03] Revelations
[57:04] I love it even the mayonnaise had it
[57:07] figured out those sevens always ring
[57:10] right back to the seven Church ages oh
[57:13] it's beautiful
[57:19] all right first Timothy 3 15. how many
[57:21] pillars seven
[57:23] so but if I carry along that thou mayest
[57:25] know how thou Artest to behave thyself
[57:28] in the house of God
[57:29] which is the Church of the Living God
[57:33] the pillar
[57:34] and ground of the truth who's the who's
[57:37] the pillar it's the church
[57:40] it's the ground of Truth too
[57:42] Hallelujah
[57:44] that's what makes the church the church
[57:46] is it has the truth it has Christ there
[57:48] Christ is the truth
[57:49] all right
[57:52] Proverbs 8 1 it says doth not wisdom cry
[57:57] and understanding put forth her voice
[58:01] now think about this
[58:03] if the local bodies were in perfect
[58:06] condition
[58:08] we would be giving wisdom to one another
[58:12] and we would be really benefited of it
[58:17] we would be avoiding a lot of things
[58:19] Hallelujah
[58:23] does not wisdom cry understanding before
[58:26] the voice she's standeth in the top of
[58:28] the high of high places by the way in
[58:30] the place of of the past she crieth at
[58:33] the gates at the entry of the city at
[58:35] the coming in at the doors unto you o
[58:37] man I call and my voice is to the sons
[58:40] of man
[58:42] this is serious
[58:45] oh ye
[58:48] simple
[58:49] understand
[58:50] [Music]
[58:52] wisdom
[58:54] and he falls be of an understanding
[58:58] heart
[58:59] here for I will speak of excellent
[59:01] things and the opening of my lips shall
[59:04] be right things for my mouth shall speak
[59:07] truth and wickedness is an Abomination
[59:09] to my lips
[59:12] hallelujah look at the effort of God to
[59:16] bring wisdom to his church
[59:19] Hallelujah
[59:21] my my wisdom versus faith
[59:24] he says and so the wisdom that I want
[59:27] you to get straightened out on before we
[59:29] start there is a wisdom of God
[59:33] a wisdom of God is stay with his word
[59:39] but Satan and his wisdom tried to twist
[59:44] the word so that's the wisdom I'm
[59:47] speaking of there's a certain amount of
[59:49] faith that goes with Satan in order to
[59:53] accept Satan you got to believe Satan so
[59:56] there is a perverted Faith to a
[59:58] perverted thing
[1:00:00] oh my
[1:00:04] God hallelujah
[1:00:07] to believe a lie you got to have faith
[1:00:11] to put on that lie
[1:00:12] [Laughter]
[1:00:17] I told you it's deep
[1:00:21] hallelujah thank God for a seventh angel
[1:00:26] Hallelujah so there's a perverted faith
[1:00:29] for a perverted thing
[1:00:32] now notice
[1:00:34] that's why the scripture says Paul said
[1:00:37] you know let us let us lay these first
[1:00:40] foundations right
[1:00:41] and if God permit let us go into
[1:00:44] Perfection you know fade towards God and
[1:00:45] and repentance from dead works and all
[1:00:47] these things like that
[1:00:49] so you've got to start somewhere the
[1:00:51] scripture says desire the sincere milk
[1:00:54] of the word
[1:00:55] right
[1:00:57] being babes but then what
[1:01:01] but then strong meat belongeth to him
[1:01:03] that has discernment he's able to
[1:01:06] discern between Good and Evil
[1:01:08] Hallelujah
[1:01:10] so how many people actually should be
[1:01:12] getting meat
[1:01:15] I pray you say right here Glory
[1:01:17] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] that's why we have an issue because if
[1:01:26] deep word goes to babes they choke on it
[1:01:30] if I give my baby Judah I give him big
[1:01:31] hunks a mistake
[1:01:33] that boy is going to be coughing hacking
[1:01:34] and throwing up
[1:01:36] right
[1:01:37] but Paul had the same issue he said in
[1:01:39] time when you should have been the
[1:01:41] teachers you have need to be taught
[1:01:43] again that be the first principles of
[1:01:46] God
[1:01:49] so what is this gospel supposed to do
[1:01:52] it's supposed to become such a love in
[1:01:55] your life
[1:01:57] that you receive it
[1:01:59] and then ye are able to Proclaim that
[1:02:01] gospel too
[1:02:03] amen hallelujah
[1:02:06] God help us
[1:02:09] all right
[1:02:10] continue he says in anything that would
[1:02:12] try to twist the word of God to make it
[1:02:14] say something that it doesn't it's the
[1:02:16] wrong Spirit see
[1:02:18] offering wisdom against God's wisdom so
[1:02:20] we're going to refer to it as wisdom and
[1:02:23] not Satan's faith
[1:02:25] Hallelujah so you have what wisdom
[1:02:28] crying out and then you have what you
[1:02:30] have a false wisdom that's so close but
[1:02:33] it's false
[1:02:35] all right
[1:02:36] you know one of the scariest parts of
[1:02:37] the church age book to me
[1:02:39] as he said he said that the people who
[1:02:42] had their names in The Book of Life he
[1:02:44] said they were part of the message of
[1:02:46] their day
[1:02:47] and he said
[1:02:49] but when this time comes he was talking
[1:02:51] about he's talking about this squeeze
[1:02:53] that's coming
[1:02:55] he said the vast majority of them will
[1:02:57] have their names removed from The Book
[1:02:59] of Life
[1:03:01] because they will deny the truth at that
[1:03:03] time
[1:03:05] I want to be that
[1:03:08] I'm not that glory amen hallelujah we
[1:03:11] better use some faith on this not faith
[1:03:13] for Satan faith for the word amen
[1:03:15] Hallelujah so people that want if they
[1:03:18] have their name in the book
[1:03:21] that doesn't mean it can't be blotted
[1:03:22] out we know there's a Lamb's Book but
[1:03:25] we're showing what we are right now
[1:03:26] we're showing what are we going to do
[1:03:29] with the word
[1:03:31] what are we going to do
[1:03:33] because he's showing us what we can do
[1:03:35] now think about this if wisdom's crying
[1:03:37] out
[1:03:40] where do you have to go
[1:03:42] where she's at
[1:03:44] she's got the table spread
[1:03:45] she's got all set up brother Brandon
[1:03:48] said that wisdom is the word it's got to
[1:03:50] be the word of God
[1:03:52] so see I'm not preaching anything
[1:03:54] contrary to what he said because this is
[1:03:55] the word of God
[1:03:57] see
[1:03:58] watches Psalms 19 7. the law of the Lord
[1:04:01] is perfect converting the soul that's
[1:04:03] that's the truth right
[1:04:05] the testimony of the Lord is sure making
[1:04:09] wise the simple
[1:04:14] Hallelujah so the more wise that you
[1:04:17] want to be get more word
[1:04:21] now this is you know I preached it here
[1:04:23] before about the the wise virgin and the
[1:04:25] foolish and when you go through the
[1:04:26] Bible you have them joined all the time
[1:04:28] in the same in the same scriptures why
[1:04:31] is foosh why is foolish why is foolish
[1:04:33] Proverbs wise foolish why is push you
[1:04:35] have the same thing here
[1:04:37] you have wisdom and simplicity
[1:04:39] where's some Simplicity
[1:04:41] because God is trying to show that
[1:04:43] receiving Christ is not saying glory to
[1:04:46] God God sent a prophet I'm here I got to
[1:04:48] make it now I got the Holy Ghost I
[1:04:50] believe God sent a prophet I sit in
[1:04:52] church no no no no no we are just
[1:04:55] starting a journey amen and moving what
[1:04:59] through the stature of a perfect man
[1:05:00] we've got to complete the work amen
[1:05:04] let me say it like this we want to be so
[1:05:07] simple
[1:05:08] in God's Simplicity that we can have
[1:05:10] nine spiritual gifts here
[1:05:12] you've seen the quote
[1:05:13] oh brother cam I think that was before
[1:05:15] the seals that don't count you better
[1:05:17] look into some wisdom
[1:05:19] Hallelujah
[1:05:22] because it goes to church age book too
[1:05:23] if you look
[1:05:26] Hallelujah Psalms 119 130.
[1:05:29] the entrance of thy words giveth light
[1:05:34] it giveth understanding unto the simple
[1:05:40] so you can say I'm simple I need
[1:05:43] understanding because wisdom is crying
[1:05:46] out to you
[1:05:51] you see what that's why the devil tries
[1:05:53] to make reading the Bible boring because
[1:05:56] all he's really doing is perverting
[1:06:00] what this really is
[1:06:02] remember the spirit is to energize the
[1:06:04] word
[1:06:05] that isn't just when a preacher preaches
[1:06:10] Hallelujah there's your Messiah message
[1:06:12] right there Hallelujah the spirit wants
[1:06:15] to energize the word but he cannot
[1:06:17] energize the word if there's no faith
[1:06:19] put on that word
[1:06:23] Hallelujah
[1:06:26] it's like like I told the Saints the
[1:06:28] other day they that wait upon the Lord
[1:06:30] shall renew their strength
[1:06:33] renew it
[1:06:34] if you wait on God
[1:06:37] there is a potential look up that Hebrew
[1:06:39] word renew it means to bring back to
[1:06:41] full capacity
[1:06:43] you ever been so tired
[1:06:46] so are out
[1:06:49] you don't know what to do
[1:06:52] he said right there that you can wait on
[1:06:54] him and he'll completely renew your
[1:06:55] entire strength
[1:06:57] how many people have been through that
[1:07:01] you know what I'm telling you I'm
[1:07:03] telling you that there's so much power
[1:07:05] in this word of God
[1:07:07] and don't worry we're coming into it
[1:07:09] we're coming into it I ain't coming here
[1:07:11] and saying hey I'm renewed right now no
[1:07:12] I hobbled in here because I played
[1:07:14] dodgeball yesterday
[1:07:15] [Laughter]
[1:07:18] Hallelujah but there is a potential that
[1:07:20] is laying right there
[1:07:22] that you can have a complete
[1:07:24] that's not I mean that's a renewing it
[1:07:26] didn't say that he's well he's only
[1:07:28] going to renew your mind he's only going
[1:07:30] to renew your body no it's a full
[1:07:31] renewal
[1:07:33] both body and mind whoa
[1:07:37] Hallelujah let me do we believe his word
[1:07:40] or not Hallelujah because if it says it
[1:07:43] it doesn't amen
[1:07:45] so God how can we remember we try to
[1:07:48] change God to fit our program
[1:07:50] but we've got to change ourselves to fit
[1:07:52] his program amen
[1:07:54] that's what makes the gospel work
[1:07:57] Hallelujah so the word brings what
[1:07:59] understanding to the simple Proverbs 1 2
[1:08:01] to know wisdom and instruction to
[1:08:03] perceive the words of the understanding
[1:08:05] to receive the instruction of wisdom
[1:08:07] Justice judgment and Equity to give
[1:08:09] subtility
[1:08:12] to the simple
[1:08:15] utility
[1:08:17] to the young man knowledge and
[1:08:21] discretion
[1:08:23] Hallelujah you know what the serpent did
[1:08:27] he was subtle
[1:08:31] Hallelujah
[1:08:33] but wisdom will give you the right
[1:08:36] subtlety
[1:08:38] Watch what it says to give subtlety to
[1:08:43] the simple men of weak abilities weak
[1:08:46] capacities shallow understandings in
[1:08:50] cautious credulous and easy imposed upon
[1:08:53] these by attending to what is here and
[1:08:55] contained may arrive to a serpentine
[1:08:58] subtlety
[1:09:00] oh
[1:09:01] wait a minute didn't Jesus said that you
[1:09:04] should be wise as a serpent but harmless
[1:09:06] as a dove
[1:09:09] nicer than that serpent
[1:09:13] Hallelujah you know they're always them
[1:09:15] serpents are always trying to do tricks
[1:09:17] on you trying to get you all caught up
[1:09:19] did you know that God can move you in
[1:09:21] the same way to get their souls right
[1:09:24] hallelujah amen because you find out
[1:09:27] they weren't serpents after all they
[1:09:29] just needed someone that would yield to
[1:09:30] the subtlety of Jesus Christ
[1:09:33] Hallelujah it says though they are
[1:09:35] simple and harmless as doves they may
[1:09:37] become as wise as serpents May attain to
[1:09:39] the inexquisite knowledge of divine
[1:09:40] things and know even more than the wise
[1:09:42] and Sage philosophers among the Gentiles
[1:09:46] hallelujah oh that sounds like I could
[1:09:49] have a stuffed shirt no that's not what
[1:09:50] we're after
[1:09:52] we're after a gospel that will produce
[1:09:55] this word amen now think about this in
[1:09:59] Proverbs what does it also say it says
[1:10:01] he that is wise win his Souls
[1:10:07] God's wisdom
[1:10:09] the wisdom that's crying out
[1:10:11] for you to come unto her
[1:10:14] Hallelujah
[1:10:16] I hope you're having a good time this
[1:10:19] stuff I just love it I hope you're all
[1:10:20] right because I am all right
[1:10:23] Proverbs 19 25 uh Smite a scorner and
[1:10:27] the simple will beware
[1:10:29] foreign
[1:10:31] and reprove one that hath understanding
[1:10:33] and he will understand knowledge all
[1:10:35] right
[1:10:36] so if you smite a scorner the simple is
[1:10:38] going to beware
[1:10:39] but if you approve one that has
[1:10:41] understanding he will understand
[1:10:42] knowledge
[1:10:44] he'll understand it so he won't do it
[1:10:46] again
[1:10:49] or he won't do what he's seen done
[1:10:52] as far as 21 11.
[1:10:54] it says when the scorner is punished
[1:10:58] the simple is made wise
[1:11:00] and when the wise is instructed he
[1:11:03] receiveth knowledge
[1:11:06] in the age of YouTube and everything
[1:11:08] every now and then the the post a video
[1:11:10] or something you know something silly is
[1:11:12] going on right you might have somebody
[1:11:13] bad mouthing the cop next you know
[1:11:14] they're in jail
[1:11:18] you've got the right type of Simplicity
[1:11:19] on you
[1:11:20] you don't realize you ain't gonna do
[1:11:22] that
[1:11:24] why because you watch
[1:11:27] when someone is punished and you learn
[1:11:29] not to do what they did
[1:11:31] and then you avoid evil
[1:11:33] Hallelujah why do you think God puts
[1:11:35] things in your path
[1:11:36] right
[1:11:38] he puts things your past you can learn
[1:11:39] by the things that are happening in your
[1:11:41] environment
[1:11:43] Hallelujah
[1:11:47] we've got to be almost done here
[1:11:49] yes
[1:11:51] almost done
[1:11:55] Proverbs 127. when your fear cometh as
[1:11:58] desolation
[1:12:00] and your destruction comes as a
[1:12:01] whirlwind when distress and anguish
[1:12:03] cometh upon you then shall they call
[1:12:06] upon me but I will not answer
[1:12:09] they shall seek me early but they shall
[1:12:13] not find me
[1:12:14] for that they hated knowledge
[1:12:19] and did not choose the fear of the Lord
[1:12:21] they would none of my counsel
[1:12:25] and this they despised all my reproof
[1:12:29] therefore shall they eat of the fruit of
[1:12:32] their own way and be filled with their
[1:12:34] own devices we should always consider
[1:12:36] the Lord in all our decisions right in
[1:12:38] everything we see right
[1:12:39] for the Turning Away of the simple
[1:12:43] simple there means wisdom shall slay
[1:12:46] them
[1:12:47] and the prosperity
[1:12:50] of fools shall destroy them but whoso
[1:12:54] hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely
[1:12:57] and shall be quiet from Fear
[1:13:00] of evil amen hallelujah we live in a
[1:13:04] dark and evil age amen and wisdom is
[1:13:08] crying out to us
[1:13:10] to make the path plain Hallelujah hey
[1:13:12] think about it we got a third poll
[1:13:14] coming
[1:13:15] with five identifications amen we got a
[1:13:18] lot of rain fixing to fall amen we got
[1:13:21] spiritual gifts ready to strike the
[1:13:24] church now think about it they're
[1:13:25] already here you are born with them amen
[1:13:30] but God is what trying to get his church
[1:13:32] in position to receive
[1:13:34] that's a humbling thing about this is
[1:13:36] because you look at yourself and you're
[1:13:37] like you smack yourself because you're
[1:13:39] like oh God
[1:13:40] he made gift so simple that there's no
[1:13:43] excuse I don't have them
[1:13:47] who am I
[1:13:50] so
[1:13:55] yes
[1:13:56] we're good amen
[1:13:59] so that Turning Away of the simple
[1:14:01] wisdom has called the simple to turn
[1:14:03] they had turned but it was away from her
[1:14:07] prosperity
[1:14:09] read carelessness not outward Prosperity
[1:14:11] but the temper which it too often
[1:14:14] produces the easy going indifference to
[1:14:16] higher truths is that which destroys oh
[1:14:19] my
[1:14:21] Hallelujah there's two women crying out
[1:14:23] now I could have spent a lot more time
[1:14:25] on on the the bad one
[1:14:28] but we have to be able to discern
[1:14:30] between the voices
[1:14:33] remember that's a lot of that stuff's
[1:14:34] natural but it's speaking of the
[1:14:36] spiritual that we must receive and James
[1:14:38] 1 says what I say a lot when I'm here
[1:14:41] that says if you lack Wisdom ask God who
[1:14:45] giveth it
[1:14:46] what liberally
[1:14:48] Hallelujah but let a man ask in faith
[1:14:51] foreign
[1:14:52] you have to believe
[1:14:55] that God wants you to have it and that
[1:14:58] he's going to give it
[1:15:01] Hallelujah she's healed now Seven
[1:15:03] Pillars brother sister let's stand up
[1:15:05] we're good thank you
[1:15:23] Hallelujah
[1:15:26] well we love the Lord Brother sister
[1:15:28] we're so glad we could have a day
[1:15:30] together in the word amen tonight is
[1:15:34] tonight was in it was a moving on the
[1:15:36] individual level
[1:15:39] you know because it always comes to pass
[1:15:41] that you know what
[1:15:44] we can hear that we're the bride we can
[1:15:46] hear glory to God we can we can we can
[1:15:49] run through a troop and leap a wall we
[1:15:51] can do all these things
[1:15:53] but then when you look at something like
[1:15:55] that
[1:15:56] you're like but God wants me to have
[1:16:00] such a move of wisdom in my life in
[1:16:02] simplicity
[1:16:07] that I can be wise
[1:16:10] as a virgin for Christ ready for this
[1:16:12] rapture I know we're going to need it
[1:16:14] brother sister I know we are I believe
[1:16:16] that's why it's the Cry of the heart
[1:16:18] amen it's one of those Mysteries that's
[1:16:19] locked right in Proverbs you see two
[1:16:21] women crying out choose the right one
[1:16:23] this one looks like a Harley she is a
[1:16:25] heart you better stay away from her boy
[1:16:28] Hallelujah stay with the word amen
[1:16:31] hallelujah

[1:16:35] musician we're saying a word of prayer

[1:16:51] little simple message oh God but Lord
[1:16:53] how how it's so great to watch the word
[1:16:57] expound upon itself Lord and to see the
[1:17:00] picture you're trying to get your
[1:17:02] children into oh God is that they could
[1:17:04] express a discernment of God not just to
[1:17:08] know what the evil is but to know the
[1:17:09] good is and oh God you said that when
[1:17:12] the church can discern the two spirits
[1:17:14] in the framework of the church
[1:17:16] and know who she is oh God she'd be an
[1:17:19] invincible Army Lord so we're looking
[1:17:20] for those things even now but Lord we

[1:17:25] we don't come asking to be smart or to
[1:17:28] figure it out we're just coming oh God
[1:17:29] because wisdom is crying out Lord and
[1:17:33] Lord we want to receive what you'd have
[1:17:36] of us oh God it'll come through your

[1:17:54] your spirit God knowing first we must
[1:17:57] receive this Holy Ghost oh God
[1:17:59] it may go from birth to birth in every
[1:18:01] life
[1:18:02] and Lord we're just so glad that we
[1:18:04] could be here today Lord I pray as I
[1:18:06] leave this place oh God
[1:18:08] that Lord you would raise this church up
[1:18:11] stronger than ever before working for
[1:18:14] your Will O God that the presence of God
[1:18:17] would be moving mightily as they discern
[1:18:20] that false spirit in the midst of God
[1:18:22] and as a yield To You O God and begin oh
[1:18:25] God more and more to let you Prevail in
