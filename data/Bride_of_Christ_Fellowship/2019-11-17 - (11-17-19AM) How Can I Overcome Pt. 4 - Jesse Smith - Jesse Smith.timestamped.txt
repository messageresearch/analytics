[35:15] one praise God to get our lives to one
[35:19] who is worthy praise God Amen let's go
[35:23] to first John chapter 4 like to take our
[35:30] text from first John 4 verse 1 we're
[35:44] willing I'd like to finish this little
[35:46] series on how can I overcome so this
[35:48] morning we like to do part 4 first on
[35:51] chapter 4 verse 1 even had people from
[35:56] other states you know reach out and say
[35:58] I really enjoy your series on how can I
[36:00] overcome I said well it's not mine it's
[36:03] the Lord's thank the Lord for that
[36:05] so anyone gets blessed it's all glory to
[36:07] the Lord Jesus Christ he is worthy
[36:09] praise God
[36:11] he's worthy of this our lives given as a
[36:14] sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord
[36:16] first John chapter 4 like to greet
[36:19] everybody the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[36:21] good to be with you and worship just
[36:28] want to make sure I got the prayer
[36:29] requests okay
[36:36] by the grace of Lord I'd like to start
[36:39] at verse 1 I'll read for a few verses
[36:45] then we'll read verse 4 together very
[36:48] familiar passage here I'd like to read
[36:52] verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit
[36:54] but try the spirits whether they are of
[37:00] God because many false prophets are gone
[37:03] out into the world
[37:04] I remember in Galatians 1 Paul puts
[37:07] himself in that group
[37:08] he said if I or an angel or we teach
[37:12] anything other than what was first
[37:14] taught let it be accursed
[37:16] so this means we test every preacher we
[37:20] test everyone who comes to our door we
[37:23] test everything we see on YouTube
[37:24] everything we see on there we test
[37:26] everything by the word verse 2 hereby
[37:31] know ye the Spirit of God every spirit
[37:35] that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
[37:37] come in the flesh is of God and every
[37:44] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[37:46] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[37:49] God and that is the spirit of Antichrist
[37:53] whereof you have heard that it should
[37:56] come and even now already it is I'm
[38:00] sorry is it in the world this was
[38:02] written after 1890 right so this is 60
[38:06] years after the Holy Ghost fell and
[38:08] John's assuring them it's already out in
[38:10] the world now let's read verse 4 it
[38:13] together one two three ye are of God
[38:17] little children and have overcome them
[38:20] because greater is He that is in you
[38:24] than he that is in the world let's have
[38:27] a word of Prayer as we bow our heads
[38:28] here Heavenly Father we love you today
[38:30] Lord and we're just happy to be
[38:32] worshiping one who is worthy none of us
[38:36] are worthy we all fall short of the
[38:38] glory our righteousness of our own
[38:40] selves is as filthy rags Lord we are
[38:43] trusting in your righteousness
[38:45] and lower we overcome by your power
[38:47] within us by simply yielding our will by
[38:51] simply doing what you you'd like us to
[38:54] do because we know know what's best for
[38:57] us to do Lord God and Lord you would
[39:00] never lead us in a way that would be
[39:01] wrong or selfish Lord or or or and
[39:05] anything at all Lord that would be evil
[39:07] but you always lead us into
[39:08] righteousness Lord and so we're happy to
[39:11] yield our lives to you help us today to
[39:13] yield again Lord each day we die daily
[39:16] help us Lord God to you to you that we
[39:18] might be overcomers or we want to be
[39:21] part of that group that inherits all
[39:22] seven rewards Lord God as overcomers
[39:26] help us today Jesus Lord God to hear
[39:28] your voice Lord move amongst us as we
[39:31] just saying may this be one of those
[39:33] services Lord where we can say Lord and
[39:36] ever as every service should be that
[39:38] you're moving amongst us Lord that
[39:40] you're moving in our lives that you're
[39:42] moving in the lives of the saints Lord
[39:44] God granite we pray and father anoint us
[39:46] now for your service the speaker and
[39:48] they here in Jesus Christ's name and the
[39:50] church said Amen god bless you see the
[39:53] praise God
[39:58] so I was back to a case you could just
[40:02] switch over I just have a few things I
[40:04] want to share here by God's grace I just
[40:08] want to give a little update you know
[40:09] this week I uploaded my our latest video
[40:13] you can see it there in the corner it's
[40:15] hell is not eternal and I don't know if
[40:18] you can see the numbers there but it's
[40:19] doing really well it's it's just
[40:21] interesting to see what people are
[40:22] feeding on out of the last 10 uploads
[40:27] it's number one so it's neat to see that
[40:29] and the views are up 122 percent the
[40:32] average durations up ninety nine percent
[40:34] and the watch I'm is up four hundred
[40:37] sixty four percent so it's neat so if I
[40:40] just click that maybe you can see it so
[40:42] Hal's not eternal is first wise of
[40:45] foolish virgins second abomination in
[40:47] the Bible do the Ten Commandments apply
[40:50] to Christians predestination the new
[40:52] book I just released about the new book
[40:55] a video about that ministry updates
[40:58] Revelation chapter 14 and then home
[41:00] church part 3 it's just interesting to
[41:02] see what God does with that I just heard
[41:07] brother Adam say actually I was on the
[41:09] message thirst brother ran thank the
[41:10] Lord that they could do phone hookups
[41:12] through the phone and he was he said
[41:14] what a blessing it is and now we got
[41:17] Internet you know what a blessing that
[41:18] is that people wandering all that maybe
[41:21] they went from this bad video to that
[41:23] bad video but maybe the Holy Spirit
[41:24] directed them to our videos praise God
[41:26] and just it could be a great blessing if
[41:29] we use it for God's glory we're up to
[41:31] nine thousand four hundred subscribers
[41:34] and we almost have nine hundred thousand
[41:36] views so when we get to a million I
[41:39] don't know I'm gonna do something about
[41:40] that but that'll be here is to think a
[41:43] little church like ours with a million
[41:44] views you know so we're just thankful
[41:47] just want to update you on that and Lord
[41:49] willing today we'll be looking at how
[41:51] can I overcome brother Branham
[41:52] emphasizes lilies so I'm just gonna
[41:54] leave this picture up here well that's
[41:55] kind of the thought I'm gonna get to
[41:57] it's just the waterlily this is a major
[41:59] thought he deals with here in the in the
[42:03] text and so I want to get to that sister
[42:06] Connie's live streaming Lord bless you
[42:08] sister Connie praise the Lord so let's
[42:14] let's go back here to our text here I
[42:17] want to make a few beginning statements
[42:20] here and I want to just review real
[42:23] quick just to kind of give you a little
[42:26] background again about this sermon I
[42:28] don't know if you listen to it lately
[42:30] but bro Graham said that he got this
[42:31] thought from another Minister and he
[42:35] said it wasn't a message minister and
[42:37] that's why I like I like how brother
[42:39] Branham always models apostolic
[42:43] apostolic order I'll say like that so
[42:46] brother Adam could listen to other
[42:48] preachers and he could pull thoughts
[42:50] from them even though they didn't
[42:51] believe the message because he talks
[42:53] about he believed in divine healing the
[42:55] the preacher that he heard it from he
[42:57] said but he didn't disagree he didn't he
[42:59] didn't agree with everything brother Ram
[43:00] said he said I like a man like that
[43:02] who's got a backbone he said but I like
[43:06] that and that's how you and I you know
[43:07] that's how we are too we can be blessed
[43:09] by talking to anybody right
[43:11] because we can see how God works through
[43:13] each individual and whether they're
[43:16] Methodist Baptist or what a Jewish I
[43:18] have a little Jewish girl my class and I
[43:21] can I can even appreciate things that
[43:24] she says because it's coming down to
[43:27] their holidays in fact we just pressed
[43:28] Rosh Hashanah and she took a whole week
[43:30] off her family took a week off to
[43:32] worship the Lord and she was memorizing
[43:35] the Torah and I say praise the Lord you
[43:37] know that's our God our God is the God
[43:39] of the Torah
[43:40] he's just advanced praise the Lord and
[43:43] so I liked how brother Graham could do
[43:46] that and he just didn't listen to his
[43:48] own sermons he could listen to any
[43:51] preacher and he could see the thought
[43:54] that God wanted to get to him right and
[43:57] so that's what this message came from
[44:00] and he preached this the morning and
[44:01] then the evening he preached perfect
[44:02] faith for a healing service thought was
[44:06] a great combination of sermons right we
[44:09] need to overcome so we can have perfect
[44:11] faith because we can't have perfect
[44:13] faith unless we overcome sins that we're
[44:15] battling right now
[44:16] praise God what a beautiful combination
[44:20] of topics there that the Holy Spirit
[44:22] gave to our prophet and so he starts it
[44:27] off again just wrote I just want to go
[44:29] real briefly he talks about how we've
[44:31] got to overcome in Laodicea that's where
[44:34] he starts and we have one purpose in
[44:36] Laodicea that's to overcome and many
[44:38] people are getting Dodi or lazy on the
[44:41] Lord but we've got to be about the
[44:43] Father's business praise God he types
[44:50] the elect from the non elect and God
[44:53] always has overcomers and then he starts
[44:55] with Noah and we looked at that in part
[44:58] one and then part two we looked at
[45:00] Daniel as an overcomer the next was
[45:04] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and then
[45:07] in part three we looked at lot as an
[45:10] overcomer and his two daughters and we
[45:13] ended that that message remember a
[45:16] couple Wednesday nights ago by looking
[45:17] at the life of brother Mike durdle
[45:19] remembering our precious brother who
[45:21] overcame the spirit of Sodom and
[45:23] Gomorrah all right
[45:24] doing both here today alright praise the
[45:25] Lord so he overcame now for those who
[45:28] didn't hear it my girdle was a wonderful
[45:30] brother he went to brother Jonathan
[45:33] Martin's Church in Lima used to be
[45:36] brother Brooks's Church and brother
[45:38] Craig brewer's church and he overcame
[45:41] homosexuality what a beautiful testimony
[45:43] of overcoming the sin of homosexuality
[45:47] praise God and you can say if you met
[45:50] him you could say I knew somebody who
[45:51] came out of Sodom praise the Lord
[45:53] now remember of course the Bible said
[45:55] any spiritual fornication is Sodom right
[45:59] it's a it's an evil thing in other words
[46:01] we all came out of Sodom somehow praise
[46:04] God we all came out of some sin but this
[46:06] man was in the actual physical sins of
[46:10] Sodom Gomorrah and he was an overcomer
[46:12] in church I believe there's a great
[46:14] crown in heaven awaiting him praise the
[46:16] Lord because he left that and he chose
[46:18] to suffer right escape the pleasures of
[46:23] sin for a season amen that he might
[46:25] suffer with the Lord's righteous view
[46:27] praise the Lord amen like Moses of old
[46:30] amen and like lot and his daughters how
[46:33] they overcame Sodom and Gomorrah and so
[46:36] coming now to this point here I told you
[46:38] I go real fast that's our review real
[46:40] fast next program mentions this now I
[46:44] don't know where he got this thought
[46:45] perhaps he got it from the preacher who
[46:47] he heard the message from but he said in
[46:49] the days of John the Baptist he said
[46:51] there were six over comers now of course
[46:55] you know there was actually more than
[46:57] that right because what about all the
[46:58] people John baptized but brother I was
[47:01] making a point that if you look at the
[47:03] days of John the Baptist's and before
[47:05] Christ the Bible highlights six of them
[47:08] so that's what brother Ram is saying
[47:10] there we know there was more say than
[47:12] just six but the Bible highlights six of
[47:15] them and six is the number of man now we
[47:18] looked at that last year and we showed
[47:20] clearly through the Bible that six
[47:22] doesn't just mean bad parts of man it
[47:24] also represents the good parts of man
[47:26] because when God made Adam he was a
[47:29] perfect man praise God he was in the
[47:31] stature of the fullness of a godly man
[47:34] but then he chose to fall from it in
[47:36] order to redeem his wife praise
[47:38] and he willingly disobeyed the word of
[47:40] God but he was anointed when God made
[47:44] him he was anointed praise God and of
[47:46] course you remember the six pieces of
[47:49] the the armour of God praise the Lord
[47:51] there six amen not seven there six
[47:53] because it's what man needs to be fully
[47:56] anointed by God's Spirit hallelujah and
[47:59] so Rob Ram listen he said in John the
[48:02] Baptist I'm we found six had overcome
[48:05] and he said notice a man a woman a man a
[48:09] woman because he names he names
[48:11] Joseph Mary and then Zacharias Elizabeth
[48:15] Simeon and Anna he said man woman man
[48:19] and a woman he said see it's Christ and
[48:21] the church Christ and the church Christ
[48:24] and the church phrase God that's an
[48:26] interesting type I like that one praise
[48:29] the Lord he said but now notice he said
[48:32] look at the men he said look at the men
[48:34] Joseph was a carpenter he said and then
[48:37] Zacharias is a priest and then Simeon is
[48:42] a prophet so Brougham sees the
[48:44] progression of greater calling right or
[48:47] higher cuz I have this higher
[48:49] responsibility
[48:50] I shouldn't say greater calling forgive
[48:53] me everybody has a great calling the
[48:55] Bible said it's your high calling Amen
[48:58] with some callings have more
[49:01] responsibility and so they get a greater
[49:03] reward but they also if failed they get
[49:06] a greater punishment praise God and then
[49:11] brother brother man makes that statement
[49:12] I want to find this in Scripture where
[49:14] he said our sisters will get a greater
[49:16] reward than some brothers because they
[49:19] forsaken more so I want to find that in
[49:20] Scripture if any of you have a clue on
[49:22] that let me know many because many times
[49:25] sure yeah you know the Holy Spirit will
[49:26] bring it to you but then also there's
[49:28] great resources like them the like the
[49:32] encyclopedias and the reference books
[49:34] from the days of like Martin Luther
[49:38] so like the Bible dictionaries if you
[49:40] look up a scripture it'll give you a
[49:42] list of like twenty others that all say
[49:43] the same thing like Tory's topical
[49:47] textbook there's all these nice tools
[49:49] that we can use and we can benefit from
[49:50] the sacrifices
[49:52] of men that have labored in the word
[49:54] their entire lives we reap the benefits
[49:56] of their labors amen because it all ties
[49:59] together the bible does we said notice
[50:04] and he said these three carpenter priest
[50:07] prophet he said represent justification
[50:10] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[50:12] amen
[50:13] that's very interesting now I can't
[50:16] really explain that other than by saying
[50:18] that each one is a greater
[50:20] responsibility than the other right we
[50:23] all want to be faithful at our job don't
[50:25] want to be faithful in the job this week
[50:26] I don't want to get fired for being a
[50:28] bad worker because I neglected my
[50:30] responsibilities I want to do my
[50:32] responsibility and I want to be a
[50:34] shining light of Christ while I'm doing
[50:35] it but then there's a higher role than
[50:38] that working out in the man's world
[50:40] right and man's economy there's a higher
[50:43] calling there's a higher responsibility
[50:45] than that and that's serving in the
[50:47] house of God amen
[50:49] it's even more responsibility but then a
[50:53] beyond that is being an interpreter of
[50:55] the word because a prophet is who the
[50:59] Word of God comes to praise the Lord
[51:02] and so that's an even higher
[51:04] responsibility to make sure you say only
[51:07] what God says as Balaam found out you
[51:10] only do what God tells you to do praise
[51:13] God the first time you ask a man right
[51:17] and so those three pairs three pairs man
[51:23] woman man woman of course Simeon and
[51:25] Anna I don't I don't believe we're
[51:27] married I don't believe so I could be
[51:28] wrong on that does anyone can correct me
[51:30] on that real quick okay I didn't think
[51:33] they were but but notice and here's the
[51:37] thought I had noticed each of these six
[51:39] had a ministry what was Joseph and
[51:42] Mary's to instruct and lead Jesus they
[51:46] had to tell him what to do because
[51:47] remember we looked at that what do we
[51:48] talk about last Sunday night Jesus
[51:50] Christ the only scripture that went that
[51:54] described his life from 12 year old to
[51:56] 30 was that he was in subjection to his
[51:59] parents for 18 years and church that
[52:02] will be the proof that you and I are
[52:04] truly led by the Holy Spirit well
[52:06] we are subject to every word of God
[52:08] those who are discipline remember what
[52:10] does Enoch mean does it mean emotional
[52:12] no this Enoch mean excitable no there's
[52:16] Enoch mean current charismatic no Enoch
[52:19] means disciplined Amen hallelujah praise
[52:22] the Lord he was disciplined to the world
[52:25] Amen he obeyed the word that's why God
[52:28] said you want to come home you want to
[52:29] leave all that behind and come up with
[52:30] me you live so true to me we've had such
[52:33] a good relationship you've been walking
[52:34] with me all these years why don't you
[52:36] just come on up to heaven Amen that's
[52:39] right church amen
[52:41] it's the discipline it's Jesus being
[52:44] disciplined to the word overcoming Amen
[52:47] hallelujah obeying every word of God
[52:49] hallelujah God loved it so much he said
[52:52] come walk with me praise the Lord omma
[52:55] but see each had a ministry Joseph and
[52:58] Mary had to instruct the word right the
[53:01] little boy the word they had to give him
[53:03] an direction and he had to obey now of
[53:07] course we know he they failed that they
[53:08] had at least a fail one time in their
[53:10] parenting but Jesus always kept the word
[53:13] but they had a ministry that to feed and
[53:16] protect him and minister to him when he
[53:18] was sick right and take care of him and
[53:23] Zacharias his ministry was a priest
[53:26] Elizabeth was a homemaker and we know
[53:29] that because brother Graham said the
[53:30] only way that angel could visit
[53:32] Zacharias and the temple was because
[53:34] they were praying in their home so
[53:37] Elizabeth was keeping the home pure from
[53:40] any sin and because she did that and
[53:43] because Zacharias was living clean and
[53:46] keeping his priestly duties the angel
[53:48] could visit Zacharias and answer their
[53:50] prayer for a baby praise God amen it
[53:55] could bring fruit to the barren woman
[53:57] why because they always wanted to walk
[53:59] with Jesus they were disciplined to the
[54:01] word oh yes angels visited them because
[54:07] of their faithfulness they're overcoming
[54:10] now I find it striking - he was even
[54:13] working inside of the denominational
[54:16] system of that day and he still becau to
[54:19] overcome
[54:20] ah that's striking just like lot was the
[54:24] overcomer as a foolish virgin so see
[54:27] there's levels of over covering there's
[54:29] the foolish virgin over covering right
[54:31] where they turn down the denominational
[54:33] spirit of the Antichrist spear but they
[54:35] still stay in their ministries but then
[54:36] there's the wise virgins overcomer who
[54:39] comes out of all of it and obeys all of
[54:41] it and live separate under God just like
[54:44] their father Abraham amen
[54:47] so see Zacharias was an overcomer
[54:50] despite being part of the denominational
[54:53] system of that day because he didn't
[54:55] follow it right he didn't follow their
[54:57] Creed's he just did what the word said
[54:59] hey man he kept offering sacrifice right
[55:02] there right you know going in the Holy
[55:04] of Holies in the holy place I don't know
[55:05] if he went actually I don't think he
[55:07] went the holiest of Holies cuz he wasn't
[55:08] the high priest but he went in the holy
[55:10] place and he kept offering faithful
[55:11] sacrifice year after year and God
[55:13] honored him by giving him a child amen
[55:16] and not just a child a prophet Amen
[55:20] thank the Lord
[55:22] now the next thought program does is
[55:24] upon Lily a type of a Christian
[55:28] overcomer by saying as overcomer he says
[55:37] you are born defeated and that birth can
[55:42] never bring you to life because you're
[55:45] born defeated you're born in a defeated
[55:47] world amongst the feet of people amongst
[55:50] defeated Creed's amongst the feet of
[55:52] denominations you've got to come to
[55:54] victory some way says Amen but any man
[55:58] that we look around us sister Karen we
[56:00] look around us everyone's defeated I'm
[56:03] not talking bout in here we ought to be
[56:05] overcomers in here you ought to look
[56:07] around see some overcomers around you
[56:09] when we look around in our families you
[56:11] know we look around in our homes and you
[56:13] know friends and work and socially and
[56:15] everything's defeated you see everyone
[56:18] bowing to Satan right you see everyone
[56:20] bowing to the world but as I said the
[56:22] major sin of this day is worldliness
[56:25] they're bowing to be like the world
[56:27] we've got we've got to reject the
[56:30] invitation to be like the world and
[56:32] we've got to be like Christ
[56:34] we've got to be godly if we're gonna
[56:35] overcome we must be like Christ
[56:39] there's defeat all around us and so
[56:44] we've got to be the one some way we got
[56:46] to find a way to overcome despite all
[56:50] the defeat around us all the other the
[56:53] negativity all the whining and self-pity
[56:55] that we see around us we've got to find
[56:58] some way and thank God Jesus said I am
[57:01] the way amen oh yes he says like a lily
[57:05] it's one of the most prettiest flowers
[57:08] that there is I'm very fond of those
[57:10] great calla lilies and pond lily I think
[57:12] there's nothing hardly as pretty as a
[57:14] great big pond lily how its radiance
[57:20] that look radiant where does it come
[57:25] from it's a little seed down in the
[57:28] bottom of a muddy mucky pond and that
[57:31] little seed yet all the radiance that'll
[57:35] ever shine in it is in it right then
[57:38] when it's down in that mud but it has to
[57:42] strive daily knowing that there is
[57:45] something he said when it starts it's
[57:48] black it's dirty it's mucky its slimy in
[57:53] that slime that's living in yet it
[57:55] presses its way through the mud the muck
[57:58] the waters and the stagnant places until
[58:02] it sticks its head above in the light
[58:04] and expresses what's been hid in it all
[58:07] the time
[58:08] amen thank the Lord amen mine and if you
[58:14] don't know the joy of sticking your head
[58:16] above this world and the waters of this
[58:18] world I encourage you keep pressing keep
[58:21] pressing and the things of God keep
[58:23] overcoming and one day your little head
[58:25] will pop up above it and you'll be able
[58:27] to see that I'm above it and you'll
[58:29] really realize that you're in the light
[58:32] of Christ amen
[58:33] you'll finally see it clearly for not
[58:36] just through the waters through the muck
[58:38] but you will see the light of Jesus
[58:40] Christ and you'll be able to not guess
[58:42] you'll know you're walking in the light
[58:45] amen
[58:46] that's what the beauty of this message
[58:48] is and this the message that we believe
[58:49] that God gave to brother Branham we know
[58:52] we're walking light because every word
[58:54] in this Bible every doctor in this Bible
[58:56] we can say we don't have to put it off
[58:58] and say oh we don't believe that that's
[59:00] for the days of old we don't put it off
[59:02] like that but we apply it to our lives
[59:04] and we know we're walking obedience
[59:07] because the Bible taught it to us
[59:09] and we obey thus saith the Lord oh my
[59:12] thought I get a lot of shot than that
[59:14] praise God can somebody give me a loud a
[59:16] man out there you're walking in the Lord
[59:20] Amen you ought to have a sunburn you're
[59:22] in so much light Amen it ought to be
[59:25] burning upon you already enjoying it
[59:28] you ought to put your sunglasses on
[59:29] because it's so bright you're not in the
[59:32] muck
[59:32] you're the light Amen hallelujah
[59:35] thankful I'm in the light hallelujah
[59:39] everything slimy all the dirty things
[59:42] you used to think and do other mucky
[59:45] relationship you used to be in you're
[59:47] above that now you're living above that
[59:49] that's the things of the past I'm no
[59:51] longer of that life I've cross the line
[59:55] praise God
[59:56] I've gone above those things I'm living
[59:58] a higher life in Christ he said I think
[1:00:02] that's an overcomer once in sin once
[1:00:05] they're the things that was wrong don't
[1:00:07] worry about it now I'm gonna have to
[1:00:12] worry about anybody catching me smoking
[1:00:13] cigarettes anymore or catching me
[1:00:17] watching the wrong movies anymore like I
[1:00:19] used to
[1:00:19] I'm glad I don't the word see because
[1:00:22] these things are their way their way
[1:00:23] below me their way away
[1:00:27] those are things of the past praise God
[1:00:29] those are far far below me there they're
[1:00:33] part of my past but that's not where I'm
[1:00:36] living anymore praise God amen once I
[1:00:41] did things that was wrong now why look
[1:00:44] back into the pond again look up amen
[1:00:48] praise God
[1:00:49] I used to open my I go swimming under
[1:00:53] the pond all the time on the water I
[1:00:54] opened up my eyes so much I think it
[1:00:56] messed up my eyes I was wanting to see
[1:00:58] the dirt you know and see the bottom of
[1:01:00] the pie
[1:01:00] I think that messed up my eyes and
[1:01:02] brother said we got to be like that
[1:01:04] spiritually azipod Lily don't look back
[1:01:07] to the things of the world and want to
[1:01:08] look around under there you know what it
[1:01:10] is it's mucky it's dirty it's gonna get
[1:01:13] you filthy it's gonna be leading to
[1:01:15] death he said look up look up to heaven
[1:01:18] look up set your affection on things
[1:01:20] above a man set your heart and pleasures
[1:01:23] on heaven amen he said neither did you
[1:01:29] and your sin your adultery everything
[1:01:30] you lived in you didn't express nothing
[1:01:33] but there was a seed in there and it got
[1:01:36] a chance to press itself into light and
[1:01:38] now you're in the presence of Jesus
[1:01:40] Christ with the Sun of light I'm sorry
[1:01:43] with the sunlight he said it brought you
[1:01:46] out of what you really was in in the
[1:01:47] beginning you see what I mean you saw
[1:01:49] the light you bloomed out you laid your
[1:01:51] heart open and now you're a lily
[1:01:55] remember my sermon on the lily program
[1:01:58] said Reverend Lily sir program likens a
[1:02:00] lily to a preacher of course but it's
[1:02:03] all of us and yet does he said how he
[1:02:05] toils and yet he does not spin yet
[1:02:09] solomon all's glory is not arrayed like
[1:02:11] one of these he said look at him he
[1:02:14] takes nothing for himself a lily don't
[1:02:17] care nothing about himself
[1:02:21] now I had to look that up in his urn in
[1:02:23] the science and I'll share in just a
[1:02:24] minute he says what does he do he throws
[1:02:28] his beauty out his life that others
[1:02:31] might see his life is expressed out that
[1:02:34] others might see the glory what's in him
[1:02:36] that was in him in the mud now he's on
[1:02:40] top can I just make a statement here see
[1:02:45] you and I got to open up and we got to
[1:02:47] share our testimonies with others praise
[1:02:50] God we got to open up to people that may
[1:02:53] were uncomfortable opening we got to be
[1:02:56] just got to be more free to share things
[1:02:59] now of course we got to pray before we
[1:03:01] do it because we don't want to glorify
[1:03:04] Satan or you know tell things that
[1:03:06] someone might do damage against us or
[1:03:08] something like that but see as this what
[1:03:10] program's going to get to a little bit
[1:03:11] they've got to open themselves up and
[1:03:13] show
[1:03:14] glory of what was in them from the
[1:03:16] beginning and church the only glory
[1:03:19] anyone's gonna see in you and I is the
[1:03:22] love of Christ the mercy of Christ the
[1:03:26] power of Christ the character of Christ
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:29] the word of Christ all these things
[1:03:31] that's the only beauty that we have is
[1:03:34] what God put in us while we were in the
[1:03:38] while we were yet sinners right he had
[1:03:40] at the end of testimony for us and
[1:03:43] program said that's the overcomer he
[1:03:47] overcome the things of the world he
[1:03:49] freely gives himself out everybody can
[1:03:51] look at him his life now look at this
[1:03:54] you can't put a finger on it see when
[1:03:57] he's at work you can't put a finger on
[1:03:59] him there he's found the Word of God
[1:04:00] like Daniel oh they said we're gonna
[1:04:03] change these laws so he can't pray but
[1:04:06] they couldn't put a finger on his life
[1:04:07] he wasn't anything evil so they had to
[1:04:09] change the laws to get him to do evil
[1:04:10] but it wasn't evil OHS good they
[1:04:14] couldn't put a finger at work oh you're
[1:04:16] not doing this this at work no they
[1:04:18] couldn't do that they couldn't go to the
[1:04:20] church to say you're not doing this at
[1:04:21] church they couldn't put a finger and
[1:04:23] say here see was he was so he was so
[1:04:26] much into the light they look at this
[1:04:28] you can't find any book can you find any
[1:04:30] blemish in this you can't put it because
[1:04:33] it's in the light it's fully manifesting
[1:04:36] the character of its seed life amen and
[1:04:39] see when we when we fully manifest
[1:04:42] Christ the Bible says they see that will
[1:04:46] people won't be able the Bible say that
[1:04:48] will be blamed on that same and that's
[1:04:49] the word I'm looking for
[1:04:50] Amen you're blameless the Bible said
[1:04:53] live blameless
[1:04:54] amongst all men that just came to me now
[1:04:57] I didn't have them my notes blameless oh
[1:05:00] you're blameless at work you're
[1:05:02] blameless at home you're blameless of
[1:05:04] the church you're blameless because the
[1:05:06] life of Christ is your expressing his
[1:05:09] life you're living his life he's a real
[1:05:14] overcomer you can't say nothing about
[1:05:16] him say he cause you can say is he come
[1:05:19] out of the mud amen but he's not in the
[1:05:23] mud now he's on top of it Amen you can't
[1:05:26] now
[1:05:27] back what he was what is he now he's on
[1:05:30] top church where are you at is the devil
[1:05:34] on top of you beating you down and
[1:05:36] getting you addicted to worldly things
[1:05:38] is the devil on top or are you on top as
[1:05:41] the overcomers we're on top praise God
[1:05:45] we're on top of worldliness on top of
[1:05:48] pride we overcome agar and bitterness
[1:05:52] and fear and lust we overcome all these
[1:05:55] things we've got to be on top remember
[1:05:57] the Bible said that God will bruise
[1:06:00] Satan shortly under your feet amen oh
[1:06:03] yeah and the mud is underneath the lily
[1:06:08] the lily is the overcomer he overcame
[1:06:12] all of that and he freely gives out his
[1:06:14] beauty he said then the bee comes by and
[1:06:22] says that's wonderful perfume I believe
[1:06:26] I'll go and get my part Stinger right a
[1:06:31] creature of stinging you ever got stung
[1:06:33] by anybody but you guys see people that
[1:06:37] although they're gonna hurt me again
[1:06:38] they're gonna so you got to be able to
[1:06:40] manifest Christ and I'll say like this
[1:06:43] you got to control the situation so you
[1:06:45] don't get stung like that little you got
[1:06:49] to so manifest that see if you got a
[1:06:51] temper of course they're gonna fight
[1:06:53] back at you you're gonna get stung
[1:06:54] you're all closed up but if you open up
[1:06:57] and show the glory of Christ that bees
[1:07:00] not going to come around this thing that
[1:07:01] bees gonna come to get some love from
[1:07:03] you that bees gonna come ask you for
[1:07:07] prayer amen
[1:07:08] not pick a fight with you and even if
[1:07:10] they do you can shine the light of the
[1:07:12] God and you can change their motive
[1:07:14] right taking them from a fighting spirit
[1:07:16] to a humble spirit so you just open up
[1:07:21] your heart he said I believe I'll go and
[1:07:22] get my part but see the thing we gotta
[1:07:25] do is make sure we're opened up how do
[1:07:27] you open up you gotta pray in the
[1:07:29] morning you got to read your Bible in
[1:07:30] the morning you got to walk in the
[1:07:32] spirit praise God you got to be open up
[1:07:35] for business that's what I feel like
[1:07:38] every time I go to the class
[1:07:40] two kids are like 22 little bees coming
[1:07:42] to take some of my strength they all got
[1:07:46] to come and get their hugs and I gotta
[1:07:47] come and get their attention look what I
[1:07:49] did today and looking they all want to
[1:07:51] show me impressed me with their learning
[1:07:52] every day I want to come get a portion
[1:07:54] of my of my virtue that's right and then
[1:07:58] I got my own seven children - the same
[1:07:59] thing - praise God
[1:08:01] see everybody's got to come and get a
[1:08:04] part aside this people ought to be
[1:08:06] attracted to you and I people oughta
[1:08:09] like being around you amen
[1:08:11] because you're Lily you have something
[1:08:16] to give them praise God you have some
[1:08:19] weight to bless them you have some
[1:08:20] weight to help them and we'll look at
[1:08:22] this in the natural just a moment he
[1:08:26] said the lily just opens up his heart
[1:08:28] and say come on now be alright
[1:08:31] everything takes from him the lily he's
[1:08:34] a real pastor now that's a real quote
[1:08:37] I'm not making that up I'm not packing
[1:08:39] myself on the back I'm just saying what
[1:08:40] he said I say that's what I need to be I
[1:08:42] need to be a real one of these he
[1:08:45] expresses the glory of God and look
[1:08:48] where he came from he had he had to
[1:08:51] overcome to do that that's my new thing
[1:08:55] I like hitting this you know thank the
[1:08:56] Lord gives me something to contact I
[1:09:00] mean maybe I didn't do that too much I
[1:09:02] donno he said one time he or she so he
[1:09:05] now he goes a lily can be a sister one
[1:09:08] time he or she was young and fair and
[1:09:11] beautiful they had a lot of temptations
[1:09:13] to go through a lot of muck to go
[1:09:15] through a lot of mud to go through but
[1:09:19] they overcame that see they overcame now
[1:09:24] they're expressing the real beauty of
[1:09:26] Christ in their life
[1:09:28] notice expressing through the mud see if
[1:09:33] you study a lily it's its roots go
[1:09:36] straight down and stays in the mud it's
[1:09:39] like all these you know all these lilies
[1:09:40] there there's all these are the lines of
[1:09:41] stems right see there's a part of us
[1:09:44] that's still in the muck part right we
[1:09:46] still got a sin part of us but we got to
[1:09:49] live above that praise God we're not
[1:09:51] expressing the mud works
[1:09:53] crossing the beauty of the seed of the
[1:09:55] character that's inside us but we're
[1:09:58] still connected to the muddy parts but
[1:10:01] we're not expressing that even you see
[1:10:03] any mud on that church can anybody put a
[1:10:06] finger on these lilies say there's mud
[1:10:10] here there's mud here no your your
[1:10:12] life's out of order here your life's is
[1:10:13] sinful here your life's disgraceful here
[1:10:17] can anybody put a finger on it no
[1:10:19] because it's manifesting the beauty of
[1:10:22] it's a seed praise God amen
[1:10:25] it's living above that it overcame that
[1:10:28] it used to be muddy right it used to not
[1:10:31] be able to express this but now it's an
[1:10:34] overcomer
[1:10:35] now he's expressing the beauty and now
[1:10:37] everybody can come and get something
[1:10:39] from them praise God
[1:10:43] so I look up in Britannica about water
[1:10:46] lilies let me I'll read this it's just a
[1:10:50] little paragraph here now look just real
[1:10:56] quick look at all their parts and you're
[1:10:58] gonna see how every single part of it is
[1:11:01] used to help somebody else right many
[1:11:08] species of water lilies are suited for
[1:11:10] pools aquatic gardens and aquariums
[1:11:13] where they are prized for their
[1:11:14] attractive foilage and showy flowers and
[1:11:19] I was in South America four times and
[1:11:22] they got lilies there's the most there's
[1:11:24] some of the biggest lilies I've ever
[1:11:26] seen
[1:11:26] their leaves are massive just massive
[1:11:29] and we went to a wedding there one time
[1:11:31] and they had all these lilies laying out
[1:11:33] you know it was one of the most
[1:11:34] beautiful things you could see and I
[1:11:36] thought that in a poor country like that
[1:11:38] they still had some of those beautiful
[1:11:41] decorations
[1:11:42] they'd have to hang all this white stuff
[1:11:44] like you know we do here in America try
[1:11:46] to make it all beauty they take the
[1:11:48] beauty of God's nature and it's just as
[1:11:51] beautiful if not more beautiful than our
[1:11:52] weddings we'll spend millions and
[1:11:54] hundreds of thousands of dollars to make
[1:11:56] it naturally beaut or artificially
[1:11:59] beautiful and these poor people will
[1:12:01] take the natural things of God it's
[1:12:03] probably more beautiful than our
[1:12:04] weddings that's right
[1:12:08] the submerge leaves the starchy
[1:12:13] horizontal creeping rhizomes
[1:12:16] so it has submerged leaves as well so
[1:12:18] leaves above and leaves below and the
[1:12:23] protein-rich seeds of the larger species
[1:12:25] has been used as food by humans
[1:12:28] throughout history so humans come get
[1:12:31] apart humans look over there say oh I'd
[1:12:33] like to use that seed oh we're gonna use
[1:12:34] that for some food or the humans will
[1:12:37] get under there in the water they'll
[1:12:38] pick the leaves out front of the under
[1:12:40] let's say oh we can use this for food
[1:12:42] sounds like some good cabbage or lettuce
[1:12:43] right there but it was wet but first the
[1:12:48] humans would say my I'll come get my
[1:12:51] part praise God
[1:12:53] so you don't humans come to you and try
[1:12:55] to get there apart from you right maybe
[1:13:00] men so humans come and the water lilies
[1:13:03] don't fuss don't take it from me I need
[1:13:05] it don't take it no they realize that's
[1:13:08] my purpose in life my purpose in life is
[1:13:11] to give to other people a lily doesn't
[1:13:15] exist for its own self all right now
[1:13:20] does it reproduce yes but it's not
[1:13:22] living for itself of course you can see
[1:13:24] it about any of God's creation right now
[1:13:29] the head I'm sorry I don't know how to
[1:13:33] say it peni petals petals
[1:13:36] leaf stalks serve as cover for fish and
[1:13:42] hold fast for their spawn okay so these
[1:13:47] these serve as cover for fish and then
[1:13:52] they're babies so see every part helps
[1:13:56] life the life of humans the life of fish
[1:14:02] church because they like this our love
[1:14:05] should be able to cover people as well
[1:14:07] our prayers should cover the sins of
[1:14:10] others
[1:14:12] he's got like member Stephen he said
[1:14:16] Lord lay it not to their charge what was
[1:14:19] he doing he was covering Paul amen
[1:14:21] because Paul was standing right there
[1:14:23] holding Coates but there is Stephen as a
[1:14:26] lily he's he put out his pet tiles
[1:14:29] whenever you come and he said cover Paul
[1:14:32] and Jesus heard it and jesus answered
[1:14:35] and said I'm gonna use him and make him
[1:14:37] a chosen vessel because the Stephens
[1:14:39] Prairie man he wasn't living for supper
[1:14:42] they meant he was living for Pauly man I
[1:14:45] don't know yeah covered him hallelujah
[1:14:49] and your prayers will cover the lives of
[1:14:53] others
[1:14:54] how many believe that like I told you
[1:14:59] Steve Alexander now he left but in the
[1:15:02] 1990s he prayed for God to raise up a
[1:15:03] church here to cover the sins of his
[1:15:06] family and that beautiful to cover and
[1:15:12] my mom told me that she said no one else
[1:15:13] prayed for you Jesse no one else prayed
[1:15:15] she said grandpa just preached at us and
[1:15:18] everything like that she said I was the
[1:15:20] only one that prayed for you and your
[1:15:21] siblings and God heard those prayers say
[1:15:27] your prayers are so powerful they cover
[1:15:29] and the Bible says he that converts a
[1:15:31] sinner from the error of his way covers
[1:15:35] a multitude of sins amen glory so they
[1:15:42] help humans they feed humans and they
[1:15:44] help the fish life they protect it they
[1:15:47] cover it and they help it reproduce and
[1:15:49] grow and multiply and then who catches
[1:15:51] the fish humans right he
[1:16:00] says the huffed wildlife so Huff's right
[1:16:03] any animal with the hoof the hoof
[1:16:06] wildlife also browse and eat on the
[1:16:09] plant parts that are above water so
[1:16:12] these two I'm not sure about the pedals
[1:16:15] but these any of the parts that are
[1:16:17] above water the hoofed animals they come
[1:16:20] get their part so far we got bees
[1:16:23] we got humans we got fish now we got
[1:16:26] hoofed animals everybody's coming to get
[1:16:29] a part of these beautiful lilies and you
[1:16:33] see them one by one they slowly start
[1:16:35] fading away hallelujah right but the RAM
[1:16:40] said and I said this wrong last week
[1:16:41] Legrand said you have four likes to your
[1:16:43] humanity not three I said three last
[1:16:45] week but mater said when you're born you
[1:16:47] have four lights the first one goes out
[1:16:48] at 25 then 50 then 75 then 100 or 120
[1:16:55] however you live that lap that last
[1:16:56] light shines a little longer it can not
[1:16:59] that it will but see if you look at
[1:17:01] these lilies when they first come up
[1:17:03] beautiful but with each passing day in
[1:17:06] their season of life amen something is
[1:17:09] using it something is taking from it and
[1:17:12] it only exists to minister to other
[1:17:14] people and each one comes by the little
[1:17:21] guy that little person that always comes
[1:17:24] up and buzzes in your ear a little
[1:17:27] person who always send you the text you
[1:17:29] know every sends you boys cause you at
[1:17:30] this time of the week every week a
[1:17:32] little a little thing that keeps
[1:17:34] happening all the time but then the big
[1:17:35] things that happen in your life those
[1:17:37] big huff to family members that stomp
[1:17:40] into your life everybody stand yours are
[1:17:44] coming back to you today right because
[1:17:48] some of them don't believe right and so
[1:17:51] someone is going to manifest the light
[1:17:53] of Christ amen
[1:17:57] either you're gonna be defeated or
[1:17:59] you're gonna be the overcomer amen but
[1:18:02] this world is were surrounded by
[1:18:04] defeated people saying they're
[1:18:06] Christians when they're not but we
[1:18:08] should be the overcomers and be ready to
[1:18:10] give love or concern or money or prayers
[1:18:13] or time or the curves man or a hug or
[1:18:16] prayer whatever's needed we should be
[1:18:18] able to do it and slowly as time goes on
[1:18:21] we just fade fade fade still expressing
[1:18:24] the glory of God
[1:18:33] almost done with this Lily the emergent
[1:18:37] leaves are the leaves on top also
[1:18:42] provide cover for the aquatic birds I'm
[1:18:47] not sure which one it is I'm thinking
[1:18:49] like this maybe small birds can kind of
[1:18:50] hide in here but not only for things
[1:18:54] under but they cover on top too the bird
[1:18:58] comes by I think I'll hide here for a
[1:19:00] little bit
[1:19:01] can I hide under your prayers for a
[1:19:03] little bit brother Jessie can I just
[1:19:04] hide here I have we had that we have
[1:19:06] people hide in our church for a little
[1:19:07] while and I thank God for it right I
[1:19:09] thank God they just want to hide here
[1:19:11] but hey man be protective for a little
[1:19:13] while just hide me under the the beauty
[1:19:14] of Christ's word then when they're done
[1:19:18] alright thank you thank you see you
[1:19:20] later
[1:19:20] praise the Lord there they go but what
[1:19:23] do we have to do we have to serve God's
[1:19:25] purpose be a shelter to somebody praise
[1:19:29] God be a friend be the encouragement
[1:19:32] praise God that's what you're there for
[1:19:34] every part of you has a purpose for it
[1:19:38] for you to give out for the benefit of
[1:19:41] others if you've got eternal life
[1:19:43] eternal life is living bar so the birds
[1:19:50] even fly down saying I can find little
[1:19:51] I'm flying this world of toil and snares
[1:19:54] if I falter who cares well there's a
[1:19:57] Lily who cares for me hey man thank the
[1:20:00] Lord
[1:20:00] I'll find little protection for a while
[1:20:02] before I go my way you know I was in
[1:20:07] Coeur
[1:20:07] this week I was reading in this book
[1:20:08] about prayer and fasting I'm about
[1:20:10] halfway done beautiful book powerful
[1:20:12] book um was it gonna now lost my thought
[1:20:18] there yeah I lost my thought sorry so
[1:20:25] sorry the emergent leaves provide cover
[1:20:27] for aquatic birds and the seeds of many
[1:20:30] species are food for fish and fowl so
[1:20:35] just like a human will come get the big
[1:20:37] seeds there's little seeds left over
[1:20:39] then fish will get the ones underneath I
[1:20:42] don't know how they do it but then birds
[1:20:45] will come get the seeds as well well
[1:20:46] while I'm here I'll just feed on the
[1:20:49] word of God the seed while I'm here so
[1:20:52] jesus said those seed is the word amen
[1:20:56] thank the Lord here's what I like
[1:21:02] brother sister the science says because
[1:21:06] they grow rapidly they can clog the
[1:21:10] lakes several members of theirs family
[1:21:14] provided essential link in plant
[1:21:16] succession from pond to swamp to wet
[1:21:20] Prairie so without these water lilies
[1:21:26] some of the plants would die off because
[1:21:29] it attracts glory it attracts all these
[1:21:32] people that want a part of their beauty
[1:21:34] and because of that because of their
[1:21:38] humble existence they just stay in one
[1:21:40] spot they just stay in the same church
[1:21:44] they stay in the same home right they're
[1:21:48] not divorced and remarry and divorce
[1:21:50] free man
[1:21:50] they stay in the same place they stay in
[1:21:53] their position where God plays them and
[1:21:55] because of them life can go on you know
[1:22:04] and you've heard it before but it's
[1:22:05] scriptural you remember from Genesis 19
[1:22:07] or Genesis 18 rather the only reason
[1:22:11] this world can go on is because of Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost field Christians they are the salt
[1:22:16] of the earth God says I'll destroy it
[1:22:18] unless there's 10 but what happened he
[1:22:20] ever
[1:22:22] your life preserves sinners lives but
[1:22:27] it's not to pat you on the back and say
[1:22:29] thank God that greater is He that's in
[1:22:31] me than he that's in the world amen
[1:22:35] but because of the beauty of Lily's life
[1:22:39] can grow and succeed in generations can
[1:22:42] go keep going on and moving on by the
[1:22:45] grace of God I like that grow rapidly
[1:22:52] praise God
[1:22:53] someone comes to the message and really
[1:22:55] received it brother Jose what happens
[1:22:57] you see him grow real fast amen
[1:23:01] God is the god of a short quick work
[1:23:03] Amen Alleluia look at Paul he was
[1:23:08] killing Christians he was going to put
[1:23:10] Christians in jail within a matter of
[1:23:12] three days he had the Holy Ghost amen
[1:23:15] Bob said his scales on his eyes three
[1:23:18] days and and I said to be praised and
[1:23:20] repent go be baptizing me filled with
[1:23:22] the Holy Ghost three days later he went
[1:23:24] from being in the muck
[1:23:26] hallelujah being dirty being slimy being
[1:23:29] filthy being a murderer he went from the
[1:23:31] mud and muck up to the top
[1:23:34] walking the light within three days God
[1:23:36] does a short quick work
[1:23:38] may God do a work in our lives may we
[1:23:43] not remain in slimy things maybe not
[1:23:45] think look back to dirty things Oh may
[1:23:48] we look to the heavens amen
[1:23:49] may we look to eternity amen and be a
[1:23:53] lily that others might benefit from our
[1:23:56] lives
[1:23:57] praise God hallelujah every part of our
[1:24:05] lives then we learn from the lily should
[1:24:07] be service to others that's why I do

[1:26:33] where we got to be careful not say it's
[1:26:35] okay to say that's what I try to tell
[1:26:36] this person I'm entering I don't agree
[1:26:38] with their sin I try to point them
[1:26:40] here's I try to say here's what I did
[1:26:42] when I was in that situation and here's
[1:26:45] how God taught me or I talk to brother
[1:26:46] Brooks about this right I call bears
[1:26:48] you're browning about this that's why
[1:26:49] told me yesterday I said you might want
[1:26:51] to call them just to be a mentor because
[1:26:54] I don't have all the knowledge that Lily
[1:26:57] doesn't have everything but it has
[1:26:58] something you don't have everything but
[1:27:02] you've got something they want amen
[1:27:05] what see Bertrand Labor's on this over
[1:27:07] and over
[1:27:07] it's the overcomer first we got to
[1:27:10] overcome all the muck and dirtiness and
[1:27:12] everything and we got to shoot up real
[1:27:14] strong and fast see that's the word
[1:27:18] quickened amen this quickly grows it's
[1:27:20] quick it in the hey man it's made alive
[1:27:22] amen see we gotta make sure our lives
[1:27:24] are growing to the word and then once
[1:27:27] we're born again on top of the water we
[1:27:29] got to stretch you out and keep growing
[1:27:31] in the grace of God what if this guy
[1:27:34] didn't grow and put forth these leaves
[1:27:37] the fish would die the birds wouldn't
[1:27:41] come see him and aren't leaves the type
[1:27:44] of fellowship that's what I told that
[1:27:49] friend I might the mentor I said listen
[1:27:51] I said it and I'll say it's all the
[1:27:52] church here if you need fellowship with
[1:27:54] me let me know once a month we can meet
[1:27:55] at my house over to my house you just
[1:27:58] tell me what you need I'm here to give
[1:28:01] myself to you praise God and you should
[1:28:05] be here to give yourself for everybody
[1:28:06] else we should all be living for each
[1:28:09] other we can't do this alone the lily
[1:28:11] can't do it alone right it neat and it
[1:28:14] needs it to people to take the animals
[1:28:15] take the seeds and spread it right right
[1:28:19] just like all the flowers they need to
[1:28:20] that nectar to take it they need to be
[1:28:21] to help pollinate them right that's I
[1:28:24] told the person yesterday they said oh I
[1:28:26] always feel like uh you're the one
[1:28:27] giving me advice about that I said
[1:28:29] listen the Bible said iron sharpens iron
[1:28:32] and I said even when I'm reflecting
[1:28:35] about how to help you it causes me to
[1:28:38] examine myself to make sure I'm just as
[1:28:40] zealous for Christ now as I was then
[1:28:45] because it doesn't do anything to
[1:28:47] blabber doesn't help me to blabber off
[1:28:49] things and look what I look how prideful
[1:28:50] I am
[1:28:51] look how there's none of us good but if
[1:28:54] we can give a word and new season how
[1:28:56] pleasant is that word amen hallelujah
[1:28:59] the bob says like snow to the
[1:29:02] marathon runner I forget what it was
[1:29:03] gone on a hot day when he's running all
[1:29:06] these 26.2 miles bangs a marathon runner
[1:29:09] right bang he ran one it's more than one
[1:29:14] more than I've ever run but the bottle
[1:29:17] said it's like snow to the messenger hey
[1:29:20] after the long race Amen refreshing a
[1:29:24] church that's what our words can be
[1:29:26] let's refresh others now you got to
[1:29:30] correct children yes you got to correct
[1:29:31] sometimes adults but we but if we do it
[1:29:34] right it will refresh them because if
[1:29:38] you're not Korean with the Lord even
[1:29:40] with your own walk with the Lord if
[1:29:41] God's not correcting you something's
[1:29:43] wrong because the Lord Chasen's every
[1:29:45] Sun or else he's a bastard child a
[1:29:49] church that's not having struggles is
[1:29:52] not a true church right okay give me
[1:29:57] about yeah all right I'm maybe half an
[1:30:01] hour we'll see I want to I want to try
[1:30:03] to finish today so now bo-ram changes
[1:30:06] the thought now he doesn't mention
[1:30:07] lilies over and over again you know of
[1:30:09] course as the sermon goes on brother Ram
[1:30:15] now goes into the thought of how Jesus
[1:30:16] overcame and he said Jesus gave us the
[1:30:20] example how to do it now we want to know
[1:30:22] how he overcame he told us how to do it
[1:30:25] see what's the one word brother Ram said
[1:30:27] how I overcame humility that's what he
[1:30:30] emphasizes he gird himself took a towel
[1:30:35] wash his disciples feet and wiped them
[1:30:38] the very God of heaven humiliated
[1:30:40] himself he said but we don't want to be
[1:30:47] humiliated that's the reason women don't
[1:30:49] wear their hair they don't let their
[1:30:51] hair grow out the reason they don't want
[1:30:52] to dress like lady should dress men
[1:30:54] don't men don't want to do that see it's
[1:30:56] the same thing they get humiliated but
[1:30:59] he said Jesus constantly look who he was
[1:31:01] he said I'm gonna say something
[1:31:04] greatness humiliates itself
[1:31:08] he says greatness humbles itself
[1:31:11] greatness
[1:31:13] now of course that means you don't like
[1:31:16] embarrass yourself to be silly but you
[1:31:19] obey the Word of God and you put others
[1:31:21] needs above yours that's humility it's
[1:31:23] putting the needs of others above your
[1:31:25] own
[1:31:27] LeBron talks about how he met people
[1:31:30] rich guys he said but I've met they
[1:31:32] weren't he said they thought they were
[1:31:33] great men but they weren't he said I
[1:31:38] stood by people he said that were great
[1:31:40] men with ragged sleeves on and cuffs
[1:31:42] my shirts fairly new I think it's one
[1:31:43] year old program said the great men he
[1:31:46] met had raggedy clothes on he said they
[1:31:51] they make you think you're the great
[1:31:53] person see because and church it's not a
[1:31:57] put-on I've had people do that toast
[1:31:58] this money about this one time so a
[1:32:00] preacher came up and said oh you're
[1:32:01] you're a better preacher than I after I
[1:32:03] preached and I could sense my spirit it
[1:32:05] was not a compliment it was false
[1:32:07] humility but see when it's real genuine
[1:32:12] perhaps is like this perhaps God showed
[1:32:15] you know you sinned and then God you
[1:32:17] know it shows you how humble you are how
[1:32:19] much you need him and then you're just
[1:32:21] coming out of this right you're coming
[1:32:23] out of this period of being guilty and
[1:32:25] but then feeling forgiven but you
[1:32:27] realize how weak you are
[1:32:28] and then God will send somebody to you
[1:32:30] and you'll just see like like you're
[1:32:32] just you see good in them and you're
[1:32:33] just you're complimenting them because
[1:32:36] you just realize that you fell and that
[1:32:38] you need God's grace to and you are
[1:32:41] making them feel like the great person
[1:32:43] but you're not doing it for any selfish
[1:32:46] gain it's because you're so encouraged
[1:32:48] that they're in a stage of overcoming
[1:32:49] amen that's where that quote really is
[1:32:53] the reality of it when you're making
[1:32:56] people greater than yourself it's done
[1:32:58] in all sincerity because you realize ma
[1:33:01] I've been struggling I think the Lord
[1:33:03] for forgiving me but thank the Lord God
[1:33:05] is really helping this person right now
[1:33:07] and you're making them feel like they're
[1:33:09] better than you that's at least how I
[1:33:12] see in my life church praise God so when
[1:33:19] someone you make someone the great
[1:33:21] person and that church
[1:33:23] God helps me that I need to do this all
[1:33:25] the time people start talking about me
[1:33:27] or my book or YouTube and by God's grace
[1:33:29] God knows this I always try to like
[1:33:31] change it back to them I don't want the
[1:33:33] I'll just say a few things but I always
[1:33:35] want to try to turn it back to them I
[1:33:36] don't want it to be all about me because
[1:33:39] I know that's selfish they're not gonna
[1:33:41] really maybe they'll benefit a little
[1:33:43] bit if they're encouraged by God
[1:33:44] blessing or the ministry or something
[1:33:45] like that I always try to make sure it's
[1:33:47] not about me how are you doing or what
[1:33:50] are you going through right now or what
[1:33:52] do you reading your Bible right now it's
[1:33:53] message you're listening to lately you
[1:33:55] know turn the focus back on them which
[1:33:59] is a way to get them to feel like
[1:34:01] they're a good person right or that
[1:34:04] they're pleasing God but I don't think
[1:34:08] it's something to say well you're them I
[1:34:10] think it's wrong to say well you're the
[1:34:11] best sister I know I think that's wrong
[1:34:14] because now everybody else feels bad or
[1:34:18] you're the best preacher I know that's
[1:34:20] not a I know people say that that's not
[1:34:22] the night that's not the thing to say
[1:34:24] see that makes everybody else feel bad
[1:34:26] it's just encouraging them and just
[1:34:29] noticing God's grace in their life see
[1:34:35] so we got to make sure it's not a false
[1:34:37] exalting of someone else but it's
[1:34:39] actually in all sincerity you thank God
[1:34:41] you see growth in people's lives praise
[1:34:45] God
[1:34:47] now he's not talking about humility
[1:34:51] genuine humility not something that's a
[1:34:54] put-on he says something that's real
[1:34:56] human at Milty Jesus told us how to do
[1:34:58] it
[1:34:58] overcome means to stand the test like
[1:35:01] all the old Saints did like Jesus I miss
[1:35:03] all of his enemies he stood the test
[1:35:05] everything he was tested against he
[1:35:07] stood it in the very face of sickness
[1:35:10] him me and the Messiah he healed them in
[1:35:12] the face of death he brought it back to
[1:35:14] life in the face of Calvary his own
[1:35:16] death he defeated by surrendering
[1:35:19] himself why by the word he said you
[1:35:23] destroy this temple in three days I'll
[1:35:24] raise it up the word said so and the
[1:35:26] prends of death he defeated it amen
[1:35:29] he overcame death in the presence of
[1:35:31] hell he defeated Hell and overcame hell
[1:35:33] hey see there was defeat all around him
[1:35:36] but he
[1:35:36] overcame all of it amen why by oh by the
[1:35:41] word all by humility there's the real
[1:35:43] man how many wanna be a real man or will
[1:35:44] real woman you overcome by the word
[1:35:49] there's the one to make your example he
[1:35:52] defeated everything overcoming
[1:35:53] temptation was for him you know that the
[1:35:56] Bible said he was tempted in all points
[1:35:57] like as we are yet without sin he was
[1:36:00] tempted by drinking can you imagine that
[1:36:02] Jesus there were times wanted to go have
[1:36:04] a drink
[1:36:05] now we know he drink a little bit of
[1:36:07] wine the Bible said so John had none
[1:36:08] Jesus had a little but there was times
[1:36:10] where they men Jesus wouldn't have a lot
[1:36:12] more of that in his flesh he was tempted
[1:36:16] by it Satan said why don't you take a
[1:36:18] little more and just relax it's been a
[1:36:19] real stressful time these Pharisees have
[1:36:22] got under your nerves yeah you should
[1:36:24] take an extra big drink to kind of left
[1:36:25] the pressure shame on that right shame
[1:36:29] on that devil for trying to tempt our
[1:36:31] Lord like that but Jesus was tempted by
[1:36:33] it he said he was tempted by women right
[1:36:38] he was tempted by everything that could
[1:36:41] be tempted by he was tempted by
[1:36:43] everything that we are he was a man and
[1:36:45] yet you couldn't put a mark on him you
[1:36:48] couldn't find any mud on his life amen I
[1:36:51] know about his spiritual life now you
[1:36:53] can find mud all over and right that's
[1:36:55] what they didn't wash his feet remember
[1:36:56] that in Simon's house they didn't wash
[1:36:58] the mud off his feet so yeah that he had
[1:37:00] natural mud but not spiritual mud oh
[1:37:02] thank god help us to be like that praise
[1:37:05] God he said but you got to overcome
[1:37:09] means to recognize the devil at every
[1:37:11] one of his tricks he said you must say
[1:37:15] he said you must recognize he's a real
[1:37:18] devil
[1:37:18] levan says don't say there's no devil he
[1:37:21] said you must recognize there's a devil
[1:37:23] and he's trying to kill you he is trying
[1:37:26] to kill you he seeks the easy though
[1:37:29] trying to kill you steal or steal kill
[1:37:33] or destroy yeah destroy one of those
[1:37:35] three he's trying to do one of them to
[1:37:37] you he said you must
[1:37:42] nice him and no these a devil he's
[1:37:43] against you then overcome you must
[1:37:45] recognize that the God in you is greater
[1:37:47] and mightier than he is the one that's
[1:37:50] in you has already overcome him and by
[1:37:52] His grace you are more than a match for
[1:37:54] him
[1:37:54] that's real overcoming when you
[1:37:57] recognize praise God now here's a quote
[1:38:02] I don't know if you heard this bill Bram
[1:38:03] says if the devil gives you a sickness
[1:38:06] you can't say I don't believe it's a
[1:38:09] sickness now look at this I'm just
[1:38:10] trying to balance this out he's every
[1:38:12] other quote we've read or heard is that
[1:38:14] if you're sick deny it but Bram just got
[1:38:18] done saying you can't deny and say
[1:38:19] there's no devil there's no devil
[1:38:21] there's no devil trying to you can't
[1:38:22] deny it
[1:38:22] you're fooling yourself and he says this
[1:38:27] you can't say I don't believe it's a
[1:38:29] sickness oh yes it is a sickness you got
[1:38:32] cancer you you don't believe it's a
[1:38:33] cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer so
[1:38:38] see there's part of you as a human you
[1:38:39] have to recognize there is a devil
[1:38:41] trying to destroy me he has given me
[1:38:43] this sickness he said but you must quote
[1:38:45] greater is He that's in you than he
[1:38:48] that's in the world you must realize
[1:38:51] that the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[1:38:53] already overcome this thing amen and
[1:38:57] he's in you and you can overcome by him
[1:39:01] that's exactly sensible exactly the way
[1:39:04] the scriptures written praise God so see
[1:39:09] there's a balance to it now does the
[1:39:13] possession of cancer does that belong to
[1:39:15] you no that's Satan's possession right
[1:39:18] who started sickness the devil right so
[1:39:22] the first perverted cell and then
[1:39:24] without the sphere that went into it was
[1:39:25] a devil so yes you're not you're not
[1:39:28] taking the backs of rattlesnakes but
[1:39:30] you're recognize you recognize the enemy
[1:39:32] has brought this upon me it is not mine
[1:39:35] to keep Christ is gonna deliver me from
[1:39:37] it praise God I know that's simple but I
[1:39:43] just want to bring out that quote so you
[1:39:44] know you can't just act like wow I'm not
[1:39:47] sick I'm not sick you have to realize
[1:39:49] I'm sick but I'm gonna be well praise
[1:39:51] God thank the Lord
[1:39:58] he said he that's in he was greater than
[1:40:01] he is in the world now if you look back
[1:40:02] and you're condemned then you're still
[1:40:04] in the world but if you're living above
[1:40:08] that then he that's in you has led you
[1:40:11] above that darkness see if you got a
[1:40:15] sickness and you're living in sin he
[1:40:16] said well then you're not up on top of
[1:40:17] the water you got to get up on top of
[1:40:19] the water first right like the lily he's
[1:40:23] above the darkness of the mud he's in
[1:40:25] the light reflecting the beauty that was
[1:40:28] put him both in him before he left the
[1:40:30] mud amen hallelujah
[1:40:34] it's press its way through it overcome
[1:40:37] the shell it overcome the mud it
[1:40:39] overcome the waters and overcome
[1:40:41] everything and was an overcomer
[1:40:43] reflected the beauty and glory of God he
[1:40:46] said that's the way every believer does
[1:40:48] that's the way Noah did lot did what a
[1:40:51] mess he was in look that's the way Moses
[1:40:53] did that's the way Joshua did the way
[1:40:55] Daniel did Shadrach Meshach that's the
[1:40:58] way John the Baptist Zacharias Elizabeth
[1:40:59] that's the way Simeon that's the way Ana
[1:41:02] every one of them did they overcome the
[1:41:04] mud that was there around them and
[1:41:06] packed into them they stuck their head
[1:41:09] above the thing and shine forth the
[1:41:11] glory of God that's what a real
[1:41:12] Christian does oh not as glorious amen
[1:41:17] see we got to stick our hand above the
[1:41:21] things of the world we got to get our
[1:41:22] eyes off the things of the world right
[1:41:24] and look up and look above if we can
[1:41:26] just keep using that illustration of
[1:41:28] turning our eyes upon Jesus and looking
[1:41:31] full and this wonderful face now look at
[1:41:36] the problem not look at the mud not look
[1:41:38] at the slime not look at that but look
[1:41:40] at the one who gave us the power and the
[1:41:42] beauty within us to overcome the mud
[1:41:45] muck and slime that's what a real
[1:41:48] Christian does hallelujah let me go
[1:41:56] further now Jesus herbal man breaks into
[1:41:58] Jesus three temptations in Matthew
[1:42:00] chapter four he said he was tempted
[1:42:03] above any man that could ever be tempted
[1:42:04] in the temptation of Jesus Christ how do
[1:42:08] you overcome he said it is written he
[1:42:11] said he overcame by the word and Jesus
[1:42:13] said if you abide in me and my words
[1:42:15] abide in you you're back to word again
[1:42:18] the word of promise what is the word of
[1:42:21] promise to every Christian greater is He
[1:42:23] that's in you
[1:42:23] then he that's in the world then how do
[1:42:26] I overcome not me but the word that's in
[1:42:29] me the word is God then I overcome the
[1:42:32] things of the world because it's the
[1:42:34] word in me if you abide in me my words
[1:42:36] and you then ask what you will just keep
[1:42:38] pressing up you're coming to the top it
[1:42:40] sure is anything you got to come to the
[1:42:42] top Ami's I like this we've got to come

[1:42:53] gonna have faith for a body change we

[1:42:57] come higher than that into manhood

[1:43:02] our everyday battles and we got to keep
[1:43:05] staying in the Word of God until the
[1:43:07] season comes when we can rise high above
[1:43:09] that and we can reach our destiny which
[1:43:12] is the rapture praise God that's the
[1:43:16] reason it is our destiny because we've
[1:43:17] heard it right that's the reason we
[1:43:20] heard it because it's our destiny praise
[1:43:21] God other churches don't care about they
[1:43:24] don't want to preach on it they're
[1:43:25] scared about it but why we heard it
[1:43:27] because God's calling us to in amen

[1:43:36] marriage supper of the Lamb you got to
[1:43:38] come to the money you got to keep coming
[1:43:40] up so you can possess those promises
[1:43:44] just keep his words in you if my words
[1:43:48] abide in you and you abide in my word
[1:43:50] ask what you will it'll be granted to
[1:43:54] you see buh-bam said it was three major
[1:43:59] assaults upon Jesus in the wilderness
[1:44:01] it's always in them three don't forget
[1:44:05] it
[1:44:05] those three major assaults from the
[1:44:08] highest
[1:44:09] to the lowest Satan had three major
[1:44:14] attacks but he met it with the word
[1:44:16] every attack he could make it with the
[1:44:18] word praise God now you know the lust of
[1:44:25] the eyes Satan showed him the kinas the
[1:44:27] world said fall down and worship Me
[1:44:28] and Jesus didn't fall down he stood up
[1:44:33] and said I'll only worship God amen
[1:44:35] thou shalt worship none but God
[1:44:37] hallelujah so you know we guess what we
[1:44:41] got to do we can't bow down in worship
[1:44:42] things right we can't submit ourselves
[1:44:45] to doing the wrong thing we can't submit
[1:44:47] ourselves to loving the present world we
[1:44:50] can't borrow those things we got to
[1:44:52] stand and obey and stay with the word
[1:44:54] and quote the word let the word abide in
[1:44:57] you that you can stand against bowing
[1:44:59] down to the things of the world all
[1:45:02] right you see it all the time people
[1:45:02] give in to the pressures of the world
[1:45:04] and they bow down to their job they bow
[1:45:08] down to their family and they don't obey
[1:45:10] the simple Word of God
[1:45:12] right you can't read your Bible you
[1:45:16] can't pay your ties you can't come to
[1:45:17] church see they bow down simplest and
[1:45:20] simple things
[1:45:21] if you can't submit in these simple
[1:45:23] things what about the big things a
[1:45:25] mahendra how are we gonna be ready for a
[1:45:27] rapture if we can't stand up against the
[1:45:30] little things oh it's so crucial Church
[1:45:34] it's so crucial to stand on the Word of
[1:45:37] God and obey every word hallelujah
[1:45:41] come to the top Church we got to come to
[1:45:45] the top amen
[1:45:46] see lust of the flesh Satan said turn
[1:45:49] the stones into bread you're hungry and
[1:45:51] you'd be hungry after 4 hours not 40
[1:45:53] days you'll be hung out for 40 minutes
[1:45:55] right he's hungry after 40 days it's a
[1:46:00] great temptation use your gift for
[1:46:01] yourself
[1:46:02] help yourself this time and Jesus said
[1:46:05] no I live by every word that proceeds
[1:46:07] out of the mouth of God
[1:46:08] Satan's not gonna try to trick me to do
[1:46:10] americo I'll wait till God tells me to
[1:46:12] do a miracle I'll wait till God tells me
[1:46:15] to eat I'll wait till God tells me to
[1:46:17] stop the fast my god help us all
[1:46:19] I'll wait till God tells me to do
[1:46:22] something
[1:46:22] to help my flesh or my body I'll wait
[1:46:25] till God tells me until then I'm keeping
[1:46:27] the word and the pride of life cast
[1:46:31] yourself for up on this pinnacle cast
[1:46:33] yourself down the Angels will bear you
[1:46:35] up go ahead put your life on the line
[1:46:37] let's see if see if God Allah answer for
[1:46:40] you put yourself in a hard situation and
[1:46:42] Jesus said I will not put myself in a
[1:46:44] temptation he said thou shalt not tempt
[1:46:47] the LORD thy God see like I knew a
[1:46:51] friend one time this is true story maybe
[1:46:55] I've said it before good friend but he
[1:46:59] said lordy and this man want to commit
[1:47:00] adultery on his wife and he prayed a
[1:47:02] prayer he said Lord if it's okay for me
[1:47:04] to commit adultery he said let me speak
[1:47:06] in tongues and then he said he spoke in
[1:47:07] tongues
[1:47:08] so he went commit adultery on his wife
[1:47:11] right in the message we see that's the
[1:47:14] same thing that happened right here cast
[1:47:16] yourself down that would've been a sin
[1:47:18] right commit suicide and your life and
[1:47:22] see what is it it's tempting the Lord I
[1:47:26] don't know where that tongue came from
[1:47:28] I'm not sure we see God will never lead
[1:47:31] a man back into the mud God will only
[1:47:34] lead him out of the mud amen
[1:47:35] Sonlight brother Jose does not make the
[1:47:39] lilies go down into the mud sunlight
[1:47:41] makes him rise amen
[1:47:42] out of sin out of unbelief the Sun
[1:47:45] brings you honor
[1:47:46] it raises you up he raises me up out of
[1:47:49] the past muck and dirty and and filthy
[1:47:52] slimy things like that he raises you up
[1:47:54] so I don't know where the tape son came
[1:47:55] from but I know the prayer was a
[1:47:57] temptation of the pride of life God give
[1:48:02] me a supernatural thing so I can go sin
[1:48:04] nope that's the temptation of the enemy
[1:48:07] and it's brought nothing but destruction
[1:48:09] to his family in church nothing but
[1:48:12] destruction see people make this big
[1:48:16] syke making a deal with the devil almost
[1:48:18] my goodness so I could have the lust of
[1:48:22] the flesh as people have heard our
[1:48:25] message see so it's about you and I
[1:48:30] letting the word abide in us see the
[1:48:33] word should have been abiding in that
[1:48:35] individual and say
[1:48:36] thou shalt not commit adultery amen
[1:48:39] right quoting the Ten Commandments seat
[1:48:44] but it was it
[1:48:44] and so this that's how you and I
[1:48:47] overcome we receive the word and we
[1:48:49] stand with the word and we resist Satan
[1:48:51] hey Satan get behind me I'm married to
[1:48:53] my wife I'm married to my husband only I
[1:48:55] will not commit adultery I'm staying
[1:48:57] with the word amen but like I said
[1:49:02] before some people try to quote the word
[1:49:04] then you give in to the temptation well
[1:49:05] that's not that's not abiding in the
[1:49:06] word and I'm gonna close with this
[1:49:09] thought it doesn't matter what you say
[1:49:10] it matters what you say by revelation
[1:49:13] let me close with this thought because
[1:49:15] brother man brings up Matthew 7:21 not
[1:49:18] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[1:49:20] shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he
[1:49:23] that doeth the will of my father which
[1:49:25] is in heaven so it's not just quoting
[1:49:26] the word Jesus just didn't quote the
[1:49:29] word he obeyed the word he did the will
[1:49:33] of God after quoting the word because
[1:49:36] all these Judas workers of iniquity they
[1:49:38] all can say lord lord i love you lord i
[1:49:40] love you i love Americans I love the
[1:49:42] anointing I love the atmosphere they all
[1:49:44] love that but they also love iniquity
[1:49:46] and they don't do God's will but then
[1:49:52] church the Bible says you might write
[1:49:54] this down in first Corinthians 12:3
[1:49:55] wherefore I give you to understand that
[1:49:58] no man speaketh by the Spirit of God
[1:49:59] calls Jesus accursed and that no man can
[1:50:04] say that jesus is lord but by the holy
[1:50:07] ghost did you catch that Matthew 7
[1:50:13] they're saying Lord Lord but then Paul
[1:50:15] says you can only say Jesus is Lord by
[1:50:18] the Holy Ghost lurid so it's one of two
[1:50:22] things either those workers of iniquity
[1:50:24] had the temper anointing and they called
[1:50:26] him Lord but then they went out and
[1:50:28] sinned and lost that anointing or they
[1:50:33] never said Lord with the revelation that
[1:50:36] he was their root he was their ruler
[1:50:38] praise God you only don't hear it I mean
[1:50:40] they were just calling Lord Lord out of
[1:50:42] the coz they appreciate his miracles but
[1:50:44] they weren't calling him Lord because
[1:50:46] they had a revelation that they had
[1:50:48] obeyed him and then
[1:50:49] the blood of Jesus Christ had washed
[1:50:51] away all their iniquity amen
[1:50:53] because remember Church the seal of God
[1:50:55] the boss of the seal of God is that a
[1:50:58] Christian departs from iniquity glory
[1:51:02] that's the seal of God the seal of God
[1:51:05] is that a Christian will not remain in
[1:51:07] addictive sins over a long period of
[1:51:09] time very mad that's the seal of a
[1:51:14] Christian a certain minister toll
[1:51:20] brother branham said mr. Brannon look
[1:51:22] here Jesus said whosoever believeth that
[1:51:23] Jesus Christ son of God is born a Spirit
[1:51:25] of God I said but don't the Bible also
[1:51:28] say that no man can call Jesus Christ
[1:51:31] only by the Holy Ghost see you can't
[1:51:35] make the Bible lie it's got the hook ID
[1:51:39] so see doesn't matter what people say I
[1:51:41] believe the message I believe programs a
[1:51:43] prophet I leave Jesus Christ son of God
[1:51:45] I believe it's the end times doesn't
[1:51:46] matter what you say it matters if you're
[1:51:49] saying it from Revelation with the word
[1:51:52] abiding in you or if you just saying it
[1:51:54] for temporary blessings where is it
[1:51:58] speaking from is it speaking from the
[1:52:00] soul that I jesus is my lord
[1:52:03] and if it's speaking from your soul your
[1:52:05] soul is your will your nature your
[1:52:07] desires and if you're saying it from
[1:52:09] your soul then your desires are nothing
[1:52:11] but his desires hey man and then every
[1:52:16] area of your life is to do God's will to
[1:52:18] be a blessing to every person in every
[1:52:21] area of your life see this preachers
[1:52:27] trying to say see that's what you see
[1:52:28] all the UH let me say this I saw this
[1:52:31] morning huh do you know one of Billy
[1:52:33] Graham's daughters was married four
[1:52:34] times you know that I saw an article
[1:52:36] this morning on it and now she's writing
[1:52:38] a book which is okay Oh heshes really
[1:52:41] repented I've been married four times
[1:52:45] and realized after the fourth divorce
[1:52:49] that maybe she wasn't really in love
[1:52:52] with Christ because she really think God
[1:52:55] she realized it I don't know where I
[1:52:57] don't know where she stands now but even
[1:52:58] though her dad was a good man of God
[1:53:01] thank God for his ministry
[1:53:03] she realized my life is still in the mud
[1:53:06] and muck of the filth of this world amen
[1:53:09] imagine that for weddings not
[1:53:16] manifesting the light of Christ yet
[1:53:19] hearing all the time oddly she said I
[1:53:21] believe Jesus was my Savior he who calls
[1:53:23] upon the name of Lord shall be saved we
[1:53:24] Romans 10 right we all know that
[1:53:25] Scripture whoever calls on the name of
[1:53:28] Lord but the Bible also says you can
[1:53:30] only call him your Lord by the Holy
[1:53:32] Ghost so see it comes down to how did
[1:53:39] Jesus overcome Saint he wasn't saying it
[1:53:41] is written by his flesh he was saying it
[1:53:43] is written by the by the anointing by
[1:53:45] the revelation in his heart and then he
[1:53:48] was ready for the Amen to stand behind
[1:53:50] it and obey it that's how we know we're
[1:53:53] overcomers when we speak the word to
[1:53:55] temptation and we're ready to obey it
[1:53:58] and we're not going to give in let's
[1:54:01] stand to our feet search I hope that
[1:54:05] balances out gee that really helped me
[1:54:06] as I was listening this sermon I thought
[1:54:08] well let me find that scripture well
[1:54:14] Graham said if you are a part of God if
[1:54:17] you're a child of God in the Word of God
[1:54:19] how can you deny the word how can the
[1:54:22] Holy Spirit make you believe a Creed
[1:54:23] that you have to do something like this
[1:54:25] when the Bible said something else he
[1:54:28] the Bible plainly tells you what to do
[1:54:30] then when you see that you jump right
[1:54:32] into it you're right with it then just
[1:54:34] keep moving right on up and it just
[1:54:36] grows thick it it just grows see words
[1:54:42] matter yes words matter buts the words
[1:54:44] that are spoken by revelation of an
[1:54:47] overcomer you have to say it by the Holy
[1:54:51] Ghost see a lot of people say it by fear
[1:54:54] right or by pressure well I know my
[1:54:56] parents I know my friends are pressuring
[1:54:58] me to say Jesus is good to praise God
[1:55:00] thank you Jesus they say by pressure or
[1:55:02] fear I don't want to go to hell I love
[1:55:04] God alone but they got to say it by
[1:55:06] revelation in obedience in humility do a
[1:55:10] sin there I could do a sin there right
[1:55:12] that's the Saints the same thing just
[1:55:14] jump off the cliff God Oh for
[1:55:18] go ahead and do it you know God's gonna
[1:55:20] forgive you at the end the church said
[1:55:24] go ahead you know God's richer mercy
[1:55:26] he'll he'll forgive you
[1:55:28] well of course he will but you're not
[1:55:30] supposed to jump off the pinnacle you're
[1:55:33] supposed to wait till he says jump and
[1:55:34] he won't ever tell you to jump in this
[1:55:36] end it's if you get accidentally knocked
[1:55:41] off the pinnacle there it is ha there it
[1:55:44] is if you accidentally get tricked into
[1:55:46] sinning then God will bear you up but
[1:55:50] not if you purposely jump off the
[1:55:52] pinnacle purposely trying to jump into
[1:55:55] sin praise God let's bow our heads here
[1:55:59] I might have one more message on that I
[1:56:05] wanted to show you how the RAM ends it
[1:56:07] so we saw humility we saw service today
[1:56:10] how many appreciate the Word of God
[1:56:11] today praise the Lord and then brother
[1:56:16] Graham gives some specific examples of
[1:56:18] people at the end of the sermon about
[1:56:19] what they could pray for things they
[1:56:21] need to overcome in their lives but the
[1:56:24] additions if you just play a soft song
[1:56:26] here what a beautiful thing a Christian
[1:56:31] life is how many could say amen to that
[1:56:33] that picture is just not I've seen
[1:56:36] bigger one than that yeah they're so big
[1:56:39] and beautiful I just remember this
[1:56:41] morning water lilies so much benefit
[1:56:46] their life is just a benefit to others
[1:56:48] constantly blessing other people every
[1:56:51] part of their life is a blessing the
[1:56:53] finances their worship at church you
[1:56:57] know the prayer life they're just
[1:56:58] constantly praying blessing people
