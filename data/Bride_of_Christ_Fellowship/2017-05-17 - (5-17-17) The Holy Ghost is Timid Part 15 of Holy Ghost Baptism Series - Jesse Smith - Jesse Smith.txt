to text tonight by God's grace Oh miss Naomi they're wondering if I said enough you go back in there I'll remember to pick it back up all right you know me better than I do if you would Ephesians 4:30 and then that's a very clear one but it will go to personal needs 5:19 Asians 4:30 I want to I just kind of felt that to go to the back to the baptism the Holy Ghost series tonight I got like three series going on here Daniel matches the Holy Ghost from Church ages but I struggled I wrestled all week Lord what I preach do not try to go different channels I just felt this was the way to go so read this and then a BBC in just a moment it's good to see the Saints we missed y'all Sunday by God's grace thank you for supporting the services brother Simon I really appreciate that that means a lot to me a no meant a lot to him I hope he's a lot to God as wanting to support the Word of God and thank you for praying for him he leaves in the morning unless I misunderstood that I thought he left Thursday morning I could be wrong on that but the Word of God is so true yes trust you bless you tell me it was about David and one of the drink of water it was how program says Jesus wanting to worship in the Holy Ghost and we got to get in that and man amen every Sun you know the preacher on the day of Pentecost and the bride over there in Lima and so basically talking about the latter rain which is the church getting filled with the Holy Ghost so very similar soft thoughts there and thankful to Lord for that so you can hear these 4:30 so I'm not there already that agreed on the Spirit of God nearby your verse escalates 5:19 I think over you go now the 22 quench not the spirit hmm sighs out by the Civic science prove all things hold fast that abstain from all appearance of you which is prayer if you can get me on harps make it on to God in Berea let's bow our heads in prayer how many caller this is your word Lord's holy it's eternal Lord and son changes forever settled in heaven Lord this word has already rented and recorded somewhere in heaven it's true it will not fail we come to you Lord worshiping you loving you thank you for the solemn service and your the worship is beautiful your time to your God so I prayed tonight Lord God you make this a beautiful service Lord God continue to make it that we'd already lord help you to heal to your spirit others will just keep it a beautiful time of worship under your word father just going in on your people or daughter we're just so thankful for this opportunity in your house and I would I do again pray for my brother Simon when I was first missionary trip there other anointed or no doubt Satan I try to discourage when I prayed in Jesus Christ's name Lord when he gets to that land he can say I'm here in the name of Jesus Christ and no devil be able to stand before many preachers and leaders any Souls be converted guard may the truth be told and father they soul will be born again in the kingdom of God granted Lord Jesus we just ask that Lord we love you Lord we know how much you love us Gordon because the song said your love has ransomed us it's bought us that's paid our debt your love is like a great flood or the rains in our lives overflows us your love overflows me it just brings me to tears it just brings me to shouting because of your love Lord Lord we just thank you for your love and mercy that's us tonight that we not take this for granted tonight may we record and take advantage of it and hear from you having Jesus Christ Church say hey god bless you can see they're freezing up now I want to try can you get out the other remote I don't try Apple TV because from the Moore said he you can't hear the audio I wanna play look at the audio a little bit okay remember I work that it has the big screen on it okay there's one of them say Apple TV on it if not you can bring up here give it up look at that but I want to be able what I'm thinking is what it comes up with the Apple TV it'll actually play a sound through here I'm thinking hi God's grace yes sir yeah you press that please let's see if that work I got a number of quotes I wanna share as well in scriptures so let's see you know where it is for the very funny so don't know if it's gonna work or not but if not it's okay I do have the other adapter doesn't look like it can you bring me the remote buddy please yeah the big one just got to yeah thank you okay so my title for tonight is the Holy Ghost is timid kind of odd title but for those people baptized with the Holy Ghost and those desiring net you must understand how to approach the Holy Ghost okay yes sir yeah I just want this one yeah it's going to work I need to talk to man again he needs to I need to get a refresher from him my mom my lorrison sister Karen if you're watching which they are faithful watching forgive me but I could show it on Sunday if you remind me I'll show it on Sunday by God's grace so I do - let me get this plugged in that will get to the root of God we had some wonderful we had upset we had a wonderful service we'll have one service on Sunday I preached it on voice went out I think I've reached two hours and then I prayed at the altar for like a half hour with some of the saints that come up for prayer so my voice is quite strained today but I'm just going to give it all I got my gods Greece only live once by God's grace today with everything I got to Christ II so I'm not much of a servant but the least of them but I just want to do what God has me to do here so let's look at part 15 here tonight it's quite a it's quite it's been quite a while since I was on the subject so that's part 15 and the last time I preached on it was November night so even before I had an invocation back by God's grace it's been a while so I preached 14 parts and I got them all say you know if you ever interested also on YouTube Church channel by one look at the Holy Ghost is timid tonight by the grace of the Lord that doesn't mean scare it means he's sensitive and he's watching all of us tonight you know every night air every service and there's a balance to it like oh the main thing I would you get tonight is that the Holy Spirit sent it in we got to be aware of his presence now remember Church he's quick to forgive to just I just want to say that we're going to go through a lot of culture by the Grahams you'll say you don't move around but we gotta remember he's quick to forgive we make a little stick you know by God's grace so and it doesn't mean we can't have her smile on the service can mean it doesn't mean we can't ever laugh because you can I'm going to show you brother branham makes it joke at the end of the summer in church age in 1960 he said you ought to love each other so much you can chew on another's chewing gum and everybody started to crack it up I started laughing on the date in church they say one of them I started laughing they sing one of them and then they started singing another song and they get three unknown tongues interpretation right in a row and it brought three people to the altar three people got saved that night program said each telling interpretation was for one of them if spoke directly to their situation right after a prophet makes a joke but see that's not a bad joke that's just a clean joke right because God has a sense of humor so what up I just want to preach on that tonight the Holy Ghost attended and we want to be aware of it but we want to also we also want to please him okay that he can come and deal with us more and the reason I'm preaching it tonight is because I know let me say like this I know everybody loves the Lord but I'm talking about I want to just say the people I want to say it the right way so just bear with me here I say it wrong forgive me the people that can become side that the people that can be really dedicated to church come on Wednesday night that can be some people can't because of distance now some people choose not to and that's wrong what I'm saying is that you have chosen to come here god bless you and if those most dedicated or that want to be most dedicated to the ministry here if we can all put myself in here too if we can all get a good understanding of this God will continue to pour out those blessings among us so I just want to say that not and I understand some people live an hour hour and a half when he lives three and a half hours I don't expect them to drive that far on Wednesday night Church but what I want to say too is that even if whoever can't come we hope they're live streaming and pulling on the word and someone to try to read address this again on Sunday when everybody's here outside morning because it's like having kind of like having two churches you know one church on Sunday mornings real big and then the other ones are real small that's understandable because the distance there's nothing against we appreciate everybody that loved to drive god bless them but I'm saying of all out of everybody we want the most dedicated people the ones that are really sure this is where God wants them if we can get hold of this God can continue to move new people raise people up into positions in the church reveal gifts to people like if you don't know your gifts got to reveal those to you and then what is that do it gets us more mature in Christ and we have the Holy Spirit moving more amongst us and that's what we all want amen so I hope that came across the right way if not somebody come tell me afterwards you know send me a text I want everybody know especially those that can't make it on tonight we love them we love everybody we hope everybody's as much dedicated as everybody else understand so there's our text the and the Bible says the Holy Ghost is timid which means sensitive and reserved numbers the Holy Ghost isn't quick to just come and anoint a service he reserves himself he waits until the atmospheres right so this is an hour stretch of green nut the Holy Spirit of God so the word grieve and the Greek means to make sorrowful to affect with sadness to cause grief the throne to sorrow to agreed to a fed that's the word I often use the most when we sin or we don't when we act like God's not around or God can't come and do something actually offends God now not he's not eternally upset at us charity understand it's up there it's like a parent and a child like if Malachi or Lydia if they sinned I don't forever want them to leave our house I just want them to say they're sorry and I'll kiss some good night and hug them you know in Nevermore you know same way with my dad when he spend me all right you didn't get rid of me no my mom would see you had to put soap in my mouth or say bad words when I was a teenager she did want to get rid of me she just wanted me to be obedient and she's quick to forgive us ranchers who put this over my mouth she made me suffer you know that she didn't deny me suffer although something I did that not for a long time so I understand like that's what we're saying here he's timid in that he gets offended easily by sin or unbelief or bad attitudes because if that actually comes from a bad spirit now let's get the context so got your Bible and I could use me to sum up readers to let fusions 4:23 if you got that group I'll count on some brothers to read tonight I mean something we have so many brothers I think any brothers or sisters with my bleep preciate it a de minimis obey they med son one day dad will be here by God's grace it gets on first shift or will it but Adam would you read 23 24 maybe you read 25 and 26 I'm sorry fusions 423 I'm sorry but my father my father does that be 23 24 whatever you're ready and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness they met so how many believin get a fresh start to your mind and how many enjoy it don't you like that you feel like your mind it'll reset button and now you just got a pure mind to get that's what Paul is telling us and there's description sex really that says do it every day right we're supposed to renew it daily I daily renew our minding and so that's what the Bible saying we're going to make our minds new get a new life just throw out the old line get a clean life okay with a menu 25 and 26 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with this neighbor we are members one of another be angry and sin not let not the Sun go down upon your wrath thank you brother appreciate that now notice what it says there here are some things that grieve the Holy Spirit lie and then being angry and not taking care of it because what is verse 27 says if we lie or we hold any doors verse 27 say neither give place to the devil so when we lie or don't take care of wrath or anger it actually allows a demon to get into our spirit and then our secured our mind is not renewed anymore snot to do now it's black we basically fed the black dog and it's not like a full demon possession like but it is an evil sphere influencing us right no verse 28 29 Mel Kiper 28 29 sir I never still vesko steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the ears that you see now goes into the more things that we got to overcome if there's any stealing or corrupt communication we're supposed to build people up now don't be around there's times where the Bible says you're supposed to warn people there's times the Bible says you're supposed to review people right so this isn't like every time you got to be all gracious I mean we do want to be gracious but there are times you gotta warn and review to understand that now verse 30 was our text reading out those very God ladies you read 31 32 dark all bitterness and wrath and anger and slavery equal speaking be put away from you with all malice be ye kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake amen so any bitterness any wrath anger clamor evil speaking put away from you with all malice there's a lot of things in there I'm not going to go through all those maybe something or willing and be tender-hearted so have a tender heart be tender towards people that might sit against you show them tenderness instead of hardness praise God now go dance at the word tinted now he said the Holy Ghost is him and I looked it up and the only one that made sense to me as far as all these fear not to be wrong was sensitively reserved because the Holy Ghost is not scared of you with that so that's one of them what's one of the definitions like you're the Holy Spirit isn't scared the Holy Spirit though has reservations about when he comes down and he's sensitive to the right atmosphere so let's look at this now you got you have a good understanding a little bit about this Paul says don't breathe him don't offend him with all these things like bitterness like wrath anger malice corrupt communication stealing lying angry you're not not dealing with anger see that here we see that okay let's go through a few quotes I think you'll like these by God's grace I think you're really lacking the ramesses old God is my prayer wake up the church to an old-fashioned all-night prayer meetings I've never done one of those but I'm praying to God witness up to that wake the people up to a spiritual atmosphere oh it takes that to bring children to Kingdom it takes the atmosphere right this night while we're sitting here if this right atmosphere would take place the entire group would be refilled with the Holy Ghost every search six person will be made well it's the app scare that does it you can take a headache and put it in an incubator and keep the atmosphere right it will hatch out of the chicken not an incubator I've done that at school we did that one time it works because if the atmosphere that counts put a chicken egg underdog you know hatch a have to be a real steel dog right there right real gentle dog it's the atmosphere and that's what it takes in the church today not so much starchy Creedon theology of course but the spirit of living God pouring down upon his people to bring a spiritual atmosphere not once a widely this total I believe it's that it's hard for the Holy Spirit to work I understand it's hard for God to work sorry forgot to work why because Satan's badly whatever side it's not a picnic right we're on the front lines of a war Amen praise God we are it's not to discourage I go so hard I'm not gonna try that's not the attitude we want to have we want to say it's hard but with God all things are possible amen now I'm taking this thought of hard that left eye looks yellow on mine but I said the TV does maybe is nice is good I'm jumping to a different sermon to show how the Rebbe says this over and over again but the right kind of music on the piano the organ everybody that is fear that Jesus Christ is there I'm going to be everything that we need up something we'll go to taking place atmosphere that's the hardest thing there is to do and that is to get the people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing so I'm not talking about an easy thing to do I'm talking about that this is a hard thing to do the hardest thing there is to do is to get people to really worship from their hearts and really believe from their hearts amen holiday via he says again God doesn't fall upon denominations God doesn't fall upon mechanical devices God the Holy Spirit fell upon men man is God's agent and the hardest thing that God has ever had to do was to get one mortal to believe another you believe that they couldn't believe Moses God give two signs approve the people that he was sent from God for their deliverance you you believe that well isn't he the same yesterday today and forever think about that I don't even have the gifts of a brother Brennan or Moses and I try to get people to bleed he could hardly get anybody to believe and he had yes see over saying this is a difficult thing to do it takes God because then nobody gets any glory but God but we've got to do our part we've got a yield you've got a surrender we got to repent we have to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit now we're back to the quote where he said it's hard do you know what the Holy Spirit first came and we do remember of course remember it was on the day of Pentecost when they were all one place and one Accord so see this proves that we've all got to come to church we've all got to be in one place and then a week now that we're here one place now we just got to get in one Accord one by one thing you want to decide or one passion that word means passion one passion they met me we've all gotta want to see God move in our midst and then there came from heaven a sound like a rushing mighty wind they had to get the atmosphere right now jump into a new quote now you're the patient he's in the para line I want you to kind of come over this way if you want I'm sorry if you will I want you to stand there I want you to clear just let yourself be quiet just want to contact you it's just a little difficult you don't understand what I mean no you're now you're we're strangers aren't we I've never seen you knowingly I don't know nothing about you and we just met here at the time now the Holy Spirit is so timid you know very timid I must find favor with him first so brother Brandon had to find a favor by what repenting by worshiping by getting in a channel getting all any evil thoughts any evil thinking any evil desires he hadn't heard that out the repair repentance and work and then he finds favor with God how many what God's favorite Laughing Man I ask for every service as for God give me favor give me your Holy Spirit give me your anointing that the people we bless when they leave here but Graham I understand we got a quiet down the reason I had to show off my phone shut off you know shut off the computers if I'm going to pray and all these things because there can't be any distractions I gotta get quiet out and really realize that God's there says it again now just a little longer it's a few minutes until 10:00 if you'll just wait this is my last night here please when you move our syrup just shakes meat up this is his gift I lose the anointing so quickly see it's a very easy thing to do to lose the anointing it's a hard thing to get but an easy thing to lose coming money it's hard to get it but you lose it oh fast and I was said Christ has gold right buy of me gold tried in the fire amen holy spirit of spiritual riches it's worth all the died out praise God the Holy Spirit very timid how he knows that very timid if you'll just be reverent just a little while longer so see that's what we're saying like we can feel good for a little service like I've had I've had a preacher thunder service while the one anoint he was really good and all of a sudden something change and I felt that too you know different churches you know not talking about I'm not saying anything bad about our church it happens in every Church I'm just saying like one misstep or one missed off if not quickly robbed back to repentance can change the atmosphere right and so the anointing of them the faith can leave so quickly we've got to just be a momentum positive and later we've got a battle to keep the faith now Reverend just as revered as you can be for the Spirit of God is very timid everyone knows that sometimes if you're moved around it interrupts people moving around and all these things like that now that's that's moving around in the ungodly way he said see you're conscious every one of you and you to yourself is a supernatural bein you know you know that you see program that psychology it's not if it is you Christ's use it while you took the people out of the multitude and took a man out of the city and given the side again is that right see there were so many people moving around rice had to pull people out of the valta tubes in order to heal them and we know we had to do that I think he gives us another example you got here Jerry says cops remember Jerry Sue's house Jesus had to kick out the people who were laughing and saying oh she's sleeping aw Jesus you're a joker he had to kick them out in order to get the atmosphere right that's right so see it depends how you're moving it depends what you're saying that's right you know you've done he put him out of the house that right and then he raised the girl is that true so see the Holy Spirit very sensitive we got to have the right atmosphere how many is here without a prayer card let's your hands want to be healed well it's so many why it's hard to tell who it who is who I want to ask you something you know I did not know you now we just got plenty of time now here don't be in any rush there at the end of the service going to the paralyzer motor have said don't be in a rush to leave right see you get to rush in the Holy Spirit is very timid oh come on preacher come on with any men close the service come on yeah I gotta you know if you got to go listen Church that's understand it just bow your head you know say Lord I love you and just walk out with a smile you know that got agenda you know sometimes you have family things are extended people need to go but if it's if it's you don't have to go you got to keep the right attitude just like I've got all the time in the world we want to see God move but man I don't want to what rush you I want you to be reverent like you have plenty of time and some of my most score is prayer times now this is interesting I hope you can understand this I don't mean this in any in any negative way but some of my most glorious prayer times or even praying for people is like right after service when some people rush out it's okay they're allowed to rush out it's problematic me for good reason but some of my most sincere wonderful times worse than God had been once people rushed out and then what was left just those who under our hat time or could stay and worship the Lord does every understand god bless mother's I know they can't you know sometimes they can't keep the kids in here I understand that and sometimes they leave to help the atmosphere right just like sister Mita said programs that thank God me is able to take Joseph out and Sarah you know so that you might be blessed so do you see that even Sunday my we were talking right after I got done preaching a lot of people left and just a few minutes later somebody got healed Church and somebody went their way to repentance 14 year old boy and I talked to him last night on the phone he's doing great by God's grace hey you've had every word I gave him I musta pray for her 30 15 or 30 minutes were weeping he's shaking you know repenting of these sins you know raising his hands to God I'm leading him a guy in through prayer repentance it was awesome and then some Academy said well Jesse the sister came up for prayer go pray for so I walked over and now she sit down said sister can I pray for you she said she looked at me she said brother she said God already healed me I said glory of her like glory to God and church and she said the very time that he got the breakthrough in prayer and was worshiping crying raising hands was the same time she was shouted glorifying God and being healed and see how the Holy Spirit it just went from one person to the next right met that need and immediately goes to meet that need what are we saying to say thank you Jesus but it was after everybody that you know and no doubt Sunday was Mother's Day no doubt I understand people need to go see mama I'm not trying to stop you from doing it I guess there was a wave of that's understandable but if people want to touch from God they got to hang around and it got a crazy atmosphere does everyone stand up alright and now I'm just being worship you can watch this way but whenever I say now do as I tell you for is it me where the anointing strikes me I don't even know what know until my brother play a tape and tell me what I said that's why they take tit because mother I wouldn't know what he didn't know what he said because it's the Holy Spirit talking you see it's just so timid the Holy Spirit just the least little thing offensive creeps you know Reverend Jesus will come to you if you're all excited he can't come to you to be reverent and believe now if one person is ministered here on the platform that's God's attitude towards every person around look at that if and this is what happened when I can send with the Holy Spirit went immediately from that person to that person whenever somebody gets a breakthrough or answer a prayer or something that means God wants to help everybody who's in the congregation because what is it it's a pouring out of God's Spirit it's God's sending down a blessing he's sending down a shower and everybody can enjoy that shower amen it's so true church is so true now the sister they got healed was sister Karen so you know sister Carrie she had knee trouble that weekend sister Beth even drove down two hours to help her because she couldn't walk around and she had trouble she said incidentally God healed her need there by God's grace very thankful for that now I'm going to skip down he says that we want everything in order right just if you let it get out of order watch how quick the Holy Spirit takes its flight oh it's dim it you let somebody start just believing just watch how it leaves me just as quick as it can it won't it just won't stay around where there's unbelief it just won't do it very very timid notice many times I see visions and then I'd speak and if they don't respond to it it moves right over to someone else you see it's very timid the Holy Spirit and see that how many understand like each service got to deal with you on something let me understand it like the Holy Spirit wants to come by and help each person but if if we refuse that and say no I'm not going to go for prayer no I'm not going to worship God no I'm not going to file through that if we don't follow through that or operate with that or let that go follow that then he moves on to somebody else so we want to be sensitive to that by God's grace yeah and the sort of the Bible says here now maybe the person sitting there with good faith believing that would help them little it will not heal them it doesn't heal them it just gives them confidence additions to know that their prayers have so high priests and sometimes they'll miss it by not knowing just how to take ahold of them it's something new it's not no more than what your past or anyone else can pray for you after all it's just the prayer of faith to save the sick sometimes basically say anybody can pray for a sick person as long as there's faith there remember sisters can have miracles get some air holes I've seen the sister cast out a demon out of the mat I've seen that I've seen it sisters gonna have any gift except preaching and what we need though is the right atmosphere and we just need some faith praise God neither faith believe it mean the believing faith Sabri understand is that help I got now he said but I have a need of God I'm just going to raise my hand now if you'll just set up for a few minutes watch be careful be quiet now I don't mean what I say be quiet if the Lord does anything and you want to praise the Lord that's worship so brother having quiet the people say just work worship but he said if you want to shout praise God he said go ahead I'm going to show you right now where he does right in a certain right in a prayer line it's real quiet but then somebody goes to shouting and then the Holy Spirit goes to the person that's shouting and they get healed so see God understand that we want it reverent but reference can be showing reverence can be crying reverence can be dancing dancing it is render they head because it's in the order of the Holy Spirit but what I mean just run around a gun you know so you talk about Felix won't get up and want to walk around not people that want to worship and the lawyer is very very very timid very timid just like it just anything like that it just leaves me and I just have to battle there's a word I forgot the bold that word he's got a battle to get that back once somebody breaks that atmosphere he's got a battle and just kind of resetting hallelujah he's kind of relaxed himself and give the people quiet down in order to start ministering again now I want to show you this video Belgrad tells you god bless you now he calls her a colored sister now colored is not politically incorrect it's black or african-american you know one time at one time I was listing programs so much color color color I went to school and the principal I was talking to principal about one of the black children I said oh the colored boy was you know mistreated and she said don't say that that's not politically correct I said halt forgive me I listen to sermons all the time from the 1960s you know she's kinda like to do that so I don't mean to be politically incorrect but listen here and I'll try to turn the volume up [Music] brother Brandon just discerns this woman's heart and here's my volumes not working again here's my struggle lord help me what am I doing wrong see the Fighting's all the way up so something's wrong Lord what have I done here is all the way up on my screen my church I'm sorry okay so see he stops the woman screaming he said god bless you II called a sister for your shouting and you'll watch this camera will go over and he'll pronounce healing on to win in there now all these guys are looking on the platform they're the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire went from the from the platform out here and now you see that black sisters rise up I think there's two of them God yeah pretty good I gotta pronounce ISM healed now what I'll do is I'll let you watch it and then I'll go back and play it again and I'll just unplug it so you can wash off my iPad okay so I want you to see that he doesn't stand up dirty now I'm sorry wait one another think those are two black women and white women Oh see see she thought me but I was talking to her but it was actually too black sisters Legrand pronounces that healed he tells that what their condition is and she stays up praising God I like I always loved this video God and then he goes back and prays for the girls leukemia okay now just a minute here let me I want you to hear it too I'm sorry again it the roles are watching or anybody else watching not sure who watches on Wednesday night forgive me I can show it on Saturday or Sunday here let me go back now stop playing on here what's going on here I use all the way up sorry Church I'm so sorry I don't know what's going on tape must be trying to enter this do that I'm just a dummy comes to this what the world is going on forgive me yeah I don't I don't know what's wrong I'm sorry I'm sorry my fault I don't know what is I'm just playing sound I was just about brother Amen was singing I will just listen and do it in there 15 minutes ago I don't get it so sorry still playing now still fine I'm just getting noticed I'm okay sorry about that I think you might be something do with that Apple TV okay for him to church I'm sorry I'm just try to do that okay so anyways I think you understand here God just loves to be worshipped so anyways the point is it's okay to worship it since the Holy Spirit praise God and Holy Spirit doesn't get offended if you're truly worship amen he likes the noise because these girls these women are screaming at the top of their lungs and that's it he's kind of stumbling out of the Spirit says I see the light over here now that he says color sisters god bless you for your shouting he's the raise up to your feet the of this this disease and he said you're healing the name of Jesus Christ and I started praising God so I think you understand okay let me move up look around so the Bible talk the Holy Ghost can be driven away how many know that the grandeur says always any wonderful you love him is he good you know there's been a little more reverence tonight I think I read this one already yeah the Holy Spirit's timid anyone knows that he just leave like he did in the Bible that struck me like huh when you move around just interferes you can't do that he'll just leave me and I just stand there so how was he how did he leave in the Bible well the Bible said he left the whole earth here mother I know this is when he left Adam and Eve member they had a holy veil over them they have the Holy Spirit anointing over them and the Holy Spirit was driven away why because it is so big as soon as they disobeyed eyes are open and they knew they were naked so shame and sin came upon them they drove the Holy Spirit way by disobeying the word here's another one you remember this his family was offended now that's a story I want to preach that one time on Easter all of Jesus's brothers were offended and James was one of his brothers the very James who wrote the book of James he didn't believe he said oh you're what are you doing you're crazy even his own brother didn't believe but then he believed after the resurrection eating the head that's right and he did not many works there because of their unbelief so unbelief bad attitudes right drives the holy spirit away here's where he says it now see I copied a basis I'm sorry it just didn't work I was born at the time that gift was savagely given to me but I couldn't do one thing that gets unless you believe it it's your faith of what I'm telling you about Jesus Christ that draws dividends on what God has did for you in Jesus name you see if that's what makes me weak in the platform that's why the reason you have to pack me out you see that scripture enough see it's you using God's Vietnam meat it's you not every one of you now just shut down on me and say I don't believe he's a hypocrite and I don't believe nothing of it there could not be one thing done mm-hmm now see the same is true for me if you look up at me and saying about he's a hypocrite he's a sinner well I do sin but my sins under the blood if I repent a man we're all we all fall short of the glory of God no matter who comes up here they're still human but see you gotta have the right attitude toward any gift of God you get sit there and condemn the preacher you give you the naked mistakes you say Lord forgive them show them the truth you know my brother madam said if you disagree on the church ages say probe say lord I pray for brother Graham that you'd open his eyes to see the truth beaver a humble like that now he gives the scripture Jesus went to the city where he was born and said many mighty works could not he do because of what because of their unbelief just read that scripture why is the approach look at the woman how she touched his garments and God healed but look at the Roman soldiers put a rag around his face and hit him on the head now if you now if you're a prophesy ER see visions tells who hit you you didn't feel no virtue because he didn't believe in the first place both both people touched Jesus right one of them touched his face another one touched in anger and maquis so it depends tonight how we want to touch Jesus amen and I just gave that example now sister Karen who got you on Sunday she was the one who was agreeing with the word the most not that you have to be the loudest but she was the one time she was stood up and shouted and praising God I love the children that or not but you did okay but she was just pulled out and she was pulling I mean I preached two hours and I said there must be some people on it by three people raised their hand where I can hardly stop because there is Poland um but member my sister uh Marie got healed she wasn't loud or anything but I remember that service she was staring at me the whole time just glued believing and just you know in tune with the Holy Spirit and she called me the next day her and Kevin called me the next day and so they she she got healed a man thanked the Lord for that now here's a way to drive away the presence people can just walk away from it because if I was at Cain went out from the presence of Lord in other words he left the preaching of the work he left offerings and what do we do here were given our spiritual offerings tonight by worse just praising you know they can God pray those are all sacrifices right because we're kings and priests and so when people don't come to church people don't worship God or the live stream and worship the Lord what happens they leave the Friends of God right so sometimes sin can drive them why other times people just straight out sin oh I'm not enough with that they leave the Friends of God remember Genesis 6 the Bible said you know they saw the daughters of men discreet God they married women just for their looks not for their character and that shake he said the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive to wrestle with man and plead with men for that he also has flesh to this day she 120 years so see there was come a time that the the sin was so great upon the earth in the days of Noah that God withdrew his spirit he was so grieved he would risk your any where he and only stayed in the ark amen there's one place where you could by God's Spirit and that was God's grace with no amen the only place on the earth at had no anointing of the Holy Ghost was in that are in word Christ the ark tonight amen don't let that stop me I know it's a booze virgin tight but brother bad uses the art knows art as a type of the bride sometimes not all the time but he does use it I can show you the only fun that priest had before no is a type of the foolish virgin but he says about the rapture we got to get into the ark for the rapture so see it's just a type you know you just use it as we got to get into the baptism of Holy Ghost okay all right quit here's our text clench not the spirit and quench let me come back to this quench means of things on fire to be quenched to go out anybody ever seen a fire extinguisher I've never even used them but I've seen I've seen somebody using that's like what that's what people do the Holy Spirit they get out their spiritual unbelief fire extinguishers and they spray down the anointing and they they just get upset with people that get the spirit and they get mad at people that want to worship God right that's quenching the Holy Spirit to stifle let's go back to the scripture clench not the spirit so don't spray unbelief on the Holy Spirit I'll try to put out the Holy Spirit despise not prophesized see we should have despised people that are trying to pray for divine healing or speaking in tongues like we had back in February we should despise those things we should thank you thank God for those things they stood through all things kick not in the glass so see neglect is a way to drive way the spirit as well and that's what we've got to be careful for the message because we know the truth we have the revelations but if we neglect to enter into the spirit then it's still driving him away I can preach and we can all anybody sign of your breach but Brooks anybody and we can all say oh we want the movie the Holy Spirit but if we neglect to pray the mess of the Holy Spirit is just the same as driving him away with sin it's just neglecting and not entering the Holy Spirit so that's another way to drive way just just not just not entering into the worship not entering into the the prayer time it takes to have the Holy Spirit amen how many one have the Holy Spirit amen he is we like to see him use more right mota see more now here's the balance here's what I told you this has to be balanced that because hero program said hey brother times closing the Samaritan Church age the paragraph 175 so you know it's all this towards yet you said while we sing this next verse I want you to shake hands like you do each night all the methods and Baptists and Presbyterians shake hands with one another and even be furthered up into each those chewing gum if you can and everybody starts laughing startled that I just be real real friendly being sociable now obviously it I'm one of them it's just like a real kind of upbeat service so that was okay 175 so six paragraphs later that's usually about three minutes oh they're going to say there's going to be a meeting and then there's three tongues interpretations program it's all calm down he just told a joke about you should add Amisha to my chewing gum you want my gum brother a menu of my gum and everybody's laughing and just with a little worship God still please cuz what's that joke trying to do is trying to loosen the beat whoa and say we need to love each other but I probably chew you're doing good I don't know if you brushed I don't want old gum anybody now the next night no this is the same night so two paragraphs later they have three standing on their feet he said God gave a message to each person so three messages three people come to the altar the next night he said did you notice last night the Holy Spirit gave us after the service was over see how you can't be in a rush to get out what if those three would have rushed out all he's done preaching let's rush out not doing your own I understand you got once once a year thing you got to go too I understand but if we're constantly leaving out church then are people really seeking the Holy Ghost or not what do you think you know this is after the preaching three messages and three Souls now I didn't bring the quote up here but I can show it to you brother Graham said the time after the preaching is the climax of the service that is the most important time is right after I say okay we're done let's sing a little bit now most of us you know differ on us we'll say okay what song retired what's all gonna say I just got to make it through this testing a couple more songs I'm gone and we all get tired right I'm not I'm not condemning anybody with anything I'm saying I'm not going to condemning anybody tonight I'm just saying we got to get out of the flesh spirit I love everybody you love me I love you we're one happy family yeah but we got to recognize his presence we got to be sensitive to his spirit if the Holy Spirit doesn't move it's not his fault it's our fault and we want we really need to come to grips with that I need to come to grips with that three messages three Souls just exactly and when the spirits figure to come back the last interpretation okay I go through that is that not by God's grace man he can tell him he can tell a gauzy joke and 30 minutes 30 seconds later the Holy Spirit speaks in tongues interpretation gourry read see cuz what is it Church I'm inside this is the joy of the Lord when he tells that joke he's got to joy the Lord you should love and love each other so much to each other to ego and the Holy Ghost moves nobody was quiet nobody was Reverend still oh brother amen oh god Jesse stop there's nobody it was just crazy you know we're happy the word streets it's true we're behind it and God can minister like that hey man the RAM should be careful Saint will come along try to run you off of the deep end but be sure it's the Holy Spirit each time if it's the Holy Spirit they'll speak directly to something that's going on it's for the edification of the church and then if you'll be real router with those God will give you more so you just keep adding more and more that's about gifts if we can be right if we can get some gifts operating you ought to frequent basis that'd be wonderful if not we can just wait in between there's no problem that we're I'm doing that but if we're ever with them which means respectful and we follow up on them if we follow up on them and make sure they're right and confess that they're wrong God will add more to us like I said I've never had a time where it operates frequently it seems like every three or four years we'll get a toga or something like that or unknown interpretation or something like that so we obviously know that the gifts are not operating on it on a current basis but also we have to say - are we praying to operate are we are we praying every servicemen so see if we don't pray for it we're not going to get it if you don't ask for it you're not going to receive it he said ask and it shall be given on these matter is that out by God's grace I hope it helps I'm gonna try to close to this Wow okay grace all right um hey let me see real quick I thought I had another quote after this do I know okay I just want to close with this insurance like I said you are showing your faithfulness tonight and I tell you I appreciate that and the people that are really behind it if we can get a hold of this I think it'll do a lot of force honey like for example when I walked into Bible believers I would god I got there 45 minutes early there was already 10 people there praying reading their Bibles 45 40 minutes before service and one of them was assisted they got healed and I'm not making a law like that asking like that every time but I know they're there every circuit sir it's not part it was to their children go to Sunday school and they have to be there 45 not seven but see we had Sunday school on for a while but then we no one was coming and that's okay I'm not I'm not upset with anybody I'm just saying if you want the ministry you got to come a little earlier amen I'm happy to minister to the children in Sunday school we've got to make time for that it's got to be the number one priority right and if we want to see more of God moved by the Holy Spirit it's got to be our number one priority then mm-hmm I'll never forget when John and I prayed on a Sunday night we prayed for 45 minutes just shouting it was at this this this pulpit at Waterloo we prayed for miracles and then God said probably five or six miracles in that year my wife got healed of the migraines the brother got different touches I can't remember John wrote down one time I need to email know ask them about that we just kept writing them down because we prayed for in just a few months later it just starts happening and sometimes I forget that you know sometimes we forget that so tonight I come here I have a meeting after work so I got here 30 minutes before service and four people are already here and I said Laurie you know back that's what that's what we'll do it you know that's what we'll do it where we can enter into God's will and not every time does America have to happen but let's say like this if God speaks to you and you're blessed it's kind of like a miracle for you you know today it's kind of like an instant God did something for me it's kind of a revelation for you so I just want to make sure I say that I got its grace and I've been trying since I cancelled Sunday school I've been trying to get here 30 or 45 minutes early every Sunday morning so I can pray here for half an hour I didn't when brother Brooks was here excited to get songs ready but every other Sunday I was either here or in my office on my knees praying for 25 30 minutes before serious and if you can join me that'd be fantastic but if not I want to try to pray and see if we can get into that because of this like I can't take these folks out of the message nor do I want to what I want to do is live those ones amen but we can't neglect them see so and I don't want to make anybody feel bad unless it's the Holy Spirit convicting them then I don't mind you know I don't mind that is this that mean that I'm just telling the truth you can't get mad at the mailman for the mail he brings it's just his job and deliver the mail right so if I'm reading my bearings mail or gods down from around us that's not my fault it's just what the word says you know if I got a bad attitude and said you bunch of lazy Smith's never here 30 minutes now see I gotta go overboard got to the flesh right Jerry are you bunch of lazy no good for nothing Smiths you know I don't you see I don't do that trying to be gentle because the Holy Spirit is gentle unless you reveal good you know really hard she like you generation of vipers you know but those are for Pharisees we're not Pharisees church we've left the creams we left the denominations we're in the presence of God what I tried to just I'm not here to impress you I'm here to be God's messenger and you're here to be God's servants praise God because we want to truly serve the Lord so we got to keep that in mind let me close to this brother Graham use the words of the church anybody remember this from Christ mister God revealed brother Branham just got done preaching the seals like three months before this he's go he's leaving Jeffersonville for a while and it gives one more word to the church before he leaves let's just look at it and it's all about reverence and keeping the atmosphere holy and all these things and loving everybody loving everybody like the Bible said number tender-hearted you know I remind you the children they get care very books on library like every Saturday and one of the Care Bears is tender hearted there he's always so kind you know he's just so tender no matter if so he's gloomy he's just tender and sweet right he's got these got that gift well see that's what we need to have not and that's a kind of a silly childlike thing but that's what the Bible said have tender hearts one toward another I should always be tender towards each one right should be tender towards my children I should be tender towards my wife because that's what the Bible says all right I want you to remember that brother devil year left in the church and charge this Tabernacle see I'm in charge of this church I'm not claiming to be a good leader Church I'm just trying to follow the Holy Spirit if I ever make a mistake just come tell me about it now be tender hearted under the Holy Spirit see the pre pastors always under the Holy Spirit not about under and either is left here and he believes the message who teaches it just as same as I do right and anytime that you want to you can see if it to come here brother devil you certainly do you good I'm sure he's a great servant of Jesus Christ right I know Norman devil since I was a little boy he hasn't changed one speck only got closer to God I remember when I first saw now somebody chose Methodist platform when I come back to Tabernacle someday I'll baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ and here is the message that I'm going on a real Gallic servant he promised I'd and brother devil goes through many strains and heartaches that he doesn't show here at the Tabernacle but being that the Lord lets me have a little sight into people's life I know when he goes through a whole lot of it see and he certainly goes under a lot of Labour and strains and things and you you people here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb held up the hands of Moses as he's great in the word so if you pray for me that will help me out just pray for me that will be holding up the hands for victory now here's where it gets into it love one of the what's the greatest force in the universe divine love what's the Holy Ghost love what is God God is love above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember by morning see Satan won't let that stay that way a church I said this before just give me have patience with me last year this time an officer last year in April I told my wife out loud night I gotta be careful when I say out loud I told my wife I said this is the happiest I've ever been as a pastor and the very next week or two we had a family leave the church and disagree with some doctrine which is five and now since a year then we've had three more families leave plus two young men leave so what am I saying I was at the big sweet group honeymoon Tyler I'm half so happy everybody's enjoying the preaching but brother Adam said but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way I understand that I'm understand you go through seasons of life churches go through seasons what seasons of happiness and mountaintops and everybody's on fire but then you got to go down and you got to be tested and try every Son of God must be chasing a mat so now I got to be able to say that people even disagree with me or don't like me what I gotta say love you anyway because my love for God and you is not depending on how many people here paint eyes my love for God is dependent upon nothing it's just my love for it hey I just got a love hint see you can't always keep the revival Satan attack the early church around the booking Baxter said Murphy had more martyrs all these things they had to flee their homes and spread they got driven out of Jerusalem member that and uh in a nice inspire I did not in a nice them is whatever that over me they got driven out of Jerusalem they kicked all the Christians out see God allows seasons no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make it started so my dad tells at some point after the happiness stage Satan's going to eject somebody with poison which is unbelief or sin it will bring some critic or unbeliever and sit him down and causing the fellowship with you under the Quietus that they seek they'll sit there for a while and just be real quiet and you'll get to trust somebody and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and it'll start through the church with it in other words somebody's going to get it evil anointing or maybe some people maybe many people and it's going to try to infect the church like a cancer but what overcomes it love don't you take sides of this so when someone starts accusing a met or atom or me or some of our sisters will protested this and this don't take sides of them you say I don't know don't have nothing to do with anything else you just stay loving and sweet and kind to one another Anna see because now you're pleasing the Holy Spirit cuz the Holy Spirit's tipping right he says it if you got a bad attitude or if you're upset or something like that or if you're fearful or scared or something he sets them to that pray for that man or woman that he'll be saved to of that woman or whether it is just pray for that hand stick with one another see when the problem comes don't leave the church yeah unless God tells you to you know but if you don't tell you don't leave you stick with everybody love you each other because every church goes through struggles how many know that and stay with your pastor please stay with me if you feel that it alone stay with your past and see he's the Shepherd at you give him respect everybody here respects me so well my proceed he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so he's God now do you remember that car Gatien said Amen the enemy will come look he's telling them he's warning them you're all happy now just preach the CEOs he dug all these revelations but let me warn you Satan's going to come and when he does just clean that much closer together and that's again like that's why I like to do two services on Sunday it just gives us a little more time together Church and if we can talk between services or talk after it's just so important just to be around each other how many understand that amen if you miss church and you're sick or something how do you feel you feel sad you feel just disconnected right you don't feel like I love these people mind they love me and we're just a happy family in Christ Jesus you know things are looking up crisis with us you know we lose that connection and the one that the devil is using for enemy will either get out because you just love it about or to come in and be one of you hey man what are the other the love of God will either overpower that person to repentance or drive away and we don't I don't even we don't care about numbers if if someone doesn't want to love God it doesn't a lot of people here it's better that they go I'd rather have six adults here on a Wednesday night that all love God then they have 10 12 50 50 that are all argued and busted and upset all these things like that we just want God's Spirit in them don't even care about the numbers I appreciate fewer than this when I told me one time it was just pay and mean with the old adults here one night back at Waterloo we're the only ones I'm not sure what might have been on Thursday night remember and Bay took Malachi to the restroom with Lydia and I think Acacia too and I was preaching to the phone only sister Kathy was a phone streaming us and so there's no word of that little church and up you know I preach this as hard as I would tonight minutes grain because you know what if the world will to shove me that's fine but I know one person who's not shutting me I know one person who's watching me and that's Christ he wants to see how I act in the good times and the bad times and we cleaned together no matter what happens no matter what troubles come our way we just clean that much more to get a don't never clan above you or make yourself pledge well I'm only fell tripping with Adam between services nobody else that's clannish right we're one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away because you're not my right hand he's my left hand I wanted to stay there even though the tip of my finger I want to stay right there every part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body believers sustained right exactly one another riot at with one another and now you got facial notice comes your size you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on this for the church how we behave ourselves the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places don't stay at home if that's a big if right there if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for the doors to open up yeah man thank you Jesus yeah let's big if now this heart can mean your mind right because you get a Holy Ghost filled people that backslide and they might not want to come to church I've seen it probably five or six times they just go through trials you know it's we got to pray for them but God if their Holy Ghost field they always come back a man God's in your heart you can't hardly wait for the doors to open up yonder to get here to fellowship with your brothers see I can't wait to see amen I can't wait to see Adam and our sisters you know I like hugging the brother Christy I just I like that they're my brothers you know yeah we're just you know right now we're together and we all we love each other I can't wait to see them here Church if you don't feel that way I'll tell you this time you got to pray if you don't want to get their sisters and hug each other's neck your brothers don't hug each other's necks something's wrong with you because we are body because we're Madison now gives the scriptural backing these two scriptures because we're in the last days the Bible absorb as much more as we see that they approaching so the Bible says we must gather more as we see the Day approaching that's why I'm not going to cancel many Sunday night services although it wears me up but the Bible said we got to come together more and I a church I know I'll tell you if I don't have church on Sunday night and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get it tired or discouraged and I'm going to go home and start mowing and work it around because I just I get tired and discouraged and I know myself I'm going workaholic sometimes and I get so stressed out I'll get less sleep I can't fall asleep at night I'll get a 5 even before my alarm goes off and I get sick because I get stressed out and want to work too much in not doing enough for God and I'm condemning myself I've got to just devote that whole day to God and it helps my walk with the Lord that's just my testimony you know that's my battle so we got to come together with one another in Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another this this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love for another so brother connects that scripture to coming to church the way to know we love each other is that we come to be with each other amen and worship God stay right together so see why does every understand why hammers so much on church attendance now maybe it might have seen hammer into you but to me I feel like I just got it does it right understand down brother Graham says if we don't do this Satan's going to get in whatever with the spirit of Rome is divide and conquer what's the easiest way to divide us well we never we live so far away we don't we never see each other during the week the easiest ways to get us not come to church right like with our the two brothers we bless their hearts but they fall away they don't come to church and they don't rule some of them won't return my texts isn't my text on Z what's the first thing they don't come to church you see because this is where the Holy Spirit is preached this is where the Holy Ghost can wash clean amen and they don't want to be clean because of whatever maybe it's gilding they're ashamed ourselves or maybe they're just loving sin I don't know but that's what the Prophet tells us if the brother you think he's little wrong or sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness springing up because it will affect him and it will take the Christ right out of my life if you get bitter with somebody will take the Holy Spirit right out of your life now poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run in from the tabernacle here it'll kill the Spirit of God look how Bible uses that it will grieve him so much it'll drive it away it'll hurt your pastor Oh Lord it'll do everything see don't you do that now what I did is I cut off that quote malice is ill-will a desire to enter somebody well I just can't wait to get back at them I'm going to give them a piece of my mind I'm really going to show them what that's for spring it's 5:8 jealousy is edgiest you believe they have a they'll they have that better than a how to do well the pastor he does this better than I do it and this is the sister and that brother has it better than I do they get jealous well they can treat it better than I do hatred hatred is extreme dislike or disgust even message churches see that's Galatians fighting we got to get rid of that because of hatred well if you have that and don't know confess it you want to hear the kingdom of God this is the last month let's say Murphy well Graham said you just wax that much closer together draw up take the buckle that something's about the armor of God as the brother testify the minister here the other night just about having a buckle see the buckles on the whole armor of God just call her on Tiger I move up right close to another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you the other Lord tonight amen did that help you to see how a sense it we must be the holy spirit a Sunday Lord willing at the morning service I'm going to take this thought and kind of go with a little more just kind of remind the church you know you want to see the Spirit of God once you're fully committed I bring some of these back I might bring some more different things along these same lines if you want to see more of God we need somebody man we need people that are going to be devoted to a man and I've been open to this to church let me say this if eleven is the earliest we can get here then we can just pray from 11:00 11:30 I've open to that - I don't want to scoot anybody that wants to see God so I want to make that known as well maybe pray 15 minutes or whatever I want to make that known but the thing we got to do is if you want to see more of God if we want the Holy Spirit we got to have favor with it how do you have favorite it if that song you sent a man seeking love him worship Him that's how we get favored with the Holy Spirit that's prayer that's through contacting God so hope this is okay even you have a song missing but something like that by God's grace while he's coming let's just our heads for where to prayer here tonight yeah miss for children so let me switch over al Qaeda thank you sir thanks remind everybody appreciate it the only father Lord we love you Lord we're thankful for this word we don't want to offend the Holy Spirit we know we will at certain times but Lord you're quick to forgive you're so quick to be merciful your Bible says you're rich in mercy but nor we know it will be a battle to crucify our flesh and to get out of the flesh and into the spirit or we just want to see a church lower where we see more of you and Lord it's going to just going to take a little more sacrifice it's going to take a little bit more love it's going to take a little more your God than what we have Lord God so we ask Lord you to anoint us Noren as we yield to your Lord God we ask that we could catch a vision this Lord the hardest thing there is to do in order to create this atmosphere but with God all things are possible with you Jesus it's possible the Lord as your prophet said we don't want to be in a rush you'd only be moving around Lord and I believe our church is one of the very Reverend Church or the mothers are so good with the children to get them out right away are other Saints that don't have a little children are just so faithful and so reverent dear God now help us in our minds well that's how all of us that's where we need all help to get rid of any mind battles dear God thankful for the church's efforts well now I want to give a full effort all the time dear God I want a better effort or God Lord these are not just prayers but they're from my heart not just filling up toddler or straight from my heart let love bind us together Lord God your prophet said whoever has God has the majority whether it's one man or one hundred we can have the majority we know you're not interested in numbers Lord God help us not to be interested in numbers help us to be interested in faith worship reverence love grace will be installed may these be the seeds more that come to fruition we can see the Holy Spirit continue to move whatever now then you do something wonderful we appreciate that in between you're teaching us you're teaching us you're instructing us you're

prepare us for this word to teach us how sensitive you are and larger and - it's where we're fighting all these demons we're fighting all these spirits it's a battle but it's a battle we can win it's
