========================================

we're not going to do that we're going to read from the scripture we're going to preach this morning I got quite a lengthy portion of scripture to read and I was reading it again this morning should I read the whole thing but it's an interesting story so to speak if you'll listen to it you'll be blessed because we're going to talk about maybe the greatest King even greater David was a great king but this King was a great king king jiah we're going to we're going to read about that in the scripture almost probably read the whole chapter and first we would just uh like to pray and then we'll open our Bibles to 2 Kings the 23rd chapter after we pray heavenly father as we approach you this morning with reverence Lord we ask your blessings upon this portion of the service Lord that our hearts would be prepared to receive the engrafted word which is able to give us exactly what we need at this very moment we are going to look into the scripture and I pray God that you would help me to deliver what is on my heart hide me behind the cross of Calvary give me the right words to speak this morning that my words would will bless me and not condemn me but my words will bless also the ones that are listening for we ask it in Jesus name amen I've been having a little bit trouble ears been plugged up and the doctor trying to get those unplugged they're not unplugged yet I've had a lot of physical problems but I'm here and you probably know that my wife passed away March 2nd so I'm still in overcoming that but uh I'll tell you what she told me before we read the scripture I preached the the funeral she died March 2nd the funeral wasn't until March 12th I I forget March I forget when and I made a schedule to preach just a couple days later and I wondered I said am I preaching too soon but I remember what she said she always said there was nothing going to stop Keith from preaching it's what my wife said sickness he'd go preach if he was sick and that's what I'm doing I'm doing exactly what she would want me to do in 2 Kings uh chapter 23 22 because we're going to look at 23 maybe too uh chapter 22 Josiah listen that was eight years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem and is I heard you're still turning your pages for you find your place he was 8 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 31 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was Jedi the daughter of adah ab boscus now I might pronounce a lot of these words wrong and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord now remember that first of all I want you know what the word Josiah means whom Jehovah heals listen you're going to find out as we go on what happened to Josiah he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in all the way of David his father and turned not aside to the right hand to the left brother BL said it's the middle of the road gospel he didn't turn to the left or the right but there was things going on when he was ruling you'll find out and it came to pass in the 18th year of King Josiah that the king sent sh the son of aelia the Son Of mashalam The Scribe to the house of the Lord saying go to H Kaa now hilaya means Jehovah is my portion now I want while you're standing you know brother Brandon went to or Roberts uh his great big uh office and how beautiful it was and this other one how beautiful it was and brother Brandon went home and says man who am I you know and you know and everything and God spoke to him and said I am your portion he had a little office with a typewriter yeah okay and it came to pass in the 18th year of Josiah that the king okay we we'll kep down go to up to haaiah the high priest that he may th the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord which the keepers of the door have given gathered into the people and let them deliver into the hand of the doers of the work that have oversight over the house of the Lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the Lord to repair the breaches of the house unto the Carpenters and Builders and that's common we all do that and Masons and to buy Timber and heun stone to repair the house howbeit there was no Reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into the hand because they dealt Faithfully they were trying to do what was right remember trying to do what was right but all around them you'll find out there was something not right in hilah the high priest said into father The Scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord and elak gave the book to shaan and he read it something's happening and shaon the Scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and delivered into the hand of them that do the work and have oversight over the house of the Lord and shaon the Scribe showed the king saying heah the priest ha delivered me a book and shaon read it before some people believe that's the original five books of Moses you know and it came to pass but it was hid hid away when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes something be to happen that's what happened in this day the revelation of the seven seal the opening of the full word something begin to happen brother Brandon said it became a new book I want you to stand too long I can let you sit in a minute and the King commanded heah the priest and ham the son of shafan theore the son of Micaiah the shaon The Scribe and asahiah the servant of the king saying go you inquire of the Lord for me and for the people and for all Judah concerning the works of this the words of this book that is found great is the Wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened into the words of this book to do according to all that is written concerning us you may be seated we'll stop right there but we're going to go on in a minute I wonder if I could title this message the new book I wasn't looking for it but it found me I wasn't looking for it but he found me now this book it's a document they found and see at that time I was reading in a commentary Matthew Henry's commentary I love this commentary he tells exactly what was going on during this period of time he said at that period of time they had a what they call a a verbal reading of the law every seven years can you m only every seven years but even that was not practiced and let me just tell you this this is what was going on can you imagine Josiah did what was right according to what he thought we all do that we do what is right according to to what we think is right at that time I going to read this people generally took up abstracts like our abridgments to save the themselves the trouble of writing the people reading the book at large sort of a ritual directing them in the observance of religion but leaving out the main thought particularly the promises and the threatenings That's What affected Josiah so when he begin to see what was in the book see brother brand said when those seals was opened it became a new book still the Bible see the message came from the Bible the Bible didn't come from the message the message came from the Bible see they even it was a command for the king to every once a while to write this law a pin over again they were not doing that it was not exerted I forgot to bring a handkerchief with me so the motel I got me a bunch of kleenexes I did everything I did everything but what my wife as she was living told me to do she said I always carry your hanky with you you can wipe your nose not with your fingers but I forget I'm a preacher so I don't have her you know you know what it's like when you you lose part of yourself you know I better not talk about that I'll start crying but see I want you to see what was going on in that time and that's the same thing down through the church ages The Messengers kept bringing forth the word through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and to the full word when it came to pass in our day in my day now I'm a old man now I used to say the only person that called me an old man was my wife uh you know brother B said don't call your father old man or your wife or your mother old man you don't do that you know so uh I could tell a lot of stories I usually try to do that but I won't you know first of all another thing did you know there was a prophecy given for Josiah even named his name before he became king here it is first king 132 and he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord and said oh altar altar thus say the Lord Behold a child shall be born in the House of David Josiah by name and upon thee shall shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense and the and men's bones shall be burnt upon them see what happened in this day when the message came forth judgment judgment did you know that I experienced this I I've been I got saved in 1968 I came in the message receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost In 1980 but I've seen it come to pass how what is going on and and so some Realms if you mentioned brother Bard's name it's almost like a curse word you know why because it brings condemnation on brings condemnation see but that's the way that's the thing my nose have disappeared there they are I always found out don't get nervous when something goes wrong because it's once you don't know what goes on when you go overseas what goes wrong I got up to preach sometimes from the public The public's way down here I preach with no lights I preach from candle light uh lamp light uh all kinds of Lights a lot of places they have brown outs I preached many different places oh I can't tell stories I don't have time huh I was up in the mountains preaching you probably heard I probably told this story before when you talk about brown outs and they had a brown out up there and up in the mountains and uh I was having a crusade meeting outside and and all of a sudden the Lights Went Out we had cell phone light flashlight or something all the lights went out and the people up there the people dressed different than in the Lans they're more primitive up in the mountains of the igaro tribes and they begin to leave I I'll just make a short a story short and brother Dan and my traveling companion for 1993 I guess and he was I glad he was speaking in English he kept saying oh my God oh my God oh my God I stood up behind the pulpit and said there's a man I no no no no microphone there was dead there's a man here that can turn on the lights and all of a sudden they came on my did we have a Revival service that day oh my but see you look at it in this time it's brother BR said it's scien proof that it is the truth we don't worry about whether it's the truth scientifically spiritually and what was said to come to pass of the message of the Seven Seals in their closing that's the message of the entire Bible Seven Seals closes the New Testament sealed it up that is true and we know that is the prophetic utterance by scientific and by the word there three was given the witness to it that it's the truth everything we have need of is in the book everything we have need brother brother's Revelation was Progressive even after the seals open it was Progressive when he uh uh who is this MDC you want to understand about your theology who is this MDC and you go on and read and read and read and read and read but I always like this quote uh uh in the visible Union of the Bride you see the new book I wasn't looking for it but he found me I wasn't looking for it I was running from the presence of God I I it uh I'll just say this I got to throw this in once in a while and my wife's funeral in the funeral after we got home a brother it was live stream he turned on to the video and he watched the video and he contacted me right away did you know as I walked away from the casket there was doves flying from the casket literal doves my son went to the funeral home and said we do not do anything that it was real so I thought i' see brother B said this same word sucked up through the at through these and come out and come to a head and all that life that come through there picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture when you are separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to your new spiritual union not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you I wasn't looking for it but he found me I wasn't looking for it see that German that was in me found me now we're going to go on now things begin to change around Josiah you know can you imagine he ran rained the best of his AB that's what we all did that's the way I did I was Baptist by birth I I I went to church every Sunday I we we never missed the service and my dad would throw cold water in my face even when I got older and made me go to church we was always there always there I was always there Sunday school class always there always there training Union and even I was always there I was trained I knew the scripture but but just Parts abstracts not the whole thing you ought to be thankful that you got the whole book not the Bible but the revelation of the word of God lot of people read from this Bible do you know the reason you got this Bible do you know the reason you got the King James version of the Bible let me give you the reason King Elizabeth back around the 1600 she was the Virgin Queen she had no heir to the throne so who became king King James from Scott he became king and the first thing that he wanted was a new Bible because even though the other Bibles was good some of still had the ltin Vulgate in it he wanted a new Bible he got all the scholars together that's the reason you got the King James version of the Bible because Queen Elizabeth was a Virgin Queen and had to bring King James to become king ain't that beautiful nothing happens by accident amen see they were begin to change he did the best but he had not kept up what he was supposed to do he didn't even necessarily know what he was supposed to do you will find the history maybe the his father the one at you know they always had a lot of kings that just didn't do what they was supposed to do even King David committed adultery you won't find out about Josiah but it was just ignorant just like I read I read read from the scripture they had no reading only abridgments what the priest the high priest and the you know all in control well we'll give them this we'll give them a little here why because probably just like today the nicadan say conquer the lady keep under bondage even back then to keep them under bondage see it was a prophecy given to J Josiah he would be obligated by his word word to open the king's ey for whom he fornew he also did predestinate to be conformed into the image of God what is his image it's in this book it's in this book thank God we had a prophet coming this hour Elijah turn us back to the word it was always back to the Bible back to the word back to the word the word of God is the absolute back to the Bible see and you as we read on in our scripture this probably throws a lot of people for a loop let's just read some more now in 2 Kings chapter 22 and see now go ye and verse 13 go ye inquire the Lord for me and for the people and for Judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the Wrath of the Lord has candled against us because our fathers have hearken honor word of this book do according to that which is written concerning us so I the priest and abah and abdor and Shon and all these went into holdo the prophetess see that the wife of Shalom the son of tiot the son of The Keeper of the war Rob now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college and they communed with her and she said un them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel tell the man that sent you to me thus sayth the Lord behold I will bring evil Upon This Place upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read because they have forsaken me and it burned incense to other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched but to the king of Judah was sent you to inquire of the Lord thus say thou shalt say to him thus sayth the Lord God of Israel a Touching The Words which thou Was Heard because our heart was tender and thou as humbled thyself before the Lord when thou heardest what I spake against this place against the habits thereof that they should become desolation and a curse and is rent thy clothes and went before me also have heard thee sayith Lord behold therefore I will gather thee into thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered into the grave in peace and th shall not see all the evil which will come upon this place is't that beautiful we've been called out of Darkness walk in this Marvelous Light but we will not come into the condemnation we won't come into the Judgment you know there's going to be a Rapture I always said this you know brother Brandon said the dead in Christ shall rise first and uh just like when the Dead Rose during the time when uh in the old in the when Jesus was there when it was hanging on the cross and it was finished and many of the Saints Rose from the grave and there was Abraham and Sarah walking around looking at this and there and everything it's going to be that way again that they're going to be walking around and brother B said when you see brother so and so so and so that died and you see him again you know it won't be long I am expecting a visitor just a beautiful young sister that I married 56 years ago knocking on my door she won't even have to knock she'll come right on in I'm going to see her again amen see see but it was a woman prophetess did I read you saw that didn't you absolutely God can use women you know tongues and interpretation it still should be operating in the church it didn't be do do away with it when I was a good Baptist they didn't believe in it they didn't interpret uh the scripture right when that which in part shall be done away when that which is perfect has come they thought that was the full word of God that's the Bible just the Bible you know but we have a full word now that which in part shall be done away now we have what was perfect we have the perfect word of God in its fullness now I got a little bit more a little bit more scripture to read you won't believe this I got to throw this in I don't like to live a tip in the mo and I wasn't going to do it until a memory came my wife would always want to leave a tip so I had to she's still with me no matter what amen now see it rent his clothes such turmoil you know I look I need we all need to look at ourselves let's just turn there James chapter read this got to bear with me I might preach a while I got a little more go okay James chapter 1 and verse uh 21 we'll start with verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be ye doers of word and not hearers only deceiving your own s for If any man be a hearer of the word and not a doer is like a to a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetthe into the perfect law of Liberty and continue with him he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer the work this man shall be blessed in his deed can we all just look and glad God's perfect looking glass that's his word and I could say where do I stand where am I standing I've been you don't know how many times I've been asking myself that here lately since she's passed you know where do I stand you know I used to I preach some places and I've been rebuked by preachers not that I was wrong and I'd go home and she wouldn't be with me and she'd always be there and I could cry on her show one time I got rebuked so bad I preached in the morning and I I after I preached I knew something was wrong and I tried to give an altar service it was dead and I went back to uh my room it was a Saturday night I was going to have a Sunday morning I went back to my room I just prayed Lord I need you more than I ever needed you so I went back I preached with more freedom than I ever had and I began to have an alter service and I halfway through my service the preacher turned like this and wouldn't look at me and I knew when I was getting ready to give an altar service he was getting ready to stand up to stop me so I just prayed for the whole congregation you know that brother left and when I got home I told my wife and she had been reading a chapter in Ezekiel and it gave me a message from that she was there she's not there now but uh that's if you got to help me I say this go home and kiss your wife a hundred times see do I see a Believer the brother do I see a believer the Old Testament or of the New Testament do I see a make believer an unbeliever or or a believer that wouldn't stand and listen to the word of God that's the way I was oh I'm plugging myself it's on YouTube at brother Jesse but brother cam Smith April 7th I preached there is a message that I preached in the afternoon it's called I'm not ashamed of my Heritage it was my life story in honor of my wife and I told about all these things you need to tune in and listen to that one you'll understand where I came from and where I'm going amen see now it's been 2,000 years brother man send a message Masterpiece God has been again making him a masterpiece because he struck at him to get a piece off of his part of him a rib to make a wife for him now that perfect Masterpiece that he struck at Calvary he got a peace over him it's just the New Testament that's all he fulfilled the Old Testament Jesus Christ CHR fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled the old the new and the old is husband and wife and it's taken the new the old to foreshadow the new Christ come the Masterpiece now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament another Masterpiece in the make in the Bible now you know just to say this it's always the Bible we cannot deny his word some people I believe the message of the hour I believe it's a perfect interpretation of the Bible brother brandom said that now but here he said it's God's power to transform now listen to this some people say well there's something it's not in the Bible it's not written in the Bible it's not this not this that the people in the message say now it's hard to say this God's power to transform 91165 now it's hard to say that it's very hard because I'm speaking to people who feel the same way I do and the way I have been for many years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of the Angels just Behind the B there this has become a new book things that's been hid it's been revealed as God has promised a new book it's become a new book that's not the one I was looking for oh this is the one see brother B said spiritual food and due season now back there at the beginning of the Seven Seals no people don't realize the house of faith in Dayton Ohio the one that ordained me brother Frank Ramy years ago my wife was raised in that Villa he was going to brother bram's meetings this is back way back when the seals was preached and he came back to the church he came back then to the church he came back and said to himself either brother benam is a true Prophet or a false prophet he got him a room in a motel and he testifies how the angel Lord came in that room and he went back changing the order of the church and when he did that who wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you come forward the first one that come forward was my mother-in-law sister Lena Todd and that's the beginning is what caus me to be who I am and my daughter who she is not my daughter but my wife who she is they come down in a pyramid form stood there and told me to return back there and speak on those Seven Seals he'd be with me and he showed me what they were the lost things he showed me what they were the lost things he showed me things that it became a new book things he thought was right he found out what things knew came o it became open to him I always thought it was sealed on the back of the book it had to be something wasn't wrote In the book but it turned out that it was made known that he cannot do that it isn't something that's written in the book it's something that's been hid in the book for whosoever shall take one word or add one for word so it's a mystery that's been in the book in the seven Church ages each one are produced a mystery water baptism and all these other things always hid in the he said brother R said he said and and the lat see in church age he said a messenger Malachi 4 Revelation is going to do two things according to Malachi he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the my Mysteries of the seven Thunders Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be the divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turned the heart of the children to the Pentecost of fathers exactly so amen amen but think about Josiah think about yourself I think about myself you know it became a new book I always had it when I was a little boy I was taught to carry my Bible and you know what I was taught to even wear a suit I was That's The Way We Were My dad became a deacon I always admired my dad I was I thought he was the toughest guy there World he's 6' two with a flat top haircut I remember one time this you can you can see that you can even go back and you'll like that tape I was telling you about you can go back on that you can listen to it he I got me a a 54 Chevrolet stick shift never drove a stick shift in my life I just got my driv he said take off down the road okay I took off down the road turned the corner all of a sudden there's this drunk came down and he stopped on the dime he got out and looked at me like he was going beat me up all along I didn't know my dad had followed me and there was my dad looking himen like that and you like God just took off and ran do you know what I told this told this the other night and and Napoleon if that man would have laid a hand on me my dad would have knocked him out cold if a if a man would lay a hand on my sons I can knock them out cold too or my dog that's exactly the I was in the Army I was learned how to defend myself I'm an old man I could still do it now amen I could tell you some Army stories too but you tune in you might hear some I don't know but the morning message i t i tuned in more than that I told things that one sister from Mansville I've learned things about you I never knew when she listened to those things see you know I forsake the teaching of my father I began to drink smoke I remember about I don't know I might not been 16 I I would sneak off smoking I'd light them up i' go down and probably told this here before I'd light them up my turn my dad couldn't see and on Sunday morning my dad would get me up if I you know even a 16y old boy he throw cold water in my face to go to church that's the way he was we I'd go I didn't want to go but I'd go I'm glad he made me go and I hung my shirt on the bed post we had bed post thing I don't know if you got them there I left those cigarettes in my pocket I got up that morning and standing there my sister she's about 5'8 or 5'9 she's tall and my dad standing there and I been over and the cigarettes fell out of my my dad hated smoking cigarettes wasn't he hated it they fell out of my pocket right in front of them I've told this many times God as my witness I have a complex over that I don't remember what happened I don't I don't remember and I don't want to ever remember but see all those things with my growing up you know to honor God I I was raised to honor God but I I went against his teaching I remember I remember in Korea coming back drinking and standing out front of my Hooch and everything you know and talking to my buddies and they were talking and I don't know why I said this I said the I begin to tell them what my daddy told me and you know what they said oh you preacher they didn't know they prophesying I couldn't get away from him that my dad follow me wherever I went standing in line when I was getting ready to go in there and get inducted in the Army my Dad forgot to give me something I had this cigarette and I put it out and stuck in my pocket real quick I didn't want to see but God's grace the grace of God the grace of God Amen try to move on see got too many stories but see there's going to be a bride brother R says sure as I'm standing here in in this PO there will be a bride that's worse in the blood of the Lamb the lamb will be living among them showing the same signs of the Resurrection after 2,000 years so I'm want to read something again in Kings if you find out when his eyes was open you realize what he did he went through the kingdom you can read that in uh First Kings later second king I mean I lost my place uh you can read that later that how he went and begin to destroy all the evil familiar spirits sodomites there were one after I mean I you read you you go home and read the 23rd chapter you'll see what Josiah when his eyes was open they were all around him until his eyes was open they were everywhere one after another all kinds of them that whole chapter but when his eyes was open he began destroy everything our nation is in Big Time trouble of course the Revival there's no more National Revival your church here can have a Revival but no National Revival it's over with it's the coming of the Lord they used to have National revivals you know they used to be revivals with the the bars would close down and everything in Wesley's day all them it was a great time the early reformers or preachers but now he's dead but there's life in the bride and she's got the gift of God in her to take that word to the world he chose joah to bring a change for a short time that's what we got a last short quick work a change for a short time it's all around us it's it's unbelievable the things that they're passing you know know Murder babies it's unbelievable not other things homosexuality a short change before God would bring judgment to make a difference to carry and express the word of God the life of God the seed of God the life of God the seed of God is in the bride to make a change for a short quick world I believe there going to be a bride Revival I believe it but it become a new book in his heart it should become a new book book in your heart and a new book in my heart bring us to deeper birth pains I remember flying overseas some of my greatest I used I love to preach outdoor Crusades I preached I don't I couldn't name how many I preached in colleges in the Philippines but my greatest sometimes is on in sit down next to somebody and begin to deal with them brain surgeon scientist talk a brain sign these different people I I was try brother Clement Oren have passed away my pastor actually he passed away then about a few weeks later I went to Napoleon to preach and then in August I had a heart attack that was in 2022 but I told him I said these Filipinos you talk to them he just couldn't get himself and there was this lady standing right across from us she began to express herself she was a Baptist and I knew the Baptist I didn't believe this but she said I believe I got a call PR pre I just told her according to the scripture that she can't preach and she accepted what I told her in the airport waiting to board the plane I've did that so many times I could I could I could write a book that time that I went to you my wife didn't like to talk to me saying go and use the bathroom in the airport but that's what I did when I came out there was a young man he he looked about my age back then that was back years ago but he had the same color of hair as mine and he said I know you're looking at my hair but he said I'm a Jew newly converted Jew I can tell you where my people came in and I've been in New York and seen that I preached in New York you know why he followed me waiting on me when I come out you know why he followed me he heard me with a group of people standing in the a waai in the board and I was I was witnessing to him what had gone on in the Philippines I got a loud voice my wife said I can hear your voice on one side of the building to the other side of the building but that's why and you know what I went to my briefcase the only book I had was a 70 weeks of Dance and I gave it to that dly converted Jew I I I I'm expecting him to walk up to me one day when I get there and say you remember me and that brain scientist tell you remember me sit down next I said one time I said I got to have I got to have somebody to witness to Lord give me somebody and I sat next to this guy and a little guy had a great Cod on he would go like this I noticed his menu was not meet he was a Japanese Buddhist monk I asked him begin to talk to him and I begin to tell him I said what do you think about Jesus Christ I said God said I he I didn't tell him Lord you said him next to me I've got to witness him and I witnessed it even I don't know if it did any good maybe it did so wherever you are if the life of God is in you use what God is given you Second Kings again chapter 23 verses 1- 4 I have this written down now he's making a proclamation here and the King sent and they gathered to him all the Elders of Judah Judah and Jerusalem now this is his eyes was open this is before he's going to ring judgment and the King went up to the house of the Lord and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the priest and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant which was found in the house of the Lord if I like could read you the revelation of the Seven Seals and the King stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep his Commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to form the words of this Covenant that were written in the book and all the people stood to the Covenant and then he begin to clean house sometimes we need to clean house at our own life

man they are dead than a DA I would be so sad some places I go to now I don't think you're dead in da I'm not saying you're dead but I go some places they are dead or da absolutely dead no life sometimes I think a lot of preachers that preach the message are you what they need they need the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what they need you could have a gift to preach without the baptism of the Holy Ghost gift of callings of God without repentance but that gift is not really truly put into operation in the right way until the man meets God in that Pillar of Fire and reach the on the back side of the desert I got my education on the back side of the desert for 12 years until you meet God face to face and here I heard the voice of God and I'll never forget the voice that I heard but the voice did not help me it helped me it it did I'm not saying it didn't but it wasn't the voice that saved me it was obedience to the voice when I obeyed what he said if God's dealing with you to a closer walk it's an obedience to him as he deals with you in your life see it's the fullness of God in the godhead B now is in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his yeah am you you know
