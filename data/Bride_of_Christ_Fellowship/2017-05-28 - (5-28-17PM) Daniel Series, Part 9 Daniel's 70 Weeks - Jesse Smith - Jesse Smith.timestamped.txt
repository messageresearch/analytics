[27:19] [Applause]
[27:25] let's go Daniel chapter 9 it'd be good
[27:38] Daniel chapter 9
[27:42] we're sorry verse 2 alright well how do
[27:45] you be seated suck out space um two
[27:50] years ago I preached Daniel seven weeks
[27:52] I went back over the notes and I don't
[27:55] give anything different so I got the
[27:57] same notes I just added a little bit
[27:59] beforehand you know because as you
[28:01] learned you know you grow and learn I
[28:02] have it
[28:03] no silly program talk exactly the way I
[28:07] taught it you know because following his
[28:09] quotes you know so I'm just gonna start
[28:11] with a few different quotes just about
[28:13] the prayer that Daniel offers here
[28:15] before he gets the visitation from Gaber
[28:17] which is just a powerful humble prayer I
[28:19] just think it'd be good for us to read
[28:21] that or working our way through Daniel
[28:24] have you enjoyed it praise God man I've
[28:26] enjoyed it but hymns like wow you
[28:28] creatures do Daniel always been confused
[28:30] about Daniel he's the kind your notes on
[28:33] that or something welcome to help you
[28:36] I'm just certainly enjoyed it so he's a
[28:39] book I've had a lot of questions about
[28:40] but as I've read through it God is
[28:42] taking away all my fears you know I
[28:44] bought in understandest is like the
[28:45] Bible basically serpents itself then
[28:48] program has all the correct
[28:50] interpretations that we need so it's
[28:52] really been a wonderful time to have a
[28:55] lot more confidence about bookid and in
[28:57] praise God now we're down into Saturday
[28:59] just three more chapters ten eleven
[29:01] twelve so as a pastor it's hard to be in
[29:04] the middle of something it's always
[29:05] either be nice and to finishing
[29:06] something or start stuff it's hard to be
[29:08] in the middle I just want to get it done
[29:10] you know but it's got to be patient
[29:12] Daniel 9 verse 2 let's read it together
[29:16] 22 tree in the first year of his reign
[29:19] again understood by books the number of
[29:23] the years wear out the word Lord ladies
[29:26] Jeremiah the Prophet and he wouldn't
[29:28] come for 70 years in the desolations
[29:32] part is only father Lord we love you and
[29:39] father we're thankful for this word Lord
[29:40] that we've just read Lord this was
[29:43] written
[29:44] 2500 years ago 2500 years and yet Lord
[29:49] 500 years after this your son Jesus came
[29:52] to the earth and vindicated Daniel as a
[29:53] man of God
[29:55] so your profit came in this hour
[29:58] vindicated it again said how it was true
[30:01] and gave us the true interpretation Lord
[30:04] and it's so amazing or because this
[30:06] revelation was sealed up unto the end
[30:08] time Thank You Orden we're living in a
[30:11] day where we don't have to scratch our
[30:13] heads and be confused about the Book of
[30:15] Daniel the Lord you've given us the book
[30:18] of Revelation to help fill it and
[30:19] Jesus's words and and the prophet of the
[30:23] our Lord revealing these things that
[30:25] were grateful for of us Lord to stay in
[30:28] tune with prophecy Lord God we thank you
[30:31] for this time in your word bless it to
[30:32] your people Jesus Christ nee I reset it
[30:35] unless you can see their free stuff
[30:45] all right so hold on begin there I want
[30:49] to begin now come when you can switch
[30:50] over a fishing dancer I want to begin
[30:52] with Daniel 9 1 so there's some quotes
[31:03] here come on crazy Lord chapter 9 we
[31:08] view this honey to readers maybe I don't
[31:10] let him al Qaeda always there to help me
[31:12] anybody I don't add on the on different
[31:14] ones I could use a little bit of help
[31:16] it's it's really great to read the
[31:18] prayer that Daniel prays and this is the
[31:20] kind of prayer that an angel will visit
[31:23] you after if you look at this prayer
[31:25] it's quite it's quite a prayer or the
[31:27] we'd say for us maybe the Holy Spirit
[31:29] you know visiting us so let's look at
[31:31] this chapter 9
[31:34] Jamis if foster brought us one of the
[31:35] commentaries I like to use it's also
[31:38] part of the table software that no
[31:41] random you know without voice of God
[31:42] puts out so it must been one of his
[31:44] books or must have use it at some funny
[31:46] time said chapter 9 took place in by 37
[31:50] which is about 13 years after the vision
[31:53] of chapter 8 remember this book is all
[31:55] out of chronological order you can't
[31:57] have to go by you know the verse one of
[31:59] almost each chapter see you know would
[32:01] you person was ruling and so Daniel was
[32:06] about 83 years old at this time still
[32:08] praying and fasting
[32:10] eighty-three years old prey you're
[32:12] passing same god help me to understand
[32:14] what I were I'm living in see if you're
[32:16] doing it now Church it's a good inside
[32:18] here and do it later maybe Batman you're
[32:20] not doing about sorry to that that you
[32:23] could keep that humble approach to God
[32:25] of the Colombo he was 83 years old so
[32:30] numbers about 550 now chapter eight was
[32:33] about 550 he was about I'm saying
[32:36] Shepherd I'm sure sets he was 70 years
[32:39] old there so that's where we're we're
[32:43] looking at here he he said quite a old
[32:45] man down chapter one you know Darius the
[32:48] Mede had succeeded
[32:50] Belshazzar that took place in Chapter
[32:52] five this was in the first year of
[32:53] Darius is rule there according to
[32:56] chapter verse 1 in verse two Daniel
[32:59] received understanding through the books
[33:01] of Jeremiah the 70 years of Jerusalem's
[33:05] desolation on Jeremiah wasn't even two
[33:08] generations away he was just the
[33:10] previous generation yet just written
[33:12] these books and already within one
[33:14] generation one prophet of God could
[33:16] recognize another prophet of God as
[33:18] being a true prophet aren't you glad
[33:20] we're just one generation after brother
[33:22] Graham aren't you glad you can recognize
[33:23] whether I was a prophet and then when we
[33:26] go back and read his sermon to listen to
[33:28] his sermons God could inspire us to be
[33:30] able to see exactly where we are
[33:31] prophesy hey that's the robust so he
[33:36] came to understand through the reading
[33:39] of Jeremiah's books what day an hour he
[33:42] was living in and he found out there
[33:44] were just two years away from rebuilding
[33:46] the temple there just two years away
[33:48] from that is 70 years have to accomplish
[33:50] so here's a scripture you know that that
[33:52] Daniel was reading the whole land should
[33:55] be desolate these nations of the circle
[33:57] king of Babylon seventy years number
[33:59] Hanna dies it'll be - and Jeremiah's
[34:02] like hi he's like hot if you want to
[34:04] leave that go ahead but the Holy Spirit
[34:06] told me seven the real prophet will be
[34:08] vindicated by his words coming to pass
[34:10] all right and then he set out after the
[34:13] 70 years I'll punish the king of Babylon
[34:15] that nation their iniquity we're going
[34:18] to go to pass seven with us save the
[34:20] Lord after seventy years be accomplished
[34:22] at
[34:23] Avalon I will visit you perform my good
[34:25] work toward you and causing you to
[34:27] return to Jerusalem so something had to
[34:29] happen at 70 years something had to
[34:31] happen for them to go back and just at
[34:34] the end of 70 years Daniel gets inspired
[34:36] the prophet of God gets inspired to pick
[34:38] up the prophecy for his day in order to
[34:41] get the people prepared a man sounds
[34:43] like brother branham here gonna pick up
[34:44] Daniel pick up all these jobs revelation
[34:47] he would have pick it up in his hour to
[34:49] prepare us for the rapture Olivia
[34:52] the man said I want you to notice out
[34:54] that you'll get a alien I was stood from
[34:56] his people from his church without one
[34:59] church service brother man steady who's
[35:01] preaching so I wonder if he's preaching
[35:02] on the streets or in people's houses
[35:04] without any church to go to without any
[35:06] hymns to be saying but when he say
[35:08] himself in the midst of all this he's
[35:10] still out on to what the Prophet said no
[35:14] church to go to nobody to fellowship
[35:16] with everybody went to eat in temples
[35:18] everybody worship their idols no
[35:19] Christian songs nobody believed the same
[35:21] thing he did and in 68 years from a
[35:23] young man of about 12 14 years old he
[35:26] was taken down there he held true to God
[35:28] and understood by Jeremiah's property
[35:30] that the days were almost accomplished
[35:32] how that would warn the heart of any
[35:34] true prophet of God today that we look
[35:37] back and see what the true prophet said
[35:39] and know that we're at the end time he
[35:43] said I understood by books that Jeremiah
[35:45] my brother many many years ago
[35:47] prophesied that Israel would stay down
[35:48] here 17 years that's times about
[35:51] fulfilled and he made himself ready and
[35:53] he called it fast rectified himself with
[35:56] ashes in sackcloth and put it on his
[35:58] head went to fast and pray need to
[36:00] understand about the day they were
[36:02] living in and if Daniel the prophet of
[36:05] the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books
[36:07] and bring him to such a place that even
[36:09] Israel coming out all them alive was
[36:11] coming out of that allowed to go back to
[36:13] the homeland what caused him to fast
[36:15] with sackcloth and ashes
[36:16] how much more on it to do to the Church
[36:19] of the Living God to know that time is
[36:23] fading out and shall be no more and the
[36:25] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[36:27] great melindam ready to set it as we
[36:29] approach the coming of the Lord do
[36:31] expect creatures not to say fast anymore
[36:33] or you expect them to say fast
[36:35] and I would expect them to say fast as
[36:38] well right I'm saying before the
[36:40] restoration they had to be praying and
[36:42] fasting to understand the word and
[36:44] before our restoration that we know is
[36:46] Joel chapter 2 imagine you have the same
[36:48] condition what does it Church it's a
[36:50] consecrated life to Christ that's what
[36:52] we want how can we spend wases time
[36:54] gambling swimming holes on Sunday you go
[36:59] to Sunday's a day of worship no time for
[37:03] the Lord for the babysitter I'm glad you
[37:05] got time for the Lord tonight god bless
[37:07] you tonight anybody that does the other
[37:09] time the Lord they know it's their
[37:11] blessed because of that just run down if
[37:13] the pastor speaks on something they
[37:15] don't like you get up and go out if the
[37:17] church holds too long while you're
[37:18] dissatisfied look at our condition
[37:21] compare our lives of that prophet one
[37:24] man and the complete Kingdom with no
[37:25] church to go to it not nowhere else to
[37:27] go to it was torn down and burned down
[37:29] his City as people was captive 68 69 70
[37:32] he had two years left before the decree
[37:36] from Cyrus and this just reminded me
[37:39] this this is the top part of the quote
[37:40] perhaps that people are dissatisfied
[37:41] today remember the prophecy for us I
[37:44] read this morning we're going to be
[37:45] satisfied with God my mam's noticing
[37:47] people are dissatisfied but our day we
[37:50] should be satisfied to come into church
[37:52] that's prophecy and this is a this is
[37:55] actually the one I read this morning I
[37:56] could have used this but it's tough stay
[37:58] the Lord we brought back by the spirit
[38:00] to the fullness of Pentecost now he also
[38:03] said this got no time for the Lord
[38:05] whether man money isn't everything money
[38:09] won't move the spirit II said it's not
[38:11] what light a gun works he moves by
[38:12] spirit and the moving of the Spirit
[38:13] comes only to a life consecrate to the
[38:16] word now what's that true in Daniels day
[38:17] the spirit moved nothing to understand
[38:20] the written word when he consecrated his
[38:22] life to God and so that's what we should
[38:25] be doing consecrated electric got here
[38:27] he says it again remember I've read this
[38:29] part about three or four times your
[38:31] program talks about spiritual gifts if
[38:33] you want to see if you have to sacrifice
[38:35] some of your ideas you have to sacrifice
[38:36] some of your time in prayer you have to
[38:39] sacrifice your stubborn will and break
[38:41] down in humility the whole curse you
[38:43] move is sacrificial so here's Daniel
[38:46] sacrificing time
[38:48] meals all this you know his own clothes
[38:50] you put on sackcloth and ashes young
[38:53] he's sacrificing at all in order to
[38:55] understand the written word of God how
[38:58] much more should we do that
[38:59] praise the Lord so see that's why I keep
[39:02] bringing that up wherever that's why
[39:03] this week I want to join me in prayer
[39:05] try to pray a little extra in the
[39:06] evening time I know we always try to
[39:07] pray in the morning that's fantastic
[39:09] let's add some more time program says if
[39:12] you want to know you got to consecrate
[39:14] your life he so here it is oh if there
[39:17] was ever time we ought to be setting
[39:19] ourselves in order to pray it's now it's
[39:23] right now that was a 1961 for we are the
[39:27] true servants we see the letters of the
[39:29] Apostles by the warnings of the Holy
[39:30] Spirit were in the last day the Holy
[39:33] Spirit speaks in the last day men will
[39:35] be heady highminded lovers of pleasures
[39:37] more than lovers of God look at what
[39:39] I've said I understand it by letter so
[39:41] just like Daniel understood the
[39:43] conditions by letter or the grandma true
[39:45] prophet picks it up and said I
[39:46] understand these things by letter O CO
[39:49] or amen
[39:50] he picks up second Timothy chapter 3 hey
[39:53] Ned
[39:54] I just want to just bring this out just
[39:56] real briefly we're not time to read
[39:57] discipline never there's going to be two
[39:59] groups really there's going to be group
[40:00] that makes the rapture and the group
[40:02] that misses the rapture I know there's
[40:04] individual groups within them I know
[40:06] that I've thought that but if you're if
[40:08] we're the Bride of Christ our kind of
[40:10] coastal faith should be growing and we
[40:13] should be purified from all iniquity
[40:14] that's what Titus 2:14 says remember
[40:17] Jesus tells the made believer you did
[40:20] many wonderful works but your workers of
[40:21] iniquity
[40:23] so our works of iniquity all purged out
[40:26] while the the make believer keeps they
[40:29] keeps their works of iniquity they keep
[40:31] city they can't get free from the sin
[40:33] but we're supposed to be delivered from
[40:34] all iniquity more but the others are
[40:38] iniquities abounding because a lovable
[40:41] of the love is waxing cold so we just
[40:44] got really two groups we've got a group
[40:45] role in the rapture they're going to be
[40:47] they're going to be full of love they're
[40:49] going to be growing in faith growing in
[40:50] the word growing in spirit and these are
[40:52] not they're actually going cold or all
[40:54] the time towards the real Holy Spirit
[40:55] and we're going to be loving God more
[40:58] than our pleasures but they're going to
[41:00] be loving pleasures more than
[41:02] because the Bible said there more and
[41:04] more to seed so the more people get
[41:06] deceived the more they enjoy the
[41:08] pleasures of the world but the Bible
[41:11] says immerse I do want to read out if I
[41:13] can't I do want to read out because that
[41:14] would bless my heart yesterday I was
[41:16] pretty this was a sermon I thought was
[41:17] going to preach this morning then the
[41:19] Holy Spirit corrected me but it was so
[41:20] great to see you know the numerous
[41:22] stands raises for there are like eight
[41:23] or nine hands
[41:24] it was just asking for pairs that really
[41:26] was a help to me as the pastor that's
[41:28] encouraging
[41:29] second Timothy 3:14 it's just taking me
[41:39] a lot to get there okay so the prophecy
[41:45] is verse 13 evil men and seducers shall
[41:47] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[41:49] deceived in the world are deceiving
[41:53] other people right but verse 14 but
[41:55] continue thou thinkest learn and has
[41:58] been assured of never from Paul's
[41:59] writing knowing of whom thou has learned
[42:02] them see assured so we're growing in
[42:05] assurance more insurance of truth oh we
[42:08] were taught these things not by a TV
[42:10] preacher with my brother Brandon a real
[42:12] man of God remember who we're learning
[42:14] them from were being assured because of
[42:17] the person we've heard from a true man
[42:19] of God brother Brandon and the last
[42:22] thing I've been hitting on this a lot
[42:23] because this has been one of the battles
[42:25] you know and memorable medicine spirits
[42:29] attacked churches so the spirit in the
[42:32] last year is to draw people away from
[42:34] church and draw them into sin all these
[42:36] things like that that's why I keep kind
[42:38] of hammered on that because Christians
[42:40] gather more as they see the Day
[42:42] approaching without with Holy Ghost
[42:44] filled Christians not with sinners with
[42:46] Christian but the Bible said and this
[42:49] might be good for us to read the Bible
[42:50] say everybody else will be separating
[42:52] themselves sensual not having the spirit
[42:55] and going out from the true believers so
[42:59] it is really is a separating time you
[43:00] know gathering the tears first and the
[43:03] weak will be gathered into the garner
[43:04] now what I do is good but I think you
[43:06] remember
[43:07] Jude 119 says their sensual that means
[43:09] they they're only they're only concerned
[43:11] about their fleshly appetites right and
[43:14] they suffer
[43:15] themselves from relief verse not having
[43:17] the Holy Spirit I see the Holy Spirit
[43:19] address together yeah it will never
[43:22] start a war between us that's our own
[43:24] humanity our own sin it always always
[43:27] always unite the believers praise God
[43:30] that's what I love to see people you
[43:31] know like I said in the house of God no
[43:34] matter how much people shout you know or
[43:35] like I said I've had shouters leave I've
[43:38] had answers and screamers leave and
[43:40] we've had we just want to see people
[43:42] feed on the word game and living holy
[43:44] ain't been gathered Moors we see that
[43:46] day of rotate man it's a good indicator
[43:48] you're walking the truth remember
[43:50] program said this is the age of
[43:51] self-love that's our warning we cannot
[43:54] love ourselves we cannot love material
[43:56] things that replaces the love of God if
[44:00] they're not careful they'll feel that
[44:01] they'll feel the coldness of the last
[44:03] state church so we gotta fight against
[44:06] that here's the quarter I was talked
[44:07] about this morning by Babson you saw
[44:10] about use is pride you see you get a
[44:12] family guy oh he'll their their child
[44:14] their little family Oh bless them but
[44:16] then he said as it continued he said as
[44:20] long as they continue let's say a family
[44:21] but first thing you know they got an old
[44:24] junk car maybe they're walking under
[44:27] they'll get a good car better hold
[44:28] versing you know they want it better but
[44:31] the world calls a better class
[44:32] associated move into a different
[44:33] neighborhood and then there they find
[44:35] out they become influenced by the wrong
[44:36] influence see even where you live is
[44:39] important to God because it shows your
[44:42] influence
[44:43] you must always stay where the kingdom
[44:45] of God is and the glory of God is poured
[44:48] out stay that we can be spiritually fed
[44:50] day and night see why the home church is
[44:54] so crucial milligrams said because if
[44:56] not the first thing what comes
[44:57] separation in the home husband and wife
[45:00] father and children mother and children
[45:02] see that we should be getting filling
[45:05] after filling right pouring out that's
[45:07] why fell this morning good pouring out
[45:09] of the Holy Spirit on me amen
[45:10] if you toe it gives you strength give
[45:12] you encouragement maybe forgiveness
[45:14] maybe gives you a edification you know
[45:16] you got to constantly stay in that
[45:18] presence that's why after service is
[45:20] such important time to worship and enjoy
[45:22] God's blessings even I got a little
[45:24] shower garage Laura's doing some service
[45:26] oh sure I start crying and thank you God
[45:29] it just Heather eise's my heart that's
[45:31] excessive pouring out because now I'm
[45:33] not walking the flesh not walk in the
[45:35] spirit then I can say flow through me
[45:38] all these spirit I'm not concerned about
[45:40] the flesh I'm concerned about the spirit
[45:42] amen
[45:42] let's see people give that up yeah the
[45:45] whole gather in the morning what happens
[45:46] they get lift it up all right number
[45:50] three
[45:50] Daniel set his face to seek God's face I
[45:53] like that free to message one time our
[45:56] face seeking God's face in Albion and a
[45:58] sister in pants got healed afterwards
[46:00] she could even move her arm and she came
[46:03] up after service and told brother Jim
[46:04] she's a friend Jim look at this I was in
[46:05] the battle trainer singing or something
[46:07] she's look at this she said I felt a tap
[46:10] on my shoulder and she turned around
[46:11] nobody was there and then all the pumps
[46:13] training back to arch pinning move her
[46:15] arms five or six T's and I preached on
[46:17] Jezebel painting her face and she had
[46:19] paint on her face what was it it was God
[46:22] trying to show her that that's the truth
[46:24] of God and I don't know what happened
[46:26] after that but I know God showed her
[46:28] that was truth right there right during
[46:30] the preaching a man our face seeking
[46:35] God's face I know God loved that message
[46:37] because it wasn't mine it was his
[46:38] that's a Daniel did right here his face
[46:41] seeking God's face alright now let me go
[46:45] back here okay yeah I want to lay this
[46:47] out to just this will help us the Bible
[46:50] says prayer and supplication prayers you
[46:52] know like Jesus taught us to pray to
[46:54] talk to God but supplication is what is
[46:56] a humble request for fade mother that up
[46:58] in the Hebrew is saying God give me
[47:00] favor so as we read this prayer look how
[47:03] daniel is asking for favor of God
[47:05] returned to us visit us again
[47:07] forgive us give us favor let your hope
[47:10] return let your joy let the joy the Lord
[47:12] return let your people come back to the
[47:14] land he's up he's giving a supplication
[47:16] and when you say God give me a favor on
[47:18] the job or give me a favor with my
[47:20] family give me a favor that new guy at
[47:21] work I like that for that and it's
[47:23] trying to witness the guy work there and
[47:25] I'm gonna try the witness this guy don't
[47:26] work to him like lord give me favor with
[47:28] him that's a supplication I want the
[47:30] favor of the lower like for every
[47:31] service I want God's favor I love us
[47:34] understand a little bit about prayer
[47:36] supplication
[47:36] no prayers I God forgive me no but when
[47:39] you that's part of it our Heavenly
[47:41] Father you know I'll be thy name
[47:42] that's all true that's better that's
[47:44] wonderful that's very godly but when we
[47:46] want God's favor situation that's a
[47:49] supplication will you give me favorite
[47:51] God and how'd he do it he did it with
[47:54] fasting sackcloth in verses 4 to 19
[47:57] Daniel offers a truly humble prayer God
[47:59] keeps the servant with those I'm sorry
[48:01] God keeps his covenant with those that
[48:03] love him and keep his commit my fall was
[48:05] so beautiful we read I just want to stop
[48:07] and empathize that Daniel says I know
[48:10] you'll keep your covenant to those who
[48:12] keep your covenant you get that so those
[48:15] that don't keep the Covenant God's not
[48:17] going to keep the covenant with them it
[48:19] shows every kid every promise and
[48:21] covetous by conditions because other
[48:24] people don't care they don't care about
[48:25] counts covenant god's promises god's
[48:27] conditions they don't care so they don't
[48:29] keep it but the people that love God's
[48:31] coming it will keep God's coming and
[48:33] then God will keep his covenant with
[48:34] that God honors those who honor him amen
[48:40] so if we can't let's just quickly read
[48:42] you this here mankind Lydia maybe you do
[48:46] some reading for me I'm appreciate that
[48:48] that's their hearts then when you doing
[48:51] Gouri okay so I don't we do five verses

[49:12] okay but if you do that and I prayed
[49:17] unto the Lord my God and made my
[49:19] confession and said O Lord the Great and
[49:22] dreadful God keeping the covenant and
[49:24] mercy to them that love him and to know
[49:26] that keep his Commandments we have said
[49:28] have committed iniquity and have done
[49:30] wickedly and I rebelled even by
[49:32] departing from my precepts and my
[49:34] judgments neither have we hearken unto
[49:36] thy servants the prophets which spake
[49:38] and thy name to mark aids our princess
[49:41] and our fathers and to all the people of
[49:43] the land
[49:43] Oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto
[49:46] thee but unto us confusion of faces as
[49:49] at this day to the men of Judah and to
[49:53] the
[49:53] having some furious one but I'm to all
[49:55] Israel that are near better far off
[49:58] through all the countries whither thou

[50:05] Lord to us B'Elanna confusion of face to
[50:09] our Kings our Prince's and our fathers
[50:11] because we have sinned against thee amen
[50:14] thank you what a prayer he's confessing
[50:16] his sins and the sins of his people
[50:19] remember God works of Israel by covenant
[50:21] right so he has to pray that way not for
[50:23] us it's not that way it's individual
[50:25] right oh you kill us if still you still
[50:28] can't pray for the syphon crying for the
[50:30] dominations of your family the city
[50:32] we're supposed to do that but here he's
[50:35] he's he's intervening one prophet
[50:37] standing in the gap for the entire
[50:38] nation hi look at that just like Moses
[50:41] he stood the gap for two million people
[50:43] here's Daniel standing in the gap for
[50:45] how many millions at that time but they
[50:48] have all been scattered one prophet
[50:50] standing in the gap how many of us can
[50:51] standing up for our family man standing
[50:54] together the church pray for the people
[50:55] amen so Lydia what'd you do 9 10 11 12

[51:15] parts by statements apologist gay all
[51:18] Israel have transgressed I love unify
[51:20] departing but they might not obey my
[51:23] voice therefore the Christian upon us
[51:25] and the outside of the written and the
[51:26] law of Moses the servant of God because

[51:53] nicknames and understand my truth hey
[51:56] wow look at this even recognizes we're
[51:59] cursed our people are cursed and it's
[52:01] because we've transgressed the Word of
[52:02] God see now you'll get somewhere with
[52:04] God when you can see your
[52:06] condition right in man I said this
[52:07] morning you've got a K - and you can't
[52:08] go deeper pretty like it is Lord what
[52:10] have I done
[52:11] I must have sinned lord I must repent I
[52:14] must turn from my iniquity see that see
[52:17] the humble repentance that he gives here
[52:18] this is a real prayer humility okay so
[52:22] anybody moved in 14 15 16 and 17
[52:25] these are really goblets wherefore have
[52:28] the Lord wherever has a lord our subhan
[52:31] Depot and bought it upon this a Lulu and

[52:44] by people forth out of the land of Egypt
[52:46] with a mighty hand and economy we man as
[52:50] today as this day we have sinned we have
[52:55] done quickly o Lord according to all
[52:58] that righteousness I be sixty let that
[53:01] anger and that it very be turned away
[53:03] from the city of Jerusalem thy holy
[53:06] mountain because I see and for our
[53:08] iniquities of Jerusalem and like people
[53:12] are become held approach to all that
[53:15] about our purpose now therefore O Lord o
[53:19] our Lord hear the prayer of thy servant
[53:22] and his supplication and cost that face
[53:25] to shine upon the century that is Leslie
[53:29] would see Amen see him looking for favor
[53:32] there he said let your face shine upon
[53:34] us it's as if God turned his face away
[53:36] because they were so disobedient and now
[53:39] he's praying for God give us favor let
[53:41] your face shine upon us Amen well thank
[53:44] you I appreciate the readers there verse
[53:46] 19 Oh Lord
[53:48] here Oh Lord forgive Oh Lord hearken and
[53:50] do defer not for that own sake o my god
[53:53] for thy sitting that people are called
[53:55] by thy name and while I was speaking of
[53:58] bringing confessing my sin the sin of my
[54:00] people Israel and presenting my
[54:02] supplication before the Lord my God for
[54:04] the holy mountain of my god yay while I
[54:08] was speaking in prayer even the mad
[54:10] gamer whom I had seen the vision at the
[54:11] beginning being caused to fly swiftly
[54:13] touched me about the time of the evening
[54:16] oblation ah me that was three
[54:20] I'm not mistaken 3 p.m. that evening oh
[54:22] because they ended the six I believe
[54:24] that was the evening oblation if I'm not
[54:25] mistaken so you'd pray for quite a while
[54:28] can you imagine praying a pair like this
[54:29] he's quoting Moses he's quoting Genesis
[54:32] and he's quoting all these Old Testament
[54:34] Scriptures this is a condition were in
[54:36] because we haven't kept your promises
[54:38] that you gave to Joshua Moses it's our
[54:41] fault forgive me forgive the people this
[54:44] is a real humble prayer how many like
[54:45] that prayer that's a real prayer if you
[54:47] ever see one Ian was Ezra Nehemiah also
[54:50] prayed some really really awesome seer
[54:53] prayers
[54:53] paid back now in verse 20 and 21 I just
[54:59] wrote you know the angel Gabriel touched
[55:01] Daniel brought him skill and
[55:03] understanding that's in verse 22 and he
[55:05] informed me and talked with me and said
[55:07] Oh Daniel I'm Navajo important to give
[55:08] these skill and understanding now this
[55:12] case is not miracles right you didn't
[55:15] come to bring miracles he just came to
[55:16] give him understanding of the Word of
[55:18] God
[55:18] see how there's a time in season 4
[55:20] everything he was earlier he was in the
[55:22] den of lions that's when he needed a
[55:23] miracle now he needs skill and
[55:26] understanding praise God so if you need
[55:28] a miracle guess what God can bring a
[55:29] miracle if you need understanding God
[55:31] will bring you understand that's right
[55:34] look at verse 23 at the beginning of
[55:36] that supplication the commandment came
[55:37] forth and I've come to show thee for
[55:41] thou art greatly beloved I love that
[55:44] scripture therefore understand the
[55:46] matter and consider the vision look at
[55:48] this
[55:48] then it was greatly beloved in heaven
[55:51] never he had a strict diet he took care
[55:53] of his body see that he denied anything
[55:57] that transgressed the law for his diet
[55:59] he kept the diet of God he would often
[56:02] pray had three times a day on his knees
[56:04] and here he saw God for understanding of
[56:07] books and and the angel says you're
[56:09] loved in heaven heaven loves you Daniel
[56:12] why is he so interested in what's going
[56:14] on in heaven he wants to know the wisdom
[56:16] of heaven that's how we should be David
[56:19] what has had a lot for our lives for our
[56:21] church when we have that kind of
[56:23] haven't haven't has to love us save
[56:25] ahead because we want the will of heaven
[56:27] to come down to earth right amen
[56:31] ah okay now let's jump ahead now back to
[56:35] the teaching who's never seen this who's
[56:38] never seen this Adam we're here when I
[56:41] taught that brother well then what kind
[56:44] of things so either I thought you've
[56:46] never seen that I'm standing you're both
[56:48] laughing okay yeah yeah brother Kevin
[56:51] asked you to run a website it's got some
[56:52] good views it's got a couple thousand
[56:54] views there so that's encouraging you
[56:56] know I got its grace but I taught this
[56:59] in April of 2015 so I haven't had
[57:01] anything added anything to it because I
[57:03] didn't find anything wrong with it as
[57:05] I've listened to brother Branham eNOS is
[57:06] over the last two years I would find
[57:07] anything wrong so I'm going to try to go
[57:09] or try to go a little bit quickly
[57:11] through here without going too fast like
[57:14] I said it's on our website I can email
[57:16] you the notes numbers 24 gable is going
[57:20] to tell Danny all about it
[57:21] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[57:23] people and upon that holy city to finish
[57:25] the transgression to make an end of sins
[57:26] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[57:29] and to bring in everlasting
[57:30] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[57:32] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[57:35] I remember the six full purpose of
[57:37] Gabriel's visit to Daniel all right now
[57:39] Rama preached at nineteen sixty one
[57:41] there was the six things I just put the
[57:43] numbers in there so you can see it now I
[57:45] summarized this as I preached a whole
[57:48] sermon on it I went back and summarized
[57:50] what each one was finishing the
[57:52] transgression is to take away the
[57:53] blindness of Israel and graft them back
[57:55] in that's what brother Graham talked
[57:56] like I said I taught a whole sermon on
[57:58] it I tried to squeeze it in to just
[58:01] summarize it here so it's the turning
[58:04] away of the Gentiles back to the Jews
[58:06] blindness causes transgression you're
[58:08] blind you can't see what you're doing
[58:10] you know so that's the first thing to
[58:11] finish the transgression is that end the
[58:13] transgression there's no more blindness
[58:15] then brother Branham said to make an end
[58:17] of sins was Israel's sin Iran believe
[58:19] literally ends when Jesus appears to
[58:21] 144,000 okay so that's the end of sins
[58:25] program said they can't just believe
[58:27] anymore because there is how they going
[58:29] to say you're not the Messiah he comes
[58:30] down out of heaven but I could say that
[58:33] it's like Joseph revealing himself to
[58:35] his brothers we're going to type that
[58:36] out and that sir
[58:37] the third thing to make reconciliation
[58:39] for iniquity Israel's iniquity is purged
[58:41] or pardoned on the one day of Isaiah 66
[58:44] 8 in which they are born again one day
[58:47] that's what in all iniquity leads amen
[58:51] number four to bring in everlasting
[58:53] righteousness with RAM so that's the one
[58:55] thousand year millennial reign that's
[58:58] the time of righteous when the glory
[58:59] Lord will fill the whole earth
[59:01] remember Bobo says brother have stopped
[59:04] and said member I'm not saying eternal
[59:05] righteousness it's just for the thousand
[59:08] years because it's everlasting
[59:09] righteousness okay because why cuz Satan
[59:12] still comes out one more time
[59:13] right and he challenges them and so
[59:16] forth but after the white throne
[59:17] judgment it's eternal amen there's no
[59:20] more sin there can be no more battles
[59:21] it's all eternal righteousness after
[59:24] that battle and after white throne
[59:26] judgment they understand that okay
[59:29] number five to seal up the vision of
[59:31] prophecy game okay to seal the
[59:33] understanding and every of it from
[59:35] Israel and everyone else until the end
[59:37] time and a brother Graham brought up
[59:39] revelation ten seven holiday video the
[59:42] seven that messenger would finish the
[59:44] mysteries to the Gentiles that's what he
[59:47] brings up it's sealed up to finish the
[59:50] prophecy the last thing was to anoint
[59:53] the most holy brother said they have to
[59:55] anoint the Millennial temple so there's
[59:57] a temple the Millennium but not in the
[59:59] future home because the lamb is the
[1:00:01] temple in the future home he says up
[1:00:03] there on top of the pyramid you know why
[1:00:05] he's the light he's the tempo he's
[1:00:07] everything Amen hallelujah but therefore
[1:00:10] the Millennium the temple must be an
[1:00:12] anointed program said he gave us he said
[1:00:15] any Bible reader knows Ezekiel 43 is the
[1:00:17] Millennial tribes and back to the
[1:00:21] millennium and I didn't know that so I
[1:00:22] showed you what I know I don't know too
[1:00:24] much ready I'm glad he told me what I
[1:00:26] don't know so that I can know it
[1:00:28] afterwards
[1:00:29] alright so there's a 6-volt purpose okay
[1:00:33] so we see that by God's grace next is
[1:00:36] Daniel seventy weeks okay that was verse
[1:00:38] 24 now I'm going to go through this one
[1:00:40] the purpose of understanding Daniel
[1:00:42] seven weeks program said is so we're
[1:00:43] expecting the right thing in the church
[1:00:46] and the seals he goes over again and
[1:00:48] again he said the major miracles are for
[1:00:50] Jews not the Gentiles right turning
[1:00:55] water to blood a famine for three to
[1:00:58] five years that's those are major
[1:01:00] marital debts and that's not for the
[1:01:02] Gentiles we're not going to see that
[1:01:03] before the rapture he says that's for
[1:01:04] the Jews he said what having a little
[1:01:07] miracle is little very neat in forever
[1:01:09] for me every American is a Great America
[1:01:11] but we're talking about worldwide you
[1:01:12] know turning water into blood all these
[1:01:14] things he said that's for the Jews so he
[1:01:17] said we you have to expect the right
[1:01:18] thing with Daniel 70 weeks you have to
[1:01:21] expect the right thing you know what our
[1:01:22] limited and I know this is so small I'm
[1:01:24] sorry he just said he felt that I didn't
[1:01:27] have time to blow those words up he felt
[1:01:29] let it bring this to so we can see how
[1:01:31] close we are to the coming of Christ now
[1:01:34] 70 weeks remain for the Jews at this
[1:01:37] point in Daniel here
[1:01:39] it was slow 550 when I say 537 537
[1:01:45] seventy weeks are determined for the
[1:01:47] people now a week is seven years so glad
[1:01:51] you've seen this on our website I think
[1:01:53] okay I just know if you do that and over
[1:01:56] they amended who did that but a week in
[1:01:58] the Bible is prophetic for seven years
[1:02:01] okay a time is prophetic of one year
[1:02:05] remember Nebuchadnezzar seven times
[1:02:08] passed over him seven years passed over
[1:02:10] him as the Beast number and the mind and
[1:02:12] beast so a time is a year a week is
[1:02:15] seven years so God's got his rank
[1:02:17] numerology amen
[1:02:20] so Jacob works a week for Rachel which
[1:02:24] was seven years okay
[1:02:26] fulfilled her week which was seven other
[1:02:28] years are X we see that so the 70 weeks
[1:02:31] equal 490 years so the Jews had 490
[1:02:36] years ago would deal with them until the
[1:02:38] consummation and the consummation means
[1:02:40] a termination or annihilation or
[1:02:44] complete destruction okay and that's of
[1:02:49] course through Armageddon so in other
[1:02:51] words they have 490 years that God will
[1:02:53] deal literally with Israel preach to
[1:02:55] them until Armageddon until everything
[1:02:58] is destroyed until the day the Lord
[1:03:00] comes which isn't one okay so
[1:03:03] brother Ram divides Daniel 70 weeks in
[1:03:06] the three three parts or three sections
[1:03:07] the first period is seven weeks the
[1:03:12] first to here is our seven weeks and
[1:03:13] sixty-two weeks okay it's right there
[1:03:15] verse 25 no they're at four and
[1:03:18] understand that from the going forth of
[1:03:20] the commandment to restore and build
[1:03:21] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[1:03:24] shall be seven weeks and threescore and
[1:03:26] two weeks so he breaks up the seventy
[1:03:29] into three sections you have seven sixty
[1:03:33] two and one that's how God that's how
[1:03:36] the age of broke it up see all right the
[1:03:41] so the third week was one here this is
[1:03:44] I'm sorry the third section is one a
[1:03:46] week and he should confirm the covenant
[1:03:47] with many for one more week right so
[1:03:51] three plus the sixty-two gives you one
[1:03:54] more week there to make the total
[1:03:56] seventy all right now here's a visual
[1:04:00] every got the visual it's broken up the
[1:04:02] seventy weeks is broken up into three
[1:04:04] parts
[1:04:05] seven weeks or 49 years sixty-two weeks
[1:04:08] or 434 years or one week seven years the
[1:04:13] angel breaks it up I'm going to work I'm
[1:04:16] going to deal with Israel in these three
[1:04:18] sections of the 490 years how many glad
[1:04:21] I'm reviewing this that is it helpful to
[1:04:23] review it or y'all have that memorized
[1:04:25] over these two years
[1:04:26] I don't think yet exactly didn't I
[1:04:30] needed to go do my cupcake what did that
[1:04:32] mean you get what brother Han say about
[1:04:34] that can't retain everything in this
[1:04:36] sort to remember I know one thing is
[1:04:38] written on my soul I might not be able
[1:04:40] to understand it all the time but I
[1:04:42] believe it ain't a hand it's written in
[1:04:44] my heart so those are three divisions
[1:04:46] this division was until the time the
[1:04:50] temple was built this division was the
[1:04:52] time until Christ came and this division
[1:04:55] was Christ's ministry but never did get
[1:04:58] to break this in half because Christ
[1:04:59] only preached for three half years
[1:05:01] tonight have another division
[1:05:05] alright glory and this is when Kevin and
[1:05:09] Meridian after service and so father
[1:05:10] Jesse we've been in the message thirty
[1:05:11] years and that's the first time we ever
[1:05:13] understood Daniel seventy weeks I said
[1:05:15] thank you for telling me that that
[1:05:16] really encouraged me
[1:05:17] I must be on the right track somewhere
[1:05:19] god once the finally Goffe in his will
[1:05:20] to teach them in the right way so I
[1:05:22] appreciate that so seven weeks
[1:05:25] okay rebuild Jerusalem and trouble
[1:05:27] sometimes that's Nehemiah Ezra
[1:05:28] thereafter the Messiah was to come so we
[1:05:31] had to wait four hundred thirty four
[1:05:32] more years till Christ came and then the
[1:05:34] one week the Messiah confirmed the new
[1:05:37] covenant Jesus's disciples was the verse
[1:05:40] three half years but Jesus will use to
[1:05:42] prophets for the last three and a half
[1:05:44] years let me know that glory okay so the
[1:05:48] first period was seven weeks or 49 years
[1:05:51] and this is where the wall I'm sorry the
[1:05:55] street will be built again and the wall
[1:05:56] even in troublous times so Bill Graham
[1:05:59] said that was fulfilled the issue to
[1:06:03] rebuild it was March 14th 445 BC I was
[1:06:08] quite about remember our chapters 537 BC
[1:06:11] okay so it's almost 100 years later so
[1:06:16] God was really preparing his people the
[1:06:18] edict by Cyrus to rebuild it went forth
[1:06:20] and 445 until was completed to take 49
[1:06:25] years to complete the temple the city to
[1:06:26] rebuild it to Daniel the walls would be
[1:06:30] built in trouble sometimes and many of
[1:06:32] us remember when it was built that
[1:06:33] mortar block in one hand and sorted out
[1:06:35] remember Nehemiah oh I was beautiful
[1:06:36] there fighting with one and building
[1:06:39] with you that's what we should be doing
[1:06:40] fight the enemy with one hand and
[1:06:42] building up the kingdom of God in
[1:06:43] another Amen there you don't worry and
[1:06:48] there it is Nehemiah 4:17 so there God
[1:06:50] foretold it in Daniel and here it's
[1:06:53] recorded in other scriptures truly
[1:06:55] prophetic so zoobel Azra Nehemiah
[1:06:59] fulfilled this first seven weeks so
[1:07:01] Cyrus is ordered to rebuild his right
[1:07:03] there I think I got some building in
[1:07:04] here yeah I got a little bit of
[1:07:05] animation as finished okay there 49
[1:07:09] years later yeah okay there this 445 all
[1:07:13] the way to 396 that's the first division
[1:07:16] of that seventy weeks the first seven
[1:07:20] weeks or the first 49 years okay so that
[1:07:23] was a time issue wet and then they build
[1:07:26] it they finished it right there okay so
[1:07:29] what did I have here nothing
[1:07:31] okay that's good now the second period
[1:07:33] was 62 weeks and know therefore and
[1:07:36] understand that from the going forth of
[1:07:38] the commandment to restore and build
[1:07:39] Jerusalem unto Messiah the Prince shall
[1:07:41] be seven weeks and priests card two
[1:07:45] weeks so sixty two more weeks right and
[1:07:48] then the street we go again so there's
[1:07:50] the second division yet seven weeks and
[1:07:52] now the second division is sixty-two
[1:07:53] weeks all right
[1:07:55] yeah threescore two weeks yeah so now
[1:07:59] I'm like sue me now right instead of
[1:08:01] zooming into the timeline now I'm
[1:08:03] zooming out that's the first there's the
[1:08:04] 49 years of the second one will be like
[1:08:07] this that's the second part of the
[1:08:10] that's the sixty-two weeks or the 434
[1:08:13] years see now we'll get up to where
[1:08:15] Christ was born right here okay time
[1:08:20] until the Messiah begins his ministry so
[1:08:22] yeah the first get the temple rebuilt
[1:08:23] and then you have to wait to them aside
[1:08:25] gets here and then you can start on your
[1:08:28] third okay yeah so now 69 weeks out of
[1:08:32] 70 of in fulfills is that clear enough
[1:08:34] he said I'm giving you 70 weeks 69 will
[1:08:38] be filled until Christ starts his Holy
[1:08:39] Ghost ministry which I say he's still
[1:08:42] doing in the Gentiles today amen
[1:08:44] hallelujah now there's that third one
[1:08:48] the third section which will be Jesus
[1:08:50] beginning his ministry that's right
[1:08:53] there okay 30 ad the 70th week that's
[1:08:58] the 70th week 69 weeks have already
[1:09:00] passed the 70th week starts right there
[1:09:03] now brother Branham said the trouble we
[1:09:05] have is with calendars cuz the years in
[1:09:07] a lineup
[1:09:10] okay so he said there's got to be 483
[1:09:14] years right so he said here's the
[1:09:15] trouble but now from 4:45 to 80 to 80 30
[1:09:20] is exactly 475 years some other maybe
[1:09:23] even recognizes see some people don't
[1:09:26] get the years right but as we've already
[1:09:28] seen at the 69 weeks makes forded 83 now
[1:09:32] there's there's where the trouble comes
[1:09:34] right there see we've only got we've got
[1:09:37] only with the marking of the Bible here
[1:09:39] only 475 years and actually it's 43 a
[1:09:42] difference of
[1:09:44] eight years notice that a difference of
[1:09:45] eight years remembers like oh he noticed
[1:09:49] okay there seems to be a difference
[1:09:50] between eight years so here's the
[1:09:53] trouble the construction began in 445 BC
[1:09:56] and Jesus began his ministry in 3080
[1:09:59] that the total number of years was only
[1:10:00] 475 this is a year short of the correct
[1:10:04] total which was 43 must be a problem
[1:10:06] somewhere but the problem tells us so
[1:10:08] the Prophet tells of the problem is the
[1:10:10] difference of calendars remember there
[1:10:13] are three counters for the RAM says he
[1:10:16] says the Julian calendar and the Roman
[1:10:19] calendar and the Christian calendar and
[1:10:24] I don't go too fast but I got to get
[1:10:25] done got to go fast but when we get done
[1:10:29] now the prophetic calendar has 30 days
[1:10:32] in a month or 360 days in a year now
[1:10:35] remember that this prophetic calendar of
[1:10:37] 360 days in the year so that's the
[1:10:40] prophetic calendar that God usually uses
[1:10:42] but brother answered their troubled
[1:10:44] encounters now the BC for 45 to 80 30
[1:10:48] our Julian or strata version for strata
[1:10:51] me years which are 365 and a fourth day
[1:10:54] in each one then we reduce them days to
[1:10:58] our prophetic calendar program says
[1:11:00] you've got the change you have to fix
[1:11:02] the calendars the Julian and retic
[1:11:04] mother must be found the difference
[1:11:05] between them what's the difference
[1:11:06] between them and that's what he tells us
[1:11:08] so brother Aaron said use the Julian
[1:11:10] counter if you use the Julian counter
[1:11:12] that's more days in the year five and a
[1:11:15] four quarter more days in the year and
[1:11:17] if you adjust them to our prophetic
[1:11:20] calendar you'll get the right amount I
[1:11:23] know it's a little deep here but here's
[1:11:27] where we get to the math the Lord
[1:11:29] surprise school me in this but he's a
[1:11:30] madman but this is the best I could do
[1:11:33] so we must find the difference between
[1:11:36] the Julian prophetic calendar because it
[1:11:38] seems like we're eight years short if we
[1:11:40] use the prophetic calendar so the Julian
[1:11:43] calendar times that gives you that many
[1:11:45] days the Jewish calendar gives you that
[1:11:47] many days the difference is about seven
[1:11:50] years the Jewish calendar needs adjusted
[1:11:53] since the flood changed the length of
[1:11:54] the days and years the flood changed
[1:11:57] everything nowadays
[1:11:58] days a little bit longer right now we
[1:12:00] have more days in the year because of
[1:12:01] the flood brother Branham says all right
[1:12:05] okay now that's where talks about the
[1:12:07] flood I'm not going to read all that
[1:12:08] that's a lot of reading so the
[1:12:09] conclusion is the Jewish Keller needs
[1:12:11] about seven years added to it since the
[1:12:14] original way the track time was adjusted
[1:12:17] after the flood so when we add about
[1:12:20] seven to the 475 we come up to 482 that
[1:12:24] means we're just one short of 483 that
[1:12:26] we need so brother have said or what I
[1:12:29] didn't say this but you have to do this
[1:12:30] if you have the years zero between one
[1:12:32] BC one ad that takes the total of 483
[1:12:36] which is the exact amount we need okay
[1:12:40] so together the years right you have to
[1:12:41] take the Julian calendar and remember
[1:12:44] that the days are longer you got more
[1:12:46] days in there if you add up all those
[1:12:48] days and add those to the prophetic
[1:12:50] calendar then you get the right amount
[1:12:51] of days okay and that's what brother
[1:12:54] have said you said you got to go back to
[1:12:56] the calendar to fix it because he says
[1:12:57] the 445 years before was exactly credit
[1:13:00] so that decree of Cyrus programs that we
[1:13:02] can't change that that decree ago build
[1:13:04] a temple you can't change that so it has
[1:13:07] to be start from that day you can adjust
[1:13:08] the dates you know eight years less or
[1:13:10] eight years more so that's what we do I
[1:13:14] know that's a real quick through it but
[1:13:16] I want to like I said I don't want to
[1:13:18] spend a whole lot of time on this
[1:13:19] because you get the picture I think you
[1:13:20] get the picture and you can go watch it
[1:13:22] if you want go slowly through but you
[1:13:25] have to adjust the calendars now we can
[1:13:28] move on to the last week the 70th week
[1:13:31] or the last seven years so now we've got
[1:13:33] up to the time of the decree went forth
[1:13:35] to the rebuilding of temple and the time
[1:13:37] through the temple rebuilt all the way
[1:13:38] up to Jesus starting his ministry and
[1:13:40] now we're at the third part which is the
[1:13:42] last week or the last seven years before
[1:13:45] the consummation or the annihilation at
[1:13:47] Armageddon so now we're in 925 9925
[1:13:53] the third period or the final week of
[1:13:55] the seven years began after the first
[1:13:57] two periods so unto the Messiah the
[1:14:00] prince should be seven weeks and
[1:14:01] threescore two weeks so I'm showing it
[1:14:05] again to begin the middle and beginning
[1:14:07] of the 70th week okay so here Jesus
[1:14:10] begins his ministry and
[1:14:12] there's Jesus's ministries three and a
[1:14:15] half years so the Messiah was cut off
[1:14:19] during the midst of the week and
[1:14:21] everything that he was cut off but not
[1:14:23] for himself he was cut off for us a man
[1:14:26] how they feel that we might be grafted
[1:14:29] in right he was cut off that we might
[1:14:31] have a portion of God's grace amen
[1:14:34] hallelujah
[1:14:35] what a blessing so there's just three
[1:14:39] happier minutes true so now we're at
[1:14:41] sixty nine and a half weeks are
[1:14:43] fulfilled right of the first half of the
[1:14:47] 70th week okay so now five hundred
[1:14:52] eighty six point five out of 490 have
[1:14:54] been fulfilled just if you're going to
[1:14:56] get real technical so Daniel 9:26 and
[1:14:59] after threescore and two weeks shall
[1:15:01] Messiah be cut off but not for himself
[1:15:03] and the people the Prince shall come
[1:15:06] shall destroy the city and the sanctuary
[1:15:08] and the end thereof shall be with a
[1:15:10] flood and unto the end of the war
[1:15:11] desolations are determined brother
[1:15:14] branham said that the messiah was cut
[1:15:16] off all right let's do this
[1:15:19] America the destroyer of the city was
[1:15:21] Titus and the Romans so the prince that
[1:15:24] came after messiah was cut off the
[1:15:27] prince that came on em said with Titus
[1:15:29] he should come and destroy the city and
[1:15:31] the sanctuary that's exactly what
[1:15:32] happened in 87 this green is bling I
[1:15:37] think I don't know why I let that play
[1:15:39] okay so Titus he's the one who destroyed
[1:15:42] Jerusalem okay so the Messiah ministered
[1:15:45] there and Titus destroyed the temple you
[1:15:48] know less than 40 years later here's
[1:15:52] where brother Graham says it's down here
[1:15:53] this is in the first seal they asked for
[1:15:55] the Branham who was the Prince that cut
[1:15:57] it off or who's the prince that
[1:15:59] destroyed the temple Oh Graham said
[1:16:01] after Christ was cut off from the earth
[1:16:02] in the three half years of his ministry
[1:16:04] went ashore the temple who destroyed it
[1:16:05] he said Constantine no he saw beg your
[1:16:08] pardon Titus the Roman general
[1:16:10] okay so Titus was the Prince and then he
[1:16:15] says it later he said here as well forty
[1:16:17] years later Titus the general destroyed
[1:16:19] Jerusalem and scattered the people
[1:16:20] through all the work now here's the
[1:16:24] glorious
[1:16:25] once the Messiah is cut off he wasn't
[1:16:27] call for himself now we could graft it
[1:16:30] in amen programs if God went and dealing
[1:16:33] with the Gentiles we do not have any
[1:16:35] time a lot of the Jews have time
[1:16:37] allotted no man knows the day of the
[1:16:38] hour of ours let's go through it again
[1:16:41] here's the first seven weeks to rebuild
[1:16:42] the temple here's the second section
[1:16:45] which was four hundred thirty four years
[1:16:48] to Christ and there's the first half of
[1:16:52] the 70th week of Jesus ministry and now
[1:16:55] here's the Gentile age amen
[1:16:57] so God God basically stopped this period
[1:17:01] right here in the middle of period stops
[1:17:02] and said well now I'm going to grab to
[1:17:04] the Gentiles I can get a wife and Israel
[1:17:06] turned me down I'm putting her out
[1:17:07] divorcement I'm getting a Gentile bride
[1:17:10] how they do David and he's had grace
[1:17:13] upon the Gentiles for 2,000 years
[1:17:15] Amazing Grace how sweet the seventh
[1:17:18] alright and now what we're waiting for
[1:17:20] under the rapture will be the Stephanie
[1:17:22] or second half while that's going on
[1:17:25] we'll be up in glory at the wedding
[1:17:27] supper the marriage supper delay that's
[1:17:29] exactly right
[1:17:30] true Bride of Christ so there is a real
[1:17:33] small red rectangle there all right so
[1:17:38] remember the Messiah was cut off and now
[1:17:40] he should confirm the covenant with many
[1:17:41] for one week and the myth of the week he
[1:17:44] shall cause the sacrifice and the
[1:17:45] oblation to cease and for the
[1:17:49] overspreading of abominations he shall
[1:17:51] make it desolate even unto the
[1:17:52] consummation and that determined shall
[1:17:55] be poured upon the desolate now brother
[1:17:57] Branham tells us who this is he tells
[1:18:00] this is the Messiah was cut off okay so
[1:18:03] here's the quote when was the Covenant
[1:18:07] of Daniel 9:27 confirmed for weeks let's
[1:18:10] go back and show you that was Daniel
[1:18:11] 9:27 was this covenant confirmed
[1:18:13] see so many people put this in the
[1:18:16] future but program puts it back at Jesus
[1:18:18] day he said one half of it was confirmed
[1:18:21] the Covenant when Jesus was on the earth
[1:18:23] preaching to the Jews he never went to
[1:18:26] the James house at all he told his
[1:18:27] disciples don't go to the Gentiles he
[1:18:29] was to the Jews alone see any priest
[1:18:32] three and a half years that's half of
[1:18:34] the 70th week program goes on visit now
[1:18:37] and he'll
[1:18:38] last part the 70th week the last part of
[1:18:41] it will be during the time of the
[1:18:43] tribulation here after the rapture the
[1:18:45] church then there are three and a half
[1:18:49] years here that will be confirmed to
[1:18:50] them again by the prophets Moses and
[1:18:52] Elijah Revelation chapter 11 you know
[1:18:55] the Lord amen
[1:18:57] so the last 300 years or second half of
[1:19:00] Daniels 73 is after the church ages
[1:19:04] there's the rapture of the bride now you
[1:19:07] have this three and a half year period
[1:19:08] right you have this three out of your
[1:19:09] period
[1:19:09] it's the second half of the seventh week
[1:19:12] of Daniel which is also called another
[1:19:14] name for synonym is Jacob's trouble it's
[1:19:17] also called we call it the Great
[1:19:18] Tribulation Period it's also the title
[1:19:20] of the sixth seal right tribulations
[1:19:23] being poured out and brother Branham
[1:19:25] said those prophets blow all the
[1:19:28] trumpets how many remember that the
[1:19:31] prophets blow all the trumpets during
[1:19:34] the sixth seal that causes some
[1:19:38] confusion with some but I'll get to that
[1:19:40] I'm gonna preach on the whole book of
[1:19:41] Revelation already got it are you laid
[1:19:42] out it's already done
[1:19:43] I just got to preach it but a way to get
[1:19:45] done with this before I preach it by
[1:19:47] God's grace all right raise the Lord so
[1:19:51] here you have the ministry of moses and
[1:19:52] elijah that's in revelation 11 in
[1:19:55] revelation 6
[1:19:56] that's the tribulation ministry here at
[1:20:00] the end the rapture of moses and elijah
[1:20:03] that's the sixth and final rapture right
[1:20:05] for six raptures Jesus reveals himself
[1:20:09] to the Jews after that because the red
[1:20:11] the prophets are gone now Jesus reveals
[1:20:13] himself to the Jews and sometime after
[1:20:15] this you have the 144,000 sealed by the
[1:20:17] Holy Spirit it seems like the 144,000
[1:20:21] get martyred and the bad kids destroyed
[1:20:23] our available Armageddon yeah fire to
[1:20:27] burn the earth and then we walk upon the
[1:20:28] ashes of the wicked into the Millennium
[1:20:30] praise the Lord now the one question I
[1:20:33] have is when's the rebuilding of the
[1:20:34] temple that's my question
[1:20:36] I don't know when that's going to happen
[1:20:39] I don't know if we'll see it before the
[1:20:40] rapture or if it all happens or the
[1:20:42] Tribulation Period I'm not sure I don't
[1:20:45] know if anybody is sure about that I'm
[1:20:47] not quite sure brother Branham said that
[1:20:48] say the Lord it's going to happen
[1:20:52] okay so I think I'll stop right there if
[1:20:55] you want my timeline I made that
[1:20:56] timeline back in 2008 I can always email
[1:20:59] that to you let's save our feet by God's
[1:21:01] grace someone told me that smother
[1:21:06] Graham is drawing I never got confirmed
[1:21:07] it I heard him on tape he said Becky you
[1:21:10] drew that the image of Daniel chapter 2
[1:21:12] needed he said Becky looks more like a
[1:21:14] woman than it doesn't man so it seems
[1:21:16] like that might be the picture because
[1:21:17] he did say that on the tape I don't know
[1:21:19] have you ever seen ever Loras okay not
[1:21:23] sure yet
[1:21:24] that's what you know when I went to
[1:21:25] different places on the web that's the
[1:21:26] one that has said well but this is one
[1:21:28] brother Graham throughout but somebody
[1:21:30] else drew it in you know drew it up for
[1:21:33] us hide it out or something like that
[1:21:36] praise God you Lord tonight and man I
[1:21:38] know it's a fast teaching but it's
[1:21:42] important for us to know that it's
[1:21:44] important to know what our we're in it
[1:21:45] you have to know that by God's grace so
[1:21:48] let me I blood that let's just close
[1:21:57] with the word prayer here and let's ask
[1:21:59] God to help us pray this week you know
[1:22:03] as I said we're coming into our 11th
[1:22:05] year as a church he'll be that 11 years
[1:22:09] we've stood 11 years here in Akron
[1:22:12] ministering
[1:22:13] all those who want the Word of God so I
[1:22:15] want to make this a week of prayer and
[1:22:17] rededication to the ministry that God
[1:22:19] has given us the set I've gone through a
[1:22:21] little hard season I'll tell Wendy you
[1:22:23] know I just feel up and have a lot of
[1:22:24] rejection I've been feeling a lot of
[1:22:26] rejection lately I've got to remember
[1:22:29] they haven't rejected me they rejected
[1:22:31] Christ is that the sins that I've seen
[1:22:34] Church I've never told anybody to commit
[1:22:36] fornication I never told anybody to
[1:22:38] commit adultery I've never talked to not
[1:22:41] attend church I've never talked to not
[1:22:43] pay tithes and offerings I've never
[1:22:46] taught uh to women to cut their hair or
[1:22:50] men to wear shorts or to cuss or listen
[1:22:53] to rap music or rock and roll I've never
[1:22:55] taught any of these things that people
[1:22:56] do so I have confidence that I've stayed
[1:23:00] true to the Word of God hey
[1:23:02] and I just want to reconsecrate my life
[1:23:04] rededicate my life I know I've got to
[1:23:06] answer to one day I had this thought on
[1:23:09] Wednesday night we read wherever every
[1:23:12] Minister will give an account of his
[1:23:14] congregation remember that Wednesday
[1:23:15] night I don't remember that
[1:23:17] well the branch said you either do the
[1:23:19] bible's that you either do it with grief
[1:23:20] or joy look at this dog just Kennedy
[1:23:22] this morning
[1:23:23] Moses 5:00 to answer first congregation
[1:23:25] how's it going to answer first
[1:23:27] congregation of grief or joy there's
[1:23:29] probably going to be a lot of grief two
[1:23:31] million people and two made in the
[1:23:34] promised land
[1:23:36] how about Joshua Joshua can say my group
[1:23:40] we all crossed over already
[1:23:44] are you with me Church look at that's
[1:23:46] talking about my amazing so both men had
[1:23:50] to be faithful no matter how big the
[1:23:52] church was in fact the smaller Church
[1:23:55] had the easier way to get in did another
[1:23:58] mixed multitude and everybody was
[1:24:00] circumcised glory everybody was
[1:24:03] consecrated to the ministry they were
[1:24:05] hungry for the ministry and I'm going to
[1:24:08] have to do the same thing for the dottie
[1:24:09] for the Brooks you don't brother Barry
[1:24:12] green they got to stand there with their
[1:24:13] their ministries and either give account
[1:24:16] of their ministry with grief well I
[1:24:18] preach to them they just what they were
[1:24:19] just rebellious like Moses just a
[1:24:22] rebellious people or die I tried I got
[1:24:24] upset one time to get me on the promised
[1:24:25] land they may be so upset Lord forgive
[1:24:28] me but right but remember that God won't
[1:24:31] let somebody the promised land with that
[1:24:33] but Josh will be able to say their
[1:24:35] brother banging his say all my group
[1:24:36] made it in by God's grace he'll give
[1:24:39] account of his congregation with joy
[1:24:41] George I want to give an account with
[1:24:43] joy over our church because I know I'm
[1:24:45] going to have to so let's just pray as
[1:24:48] Biko's here then let's have a week of
[1:24:50] prayer if you can't go home tonight you
[1:24:52] didn't go on your prayer cause if you
[1:24:53] can pray for this week I just feel like
[1:24:55] I already know this is my time
[1:24:57] so get not work this is my time for
[1:24:59] prayer in your Bible it just naturally
[1:25:01] built into my life you know and I love
[1:25:02] it but I really want to do that let's
[1:25:06] pray if we can by God's grace brother
[1:25:09] Graham said if there's ever time the
[1:25:10] church ought to be seeking God and
[1:25:11] prayer like Daniel did it's
[1:25:14] bored in heaven we thank you
[1:25:17] I believe these sermons are very timely
