springing forward we're losing an hour of sleep so try to sleep in an extra hour next Sunday by God's grace and then let's start at 11:00 a. next week because it'll feel just like 10:00 a.m. all right so if you can try to sleep in and then brother Simon will just preach one service you know uh we're just going to try to keep that schedule here for uh March we got brother Diggs coming we'll try to

name and the Saints said amen amen hallelujah God bless you let's take our Bibles here today by the grace of God we just as we said just have one service today I jok with my family I said I'll just preach two and a half hours okay that's all by God's grace Ephesians chapter 3 by God's grace Ephesians chapter 3 Ephesians 3:14 by the grace of the Lord I was mentioning uh I think it was last week I like to preach on the family so you know I'll just preach on that today I was trying to study yesterday I just couldn't get any you know thoughts going and then the thoughts came to me about the family I wanted to preach on the family so I'm going to preach on the family I'm just going to preach on the Christian family this morning by God's grace the Christian family Hallelujah there's uh 75 times the word family is used in the Old Testament it's used one time in the New Testament praise God and this is the one time it's used hallelujah what a comfort Church to know that you know some people say well once I get to heaven then I'll be part of the family of God well according to the Bible you're already a part of the family of God hallelujah thank god let's read this together we'll read uh 14 and 15 by God's grace we can read that together Ephesians 3:14 and 15 let's read that on three 1 2 3 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family and Heaven and Earth is named now I think I'm just going to read after that a little bit here that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length the depth the height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God and of course we could just keep reading that whole entire book there by God's grace but may God add his Blessing to bring of his word you may be seated praise God so we want to start just with that scripture how Paul said we should bow our knees to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ and so here in the scripture he's establishing headship and that's what God has done uh through Christ we know we know God is the invisible Spirit no man has ever seen God no man will ever ever see God hallelujah but God chose to be seen in his son the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so we have the headship there and uh of course God is above all and then the Lord Jesus Christ and the other scriptures tell us uh the husband or the man is above the woman Hallelujah for God's order Hallelujah his responsibility glory and so I love the prayer Paul says what was his prayer for the whole family it was that you and I would be strengthened by the spirit Hallelujah in the Inner Man so I trust that's what the Lord will do today here as we uh Minister I trust that the word of God will strengthen you today Hallelujah I listened to a couple sermons on a family yesterday and I got to listen to most of brother Dennis's Ser brother Dennis MCB preach at cams last night it was a surprise to me it just come up on my YouTube YouTube feed I'm like Glory so I kind of listen to that while I was doing chores and uh had a good really enjoyed brother Dennis's thought he was preaching on Focus I thought that's a good thought uh we got to keep our focus on the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now I want to start of course with lots of scripture so have your Bible handy if you could here we're going to be reading some scripture I just thought it'd be good to go over some of these scriptures about family and uh I want to start in Genesis 1819 we'll start there we'll kind of work our way down through uh uh the Bible here by God's grace and I preached on family you know many years ago it's been many years uh maybe eight years since I preached on the family here at the church according to my records I just preached on it in last time in 2016 so it's been eight years since I've really preached in- depth about the family uh so like I said I like to write a book about the family uh but I found out it really takes God's anointing to write a book Hallelujah I realized wow to write two of them it was just God's anointing right and then to do the third I'm like I really need God's anointing Hallelujah just not done very easily but you know I've always thought this you know if if if we're going to a meeting in the air of a Godly wedding right we're we're going to a spiritual wedding well then uh well then our lives on Earth should match that the nature of that wedding Hallelujah in other words if we want to be in the spiritual wedding let's make make sure our marriages and our our families are in the right condition right now Hallelujah right if we want to be a part of that Heavenly wedding let's have heaven on Earth right now Glory Hallelujah now we know of course Satan's greatest battle is against the family we see that in Genesis chapter 3 we're not going to read that but we're very vers very well versed in it Satan always attacks God's word right that was his main attack his attack was against God well God's word doesn't mean this and he's discrediting God's word all the time and of course today Satan will dis discredit God's children you know God's uh ministers and God's family but is Satan's main attack is on the word of God he's trying to get us to doubt the word of God and if he can do that then he can get our eyes off the word of God and get us focus on sin and that will bring death the Bible says sin when it matures brings death but Jesus said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly hallelujah amen so Jesus gives us the power the strength to keep our eyes on the word of God uh despite Satan's attack his main attack is on the home and the family right because we can all come to church we can smile Shake our hands I can hug our Brothers on the neck and we can shake our hands you our sisters and everything seems fine and good here right we can we can hide maybe some things that might be going on in our lives but when we go home we spend the most of our time there right and we're thankful for a holy church we want to have holy Gatherings we don't want any sin here in the church but we understand we spend the most time at home and so of course that's where s Satan will attack us the most there and so we're going to need fortified we're going to need strengthened we're going to need uh Weaponry right we're going to need defensive armor Hallelujah especially when we're in the home if if any place we need the word of God it's in our home Hallelujah Glory because that's where Satan attacks and so we got to have we got to have our armor on remember the Bible tells us in Ephesians 6 we've got to put the armor on every single day don't let a day go by where you don't put God's armor on Hallelujah right put it on in your home put it on uh in the church you you keep God's armor on at all times and then you'll be able to defend yourself against the attacks of the enemy Hallelujah now I wanted to start in Genesis 18:19 as I said thank you hun um the Bible said I love this God God is saying you know he visited Abraham he said for I know him aren't you glad God knows you I love that God knows you because you were predestinated in his mind before the foundation of the world and then we looked at the potter the Potter he already had this plan he's already going to mold you he's already made you a vessel of Honor Hallelujah he knows you amen he gave you he gave you your your life he gave you your your position he gave you your location he's giving you every detail every hair on your head or brothers if you don't got them he took them away too Hallelujah but he he knows every detail Hallelujah he's placed you where exactly where he wants you Hallelujah and he wants you to be a vessel of Honor by love this God says I know Abraham now look he knew lot wouldn't do all these things right right so there's always a difference that's why I love the message God gave to brother brandham because brother Bram majored on wise and foolish version and now we can see this principle All Through the Bible amen the Bible becomes a new Bible Hallelujah you see in a new light you don't see it by Creeds or well well this this you know you don't see it through a well my founder said this and Luther said this and Wesley said that or or Jonathan Edwards said that or Jonathan Gil said that they can all contribute right but we see it through the mind of Christ as the Bible said we have the mind of Christ amen so we can see this God knows the father of the faith Abraham I know him he'll command his children and his household after him that they shall keep the way of the Lord hallelujah so Abraham wasn't going to give his children the wrong commands he's going to command them to obey the word of God right this is our this is our father of the faith how many you understand that he's our example the father must give commands right and he does that by God's grace and they're commanded to keep God's word I love this to do justice and judgment and it means to make the right decision in a case right so parents are like judges right they've got to judge they've got to investigate before they make a judgment Hallelujah and this is what Abraham God knew he would do God knew he would give commands and then they would give the right judgment here's the right way to do it here's the right thing we should do and we're going forward with this judgment Hallelujah I'm doing Justice this is the in other words this is the right thing to do Hallelujah my children must do this I must do this he gave the commands in other words he was a man of order Hallelujah he had his house in order remember church he had 300 servants and he took those 300 servants and whipped a real army right that that took Sodom and Gomorrah now that's what I call a real man Hallelujah he didn't have all the he didn't have all the we say the military gear of that day or whatever uh he didn't have all the backing of all these nations alls he had was the backing of God Amen but that's all he needed hallelujah amen and this is the kind of man he was he gave his children commands to keep the word just keep the word and we will do justice and judgment in our home and then when God calls us to fight battles we'll fight the battles Hallelujah you know and when they get to be teenagers then they start fighting some real battles right because they get influenced by friends right like we're seeing at all these youth events now there are great youth events but we can see the battles raging Hallelujah right and there's times for battle Hallelujah and they got to be prepared for battle by the grace of God so this is this household his household was commanded to keep God's word and I thought about this too you know uh Joshua said as for me in my house we will serve the Lord now we get this idea your house is a business because it serves God didn't Jesus say I must be about my father's business right your house is producing something right your home is producing something so I want to take that spiritual application and and let's apply that let let's remember your house is a factory your house is we'll say maybe a a herd you know it's producing something Hallelujah this is what God wants you got to you got to declare my house is going to serve God hallelujah we're not going to serve money or Mammon we're not going to serve pleasure right we're not going to serve idolatry right we are going to serve the Lord Jesus Christ that's what me and my house that's what we're that's what we're called to do we're commanded to do that Hallelujah and the father has to see that the leader the husband he has to see that our household is to serve God that's our whole purpose that's why I tell people when in counseling like we've done with Austin Lena everyone amen who everyone we've had the pleasure to marry it and as I preach other places I preach six or seven marriage Banquets I've always the told the people that put God first in your home don't miss church for nothing Hallelujah because you've got to honor God first God tells you give the first fruits come before him with praise and thanksgiving seek me first and everything else will be added unto you Hallelujah don't let Sports interrupt with the worship of God don't let Pleasures don't let anything interrupt seek God verse hallelujah it's a Bible command and a real man will do that Hallelujah We Believe Gathering more as we see that day approaching we also believe there's times of rest Hallelujah we didn't take a rest in January or February so it just start to it starts to hit me about this time of the year where I go to I go to work on Monday and I I'm just trying to stay awake I'm trying not to during my break I try not to fall asleep sometimes because I need a rest sometimes Hallelujah but this was a man this is what a man's called to do lead his house command his house he should give the orders praise God right now the mother gives the order to the children right but the ultimate order should come from the husband he's the leader Hallelujah he's the father of the faith and I like this if a man will do that then God will bring all his good promises to pass amen hallelujah if the man honors God God will bless the man hallelujah amen and the rest of the family amen this is a Christian family Hallelujah this is how Christian should uh walk and we'll get to it later but this man doesn't rule just by the Iron Fist it's a it's a leadership of love love is the strength of his leadership Hallelujah love and we'll get to it in a little bit you know that uh the Bible just lays it over and over you know and then brother baham tells us you know as the Bible shows to we have some people that are very dogmatic you know they're very iron fisted he said but then you got really kind and gentle people you got God has a variety of leadership right but despite the style of leadership what matters is keeping the commands yes amen you can keep the commands as a a very strict person but you can also keep the commands as a very kind person how do I know because I've seen both right I have preacher friends that are really strict and they're ra super strict and I have other people I try to be the kind leader like you I don't think my children have ever he heard me yell have I ever yelled at home one time and said you get yourself right this is my house and they've never Lydia but the oldest now she said no I'm a more of a Kind leader I like to be like kind but there's nothing wrong with raising your voice god Ra Jesus raised his voice there but see God's God of righty the main thing is love God with all your heart soul mind and strength Hallelujah and love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang every law Hallelujah right love fulfills the whole law of God hallelujah I preach like I'm a strict leader at home but I'm really not I'm really by God's grace I tried to be also let's go to Deuteronomy 6 we get these commands Deuteronomy 6 verse6 if you got your Bible there you'd like to read along or case is really fast you can put it up there Deuteronomy 66 just want to go over some of these major verses here that lay down our commands as a Christian family and we'll kind of deal with the fathers here Lord willing we'll look at the mothers and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart right so we we have brother R's message here but we just don't want it here we want it here church I see it all the time I see it all the time I'm not perfect but brother Ram says when you get the Holy Ghost it's like a buzzer that goes off right when you see sin the buzzer goes off that means the message is in your heart amen it protects your life Hallelujah like I can I can listen to a preacher for a few minutes I can get the buzzer right away if he's a if he's a false preacher I've seen it many many times right you you you do too or you meet somebody new just let them talk brother say you could let them talk for a few minutes pretty soon you'll know their spirit and then he says let me go in that brother's home let me look at what's on his walls I say like this let me scroll on his phone for about five minutes I'll tell you what's in his heart Hallelujah let me check his deleted pictures let me check his deleted emails and delet well I can't do deleted but let let me check that right I'll tell you what's in their heart Deuteronomy 6:7 and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children now see that's what that's why we try to do that we try to do Bible studies and teach the children but we also have to do it in the home D it's got to be diligent right and now now we know most of us that were raised in denomination for some of us it was just once a Sunday for an hour right if your church that that if your church service was one hour that's all you had that was all the teaching but a real Christian family brings it home yes and every day there's talk about the Bible every day there's an Open Bible Glory every day there's a song of Praise In The House hallelujah it's diligent it's every day teaching the word of God and the home just backs up what's being preached at church remember the Bible said the wives are supposed to ask their husbands at home right then the children if Dad's not there the children ask the mom right if Mom don't know Mom will ask Dad if Dad don't know he can ask the pastor amen but then in our questions and answers you can ask me too amen right but but the Bible said this home is supposed to be established with diligence it's just supposed to be the word the word the word the word hallelujah amen that's how you get the right results and shalt talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down when thou Rises up so you try by God's grace to keep all the focus on the word of God and of course you can talk about uh family issues or issues out in the uh in in the society but you want to bring it all back to what God's word would say what's God's word say about the political environment what's God's word say about the social norms that are changing what does God's word say about it right and if it's a negative thing let's say well let's pray for them Hallelujah let's add let's let's say true to God's word then hallelujah amen it's all it's you got to talk about the things we see it we live here we're of the world I'm sorry we're in the world but we're not of the world Amen let's bring all those conversations back to the word of God verse eight and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on the gates so in other words surround yourself with the word of God think about it all the time now Deuteronomy 11:18 is kind of a repeat of this Deuteronomy 11:18 therefore shall you lay up these words in your heart and in your soul see that I like that heart would be the mind right and then your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontless between your eyes and you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt write them upon the doorpost of thine house and upon thy Gates that your days may be multiplied the days of your children the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of Heaven upon the Earth amen now these blessings go all the way to verse 25 so I'm not going to read all that but this is echoed by Paul in Ephesians 6 children honor your parents in the Lord for this is right obey your parents in the Lord right honor them and the Bible said you're given a long life so we see a lot of these promises do carry over in some ways to the New Testament Hallelujah and what great promises they are and so it's our duty as parents to teach them to the children or if you don't have children teach them to your nieces and your nephews amen or any children you work with or whatever may be if you if some child is looking up to you you must model to them a real Christian character Hallelujah the real Spirit of Christ Hallelujah like I told you I've had numerous teachers come in over the years and I had just the teacher tell me this week she said I've never been in a class full of so much love Mr Smith and I said that's God's love amen hallelujah I hope it's I hope it's always that way praise God where there's love and there's compassion and there's mercy and there's judgment Hallelujah like the Bible says but it's our duty to teach them to the children and then surround ourselves talk about it as much as we can throughout the day you know I love Saturdays my on Saturdays my wife listens to brother brandom all morning and she'll almost it's almost always she sent me five or six texts here's some quotes from brother brandom and just thoughts I just love it it's something we can talk about then throughout the rest of the week something we can talk about when I get home you know I'm studying usually at the church and I'll just get texts from her and I love hearing all those uh insights that my wife gives me that that that gift of knowledge I believe amen and it just allows us to keep talking about the things of God and then I'll share what I've been studying and I'm kind of what I'm preparing to preach and things on our hearts and that's one way we talk about it and as we start that new tradition uh two months ago every Sunday night before we pray we have all the children share their favorite thing about church service that day it's been wonderful I'm like wow I love to hear what they remember now zans might be like oh hugging Jose or hugging amen or something like that I say well that I guess that counts you know you're with God's people I don't expect him to memorize the sermon yet but but I really like that because I like to see what what the children are taking away from it right because sometimes I'm just like instruct instruct and tell tell tell I like to hear well what up what are you thinking about I like that and guess what I got that from a presbyterian preacher who got it from Jonathan Edwards who was a real man of God he preached sinners in the hands of an Angry God I mean some amazing sermons that was his uh that was his uh tradition on Sunday nights thought what a good tradition by God's grace so we might start that on well can't do Wednesday night maybe we could do it Thursday night yeah Thursday night can you remember one good thing from Wednesday night's uh Gathering Hallelujah but the point is focus everything around the word of God as much as possible praise God now Ezra 8 I'm sorry Ezra 8:21 honey can you pull that up there and I'm going to go to Nehemiah 4:14 Ezra 8:21 you know if you remember this you know the uh the Jews were on their way way going back to the promised land after the 70 years of Exile and I just love this I proclaimed a fast there at the river ahava that we might afflict ourselves before God to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all of our substance and I just want to pull the spiritual lesson out of here they were naturally trying to find their way back I they were saying these daddies are saying I don't know how we're going to make the way there I don't know how that we're going to make this journey so I better fast and I better seek God so we can make the way Hallelujah and that's what natural dads and moms should do today if they don't know the direction if they don't know what God's calling them if they don't know the next step the best thing to do is fast and pray seek God's face skip some meals so you can have a spiritual meal in the presence of God hallelujah amen how many times have I done that you know I don't know the direction I don't know God's will that's what we've done we seek we fast we seek God we make the flesh uncomfortable so the soul can be comforted hallelujah amen like brother man said a a fast in the spiritual is a feast in the Lord hallelujah when you're fasting naturally that's when your soul can really Feast on the word of God Amen so see we how many want to go the right way praise God Jesus is the way the word is the way the word is the right way Hallelujah so see you got to go to some lengths if uh you got to go to some lengths of sacrifice if you want to find God's way Hallelujah but I find most people do that like I told you you know some people that left the message they've never fasted well no wonder their family's chosen the wrong way that's just striking me right now I never thought about that till now no wonder the family's going the wrong way with women uh crossdressing women cutting hair men no backbone to stand don't even know the W the right water baptism or now going to a a pride Church a pride church that celebrates Pride I'm talking about sinful Pride homosexuality agenda it just proves you know that they never really sought the right way right they didn't take time to really make it real to them amen church God wants to meet with each one of us hallelujah God said draw nigh to me I will draw nigh to you what a promise amen the god of the universe will draw nigh to us and show us here's the right way that you go I'm going to share this now before I forget it but years ago when we first started the church you know we had uh many a couple families well one family in particular stopped coming to church on Sunday nights and Wednesday nights and I thought my heart's breaking we're a small church already so I laid at this altar right there now it might have been known in that room but I laid this Altar and I said I was weeping and crying I said God I believe we should gather more as we see that day approaching I believe it's wrong to take my family out of church and I said God I I said please hear my prayer let my children be filled with the Holy Ghost before that family before those children as evidence that I chose the right way Hallelujah amen and by God's grace I can say it today Hallelujah that I've got children with the Holy Ghost amen because we chose the right way Hallelujah the way of God because my house is a service house for the Lord my house is a house where that's our main focus we're going to serve Jesus Hallelujah I still was telling my wife the other day I still remember lyd and Malachi had their bunk beds and I'd go up and once they'd fall asleep or I'd C maybea and ly were on the bottom and Malachi was on the top I wait till they're all asleep and I'd say Lord fill Malachi with the Holy Ghost In The Name of Jesus while he's young so when the when the days come he's strong in the faith and I Lay My Hands on acia L I said Lord fill them with the Holy Ghost before the evil days can come Hallelujah and God is gracious Hallelujah God is good amen but I still got to do my part I still got to talk about Jesus in the morning in the evening in you're coming in you're going Hallelujah talk about him amen Malai and I we always pray before we go into Taekwondo class don't we I say God protect our minds and our bodies and if time goes on we're going to have our own class one day we're going to tell them about Jesus we're GNA be preaching from June B the ready position where are we preaching Hallelujah tell them about Jesus because you can't separated praise God you're a city on a hill that cannot be hidden you are the salt of the earth Hallelujah that's why this message attracted me it was salty right it has flavor to it it's got Revelation to it it's not a dead Creed it's a living word hallelujah I was raised in dead Creeds I was raised in denominations but when I saw this message it was eternal life Hallelujah the living word amen as the angel said go tell them the words of this life Hallelujah that's what I wanted I wanted to live like brother Brooks I want to live like brother Craig I want to live like Dave lell and by the grace of God I live with the same life they live The Life of Christ hallelujah amen Nehemiah 4:14 here's what we need though we need men and I looked and Rose up and I said to the Nobles and the rulers and the rest of the people be ye not afraid of them don't be afraid of leoa remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses this is when they're building the house I'm sorry building the wall they re rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem and he said don't be afraid of the enemies fight for your family we know fighting in prayer right but it's also fighting in the home as far as fighting spirits to show them the right the right word of God to teach them to obey the word of God it's worth the fight Hallelujah I can look back and see my mom uh was fighting against uh four four teenage boys to get them up to go to church it was worth the fight now she got three preachers out of them it's worth a fight amen might not feel good in the midst of the fight but keep fighting the good fight of Faith hallelujah amen think of that three preachers beating them with uh beating them with bats and spraying them with vinegar to get them the house of God now they're in the house of God the most amen they travel overseas they travel Wherever Would wherever the Holy Spirit would lead them it's worth the fight hallelujah amen she did that basically alone my by God's grace so remembers Brothers It's a fight and mothers too if the husband's not there to fight then you fight hallelujah amen everybody fights now I want to show you again this blessing so Psalm chap 1 verse one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counts of the ungodly nor standeth the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful so a blessed man a blessed man is a father a husband he'll be blessed because he walks in the ways of God so not only does he teach his children to do it but he models it for them you want to see how to be a Godly Man son look at my life Hallelujah I've always played with this idea I love to wake Malachi up I haven't done this yet but I love to wake him up at five o'clock when I wake up and say come study the Bible with me you know maybe one day we'll do that buddy my God's great but he's growing a lot he needs a lot of sleep but he he knows my life the girls they know my life remember that great teaching uh the some scientist studies families and they said how what's the best way to teach your children they said Step One is model step two is model and guess what step three is model if you want your children to learn anything model it before them this is how we pray this is how we serve God this is how we study the Bible like I love Zion uh he comes in all the time he's like he sees me highlighting he says Daddy can I have a Bible where's my highlighter so had to buy him some highlighters and now he highlights his Bible while I'm highlighting mine is that just that's the most purest purest example I see Daddy highlight in his Bible I want to spend and he'll just quietly sit there and is he in here no he'll just quietly highlight the whole time I'm highlighting my Bible I said a 20-minute timer to highlight go over the scriptures you know or if I'm in my prayer closet he'll come in and knock and he'll come and sit on his prayer closet with me on my little mat there I'm sure Mali used to do that too we all used to do that together but that's the best way if you want uh your children to follow God invite them into your worship model before them and invite them in hallelujah amen like brother Tim mimmy that wonderful brother now of course we haven't had much Fellowship but he's he's now a pastor but I asked him you know when I first became a pastor my children were little he had four daughters and I said they they just love the Lord I said brother how'd you do it how'd you produce such children like that he said we did everything together by the word of God so you know they did horses you know they uh they went to special meetings together everything they did they did together and that's why you know I don't send my children off to camp meetings where none of us go go now one day meetings are okay but you won't see me send my children off well bye and go enjoy a week without me being there no I want to be there by God's grace they're mine until they move out right they're they're God's Heritage it's God's Heritage to me Hallelujah I'm responsible I'm the one who's got to answer right just like Eli failed his sons Eli failed his sons by not correcting them not being there enough right he didn't restrain he didn't restrain them he should have said said stop stealing that fat from the offering and stop laying stop laying with these women they're not your wives he should have been there but he wasn't there and so he lost the priesthood forever because he wouldn't restrain his children but the Bible said the man of God in the house of God must rule over his wife and children Hallelujah that sure helps when they got the Holy Ghost because then they can kind of rule themselves the Holy Ghost will rule them right but until they get the Holy Ghost it's our responsibility to help rule over for them with love right like I told my children I never asked them to do anything that I haven't done Malai sweeps the floor I've done that right uh Mali mowed the grass well I mowed it first what uh Mali wash dishes I wash dishes first I I'll humble myself I can do that by God's grace everything I ask him to do I do it first I'm not going to ask them like the Pharisees they ask you to do things but they don't do it themselves they won't lift one finger to help anybody out that's a real sign of a Pharisee a lazy person trying to boss people around Hallelujah that's true verse two but his Delight is in the law of the Lord what does the man of God love so much I love the word amen and his law do he meditate day and night see it's Satan who wants to think oh the word is boring or there's nothing new in the Bible That's Satan's lies God promises if you're a man if you're a blessed man and you meditate on the word the word will make you happy Hallelujah the word you can meditate on it day and night and God will show you revelation after Revelation from Faith to Faith from glory to glory God's word is an inexhaustible Fountain of Life Hallelujah I've seen it like we just saw it with brother Simon getting that great revelation of rebaptism in the Old Testament wasn't that beautiful my goodness I'm still blessed by that always wondered where is rebaptism uh typed in the Old Testament in the life of Joseph two burials one burial in the world and one burial in the promise amen God let me be buried in Jesus Christ's promise Amen Let Me Be planted there because I'll rise in the resurrection of it amen amen verse three and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf shall also not wither and whosoever I'm sorry whatsoever he doeth shall prosper Hallelujah now not every absolutely everything I've done has prospered every single thing but the majority of things that I do should Prosper if I'm following God right because God won't Lead Me In something that's not going to be a blessing to the body of Christ right just this week like I tell you every week I get emails people blessed I tell you one of the best ones if he's listening now one of the best ones was my brother Paul he sent me a picture last Sunday and he's highlighted up my 2021 book just chapter one and I started crying I like CU you I forget about all these things he's like I don't know how God had you do that I just said well I just say well thank God I'm glad that uh my influence is going out the influence God gave me hallelujah it's God's word so we want our works to be fruitful we want to see uh fruits to our lives and our Ministries Hallelujah but how do you get that it's being blessed it's Matthew 6:33 seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and everything else will be added unto you praise God think about that if you just just seek God and seek Holiness and seek obedience you get every other blessing you get health you get finances you get uh uh uh favor you get all these things if you just SE God first why wouldn't people do it I would think they'd be excited to do it but it's because they love sin thank God there's a people that love Holiness hallelujah amen my what a promise if I just do this one thing I get everything else if I can just go this one way every other question is settled hallelujah amen thank God Amen a promise let's say all things can we all things if I can just get this one area of my life amen in order I ain't got to worry about everything else and that has been nothing but the truth in my life if I can just keep God first everything else is added unto me Hallelujah this is a blessed man now who meditates day and night in the law of God Isaiah 2028 verse one yeah I'm I need to turn there y I don't have this one on my screen there Psalm 128 so again now we're going to look at another thing the psalm says about a blessed man I love this old Bible brother Rod gave me I love it this Thompson Chain Bible who's got a Thompson Chain Bible anybody got a Thompson Chain boy these are awesome bbes it's like the whole thing in the back is one big Bible study after you get done with the Bible and there's all these top it's like a topical reference you know about family you know about you know honor dishonor covenants selfishness I mean it's just it's just a treasure Trove right that's that's that's my word right a treasure Trove of Bible Revelation in there Isaiah I'm sorry Psalm 128 it's only six verses and notice blessed is everyone that fearth the Lord that walth in his ways in other words we're going to look at the fear of the Lord just for a moment so anyone that fears God and then seeks him will be blessed so this is what the man has to do or the wife if his husband ain't if her husband isn't doing it I shouldn't say ain't is not doing it they have to seek God they have to fear God that walketh in his ways see each day they walk in obedience to the word of God verse two for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee so when we fear God or respect God honor God by obeying his commands the Bible says you'll be happy how many happy people here today how many eating because God's G you a good job to labor in thank God Hallelujah how many have it well your your life is well Hallelujah all's well right all's well verse three thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house thy children like Olive plants round about thy table so he gives this illustration now of the blessed man his wife is like a Vine right up on the house notice it's not far away it's right attached to the house it's not it's not in the bar right it's not down there in the city it's right connected to her Ministries in the home Hallelujah that's right amen and the children are around about like Olive plants and I read something about olive trees from one of the preachers the preacher said the Olive Tree will put forth all these owls but at the end of his life uh all these other trees start springing up underneath that Olive Tree so when this one goes down the little ones are planted right next to it ready to come up and start producing more fruit and that's what the illustration here gives the father's there and he's that Olive Tree he's going to be fruitful for a season but then it's going to come the next season and and then his own life glory amen his own labors right his own fruit of his own life will come up and then they'll produce for the Next Generation Hallelujah the next season hallelujah amen verse four behold that thus shall the man be blessed that fearth the Lord remember that's honor I honor God everywhere at work at home at school in my family on the job I honor God I respect God everywhere in my life Hallelujah the fear of the Lord the Lord shall bless thee out of Zion and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life Hallelujah so God again will bless your entire life Hallelujah yay Thou shalt see thy children's children grandchildren and peace upon Israel peace in the land Hallelujah hey church we live in a very peaceful state by God's grace right there's a lot of like I saw an article what was it uh is it Austin Texas which which uh City in uh Texas they they they they voted to have have no police officers and it's falling apart people are saying it's Lawless here it's I think it starts with a a I just saw it this morning it was Austin Texas so so I mean think about that people live in an area like that where there's violence and death and destruction no protection they've they've really got to trust in God right but most most but but look at our lives God has blessed us here hallelujah God's been merciful great is his faithfulness Hallelujah so we see this picture of a man he's sitting around his table now we need more of these at our house then that's that's my job because we got busy nights but a man with his wife and the children all at the table and God said happy is that man when he's right there Allelujah because this is our foreshadowing of Jesus Jesus said I'll sit down with you at the marriage supper of the lamb and we drink a new of the vine Hallelujah we'll have communion Jesus the husband will be with the bride he that hath the bride is the bridegroom Hallelujah and he sits down with his family at the communion table hallelujah it's a prefigure of that oh I love it isn't that beautiful my look at Psalm 144 so just turn like one or two pages one two it's just three pages in my Bible Psalm 144:12 that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as cornerstones polished after the similitude similitude of a palace so look at this God makes men like he types men as plants how many like when you when what what what you plant produces good fruit I like a good year where we get a lot of good blueberries and blackberries right don't you we we that's what the Bible says your sons are like that my they're just so fruitful and your daughters are cornerstones not just of a house but a palace that's royalty Hallelujah your your daughters are the royalty of Heaven Hallelujah walking on Earth amen polished I mean just holy beautiful like I was telling all my daughters this morning you look holy you look beautiful I try to tell all of them if I missed anybody forgive me I know I told Caris and Haven and Victoria I think I forgot lyd lydy you look beautiful today you're all polished up in the word of God hallelujah so this is the imagery that God gives us remember the Cornerstone I preached this on Mother's Day a few years ago the Cornerstone was I'm going to build everything on this Stone right here and this house is either going to stand or fall based upon this Cornerstone my house is going to either stand or fall based upon the wife I chose and thank God I got a great wife hallelujah amen I know you Brothers feel the same Hallelujah because you keep the commands of God Amen well R said a man will choose he said watch what a man chooses to marry that will show what what's in his mind the kind of future he's planning he said if he chooses some Hollywood strip teas the shows are going to be divorced within a few little bit he said but if he chooses a Godly woman who's holy he uh then he's choosing a a household that serves God hallelujah he's choosing a wonderful future a blessed future with the fear of the Lord hallelujah remember the Bible said when a man is found a Godly wife he's found a good thing she is a reward from the Lord hallelujah I want to look at uh this one again this is one of my favorite verses if I ever get to writing that book if the Lord carries this is one I'm going to use a lot this is going to be a major one Genesis 335 Genesis 335 I love what Jacob says here I'd sure like to preach maybe a series on Jacob I see so many beautiful things in his life Genesis 30 you're faster than me honey thank you and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children this is Esau and said who are th are these I'm sorry who are those with thee and he said the children which God hath graciously given thy servant Esau sees all of his children he says who are they these are my gifts of Grace hallelujah it's God's grace the world sees children as burdens but Jacob saw him these are my gifts of Grace God has given to me in other words God and the Bible said the children are a reward right so God L down from heaven I want to bless them I'm going to give them a Lydia I'm going to give them a Malachi and I'll list the rest of them later you know put your name in there my children here your rewards your your your God's gracious gifts Hallelujah ain't that beautiful man I love that Hallelujah now let's get to to this man Ephesians 5:25 said husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church now I want to put these quotes up here from Brother brand just they're nice to review sometimes these are some quotes I've used at the marriage uh Banquets here so casea if you can just switch over here I read this book and it was a great book and uh it said Brothers your wife needs at least five things and I have I have scriptures for all these I I preach it many times like I said the seven marriage Banquets I preach it here before but I'm not going to go through all of them but I just want to hit just a few things and show you how brother brandham backed all this up because brother Bram was a bible-based prophet Hallelujah so a woman a wife needs affection so a man's got to learn how to show affection so hugging handholding uh all the affection that she would need to know that she's loved and she's cared for right got to have affection number two openness and honesty sisters want a man that's going to tell them what they're really thinking hallelujah amen don't want to hide things now as a man you just keep your own sins right you can keep your sins between you and God right you don't have to tell your wife all your sins I don't right because that's between God and me I want to live so close to God that my wife just sees my good parts now she always sometimes sees my bad parts but she wants someone she needs a man who's open and honest third she needs conversation she needs that man to talk to her listen to her he don't have to solve all of her problems right sometimes just needs to listen right because some problems a man can't solve right I can be your husband but I can't be God I'm talking about that for all husbands you know not just my wife I can't give you your Soul's desire Only God Can fulfill your Soul's desire right I can be the one your soul loves right I can be that person but I can't fulfill your entire life I'm not called to that I'm called to love you amen but I can't meet every single need in your life right but I want to love my wife with all my strength Hallelujah because that in that way I love God's daughter I show my love to God by loving God's children she needs family commitment someone who's committed to the family not here today gone tomorrow back again like these deadbeat dads right that run around and you don't know when they're coming back or if they're coming back and then she needs financial support of course if she's staying at home and everything like that but those those are those are things we've gone over see the brothers who are married probably they've already been able to do all these five things which is why their wives marry them in the first place so Brothers if we're not doing those we got to be willing to relearn how to love our wives better right she wouldn't have married you if you were some deadbeat guy right Hallelujah but I've said this too if the man can get in position by the Holy Ghost then the rest of the family will fall in position if he can really love it if he can really seek God Amen if he seeks God first and then loves his wife most things are going to fall into order pretty simply because God said I'm going to add everything else that you need right if the wife feels love then she's going to love the children right but uh I just want to if you haven't heard these for a while I think I put this on YouTube a few weeks ago brother Braham said I was talking about men losing their affections for their wife and don't love them as they did when they were sweethearts shame on you so brother always right blast the immoral women well here he's going to blast some immoral men right some people might say it's about time right but depends which sermons you listen to he was Elijah Elijah had to ball out Jezebel he sure bought out Ahab too brother brother would bounce that but the major temptation of our day is the the the daughters of men right as it was the days of Noah so shall be in the days of the son of man the sons of God saw who the daughters of men so Satan has really tried to trap sons of God God today by presenting uh sexy dressed women so brother R had to blast that with the spirit of Elijah some people can't handle it well that's because they can't handle the truth they stumble at The Stumbling Stone right the it's a rock of offense Jesus his word offends them the Bible offends them that's why they stumble brother B said you ought to do it Brothers she's always your sweetheart Hallelujah like in other quotes yeah brother M said he said oh that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease because it ain't going to cease in heaven it's going to be just perfectly one there that's right it's all like some women ought to Said Amen to that didn't don't you I like that he's like he he's laughing when he says it I thought more sisters should have said Amen on that he said you're always balling out women like that sister Hickerson why don't you say something he said' thank you sister Cox that's very good brother Cox that's for you ever where you are now so I can call out all the brothers that's for you Brothers right we need to love our wives like it's a honeymoon Hallelujah we should never forget to honor each other always be sweethearts never let it cease see there's quotes on both sides right brother man wasn't always preaching against immoral women that's the main problem so that's why the majority of quotes are on that right but brother B also said I love all my sisters in Christ he says you're he says you're a helpmate to your husband you're you're doing the right thing and he saids stay in your position but he was preaching against that Jezebel spirit today right it's on the men preachers it's on the churches it's on women right it's it's all over the majority of people miss the narrow road they go the broad road which leads to destruction a Catholic boy came to me not long ago he and his wife wife was separated he said Billy I hate to come to you I'm a Catholic and you a Protestant now notice did he turn him down because he's Catholic I can't help you because you're Catholic is that what he said no brother Bram had time to help Catholics with their marriages so should you Hallelujah is Nancy a Catholic brother okay I thought so that's why I was kind of on my mind said a priest run me out of my home a while ago I said what's the matter with him he said well he told me I drink a little and of a night I work hard so there's this excuse I work hard I need this devil I mean alcohol right I need this relief so making excuses well well Lord you know I've just got to do this because I'm tired no you don't have to do that Bible said if you wait on God he restores your strength like the eagle Hallelujah so he couldn't wait so he's like I got to have a bottle give me some alcohol Let Me Drown out the Sorrows of my day and the priest run him out now I'm never going to run you out of your house you by God's grace don't don't run me out of mine he says my wife thinks I ought to come in every night and kiss her and hug her and make it out like we was just fixing to get married said we married got a bunch of kids I said whoop wait a minute boy you're wrong that's just the same as it was before you're married in other words you need to act the same as when you got married you must always remember she's 40 years old now at the time when she really needs your attention so brother as you get older you got to give your wife more attention my wife is not and saying amen 41 Hallelujah is that isn't that awesome God go brother Taps into God's you know God's thoughts on these things so as you get older brothers when you're married you got to give your wife more attention right and you ought to she's part of you like you're helping yourself you're helping your family right you're this is my people right there's that phrase my people these are my people this who God gave me these are my gracious gifts I'm gonna take care of my gifts that God gave me amen if God gave them to me there's a reason he gave them to me Hallelujah I want to take care of them now here's some examples of uh wait now what I got after that oh yeah let's read these quotes I'm g go back to that he said Fellowship comes by love and love requires fellowship if you want to have Love in Your Homes you got to spend time together if you love your wife You' just got to get with her and talk with her if you love your friend you've got to get with him and talk with him and if you love God there's got to be a basis for Fellowship you cannot have fellowship and livelihood without these agreements you cannot be married without an agreement you cannot have a wife without some kind of agreement and that agreement is based upon your vow your promises and that that's that's the danger of all these teenagers is trying to date in the message in the message I didn't ask them but I was going to ask ly Malachi how many of that just if you give me a ballpark percentage how many of that group of teens want to date what what would your percentage be okay so 99 well not you 999 so think about that these are people that are supposed to be raised in godliness and Holiness in other words I won't love you that that that that girl to say first shame on you go talk to my dad right that's what she should have said first then she says I'm not going to try to even accept your love until you promise me you will love me when I turn 40 and 50 and 60 all the way up but see today people they want pleasure before the promise promise comes first promise me first then we'll have pleasure right then we'll have all the enjoyments of marriage but see they want want pleasure before they'll make a promise shame on them now and this is what I kind of told my children and yet these same preachers that go to those things will say we've got the greatest youth group of all time that won't wait on God that want a day I'm sorry that don't qualify that doesn't speak of greatness greatness is obeying the word of God yes I'm going to show you the shunamite was a great woman the Bible said she was a great woman you know why because she made a house for Elisha she saw this man of God Minister and walk she's like hubby let's build this guy a house and the Bible said she was a great woman because she wanted a place for the prophet to rest Hallelujah just as simple I just want him to have a little easier life goodness and the Bible calls her a great woman how can we make the prophet's life a little easier let's do it hubby so they do Hallelujah and God said it's a great woman reminds me of Jesus I I I've hardly seen such great faith I haven't seen great faith in all of Israel amen somebody that just believes the word and will speak the word of God and doesn't need God to move everything or do every go anywhere just speak the word God and I'll believe it Hallelujah just give me the word of God just give me the spoken word of God and I'll believe it Hallelujah if you said you loved your wife and you never tell her about it and never sit down and make love to her express it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country I always tell my wife that that's how she knows I love her not really she likes the fellowship part all the things that you know and how pretty she is how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it that's the way we do God see I loved it when I'm when I'm leading songs or amen's leading songs I'm sure we just love to hear the people sing from their hearts I like when the people sing louder than me I like that do you brother Hallelujah I like when we all can just en adore Jesus and give him praise and just take a few minutes and tell him how much we love him hallelujah amen worship him see love drives you to that right you got to when you really love somebody it'll drive you to go out of your way to express a little bit of love for them that's why you know years ago my wife and I might remember people say oh don't have birthday parties it's sinful don't have birthday parties uh Herod had birthday parties I don't know if you remember this I was like you know and I was like well what's wrong with one taking one day out of the year to say hey I love you I really love you brother thank you I love if you weren't here I'd be sad right and let alone God's gracious gifts to you what's wrong with that and now it looks so scriptural don't it well the only person in the Bible that had a birthday party was a sin that's true that's true but the Bible says to the pure all things are pure right and the Bible said the logos dance before the Lord he was just rejoicing always before the Lord right so father and son happy times amen hallelujah didn't Jacob give Joseph A a rainbow coat of many colors I love you son now would have been better if he didn't favor him we can kind of see why he favored him you know some of his other Sons were some Rascals sleeping around and doing some murders and all kinds of things no wonder he favored him but with the real Christian family that Daddy ought to do that to all of his children right like I told my kids they're all going to get a a cell phone when they can drive you know that's gonna be my gift to them you know when they get a certain age you know that's when you get this and that try to treat them all the Same by the ground God's grace see love will drive us to express our love to our family okay um how am I doing okay almost at an hour all right now brother BR says when when your wife gets in menopause he says he said perhaps it's your nerve sisters when they get into menopause he said it's a woman here might be in menopause time that's when everything is wrong with her and there's nothing wrong with her yet everything is wrong with her and she's not just putting on she really feels that it's just as real any person that's nervous is that way and don't never disagree and you husbands to your wives when they're in that time of life if she ever was your sweetheart you let her be right then because she needs you so see Church there's going to be times in our life we got to be ready to love at all times I'm talking to the men right I'm start with the men because you're the leader you're the fighter Hallelujah but Satan's going to attack you the most to not be a leader to not be a fighter he's going to attack you to be too passive right and not command like you ought to and not do justice and judgment like you ought to and give it to somebody else right wife or whatever Church whatever you know she needs you she really needs your help she needs somebody to help her and understand her talk to her take her up in your arms like she was your sweetheart and she should be and understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing hormones right and you must be good to her at that time how many people have said you're just weak you need a you need a Revival you need they might criticize a woman going through that it's a change of life and men go through it too we're gonna have brother Brooks here in a few months I can ask him my brother can you preach on the change of life for men many men have done evil things in their change of life they've left their wives they've left their families because their hormones are changing right so this is a real thing and so what's brother r what's brother R's Revelation the Bible love choose to love Hallelujah husbands love your wives amen as Christ love the church I love it we got a real bible-based Prophet hallelujah amen thank you Jesus love her at that time as Ephesians 5:25 says now notice this now as he comes over they come to the now this is a different quote but I'm talking about how every house has three rooms right kitchen uh he calls it the Parlor like the living room and then the bedroom he said see eat he said go in the kitchen eat that's that's your that's your first next go into your room to talk things over recognition making all your confession but then when you go into the bedroom it's when the married life is completed it's ready then life is for the little ones and so forth so he just gives a simple parallel there's eating fellowship and there's love right or life or uh intimacy and so so but you you got to go through all three brother say in other words you can't skip any of those you got to go through all three you got to be together as a family right eat you got to have the talk and the fellowship and you got to have the intimacy if you want a blessed home by God's grace Hallelujah all right now I'm going to pull off there uh the attachment everybody feeling good all right I'm at an hour right now my timer just went off okay all right okay I'm feeling pretty good by God's grace hopefully you are too you've been a good audience here by God's grace I want to preach this I don't know if I've ever preached this before here so I want to preach this uh you know some people are called to have children some people may not be called to have children so I've found this kind of in the scripture know in the beginning of the scripture God deals with Abraham uh and Sarah and talks about how they're going to have so many children and he said your children will be as the sand of the sea right and so there was such a burden on them like I think it was one of them uh Rachel said give me children or I'll die because they knew the promise of God right and God eventually gave her children but not everybody is called to have children you know I have family members and things and I'm sure some of you do too that they're married but they don't have children and so you wonder about that but as you see God is just a god of variety it's the general orders to have children right and it's a blessing of God but God has to have testimonies from every Walk of Life right God's got to have somebody overcome cancer or die with cancer and still have a Christian testimony somebody's God's got to have a family with lots of kids 20 right they used to some families used to have 20 children now that would be pretty hard for me I'll just say like that that'd be hard to have 20 kids in the 2024 with my life but I was called to have eight you know by God's grace but God has a variety God's going to call couples that may not have children just like God will call people to be married God will call people to be single God will call people to be Unix and never get married no have no desire so God's got to have a testimony in every area I found this I was thinking this morning you know it's in Luke 20 where the Pharisees talked about the woman who married seven brothers and she was childless she never had children but the question was uh who is uh which husband is going to she is she going to be husband too in the resurrection they're trying to trick Jesus and Jesus said though we're not giving him marriage in the resurrection right but notice Jesus never said this situation couldn't occur right if the if the if the Sadducees asked about it then there's probably likely something like that had happened before so think about that a woman married seven men and they could never have children and she died childless they all died childless but Jesus says there I'm going to read it I want you to notice what Jesus says Luke 20:31 so I never had seen this thought here you know before so I want to preach this by God's grace 2031 and the third took her and in like matter the seven men also and they left no children and died last of all the woman died also so it said the men left no children so that's interesting there the thought there I may it was the men's bodies that couldn't reproduce last of all the woman died also verse 33 therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her a wife and Jesus answered said to them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither Mary nor given in marriage so I just want to lay this out here Jesus never says this this woman and these men couldn't be in the resurrection he says those that will be there will be counted Worthy and the church said in other words you honored God you loved God you kept the commands with all your heart soul might and strength and therefore Jesus said you'll walk with me in white because you are worthy you received the gift of Salvation then the rest of your life proved your gratitude for that gift of Salvation hallelujah oh amen now here's one I was mentioning earlier 2 Kings 4:8 can you pull it up there and it fell on a day that Elisha passed to shunem where was a a great woman let's say great woman ready great woman in church this time she had no children and the Bible calls her a great woman Hallelujah this might be a good Mother's Day message I should have saved it for me but notice it caused her a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed by he turned and thither to eat bread right and we we're familiar with the story she says H husband let's build build a a little place for him to rest I think I think they had a table in there and a bed and a chair I think that's all they had like a bed that's all they did and then Elisha goes up and says I'm going to give you something thus sayith the Lord uh the Bible says the f the man was too old to have children but she was younger but he says but he says thus sayi the Lord you'll have a child this time of year you'll Embrace a son and he come back later and she had a son but we know then later she was out in the field and he died right remember that but she said all is well the shunamite go get the prophet and the prophet laid on him you know face to face and he woke up and the resurrection there he's raised from the dead sneezed seven times and He restored the boy to the the woman but I want you to see the Bible called her a great woman before she had children but notice 2 Kings 4:28 then she said did I desire a son of my Lord this wasn't even a desire see because God had at that time had called them where they weren't called to have children right it was that wasn't their calling in life and it's really it looks like it wasn't even her desire to have him but the Bible called her a great woman Hallelujah that might make us scratch our heads a little bit right but it just shows God has a variety of Believers right did I not say Do not deceive me Hallelujah so see some some like this woman Jesus talked about some may live have seven husbands right and no child but they can still be counted worthy of the Resurrection other may be like this woman where it wasn't their desire God did not called them do that maybe she maybe she married him at a when he was old age and she was young right maybe he was a widower but she still wanted to be married and that was her opportunity to be married so see some are called to have children or no children others are called to have a testimony to seek children from the Lord like Hannah like Rachel right these women it was their that's their calling in life was to seek God and their promises were God said I'll make make the barren woman a happy woman who rejoices in her house with her children right you got Promises of that but you can also be a great woman for God hallelujah you can also be a great husband for god without having children so it's this great variety God gives us amen so I thought I'd preach that today I saw that oh that's interesting I saw that this morning in the scripture now let's I'm going to try to close with this here let's look at some responsibilities of the children I've talked about dads right I'm gonna jump ahead to the children because we've been talking about these youth meetings right and they said this last one they went to was the best youth youth meeting they they've had yet so that was good I was I was happy to hear that as a father I was happy to hear that by God's grace okay so Psalm 119 verse 9 got a few more scriptures by God's grace oh yeah I forgot about this one too yeah so uh yeah I guess I'll save that one about Hezekiah did you know Hezekiah this my wife shared this with me I didn't realize it but I looked it up too when Hezekiah was told he's going to die he had no son at that time he had no children well now that makes sense why he would Isaiah said thus say the Lord you're going to die what' he do he threw himself on the wall and cried and said God don't you remember I've served you with an honest heart well part of that was he had no son he's the king right and don't all dads want to see their children follow my steps maybe Malachi or Zion will be the pastor here one day you know that's that's my father's heart but it's not it's not my choice it's God's choice right it's nice if you're son but that it's not always the case but there's a father okay that's just like Hannah then that's just like Hannah there's a father throwing himself at the mercy of God and God said I'll give you 15 more years and he did have sons but they were real corrup corrupt I don't know if you ever read that hezekiah's Sons were real corrupt kind of like Samuel's Sons so remember look at that God honored his desire for the permissive will of God it would have been better for him to pass on without children I I'd never thought about that till right now actually as we're speaking here by God's grace preaching the word of God God would have said it would been better but then after God gave him the 15 years remember the Bible said he did not Render unto God what was given to him in other words he didn't he didn't do his part God blessed him and he should have been very grateful but he squandered it right by letting the Babylonian princes come in he showed he he showed all these Babylon princes all the blessings of God see that proves God church that proves God wants to hide his word from people right Jesus said Thank you Lord you've hidden these things from the wise and prudent don't cast your pearls you said that right brother don't cast your pearls CS Before Swine that proves God don't want some of them to see it Hallelujah wow amen this is fresh hallelujah hallelujah and I I like I heard brother Barry coffee say this when I was listening to the sermon yesterday he said God doesn't hide the word from us God hides the word for us right the word the Revelation the water baptism the godhead this isn't hidden from us but it God did hide it for us because God wanted to save it for his children who really love the word of God like my wife shared that verse out of Proverbs with me the righteous studies to answer Hallelujah yes and a fool looks at a situation and judges it before he hears the matter like a fool say well Jesus said father son Holy Ghost I don't need to know anything else about it that's foolish there's more Bible verses there's there's 65 more books in the Bible hallelujah amen God hides it for us because you're the Queen of Heaven Hallelujah you're the family of God Amen you're married to the Son of God Amen and he hid this for you Hallelujah this is your this is the children's bread hallelujah amen didn't Deuteronomy 2929 say uh that God hides these things these are the secret things belong to God hallelujah and to us as children that we might keep the way of the Lord hallelujah amen pull it up there uh Casa sorry not Lydia Deuteronomy 29:29 I'm starting to feel bold here Hallelujah by God's grace Amen to think that's cuz I battle these people online all the time the secret things belong to the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong to us and our children it's for you Malachi it's for you Haven and all my children ver Victoria it's for you Caris these secret Mysteries they're for you Hallelujah that you might keep God's way that you might be real Christians in this dark decrepit world it's for you that you may do all the words of this law how many believe they can keep all the words of this law my hands up it's pretty easy just love the Bible said if you love you keep all of them Hallelujah just love God fear God honor God Amen respect the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible says love him with all your heart and you'll keep all the commands Oh Glory all right I'm trying to finish up here Saints Psalm 119 verse 9 that's good for my teenagers here my little ones of course all of our little ones I tell you my I was a reminded this week the children are listening because Zion comes up and he said uh something about oh yeah I was saying the I said we had a mouse in our house last night I got him though but I said Zion he's stealing you know our food and he's digging into bags and stealing things and Zion said mice are an Abomination dad why would mice do an Abomination unto the Lord they just I said Abomination about 500 times last Sunday night by God's grace and the two weeks before he's like Daddy that's an Abomination I'm like you're exactly right that Mouse needs a die Judgment day today was Judgment Day I said he never asked to come in my house this my Dominion Psalm 119:9 so uh teenagers Beth Beth is the second Hebrew letter of the alphabet it means house or household so I think it's very fitting you know uh with the second letter meaning house or household it speaks of the youth right focusing on the what the youth should do in our houses where was shall a young man named Malachi cleanse his way one day I'll say James Andy Z how does a young man keep his way clean by taking heed that means watching guarding observing there to according to Thy Word in all your life you watch and you you guard your life with the word of God you guide your path with God's word you keep your your life clean by guarding it like Lydia and the girls were telling me at these youth of friend all these girl Lots I say maybe half of them are wearing makeup tight clothes message people did you see a few weeks ago we had some young people with makeup on in our church everybody see that I missed it but my children saw it I was all like just happy we had a guest preacher you I'm enjoying the word I missed it they had to let me know I was shocked afterwards I'm like how did I miss that brother B I'm just so happy you know thank God I get a day off I can just feed on the word of God I enjoy I enjoy it breaks too but this is how you keep a clean life you honor the word of God young man so that's what a clean life does it observes the word it guards the life it guards your life with the word of God I don't care what all my teenager friends are doing my life's going to be clean amen hallelujah my wife and I had it too you know when we first come to the message we were young people I was uh 21 when I heard the message I was a young person then Lydia's 20 that's right okay Glory well some of my friends didn't live so holy they still watch some my friends watch movies and you know they would go to movie theaters and do all kinds of things well my wife and I didn't do that I was watching my I was surrounded by football players and they had money and they had all kinds of parties I could have went to all those things but I didn't by God's grace I went to a couple before I'm talking about after I was saved after I was saved I never went to any but after I heard the word of God I knew I've got to keep my way clean I probably didn't even know this scripture amen but I knew enough about God Amen that if God saved me he wants me to uh he wants me to live for him Hallelujah if God washed me in the blood he wants to keep me clean by the blood Hallelujah so here we get the full effect of a a clean life for a young person this is house Beth house so if I see if we see sister Beth next week we'll say hi sister household I'm glad you keep taking care of your house sister that's your name that's what it means in Hebrew hi sister household God bless you I'm trying to skip there quicker here yeah this is the longest chapter in the Bible Psalm 119 with my whole heart have I sought thee so see what these young people need to do they got to seek God with all all their hearts oh let me not Wonder from thy commands Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee how's a young man keep his way clean let the word of God be in your heart and Desire with everything you've got to live pure before God right in Malachi saw all these guys that you know good friends and good good good guys around there some of them are doing girl chasing chasing girls yet they don't got a job don't got no money don't got a house in other words you ain't a man got no business trying to get a girl shame on them they've probably been taught better but see it's the lust of their eyes in church Satan always does it so gradually well this is okay you I'll just do a little bit here and if you keep that up pretty soon it turns into what is going on full out dating right we've seen it in the message we've seen it where uh boys and girls 12 and 15 years old 13 and 15 will trade clothes they'll you know the girls want to wear the sweatshirt of the boy and talk on the phone all nights to the hour they get caught sneaking off together in the message that's sin that's not a clean way that they're walking the dirty way the Bible says you know what they need they need a dad who's got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because the dad's responsible what kind of dad would let his girl wander off with the boy you don't got enough spiritual you don't got enough spiritual understanding to know that that boy don't he he hasn't done nothing to deserve to spend time with my daughter right he's not the head of my daughter I am I brought her in this world by God's grace you know she was G God's gift to me other words she's she's my she's my my my Vine she's my she's my plant Hallelujah she's my cornerstone think about that not even enough understanding blessed art thou oh Lord teach me thy statutes with my lips have I declared all the judgments of my mouth I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches amen if you can say I'd rather hear the word of God or the word of God is more important to me than $10 million because of inflation right you used to say a million dollars but the word of God is more important to me than $10 million that's how a young man say and a young woman stays pure like that song says we're going to sing that one I'd rather have Jesus than men's Applause that's I'd rather be true to his dear cause Hallelujah than have worldwide Fame I'd rather be true to the Holy Name of Jesus Hallelujah that's a young man who's after the heart of God hallelujah that's what I was but I'm a middle-aged man amen still call myself a young man I will medit Med itate in thy precepts and have respect unto thy ways I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget Thy word I'll I'll seek it first every day amen how do you how do you remember brother Jesse seek it every day Hallelujah remind myself Lord or Lord help me to remind myself of your promises like I told you I've so loved going through my old Bible transferring all my highlights to my new Bible because I get to see all these verses I forgot about I'm just overwhelmed I'm like my goodness this is talk about treasure Hallelujah these are precious and I think about down through my life so many of these verses were so important right when I needed them that verse directed my path amen hallelujah that verse guided me to the right choice Hallelujah so that's more precious than gold Hallelujah I could have fallen I could have made a mistake I could have went Shipwrecked but God's word was there to guide me his word was a lamp unto my my feet and a light into my path hallelujah amen Ecclesiastes 12 vers1 remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not like brother Phil right we kind of got that from his text like he was in the evil days it sound like he just wanted to passed away right and that's what we see with our loved ones sometimes they just they're ready to go home tough days remember Solomon talked about it it's like the lights are going out you know it's like you P the shades down and no matter what you put on your eyes you can't see nothing you're losing your eyesight he says nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them see it's our duty as parents re reme remind the children to remember God Ecclesiastes 12:13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole Duty or totality that's the word there in Hebrew the totality of man is to fear God and keep his commands for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be bad Hallelujah so what is the chief goal of man what's the chief end of man to fear God and keep his commands remember God while you're young aren't you glad brother van we heard it when we were young think about I was think about you brother van think about how God has blessed your life because you received it when you're young van can think about some of his uncles you know even people in his family that made awful choices because they didn't have the message of the hour I was thinking about you brother bang on your birthday buddy he can see now he can look back he's 41 he can look back he can see wow God has protected me from this protected me from that God has guided all my paths he's directed all my steps and bang look look at him bless back there holding little Andy by God's grace how many want to hold Annie me I'm going first I want to enjoy that blessing back there I was kissing his little hand he's a blessed man amen hallelujah because he heard the word of God as a young man and when some of his family went thank God his family some of his family did but not all his family stood with him but he's able to take a stand on the word of God hallelujah as an example to the family Hallelujah I'm trying to close I'm close yeah I'm going to close with these last two here so last last two here Isaiah 335 and 6 I I read this this week and I thought oh my goodness how have I never preached this scripture before so Isaiah 33:5 the Lord is exalted that's Jehovah that capital L O R D the proper name of god Jehovah the Lord is exalted the proper name for he dwelleth on high he ha filled Zion with judgment and righteousness so see when God dwells in a place there's judgment and righteousness see that if God dwelling in Zion and judgment and righteousness is there then we can look at our lives is if God is dwelling in my house if God's dwelling with me then there's judgment and righteousness in my house judgment is again taking each case doing what's right and righteousness is then doing living that out righteousness you're doing what's right how do I know God's in my life because I'm judging things the right way each case I judge by the word and then I go and I I do what the what the case should should I carry out the the Judgment of the case I'll say like that I carry out the command Hallelujah now the one I want to read is six I've never seen this one it's been years since I've seen this but it was highlighted and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times that jumped off the pages at me wow how many ever feel like you're living in an un uh an unstable time anybody feel like 2024 is kind of unstable I say the last four years have been pretty unstable everything was going good till 2020 but the Bible says if you're in a an uneasy time or a time of shaking time of shaking the Bible says if you want stability get wisdom and knowledge remember the Bible says that with all you're getting get wisdom in other words wisdom is doing what is right it's Sound Advice it's knowing what to do and when to do it right praise God knowing what to do and when to do it that's wisdom so what is it time to do now what should we be doing now the wisdom of God shows us what we should be doing now Hallelujah right like the wisdom of God showed us last year we should be dancing and we danced a lot last year we danced a little bit this year too I we needed that for that that time of our lives it shows us this is what should be done and also wisdom and knowledge is the strength of your salvation your deliverance right so wisdom and knowledge make you strong and bring Deliverance to you and I love this the fear of the Lord is your treasure right we talked about you know a young man must have wisdom and and that's greater than all riches right so we see a lap over we see the same idea here in other words you and I fearing God keeping his commands putting in first that is our treasure and that made me realize that's why I preach on that so many times put God first right honor God this last few months I found five or six verses where it says get up early seek God sing to God praise God I didn't even realize now till I read this that's what this is this is The Treasure of the believer worshiping God enjoying God in your home enjoying God in the church making God your treasure making God more valuable than all the riches of God this is the blessing of God's people hallelujah forgive me so what's the stability of your time what's the steadiness of your time what's the firmness that you stand on in in 2024 it's the wisdom and knowledge of God and Jesus Christ is wisdom personified right wisdom is personified as wisdom hath builded her house there's that feminine attribute right the father is like the masculine and the son is like the feminine the weaker element right so we see Christ is the wisdom of God Paul says that Christ is the wisdom of God I'll never forget Ben Gandy when he got out of prison we were over in that room there the where you had your wedding and where the food was we're in that room first time I talked to him we talked for like two hours and I said brother you know what are you hoping now what do you desire from God he said one word stability that has stayed with me brother all these years that was 2015 eight years later think about that a man what's one thing if if man we could ask you one thing what what would you want and he said stability right what what's the Bible say your stability is the wisdom and knowledge of God see knowledge is knowing the word that's good but that's not enough we need the wisdom of God to do the word at the right time Hallelujah right and now we can learn we can learn from our brother right we can learn from brother Ben right the fruits of people's lives you can learn from that Hallelujah stability was the word I thought my and this was highlighted in my old Bible I preached out of it for 14 years so Church in a time of a time of une easiness a time of shaking we need stability we need the wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy Ghost hallelujah how many can say Amen to that I know I'm going long here but hold on haven't even been I've been an hour and a half right now here last vers is uh Matthew 6:19 we'll close with this one here lay not up for yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where th thieves break through and steal now one time I had a uh some friends that were married and had children and I think I shared this before with the church and they were very sweet and gracious but they said for about 10 years they felt they were out of the perfect will of God because they were just trying to get a nicer home like physically like make it more nice and modern but they said while they were doing spending all that time improving their home they left off on the Bible study time with their children okay so see that's it's a it's a very good application and thank God for God's correction because we can all go off track sometimes because you know we got to be careful brother man says make your home a real nice place where the children aren't afraid to bring their friends right so if people take that I don't know if that's what happened but some people take that the wrong way like who well I better Pony up I better take out some loans I better work hard I better work overtime to make my house super fancy modern get that new uh Playstation I don't know what they do I don't know Roku I don't know you understand just give me the latest technology give me the let's put all this money into it but because of the overfocused on the natural they forgot the most important thing the most important thing is diligently teaching your children the word of God hallelujah seeking God first and there that's what they told me so the perfect will of God would then be just put God first and that all these construction projects come at God's right time and season Hallelujah but don't use a project to to leave the word of God wisdom would tell you no that's wrong wrong timing if I gotta if I got to miss out on praising God something's wrong with my timing if God gets less in my heart less of my love then it ain't time for that Hallelujah and the church said Jesus said don't lay up Treasures here on Earth and I'm not you know I'm not condemning these people either I'm just saying like it just it was a real example of someone telling me I'm I'm in the per permissive will of God because of natural improvements I'm trying to make money and time and then leaving out the spiritual element to it Hallelujah verse 20 but lay up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven Hallelujah where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where where your treasure is and that's the the treasure is the place in which good and precious things are collected and laid up if I could go in your house or your apartment today where would I find the treasure do you have like a safe would you let me look inside your safe some of you well what's inside there can I peek in here what Treasures are in here but really in a spiritual manner if I went to your home and I said let me see your Treasures you take out your Bible and you put it right by your heart and say the water baptism Jesus's blood the Holy Ghost this is my my treasure so where do you hide it in your heart Hallelujah now we all have natural things we got to take care of right guns or whatever we got you know savings bonds whatever you got but he said the greatest treasure Hallelujah is The Treasure of wisdom and knowledge being stable in these turbulent times Hallelujah the stability of the Holy Ghost for wherever your treasure is there will your heart be also let's stand to our feet musicians you can come by God's grace we'll stop right there brother Michael hope hope you enjoyed the service served by God's grace he's still smiling that's a good sign we just went our you know we're a small church so we want our visitors have a good time and not to feel you know uh pointed out or anything like that but just want you to feel our love by God's grace Saints how many uh how many want a house that that praises the Lord how many how many want a Christian family by God's grace I tried to focus on the men and the uh the parents and the teens you know today and we'll see kind of how Wednesday goes by God's grace then brother the Simon will be with us next week I hope that was a blessing to you how many blessed today to be in the house of the Lord today Hallelujah one thing I learned church is again that seeking God first if I can and this is you know this is something I constantly need God to help me with if God can can just help me seek him first then everything else will take care of itself and if I can just make sure that Jesus Christ is my treasure I have nothing else to worry about if he's my treasure and I can't afford this project well praise God then it wasn't wasn't God's time for it then but as long as I got The Treasure of Christ Hallelujah long as I got children around me right long I got my wife with me we're talking about the word we're talking about Jesus I'm able to command them Hallelujah they're able to be fruitful and praise the Lord and be the piano player the organ player the computer worker fruits to their lives that speak of the love of Jesus Christ and we can be grateful in these things let's bow our heads for word of prayer father God we just want to thank
