a few announcements I ordered ten of the Acts of the Prophet books I'll try to hold a little closer it's got a new cover on it so one for each family in the church so probably won't be able to give those to you till two Sundays because I won't be here this Sunday so we'll give it you following suddenly that's the 28th if I'm not mistaken of August by God's grace unless I see you before that time it's our first announcement technically this Sunday brother Brian Hawkins will be preaching one service at 1:00 p.m. at the same YMCA and I'm sorry sorry it's later no we don't have a choice I know I wish we could get earlier but just so you know we have to be out by 4:00 I didn't know that last time and so they were kind of rushing the family out and that's my fault I didn't know that but we need to be out by 4:00 so hopefully everybody can remember that by God's grace I'll try that brother pride know as well and lastly there's update for a regular Church office the landlord emailed me and said they're still blowing I think today's the final day of blowing air on the ground to get it dry and then we'll start sanitizing it tomorrow to make sure there's no mold or anything like that and that will take a couple of days so she did not know when we would be back in she thought she thought I think she said maybe a week or two but with construction we all know it goes longer I know that firsthand so it may be week two weeks three weeks a month we don't know I'll just try it each week to make sure I reserve the YMCA there by God's grace for Sunday services okay that's all the announcements is there anything else I'm missing variances he serves I cares okay yeah we have some prayer requests do you remember remember Benjamin and Austen Benjamin's in New Jersey he says he misses everybody so let's just keep praying for him and also I heard from Austin's grandma today and she said Austin's doing much better so it seems like it helped for him to move away and today I ordered him a Bible on Amazon and I sent to him supposed to get there by Monday so he did not have a Bible he did not have a phone so we were just trying to help him out and encourage him there by God's grace - prayer requests let's just remember brother Loras and prayers - so he's watching god bless you Utena pray for you sir and then Jason will keep praying for brother Jason for a job and

[Music] [Music] I should just do a different text here let's just go back to Matthew 10 verse 28 we'll use that text for today Matthew 10:28 we'll just go back to that text we usually preach part one on biblical and numerology and when to preach part three tonight by the grace of the Lord Matthew 10:28 the scripture says and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear you not therefore you are of more value than the sparrows amen that's a word of Prayer let's ask God to bless his word here father in heaven Lord we love you Lord we've read your word we've sung your songs we ask o God that your Holy Spirit your presence will come an ointment or to preach your word to your people Lord may be received with the same spirit or the same hunger and thirst Lord of the Holy Spirit Lord we want to be filled tonight we want our minds though we want our souls filled on God we want all of our being filled with the Spirit of God let us have a fresh anointing a fresh inspirational God tonight dear God in your divine presence Lord teach us through thy word speak to us encourage us help us O God guide us along our way Lord this path you have for us and we know you do it in Jesus Christ's name nobody said Amen God this should be seen praise God I just before I get into the sermon I just want to give a little update on most of these may have saw it in the news the kind of way to give update on modern events and I think I don't think it may be not on this one here I had a little bit of thought okay here to chip and it kind of goes with the question I had a few weeks ago so I just want to like I want to talk about the Roman Catholic Church tonight just to start off for a moment here before we get to biblical numerology yesterday there was a report that came out from Pennsylvania was a grand jury it was a grand jury I'm not mistaken one of those court systems in Pennsylvania and they had done a report for 18 months so a year and a half they did a report and they investigated six diocese in Pennsylvania and they found over 1,000 victims of sexual abuse more than 300 more pre-report so each report if I remember right from the news outlets and the reason I'm sharing this is because there's two reasons the prophet of God told us to watch the purple curtain so we also watch the iron curtain Russia where brother Branham who said later towards the end of the message the Holy Spirit put a little more force and said watch the purple curtain so we watch you know watch the Pope and we watch what he does the church but this week we've seen how more of the abuse has become public knowledge you know remember a few years ago when it was really big in Boston so know my wife I remember and it was awful I don't know how many I don't know compared to that this strategy tragedy here in Pennsylvania I don't know how how it compares to that emboss and I don't know but again there's over a thousand victims and those are just the ones that came forward the I think it was the Attorney General I'm not mistaken from Pennsylvania reported and said that there's probably thousands more so I just wanted to start with this and and share that a few weeks ago how this ties in with our ministry a few weeks ago you might remember I was preaching on how I rather be a doormat in the house the Lord does anybody remember that was on the Wednesday night and brother Brad was making the point that Christians are going to be mistreated well after the sermon someone had a concern and they just wanted to clarify what I meant by that and they they wanted to make sure that I didn't think it was okay to her children and of course I said it's always wrong to her children it's always wrong no matter verbally physically sexually any way to hurt a child and that cased an adult I do not believe it's okay to abuse anyone the point I was making from brother branham's quote was that as Christians many times people are gonna sin against us hurt us and we've got to be able to take it and forgive them we know Jesus said if someone offends you were supposed to go to them as well but I was not referring that anyone should ever be abused and then hide it from other people so I just wanted to clarify that I appreciated the person coming to talk to me they seemed very sincere I think that was a godly thing to do but I want everyone to know plainly that it is wrong to abuse any child or any adult anyone at all all abuse is of the devil all abuse is from the pits of hell so I hope everybody knows that by God's grace or the ramsett a real man would never make a woman a doormat okay but the point brother man was making there is that you know just as Jesus was persecuted his disciples were persecuted so we expect at some point will be persecuted or mocked or made fun of or ridiculed and we have to take that so that's the point I was trying to make by the grace of God let me share this as well because of all this all the predator priests that we've seen Horsham Boston now in Pennsylvania it's it reminds us that the Bible says this is why we preach against the Roman Catholic Church not because we're against the people because we're against the spirit behind the system that's why we preach against the Roman Catholic Church because the Bible said she is a cage of unclean and hateful bird I know that's all that sounds awful but that's the truth of the Bible and this investigation in Pennsylvania helps further prove that that's why year after year you know decade after decade I keep preaching against that system because this is what it produces then let me quote you some quotations directly from an article I read and then also an interview with people who were abused let me read you some things here there was a man who was interviewed who was abused as a child in the Roman Catholic Church he became a Catholic priest for 18 years and he said there is something in the DNA of the church that encourages sexual abuse and we know what that is that's evil spirits it's the evil spirits that are in the Roman Catholic Church he said as he he made his way through the system for 18 years he realized there was an epidemic among the priests and and then a Christian named Matt Walsh wrote a blog about it I'm gonna read some of his quotes he read about he read parts of the investigation report and said there were violent sexual assault and rape charges there were abortions that came out because of this even overdoses on drugs and deaths all because of all this perversion this abuse which is so awful but he noted that church official churches officials covered up all these acts and they're the people that cover them up the priests that cover them up are the workers they're just as guilty as those people who committed the acts because we should not keep silent when we see evil we have to be the voice for the voiceless so that's a good point he made he said these this wickedness is straight from the pits of hell and and there was so much more to be said but I'm going to probably stop there and just so you know my advice to the church and the people for children or even adults familiar family friends or in this case trusted men in the church so that's why we never leave our children alone with other people we always want to be with them now of course you have you know family that can be trusted make sure they can be trusted before you leave your children with them as a father I don't do many sleepovers my children here or other places very very rarely does that happen in order to protect our children and remember the priest a lot of their abuse was was with boys now I know a lot of abuses with little girls as well but they're finding in these cases these priests are attacking a lot of teenage boys which is really awful course it's all awful but just to give you an idea of what they found through this 18-month report so really be wise be wise around our church when we gather you know together no matter where we are always be wise always keep an eye where your children are just because sometimes we'll get visitors you never know what they might do just make sure whatever you do with your children you're with them as much as possible or if someone is caring over them who you know is born to get and is not going to do an evil act to them because a lot you know some of these priests would do the evil acts in front of other people like one of the examples was the the priest would be in a classroom teaching a classroom and he would call boys up to read out of the Catholic books and he would even abuse them right there behind the desk so he would have his hands in a place where he would abused him so this devil is so wicked he's so conniving he's so evil he'll stoop to any depth to express his evil spirits so we've got to make sure we have the Holy Spirit and with the Holy Spirit we protect all the children all the adults live a life that's worthy well we never hurt anyone so I just don't let everyone know when I preach that message about being a doormat I did not mean for any child of course not any child should never be abused nor should any dog be abused I just want to make sure I say that I want to take about ten minutes to address that because that's very important and this is not limited to the Roman Catholic Church you know my wife and I have talked numerous times we've we've read other blogs and articles and abuses in almost all the churches so whenever there's a person who's not learned again they're susceptible to that type of behavior but a person who's truly born again will not do it because the Bible said the effeminate will not inherit the kingdom of God and the effeminate in the Greek means a child of molester so anyone who molest a child is clearly not born again and so when you have a church leader or a church anyone trusted in the church in any office if they would commit such an act and crews they're not born again it proves they're not sanctified I would go as far as saying it may prove they're not even saved yet they just had an intellectual conception of God and they've never even repented of their sin because they've never learned to hate sin they've never learned to hate abuse so please contact me if you have any questions I just want to be absolutely clear on that and let you know that we're watching the purple curtain and we're seeing now I don't know how Satan is gonna do this his number saying is going to see the whole world he's going to unite all the churches the Protestant churches first in the World Council of Churches and then the Roman Catholic Church is going to gain ahead over them I don't know how he's going to do this maybe there will be a so-called purge in the Roman Catholic Church so people will accept them more I don't know but what you know one thing all this jesus said by their fruits they are known and so with that I think I'll I'll just stop right there and hopefully that clears up everything by the grace of the Lord so god bless everybody but I can't look continue now at numerology so I guess we can relax a little bit by God's grace and that's a very serious subject but I want to look again at numeral Gino brother branham said God is known by his numbers and this last week I told you I had more reading do I finish unit unit four I'm sorry chapter four rather in the Bulger book about numbers in Scripture and as I was going through there Jose sent me a few extra examples of numbers and different people suggested different numbers that I have forgotten about so I'm going to cover 1 through 4 tonight again by God's grace and I'm going to add only new things I'm not going to bring up anything old unless it's relative or helpful to help you understand it so is everybody ready my guys Gracie got Bibles here while we get off I've already turned me you can read it young Bible we read them I take all the help I can get Rina I keep you guys engaged as well ok so for number one number one means primacy or preeminence or unity and the first example or the only example I have of this when I thought it later as I was reading the scripture 1st Corinthians 6:16 the Bible said when two are joined together physically they become one flesh so that's an example of unity so in a marriage relationship when two people are married and come together physically now they've expressed unity a oneness the Bible says there's one flesh oh I could add another one here the Bible said when you become a Christian you're now one spirit with the Lord so you have the natural unity and then you have the spiritual unity so I could add that here why don't I okay now I felt you know let again to study on this and I'll tell you another reason why I went to the dry cleaner yesterday and I dropped off all my dry cleaning and I walked in there and the woman says you're you're five you're four minutes late Jesse I said what was i late for I didn't even know how I'm supposed to be here four minutes ago and I just joking and she said someone had a Bible question and I said oh okay I wish I could have been here I said what was the question and she said she said what does the four corners of the earth mean and I said I said oh and it was so strange I'm preaching on numbers and a person asked me about the phone number four so I could see God's hand in that so I said well what you probably think is that people are saying the earth is flat now I personally don't believe that I think the earth is round and there's different reasons if you want and the people want me to preach a sermon on that I could but I'll explain it just like I did yesterday the word corner there means angle so there's four angles to the earth in other words there's four directions so north south east west no matter where you are the Bible said that the angels were going to hold the four winds on the four corners of the earth so that means the wind from any direction God is going to hold back the winds and the wind means strife or Wars for the brand says so all the wars from any direction so any direction where you could think of a war coming from naught is gonna hold that back until 144,000 are sealed with the Holy Ghost with the seal their foreheads then the angels will let loose all those winds and then the destruction will come upon the earth and arm again but that's what I told the woman there and I left my card and I said well please email me or please call me if you have any other questions so it was interesting that people are asking about numbers yesterday and so I thought I would continue on numbers by the grace of God I'll preach a little bit more about the four corners in just a moment okay that's look at number two now I have some new ones for this by the grace of God Malakai why don't you go to Luke 12:51 Lydia Philippians 1 23 and 24 let me set the timer here 12:51 and Lydia flip ian's 123 if we since we have no more time tonight I think I'll do that I think I love I think I'll read a few more scriptures because I only have let's see I guess you have quite a few slides maybe I'll just read them at the beginning and then we'll move a little faster here so malachi number 2 speaks of poor things it can speak of division it can speak of difference like contrasting two things it could stand for testimony or witness they can also stand for friendship or unity malachi want to read this 12:51 52d men Jesus plainly says I come to bring division I'm going to separate believers from unbelievers to represents the vision on this case 5 is divided into groups 3 - it's not divided evenly with humans is divided 3 and 2 okay Lydia Philippians 123 Paul has two desires so Paul is kind of divided in his heart I've got two desires Philippians 1 23 and 24 - by the foot is more needful for you amen so can everybody see the two parts Paul was divided part of me wants to go to heaven but part of me wants to stay here the Bible let's talk about that for us right we talked about that a few weeks ago with the groanings we're groaning for a new body well the only way to do that is to leave this body here and then go to that body unless the rapture takes place and that body was swallowed up in their body right here so to speak subdivision now - speaks for difference in Matthew 21 Jesus used a parable two sons to show true repentance verse false repentance remember when the son said oh I'll go work for your dad but he didn't that was false repentance and then the one said oh I'm not going to work for a dad but then he did a 180 he did repentance and he went work for the father so see you have that shows the difference so we have two paths and that shows the difference that's one way to repentance the other way is the false way now jesus said there's a difference at the rapture there's two grinding at the mill one is taken one is left there's two working in the field one is taken what is left there's two sleeping in a bed one is taken what is left that shows the difference of the Holy Ghost o believer versus those who are not amen Jesus preached a parable to debtors and showed the difference between who would love in the most whoever was forgiven the most would love the most how many love Jesus tonight amen think about all he's forgiving you from and I'll always make you love him more by God's grace you think of all the evils all the sins I can think of the ones I've done since I was even a Christian the ones I did before as a Christian and the one since I've done since I've been a Christian and it just get the list adds up now not as fast of course it doesn't have the best fast cuz I'm sanctified filled with the Spirit of God but I still fall short live Lord God but the more we see his forgiveness the more we love it that shows the difference I shows the difference between someone who loves them a little bit or someone who loves them a lot when they really can appreciate all the payment forgiven for amen alright now there's a couple more on difference Jesus said there was a parable two men brain one man was saying God be merciful to me a sinner beating himself with the chest the other man was saying they're looking and saying thank God I'm not like that's the difference between sure they cost contingent true religion will never it'll make you feel compassion for them it will not make you attack them and make yourself exalted in Pride but true religion will make you humble yourself and realize how much you really need Jesus amen that's the difference of two types of prayer in the church Paul said there's two kinds of glory for the two kinds of bodies there's a glory for the celestial which is the theophany and then there's a glory for the terrestrial this body right two kinds of glories that's first Corinthian 1540 Jesus now let's go to testimony as the testimony Jesus sent out his disciples two by two so twos he said about by twos because two you have a greater testimony but two Jesus gave Peter the keys of the kingdom which would have a 2 volt testimony and they also Luke can bind up the brokenhearted so if your heart is in pieces we just need the keys of the kingdom to bind that up amen hmm how they need to bring healing like these poor people in Pennsylvania that we can pray for their hearts are all broken up the Holy Spirit the keys can bind them up together and restore their hearts and give them some healing by God's grace also the keys the kingdom will loose demons off of people amen because Jesus commanded mark 9:25 Jesus rebuked the demons and told him to leave and he said never enter into him again now I was telling somebody that one in text this week I said we have the power it was a man actually was started with homosexuality he was texting me this week and I told him sir I said have you ever bound that spirit and then loose that spirit and rebuke that spirit and told that spirit to never return that's what we have to do we have to speak in the name of Jesus Christ and command those spirits to leave us and never come back amen if that's what Jesus Christ did in Jesus Christ it said the works that I do shall you do also amen hallelujah now also the whole Old Testament hangs as on a testimony on two scriptures write the law and the prophets the Bible said jesus said the laws of prophets hang on these two great Commandments I'm sorry the two commandments of love God with all your heart and then love your neighbors yourself all the law hangs on these two so these two are a testimony or a witness of God's righteousness you can hang everything you can hang all the laws on these two because these are a testimony of what God wants us to do love God and love people I've never seen that on a church sign love God love people right see they're trying to sum up the two greatest Commandments though that's true and that's what we should do love God with all of our hearts and then love people as well amen okay next year hurt me last one for number two friendship in unity Jesus said to that agree and ask the father will receive it and you just need to have that unity we have if Aaron and I could agree in Malachi 9 liddie not patient if all of us can agree if two of us could agree God will give it to us way then but it's got to be revealed it's got to be his will it's got to be revealed to us it's gotta be the time in season two man tells us that as well also there's one more I found in scripture this week the two horns remember the two horns on the Beast out of the land which was like a bison remember that revelation 13 it had two horns when they stand for it was a unity of ecclesiastical and civil civil powers well the rim said it was a union it was a you know Satan satanic one I should have put that on her here so I'm sorry I put it in the wrong section so this should be under Satan's invitation of the number two he has a false unity he has a unity with government power civil powers and then as church powers unified and you see that two years ago brother where America when Obama made the Bison the national mammal did you see that two years ago amen so that was just further proof that America is in Revelation 13 and is that beast that rose up on the land remember by some onions that's right yeah big announcement and they have a big old website on it now too but it's just more improvements God vindicating this message brother Graham said that in 1954 he said that that beasts on the land was a bison and people could argue about it but you can't argue about it anymore because the Bison is the National Buffalo I'm sorry the national mammal of this nation praise the Lord now so Satan has imitations of two he has the two horns with the Roman Catholic Church inside the United States and now here's another one I found Jesus said no man can serve two masters Satan will convince people especially Laodiceans write that they can serve God and Mammon because the Bible said they'll be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God see they still love God a little right with a false love it's a it's a figlio love it's not it's just a feeling love like like I all my love all my friends leave many of my friends that reject the message they tell me how much they love going to church they go to rock-and-roll churches and they feel good they have all these feelings well it's a false love because they love the feelings but they don't love the word right so Satan is trick them Satan's trick them oh you can love you can serve both masters you can enjoy lust of the flesh the worldly things trying to like lust of the eyes and you can love God but let me tell you you can't jesus said you can only serve one master but Satan has imitated this - and he's using - oh you can love God and still sin oh you can't if you love God you'll hate all sin because the sin was the reason Jesus died for you and so if you appreciate Jesus death you never want to enjoy any sin anymore so iniquity in q7o they love the spirits anointing the cast out Devils prophesied but they were workers of iniquity workers of sin so they love sin but they also enjoyed the Friends of God the Bible said friendship with the world is hatred or enmity with God in James 4:4 and flirting with the world is blasphemy of God's preeminence amen so anyone that flirts and still enjoys the things of the world they're blasting against the things of God right they're speaking evil against that by their own life because the Bible says if you enjoy sin after you've tasted the Spirit of God you crucified the Lord of fresh Bible says that in Hebrews chapter 6 does that make sense everybody so Satan has for murder the - oh you can love God and still love the world you can get drunk and still be a Christian oh you can't this is this is a false friendship that Satan has perverted you only serve one master okay let's go to number three now three has two meanings it means divine perfection and life and we'll look at some new ones here today I found a good one let's go to proverbs 15 20 I'm sorry Luke 15 22 in case you don't read that I never the Aaron if you could get let's do it a revelation 1 verse 1 and then a ship in Luke 13 22 the first one occations going to do is for life how three represents life did you catch it how many things were giving to the prodigal when he returned three he was given robe ring and shoes a member in verse 24 his father said we must rejoice but he was dead but now he's what why alive so 3 represents life so he comes back and he has three things ringing robe shoes three represents life he's dead now he's alive amen beautiful I thought that's beautiful just like member the seeds rose up on the third day of grace right rose up life Jesus rose on the third day praise God even though that was beautiful I never saw that before amen now beforehand read says I'm going to skip a few G before I get to his in Revelation like turning you can alter the revelation links we got a lot of reading in there brother Simon preached on Revelation one run one on Sunday I don't know if you got the chance to see that or not okay as hos they record it but then you put it on YouTube and I'm not sure if you're his friend on they use friend on Facebook or your Facebook idea I don't get on okay but your brothers on it right yeah I've got on here sorry I think I got account yeah sorry about that anyways I've got assignment preached a lot on Revelation one and then I remember this week that there's lots of threes in Revelation one so that will tell you with Sunday's message so before we read revelation one in nature there's three kinds of glory the Bible says the Sun there's a glory of the Sun those are the glory of the Moon and a glory of the stars that's in perscriptions 1541 there's three kinds of glory and not atmospheres next in the crucifixion Jesus took three people within the pray in the garden that's divine perfection yeah those three witnesses also in judgment how many woes are there for he was so there's divine perfection God is giving divine judgment against the world there's three world robe whoa was I'm sorry there's three woes that are poured out during the seven trumpets and that's in Revelation 9 12 okay now we return to revelation one brother Aaron K read verse 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it thank you it by His angels and to his servant John amen so you see this whole chapter chapter one is filled with threes we're gonna go through this cuz I think this is worth going showing you remember what did brother Simon say on Sunday that brother Branham talked about revelation one what's the one thing we're supposed to see about Jesus from revelation one he was what he's one yeah but also is he just a man or is he he's God so broke run Graham's a revelation one is the focus of this is to see how Jesus Christ is divine Carmy he's divine which means the fullness of God is in Jesus Christ when you've seen Jesus you've seen the father because the father is invisible who will never see but he became visible in the son so there's three things in verse 1 the brother Aaron read it was this revelation was divine given and this was divinely sent and divinely signified three there's three attributes being divinely given divine descent divinely signify signified by the angel right given divinely given to John and divinely sent as well praise the Lord oh yeah sent by the angel to that signified by the angel so there's a three so verse to Malachi can reverse two there's three and verse two ok so you see the three there John bear record of the Divine Word of God the divine testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw three see that three he's a witness he's a divine witness I gave up heavily witness of these three things word Jesus Christ oh all right free to the divine blessing there's three levels of divine blessing blessed on the reader blessed on the here I bless them to keep her glorious all these all these three sorts trying to show what divinity trying to show how this is a perfect book this is a perfect revelation of Jesus Christ because there's threes all right case you verse 4 now verse 4 and 8 said the same thing we just read verse 4 was all right so this is Jesus divine being this shows that he was which was he is and he is to come that's when you know your divine you're the same which was is it is to come you always be there right we leave we leave in and out of time but Jesus was before during after always there amen are they aren't he reversed five force and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth and him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood Amen I there's a bunch of three sir you know the first three is the coming Lord is presented as the faithful witness that's the divine prophet when he was on earth so prophet it means that the first begotten oh that's now he's a high priest right because he's risen first we got in reason that no he's a high priest so prophet priest what's next prophet priest and King and he's called the Prince of the kings of the air named prophet priest King son of man son of God son of David all these three DS to show God divinely perfected Jesus Christ and his roles and he has God I love this next one this is glorious verse five and six brother Aaron read part of it mount I read verse 6 as kings and priests unto God this oughta make us rejoice in verse 5 the Bible said him that loved us so we are divinely loved divinely not like God's gonna stop loving you tomorrow for God's gonna get so upset he's done with you he's gonna cut you off he's gonna cut me up no this is divine love this is a love so great that only God could express it amen so his people are divinely loved him that loved us his people are divinely cleansed because he's their wash he's washed us from our sins in his own blood amen glory so we're divinely love divinely washed and were divinely crowned in the Millennium because the Bible said he has made us kings and priests unto God and his father glory so we have these three divine attributes to us by God's grace I hear the door open his demeanor oh it's carefully I know like if someone was here like Aaron something else was coming it's what makes sure I greet them Mary praise the Lord can you see that you're divinely love oh we catch one thing tonight let's catch that He loves us divinely he washes us divinely and were crowned divinely amen we're so unworthy but he's so worth it okay Lydia can you read verses 17 and 18 yeah both sounds unity when I saw my father's feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me and staying in the meat through naught and the first and the last time he that liveth and was dead and behold I am how I heard before amen and have the keys of hell and death all rights to c3 in their crisis presented as divinely eternal because he's the first and the last so he's divinely eternal second he's presented as dead and alive which means he's divinely living his life is so great at Concord death right and thirdly I love this he is presented as divinely powerful because he has the keys or controls hell and death so he's divinely eternal divinely living and he's divinely powerful amen all right acacia can you read verse 19 and I think that's the last of the threes of Revelation when I had read that because it was so powerful okay so to spread the divine revelation yes to write three things just to write the things he has seen the things which are right now and the things which shall be Hereafter so I like was is is to come so that's the divine way to do it you had to write it down so you appreciate that you like how that connects with Sunday's messages I'm gonna preach on revelation 1 revelation 1 and I told him I said well I've been preaching some of those things and here we go we can see God's divine perfection in Revelation chapter 1 all these threes okay and I got a few more here there are three mentions that Abraham is called the friend of God so God gave a perfect witness he's called it in second chronicles Isaiah 41 and James chapter 2 Abraham is called the friend of God three times hey man so his friendship with God is perfect perfect the word Christian has found three times in the Bible that's the perfect name for a believer Christian X 11 X 25 first Peter 4:6 okay I found two imitators of Satan imitating number three how many Humber's is Jove hath great were they good comforters no they were so bad God made them ask job to pray for them to be forgiven the other name were Elif as Bildad and Zophar three miserable comforters let's see you would think well Oh God's enemy three it's a perfect number but then you do [Music] let me write it you don't have the right message they're sure not lining up with those things trying to alright how many adversaries indium I have three sanballat Tobiah and Yishuv you should and when they do they ridiculed her they mocked him made fun of him they said you'll never do this the government's gonna stop you he said even if a fox jumps on that wall it's kind of all over and they pay she said be quiet you don't have nothing to do with this we're gonna work with one hand another hand we're gonna fight y'all we're gonna wear to full purpose lest you go number two that oh that's a good one what would that fit in there number two must be a testimony a witness it must be the witness or a unity and was taking witness immunity okay all right so we're down a number for you a lot for number four I told you I didn't finish chapter four last week so I read the rest of chapter four there's a lot left so I'm gonna try it the highlights we're only gonna read the highlights because we're you know it's almost it's eight ten already so I wanna preached throughout twenty more minutes by God's grace 8:30 okay remember number four means deliverance I mean for that it means a double confirmation so God will confirm something twice with the double amount of witnesses and then it's also an earthly number which we'll talk about the four corners again in just a moment okay so let's look at double confirmation scriptures now God gives us a double confirmation of his love in Ephesians three I mentioned this last week but I didn't tell all of them and I wouldn't Aaron to hear him so I'm glad they came tonight the first thing is Paul said God's love has breath and breath means width and we saw from Scripture God loves us so much he separates us our sins as far as the East is from the West glories that's God love he has breath to us so it's so broad and wide it separates our sins totally from us second God's love has length and this was seen in the Bible said in Psalm 23 I'll dwell in the house Lord all the days of my life so the length of your life God's love is seen the length of your life the Bible also says that God's love extends to all generations that everybody say things that means our generation even you children you don't generation God's love extends to your generation aren't you glad I'm so glad extending for my generation amen thirdly the Bible said God's love has depth and the Bible said in Romans 11 oh the depths of the wisdom of God so his love is so great because it's full of wisdom his love is based upon wisdom in its deep deep knowledge so you have width you have length and now you have depth and the last one is height remember this one God's love the Bible said God's mercy reaches to the clouds his faithfulness reaches to the heavens it's so high God's love is so great it reaches all the way to hey man hallelujah so see there's four there's a double confirmation of God's love with those four aspects or four measurements to God's love okay where are we at with readers so we go back to Malachi okay let's see I forgot to delete it this one's kind of important now I go to first Chronicles 3 verse 5 while he's turning there I'm going to read a couple more first Chronicles 3:5 please Lydia why don't you go to number 13 first one okay so before we read from Malachi in Jesus's parable the town's I remember I remember the town someone was given five one was given to one was given one the man who had the two talents he earned a double reward right the by Jesus said because you've been paid boy - I'm gonna give you two more so he got a double confirmation of a reward let's see two and then two so that had turned into four she had four talents at the end which was a double confirmation he was right okay all right this one's powerful Malachi God gave Bathsheba a confirmation that she was forgiven in love so now can you read that these are born in Jerusalem she ate sure but in a different settlement poor Bessie bill daughter amen so Shiva had four sons I don't know if you knew that remember the first one died because of their sin God was gonna make them pay for their sin but after that God for gay bashing book a former stuns 'information right that God had forgiven her he blessed her with four sons remember there was a member with Michael member of David's right Michael because she spoke evil the holy ghost he said you're not having any God said I'm shutting up your room you have no wit you don't know children but now God blesses Bathsheba even after such an evil act as adultery she must have humbled herself she must have gotten right with God God gave her a double confirmation all right here's a next one Hebrews 2 verse 4 the Eligius 2 in Luke 13 God gave the Holy Ghost a double confirmation on the earth because in Hebrews 2 for the Bible says the Holy Ghost gave signs wonders miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost so God gave a double confirmation the Holy Ghost so if you're wondering oh god where you know will you confirm your word you just out looking no understand God's giving side he's back to his bride just so he's giving us a double confirmation of all he goes now Lydia in Luke 13 Jesus is telling a story about people who died a member the disciples asked them why did these people die they fell from the tower why did this happen why don't you go to the verse 7 that he can read 13 17 let me pause right there Jesus had just told the story of these people dying and he said he said it wasn't because their sin in other words it was just their time to die okay they look like accidents but God knew it was their time to go but then Jesus says right after that he says that sinners actually live here you read verse living the cruel quick event something about sinners so can you look at verse is a 4 or 5 where it says something about sinners and read letters ok can you read that course or those eighteen upon deterrence a little fence thank you there were sinners above all okay verse five I tell you nay but except you repent you shall all likewise perish okay so Jesus letting us know when when like when 9/11 happened and when all these tragedies happen if there are sinners that you know go die in these accidents they're just as simple as anybody else around the world that would die in any case or where that would live the Bible said all men are without excuse let me understand that if I was a guy that showed his as creative power and Godhead in every human being body and mind everyone knows because the Bible said it's a fool to say there is no God only a fool would say that so the Bible says God has revealed in Romans 1 God has revealed that he's got to everybody and it's in your body you can see it somehow through your body that God is real and so everybody's accountable that they have judgments but here jesus saying when people die in an accident it's time for them to go god knew where they were gonna go and god gave him a chance to be saved before they were taken no doubt about that and jesus has a verse 5 except you repent you shall all likewise perish there's my reminder and then he gives the parable of this fig tree remember this big tree three years the man came looking for fruit and there was no fruit but Lydia the Reavers ain't men burst 9 if it bear fruit well and if not then after that I shall cut it down this is something we need to remember Jesus talking about sinners here right you thought my sinners you know let's see three years he tried to give he tried to have a murder I try to have patience for three years and then when he's ready to cut them off God's mercy something said give them one more chance is that you were our event God gave you another chance amen to see God says I'm gonna give you a double confirmation in other words Jesus letting them know these people that died in the tower these people who died here they're all you know they were all given a chance I'm confirming it to you they have a chance I had mercy on them I gave them another opportunity to get right with God everybody see that easy gives them a double confirmation I'm not going to let it be three years I'm going to give them a fourth year I'm gonna have another double confirmation and another witness of my mercy and doesn't the Bible say that the Bible says because of God's long-suffering though the egg has an Africa the earth hasn't burned yet because of long suffering and so that's why God's long-suffering is it's a couple confirmation of his love waiting amen this patience praise the Lord hallelujah alright you like this one how many women were in Jesus of genealogy in Matthew chapter one how many how many how many one for it was Tamar Rahab Ruth Bathsheba so two or Jews two or Gentiles now to me this is a double confirmation that God is bringing equality in heaven between men and women that's that's what I think it is because remember Paul said in Galatians 3:28 in Christ there's neither female or male or male nor female in other words a woman is just as valuable to God as a man is now do they have different jobs on the earth of course you know a woman could never leave a church you know a man could never be a mother you know we know she might have to you know if them up if the mother died but you know what I mean a man could never have a baby I want you to show you that God gave a double confirmation that he could redeem women and he was bringing them full equality in eternal life aren't you glad God doesn't just give men eternal life aren't you glad scissors I'm glad God his men eternal life and we're very thankful for that this is a double confirmation of God's mercy in this grace amen I remember I think about how think about the awful past some of these women had number Taylor over all her husband's over her husband and her husband's brothers died so she deceived Judah by dressing up like a prostitute you remember that well she dresses just to bring the seed and God thought so much of her because he Jude had broken the word and she's just trying to get the word fulfilled right to have a husband and to raise up a name for this seed I thought so much of her he puts her in the lineage of Jesus Christ because Judah was breaking the word and so she honored the word oh my we know Rahab she was a prostitute but because she said oh I know you're God's an awesome God oh my lied to them Mikey right believe you shouldn't lie guys and then put her in the lineage of Jesus Christ oh my well of course we know Russia they didn't do nothing wrong she was the she was the model of all godliness and virtue and holiness and God put a Moabite right I'm all by who they were not supposed to enter the household of God for all those generations God put a Moabite woman into this lineage that lasted Bathsheba guilty of adultery guilty of all these things but God puts her in the very lineage of Jesus oh god is rich in mercy we should just rejoice and how much God can forgive us amen hallelujah gives us a double confirmation of his love all right I got no matter so much here I'm fast I'm it had to pick it up blooming Eve has mentioned four times in the Bible it's a double confirmation of her air so we can learn from her airs just like a woman number Jesus and remember Lot's wife but she was mentioned so we learned from her so Eve is mentioned more times to give a double confirmation of her heirs the first time she's mentioned her name is she's the mother of all living so this shows she was the mother of Cain the Serpent's see Genesis 4:1 Eve bare Cain got the man from the Lord this show she's either to see that Cain is a godly boy because he wasn't so he was either deceived or she was recognizing that even Cain's life his human life came from God so I'm not sure which one it is brother Branham says both yes she says both I'm not sure which one could be both as well the third time she's met mark mention is in 2nd Corinthians 11:3 as the serpent beguiled Eve Paul said your mind should be correct I'm fearful your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in Christ and this gives us a confirmation that Eve lost her virginity through deception because Paul said the church is a chaste virgin but I fear lest by any means you should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in Christ and lastly first thing when they too said then Eve the woman being deceived was in the transgression she cannot preach the word because she was deceived away from the word so those are the four witnesses of Eve as a double confirmation so we understand why she fell okay the rainbow how many times is the rainbow mentioned the Bible or two in the Old Testament Genesis 9 is equal one and then twice the New Testament both of Revelation the rainbow round about the throne some four times this is a double confirmation that God keeps his word God keeps his covenant Satan has four titles to double confirm his identity so we were not mistaken well I wonder if Satan's a serpent or the dragon Satan in Revelation 20 verse 2 is called Satan that old dragon that old serpent the devil he sends warnings here's a double confirmation he was the dragon he's the serpent he's the devil he's Satan Philip had for merging daughters which did prophesy so forth and I said perhaps I don't know for sure perhaps this is a double confirmation of his ministry maybe God will double confirm Philips ministry so he gave more daughters that prophesied a couple more okay here's the earthly number in revit Matthew 24:31 in revelation 7 1 through 12 the electors are gathered from the four winds and the four winds had to be held into the 144,000 or seals there's four winds the four angels that angel sent on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds and did you know the earth has four quarters as well now quarters doesn't mean a quarter doesn't mean like a fourth right it means like territory it means I actually have the actual word here it means space or territory so it's I do not believe the earth is flat I do not believe the earth is a rectangle or square I don't believe that I believe it's a globe believe it's a sphere but I see sometimes the Bible uses words but it uses them and it weighs differently than we use them so let me let me show that did you know Jesus said he said this the Pharisees love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets so see there's a time where corner doesn't mean like a corner on the on a figure the Pharisees were over in the corner frame so they could be seen they were right in the middle of the of the street to be seen so if the Bible says the earth has four corners that doesn't mean corners like on the edge of a sphere I'm sorry on corners on the edge of a rectangular prism or something like that or cube it doesn't mean those kind of corners it can mean space it can mean territory so does everybody see that there's one more bread had to be clean out in the end of your quarters territory it doesn't mean like a quarter of a piece of pie or something like that or a corner of a fraction doesn't mean look at that okay so hopefully that helps you but with the four corners of the earth now I am planning on talking with somebody soon and maybe they can convince me by the scripture at the earth is flat I'm open to being corrected but I personally think it is a sphere but that's just like I said that's because of the scriptures that I showed you okay next how many soldiers crucified Christ they wouldn't know because the Bible said when they divided his Dharma it into four parts so he had porn and that was Myra force on earth day number so God was using that to show an earth day number all right next hides the people in the four groups thirties tongues lands nations because four is an earthly number so that family you know the people on earth are dividing those four groups four groups as Genesis 10:31 how many Gentile powers were on that image that Daniel saw in Daniel chapter 2 4 right Babylon needs the Persians Grecians and then role now in Daniel 7 how many beasts were there there's four beasts the avilon was the lion Medes and Persians was the bear the grecian was were the leopard and it didn't say what the beast was for Rome we just said just describe the fourth beast and then tell you what it was but that's because of Revelation 13 all those beasts are combined into one beast and that's the Beast out of the sea the bees coming out of the sea remember it has like Paul's like a bear it's got teeth like a lion it's got feet like a leopard or something like that I forget the exact exactly the descriptions but can you see that those four beasts are now combined in Rome everybody can see that Rome and said that's because demons don't die people die but those demons remain right and they just move from one person to the next that's what happened with the Roman Catholic Church okay let me know how many kings that Abraham defeated before you met Melchizedek I mean he needs be remember what's communion with milk essica type of they were everyone remember the marriage supper of the Lamb here's at the marriage supper land after the rapture the marriage supper and lamb we're going to have communion the Bible said Jesus said I will eat that fruit afresh with you I'm sure I will drink of the vine with you afresh at the marriage supper of the Lamb so what four things do we have to conquer to get to the marriage supper of the Lamb the four horse riders remember they're combined into what one they're combined into the pail well Rams are those three are combined the four so just as Abraham had to defeat four kings Abraham's seed has to defeat four of those demon spirits he's got four powers the light the black and the red all into the pale we have to defeat those for my the grace of God amen I love it don't you love it Oh lor its earthly number they had to defeat those earthly kings we have to defeat these earthly demon powers how many know how many unclean animals that were or camel hair or rabbit the cony which is called the hyrax today I've never heard of it till today yeah I thought the Coney dogs on Coney Island or whatever and then the pig or swine and that's in Deuteronomy fourteen seventy there's four on camels here's the picture of the hyrax it's kind of like a rabbit except but don't have ears um and no big tail no bushy tail either so all the other Bible dictionaries said this was a hyrax and they're actually in danger now I think people have hunted them for so long that they're endangered so now you know what a Kony is it's a hi Rex and who remembers why why did God think they were so wise and then remember why we're gonna go over it in just a minute because they live in the rocks they're a small animal but they're wise because they go hide in the rock in the cleft of the rock okay oh thank you Jesus okay oh there's so much I just go the faster I want to get these things I want to start five next week bye guys grace there was four judgments upon Jerusalem in Ezekiel the sword famine the beasts and pestilence there was four abominations in the temple the days of Ezekiel there was an image of jealousy at the entry doors once you got inside the wall this is in Ezekiel chapter 8 once you got inside the walls that was creeping things and idols on the walls and then there was 70 men burning incense in there - all these images on the wall the third thing was women were weeping for Tammuz which is the deity for food at the door of the gate of the Lord's house because God had sent pestilence upon her so a famine upon them so they're weeping and crying out to their God and God said look at this abomination that was the third abomination the last abomination there was 25 men in the inner core near the altar and they turn their back to the altar of God and they were facing the East worshiping the Sun and God said that was the worst of all the abominations turning their backs on the blood right turn their backs on the blood and worshiping the creation rather than the Creator they're striking alright now there's four kinds of flesh you know that beasts like a dog or a tiger bird has a different kind of flesh fish and man four kinds of flesh this is beautiful there are four ways the human body is sown and raised in this is the first Corinthians 15 it's sown in corruption raising in corruption it's sown in dishonor raised and glory its sown in weakness raised in power and it's sown a natural body raised the spiritual baby oh it's earthly number this earthly body as those four negatives but then it has more positives on the other side oh thank you Jesus Jesus had four prohibitions to his preachers when he sent them out take no purse take no script which is food no purse money no shoes and don't salute any minute that's how focused they were supposed to be don't worry about food and worry about your shoes don't worry about money no we're about talking to anybody just go right to the city where I sent you and preach the word of named earthly number earthly number see that an earthly focus about the gospel little things in proverbs 30 system the first are ends why are ants wise remember they work in the summer that's why they're wise they gather their food in the summer so the winner isn't as bad cody's their feeble but why are they so wise because they live in the class of the rock amen and we gotta hide ours if we got we stay alive we got a hiding Christ amen right in his righteousness I didn't his life his forgiveness the next thing is locusts they have no king but why are their wise because they're divided up into groups of bands the Bible says they go by man's so maybe 100 here under there under there right that's why they're so wise they don't have a king but they know how to divide this dividing conquer right and the last thing is a spider spider so wise because it's so small you can find it in King's palaces it's so small and quiet you'll find it in a king's palace we find them about every quarter dude yeah there's some right there it is so quiet yeah they're so still and quiet and that shows what works quiet and still it shows a lot of wisdom I remember brother grant with that scripture above his pulpit said be still and know that I am God there's so much wisdom in being silent and waiting on God with full assurance okay almost I'm almost done this is good in the tabernacle Moses there was three things that were Foursquare the brazen altar where they birthed the animals the Urim and Thummim which he wore on the pre high priests wore on his breast and then the altar of incense where he burnt the incense and let the smoke rise into the holy suppose three of them work for sweater the New Jerusalem is Foursquare how do you know that it's got a base that's four square with equal length breadth and height it's four square so this is these fours are earthly numbers I love this and that's uh I'm gonna close with well let me go to these last few so go to second guardians for eight this is going to encourage you I know what does it really encourage anything sacred ends for eat this kind of goes along with Romans chapter five that we read last week about remember others for Hope or four steps to divine hope remember that there's four steps so you have divine hope or you're I'm sorry deliverance through hope let's look at Romans 4 8 and 9 in this scripture earthly suffering is fourfold but yet we're promised we can overcome it amen so maybe tonight you'll see yourself in one of these forms of persecutions but take courage you can overcome each one okay so the first one we are troubled on every side yet we're not amen so trouble but not distressed I've got troubles but I'm not upset about it we are perplexed but not in despair so they're confused about some things but they're not despair without hope right they're persecuted but they're not forsaken by God they're not a man that God is still with you know God's with you tonight no matter what you're going through no matter of persecution or trials you're never forsaken he's never abandoned you he's right there with you and lastly you might feel cast down you might get thrown down to this ground you might get thrown down to the ground by your friends and and just stomped on and made fun up but you are not destroyed amen they cannot your enemies cannot destroy your Saint cannot destroy her so we have this fourfold suffering but we have a fourfold promise as well that what Satan tries to accomplish he will not accomplish will overcome all four obstacles amen I thought you like that you like that is that energy praise God you can be trouble but not distressed you can be perplexed but not despair you can be persecuted but not forsaken you can be cast down but not destroyed Oh glory glory glory glory okay I got about I got six more I'll go try five more how they go fast four is a number of deliverance who members at an age in the days of Salman what did he do to get deliverance he was gonna die but he ran to something that had four corners why was that he ran down there and that was in first Kings one he ran down and grabbed ahold of the horns of the altar and Solomon said okay I'm not going to kill you because you fear God see he recognized there's deliverance at at the altar why because that's where your sacrifice was burned and that's where your sins were taking care of an author so he ran down there and loved those horns Solomon said he must fear God he's delivered but remember what happened he tried to he tried to take over Solomon again he ran out of the horns and Solomon killed him because he's / mercy he did it one too many times so because he tried to take the kingdom from Solomon saw himself review this time he again and Solomon said this time I'm not gonna have mercy remember that same I'm not saying whether there's a there's a reality to that altar it's in heaven the Bible says that in Revelation 19:13 there's four horns on the golden altar which is in heaven I wonder if Jesus sits on that throne tonight they made an altar and admin with orthros showing their deliverance through the four horns Jove had three messengers but then who came Allah who I'm sorry messieurs I you could actually make that gone too you can make it a five - but he had four human messengers we saw the three miserable comforters but then on the four if he got delivered a lot who right Allah who came and said I might be young he said I'm speaking by the inspiration of the Almighty name Amen he rebuked so joke about delivering Zog glory huh me knows how many acres they cast how to polish member pause on the ship as a slave and he would as a prisoner he was being taken away how many anchors they throw it out for four anchors save Paul's life and what was every think there was how many other mana 200 some men and that was in acts 27 29 the anchors the four acres delivered them from the rocks the Bible says so poor is a number of deliverance okay all right in closing I just got two more in close so thank you for bearing with me tonight it's 8:40 okay good we're doing it on time Satan imitates for as well I remember the four insects of Joel chapter 1 verse 4 Palmer worm locust cankerworm caterpillar was the port and brother Graham said those also represent the four horse riders hey you have to remember that they represent that because mother Graham said they're the same insect in the restoration of the bride tree 1962 police said they're just advanced stages all right in the last one Satan imitated four there were four men who took a vow to kill Paul they said I'm not gonna eat they said we're not gonna eat until Paul's dead or so Satan tried to impersonate that forward and try to put all this intimidation on Paul but Paul overcame by the blood of Jesus soon remember his nephew his nephew saved a little humble nephew a teenager save this great mighty prophet of God by telling Paul about it then Paul Ryan told the man he said I'm a Roman citizen and then where they let him out in the basket on the window and saved in my God's grace let's stand here by God's grace so with those of mine think of how these can be applied to our lives tonight by God's grace none taken [Music] you know as I was preparing this I thought the ones that might encourage us the most relation more types of suffering from second Corinthians could suffer for sink you promise never to leave us how can you suffer tonight any other ones that really I think the revelation [Music] Jesus what's that word well let's have premier by God's grace we thought we love you too mister thank you for your word Lord is so true another vindication about Revelation chapter one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] they do not stop thank you Jesus are that sink that's not miss fun enough mustard every tribe over the same integrity
