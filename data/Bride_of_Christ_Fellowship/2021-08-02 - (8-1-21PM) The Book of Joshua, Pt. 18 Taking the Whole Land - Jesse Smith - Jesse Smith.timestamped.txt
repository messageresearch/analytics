[0:00] got it maybe otherwise but we took time
[0:03] took some time to sit at jesus and the
[0:05] things that were given to us
[0:06] they won't be taken from us so joshua 13
[0:09] i have some slides here saints just a
[0:11] few slides here i'll try to keep it
[0:13] uh brief tonight but either way we're
[0:14] gathering together more it's a joy to
[0:16] see each one of you god richly bless you
[0:18] and we surely love you with the love of
[0:19] the lord by god's grace so
[0:21] uh hanging with me for a little bit
[0:22] longer here so i mean
[0:24] maybe i'll only preach hour tonight
[0:25] we'll see here let me just let me say
[0:28] the hour timer okay uh i don't
[0:30] i don't want to wear my voice out either
[0:31] but um welcome to august though by god's
[0:34] grace welcome to august it's good
[0:35] it's hard to believe it's the eighth
[0:36] month already eighth month we're
[0:38] almost done with this year right two
[0:39] thirds done with your
[0:42] hard to believe so let's look at this
[0:44] thought of taking the whole land now
[0:46] just i'm just bringing this from last
[0:48] week remember church we are just like
[0:49] joshua we have
[0:50] we have battles within the land and
[0:52] without the land
[0:54] okay now they had it within the land
[0:56] because they still had heathens in the
[0:58] land
[0:58] and then they had to guard their borders
[1:00] right they had outside enemies
[1:01] but for us it's a little different we
[1:03] have battles inside of our bodies
[1:06] and outside of our bodies like with you
[1:09] know with people that persecute us or
[1:10] people that
[1:11] mock us or make fun of us or you know
[1:13] belittle us
[1:14] or something like that because paul said
[1:17] without i had fightings
[1:20] and within he had fears now i don't know
[1:21] what kind of fightings these were saints
[1:23] but look
[1:24] he had to fight off robbers now can you
[1:26] imagine that
[1:27] god let his prophet be rubbed was it was
[1:30] he still loving
[1:32] oh absolutely was he sometimes
[1:35] god let him be robbed
[1:39] did he have perils and waters did he
[1:40] have trouble on the seas yeah he did
[1:43] yet he's the prophet of god church age
[1:45] messenger a star in the hand of jesus
[1:46] right
[1:48] i'm sorry without trouble i'm talking
[1:50] about so he had robbers he was
[1:52] he had to constantly worry about getting
[1:53] stolen from he had problems traveling
[1:56] shipwrecks right troubles with heathen
[2:00] people
[2:00] heathen gentiles perils in the city
[2:04] right
[2:04] trouble in the city perils in the
[2:06] wilderness
[2:09] perils in the sea perils among false
[2:11] brethren
[2:12] it looked like church every place he
[2:14] turned he had trouble outside
[2:16] but then inside he's still battling fear
[2:18] that's why he said pray for me that i'll
[2:20] have boldness
[2:21] see because he was just like you and i
[2:23] right
[2:25] that's right now you might have a minor
[2:27] prophetic gift
[2:29] and that'd be great that'd be wonderful
[2:31] to help the body of christ
[2:32] but here he had trouble on every side
[2:35] but yet he was fearful on the inside am
[2:37] i going to get robbed today
[2:38] so church don't feel bad if you worry
[2:40] about am i going to get covenant am i
[2:42] going to get the delta variant
[2:44] right i got the first covenant well i
[2:46] might get the delta variant too
[2:47] that's a fear that we may have inside
[2:50] but it's common that's human nature
[2:52] but we got to battle that fear off by
[2:54] god's grace
[2:56] praise god got to battle that fear off
[2:58] the inside fears
[3:00] and then we have these outside battles
[3:02] too so see how it's so similar it is so
[3:04] similar
[3:05] to joshua they had inside battles within
[3:08] right and then they had battled without
[3:11] and so we
[3:12] can benefit from joshua by looking at
[3:14] that and seeing how god was faithful
[3:17] god kept his word praise god god always
[3:19] backed up his word to joshua
[3:21] amen i just thought of a different
[3:22] scripture let me see if i can find it
[3:24] real quick
[3:28] this just came to my mind and usually
[3:30] i'll stop if something
[3:31] seemed like i could be a help to the
[3:32] people
[3:34] i thought it was a last verse but maybe
[3:36] not maybe i'm
[3:38] okay i think i must be thinking of a
[3:40] different
[3:43] oh no there it is okay yeah go to uh
[3:46] let's skip ahead real quick go to
[3:47] joshua21 i heard it this this good
[3:49] scripture look at this
[3:53] yeah wow great joshua 2144 look at that
[3:56] my
[3:58] take courage church take courage let's
[3:59] take courage from joshua
[4:02] that as he had he had a trust in god in
[4:04] every battle he had to trust in god
[4:06] church
[4:07] every battle he trusted in god and every
[4:08] battle he eventually was victorious
[4:11] so will you be you you're gonna have you
[4:14] and i are gonna have lots of battles
[4:16] in fact history says it took him seven
[4:18] or eight years to defeat those 31 kings
[4:20] it just didn't all happen in like two
[4:22] months it was just
[4:24] bad here take a few months off
[4:27] battle there a couple months off battle
[4:29] battle that's how it is for us
[4:30] we have a battle we'll get out of battle
[4:32] praise god just enjoy some seasons of
[4:34] rest
[4:34] then we're back in another battle praise
[4:35] god but if we just stay faithful we just
[4:38] obey the voice of the lord
[4:39] god will make us conquerors look at
[4:42] verse 44 this is beautiful
[4:43] and the lord gave them rest round about
[4:45] so the lord gave them battles first
[4:46] brother bang
[4:47] 31 kings worth of battles and then he
[4:50] gave him rest amen
[4:52] see god's going to give you battles then
[4:53] he's going to give you rest
[4:55] according to all that he swear to their
[4:56] fathers and there stood not a man of
[4:58] all their enemies before them
[5:01] uh i don't have this up on the screen
[5:03] sorry the lord delivered all their
[5:05] enemies into their hand look aw
[5:07] so anyone that was willing to fight the
[5:09] battles is
[5:10] willing to stand there and god would
[5:12] give you the victory
[5:14] as long as you're willing to face that
[5:16] enemy and say devil i'm going to stand
[5:18] up i'm
[5:18] going to cower to you i'm going to stand
[5:20] up to you in the mighty name of jesus
[5:22] as long as god made a victory
[5:26] look at this look at verse 45 there
[5:28] failed not ought
[5:29] any of good thing with which
[5:33] the lord had spoken unto the house of
[5:35] israel
[5:36] all came to pass
[5:40] think about that testimony church if we
[5:42] live to die like if we
[5:44] in a real session or procession i hope
[5:47] somebody says
[5:48] every promise god made to jesse it was
[5:50] fulfilled praise god
[5:52] that's what i want my testimony to be if
[5:54] if i live and
[5:55] the rapture is after my lifetime i want
[5:57] to have that testimony
[5:58] and before i die i want to tell
[5:59] everybody i look my children to eye and
[6:01] say
[6:01] everything god promised to me he brought
[6:03] it to pass amen
[6:05] and every man that stood before me every
[6:07] demon that stood before me
[6:08] i overcame it by the blood of christ and
[6:11] the word of my testimony
[6:13] see this is what they had the natural by
[6:16] animal blood what about us
[6:17] in the spiritual with the son of god
[6:19] holy blood amen
[6:21] what about that church see we see
[6:24] we can be happy the priests come praise
[6:27] god
[6:27] we may not see it now but the victory's
[6:30] on the way
[6:31] amen and this becomes more and more real
[6:35] the longer we're christians right
[6:38] because this person will come that
[6:39] person will come
[6:40] these battles are coming up and as long
[6:42] as we stand there with the word of god
[6:43] we know we're going to get the victory
[6:45] we might have fears within
[6:47] we definitely got battles without
[6:48] praising but as long as we got christ
[6:50] within we know the victory's on the way
[6:55] now as i said this morning i want to
[6:58] stir you up again
[6:59] remember church every place or every
[7:01] blessing is ours if we'll fight for it
[7:04] just real quickly remember every place
[7:07] that your feet goes
[7:08] you'll have because paul said he's
[7:11] blessed us with
[7:12] all spiritual blessings
[7:16] every every ev everything you want to
[7:18] conquer church you can conquer in jesus
[7:20] name
[7:21] anything anything you want to see god
[7:23] give you the victory over
[7:25] it's yours just believe it praise god if
[7:28] it's a spiritual blessing
[7:29] and peter said he's given all given gift
[7:32] given all things that pertain unto life
[7:35] oh in my life i really could use this
[7:36] well it's given to you
[7:39] in my life i could use some godliness
[7:41] right it's given to you how do you get
[7:44] it though by
[7:45] promises right by promises you're a
[7:47] partaker so in other words lord
[7:49] you gave me the promise of peace you
[7:51] gave me the promise of victory you gave
[7:53] me the promise of forgiveness you give
[7:55] me the promise of the gifts of the holy
[7:57] spirit i know you're going to bring it
[7:58] to pass
[7:59] thank you for the promise i'm going to
[8:00] keep confessing it until i see it come
[8:02] to pass in my life
[8:04] we partake of all these blessings by
[8:07] believing the promise
[8:09] like abraham for 25 years believe god's
[8:12] going to give me a seed
[8:13] god's going to give me a child and
[8:15] sometimes he questioned him but the
[8:16] bible said he staggered not
[8:18] at the promise of god amen but he was
[8:20] strong in faith
[8:21] giving god the glory we ought to give
[8:23] glory tonight if there's a promise you
[8:24] want from god
[8:25] but you don't have it yet but you know
[8:27] it's coming you ought to give god glory
[8:30] i didn't know you glory that's right
[8:34] we must be strong in faith giving god
[8:36] the glory
[8:40] and didn't paul say if he spared not his
[8:43] son
[8:43] his own son but delivered him up for us
[8:45] all how shall need he not
[8:47] also with him freely give us all things
[8:52] now all things that pertain to our walk
[8:54] with god right
[8:56] because a sister's walk is gonna look a
[8:57] lot different than a brother's walk
[9:00] right so anything that pertains to a
[9:02] sister's walk you can have it all
[9:04] sisters
[9:05] brothers anything that pertains to a
[9:06] walk for the brothers you can have all
[9:08] of it
[9:10] and you will have all of it if you're a
[9:11] real holy ghost-filled christian
[9:14] you will have all of it praise god
[9:18] now look here's another one i just read
[9:20] this yesterday i'm like oh i got to add
[9:21] this one in there
[9:22] as sorrowful yet rejoicing
[9:26] as poor yet making many rich these were
[9:29] poor preachers but they made people
[9:30] spiritually rich
[9:32] having nothing and yet possessing all
[9:36] oh man paul's like give me that coat
[9:39] make sure you bring my one coat i don't
[9:41] have any i
[9:41] have no other coats so he had nothing
[9:44] but yet he said he had
[9:45] everything because he said i can do all
[9:47] things through christ who strengthens me
[9:50] see the presence of jesus christ the
[9:52] peace of jesus christ
[9:53] the love of jesus christ uh the mercy of
[9:57] christ if he had he had it all
[10:01] so church what's stopping you what's
[10:02] stopping me from possessing any
[10:04] spiritual blessing just time
[10:06] right just time and unbelief we gotta
[10:08] kick out on the belief
[10:09] and give god glory while we're waiting
[10:11] for the blessing to come
[10:14] so think about that church what blessing
[10:16] do you want your life just keep trusting
[10:18] god for it
[10:19] just keep saying i'm just like joshua
[10:21] every place where i put my foot
[10:23] yeah i'm going to get the victory in
[10:24] that that's going to be my possession
[10:26] okay so i just want to stir your minds
[10:28] up again i'll stir you up i'm going to
[10:29] boil you up praise god
[10:30] turn up the heat there
[10:33] now i'm not going to preach this whole
[10:35] chapter because uh
[10:36] i only found i really only found
[10:38] inspiration in maybe a couple of verses
[10:40] okay as far as like
[10:41] things that i thought would be a benefit
[10:43] to us right for reading
[10:45] just like this morning i had like 60
[10:46] quotes well i only read a couple of them
[10:49] right you know you
[10:49] can't read all of them but uh you can't
[10:52] i can't read all these verses right but
[10:53] i can give you the outline and then kind
[10:55] of preach what i felt inspired to preach
[10:57] now the outline is there's much land to
[10:59] be possessed uh by the nine and a half
[11:01] tribes because remember two and a half
[11:03] tribes
[11:03] already got their land on the uh east
[11:06] side of jordan
[11:08] right so verses one to seven is what
[11:10] we'll focus on
[11:11] now verses eight to twelve uh
[11:14] god talks about the land east of jordan
[11:16] given to the reubenites and gadites
[11:19] and then in verse 13 estranged he just
[11:20] puts he says there's two heathen groups
[11:22] dwelling in the land
[11:23] in that land still and then verse 14 and
[11:26] 31 said levites inherit nothing
[11:28] they just inherit the lord that's a
[11:31] beautiful type there
[11:33] hallelujah that's a beautiful type of us
[11:35] right who who's our portion
[11:37] god's our portion amen jesus is our
[11:39] portion
[11:41] let the celebrities go rent their uh
[11:43] their speed boats and go have their
[11:45] their boat
[11:45] their boat party that's fine just give
[11:48] me jesus
[11:49] let them have their movie theaters and
[11:51] their showings and
[11:52] and their private security just let me
[11:55] have the angel of the lord right here
[11:57] but the bible said the angel lord
[12:00] encompass all those that fear the lord
[12:02] and he will deliver us
[12:04] amen psalm 34 7 praise god
[12:08] let me have that let me have that escort
[12:10] by god's grace
[12:12] oh hallelujah the rumor knights
[12:16] their inheritance gaddites and then the
[12:17] half tribe of half tribe of manasseh
[12:19] rather
[12:22] now verse 1 we read this for our text
[12:24] verse one
[12:28] i'm getting i want to get to reward so
[12:30] brother again brother william's been
[12:31] inspiring me a lot lately but
[12:33] uh last sunday when i was driving to get
[12:36] the chipotle
[12:37] he was commenting on our sermon the
[12:39] sermon i preached last sunday
[12:41] and he says that was a beautiful thought
[12:43] about how joshua possessed all the
[12:45] promises
[12:46] but everybody else had a work to do he
[12:47] said brother branham had a ministry but
[12:49] we have a ministry too you remember that
[12:51] brother
[12:52] i thought beautiful thought i never even
[12:54] thought about it like that
[12:56] uh i thought wow that's right the
[12:58] prophet went in first and he did
[13:00] everything
[13:00] but then there was he died joshua died
[13:03] but then there were still believers that
[13:05] needed to possess
[13:06] their their inheritance praise god
[13:09] so the prophet was faithful with his he
[13:11] did everything he was supposed to do
[13:12] right the holy spirit said a huge
[13:14] portion of heaven awaits you
[13:17] right because you've chosen the harder
[13:19] way the narrow way you've chosen my way
[13:23] so a huge portion of heaven awaits him
[13:24] but joshua died
[13:26] and so now the other tribes have to
[13:28] learn to lean on the lord like joshua
[13:32] they have the same faith as joshua right
[13:34] and know that god's with them the same
[13:36] god that was with joshua is with us
[13:38] today
[13:39] amen the god of brother burnham is here
[13:41] today praise god
[13:43] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[13:45] forever
[13:46] and church that that's that's the great
[13:48] revelation like
[13:50] that's the great revelation is jesus
[13:52] christ is the same yesterday
[13:53] today and forever praise god so in other
[13:56] words we got to recognize christ today
[13:58] and see how christ is dealing with us
[14:00] today right and
[14:01] receive his help today receive his
[14:04] strength right
[14:05] and then overcome today hallelujah right
[14:08] because we know what happened in the
[14:09] past
[14:09] we don't know what's going to happen in
[14:10] the future but one thing we can do is
[14:12] overcome today
[14:14] hallelujah so verse one
[14:18] this this it's it's a funny kind of
[14:19] verse to me
[14:21] so joshua's old and stricken stricken
[14:23] means like you're
[14:24] uh you're just kind of uh
[14:28] you're given to it but it's it's not
[14:29] like a good thing it kind of looks like
[14:31] a bad thing right
[14:32] and so then the lord the lord tells josh
[14:34] joshua you're old and stricken in years
[14:37] so it's kind of like you're you're
[14:38] you're burdened with all these uh
[14:40] all the hard parts are getting old right
[14:42] you're burdened with being old
[14:44] and there remaineth yet much land to be
[14:46] possessed verse two
[14:47] this is the land that yet remaineth all
[14:50] the borders of the philistines and of
[14:52] jeshura
[14:53] from sihor which is before egypt even
[14:55] unto the borders of accra northward
[14:57] which is counted
[14:58] to the canaanite and so forth so god
[15:00] shows joshua all these boundaries
[15:02] okay philistines here canaanites here
[15:04] i'm just kind of you know throwing them
[15:06] out there
[15:07] right so joshua kept
[15:10] all the commandments god to him but god
[15:13] told him there's so much more
[15:15] people need to do praise god amen
[15:18] just like revelation 10 eat the book and
[15:21] go prophesy before many nations
[15:23] peoples kindreds take it right it's got
[15:26] to be taken around the world praise god
[15:28] so see
[15:29] the the first preacher does his work but
[15:31] then the rest of us must do our job as
[15:33] well
[15:34] amen see very much land remain to be
[15:37] possessed
[15:38] but joshua did all of it so here back to
[15:41] verse
[15:42] 23 of chapter 11. this is where i got my
[15:44] title joshua took the whole land see
[15:47] taking the land taking the whole land
[15:50] see according to all that the lord had
[15:52] said unto moses and joshua gave it for
[15:54] inheritance unto israel according to
[15:55] their divisions by the tribes and the
[15:56] land rested from war
[15:58] so see church that's the beautiful thing
[16:00] we don't have to do everything but we
[16:02] got to do what god has called us to do
[16:05] right and it really opened up to me
[16:07] yesterday i
[16:08] this just was a fresh revelation the
[16:10] remainder of these chapters deal with
[16:12] like all the borders and
[16:14] and where everybody it defines all their
[16:16] limits and their borders i thought my
[16:18] isn't that it wasn't an easy thing like
[16:20] it was a very detailed because there's
[16:22] mountains there's valleys
[16:24] there's hills and i thought wow that's
[16:26] just like the new testament
[16:28] how god will define he'll define a
[16:30] pastor is a little different than an
[16:32] evangelist
[16:34] an event just a little different from a
[16:36] song leader
[16:38] say like that and the gift of faith is a
[16:41] little different than the anointing of
[16:42] faith
[16:43] right it's all these details but they're
[16:46] so important
[16:47] so you know exactly where you stand with
[16:49] god amen
[16:50] like a deacon has a special his
[16:53] qualifications are a little different
[16:55] right
[16:55] it's unique it's not like just a simple
[16:58] cookie cut for everybody somebody
[17:01] preaching on that coming up by god's
[17:02] grace
[17:04] you know mothers have a certain role but
[17:06] then church mother
[17:07] [Music]
[17:08] mother can teach younger mothers right
[17:12] her younger mothers could go sister
[17:14] beatrice and ask her questions i hate to
[17:16] call her out
[17:17] we love mr beatrice if our if our young
[17:19] mothers you know
[17:20] uh if they have questions the bible said
[17:23] the elderly sister
[17:25] teach the younger sisters that doesn't
[17:28] seem like a cookie cutter well women
[17:29] shouldn't preach and women should
[17:31] but that doesn't mean another woman
[17:32] can't teach another woman
[17:34] not not behind the pulpit but just in
[17:35] fellowship right
[17:38] but it's so specific it's so unique and
[17:41] all of these
[17:42] borders were so unique it wasn't a
[17:44] simple cookie cutter
[17:46] one fits all kind of thing right it was
[17:48] all unique
[17:49] but joshua did everything god called him
[17:52] to do in church that's what we
[17:53] you you and i can't answer for anybody
[17:55] else but one thing we can do is lord
[17:57] help me to do all that you want me to do
[18:04] right we are let me tell you like this
[18:05] we're one church
[18:07] we're one tiny church with uh just a
[18:09] handful of tithe players which we're all
[18:11] grateful for
[18:12] we can't change the world necessarily
[18:14] but we can do great things where god has
[18:16] called us to do it
[18:18] we cannot build like physical churches
[18:20] like we can't write a check for a 50 000
[18:23] and go build a church in south africa or
[18:24] something like that or
[18:25] you know wherever they need it you know
[18:27] london or whatever
[18:28] we can't do that but we can do what god
[18:31] has called us to do
[18:33] and a big church can't do what we can do
[18:37] praise god now what that is is to be
[18:40] revealed by the holy ghost
[18:42] like we're talking about going to
[18:43] denominational churches and trying to be
[18:44] a witness well the big churches won't do
[18:46] that
[18:47] right they've got bigger things to do
[18:50] well we've got
[18:50] things to do too now to us they're big
[18:53] right we want
[18:54] we want to possess our land that's
[18:55] important to us praise god
[18:58] so we must recognize we must find out
[19:00] what god has called us to
[19:02] and then we must ask god to give us
[19:04] grace to do it
[19:05] because you're going to see that with
[19:06] caleb too they knew what god was called
[19:09] them to do
[19:09] but then they had to ask for certain
[19:11] things too in other words we got to ask
[19:13] god for wisdom
[19:15] praise god amen all right so yeah now
[19:18] this isn't very good can i zoom in on
[19:22] this
[19:24] yeah sorry that bummer uh
[19:27] yeah i can't zoom into that but anyways
[19:29] here's jordan here's jordan
[19:31] uh there's shiloh where's someone's
[19:33] we've been preaching on
[19:35] they didn't put them on here oh there's
[19:36] ai okay yeah there's a and gibeon okay
[19:38] there's jericho okay
[19:40] so joshua was basically told to get all
[19:42] this red right now
[19:43] is this interesting joshua got about a
[19:46] third of the land
[19:49] it looks like maybe a third i thought
[19:51] that's interesting kind of reminds me of
[19:53] the three parts of man
[19:55] like god gave us billy oh we have total
[19:58] victory in the song
[19:59] but the message we gotta fight for
[20:03] i don't know that was i thought that was
[20:05] kind of funny
[20:06] it just looks like a third to me right
[20:08] okay so syria they didn't get all syria
[20:10] galilee other parts here
[20:12] philistines we remember that right
[20:13] remember that in our text right
[20:16] so remember god told joshua you have a
[20:18] lot more to go
[20:20] as far as the people you've done all you
[20:22] had to do but
[20:23] there's a lot more land left to be taken
[20:25] look there's a lot more victories to be
[20:27] won
[20:28] so see church when we get the holy ghost
[20:30] you would think oh it's all done
[20:31] it's all finished no there's a lot to do
[20:33] praise god there's a lot of old habits
[20:36] to clean out amen
[20:37] there's a lot of thinking you've got to
[20:39] be removed from your thinking right
[20:41] there's a lot there's a lot more things
[20:43] i can review to you
[20:44] if you'll keep fighting the good fight
[20:46] of faith
[20:48] see a lot of people though don't want to
[20:49] fight right
[20:51] they don't want to fight they don't want
[20:52] to keep pressing in and and hungering
[20:54] and thirsting for righteousness
[20:56] like they want to denominate right we've
[20:57] seen people denominate like
[20:59] people that bend the message so they can
[21:00] dominate after a year they can
[21:01] denominate after five years they can
[21:03] denominate after 10 years and say this
[21:04] is all god's going to reveal
[21:06] nothing else church god forbid we should
[21:08] ever do that may we have an
[21:09] open heart and say god keep revealing
[21:11] more of yourself to us
[21:12] you're an eternal being there must be
[21:14] more revelation for
[21:16] us amen see we can never denominate and
[21:20] become a message denomination
[21:22] because we'll die right there
[21:26] that's why we've got to keep praying for
[21:27] souls to be born like our young children
[21:28] they've got to have the baptism of the
[21:29] holy ghost
[21:30] mj's got to get it right remember when
[21:32] you guys got it that was glorious time
[21:34] and we got to keep labor until everybody
[21:36] gets that amen
[21:38] see a church that's not bringing forth
[21:40] is dying amen
[21:41] so we have to constantly have those acts
[21:43] 2 38 youngins amen
[21:48] the first uh the belief back on the day
[21:50] of pentecost amen
[21:53] see we're always going to be uh i always
[21:54] got a father leading a hold up back to
[21:56] the baptism of the holy ghost
[21:59] right because we've got to constantly be
[22:01] bringing forth
[22:02] it never gets old remember when can
[22:03] preacher last year wouldn't preach on
[22:04] the holy s and
[22:06] the pomegranates it felt like a brand
[22:08] new sermon yet we've heard sermon after
[22:10] sermon on the holy ghost right
[22:11] you would think it would just get oh but
[22:13] it never gets old
[22:14] it's always fresh because it's eternal
[22:17] praise god
[22:17] it's the presence of god and never you
[22:19] can never get used to it
[22:21] amen you can brother i say you can never
[22:24] get used to it's too holy
[22:26] it's too sacred praise god it's always
[22:28] just that uh
[22:29] shekinah glory of god that holiness of
[22:32] jesus christ oh
[22:33] it's heaven to us
[22:38] that's why i don't matter that's the
[22:39] thing just don't get it don't don't get
[22:41] discouraged
[22:41] just keep coming one of these days is
[22:43] gonna be your days
[22:45] it's gonna be your day praise god it's
[22:46] gonna be the day of your prayers
[22:48] answered praise god
[22:51] now i brought this out now a few years
[22:54] ago four years ago
[22:55] i preached on the types of the seven
[22:57] heathens
[22:58] joshua drove out and i used
[23:02] i understood the types because i used
[23:04] their hebrew definitions
[23:05] or their occupations so remember god
[23:08] told joshua here's the seven canaanites
[23:10] hittites hivites perizzites gergescites
[23:14] amorites and jebusites so i don't hear
[23:16] you weren't here brother uh
[23:17] william when i preached this a while
[23:18] back but i'm going to just bring it real
[23:20] briefly
[23:22] i started studying the names of these uh
[23:26] peoples and i was really shocked i'm
[23:28] like these sound like battles i'm
[23:30] fighting
[23:31] so for example canaanite the word
[23:34] canaanite means a traitor or
[23:36] merchant and that made me think of the
[23:37] love of money so when we get in the
[23:39] promised land
[23:40] we got to drive out the merchant right
[23:43] the
[23:43] the love of money right brother brahms
[23:46] said remember brother bam said out of
[23:48] women popularity money his greatest
[23:50] battle was money so he said that's why i
[23:53] won't call an offering that's why i'll
[23:55] only take a hundred dollars a month
[23:57] right as a as a church pastor
[24:00] housing allowance they call it
[24:04] and brother look i looked up hittites
[24:06] hittite means a son of hef and hath
[24:08] means terror
[24:09] a son of fear i thought i battle fear
[24:12] all the time i just showed you how paul
[24:13] battled fears
[24:15] he was a holy ghost-filled saint i
[24:17] thought what a beautiful type now i'm
[24:19] not saying this is i'll say the lord
[24:21] but it's really spiritual even though
[24:23] you're born again you're still gonna
[24:25] have to battle money
[24:26] right still gotta battle the love of
[24:28] money don't love it
[24:30] love god right but if you're rich in
[24:32] this world
[24:33] make sure you're always ready to give to
[24:35] people and that should be most of us
[24:38] most of us if we have a little bit of
[24:39] savings in the bank account we're rich
[24:41] and so we must always be ready to give
[24:44] to those that need it
[24:45] not everything they want just give them
[24:47] a little bit right like don't give up
[24:49] all your money right then you can't feed
[24:50] your kids and everything
[24:51] but give them a little bit so
[24:54] hivites now this one had to use their
[24:58] bible definition
[25:00] not not the group not the hebrew word
[25:02] okay so hivites are like compromising
[25:03] with the world because
[25:04] most of the hivites were gibeonites and
[25:08] joshua made the league with the gibby
[25:09] knights
[25:11] so in other words that should have
[25:12] taught him don't compromise in the
[25:13] promised land
[25:15] so in other words we're about a
[25:18] compromise to speak with the world
[25:22] well it's okay just to do a little bit
[25:23] of willingness
[25:25] it's okay to have a little bit of world
[25:26] leaders in life no don't make any league
[25:28] with it
[25:29] don't make any don't make any promises
[25:31] all right hallelujah
[25:33] so see that's when we battle
[25:34] compromising
[25:36] parasites the parasites were former so i
[25:38] had to take that earthy
[25:40] and the bible says we were earthy right
[25:42] so earthy means you're carnal so this
[25:43] one i had to use this one's kind of a
[25:45] stretch right
[25:46] but uh farmers earth you know land
[25:49] earthy
[25:50] carnal so i just thought that was maybe
[25:52] that's probably the hardest one that
[25:53] maybe doesn't really fit perizzites but
[25:55] this one's beautiful
[25:56] gurgashite means clay brother and in
[25:59] daniel 2 the iron and clay mix
[26:01] brother brahm said the iron was the
[26:03] catholic church and the clay was the
[26:04] protestant
[26:05] that means clay is denominational
[26:07] protestants
[26:08] and we have to battle denominational
[26:10] spirits do we not i'm sure you've seen
[26:12] it
[26:12] over the years people want to denominate
[26:15] on their revelation or denominate in
[26:16] their church and not fellowship with
[26:18] other people
[26:19] peter had the battle of that right with
[26:20] the the gentiles
[26:22] so see we gotta we gotta drive that out
[26:24] in the name of jesus
[26:26] how many how many believe it can be done
[26:28] amen
[26:29] all these all these god gave in to
[26:32] joshua's hand
[26:33] and joshua succeeded in driving them all
[26:36] out praise god
[26:37] not a one of these stood in joshua's way
[26:41] that's so beautiful amorites now amrit
[26:44] they were giant
[26:45] hill men so they lived up in the
[26:46] mountains right so this reminded me of
[26:48] giant
[26:49] battles right speak to the mountain
[26:50] it'll move
[26:52] so i just call this giant fleshly luster
[26:54] just just giant
[26:55] mountains you have to face in life right
[26:57] so the amorites represent mountains that
[26:58] have to be moved
[27:00] even though you're born again there's
[27:02] mountains in your life and you need to
[27:03] speak the word of god to the mountain
[27:05] and tell it to move amen praise god we
[27:08] all got to do it right we all got to
[27:09] speak
[27:09] like media's tumor meet his tumor was a
[27:12] mountain
[27:13] and the holy spirit said whatever you
[27:15] say it'll happen in other words
[27:17] speak to the mountain and the mountain
[27:19] will have to obey you and brother
[27:21] said before the doctor can touch it the
[27:23] two feet to the mountain
[27:24] it'll move now this last one is
[27:28] beautiful too yes
[27:29] this was to me jebusite means son of
[27:32] jabus
[27:33] which means a stronghold stronghold is a
[27:36] complex
[27:38] right and paul said paul said
[27:41] the word of god pulls down strongholds
[27:45] and what was brother ramsey's last
[27:46] battle before he went off the scene
[27:48] the complex of not loving the people
[27:51] remember his complex in uh standing in
[27:53] the gap
[27:55] the last battle he fought as far as
[27:57] spiritual battle now not not the
[27:59] not the squirrel that was a physical
[28:01] battle right the last spiritual battle
[28:02] he fought was the complex
[28:04] before he went off the scene he wanted
[28:06] to move up in the mountains with meda
[28:08] and just he said stomp down the mountain
[28:10] whenever he had thus saith the lord
[28:12] preach it and then walk back up he said
[28:14] because he said every year he goes back
[28:15] to the same churches
[28:16] they keep cutting their hair wearing
[28:18] makeup and the men keep compromising
[28:20] enjoying denominations he said it gets
[28:21] worse every year
[28:22] and he said if they don't want to hear
[28:24] me they don't have to hear me then
[28:25] that's just what the devil wanted but
[28:28] the holy spirit had to say
[28:30] he had to give him a vision and say if
[28:31] you do that you'll turn into a bum
[28:33] and media will leave you he said the
[28:35] angel said you're not an old testament
[28:37] prophet
[28:38] you have apostolic gifts
[28:41] in other words the new testament prophet
[28:43] doesn't run from the people
[28:44] he runs to the people praise god
[28:50] so see church now if i'm honest with
[28:52] myself and i'm sure william and all the
[28:54] brothers will be too
[28:55] we battle all these right we battle
[28:57] complexes
[28:58] fleshy lusts that are giant things
[29:00] denominational carnal
[29:02] compromising fear the love of money
[29:05] these are all things we battle and this
[29:07] was a great this was a great help to me
[29:08] a few years ago
[29:10] because i thought i'm in the promised
[29:11] land what here's what i'm fighting
[29:14] right all right
[29:17] there you go how do we do it we got to
[29:20] cast it in other words don't give out it
[29:22] right cast down any imagination exalts
[29:25] itself against the word of god
[29:27] bring that thought into captivity bring
[29:28] it into prison
[29:30] and lock it up right lock it up
[29:33] and the bible says revenge or
[29:35] disobedience in other words have a zeal
[29:37] this time i'm not going to disobey
[29:39] this time i'm going to be kind this time
[29:42] i'm not going to shut up my bowels of
[29:43] compassion
[29:44] my poor brother this time i'm going to
[29:45] help him out
[29:48] this time i'm not going to that spirit
[29:50] or lust this time i'm going to overcome
[29:52] by the grace of god
[29:53] see see that that's when we've really
[29:56] repented that's what happens now we have
[29:58] a zeal
[29:59] to do what's right next time praise the
[30:01] lord
[30:03] because we're fighters we're warriors
[30:04] we're new testament soldiers praise god
[30:07] we got the full armor of god on praise
[30:09] god now
[30:11] getting back to verse one now look
[30:12] joshua fulfilled all the will of god for
[30:15] his ministry like david and caleb
[30:17] now here we see the type of the three
[30:18] kinds of rewards and here's a fresh
[30:20] thought that came to me recently
[30:25] there's three levels of rewards for
[30:27] christians
[30:28] that are holy ghost filled and i'm going
[30:31] to show a chart on this in a minute
[30:32] 100 fold 60 fold 30-fold
[30:36] now look david even though he stumbled
[30:38] in that one spot with bathsheba and
[30:40] uriah the bible says
[30:41] he fulfilled all the other will of god
[30:45] now look at that can you imagine church
[30:47] like i said you're about ready to die
[30:49] but you can die
[30:50] with peace knowing i did everything god
[30:52] wanted me to do
[30:53] that would make me so happy right that
[30:56] would make
[30:56] that make you want to shout even though
[30:58] you're dying you'd want to shout and say
[31:00] thank god
[31:01] god help me do everything he called me
[31:02] to do i'm not in other words i'm not
[31:05] leaving anything undone
[31:07] like we saw last week josh didn't leave
[31:08] anything undone right
[31:11] what a peace david must have had in his
[31:13] heart lord i fulfilled all of it i got
[31:16] all these items stored up so the next
[31:18] generation can build the house of god he
[31:20] was living for the next generation
[31:22] praise god he was planting seeds for the
[31:25] next generation many of us are doing
[31:27] that right
[31:28] we're pouring into the next generation
[31:30] that's to come maybe we won't see the
[31:31] fulfillment
[31:32] of what we want to see but maybe the
[31:34] next generation will
[31:35] amen beautiful
[31:38] david fulfilled all the will of god for
[31:41] his generation
[31:47] and what was what was the will of god
[31:48] serving his generation
[31:50] church god's will for you and i will
[31:52] always be to serve one another how can i
[31:54] serve
[31:54] brother vang how can i serve by the amen
[31:56] and sister
[31:57] how can i serve the saints right
[32:01] your your will or god's will for your
[32:04] life
[32:04] your land is going to be service
[32:08] right not self-promotion i didn't say
[32:10] self-promotion i said service
[32:13] service who can i serve at the church
[32:18] right so he did
[32:21] all the serving of god just
[32:25] all serving that god won't do for his
[32:27] generation
[32:29] jesus said i didn't call me served he
[32:31] said but i give him a lot of cows make
[32:33] lords over each other you serve me
[32:34] used to me he said but with you it won't
[32:37] be so with real holy ghost
[32:39] the greatest among you will be the
[32:41] servants
[32:43] see see how much you can serve people
[32:45] you don't have to be with money don't
[32:47] have to do with books you don't want to
[32:48] be within
[32:48] it can be just with prayers what is
[32:51] really most important in this life
[32:52] church
[32:53] the longer we live the more the more we
[32:55] know the most important thing is our
[32:56] prayer life amen
[32:59] that's really the best way to serve
[33:01] people pray for them and then
[33:03] find a way to help them out praise god
[33:08] and look at joshua oh i'm sorry look at
[33:11] caleb
[33:11] caleb they say this about caleb like
[33:13] three or four times in the bible
[33:15] he's known as a man who wholly followed
[33:19] the lord god of israel that's how he's
[33:21] known
[33:22] you say caleb oh he's a strong he was a
[33:24] strong old man he stayed strong in his
[33:26] old age just as he was when he was
[33:27] younger
[33:28] and he did everything the lord do his
[33:31] whole heart was about following the lord
[33:33] how many want them to say that about you
[33:36] praise god jesse wholly followed the
[33:39] lord in all that the lord told them to
[33:40] do
[33:40] oh my that's what i want people to say
[33:43] but it's going to take sacrifice
[33:44] it's going to take some battles praise
[33:47] god it's going to take some fights with
[33:48] the sword of the word amen
[33:50] to wholly do the will of god for your
[33:52] life
[33:53] there are some beautiful thoughts that
[33:54] we're going to get to i think we had a
[33:56] couple more sermons on this
[33:57] this chapter this book rather there are
[33:59] some beautiful thoughts coming up i'm
[34:00] telling you just hold on
[34:01] there are some powerful thoughts like
[34:03] what i was sharing earlier about the the
[34:04] different qualifications in other words
[34:06] the land you and i are supposed to
[34:07] possess
[34:09] not everybody's land looks the same
[34:11] right
[34:12] it's not all the same but everybody has
[34:14] land
[34:16] and everybody has to overcome in that
[34:18] land
[34:19] and you've got to do it don't look to
[34:21] anybody else
[34:22] you look to do it you be the warrior you
[34:25] be the prayer warrior
[34:27] you be the fighter praise god
[34:32] it's wonderful brother amen saying about
[34:34] god is better and i had all these better
[34:35] scriptures in here
[34:37] samuel told saul to obey is better than
[34:40] sacrifice
[34:42] because rebellion is the same as
[34:44] witchcraft
[34:47] and because saul rejected the word lord
[34:49] god rejected him from being king
[34:52] so see saul rejected obeying
[34:56] david obeyed for the most part right
[34:58] other than a few things
[35:02] and look remember again we can possess
[35:05] all of our promises because
[35:06] paul said he finished his course
[35:10] in other words saul didn't saul didn't
[35:12] finish his course samuel said
[35:14] david is better than you saul
[35:17] look at that samuel said the lord hath
[35:19] read the kingdom of israel from this
[35:21] this day yet he was going to be king for
[35:22] many more years
[35:24] but samuel said god's already ripped it
[35:25] out of your hands even though you're
[35:26] going to be king for numerous more years
[35:29] and if given it to a neighbor of thine
[35:32] that is better than thou well i had a
[35:35] spell for the william the first time i
[35:36] preached i thought my
[35:37] hallelujah the holy ghost says i'm a
[35:39] better obeyer than denominations amen
[35:42] i'm not the one saying that god said
[35:44] that amen
[35:46] i'm better at obeying oh my
[35:49] they can smoke and drink and cuss and
[35:51] fornicate in adultery
[35:52] and do all that but god looks at our
[35:54] life and say you're better at obeying
[35:57] than those creeds hallelujah those
[35:58] churches with the mother harlot and the
[36:01] daughters
[36:02] god said i'm better i didn't say it
[36:06] i'm just repeating it church
[36:09] not a prideful way but you are better at
[36:12] obeying the voice of the lord than
[36:13] denominations let's thank the lord for
[36:16] that praise god
[36:18] hallelujah it's bible facts brother
[36:21] branham says
[36:23] david obeyed better than saul
[36:27] so god took down saul and raised up
[36:30] david
[36:30] god has taken down denominations
[36:32] hallelujah
[36:35] and he's raised up the bride like we
[36:36] felt this morning amen
[36:38] he's raised us up in heavenly places as
[36:41] the real queen of the earth
[36:44] the real bride of jesus christ the real
[36:46] kings and
[36:47] queens are kings and priests unto god on
[36:49] this earth
[36:51] oh hallelujah i said i showed on
[36:55] wednesday night remember wednesday night
[36:56] uh i cut it off so i'm sorry but i
[36:59] showed i preached on the trinity right
[37:01] how it's
[37:01] evil it's of satan and i showed how joe
[37:05] biden is a trinitarian he's also a liar
[37:08] he's also an adulterer he's also an
[37:11] idolater
[37:13] he's also a rapist he's all these things
[37:16] i said that is the
[37:17] that is the culmination of just
[37:19] accepting the trinity
[37:21] because the bible says like a little
[37:22] eleven and then it leavens the whole
[37:24] lump
[37:25] i said look look what a denomination
[37:27] produces it produces a liar like that
[37:30] but the holy ghost should produce the
[37:32] opposite
[37:33] someone who's filled not with leaven but
[37:35] someone who's filled with god
[37:36] amen someone who's filled with
[37:38] unleavened bread someone
[37:40] who's uh filled with sincerity and truth
[37:44] that's what it produces in our life
[37:47] right i said the same thing about trump
[37:48] he's an adulterer he sometimes he lies
[37:50] right sometimes he
[37:51] he cusses he's a curser he's a
[37:53] presbyterian
[37:54] so he believes in three persons he may
[37:56] be under the same condemnation i don't
[37:57] know it's between them and god
[38:00] but we have no excuse we've seen a
[38:02] prophet we've seen the son of man
[38:04] we've seen the last sign we've heard the
[38:06] word of god we have no excuse we should
[38:08] be overcomers amen
[38:10] we're better than that right right
[38:16] better resources better everything
[38:17] better preach get better everything
[38:19] because we obey the promises of god we
[38:21] obey the word of god
[38:23] we're not in the witchcraft we're into
[38:26] holy ghost power
[38:28] hallelujah that's right church
[38:33] so god said there's a kind that's better
[38:36] to fulfill all the will of god for their
[38:38] lives are better than those
[38:40] who just fulfill some of it
[38:44] in church we can all possess the
[38:45] promises because paul
[38:47] now i put the greek words in there he
[38:49] said i have fought a good
[38:50] which is an excellent or honest or
[38:52] magnificent fight
[38:54] i fought an honest fight i didn't cheat
[38:58] i fought a magnificent fight
[39:02] robbers right shipwrecked whips terrors
[39:05] false brethren i fought against all
[39:07] these things on the inside he's dying
[39:09] he's afraid you know he's asking for the
[39:11] fire of god to take over
[39:12] but yet on the outside he's using his
[39:14] words to fight against all these
[39:16] all these adversaries taking the land by
[39:18] the power of christ
[39:21] spiritual land amen
[39:24] hallelujah he said i fought an excellent
[39:27] fight
[39:28] i finished i fulfilled i've accomplished
[39:30] i've executed my course
[39:32] just like joshua i've done everything
[39:34] the lord called me to do
[39:36] everything he placed in there i've done
[39:38] it when he asked me to do this
[39:40] i went to ephesus done i went to colas
[39:42] done
[39:43] i went to thessalonica done i went to
[39:45] rome done
[39:46] he could cross off everything i've done
[39:48] the will of god
[39:49] and i know there's a crown of
[39:51] righteousness waiting for me praise god
[39:54] i've done everything he's called me to
[39:55] do i possess all the land
[39:57] amen i trust on my
[40:01] on my to-do list brother amen was write
[40:03] the modesty book
[40:05] write the 12 mysteries book i wonder
[40:06] what's next
[40:08] but i would do whatever the lord puts on
[40:10] my list i want to do that for the glory
[40:12] of god
[40:15] like i said if it just helps one person
[40:17] it was worth it because my mind was not
[40:19] in the things of the world
[40:21] it was meditating on the things of god
[40:27] he says i have kept i have attended to
[40:29] the faith i have
[40:30] guarded the faith i have observed the
[40:33] faith
[40:35] i finished the course henceforth there's
[40:38] a crown of righteousness
[40:39] which the lord the righteous judge will
[40:41] give me it that day not to be only but
[40:42] all those that
[40:44] love the rapture
[40:47] oh glory so see paul is saying the same
[40:50] thing joshua said
[40:52] joshua said i took the whole land
[40:54] because god gave it to me i kept
[40:56] everything moses told me do i did it
[40:58] everything the holy ghost told paul to
[41:00] do he did it everything the holy ghost
[41:02] has told us to do
[41:03] let's do it praise god
[41:06] now here's a fresh revelation that came
[41:08] to me
[41:09] this came to me while i was writing the
[41:11] next book about family
[41:15] now this is quite a chart so i don't
[41:17] want to overwhelm you but just bear with
[41:18] me here
[41:19] get your bibles ready would you church i
[41:22] found there are three levels of rewards
[41:26] for the wise virgins here's wise version
[41:28] one two three i'm foolish here's f so
[41:30] here's foolish
[41:31] foolish legislation with no fruit
[41:35] and no real no no real reward in heaven
[41:37] and that's what ma'am says in the church
[41:39] book
[41:39] the foolish virgin doesn't inherit
[41:41] anything he said they're not the
[41:43] brethren
[41:44] he said they're just inheritors of
[41:45] eternal life
[41:48] that's the church age book
[41:51] so the first level of this reward is
[41:54] just really no reward other than eternal
[41:56] life
[41:57] now church look at this i have three i
[41:59] have three sections of scripture that
[42:01] say there's three levels of rewards
[42:04] now this is a fresh revelation to me i'm
[42:07] pretty sure only missionaries can reach
[42:09] this level brother william
[42:11] because jesus christ said so
[42:16] i think it's right there let's go let's
[42:18] go to mark 10.
[42:20] i'm pretty sure only missionaries like
[42:22] paul
[42:23] can reach that top level of reward
[42:29] because of what christ himself said
[42:32] mark 10 28. can somebody read that lydia
[42:34] malcolm get your bibles ready help me
[42:35] out here please
[42:36] mark 10 28.
[42:44] mark 10 28 malachi can you read 28
[42:47] 29 and 30. yeah 30. yeah 28 29 30.
[42:57] then please began to say unto him what
[42:59] we have left on and followed me
[43:01] when jesus answered and said verily i
[43:03] say unto you there is no man that has
[43:05] left
[43:05] house or brethren or sisters or father
[43:08] or mother or wife or children or land
[43:10] for my
[43:23] amen who gets 100 hundredfold the man
[43:26] that leaves his family in houses in
[43:28] other in order to preach the gospel
[43:31] go to uh lydia matthew 13 23. can you
[43:34] read that lydia matthew 13 23. now here
[43:36] we see the same thing
[43:37] now we're going to hear the jesus says
[43:39] there's a hundredfold there's a 60 fold
[43:41] there's a 30 fold
[43:46] so lydia matthew 13 23.
[43:59] and the church dead this was beautiful
[44:02] to me
[44:03] now we know that their what levels are
[44:05] going to look like in heaven
[44:08] there's going to be some notice some get
[44:10] a hundred fold
[44:11] those would be the missionaries these
[44:13] are these will be all brothers like the
[44:14] mission
[44:15] like the twelve discipline because
[44:16] they're giving the the they're giving
[44:18] the seats right next to jesus
[44:20] in revelation now here's where sisters
[44:23] and brothers i believe could do
[44:24] level the second and third levels
[44:28] they could do 60 or 30.
[44:31] right okay now go to uh john 15.
[44:37] john 15. let me show you these three
[44:39] levels again
[44:44] and we don't need to we don't we don't
[44:45] need to read the other ones but remember
[44:46] jesus said some get five talents
[44:48] some get two some get one right three
[44:51] why are there three levels because three
[44:54] is perfection
[44:56] right i mean it's a it's a perfect
[44:58] design
[44:59] whenever you design something you put
[45:01] three parts to it right
[45:02] father son holy ghost uh blood water
[45:05] spirit right
[45:07] there's always no water yeah the three
[45:10] phases of the earth goes through there's
[45:11] always three faith hope and charity like
[45:12] there's always three
[45:13] three is the perfect way to design
[45:15] something so god designs rewards on
[45:18] three levels
[45:19] missionaries get the highest reward and
[45:21] then brothers sisters
[45:22] if they're faithful with their gifts
[45:24] would be in here
[45:26] with three and two i'm sorry levels
[45:29] three and two
[45:30] so yeah john 15 here and i have verses
[45:35] 2 and 5.
[45:39] john 15 2 and 5.
[45:42] now keep joshua in mind why am i sharing
[45:44] this because joshua did it
[45:45] all joshua conquered all so
[45:49] what level joshua would have got he
[45:50] would have got the highest reward
[45:52] right but a little bit last week with
[45:57] and gaza there's some people that some
[46:00] tribes that drove out a lot
[46:02] but they didn't drive out everything
[46:06] and see that's how we have with rewards
[46:07] some people will drive out everything
[46:09] get the complete victory other people
[46:11] will drive out a lot they'll get a good
[46:13] they'll get a good reward but not the
[46:14] highest reward
[46:17] all right john 15 2 every branch in me
[46:20] that beareth not fruit he taketh away
[46:22] and every branch that bear fruit he
[46:24] purges it that it may bring forth
[46:26] more fruit okay so in verse two you have
[46:28] fruit
[46:29] right and then you have more fruit in
[46:31] verse five
[46:32] i am the vine you are the branches he
[46:34] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[46:35] bringeth forth much fruit
[46:37] for without me you can do nothing so in
[46:40] verse
[46:41] 2 you have fruit then you have more
[46:42] fruit and then you have much fruit
[46:45] hallelujah i mean church i'm just
[46:48] reading the scripture and this is what
[46:49] comes to me
[46:50] nobody taught me this it just came to me
[46:54] okay and then all these scriptures now
[46:57] here's the next one this this may be
[46:58] clear right this may be a little bit
[47:00] easier
[47:00] so these yellow ones are wise virgin and
[47:02] this is foolish virgin
[47:04] the wise highest reward hundred fold
[47:06] much fruit five talents
[47:07] they turn five tenths into ten the
[47:09] middle reward to sixty-four more fruit
[47:11] two talents into four and the smallest
[47:14] reward for the wise version thirty-fold
[47:16] you have fruit and you turn one talent
[47:18] into two now
[47:18] i'm probably right there i probably got
[47:20] one talent but i'm gonna be faithful
[47:22] with that one talent praise god
[47:23] i'm gonna preach my heart out brother
[47:25] until my vocal cords just snap or
[47:27] something like that i'm gonna i'm gonna
[47:28] write everything i can do teach
[47:29] everybody i can teach preach i'll
[47:31] pray for all the sick i can i'll give
[47:33] every i'll pour all myself into it and
[47:35] hope that i get a one-fold reward
[47:38] i hope i can double what god's given to
[47:40] me
[47:42] oh hallelujah after 15 years i hope i
[47:45] produce something for the kingdom of god
[47:48] hallelujah but church all these
[47:50] scriptures say
[47:52] people have salvation but no reward
[47:55] so let's read those go to first
[47:56] corinthians 3 8.
[47:59] now a little bit of this is review but
[48:01] is it help is it helpful to see that
[48:03] this was brand this was so fresh to me i
[48:05] like i gotta share this with the church
[48:07] i was just waiting for the right time
[48:09] and it seemed to tie out
[48:10] tie in right here with joshua because he
[48:12] possessed everything
[48:13] but other people didn't they didn't do
[48:16] as much right and here we see
[48:17] some people didn't have as much some
[48:19] people didn't do as much
[48:21] some people weren't as fruitful as
[48:22] others
[48:25] so we want to be fruitful
[48:30] now this is not on the topic church but
[48:31] i have scripture i can show how paul had
[48:33] almost
[48:34] all nine gifts of the holy spirit by
[48:36] history i can show paul had all
[48:38] give all five gifts of the fightful
[48:40] ministry brotherham said he was the
[48:42] first pastor in ephesus
[48:44] he's a prophet he foretold the rapture
[48:47] he's evangelist because he said let's go
[48:48] visit our brethren and see how they do
[48:50] let's go on that evangelistic circuit
[48:52] right he was a missionary an apostle and
[48:55] he was a teacher to the gentiles
[48:58] he had all five but there was a time in
[49:00] season for all the gifts
[49:02] so church that may be how you
[49:06] are like i told amen and bang i said god
[49:08] may call them to the pulpit someday
[49:10] you never know there's a time and season
[49:13] for all things god didn't deal with
[49:14] abraham's it was at 75.
[49:16] god didn't actually get a hold of moses
[49:18] until he was 80. i'm not talking about
[49:19] you brothers
[49:20] i'm preaching in 80 but i'm just saying
[49:22] like there's times and seasons
[49:24] where god needs a servant
[49:27] and he's look the bible said as i search
[49:29] the whole earth i need a servant i need
[49:30] a servant who will serve me who will
[49:31] call out against the evil simon showed
[49:32] that verse
[49:33] and so as long as he can find one man he
[49:35] can do something with that one man
[49:38] so in other words we want to be ready if
[49:39] he does call us
[49:41] because paul's ministry changed brother
[49:43] graham said you can't mix them but look
[49:45] paul had all five i just proved i can
[49:47] prove it to you by scripture
[49:49] so that means he wasn't mixing them he
[49:51] was one at a time pastor now
[49:52] other times he was a teacher other time
[49:55] he would sit under the pastors and just
[49:56] teach
[49:57] right he'd evangelize he'd prophesy
[50:01] so see church god see there's all these
[50:03] details there's all these unique details
[50:05] in the land
[50:07] amen praise god it's sad it's sad people
[50:10] don't have this understanding by the way
[50:12] because i
[50:12] i've asked pastors to come here and
[50:13] preach and they say brother man said you
[50:15] can't mix the ministries
[50:17] but look at paul he found a season to be
[50:20] a evangelist
[50:22] why can't a pastor find a season to be
[50:24] an evangelist just for like one week
[50:27] one week that's a short season right
[50:30] and then the brother was like all
[50:31] defeated like when i talked to him he
[50:33] was all he passed away last year but he
[50:35] was so defeated all the time like
[50:36] i'm the david and saul's person cute me
[50:38] all the time he just lived the defeat of
[50:40] life
[50:41] and i felt like he was like caught up
[50:42] into these denominational thoughts
[50:44] rather than seeing the beauty and the
[50:46] uniqueness of the christian land in the
[50:48] new testament
[50:51] let's not live a defeated life let's be
[50:53] more than conquerors in christ jesus
[50:57] so you gotta yes you have quotes but you
[50:58] gotta take other quotes yes you have
[51:00] quotes but you gotta take them back to
[51:01] the scripture see that
[51:06] i could take a whole sermon on paul's
[51:07] five gifts maybe i'll do that sometime
[51:09] you'll keep pulling it out of me that
[51:11] guy over there he's
[51:12] he'll say something i'll be like that
[51:14] was holy ghost right there brother
[51:19] okay first corinthians 3 8.
[51:22] now he that planted the he that water
[51:24] through one and every man should receive
[51:25] his
[51:26] own reward according to his own labor
[51:30] so see we've got labor for the people
[51:31] we've got to serve other people
[51:34] 14 if any man's work abide which he hath
[51:38] built upon he shall receive a reward if
[51:40] any man's work shall be burned he shall
[51:41] suffer
[51:42] lost he lost a reward but he himself
[51:44] shall be saved yet so as by fire
[51:47] so someone can have a big reward they
[51:48] build up but if if it isn't a real
[51:51] genuine act
[51:52] it can all be burnt and washed away like
[51:54] lot
[51:56] he had all those family members but see
[51:57] how his wife his reward of his wife was
[51:59] washed away
[52:01] part of our reward is inheriting our
[52:02] families
[52:04] how many children did a lot have died in
[52:06] there he had some at least son-in-laws
[52:08] die
[52:08] in sodom he lost it was purified by fire
[52:11] right
[52:12] it was proven by fire the fires that
[52:14] fell
[52:15] he lost some of his reward because he
[52:18] didn't live he should have lived
[52:19] separated like abraham
[52:20] he should remember the promised son
[52:23] but man said he forgot about isaac he
[52:26] forgot about jesus he forgot about the
[52:28] promised son the rapture praise god
[52:29] may god help us always remember the
[52:31] rapture
[52:33] the coming of the lord
[52:38] second john 1 8 please
[52:48] this is to me this is sweeter than the
[52:50] honey on the comb
[52:52] god's word god's word is so sweet to me
[52:56] oh my goodness i i feel like i
[52:58] understand it better and better all the
[52:59] time
[53:01] and it's not by just quotes quotes are
[53:03] good it's by scripture
[53:04] i have quotes for all these right i can
[53:06] pull a quote oh there's four crosses i
[53:08] can pull a quote for all these things
[53:10] the version losing their reward i can
[53:11] pull quotes that brother bram said they
[53:12] don't inherit anything but life
[53:14] i have quotes for all these but to see
[53:16] in scripture that's where it really gets
[53:18] rock solid
[53:19] that's where your foundation is really
[53:21] solid because now you've got
[53:23] the quotes are great but we've got to
[53:24] have a scripture to back it up
[53:27] ii john 1 8 look to yourselves that we
[53:31] lose not those
[53:32] things which we have wrought or
[53:36] labored for but that we receive a there
[53:39] it is
[53:40] full reward to get a full reward you got
[53:43] to be fully faithful
[53:45] you got to fulfill every promise of god
[53:47] that god has given to you not to other
[53:49] people
[53:49] just to you that's why it's so important
[53:52] to have a relationship with christ
[53:53] lord show me what to do next what's my
[53:55] ministry what am i supposed to do now
[53:57] this stage of my life
[53:58] what's my ministry help me to do it
[54:01] show me what i must do and i'll do it
[54:04] i'm glad i heard his call to start
[54:06] preaching at 23 praise god i accepted my
[54:08] ministry
[54:09] i've failed at times i made mistakes at
[54:11] times but god has kept me
[54:13] he strengthened me and i've accomplished
[54:15] what he's called me to do for these
[54:16] years
[54:17] god forbid that i preach not the gospel
[54:19] of jesus christ
[54:22] i've kept the faith
[54:28] now just for those people that despise
[54:30] doctrine look at verse 9.
[54:32] all these preachers say oh we have too
[54:33] much doctrine not enough power we got to
[54:35] have both
[54:37] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[54:39] in the doctrine of christ
[54:40] hath not god hallelujah so when i got
[54:44] the holy ghost i got right doctrine
[54:47] see they said they say well i'd rather
[54:49] have the right spirit than write
[54:50] doctrine well i can have both
[54:53] i can have god and the doctrine god god
[54:56] is the spirit
[54:57] and doctrine is the truth amen i worship
[54:59] in spirit and truth i can have both
[55:01] we can have both we can do it all praise
[55:03] god i don't have to choose one or the
[55:05] other can i have the right teaching or
[55:06] the power i can have both hallelujah
[55:08] amen it's a must exactly right look at
[55:10] the rest of the scripture
[55:12] uh he that yeah he that abideth not in
[55:15] the doctrine
[55:17] hath both i'm sorry he that abideth in
[55:20] the doctor christ had both yeah verse 10
[55:22] and if any of you and bring out this
[55:24] doctrine and receive him not in your
[55:25] house neither be
[55:26] with him godspeed for he that bit of him
[55:27] godspeed is a partaker of his evil deeds
[55:31] yeah verse 9 if you abide not you have
[55:33] not christ
[55:35] see that's a real wimpy excuse preachers
[55:38] will make
[55:39] because they don't want to study they
[55:41] just want to go back to their own
[55:42] quotes the sermons they preached 10
[55:44] years ago see i try not to do that to
[55:46] you guys
[55:47] well the bank should say amen on that
[55:48] one
[55:50] amen who has been here a while now too
[55:52] so i don't go back and get this
[55:53] now sometimes i'll pull little bits but
[55:55] i try to make it fresh
[55:56] i try to make it something fresh that
[55:58] god has shown me recently praise god
[56:01] and it builds on yes it's fresh man it
[56:04] builds on
[56:05] the revelation we've already heard
[56:07] because the bible said he brings out
[56:08] treasures new and old
[56:11] oh hallelujah thank god
[56:15] that's right it's an excuse many
[56:16] preachers use oh
[56:18] as long as i got the right spirit i
[56:20] don't have to study doctrine well the
[56:21] bible says if you got
[56:22] god you got the right doctor
[56:26] that makes me feel good praise god you
[56:29] know because you just want to have the
[56:30] word
[56:31] see they're trusting in quotes without
[56:33] taking the quote back to the word
[56:36] every quote we've got to take back to
[56:37] the word
[56:39] remember joseph is the one who says you
[56:41] don't have to take quotes back to the
[56:43] word he said even if they're lies he
[56:45] said i'll still believe that it's still
[56:46] thus saith the lord
[56:47] i'm sorry lies are not thus saith the
[56:48] lord god our god doesn't lie
[56:51] okay last one revelation 3 11. i'll try
[56:52] to close here i'm at uh
[56:54] i'm at 57 minutes so bless your hearts i
[56:56] think it'd be i didn't think it'd be an
[56:58] hour
[56:58] anyways revelation 3 11.
[57:03] brother brahm says these things church
[57:04] by the way i'm like when i read that you
[57:06] know
[57:06] how many years ago was that now 19 years
[57:08] ago i'm like how can the foolish virgin
[57:10] have no reward and look
[57:11] all these years later now i can see it
[57:13] it's in the bible
[57:15] it was there the whole time someone just
[57:17] had to go digging and find these
[57:18] scriptures
[57:19] so we just had to study the word reward
[57:22] amen
[57:23] somebody just had to do it but it's
[57:25] laying there the whole time in quote
[57:27] form
[57:27] we've got to go find it in the word form
[57:31] hallelujah thank god amen oh thank you
[57:35] jesus
[57:38] behold i come quickly hold fast that
[57:40] which thou has that no man
[57:43] take thy crown
[57:47] matthias took judas's crown
[57:51] right he forfeited the crown of an
[57:53] apostle can you imagine that
[57:55] judas no that's right there judas
[57:57] forfeited this
[57:59] for hell he gave up a hundredfold he
[58:03] gave up the highest reward in heaven
[58:05] brother william
[58:05] for 30 pieces of silver
[58:09] how wicked and how shallow that is
[58:14] because the apostle the bible says first
[58:15] the apostle then the prophets and i have
[58:17] quotes
[58:18] brother brahm said the apostle is higher
[58:19] than a prophet i have quotes on that
[58:22] he said that the bible says that
[58:25] an apostle is higher than a prophet but
[58:28] see you start preaching that people say
[58:30] oh he don't believe the message not your
[58:32] version of the message but i believe
[58:33] this message right here
[58:35] that's the same one brother and pointed
[58:36] to you just don't believe it
[58:40] see someone can take your crown if you
[58:42] don't fight and win if you don't become
[58:44] a king in your life somebody will come
[58:45] and take it
[58:47] so may god help us to be kings and
[58:49] priests unto god
[58:55] all right now hopefully that's enough
[58:57] okay now
[58:58] now church salvation is a free gift
[59:03] you don't do anything for salvation
[59:05] except
[59:06] repent and believe that's all you do
[59:08] it's a free gift
[59:09] all these verses say it's a free gift
[59:11] but the same man who says it's a free
[59:13] gift
[59:14] say but rewards are earned by works
[59:19] he says salvation is a free gift but
[59:21] then he says you'll be
[59:22] judged by your works
[59:26] praise god we're not judged are you
[59:28] going to heaven or hell you're going to
[59:30] heaven church
[59:31] but you're judged by what did you do
[59:34] during the time you were working in my
[59:35] vineyard brother amen
[59:37] obama said he's going to ask all of us
[59:39] that brother vang what'd you do while
[59:40] you're working in my vineyard
[59:42] can you imagine that i'm going to stand
[59:43] there brother jesse
[59:46] son what did you do while you were
[59:47] working in the vineyard all those years
[59:49] in akron what did you do
[59:50] lord here's what i did you won't be able
[59:54] to lie right we won't be able to
[59:55] we won't lie or nothing we got to tell
[59:56] the truth there's no line of that holy
[59:59] presence right there
[1:00:01] there's my hour but church if you want
[1:00:03] me to preach a whole sermon on that i
[1:00:04] can later
[1:00:06] just so you can see it now peter had the
[1:00:09] keys to the kingdom
[1:00:11] he said we're all judged by works
[1:00:14] see at the judgment seat of christ
[1:00:17] not for salvation we're all salvation's
[1:00:19] a free gift
[1:00:21] but we're all judged later and say son i
[1:00:23] saved you by grace now what did you do
[1:00:24] how did you show your appreciation for
[1:00:26] my gift oh jesus i gave everything i
[1:00:29] could to you
[1:00:30] i i tried to do everything i could i was
[1:00:32] so faithful to the house of god i tried
[1:00:34] to pray for my
[1:00:35] my saints my brothers and sisters in
[1:00:37] christ i tried to i did everything i
[1:00:38] could to help them out
[1:00:40] that's what i want to say praise god
[1:00:44] peter says as obedient children be holy
[1:00:47] i'm holy
[1:00:48] he says if you call on the father who
[1:00:50] without respect a person's judge
[1:00:51] according every man's work
[1:00:55] a holy ghost-filled preacher who has the
[1:00:58] keys of the kingdom said the
[1:00:59] the king of the kingdom is going to
[1:01:00] judge every man by his works
[1:01:03] every man
[1:01:08] oh yeah right there he said pass your
[1:01:10] time in fear not in frolick
[1:01:14] fear the lord while you're on this earth
[1:01:16] so you do the right works
[1:01:19] peter keeps going he says being born
[1:01:20] again yeah purifying your souls be born
[1:01:23] again i'm going to skip past that
[1:01:25] in other words this born-again
[1:01:26] experience produces a fruitful life as
[1:01:28] you labor for the master
[1:01:31] now look what paul says we shall all
[1:01:33] everybody say oh
[1:01:35] stand before the judgment seat of christ
[1:01:41] every knee shall bow then every
[1:01:43] everybody say every
[1:01:45] one of us shall give an account of
[1:01:46] himself to god
[1:01:51] brother jesse i'll let you be a pastor
[1:01:52] there now at this point 15 years what
[1:01:54] did you do in those 15 years did you
[1:01:55] preach the truth to them or not
[1:01:57] did you baptize them the right way did
[1:01:59] you pray for them to get the holy ghost
[1:02:00] so yeah
[1:02:02] i can say amen yes lord yes lord i did
[1:02:05] not compromise
[1:02:06] on this word i tried to rightly divide
[1:02:08] the word of truth praise god amen
[1:02:11] i tried to fulfill every promise
[1:02:15] that the bible gave to me
[1:02:22] now i'm going to skip past this but the
[1:02:24] bible says there's something with the
[1:02:25] the preachers where they must give an
[1:02:26] account for their
[1:02:27] shepherds i'm sorry for their flocks the
[1:02:29] shepherds must give account for the
[1:02:31] flocks
[1:02:32] there's something about that in hebrews
[1:02:33] 13 17. so you have to answer
[1:02:35] individually but then a pastor also has
[1:02:37] to answer
[1:02:39] how did he did he walk over the souls of
[1:02:40] the saints
[1:02:43] like i said the greatest thing i can see
[1:02:44] with watching your souls make sure you
[1:02:46] go to church
[1:02:48] if you come to church you're likely your
[1:02:49] soul's going to be in good condition in
[1:02:51] most cases
[1:02:53] right by urge and beg people come to
[1:02:56] church
[1:02:56] come back to church because you can't be
[1:02:59] separated from the body of christ and
[1:03:00] serve christ and love
[1:03:02] christ you're not you only love christ
[1:03:04] as you love his people
[1:03:08] now look revelation 22 this is the white
[1:03:10] throne judgment 20 verse 12
[1:03:12] said the the dead were judged by the
[1:03:14] things written in the books
[1:03:15] according to their works
[1:03:18] so see no matter whether you're a sinner
[1:03:20] or a saint everybody at one point has to
[1:03:22] stand before christ
[1:03:23] and be judged by what they did after
[1:03:26] they received the grace of salvation
[1:03:29] the gift of salvation now sinners of
[1:03:30] course won't have either but they still
[1:03:32] got to be judged by their works
[1:03:34] but even though we have free gift of
[1:03:35] salvation jesus wants you
[1:03:38] to invest in the talents he's given you
[1:03:40] he wants you to possess the promised
[1:03:42] land that he's given you and you're
[1:03:44] gonna have to answer for how you did it
[1:03:47] praise god
[1:03:51] last verse i'm sorry i'm going the wrong
[1:03:54] way last verse
[1:03:55] peter says the time has come judgment
[1:03:57] must begin at the house of god
[1:04:00] and if at first begin to us what shall
[1:04:02] be the end of them that obey not the
[1:04:04] gospel
[1:04:05] so that shows you don't obey god
[1:04:09] now look and if the righteous now
[1:04:10] righteous is a lot because remember
[1:04:11] there's four kinds of believers holy
[1:04:12] righteous
[1:04:13] unjust and filthy and if the in other
[1:04:15] words if the
[1:04:17] foolish virgins scarcely be saved where
[1:04:19] should the ungodly and the sinner appear
[1:04:25] so see the fact you're coming to church
[1:04:26] is a good sign
[1:04:28] right you're you're being judged now so
[1:04:30] there's no judgment of wrath later
[1:04:33] praise god that's the end of our feet
[1:04:35] praise god i better stop right there
[1:04:37] perfectly that's one hour and
[1:04:39] about five minutes
[1:04:44] musicians can come was that a blessing
[1:04:45] by god's grace
[1:04:47] when william said that last week that
[1:04:48] just kind of sank in my soul like oh my
[1:04:50] i need to just bring that out at least
[1:04:52] one sermon
[1:04:55] let us strive church to be like joshua
[1:05:00] and david and caleb and paul
[1:05:04] all that the lord has called me to do i
[1:05:06] fulfilled it
[1:05:08] how many want that testimony tonight now
[1:05:11] let's pray and ask god let's express it
[1:05:13] to god with our lips okay
[1:05:15] let's say with our own lips
[1:05:20] because we want to be able to recognize
[1:05:22] lord what season of life and
[1:05:24] am i in right now and lord what do you
[1:05:26] want me to do right now
[1:05:29] and then lord give me the grace to do it
[1:05:32] amen hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:05:35] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[1:05:38] for this word tonight lord god
[1:05:40] lord i believe you showed us through
[1:05:41] jesus words
[1:05:44] through paul's teaching lord god that
[1:05:47] there's three levels of rewards for
[1:05:48] those of us who are born again
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] lord most of us aren't missionaries so
[1:05:54] lord
[1:05:56] we maybe wouldn't expect that hundred
[1:05:57] fold reward
[1:05:59] but lord we want to expect a reward
[1:06:01] because we want to be faithful in all
[1:06:03] that you call
[1:06:04] us to do
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:07] lord as we saw lord we want to be like
[1:06:09] joshua we want to be like caleb
[1:06:10] we'll be like paul and david we want to
[1:06:12] fulfill all your will for our lives
[1:06:15] so lord i pray right now in jesus name
[1:06:17] and we look at our lives
[1:06:18] lord show us the season of life we're in
[1:06:20] right now
[1:06:21] and show us lord what to do in this
[1:06:24] season dear god
[1:06:26] i can see through the testimonies you
[1:06:27] called me to teach before you were
[1:06:29] training me up lord god
[1:06:31] teaching me so i could teach others in
[1:06:33] the previous season
[1:06:36] lord show me the season now where we are
[1:06:38] lord i feel like i need to go to my
[1:06:40] denominational brethren
[1:06:43] i feel i need to go to those harlot
[1:06:45] churches and try to call out
[1:06:48] any predestinated souls in there so they
[1:06:51] have a chance to hear this message
[1:06:54] as your prophet said i feel i feel the
[1:06:56] burden of akron on my shoulders
[1:06:59] i know all the saints feel it too we
[1:07:01] want to impact this
[1:07:02] the city dear god and try to find some
[1:07:05] souls that want to be saved
[1:07:08] if the rights are scarce to be saved
[1:07:09] what about them that are outside the
[1:07:11] house of god
[1:07:15] so i pray by your grace lord speak to
[1:07:17] each one today
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:19] show them their season as brother mike
[1:07:21] mccloskey he's in the season he's
[1:07:23] trying to figure out his gifts may each
[1:07:25] one of us
[1:07:28] the season we're in what we're called to
[1:07:30] do
[1:07:31] whether it's teaching or divine healing
[1:07:34] lord god
[1:07:35] or dreams or visions or prophecies or
[1:07:38] god
[1:07:39] wisdom or knowledge miracles
[1:07:44] show us the giants we must conquer lord
[1:07:46] god and give us
[1:07:49] to take the word of god and take the
[1:07:51] whole land
[1:07:53] like joshua took the whole
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:08] right
[1:08:10] [Music]
[1:08:12] lord help us to survive for the pride
