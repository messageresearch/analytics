praise the Lord thank you Jesus what a beautiful wonderful powerful name amen praise the Lord Amen as we say let's take our Bibles this more this evening about the grace of Lord pardon me let's go to first Timothy chapter 2 I like to just start another little series on prayer by the grace of Lord so we'll have we'll have the series on wisdom and then we'll have a little series on prayer I've been feeling lead like I think I told you in December I like to do a series on prayer and just kind of waiting for the right time and I just feel like now would be a good time by the grace of Lord first Timothy chapter 2 verse 1 so about a title tonight I'd like to just call the realities of prayer first Timothy 2 chapter 1 a kind of me a little review I'm gonna reviews a lot of scriptures and I found some really nice new scriptures on prayers well I think there'll be a blessing to you first Timothy chapter 2 verse 1 or he'd versus 1 to 4 by God's grace from this text I just want you to see that Paul encourages Timothy to pray for every man of course every man and woman you know sometimes we wonder well do after I got to pray for somebody else and sometimes we just get overwhelmed but God does want us to do that God wants us to pray for every man and woman that we possibly can pray for that shows that there's power in prayer so let's read verses 1 to 4 let's all read verse 1 together and then I'll read 2 3 and 4 speaking on three one two three I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men now read verses two three and four for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth amen just want to encourage us with a little series on prayer such as power heads one more word of prayer for him you know in your heart just make a known unto God surely he's here tonight Heavenly Father Lord we love you we thank you for today we're coming off the Easter weekend Lord we're so grateful for the resurrection power and Lord how you've given us so many infallible proofs that you're alive and well Lord we know you're here tonight Lord God you promised to be with your people wherever they gathered Lord whenever they worship you promised to be with them and you said you never leave us or forsake us so we're grateful for your presence here tonight Lord God thank you for the worship Lord we can sing and glorify you it just stirs our hearts and take this time now as we pray Lord and bless this word to the Saints Lord God give us some encouragement about the reality of our prayer lives Lord that help us not to be overwhelmed Lord with so many prayer requests as we go through about our days and Lord our weeks and so forth but help us Lord to be encouraged Lord to know that you want us to constantly pray and offer up these requests Lord and you want this channel Lord this conversation between us and you to be constantly going so help us Lord here we pray and I just pray God your will would be done tonight bless every heart and soul meet every need in Jesus Christ powerful name and the Saints set Amen god bless yous being seated praise the Lord so let's just take a few moments here we'll look at these requests here I'm sorry look at these scriptures here tonight by the grace of Lord Mac I can switch over when you're ready I do want to update a few things here though give a few updates by the grace of Lord that's gonna be my picture there for the online I like that always like that picture of Jesus we have to look at the realities of prayer we read our text and then I just have a few updates about the church website just I just update a little bit this week and then by God's grace I got done three new videos for the website this week and also update you on the modesty book and then the post card outreach I just started that today by the grace of Lord but let me just show you the church website real quick we updated that a little bit so if you go to our website the first thing is our new videos of the high heels it's already got almost 500 views in just in a couple days but we have our announcements down there the guest ministers and everything coming up if you go to videos if you go to videos you'll see a picture of all the updated videos and they go right they go right to the YouTube except unless there's a series like The Book of Revelations so now we have the overview chapter 1 chapters 2 & 3 4 5 6 this week I there's a little space that I tried to fix that I couldn't fix it but anyways we finished 8 & 9 this week so we're up to chapter 8 9 for the the book of Revelation if you're if you're need of any teaching there by the grace of Lord so that's the website there oh and the three new videos those top three are the three new ones chapter 9 chapter 8 and then high heels in the Bible I had a few requests for high heels so that's why I made the video it's just a real short one it's only like six minutes long if but he's interested in that one is anyways oh in the modesty book I've kind of taken a break on that my wife and I were editing it but then the children got sick so it's just gonna be a slow process so I thought it'd be really fast but I guess editing takes a long time you know that shows how much I know about publishing you know many ways we're not even through chapter one yet but we did the introduction since the kids got sick and my wife had some work she had to do for her her website so anyways it just be a slow process but we're still going to try to do that and today I signed a little contract to do some postcard outreach we're gonna try to send 2,500 postcards to the Akron area so if you just think of that pray about neighborhoods or postal codes you want to send them to like I know a couple I want to send some of the Highlands Square up there in Akron there's a large population of homosexuals up there I like to send postcards to that area so if you know of any little pockets that you want to send we can we can send 500 to different pockets you know so they can divide up into five different groups so if you feel led you know maybe I don't know west Acker and east akron edith you know any pocket so we're gonna I'm gonna invest some missionary money into that and try to do a postcard outreach there and see if it'll draw any Saints you know I remember brother Branham said brother Graham said the responsibility this community is on our shoulders I don't know if you feel you feel that you feel that when you come to church sometimes you you feel that responsibility huh we just we need to try to get more people in Akron to come to Christ you know we got we got to do something with that responsibility and then brother Branham said in Beaumont Texas when Perry green and brothers were they were paying for hotels for people to come here brother Branham preached they were putting advertisements on the radio and the TV and brother branham said those people of whom the world was not worthy so and when we give of our own money you know we give our ties or offerings when we give our own money to try to get people to come in and hear the preaching the Bible said of whom the world is not worthy of us so if we can if we can do that with sincere it makes us real Christians by God's grace that's we want to be real Christians we want to be inviting them to hear the word if they can go to the website and whatever it would be whatever them whatever we have to do to try to get sole say we'd be happy to do that so just before we start this series I've been drawing inspiration from books on prayer by e/m bounds he was a preacher and he lived in the 1800s you know and he's a preacher an attorney and his books are free on e sword and eagle e swords free as well if you don't know that but I was at the Christian bookstore on Saturday night and they had some of his books they were like you know $18 a piece but they're free they're free honey sword if you download download sword on it could be on the iPad and so I just read them on my iPad I read the chapters there so they're really nice chapters on prayer so let me just set a timer here I'm gonna try to keep I don't want to go too late here tonight so let me just try to maybe preach 45 minutes or something like that I'll try to be mindful of the time so I want to just look at the realities of prayer some of these are going to be reviewed to us but then I've had some new scriptures here I've never really preached before on prayer and so like to preach them by the grace of the Lord let me turn to one I was just thinking of here now the first thing I want to just say is the reality of God God was seeking us first and then after he sought us out then he's calling us to seek Him so and I think you know I think if you look at this scripture here this will kind of help you understand what I'm talking about the Bible said there's none that understandeth there's none that seeketh after God and of course this is in the book of Romans chapter 3 especially where where Paul is you know giving the Romans Road in other words he's showing how both Jew and Gentile no man was worthy of salvation so God by His grace and His Son Jesus Christ to justify us through his blood and then he brings salvation so this is true that none of us seek God before we're saved none of us were seeking God huh me know that God was coming to seek after you praise the Lord amen and I want to balance this out because I want to I want to show the balance of the scripture before you're saved you and I were not seeking God but after we get saved Church then we have a responsibility to seek God how do we know that after God once calls you and you hear God call your voice you realize oh I was never seeking God God was seeking me but then at that point now you haven't you and I now all sinners and everybody everybody that he calls now everybody has a responsibility to seek God you have to see God after he's once called you and so that's what I want you to understand with this scripture this scripture shows that you know not all of us were wandering as scattered as sheep you know of course we know there's goats - that aren't say but the those of us who were saved we were sheep just scattered but the Shepherd came and called us and called us unto himself we were not seeking God God was seeking us Jesus says it quite plainly you are my friends if you do what s whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I made known unto you now notice this Jesus gave conditions he said if you keep my commands than you're my friends but then Jesus says you are my friends because they kept his commands right and notice Jesus so Jesus for knew them as friends of God he knew the eleven would keep the commandments remember and John 15 Judas wasn't there at that time Judas was not a friend of God how many know that he was a thief right he was not a friend of God he stole from God he betrayed God so this is saying Jesus saying that there's conditions you're my friends if you keep the word but Judas didn't keep the word but the eleven the word he said I'm gonna let you know you're my friends and you're the ones I would let you know what I'm doing praise the Lord and then write to this he says see you've not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you aren't you glad God chose you I did I wasn't going looking for God God came looking for me right I wasn't seeking God there's no man that sought God at the beginning God is the one who's drawing us us unto himself and he said he told the disciples that you would go forth and bear fruit and your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you ask the Father my name he may give it to you and then I you know of course we pulled out of fusions one Ford it's very familiar but powerful Scripture according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so you could say you know he could you know the devil could say Oh see he's just talking to the disciples here but Paul says to all the saints he's chosen all of us amen all of us that includes me praise the Lord all the saints us hallelujah now here's the example we're really familiar with where after God calls you now that he's called you now you've got the you and I have got to start seeking God back and if we don't then there's repercussions for that this is the reality of Prayer the reality is is that we never saw God to begin with but after God seeks us and finds us then we have the responsibility to see God then we have to make that decision with our free will remember God was saying thus saith the Lord after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say at the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then you shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you remember see they were out of the promised land they were in a Babylon they were in Satan's Babylon and I say like that you and I aren't Satan's Eden right they were out of the promised land but God said I'm gonna I'm gonna visit you after 70 years and you're gonna come out and you're gonna pray to me and the Bible said ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart see after God's called you after you first been called unto God now God's after that yes you didn't see God but after that now God something you know now you've got to seek Him you've got to make a freewill choice are you gonna continue to seek Him or not and God said if you seek me with all you have you'll find me say at the Lord I'll turn away your captivity I will gather you from all nations and from the palace the places whither I've driven you saith the Lord and I'll bring you again in the place whence I carry it caused you to be carried away captive now we see the same thing in proverbs chapter 1 so let's go to back to proverbs chapter 1 I don't have a slide for this because I just thought of it as I was preparing to preach here kind of in prayer I just reminded me of this proverbs 1 verse 20 the Bible says this wisdom crying without she utters her voice in the streets she cries in the chief place of concourse and the openings of the gates in the city she uttered her words saying how long these simple ones will you love simplicity and thus corners the light and their scorning and fools hate knowledge turn you at my reproof behold I'll pour out my spirit unto you I'll make no my words unto you now look at this verse 24 because I have called and ye have refused I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but you have said it not all my counsel and would none of my reproof look at verse this gets pretty serious look at verse 26 I will also laugh at your calamity wisdom is gonna laugh at those who turn down wisdom if they turn it down and forsake God so long God's gonna laugh at them that's what the scripture says I that's that's hard for us to imagine verse 27 when your fear cometh as theirs as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you then shall they call upon me but I will not answer you see that first call after you get that first call that's when you realize oh I never saw God but after that God wants you to seek Him but if they don't then God will let them choose their own path and then when the judgment comes after they've already crossed the line between judgment mercy then when they call God's not going to hear their prayer because they have a responsibility after you've once heard the call of God it's your responsibility the reality of it is God called you first now God after he calls you now he wants you to call on him that's right that's strike you look at verse 29 for they that hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they would none of my reproof I'm sorry none of my counsel they despise all my reproof therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices they're going to reap what they sowed for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but whoso hearken unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from the fear of evil amen what a promise praise the Lord so I want you to see that there that's the reality as we said that none of us seek God at first but afterwards the reality of it is we must choose to seek God we must crucify this flesh amen now there's the reality of God's desire for us to seek Him first so not only do we have to now start seeking Him but he wants us to seek him first now we know this Jesus said don't don't take thought saying what are we gonna eat what are we gonna drink what are we gonna wear what clothes we gonna put on he said don't worry about that for all these things the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knoweth the ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you how many can say Amen that you've experienced that in your life take that thought therefore no thought for tomorrow but worry about tomorrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof so god the reality of it is God wants to seek Him first and not worry about tomorrow just seek Him today and here's what we said this this was our text I exhort therefore first of all the very first exact sortation Paul is going to give to Timothy in this letter is that supplications which are individual a strong request those are individual strong requests that you make unto God like Daniel made supplication for his people Israel supplications prayers intercessions which is for other individuals and giving of thanks be made for all men and women for kings for all that in authority now we read that for our text notice the connection between prayer and the salvation of souls we have to pray for all that all might have a chance to receive the Word of God and remember Genesis 18 where Abraham goes before the Lord and he intercedes and he says Lord if there be fifty and Sodom will you spare and the Lord says yes forty yes thirty yes he said I'll spare it for ten so he was praying for all men he was praying for everyone in Sodom can you say amen to that he was praying for all men the homosexuals he was saying God please don't destroy the righteous with the wicked he's praying for the righteous to be saved and that some of them would come out and be saving and Paul gives us that same idea we need to pray for those in leadership in our government you know we need to pray for them we need to pray for all men the Bible says that's the reality of our responsibility of Prayer and we must remember the reality that God invited us to pray to him let's remember that reality jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy easy and my burden is light amen if we feel like the weight of the world is too heavy we got to come closer to Jesus because jesus promised his burden is light we just got to come that's that's that's the only thing we're invited come and not only that but now the Holy Spirit you say well that was Jesus when he was on the earth well I believe it applies to today too but I also believe God gives us more backup with the Holy Spirit here in revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that here say come and let him that is athirst say come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely how many could go for a good drink of spiritual water tonight anyway thirsty for some spiritual water the Bible said come come to Jesus come to the Holy Spirit and get a good drink of spiritual water amen hallelujah praise the Lord he's saying come he's not saying stay out no you're not good enough he's saying come unto me take a good spiritual drink in the presence of the Lord and that's done through prayer of course so people are thirsty you know they're they're spiritually thirsty or they don't feel like they've got the anointing of the Lord it's because they need to pray and it's whosoever see everybody anybody who's thirsty for more of God can have more of God amen so that's the reality that God has called us and invited us unto himself also there's the reality that God delights in our honest prayers I think I read this last week God loves honest prayer because the Bible said the sacrifice of the wicked and his abomination Lord but the prayer is of the upright is his delight amen remember the guy remember in the Jesus told the story of the Pharisee who is all I thank God I'm not like that dirty publican and I fast twice a week and I give alms of everything and Thais and I thank you that I'm not as filthy as that person but Jesus said the man who was received was the one who said be merciful to me a sinner praise God that prayer he was upright man he realized I made mistakes and Lord I need your mercy and I think that's many times that we just need to say Lord I need your mercy I've had a rough day I've had a rough morning I had a rough week Lord be merciful to me God will delight in that why because you're being honest you're being upright lord I made a mistake here I failed here Lord it was my fault there have mercy on me and when we come like that and say well at least I'm not a Baptist or at least I'm not a Jehovah's Witness at least I'm not a Mormon that's the wrong attitude the right attitude is to admit you're wrong and ask God for mercy and just start afresh walk in the light where there's no condemnation to them they're in the light and that's done through prayer the prayer of the upright God loves to hear an honest prayer remember Jesus we're not going to ovince my remember jesus said I you know when you pray don't give a nepotism not interested in in that you saying the same thing I want to hear the honest prayer from your heart that's what God is most interested in not the amount of words not the amount of repetition but he just wants an honest upright prayer from our hearts that's the reality God loves honest upright prayers and this is some I got a few new scriptures in here I wanted well I think one new scripture I want to share with you I think you'll be really blessed prayer let's look at the reality that prayer should stir you up I don't know but this happens every Wednesday when we pray and every Sunday and I find it a home to the more I pray it stirs me up for the rest of the service I don't know if you find that to be true in your life I hope you do but the Bible literally says prayer should stir you up if prayer doesn't stir you up you're not praying the right kind of prayer and the church said amen that's right prayer literally I'm gonna show you this next Scripture I've never preached this scripture before the reality is that prayer ought to get you stirred up thinking about God and then and if you pray the right way it does get God's attention so here's the scripture I've never preached it and look at this look as a ax 64 verse 6 but we are all as an unclean thing and our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we do all fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind has taken us away now look at this next scripture and there's none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee now remember these were already these people were already in the Covenant these were not sinners Isaiah was a prophet I think during the days of Josiah so they had already had David Solomon and on down in Hezekiah and here they are in the days of I believe Joseph I'm not worried Hezekiah if I'm not mistaken yeah it was Hezekiah and Jer and Isaiah says nobody in our nation is calling upon you nobody is stirring themselves up in prayer to take a hold on the promises of God oh praise the Lord for thou has hid thy face from us and has consumed us because of our iniquities see these are people got it already called but now they had failed to see God in prayer because of their sins isn't that powerful how many want to be stirred up for Jesus when here's what the Bible says you've got a your iniquities keep you from being stirred up if you're not stirred up and and really enthused about Christ and thankful for Christianity and the gospel it's because we're not stirring up ourselves and taking a hold upon the presence of God hey idea how about that for a prayer scripture I've never preached out'n before that's when you want to highlight underline I put stars in my Bible you went up gonna put a bookmark in there you like that one see they weren't calling on God and because they weren't calling on God they weren't stirred up their prayers were not making it past the ceiling tile will say like that because they were so condemned in their sins they were living in their iniquities and they were stirred up to pray that's right look at Jude 1:20 you know this I preached this numerous times but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost how many wants your spiritual character to be build up I don't want to you know I said like this with we're having some home construction they've built a lot but I don't want them to stop building I want them to finish what they're building I think I'd go downstairs and cry if they don't finish their building because it's like it's almost there it's it's getting built up to a place where you can actually live there you know it looks like it's you guys gets livable well that's what God wants to do in our lives but hid for us it's the statue of a perfect man it's built up with faith virtue knowledge and patience and temperance and godless and brother kindness and charity God wants to build us up but it comes through prayer in the Holy Spirit amen glory hallelujah oh brother Jess I don't feel like God's doing anything in my life for I don't feel like I'm us where I need to be spiritually where the Bible said if you need to be built up pray in the Holy Ghost amen keep yourselves and the love of God so you make sure you love your neighbor make sure love God make sure you love everybody looking for the mercy remember again that remember that that the sinner who beat us chest and say God have mercy on me a sinner say that's what we need to constantly say is Lord be merciful to me I'm building up my faith as I pray in the Holy Ghost amen look what brother Branham says children you ever see tar on the roads you ever see that black tar they place on the roads to fill up the cracks brother Branham said that's what prayer that's that's that's a type of prayer the next time you see tar out there think of prayer because the girls look brother Branham says you should or know what tar is you children do when they're fixing the street all that awful smell you ever smell that awful smell Oh dad mom close the windows that tar is so smelly oh that awful smell O'Keefe it shuts out all the cracks on the street and that's the way this does it shuts out all the water and that's what prayer does for the believer and that's what daily keeps the world out of you is when you pitch yourself on your knees and say Lord Jesus hallelujah ever feel like you got any cracks in your life and the storms are getting through and you feel like there's my life isn't where it should be save Jesus I'm coming to you in prayer put some spiritual tar in my life to keep the world out of my cracks hey filling my cracks with the power of the Holy Spirit amen brother have said and the blood comes down and it seals you all up so the devil can get you glory so that tar is black on the roads but the tar on us is blood-red amen glory thank you Jesus Satan the devil can't get you that's right so that Oh many times the people who are on say it's awful but they don't make any difference it keeps you safe that's the main thing keep safe say you're old-fashioned but that doesn't matter it keeps you safe Oh glory aren't you glad for the tar of the blood can I say like that that will seal Satan out it'll seal the world out and I'll keep you protected praise God it'll keep the potholes from coming in your life right we don't want potholes in our life on the way of holiness or the highway of holiness we don't want potholes on the way of holiness we want to keep Satan out how do you that brother jest well the Bible says through prayer prayer remember when you pray it grabs a hold of God remember God remembered Abraham and God sent lot out of Sodom that's how powerful Abraham's prayer was God remembered it God answered it in other words as we saw Abraham stirred himself up in prayer and kept praying for 15:40 30 and pretty soon he got so stirred up he got ahold of God and God said I won't destroy it for Ted and God said I will destroy the righteous with the wicked so I'll go down there and save lot because of your prayer Abraham let's let's see a stirred up like that so God we can get a hold of God's Word and God will hear our prayer and God will answer our prayer let's pray like that let's be enthused about prayer right let's get stirred up about prayer hallelujah that's right church man I remember Jacob when he was wrestling the angel he got so stirred up in brother Ram likens us on the prayer wrestling with God his prayer right we want the will of God to be done he got so stirred up he got ahold of God and said I'm not letting go till you bless me and we've got to pray and say God I'm holding on this promise I'm not gonna let go this promise until you answer it praise God Amen that's the is the reality of Isaiah 64 verse 6 there's nobody that's stirring themselves up and taking ahold of God we've got to stir ourselves up with prayer and take a hold on the promise of God amen in church we got to remember the reality of the nearness of God's presence when we pray when you pray sincerely God's presence comes to you it's a reality because the Bible said the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him that all that call upon him in truth we got to seek Him first remember he's gotta be the first thing we do in the day let's call upon the Lord he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him he will also hear their cry and we'll save them amen now if you got your Bibles let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 this is just a beautiful portion of Scripture we're probably familiar with but I'd say if we want if we want to pray more and brother man said we can never pray too much so I'm sure you and I all want to pray more tonight right this is one of the most beautiful scriptures describing how we can access heaven Hebrews 10:19 having there or brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say through his flesh and having an High Priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession there's that holding on to God right stir up yourselves and hold on to God ha ha glory of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke one another unto good works let me stop right there so there's the reality tonight when we pray if you and I were pranked sincerely we were supposed to go past this room and we were supposed to go to the holiest at the throne of Jesus Christ the Bible said it's a new and living way well brother Jesse I sinned well then you just confess your sin and then there's your heart sprinkled with an with the blood of Jesus right that's what's just what the Bible said you don't have an evil conscience anymore because you confess your sin and now when you pray you're not praying to the pulpit or you're not praying to the the TV screen or to me you are praying to Jesus in the holiest of Holies in heaven amen Oh glory and you got a holdfast onto that profession of faith this is a privilege so we'll get to that in just a moment but prayer is a privilege you and I have it is an absolute privilege it's a blessing that we can pray on to God because remember we read proverbs 1 there's going to be millions of people that God won't even hear their prayers God will laugh at their calamity the Bible says it's a privilege that we can be washed and clean and then we can approach God and God will actually turn his ear and say what was that sister Connie yes brother Jesse yes sister Kristen yes I heard your prayer other people he's not going to do that he's just going to turn his back because they didn't confess their iniquities but it's a privilege that God would hear our prayers it's the something we must not take lightly it's a new and living way the Jews right now cannot come boldly before the holiest of Holies they don't have a blood sacrifice to get there but we've got a blood sacrifice to get there amen it's new it's a living way it's alive our prayers are going to a living God amen it's a privilege God hears our prayers remember I don't know if you heard that last Wednesday but we prayed for a preacher out in Illinois he everytime went to the restroom he was seeing blood and he said he asked me to pray so we prayed he said he went to the doctor they examined him he's got no more bleeding he's got a perfect bill of health and he said God took time out of his busy schedule and heard your prayer brother Jesse and he answered my any answer my request praise the Lord that ought to encourage us that God is the Living God amen it encourages me that all although not every prayer works like that it's it's a tremendous blessing when it does work like that and it encourages us to keep praying for all men because God will work everything perfectly he makes all things beautiful when in his own time he'll make everything beautiful remember we're to draw near remember God you and then Karis is requesting the pastor Mozambique when I was praying for that I felt like I got close to God at that point it didn't matter how many words I said I just wanted to be sincere before God because I realized I'm in his presence praise the Lord it's not at that point it's not a labor just to see how many words I can get out remember the Bible said let my words be few be still know that I'm God right heaven in this throne earth is a foot still and they said let your words be few there's 30 minutes already can you believe that I can't believe I preached 30 minutes already what have I said in 30 minutes mercy but see nothing that's what I know I'm really getting in sincere prayer because it's not about just getting out the prayer and praying for everybody it's just expressing that desire and knowing that God hears every word I say it's not vain repetition it's not a race it's not trying to rush this I get to it but it's enjoying that presence and knowing that his presence is near to me because I've draw nigh to him he's already seeked me I wasn't seeking him first but now that he's seeking me he wants me to seek him back and to build up my faith it's a privilege to pray remember the Bible said this for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the by the which we draw nigh unto God we have a better hope our hope is in heaven Jesus Christ is in heaven he's our hope and by that Hope Christ we draw nigh to God see that's when we when we don't praise when we lose hope like oh god don't hear my prayers or I must have upset God or upset heaven or something like that but see we can't let Satan keep us like that we got to remember that Jesus can instantly wash away our sins what can wash away my sins and guilt and depression nothing but the blood of Jesus amen right there there's the blood washes away all that amen it's a hope we have a better hope remember this again about drawing night it's a reality when we draw nigh to God God comes close to us I always remember brother Brooks told me right when I first started preaching he said he said just keep doing what you're doing which was prayer and fasting and studying and everything like that and then he said the more you pray the closer God will get it stuck with me my whole Christian life the more you pray the closer God gets but God giveth more grace wherefore you say if God resists the proud but gives grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God so that's obey God resist the devil and he'll flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanser hanji sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded so again we're promised we we first got to fight off Satan we got a you know knockout Satan got to give him a couple punches and resist them and Satan will leave eventually then you'll draw nigh to God and then God will come close to you it's a reality or I don't feel God's presence on well first obey the Lord rebuke Satan and then draw nigh to God you are promised a fearless presence it's an absolute promise of God Amen and so if you can see the first chapter I read was called the realities of prayer that's why I'm just using this thought on the reality eeehm bounds he's a good good writing so far I've really enjoyed I can't wait to preach some other things and I've read so there's the reality of our privilege of Prayer it is a total privilege it's like a it's like a free pass we have unto God through the blood of Jesus Christ remember sinners don't have that God there their prayer and their church attendance if they're in sin still and iniquities it's abomination unto God the Bible said their prayer is an abomination unto God when they're living in sin and they know the word but they don't obey it but ours is a delight if we're living right before God now here's where the Bible tells us the privilege because we have access so he reconciled both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the entity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were not for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father how many ever like to get access to somebody that that's maybe got a lot of power and authority you ever had access to anybody you know I have some friends that won the Super Bowl and sometimes I have access to them sometimes they'll text me back and I think I feel kind of like funny like wow I can access a famous person you know but then after a while like when inviting them to you know do different things they don't they don't contact me anymore like the access gets cut off but that's just worldly but the Bible said we have access by the spirit to the Father we have an open channel to the foul we have God's open ear God will listen to us through the cross because he slew all your sins amen he slew all that he took that out all the way and now God gives us a channel to talk unto him we have access to God so now you're not a stranger to god you're not a foreigner to God you are fellow sitting you're one of the Saints I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I'm one of Apostle Paul's brothers I'm one of Barnabas as brothers in the gospel amen I'm pretty I preached what they preach right I'm preaching with their preaching and the household of God we have access to God it's a privilege that we have access to God most people like I said most people are strangers most people are foreigners most people are enemies of God few there be that be saved now let's look at here the reality of God's desire for constant prayer that's the reality of it God desires us to constantly pray now you remember the parable of the unjust judge and he spoke a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint remember the story his desperation brother Brahim kinda dramatizes it he said he said that woman would knock and he said but you've got to keep knocking you got to stay knocking on the door you know ask seek and knock him other man said Here I am Lord I'm on your hands I'm waiting for you to open the door unto me and that's what the parable is this woman keeps coming to the king and say Lord I need this Lord I need this and eventually gets tired and just gives it to her well God doesn't get tired of you God delights when you come amen but he's waiting for the right time to answer your prayer and so Jesus gives us that parable keep knocking people that have genuine faith we'll keep knocking praise the Lord they'll keep knocking keep believing keep seeking always pray that's the reality of it God wants us to pray all the time Philippians 4:6 be careful for nothing don't worry about anything the Bible said but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God in everything so whatever you're struggling with whatever you're maybe having trouble being thankful for or whatever you're struggling with worrying about this worry about that we've got to take that worry we've got to take that anxiety and go to God in prayer and say God I'm guilty of worry I'm guilty of anxiety build up my faith in the Holy Ghost stir me up and help me to take a hold upon the word of God amen that's all we can do the Bible said we cannot worry about anything it's a sin don't worry right because it's unbelief it's fair we cannot be careful for anything and the Bible said if you pray like this you're guaranteed the peace of God the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus hallelujah how many believe that scripture everybody believed that can't worry can't worry God's peace will keep you it will keep you but you've gotta in everything let your requests Lord this is really difficult looks difficult but let me I want to let you know my request Lord could you do this Lord would you do this and when you do that you'll feel the peace of God well I've asked God I've done all I can do and so I know it's in God's hand I know God heard of my prayer like recently I was at a family's house in Copley I think I told you about it when I don't know how many people join me but I fasted and prayed for their older son and nothing's happened yet but I told the father and the mother I said I said with prayer and fasting that is the full extreme that is the the greatest extreme of Christian go to to show God you're sincere about a prayer request and I said when you pray and fast you've taken the time you're going to eat you've taken that you've set that aside and you've devoted that time to prayer and God sees your effort that you want this request more than you want your food and and when you've done that you can have peace with God because you've shown God that you mean business and you can have confidence God I've sacrificed I made every effort I've been like job I've sacrificed it on your altar and I'm putting it in your hands and I could have peace I've done everything I know how to do to hear let to let God hear my voice amen and so they had peace with that and they've text me back and said we're so thankful you're in our lives and you are such a comfort to our lives these parents who you know this child who's addicted to marijuana I think it's some other things like that but see this is what we that's what we must do that gives us the peace of God once we've done all we can do once we've made our requests known unto God then the peace of God comforts us then we can wait upon God this is some of the sweetest instructions here in the Bible for Christians Romans 12:10 be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love and honour preferring one another not slothful in business fervent that's boiling member in the spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer distributing the necessity of the Saints given to hospitality isn't that just like a boom-boom-boom-boom-boom list of I need to do that today I need to do that today I need to do that what a great summary of what it looks like to be a Christian you work as hard as you can in your business right you're constantly praying you're rejoicing in the hope you're patient in all your trials you're you're constantly given to people that need it that's a real Christian life but the instant of prayer instant means to it to be glued to to adhere to to be devoted so you and I are to be devoted to prayer and so I want to just close I got I got four more minutes that'll be 45 minutes I'll preach so I try to I'll try to stay with that if I can I'll try the reality of prayer as your responsibility or devotion to God remember in Proverbs one God did not hear them because they didn't take the responsibility of praying remember that's what God said because he said you didn't call because you didn't answer when I called and you didn't now when you call I'm not gonna answer you Church it is our responsibility and our devotion to pray that's our our responsibility brother Branham says is he talking about the bride in Christ and then he eventually against how we should pray I'm speaking of how it can get away when you get to mix it up with the words I'm out of the church mixes and flirts with the world the church and all the fashions and things that we have we're no more like the original Pentecost was then day is from night we've drifted off somewhere into some dark chaos somewhere and lost he's talking about when a church drifts off from the Pentecostal experience what a sacred trust you've probably heard this before what a responsibility to a woman not to drift off right with another man now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibilities as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to pray and to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman has so just as a regular wife must be faithful just to her husband so the church must be faithful to prayer to Christ and notice is not just the responsibility like well I've got to do this I gotta take out the trash I got to pay the mortgage I got to do that pray the insurance but it's actually sacred like this is special this is really important that I pray to Christ it's a sacred responsibility it's something we need to take very seriously I like this this is just encouraging that some people will pray more than others but member all of us are still called to pray all the time I'm to understand that I believe God's got a variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made this season summer winter spring autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a God of variety he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic so blessed means you get upset real fast dogmatic I mean you're really systematic and others are fine and others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom see Andrew is that prayer warrior so the Apostle Andrew but ramza was a prayer warriors there must have been some history about him he just stayed on his knees all the time the Apostle Peter was one of those firebrands that preached and so forth and Paul was more scholarly like more like the Prophet or something and set back so I'm just reading you this to encourage you there will be people that will be more prayer warriors than others because that's their calling in life but remember we should pray for all men and we should all pray without ceasing but there's going to be some people that are prayer warriors and they're gonna pray more often than others I think I got a few more here let me see where I'm at yeah I just got a few more yeah you like this one but Bram said don't you like to get alone with the Lord how many like to get alone with the Lord I bet your mothers are saying oh yeah he's got kids with you all the time that's very special for a mother to get alone with the Lord dads - there's my 45 minutes okay I mean do five more I'll try to finish here don't you like to get alone with the Lord my my just to be alone we used to sing a little song there sometimes I like to be all alone with Christ my lord did you ever hear I can tell him all my troubles all alone and that's the way he wants to get you alone to himself he wants to get you and I alone to himself your prayers not so much as when you're all maybe coming you know for instance well out in the public when you're praying like in church around the altar get alone so God saying it's even when we pray here that's fine but God wants to get you totally alone now we've got to make sure when we get alone we don't run to our phones or to entertainment when we should run to prayer because if you ever find yourself alone on board or I'm tired I think I'll just get on my phone I think I'll just you know do this that's the time God wants us to pray he wants to get us alone you'll prayer you listen I look at the stuff you'll pray a different prayer when you're by yourself then you do when you're in the public slip alone all of you all of you see go out and just have a real secret meeting place where you and the lord meet several times a day and praying I know that's hard for moms you know hon hon sorry and maybe dad's too but how many believe this is true how many they didn't Daniel how many times of Daniel pray right three times a day he got alone with God because God wants to meet that's the way he wants to get you alone to himself God's up there thinking ah if I could just get Malachi alone with myself tell you some of the kids if I can just get Jesse alone to himself he's so busy doing this I can just I just want spend a little time with him I can just get these mothers I can just get this mother alone to herself I can spend some time with her I heard Danny Regan preach at one time that sometimes when he goes into prayer he says Lord this is your my time now and I just almost cry when I say it where you go to God you say Lord this is your my time together I want to spend some time with you Lord I want to tell you all that's in my heart I want to tell you all my trouble it's just you and I I don't wanna tell my husband I don't tell my wife I don't wanna tell my children I don't tell the pastor my troubles I just want to tell you my troubles and I want I want to I want to have the peace of God that passes all understanding I don't want to be anxious about this I want the peace of God to rule my heart I'm not gonna spend much time on this like I said I want to close but I just want to remember it remind you of this the reality that our unconfessed sins hinders our prayers God told Isaiah this remember this is the same scripture I just read in Isaiah 64 about you got to stir yourself up and take a hold on God when you're spread forth your hands I will hide my eyes from you yeh when you make many prayers I will not hear because your hands are full of blood see they're guilty they haven't confessed their sins and then he says I'll wash you and then I love this scripture though your sins be as scarlet those should be white as snow so that's a reality if we've got blood on our hands if we're guilty and haven't made it right God can't God doesn't hear those prayers because we've got to make that right first and I think I'm closing with this this because this kind of ties in with our I got two more yeah ties in with our other series the reality that wisdom comes through prayer if we want to be more wise I don't want to make the wise choices in life it only comes through prayer because the Bible says if you lack wisdom let him ask God so you have to ask Lord I don't know what to do in this situation so you got to ask because God will give it to you very freely he'll freely give it liberally he'll give it to you very freely and he upbraideth not he's not gonna rebuke you when you ask it shall be given him but you gotta ask in faith nothing wavering and that's right when we pray when we pray we got to make sure we pray sincerely enough not long enough but sincerely enough until we feel God drawing nigh unto us where it's not about the number of words it's not about how much time but it's about feeling his presence and talking to God you know he's draw near to you then you can say God I really need wisdom and then when you leave that prayer you can say praise the Lord I know he's gonna give it to me that's what the scripture says I don't doubt it because I felt his presence I felt there was a holy sacredness around me I asked him I know he heard me I don't feel that presence all the time I feel that in prayer amen I remember this we read this last week to Solomon told his son if you cry after knowledge if you lift up your voice in prayer for understanding if you seek wisdom as silver and search for as hid treasures you'll understand the fear of God and find the knowledge of God let's say in our feet I think I'll just stop right there by the grace of Lord let me just go back to that quote let's just think about this quote as we get ready to pray here I'm just getting alone with God it's good to pray here this is the House of Prayer how many could say amen to that it's the House of Prayer but jesus said the the prayers that he hears are the seeker prayers because then he rewards those openly in public around sinners around family at the church he rewards us openly when we pray like that but you our heads here were for a word of Prayer by the grace of God Father in heaven we thank you for tonight Lord God we thank you for the word that we've heard lord I pray after tonight I just pray that we would be changed Lord we'd go from glory to a little more glory we go from the faith that we started the service with to a little more faith as we read last Wednesday the glory of God would shine more and more unto a perfect day Lord let our lights be a little bit brighter leaving here tonight faith comes by hearing hearing by the word Lord our faith has grown tonight and now we've got to take what we've heard and we've got to go build up that faith through prayer in the Holy Spirit in our homes that's your pattern it's a reality oh just I want to thank you for the realities of Prayer Lord God thank you for the reality Lord God that you're inviting us to come and drink of these refreshing waters thank you Jesus I feel refreshed tonight lord I thank you God for your Holy Spirit or I felt your presence draw nigh Lord God as we draw nigh to you you draw nigh to us Lord God [Music] nor does we close in prayer here dear God just just help us Lord God be merciful to us as we said help wasn't that supposed to be beating our chests that we'd say symbolically be merciful to me Lord God I want to get alone with you I want to spend more time in prayer be merciful to me I know you're waiting up there that we'd say you're waiting for Jesse Smith get alone more often so you can fellowship and lord I know that I get cracks in my road and I need the tar of the blood of Jesus Christ to keep the world out I need you to fill in my broken places amen Lord if there's broken places in the people's hearts I pray you to fill it now with the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] that's the only thing that'll heal or fill their broken hearts Lord their wounded hearts or their broken spirits Lord God renew a steadfast spirit within me David prayed after he'd sinned he's saying fill my cracks with the blood of Jesus Christ build up my faith through prayer the Holy Ghost dear God what a privilege Lord that we have access what a privilege lore that you're not hiding your face from our prayers like those at the end of proverbs chapter 1 who have done wickedness and slain and shed blood and stolen Lord done all kinds of awful things dear God thank you that your ears open to our prayers here tonight [Music] Lord yes we do your prophet asked don't you like to get alone with God and Lord our answer tonight as yes we do Lord we do like to get along with you we just get really busy we just have to watch children we just have to do our responsibilities but we just asked for your help Lord God to remember the realities of Prayer our sacred responsibility of praying to Christ as the wife of Christ help us Lord to remember how sacred it is how much of a privilege it is to get on our knees and pray I'm thinking of that altar of incense we preached on in December Lord that was the last piece before going in the Friends of God help us Lord God to draw nigh to you Lord closer to the Holies of Holies you'll surely draw nigh to us for you promised it we just asked for your help lord help us to draw nigh to you the Lord as we go through this series just guide me I pray by the Holy Spirit I'm gonna preach things on prayer that would help the people Lord God we know your prophet said to fall in love with Jesus read your Bible pray every day help that to become a reality for all of us dear God stir us up Lord as we pray that we can grab ahold of you Lord God and not let you go to your bless us in Jesus Christ mighty name the church set amen praise God let's just in a Jehovah Jireh [Music] i probe ah you are more than enough for [Music] my by your stride I've been set free [Music] Shama you are with me [Music] [Applause] and you are then he know so much more than enough you are more a man what a reality he's all we need Church and when we read these scriptures ha me realize all you really need is a prayer life because that is your strength that's how you build yourself up that's how you stir yourself up that's how you lose all your caution or your nervousness all you need is a contact with the Holy Spirit by God's grace access to God amen so thankful for that that we have that church I think that's why we praise Him that's why we see Amen oh that's why we praise Him that's why we see that's why we offer him our breathing oh that's why we bow down and worship this King as he gave his everything cuz he gave his that's why we go that's why we bow and we worship this he cause he gave coz he gave praise the Lord Amen I've got peace like a river I've got peace like
