[2:32] you can do lord god and we just know
[2:34] you'll do it we just trust you to do it
[2:36] we give you thanks and praise in jesus
[2:37] christ's name and the saint said
[2:39] amen god bless you
[2:41] you're being seated god
[2:44] so let's do 45 minutes here and we'll
[2:46] see how this goes
[2:53] and just i just announced it right
[2:54] before we did the prayer brother amen
[2:56] was hoping to do a fellowship on march
[2:58] 5th so that's a saturday in the
[3:00] afternoon
[3:01] so i told him yeah brother i'll let the
[3:02] church know i need to text everybody but
[3:05] um so if the weather's nice we'll take
[3:07] the kids to the park maybe do a bible
[3:08] study or something like that or if it's
[3:10] cold we'll go get fun and then we'll get
[3:11] all warmed up or something like that
[3:13] but the main thing like brother said
[3:14] have the warmness of the holy ghost in
[3:16] your soul right
[3:17] that's what as a christian that's what
[3:18] you want to be around god's people more
[3:20] you know you just love god's people
[3:21] can't get enough of them praise god
[3:24] hallelujah so i have some slides here
[3:26] hun i got some uh scriptures uh we'll
[3:28] try to uh minister here tonight by the
[3:30] holy spirit
[3:32] and just trust god to speak his words to
[3:35] us here now i want to just briefly say
[3:37] you know i've been studying individual
[3:39] spirits uh as far as what the bible says
[3:42] about individual demons i've also been
[3:44] studying about all the effects of the
[3:46] holy spirit so we'll try to get to those
[3:48] on sunday lord willing
[3:50] and then like i said i want to show
[3:52] examples of uh absolute uh
[3:55] doctrines of devils i want to show some
[3:56] of those at some point
[3:59] sorry let's get plugged in here with the
[4:01] i just unplugged it i'll try it again
[4:03] but as i've been studying these i found
[4:05] that um
[4:07] they all have names you know and
[4:08] different things like that and i just
[4:10] want to i want to find a scriptural
[4:12] background for all these spirits so when
[4:14] those spirits come against you you can
[4:16] speak to those spirits in the name of
[4:18] jesus christ and church they have to
[4:20] flee
[4:22] wait a little bit you know when i've
[4:23] cast out devils and seen that i got to
[4:25] wait a minute or two but they'll
[4:26] eventually go
[4:28] right you gotta pray you gotta stand
[4:30] there on god's word
[4:31] right they're they're wrestling they're
[4:33] trying to
[4:34] uh they're trying to keep their uh
[4:36] territory
[4:37] but if you just hold on to god's word
[4:39] keep confessing the word of god and if
[4:41] and if everyone wants the victory there
[4:43] and if everybody's confessed all their
[4:45] sins that devil has to move
[4:47] praise god that's that in the name of
[4:49] jesus we're just saying about it we have
[4:51] the victory in the name of jesus praise
[4:53] god
[4:54] like remember when cam was here you know
[4:56] uh that devil of diabetes tried to come
[4:57] on and remember that
[4:59] when he was here preaching not long ago
[5:01] and he said just kept come he said it
[5:03] left that first time it came back in the
[5:04] morning he had to rebuke it again
[5:08] okay yeah you might have missed that
[5:09] were you here when cam was here last
[5:10] time okay yeah so uh that's what come he
[5:13] said a spear he felt an evil spirit come
[5:15] upon him and his heart started beating
[5:17] and he just felt it was he felt the holy
[5:19] spirit gave him a discernment this was a
[5:20] diabetes spirit or we'd say a spirit of
[5:23] infirmity
[5:24] right infirmity means sickness a
[5:26] sickness is coming on someone and so
[5:28] brother cam rebuked it he said i'm not
[5:30] taking that
[5:31] i think a doctor might have tried to
[5:32] tell him of that as well well he said he
[5:35] said after a moment it left and he felt
[5:37] fine he said he woke up that next
[5:39] morning and that same sickness was upon
[5:40] him and he said he felt it was a devil
[5:42] so he rebuked it and then it said not a
[5:45] few minutes after that then it was gone
[5:46] by god's grace again
[5:48] so just in other words there's times
[5:50] where you can feel evil how many can
[5:51] understand what i'm talking about
[5:52] there's times you walk into places and
[5:53] you can feel evil
[5:55] well that's a demonic presence right
[5:58] and god protects us right we know that
[6:00] but i'm we're talking about here with a
[6:02] personal battle or personal battle you
[6:04] have the authority if you confess all
[6:06] your sins you have the authority to
[6:08] rebuke the spirit in the name of jesus
[6:10] and jesus did it by name
[6:12] jesus called you spirit he called it the
[6:14] devil you spirit of infirmity or he'd
[6:16] say you deaf and dumb spirit come out of
[6:18] him
[6:19] right so that's why i want to go in in
[6:21] these next few services uh because then
[6:24] when these spirits come now we realize
[6:25] they they come as sicknesses but they
[6:27] also come as doctrines
[6:30] right and then we have the authority as
[6:31] a believer to cast down any evil spirit
[6:34] the bible says anything that exalts
[6:35] itself against the knowledge of god it
[6:37] must be cast down
[6:39] it must be thrown down in other in other
[6:41] words rebuked it must be stood up
[6:43] against
[6:44] you must take your your ground as a
[6:46] christian praise god
[6:48] so i want to just show this now
[6:51] all evil spirits whether they're
[6:53] sicknesses or
[6:55] religious demons i was listening to
[6:56] demonology today by brother brad i'm
[6:58] about religious spirits
[7:00] but no matter what kind of demon it is
[7:01] whether it's a sickness or a spiritual
[7:04] demon
[7:06] they're there to bring you into bondage
[7:09] or uh develop bad habits in your life
[7:12] and that's what brother bram says you
[7:13] know i've read this a few weeks ago but
[7:14] i just want to read it again
[7:16] he said today a man might go out drink
[7:18] smoke curse do the things his habits is
[7:20] hanging on to him it's rooted in there
[7:23] it's a spirit so it's a just like a root
[7:24] of bitterness it can be a root of
[7:26] infirmity or it can be a root of
[7:28] selfishness or root of jealousy right a
[7:31] root of pride a root of uh lust or
[7:33] arrogance or whatever it is it's got a
[7:36] root it has
[7:37] the person has accepted it and they like
[7:40] that spirit they they worship that he
[7:44] said habits are spirits so bad habits
[7:46] are when spirits get into people's lives
[7:48] or minds and they're not driven out
[7:51] they're just accepted okay i'm gonna
[7:53] live with this it's okay for me to live
[7:55] like this i enjoy living this i can't
[7:56] overcome it that's that that's a person
[7:59] that has a demon possessing their mind
[8:02] right it might not be the full demon
[8:04] possession we'd say like mary magdalene
[8:05] had seven demons in her as she was a
[8:08] prostitute seven demons all right so
[8:10] think about the people we know that
[8:11] sleep around brother they've got demons
[8:13] upon demons upon demons on them
[8:15] at least maybe seven maybe more right
[8:19] because mary magdalene had seven and she
[8:20] had to get delivered from seven demons
[8:22] by jesus
[8:24] right and the brother man said they're
[8:25] unclean spirits in men
[8:27] he said excuse me he said but we're in
[8:29] the judgment house of god we must say
[8:31] these things clear like a man he said
[8:33] when he's lustful he's a sex maniac not
[8:35] only that just lustful
[8:37] the way women dress he said no wonder
[8:39] they are if women comes women can become
[8:41] the same way now listen lustful spirits
[8:43] get on them and they're
[8:45] nice ladies
[8:46] sometimes you have mean ladies that are
[8:49] lustful but then you have sometimes you
[8:51] have nice just like the pharisees they
[8:53] weren't willing to be lustful they might
[8:54] not have been sleeping around but they
[8:55] were nice in some ways you're kind old
[8:58] priests right so see a demon can be
[9:00] anointing someone and they act nice but
[9:02] wait till you start calling them out
[9:05] that's when you're going to see what
[9:06] they're what's inside of them because
[9:08] satan hates to be exposed
[9:10] that's why the pharisees sadducees the
[9:12] demon-possessed people wanted to kill
[9:14] jesus because jesus was calling them out
[9:16] amen and that's what as christians we
[9:18] must be honest if we've got a sin we
[9:20] must be honest and call it out
[9:22] if we want to be free if we want godly
[9:24] habits we must call out our bad habits
[9:27] and you don't got to tell the world but
[9:28] you got to tell jesus amen
[9:31] hallelujah if you want someone to pray
[9:32] for you got to tell them to pray for
[9:34] them as for they can pray for you as
[9:36] well
[9:38] so see this idea of every spirit brings
[9:41] bondage is right no matter the spirit
[9:44] because the bible says in meekness so we
[9:46] must go to people that are taken captive
[9:48] by spirits and be humble
[9:51] and instruct them because they oppose
[9:53] themselves they're fighting against
[9:54] their own spiritual life right they're
[9:56] hurting themselves but we have to be
[9:58] meek about it
[10:00] if god will per venture give them
[10:02] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[10:03] truth the fact that they are enslaved to
[10:05] a demon
[10:07] right if they are enslaved to we'd say
[10:09] lust or enslaved to pride because a lot
[10:11] of people today are enslaved in pride
[10:13] right
[10:14] like the pharisees and they may recover
[10:16] i'm sorry that they may recover
[10:18] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[10:20] so anyone with bad sinful habits is
[10:22] trapped in a snare a trap of satan
[10:26] right and they're taken captive so satan
[10:28] has them can you imagine satan's got him
[10:30] chained up in like we say like a bird
[10:32] caged up like a bird
[10:34] when someone has bad habits that's what
[10:36] they are in one way
[10:37] they're chained they're locked up they
[10:39] can't get out of that there's no way
[10:41] they can get out but jesus came church
[10:43] to set us free amen
[10:45] that's the whole point he came was
[10:46] destroy the works of the devil
[10:48] hallelujah
[10:49] right and to destroy satan's works to
[10:51] set god's people free amen from bad
[10:54] habits hallelujah
[10:56] because they're slave they're enslaved
[10:57] to bad habits
[10:59] and they get on them through many times
[11:00] through doctrines of devils
[11:03] in other words the church allows them to
[11:04] do it and tells them to do it and it's a
[11:06] deceiving spirit behind the preacher
[11:08] many times that will allow them to live
[11:10] as a slave to sin may god help us not to
[11:13] ever allow or put up with evil spirits
[11:15] but to drive them out praise god and
[11:17] preach victory and preach
[11:19] holiness praise god amen and to preach
[11:22] overcoming power to speak freedom by the
[11:24] holy spirit that we can live it and
[11:26] possess all spiritual blessings amen
[11:29] hallelujah
[11:31] we're going to fight yes we're going to
[11:33] fight daily we're going to fall short
[11:34] every day but that doesn't mean we're
[11:36] slaves to it that doesn't mean we have
[11:37] to develop the bad habit of it it just
[11:39] means we've got to repent and move on
[11:41] with god and forget the things in the
[11:42] past and press forward toward the mark
[11:45] of the high calling in christ jesus
[11:47] amen
[11:49] i got 36 minutes so bear hold on hold on
[11:52] hold on old faithful
[11:55] amen romans 8 says you've not received
[11:57] the spirit of bondage
[12:00] how many can say amen to that
[12:02] i'm not received a devil that will keep
[12:04] me enslaved to sin
[12:06] but we've received the spirit of
[12:08] adoption
[12:11] that means relationship we've received
[12:13] the spirit of a relationship with god
[12:16] almighty amen
[12:18] whereby we cry abba father or daddy
[12:21] daddy or abba father it's father just
[12:24] another name for father it's a it's a
[12:26] childlike name for father abba father
[12:28] that's what jesus prayed abba father
[12:30] daddy father he has such an intimate
[12:32] relationship praise god
[12:35] see we haven't received that now look
[12:39] uh
[12:40] here's why people
[12:43] receive spirits of bondage and any any
[12:45] evil spirit is a bondage spirit while
[12:47] they promise themselves i'm sorry while
[12:49] the preachers promised them liberty they
[12:51] themselves are the servants of
[12:52] corruption so in churches that are
[12:54] deceived they have preachers that are
[12:56] bound by sin and they preach lies and
[12:58] they get the people bound in sin
[13:01] like the example let me just the biggest
[13:03] church in america as a pastor that will
[13:04] not preach against homosexuality so by
[13:06] him not preaching it it allows those
[13:08] people to stay slave in the habits of
[13:11] homosexuality
[13:13] amen
[13:14] and they he'll promise them liberty and
[13:17] healing and all these things but they're
[13:19] the servants of corruption now that man
[13:20] in particular might be a servant to
[13:22] money he might be a slave to the spirit
[13:24] of money love of money the the idol of
[13:26] money
[13:27] but yet through him not preaching
[13:29] against it allows those demons to sit
[13:31] there and yet the whole time he's
[13:32] promising them healing and all these
[13:34] blessings and all these good fortunes
[13:36] and good contracts and millions of
[13:37] dollars he's promising breakthroughs all
[13:39] these things but at the same time he's
[13:41] held in bondage to the spirit of fear
[13:43] because he won't preach the truth and
[13:45] that causes the rest of the church to be
[13:46] under the same spirit of fear
[13:49] or whatever spirit it is does everybody
[13:51] understand
[13:53] for the bible says for of whom a man has
[13:55] overcome the same as he had brought into
[13:58] bondage so in other words who whatever
[14:00] demon spirit we might give in to or
[14:01] anybody whatever spirit they give into
[14:03] now they're a slave to that spirit
[14:06] praise god whether it's lying if they
[14:08] give if they give into a lie and they
[14:09] don't make that lie right that spirit is
[14:11] going to make them lie again
[14:13] praise god
[14:14] right if they give in to lust and gets
[14:17] them to lust they don't repent they're
[14:18] going to lust again and they'll be a
[14:20] slave to it they'll never be free from
[14:22] it praise god but with jesus he brings
[14:24] the spirit of adoption amen and as a
[14:27] relationship we know father help me out
[14:30] i'm in need i'm your son the bible said
[14:32] if you ask for a fish god's a good god
[14:34] he's going to give you a fish and he
[14:35] said if you ask for the holy ghost god
[14:37] will give you the holy ghost amen
[14:39] highly do you know jesus said that
[14:41] they said if you ask for the holy ghost
[14:43] i'll give it to you did you know he said
[14:44] that
[14:45] okay
[14:46] let's read it yeah let's go to i think

[15:30] we're talking about
[15:32] and the girls like i mean they all like

[15:38] know how to give good gifts unto your
[15:40] children how much more shall your
[15:41] heavenly father give the holy spirit to
[15:43] them that ask him amen
[15:45] hallelujah so just look at look at a
[15:47] natural dad i give my children the best
[15:50] computers i can get them praise god
[15:52] i don't get the cheap ones i get the
[15:53] best ones amen

[15:57] food many times praise god
[15:59] i don't give them the cheap enough i saw
[16:00] all the money i had i get in the cheap

[16:03] going to get the best and if i do that

[16:33] and i've never seen it fail
[16:35] because the bible said in every
[16:36] temptation there's a way out amen
[16:39] in other words in every situation god's
[16:41] got a great gift to give you if you cry
[16:43] out to him for it praise god
[16:46] we're not to be slaves
[16:48] we're to be overcomers amen
[16:50] hallelujah
[16:52] now also all spirits are antichrist
[16:57] so someone say oh that antichrist spirit
[16:59] well really all are antichrist
[17:01] because antichrist
[17:03] means adversary right i looked at this a
[17:05] little bit on sunday he said little
[17:06] children it's the last time john said
[17:08] this you've heard that many antichrists
[17:10] i'm sorry that antichrist shall come
[17:11] that's speaking of the pope
[17:13] even now are there many antichrists look
[17:15] at this there's already many antichrists
[17:17] whereby we know that is the last time so
[17:19] he said you're looking for the pope but
[17:20] there's already a bunch of antichrist
[17:21] preachers out here
[17:23] so see any spirit we'd say is antichrist
[17:26] to some degree
[17:28] because it means adversary or opponent
[17:30] of jesus and jesus is the revealed word
[17:33] amen jesus is the revelation of god's
[17:35] word hallelujah he's the word made flesh
[17:38] praise god so all spirits bring bondage
[17:41] all demon spirits
[17:42] and all uh demons are antichrist in some
[17:46] degree or it's all yeah to full degree
[17:49] now you know i'm gonna just drop here uh
[17:51] lord uh stop here and come back here in
[17:53] just a moment i'm on 57. okay
[17:56] let me just go through this list here
[17:57] real quick church church i think it'll
[17:58] just help you uh hopefully to encourage
[18:00] you to read your bible here a little
[18:02] more you know i need we all need who
[18:03] needs more bible reading praise god we
[18:04] all need it i'm not bashing anybody i'm
[18:06] just saying we all need our bible
[18:08] reading more we got to choose instead of
[18:09] click on that we got to click on the
[18:10] bible praise god
[18:12] now look i just gone through i just
[18:13] spent a few hours studying on saturday
[18:15] and here's the actual names for demons
[18:17] that we're gonna have to overcome
[18:20] now
[18:21] the bible calls a spirit of divination
[18:23] which is like a sauce now this is what's
[18:24] on a lot of preachers today trying to
[18:26] predict the rapture
[18:28] right
[18:29] divination or familiar spirit now these
[18:31] may be the same but one kind of involves
[18:32] invoking the dead now that's actually
[18:35] getting in the tape church movement
[18:36] right where they actually think brother
[18:37] brown's marrying them
[18:39] the one the one song leader from
[18:40] jeffersonville was crying thanking god
[18:42] that their pastor brother branham was
[18:44] going to preach to them that night
[18:46] something wrong with that something is
[18:47] very wrong with that do you ever see the
[18:48] methodists do that say oh thank god john
[18:50] wesley is going to preach to us tonight
[18:52] you ever see them do that
[18:54] and that's that spirit is hanging right
[18:56] around the message
[18:58] see that's not it's not around the
[18:59] methodist anymore because god's moved
[19:00] past that that's denominated it's dead
[19:03] they have a name that they live but
[19:04] they're dead
[19:06] but satan hangs around the present truth
[19:09] and tries to deceive people out of that
[19:11] right
[19:13] spirit of jealousy we talked about that
[19:15] that's a demonic spirit remember on the
[19:16] van or the car we're talking about that
[19:18] that's a demonic spirit jealousy
[19:21] a lying spirit now see church these come
[19:23] up these will come upon us and we've got
[19:25] to cast them down
[19:27] and you can call them by name
[19:29] praise god
[19:31] and you can call them out
[19:33] say get behind you can say get behind me
[19:34] satan in the name of jesus christ you
[19:37] lying spirit get behind me i'm telling
[19:39] the truth praise god amen
[19:42] perverse spirit now that's what i got to
[19:44] study on a lot
[19:45] haughty's very simple pride a prideful
[19:47] spirit that's all over the message
[19:48] people today because if the devil can't
[19:50] get them with uh you know lust of the
[19:52] eyes lust of the flesh he's going to get
[19:53] him on the pride of life and that's what
[19:55] we got to be careful for too i'm going
[19:56] to preach i may get to that tonight
[19:57] actually i had in my notes i may get
[19:59] that tonight
[20:00] heaviness that's the depression spirit
[20:02] that's what the bible calls the spirit
[20:04] of depression is heaviness now you got a
[20:05] right church when you feel down you got
[20:07] a right to rebuke that spirit of
[20:08] heaviness
[20:09] and what the bible say you take off
[20:10] heaviness put on the take off heaviness
[20:12] and put on the garment of praise hey i
[20:14] didn't hear him praise god amen you got
[20:16] to put that on so i'm not putting on
[20:18] these mourners clothes and feel sorry
[20:20] put on a garment of praise amen put on
[20:22] your spiritual robe amen put on jesus
[20:25] righteousness and rejoice in it amen
[20:28] the bible says jesus made me righteous
[20:31] amen
[20:32] i know i failed but the bible says when
[20:33] i confess he's forgiving me and i put on
[20:36] new clothes i got white robes on i
[20:38] rejoice in his righteousness i can be
[20:40] glad because he loves me he forgive me
[20:43] he's empowering me and i'm clothed in
[20:45] his spirit praise god
[20:48] whoredoms this is a huge one brotherham
[20:49] said anything can be an idol i'll look
[20:51] at that maybe lord winning on sunday
[20:55] whoredom is a unlawful union so adultery
[20:58] or fornication unlawful union right and
[21:00] that's all idolatry is when someone bows
[21:02] down to a a wooden god or something like
[21:05] that that's all it is it's a religious
[21:07] it's a spirit of idolatry
[21:10] it's spiritual fornication
[21:12] and that's all over and remember people
[21:14] bow down to their jobs right they bow
[21:16] down
[21:17] to anything computers you know they bow
[21:19] down to alcohol if they worship that if
[21:22] they love that more they love jesus
[21:23] that's a spirit of whoredoms
[21:25] amen
[21:27] infirmities sickness any sickness that's
[21:29] covered 19 right there spear of
[21:31] infirmity
[21:32] right you could have got a right to
[21:33] speak to that demon
[21:35] deaf and dumb if it's a person's death
[21:37] or dumb got a right to speak to that
[21:39] spirit
[21:40] amen spirit of fear now we all battle
[21:42] that don't we right you got a right to
[21:44] speak to that spirit of fear
[21:47] rebuke it and say i have a spirit of
[21:49] power love and a sound mind
[21:52] a seducing spirit that's a deceiving
[21:53] spirit now that one's very closely
[21:55] associated to this one these may be the
[21:57] same church uh perverse and seducing
[21:59] spirit of air that may be the same one
[22:00] too
[22:01] the bible says we've not received the
[22:03] spirit of air we've received the spirit
[22:05] of truth amen
[22:07] and then israel has the spirit of
[22:08] blindness the bible says it's slumber
[22:10] they can't see that jesus a messiah
[22:12] because this evil spirit's on them
[22:17] and then the bible says unclean or foul
[22:19] spirit now that may be all as well if
[22:21] you read that every spirit is unclean in
[22:23] the eyes of god
[22:25] every demon spirit is foul in the eyes
[22:27] of god
[22:28] and so so all demons are probably
[22:30] spirits of bondage antichrist and the
[22:32] bible says the spirit of the world does
[22:34] that help
[22:35] okay now here here there's what we got
[22:37] we're not
[22:38] we're not left we're not you know we're
[22:39] not left with no weapons church we got
[22:41] plenty of weapons praise god there's a
[22:43] lot of demons out there but there's a
[22:44] great power in the holy ghost too amen
[22:46] hallelujah hallelujah there's more with
[22:49] us than with is than this with the devil
[22:51] praise god we got more angels we got
[22:54] more power i think we've got more
[22:56] attributes of the holy spirit we've got
[22:58] more weaponry praise god and our weapons
[23:00] aren't weak our weapons are mighty amen
[23:02] but how do you see them through your
[23:04] words
[23:05] amen you got to speak them you got to
[23:07] obey the word you got to uh you got to
[23:09] repent of sins obey the word your heart
[23:12] doesn't condemn you and you speak the
[23:14] word and god backs up his word amen
[23:18] so the bible says there's a holy spirit
[23:20] of wisdom which it's the same spirit
[23:22] just different powers that go along with
[23:24] it right different attributes of the
[23:26] same holy spirit
[23:28] there's a spirit of understanding we got
[23:30] i have all the scriptures for these
[23:32] spirit of judgment there's a spirit of
[23:34] burning that's a good one
[23:36] i want to end with that one if again
[23:38] there's a spirit of being humble or
[23:39] meekness that the holy spirit gives you
[23:41] there's a spirit of joy praising glory
[23:43] so see that's what we need that's what
[23:44] more message people need we need some
[23:45] joy praise god
[23:47] we should be happy that we're saved amen
[23:49] we should be thankful for all god's done
[23:51] there's a spirit of grace the bible says
[23:54] there's a spirit of supplication that's
[23:55] prayer
[23:57] for people there's a spirit of true
[23:58] spirit of power spirit of love sound
[24:01] mind there's this holy spirit of that
[24:02] there's a spirit of holiness there's a
[24:04] spirit of life there's a spirit of
[24:05] adoption spirit of faith spirit of
[24:07] promise spirit of revelation spirit of
[24:09] prophecy and there's also a fervent
[24:11] spirit as well and the church said
[24:14] amen church so i'm just kind of
[24:16] getting you ready for sunday lord
[24:18] willing if the lord tarries
[24:20] amen
[24:22] so if you need any of those you say lord
[24:24] send your spirit of revelation
[24:26] send your spirit of wisdom yeah brothers
[24:28] have a question
[24:30] fervent uh
[24:31] it's like uh
[24:33] actually i think the word is boiling
[24:35] so if it's boiling it's moving it's
[24:37] alive you know so if you have a fervent
[24:39] spirit it's like a active it's very
[24:42] active
[24:43] right so fervent is active i'd say
[24:45] diligent
[24:46] faithful
[24:48] okay
[24:49] busy busy for the lord a fervent
[24:51] it's alert yeah yeah okay that's pretty
[24:54] good by god's grace fervent spirit the
[24:56] bible said be fervent in your business
[24:57] as well like working at your job and you
[24:59] are
[25:00] you want to do that fervent okay
[25:03] now
[25:04] seeing all those demonic spirits and
[25:06] seeing the holy spirit we know we can
[25:08] get victory by the holy spirit over all
[25:11] those bondage spirits
[25:13] all those antichrist spirits are are not
[25:15] as powerful as god's holy spirit praise
[25:17] god
[25:19] now it's devil anointed preachers that
[25:22] bring the doctrines of devils remember
[25:23] we looked at this uh sunday we saw how
[25:26] they speak lies in hypocrisy they're
[25:28] conscious as a seared uh hot it's seared
[25:31] like a hot iron they don't even feel it
[25:33] anymore when they lie to people
[25:35] see they're just they're deceiving
[25:37] they're teaching demonic desires they
[25:39] lie as hypocrites they preach something
[25:41] but they don't live it they're like
[25:43] they're like uh actors in a play or on a
[25:45] movie they say one thing and that's not
[25:48] really what they that's not really their
[25:49] identity right
[25:51] they say they're a babe ruth or they say
[25:52] they're
[25:53] an actor some woman in a play but
[25:56] they're not they're somebody else they
[25:57] say they're helen keller but they're not
[25:59] helen keller they're acting about it
[26:01] they say they're a preacher but they're
[26:02] not a preacher right they say they're
[26:04] holy but they're not holy amen
[26:07] and their consciences are burned
[26:09] so they don't feel the effects of the
[26:11] lie anymore
[26:13] amen
[26:15] now remember this one a few months ago
[26:17] paul said the church in corinth was
[26:19] suffering because men bring them into
[26:21] bondage it's preachers church i hope
[26:24] your testimony is that through listening
[26:25] to our sermons you become free in the
[26:27] holy spirit
[26:29] i'm not trying to bring anybody into
[26:30] bondage i'm trying to bring you and i
[26:32] into obedience to the holy spirit praise
[26:34] god
[26:34] that should be your testimony amen
[26:37] i should be able to put a quote from
[26:38] every one of you on a postcard amen that
[26:40] says the holy spirit brought us into
[26:42] victory amen
[26:44] and if not come tell me why not praise
[26:45] god what's hindering the victory we got
[26:48] to pray more do we got a fast lord we
[26:49] got to repent what do we got to do jesus
[26:52] promised victory we should be victorious
[26:55] hallelujah
[26:56] so who brings people into bondage
[26:58] preachers
[26:59] that are false and got the wrong
[27:01] anointing
[27:03] if a man see man a man can devour can
[27:05] consume all the blessings that you have
[27:07] a preacher can take all the blessings
[27:09] that you had
[27:10] if they preach from the devil
[27:12] the anointing of the devil
[27:13] they can also take you the bible said if
[27:15] men take you he can seize all your
[27:17] possession so preacher come in he can
[27:19] take all your joy with something false
[27:22] right you could take all your victory
[27:24] with something false
[27:26] like brother william told me when i
[27:27] preached this about lukewarm i preached
[27:29] a little sermon on lukewarm fame brother
[27:31] and barry williams like that was such a
[27:32] wonderful message he said i've seen so
[27:34] many preachers
[27:36] when people come up for prayer he said
[27:37] they take the people's joy from them
[27:40] because they want to repent of something
[27:42] and the brother william said the
[27:43] preachers will stand there and say
[27:44] you're lukewarm you're lukewarm it's
[27:46] your fault and the people might be
[27:49] genuinely filled with the holy ghost
[27:51] and brother william said that people
[27:52] would leave all discouraged like i'm
[27:53] lukewarm i'm lukewarm when in all
[27:55] reality they were just maybe had some
[27:57] mind battles
[27:58] or they just had a complex it's not that
[28:01] because your soul can never be lukewarm
[28:02] amen your soul is sealed it's marked to
[28:05] the day of your redemption and first
[28:07] john 3 says that the seed of god remains
[28:09] in you and the seed of god cannot sin
[28:12] brother william said that was such a
[28:13] wonderful message and it was because it
[28:15] was the holy spirit it wasn't me it was
[28:16] the holy spirit
[28:17] but see but men see preachers if they're
[28:20] if they're all prideful they can take
[28:21] someone's victory
[28:23] and make them think they're not even
[28:24] born again when they might be
[28:26] now the opposite the opposite is
[28:28] denomination they make you feel with the
[28:30] holy ghost when you're not
[28:32] ah
[28:33] so see how we got to have the right
[28:34] spirit as preachers can we see that it's
[28:36] very important that we have as preachers
[28:38] the right spirit
[28:40] because we don't want to make a slave of
[28:41] you to anything except the word
[28:44] we don't want to take consume or devour
[28:46] or take your spiritual blessings we want
[28:48] to give you more praise god we're going
[28:50] to point you to more blessings because
[28:52] in other words i can't give it to you
[28:53] but i can point you to one who can
[28:55] that's christ jesus that man from
[28:57] galilee amen
[29:00] what does a man do a man exalt to
[29:02] himself
[29:03] that's what false preachers do they
[29:05] exalt themselves like they're somebody
[29:09] see i don't have a lot of confidence in
[29:11] a man who you never hear about his
[29:12] struggles
[29:13] all he preaches about how powerful he is
[29:15] how he never has he never can ever admit
[29:17] he's wrong
[29:18] i don't have any confidence in a man
[29:20] like that because brother branham wasn't
[29:21] that way
[29:22] brother brown was very humble
[29:24] and constantly admitted his failures
[29:26] before the people
[29:27] i'll be preaching on that lord willing a
[29:28] little bit and he said they also these
[29:30] preach preachers smite you they
[29:32] disrespect the congregation
[29:35] that's awful
[29:36] but that's how you know a man is
[29:38] anointed of the devil see
[29:40] he tries he takes he makes a slave of
[29:42] you to sin or a depression or something
[29:44] like that he take you lose all your joy
[29:47] lose all your victory
[29:49] uh
[29:50] he exalts himself he becomes a ruler
[29:52] over them and then he disrespects the
[29:54] people
[29:55] see
[29:56] antichrist people now let's look at
[29:58] three more doctrines on sunday we saw
[30:00] how the doctrine of the devil was
[30:02] forbidding people to marry
[30:04] in the catholic church now the opposite
[30:06] true today they allow you to marry
[30:07] anybody
[30:09] right
[30:10] second one was you can't eat meat and we
[30:13] saw that doctrine of the catholic church
[30:14] does the same thing during lent they
[30:16] call it lent is that what they call it
[30:17] okay they call it maybe that's what the
[30:19] protestants call but anyways the time
[30:20] leading up to easter they don't eat meat
[30:22] on friday so they eat fish which the
[30:24] bible calls meat so they're
[30:25] contradicting themselves
[30:28] okay
[30:29] uh
[30:31] now so those are two clear doctrines of
[30:33] devils
[30:36] so now one i want to say this too i
[30:37] forgot to say this on sunday see with
[30:39] that meat thing church it makes them
[30:41] feel more righteous than other people
[30:44] when they go buy fish they call them
[30:45] fish fries brother have you ever driven
[30:47] by
[30:48] you ever driven by like a restaurant
[30:50] around easter they say oh friday come in
[30:52] for fish it's fish fry day
[30:55] and they think the catholics and
[30:56] protestants they think they're more holy
[30:58] going to buy fish on friday than a
[31:01] hamburger
[31:03] because well we can't eat meat on friday
[31:05] but they are eating meat because fish is
[31:06] meat
[31:08] but they stand there and they think
[31:10] they're holier than you
[31:12] and church is not a contest to be holder
[31:13] than thou but it it's a reality that
[31:16] we're only holy by the word of god amen
[31:19] the word of god makes us holy because
[31:21] holy means separated amen they think
[31:23] they're separated because of their diet
[31:25] their natural diet we're separated by
[31:27] the spiritual diet amen
[31:28] jesus said you must eat my flesh and
[31:31] drink my blood amen he said these words
[31:33] are spirit and they are life and we're
[31:35] feasting on the word of god the reveal
[31:38] word of god and we have the right diet
[31:40] the spiritual diet praise god
[31:42] and they're making themselves feel more
[31:44] righteous but they're not amen
[31:47] that's why i didn't preach on sunday so
[31:49] i'm going to pour it in here amen
[31:51] i miss that i kind of forgot that
[31:54] see it's self-righteousness so they feel
[31:56] on one day they feel more righteous than
[31:57] you what a lie
[31:59] what a lie it's the blood of christ that
[32:01] makes us righteous not because you don't
[32:02] eat hamburger on friday
[32:05] ridiculous
[32:07] and eve and all they all they all teach
[32:09] that
[32:10] catholics and many protestants they all
[32:11] teach that like there's something about
[32:12] it makes you more holy it's nonsense
[32:15] that's the devil exalting their flesh
[32:17] making them prideful there it is amen
[32:19] prideful
[32:21] like they got more holiness because they
[32:22] never ate a hamburger on all fridays in
[32:25] in march and april may or march and
[32:27] april
[32:28] ridiculous
[32:30] people are ridiculous i should say
[32:32] people it's the devil's making them
[32:33] ridiculous
[32:34] not the people i'm not against the
[32:35] people i'm against the system praise god
[32:37] i got to make sure help me lord amen
[32:40] now here's yeah here's the third the
[32:42] third doctrine is this the rapture's
[32:44] already passed and we're in the
[32:46] tribulation or millennium
[32:49] now here's the context paul says
[32:51] preachers paul says timothy study
[32:53] yourself approved be a workman that
[32:55] you're not ashamed of what you're
[32:56] preaching rightly dividing the word of
[32:58] truth shun profane and vain babblings
[33:00] though increase in the moral godliness
[33:02] and their word will eat as death a
[33:04] canker a cancer
[33:05] right a flesh-eating disease of whom is
[33:07] hymeneous and felidas he names the two
[33:09] preachers that are preaching false
[33:10] doctrine
[33:11] who concerning the truth have heir
[33:13] saying that the resurrection is passed
[33:14] already in overthrow they destroy the
[33:17] faith of some
[33:19] by claiming the rapture has already
[33:20] happened or the lord's already come and
[33:22] we're in the millennium or we're in the
[33:24] tribulation that destroys people's faith
[33:27] and they'll live any old way they want
[33:29] because they think well the lord's
[33:30] already come he's already here if the
[33:32] lord was here you know it praise god
[33:34] if the lord was here he'd be done with
[33:36] the days of man amen
[33:38] the lord is here the days of man is over
[33:41] and the lord's day would come amen
[33:43] and he take that rod of iron brother
[33:45] austin he slammed it on the ground he
[33:46] said it's now the lord's name and a
[33:48] thousand years of peace amen
[33:50] all these satanic rulers would be cast
[33:53] out and christ would be king hallelujah
[33:56] amen
[33:57] i think the lord's day the lord doesn't
[33:58] come yet he's come by the holy ghost
[34:00] baptism in the soul he's come by the
[34:02] open book of the revelation of the word
[34:04] of god which is only the baptism of the
[34:06] holy ghost he's come in the fullness and
[34:08] the baptism of the holy ghost but he's
[34:09] not come physically and he's not coming
[34:11] any other way other than the revelation
[34:14] of the word of god that was prophesied
[34:16] we're waiting for that corporal body
[34:18] we'll meet that corporate body in the
[34:19] air amen
[34:21] that's the coming of the lord
[34:23] hallelujah
[34:24] but to say it's already happened
[34:26] is the demonic spirit
[34:29] doctrine of a devil
[34:30] it will overthrow it will knock over
[34:32] people's faith
[34:34] where they lose their faith in christ
[34:38] now here
[34:39] that's what satan did with this 1977
[34:42] prediction brother branham as a preacher
[34:44] every preacher has the liberty to make a
[34:45] prediction but the devil took this
[34:48] prediction and really overthrew a lot of
[34:50] people's faith
[34:52] people that don't know the difference
[34:53] between a prediction and uh a prophecy
[34:57] right remember there's three reasons
[34:58] brother bran felt inspired to say 77 he
[35:00] said the seventh jubilee was in 1977. uh
[35:04] or 1977 was 201 years after 1776 no
[35:09] democracy would last
[35:10] over 200 years he said
[35:12] or he thought by history
[35:14] and uh it was also the
[35:17] the fulfillment of
[35:18] 1954 years for gentiles
[35:21] so he thought it was inspiring now look
[35:22] what he put in the church book and look
[35:24] how the devil deceived people with this
[35:27] so i repeat i sincerely believe and
[35:29] maintain as a private student of the
[35:31] word along with
[35:33] divine inspiration
[35:35] that 1977 ought to terminate the world
[35:38] systems and usher in the millennium
[35:40] there's message churches in southern
[35:41] ohio near dayton that believe we're in
[35:43] the millennium
[35:44] and their pastor calls himself the
[35:46] eighth messenger in ohio i tell there's
[35:47] some bad things in ohio but there are
[35:48] some good things too amen
[35:51] there's some good churches in ohio too
[35:52] hallelujah
[35:54] there's some bad ones but there's some
[35:55] good ones hallelujah
[35:57] and see where do they get that how can
[35:58] we how can this be a thousand years of
[36:00] peace because they misunderstand this
[36:02] quote
[36:04] right they don't take this back to the
[36:06] word they don't understand that a
[36:07] prediction is not the same
[36:10] see brother man saw three things all
[36:11] appointed the same year so i thought
[36:13] that's really inspired
[36:15] okay
[36:17] but that's where we get this idea so
[36:19] that same spirit that was that same uh
[36:22] canker amen that same flesh eating
[36:24] disease that was here in paul's day
[36:26] saying the rapture's already passed is
[36:28] here today
[36:30] it's still here
[36:32] trying to tell people the rapture has
[36:33] already happened we're in the
[36:34] tribulation period well it's closer to
[36:36] the tribulation prayer than the
[36:38] millennium but it's neither
[36:40] it's neither
[36:43] here's a fourth doctrine that i've heard
[36:45] in the message no fasting jesus said his
[36:47] children would fast after his physical
[36:49] body left the earth
[36:51] fasting improves your health if you
[36:52] wanted to see that it's isaiah 28 i'm
[36:54] sorry 58. it restores your health
[36:57] fasting does and paul fasted often
[37:00] jesus said how come john's disciples
[37:02] fast often and your disciples don't fast
[37:05] he said can the children of the bride
[37:07] chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom
[37:09] is with them but the days will come when
[37:11] the bright when the bridegroom shall be
[37:13] taken from them and then shall they fast
[37:16] so see jesus body isn't here that's why
[37:18] we still fast and the church said
[37:21] amen
[37:22] here's a fifth doctrine now
[37:25] it's the once saved always saved
[37:27] doctrine or it's the everyone will be
[37:29] saved doctrine
[37:32] where do you get this
[37:34] it's from jude 1 4 says this is not true
[37:37] for there are certain men crept in
[37:39] unawares who were before of old ordained
[37:42] to this condemnation
[37:43] so there's men that were ordained to go
[37:45] to hell and they crept into the church
[37:48] slowly
[37:49] slowly
[37:50] i think i said this a few years ago i've
[37:52] watched different people coming to
[37:53] church usually after six months or a
[37:55] year they're going to show their colors
[37:58] usually
[38:00] now some it's a lot a little longer but
[38:01] most people are the ones that have tried
[38:03] to uh throw me off or whatever usually
[38:05] within six months or a year
[38:07] and some hang around three or four years
[38:10] but usually within that time they creep
[38:12] in real slowly they get your good graces
[38:15] you know they make friends but then
[38:16] pretty soon they try to bring out a lie
[38:18] they try to bring in a doctrine they try
[38:20] to influence me in a certain a certain
[38:22] kind of a way
[38:23] they creep in real slow
[38:26] at least you got to watch people watch
[38:27] people's lives
[38:28] and we're learning we're learning as
[38:30] yours as years go on we learn by god's
[38:32] grace
[38:33] and you everybody will if you really
[38:34] love god you'll learn to try to catch
[38:36] their spirit like for example how come
[38:38] this person never comes up to for prayer
[38:41] the church that's that's it's not
[38:42] required to come up for prayer but
[38:44] there's we had people come here for
[38:45] years never came up for prayer and now
[38:47] they've left the message and they called
[38:48] brother branham a false prophet and they
[38:50] never came up for prayer one time
[38:52] in five to ten years they were here not
[38:54] one time
[38:56] i never saw them say amen to one word i
[38:58] preached
[39:00] see so we're catching little things
[39:02] there
[39:03] other people they'd always miss service
[39:05] when family visited them from out of
[39:07] town and they'd skip church for family
[39:10] that was a big clue that god wasn't
[39:11] number one in their lives
[39:14] hallelujah look at you guys doing a good
[39:15] job look at that
[39:16] family visits and you're always in the
[39:18] house of god that's awesome that's what
[39:19] i did when my family comes they want to
[39:21] come that's fine but i'm leaving sunday
[39:23] you can sleep in do whatever you want
[39:25] but i'm gone
[39:26] i'll see you on sunday night
[39:29] because god is number one in my life
[39:31] amen
[39:32] but give it a six months
[39:35] or a year amen or three years four years
[39:37] give it some time they're gonna creep in
[39:39] slowly and what they do in jude's day
[39:41] jude was jesus's natural brother now of
[39:43] course it wasn't natural but he was born
[39:44] by the same mom and dad
[39:47] he said these evil men will change the
[39:49] grace they'll turn the grace of god into
[39:51] lasciviousness which means unbridled
[39:53] lust
[40:03] i can never say that one either
[40:05] outrageousness shamelessness insolence
[40:09] in other words just live however you
[40:10] want god's given you grace you can live
[40:12] however you want you're still going to
[40:13] heaven that's a lie
[40:15] that's a doctrine from hell the bible
[40:17] says
[40:18] because men that are going to hell
[40:20] brought it into the church
[40:23] right
[40:26] so that's why you watch those people
[40:27] that say once saved always save you
[40:28] watch them
[40:30] you watch them
[40:32] now let me balance this out now listen
[40:35] once saved always saved is true for
[40:37] every wise virgin
[40:41] because they are predestinated to
[40:42] eternal life but only god knows the
[40:45] future even the wise virgins don't
[40:48] because you're not god
[40:50] i'm going gonna say it again you're not
[40:51] god
[40:53] so you church believe with all your
[40:55] heart you're predestinated but you
[40:57] cannot ever prove it
[41:00] you can't pull out a card and say look i
[41:01] got a card from heaven see says
[41:04] i was saved before the foundation world
[41:05] my name's on the last book of life i'll
[41:07] never fall away you you don't have that
[41:09] there's no proof
[41:10] but let me say it like this your life is
[41:11] proof
[41:12] amen you can't prove it of anything you
[41:15] say anything you can produce but your
[41:17] life will prove which side you're
[41:19] standing on amen
[41:20] hallelujah
[41:23] now also to balance that out the same
[41:26] foolish virgins will always be saved
[41:29] but the difficult thing is this is what
[41:30] i was talking with the brother of this
[41:32] week
[41:32] the difficult thing to understand is
[41:34] that the group like judas is scared were
[41:36] once saved in the foolish virgin group
[41:38] but then they rejected salvation
[41:41] jesus said he brought their names out of
[41:43] the book of life if they didn't overcome
[41:46] so that's why i made this chart jesus
[41:48] said there's four groups there's four
[41:50] kinds of soil
[41:52] the wise virgin have good soil
[41:54] they're the wise versions though their
[41:56] names can never be blotted off
[41:59] the foolish versions their names remain
[42:02] because they
[42:03] were virgin to the word but here this
[42:05] group is a group that their names were
[42:07] written on the book of life but they're
[42:09] blotted out due to their sins like judas
[42:13] so these people used to be in here but
[42:16] then their names are blotted off so but
[42:18] in god's eyes these once saved were
[42:21] always saved in god's eyes
[42:24] are you with me
[42:26] that's a little deeper there
[42:27] it's because well brother jesse i
[42:29] thought you said that once they don't
[42:30] always save isn't right it's not
[42:32] because it doesn't work here
[42:35] but it does work in god's eyes amen
[42:37] hallelujah praise god
[42:39] we don't know
[42:40] who's saved we can't prove it other than
[42:43] our lives
[42:45] does everybody understand
[42:49] and these names were never written on
[42:51] the book of life like pharaoh they never
[42:53] had faith in god they never trusted in
[42:54] god ever but this group the stony ground
[42:57] the jesus said they believe for a while
[42:59] but when the hot sun
[43:01] a persecution or offenses come upon them
[43:04] they wither away and they leave the
[43:06] faith
[43:07] and they believe for a while but they
[43:09] don't believe unto the saving of the
[43:11] soul hallelujah
[43:13] we have four minutes i can't believe
[43:15] that man
[43:16] oh and i'm a little bit i'm happy i'm
[43:18] happy i'm joyful praise god i'm joy i'm
[43:21] joyful now brother this is why i say
[43:23] this
[43:24] only god knows because brother graham
[43:26] said plainly he couldn't prove he was a
[43:28] wise virgin by his own by any human
[43:30] efforts
[43:32] but the ram said when god puts a name on
[43:33] the lamb's book of life before the
[43:34] foundation world there's not nothing in
[43:36] the world can rub it out
[43:38] because this wrote in the ink of the
[43:40] blood of christ
[43:41] so see in that case in god's eyes one
[43:43] saved is always saved in god's eyes
[43:46] he says all children all the church
[43:48] everything there is god by his four
[43:49] knowledge now we now look at this now
[43:51] everybody say we don't know ready let's
[43:52] say ready we don't know we don't know
[43:54] god knows we don't know
[43:56] we've had many people come to our church
[43:58] we thought we're saved filled with the
[43:59] holy ghost and we find out after a while
[44:01] they're not
[44:02] because they love the world more they
[44:03] love the word of god
[44:05] they take antichrist spirits they take
[44:07] prideful spirits and fight against the
[44:09] very message that save them
[44:13] now we don't know you say brother ben
[44:15] can you prove you're there can you prove
[44:17] your names on the lamb's book of life
[44:19] everybody say what does that say yes or
[44:21] no no
[44:23] can i prove to you my name's on the book
[44:24] of life no
[44:26] i can't prove it to you
[44:28] but what's he say i cannot prove it god
[44:30] could use me a tool for something else
[44:32] and you the same way
[44:35] but i believe and the church said
[44:38] but i believe and by faith
[44:42] by faith i am saved amen not by
[44:44] knowledge i'm saying by faith that's the
[44:46] way you're saved that's the way we're
[44:48] all saved hallelujah
[44:52] in other words the bible says always
[44:54] keep the profession of your faith
[44:56] hallelujah like we said never cast away
[44:58] your confidence that you're saying never
[45:00] say you're lost
[45:02] never say uh i'm backslidden you know if
[45:04] you if you can
[45:06] never say i'm uh uh i'm uh i'm not god's
[45:09] child always confess the word of god and
[45:12] church if you speak it and you believe
[45:14] it your body will have to obey your
[45:16] confession
[45:18] yes brother
[45:23] yes because faith is an action
[45:25] faith is a faith is a trust and it's an
[45:28] action
[45:29] yes faith is an action word it's a verb
[45:33] because the bible says by faith abraham
[45:35] left uh the land and possessed the
[45:38] promise of god by faith moses
[45:40] uh chose to suffer with the children of
[45:42] god rather than live with in egypt with
[45:44] all the pleasures of egypt it's by faith
[45:46] faith is an action
[45:48] because
[45:49] the only way i know your faith is to
[45:50] watch your works the bible says faith
[45:53] without works is dead
[45:57] okay every got that that's a good
[45:59] question brother good question
[46:01] because the bible says how can this how
[46:03] can this be true once saved always say
[46:05] when the bible said shall we continue in
[46:07] sin that grace can get greater god
[46:08] forbid
[46:10] in other words don't keep sinning so
[46:12] that well now god's grace is greater now
[46:13] no
[46:14] how shall we now look here's the key
[46:16] right there the people that leave are
[46:18] not dead to their self
[46:20] they're not dead to the world they still
[46:22] love the world amen how are we that are
[46:25] dead to sin live any longer therein if
[46:28] you really love jesus you can't live for
[46:30] sin because sin is what crucified jesus
[46:34] right sin is what took his life so you
[46:36] don't live for sin you're dead to sin
[46:38] and you're you're alive to jesus's life
[46:41] you're alive to truth you're alive to
[46:43] the spirit of god you're alive to the
[46:44] things of god
[46:47] how can you live in sin when you're dead
[46:49] to it amen
[46:53] to come to christ is to die to sin
[46:56] if they know if they never die to sin
[46:58] that's the trouble we've seen brothers
[46:59] people that say they come to christ they
[47:01] if they've never died to sin if they
[47:02] still have sin they've never died to
[47:04] christ and so they've never been saved
[47:08] now is it possible they could have died
[47:10] to sin and got saved and then lose it
[47:12] yes that's what judas did
[47:14] he was justified sanctified but he sold
[47:16] it out and took the bible says satan
[47:18] possessed him
[47:20] satan entered into judas
[47:22] that's a tough pill to swallow but
[47:23] that's the truth
[47:25] church you can in other words you can
[47:26] make it all you can leave egypt make it
[47:27] all the way up to the canaan's land but
[47:29] then turn around and deny it
[47:31] same thing
[47:35] now what's the bible say
[47:36] church the bible says we must perfect
[47:39] holiness in the fear of god there's my
[47:41] 45 minutes let me finish here i didn't
[47:44] get to where i want to go that's good
[47:46] the bible says
[47:47] follow holiness and peace with all men
[47:49] without which no man shall see the lord
[47:52] and then the bible says you can fail the
[47:53] grace of god
[47:56] see how that evil spirit comes in there
[47:58] and says oh everyone's saved once i was
[48:00] saved i'm always saved i can live
[48:01] however i want that's a demonic devil a
[48:04] doctrine of a devil
[48:07] if you just said one prayer i don't care
[48:09] how much you sin you're always saved
[48:10] that's a lie
[48:11] people can lose the anointing of god we
[48:14] saw that on sunday
[48:17] let everyone that names the name of
[48:18] christ depart from a life of iniquity
[48:21] leave that sinful life
[48:23] and every man that is pure everyone that
[48:25] has the hope of seeing jesus in him he
[48:28] purifies himself
[48:30] so brother sister that's what we got to
[48:31] do look at ourselves tonight and say
[48:32] lord make me more pure
[48:35] it's not easy all the time
[48:39] we might not want to feel like it all
[48:40] time but we've got to get in a place of
[48:42] surrender to christ where we can
[48:43] surrender to the holy spirit and let him
[48:46] make us more pure every time we come
[48:48] together amen
[48:52] so now we got five doctrines of devils
[48:54] plainly
[48:55] celibacy vegetarian diet they mandate
[48:58] you know the catholics the rapture is
[48:59] passed no fasting and they turn god's
[49:01] grace into lawlessness everyone's going
[49:04] to heaven
[49:06] once you're saved and say a prayer
[49:07] you're always going to be saved no
[49:08] matter how you live that's a lie
[49:10] and how do they preach it they preach it
[49:11] it's so deceptive it sounds so good what
[49:14] kind of loving god would save somebody
[49:16] than lose them well i'll tell you the
[49:17] kind of loving god that would save judas
[49:19] but then let him let him choose to go
[49:20] away
[49:21] god ain't going to force anybody to go
[49:23] to heaven
[49:24] right that's a loving god that will let
[49:27] you come part of the way and then he
[49:29] loves you enough to give you your free
[49:30] choice to leave him if you want to leave
[49:31] him that's a loving god
[49:33] he won't force you into his presence for
[49:35] eternity unless you want to but then
[49:37] it's not a force right
[49:38] it's not a force
[49:39] it's a freemore agency

[49:48] yeah i better stop i'll get to this
[49:50] sunday
[49:52] so part three lord winning we'll look at
[49:53] all these
[49:56] lies coming out of so-called message
[49:58] churches they call themselves but
[49:59] they're not
[50:01] when they preach great swelling words of
[50:03] vanity
[50:05] and they contradict the word of god it's
[50:07] a lie it's a doctrine of the devil let's
[50:10] stand on our feet and i'm going to close
[50:11] with these scriptures let's stand our
[50:12] feet i'm going to try to give you my
[50:13] word here
[50:17] that's out of the book of
[50:22] second peter
[50:24] it's kind of what i said earlier
[50:27] see the false preachers speak great
[50:29] swelling words of vanity so in other
[50:31] words great words that are meaningless
[50:34] like they make these huge promises to
[50:36] you musicians can come
[50:38] but they're meaningless promises and the
[50:40] bible says
[50:41] it's actually
[50:43] uh alluring them or tempting them
[50:45] through the lust of the flesh
[50:48] and through laziness
[50:51] uh those that were clean escaped from
[50:52] them who live in air and see they
[50:54] promised them all these things but they
[50:56] themselves are the servants of
[50:58] corruption
[51:00] okay so all these great things oh god
[51:02] loves you so god i love you no matter
[51:03] what if you're homosexual not god love
[51:04] you that's a great swelling word of
[51:06] vanity
[51:09] you can lie cuss steal cheat and and
[51:11] you're gonna go to heaven no matter what
[51:13] nonsense
[51:14] or like this one god wants to heal you
[51:16] every time that's totally against the
[51:18] bible
[51:20] you'd be surprised how many people
[51:21] believe that these great swelling words
[51:24] here's what i'm going to say right here
[51:27] is the live stream still on can this be
[51:29] the last thing i see
[51:31] here's what i'm going to share these
[51:32] great swelling words like this like when
[51:34] when the laodicean church goes to heaven
[51:36] everybody's going to come up and we're
[51:38] going to be the celebrity of heaven you
[51:39] know people preach that
[51:41] like everybody's going to oh paul and
[51:42] peter are going to run up to us and say
[51:44] how did you make it you're so great
[51:45] that's a lie
[51:48] that's a great swelling word like look
[51:50] at it i've heard many preachers preach
[51:52] it they even got a song about it
[51:54] it's just this great swelling words of
[51:56] pride it's vanity church there's only
[51:58] one person that we're going to be
[52:00] running to in heaven amen there's only
[52:02] one person i mean worshiping now we
[52:03] might run and greet one another right
[52:05] but there's one person we're gonna
[52:06] worship there's one person that
[52:08] everyone's gonna admire amen
[52:10] that is jesus christ the son of god amen
[52:13] the son of righteousness hallelujah
[52:16] that's a great swelling word of vanity
[52:18] it puffs up the people and i've seen it
[52:20] it makes them lazy
[52:24] it's turning grace into lasciviousness
[52:27] exalting us when the brother and then
[52:29] and then brother abraham even said god
[52:31] didn't say hardly anything good about
[52:33] the laodicean church age except that
[52:34] there were some a few people that were
[52:36] on fire
[52:37] amen praise god i tell you we're not
[52:39] going to be the celebrity of heaven
[52:40] jesus christ is the celebrity of heaven
[52:44] it's pride that's one example now you
[52:45] can stop the live stream god bless you
[52:47] i'm closing with this here just for the
[52:48] saints i'll preach more on this on
[52:50] sunday
