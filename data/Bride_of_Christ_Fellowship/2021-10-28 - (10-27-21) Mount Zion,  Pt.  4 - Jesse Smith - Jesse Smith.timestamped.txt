[17:20] know that's true through the scripture
[17:22] the glory of the latter will be greater
[17:24] than the glory of the former so we thank
[17:25] you god and we give you praise in jesus
[17:28] christ's name and the saint said
[17:30] amen god bless you as being seated
[17:31] praise god
[17:34] i have some slides here let's chill by
[17:36] god's grace
[17:42] all right so lord willing we'll try to
[17:44] finish this series off here
[17:46] by god's grace
[17:53] and lord willing by saturday you know i
[17:55] should have the next audio chapter done
[17:57] i'm working on chapter 8 on the kingdom
[17:58] of heaven right now i'm 91 percent done
[18:01] so hopefully i can have that done by
[18:02] saturday
[18:05] and hopefully that'll be a blessing and
[18:06] i had a couple people reach out this
[18:08] week thank me for doing that i had a
[18:10] brother from norway thanking me for uh
[18:11] this just this morning got email from
[18:13] him and
[18:14] he said thanks for doing those videos
[18:16] about branham tabernacles i said yes sir
[18:17] i said happy to do those and
[18:20] he said but a lot that's swaying a lot
[18:22] of people in norway
[18:24] and he said well i said brother i said i
[18:26] can't come and preach i said you go
[18:27] preach it
[18:28] you got to preach it you know you you do
[18:30] the best you can and so he seemed
[18:32] encouraged
[18:33] and uh the word of god will always set
[18:34] the believer free you know we understand
[18:36] this it's got to be so close
[18:38] it would deceive the very elected if it
[18:39] were possible
[18:40] so what closer could it be right then
[18:43] have the you know the son of the prophet
[18:44] say certain things uh but the prophet
[18:46] pointed us to the word of god that will
[18:49] always be our absolute that'll always be
[18:50] our first love is jesus's words
[18:52] praise god so let's look here tonight
[18:54] we'll try to be uh we'll try to be on
[18:56] time i guess lord willing
[19:00] so we read our text here now i want to
[19:01] just take the first few moments of this
[19:03] sermon and i want to look at these two
[19:05] thoughts
[19:06] that when david instituted these two
[19:08] realities in zion
[19:11] it was foreshadowing the millennium and
[19:13] the future home
[19:15] there are certain truths about the
[19:16] millennium and future home that we see
[19:18] foreshadowed through david's life right
[19:21] and we looked at it on sunday how he put
[19:23] on the ephod you know he saw himself as
[19:26] a pre-figure of the messiah he saw
[19:28] himself i'm a i'm a pre-figure of the
[19:31] kingdom that's to come praise god so he
[19:33] put on an ephod and he was acting like a
[19:35] priest and he could minister right
[19:37] before the ark of god what a what a
[19:39] privilege he wasn't even of the seat of
[19:41] aaron but yet god allowed him as a
[19:43] pre-figure of christ to minister before
[19:46] uh the very arc in church isn't it
[19:47] something we get to minister right in
[19:49] the presence of the holy spirit here
[19:50] today amen praise god there's no one
[19:53] keeping you and i away from the holy
[19:55] spirit right except the enemy when we
[19:57] fall short right so we just got to say
[19:59] sorry and then we're right back in the
[20:00] presence of the lord praise god the
[20:02] bible says that the bible does say that
[20:04] we're as soon as we confess we're right
[20:06] back in the light well what light is
[20:08] that that's the shekinah light amen
[20:10] that's the shekinah light praise god but
[20:12] david when he became king
[20:14] his
[20:16] city of david became the seat of
[20:18] government and authority
[20:20] god's seat for it on earth
[20:23] so you could search the whole earth over
[20:25] and god only had one place where he was
[20:27] going to dwell that was in zion praise
[20:29] god that was in jerusalem that was in
[20:31] the city of david amen
[20:33] and then it also became we ended with
[20:34] this one i didn't spend a whole lot of
[20:35] time on this but it also became the
[20:38] earthly sea of spiritual worship
[20:41] in other words david when he became king
[20:43] he set up the tabernacle and he started
[20:46] ordaining uh musicians to play music to
[20:49] god day and night
[20:51] they didn't have they didn't have i mean
[20:52] some of them would they would go in
[20:53] shifts right uh they'd go in shifts
[20:54] where they would have uh it was it was a
[20:57] priesthood one per month the bible said
[20:59] solomon set it up later where they had
[21:00] one per month so there's one family that
[21:03] would spend a whole month in the temple
[21:04] of god
[21:05] keeping everything going right all the
[21:07] sacrifices all the music well that was
[21:10] inspired by david david said up this
[21:12] family's got january this now they have
[21:14] different names of months thank god
[21:15] because our names and months are named
[21:17] after uh gods right
[21:19] it's so sad
[21:21] greek gods and so forth what a joke but
[21:23] they had their names and they had
[21:25] they had
[21:26] they had one family for each month
[21:29] and so this family
[21:31] the singers would sing and praise god
[21:33] and play instruments 24 hours a day
[21:37] seven days a week praise god and where
[21:39] did david get that inspiration he got
[21:41] that from heaven praise god because the
[21:43] bible said those four creatures they
[21:45] cease not day and night crying holy holy
[21:48] holy is the lord god almighty which was
[21:51] and is and is to come may we join heaven
[21:54] right now by saying holy holy holy is
[21:57] the lord god almighty amen praise god
[22:00] whenever we do that we start joining
[22:01] heaven and then heaven starts coming
[22:03] down to earth amen amen as we praise god
[22:07] as we love god as we give god worship
[22:09] then the spirit of god comes down and we
[22:12] start submitting to the will of god for
[22:14] our lives in other words the more music
[22:16] you play in your home the more sermons
[22:18] you listen to in your home the more
[22:19] heavens will for your life will come
[22:21] down in your home
[22:23] god's will will be done in your home and
[22:25] so it is in the church as well we sing
[22:27] our songs we worship god we join heaven
[22:30] and then heaven's will becomes made
[22:32] known to the church and then we can say
[22:34] amen to it
[22:37] praise god amen but this is what david
[22:39] did
[22:41] he set up god's government on earth
[22:44] and he also set up constant worship
[22:47] on earth now here's my reference he's a
[22:48] pentecostal preacher i don't know if
[22:50] he's alive or not anymore but i used a
[22:52] lot of his thoughts a good thought good
[22:53] good thoughts so let's look at some
[22:55] scriptures that teach this and i just
[22:57] have them up here so uh we don't really
[22:59] have to turn too much in our bibles here
[23:01] this morning this evening sorry
[23:04] so uh here's a scripture we this is our
[23:06] opening scripture god sets his king upon
[23:09] zion
[23:11] he says yet i have set my king upon my
[23:13] holy hill of zion i will declare the
[23:15] decree the lord has said to me thou art
[23:17] my son this day have i begotten thee
[23:20] praise god and we know jesus did that on
[23:22] mount transfiguration right the holy
[23:24] spirit spoke this over jesus on a
[23:26] mountain praise god a mount
[23:28] transfiguration which is i think by the
[23:30] map it was just a little northwest of
[23:33] the actual mount moriah it was just a
[23:35] little bit northwest of that the mount
[23:38] transfiguration in fact all the scholars
[23:39] got question marks where was this
[23:41] mountain
[23:42] amen
[23:43] so it's a little bit interesting about
[23:45] where this mountain was but god it must
[23:47] have been close to zion right because
[23:48] it's connected with zion it must have
[23:50] been very close
[23:51] and god said this day
[23:54] have i begotten thee have i brought thee
[23:56] forth now see church that's how it is
[23:57] with our lives when you have a new birth
[23:59] a new life has brought forth in you
[24:02] when you're born again you don't live
[24:04] the old life it's like a brand new life
[24:06] praise god right it's just like when i
[24:08] remember we watched the video when zion
[24:09] when the kids first saw zion remember
[24:10] watch that i don't know if all of you
[24:12] did we watched the video when they first
[24:13] came down there well a few hours before
[24:15] that zion wasn't there we didn't see him
[24:17] but then after he was born then he was
[24:19] brought forth everybody knew they're all
[24:21] shocked it was a brand new life praise
[24:23] god a life that you never saw before now
[24:26] you saw and that's how it is when you're
[24:28] born again now you live with power now
[24:30] you live with love now you live with
[24:32] mercy now you live with god's grace it's
[24:34] a new life nobody saw before you're born
[24:36] again amen you're begotten hallelujah
[24:39] the actual acts of the word means
[24:41] brought forth amen god has brought forth
[24:44] your true life on this earth amen
[24:47] you never lived it before but after you
[24:49] got the holy ghost now you live it amen
[24:51] it's brought forth
[24:53] and so this was of course fulfilled in
[24:54] jesus day but church we know this is
[24:56] also future
[24:58] for the millennium amen and the future
[25:00] home we'll try to end with that one
[25:01] tonight by god's grace
[25:03] hallelujah so where's god's authority
[25:05] god said it's going to be on zion
[25:09] he'll probably hear his name about 500
[25:11] times tonight
[25:12] next zion is the city of the king priest
[25:14] the lord said to my lord sit down on my
[25:16] right hand shall i make thine enemies
[25:17] thy footstill the lord shall send the
[25:19] rod of thy strength
[25:22] out of zion so the strength comes out of
[25:25] zion comes out of jerusalem rule thou in
[25:29] the midst of thine enemies amen isn't
[25:31] that just like we know uh even
[25:33] governments and businesses they they
[25:35] influence from the top down
[25:38] right however the ceo behaves that's how
[25:40] the rest of the company behaves right
[25:41] that's the direction they're going same
[25:42] thing for a church
[25:44] that's why i like how you live in holy
[25:45] all you saints living holy that proves
[25:47] i'm living holy amen if you live holy
[25:50] that proves i'm living holy because the
[25:51] influence goes from the top down praise
[25:53] god
[25:54] remember i'm not so so so top at all i'm
[25:57] still a sinner saved by grace in other
[25:59] words we don't we don't i'm just a minor
[26:02] shepherd i'm a little pebble shepherd on
[26:04] the beach but jesus christ is the one
[26:06] great stone amen hallelujah he's a great
[26:09] stone we're all looking towards praise
[26:11] god
[26:12] amen
[26:13] so that's how it is today uh that's how
[26:15] it is you know in the spiritual right uh
[26:18] the word the strength flows out of
[26:20] heaven amen it flows down to earth
[26:22] praise god like when brother cam was
[26:24] here when brother randy was here i don't
[26:26] know about you but brother diggs is here
[26:28] i feel strengthened i feel like i leave
[26:29] out of here stronger than when i came
[26:32] now what happened was there anything
[26:33] different about the room did we change
[26:35] the paint and now everything looks a
[26:36] little better matches the seats we
[26:38] didn't change that but god's strength
[26:40] came down from zion amen
[26:43] god's word descended down from the
[26:45] spiritual zion and strength flowed out
[26:48] of god's throne amen
[26:50] and we leave here feeling stronger
[26:52] praise god
[26:53] because that's what the bible ordains
[26:55] but one day sister brother that's going
[26:57] to be physical it's going to flow right
[27:00] out of jesus christ's mouth amen this
[27:02] can you imagine him sitting there he sit
[27:04] there in the millennium he'll give a
[27:05] decree and they'll put that iron rod
[27:07] down and everybody will listen and the
[27:10] influence will go around the world amen
[27:12] for a thousand years hallelujah
[27:14] amen it's gonna flow
[27:17] out of zion the strength of god
[27:19] hallelujah amen so as you meet with our
[27:22] lives right people should feel the
[27:24] strength of god flowing out of us
[27:26] amen as long as we're in touch with that
[27:28] kingdom from zion like the bible says
[27:31] refuse him not the bible says zion is
[27:34] the city where the king forever dwells
[27:38] so we got to wonder what wonder what
[27:39] god's address is going to be after a few
[27:41] million years we don't have to wonder
[27:42] church
[27:44] god tells us he said the lord shall
[27:46] reign forever even thy god o zion unto
[27:50] all generations praise ye the lord
[27:53] so god's dwelling place will be there
[27:55] that will be his earthly home praise god
[27:58] his his heavenly hope will come down to
[28:00] earth and god will dwell there forever
[28:04] now next let's move to this next thought
[28:06] now all these verses deal with the
[28:08] constant worship that comes out of zion
[28:11] after this i should hear some amens and
[28:14] some praises i should hear some shouts i
[28:16] should hear some lovely laughter
[28:18] i should hear some joy after some of
[28:19] these
[28:20] hallelujah because that's where joy
[28:23] comes from that's where praise flows it
[28:26] flows out of zion amen
[28:28] strength comes from it praise comes from
[28:31] it all that we are comes from zion amen
[28:34] because that's god's dwelling place
[28:36] hallelujah
[28:38] so the first one is zion is the place of
[28:40] the lord dwells sing praises to the lord
[28:43] which dwelleth in zion now right now
[28:46] it's in heaven right because it's the
[28:47] spiritual side
[28:49] declare among the people his doings
[28:53] so we're told to praise him and we're
[28:56] told to declare uh amongst the people is
[28:58] doing so like after school today i
[29:00] picked up the milk from the uh from our
[29:01] friend's house right and their daughter
[29:03] their grandparents but their daughter's
[29:05] having a baby soon and i said don't be
[29:07] discouraged i said something like that i
[29:08] said don't fear i said god will take
[29:10] care of that
[29:11] i said no matter when it comes god will
[29:13] take care of it i got to tell the
[29:14] testimony of when zion came
[29:16] and uh
[29:18] how you know we knew we knew he was
[29:20] coming and my wife called the midwife
[29:21] and she couldn't come or she couldn't
[29:23] make it on time so my wife was able to
[29:26] deliver the baby all by herself
[29:28] and then she handed it to me and then
[29:29] the
[29:30] uh
[29:30] then the the lady got there later the
[29:32] the what they call it the
[29:34] midwife there's that word
[29:36] midwife that's what happens when i'm
[29:38] tired i'll forget words i'll say things
[29:40] backwards
[29:42] but anyways i just told that testimony
[29:44] and i told her i told them how god will
[29:46] take care of it
[29:47] i said you can plan everything fine but
[29:49] it ain't always going to work to your
[29:50] plans
[29:51] unless god told you in advance right so
[29:54] you got to be ready and you just got to
[29:55] trust god that god will take care of it
[29:58] amen
[29:59] and i said god even gave us the name of
[30:01] zion before he was born because my wife
[30:03] had the dream she in the dream she had
[30:05] the baby herself hand the baby to me and
[30:07] said here's your son zion jesse that's
[30:09] exactly what happened
[30:11] because god always foretells the future
[30:13] right if we're humble enough to hear now
[30:14] we don't hear it all the time i'd like
[30:15] to hear more praise god that's one time
[30:17] we can clearly see because my wife had
[30:19] the baby hand it to me
[30:21] so then she could you know move on and
[30:23] we could start the clean cleanup process
[30:25] uh but that's what i was trying i'm just
[30:27] trying to witness and this is what god
[30:29] does
[30:30] god prepares you god provides for you
[30:33] god wants to take care of you praise god
[30:35] he dwells from zion he wants to hear
[30:38] your praises amen he wants to hear you
[30:40] testify praise god he wants to hear you
[30:43] be thankful for what's flowed out of
[30:45] zion hallelujah
[30:46] that's where he dwells that's his house
[30:50] next it's the place of salvation where
[30:52] did you get saved brother it wasn't
[30:54] ghana it was zion
[30:57] where'd i get saved it wasn't actually
[30:58] columbus it was actually zion amen
[31:01] spiritual zion because the bible said oh
[31:04] that salvation of israel will come out
[31:05] of zion when the lord brings back the
[31:08] captivity of his people jacob shall
[31:10] rejoice and israel shall be glad amen
[31:14] let me go back to that picture where did
[31:15] you get saved church let's see i'm on
[31:17] slide 10. let me go way back to the
[31:19] beginning that's going to be seem crazy
[31:20] but hopefully i can find it you were
[31:23] saved at one of these mountains there it
[31:24] is look at how i found it so fast which
[31:26] mount were you saying that we say that
[31:28] the law where you're just everything was
[31:30] a fearful or were you saved at the place
[31:32] of grace amen
[31:34] we saved at the place where you looked
[31:36] up and you saw you saw the lamb of god
[31:38] taking away your sin praise god and you
[31:41] wept and you cried that's where i was
[31:43] saved on mosiah amen
[31:46] not mount sinai where there's law and
[31:49] death but i was saved on zion where
[31:51] there's life amen
[31:54] hallelujah praise god where there's
[31:56] mercy where there's grace where there's
[31:58] deliverance praise god where there's
[32:00] power amen
[32:02] hallelujah that's where i was saying
[32:04] praise god that israel is blinded right
[32:07] that's why this scripture is prophetic
[32:09] they're blinded their salvation is going
[32:11] to come to mount zion literally but
[32:13] we've inherited a spiritual zion amen
[32:16] we've come to a mountain that cannot be
[32:19] moved amen hallelujah this one cannot be
[32:22] moved praise god this is the better
[32:24] mountain with better promises
[32:27] glory praise god
[32:29] that's where i was born i don't know
[32:30] about you that's why i was saved i know
[32:32] i know i shouldn't say that i know you
[32:34] that i know you know that
[32:35] sorry sometimes i sometimes get that
[32:37] visiting preacher mode you know i don't
[32:39] know about you guys but i know about our
[32:40] church praise god we're saints
[32:42] hallelujah by the grace of god only by
[32:44] god's grace
[32:46] hallelujah so that's the place of
[32:48] salvation
[32:50] god brings us out of captivity and then
[32:53] we rejoice and we're glad
[32:56] hallelujah
[32:57] so we realize we're saved
[33:00] and then we rejoice we're happy we
[33:02] praise the lord we can't let this world
[33:04] discourage us
[33:06] we can't be discouraged by things that
[33:08] don't seem like they're going our way we
[33:10] can't just let those things get us down
[33:11] we must remember where our salvation
[33:14] came it came from heaven praise god and
[33:17] that ruler there he doesn't lose a term
[33:19] he can't be voted out praise god amen he
[33:22] can't be complained against he can't be
[33:24] he can't be wrong amen he can't die
[33:26] hallelujah he's only going to live and
[33:29] he's going to declare that you're more
[33:30] than a conqueror in his name amen
[33:34] nobody can get rid of him praise god
[33:36] he's not up for a vote
[33:38] hallelujah
[33:40] that's where i got my salvation
[33:42] you did too
[33:44] isaiah 59 20 and the redeemer shall come
[33:47] to
[33:48] zion and unto them that turn from
[33:50] transgression and jacob saint the lord

[33:54] jesus is coming to israel to bring to

[34:00] on the 144 blind jews and they're going
[34:02] to recognize we crucified our
[34:04] messiah but then there's going to be the
[34:06] bible said a fountain opened in the
[34:08] house of david
[34:09] amen a fountain of forgiveness and
[34:12] cleansing and the holy spirit washing
[34:15] praise god

[38:02] the sun unto the going down thereof out
[38:04] of zion the perfection of beauty
[38:07] god has shined
[38:09] there's something about this place
[38:12] it's the perfection of beauty in the
[38:14] eyes of god you have two raised up
[38:16] mountains you have valleys down there
[38:18] and it's just land locked right in
[38:20] between uh between egypt and the middle
[38:22] east whereas
[38:24] it's only water sources are those
[38:25] springs that spring up
[38:27] they've got to depend on god to send the
[38:29] rain they've got to have real
[38:30] relationship with god they've got to
[38:32] live in the blessings of god amen it's
[38:34] just placed beautifully the bible said i
[38:36] don't even understand it all but i know
[38:38] what the bible says about it
[38:40] it's the perfection of beauty
[38:43] where god has shined upon that land
[38:46] amen
[38:49] this place where god is praised
[38:52] that's why i like when brother cam comes
[38:54] or and the brothers they say you guys
[38:55] got really good worship going on that's
[38:57] a blessing to my heart praise god that
[38:59] should it should be with us because we
[39:01] should be in touch with the spiritual
[39:02] zion
[39:03] because the bible says praise waits for
[39:05] you in zion
[39:07] amen in other words god uh you're gonna
[39:10] when we gather together you're gonna be
[39:12] praised
[39:13] lord you're really going to be worshiped
[39:15] we're really going to tell you we love
[39:16] you in our song service amen hallelujah
[39:19] it waits for you in zion right in this
[39:22] kingdom in the city where god is
[39:25] worshipped in other words praise waits
[39:26] for you and bride of christ's fellowship
[39:29] amen why because we're a part of the
[39:30] kingdom of god the baptism of the holy
[39:33] ghost that's where god's praise waits
[39:35] for him in the bride
[39:37] glory praise god
[39:39] and unto thee shall the vow be performed
[39:41] in other words god will keep his word to
[39:43] us
[39:44] oh thou that hears prayer unto thee
[39:46] shall all flesh come now speaking of the
[39:48] millennium
[39:49] right and the new jerusalem
[39:51] all flesh is going to come to jerusalem
[39:54] right praise god
[39:56] right there at the uh
[39:58] right before the battle of armageddon
[39:59] they're all going to come against it
[40:01] right and jesus is going to destroy him
[40:02] for coming against jerusalem
[40:05] but once we get in the millennium where
[40:06] there's a thousand years of peace all
[40:09] flesh will come unto him and we'll get
[40:10] to that here soon
[40:12] zion is the place god loved and chose
[40:16] look at this moreover now look at this
[40:17] church he refused the tabernacle of
[40:19] joseph
[40:21] and chose not the tribe of ephraim now
[40:24] how many know joseph's a pretty holy man
[40:26] in the bible
[40:27] he's a he's almost a perfect type of
[40:29] christ almost
[40:32] and we're going to get to that maybe
[40:33] next week i'll study on that today
[40:35] only judah and joseph have the same
[40:38] amount of blessings amongst the 12 boys
[40:41] they have just amazing blessings it's
[40:43] like all blessings
[40:45] because they love god so well but the
[40:47] scripture says i would not even put my
[40:49] tabernacle in joseph
[40:52] i won't put my tabernacle and his son
[40:54] ephraim
[40:55] but i chose the tribe of judah mount
[40:58] zion which he loved
[41:01] hallelujah and he built a sanctuary like
[41:03] high palaces like the earth which he
[41:05] hath established forever he chose david
[41:08] also his servant and took him from the
[41:10] sheepfolds
[41:12] in other words god looked at all the
[41:14] other places said this is nice this is
[41:15] pretty good this is pretty good but i
[41:17] like this one this is the place i really
[41:19] love praise god amen how many know god
[41:22] did that as well with you
[41:25] praise god he looked at all the people
[41:26] down through time and said who's going
[41:28] to love me who's really going to love me
[41:30] oh they're going to love me i'm going to
[41:31] wake away i can make myself known to
[41:33] them i'm going to bless them i'm going
[41:35] to keep them my face is going to shine
[41:37] upon them amen hallelujah that's what
[41:40] the bible said dearly beloved praise god
[41:42] the bible said but god rich in mercy
[41:45] where in his great love he hath loved us
[41:48] oh god's love is so great church many
[41:50] times we can't even understand it may
[41:52] god help us to know the length the
[41:54] breadth the width and the height of
[41:56] god's love amen
[41:58] four dimensions of this love
[42:00] maybe seven i never thought about that
[42:02] till now
[42:05] all the places he could have chose he
[42:06] could have chose akron we said he could
[42:08] have chose jeffersonville he could have
[42:09] chose all these you could
[42:11] could have chosen ephraim but he chose
[42:13] jerusalem
[42:15] in judah which means praise
[42:17] his home is in praise there it is praise
[42:20] god may god find praise in this home
[42:22] right here
[42:23] may we be a house of judah
[42:25] a house of praise where he can dwell
[42:29] amen
[42:30] it's the place he loved more than any
[42:32] other place
[42:35] see that's why i was remember we
[42:36] preached that a few years ago god does
[42:37] have favorites
[42:39] right but it's based upon those who keep
[42:41] his commandments
[42:43] right god loves everybody but he has to
[42:45] have a favor it's like a husband has his
[42:47] wife that's his favorite
[42:48] right just like your children your
[42:50] children are your favorite my children
[42:51] aren't your favorite your children are
[42:53] your favorite
[42:54] right
[42:56] that's just how it is god gives us we
[42:57] call them special relationships and god
[43:00] loves this place more than any other
[43:02] places amen
[43:04] his foundations is in the holy mountains
[43:06] the lord loveth the gates of zion more
[43:09] than all the dwellings of jacob all the
[43:12] other 11 sons he said i like judah's
[43:15] location i like zion i like jerusalem
[43:18] better than all of them
[43:20] i like salem peace
[43:23] amen i like peace more than all of them
[43:26] i like peace amongst the believers
[43:28] didn't the bible say that how good
[43:30] impression is for brethren to dwell in
[43:32] unity
[43:33] how many years brother have you seen
[43:34] where there's been disunity amongst
[43:36] believers
[43:37] how many years how many years have
[43:39] staying on my mind right my mind where
[43:41] i've seen brothers be in disunity rather
[43:43] than unity it just brings reproach
[43:46] right
[43:47] but if the people cry out to god what
[43:49] happens strength flows out of zion
[43:53] if people really repent and people
[43:55] really want the blessings of god if they
[43:56] really want to praise god and serve god
[43:58] they'll cry out to god and the strength
[44:00] of god will flow from spiritual zion
[44:03] down into the churches and churches will
[44:05] have renewed fellowship
[44:07] amen
[44:08] that's right
[44:10] because remember you don't only conserve
[44:12] one or two masters
[44:14] either love one and hate the one or love
[44:16] the one and hate the other
[44:18] we gotta love if we love jesus christ
[44:20] we'll love his people
[44:22] that's right
[44:24] now look at this brother
[44:26] i'm sure you've seen this before but
[44:28] it's been a while since i've looked at
[44:29] it i was surprised
[44:30] zion is the place of births
[44:34] births this has to be the millennium
[44:36] right the bible said a child may die a
[44:38] hundred years old
[44:40] in the millennium and of zion it shall
[44:42] be said this and that man was born in
[44:45] her
[44:46] and the highest himself shall establish
[44:48] her that's jesus christ right the
[44:50] highest jesus christ
[44:52] the lord shall count when he writeth up
[44:54] the people that this man was born there
[44:57] sila brother brahm uses this scripture
[44:59] the church age book to say there's one
[45:01] more roll call in the new jerusalem
[45:03] there's gonna be one more time where god
[45:04] writes down names and he says it's a
[45:06] fresh list of the names of all the
[45:09] people that live in the holy city amen
[45:11] praise god how do you how many believe
[45:13] your names on that list amen hallelujah
[45:16] and like brother william and i were
[45:17] saying on sunday if you're if you have
[45:19] any doubt just talk about jesus more
[45:21] because the bible says the more you talk
[45:22] about jesus the angels write it down in
[45:25] a book of remembrance and god has
[45:27] rewards for you waiting in heaven praise
[45:28] god
[45:30] hallelujah that's right that's book of
[45:32] malachi says that
[45:35] god is going to write the names of all
[45:37] the dwellers in the new jerusalem mount
[45:39] zion
[45:42] this man was born here this one was born
[45:44] here this one was born here
[45:48] zion is the place where the lord reigns
[45:50] the lord reigneth now remember i told
[45:52] you church there's 156 times the word
[45:54] zion is used in the old testament so i
[45:56] can only scratch the surface 156
[46:00] and that's not even the jerusalem words
[46:02] which would probably be uh hundreds more
[46:06] let the people tremble he sits between
[46:08] the cherubims let the earth be moved the
[46:11] lord is great in zion and he is high
[46:14] above all the people
[46:16] everybody say oh oh he's higher than
[46:18] brother branham
[46:19] he's higher than martin luther he's
[46:21] higher than john wesley praise god he's
[46:23] higher than paul
[46:24] he's higher than peter he's the highest
[46:26] one he's the only great one in that city
[46:29] praise god there are 24 thrones right
[46:32] but there's one throne that's higher
[46:34] than all of them amen those 24 thrones
[46:36] answer to one throne that's the king's
[46:38] throne
[46:40] the great king jesus christ
[46:44] let them praise thy great and terrible
[46:46] name for it is holy let's all say praise
[46:48] the lord ready praise the lord the bible
[46:50] said praise that great and terrible that
[46:53] powerful name hallelujah thank you jesus
[46:55] praise god
[46:56] just speak that holy name amen it's a
[46:59] great powerful name hallelujah
[47:01] heaven responds to it amen strength will
[47:04] come out of zion if you speak that holy
[47:06] name praise god
[47:10] zion is the place where the lord appears
[47:12] in glory
[47:15] now brother i'm really looking forward
[47:16] to this one brother
[47:18] hallelujah i've gone my whole life i've
[47:19] never seen the pillar of fire but one
[47:21] day church the pillar of fire is going
[47:23] to be seen all day amen and all night
[47:25] amen and all throughout hundreds and
[47:28] thousands and millions and ages and
[47:30] years and decades
[47:32] and epochs whatever they call epochs
[47:34] whatever they call it the glory of god
[47:36] will be visible amen we don't have to
[47:38] feel bad we didn't see the pillar of
[47:40] fire with moses we don't have to feel
[47:41] bad we didn't see the purifier with
[47:43] brother ram we got to be thankful that
[47:45] we'll live in eternity by the pillar of
[47:47] fire
[47:49] [Music]
[47:51] the hallelujah says thou shalt arise and
[47:53] have mercy upon zion for the time to
[47:55] favor her yay the set time it's come
[47:57] right now israel's not really favored
[48:00] right all the world is against her but
[48:02] there's coming a time when god's gonna
[48:04] start favoring her
[48:07] when the lord shall build up zion see
[48:08] right now the man their men are trying
[48:10] to build it up but there's coming a time
[48:12] when the lord will build up zion and
[48:13] he'll appear in his glory
[48:20] it's the place where the lord's name is
[48:21] declared and praised to declare the name
[48:24] of the lord in zion and praise and i'm
[48:27] sorry and his praise in jerusalem
[48:30] so it's the name where you feel there's
[48:32] a place where you feel the name the
[48:33] authority the power of jesus christ's
[48:36] name as a place where you praise him
[48:39] that's what zion is in other words it's
[48:41] all about jesus and it's all praising
[48:43] jesus all the time sounds like a good
[48:45] church service
[48:46] i don't know it sounds like our lives
[48:47] should be like that as well amen
[48:50] it's the place of blessing how we want
[48:51] to be blessed
[48:53] the lord shall bless thee where
[48:55] out of zion and thou shalt see the good
[48:58] of jerusalem all the day
[49:01] every day i'm going to see god's
[49:02] blessings upon my life amen

[53:53] they couldn't sing the songs of what
[53:55] zion

[53:57] that means the songs of zion are
[53:59] victorious songs
[54:01] and you can't sing them out in captivity
[54:03] you only sing the songs of zion with the
[54:05] blessing of god with the strength of god
[54:08] with the word of god
[54:10] amen
[54:12] that's why some churches don't sing
[54:13] victoria's songs because they're not
[54:14] getting victory praise god but god with
[54:17] victory should be singing victorious
[54:19] songs
[54:21] and everlasting joy shall be upon their
[54:24] head i can't wait till some of these

[1:01:45] big
[1:01:46] the new city which is the holy mountain
[1:01:48] will sit on this mountain
[1:01:50] brother braham said it in the earth's
[1:01:52] time of purifying by its fire and
[1:01:53] baptism there will be a volcanic such as
[1:01:55] the earth exploding and will push up a
[1:01:58] pyramid-like mountain did you hear that
[1:02:00] there's going to be a volcanic explosion
[1:02:03] in jerusalem brother
[1:02:05] and it's gonna be so big
[1:02:07] imagine the lava and the ash flowing up
[1:02:09] and uh it's gonna spew all this magma
[1:02:12] out it's gonna or lava it's gonna turn
[1:02:14] to magma right when it gets outside the
[1:02:15] earth and it's gonna build up it's gonna
[1:02:17] keep spewing until it builds up this
[1:02:19] huge mountain and that's just the bottom
[1:02:22] of the mountain that's coming praise god
[1:02:24] i didn't hear you praise god because
[1:02:25] then heaven's mountain comes down and
[1:02:27] rests on that mountain amen hallelujah
[1:02:31] the earth bringing forth all this lava
[1:02:35] to make a platform for god's home for
[1:02:37] his bride
[1:02:38] that's where i'm going to live
[1:02:41] that's my eternal address praise god
[1:02:45] plenty of room to do it
[1:02:47] the whole thing will be changed the
[1:02:48] whole surface will be changing got it
[1:02:50] it'll push up like a pyramid mountain
[1:02:52] this would be exactly with the word if
[1:02:54] it does which it will remember isaiah 65
[1:02:57] 25 they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[1:03:00] all my holy mountain saith the lord
[1:03:04] now i don't have time for that one
[1:03:06] okay so this is what happens
[1:03:08] there's all these uh there's all these
[1:03:10] volcanic volcanic explosions and god
[1:03:13] raises up those previous mountains that
[1:03:15] are there right zion and all these
[1:03:17] uh
[1:03:18] and moriah and mount olives he
[1:03:22] gushes up remember church they had a
[1:03:23] earthquake there when jesus rose from
[1:03:25] the dead
[1:03:26] so there must be some fault there right
[1:03:27] there must be some fall where they can
[1:03:30] uh
[1:03:30] the plates can slide in and out and
[1:03:32] there's lava waiting right under there
[1:03:34] praise god amen
[1:03:36] and when the time is right
[1:03:38] the plates will slide and all this
[1:03:40] volcanic ash will come up and all this
[1:03:42] lava and it will build up this platform
[1:03:45] and then the city of god will come down
[1:03:47] out of heaven as a bride prepared for
[1:03:50] its bridegroom amen
[1:03:52] it's a wedding amen it's a wedding of
[1:03:55] heaven and earth amen
[1:03:57] hallelujah this is how god marries the
[1:03:59] earth to heaven
[1:04:01] hallelujah
[1:04:04] glory
[1:04:06] the new city is a mountain
[1:04:08] on top of a mountain
[1:04:11] sounds familiar like word on top of word
[1:04:14] on top of word
[1:04:16] from glory on top of glory on top of
[1:04:18] glory from faith on top of faith on top
[1:04:20] of faith praise god
[1:04:22] amen brother they said it's brother adam
[1:04:24] explain isaiah 2 verse 2 yes i did the
[1:04:27] house of the lord shall be established
[1:04:28] in the top of the mountains and all
[1:04:29] nations shall flow into it
[1:04:33] this is what we just read earlier
[1:04:36] it shall come to pass in verse 2 the
[1:04:37] last days that the mount in the lord's
[1:04:39] house shall be established in the top of
[1:04:41] the mountains and shall be exalted above
[1:04:42] the hills and all nations
[1:04:45] shall flow into it and that's where god
[1:04:47] will teach us his ways
[1:04:48] and we will walk
[1:04:50] in his past aren't you glad church
[1:04:52] you'll never make a step out of god's
[1:04:53] will there
[1:04:55] glory we do it here often don't we we'll
[1:04:57] take a misstep here i knew i should not
[1:04:59] have done that lord forgive me why did i
[1:05:01] do that but there
[1:05:03] no no everything's going to be perfect
[1:05:05] god jesus christ will rule he'll send
[1:05:07] forth his word and we'll obey it praise
[1:05:09] god there'll be nothing there to stop us
[1:05:11] from obeying it praise god we'll carry
[1:05:14] out every command amen
[1:05:16] without a flaw we'll walk in the ways of
[1:05:19] god in the light of the word amen
[1:05:21] hallelujah there's no devil there to
[1:05:23] stop us
[1:05:25] there's no devil to tempt us to leave
[1:05:27] the past of god
[1:05:33] then the bible says there's a light at
[1:05:34] the top of this mountain it's typed by
[1:05:37] mount sinai mount transfiguration the
[1:05:39] bible says the city had no need of the
[1:05:40] sun neither the moon to shine in it for
[1:05:42] the glory of the lord did lighten it and
[1:05:44] the lamb
[1:05:45] is the light thereof
[1:05:47] but said notice mount sinai was where
[1:05:49] god depended descended on top of it he
[1:05:51] spoke to israel a pillar of fire he
[1:05:52] descended on top of a mountain mount
[1:05:54] zion on mount transfiguration when he
[1:05:56] declared this is my beloved son here he
[1:05:58] him he descended a pillar of light and
[1:06:00] shining brightness upon the top of the
[1:06:02] mountain both peter before peter james
[1:06:04] and john and in there he was represented
[1:06:05] with both moses and elijah and
[1:06:07] translated the dead raised glory
[1:06:12] the light is from the top of the throne
[1:06:14] at the top of the mountain
[1:06:18] the lamb is the light thereof and he
[1:06:20] showed me a pure river of uh of water of
[1:06:23] life clear as crystal remember we're
[1:06:24] talking about that foreign proceeding
[1:06:26] out of the throne of god and of the lamb
[1:06:29] now picture this a throne
[1:06:31] but water flows from the throne
[1:06:34] what kind of throne is that
[1:06:36] a throne and water clear water throws
[1:06:39] flows out of the throne oh i can't wait
[1:06:42] to see it i can only imagine
[1:06:45] hallelujah
[1:06:46] that's the lamb's throne
[1:06:48] so i got my generic picture right that's
[1:06:50] jesus on the throne
[1:06:52] right he'll be there he'll be shining
[1:06:54] the light of god light will flow out of
[1:06:56] them not just light supposed to be

[1:07:12] the newer city and the new earth the new
[1:07:14] creation this is mount zion the city of
[1:07:16] the hill with the throne in the top of
[1:07:17] it the throne up here on top the
[1:07:19] dwellers all up and down on this

[1:08:08] drive home i see jesus at the park i see
[1:08:10] jesus in my house i see jesus in my
[1:08:12] family let's see jesus everywhere amen
[1:08:16] this is the a reality of the christians
[1:08:19] who are born again and love the lord
[1:08:25] picture of something like this jesus on
[1:08:27] the throne and all the lights coming out
[1:08:29] of him
[1:08:32] and he got the pillar of fire there too
[1:08:35] the man said on top of mount zion will
[1:08:37] set the lamb and the city will need no
[1:08:39] light for the lamb is the light thereof
[1:08:41] you have to say sister beatrice can you
[1:08:43] turn on the light real quick
[1:08:45] you want to say that brother
[1:08:47] can you light the oil lamp real quick
[1:08:49] you won't need that
[1:08:51] darling can you turn the light don't
[1:08:52] need that
[1:08:54] the lamb is the light thereof amen what
[1:08:56] a light i imagine brother just goes
[1:08:58] through the walls i imagine it's
[1:08:59] something like that
[1:09:00] it just shines through every wall it's
[1:09:03] just such a powerful light amen
[1:09:08] and above the lamb above the lamb will
[1:09:10] be the
[1:09:11] father
[1:09:12] which is the logos
[1:09:14] god the great light the great eternal
[1:09:16] light that will shine
[1:09:17] just above the throne and jesus will not
[1:09:19] be on the father's throne
[1:09:21] he'll be on his throne
[1:09:24] glory and the father will hover over the
[1:09:26] sun
[1:09:27] which the father and son will be one
[1:09:31] where is this taking place in zion where
[1:09:34] the father and son are one
[1:09:38] this is the time once we get there this
[1:09:40] is the time the kingdom is committed
[1:09:42] back to the father from the son
[1:09:45] and while they're yet speaking i'll
[1:09:46] answer before they can think i'll think
[1:09:48] for them that's right jesus will commit
[1:09:49] a perfect age to a perfect living god
[1:09:52] that he has redeemed and give over to
[1:09:54] the father
[1:09:55] is that right we'll turn to god the
[1:09:57] father which is spirit not a man a
[1:09:59] spirit
[1:10:00] all nature of goodness gathered together
[1:10:03] that's god
[1:10:05] so somehow jesus is going to be on that
[1:10:06] throne and he's going to commit he's
[1:10:09] maybe say something like this i commit
[1:10:10] this kingdom
[1:10:12] my kingdom back to my father the bible
[1:10:15] says he does that when all enemies are
[1:10:17] under his feet
[1:10:19] what a mystery
[1:10:20] right praise god isn't that the mystery
[1:10:22] of the godhead it's not so much
[1:10:24] sun and holy ghost or father and holy
[1:10:26] ghost it's more father and
[1:10:28] son the mystery of a son completely
[1:10:32] yielded to the father's spirit
[1:10:36] and he yields any he rules in such a way
[1:10:38] for those thousand years and after the
[1:10:40] white throne judgment that he can say i
[1:10:41] now put every enemy under me now i'm
[1:10:44] giving it back to the father
[1:10:47] hallelujah
[1:10:50] describe it
[1:10:52] impossible
[1:10:55] long for it
[1:10:57] every day
[1:10:58] praise god
[1:10:59] it's impossible to describe it but it's
[1:11:01] still reality
[1:11:04] the city with the throne and top
[1:11:06] revelation 21 23 and they need no light
[1:11:08] for the lamb and the lord god is the
[1:11:10] light thereof see the lord god is the
[1:11:11] pillar of fire that father the children
[1:11:13] of israel through the wilderness and he
[1:11:14] is ascended up on the throne in that
[1:11:16] perfect kingdom when the kingdom that
[1:11:18] jesus is surrendered to the father that
[1:11:20] god might be all and in all let's read
[1:11:23] in your bible i got your bible
[1:11:24] uh yeah i can put up here sorry first
[1:11:27] corinthians 15.
[1:11:28] been a while since i preached that let
[1:11:29] me preach it out there
[1:11:32] first corinthians 15.
[1:11:35] you ever wonder about that this i
[1:11:36] learned about the scripture for a long
[1:11:38] time then i heard a
[1:11:39] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:11:51] i'm going to find it here
[1:11:53] write that one down there it is yeah
[1:11:57] go to verse 25 i'm sorry go to verse 24
[1:12:00] then come at the end what is the end
[1:12:03] the end is where jesus gives the kingdom
[1:12:05] back to the father
[1:12:07] then come at the end when he shall
[1:12:08] deliver up the kingdom to god even the
[1:12:10] father when he shall put down all rule
[1:12:12] and all authority and power so that's
[1:12:15] right after the white throne judgment
[1:12:16] right death and hell are cast in lake of
[1:12:18] fire all the all the sinners are cast
[1:12:20] alive lake of fire after that after the
[1:12:22] future home comes then god then christ
[1:12:24] can commit it back to the father
[1:12:28] for he must reign till he hath put all
[1:12:30] enemies under his feet
[1:12:33] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[1:12:35] is death
[1:12:36] for hath put all things under his feet
[1:12:38] but when he saith all things are put
[1:12:40] under him it is manifest that he is
[1:12:42] expected which did put all things under
[1:12:44] him
[1:12:46] it is evident
[1:12:48] and when all things shall be subdued
[1:12:49] unto him then shall the son also himself
[1:12:51] be subject unto him that put all things
[1:12:54] under him that god may be all
[1:12:58] in all
[1:13:00] so god only becomes all in all once
[1:13:03] jesus has put every enemy under his feet
[1:13:05] and saying father here i give the
[1:13:07] kingdom back to you
[1:13:09] now god is in all
[1:13:11] and is all
[1:13:13] praise god is that a mystery absolutely
[1:13:17] but the scripture says it's true
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:20] jesus must rule until this moment and
[1:13:22] then he hands the kingdom back over to
[1:13:24] the father
[1:13:27] what's going to happen after that i
[1:13:28] don't know but i know it's going to be
[1:13:29] glorious
[1:13:30] that's all i know it's going to be pure
[1:13:32] joy pure peace pure love
[1:13:34] just
[1:13:35] the beauty pure beauty it's going to be
[1:13:37] just glorious
[1:13:39] yeah i had the scripture right there i
[1:13:40] didn't even need i didn't know that
[1:13:42] i forgot about that
[1:13:45] all right i'm just finished
[1:13:47] this is what's going to look like from
[1:13:48] outer space church
[1:13:52] brother william you could put this on a
[1:13:53] real estate page
[1:13:55] and that's going to be our home someday
[1:13:57] but it ain't for sale
[1:13:59] it's a free gift amen
[1:14:01] praise god that's our home praise god
[1:14:05] coming right out of
[1:14:06] zion right this is the new zion
[1:14:10] the heavenly zion come down to earth
[1:14:13] 1500 miles in the air
[1:14:16] and jesus will be at the top of course
[1:14:18] they don't have jesus right there that's
[1:14:19] a shame but maybe let's wait until the
[1:14:21] later part of his
[1:14:22] later part
[1:14:23] from the coming rain
[1:14:25] that's
[1:14:26] the new mount zion coming down from
[1:14:28] heaven
[1:14:31] one thousand five hundred miles is from
[1:14:34] maine to florida that's how wide this
[1:14:37] city is going to be
[1:14:39] one thousand five hundred it's the same
[1:14:41] it's the same height width and and depth
[1:14:44] it's one thousand five hundred miles all
[1:14:46] directions
[1:14:48] right so it's it's almost 1600 miles
[1:14:50] from the capital maine to florida
[1:14:54] it's a
[1:14:55] and this city is one thousand five
[1:14:56] hundred miles length that's a new city
[1:14:59] so that's about how big it will be on
[1:15:00] the on the that's like it's uh kind of
[1:15:02] like it's a ratio
[1:15:04] it's gonna be that big and guess what
[1:15:07] it's gonna cover over egypt brother
