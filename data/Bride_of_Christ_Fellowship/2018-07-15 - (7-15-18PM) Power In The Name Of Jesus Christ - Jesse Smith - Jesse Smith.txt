were standard Matthew 28:19 then we'll read acts 2:38 well there's nothing like fall more in love with Jesus is there well go to Matthew 28:19 and then we'll go to acts 2:38 so we read two scriptures tonight by the grace of the Lord like I said like last week I'll try to preach just 45 minutes the first week I preached an hour and 15 I preached 45 minutes last week I try to preach 45 tonight by God's grace so praise the Lord God is so good to us according to our schedule appreciate our visitors coming but our schedule says we're gonna preach on the power of Jesus Christ's name tonight so we're gonna preach on that but I want to ask everybody even our visitors there come a time where I'll stop the service I'll stop preaching a little bit and I'll let everybody testify of the times that you've spoken in the name of Jesus Christ and God has done something because I think that would raise all of our faith I mean we think that raise your faith I want to do that too and especially for our visitors that maybe they don't know us but if they can feel the power of our testimonies you know I thought that might be a blessing to them where you've just spoken the name of Jesus and something happened we just love the name of Jesus amen Matthew 28:19 let's read that together on three one two three go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost now let's turn to acts 2:38 know the acts 2:38 is 10 days after Matthew 28:19 and I want to just read the scripture because it's so important to understanding the power in the literal name of Jesus Christ that's you 28:19 so jesus said baptize in the name there's one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost Peter gets filled with the Holy Ghost and a few moments later he says baptize in the name of Jesus Christ so that tells us the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ how many understand that that might be new to course to our visitors or maybe new to somebody livestream they also have visitors on the livestream as well by God's grace so that's new to you that that'd be a powerful revelation in your life to know that there's one name to God and that name is Jesus Christ acts 2:38 let's read that on three one two three then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen let's bow our heads for one more word of Prayer you know in your heart just making on to God you could raise your hand or you can just talk to God in your heart Father in Heaven we love you tonight we love your name we love your glory your spirit we love your word we love everything about you Lord as we look at the power your name tonight I just pray God you'd let it be a blessing to your people here God just guide me by your spirit I'm I'm just trying to follow Lord your bloody footprints dear God I'm just trying to follow you tonight oh god I prepared notes but father just take control here tonight and that your spirit have complete preeminence bless Carol Lord bless Alice bless those livestreaming bless our regular saints that come and fellowship with us and father may your spirit direct this word to every heart for your glory in Jesus Christ's name nobody said amen god bless you zoom in and see the praise God okay so Malachi you can switch over when you're ready buddy thank you sir well you know I was uh I was at lunch there today and one of the workers came over and was having a baby shower or something like that like a birthday party and so she took me in there and there's all these people that want to know about what I believe and what I preach I got to testify the whole time and they're like do you have any cards and the last two Sundays because we've kept all these cards in my pocket today's the only day I didn't bring them but I had one card left so I said here take a picture of it so they all took a picture of it on their phone but hopefully they'll get to me but you know but God has a sense of humor I had these in my pockets last Sunday I'm like itching to pass them out today I forget to take them that's the day I need cards so God has a sense of humor that's all I can say God knows I want to pass them out desperately I got one of people to hear the word of God but I got to testify and they said it's so great to see and then the woman started testifying about all of you she said you should see this church when they come in and the children how they're so well behaved and how they talk to each other and she was just bragging on Jesus and I said well if there's any credit to our family it's nothing we did it's all Jesus you know so it was just really encouraging that had a little time to witness between service so that's why I disappeared I was making new friends as my wife said well let me set a time here so I don't wear wear you out and wear myself out here so we like to look at the scripture of this thought tonight the power in Jesus Christ's name and we sent out to thousand five hundred of these and they said usually you get one percent of people that will come to your church so that would be twenty five people will come to our church but we don't know 25 yet but we had to come so let's give our to around the flaws they've had so a very your special group your select group you know so we're just grateful that you could come and God bless you both for coming you know it's just been wonderful to have people here that perhaps are hearing it for the first time that's all we want we just want people to hear these things that are in God's Word perhaps for the first time or maybe renew them maybe they haven't heard them for a while and come to know Jesus Christ better by God's grace we just wanted to everybody how much we love the Lord Jesus Christ amen and we love his word we can't you can't love Jesus without loving his word and we love his word so let's look tonight at this little thought on the power in Jesus name so if you have a in a minute here as I get started if you have a little testimony about a time you've spoken the name of Jesus and God has it God has done something we like to hear that in just a few minutes I'll try to I said it for half an hour's that would remind me to ask everybody to share their their testimonies so welcome you're welcome to be here thank you so much for coming by the grace of God Carol did you get a chance to watch last week's perhaps on our website or anything okay so just as a if you're wondering about this picture do you know who that man is okay he lived from 1909 to 1965 his name was William Branham and he was a prophet from America and he traveled all around the world seven times and his gift was so amazing that he would go in prayer lines and he would tell people their names their addresses and people get healed and I'd met a couple I've met a couple that were actually in his prayer line and got healed and so it was a reality and it was it was God showing a sign before Jesus returns because jesus said that jesus said he was going to send another prophetic sign before the end time so he died in 1965 but his message lives on and his message was basically restoring the same truce that the Apostles taught in the Bible so it's glorious you know it is in other words the becomes a new Bible and our faith gets transformed into the original faith of the Apostolic fathers and so one example was a share last week when I went to Guyana in South America I asked a demon out of a woman and the same thing that happened to her was what the same thing that Jesus did in the Bible when he casted out demons the person screamed like they were gonna die you know they fell down like they were sleeping and then they woke up and they were fine after that and so the the message that he preached was pointing here and then when I preached this I saw the same things happen in the Bible so it's just it's vindication that this is a Bible message we're just trying to fall more in love with Jesus and his Bible so I hope that helps you just so yeah glory be to you that's all were here for that's beautiful we're just here to fall more in love with Christ and you know I was raised in a good church a good Pentecostal church but I ran from God for all those years till I was 19 I finally surrendered I started preaching when I was would have been 23 started pastoring at 25 and I've been pastoring ever since I'm 37 now so been pastoring twelve years by God's grace so we're very thankful for God's love and His mercy you know if there's anything good about us it's all Jesus so that's where that picture comes from by the way and and God took a picture that's the pillar of fire there and I that's actually a picture of the pillar of fire the the people and brother man's ministry sent that picture to an examiner of photographs and he examined - his name was George J Lacey and he sent back a certified document saying it was actually a picture of God light struck the lens and that was in 1950 yeah so God is in other words God has given him lots of indication but the main vindication is God's pure Word of God yeah so just if you're wondering what was on that postcard that was on the postcard there they got that ugly guy on the back with that with that big smile that kool-aid smile on the back so that's our topic for tonight the power in the name of Jesus Christ so we'll look at a few thoughts here on the power in the name of Jesus cry first of all Jesus Christ is the greatest name in the universe there there's no greater name in the universe than Jesus and sadly that's why people use it as a curse word because there's actually power and they're they're bringing they're trying to curse other people it's because there's power and authority in that name but they don't have the authority to curse in that in that name they shouldn't do that but the Bible says God hath given Jesus or have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth which would be of course hell right under the earth so the name of Jesus Christ is the greatest name there could ever be according to the scripture and Jesus Christ is the only name you can be saved in because the Bible says this Peter said be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified God hath raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand before you hole neither is there salvation in any other for there's none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved it is the only name that people can be saved in now people ask me all the time can Muslims be saved or Buddhists be saved the only way they can be saved is if they're kind to a Christian because jesus said in Matthew 25 he's gonna save some people and they're gonna say when did we when did we feed you Jesus when did we visit you in prison and Jesus gonna say when you did it to the least of these my brethren you've did it unto me that's the only way a Muslim or Buddhist or anyone outside of the faith that's the only way they can be saved as they're kind to a Christian but doesn't that show how merciful God is that God will save someone just for being kind to one of his brothers one of his sisters oh that's that's the grace of God amen so it's true they're only saved through Jesus Christ there's only salvation through Jesus Christ because Jesus said I am the way I am the truth of life no man comes to the Father but by me that's the only way they'll come to God is through Jesus Christ also some people might not be aware of this but the whole family in heaven and earth is named the Lord Jesus Christ that's our family name in the name of Jesus Christ the Bible says this for this cause I bow my knees under the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named amen there's no other height you know my last name is Smith but eventually I want to put away that name and in heaven I just want to be known by mrs. Jesus Christ just let me be called his part of his family amen that's all I want that's really all that matters is that we're a child of God and we course we love our natural family but that's the name we want to be a part of that's the family we want to be a part of is Jesus Christ family and the name is Jesus next then and just so you have if you have a testimony a minute I'd like you to share here I will probably too a lot sooner than I thought here the name of Jesus Christ has power over every evil every single evil you can think of because jesus said he told his disciples before he left before he went ascended to heaven he said in these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils and I've done that by God's grace I've seen that about six times six or seven times they shall speak with new tongues raise your hands anyone spoken in tongues in here before Oh wonderful wonderful numerous people praise the Lord I never have but I know a lot of people who have they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly it shall not hurt them as anyone notice anyone know anybody that's been bitten by a snake and then they spoke the name of Jesus and got healed I don't know anybody personally I've heard stories about it in missionary books that children have read about it but I've never personally met anybody and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover who's never laid their hands on the sick and they got better by God's grace than that amen praise God so that's glorious laying hands on the sick in the name of Jesus praise God so all things are overcome by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the book of Acts a demon was cast out and Paul Paul's the one who cast her out or hit the the demon out of her rather Paul was being grieved he turned and said to that spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour so this is what we want to preach on that's we want everyone to know who's listening or hear there's power in speaking the literal name of Jesus Christ there's power in that name so much so that Devils will leave if you have enough faith now of course we know there's conditions to like the person has to have sincere repent and heart if they're being possessed by demon they've got to want to be delivered right because you can't force anybody to be free they've got to want to be free so there are conditions that have to be met but if that person wants to be delivered confess their sins and they call upon the name of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ said he would deliver them amen because every every demon must bow at the name of Jesus Christ as well hallelujah now also miracles are done in the name of Jesus Christ this is an axe chapter 3 when Peter saw a crippled man and Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have I give IV in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk now Carol my brother's right there Simon you raise your hand he preached this morning he did a wonderful job this morning he preached this morning at his church there was a man who came up and I was there there's a man who came up to the the altar and he was in a cane brother Philip he's a veteran and he could even walk upstairs we prayed for him in the name of Jesus Christ the brothers prayed for him the name of Jesus Christ the next week he came back to church he didn't have a cane he was walking upstairs he was carrying couches helping people move upstairs he doesn't have a cane to this day so that's the power of our Lord Jesus Christ he hardly walk and then God takes away the cane God restores him so we know Jesus is alive and well he's the same yesterday today and forever amen that's right now before this one let's take a moment and testify here if you'd like to you don't have to I'll share a couple of ones that I've seen about the name of Jesus Christ just so scarole and you know Alice I don't know how much they you know they've experienced but one time I was praying for a woman who couldn't have children and it was three years they were praying for kids and you know she had given up and I was just out and I was just at my house away from her praying in my closet and something came over me and it was the Holy Spirit and I just was praying on my knees I started weeping and praising and I said it name of Jesus Christ this mountain is going to move and this woman's gonna have her baby I just said it in the name of Jesus Christ I was so shook up I told my wife I'd words I think I just spoke the word of the Lord but I'm not gonna go too far because I'm not real good at this you know I'm not a leper I'm not a prophet in other words and they've been trying for three years and almost given up and a few weeks later I got a text saying they're pregnant then they had a baby nine months later and they sent me a picture of little her name's little Mary Mary Ellen that's one time where they given up hope but we spoke the name of Jesus Christ God gives him a child and now they got a little baby by you know she's a little older now by God's grace but that's one time where we spoke in the name of Jesus Christ each time when we would cast out the Devils there when there's times we cast out the Devils as we pray as I would speak the name of Jesus Christ and tell the devil that the blood of Jesus Christ and the name of Jesus Christ was against the devil that's when the devils would start fighting they start you know flicking their arms and they they start foaming at the mouth but if I just when we just keep praying and just keep believing and just call on the name of Jesus eventually the demon would leave and then the people would come back to the regular senses they'd smile again they'd be happy but it was when it was and I noticed it was right when we said the literal name of Jesus Christ and come against the devil with the blood of Jesus Christ so that's a few examples of my life one time I was this is just a small example one time there's a critical spirit in a church that and after the service I later on I went and prayed right in that person's spot and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I come against this critical spear in the name of Jesus Christ and may it not come back and the next service it wasn't back but they've been there every time before but I was just one small example of any little thing if you speak it in my name and believe he'll do it and that was for God's glory because critical spirits kind of hinder the move of the Holy Spirit and so I wasn't I was we're not wrestling against flesh and blood like we're not trying to have a wrestling match and fight against people you know that don't have the right attitude but we're asking the Holy Spirit to deliver people who are enslaved by sin or take them out because we want God's love to flow through this place like a fountain we want the love of God to flow through like like a fountain overflowing where people feel the love of God their lives are changed their hearts are restored and they just fall more in love with Jesus all the time amen that's all we want now anyone like to raise your hand and let me know if you like to share a testimonial time you prayed in the name of Jesus but the Jose let you stand right there [Laughter] so this holiday Napoleon and they have it and now I would say well you can plate with that we come pick with that never a feeling you got hang up hands yes Damon amen thank you Jesus thank you Lord God that's right that's right that's a special time wasn't it I remember you said that it sounds a little nervous josé's like guaranteeing she's gonna have a baby Mike well hallelujah and then the baby was born on my birthday so God God is gracious God is merciful anyone else have a little testimony like to share about speaking the name of Jesus sister Wendy yeah going to stand up there hey man praise the Lord yeah you tell me about that yeah we've known numerous people that have had like attacks from demons while they're in bed and they get paralyzed and the only way they come out of it is call on the name of Jesus Christ and Jesus comes and delivers them by God's grace that's beautiful thank you sister Carol why'd you stand up tell us your testimony here amen amen glory praise God and they were gone and they have never returned and I have never for a man Thank You Carol thank you what a wonderful testimony anyone else hallelujah amen ease full of mercy praise the Lord thank you and what else have a little test when they'd like to share okay yeah even power and dreams in the name of Jesus absolutely yes server Hosea stand up sir amen a man David grades the Lord God is good beautiful yeah in Guyana - I we prayed for a woman who had a kidney stone and she was holding a baby and after a service she came up all excited she's like brother Jesse you know she said well after you prayed I went back to my seat and I was raising my hand you know holding my baby and I felt a hot sensation come upon that kidney stone and then it shot out through my foot she said jesus healed me of a kidney stone so that was beautiful by God's grace very thankful for that and then a sister over a sister Marie who used to come here she was experiencing bleeding and two years ago she came up to the altar and prayed and she said she felt the touch of the Holy Spirit when we prayed for in the name of Jesus Christ and the bleeding stopped so she and her husband called me the next day and told me the testimony so very thankful let's get a little round of applause for that evening so we're thankful for the name of Jesus Christ it gives us power and authority over all unclean spirits now I just put this in here just as a teaching we need faith in the name of Jesus Christ in order to see the power because the Bible said his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong so it's more than as we know it's more than just saying it we've got to have faith in it but even if even if we feel like our faith isn't where it needs to be we should say it anyway and then say Lord I believe but help my unbelief raise my faith so that when I speak it you'll answer if it's your time and season right we know everything is governed by times and seasons so it's his name through faith in his name now here's just the story remember acts 19 there's a certain vagabond of the Jews Exorcist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preached so in other words they're trying to cast out demons but they're Jews they don't believe Jesus is the Messiah but yet they're trying to use his name to cast out demons and there were seven sons of one Skiba a Jew and of the chief priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded so that's just a good scripture to keep in mind that we have to have faith in the name that we're using and how many would say Lord raise my faith tonight Oh hallelujah for the for the battles of this week the battles of next week or next year if God should tarry give us a faith increased so that we can have faith for the hour of temptation or the hour of trial we want to have real faith we want to have faced with that if a devil would talk to us they'd say I know who you are you're a child of the king amen you're a son or daughter of God Almighty that's the kind of faith we want to have by God's grace and after this was done after these people saw a demon leap on Jews who were just trying to use the name of Jesus without having faith the Bible said fear fell on them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified so when the name of Jesus has really used the right way Jesus will be magnified and he'll be respected he'll be he'll be reverenced you know he'll be honored and that's why in our church we always want to honnor the name of Jesus we don't want to tell jokes about the name of Jesus we don't want to say evil things about we just want to say all reverential holy worshipful things about our name of our Savior Jesus Christ so that's what happens the name of Jesus gets magnified when you use it with reverence and respect amen because remember Jesus said this is how we pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be your name your name has to be hallow it or sacred or set apart or something special something reverent that you treat very special Paolo would be the name of Jesus tonight amen now here's all I want to bring this thought here and this is going to be this may be new to our visitors I'm not sure but why don't more or most people see the power of Jesus Christ's name today why don't they well there's there's a couple reasons but the first reason is because the Bible says now I'm not making this up I'll show it to you the Bible says the name of Jesus Christ has been blasphemes by the Antichrist spirit that's why people don't see more of the power of God like they come to church and it's boring and God doesn't move you know one reason that that's happening is because the devil has worked in churches and he's actually blasting the name of Jesus and he's changed the name of Jesus to something else and this is scriptural I'm not making this up I'll show ray it's revelation 13:6 and he the beast this is speaking out in the Beast is the Antichrist spirit and the Beast opens his mouth and blasphemy against God and he blasphemes his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven so this has been a reality to me since I've been serving the Lord is that a lot a lot of people that go to church don't see the power of God and a lot of times it's because they don't reverence the name of Jesus they don't respect the name of Jesus and then they don't use the name of Jesus the name of Jesus should be used in doing the good works of God that's right because remember we know the Bible says God sent Jesus Christ to destroy the works of the devil amen Jesus came as a deliverer he also came as a destroyer he's going to destroy Satan's Kingdom a hallelujah even the mighty Conqueror amen hallelujah that's what the Bible literally says he came to destroy the works of saying let's read it since we got time yeah I'll pull it up here Malachi I'd leave its first John if I'm not mistaken so if you got your Bibles first John I'll have it in just a minute and so we know Jesus said yeah here's let me make it larger of course here it is yep Jesus said the works that I do will you do also either committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil so when you see when your heart goes out to people and their looks like their lives been destroyed by Satan we should pray and say God give me use them to help come in there and drive out Satan and destroy the works that he's done in their lives aren't you glad someone prayed for you so that the works of the devil would be destroyed in your life and that God could rebuild your life start afresh all over but the the clay back on the potter's wheel and start all fresh all over again amen that's why Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil and show us how to do the same thing but this is why more people are you know tired and bored with Church because most of the churches are deceived and they don't use the name of Jesus Christ because the Antichrist spirit has deceived them and they've changed the name of Jesus to something else now let's look at it now so most churches they do not use the name of Jesus at baptism instead they use father son Holy Ghost which we know Jesus said but remember we read that ten days later Peter baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and we'll look more about that in just a minute but when they when they bless marriages they don't use the name of Jesus anymore they use father son Holy Ghost have you noticed that they don't even name the name at there in a Christian Church but they never name the name of Jesus remember the whole family in heaven and earth is named the Lord Jesus Christ and they don't name his name at preaching they say may the father be with you may the son be with you may the Holy Ghost be with it but what's his name his name is Jesus Christ and then they don't use his name in prayers they use again the titles father son Holy Ghost so it's it's sad but they've rejected the all-powerful name of Jesus Christ so if without the the power of the name they just have they just have a form of religion instead of having the life and the power of Jesus Christ amen now let me show you some examples what I mean cuz I'm not trying to be critical of other churches I'm not trying to be critical of anybody but like we said we believe God has sent us a messenger to restore our faith back to the original Bible faith all right so let me show you this here I got this I want to just show it to you real quick there are five times okay so Jesus Jesus said baptized the name of Father Son Holy Ghost in Matthew 20 19 10 days later after this Peter got full the whole he goes and he said baptize in the name of Jesus Christ a few weeks or months later Philip baptized in Samaria and he baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Peter then a little while later the Bible said he baptized in the name of the Lord in 59 ad st. Paul baptized in Ephesus in the name of the Lord Jesus and then when Paul gave his testimony in acts 22:16 he told Agrippa he said then I went I was baptized in the name of the Lord so if you put all the baptisms together what name do you get when you when you put them all together you get the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so that's what we baptize when we when we bury someone in water fully immerse them there's my half hour we bury them and we say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive to give to the Holy Ghost how many raishin have you been baptized that way who's been baptized amen praise the Lord wonderful that is and that's the only true Bible baptism because no one if you read and these are all the baptism in the book of Acts no one said father son Holy Ghost and that's because Jesus was letting them know that the Father Son Holy Ghost was him he was the image of God and I'm gonna prove that to you right now hopefully with this this visual right here okay so I changed colors so how many know there's a father son Holy Ghost in the Godhead I me know that okay well we know the Bible says the son became flesh and dwelt among us right because the Bible said no it's really small but Colossians 1:19 it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness of God dwell so all of God was going to dwell in Jesus and then Colossians 2:9 said for in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily so all God's power all that God was was in Christ now watch this watch the scripture so the father was actually dwelling in Jesus how many know that John 1410 says the father that dwells in me the father that dwells in me he does the works so the father came and lived in the son there's another screen now the Holy Ghost the Bible says the Holy Ghost is it was inside Jesus in John 1:32 it said the spirit abode on him and the spirit remained on to him and then John 3:34 said God gives the spirit without measure unto Jesus and then lastly these are going real fast I don't mean it's go so fast acts 10:38 God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and with power now if you put all these scriptures together what are you gonna find out you're gonna find out that in Jesus in his body himself he was father son Holy Ghost all in one person not three people one person can everybody see that all right so the Godhead there's one name to the Godhead and that name is the Lord Jesus Christ so now you can understand why did Jesus say go baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and then the disciples use the Lord Jesus Christ why did they do that because they knew in Jesus Jesus was all of it all the Godhead was in him all that God was he poured into Christ and there's one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost and that name is the Lord Jesus Christ how many kids say amen to that amen so hope that helps does that help by God's grace amen if you just put the Scriptures together like that they'll never contradict each other they'll all point to the the same eternal truths that there's one God and his name is Jesus Christ amen all right so hope that was helpful by God's grace and I want to show let's see you I want to show that one too I guess we can show that one too so Bible support for the three main baptisms so most people baptize father son Holy Ghost but there's only one scripture for that there's no examples in the book of Acts of anyone baptizing in Father Son Holy Ghost now there's churches that are called to someoneís churches and they just use Jesus only they don't say Lord they don't say Christ well there's no scriptures that use just the name Jesus only but if you look for Lord Jesus Christ there's five scriptures that use the Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible so the Bible has all truth right and so when we look at the Bible we say well which one should we be baptized how many would say we baptized father son Holy Ghost no Jesus only I'm gonna say we should if we have the faith and apostles will baptize the name of Lord Jesus Christ somebody to say that because they they were filled with Jesus's spirit they got the Holy Ghost and ten days later they baptize in the name of Jesus Christ amen hope that's a blessing now let me show what happened here I think I'll just use this one there's a lot of words on here but let me just go slowly here's the baptism timeline from 33 ad that's when the Holy Ghost fell to 180 there's really two kinds of baptisms in the first hundred years of church history first one is the Apostolic baptism called the Lord Jesus Christ and it's the true baptism formula and that was carried out by st. Peter in acts 2:38 and that was around 33 ad now st. Paul 20 about 26 years later according to one timeline st. Paul baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus in acts 19:5 now the first history item weakened or the first historical reference we can find where anyone ever baptized him father son Holy Ghost was about 40 years after Paul around as right around 100 AD and this is called the liturgy baptism which is a false baptism formula and that's Holy Ghost okay so when Jesus first filled that with the Holy Ghost they knew the right baptism they did it right they did it right but then somehow after all this time it got lost some people started you know get deceived and they changed the name of God instead of the Lord Jesus now they're just using we what we would call titles instead of the actual name of Jesus Christ does that help by God's grace and now this is not my idea because look I got 14 historical references that all say the same thing they all say that all the early apostles and Christians only baptized using the name of Jesus Christ and then about a hundred year or about that would have been about seventy years after Jesus left people started misunderstanding baptism and they started using the titles Father Son Holy Ghost instead of understanding there's one name to the Father Son Holy Ghost that's Jesus Christ amen so if you want copies to those I can make copies of those for you house if you like copies those let me know after service I'll be happy to get you copies of those Simon Simon and I and my wife and I were digging in libraries at the University of Akron in Kent State trying to find those and make copies and so if you want copies we'll be happy to share those with you by the grace of God praise the Lord okay so I think those are the ones I want to show on that one I hope that's a blessing by the grace of the Lord let's get back to where we were so again that's why that's why people don't where's the power of Jesus how come people aren't speaking the name of Jesus it's because this the Antichrist spirit has taken the name of Jesus Christ away and given them God's titles instead of having God's name that has power in it amen because you could read the whole Bible and no one ever said I cast out this demon then the titles father son Holy Ghost you know you'll never see that every miracle that was ever done was done by speaking the name of Jesus Christ that's right amen and look what the Bible says Paul tells the calash in church whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him so whatever we do whether we go to work tomorrow whether we baptize somebody tonight you know whatever we do whether we cast out a demon or pray for a sick person whatever we do it should be done in the name of Jesus Christ and if we can't do the name of Jesus Christ we should probably shouldn't do it all right we're getting close here today and I didn't have a whole lot now the name of Jesus Christ as we said has been rejected revelation 13:8 said it but we are living in the age of the open door and this is in the Bible as well these are all great mysteries that people don't know about the Bible said that they the Beast would blast me in the name of Jesus but then Jesus was going to open the door to salvation using his name would be the way into this door of salvation and it was prophesied in the Bible so let's show you that in the scripture here okay so I believe it's Revelation chapter 3 let's go to Revelation chapter 3 here's an open door and these are the seven churches in Revelation chapters two three so let's go to Revelation chapter three you got your Bible there amen thank for the name of Jesus praise the Lord okay alright verse 7 revelation 3 7 and to the angel the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he the openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door there's the open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name these are red-letter words and jesus saying Jesus saying I'm opening the door you've kept my faith and you've not denied my name amen so let's look at this here so there's an open door according to this later seen letter there's an oh I'm sorry this Philadelphia letter rather this is the age of the Philadelphians there's an open door and it continues until the last age or the end of time until Jesus returns praise God but we know these earlier these earlier ages or generations it was actually the open door for the false vine so that this was the age actually this Pergamos age this was the age when Satan started changing that name even more so he took away the name of Jesus and instituted Father Son Holy Ghost and the people didn't know the name really until they didn't get the real revelation name until around 750 ad is when this name of Jesus moves started coming back using the literal name of Jesus so this Philadelphia church age we know began number around 1750 - and it goes till today and it's the glory that we see in Revelation 3:8 then I've set before you an open door and you've not denied my name Amen does that help by God's grace this this shows us where we are geez has opened the door and Jesus said I am the door right Jesus said I am the door to the sheepfold he's the door and here we also know that we have to go through his name in order to go through that door we have to use the name of Jesus Christ praise God so I just thought to give you a little visual there that that's the door to get into God's kingdom is through Jesus Christ the name of Jesus Christ how many walk through that door amen that's the door we want to walk through Jesus Christ now this is a quote on it just for times sake I'm not going to read all that but it's the age of the door opening and the door opening is the revelation of him and he's bringing us his strength his word the glorify his name so jesus said you have a little strength this strength comes from the revelation of the deity of Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ is God we'll have the word Jesus is the word and we've kept this we've not denied his name so we're baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we know Jesus is the door praise God amen like I said I got a lot up there I'm gonna skip past that joke so just for times sake alright now just to give you another visual this was about the time that the Trinity doctrine really took off was around 300 ad remember these were the three Church ages that had an open door I'm sorry Justin's evil works there's a lot of you know the Crusades all these things that were done that should not have been done they did it because they didn't have the power in the name of Jesus Christ but this is really when it started taking off where God was no longer no longer identified as being Jesus Christ now they cut him up into three persons which is basically a idolatry right polytheism so Jesus had to open back the door up and it's only through his name amen his name through faith in his name we walked through the door to salvation so that's a part of me that's a little history lesson there by God's grace hopefully that helps you out by the grace of God okay so let's bring this down to close I'm almost done here now I already show this video though or I'm sorry more like an animation the Father Son and Holy Ghost all appear in one body we saw that how the Father Son Holy Ghost and they're all identified in one body and that's the body of Jesus Christ all right next one Jesus Christ is the one name of God this is God's name that he wants us to know is the name of Jesus Christ because the Bible prophesized of this in zechariah 14:9 and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one Lord and his name's to be one he's gonna have one name not three not four not five he's gonna have one name and the name above all names is the Lord Jesus Christ one name above all names praise God so as we said earlier we must use the power in the name of Jesus Christ let me see what I got that is at the end there I'm thinking I'm coming down yeah I'm coming down then okay got last few scriptures all right almost done by God's grace all right so we must use the power aren't you glad to hear about the power that we've heard here this is this evening by God's grace the power in the name of Jesus now is stirred up recently because my wife's friend when we prayed for with the court situation she was testifying to my wife how she's walking around the house rebuking spirits in the house in the name of Jesus and then God not honors it and people with evil spirits don't come around anymore in other words we speak that name and when we speak that name it creates like a holy atmosphere around us and the demons do not want to come in that atmosphere so if you're having trouble at your house speak the name of Jesus Christ in your home watch it take effect watch the power of God come in your life if you're having trouble on the job you get there at a few minutes early pray in the name of Jesus you having trouble in your car or whatever you getting there and you pray in the name of Jesus Christ I come against these spirits I come against these spirits of unbelief for these spirits these depression spirits or spirits of disease anything you come against them in the name of Jesus Christ and watch God show up amen may not be immediate but give him some time to work praise God he's probably working something behind the scenes to raise your faith amen you must use that name jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works or more works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you should ask anything in my name I will do it doesn't that raise your faith oh that should raise your faith we're I'm gonna leave her tonight and I know her I got to speak the Word of God I know where I've got to call upon that beautiful name of Jesus because he said he said and if you believe you will speak that name because he said that he that believeth in me will do my works and he'll do the works in my name Oh glory thank you Jesus if you ask anything in my name I'll do it last one let's stay on our feet John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it to you Amen let's give it all around fall praise God amen all right let's let's have a timbre loss if you'll come up here by God's grace let's just bow our heads for a moment if there's any needs upon your heart this will be a time where we want to use the name of Jesus we just don't want to preach about it we want to use that name we want to put faith in that name and there's anyone that needs prayer tonight or any other concern if you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then we could rebaptised you tonight we could Reed baptize you next week or tomorrow Andry baptism is in the Bible as well if you haven't been baptized in that glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ then it's time to do that phrase God amen praise God let's just bow our heads for a moment by God's grace we play Jesus is the sweetest name I know we could play that by God's grace Heavenly Father Lord we love you tonight your God hallowed be your name Oh God or we we agree with all these scriptures or I saw almost every hand go up if it have ties in your name oh we're so thankful for that open door prophesied of it two thousand years in advance almost and said you would open the door to salvation again through the name of Jesus Christ and Lord we're living to that day in the age of the open door Thank You

I'll forever lift my eyes to Calvary to the one who died for me who is crucified for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities I'll forever lift my eyes to the old rugged cross Lord Jesus and I'll
