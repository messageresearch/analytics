========================================

[Music] the privilege and honor to be sure appreciates Lord and devil tried to take me out and been real sick for the last couple days here but feel better this morning and one thing I do love about the Ministry of the word is when you get that anointing on you you feel a lot better so we're looking forward to bringing forth this little message this morning for you it's like I said I sure love you love my brother here and the work that God is doing you know there's nothing in vain but God has predestined season and predestinated move and we ran under expectation for great things amen if we have any other expectation where we're missing the mark it must be a complete revelation that this word is going to manifest and then I trust it is amen so with that being spoke let's go ahead and open up our Bibles I'm going to bring just a little message here try to bridge a few things together second Samuel 6:1 there we go greetings from living waters Tabernacle our home church we've been watching the Lord do wonderful things a couple months ago we watched we watched the Lord heal sister Megan Nalin of stage 4 non-hodgkins lymphoma she showed it to me before she went it was on her is on her leg down here and I was about size of a softball coming off there and she went down there and to to the hospital they pretty much told her they're gonna have to cut her leg off from right here and that was something you're gonna have to do very quickly but they said first they're going to try to do some chemo on her so she did the chemo and anyway what long story short what had happened was she she went through the chemo and she said I'm done I can't do any more I'm gonna trust God so she come home and that weekend she come up she said I got to show you something she says it doesn't even hurt anymore and she showed me that spot it was completely gone so so here's the kicker about him about three weeks ago maybe even less she had passed out at home because she was dehydrated and she went to they took her to the hospital and they said they looked at her file and they said they said well sure you got we know exactly what's happened the cancer has spread to your brain now and you're not gonna make it and you're just actually looking at the signs of your neglect to go through chemo and she said well that candy said because God healed me and anyway so what happened was she are they said well they said well we're gonna do a scan on you none we're going to show you that the cancers moved throughout your body and so pretty much she said you'd go right ahead and do that and she's how she says she said I told him she said do you all find nothing so she had that threat thrown right in her face just lying lying Vanity's of the devil and sure enough they they did the scan on her and she she came back and and they were kind of down when they came back and they said well you don't have any cancer from that tonight so I it's love Lord again know the tender love of Jesus Christ but anyway just sure love Lord here second Samuel 6:1 don't mean to keep you standing I'm gonna try to bring a thought this morning I trust it will help you second Samuel 6:1 it says again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel thirty thousand and David arose and went with all the people that were with him from bale of Judah to bring up from thence the Ark of God whose name is called by the name of the Lord of Hosts that dwelleth between the cherubs and then let's go ahead bow our heads for a word of Prayer our most beloved Jesus Christ how we love you our Lord and Savior and we just appreciate Lord what your anointing in this area Oh God as far as the order you're getting this little move here Oh God crying out for you and surely Oh God it's not in vain Oh God and Lord it's going to bring forth that which it was called to do Lord and so Lord we're looking for great things we're looking for healings we're looking for revival we're looking for more of you to be made known in our myths God I'm looking for a healing right now Lord and Lord we believe oh god that surely oh gone because you're here that means that all things are possible so we're looking for that today Oh God realizing that Oh God if this service was predestinated from the foundation of the world it has a purpose and Lord we're asking that now as the sowing of the word comes forth man to accomplish the end then it was sent forward and we're just believing of God that everything that he said would be of you Lord and surely O God that you would Oh God just bring this little thought or revelation to your people that they might be able to climb higher into this thought in the name of Jesus Christ the church says together amen man you may be seated we're going to preach a thought today Minister this long time ago at home and I'm a bridge bridge over a bunch of things together here hopefully we can get this out to you but I want to work with this idea moving into a revival with the ark all right moving into a revival with the ark would just begin to go through this of course in the Old Testament God and ordained that they would build for Moses for the the temple that they would build the Ark of the Covenant and you know perhaps there is no other if I could say furniture that was designated God is supernatural furniture that God had provided with a mercy seat there was nothing as living in the Old Testament as this art was remember this Ark it was so powerful that it would want you and spread and spread the Jordan River so Joshua could walk over right and then they would go into the house of the Philistines in luck it would drop daggone right in his face a lot you see this art it was a perfect time in the Old Testament of the living word itself amen hallelujah and I want you to know that if it's tight like that in the Old Testament it's the same word in the New Testament he met all of the assault notice as long as they were following that Ark of the Covenant they were going to be all right there's nothing that could stop them there is nothing that could hurt them but they had to keep the ark before them and then now I want us to if we can must start going through this because I I want to land us in real fit today in first chronicles 13 lon so remember here that now David is taking over for Saul and Saul had the opportunity salt could have brought the ark back but remember Saul was a type of the denomination Saul didn't launch the ark all right he wasn't interested in having the ark in his nest he was okay with the art being somewhere else and but notice when it came to David David had a motive that he was trying to live out all right first chronicles 13 1 it says and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds with every leader and David said unto all the congregation of Israel if it seemed good unto you and that it be of the Lord our God let us send the brog onto our brother and everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel and with them also to the priests and Levites are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring the Ark of our God to us for we enquire not at it in the days of saw now notice that arc was to be inquired of if you needed an answer you could go to the RK men and the arc would bring forth that answer to you mayhem but notice here it says and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people how couldn't they see this and now we see the scripture letting out that all they really wanted they wanted the Living Word back in their midst they wanted a God that could lead them by the word even turn that arca come it was the word right and so a lot right we want the living mark in our midst and in so notice what happened so the fifth verse says so David gathered all Israel together from she or of Egypt even until the entry of her mouth to bring the Ark of God from George F Jairam Amen so now what they're bringing forth a revival is what they're doing you see they've had enough of an experience with the Living Word not being present and so David is now bringing the revelation well if we want the word to be alive and on this we've got to bring the word forth all right so now trying to do God a service about me as well it says now his intention was good his motive was good his objective was good and to bring a revival in the city bring the people back to God oh ha but he never consulted the way God told him to do it see so was David right in wanting the living Werner in back with him absolutely but he didn't consult God how to do it Oh hallelujah so even all the people grade in the priests that the king was right they needed the art back in the city now they needed the presence of God are you catching that if the Living Word is in our myths then the presence of the Living God is here amen that means you can believe right now whatever the need is on your heart that God will bring it to you and then you don't need just an arc of the cover to look at but we have the Word of God and then it's a vindicated message and it hasn't failed yet amen so notice they needed the presence of God I wonder if we sit in the same spot today and say I need the presence of God more in my life he said they needed a revival but God had not promised to reveal his word and it sees into the people's he never promised to reveal it to the King in the season God doesn't change a bit he didn't promise to do that no matter how sincere and what good motives and what good objectives and how people want those things and see the need of it there is a will of God to be carried out in these things that's what I want to drive down tight for I want to make this so that you have to see if the Spirit of God dwells in you mm-hmm and that's the reason I'm lingering so long hearing then so what we are looking to see whether the Spirit of God be dwelling in us because remember who's the temple of God now you are then where's the Living Word at right there right inside of you all right we're going to bridge this quick second samuel 6:1 here we're going to jump to the 3rd verse I want you to see this second samuel 6 3 it says and they set the ark of upon a new cart right and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in Gabi ax and user and Ohio the sons of abinadab drave the new cars and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at Gibeah accompanying the Ark of God in Ohio went before the ark alright so notice what they're doing they're bringing forth the word all right but notice what they're doing they set it on a new cart there's the picture there the ark sitting on this new cart and obviously we know what happens here let's look very quickly where did Israel even get this idea at the first samuel six seven says that now therefore make a new cart and take two milk i'm on which there have come no yoke and tie the kind of the car and bring their calves home from then and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which you return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side there out and send it away that it may go now in that interesting that when it came down to david bringing forth the ark of the covenant trying to get a revival back in the city he places about a new car but he was actually taking a Philistine idea remember what were the philistines remember they had Dagon or the fish later catholicism they're holding the creeds so what was this this was a creed coming forth and david and allow this creed to come forth with them so what are you saying that brother Chester if you want a revival you have to see that the word is coming forth in the right way all right notice again he says Christ is our art the word they want their denomination he cannot notice cannot be carried on the new cars of the denominations his message cannot go on the core of a new denomination when it's supposed to be born and come on the heart of a prophet it cannot he promised it it would be thus and that's the way it must be amen this word can only come forth in a living manner when it's accepted the right way it was sown through the property men many people are trying to make it say this and they can say that but it must line up 100% with the Word of God in it don't follow though message doctrine off some quote amen you have to line it up with the Lord amen and if you do then there is a revival that's knocking at the door and then so it makes you wonder when we look at basically the driest time in the history of our world in this Laodicea that we're living in right now what has actually happened there's been what people are trying to get revivals but how are they doing how they doing it are they doing it the proper way or are they doing it in a way that it actually kills the Spirit of God that they're inviting you see what I'm saying because I don't care how dry it is our God can bring rain it doesn't matter how how quiet everything feels and looks if we want God to come on the scene and we cry out to our God he says he would heal our land he would answer our prayers if we take him out of his word it will produce the right thing amen so notice what really is this this arc then it's Christ so that's why you go through the whole Testament every time you see the ark it'll tie right in with Jesus Christ Alleluia so now let's get to the breech here second Samuel 67 and the anger of the Lord was kindled against use them and God smote him there for his heir and there he died by the ark and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach upon user and he called the name of the place para Zuza to this day and David was afraid of the Lord that day and said how shall the art of the Lord come to me all he wanted was a revival that's all he wanted but he was trying to bring the revival forth with a creed in it I'm just gonna say this brother sister we're never gonna get another revival unless we are living in the pure work amen that's exactly right it's exactly right we're in transition right now you better be in it amen but notice it says so David would not remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into the City of David but David carried it aside into the house of obed-edom the guillotines event so why yes he did not continue to bring the Ark in but when user actually touch the ark and it killed him he said how am I gonna get this art to me how am I gonna get the word to me I wonder if we're looking at our lives today and we're saying how am I going to get this Living Word to me how am I going to get this living lawyer Foley expressing from my being Oh hallelujah we could go to the message and find that your prophecy he said we should never let the spirit of revival die amen we should always be hungry for revival amen hallelujah it's not a bad learning and it's not a Pentecostal word anything the word revival means that you have left a dead state and you are alive amen we don't want a dead experience we want a living experience with God that's producing the fruit that the Father desires amen amen so now second Samuel six eleven I want you to see this and the Ark of the Lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the Lord blessed obed-edom and all his household that's something just bring the ark into your house just put the word in your house and it will bless every facet of your house amen amen play the Bible in your house and then pray in your house play the message amen so in spiritual things and this art will produce blessings they men now isn't that something that God had to send it to a guitar but this get tight his house was matched but then Israel they were cursed because they were trying to bring the word forth in a way that was against the word oh we better be careful god help us so notice so David he gets a little fire up in his life I remember he just stated how can I get the art to come on to us how can this happen how are we going to do this so notice I can only imagine the blessings that come to a Benetton's house because notice the blessings were so great in the 12th verse it was told King David saying the Lord had blessed the house of obed-edom and all that pertain is unto him because of the Ark of God hallelujah his substance was gaining amen everything in his life was growing abundantly Amen oh my I wonder if we have the Living Word and on this it should produce amen so notice so David went and brought up the Ark of God from the house of obed-edom into the City of David with gladness so David said God your blessing him surely this blessing can come by our way now I want you to see this because a revelation really unfolds here okay now let's go here first chronicles 15 1 so David catches the revelation and we're not done with this I want you to we're going to we're going to take a look at this and it says and David made him houses in the City of David and prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched for it a tent then said David none ought to carry the Ark of God but the Levites for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the Ark of God and to minister unto him for ever and David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem to bring up the Ark of the Lord unto his place which he had prepared forth alright so now David saying well we can have this revival and somewhere along this thought process the Lord must have revealed it to him that wait a minute why is this thing on a cart to begin with you can't put the word on a new revelation that's unscriptural you can't put a living art in the midst of dead creed and denominational spirit we cannot pass any organizational spirit we have to be militant against organization Oh hallelujah that's the way it started that's the way it finishes in EM we must be so militant that we only prescribe the word to be carried over a Levites heart even and this word was meant to be carried over in your heart amen now notice Deuteronomy 10 8 it says at that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant the Lord to stand before the Lord to minister unto him and to bless his name unto this day now we could run this type all the way because remember the Levites are a type of the bride and who is the one who's ordained to carry the ark the Levites the only one that's really ordained to carry the Living Word is the Levites amen that's why in the scripture says that ye our God hath made new kings and priests amen hallelujah you're not just a king but you're a priest and your prophets that you're offering spiritual sacrifices under God even hallelujah that's why brother sister when you look at the Levites role it's a Levites role to worship God in them hallelujah it's a Levites jobs a lot to do the ministerial work to bring forth God in their midst amen you see how can we how do we have so many Levites but nobody wants to worship by the law they had to worship I knew you that's why I was enjoying the worship here earlier Laurie you guys having a timeout here amen but that's what you're ordained to do but notice if you're not doing it you're showing you're not only vice you don't matter what your voice sounds like it doesn't matter how much you think you can't do it or you're tired or whatever do a call to bring forth please and there are God in it amen and that's one of the main issues because the scripture says that God inhabits the praises of his people amen no praise no one haven't sent him here unless you bring your whole heart and worship amen amen I was just I was just at a place the other day and and I I was I was sitting there and their worship was going on and I was thinking to myself I said I said they can sing but he's not a worshiper an individual can sing but he's not a worshiper but then you watch if that person is not a worshiper who's leading worship he won't lead the people into worship he might make it sound nice but he won't be in the spirit of worship Kohala louia remember God's or gain way to bring forth the victory he would ordain that lot that worship would have to go forth right that's how our services are lined up you open up service and you want you begin to worship amen because why that invites God in your miss you wanna remember I bought you can ever Bible worship service amen and then watch because you've invited God though God will come down and what you live right through the word right that's what they did when they had to go around they had to go around on Jericho they had to want they had to send forth all all the music and everything going before leading the archon and that's when the walls of their life it's are tumbling down the struggles in their life how do you think that Pentecost the turn of of the 19 or the 20th century how do you think that that that God so manifested their because they worshiped they didn't have the revelation of this word but you see we don't lose worship because we have a revelation the revelation should only make it stronger I don't know why I'm going this way stop I know but I hope you get that amen because that true worship will bring forth the Holy Ghost in the power of his resurrection he then so now Dean even notices here that what he tried to bring forth this revival with a the ark on a cart and he had worship he had everything just right all the emotion of a real revival but he was off the word so you see how that works you can have the worship ride but if you don't have the word right you won't get your revival [Music] so what does he do he commands them and says let the Levites put this Ark on their shoulders so they carry this Ark I want you to see this this is very beautiful here because quite often we we look and if you look in the scripture you'll find that the picture is always a little bit more it's a little bit more deep in the thought of what it is now notice this in first chronicles 1511 it setting David called for zadok and abiathar the priest and for the Levi's for urea as ayah joel shamaya eleo in a minute ab and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brother that you may bring up the art of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it now look at this for because because he did it not at the first the Lord our God made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order if you want a revival it has to be done in a do order oh my so notice not just the new cart was an issue but there was more that was an issue and by the scripture here we see that David also commands the Levi's and he said you have to be sanctified Oh hallelujah but let me say this for any of what's gonna sanctify you more than anything else the blood of Jesus Christ amen you will never ever live a perfect walk in this flesh you're promising many times a day your backside amen but the blood of Jesus Christ amen oh think about a brother sister that the blood of bulls and goats was so strong that you could what it could call the plagues down on Egypt your prophet said he said he said that God brought the thought to Moses his mind it was the literal thought of God that rolled into Moses mind and he said let there be flies and your father said he said that was under the blood of bulls and goats he was sanctified enough through the blood of bulls and goats that he could speak for water and frogs and everything else would come now oh it's a revelation of the blood of Jesus Christ in our lives amen I was just telling the church the other day you think about it under the blood of bulls and goats you realize that God could bring a rapture to Enoch oh wow we should raise our confidence up to realize that the blood of Jesus Christ is so much stronger so much greater there's not a sin cannot dispel mmm but when the word said that as the East is from the West so tell your sins be hallelujah God cannot even find them Oh blessed is the man whom God will not impute iniquity a born amen don't you see that if the blood is this strong that he can watch get a revival in your myths that blood paid for your revival that blood pay for that spirit of revival to never be able to leave in your life right think about the third seal because that's what remember it was the statement of Jesus Christ that said what a Satan you cannot hurt the oil on the wine you can't touch it you can't touch you can't hold it there's no reason that you should feel like you have a hurt experience there's no reason why you should feel that you don't have the stimulation of Revelation you make God preaching then you bring the Holy Ghost ileena he loves you so much that he died for you so that he could answer your every cry of your heart whoo so look at the issue as it comes forth not just was it wrongly placed on a new card but the Levites were no longer sanctified you see you can't even have the Levites carry the the ark unless their sanctify you say so what do you think God's trying to do he's trying to bring his church into a humble laughs for him so that what they'll say there everything else is I and they'll say god I let my life go this is all about you it's that simple but you see what it is so now it's not just that it has to be paired on the the the shoulders of the Levite but they have to be clean they then the due order said you should have done it the first time so notice says now notice in this now David thought he had everything in order and he was inspired see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside spirit can be anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul as dark as pitch the cocklebur rolls on the same water that bill puts life into the wheat puts life into the cocklebur but at the bottom of the cocklebur it's a cocklebur life it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of it is a cocklebur see false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as a true gospel can but by the word here that's what does it see what I mean oh my hallelujah you have to see are you inspired looking for a revival right now hey man why why would it be wrong not one revival or I would be wrong - one revival it camping because remember if this spirit that was in Christ being you it shall also quicken your mortal body it's a quickening spirit did you know that the word quickened and revived means the same thing if that's saying spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you dwelling you it shall also quicken your mortal mind it's gonna quicken you oh my hallelujah it's gonna bring life inside of you amen hallelujah it doesn't matter if it felt like you left it long ago today is your day for revival amen hallelujah Oh hallelujah crowds they got let a good greater every meeting every service let the power of God come amen hallelujah that's what he's really wanting to do he's wanting to turn every assembly that will get assigned to him into a living moving organism of Jesus Christ with power power amen amen but notice so the order has to be right if it's a cocklebur order and ain't gonna work right they can be anointed but it's always going to bring forth the wrong thing but the revelation should be telling you ain't no cocklebur here right your prophet said if there's one you be that one hallelujah so now they've been commanded to do this and look at what happens here in 1st chronicles 15 14 so the priest and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the Ark of the Lord God of Israel oh my so they did it well I wonder if it's going to work this time I wonder if the revival is going to work now that it's done in the right order many revivals have fallen flat because they have the wrong motives the wrong objectives but where the heart is looking for the right thing it'll come just as certain as we're standing here and the children of the Levites bear the Ark of God upon their shoulders with the stage there are as Moses commanded according to the word of the Lord in them so they had the anointed word the anointed commandment and what they followed that commandment oh my I wonder what happens now look at this numbers eight five we'll come back down to the purification here and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them and thus shall pout do unto them to cleanse and sprinkle water of purifying upon them let them shave all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean then let them take a young boy and his meat offering even fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullet shalt thou take for a sin offering so this the the offering had to be wot this was a real deal they had to put some effort forth it wasn't just oh well I'll just try it and try a little bit here but no it was a set order to get them sanctified before God sometimes you got to sit there and look at those habits of those things that bind you down and you got to sit there and say God I need to be purified of this don't just go to say Oh God purify me and then stop give God a minute right but we need to put an effort forth to see if we're earnestly contending for this faith amen so now look second Samuel six thirteen so now they're bringing the ark for but look at now David is putting something else in here and it was so that when they bear the Ark of the Lord had gone six paces paces he sacrificed oxen and fat legs so notice they go six steps and then what then they bring out the sacrifice right before them so they had six steps and then the seventh step was blood hallelujah alright now I wonder if they're having a real revival this seven Church age is all about blood it's all about blood that's where everyone's missing it we can't miss it because it's all about remember your prophet said what'd he say he said that the foolish virgins missed the rapture because they didn't have the fullness of the atonement they didn't have a revelation of the blood they were virgins but what they didn't trust the blood that's really what it is because if you trust anything outside of blood you are going to be lost the blood holds your rapture the blood holds your peace it holds your healing today it holds what your strength and your power the breath gave you all of it oh I can only imagine what's going on here they sacrifice now the option and fatlings and the 14th scripture says in David danced before the Lord with a quarter of his mind just a little bit no the Bible doesn't lie the Bible stated that David danced with all of his mind and David was girded with a linen ephod so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord was shouting and with the sound of the trumpet hold on don't you see that this is all coming down to the sounding of this last trumpet don't you think when the ark that living word don't worry there's fine identifications of that firm pole that's getting ready to live out on you there's an anointing a former ladder rain pouring up don't worry it's coming but what is it do we think that we're gonna undo everything and live it in any other order David he danced with all his might we could go whole sermon on this alright remember brother branham's he used to say he's the thing that dancing was wrong he said one one one day that woman was out dancing dancing in the aisle there if he was our New Year's Eve night or something and brother branham was out there and he said he said he looked over and he and he said why is she doing there and then the Holy Ghost spoke to him and said if you had victory like she had you would be out there this is my favorite part because I'm the Prophet said he said then I looked down and my methodist foot got this happen then he said before he do it he was out in the aisle dancing with that woman but don't you see it dancing is not it's not it's not defeat dancing shows you pepper victory Amen hallelujah don't you see that's what David had here he had the victory the ark had come forth now and it had been accepted right see if you want a revival you got to want everything that goes with it you got to be willing say God because here's the thing you don't control yourself anyway well you're not supposed to who controls you God does and if God controlled you what's he gonna have you doing he'll have you do the things that you don't normally do that's what he does so notice they brought the ark up with shouting and the sound of a trumpet all that excitement bringing the Living Word forth got there there's David doing this jig I like that I had to put that in there all's might oh yeah oh yeah but he had victory possessing all things - you've seen one time I used to think about dancing in the spirit see somebody stand and dance in the spirit now I've seen the mockery put on put on of it but I've seen the real thing - so I come to find why why could people dance in the spirit well I never seen one yet get out of the way I've never seen one yet act immorally I always see it just as DS Lee and an order and sweetness and even sinners run to the altar and get saved when it's going on you have sinners to give their lives to Christ you'd have to be willing to get you lost in the spirit dancing obviously it's not the only way but your prophet said he's seen it somebody get caught up in the spirit and dancing of the Spirit of God and a sinner's heart get convicted he says I gotta go I got to go up to the altar give my life to Christ oh my god works in a way that's contrary to the way we think you want God to be free to save souls let him be free in you and then then he says well I wondered why it was and I come to find out it's victory [Music] David danced before the Lord when the ark was brought back to its resting place amen when David saw the word as it was then with the tables of stone brought back to his right place David rejoiced and danced in the spirit around and around in a row why he saw the word back in its place why was David really having such a victory because he seen that the word was where it was supposed to be Oh hallelujah hey men see where's the revival going to be when the word gets in this right place and the word is in you amen what the word needs is not out of some seminary some theological mix-up but an old fashioned God sent preacher behind the pulpit with the word seeing God vindicated oh god help us almost done first chronicles 15 16 and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brother to be the singers with instruments of music psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy just lift up your voice with joy now I want you to see this because you realize David ordained this when the art came back that there would always be worship my my my moving down he says so David and the elders of Israel the captains over thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord I was a house of event of the joy and it came to pass when God helped the Levites that bear the Ark of the Covenant allure that they offered seven bullocks and seven Rams there's your sevens and David was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the Levites that that bear the ark and the singers in China cha-cha Nanaia the master of the song with the singers David also had upon him and Ethan of linen thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouting with sound of cornet with the trumpets with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harsh harps and that's something how's this church going to be how's this Church gonna really bring forth the Spirit of Christ it's this ties perfectly in with x2 you have to be in one place in one Accord you have to have the same motives the same objectives you have to realize that you hold a part in this and this worship here it doesn't work without you hallelujah the word doesn't come forth without you amen oh holiday we got we got to fell out Holmen he hasn't caught the full revelation yet but he loves God and he works a lot of seven-day weeks but he's one of the only people I've ever noticed that when he's in service the atmosphere is completely different now I thought I said Lord this guy could catch a fire and be there every time and be be hungry just just being there cuz that's the way everyone should be right they shouldn't just be one guy I'm looking at and say hey yep yep when they're here that makes a big difference but that's you and you knew [Laughter] what else can live that fart out in the bride that you can and you have the revelation you know what this is you know how to have a victorious church service you know how to have healing in the service if the revivals not coming in charge like it's supposed to go back here are you in due order or if you let the cares of this life filter it's got to be the same and it came to pass as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came to the City of David that Michael the daughter of Saul looking out the window saw King David dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart oh my don't worry there's always gonna be somebody that's not gonna like the way you worship I like this my body hurts not your goodness hallelujah possessing all things again then David said glory to God this is it and around and around and around and around his little stuck-up wife set up there being the king's daughter said why he embarrasses me and David said you don't like that watch this and around and around he went again yes oh my what a time he had even you know God look down out of heaven said David you're a man after my heart see why he had done lost all pride why wouldn't we worship the way God wants us to worship she got pride remember your prophet told the story about he said we should be in a place he said he said the Lord will try to humiliate you he'll get you in front of a bunch of co-workers and get you to speak in tongues and from them just to see if you'll do it well you might want to get warmed up here and worry about the rest later so what it says you know god looked down out of heaven and said David your man he lost all his pride he had done lost all of his yet he was married to a king's daughter but that wasn't even considered then he know that he was acquainted with the possessor of heavens and earth and here was the Word of God coming right back among them again and David was so happy he didn't he just danced as hard as he could Miriam she grabbed the tambourine and went down to the bank dancing on the other side after she had come through the Red Sea and seen her enemies drowned then she could dance in the spirit which he seen the enemies that had tormented her dead then she danced in the spirit that's right after the battles worn when the glory of God comes down know I'd begin to touch to that day remember whether you see it or not the victory is already won amen hallelujah he led captivity captive a man indeed gets the men hallelujah let's tan says here closing he says it was at then when that man died that David with the anointing saw what he had done wrong Oh David you passed her can't you see you're dead Creed's and denominations you're holding onto can't you see what it's doing it's killing a Uzziah spiritually dead what was his ayah that was a person in David's church pastors killing people spiritually on the church spiritually dead and you wonder why there ain't no revival letting her women cut their hair paint their face wear shorts send your boys away to Rickey schools and so forth like that where half of them comes home homosexuals and everything sanctification gone we're done I trust that was a blessing to you how are we going to get revival how are we going to get it back in the due order but I know this if you want God hear your worship like you want him here because he likes that with all our hearts with all our praise we get it too so with that being spoke and looking at your your life today where are you at you need a revival maybe you need a touch of the Lord God is more than able to bring it to you but will you accept for the Living Word is here he's here he's absolutely here God has always been so gracious I just preached a funeral last Tuesday I preached one yesterday and I preached one last Tuesday before and the lower just really anointed it was great I had this lady actually numerous people come up and say boy it's really good cruciate that and sure tore him up with acts 2:38 but they still heard it and one lady came up to me she said just a worldly a girl and she said I don't know what it was she said but while you were preaching I felt this presence come down in the midst of this place and she's like do you think that was God I said absolutely I said it and what was the message he brought you to be baptized to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and that life that you felt now he would come we're living in a season brother/sister where this is not popular but God is doing everything he can to reveal that presence to people but we have to believe that he's with us you have to believe that you have to believe that he wants to answer your plan maybe you got something on your heart today we'll go before the Lord now say God maybe saying god I don't want to
