[35:26] it's good to see that they what it was
[35:28] able to press out again this evening or
[35:29] bless you richly for your sacrifices
[35:32] game time the suitor here which way to
[35:34] go speak to us and be gracious unto us
[35:48] but yet so once again to privilege and
[35:50] honor the Saints you know what God's
[35:53] doing and take what for the sisters at
[35:55] work
[35:57] there's many souls of saving we trust
[36:00] the Lord continue and his movement every
[36:02] life direction that Mexican restaurant
[36:13] really kind of a good star your once
[36:17] again the most important eating that we
[36:20] do so if we have your Bibles like stand
[36:26] for the reading of the word God's grace
[36:32] I think I'm gonna work I'm gonna work
[36:37] with our lives again this evening I
[36:39] think that be be favorable I got a lot
[36:45] of things Lord just seems a reveal but I
[36:47] appreciate them for that but I might be
[36:50] trying to squeeze a little bit much into
[36:51] tonight's sermon we don't want to be
[36:53] tremendously long but we do want to just
[36:57] bring your mind to a little bit of
[37:00] settlement who you are in Christ this
[37:02] evening
[37:03] we can and we'll see what the Lord would
[37:05] do with this if we go this direction
[37:07] here not perhaps wanting to bring
[37:11] anything but yeah just wanting to allow
[37:14] the Lord to have his way with us and
[37:15] perhaps he'll he'll continue with that
[37:19] little corn and oil and wine smile from
[37:21] this morning amen so I hope you got a
[37:23] little bit about oil and wine this
[37:24] evening and tonight we want to preach
[37:27] some messages as a I preached this at
[37:28] home just recently and it was it was it
[37:32] was such a blessing to them that they
[37:33] kind of pushed me to keep on preaching
[37:35] on preached several sermons on it here
[37:38] but yet one about Hebrews 10 verse 9
[37:41] will work with a little title tonight
[37:43] what sin if we can and will try to
[37:47] bridge these things for you here the
[37:49] night and verse he says that says then
[37:51] said he lo I come to do thy will o God
[37:54] he taketh away the first that he may
[37:57] establish the second by the which will
[38:01] we are sanctified through the offering
[38:03] of the body of Jesus Christ once and for
[38:09] all amen so how many offerings did it
[38:12] take to set you free
[38:13] just once once today and then keep going
[38:18] there we've got to keep doing this he
[38:20] says once for all amen
[38:22] we'll get to this by the grace of God 11
[38:25] verse it says in every priest and if
[38:26] daily ministering and offering
[38:29] oftentimes the same sacrifices which can
[38:32] never take away sins alright
[38:36] but this man after he had offered one
[38:39] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[38:43] the right hand of God from henceforth
[38:46] expecting till his enemies be made his
[38:49] footstool for by one offering he hath
[38:54] perfected forever them that are
[38:58] sanctified hallelujah so what'd he say
[39:01] by just one offering he hath perfected
[39:05] forever them that are sanctified nah I
[39:10] don't know how free do you feeling Lord
[39:13] a lot of feel pretty clean like like a
[39:16] clean little lily amen so tonight we're
[39:18] gonna bow our heads for word of Prayer
[39:20] work with this little idea our most
[39:23] precious beloved or Jesus Christ is in
[39:25] order certainly just a little bit of an
[39:28] idea here tonight and we just pray oh
[39:30] god you'd add your inspiration anointing
[39:32] to this sermon once again Lord and order
[39:35] the Saints here have in need of you Lord
[39:37] they fell in love with you they want to
[39:40] serve you Lord they believe o God that
[39:42] they're the called and chosen of this
[39:44] generation or those who are called not
[39:47] just righteous
[39:48] Oh God but they're called holy Lord in
[39:50] order it was you that did all the work
[39:53] so God that it took to get us there we
[39:55] trust tonight Oh God that you just speak
[39:57] to us Oh God
[39:58] just a little simple message but Lord we
[40:00] just pray add your blessing to it Lord
[40:02] and order you help bring some some more
[40:06] victory to our lives Oh God as we look
[40:09] Oh God that are many challenges that we
[40:10] face Oh God so many times Oh God we're
[40:13] just right there with the Prophet he
[40:14] said he said we backslide many times in
[40:17] a day but yet Lord even though there be
[40:20] backslidings we understand Lord that
[40:22] there's a god who's greater than all
[40:24] those things nor we're just asking
[40:26] tonight that you just encourage us and
[40:28] cheer us up O God raised us higher in
[40:30] your word O God that we might be able to
[40:32] be more effective for you in all the
[40:33] places that you send us we just love you
[40:35] and ask you to have your way now named
[40:37] Lord Jesus Christ Church says together a
[40:39] man you may be seated
[40:42] so tonight we're gonna work with this
[40:44] title if we can what sin and I want to
[40:50] start by reading just a little quotation
[40:51] for you and some of it be familiar for
[40:54] you in question and answers here we want
[40:57] to jump down here and question answer is
[40:59] fifty nine and just this will give us a
[41:01] nice little burst a little start here
[41:03] and I asked my church when I was
[41:05] preaching this I said okay how much of
[41:08] you how many of you sin and I had
[41:11] several hands went up and and by the
[41:13] grace of God I said let's read this
[41:15] quotation here so the question is this
[41:19] and I'm so glad that somebody asked this
[41:23] it's the only time I see it brought
[41:25] forth in the message in question answers
[41:27] and so
[41:27] for the very beautiful statement but do
[41:30] Christians sin all right so what does
[41:35] your prophet say absolutely No so how
[41:42] many here are Christians and I let's get
[41:45] to this he says he cannot sin I know
[41:48] there's a resentment to that that's what
[41:51] that's what we do and I know this will
[41:54] sit in a church service and and it'll
[41:56] get some of those things I said you you
[41:57] sinned and when you get the answer
[42:00] absolutely not
[42:02] does something raise up a little bit in
[42:05] you a little resentment maybe little
[42:09] your prophet said he said well we'll
[42:11] just go to first John three and see what
[42:13] the scripture says a Christian does not
[42:15] sin did you ever see a black white bird
[42:18] or a white black bird did you ever see a
[42:21] drunk sober man no you never did see a
[42:25] sinner st. either there's no such a
[42:27] thing brother say sir right now in this
[42:30] room there's no such thing as a sinner
[42:33] Saint here you're either a sinner or a
[42:37] saint
[42:39] since now if this gets a little touchy
[42:42] you just put a lot of balm in you know
[42:45] and it will cure up just in a little bit
[42:48] now and that's the direction we're
[42:50] aiming to go tonight we just want to
[42:51] allow the Word of God and the message to
[42:53] bring a little statement to try to raise
[42:56] us up brother sister we can have
[42:58] confidence in who we are amen I ran into
[43:01] a quote I won't have it tonight but your
[43:03] prophet said I believe in 57 Hebrew sir
[43:05] he said God can only work through that
[43:08] which is perfect if God's going to
[43:12] answer your prayer it's going to be have
[43:14] to be because you're perfect but if you
[43:19] don't believe you're perfect then how is
[43:22] God going to answer your prayer
[43:25] alright now what is it about you that
[43:27] makes you perfect it's the way you dress
[43:29] the way you think all these other things
[43:31] know there's only one thing that will
[43:34] make you perfect and that is the perfect
[43:38] sacrifice
[43:42] remember as we read that scripture he
[43:45] died once and for all the blood of Jesus
[43:51] Christ was so powerful it only took him
[43:53] going on the cross a long time and when
[43:57] he went on that cross and he died for
[44:00] man since in the blood struck the mercy
[44:04] seat and brother/sister the Church of
[44:06] the Living God has been a free entity
[44:09] ever since amen
[44:11] now notice of course this is where we
[44:14] begin to move with this in first John
[44:16] 3:8 it says he that committeth sin is of
[44:20] the devil all right so when we look say
[44:23] oh I'm such a worthless sinner I'm such
[44:25] a miserable sinner well he that
[44:28] committeth sin is of the devil so notice
[44:31] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[44:35] now I like this for this purpose the Son
[44:39] of God was manifested so because Satan
[44:46] was the one who brought forth and a sin
[44:50] and for what that was that was the whole
[44:52] purpose God allowed him to come forth so
[44:56] on so the purpose the Son of God was
[44:58] manifested that he might destroy the
[45:02] works of the devil
[45:05] so God let all this sin come in the
[45:08] world he let all those rotten days that
[45:11] you serve the devil come in so that one
[45:15] day you could find Jesus Christ and
[45:21] lives the purpose of you finding him was
[45:25] so that he could one destroy the works
[45:28] of the devil in your life hallelujah he
[45:32] led captivity captive and not he gave
[45:36] gifts unto man it was God's desire that
[45:40] what he would destroy captivity to his
[45:44] children and we get a little bit farther
[45:48] and he says whosoever is born of God
[45:52] I commit sin so this is why the devil
[45:58] fights your holy ghost experience so
[46:00] hard this is why he'll sit there and and
[46:04] continually tell you things you're not
[46:08] hallelujah and what I'll tell you what
[46:10] brother sister if we ain't got the Holy
[46:11] Ghost let's get busy hallelujah
[46:14] let's let's labor to enter into his
[46:16] resting in and we see that what if you
[46:19] are born of God you cannot commit sin
[46:22] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[46:26] cannot sin because he is born of God now
[46:31] we're going to take this in a direction
[46:32] tonight because I want you to see how
[46:35] much power this sacrifice of Jesus
[46:38] Christ has made in your life and once
[46:40] again I would like to bring it back in
[46:42] the Old Testament start showing you a
[46:43] few things here but notice so much if
[46:46] you are born of the Spirit of God how
[46:49] many say oh I've got the Holy Ghost
[46:50] there's at some point in time brother
[46:52] sister you have to recognize what you
[46:55] have I mean it ain't a guessing game to
[46:58] get in this rapture you have to what you
[47:00] have to look at what Christ has done see
[47:03] the change in your life thank God for
[47:05] that woman who said he said I'm not what
[47:07] I want to be I'm not what I ought to be
[47:12] but praise God I'm not what I used to be
[47:15] amen because look at the changer life by
[47:21] the blood of Jesus Christ he meant to
[47:24] begin to transform lives you know
[47:26] brother sister most of us in the message
[47:28] we don't even struggle with a lot of
[47:30] those deeper darker sins but what we're
[47:32] finding these little foxes that spoil
[47:36] the vine but you know what I love about
[47:39] God God never allows sin to be anything
[47:43] less than what sin is
[47:46] most of us won't will this be will be in
[47:49] these touchy little things and what
[47:51] you'll actually find that in your
[47:52] experience it condemns you the same way
[47:55] that did well that's beautiful because
[48:00] God made it so you would never have an
[48:02] opportunity outside of
[48:04] fact to hold on to his blood hallelujah
[48:10] now notice this we see in first
[48:13] Corinthians 12:12 it says for as the
[48:15] body is one and hath many members and
[48:18] all the members of that one body being
[48:20] many are one body so also is Christ for
[48:23] by one spirit are we all baptized into
[48:26] one body all right
[48:29] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[48:32] we be bond or free and have been all
[48:34] made to drink into that one spirit for
[48:37] the body is not one member but many amen
[48:40] now let me ask you whose body is that
[48:44] it's the body mythical body of Jesus
[48:48] Christ so let me ask you is the body of
[48:54] Jesus Christ a sinful body it cannot be
[48:58] a sinful body now hold on now let's look
[49:01] so we see in question answers again he
[49:03] says no more sin the sin question
[49:06] settled that's the reason sin looks so
[49:09] dirty to a Christian notice the nature
[49:13] change that comes on you right you'll
[49:15] start looking at sin and it seems so
[49:18] dirty all the time right he said that's
[49:20] why women out here wear these shorts on
[49:22] looks so dirty to a Christian that's why
[49:27] vulgarity there's a lot of dirty things
[49:29] that's why smoking drinking gambling all
[49:31] this on uncensored programs on
[49:33] television all that stuff seems filth
[49:36] wha you of a different Kingdom
[49:41] hallelujah what's got you here on a
[49:43] Sunday night amen because what you're
[49:45] not desiring filth or any of those
[49:48] things you want to hear the word of God
[49:50] amen we start identifying ourselves and
[49:54] say yes there is an mercy seat right
[49:57] here that the Lord's took precedence on
[49:59] amen
[49:59] now notice here he says you're born into
[50:02] the kingdom of God and sealed by the
[50:04] Holy Ghost until the day of your
[50:07] Redemption Amen Satan cannot take you up
[50:14] it's impossible
[50:18] he that's born of God commits no sin for
[50:21] he can't sin the seed of God is in him
[50:25] and he can't sin he cannot sin as long
[50:27] as that Holy Ghost is in there
[50:29] he takes every desire of sin away from
[50:32] you amen
[50:33] you can't sin there's no more desire now
[50:37] this is where the devil begins to fight
[50:39] you because so many times we find
[50:41] ourselves getting into these little
[50:42] things we're where we find ourselves
[50:45] sitting in certain ways right
[50:46] just little habits or other things like
[50:48] that and brother/sister when you see
[50:50] that and then we try to exclude
[50:53] ourselves from this provision we look
[50:56] and say well I'm not perfect I guess I'm
[50:58] not a I guess I'm not I don't have the
[51:00] Holy Ghost well whoever said that the
[51:02] legalism was the Holy Ghost notice he
[51:06] says the desire to sin he doesn't say
[51:10] that you're perfect in your flesh all
[51:13] right we're gonna get some of these
[51:14] things let's continue with this idea in
[51:16] Romans 4:4 says now to him that worketh
[51:19] is the reward not reckoned of grace but
[51:22] of debt all right so if we're trying to
[51:25] do it legally with legalistic manners
[51:28] what the reward is not grace buts debt
[51:31] but to him that worketh not but
[51:34] believeth on him that justifieth the
[51:36] ungodly his faith is counted for
[51:39] righteousness even as david also
[51:42] described the blessedness of the man
[51:44] unto whom god imputeth righteousness
[51:47] without works a true child of God will
[51:53] have righteousness imputed on him
[51:55] without works saying blessed are they
[52:01] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[52:05] sins are covered omok now look at the
[52:11] severity of iniquity iniquity is when
[52:14] you know something's wrong and you do it
[52:16] anyway you know it's wrong and you did
[52:20] it and God's blood is so strong when you
[52:27] desire to do it
[52:28] and you
[52:29] even earlier today even yesterday even
[52:35] the day before that there was a blood
[52:38] brother sister have you been born body
[52:41] that will hold you because the seed
[52:45] remaineth in you hallelujah brother
[52:50] sister when you look at this this is why
[52:53] we were so down so many times it's a
[52:55] constant battle of trying to make this
[52:58] thing serve God hallelujah you don't
[53:01] want to it all want you to praise God
[53:04] you don't want you to say the name of
[53:06] Jesus Christ but the name of Jesus
[53:09] Christ is let's save you to begin with
[53:11] amen
[53:12] no I'm going to take a little turn here
[53:15] because I want this to change your mind
[53:16] completely when you see what the Prophet
[53:18] said and then we're going to jump into
[53:20] some things okay now so notice this
[53:22] there are people I pray that we should
[53:26] be in this room right now and the next
[53:30] time that we do something wicked and we
[53:33] say Oh God I knew I shouldn't have done
[53:35] that but I did it and we could say go
[53:39] God forgive me for and just like that
[53:41] it's in the sea of forgetfulness that's
[53:45] what he died for
[53:46] it's already covered it's gone he never
[53:49] seen anyway but what right now we're
[53:51] supposed to be having dominion over this
[53:53] this this serpent right here you know
[53:55] that God gave you this serpent so you
[53:57] can have Dominion every now and then
[54:00] it's an everyday fight I know there's
[54:02] some times we don't do so well but
[54:04] brother sister we're doing everything in
[54:06] our potential and who we've been called
[54:10] to be to destroy the works of the devil
[54:11] on this thing you know what amen
[54:15] you know what he gives us a headache
[54:16] half the time we ought to be giving him
[54:18] some headache too right so notice
[54:20] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[54:22] not impute sin cometh this blessedness
[54:27] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[54:30] the uncircumcision also for we say that
[54:32] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[54:34] righteousness it's your faith that will
[54:37] put you in that place hallelujah when
[54:40] you fall brother sister you
[54:42] have an advocate in the father now look
[54:46] at this so he continues here and we're
[54:49] going to jump in F right after this it
[54:51] says once again our last quotation from
[54:53] here I believe it says for by one spirit
[54:54] we are all baptized into one body and
[54:57] are free from sin and we cannot sin
[55:00] there is an atonement waiting for us and
[55:03] if there still a desire in your hearts
[55:05] our sin you have never been baptized
[55:07] into that body because you are dead and
[55:09] your life is hidden Christ or God and
[55:11] sealed by the Holy Ghost Christians
[55:14] don't sin notice they make mistakes
[55:24] hallelujah there's where we come in
[55:26] alright so that changes everything
[55:29] where our idea mentally is I must be
[55:32] perfect in every single little thing I
[55:34] do we have the Prophet even coming
[55:38] forward and saying that Christians will
[55:40] make mistakes I look it up he's still
[55:42] saying that in 65 God forgive me I made
[55:46] some mistakes hallelujah but notice they
[55:51] they make mistakes but they don't sin
[55:55] amen that's the reason they don't for he
[55:58] cannot sin if the Holy Ghost is in you
[56:03] he's looking at the sacrifice he's
[56:07] looking at the Tok in the past when I
[56:10] see the Blood I will pass over you now
[56:14] let's get this somewhere real quick he
[56:16] says how can I if I go down through the
[56:19] city here and the mayor of the city says
[56:21] mr. Branum I know that you've made sick
[56:24] calls there's speed limits the highest
[56:29] speed limit in the city is about 30
[56:32] miles an hour but I'm giving you
[56:35] permission to run 90 if you want to
[56:41] because
[56:42] I have faith in you that you wouldn't do
[56:44] it unless you had an emergency call or
[56:46] somebody dying yonder in Iraq and I'll
[56:49] give you permission as the mayor of this
[56:51] city that you can run any red light do
[56:54] whatever you want to just go right off
[56:56] how could a little two-bit officer ever
[56:59] arrest me out here making 40 mi of 40
[57:03] miles an hour in a 30 mile zone he can't
[57:05] I cannot break any speed laws in this
[57:09] city because why I'm above the speed
[57:13] laws amen I hope you see it now this
[57:19] ain't talking about when you drive home
[57:21] tonight brothers sisters but catch the
[57:24] idea of what is stated here if the mayor
[57:29] of the city said that you because of
[57:32] your position because of what he gave
[57:38] you authority to do he said you can go
[57:42] ahead and break all those laws because I
[57:44] know that you don't desire to do it and
[57:49] you wouldn't do it just to do it
[57:52] anybody's sin because it's fun I know it
[57:56] shows that something has taken place in
[57:59] your life brother sister no longer are
[58:02] the filth of the flesh your pleasures
[58:04] but you find that what your pleasure is
[58:07] to do the will of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:10] hallelujah so notice the idea is that
[58:16] you're above the law of the land cuz why
[58:21] you're under the law of the word so
[58:29] think about that and the next time you
[58:30] drive a little fast oh god help me right
[58:38] look at that
[58:39] you can't even break any speed limits
[58:41] anyway but this is the thing we don't do
[58:45] it because it's willfully fun something
[58:47] we love to do we want to be like the
[58:50] book of Romans and obey the laws of the
[58:52] lane only we want to do our best amen
[58:56] but those every little falters that say
[58:58] you're done you're going to help in us
[59:05] now I want to take this with a little
[59:07] bit direction with you because I want
[59:09] you to see the the unlimited potential
[59:11] that you have as a sinless being of God
[59:16] you got the Holy Ghost or maybe coconuts
[59:18] amen
[59:19] notice you I want you to see this and
[59:21] Hebrews 9:11 he said but Christ because
[59:24] being a come a high priest of good
[59:26] things to come by a greater and more
[59:28] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[59:30] that is a say not of this building
[59:32] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[59:35] but by his own blood he entered in once
[59:39] into the holy place having obtained
[59:41] eternal redemption for us he only did it
[59:45] how many times or God over notice for if
[59:51] the blood of bulls and of goats and the
[59:56] ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean
[59:59] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[1:00:02] flesh how much more shall the blood of
[1:00:07] Christ who through the Eternal Spirit
[1:00:09] offered himself without spot to God
[1:00:11] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:00:15] serve the Living God so notice the
[1:00:20] purpose I have an underline there that
[1:00:22] Lodge the blood of bulls and goats it
[1:00:27] was so powerful remember the life was in
[1:00:30] the blood now it ain't like you're God's
[1:00:34] blood as we see down here but look at
[1:00:37] this he could sanctify to the purifying
[1:00:41] of the flesh think about that
[1:00:45] once a year coming up on the day of
[1:00:48] atonement sacrificing those goats and
[1:00:53] what just by following that law that God
[1:00:56] gave them they went out free but look at
[1:01:00] this blood of Jesus Christ cuz how much
[1:01:03] more the blood of Jesus Christ could
[1:01:06] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:01:08] serve the Living God
[1:01:10] the purpose of the blood of Christ was
[1:01:12] what not that he would just take away
[1:01:14] your flat out your sins but what that it
[1:01:16] would actually do a makeover on your
[1:01:19] conscience were you no longer desire to
[1:01:23] do dead words but while you're home move
[1:01:26] us to do God himself
[1:01:29] alright now notice this we're going to
[1:01:31] get to this year it Redeemer Redemption
[1:01:33] 55 it says there he died and you feel
[1:01:36] the pains of Calvary what he did he says
[1:01:38] brother the reason that man went out
[1:01:41] with the same thought he had coming in
[1:01:43] the same desire to sin here's why it was
[1:01:47] the life is in the blood is that right
[1:01:49] and the life of an animal when the
[1:01:52] spirit went out of the life it could not
[1:01:54] come back and mingle with the human
[1:01:56] spirit because it was the life of an
[1:01:58] animal call it who you he says therefore
[1:02:04] the desire became the same he went back
[1:02:08] out when we come into the house of God
[1:02:10] and we go right back out say glory to
[1:02:12] God another weakest sinan for me we're
[1:02:15] no different than the denominations and
[1:02:18] Catholicism and all these things right
[1:02:21] because it's a Catholicism that mazes on
[1:02:23] the idea of the Eucharist you eat Christ
[1:02:25] right so ah now you're all right but you
[1:02:28] got to come back in the morning eat
[1:02:29] again because it's transubstantiation it
[1:02:34] transforms under the literal body of
[1:02:36] Jesus Christ right that's what they
[1:02:37] believe
[1:02:38] but brother sister our sacrifice was
[1:02:40] made 2,000 years ago
[1:02:42] hallelujah it was not about the blood of
[1:02:46] an animal it was the blood of God
[1:02:48] Himself all the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:51] and the power thereof Oh mom hallelujah
[1:02:54] so notice it says the desire became the
[1:02:58] same when he went back how the animal
[1:03:00] life went away the blood cell was broke
[1:03:02] up but when a man lays his hands upon
[1:03:06] the blood of Jesus what did you lay your
[1:03:11] hand on right that's what people do they
[1:03:17] lay their hands on the on the head of
[1:03:19] William Branham and say this is my god
[1:03:21] and then when they start finding out
[1:03:23] that brother branham wasn't perfect when
[1:03:27] they start seeing that he could
[1:03:28] exaggerate a little bit and do do a few
[1:03:30] of these things around there then what
[1:03:31] all of a sudden their confidence is
[1:03:33] destroyed about what they're worshipping
[1:03:38] but the purpose of the messenger was to
[1:03:42] take the people to Christ so notice it
[1:03:46] says but when a man raised his hands
[1:03:49] upon the blood of Jesus the head of
[1:03:51] Jesus confessing his sin when that blood
[1:03:54] cell was broke it was the Holy Spirit of
[1:03:58] Christ Jesus comes back upon the man and
[1:04:01] takes all sin and desire away from his
[1:04:04] heart that's what we're looking for with
[1:04:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost God take
[1:04:10] away the desire he meant and he's
[1:04:13] perfectly redeemed by the blood of Jesus
[1:04:15] Christ and all the sin question is
[1:04:18] settled hallelujah
[1:04:22] Navy brother sister Rita slow hands
[1:04:24] right back on Christ amen I had said
[1:04:27] that sacrifice desire the world that's
[1:04:34] here because there's some there's a
[1:04:36] flavor for everybody now they're making
[1:04:39] hundreds and hundreds of new sports all
[1:04:41] the time
[1:04:42] hallelujah they're making every
[1:04:44] entertainment you can think of what
[1:04:46] because brothers just the only it's
[1:04:47] gonna make it out of here as bride
[1:04:49] because the seed cannot be entertained
[1:04:52] by anything else it wants to be
[1:04:54] entertained by the world but it don't
[1:04:58] matter
[1:04:59] they say how do you do it cam I don't
[1:05:01] you I like I said I told the story we're
[1:05:05] at church already and then at work I
[1:05:07] went there and the biggest anomaly of
[1:05:10] the year was the fact that they found
[1:05:12] out I didn't have a TV in my house and
[1:05:18] my boss came up and he's like is there's
[1:05:20] a huge spectacle
[1:05:21] I was sure in the job trailer it was
[1:05:22] crazy everybody's just like the father I
[1:05:30] didn't have a TV so anyway
[1:05:34] he comes with me he's like you're joking
[1:05:38] weren't you I said no no I wasn't joking
[1:05:43] at all though I said I said you know
[1:05:46] just said you know it's on that TV I
[1:05:48] said I got a I got a taste for a
[1:05:50] different civilization right now I say
[1:05:53] God by the Holy Ghost I said gosh that
[1:05:56] is what God is trying to do see god this
[1:05:59] doesn't want to change your legalisms
[1:06:01] God wants to come inside of you and then
[1:06:04] you desire but nature is different and
[1:06:07] you don't even desire those things no
[1:06:09] more I said when you look at that TV all
[1:06:13] sets on there's things to show you have
[1:06:15] a desire for the realm of hell they
[1:06:19] looked at me he's like Oh didn't know
[1:06:22] what to do with that one so he walked
[1:06:23] away
[1:06:24] well then an hour later he comes back
[1:06:26] around he said so cama you know I got it
[1:06:32] I got TV you know I know I know you do
[1:06:34] Josh Phegley do so but you know I I kind
[1:06:38] of watch the Discovery Channel and you
[1:06:41] know my kids like you know National
[1:06:43] Geographic I said that's okay
[1:06:46] I said I'm talking about it a nature
[1:06:48] change I said something that just
[1:06:51] completely revolutionized the way you
[1:06:53] think he's like okay okay so he walked
[1:07:00] up again he come to me three times in
[1:07:02] the same day
[1:07:04] hey come up he said it's a camera just
[1:07:09] want to tell you you know yeah you'll
[1:07:12] have a TV you know he's like that's
[1:07:16] won't let you know that you know yeah
[1:07:19] ever how's it going to I just wanna let
[1:07:24] you know you know I mean TVs really not
[1:07:26] all that bad you know it's not that bad
[1:07:28] at all he said I just well let you know
[1:07:30] you know if you you ever desire to watch
[1:07:32] TV you know you can come over and watch
[1:07:35] TV with me and my family I said Josh I'm
[1:07:38] the head of my house
[1:07:40] I want to get TV I bring a TV in my
[1:07:43] house but I said I'm telling you that
[1:07:45] the love of Jesus Christ is greater I
[1:07:49] felt like I had my three showdowns and I
[1:07:52] was done after that but but anyway but
[1:07:54] you know it's so crazy that we thing
[1:07:57] different but that's what it is you see
[1:08:00] brother sister the thoughts we have of
[1:08:02] sin have completely changed over because
[1:08:05] we realized that our sin question is
[1:08:08] settled and I don't desire to have a TV
[1:08:12] in my house I desire to do a lot of
[1:08:19] those things of the world don't have it
[1:08:20] I have a hard time putting my kids in
[1:08:22] basketball and you know what we do you
[1:08:27] know they're wearing pants anyway right
[1:08:28] oh that's okay they can play all right I
[1:08:32] figure we can be a light somehow we got
[1:08:36] to get amongst the world brother sister
[1:08:38] not be not in friendship with the world
[1:08:39] is the only entity with God but bro sis
[1:08:41] real shine light I loo you we don't need
[1:08:44] to look coldish we need to look
[1:08:45] completely full of agape love all right
[1:08:49] so notice this so all you do is you put
[1:08:52] your hand on Jesus Christ and what the
[1:08:55] same question is settled get the Holy
[1:08:59] Ghost so I want you to see this as we
[1:09:05] begin to bridge this because I want you
[1:09:07] to see how powerful this is for seal he
[1:09:10] says now they were God's lowercase G
[1:09:13] there and then if you become born in the
[1:09:16] family of your family name you are a son
[1:09:19] and a part of your father and then when
[1:09:21] sin came in we found out the man crossed
[1:09:25] the chasm and the blood of bulls and
[1:09:27] goats covered but did not remit until
[1:09:31] the real bleach came that could take the
[1:09:33] stain of sin and break it completely to
[1:09:36] pieces and send it back upon its
[1:09:39] original pervert earth at was Satan you
[1:09:43] know where all your sins have you've got
[1:09:46] the Holy Ghost they went right back to
[1:09:48] Satan
[1:09:50] you know who what that means that means
[1:09:52] they were his identification they were
[1:09:55] his sin they never had nothing to do
[1:10:00] with you so when it got back to Satan he
[1:10:06] waits his time of eternal annihilation
[1:10:09] now that shows what we believe we
[1:10:12] believe that you will absolutely be done
[1:10:13] completely away in an island and the
[1:10:15] church said Amen hallelujah
[1:10:17] I believe that sin will be broke up and
[1:10:20] when it's confessed upon the basis of
[1:10:22] the blood of Jesus Christ it's like
[1:10:24] dropping a drop of black ink and a bunch
[1:10:26] of Clorox bleach it just breaks it into
[1:10:29] the chemicals and sends it plumb back to
[1:10:31] where it came from that's sin brother
[1:10:34] sister maybe you did earlier there when
[1:10:36] you laid that confession out say God
[1:10:38] forgive me I think I'll for me done this
[1:10:40] blood it went back all the way to them
[1:10:45] right back to that devil where it come
[1:10:48] from hallelujah he couldn't see it if he
[1:10:52] wanted to Duncan
[1:10:54] oh ma and that's the way the blood of
[1:10:59] Jesus Christ does then that sets a man
[1:11:03] across the chasm again as a son of God
[1:11:06] and then he becomes why he's the
[1:11:11] creative power of God is in him and at
[1:11:13] least whenever God can command it to be
[1:11:16] done it'll be done when we get back look
[1:11:19] at if you're on the right side of the
[1:11:21] chasm the cause of the baptism of the
[1:11:23] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost proves he
[1:11:26] you've got the seed notice he says that
[1:11:33] when Moses under the blood of bulls when
[1:11:37] he met that lights the pillar fire in
[1:11:38] that burning bush and he stood down
[1:11:40] there on a commission God had given and
[1:11:42] he was a prophet and when the word of
[1:11:45] the Lord came to him he spoke and even
[1:11:49] things created by the word notice this
[1:11:52] see and now if it'll do that under that
[1:11:57] the blood of bulls what a
[1:12:02] out the blood of Jesus see where we're
[1:12:10] getting you got the Holy Ghost that
[1:12:15] opens up a big big possibility now
[1:12:17] doesn't it so notice he says what about
[1:12:21] the blood of Jesus not covered but
[1:12:23] remitted it all together there's no it's
[1:12:28] not covered its remitted that means God
[1:12:34] has accepted in it's done away with and
[1:12:37] you stand in the presence of God as a
[1:12:40] redeemed son now see the church is far
[1:12:44] beyond its standard of living and I
[1:12:45] think too many times were probing
[1:12:47] instead of really coming out and facing
[1:12:49] the issue the City issue we'd rather
[1:12:52] talk about a spoken word talk about that
[1:12:55] brother/sister spoken word wasn't it was
[1:12:58] a possibility through the shed blood of
[1:13:01] bulls and goats let flies come forth it
[1:13:07] came from a sacrifice of bulls and goats
[1:13:13] so what is it now look at now he states
[1:13:17] it's the problem we're living what he
[1:13:20] says beyond but below our standard of
[1:13:22] living all right and what instead of
[1:13:25] coming out and facing the issue does the
[1:13:27] blood of Jesus Christ really cover my
[1:13:29] sins we just stay there in this
[1:13:32] confusion okay in my Center am I not a
[1:13:34] sinner in my seat or am I not seed what
[1:13:39] am i we've got to get to a place that we
[1:13:42] can boldly say I'm a son of God now
[1:13:44] short by my love I'll short by my fruit
[1:13:46] I short by everything I am hallelujah so
[1:13:51] notice he says and finishing this and
[1:13:53] now notice that there's something wrong
[1:13:54] somewhere in the churches and I think
[1:13:58] it's the denominational systems that's
[1:14:00] twisted the people's mind so forth until
[1:14:02] they don't know how to do it that's
[1:14:05] right
[1:14:05] but we're promised that it would be
[1:14:07] revealed that is the potential that the
[1:14:13] blood opens up it brings you back to the
[1:14:16] the word Amen the spoken word is the
[1:14:20] original seed brother sister we were
[1:14:23] called what not to go just back to
[1:14:26] Pentecost we were called to go all the
[1:14:28] way back to Eden amen hallelujah
[1:14:32] so look at the power of the blood of a
[1:14:34] boar goat
[1:14:36] think about that Sun stand still Joshua
[1:14:43] said who's Jesus Christ he'd be I'll say
[1:14:46] I'm Joshua Jehovah Savior but what he
[1:14:52] did not know the name he was not able to
[1:14:55] recognize the future coming of Christ
[1:14:57] but just knowing that he was under that
[1:15:01] sacrifice just knowing his position in
[1:15:04] the commission from the from God
[1:15:06] Almighty he was able to what look at his
[1:15:09] sacrifice this is where it is brother
[1:15:12] sister are we looking at our sacrifice
[1:15:15] he could look at his sacrifice and say
[1:15:18] in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of
[1:15:21] God today Hebrews 10 one for the law
[1:15:28] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:15:30] and not the very image of the things can
[1:15:33] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:15:35] offered year by year continually make
[1:15:37] the comers thereunto perfect for then
[1:15:40] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:15:43] because that the worshipers once purged
[1:15:46] should have had no more conscience of
[1:15:49] sins oh wow that was the purpose of a
[1:15:52] sacrifice to take away your conscience
[1:15:55] of sins you deliver the book of Acts it
[1:15:59] says in great grace was upon them all
[1:16:01] your grace is unmerited favor oh you
[1:16:06] know when the Holy Ghost found them they
[1:16:08] were 100% perfect then why they need
[1:16:10] great grace they didn't just be grace
[1:16:12] they need great grace
[1:16:17] hallelujah so he says but in those
[1:16:19] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[1:16:21] made of sins every year you notice that
[1:16:25] it's under the sacrifice of bulls and
[1:16:28] goats that there has to be a remembrance
[1:16:29] of sins and so many times you see we
[1:16:36] remember all of our sins
[1:16:39] almost element just as I appreciate dad
[1:16:41] told I said I still remember when I was
[1:16:43] five years old and I was lied about
[1:16:44] having a talking a cockatiel I still
[1:16:48] remember that I was five years old
[1:16:52] trying to win her in him it was wrong
[1:16:55] but I still remember that sin and there
[1:17:06] it sits I'm 38 years old that's 33 years
[1:17:11] ago I said God when I accepted Christ
[1:17:14] said God forgive me everything maybe now
[1:17:15] and then that little thing pops right up
[1:17:23] on us five years old and you know how
[1:17:25] that is if you remember things that fine
[1:17:27] he remember the whole lot of things but
[1:17:30] what your prophet said we're not like
[1:17:33] God he said God he said he can what he
[1:17:37] said he can forgive and forget but we
[1:17:41] because we're in a different dimension
[1:17:42] we cannot forgive and forget hallelujah
[1:17:46] but when we look at this word we should
[1:17:49] be watching it's setting or the basis of
[1:17:52] Jesus Christ shed blood at Calvary amen
[1:17:56] because what it was impossible that the
[1:17:59] blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:18:00] away sins the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:18:02] different notice God hiding himself and
[1:18:07] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:18:08] same he says if you abide in me and my
[1:18:10] words abide in you then ask what you
[1:18:12] will shall be given to you
[1:18:14] where's the church standing at let there
[1:18:18] be frogs and there wasn't a frog in the
[1:18:21] country
[1:18:22] in an hour's time there were ten foot
[1:18:24] deep in places what was it it
[1:18:28] God the Creator hiding himself in a
[1:18:30] simple man notice this I want to ask you
[1:18:34] something if the blood of a ball or a
[1:18:36] goat be used for a bleach which can only
[1:18:40] cover could put a man in position to
[1:18:43] speak the creative Word of God and bring
[1:18:46] flies into existence why would you
[1:18:49] stumble at the bleach of Jesus Christ's
[1:18:51] blood who could speak a squirrel or
[1:18:53] something into existence he said don't
[1:18:59] you do it don't stumble over simplicity
[1:19:02] believe that he still remains God o my
[1:19:05] pardon of sin oh how I wish I could then
[1:19:08] mark 11:22 have you Satan this mountain
[1:19:11] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:19:12] but believe what you that what you said
[1:19:14] will come to pass oh you can have what
[1:19:17] you said how powerful we see that the
[1:19:26] blood of bulls and goats it could put a
[1:19:29] man in a position to speak creative word
[1:19:33] what about the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:19:36] you see I'm saying when's the last time
[1:19:39] you spoke something into existence and
[1:19:41] here's the thing this is not it we're
[1:19:42] not chasing power or it's actually all
[1:19:45] we are I'm not here to say who is who's
[1:19:49] not oh that I don't know but brother
[1:19:51] sister look at what he says he said back
[1:19:56] here he said you see the people have
[1:19:57] been taught wrong I don't know what her
[1:20:01] idea of the squeeze is and all these
[1:20:02] things like that if we're just gonna
[1:20:04] gather well we're all gonna meet at
[1:20:05] brother Jesse's house well write it
[1:20:06] right through brother Jesse takes
[1:20:07] through brother brother branham through
[1:20:14] a lot and there's all you can whole you
[1:20:16] take it all the way back through the
[1:20:17] word there's five identifications of the
[1:20:20] third ball
[1:20:22] he said there's an hour that God's going
[1:20:25] to do some really great things for us
[1:20:28] hallelujah God is going to exorcise
[1:20:31] himself through his children
[1:20:36] but you notice how he's talking about
[1:20:39] the sacrifice and he's talking about how
[1:20:41] even people with a blood of bulls and
[1:20:44] goats mentality and revelation could
[1:20:47] what bring forth all of God's abilities
[1:20:50] on the scene then what about Jesus
[1:20:54] Christ blood here this we say Oh God
[1:20:58] I could just figure it out he says don't
[1:21:01] you stumble over simplicity let's read
[1:21:08] another one God item something
[1:21:10] simplicity says now the blood of bulls
[1:21:12] and goats could give power given power
[1:21:14] to Moses to go out there by the
[1:21:17] commission of God and stretch forth that
[1:21:19] Ron say let there come flies
[1:21:21] he had the Word of God and he spoke that
[1:21:24] word and when he did it become from
[1:21:27] God's thought a word is a thought
[1:21:30] expressed and so then when God thought
[1:21:33] it and put it in Moses his mind and he
[1:21:35] spoke it it become a word did you read
[1:21:39] that he said God thought it and put it
[1:21:44] in Moses mind to speak it where is the
[1:21:49] church that will say but we have the
[1:21:51] mind of Christ we brother/sister should
[1:21:56] have such an experience with the law
[1:21:58] that if God we would even have a thought
[1:22:01] come over us and it would say something
[1:22:04] to the word we would go right with it
[1:22:08] because it's the same thing under the
[1:22:10] blood of bulls and goats God could put a
[1:22:12] thought right in his mind Moses could
[1:22:15] think it Moses could speak it and God
[1:22:18] would bring it forth oh how he wants our
[1:22:23] minds to be watch indeed ouch
[1:22:26] meets for the Masters use he says Moses
[1:22:31] turned around went back maybe did
[1:22:32] another fly in the country an hour from
[1:22:34] then maybe one old green fly begin the
[1:22:37] bus around and a half hour there's ten
[1:22:39] pounds per square yard what was it the
[1:22:41] creative word of god that was spoke by
[1:22:44] the lips of a mortal man
[1:22:48] what's the matter with the church today
[1:22:54] with the pastors today well it's just
[1:22:58] the pastor's or the big name preachers
[1:23:02] or this but no no it's the church in
[1:23:07] every place there's a church was a local
[1:23:09] body right there within that body is the
[1:23:12] ability to have nine spiritual gifts to
[1:23:15] have the fivefold ministry to have what
[1:23:18] all those things promised of God
[1:23:20] manifesting right there so notice what's
[1:23:24] the matter with the church there's
[1:23:25] something wrong my opinion we're not
[1:23:30] coming with that sincerity to the right
[1:23:31] thing for that right if God could do
[1:23:35] that by the blood of a ball goats and
[1:23:37] bulls that only covered sin and made a
[1:23:39] perpetuation for the center but the sin
[1:23:42] was still there only covered over what
[1:23:44] can he do through the blood of his son
[1:23:46] that omits sin and God has not
[1:23:48] manufactured but he created a blood that
[1:23:51] takes away all sin Alleluia Jesus Christ
[1:23:58] didn't come in the blood of a ball or go
[1:24:00] it was especially created God blood shed
[1:24:08] it would hit the target right on saying
[1:24:10] perfect sacrifice it is finished
[1:24:16] hallelujah so notice what's wrong with
[1:24:20] the church's a blood of bulls and goats
[1:24:24] revelation could bring those things
[1:24:26] forward I'll tell you what mister should
[1:24:29] we mean my wife we we went to pick up
[1:24:30] some furniture the about a month or two
[1:24:32] ago and we're driving along the road and
[1:24:35] here we have we forgot one special thing
[1:24:38] we forgot blankets and tarps we're
[1:24:40] driving back on the road and anyway it
[1:24:43] starts sprinkling all over I'm like oh
[1:24:45] no cuz I looked at the radar and it
[1:24:47] wasn't sprinkler or nothing I was
[1:24:49] looking at the radar and it has kind of
[1:24:51] just kind of mood I said I said in the
[1:24:52] name of Jesus Christ rain get back and
[1:24:56] just like in a couple seconds the rain
[1:24:58] was gone
[1:25:00] I really think anything else just like
[1:25:04] glory to God you know he's kept on going
[1:25:05] to driving away I got about 10 15 20
[1:25:07] miles down the road all of a sudden
[1:25:10] start sprinkling on my wings you again
[1:25:12] see you gotta be kidding me
[1:25:15] nice kept driving look at my wife
[1:25:19] feeling a little bit farther I stopped a
[1:25:21] little bit and then this you know it
[1:25:23] rain pretty much almost the whole way
[1:25:24] home we got about halfway home like I
[1:25:26] might man hi I said I see what God did
[1:25:29] that back there I was the Lord and she
[1:25:31] said why did you stop she said God
[1:25:35] listened to you and God listened to that
[1:25:36] the first time why when it came back did
[1:25:39] he just let it go like here's nothing
[1:25:41] then thank God for a good wife even keep
[1:25:48] me in line all right let me God for him
[1:25:51] and I said that's exactly right
[1:25:55] you remember when God told the Prophet
[1:25:57] to speak those four holes and he shot
[1:26:00] him and he couldn't find one and the
[1:26:03] devil was fighting trying to tell him it
[1:26:06] wasn't that way hallelujah just because
[1:26:11] brother sister you say stop or something
[1:26:15] because that's what we got to see was
[1:26:16] that the mind of God
[1:26:19] remember God told brother branham he
[1:26:21] said you had need of those squirrels
[1:26:23] just like Abraham hallelujah and watch
[1:26:31] bringing forth those squirrels he'd go
[1:26:34] to Harry Wright's house and watch she
[1:26:36] would hear that testimony say that's
[1:26:38] exactly the truth they meant and that
[1:26:40] would draw salvation or two boys by the
[1:26:43] third Bowl
[1:26:44] oh ma talk about a revelation of being
[1:26:50] under the blood really quickly let's go
[1:26:53] through some of these things we'll try
[1:26:54] to try to stop pretty quick here I got a
[1:26:56] timer on this computer praise the Living
[1:26:58] God isaiah 43:25 it says i even i am he
[1:27:02] that blotted out by transgression for
[1:27:06] mine own sake Oh hallelujah look what he
[1:27:09] wrote in the book of Galatians here
[1:27:11] that's not Galatians it's
[1:27:16] Old Testament sitting under the blood of
[1:27:19] bulls and goats
[1:27:21] he said I'm blotting out their
[1:27:24] transgression for mine own sake and will
[1:27:31] not remember thy sins hallelujah the
[1:27:36] blood of bulls and goats Isaiah 40
[1:27:39] Father remember these old Jacob in
[1:27:41] Israel for thou art my servant I have
[1:27:43] formerly thou art my servant Eliezer
[1:27:45] thou shall not be forgotten of me
[1:27:48] I have blotted out as a thick cloud by
[1:27:55] transgressions and as a cloud thy sins
[1:27:58] return unto me for I have redeemed thee
[1:28:03] there they were just following the blood
[1:28:09] of bulls and goats and God says I'll
[1:28:11] blot them out what that sin and I can't
[1:28:14] even see it come back to my retention
[1:28:18] Omaha wonder what they did when they
[1:28:25] read that and what if they said well I'm
[1:28:26] in Laodicea I'm gonna worry about that
[1:28:29] when we look at some of the things these
[1:28:31] people did moved on by the Holy Spirit
[1:28:35] couldn't even receive it on Sola it
[1:28:36] could not have the joining yet because
[1:28:38] Christ had not died but they're just
[1:28:40] look at the sacrifice hallelujah Hot
[1:28:46] Springs he sent us Arkansas 63 why says
[1:28:49] now God seen that the blood of bulls and
[1:28:51] goats could not take away sin he never
[1:28:53] manufactured but he created a chemical
[1:28:55] in the blood of Jesus Christ they meant
[1:28:56] that sin once confessed in the right way
[1:29:00] you don't even bridge that chasm you
[1:29:03] take the chasm completely away that
[1:29:06] means there's no way back he can't give
[1:29:09] you the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[1:29:11] you if you once received it let it ever
[1:29:17] be your testimony they ever be in your
[1:29:21] life let it ever be the spoken word out
[1:29:24] of your mouth
[1:29:24] don't bring false accusation
[1:29:27] hallelujah brother Troy preach the
[1:29:28] message one time traitor from brother
[1:29:31] Brooks's church and then he brothers
[1:29:32] message that giving bearing false
[1:29:34] witness of your baptism I still remember
[1:29:37] that title because here we were what
[1:29:42] being baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:44] Jesus Christ and repenting from our sins
[1:29:47] and then all the actions that come from
[1:29:50] our life in our mouth bear false witness
[1:29:52] that we ever were done had it done to us
[1:29:57] hmm the sound of the abundance of rain
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:05] well Olivia what he says I can't make it
[1:30:29] no I've already made it because he
[1:30:33] called me he chose me how can we love
[1:30:39] him how can we serve him so look he says
[1:30:46] and God don't even know that you ever
[1:30:49] sinned the Latin got the Holy Ghost did
[1:30:57] you know right now singing right here at
[1:30:58] this moment God never knew you sinned I
[1:31:01] can't see it that's right he said he put
[1:31:08] them in the sea of forgetfulness to
[1:31:11] remember them no more at all against you
[1:31:13] than men and women stand in the presence
[1:31:15] of God as sons and daughters got the
[1:31:17] very nature of their gods in their
[1:31:19] hearts notice this it is continuous
[1:31:22] where is the church today it's
[1:31:26] constantly over the fact that we think
[1:31:28] we're a whole bunch of big losing
[1:31:30] sinners what's happened to the church
[1:31:34] when we can see that the blood of Jesus
[1:31:37] Christ so remitted sins that God don't
[1:31:39] even remember we see
[1:31:40] then whatever you ask in my name that
[1:31:42] I'll do it
[1:31:44] what's the matter it's because somebody
[1:31:46] has been indoctrinated Scriptures for
[1:31:49] the people called an idiot look at that
[1:31:57] it opens up whatever you ask in my name
[1:32:00] I'll do it when you realize that God
[1:32:04] can't see your sin how many times we
[1:32:06] come to prayer to God her or things like
[1:32:07] that was the Oh God oh my god I gotta
[1:32:09] try to put all this stuff on there man I
[1:32:11] just in case I didn't get it the first
[1:32:13] time come on you know we do it we come
[1:32:17] say Oh God is there anything my life all
[1:32:18] about I'm sure I'm sure
[1:32:19] huh we're staring at ourselves so much
[1:32:25] that we can be no benefit to God you
[1:32:30] remember as Jesus Christ she said ask
[1:32:32] that your joy may be full it was his
[1:32:36] desire for you to ask so that he could
[1:32:39] give it to you because he wants you to
[1:32:41] be happy we're not talking about
[1:32:43] mercedes-benz's and all these things
[1:32:45] we're talking about the blessings of God
[1:32:47] brother sister we're talking about clean
[1:32:51] sanctified lives we're talking about
[1:32:53] healings we're talking about deliverance
[1:32:56] we're talking about our family members
[1:32:58] we're talking about what God drawling
[1:33:00] the scene in some it's hunger I look at
[1:33:04] my mom and say she see I'll tell you
[1:33:07] what I better act like she's seen call
[1:33:10] her hear her better pray like she see
[1:33:13] amen so notice what he says what's the
[1:33:18] matter
[1:33:19] people are flipping these scriptures all
[1:33:21] around we can't even understand who we
[1:33:23] are I'm just reading four different
[1:33:28] quotes for the sister and he says the
[1:33:29] same thing all the time
[1:33:30] what's the matter she will walk out the
[1:33:33] door Oh glory to God 55 I did 56 yeah I
[1:33:44] guess the devil is right I'm a surfing
[1:33:49] don't you know the mayor the city gave
[1:33:51] you rights yeah and where you falter
[1:33:56] he's gonna step up
[1:33:59] just keep that conscience or you're what
[1:34:03] were your you have a fleshie tables in
[1:34:05] the heart when you want to live the word
[1:34:07] and when you feel the devil fight those
[1:34:09] things you look right back to the word
[1:34:14] amen
[1:34:14] so notice what he says he says this is
[1:34:17] the only thing that I can figure has
[1:34:19] been done because God's remedy is still
[1:34:22] the same
[1:34:25] notice now it's dangerous to refuse the
[1:34:28] doctors inoculation how much more God
[1:34:31] it's dangerous when we refuse the
[1:34:34] revelation notice back in Micah where
[1:34:40] did he get this from 18 it says who is a
[1:34:43] God like unto thee now that partner
[1:34:46] synuclein passes by the transgression of
[1:34:48] the remnant of his heritage he retain if
[1:34:52] not his anger forever because he
[1:34:53] delighteth in mercy you knows that God
[1:34:57] likes mercy he delights in that holla
[1:35:02] new you you've sinned or die God I'm
[1:35:03] gonna give you mercy he will turn again
[1:35:08] he will have compassion upon us he will
[1:35:10] subdue our iniquities he's going to
[1:35:12] subdue them and thou will cast all their
[1:35:16] sins into the depths of the sea that's
[1:35:19] where we get what he put your sins in
[1:35:22] the sea we're talking in the Old
[1:35:33] Testament he made the sacrifice of the
[1:35:40] blood of a Borg and he can look and say
[1:35:43] who is a God like unto thee guess all of
[1:35:48] our sins just from the revelation of
[1:35:52] following up a type with a blood of a
[1:35:56] boar go
[1:35:58] I will perform the truth to Jacob in the
[1:36:01] Mersey to Abraham which thou has sworn
[1:36:03] unto our fathers from the days of all
[1:36:05] Omaha look he says he says he the
[1:36:09] bridegroom took away your shame put in
[1:36:11] the sea of forgetfulness by the washing
[1:36:13] in the water of the word and the blood
[1:36:14] of life that's what the Bible said your
[1:36:16] first husband that you were married to
[1:36:18] the world the anointed bridegroom he
[1:36:20] said to the world he says the anointed
[1:36:22] bridegroom was 14 who has washed you by
[1:36:24] all the washing of the water of the word
[1:36:26] by the church no that don't sound right
[1:36:29] does it no you might find that in the
[1:36:32] Almanac but not in God's Bible
[1:36:37] hallelujah why our sins where are thy
[1:36:41] the few setters you are standing
[1:36:47] completely justified as though you never
[1:36:50] did it and at the beginning this is my
[1:36:53] message to the church now as we go off
[1:36:56] here just the man you are standing if
[1:36:58] you're standing on God's Word with God's
[1:37:00] Word every Amen every jot every tittle
[1:37:03] where you standing I'm trying to tell
[1:37:04] you pull away from them shucks see get
[1:37:09] out here in the week where you can get
[1:37:11] right before the Sun I hear the coming
[1:37:13] of the combat you're standing complete
[1:37:15] justified like you never did it in the
[1:37:16] first place
[1:37:17] hallelujah it's a very timely message
[1:37:20] because notice you talk about of
[1:37:21] Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more
[1:37:25] thankful for that than anything I know
[1:37:29] of a sacrifice that he could look that
[1:37:33] could justify him to a place he never
[1:37:36] did it in the first place back to the
[1:37:42] blood of bulls and goats then poor
[1:37:44] fellows had to live under this type of a
[1:37:45] revelation and at something Psalms 103 8
[1:37:48] it says the Lord is merciful and
[1:37:49] gracious slow to anger and plenteous in
[1:37:51] mercy he will not always try neither
[1:37:53] will he keep his anger forever he has
[1:37:55] not dealt with us after our sins nor
[1:38:00] rewarded US according to our iniquities
[1:38:02] with the blood of bulls and goats for as
[1:38:06] the heaven is high above the earth so
[1:38:08] great is his mercy towards them that
[1:38:10] fear Him
[1:38:11] notice as far as the East is from the
[1:38:14] west so far hath he removed our
[1:38:17] transgressions from us oh the blood of
[1:38:20] both and ghosts
[1:38:23] it could give them such a revelation see
[1:38:28] we're not talking about the circle of
[1:38:29] the earth it says the far as the east is
[1:38:32] from the west there's no place back why
[1:38:43] do you think that those Saints could go
[1:38:45] into Abraham's bosom and then when
[1:38:47] Christ came they could take our rapture
[1:38:54] numbers 23 18 he took up his Perrigo
[1:38:57] elbow talking about Balaam here
[1:38:59] Balaam did everything he could to
[1:39:01] destroy the children of Israel he took
[1:39:04] up a parable and said rise up Balak in
[1:39:06] here hearken unto me thou son of the
[1:39:08] poor God is not a man that he should lie
[1:39:10] neither the son of man that he should
[1:39:11] repent have he said and shall he not do
[1:39:15] it or has he spoken and shall he not
[1:39:17] make it good
[1:39:18] behold I received commandment to bless
[1:39:22] and he has blessed and I cannot reverse
[1:39:25] it he hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob
[1:39:30] look at this an ordained prophet with
[1:39:36] the little gift of a prophet I'll curse
[1:39:41] them I couldn't do it notice Satan can't
[1:39:50] even go through the blood of bulls and
[1:39:52] goats to curse God's children notice you
[1:40:07] have not behold iniquity and Jacob
[1:40:09] neither has he seen perverseness the
[1:40:14] whole perversion could even see it the
[1:40:18] Lord his God is with him and the shout
[1:40:20] of a king is among them
[1:40:21] oh ha God has brought them out of Egypt
[1:40:24] he has
[1:40:25] that were the strength of a unicorn
[1:40:27] that's all he could say he brought them
[1:40:31] out of Egypt hear that water they come
[1:40:34] up to the first issue no water
[1:40:37] complained murmur and let's go back to
[1:40:39] Egypt had to small to rock had to do
[1:40:44] that a couple of times cos Moses coming
[1:40:46] into the Promised Land
[1:40:49] complained cuz it in there but then
[1:40:50] their food God gave them manna and here
[1:40:55] it comes back around God says they have
[1:40:58] the strength of a unicorn I haven't even
[1:41:00] seen any perverseness you know hum I
[1:41:03] don't know what you're looking at BAE
[1:41:05] look but that's not what notice surely
[1:41:10] there is no enchantment against Jacob
[1:41:12] neither is there any divination against
[1:41:15] Israel according to this time it shall
[1:41:17] be said of Jacob and of Israel look at
[1:41:19] this what F God wrought if God could
[1:41:27] look at Israel and what could say this
[1:41:31] is what you should be saying about them
[1:41:33] what hath God wrought in front of it
[1:41:42] here they were complaining murmuring and
[1:41:44] God could not see it
[1:41:46] blood sacrifice their caller lujah so
[1:41:52] you see the only time Satan can get the
[1:41:55] upper hand is when you forfeit it
[1:41:59] absolutely for free we're closed just
[1:42:10] play these quotes in here very beautiful
[1:42:20] finish off on this he says as many of
[1:42:23] the things as I were approaching the new
[1:42:26] year that I wished I could forget about
[1:42:28] but I know I've confessed them as wrong
[1:42:30] to him and he put them in the sea of
[1:42:34] forgetfulness notices brother branham
[1:42:38] you there's many of the things I wish I
[1:42:43] could forget about OMA I confess them as
[1:42:49] wrong to him and he would put them in
[1:42:51] the sea of forgetfulness and he won't
[1:42:54] never remember them no more
[1:42:55] he said now see we're not made that way
[1:42:59] we'll always remember we can forgive one
[1:43:01] another but we can't forget about it
[1:43:03] because we're made different but God can
[1:43:06] forgive it and forget it he can just
[1:43:09] wipe it out as though it never lost see
[1:43:12] because he has access to that sea of
[1:43:15] forgetfulness but we don't hallelujah
[1:43:20] you know if you had access to it or I a
[1:43:22] Texters we should be trying to get away
[1:43:24] with stuff but God didn't make it that
[1:43:32] way he makes us a lot that you can
[1:43:35] forgive but not forget because then we
[1:43:40] can depend on someone who has an access
[1:43:42] to it he says just think of it that God
[1:43:47] cannot even remember that we ever sinned
[1:43:50] think of that choir you young folks what
[1:43:53] if what about it God don't even remember
[1:43:55] that we said see he can forget the whole
[1:43:57] thing and never will be brought into
[1:43:59] memory anymore wouldn't that be
[1:44:01] something
[1:44:04] hallelujah what's the hymn very simple
[1:44:09] message brother sister I want us to see
[1:44:11] this if we can identify ourselves and
[1:44:16] say I've got the Holy Ghost then you see
[1:44:20] how that changes everything about us I
[1:44:24] want to tell you something just for a
[1:44:26] moment here when we first come into this
[1:44:28] message it's probably pride 2003-2004 a
[1:44:31] couple years in
[1:44:34] fold this three airplane most people I
[1:44:36] know this year and anyway there's a
[1:44:39] brother who it invited me to come down
[1:44:44] and go hunting with his on a Saturday
[1:44:47] was on a Friday night he called me said
[1:44:49] he said break and we'll come down Hawk
[1:44:51] and I said well I said I want to you but
[1:44:56] I got a preach I won't spend as much
[1:44:58] time as I can getting ready for the
[1:45:00] ministry and I kind of bugged me a
[1:45:02] little bit and then you find that going
[1:45:04] that's something just fun yeah yeah yeah
[1:45:20] I said brother you're a spoken word
[1:45:22] charlie god I said what would you say if
[1:45:27] I told you that you could squeak at deer
[1:45:28] news this isn't you would have I said
[1:45:34] you believe God couldn't do that I said
[1:45:37] yeah probably I'm sure yeah why not I
[1:45:38] can do that then I was just like I can't
[1:45:46] say that it felt like the laws are
[1:45:48] breaking or anything and I said brother
[1:45:51] I said you said you were smoking words
[1:45:53] so that God didn't get I said yeah I
[1:45:55] said so you could speak on your new
[1:46:00] assistant Simone you could have that I
[1:46:02] said do you think God will do that I
[1:46:04] said when you made that statement you
[1:46:06] said well I think so I said with faith
[1:46:10] you can't say I think that's right I
[1:46:12] said you believe anyone Larson he said
[1:46:16] sure I think so
[1:46:17] I said no you said it again I said you
[1:46:19] have to to say it and believe it and say
[1:46:23] God is gonna give me that dear and that
[1:46:25] was tomorrow
[1:46:28] they said I could tell something movies
[1:46:32] in he said yeah he said God's gonna give
[1:46:34] me a deer tonight I said brother let's
[1:46:37] just take that a step farther I said
[1:46:39] what kind of deer is God gonna give he
[1:46:43] said God's gonna give me a 10-point buck
[1:46:46] I said he is he's sitting sure is I said
[1:46:55] I'll tell you what you spoke that with
[1:46:58] faith I said you call me tell me about
[1:47:00] that father he said I got off the phone
[1:47:05] noon the next day call me
[1:47:09] they said he said birth camp you'll
[1:47:13] never guess sorry no he said I got me a
[1:47:16] temple he said praise be a cop
[1:47:21] and we just had a little we had a little
[1:47:23] shopping time but I'm telling you all
[1:47:25] this for that I said there are laws I
[1:47:28] knew hardly anything about it yeah
[1:47:30] are you hardly anything about how to
[1:47:33] take through the scripture the oneness
[1:47:35] of God and all these things and all the
[1:47:37] mysteries and then God could just take a
[1:47:40] simple simple person it just be in the
[1:47:48] right position and to take the right
[1:47:50] thought to realize that thought was from
[1:47:52] God and to bring that fall forward and
[1:47:55] God can bring it I believe without a
[1:47:59] shadow of doubt right now for the sister
[1:48:00] don't put that do you they're right he's
[1:48:03] not back here there he's spoken there
[1:48:07] that night before yes yes and this is
[1:48:15] where these things troubles from sister
[1:48:17] because you know it's not this complex
[1:48:28] thing that we put so far we we just we
[1:48:34] had faith in our sacrifice faith that
[1:48:36] God could actually speak to our minds
[1:48:38] and then it was is soft and that we
[1:48:41] could speak that saw you manifest itself
[1:48:47] God's gonna do it again varies God but
[1:48:51] what troubled me brother sister is in
[1:48:53] you know a couple years after that break
[1:48:55] five years after that the brother
[1:48:57] completely backs
[1:48:59] right now I'm still I said okay so your
[1:49:04] brother's right and yeah we say these
[1:49:40] groceries I know that's a very very
[1:49:42] simple message but could you imagine if
[1:49:44] we applied that's we imagine a loser
[1:49:46] what's the matter with our churches
[1:49:48] what's the matter with us yeah Jesus
[1:49:52] Christ
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:10] brother sister we just went through
[1:50:12] those things to show you that those
[1:50:14] season that's so far away God the word
[1:50:19] is already I believe loving and being
[1:50:29] willing then when God speaks we
[1:50:32] identified as the word go that's a mess
[1:50:35] Lord what's your plan you got a blood
[1:50:44] that completely omit yours yes I
[1:50:47] encouraged you from the sister do you
[1:50:49] think you've got all the ghosts you
[1:50:50] believe you've got the Holy Ghost six
[1:50:51] would say that's not the word to say if
[1:50:53] you believe you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:50:55] yes so I asked you tonight brothers
[1:51:07] sisters we get ready to pray what's
[1:51:09] there
[1:51:11] if we sit as a as a group of believers
[1:51:14] born again into the bottom how that
[1:51:18] changes our mentality my friends how it
[1:51:22] does away with a lot of the things that
[1:51:24] start Henry's and we could just lay them
[1:51:28] that blood and trust the one who has the
[1:51:30] access to this year yes as we look at
[1:51:36] this coming to the closing of time god
[1:51:41] help us that we might be able to see
[1:51:43] ourselves clear God is making us do this
[1:51:46] part
[1:51:47] let's pray our most precious Lord Jesus
[1:51:49] Christ a little simple message God about
[1:51:53] looking at the blood of Jesus Christ how
[1:51:56] powerful that blood is how much more for
[1:51:59] this blood home in our sins how much
[1:52:01] more could it take away the desires of
[1:52:04] sin and Lord maybe a lot of times we we
[1:52:07] get so back slid got it
[1:52:09] the Lord it seems like we really do
[1:52:10] desire to sin but Lord you know deep
[1:52:12] down we don't want to do it there's none
[1:52:17] of us here free from mistakes even
[1:52:19] brother Brown Camus who said many times
[1:52:21] but yet Lord and all those times he
[1:52:24] covered them put him under the blow Lord
[1:52:30] we want to be and we know we look at
[1:52:35] ourselves we don't see condemned remove
[1:52:38] ourselves we don't see you are worthless
[1:52:39] but yet when we look at ourselves we see
[1:52:45] a son or daughter of God that has the
[1:52:48] Holy Ghost it's on their way to the
[1:52:49] rapture that all things are possible - I
[1:52:53] mean starting living under the blessings
[1:52:56] of that blood we pray O God give us the
[1:52:58] mind of Christ take us far away from any
[1:53:01] layer of the sea and thought any label
[1:53:04] to see in a way and nor place us into a
[1:53:07] position then we can see more clearly
[1:53:10] what you've given in forces we love you
[1:53:14] Lord we're asking order you touch every
[1:53:16] heart you see Oh God Norman maybe a lot
[1:53:20] of times we just really get hard on
[1:53:23] ourselves
[1:53:23] or mistrust tonight Lord he give us a
[1:53:25] mercy give us a revelation ago take us
[1:53:29] to a place oh come we can become more
[1:53:31] fit than finding the bosses made me to
[1:53:35] be lord I pray around or does this word
[1:53:38] has been sown more than we of God would
[1:53:41] take a good look at ourselves in our
[1:53:42] churches and see oh god how we can
[1:53:45] better implement this work then we've
[1:53:49] been perhaps let us straight Philippe
[1:53:54] maybe we have the right night
[1:53:57] nothing it's about Maury power and all
[1:54:00] these things like that but Lord it's
[1:54:01] only fill your word we just want be so
[1:54:04] set aside how once was
[1:54:07] we're struggling I should head away now
[1:54:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:32] [Music]
[1:54:35] [Applause]
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:56:00] [Applause]
[1:56:25] nobody would just for the wonderful
[1:56:34] message what that was didn't remember
[1:56:52] them
[1:56:54] hols of goats he's forever
[1:57:02] I know opps I know what I used to be so
[1:57:10] he's forever perfected how do you want
[1:57:16] to see yourself the way he sees you I
[1:57:19] want to see myself as he sees me confess
[1:57:25] don't listen let's just take a moment
[1:57:26] and best any sin as we pray Heavenly
[1:57:29] Father we know we heard tonight the seed
[1:57:31] of God does not sin
[1:57:32] we heard that that is so true absolutely
[1:57:38] no more than our flesh we make mistakes
[1:57:44] and that's what we might call me a
[1:57:45] sinner bar by something like that but we
[1:57:48] know the soul never could sit again once
[1:57:51] it's wicked
[1:57:55] what a refreshing that is for me tonight
[1:57:58] I surely need this message here tonight
[1:58:00] what sin there's no sin imputed to my
[1:58:04] soul blessed is a man of sin is not
[1:58:07] compute David despise the blessedness of
[1:58:12] this man I believe you describe it us
[1:58:15] tonight Lord God our Father help us Lord
[1:58:19] Jesus to recognize that our soul does
[1:58:22] not listen when the our soul always
[1:58:24] believes and forgive us when we make
[1:58:29] mistakes yes give us when we grieve the
[1:58:35] Holy Spirit in our thought life and then
[1:58:38] we sang the wrong word or we think or we
[1:58:45] respond the wrong way to stuff forgive
[1:58:47] us we didn't mean to do that
[1:58:53] then Lord we know when our heart
[1:58:55] condemns us now we can ask what we will
[1:58:57] as our brother says for a 10-point bucks
[1:59:00] world's for salvation of souls we can
[1:59:04] ask what we want it'll be given to us
[1:59:07] because a heart condemns us that Father
[1:59:13] forgive us Lord God of us to see
[1:59:16] ourselves now you as soon as we confess
