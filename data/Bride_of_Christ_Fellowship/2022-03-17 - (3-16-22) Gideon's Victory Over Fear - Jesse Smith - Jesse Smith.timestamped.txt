[22:26] father we'll give you all the praise on
[22:27] our door in jesus christ's name the
[22:29] saint said
[22:30] amen let's take our bibles here tonight
[22:32] by god's grace
[22:38] let's go to judges chapter 6 i was just
[22:40] praying today and i thought
[22:42] i thought about you know last wednesday
[22:43] how we looked at fear and
[22:47] the thought of gideon came to my mind
[22:49] and how he battled fear so
[22:51] it's been eight years since i preached
[22:53] sean gideon
[22:55] so i pulled out an old sermon from a
[22:57] while ago and we'll see the inspiration
[22:58] that
[22:59] god gives me here by god's grace i'd
[23:01] like to just preach on
[23:04] gideon's victory over fear so judges
[23:06] chapter 6.
[23:17] judges chapter 6.
[23:34] huh
[23:36] now let's go to a verse about getting
[23:38] here
[23:45] let's read 11 and 12 if we can together
[23:48] judges 6 11 and 12.
[24:01] judges 6 11 and 12. thank you hon
[24:03] all right let's read this on through if
[24:04] we can ready one two three
[24:07] and there came an angel of the lord and
[24:11] sat under an oak which was in orpha
[24:15] that pertained unto joash the abby
[24:18] urzite
[24:20] and his son gideon threshed wheat by the
[24:23] wine press
[24:24] to hide it from the midianites in verse
[24:27] 12 and the angel of the lord appeared
[24:30] unto him and said unto him the lord is
[24:33] with thee thou almighty man of valor may
[24:37] god has blessings to being of his word
[24:38] you may be seated
[24:43] i just want to call this gideon's
[24:45] victory over fear
[24:48] we'll see how far we get with this and
[24:50] uh it's been years like i said since i
[24:52] preached this i was looking at the notes
[24:53] today and i trust to be a blessing you
[24:55] know everybody got nice feedback about
[24:57] last
[24:58] wednesday night service about overcoming
[25:00] fear
[25:01] and so again i just kind of felt led
[25:02] like maybe i like to look back at this
[25:05] here by god's grace
[25:08] so gideon's a great character in the
[25:10] bible
[25:13] the bible mentions him in actually
[25:14] hebrews 11. so let's go to hebrews 11.
[25:19] and we'll see how gideon is mentioned
[25:21] here in the scripture
[25:23] he's called a man of faith
[25:25] so
[25:26] hebrews 11 32 hebrews 11 32.
[25:38] sometimes if we could you know if we
[25:39] could have talked to gideon before all
[25:40] this happened and someone would ask him
[25:42] and said brother get in are you a man of
[25:44] faith
[25:45] he probably would not have said yes
[25:47] because remember we're going to revisit
[25:49] some of his history
[25:52] he probably would have
[25:54] maybe laughed at you or maybe
[25:56] maybe just got humble and cried or felt
[25:58] bad about it
[26:02] but before this uh
[26:04] calling that god placed upon his life
[26:08] he the bible says he was the least in
[26:09] his father's house
[26:13] right we kind of saw that remember when
[26:14] we looked at leah you know a couple
[26:15] years ago
[26:16] how she was the despised one she wasn't
[26:18] the pretty one
[26:20] she wasn't the one everybody liked you
[26:22] know rachel was the one everybody liked
[26:23] and
[26:24] i just love how god condescends and
[26:26] humbles himself he god brings himself
[26:28] down to we'd say the least esteemed
[26:31] and that's in the new testament church
[26:32] too the bible says let them judge in the
[26:34] church who are lease esteemed
[26:37] so we would we would steam preachers
[26:39] right we would esteem deacons and song
[26:40] leaders and you know they're voted upon
[26:42] they're the offices in the church but
[26:44] the bible says
[26:46] god has special grace and wisdom upon
[26:49] the least esteemed
[26:51] because they're the most humble
[26:53] now in most cases yes the pastor will
[26:55] judge things but paul's making a point
[26:57] that
[26:58] it's the humble people many times that
[27:00] god is directly speaking to many times
[27:04] they can be because they're humble they
[27:06] can be taught things they can recognize
[27:07] the presence of the lord their minds are
[27:09] meditating on the things of god
[27:11] not that the leaders aren't
[27:13] but we know it's true in a lot of
[27:15] churches if the leaders fall if leaders
[27:17] get
[27:18] distracted if the leaders make mistakes
[27:20] then the whole church goes that way
[27:22] right many times the whole church goes
[27:24] that way
[27:25] but yeah there could be still some
[27:26] believers there and we've all met them
[27:27] like people that have left churches that
[27:29] are struggling or left churches that
[27:30] were in sin there were still some
[27:32] spiritual people in there
[27:34] and they tried to help out the church
[27:36] but maybe they got to the point where
[27:37] the holy spirit told them you know it's
[27:39] really not going to turn around
[27:41] and it's time to move on
[27:45] but paul specifically says that let them
[27:48] judge who are least esteemed in the
[27:50] church so no doubt the least esteem
[27:52] would probably be children or sisters
[27:54] right just because of
[27:56] the setup of the bible the bible sets up
[27:57] god christ man woman
[28:00] right so just looking at god's order the
[28:02] least esteemed
[28:04] would probably be children and women but
[28:06] god says
[28:08] i've uh he's he's put the body together
[28:11] he's placed the body together in such a
[28:13] way that every joint supplies a need
[28:16] every person can be used by god in other
[28:18] words to help somebody else praise god
[28:20] in other words the prayers of our
[28:22] sisters are just as powerful as the
[28:23] prayers of the brothers
[28:25] amen
[28:27] and god honors our sisters in special
[28:29] ways god honors the children in special
[28:31] ways when they act upon the faith that
[28:33] they've received amen
[28:34] god does the same with our brothers
[28:38] but
[28:39] i like this thought here how gideon is
[28:41] least esteemed in his father's house he
[28:44] wasn't the the sibling where you say oh
[28:46] that he's a real warrior that guy's a
[28:48] real warrior
[28:50] he was kind of the
[28:51] the run of the family
[28:53] okay
[28:55] so in hebrews 11 32 the bible says and
[28:58] what shall i more say
[29:00] for time would fail me to tell of
[29:02] there's gideon
[29:04] and of barrick who came shortly after
[29:07] gideon and of samson
[29:10] and of jephthah and of david also and
[29:13] samuel and of the prophets
[29:15] who through faith subdued kingdoms and
[29:17] that's exactly what gideon did
[29:20] he took down kingdoms of armies praise
[29:22] god
[29:24] uh the bible says it was a number as a
[29:26] number of grasshoppers
[29:28] now we've many of us probably haven't
[29:30] seen that i don't think i have where a
[29:31] whole field has been full of
[29:33] grasshoppers and you see them jump
[29:34] around now we've seen what are those
[29:36] birds swarming around here we see them
[29:37] all the time
[29:38] was
[29:40] okay i always forget that we see the
[29:42] starlings flying around austin we see
[29:43] them
[29:44] there's that that's something similar to
[29:46] that
[29:47] you know the midianites were this awful
[29:49] country
[29:50] and they they swarmed like that we'd say
[29:52] they were swarming
[29:54] it was a major kingdom
[29:57] but how did getting overcome he overcome
[29:59] by faith
[30:00] and faith is an assurance praise god
[30:03] faith is a trust in god almighty
[30:06] and they worked righteousness they
[30:08] obtained promises stop the mouse of
[30:11] lions
[30:12] quench the violence of fire escape the
[30:14] edge of the sword out of weakness
[30:17] we're made strong now we ought to say
[30:19] amen to that praise god
[30:21] because now we can all see ourselves in
[30:23] this scripture or we can see hope for
[30:25] our futures amen
[30:26] no matter how weak we've been no matter
[30:28] how little we've been or no matter even
[30:30] how the great blessings god has blessed
[30:31] us when god still wants to use us god
[30:34] still takes weak people and makes them
[30:37] strong
[30:38] praise god and of course if god ever did
[30:40] anything great in you you realize well
[30:42] that wasn't you anyway so you ought to
[30:44] return to being weak again amen
[30:46] and consider yourself how weak you are
[30:48] praise god
[30:49] because it is only god who makes us
[30:51] strong the bible says be strong in the
[30:53] lord and the power of his might amen
[30:56] in ephesians chapter six
[30:59] by faith they were waxed
[31:00] valiant and fight
[31:03] now that valiant's very close to what uh
[31:05] gideon's called a man of valor
[31:07] a man of courage and bravery
[31:10] right
[31:11] and turn to flight the armies
[31:14] of the aliens now sisters you ought to
[31:15] say amen on 35 women receive their dead
[31:18] to raise the life again look god put
[31:20] sisters in there see god god's not
[31:22] partial amen god will use both male and
[31:25] female children young and old he'll use
[31:27] anybody who wants to honor him because
[31:29] the bible said god will honor him who
[31:31] honors god
[31:33] amen
[31:34] others were tortured not accepting
[31:36] deliverance that they might obtain a
[31:38] better resurrection
[31:40] and we read this a few wednesdays ago as
[31:42] well and others had trial of cruel
[31:44] mockings and scourgings they were weak
[31:46] absolutely whipped beaten
[31:48] yay moreover a bonds and imprisonment
[31:51] they were stoned they were sawn asunder
[31:53] were tempted were slain with the sword
[31:56] they wondered about in sheepskins and
[31:57] goat skins being destitute afflicted
[31:59] tormented of whom the world was not
[32:02] worthy amen think about that now just go
[32:05] now to john the baptist and
[32:07] herod my mind goes to that the world was
[32:10] not worthy though herod and herodias
[32:12] were not worthy of a man like john the
[32:14] baptist standing there rebuking them
[32:16] amen
[32:18] they weren't worthy of that
[32:19] yet herod observed him for a little
[32:21] while remember that he observed some of
[32:22] the things he said
[32:24] when it comes down to his marriage and
[32:25] divorce you know being an adulteress
[32:29] uh he didn't like that right and he let
[32:30] his wife talk him into ending john's
[32:32] life of course through deception
[32:36] but think about that they weren't worthy
[32:37] of that they weren't worthy of a man
[32:39] like john the baptist what about today
[32:42] praise god
[32:43] was all those denominations worthy of a
[32:45] man like brother branham that would bawl
[32:47] them out praise god
[32:49] he would take their gifts to them and
[32:51] manifest manifest his gifts to them
[32:54] were they worthy of that no
[32:57] of whom the world was not worthy praise
[32:59] god
[33:00] they wandered in deserts and mountains
[33:02] and dens and in caves of the earth
[33:06] and these all having obtained a good
[33:08] report through faith receive not the
[33:10] promise
[33:11] now of course they were speaking of the
[33:12] resurrection promise right
[33:15] god having provided some better thing
[33:17] for us
[33:18] see that they without us
[33:21] should not be made perfect amen in other
[33:23] words perfection will come when all the
[33:25] saints depart me
[33:27] when all the saints are gathered
[33:29] together and the bible says it in
[33:31] ephesians chapter 1 when god brings all
[33:34] things together in jesus christ amen
[33:37] they all look for that they all look for
[33:38] the the body change they all look for
[33:40] the coming of the messiah they all look
[33:42] for the the end of all the trouble the
[33:43] end of all the strife they all look for
[33:45] that praise god but they could not be
[33:47] made perfect without us amen in other
[33:49] words god knew there was going to come
[33:51] more people that have faith praise god
[33:53] after gideon amen there's going to
[33:54] become more people that have faith after
[33:56] john the baptist praise god think about
[33:58] it there's going to come people that
[33:59] have more faith after brother branham
[34:02] in church you and i should place
[34:03] ourselves in there i'm one of them amen
[34:06] my faith might be small like a mustard
[34:08] seed but that's all i need amen
[34:11] is that right that's what jesus said if
[34:13] you have faith as the size of a mustard
[34:15] seed grain he said you can say to the
[34:17] mountain move and it'll move praise god
[34:20] so what does that mean what does that
[34:21] mean god asks when you have faith you
[34:24] have confidence in god you have
[34:25] assurance in god in other words god has
[34:27] made known his will to you praise god
[34:31] and so we see gideon at the end of
[34:34] hebrews 11 through faith he subdued
[34:37] kingdoms amen
[34:39] through faith he waxed valiant and fight
[34:42] because remember as the story goes on we
[34:44] hear about the sword of the lord but
[34:47] also the sword of gideon
[34:49] in other words in other words god is
[34:51] going to fight parts of your battles now
[34:52] some battles he may fight the whole
[34:54] thing
[34:55] but there's going to come a time where
[34:56] god's going to let you fight as well
[34:58] god's going to let you speak the word
[35:00] amen
[35:01] god's gonna let you uh quote the
[35:03] scripture praise god god is gonna let
[35:05] you take a stand on the word of god and
[35:08] you're gonna see the word of god be
[35:10] active in your life amen
[35:13] and then you're gonna know what it's
[35:15] like where the bible where jesus said
[35:16] speak to the mountain and you're going
[35:18] to speak to a problem and the problem is
[35:20] going to move amen but don't get puffed
[35:22] up just remember you got a powerful god
[35:24] that gave you that sword amen
[35:26] hallelujah that's where you get all the
[35:27] victories from
[35:29] now
[35:31] gideon is called a man of faith but back
[35:33] in judges
[35:36] chapter 6
[35:38] we read verse 11 he was hiding
[35:41] from the midianites
[35:44] he was hiding he was threshing wheat by
[35:46] the wine press to hide it from the
[35:48] midnight so they normally didn't thresh
[35:50] wheat there they would thresh wheat in
[35:51] another place but he had to hide behind
[35:54] the wine press
[35:55] in order to not be seen by the
[35:57] midianites now church if you look
[35:59] earlier in the chapter
[36:02] the midianites would come every year at
[36:04] harvest time
[36:06] for seven years the midianites would
[36:08] come and they they would the israelites
[36:10] would be plowing or weeding they'd be
[36:11] taking care of their and every year they
[36:13] start hearing the sound of armies coming
[36:16] and then pretty soon the armies would
[36:18] surround their lands and they knew it
[36:20] was the midianites
[36:21] and the midianites would watch and the
[36:23] armies would watch them and wait until
[36:25] it was harvest time and when they saw
[36:26] the israelites going out to harvest they
[36:28] would rush in and they would take all
[36:31] the grain
[36:32] they would take all everything they
[36:33] worked for
[36:34] for four months five months six months
[36:36] seven months depending on the crop that
[36:38] you used they lost it for seven years in
[36:40] a row
[36:41] and the bible said they would take all
[36:42] their animals too what would you do
[36:46] all the animals all the bread all the
[36:48] wheat every all the barley
[36:51] so i don't know how they did they must
[36:52] have like uh
[36:53] had people travel to other countries to
[36:55] bring in and then start all over again
[36:57] that year
[36:59] for seven years in a row and the bible
[37:02] tells us why did this happen why did
[37:04] they get in such a spot where every year
[37:05] they were robbed my
[37:08] every year they lost all that they
[37:10] worked for see there's reason people
[37:12] can't get ahead in life and we've met
[37:14] them
[37:15] there's a reason some people can't get
[37:16] ahead it's because of disobedience
[37:21] in verse one the bible says that uh the
[37:23] lord delivered israel into minions hands
[37:25] for seven years
[37:28] and in verse two it said it was it
[37:30] emitting prevailed against israel
[37:32] because
[37:33] uh and then even israel they made dens
[37:36] in the mountains and caves and
[37:37] strongholds
[37:40] they were so afraid of the midnights
[37:41] they would go build houses in the
[37:43] mountains to hide out from them
[37:45] and they would try to take a little bit
[37:47] of their
[37:48] animals and they tried to go hide up
[37:50] there in the mountains so the midnights
[37:51] wouldn't come get em
[37:53] in other words they were in other words
[37:54] let me say this they were running from
[37:55] the problems
[37:57] amen how many how many you ever battle
[37:59] running from you don't raise your hand
[38:00] how many we all we all do i would say we
[38:02] all battle running from problems
[38:05] right
[38:06] we all like to avoid problems we all
[38:08] like to avoid the battles right
[38:11] but this was israel's fault it was it
[38:13] was their own fault they were bringing
[38:15] this robbing upon them amen
[38:18] they were bringing this loss upon them
[38:21] they knew better
[38:23] but they still continued to live in sin
[38:25] they still continue to disobey the word
[38:27] of god
[38:28] and so every year like a cycle this is
[38:30] the cycle you don't want to get in
[38:31] you're getting a cycle of blessing after
[38:33] blessing after blessing amen you want to
[38:36] labor and plant invest and then see the
[38:39] harvest praise god you want to plant
[38:41] plant plant harvest plant plant plant
[38:44] harvest but they were plant plant plant
[38:46] robbing plant plant plant losing plant
[38:48] plant plant loss everything
[38:50] it was it was awful fix to be in
[38:55] and the bible says
[38:57] they would come and encamp in verse 4
[38:59] and then leave them nothing can you
[39:01] imagine
[39:03] look think think about your uh
[39:05] yourselves at home right now your fridge
[39:07] it's all it's full maybe half full maybe
[39:09] you got to get to the grocery you know
[39:10] how much maybe you can relate tonight to
[39:12] the
[39:12] israelites you know
[39:14] sometimes every now and then we get
[39:15] there and i gotta go
[39:16] hold up the whole cart it's almost
[39:18] overflowing with food you know
[39:20] thank god for uh thank god for the
[39:21] prosperity that we live with
[39:24] but every year for seven years
[39:26] they would see
[39:27] everything they sort up be robbed
[39:30] you imagine the imagine as a man brother
[39:32] austin
[39:34] imagine as a man they'll tie you up or
[39:36] whatever they did or the the you just
[39:38] watch all of everything you labored for
[39:40] for your wife and kids you were just
[39:42] tied up and maybe kicked around throwing
[39:44] the ground while those soldiers
[39:45] plundered your house
[39:47] seven years in a row
[39:49] seven's completion right this was
[39:51] complete and utter destruction this is
[39:53] completely utter embarrassment
[39:57] and so the bible said they got tired of
[39:59] it
[40:01] and they were really poor verse 6 says
[40:02] they were greatly impoverished
[40:04] so they were living in a life of poverty
[40:08] now look at verse eight i'm sorry verse
[40:10] seven
[40:11] so here's church what happens if you and
[40:13] i ever find ourselves in a cycle of loss
[40:16] or cycle of disobedience verse seven
[40:18] tells us what we must do amen there's
[40:20] always one answer amen the one answer is
[40:22] prayer of repentance amen
[40:26] there's always one answer that's why the
[40:28] bible said
[40:29] the way of holiness is so easy a fool
[40:32] won't miss it
[40:33] because everybody knows about i mean
[40:35] even the world talks about karma now we
[40:36] don't we don't use the word karma but we
[40:38] realize the laws of god
[40:40] if you sow good seeds you'll get a
[40:42] harvest
[40:43] if you sow bad seed you're going to reap
[40:45] a bad harvest right
[40:48] now the world and universalism and
[40:50] everything they pervert that but if
[40:52] there is a law of god
[40:54] if you work hard god's going to bless
[40:56] you amen
[40:57] if you invest in the kingdom of god he
[40:59] said i'll add all these things unto you
[41:02] if you seek first god kingdom he'll give
[41:04] you everything you have need of amen
[41:08] but look what it comes to pass after
[41:10] seven years of seeing this
[41:12] every year and poor dirt poor
[41:16] the bible said they finally they will
[41:18] every year they would cry unto the lord
[41:21] and now look at verse 8 i love this and
[41:23] when you cry on the lord what happens
[41:24] the word of the prophet comes to you
[41:27] hallelujah
[41:30] you cry out long enough god's going to
[41:31] send you the prophet
[41:32] hallelujah you really want truth god
[41:35] said i'm prophet now that that's brother
[41:36] simon's testimony austin have you seen
[41:38] it online i put simon's testimony on
[41:39] there
[41:40] simon and brother amen both had this
[41:42] testimony now simon he was fasted i
[41:44] think it was
[41:45] three months he would go in the prayer
[41:47] closet fast and say god sent me the
[41:48] truth he was in denomination assembly of
[41:50] god
[41:52] saying god i know there's more i know
[41:53] there's more so he fasted off and on for
[41:55] three months and that's when the message
[41:57] came to him god sent him the prophet
[41:59] the word of the prophet
[42:01] amen to the same thing he was telling me
[42:02] on his testimony there was we were
[42:03] recording that podcast that he was just
[42:05] wondering lord there's got to be more
[42:07] how come the people are you know crying
[42:09] out for god
[42:10] how come the people are obeying the word
[42:12] of god and what does god do god sends
[42:14] him to the
[42:15] the church that has the prophet amen
[42:17] see when you really cry to god god's
[42:19] going to send you a vindicated messenger
[42:21] amen
[42:23] and that's what he did in verse 8 and
[42:25] the lord sent a prophet and the children
[42:26] of israel which said unto the unto them
[42:28] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[42:29] brought you
[42:30] up from egypt and brought you forth out
[42:32] of the house of bondage
[42:35] now that was many many years ago let me
[42:37] go back
[42:38] to exodus 12.
[42:41] just to kind of get you a timeline here
[42:43] so god takes them back this is 14.
[42:47] almost uh
[42:48] almost 200 years
[42:50] god's saying you guys weren't always in
[42:52] bondage 200 years ago you were free
[42:57] see aren't you glad god remind us of our
[42:59] past mistakes
[43:00] but also our past victories amen
[43:03] he said i brought you out 200 years ago
[43:05] you were a free people amen
[43:07] you had houses stacked with food you had
[43:10] everything you need 200 years ago when
[43:12] you kept the word of god
[43:17] yeah look at verse 9 and i delivered you
[43:19] out of the hand of the egyptians and out
[43:21] of the hand of all that oppressed you
[43:22] and drave you out or drave them out from
[43:23] before you and gave you their land now
[43:26] here it is right here why was this
[43:27] happening for seven years in a row verse
[43:29] 10 and i said unto you i am the lord
[43:31] your god fear not the gods of the
[43:33] amorites in whose land you dwell
[43:36] but you have not obeyed my voice
[43:40] so obedience
[43:41] disobedience
[43:43] caused this cycle of loss and defeat and
[43:46] poverty can i say it like this many
[43:48] people today might have a lot of riches
[43:49] but they're spiritually poor
[43:52] they don't know how to repent they don't
[43:54] know how to pray they don't know how to
[43:56] hear read the word of god
[43:58] right spiritually poor the bible says
[44:00] they're rich they're rich and increased
[44:02] with goods and happy to nothing they're
[44:03] poor blind miserable naked and don't
[44:05] even know it praise god
[44:08] so see we see the same thing today
[44:12] and what caused all this a disobedience
[44:14] see that's why the bible says church we
[44:16] we
[44:17] we went over it no manner without excuse
[44:20] that you have a conscience built into
[44:23] you where you know if you're doing right
[44:24] or wrong you know thank god we can know
[44:26] for do right amen
[44:28] hallelujah
[44:31] but they knew and they were disobeying
[44:34] now you're going to see later in
[44:35] gideon's dad why this is important
[44:38] god said you have not obeyed
[44:42] and so for seven years they just get
[44:43] poor
[44:44] and poor and poor and poor
[44:47] because they have not obeyed the voice
[44:49] of god so what was god what was god's
[44:51] answer to god help me god what was god's
[44:53] answer i'm sending you a prophet obey
[44:56] the word of god amen look at your past
[44:59] fathers look at your mothers amen look
[45:00] at your grandmothers look at your great
[45:02] great grandfathers look how they obey
[45:04] god look how i bless them and if you do
[45:06] the same thing i'll bless you
[45:09] amen
[45:10] that's all we gotta do church if we got
[45:12] problems in our lives look back to the
[45:14] word look back to the history look back
[45:15] to the bible did i miss something am i
[45:17] off the word
[45:19] have i sinned have i disobeyed the lord
[45:21] somewhere and if not then you know it's
[45:23] just a test of your faith and god wants
[45:26] to prove to the devil that you'll serve
[45:27] god no matter what trial comes your way
[45:29] amen
[45:31] that you have rock solid faith
[45:34] hallelujah
[45:36] now verse 12
[45:38] the angel
[45:40] no i'm sorry before i move on um
[45:43] remember verse 10 the prophet said fear
[45:45] not their gods of these nations
[45:51] so see they they they were given over to
[45:53] false gods
[45:55] they were trusting in gods they say like
[45:57] this they were trusting the stock market
[45:59] can you understand what i'm saying
[46:01] they were trusting in their maybe
[46:02] mother-in-law their father-in-law
[46:04] they're trusting their jobs
[46:06] they're trusting the economy
[46:08] right
[46:09] they're trusting their husbands or their
[46:10] wives or something or their grandpa
[46:13] they're trusting in things other than
[46:14] god and disobeying the word of god they
[46:17] had idols in their life but god sends
[46:19] you a prophet to escape the idols of
[46:21] your life amen
[46:22] hallelujah
[46:25] we just sing that song that's why that
[46:26] song kind of came to my heart i was
[46:27] thinking about the idolatry
[46:30] we bow our hearts we bend our knees no
[46:31] lord we cast out our idols
[46:34] so anything that we'd exalt
[46:37] anything that we would pay too much
[46:38] attention to
[46:41] we want to cast it down thank you lydia
[46:43] i appreciate that
[46:47] so see that it ties in with the story
[46:49] very well
[46:51] don't fear the gods of the amorites in
[46:52] other words don't don't get caught up in
[46:54] the superstition don't get caught up
[46:55] into serving other gods you obey the
[46:57] word of god
[46:59] now verse 11.
[47:01] verse 12 the angel lord appears unto
[47:03] them and says the lord is with thee thou
[47:05] mighty man of valor
[47:08] so this man has done nothing
[47:10] in seven years he's done nothing
[47:13] and god says you are a man of valor amen
[47:18] you can tell by their conversation
[47:20] though this man was meditating on the
[47:22] word of god
[47:24] because he has a very scriptural
[47:25] question
[47:27] right look at verse 13. what's the first
[47:29] words we get from gideon out of his lips
[47:31] oh my lord so there's lords he calls him
[47:34] lord
[47:36] if the lord be with us then why is all
[47:39] this befallen us and where be all his
[47:41] miracles which our fathers told of us
[47:43] saying did not the lord bring us up from
[47:45] egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us
[47:48] and deliver us into the hands of the
[47:49] many knights
[47:51] now church
[47:53] perhaps gideon maybe didn't hear all
[47:54] that the prophet said or maybe he'd
[47:55] forgotten but the prophet said you did
[47:57] not obey the word of god that's why this
[47:59] is befalling you
[48:01] but he had a good question if god's with
[48:03] me if i'm a mighty man where are all the
[48:05] miracles
[48:07] and god was in other words god was
[48:08] saying where's all your obedience if you
[48:10] want to see a miracle obey the word of
[48:11] god amen
[48:13] hallelujah and as brother braham said
[48:14] the greatest miracle is for you to
[48:16] become a christian and then you become a
[48:18] miracle
[48:20] right
[48:24] because miracles do not save
[48:26] as far as some if someone raised from
[48:28] the dead that won't save somebody that
[48:30] won't save their soul what saves the
[48:32] soul is a repentance from sin and
[48:34] acceptance of faith in jesus christ then
[48:37] you pass from death unto life
[48:39] and that's the greatest miracle
[48:41] seeing a soul saved hallelujah
[48:44] glory amen thank god
[48:46] amen it is
[48:52] now verse 14 and the lord looked upon
[48:54] him and said go in this thy might
[48:57] and thou shalt save israel from the hand
[48:59] of the midianites have not i sent thee
[49:01] so the angel says go in your might he
[49:03] says haven't i sent you
[49:06] look they've had they've had one they've
[49:08] they've exchanged one word one sentence
[49:10] they've exchanged one little
[49:11] conversation and he's already said i've
[49:13] sent you
[49:15] see
[49:17] god
[49:18] god when god speaks god expects you to
[49:20] listen but at the same time church god
[49:22] knows we're human and that's why i love
[49:24] the story of gideon god will work with
[49:26] you if you need more signs god will work
[49:28] with you praise god if you want to
[49:29] overcome fear if you want to overcome
[49:31] doubt if you want to overcome any
[49:33] obstacle if you want to get out of any
[49:35] trouble that you're in god will work
[49:36] with you if you really want it and god
[49:38] will make you a valiant man or woman
[49:40] praise god
[49:42] amen if you want to get out god will
[49:45] make a way for you to get out
[49:47] because god is going to use this lease
[49:48] in his family god is going to use the
[49:50] least esteemed the one that doesn't look
[49:52] likely the one that would you not pick
[49:54] out as there's a deliverer or there's a
[49:56] judge or there's a there's a real saint
[49:58] of god
[49:59] that's not the one god chose god chose
[50:00] the least of them praise god
[50:03] but god looked down and said there's
[50:04] potential there amen just like david
[50:06] like jesse's dead or i'm sorry david's
[50:08] dead jesse jesse didn't forgot about
[50:10] david when samuel come
[50:12] he didn't even think to invite him there
[50:13] praise god
[50:15] david wasn't even in his mind he's just
[50:17] a small he's a handsome guy ruddy guy
[50:19] but but david jesse didn't even think
[50:22] well maybe it'll be my youngest son
[50:24] and again god uses the least esteem
[50:26] there it is again praise god god uses
[50:28] the least esteem church that's that's
[50:30] why i
[50:31] encourage all of us just stay humble
[50:33] praise god
[50:34] look for god to move in your life in
[50:36] little ways and be faithful in little
[50:38] things if you want to see a great
[50:39] miracle be faithful in the little things
[50:41] amen
[50:43] hallelujah
[50:46] god always chooses that the bible said
[50:47] he brings down the high mighty and he
[50:49] exalts the humble
[50:51] that's that's god's way
[50:55] now look at verse 15 here's where i was
[50:57] trying to show
[50:58] and he said unto him o my lord wherewith
[51:00] shall i save israel behold my family is
[51:03] poor in manasseh and i am the least in
[51:06] my father's house
[51:10] the least
[51:11] i'm not the greatest at the church can i
[51:13] just say like that
[51:15] i'm not the most
[51:17] talked about person in the church
[51:19] i'm not the one that's got the most
[51:21] testimonies and the church said
[51:24] but yet god came to him because god saw
[51:26] he had potential
[51:30] and he asked that great question i want
[51:32] to know where's all the miracles
[51:34] whenever there's a god there's a
[51:35] supernatural movement around
[51:37] amen
[51:39] hallelujah god constantly moving
[51:40] supernaturally man placing events of our
[51:43] lives together
[51:44] doing things that only he can get credit
[51:46] for praise god
[51:50] and what does the lord answer verse 16
[51:52] and the lord said unto him surely i'll
[51:53] be with thee and thou shalt smite the
[51:55] midianites
[51:57] as one man amen what an answer he said
[52:00] how am i going to save israel church
[52:02] that's the only answer you and i need
[52:04] how am i going to do anything if god is
[52:06] with you
[52:08] amen how am i going to overcome this
[52:10] this financial crisis how am i going to
[52:12] overcome uh this persecution from my
[52:14] family how am i going to overcome this
[52:16] temptation if god is with you then who
[52:19] can be against you amen
[52:21] that's a simple answer god says i'm
[52:23] going to be with you
[52:26] does it take
[52:27] does it take a smart educated scientist
[52:29] to believe that
[52:30] no it just takes a humble person
[52:33] okay if god said it i believe it
[52:37] and so that's what we see in gideon's
[52:38] life
[52:39] he's fearful but all of them are fearful
[52:41] at first right the whole church was
[52:43] fearful at first because they've
[52:44] suffered through seven years of
[52:45] disobedience they'd feared other gods
[52:48] other than yahweh
[52:51] and gideon was one of the you must have
[52:52] been the first one who must have been
[52:53] one of the rare ones that actually heard
[52:55] the prophet's message believed it
[52:57] thought about well god where's all the
[52:58] miracles lord we want to see miracles he
[53:00] must have been one of those crying out
[53:01] in prayer amen
[53:03] hallelujah
[53:06] now this is the first sign he asked for
[53:09] now that that's the beautiful part of
[53:10] gideon's life
[53:12] he knows all these great promises are
[53:14] spoken to him he's valiant he's going to
[53:17] save the nation from these many nights
[53:19] that came every seven years but how is
[53:21] he going to do it
[53:22] in other words he's heard he said amen
[53:25] faith has come by hearing and hearing by
[53:27] the word of god praise god but can i say
[53:30] it like this getting one to go from
[53:31] faith unto more faith amen
[53:34] you want to go from glory unto glory
[53:36] hallelujah
[53:38] and for each step of the battle church
[53:40] each step of the trial he needs god to
[53:42] show him more supernatural
[53:45] hallelujah
[53:49] and i think if you look at it really
[53:50] every person's life in the bible that's
[53:52] what it was because remember
[53:53] even abraham the father of faith at one
[53:56] point he was laughing at god
[53:59] and genesis 17.
[54:02] he said i'm going to give you a son
[54:03] through sarah and he laughed
[54:06] god's got a sense of humor on him
[54:08] doesn't
[54:08] he and then sarah laughed sarah left
[54:12] when
[54:13] when the angel lord said it's coming
[54:14] through you
[54:16] they laughed
[54:18] so see we never want to make gideon
[54:21] seem like not a strong believer
[54:23] because we can all put ourselves right
[54:25] in those shoes
[54:27] when was the last time you defeated a
[54:29] country of of warriors and soldiers none
[54:31] of us have none of us
[54:33] so that's why we should respect gideon
[54:34] amen that's why he was putting in the
[54:36] hall of fame of faith amen
[54:38] so he can look at him and learn from him
[54:40] if god speaks any word to you he's going
[54:42] to bring it to pass but he's also got to
[54:44] teach you to trust him teach you to
[54:46] believe teach you to seek his face and
[54:48] then as you do that god will raise your
[54:50] strength and so he can use you to
[54:52] accomplish the great thing of your life
[54:55] i preached this a few months ago maybe
[54:56] six months ago a few for a month might
[54:58] be 12 months for me i don't know
[55:00] but i said you know some of us have just
[55:04] some of us have one great thing god's
[55:06] trying to get out of our life one great
[55:07] thing for example i use the the
[55:09] shulamite i'm sorry no uh the queen of
[55:11] sheba
[55:13] jesus said i'm going to raise up the
[55:14] queen of sheba she's going to be a
[55:15] witness this woman is going to witness
[55:17] and condemn all the pharisees and
[55:19] sadducees that lived a thousand years
[55:21] after her
[55:22] because she crossed the desert to hear
[55:24] solomon
[55:27] and that's all jesus says that one part
[55:29] of her life amen the whole the whole her
[55:31] whole life was building up to that
[55:33] moment amen
[55:35] and god was dealing with her and she
[55:36] heard there's a there's a prophet
[55:38] there's a prophet her whole life was
[55:40] building up with us and god had to keep
[55:42] raising her faith you've got to cross
[55:44] the desert and you all across the nation
[55:45] so i know god's going to bless you too
[55:48] god may use you honestly god may use you
[55:49] on the day of judgment
[55:51] for those people that wouldn't cross the
[55:52] street to come to our church
[55:55] or across the state
[55:57] or across the city brother you know what
[55:58] i'm talking about
[56:00] people running across the city to come
[56:02] to church
[56:03] right
[56:04] and that if they don't repent of that
[56:06] they'll be condemned
[56:08] because god's going to raise up people
[56:10] that made greater sacrifice to hear a
[56:12] lesser gift right
[56:14] god will raise those people up and use
[56:16] that against them
[56:18] i'm saying that as a warning it also has
[56:20] encouragement too
[56:22] now church gideon's life only has three
[56:24] chapters on it six seven and eight has
[56:27] anybody read those lately
[56:29] if not it's okay so
[56:31] six is all about this meeting with the
[56:32] angel
[56:34] seven is the victory over the midnights
[56:35] and in eight
[56:36] you see a little more a battle with with
[56:38] israel but then the end of his life ends
[56:41] in disgrace
[56:43] he marries like 40 women is it like has
[56:45] all that i mean
[56:46] and then and then uh uh he builds like a
[56:48] ephod i think it like that
[56:50] and the israel goes right back into
[56:52] idolatry at the end of his life
[56:55] so
[56:56] but look at it it's just like the the
[56:57] queen of the south you know
[56:59] she had one moment of her life where
[57:00] your whole life is building up to this
[57:02] this is this is a certain kind of
[57:04] testimony this certain kind of uh uh
[57:07] victory i want you to overcome with
[57:10] and that's what the whole those were the
[57:11] one major event in their life the the
[57:13] purpose of their life remember what was
[57:14] samson's purpose samson's purpose of his
[57:17] whole life
[57:19] was to begin the destruction of the
[57:21] philistines
[57:22] and he ran from it from all those years
[57:24] yeah he had a little victory here and
[57:25] there i mean big victory thousand i'm
[57:28] just saying like he wasn't doing what he
[57:29] all should have done the whole time and
[57:31] it comes down to the very end of his
[57:32] life so his his victory came at the very
[57:35] end of his life what a climax that was
[57:38] he had a good start and then fell real
[57:40] real low with delilah and then he ends
[57:42] on this major climax
[57:44] where in his in his death he did he
[57:46] kills more philistines than he did in
[57:48] his entire lifetime in one moment
[57:50] and that's what he used to remember for
[57:52] that's why he's in the hall of fame of
[57:53] faith because he cried out once more
[57:55] lord oh church don't you know your
[57:57] prayers are precious in the sight of god
[57:59] when you say lord just send another
[58:00] miracle lord just send another revival
[58:02] amen lord just send another soul that
[58:04] needs to be saved amen
[58:07] once more lord amen
[58:09] bring back back that fire that i once
[58:10] had amen bring back that zeal i once had
[58:13] bring back that obedience i once had
[58:15] once more lord god is in these kind of
[58:17] prayers where you cry as the lord for
[58:19] victory
[58:21] tired of defeat
[58:22] tired of the same old thing but the
[58:24] saints the people of god had to be
[58:26] desperate for it for seven years they
[58:28] cried for it
[58:29] then god sent it
[58:34] hallelujah sometimes it takes that
[58:37] sometimes it takes years of prayer years
[58:39] of
[58:39] like we just seen with austin coming
[58:41] back five years of prayer
[58:43] it might take some years
[58:45] like i was telling haven haven comes up
[58:46] for the certain person to be saved all
[58:47] the time i just keep telling just keep
[58:49] coming
[58:50] just keep coming year after year we've
[58:52] seen it on two occasions right people
[58:53] come back to the lord
[58:55] just be faithful i love that about her i
[58:57] love that that faith i'm gonna keep
[58:59] believing praise god i'm gonna keep
[59:00] asking amen i'm not gonna give up
[59:02] hallelujah
[59:04] god honors faith like that
[59:10] now here in verse 17 he asked for his
[59:12] first sign
[59:18] now i'm going to just uh go through this
[59:20] quickly here
[59:22] he asks for the angel to stay here he's
[59:24] going to go make a meal he's going to
[59:26] bring it back to the angel
[59:29] okay and then he brings the meal back
[59:30] the angel puts a staff on it in verse 21
[59:34] and fire rises up out of the rock it
[59:36] consumes the whole sacrifice and the
[59:38] angel lord vanishes out of his sight and
[59:41] in verse 22 gideon perceives that it was
[59:43] an angel of the lord
[59:45] and then he says oh my lord because i've
[59:48] seen the angel of the lord face to face
[59:53] so he's he's going through seven years
[59:55] of loss seven years of poverty
[59:58] and the angel says i'm with you he said
[1:00:00] well just your if you're if you're
[1:00:02] really with me let me do this and notice
[1:00:05] it wasn't an unholy thing it was a
[1:00:06] sacrifice
[1:00:09] see church when we asked god to do
[1:00:11] something let's make it a sacrifice
[1:00:13] if you in other words if you want proof
[1:00:15] that god wants you to do this sacrifice
[1:00:17] something like give up some money or
[1:00:19] give up give up some uh give up some
[1:00:21] meals
[1:00:22] give up something
[1:00:24] this was a holy sacrifice amen
[1:00:28] if we want to see god we got to
[1:00:29] sacrifice if we want to show god that we
[1:00:32] really mean business we got to sacrifice
[1:00:33] something
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:37] it's not like the denomination is well
[1:00:39] well for i'm going to give up chocolate
[1:00:40] until easter time then i can eat all the
[1:00:41] chocolate i want after easter
[1:00:43] that's not a real sacrifice
[1:00:45] because chocolate's not necessary for
[1:00:47] for for life you know
[1:00:50] or given i'll give up facebook until
[1:00:51] easter is over praise god i'll give up
[1:00:52] facebook
[1:00:54] that's
[1:00:54] ridiculous it's ridiculous you're just
[1:00:57] going to go right back to it
[1:00:59] but what he sacrificed here he couldn't
[1:01:01] get back amen amen
[1:01:03] that's why when you sacrifice your time
[1:01:05] or your money your energy all these
[1:01:07] things and it's a real sacrifice god
[1:01:09] will honor that real sacrifice so
[1:01:10] gideon's a man of fear first of course
[1:01:12] god sees faith in there and he says show
[1:01:15] me this one sign and god answers him and
[1:01:17] god shows him the sign
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:25] now look at verse 23 and the lord said
[1:01:27] unto him peace be unto thee fear not
[1:01:29] thou shalt not die so now we know what's
[1:01:30] going through his mind
[1:01:32] well god just answered my prayer i met
[1:01:34] an angel
[1:01:35] but i'm going to die the many nights
[1:01:37] i've seen their armies circle for seven
[1:01:38] years
[1:01:40] we're just we're surrounded there's no
[1:01:42] way i'm going to die
[1:01:44] so the lord tells them you're not going
[1:01:46] to die
[1:01:48] in other words i'm here to protect your
[1:01:50] life can you imagine that
[1:01:51] one church one angel can protect you
[1:01:53] from thousands and thousands upon
[1:01:55] thousands of men with weapons amen
[1:01:58] i don't know if god is for us who can be
[1:02:00] against us amen that mighty angel army
[1:02:02] amen one angel amen
[1:02:06] could be sent from heaven to protect you
[1:02:08] and i
[1:02:10] in the midst of total
[1:02:12] total chaos total obstacles
[1:02:15] impossibilities
[1:02:16] god can send one angel
[1:02:18] to protect our lives amen
[1:02:21] if we're willing to obey the word of god
[1:02:25] he's willing to do it
[1:02:28] now church i'm going to call this
[1:02:31] i'm going to call this his justification
[1:02:33] moment
[1:02:35] because there's a type in here i
[1:02:36] preached this like i said eight years
[1:02:38] ago been a while since i preached this
[1:02:39] one
[1:02:41] but we i can see the three so this is
[1:02:43] where he's justified this is where
[1:02:46] he starts living a new life
[1:02:48] this is where he starts his battle
[1:02:50] against fear right here and the church
[1:02:52] said
[1:02:53] when did you really start battling sin
[1:02:54] once you got saved
[1:02:56] before that you were just a slave to it
[1:02:58] so here he says well i'm starting a new
[1:03:00] life now i know god's with me
[1:03:03] right you get saved now you know god's
[1:03:04] with me now you love god now you're
[1:03:06] serving god now you're repentant you're
[1:03:08] baptized in water praise god
[1:03:10] and now you're ready to serve god
[1:03:15] now
[1:03:18] he built an altar there to honor that he
[1:03:20] was visited by an angel lord now look
[1:03:22] here's the next thing now here's what i
[1:03:24] believe church is sanctification
[1:03:26] verse 25.
[1:03:28] now it came to pass not a different
[1:03:30] night the same night and look what god
[1:03:32] tried to he tries to get him a quick he
[1:03:34] tries to keep him moving in the spirit
[1:03:36] of god
[1:03:38] in other words he doesn't wait for a
[1:03:39] couple of nights to kind of
[1:03:41] he kind of
[1:03:42] in other words he strikes it while the
[1:03:43] iron's hot amen
[1:03:46] in other words god is going to do a
[1:03:47] quick short work here
[1:03:49] hallelujah just like the rapture we
[1:03:51] believe the rapture should be a quick
[1:03:52] short work we don't know if we 30 days
[1:03:54] 40 days we don't know 50 days no one
[1:03:56] knows
[1:03:57] that the the squeeze and the pouring out
[1:03:59] the latter rain before the rapture
[1:04:02] brother brahma calls it like a short
[1:04:04] quick work
[1:04:05] in other words it's the final anointing
[1:04:07] of the holy ghost that we need to take
[1:04:09] us in the rapture
[1:04:10] it's called the lattering
[1:04:12] yeah
[1:04:15] you'll get it then if you're if you're
[1:04:17] predestined you'll get it then
[1:04:19] what if you're not
[1:04:22] if you're not
[1:04:24] no you'll be you'll reproduce
[1:04:25] predestinated for sure
[1:04:29] yeah absolutely yeah
[1:04:36] we don't know but that that makes total
[1:04:38] sense yeah it makes total sense that you
[1:04:40] would get it then
[1:04:42] yeah because jesus said jerusalem will
[1:04:43] be trotted down until the times of the
[1:04:45] gentiles are fulfilled in other words
[1:04:47] god knows when that last soul gets saved
[1:04:50] or that last soul gets the holy ghost
[1:04:52] when that last one and then the la
[1:04:54] whenever the ladder rain falls we don't
[1:04:55] know when it falls in there but whenever
[1:04:56] that last one is there god has them
[1:04:58] saved sealed sanctified filled with the
[1:05:00] holy ghost whatever and then whatever
[1:05:02] time whatever needs to be done to finish
[1:05:04] all the prophecy then god raptures the
[1:05:06] church and then he goes back to the jews
[1:05:09] okay so there's there's a lot of mystery
[1:05:11] in there too there's a lot of brother
[1:05:12] man just puts a lot of ideas in there
[1:05:14] very little has thus saith the lord but
[1:05:16] what we do have thou saith the lord is
[1:05:17] the latter rain it's going to fall
[1:05:19] it's going to
[1:05:20] fall no it's spiritual rain yes
[1:05:23] it's kind of it's a metaphor yeah like
[1:05:24] the day of pentecost in other words god
[1:05:26] is going to end the church the way it
[1:05:28] started it started with the pentecost
[1:05:29] holy ghost fire like that it's going to
[1:05:31] end like that too
[1:05:34] probably probably but yeah probably but
[1:05:36] probably
[1:05:37] yeah yeah
[1:05:38] yeah the holy ghost truly fell on azusa
[1:05:40] street in 1906 in a powerful way
[1:05:44] yeah yeah just just that's humility
[1:05:46] brother just humility
[1:05:48] yeah humble that's a sacrifice that's a
[1:05:50] sacrifice
[1:05:52] see each person has to make a sacrifice
[1:05:53] and god honors the sacrifice
[1:05:58] yeah
[1:05:59] now look at the various so why he's hot
[1:06:02] why he's on fire he's he's met the angel
[1:06:04] of the lord
[1:06:06] he says that same night god came back
[1:06:07] again
[1:06:10] in verse 25
[1:06:11] the lord said to him
[1:06:13] get in take thy father's young bullock
[1:06:16] even the second bullock of seven years
[1:06:18] old and throw down the altar of baal
[1:06:21] that they that thy father hath and cut
[1:06:23] down the grove that is by it
[1:06:26] oh so now we see why the seven year
[1:06:28] things happened
[1:06:30] gideon's dad was an idolater and
[1:06:32] probably gideon maybe for a little bit
[1:06:34] like abraham remember abraham was the
[1:06:36] idolater
[1:06:37] but until god called him out of the land
[1:06:39] of china the bible said he worshipped
[1:06:40] the gods
[1:06:42] so i don't know how much giddy was in
[1:06:43] there but his dad had built an altar and
[1:06:45] i think they get poor and poor you would
[1:06:47] think well how come your god don't hear
[1:06:48] you for seven years you think they would
[1:06:49] catch on
[1:06:50] but they didn't
[1:06:53] his dad had built an altar to these fa
[1:06:55] the baal false god
[1:06:58] and there was a lot of awful things
[1:06:59] connected like you know child sacrifice
[1:07:01] adultery fornication all kinds of wicked
[1:07:03] things with the
[1:07:05] the false god of baal well yeah it could
[1:07:06] have been good
[1:07:09] um
[1:07:12] in other words he said go throw down
[1:07:14] your dad's
[1:07:16] idols
[1:07:17] you tear him down now why didn't he ask
[1:07:19] his dad to do that
[1:07:23] right yeah he probably wouldn't have he
[1:07:25] wasn't the one called
[1:07:28] god was going to use giddy you know what
[1:07:29] gideon means it means hewer or
[1:07:31] woodchopper
[1:07:33] he's a cutter gideon was a cutter and
[1:07:35] what the bible say you got the word of
[1:07:37] god in your hand
[1:07:38] so you can cut out you could
[1:07:41] cut out uh whatever you need up praise
[1:07:42] god you can cut down anything any
[1:07:44] obstacle in your way
[1:07:46] that and that's what he does here his
[1:07:47] name's gideon and that's what god calls
[1:07:49] him to do right here in this these next
[1:07:51] verses
[1:07:52] go into the grove and cut down this i
[1:07:55] idol that your dad has set up
[1:07:57] now for us it would be go clean up the
[1:08:00] past
[1:08:01] go clean go clean up all the problems in
[1:08:03] your family from the past that have not
[1:08:05] been cleaned up
[1:08:07] all the situations have not been talked
[1:08:09] about and repented of go clean out that
[1:08:11] before i can use you in a greater way
[1:08:13] you've got to take care of your home
[1:08:14] life amen
[1:08:17] i can't use you
[1:08:19] until you get your home right
[1:08:22] then i can use you
[1:08:25] that's why the home is the most
[1:08:26] important part the home is more
[1:08:27] important than this right here this is
[1:08:28] very important but home is more
[1:08:30] important
[1:08:32] praise god
[1:08:33] because you and i are supposed to bring
[1:08:35] an anointing to church and the church
[1:08:36] said you're supposed to bring your
[1:08:39] prayer life you're supposed to bring the
[1:08:40] word you're supposed to bring faith here
[1:08:42] now of course it raises when we get here
[1:08:43] right because we see one another but
[1:08:45] we're supposed to live so godly at home
[1:08:47] that we bring the anointing we bring the
[1:08:48] faith of god we bring the victory of god
[1:08:50] to church amen hallelujah
[1:08:54] i mean i've seen that over and over a
[1:08:56] time in my ministry in other words i'll
[1:08:57] study at home i'll pray at home and then
[1:08:59] i'll come out here and i'll preach some
[1:09:00] a message somebody say that's just what
[1:09:02] i needed
[1:09:03] well what was that i was praying i was
[1:09:05] seeking god in my home
[1:09:06] and i just god just led me to the
[1:09:08] scriptures and the quotes and put it all
[1:09:10] together delivered to you and god shows
[1:09:12] god loves you amen
[1:09:14] but see every person should be studying
[1:09:16] their home listening the bible
[1:09:18] worshipping their home reading the bible
[1:09:20] everybody should have a sanctuary in
[1:09:22] their home praise god
[1:09:24] but god tells get in before you go
[1:09:26] anywhere boy before you defeat the
[1:09:27] midnights you got to get your house
[1:09:28] cleaned up
[1:09:31] now we're going to see that his dad
[1:09:32] actually
[1:09:33] agree with this
[1:09:35] but in other words his dad must have not
[1:09:36] had the courage to do it so god had to
[1:09:38] raise up getting to do it
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:42] now verse 26 and build an altar into the
[1:09:45] lord thy god upon the top of this rock
[1:09:46] in the order place and take the second
[1:09:48] bullet and offer a bur sacrifice with
[1:09:50] the wood of the grove which is which
[1:09:52] thou shalt cut down
[1:09:54] okay so you see what he says you got to
[1:09:56] go clean up your father's past mistakes
[1:10:00] you got to cut down that grove chop down
[1:10:02] all those trees and that was his name
[1:10:03] gideon
[1:10:04] hallelujah i imagine he was out there
[1:10:06] brother austin said he
[1:10:08] went at night time he was chopping that
[1:10:10] down man you say look at this brothers
[1:10:12] i'm fulfilling my name i'm finally doing
[1:10:14] what god called me to do i'm manifesting
[1:10:16] what god made me to be praise god amen
[1:10:19] that's what you and i can say when we
[1:10:20] come to church when we worship god when
[1:10:22] we raise the godly family we can say
[1:10:24] we're doing what god has called us to do
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:27] i was born to do this amen
[1:10:29] hallelujah
[1:10:30] gideon could be out there i was born to
[1:10:32] do this praise god i'm finally stepping
[1:10:34] in to the the destiny for my life amen
[1:10:38] i've been called gideon for all these
[1:10:39] years here i have been healing nothing
[1:10:41] i've been hiding but now i'm standing on
[1:10:44] the lord's side amen now i'm chopping
[1:10:46] down the lord's enemies hallelujah
[1:10:49] that's what i was called to do
[1:10:52] amen
[1:10:53] he finally started walking in the will
[1:10:56] of god for his life
[1:10:59] now look what he did god said go cast it
[1:11:01] down and go build restore an altar of
[1:11:03] worship in other words take it back to
[1:11:05] the beginning take it back to your first
[1:11:07] love
[1:11:09] get rid of that idol in your life and go
[1:11:12] make an altar to god in your home and
[1:11:14] worship god in your home
[1:11:17] that's why the that's why the enemies
[1:11:19] were there
[1:11:21] and what they do the bible said in verse
[1:11:22] 27
[1:11:24] then gideon took man ten men of his
[1:11:26] servants and did as the lord had said to
[1:11:27] him and so it was because he feared his
[1:11:29] father's household that the men of the
[1:11:30] city that he could not do it by day that
[1:11:32] he did it by night now check that out
[1:11:35] he was afraid to do it during the
[1:11:37] daytime why because he thought he's
[1:11:38] gonna get killed but didn't the angel
[1:11:40] just say
[1:11:41] i'm going to be with you you're not
[1:11:43] going to die
[1:11:44] see church how we can believe part of
[1:11:45] the word but not all of it sometimes
[1:11:47] his faith
[1:11:48] that's right did god get rid of him no
[1:11:51] god worked with his fear oh hallelujah
[1:11:54] and the church said
[1:11:56] i'll say it like this god's going to get
[1:11:57] glory through our problems
[1:12:00] god's going to get glory through our
[1:12:01] weaknesses just obey as much as you can
[1:12:04] just believe the best you can amen
[1:12:07] hallelujah the angel said i'm going to
[1:12:09] don't fear
[1:12:10] you're not going to die now go cut it
[1:12:12] down well he's scared he's going to die
[1:12:15] so he was trying he had a little a
[1:12:16] little trouble with that part of the
[1:12:17] word but the rest of it he did
[1:12:20] he went right down there he said hey you
[1:12:21] nine other ten you ten other brothers
[1:12:23] you come with me let's just chop this
[1:12:25] down he said look i'm getting here i am
[1:12:27] i'm stepping into god's plan for my life

[1:12:58] time
