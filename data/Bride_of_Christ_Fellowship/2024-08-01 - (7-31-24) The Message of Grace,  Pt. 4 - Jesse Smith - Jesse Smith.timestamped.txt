[2:32] Grace as the Bible says in Jesus
[2:34] Christ's name the Saints said amen God
[2:37] bless you as you're being seated praise
[2:39] God we like to look at part four here
[2:42] tonight of the message of Grace got
[2:45] about 10 topics I like to preach on it's
[2:47] so hard to decide what to preach you
[2:48] know so I just wait on the Lord and look
[2:50] for
[2:51] inspiration um so I want to look at
[2:53] message of Grace part four I'm probably
[2:55] gon to need maybe one more part to
[2:57] finish up this uh uh series here then
[3:00] we'll get to the next one uh the coming
[3:02] of the lord The Rapture mystery and like
[3:04] I told you I've been studying on that
[3:06] I've been studying what brother Ram said
[3:07] about CI scoffield did you know CI
[3:09] scoffield was a part of Dwight Moody's
[3:11] Ministry I didn't know that he kind of
[3:13] he followed Dwight towards the end of
[3:15] his ministry and he followed the Dwight
[3:17] Moody Ministry he was another uh highly
[3:21] uh used man of God kind of contemporary
[3:24] to Charles finny Charles finny of course
[3:26] here in Ohio Oberlin Dwight Moody was
[3:28] there in Chicago
[3:30] and c i c I scoffield had a really bad
[3:32] past you know divorce and all these
[3:34] things but uh after he got converted you
[3:36] know God really used him in a tremendous
[3:38] way um but uh as I shared with you you I
[3:41] want to preach on maybe the Rapture next
[3:43] because that's the next one in the song
[3:45] um and it's a sudden secret coming
[3:48] Hallelujah and as I share with you I
[3:50] don't know if you went and saw that
[3:51] Tucker Carlson video or not but I
[3:52] watched or I listened to it at Double
[3:54] speed so I could get it real done done
[3:55] real fast because I basically know what
[3:57] they're going to say um and uh so
[4:01] they're against the pre-tribulation
[4:02] Rapture they think there's only one
[4:04] coming at Jesus but as I said last week
[4:06] there's at least three more there's the
[4:08] Rapture coming there's 144,000 coming
[4:11] and then there's the Armageddon coming
[4:13] there's at least three more comings of
[4:14] Jesus there could be
[4:16] more um so but but these people think oh
[4:19] there's only one and boy they would have
[4:21] to have quite a situation to tie all
[4:23] those scriptures in so I mean at so this
[4:26] is what they think at at the same event
[4:27] the dead in Christ is going to rise
[4:28] first and and then uh and then we'll be
[4:31] changed meet him in the air and then
[4:32] every eye will see him every eye will
[4:34] mourn uh and then you have uh then you
[4:37] have all the armies coming together
[4:39] against Jesus and then the 144,000 get
[4:41] the Holy Ghost all at the same coming
[4:42] that's a lot going on at one time and We
[4:45] Know by the Scripture it doesn't happen
[4:47] that way because you have three and a
[4:48] half years here three and a half years
[4:49] there you have all these things that
[4:51] have to happen uh but that's that's how
[4:54] sad it is now the reasoning behind that
[4:56] I'll just start with that the reasoning
[4:58] behind that is they uh they're afraid
[5:00] that people that believe in the
[5:01] pre-tribulation Rapture they're afraid
[5:03] the pre-trip people are going to take
[5:05] the mark of the beast because they're
[5:08] going to say well uh the Rapture hasn't
[5:10] happened yet so I still need to buy and
[5:11] sell so I'm going to take the mark of
[5:12] the beast now to me that's really that's
[5:14] really silly to me because anybody
[5:17] that's looking for the Rapture they know
[5:20] that the main component about missing
[5:22] the Rapture is not taking a mark so you
[5:24] can buy and
[5:25] sell right so to me it's it's just silly
[5:30] maybe a word I use is ridiculous it's
[5:32] just a ridiculous worry to have about
[5:34] why there shouldn't be a pre-tribulation
[5:36] Rapture and friends there like I said
[5:38] there's over six there's six types of it
[5:41] in the Bible I mean it's fully it's
[5:43] fully backed up by the scripture but
[5:45] that'll be my next sermon maybe Lord
[5:46] willing by God's grace but um I feel led
[5:49] to look into that by God's grace so last
[5:52] time we looked at uh we finished with
[5:53] Abraham I'm sorry last time we finished
[5:55] with Adam and Eve a couple Sundays ago
[5:57] take it back a few Sundays ago I think
[5:59] we're over in that room I'm not mistaken
[6:02] uh so tonight you know brother raham
[6:03] uses these characters in the message of
[6:04] Grace he starts with Adam and Eve Noah
[6:06] Abraham isra as a nation Moses David and
[6:09] the saved thief on the cross those are
[6:11] the characters he uses to express God's
[6:13] grace now he could have used any he
[6:15] could have used every character in The
[6:16] Bible right because every character
[6:18] needs Grace and the church said you need
[6:20] Grace I need Grace we all need Grace
[6:23] that's the only way we're going to make
[6:24] it by Grace brother R said repeatedly
[6:26] I'm just a sinner saved by grace
[6:28] Hallelujah
[6:30] uh there's people that came after
[6:31] brother Bram and said oh I I had this
[6:33] conversation with him in 1964 brother
[6:35] Bram Saidi no longer a sinner well sad
[6:37] thing is that's not on tape and I'm not
[6:39] going to put any weight on a man's word
[6:41] especially when he's off the word of God
[6:43] he's already off the word already
[6:44] preaching false Doctrine I'm surely not
[6:46] going to believe your so-called story
[6:47] about brother brandham if it's not on
[6:49] tape I'm GNA stay with God's word
[6:51] hallelujah brother BR said I'm a sinner
[6:53] saved by grace not fit to live remember
[6:55] he said that in seventh seal he said not
[6:57] fit to live and I'm not saying that to
[6:58] be humble he says that's facts so we're
[7:02] thankful for God's Amazing Grace so I
[7:04] want to start with Noah tonight because
[7:05] we already did Adam and Eve uh brother
[7:08] mam said the grace of God reached over
[7:09] in Noah's time remember our day is like
[7:12] Noah it's like Noah and lot right so
[7:16] today's a day just like Noah's day today
[7:18] is a day just like lot's day and you saw
[7:20] it right at the Paris Olympics like our
[7:22] brother pointed out there uh all this
[7:24] glorification of the homosexual agenda
[7:27] it's just like the days of Sodom right
[7:29] and it's only going to get
[7:31] worse he says Noah just an ordinary man
[7:35] he and his family but because Noah
[7:38] feared God how many fear God tonight you
[7:41] have a reverence for God in other words
[7:43] you know if you get off the word you're
[7:45] going to get spanked that's the fear of
[7:47] God right I'm not talking about you're
[7:49] afraid to go to hell although you know
[7:52] Paul said that he said I beat my body so
[7:54] I'm not a
[7:56] Castaway right so there there's we got
[7:58] to keep that in mind too that you know
[8:00] our flesh if we feed it it'll go farther
[8:02] than we want it to go
[8:06] right but he said Noah just ordinary man
[8:09] but because Noah feared God he believed
[8:12] God you can't fear God without believing
[8:16] Hallelujah so you have to believe then
[8:17] you'll fear God how can you fear
[8:19] something you don't believe in you've
[8:21] got to fear God Solomon said the fear of
[8:23] God is the beginning of wisdom now just
[8:25] to fear God you're beginning to have
[8:28] wisdom every everyone say beginning
[8:29] ready beginning once you fear God and
[8:32] you know God's in control and you know
[8:34] God's watching your every step and
[8:35] you're careful about how you live now
[8:37] you're just beginning to fear God
[8:39] hallelujah and maybe that's what
[8:40] Sunday's message was about the first
[8:42] love getting that back by God's grace
[8:45] Hallelujah he said and the fear of God
[8:47] Noah feared the Lord and he believed the
[8:50] Lord and that's what God honors is your
[8:52] faith in him we looked at that a few
[8:55] weeks ago remember how many want God to
[8:56] honor you but you've got to honor God
[8:59] first first I want God to honor me but
[9:00] I've got to honor God first Hallelujah
[9:03] and the best way to do that remember
[9:04] what the Bible say the best way to do
[9:05] that is Give in secret remember Jesus
[9:08] said if you let your left hand give
[9:09] without knowing what your right hand's
[9:11] doing right I might be cutting up a
[9:12] little bit but right and then God reward
[9:15] you openly fast and pray in secret and
[9:17] God will reward you openly the fastest
[9:19] or I'm sorry the easiest way to get
[9:21] honored by God is to do things in secret
[9:23] without telling people praise God that's
[9:26] the best way to start honoring God and
[9:28] you know God will honor you
[9:31] Hallelujah you know and I'm just going
[9:33] to share this just for your sake but you
[9:34] know when I first started that YouTube
[9:35] Ministry you know 11 years ago that's
[9:37] what I would do I would always fast and
[9:39] pray before all the videos and God has
[9:40] honored some of those videos you know
[9:42] God has used those to help people and
[9:43] strengthen people so that's why I found
[9:45] there's this key it's a simple key to
[9:47] unlock the door of God honoring you fast
[9:49] and pray Give in secret uh fast pray
[9:53] alms yep fast prayer alms it's a such a
[9:55] simple key put the key in the door open
[9:57] the door Hallelujah and God will honor
[10:00] you but we struggle with that sometimes
[10:02] right we battle with that we get busy we
[10:03] get hungry uh you know we get active
[10:07] right so we've got to remember that's
[10:10] the key to get God to honor you
[10:12] Hallelujah that's right he says then
[10:16] when the fear of God come upon Noah God
[10:18] called him by grace and saved him and
[10:21] his house because it was Grace that did
[10:22] it not because Noah was a great big
[10:25] handsomer man than all the rest of
[10:27] them so Austin's the the tallest in the
[10:30] church here right you know we so Noah
[10:32] wasn't the biggest handsomest man in the
[10:35] church he was just a humble
[10:38] farmer it's by
[10:40] Grace remember the only one the Bible
[10:42] describes like that or two of them are
[10:43] Absalon right and Saul and what did they
[10:46] turn out to do not much for God I don't
[10:49] even know if AB abson got saved I we
[10:51] know Paul I'm sorry we know Saul
[10:52] confessed at the end he stopped chasing
[10:54] David and he fought for Israel and and
[10:56] he
[10:57] died but he says
[10:59] not because Noah went to the best Church
[11:02] there was in the
[11:04] country I hope we have a good church I'm
[11:06] not we don't have to be the best but I
[11:08] hope we have a good church by God's
[11:09] grace Hallelujah not because he belonged
[11:13] to the best organization not because he
[11:15] could dress better he didn't have the
[11:18] best clothes not because he had more
[11:20] money than everybody not because he was
[11:22] some special person but because of the
[11:25] grace of God God saved Noah Grace saved
[11:28] Noah not his works but his grace and
[11:30] also saved his family hallelujah how
[11:34] many you remember that from the book of
[11:35] Hebrews let's go to Hebrews 11 remember
[11:37] that what it said about Noah he moved
[11:39] with the fear of God church that's what
[11:41] I think that's what why Sunday morning
[11:43] was so effective right you know put the
[11:46] fear of God in us brother our brother's
[11:48] talking about the Rapture could be any
[11:49] moment you know uh lockdowns and things
[11:52] uh you know the these things with the
[11:54] Olympics I I I hope it was a way to
[11:56] bring the fear of God back in our lives
[11:58] Hallelujah it's a good thing every now
[12:00] and then to do that that's why we got to
[12:02] return to our first love from time to
[12:03] time Hebrews uh 11:7 by faith Noah being
[12:07] warned of God of things not seen as yet
[12:12] and that's what we've had we've had
[12:13] brother Brandon warn us of things not
[12:14] seen right the W woman ruling America
[12:17] one place he says it's a woman president
[12:19] another place he said it's not a woman
[12:20] it's a Catholic Church my opinion is
[12:22] probably the Catholic church but here we
[12:24] have something that could be pretty
[12:25] close it could be both some people say
[12:27] it's both it could
[12:30] be move with fear so see we got to have
[12:33] that Godly fear the flood's coming I'm
[12:36] talking about the tribulation the the
[12:38] tribulation is
[12:39] coming Hallelujah so we have to have
[12:41] that reality and then we got to move
[12:43] based upon that reality I do not want to
[12:45] be here when the tribulation strikes
[12:46] praise God so I'm going to move with
[12:50] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[12:52] his house so remember you had to spend
[12:54] some people say 70 years some people say
[12:55] 120 depends how you read the text but he
[12:57] spent decades preparing that Ark that's
[13:00] why we spend decades in the house of God
[13:02] hallelujah I spent almost two decades
[13:04] preaching from this Pulpit right here
[13:06] hallelujah and by God's grace if he lets
[13:08] me T I'll keep doing it praise God
[13:10] because I'm preparing salvation for my
[13:12] family amen I'm preparing salvation for
[13:15] this church Hallelujah remember that
[13:17] scripture from First Timothy uh preached
[13:19] the doctrine and it'll save you and then
[13:21] that hear you that that's that that's
[13:24] what Noah did Noah had the right
[13:25] Doctrine so it saved the people what was
[13:27] his Doctrine get in the ark Hallelujah
[13:30] he's a preacher of righteousness get in
[13:31] the ark and that's what I'm saying get
[13:33] in Christ Hallelujah each one of us need
[13:36] to get in Christ hallelujah how do you
[13:38] get in Christ let Christ in you Christ
[13:40] in you the hope of Glory
[13:43] Hallelujah he said uh to the saving of
[13:46] his house by which he condemned the
[13:49] world see you know he wasn't condemning
[13:52] them but his actions because he chose
[13:54] the truth and he chose the right way it
[13:57] condemned everybody else but he was
[13:59] isn't saying I condemn you I condemn you
[14:00] I condemn you we should have love and
[14:02] compassion on
[14:03] Sinners right but the truth the true way
[14:06] will always condemn the false way that's
[14:07] all it's
[14:08] saying and became heir of the
[14:11] righteousness which is by faith he
[14:14] inherited the righteousness because he
[14:15] had the fear of
[14:17] God and he didn't want to die in the
[14:20] flood see church it's okay if you don't
[14:22] want to die in The Great Tribulation
[14:24] period amen that can be a good
[14:26] motivation sometimes Hallelujah
[14:29] the Bible said that it's it's moving
[14:31] with Godly fear
[14:34] hallelujah what do you think when the
[14:35] squeeze comes down what do you I mean
[14:36] you think you'll experience some fear of
[14:38] course right but our faith will o will
[14:41] supersede our fear Hallelujah because
[14:44] perfect love will cast it out
[14:46] Hallelujah right we're believing that by
[14:48] God's grace brother said it'll be the
[14:51] Supreme faith for the Supreme hour
[14:53] brother man makes that quote God will
[14:55] give us the Supreme Faith or the
[14:56] overcoming faith for the hour that we
[14:58] need to
[14:59] overcome Hallelujah just like every
[15:01] person down to the age uh Jesus had to
[15:03] have the Supreme Faith to go to the
[15:05] Cross right look at every Mo Noah had to
[15:07] have Supreme Faith to build an ark we've
[15:09] got to have Supreme Faith to go in the
[15:11] Rapture praise God and God will give it
[15:13] to us hallelujah because that's what
[15:15] we're preaching about we're not
[15:16] preaching about social issues or social
[15:18] justice we're talking about the word of
[15:20] God we're talking about the Rapture
[15:21] scriptures hallelujah we're talking
[15:22] about the grace of God we're talking
[15:24] about the Holy Ghost we're talking about
[15:25] a prophet of God hallelujah we're
[15:27] talking about the word of God hallelujah
[15:30] we Have No Agenda except God's agenda
[15:33] Hallelujah no Creed but Christ no uh no
[15:36] no law but love no book but the Bible
[15:37] and the church said Hallelujah that's
[15:40] right so that's Noah's
[15:42] testimony now you know Genesis chapter
[15:46] 6 but verse eight says but Noah found
[15:50] Grace in the eyes of the Lord now that
[15:53] word found it's not like Noah's walking
[15:55] around and be like oh look what I found
[15:56] I found Grace you know
[15:59] here I I found this map or I found the
[16:01] blueprints on how to build Arc I just
[16:04] found it no it means to
[16:06] attain Noah attained Grace brother man
[16:09] said because he feared God it has to be
[16:11] a free more agency choice or else God is
[16:14] going to be accused by all those that
[16:15] died in the flood well you didn't you
[16:16] didn't give it to me Noah found it but I
[16:18] didn't find it so you're unjust no it's
[16:21] Freemore agency everybody had the choice
[16:23] they were warn for decades Hallelujah
[16:25] we've been warned for almost 60 years
[16:27] since brother went off the scene the the
[16:29] Rapture is going to happen so let's move
[16:30] with fear let's prepare to the saving of
[16:33] our families
[16:35] hallelujah amen the Bible said he that
[16:38] wins Souls is wise so just remember that
[16:40] this week try to win a soul to Jesus
[16:42] Hallelujah that's why I'm doing that
[16:43] event over there that's why I'm going to
[16:45] drive three hours and spend the money
[16:47] I'm going to buy them a meal and hopes
[16:48] that they'll listen to me talk about
[16:50] Jesus if they walk out well I was not I
[16:53] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[16:54] vision brother Austin
[16:56] Hallelujah because you want to win so
[16:58] Souls that's one thing you want to do is
[17:00] win souls so we might even take out an
[17:02] ad in the and put it in the the paper
[17:04] and just try to do this maybe once a
[17:06] year or something to try to get people
[17:07] to come hear the gospel and use whatever
[17:09] influence I have left in my life not
[17:12] much probably but uh I want to try to
[17:14] use that to try to point somebody to
[17:16] Christ hey look over here I'm following
[17:18] Jesus Christ you might know me as a
[17:20] former football player state champion or
[17:22] something like that but now I Want To Be
[17:23] A Champion for Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[17:25] in other words I want to win the race
[17:27] that's set before me praise God
[17:29] I'm going uh who who who will follow me
[17:31] I'm going to follow Jesus amen who will
[17:33] follow me to to go to heaven Hallelujah
[17:36] that's what we all should do but Noah
[17:38] found Grace he attained to Grace because
[17:40] he desired Grace and he feared God so we
[17:43] see the power free more agency and God's
[17:46] for knowledge and then plus Church
[17:48] here's a good
[17:50] sign the proof that he receive Grace was
[17:53] that he preached
[17:55] righteousness remember we read that a
[17:56] couple weeks ago what does Titus 211 say
[17:59] Titus 2:11 says Grace teaches us to deny
[18:03] ungodliness right and our brother
[18:05] brought up those uh Deeds of nicadan
[18:06] scriptures remember that it's it's it's
[18:08] so easy if we remember the scripture if
[18:10] that's a big if if we remember the
[18:11] scripture it's so easy to recognize
[18:13] false teachers their lives will get more
[18:15] ungodly Our Lives should get more
[18:18] holy that's how I always know I don't
[18:21] care if I known the person the message
[18:22] 20 years or one year that's how I know
[18:24] if they're off the word brother Austin
[18:25] they live a less Godly life
[18:29] they're not striving to be more holy
[18:31] they're striving to be Unholy allow more
[18:34] things in their life now I said this
[18:37] before we've all gone through it there
[18:38] are certain things you thought you never
[18:39] do that you might you might have done
[18:41] but if God shows you it's wrong just
[18:43] repent and go back to your first Works
[18:45] amen that's what we've had to do at our
[18:48] house you know we've had to have we have
[18:49] different restrictions about uh screen
[18:51] time and things like that we just
[18:52] changed it up a few weeks ago and we're
[18:54] seeing good results amen hallelujah like
[18:57] these Services we've had amen then you
[19:00] know you see you you see yourself make a
[19:01] mistake that's fine just say Lord
[19:03] forgive me I'm sorry Lord let me do the
[19:04] first Works
[19:06] hallelujah
[19:08] amen remember all things will work
[19:10] together for good to them that love the
[19:12] Lord you know because of the things
[19:14] we've learned in our home you know then
[19:15] I can go preach in Kentucky and see the
[19:17] great move of God and then even a bigger
[19:18] move there in Iowa by God's grace and
[19:21] then we can receive a move of God
[19:23] hallelujah who's still moved by God
[19:25] since Sunday everybody still moved by
[19:27] God everybody moved
[19:29] moved ever got their first love back
[19:31] Hallelujah I've noticed this week my
[19:33] mind's been on the Lord more even more
[19:35] than it was before Hallelujah I've grown
[19:38] in Grace and knowledge of the lord it's
[19:40] been wonderful by God's grace of course
[19:42] it's nice to have that Fellowship there
[19:44] too with the
[19:45] Saints but see Noah attained Grace in
[19:48] the eyes of the Lord because he feared
[19:49] God as soon as God spoke to him he went
[19:51] on to action on it see so you when God
[19:55] tells you something you need to act on
[19:56] it I need to act on the word of God that
[19:58] I
[19:59] heard then God will honor you Hallelujah
[20:03] and then church just like just like Noah
[20:05] he'll put you in the Hall of Fame of
[20:07] faith is that right all because you
[20:10] believed it you just believe what the
[20:11] prophet said you believe the word you
[20:13] acted on it and then God gives you
[20:16] righteousness and then God honors you
[20:18] Hallelujah that's true remember this man
[20:22] got drunk later on and the church said
[20:25] brother Jesse a drunk person can be in
[20:27] the Hall of Fame yes because they
[20:29] repented their
[20:30] drunkenness God put murderers in the
[20:32] Hall of Fame former former murderers
[20:35] former drunks that's a big word right
[20:36] there let's be former Sinners Hallelujah
[20:39] whatever sin we struggle with right
[20:41] let's make it a former sin
[20:43] Hallelujah God I'll put you in the Hall
[20:45] of Fame of Faith Glory I believe that
[20:47] with all my
[20:49] heart because remember he wasn't anybody
[20:51] special he wasn't the biggest guy he
[20:53] wasn't the most handsome guy he wasn't
[20:54] the richest guy he was a guy that feared
[20:57] God Hallelujah that's all we got to have
[21:00] is a desire to fear God and prepare for
[21:04] our family
[21:05] salvation right like my mom didn't do
[21:08] much right because she couldn't do much
[21:09] she didn't have a lot of money but she
[21:10] did prepare for our Salvation she took
[21:12] us to church she prayed for us every
[21:14] morning she prayed for us every night if
[21:17] we're out too late she'd come to our
[21:18] friend's house and say well I'm not
[21:20] leaving till my son comes out of there I
[21:21] don't care what they're doing I don't
[21:23] care whose house that is I'm and she'd
[21:25] honk she'd blow the lights on there they
[21:27] finally come out it might be 12:00 it
[21:29] might be 1:00
[21:30] a.m. that's before cell
[21:32] phones now you got the cell phone now
[21:34] she can track
[21:36] them text
[21:38] them see you got to prepare if you're
[21:41] like brother man said if you're
[21:42] convinced then you'll be
[21:44] concerned I'm convinced I want to make
[21:46] the Rapture so I'm concerned about how I
[21:48] live my life amen Noah was convinced the
[21:50] flood was coming so he's concerned how
[21:52] am I going to save my family amen I'm
[21:54] convinced that tribulation is coming so
[21:56] I'm concerned how can I save as many as
[21:58] I can
[22:00] hallelujah what can I do to win a soul
[22:03] what can I do to save somebody praise
[22:04] God what can I do to invite the holy
[22:07] ghost in the church so everybody gets
[22:09] the Holy Ghost amen and everybody keeps
[22:11] the Holy Ghost can I say like that you
[22:12] know you never Le lose the seal but you
[22:14] keep your first love
[22:18] amen so let's take a lesson as brother
[22:20] Bram those are the lessons brother Bram
[22:22] gave us about the grace of God to Noah
[22:24] and then he quickly moved on to Abraham
[22:25] so I moved on to Abraham now I preached
[22:27] a lot on Abraham last year
[22:29] I know Austin liked it and I preach it
[22:31] over there remember I preached it there
[22:32] in PA and the brother Paul had been
[22:34] preaching on Abraham for
[22:36] months for four months he was preaching
[22:38] on Abraham's Covenant and I come in
[22:40] there I preach on Abraham I see them all
[22:42] look around
[22:43] like who told this brother well God told
[22:46] me but I didn't know he told me
[22:49] Hallelujah brother said we could call
[22:51] another character where God's grace was
[22:52] extended many of them we'll just speak
[22:55] of a few Abraham no special man
[22:59] you can see in his life he wasn't that
[23:02] special you I'll say like this I'm not
[23:04] very special either and don't think
[23:06] you're very special either because we're
[23:08] not
[23:08] special for all have fallen short of the
[23:11] glory of God none seeketh after God no
[23:15] not
[23:17] one came down from the Tower of Babel he
[23:20] was at the Tower of Babel perhaps come
[23:22] out of an idol Bunch his father that's
[23:24] actually scriptural he did come down in
[23:26] the land of Shar down there to dwell in
[23:27] the city of ER and while he was there
[23:29] God spoke to him by
[23:31] Grace not because he was different not
[23:34] because he was a better man but by Grace
[23:35] God called him the Bible clearly makes
[23:37] that known oh Abraham how he he says oh
[23:41] how Abraham tested God's
[23:45] patience remember that chart I gave
[23:47] there was like I think there was five
[23:49] red dots remember each one of those
[23:51] times he tested God's
[23:54] grace can I say it like this another
[23:57] Bible word you'll know is he frustrated
[23:59] the grace of God in other words God told
[24:01] him exactly brother Austin what to do
[24:03] but he did the exact opposite of
[24:05] that that's frustrating the grace of God
[24:08] or another word you might know is grieve
[24:10] that Grieves the grace of God right
[24:13] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy
[24:14] spirit of God whereby you're sealed to
[24:16] the day of your Redemption
[24:19] right brother says he didn't say oh how
[24:21] handsome Abraham was oh how rich he was
[24:24] rich but that's not what brother R calls
[24:25] out he said oh how disob Beed he was at
[24:29] times to God and that's what we do
[24:33] too we see we know the message we know
[24:36] so much that many times when we sin like
[24:37] I told you it's an iniquity because we
[24:39] know we shouldn't do
[24:41] it but thank God he forgives all
[24:44] iniquities so thankful for that
[24:46] scripture without that scripture I'd be
[24:47] sweating
[24:48] Austin I already am sweating when I
[24:50] preach hard too but I'd be swea for my
[24:53] soul and always remember if God could
[24:55] save David from a murderous adultery
[24:58] then God can save us to the utmost
[25:00] Hallelujah he could save that man up
[25:02] there down there in Glenn in for after
[25:04] 52 years of of uh Lous living and if the
[25:08] grace of God can come to him in a moment
[25:10] and deliver him from uh from from
[25:12] suicide and and a filthy life like that
[25:15] and wash him up and make him the
[25:16] happiest man in the church at 76 years
[25:18] old surely he can save us as well
[25:21] Hallelujah throughout your mind battles
[25:23] you're you're not even out in the world
[25:24] you know you're trying to serve God
[25:25] you're doing the best you can if God can
[25:27] extend his grace to them God will extend
[25:28] his grace to us as well
[25:30] hallelujah
[25:33] amen the Bible makes that known oh how
[25:36] Abraham tested God's
[25:40] patience he he told him and said Abraham
[25:42] stay in this land don't you go out of it
[25:44] but as soon as the famine come Abraham
[25:51] run Abraham spoke of us brother raham
[25:54] says everybody say I am Abraham ready I
[25:57] am Abraham now everybody can say I am
[25:58] Sarah ready I Sarah because you might be
[26:01] Sarah Abraham spoke of us God took
[26:03] Abraham by grace and saved him and
[26:05] that's how he takes you by grace and how
[26:08] do we test his
[26:10] patience sometimes we test God's
[26:12] patience remember he's not upset with us
[26:14] but we can grieve his Spirit brother
[26:16] said how do we test his patience he said
[26:18] today we're up tomorrow we're
[26:22] down one day we believe the next day
[26:26] we're wondering wonder if God is going
[26:28] to
[26:29] I wonder if God is going to let me go
[26:31] the rest but at church oh yeah I believe
[26:34] glory to God
[26:35] hallelujah Look What the Lord Has
[26:37] Done Hallelujah I got a reason to praise
[26:40] amen God turned my grave into a garden
[26:43] the next day do I have a do I have a
[26:46] garden is there anything growing in my
[26:47] garden do I have the fruits of the Holy
[26:52] Spirit we're up and down brother said
[26:55] that's our experience like Abraham's
[26:57] experience we test God's
[27:02] patience he said today we're a Methodist
[27:04] tomorrow we're a Baptist now that's not
[27:05] us by God's
[27:07] grace today we believe in Divine Healing
[27:09] tomorrow the tummy a comes and we don't
[27:11] know whether we believe it or
[27:13] not that that applies to us but yet in
[27:17] the midst of all that God wants us to
[27:18] stay put he saves us anyhow if it wasn't
[27:23] the grace of God we'd all be gone sure
[27:25] God Saves Us by his grace
[27:28] I love brother I love this sermon it's a
[27:30] beautiful
[27:33] sermon in the message of Grace he
[27:35] continues he says Abraham was supposed
[27:37] to stay in that land but he went down to
[27:39] the Chans I'm sorry not the Chans the
[27:41] Philistines he went down there to
[27:42] sojourn to get out of the famine
[27:44] actually I think that's wrong I think he
[27:45] went to Egypt to get out of the famine
[27:48] so there's another one we can add to the
[27:49] list of not not every words thus sayi
[27:51] the Lord things was a little hard up in
[27:53] his country so he went down there to
[27:54] Journey down there with him now listen I
[27:56] like this phrase done exactly what God
[27:59] told him not to
[28:01] do Church there's times we do exactly
[28:04] what God said don't do
[28:06] that the holy spirit will say don't do
[28:09] that and just we'll just blow right
[28:11] through it and do it we'll just blow
[28:13] through the stoplight brother B calls it
[28:15] he said you could you might make it a
[28:17] couple times and one of these times
[28:18] you're going to get hit keep going
[28:20] through stoplights brother B said that's
[28:22] your conscience your conscious says
[28:23] don't do that he said if you do it
[28:24] anyway you just blew through the
[28:26] stoplight right
[28:29] and brother said Abraham did exactly
[28:31] what God said don't
[28:34] do was Abraham
[28:37] saved did Abraham still have the
[28:39] Covenant glory to God yes he did are you
[28:43] still saved do you still have the
[28:46] Covenant the blood of Jesus Christ of
[28:48] course are you still Abraham's seed
[28:51] Hallelujah you're still God's child but
[28:54] sometimes the flesh is rebellious I
[28:56] should say every day the flesh is re
[28:59] rebellious he said done exactly what God
[29:01] told him not to do but yet the grace of
[29:03] God appeared to
[29:05] him kept Pharaoh from taking his wife he
[29:10] could have lost his wife because of his
[29:12] own Disobedience to
[29:16] God but God had Grace on
[29:19] him
[29:22] Hallelujah see church we we make
[29:24] decisions we could lose something we
[29:25] could lose all this because of our own
[29:27] decision we could lose our reputation
[29:29] that's probably one that would impact
[29:32] us I could make a decision and lose my
[29:34] reputation as a preacher or whatever so
[29:37] could you but what keeps you the grace
[29:40] of God keeps you and then if you do make
[29:43] a mistake what brings you back the grace
[29:45] of God brings you back just like Abraham
[29:49] Hallelujah and when you think about
[29:51] Abraham what do you think of the bad or
[29:53] the good I think of the good don't you I
[29:55] think of the father of the faith my
[29:58] received a child at 100 years old Sarah
[30:00] Sarah was 90 I don't think of the bad
[30:02] stuff oh yeah he in the famine time he
[30:05] got scared and R that's not the first
[30:06] thing I think about him I think about
[30:09] the blessedness of Abraham that's how
[30:12] that's how you think about yourself
[30:13] think about the blessings God has given
[30:15] to you praise God the promises
[30:18] Hallelujah he said it's the grace of God
[30:21] when Abraham said it's my sister he lied
[30:23] about it but yet the grace of God held
[30:25] him because he repented he was willing
[30:28] to
[30:29] repent and anybody that's willing to
[30:31] repent the grace of God still goes for
[30:33] you the grace of God is searching for
[30:36] you so that goes for you backsliders
[30:39] this morning he says the grace of God is
[30:40] still looking for you if you'll just
[30:42] repent God's grace is
[30:45] sufficient how he took good old Abraham
[30:48] brought him back good old Abraham he
[30:50] took good old Malachi and good old Jesse
[30:53] and good old Christen and took good old
[30:55] AAA and good old Caris I use my family
[30:57] names here
[30:58] it's a good old lyia and he brings us
[31:00] back by his grace
[31:05] Hallelujah and remember Abraham was not
[31:07] saved by his Works he was saved by grace
[31:10] Abraham was saved by faith which is
[31:11] Grace and God saved AB Abraham because
[31:13] of his grace not because of his
[31:16] behavior he saved him because of his
[31:18] grace oh how good he was saved by
[31:22] grace and I want to just give you a
[31:24] simple example you might remember this
[31:26] brother said done Abraham done exactly
[31:28] what God said don't
[31:31] do was there another Prophet that did
[31:33] that there's lots of prophets that did
[31:36] that right David but the one I want to
[31:39] show you is brother brandham you
[31:40] remember this one brother Bram had a a
[31:42] dream about the three poles of his
[31:44] ministry he tells about this in the
[31:46] seventh seal I don't know why so many
[31:47] seventh seal quotes have been coming to
[31:49] me lately but God's
[31:51] grace and the angel
[31:53] said he said don't try to explain that
[31:56] he said this is the third third pole but
[31:58] I'll meet you in there he said the
[32:00] little tent room there's a big tent I'm
[32:03] sorry there's a big tent there's a
[32:04] little room he said I'll meet you in
[32:05] that little room now I believe that was
[32:07] God meeting brother brandom at brother
[32:09] what's the brother's house uh always
[32:11] forget his
[32:12] name brother R's neighbor I can't
[32:15] remember his name I'll think of it later
[32:17] anybody remember H Banks Woods there it
[32:19] is Banks Woods he's the one that was
[32:21] there when the brother spoke to the fish
[32:23] and it got his life back um
[32:28] and and uh so so I I believe God met
[32:30] brother brandom in that little room and
[32:32] then revealed the Seven Seals to him the
[32:34] third pole and there was no
[32:35] impersonation of that it wasn't a public
[32:37] show God met him individually in that
[32:39] room now I could be wrong on that but
[32:40] that's just my that's my best
[32:42] guess but said I was standing in the
[32:44] vision with a little baby shoe when he
[32:47] told me he said now make your first poll
[32:49] when you do the fish will run after the
[32:50] lure said then was your second pole
[32:52] because it's only a it'll only be a
[32:54] small fish he said then the third pole
[32:56] will get it and all those ministers got
[32:59] around me saying brother random we know
[33:01] you can do it Hallelujah brother random
[33:02] that's where I always get tied up with a
[33:04] bunch of
[33:07] preachers see I love people they want
[33:09] you to explain everything this
[33:13] that that's where I always get tied up
[33:14] to a bunch of
[33:16] preachers and I said well uh uhhuh I
[33:18] said well I don't know I said I
[33:20] understand I've understand fishing now I
[33:22] said now the first thing you do here's
[33:23] the way it's done you see all the fish
[33:25] around you got to jerk The Lure well
[33:26] that's exactly the tactics of fish and
[33:28] so I said jerk The Lure now you see
[33:30] where I jerk The Lure the first time now
[33:32] the fish takes after it but they were
[33:34] little ones and that's just like they
[33:36] they were catching so the ministers were
[33:37] catching little fish but God told
[33:39] Brother R you'll catch the big fish with
[33:41] the third pole so what does that
[33:43] represent that represents the Holy Ghost
[33:45] filled Saints right because few there be
[33:47] that find it fewer and fewer Christians
[33:48] are being saved all the time the big
[33:50] fish represents the Bride of Jesus
[33:52] Christ Hallelujah because it's a small
[33:55] group Jesus said few there be that find
[33:56] the narrow road
[34:01] he says and then he said I jerked it out
[34:04] and when I did I had a fish on it for
[34:06] the third pole he had a fish on it he
[34:09] said but it looked like a skin Over The
[34:10] Lure it was so little so just like the
[34:13] fish was just fit over the top of the
[34:15] lure like the the whole fish was full of
[34:18] a lure it was so
[34:20] small and then I was standing there and
[34:22] the angel said I told you not to do
[34:25] that sound familiar like like
[34:28] Abraham Abraham did exactly what God
[34:31] told him to to not do brother Ram did
[34:35] exactly the opposite what the angel Lord
[34:36] told him to do and Friends there's me
[34:38] there's me there's numerous cases of
[34:40] that I'm trying to get you to see the
[34:42] same Grace that was with brother brandom
[34:44] is with you
[34:45] Hallelujah in other words God's grace
[34:47] doesn't leave you after you make
[34:49] mistakes the gifts and callings of God
[34:51] are without repentance amen you always
[34:53] have your gift you always have your
[34:54] calling just repent make it right God's
[34:56] with you Hallelujah I've seen in my life
[34:58] amen I make mistakes I fall short we I
[35:01] come back to God God use me again
[35:03] Hallelujah I don't even deserve it
[35:05] Hallelujah I'm not worthy of it I'll do
[35:08] exactly opposite what he tells me to do
[35:10] but then he'll still have Grace on me
[35:11] and use me later Hallelujah that's a god
[35:13] of Grace
[35:15] Hallelujah but man said I started crying
[35:18] all all the L line was Tangled around me
[35:21] we went fishing a few earlier this month
[35:22] that boy I got the line I got it I got
[35:24] my line all tangled up I felt like
[35:25] brother Brandon
[35:27] and I was standing there crying with my
[35:29] head down like that I said oh God
[35:30] forgive me I'm a stupid person oh Lord
[35:32] forgive me and I had this
[35:35] line and the voice said you can't teach
[35:39] Pentecostal babies Supernatural things
[35:41] now let them alone see remember brother
[35:43] BR was catering to the denominations he
[35:46] tells us that and as I was with Moses
[35:48] 1960 1960 I preach that to you when when
[35:51] the Joshua series remember brother R
[35:53] said he was majoring on the sign instead
[35:55] of the destination remember that that
[35:57] was a long time ago when brother Johnny
[35:59] and Sister Sarah were coming here
[35:59] remember that remember I had a sign uh
[36:01] signed to akan signed to signed to
[36:04] Cleveland there's all these signs
[36:05] brother Ram was majoring on the sign and
[36:07] said the destination in other words he
[36:10] was getting people to try in the prayer
[36:11] line this was the focus of it was the
[36:13] prayer line rather than just trying to
[36:14] get as many people healed as possible
[36:16] brother raham said I left thousands of
[36:19] people laying there without praying for
[36:21] them Hallelujah and he said God forgive
[36:24] me I measured on the sign instead of the
[36:27] destination and the church said church
[36:29] sometimes we major on the wrong
[36:32] things right sometimes can I just be
[36:34] honest sometimes we'll major on brother
[36:36] brandom too much emphasis on him
[36:39] sometimes we major on
[36:41] ourselves right sometimes we major on
[36:43] that preacher or that
[36:46] relative right we major on them instead
[36:49] of what we should major on on the right
[36:51] thing we should put the first things
[36:52] first Hallelujah we should stay humble
[36:55] Hallelujah
[36:57] brother told us he was trying to show
[36:59] the world that God could heal these uh
[37:01] the the hardest Miracles remember even
[37:03] in 1947 he tells us that uh when he had
[37:06] the first tapes he said I spent six
[37:08] months saying bring me the hardest cases
[37:10] and I'll prove that God's A Healer and
[37:12] God honored him but then the angel said
[37:14] you've been disobedient I never told you
[37:15] to do
[37:16] that so what I'm trying to show you is
[37:19] that there's Grace for brother brandom
[37:20] there'll be if there's Grace for the
[37:21] church age messenger there'll be grace
[37:23] for the rest of the church age
[37:25] Hallelujah if there's Grace for that
[37:27] star are in his hand there's Grace for
[37:29] the candlesticks Hallelujah am CU we're
[37:31] all drawing on the same oil Hallelujah
[37:34] every Church age pulled on the same oil
[37:37] that's what we're pulling on tonight the
[37:39] Holy Ghost Hallelujah so other words let
[37:42] let AC accept God's forgiveness that was
[37:44] some of the testimonies tonight right
[37:45] accept that God forgive you and then get
[37:47] the oil flown again and God will use you
[37:49] again hallelujah hallelujah that's right
[37:53] how many times have I seen that in my
[37:54] life my
[37:59] you can't teach the Pentecostal baby
[38:00] Supernatural things I know that I got
[38:02] family in Pentecostal churches I can't
[38:04] teach them Supernatural
[38:05] things it's the supernatural revelation
[38:08] of the B the
[38:09] baptism and hair length and makeup and
[38:12] pants and cross ring you can't teach him
[38:15] Supernatural things and the church
[38:17] said you can't even teach him
[38:18] Supernatural things like
[38:20] that any any dream they have is from God
[38:24] we ought to be more mature than
[38:26] that you try every dream amen you test
[38:30] every dream by the word of God I had a
[38:32] dream the other night Austin I was like
[38:34] fighting somebody from high school and I
[38:36] finally got him tied down and I tried to
[38:38] say some old joke now you think that was
[38:40] from God we were just playing around and
[38:43] I was like I was just it was a
[38:45] ridiculous
[38:47] dream but like you know you got to be
[38:49] careful now especially when your dreams
[38:50] involve God or Jesus right you gota be
[38:52] really careful it has to have has to
[38:55] have a Vindication from the word of God
[38:59] right so see we got to be able to learn
[39:02] Supernatural things spiritual things
[39:05] Hallelujah glory and then that seventh
[39:07] seal brother man said this third poll is
[39:09] coming up right so in March of 63 he
[39:12] said it's coming up right but he
[39:14] disobeyed
[39:16] God six months later in December he says
[39:19] the third poll has been Vindicated I'm
[39:21] sure you know what it is it's the
[39:22] opening of the word the speaking of the
[39:24] word right because he told the five test
[39:27] testimonies of speaking the word right
[39:29] squirrels storm uh Sunny Shimp uh his
[39:33] wife uh the tumor and then I forget the
[39:36] fifth one oh hady writes boys amen
[39:39] finally memorized all or finally got all
[39:41] five off there
[39:42] Hallelujah do just spoke the
[39:45] word wait wait for God to give you the
[39:47] word speak God's word hallelujah I've
[39:49] seen in my life I think three or four
[39:51] times now and uh Simon's seen it three
[39:53] or four times as well you speak the word
[39:55] when you're anointed by God God backs up
[39:58] his
[40:00] word so nine months later he says the
[40:03] third polls
[40:06] Vindicated he says but it won't be used
[40:08] in a great way until the council begins
[40:10] to tighten up we're see it tightening up
[40:12] aren't we that's
[40:14] right church and state coming
[40:19] together remember I'm going to preach
[40:20] this later when I get to the Rapture
[40:22] part but remember Noah is just one of
[40:24] six examples of Believers Escaping The
[40:27] Wrath of
[40:28] God Noah is one now he's a foolish
[40:31] virgin type but I want to let you know
[40:32] brother R uses him as a wise version
[40:34] type one time just so you know I'm gonna
[40:38] read it to you right now on the wings of
[40:39] a snow white dove less than a month
[40:41] before he died he said the ark was
[40:44] constructed once you were inside there's
[40:46] only one window in it and it was right
[40:48] in the top you couldn't look sideways
[40:50] you couldn't look no way but straight up
[40:52] that's the way the ark Jesus Christ is
[40:55] you can't look at the next fellow
[40:59] you can't look at brother
[41:00] Jess can't look at sister so and so you
[41:04] can't look at anybody else you got to
[41:06] look up you got to look to Jesus
[41:08] Hallelujah you can't look at nothing but
[41:11] Christ when you're in the ark because
[41:12] there's only one door and he's that door
[41:15] we talked about this morning Christ is
[41:16] the door Christ is the salt Christ is
[41:19] the water Christ is the light of the
[41:20] world Christ is everything he's the door
[41:22] of the Sheepfold Hallelujah he's the
[41:24] great Shepherd look to Jesus Hallelujah
[41:29] amen see brother says that's the way
[41:32] Christ The Ark Jesus Christ is so Jesus
[41:35] Christ is the ark yes so see that
[41:39] represents we can use it as a type of
[41:41] the Rapture normally it's a foolish
[41:42] versin type but brother M here uses it
[41:44] as we we must look up to Jesus only we
[41:48] must be in Christ then we then we uh
[41:50] bypass the tribulation period I'll say
[41:52] it like that Hallelujah
[41:57] he says you can't look to the next
[41:58] fellow you got to look straight at
[42:00] Christ 1 Peter 3:20 also remember Noah
[42:03] is the type of just being saved first
[42:05] Peter 3:20 which sometime were
[42:06] disobedient remember Jesus preaching to
[42:08] the souls that were lost there in the
[42:09] heart of the earth after the uh he died
[42:12] when Once the longsuffering of God
[42:14] weighed in the days of
[42:16] Noah remember most of those people
[42:18] Church were uh what was Noah Noah was
[42:20] 600 years old when the flood came most
[42:22] of those people were old people they now
[42:25] they were still young in their in one
[42:26] way way but they' been there for many
[42:28] years they've been warned for many many
[42:30] years they had plenty of times to repent
[42:33] you ought to feel thankful if you
[42:35] repented on Sunday Hallelujah and if you
[42:37] didn't repent on Sunday tonight's your
[42:38] night hallelujah amen get right with God
[42:42] Amen don't take any chances praise
[42:45] God that's
[42:47] right they waited the days of Noah while
[42:49] the ark was a preparing where in few
[42:51] that his eight Souls were saved by water
[42:53] the like figure so what is Noah type of
[42:56] the figure is even baptism does now also
[42:59] save us so just as the water saved Noah
[43:02] water baptism saves us not not the
[43:05] putting away the filth of the flesh not
[43:06] your behavior but it's the answer of a
[43:09] good conscience toward God by the
[43:11] resurrection of Jesus Christ see it's
[43:14] the answer of your free moral agency yes
[43:17] I'll follow Jesus Christ yes I'll go be
[43:19] baptized because I've died to my will
[43:21] and I'm resurrected I'm a new person
[43:23] praise God and the answer of a good
[43:25] conscience proves I'm saved
[43:28] Hallelujah so Saints if the Devil comes
[43:30] to you tomorrow you can look at him and
[43:31] say Satan get behind me I was baptized
[43:34] I'm
[43:35] saved 1 Peter 3:21 says it Hallelujah
[43:39] say it's written
[43:41] Satan is that right Church what did
[43:44] Jesus do when Satan came to him did he
[43:45] do some miracle no he just said it's
[43:48] written I'm standing on the word the
[43:50] word has enough power of its own
[43:53] Hallelujah stand with God's word tonight
[43:55] Hallelujah give Satan the word test I
[43:59] heard a preacher say it it was really
[44:00] good he said the I no he's not a
[44:02] preacher I heard a man say on that video
[44:05] uh the Tucker C video that man said the
[44:07] Bible says resist Satan he will flee
[44:10] that means run so when you speak God's
[44:13] word Satan just doesn't go like well see
[44:16] you later he actually runs I don't want
[44:18] I don't have a lot of room to run in
[44:19] here I could jump in here he actually
[44:21] will flee that's how much he's afraid of
[44:23] the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he
[44:25] will flee remember he fell like
[44:27] lightning from Heaven Satan will flee oh
[44:30] my what a Change of Atmosphere we should
[44:31] feel when we confess our sins and we
[44:34] trust in the blood of Jesus Christ Satan
[44:36] should flee instantly and we should
[44:37] instantly feel the peace of God come
[44:39] back into our lives because he flees he
[44:41] don't hang around he flees if you resist
[44:44] him he will leave you
[44:46] hallelujah
[44:48] amen that's for somebody because that
[44:49] was in my notes Hallelujah I didn't plan
[44:52] to say that I thought it was a good
[44:54] thought but I forgot about it for my
[44:55] notes
[44:57] so Noah he found Grace he missed the
[45:00] wrath of God because of Grace Enoch
[45:02] that's that's our type real real type
[45:05] Esther it was coming for all the all the
[45:07] Believers all the Jews like all the
[45:10] Christians lot right he's a type of
[45:13] foolish virgin but look he he believed
[45:15] in God and so God had mercy on him he
[45:17] won't destroy the righteous with the
[45:19] wicked thank God we can be righteous
[45:21] through the blood of Christ and the Holy
[45:23] Spirit praise
[45:25] God see that proves that as you prepare
[45:28] your family to miss the tribulation
[45:30] period that proves you got faith just
[45:32] like Noah and that proves you're going
[45:35] to miss the
[45:36] tribulation because you're going in the
[45:38] Rapture hallelujah how many you believe
[45:40] that by God's
[45:41] grace it think about it it has to be us
[45:44] because nobody else is preaching it
[45:46] really certainly nobody else is living
[45:49] it right like we're trying to live it by
[45:51] the grace of God
[45:57] so see we have that answer of a good
[45:59] conscience toward God so brother Ram
[46:02] uses Noah as one type as the baptism of
[46:04] the Holy Ghost because we got to be he
[46:05] says in Jesus Christ The Ark another
[46:08] time uh Noah is used as salvation that's
[46:11] how we know we're saved okay I didn't do
[46:13] the other two the other Parable is the
[46:15] King's son Parable because remember all
[46:17] those who had the wedding garment stayed
[46:19] in the wedding right but The Man Without
[46:21] The Wedding garment there was weeping
[46:22] wailing and nashing of teeth outside the
[46:24] supper and the church said see they
[46:27] missed the wrath of God because they had
[46:28] on the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[46:30] amen don't you know you got the
[46:32] righteousness of Jesus Christ tonight
[46:33] praise God
[46:35] hallelujah and then the sixth and final
[46:37] one was the 10 virgins now I want to
[46:40] just go there real
[46:41] quick what was the uh I can't remember
[46:44] the reaction to them missing the were
[46:47] they just knocking maybe there wasn't
[46:49] any negative
[46:51] consequence Matthew 25 I think it's 13
[46:58] oh he just says I know you not okay so
[47:01] there's no mention of weeping and
[47:03] wailing and nashing of teeth but there
[47:05] is that effect of Jesus will say I never
[47:07] knew you I don't know you you're not
[47:09] born again like brother like brother
[47:11] Paul said you haven't been in the
[47:12] bedroom with me I I I haven't become
[47:14] your the love of your life right
[47:18] Hallelujah but Jesus was the love of the
[47:20] life of the wise virgins he was their
[47:22] love of their life Hallelujah their
[47:24] greatest love what's your greatest love
[47:26] what's your greatest Joy certainly it's
[47:28] worshiping Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[47:30] nothing greater than that Hallelujah
[47:33] I've never seen anything greater that's
[47:34] why I keep coming back every Wednesday
[47:35] brother Austin every Sunday morning
[47:37] every Sunday night because there's
[47:38] nothing greater in this world than being
[47:40] in God's
[47:41] presence is there anything greater I was
[47:43] right here was there anything greater
[47:45] than praying for people I was so tired
[47:46] but I was kind of lean like this I was
[47:48] praying for Haven is there anything
[47:49] greater than praying and and crying and
[47:52] trusting in God and knowing that God is
[47:53] heing your prayer and then we stand up
[47:55] and pray then then Nia comes around and
[47:56] hugs me and he starts praying for me I'm
[47:58] like I'm going to pray for you too buddy
[48:00] thanks for thanks for your prayers
[48:02] Hallelujah is there anything greater
[48:03] than that where you feel the presence of
[48:05] God and you just feel like if I had the
[48:07] strength I could worship God all
[48:09] day there's sometimes I feel like I
[48:11] could preach four or five hours I think
[48:13] I really
[48:14] could I really could I could probably
[48:17] sing four or five hours too I've clapped
[48:19] so hard brother Austin until my hands
[48:20] have bled in Pennsylvania I didn't have
[48:23] a lot of wisdom in those days
[48:26] a lot of zeal but not a lot of
[48:29] wisdom but is there anything greater
[48:31] than that uh you know going to see some
[48:35] Monument the Grand Canyon what would be
[48:37] greater going to see the Grand Canyon or
[48:39] or going or or having the Holy Ghost
[48:41] visit you amen it's the greatest
[48:43] blessing we got because we fear God God
[48:46] comes and honors you
[48:50] hallelujah hallelujah I'm happy Glory I
[48:54] better finish up here by God's grace
[48:56] long preaching okay uh 48 that's pretty
[48:59] short sermon 49 minutes I know we got
[49:01] started late but let me go one more here
[49:03] I'll go one
[49:04] more yeah because there's only one
[49:07] more all right uh next brother Ram's
[49:09] next example so we've been through Noah
[49:10] Abraham his last example I'm sorry the
[49:13] last example I'm going to use for this
[49:14] service is Israel brother Braham said
[49:16] let's take uh Israel go to Deuteronomy
[49:18] 7:7 brother Braham uses this verse in
[49:21] the message uh the message of Grace if
[49:23] you haven't listened that I'd encourage
[49:24] You Have you listened to that brother
[49:25] message of Grace
[49:28] yeah amen
[49:30] amen uh
[49:32] 1961 yeah it's a great one if you have
[49:34] it it's
[49:37] it's oh I don't know that that's a good
[49:39] question
[49:41] buddy on my I I do the podcast it's it's
[49:44] purple on my
[49:46] podcast it's a if church if you haven't
[49:48] listened to that I really encourage you
[49:50] listen to to Really uh build your faith
[49:52] up because it's all about of course
[49:54] God's grace that's what we're saved by
[49:56] not you're not saved by works Sav by
[49:58] Grace Deuteronomy
[50:00] 7:7 so brother uses this verse
[50:03] here the Lord did not set his love upon
[50:06] you nor choose you because you were more
[50:07] in number than any of people for you at
[50:10] the fewest of all
[50:12] people see in other words God didn't
[50:14] choose his love because you're better
[50:15] than somebody God didn't choose to love
[50:18] us because we're the biggest church
[50:20] somebody should say Amen on that I'll
[50:22] say amen amen verse eight but because
[50:25] the Lord loved you
[50:28] that's why I chose you he love you and
[50:31] because he would keep the oath which he
[50:33] had sworn unto your fathers hath the
[50:35] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[50:37] and redeemed you out of the house of
[50:38] bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of
[50:40] Egypt know therefore that the Lord thy
[50:43] God he is God the faithful God which
[50:44] keepeth Covenant and mercy with them
[50:46] that love him and keep his COV
[50:48] Commandments to a thousand generations
[50:51] and repe them that hate him to their
[50:53] face to destroy them he will not be
[50:54] slacked to him that hateth him he will
[50:56] repay pay him to his face Thou shalt
[50:58] therefore keep the Commandments and the
[50:59] statutes and the judgments which I
[51:01] command to thee this day to do them so
[51:04] brother quotes this and he
[51:07] says God gave Abraham his
[51:10] promise I'm sorry God gave it to Israel
[51:12] he says he says if you will not
[51:14] associate with idolatry now he's using
[51:16] other verses in this chapter if you will
[51:18] not do these things if you'll stay away
[51:20] from all these Pagan ceremonies how many
[51:21] staying away from the
[51:24] Olympics if you'll do all these things
[51:26] then I'll bring you to a good land I'll
[51:27] take care of you I'll feed you I'll lead
[51:29] you I'll do all these things if you do
[51:31] such and such things if you'll love me
[51:33] if you'll keep my Commandments my
[51:35] statutes my ordinances I'll do all these
[51:37] things if you'll just do something and
[51:39] keep my Commandments and love me and
[51:42] brother said that God promising that to
[51:44] Israel is just like a husband to a wife
[51:46] now he goes into the home life just like
[51:49] a husband takes a wife and said honey
[51:51] I'll if you'll be a good woman I'll take
[51:53] care I'm sorry if if you'll be a good
[51:55] woman if you'll take care of the house
[51:57] if you'll be true to me if you'll keep
[51:59] my clothes clean if we have children if
[52:01] you'll be a good mother to them if
[52:02] you'll do these things I'll work till my
[52:04] hands bleed to make you a living if
[52:06] you'll do
[52:07] it so brother he shows an example of
[52:10] God's like a husband Israel's like the
[52:12] the wife he says that's what a husband
[52:15] does with his
[52:17] wife Hallelujah they agree to love each
[52:20] other
[52:22] Hallelujah but then but brother say but
[52:25] then think what if the woman turn turns
[52:26] wrong like Israel
[52:28] did lives lazy won't work won't do
[52:31] nothing he says then it takes Grace to
[52:34] keep that family together now look what
[52:37] brother brother is building this up he
[52:38] said this is what Israel did Israel
[52:40] should have kept the commands but they
[52:43] didn't but did but is is is Israel
[52:46] forever gone church out of the plan of
[52:48] God of course
[52:51] not he says how can I forget you he said
[52:53] you're engraved in the palm of my hands
[52:55] I died for you you amen and if he died
[52:58] for rebellious Israel and still loves
[53:01] them what about you who you're trying to
[53:02] obey him you've got you're born again
[53:04] you're not trusting in another blood of
[53:06] bulls and ghats you're trusting in the
[53:07] blood of God's own son Jesus Hallelujah
[53:10] surely he won't forget you amen he can't
[53:13] forget you
[53:14] Hallelujah you're his beloved now
[53:16] remember Romans nine always always
[53:18] remember that you're God's
[53:21] beloved I know Austin is God's beloved I
[53:23] know that that's been Vindicated to me
[53:25] brother I told that testimony Wherever I
[53:28] Go remember uh John beloved to the Lord
[53:32] Leah loved the Lord Austin loved to the
[53:36] Lord you're sitting right there in front
[53:38] of me brother brother Austin you're
[53:40] loved to the
[53:41] Lord hallelujah that's
[53:44] right he says if a woman turns lazy then
[53:46] it takes Grace to keep that family
[53:48] together oh God it taken the grace of
[53:51] Jehovah to keep his family
[53:54] together that includes us
[53:58] and that's the only way we're Jehovah's
[54:00] family today is because of the grace of
[54:03] Jesus Christ we'd all be gone but it's
[54:05] Grace oh Grace he says Grace Grace we
[54:09] shout Grace Grace unto the coming
[54:11] headstone unto the coming of the Rapture
[54:13] we're shouting thank God for Grace thank
[54:15] you Jesus for Grace Grace that you're
[54:17] coming to get us out of this world
[54:19] hallelujah
[54:22] amen he said but Israel didn't keep it
[54:24] they never did come to the the full
[54:26] promise not that generation the one that
[54:29] promised was made to they perished in
[54:30] the wilderness but God fed them God took
[54:32] care of them God loved them God moved
[54:34] them around why his grace in it his
[54:36] grace because of his promise his promise
[54:39] then the grace that went with his
[54:41] promise but they never did come to the
[54:42] full value of the promised land now look
[54:46] at that people can people can fail God's
[54:48] grace but he keeps giving them more
[54:50] grace doesn't the doesn't the rain fall
[54:52] on the just and the
[54:54] unjust that's great
[54:58] brother raham said and neither will the
[55:00] church now talking about us neither will
[55:01] the church come to its full value the
[55:04] grace of God holds us are we at the spot
[55:08] where we do we do we see the fullness of
[55:10] Pentecost in the bride yet not quite we
[55:13] need some paralyzed people to
[55:15] walk when I start seeing paralyzed
[55:17] people walk and blind eyes see then I'll
[55:19] know we're in the fullness of Pentecost
[55:21] right because you can't do nothing
[55:22] greater than Jesus hallelujah or a dead
[55:24] person raised after two days days or a
[55:26] day or something like that so we don't
[55:28] have it there we don't have it yet there
[55:31] but we have so much like I'll say like
[55:33] this remember compare our church like to
[55:35] the Corinthian
[55:36] Church I'm not suing Austin for anything
[55:39] and Austin's not suing me for
[55:41] anything they were suing each
[55:44] other a man was sleeping with his
[55:47] stepmother right they were arguing well
[55:50] I'm of brother Jesse no I'm of Donnie
[55:53] Reagan or I'm I'm of Cam Smith cam
[55:55] Smith's better than your my my pastor's
[55:57] better than your pastor I'm they were
[55:59] arguing about in the
[56:02] church look how you look how great I am
[56:05] and you know they were arguing about
[56:07] that and Paul says you're
[56:09] carnal you got divisions and factions
[56:12] among you those things shouldn't be he
[56:13] said we're all of Christ he said you
[56:15] should have been baptized in the name of
[56:17] the one that was crucified for you I'm
[56:19] glad I didn't baptized none of you he
[56:21] said some of you would have said I
[56:22] baptized you in my own name that's how
[56:24] carnal they were they were saying well I
[56:26] I could be baptized in Paul's name oh
[56:28] brother brandham baptized me or I I was
[56:30] baptizing in brother bram's name those
[56:33] were the problems in the church we don't
[56:35] have those problems thank God we don't
[56:37] have those problems if we did I might
[56:40] resign you might leave right because
[56:43] where's the Holy Ghost amen where's the
[56:45] spirit of God Church it tells us
[56:46] something the grace of God is here the
[56:48] Holy Ghost is here let's keep pressing
[56:50] into the things of God
[56:52] hallelujah it tells us we're making some
[56:54] progress by God's grace amen
[57:04] hallelujah he says this church must
[57:06] hasn't come to its full value yet he
[57:08] said but God wants to get a church
[57:10] that'll obey him a people that'll take
[57:12] his word and say it's the truth
[57:14] regardless of your organization now we
[57:16] we won't battle that he wants a people
[57:18] that will not say well I'm just as good
[57:20] as you are I'm Presbyterian I'm
[57:21] Methodist I'm Catholic I'm as good as
[57:23] you are that's not Grace that shows
[57:26] there's something
[57:27] wrong okay so's he's getting down into
[57:30] churches arguing now church for us we
[57:33] can't say well we're better than that
[57:34] church because they're the goat church
[57:35] or we're better than that church because
[57:37] they're a tape tape church only that's
[57:39] that's what I want I want you to get
[57:40] that you understand we can't pridefully
[57:43] say I'm better than the tape church or
[57:45] we're better we're better than those uh
[57:47] goat preachers we're the say they're the
[57:49] greatest of all we can't exalt ourselves
[57:51] in any
[57:52] way right that's why I took last last
[57:56] year and I specifically invited somebody
[57:58] from the goat group to come preach for
[58:00] us to show Fellowship to show that I'm
[58:03] not a part of the Deeds of
[58:04] nians that's what the nicadan did you
[58:06] just heard it preach diophy said we're
[58:09] not receiving John we're not receiving
[58:11] the preachers of that message because
[58:13] I've got a better Revelation than he's
[58:15] got see so see now if this may be the
[58:19] case if message people don't invite me
[58:21] back because what I believe they could
[58:23] have the Deeds of nicoladis if I if I'm
[58:25] preaching the truuth everybody seeing
[58:26] I'm trying to be humble if I'm preaching
[58:28] the truth and they don't invite me back
[58:30] they might have the Deeds of nicadan but
[58:32] I don't want the Deeds of nicadan do you
[58:35] understand now people are going to
[58:37] preach false Doctrine you know I'm not
[58:38] going to invite them I'm only going to
[58:40] preach the ones that are good in their
[58:41] groups the true preachers in their
[58:43] groups everybody understand and M church
[58:45] this is serious God said Jesus said I
[58:46] hate that I hate when people uh become
[58:50] denominational and they won't invite
[58:52] somebody just because they believe the
[58:54] truth and they don't have the truth
[58:56] so jealousy amongst preachers God hates
[59:00] that right so we can never exalt
[59:02] ourselves we're better than the tape
[59:03] people we're better than uh the goat
[59:05] people we are what we are because of the
[59:08] grace of
[59:10] God now do we believe we're right of
[59:12] course we believe we're right but we're
[59:14] not prideful about it and I don't think
[59:17] you are I'm just letting you know that's
[59:18] your warning that's what that's what
[59:19] Paul said Paul said God told him to warn
[59:23] us we don't we don't do the Deeds of
[59:25] nians
[59:26] and don't lose your first
[59:28] love
[59:31] hallelujah hallelujah but a person
[59:34] regardless that will read God's word and
[59:36] see that you've got to be born again and
[59:38] filled with the Holy Ghost they'll
[59:40] believe that they'll take it by the word
[59:42] they'll take the word exactly what it
[59:44] says so by I'm saying that's the kind of
[59:47] bride Jesus wants I'm gonna read it
[59:48] again because I read it kind of fast how
[59:50] many believe you got to be born again
[59:53] and filled with the Holy Ghost which is
[59:54] the same thing
[59:56] and how many believe you got to take the
[59:58] word exactly the way it's
[1:00:00] written brother man says then you're
[1:00:02] doing what God called you to
[1:00:04] do
[1:00:07] Hallelujah there's my hour my timer just
[1:00:10] went off let's stand to our feet by
[1:00:11] God's grace Mal can
