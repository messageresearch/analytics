[38:48] about that one thing the devil he's an
[38:56] accuser and he's there accusing and he
[39:01] can accuse me of something from the past
[39:03] of the Lord

[39:17] amen amen hit it's good to be here the
[39:22] sport and we got a little message this
[39:24] morning and I changed my message this
[39:27] morning I wasn't satisfied all night I
[39:30] was a little bit restless and we're
[39:33] going to give you a little unauthorized
[39:36] history lesson it's not authorized
[39:39] necessarily by sanction by Ohio or the
[39:46] United States because some of this
[39:48] history has been lost about your great
[39:52] nation about Israel and different things
[39:57] so you pray for me this morning that I
[40:01] can just put this together I preached
[40:04] this to a very there was only two people
[40:08] in this congregation and I sat in a and
[40:11] a couch and preached it and so on up but
[40:16] I wrote these notes down so Hurley I'm
[40:18] Mike after will read my own notes and I
[40:20] still do have trouble read my own notes
[40:21] cause my handwriting I'm like a doctor
[40:24] you can't understand that you can't yeah
[40:26] I mean you can't if you look at my notes
[40:28] you probably couldn't do a thing with
[40:30] them you couldn't but I know what they
[40:31] are so I can do it I believe so I still
[40:35] believe in handwriting handy writing out
[40:37] all my notes you know bring in my Bible
[40:39] I believe in the old black book the
[40:42] Bible goes I like I like a black you can
[40:44] have a white Bible that's all right like
[40:46] a black Bob because black shows
[40:49] Authority did you know even these gold
[40:53] edges on your Bible silver on this has
[40:55] come for the voice of God represents
[40:57] deity that's right you realize there's
[41:02] 66 books in the Bible and there's 66
[41:05] chapters and Isaiah Isaiah's from the
[41:08] beginning and to the new earth God's
[41:10] Word is perfect God's Word was without
[41:13] air and you can believe that you can
[41:16] stand upon this Bible and I still like
[41:19] the author
[41:20] eyes king james version of the bible
[41:22] give you over here for lesson before you
[41:25] sit down
[41:27] did you know queen elizabeth couldn't
[41:31] have any children they called her the
[41:34] Virgin Queen she never had no children
[41:37] so when she died
[41:40] there was the successor was from
[41:45] Scotland in his name was James and with
[41:50] James became king he had a burden for a
[41:53] new Bible because he wasn't satisfied
[41:56] with the old translation in the first
[42:00] nine years it took nine years but he got
[42:03] I believe Holy Ghost filled men and that
[42:07] King James Bible was translated and it
[42:11] came to pass because Queen Elizabeth
[42:13] couldn't have no children
[42:15] hey man and had to choose a Scot to
[42:18] become King and that wonderful God has a
[42:21] plan the devil can't stop God's plan
[42:24] amen let us pray Heavenly Father as we
[42:27] stand together in this place that has
[42:30] been sanctified and set aside for the
[42:33] service of God we thank you for it we
[42:36] think for each one that is here and we
[42:38] commit our lives to you and we place our
[42:41] gift on the altar of God because you
[42:45] said if our heart condemn if it's not
[42:47] then we have confidence towards God my
[42:50] confidence this morning is toward my god
[42:54] in my Savior we're believing Lord you'll
[42:57] give me the right words to say words of
[42:59] eternal life and then we leave here we
[43:02] can say it was good to be in the house
[43:04] of God we commit this service to you in
[43:07] the name of Jesus Christ amen turn your
[43:11] Bibles to Isaiah chapter 62 we'll begin
[43:16] reading in verse 1 I think we'll run
[43:19] down about 5 verses and hit a couple
[43:21] verses towards the end of the chapter
[43:23] for times sake we'll give you the title
[43:28] of our message then in Isaiah chapter 62
[43:32] for Zions sake will I not hold my peace
[43:35] and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest
[43:38] until the righteous thereof go forth as
[43:41] brightness and the salvation thereof is
[43:44] a lamp that burn it in the Gentiles
[43:47] shall see thy righteousness and all the
[43:49] kings I glory and thou shall be called
[43:52] by a new name which the mouth of the
[43:55] Lord shall name thou shall also be a
[43:58] crown of glory in the hand of the Lord
[44:01] and a royal diadem in the hand of thy
[44:04] God thou shalt no more be termed
[44:08] forsaken neither shall thy land anymore
[44:11] be termed desolate but thou shalt be
[44:14] called hepzibah in thy land Beulah for
[44:19] the Lord delighteth in thee in thy land
[44:22] shall be married for as a young man
[44:25] marries a virgin so shall thy sons marry
[44:28] thee and as the bridegroom rejoices over
[44:31] the bride so shall thy God rejoice over
[44:35] thee and then in verse 11 and 12 behold
[44:38] the Lord had proclaimed unto the end of
[44:40] the world say you to the daughter of
[44:42] Zion behold thy salvation cometh behold
[44:46] his reward is with him and his work
[44:48] before him and they shall call them the
[44:52] holy people the redeemed of the Lord and
[44:54] thou shalt be called salt out a city not
[44:58] forsaken you may be seated
[45:00] may God add his blessings to the reading
[45:02] of the words I want to title this
[45:04] message New Jerusalem which is above New
[45:09] Jerusalem which is above now before we
[45:12] go any further I mentioned this last
[45:14] night about Abraham had three sons
[45:16] because we want to place this in here
[45:18] because we want to see some things but
[45:22] probably God said in the seed is not air
[45:24] with the shuckin galatians force 27 it
[45:27] is written rejoice thou barren that
[45:29] bearest not break forth and cry thou
[45:33] that trail is not for the desert has
[45:35] many more children that which or a hug
[45:37] has a husband now we brethren as Isaac
[45:41] we are the children of promise but as
[45:44] then he that was born
[45:46] after the flesh persecuted that was born
[45:48] after the spirit so even it is now never
[45:51] let what saith the scripture cast out
[45:54] the bondwoman her son for the son is of
[45:56] the bondwoman shall not be heir with the
[45:58] son of the freewoman brethren we are not
[46:00] children of the bondwoman but of the
[46:03] free of guess script now the Lord
[46:05] brother Benson Lord and his blessings to
[46:08] this world word he said this is because
[46:13] God is unusual and those that really
[46:16] serve Him from their heart serve him an
[46:18] unusual way we're different you know the
[46:22] Texas called the seat is not ever the
[46:24] shuk Paul here is speaking of the
[46:26] literal seed of Abraham two sons Paul
[46:30] gladly is bringing himself into position
[46:32] of the birth by the free woman amen now
[46:36] we know that Abram had two sons by two
[46:40] different women God gave him a promise
[46:42] by Sarah through Sarah rather that there
[46:45] would be a son born and through this son
[46:48] the world would be blessed all nations
[46:50] were blessed of the Sun and his commonly
[46:52] believed especially among the Jews that
[46:55] this was Isaac but it wasn't this
[46:57] promise of Abraham is Jesus and he is
[47:01] the royal seed of the promise of Abraham
[47:05] a man now his Abba my delight is in thee
[47:13] was another name for Jerusalem and hero
[47:18] that in right around the world war one
[47:24] Jerusalem was controlled by the Turks
[47:28] this Empire I don't know if you ever saw
[47:32] the series beyond all odds about Israel
[47:36] two movies and during this time the
[47:45] great Jenner was general Allenby but
[47:48] there was another group of the English
[47:51] army that had mark
[47:54] to a certain point and that army I don't
[48:00] remember the the Colonel's name or the
[48:03] captain's name but right before battle
[48:06] this captain had the Bible open by
[48:09] himself in his tent and he was reading
[48:12] the scripture first samuel chapter 14 he
[48:17] was reading were jonathan when you know
[48:24] saul he was lifted up in a battle
[48:28] against the Philistines and Jonathan
[48:33] read in this this captain read in the
[48:37] scripture where Jonathan found a
[48:42] passageway and he would go up this
[48:46] passageway one side was bows as one side
[48:49] was seen I bow says was a thorny place
[48:53] see not was a shining shining and I
[48:56] believed myself we won't go into the
[48:58] Johnson was kind of blinded for a series
[49:01] of time and he saw that and he went to
[49:10] his commanding officer see what I saw in
[49:13] the scripture and they went the same way
[49:19] you know Jonathan and his little armored
[49:22] bear he said there's armored bear you
[49:25] know yeah you know nothing was going
[49:27] right and solved in one of the fight and
[49:30] Saul didn't want him to eat and and he
[49:32] said some body's gonna do something he
[49:36] said we'll go up if those Philistines
[49:40] says come on up to us we know they were
[49:43] God's given to us but if they stay back
[49:45] we know but they went up and the Bible
[49:48] says Jonathan was crawling all fours
[49:50] when he got up there and he said that
[49:53] they said well why don't you come up to
[49:56] us and John's that said to his arm but
[49:58] God has given to us and you know what
[50:01] there was 20 men they killed 20 men him
[50:03] and his armor-bearer a half acre of land
[50:06] and the whole arm
[50:07] the Philistines went crazy it said the
[50:11] earth quaked because they was going
[50:13] crazy and they was discontinuing this
[50:15] elf and they want and did you know
[50:17] Jonathan later on it was commanded that
[50:19] Jonathan they should not eat but Johnson
[50:21] did hear the commandments of Saul and
[50:23] Jonathan said that he took his staff and
[50:26] reached up and got some honey and he
[50:29] took that honey and the Bible says my
[50:32] eyes has been enlightened what do you
[50:35] mean is I I believe he had been
[50:37] partially blinded and it did everything
[50:39] he did for God and won the battle and
[50:42] then God enlightened his eyes and he can
[50:45] see clearly what was not and that
[50:51] captain convinced his commanding officer
[50:53] they go up and that was the same I don't
[50:58] think they even realized it that was the
[51:02] same pathway and they defeated the Turks
[51:05] and that was the beginning of the end of
[51:08] the Turkish Empire and the beginning of
[51:11] the end of Israel becoming beginning of
[51:16] the beginning of Israel becoming a
[51:18] nation God didn't do anything by
[51:21] accident but we know that Israel Israel
[51:32] was always backsliding so the Prophet
[51:36] bring him back to the Prophet bring
[51:37] about always backsliding even him you
[51:41] can read in Matthew chapter 27 where
[51:44] when Jesus stood before Pilate and his
[51:49] wife came to Pilate said I've suffered
[51:52] so much in dreams don't do anything to
[51:56] this man Jesus and Pilate said I cannot
[51:59] find no fault in him but the elders the
[52:06] chief priests they convinced the people
[52:10] to free Barabbas
[52:12] and crucify Jesus and they
[52:19] said crucify heal and let his blood be
[52:26] upon us and by children our children
[52:30] that's why the Holocaust happened
[52:34] that's why Israel was scattered out to
[52:37] every nation has suffered under the
[52:38] Russian Empire suffered under this
[52:41] Empire and has suffered under that
[52:43] Empire now we know they're coming back
[52:46] they have came back Israel became a
[52:49] nation in 1948 you know the prophet of
[52:52] God said here's where became a nation in
[52:53] 1946 the same day he got his commission
[52:56] from the Ange of the Lord you know he
[52:58] said that he already said history since
[52:59] 1948
[53:00] is that a contradiction you know what
[53:03] Perry Greene said that man carried the
[53:06] papers in his pocket for two years
[53:10] brother Branham was not wrong men may
[53:14] think he was wrong I don't understand
[53:18] everything the mess he says but I
[53:19] believe every word of it I wouldn't deny
[53:23] it for nothing I would be denying my
[53:26] heritage as if I denied one word way man
[53:35] see
[53:36] but been said it was the loving hand of
[53:39] God sometimes it looks cruel the way
[53:44] that people suffer but it still it's the
[53:47] tender hand of Jehovah leading his
[53:51] children we thank you Lord now Beulah
[53:59] means a married land
[54:02] married man I'm going to Maryland now it
[54:07] means to rule over or to possess now
[54:15] Israel the most important thing to the
[54:19] Jews is land do ever think about it's
[54:22] the land they're not going to give up
[54:25] any land for a pea not right now they're
[54:28] not going to
[54:30] but we know that Rome is going to make a
[54:32] treaty with the Jews with those Wall
[54:34] Street Jews they got the gold and they
[54:36] want the paper they want the paper money
[54:38] of stocks and bonds they're going to
[54:41] make a treaty with the Jews they'll
[54:45] probably give up some land then but that
[54:48] land is the most important thing God
[54:51] told Abraham what this land was and it
[54:55] was the most important thing to a Jew
[54:58] was the land now to a Bible believing
[55:02] Christian Holy Ghost field it's not land
[55:08] I've got a house with some land but that
[55:12] will perish it's not land but it's
[55:14] spiritual land it's what I gain
[55:17] spiritually that's why God told Joshua
[55:20] where your footsteps step that means
[55:23] possess it everywhere he went
[55:25] that land was theirs you possessed they
[55:28] had to fight forth they possessed that
[55:30] land and I believe today we're not
[55:32] possessing land but worse possessing
[55:34] spiritual land whether it's your
[55:36] children whether it's your husband
[55:38] whether it's your wife where it is you
[55:40] are possessing what God has given you
[55:43] and I think we did we need to go to
[55:45] Satan and demand that God let our love
[55:49] was loosed a man okay
[55:58] now Paul said in second Korean swear I
[56:04] am jealous over you with a godly
[56:05] jealousy for I've espoused you to one
[56:09] husband that I might present you as a
[56:13] chaste virgin to Christ a spouse means
[56:16] to join together betrothed a pure
[56:19] marriage see now we read our script
[56:30] that let me go back and catch this for
[56:36] his a young man marries a virgin so thy
[56:40] sons shall marry thee but here we're
[56:45] seeing the natural seed and the
[56:48] spiritual seed and as the bridegroom
[56:50] rejoices over the bride so shall thy God
[56:55] rejoice over thee he still loves
[57:00] Jerusalem he placed her over to the side
[57:02] he's not finished with her if we're
[57:05] gonna see him in he's not finished with
[57:06] her now did you know did you know the
[57:17] history of the United States and the
[57:19] Revolutionary War
[57:20] did you know your great nation seventeen
[57:25] seventy something during the war against
[57:28] England all was lost they were broke
[57:32] they didn't have a penny but God placed
[57:37] it in the heart of a Jew I got his name
[57:42] here
[57:43] his name was headed Solomon a Polish Jew
[57:51] the son of a rabbi he was first in
[57:54] England and that he come to the United
[57:57] States and they enlisted him and he had
[58:04] a burden he raised he was a Philadelphia
[58:10] banker Jews always knew how to make
[58:13] money okay Jacob how he got those
[58:17] spotted cattle you know and raised
[58:23] $400,000 you imagine what $400,000 was
[58:26] in the 1700s what he'd be worth today
[58:29] not only did that he raised for he did
[58:33] this and he did that and that man died a
[58:36] pauper he didn't want any he didn't want
[58:41] any percentage of any money that he
[58:43] claimed
[58:43] because I believe that he believed
[58:47] United States would be a haven for Jews
[58:51] till they could go back to the homeland
[58:53] that's the reason why there's still so
[58:55] many here and George Warson and I've got
[59:01] it home somewhere an article he
[59:03] proclaimed that all the children of
[59:06] Abraham was welcomed into United States
[59:10] and did you know George Washington would
[59:13] not bow at the sacrament or kneel oh
[59:16] they said well here Oh something's wrong
[59:19] with that guy he religious but he said
[59:25] one place when he knelt was a slave he
[59:28] said the ground is always level at the
[59:31] cross but he would not kneel at the
[59:34] sacrum I because he did not believe he
[59:40] would not belong to any church that was
[59:43] government established Church like the
[59:46] Church of England now we've got the
[59:47] Episcopal Church your hope there's
[59:49] nobody at no Episcopal is here because
[59:51] my daddy used to call him whisk up a
[59:52] whiskey pelean we'd pull up next to a
[59:57] car I hate out there's no Catholics here
[1:00:00] was but there was little statues on the
[1:00:03] dash and my dad we look over and said
[1:00:06] there's another spook chaser
[1:00:09] he established something in me he was
[1:00:13] planting seed by those little things
[1:00:16] he was planted seed however my dad was
[1:00:19] tall broad-shouldered I remember one
[1:00:22] time but I got me a car my first car was
[1:00:25] a 1954 Chevrolet to tote green it was a
[1:00:30] stick shift and and I finally decided
[1:00:35] that I'm gonna he said go ahead and take
[1:00:39] it I never drove a stick just take it on
[1:00:41] and I was just going wrong on that stick
[1:00:44] shift and I went down and turned the
[1:00:47] corner and all of a sudden this drunk
[1:00:50] came and barreling down the road and
[1:00:53] come so close to hitting me and he got
[1:00:56] out like he would go
[1:00:57] to beat me about just sixteen years old
[1:00:59] and I turned around and looked there was
[1:01:03] my daddy standing like this looking at
[1:01:05] that drunk and that drunk I'm getting
[1:01:09] out of here
[1:01:10] I got a heavenly father when I get in
[1:01:14] trouble he bigger than any devil there
[1:01:17] is he's bigger into the stream he's
[1:01:20] bigger than all and he's always comes to
[1:01:22] me whenever I need him Amen hallelujah
[1:01:26] Amen see thou shalt also be a crown of
[1:01:34] glory in the handle award in a royal
[1:01:38] diadem in the hand of God the Bible says
[1:01:43] he that speaketh of himself seeketh his
[1:01:45] own glory but he that seeketh his glory
[1:01:49] that sent him the same is true and
[1:01:52] there's no unrighteousness in him the
[1:01:58] bride goes wherever the bridegroom is
[1:02:03] and she will never be left by him she
[1:02:07] will never leave his side she will share
[1:02:09] his throne with him she will be crowned
[1:02:12] with his glory and we are the crowning
[1:02:16] of his glory
[1:02:17] the gildo prophet of God one day we're
[1:02:20] gonna sing that he said that
[1:02:21] Baccalaureate song will all hail the
[1:02:23] power in Jesus name let angels prostrate
[1:02:28] fall bring forth the royal diadem and
[1:02:34] crown him Lord of all hey he's at the
[1:02:39] back Lloyd song we're gonna bring it and
[1:02:44] we're gonna crown him but he not only
[1:02:46] said that he gonna put a crown on our
[1:02:49] heads that's what he said
[1:02:51] you're gonna put a crown on us I ain't
[1:02:53] worthy of that crap but one thing nobody
[1:02:56] gonna be able to take that crown away
[1:02:57] from me and no devil gonna take that
[1:03:00] crown because it's eternal and it's
[1:03:02] given to me I'm wearing it as though
[1:03:04] I've already got it in my heart
[1:03:06] a man I'm sharing the glory of the Lord
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ now a mahan joint heirs
[1:03:15] with Jesus Christ in heavenly places
[1:03:17] that's my position and think about it
[1:03:20] that's peace that's your position but
[1:03:24] you know let the peace of God rule and
[1:03:29] reign in your heart you know let it rain
[1:03:34] it'll keep your heart and mine Christ
[1:03:36] cheats I'm established but sometimes the
[1:03:41] devil tries to take my peace and he
[1:03:45] doesn't where I'm in turmoil and I don't
[1:03:49] know what to do and that's when
[1:03:51] sometimes we need each other we can't
[1:03:55] fight the battle alone because if you
[1:03:58] take oh my come here both of you right
[1:04:02] here stand up here I like to demonstrate
[1:04:06] okay may take your hand all right this
[1:04:10] is much stronger now by myself he can he
[1:04:14] can he can probably get me but I got
[1:04:16] this threefold strength right here he
[1:04:18] ain't going to hell he's he's he kind of
[1:04:20] defenseless then a man their strength
[1:04:23] and numbers their strength and when the
[1:04:27] brighter Jesus Christ will come together
[1:04:29] the pillar of fire will appear again in
[1:04:33] the service hey man hey man glory
[1:04:38] hallelujah now the Lord said to aid them
[1:04:45] I will make you a great nation and I
[1:04:50] will bless you and make her name gray
[1:04:53] and you shall be an a blessing and I
[1:04:57] will bless those who bless you Genesis
[1:05:00] chapter 12 I believe this you may
[1:05:05] disagree but I voted for Donald Trump
[1:05:09] I was raised my daddy was a Democrat to
[1:05:14] start with but many years ago he
[1:05:17] converted to be a Republican
[1:05:20] the only time he back slid was with
[1:05:24] Jimmy Carter you ever know Jimmy Carter
[1:05:28] Jimmy Carter claimed to be a Southern
[1:05:30] Baptist and we found out he was a wine
[1:05:33] drinking Southern Baptists you know that
[1:05:36] and I remember at my house and my dad
[1:05:40] was complaining about Jimmy Carter and
[1:05:42] my mother said well you bloated for him
[1:05:47] he Baxley had been but I was raised to
[1:05:51] vote and I voted for Trump and I think I
[1:05:54] think God will bless him because he put
[1:05:56] the American Embassy back in Jerusalem
[1:05:59] other presidents had claimed to do it
[1:06:02] Reagan did Clinton did Kennedy did Nixon
[1:06:06] did all of them claim to do it but he is
[1:06:09] the only one that did and he's not a
[1:06:12] politician he's a businessman he he
[1:06:15] ain't a perfect man but I like one but
[1:06:17] once somebody said he's a perfect man
[1:06:19] for the job but he ain't a perfect man
[1:06:20] we know that you can tell by his mouth a
[1:06:24] man I father talk like that my mother
[1:06:27] would she did more than Wharf my mouth
[1:06:30] out with soap

[1:06:43] much I love her my daddy how much I love
[1:06:45] her

[1:06:53] I've got so many quotes I forgot to read
[1:06:56] them oh my now now listen
[1:07:04] Jerusalem is from above we're going to
[1:07:07] read the scripture which is the mother
[1:07:11] of us all did you know brother Brendan
[1:07:13] said God is your mother he's my father
[1:07:18] it's my mother ain't my brother and he's
[1:07:21] my sister he's everything to me that's
[1:07:23] all one wrong see see New Jerusalem
[1:07:29] you know they got Methodist headquarters
[1:07:31] Catholics and all this different places
[1:07:33] we have our headquarters it's not in
[1:07:35] Jeffersonville Indiana it's not in
[1:07:38] Arizona no it may be this big church but
[1:07:40] Jews rule in but the Bible says
[1:07:42] Jerusalem is from above which is the
[1:07:44] mother of us all a man now Christ is in
[1:07:51] heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem
[1:07:59] he said this in 864 this is God created
[1:08:03] the earth in six days made the earth in
[1:08:05] six days or six thousand years they said
[1:08:07] be not ignorant we didn't descriptions
[1:08:09] one thousand years as one day Christ has
[1:08:11] gone in preparing a place that's been on
[1:08:13] construction for many many thousands of
[1:08:16] years preparing a place and if I go to
[1:08:18] prepare a place I will come again and
[1:08:20] receive you that wherever I am there you
[1:08:22] may be also notice the Redeemer and the
[1:08:25] redeemed your body was justified under
[1:08:29] Noah's baptism and your flesh when it
[1:08:34] dropped over there and the earth is to
[1:08:36] be cleansed by fire the place where you
[1:08:39] live the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:08:43] dwelling place for Christ and his bride
[1:08:45] the New Jerusalem but first first John
[1:08:49] chapter five it says for there are three
[1:08:52] that bear record in heaven the father
[1:08:55] the word and the Holy Ghost and these
[1:08:58] three are one and there's three that
[1:09:01] bear witness on earth the spirit water
[1:09:05] blood and these three agree and what do
[1:09:08] they agree in the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:09] Ghost amen if you're going to dwell in
[1:09:13] New Jerusalem which is above you've got
[1:09:15] to have the baptism below
[1:09:17] you've got to have the token what we
[1:09:19] talked about last night you know I
[1:09:21] forgot to put this in last night I can
[1:09:23] add this can I got plenty of time you
[1:09:26] know when I was growing up my mother
[1:09:30] away only had one driver in the home my
[1:09:32] mother didn't drive at that time she
[1:09:33] finally got a driver's license later I
[1:09:35] was a little boy and the bus would come
[1:09:39] by in front of the house and we'd have
[1:09:42] to kiss that bus and I don't think my
[1:09:45] mother used she yours token
[1:09:47] and that token was only good for the bus
[1:09:51] and when I was in New York a few years
[1:09:54] ago I preached in several churches in
[1:09:55] New York and we rode the subway and the
[1:09:59] sister took us and she bought some tick
[1:10:02] she went to a little places and bought
[1:10:05] tokens to get on that subway that's the
[1:10:09] only way we could get on it it was only
[1:10:13] good for the subway
[1:10:14] my mother token was only good for the
[1:10:16] bus the Holy Ghost is God and it's good
[1:10:21] for you eternal life and it's not good
[1:10:23] for the world it's not good for anything
[1:10:25] else it's God in you the hope of glory
[1:10:28] amen you must have a baptism of holy go
[1:10:33] if you're going to dwell in the New
[1:10:35] Jerusalem which is above a man a man now
[1:10:41] oh I now my land shall no more be called
[1:10:50] desolate the land is blooming years ago
[1:10:54] it was a bunch of deserts now if you go
[1:10:56] they've irrigated it they say that it's
[1:10:58] a beautiful place when it was just a
[1:11:00] bunch of desert it was dying but see it
[1:11:05] would no longer be desolate it did you
[1:11:10] know in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War
[1:11:16] when the Israel when the Arab nations
[1:11:19] come against Israel again and go to Myer
[1:11:24] was prime minister at the time all was
[1:11:29] lost and then it was lost Israel was
[1:11:33] going to fall and she carried a cyanide
[1:11:36] pill around with her if she would be
[1:11:39] taken by the enemy she would kill
[1:11:42] herself
[1:11:43] she would not be
[1:11:48] so she decided to call the white house
[1:11:55] and she got ahold of Henry Kissinger
[1:12:00] Secretary of State under Nixon which was
[1:12:03] a Hungarian Jew and Henry Kissinger said
[1:12:08] let the Jews burn a while so she waited
[1:12:13] awhile and she called again and she got
[1:12:15] a hold of President Richard Nixon this
[1:12:17] was at the time of Watergate when he was
[1:12:19] in trouble and you know brother
[1:12:21] management said I met the man he said
[1:12:24] he's a lovely vice president and he said
[1:12:26] I like the man Richard Nixon was in the
[1:12:29] meetings when the deep call it too deep
[1:12:30] in Washington DC
[1:12:32] Richard Nick brother branham said I set
[1:12:34] next to Richard Nixon dinner prayer
[1:12:36] breakfast and we talked she got a hold
[1:12:42] of because when Richard Nixon was a
[1:12:46] little boy his mother was a fundamental
[1:12:53] Quaker see there's two types of Quakers
[1:12:56] even today she was a fundamental Quaker
[1:13:00] and she told her son Richard she said
[1:13:05] Richard one of these days you're going
[1:13:11] to be in a position and the Jews will be
[1:13:15] in trouble and when they're in trouble
[1:13:20] you help them and when go to Meyer begin
[1:13:27] to speak to Richard Nixon he said it was
[1:13:29] like my mother talking to me and you
[1:13:33] know what he did he wrote her and he
[1:13:36] Richard Nixon was supposed to be an anti
[1:13:37] semantics that was the pub that was for
[1:13:40] public saying that he wrote her a blank
[1:13:44] check sent this and sent that and Israel
[1:13:49] was saved because of a prophecy of a
[1:13:53] mother to her son and that Watergate and
[1:13:57] you know Watergate was not the reason he
[1:14:00] left for
[1:14:01] that water the reason he left because he
[1:14:03] knew when he did that everybody was
[1:14:06] against Israel at that time and he would
[1:14:08] be gone and that's the reason he had to
[1:14:10] leave the office truth is not always
[1:14:13] true that you hear in the news media
[1:14:15] most the time is a bunch of lies
[1:14:18] and I believe there's a place for
[1:14:21] Richard Nixon
[1:14:23] he saved the nation of Israel and I hear
[1:14:27] people would mock him and talk about
[1:14:29] Messi's people I don't do in front of me
[1:14:31] I know what the problem God said about
[1:14:33] he said the lovely vice president he
[1:14:37] knew something don't you think
[1:14:39] sitting there steaming up or breakfast
[1:14:42] communicating with president Nick don't
[1:14:44] you think he knew something that's
[1:14:51] history I'm gonna give you another
[1:14:55] history lesson how many has ever read
[1:14:57] the fifty years in the Church of Rome by
[1:15:00] Charles technically you read it you know
[1:15:03] why Abraham Lincoln was killed it was
[1:15:06] the Jesuit Order of the Roman Catholic
[1:15:08] Church guilty why because he had a
[1:15:14] revelation of Jesus Christ and a
[1:15:17] revelation of that great cloud hanging
[1:15:20] over the United States was Rome he was
[1:15:25] warned by mr. Morse the Morse code and
[1:15:30] Charles technically that they were going
[1:15:33] to kill him
[1:15:34] but he said I know God has for God has
[1:15:37] spared my life many times but he won't
[1:15:39] always he said I had a dream and in that
[1:15:45] dream
[1:15:45] I guess he was in a casket and he was
[1:15:51] not allowed to go after the Civil War
[1:15:53] he was not allowed to go into the
[1:15:55] Promised Land when Nate United States
[1:15:57] would prosper he knew his life was going
[1:16:00] to be taken that's the history that's
[1:16:05] the history that's the history and did
[1:16:08] you know in Baltimore Maryland but they
[1:16:11] were already celebrating his death
[1:16:12] before he was even killed
[1:16:16] everyone that was everyone that was in a
[1:16:19] line of that that killed him Mary Stuart
[1:16:22] nan were Roman Catholic Jim Stewart of
[1:16:25] the Civil War was Roman Catholic did you
[1:16:28] know that the Roman Catholic Church
[1:16:32] supported the South in the Civil War
[1:16:35] read it all in the 50 years in the
[1:16:38] Church of Rome I say this other than the
[1:16:41] message the Bible and the message of the
[1:16:43] hour the greatest book I've ever read
[1:16:44] was fifty years in the Church of Rome
[1:16:46] while Charles generally that's history
[1:16:50] I'd like to tell history unauthorized
[1:16:53] this where you won't read in the history
[1:16:55] did you know George you won't read this
[1:16:57] I got the books did you all read that
[1:17:00] George Washington had visions but it was
[1:17:04] used to be it used to be in the public
[1:17:07] school system years ago that George
[1:17:10] Washington had visions and it was taken
[1:17:13] out spiritual man that's why brother BAM

[1:17:55] removed renovated take all the germs and
[1:17:58] everything off of it and in the red of
[1:18:00] his renovation at the end was a fire

[1:18:56] there was no more seat
[1:18:58] ja I John saw the holy city New
[1:19:01] Jerusalem sending from God out of heaven
[1:19:06] in the heavens of the earth is husband
[1:19:10] and wife
[1:19:12] so is Christ in the church they all meet
[1:19:15] in one big glorious plan of redemption
[1:19:18] in his brought right into the bosom of
[1:19:20] God again I like that hey man and a new
[1:19:24] earth there is a new city we're not
[1:19:26] talking about the Millenium now we're
[1:19:28] talking about the newer that's when any
[1:19:32] in the Millenium there is time a
[1:19:34] thousand years but in the new earth
[1:19:36] there is no more time it's eternity amen
[1:19:41] see in my father's house as many
[1:19:46] mansions in my father's Kingdom as many
[1:19:49] palaces Christ is there under
[1:19:52] construction of the New Jerusalem now
[1:19:56] now listen don't move don't miss this
[1:19:59] Christ is in heaven today preparing the
[1:20:01] New Jerusalem just as God created the
[1:20:04] earth in six days may the earth in six
[1:20:07] days of 6,000 years be not ignorant we
[1:20:11] read in the scripture one thousand years
[1:20:14] is one good and Christ is going and
[1:20:16] preparing that place and if I go and
[1:20:20] prepare a place I will come again and
[1:20:22] receive you I finished it I feel like
[1:20:26] I'm in the Philippines right now okay
[1:20:29] amen when I'm in the Philippines
[1:20:33] I see brothers bro over there they got
[1:20:36] ties on and long-sleeve shirts I'd die
[1:20:40] with the tie on in the film
[1:20:42] in a long-sleeve shirt I wear a short
[1:20:45] sleeve shirt and it hangs out I found
[1:20:48] out the brothers told me it's cooler
[1:20:50] that way because I can't stand the heat
[1:20:53] but when I go up God's called me to the
[1:20:56] mountains let me tell you a little storm
[1:20:58] will flow that in there I ain't finished
[1:21:00] yet I'm gonna I'm gonna complete this
[1:21:03] did you know water freezes in tropical
[1:21:06] areas because there's a place called
[1:21:11] Nunn gawah way up in the mountains I've
[1:21:14] been there many times the pastor used to
[1:21:18] beat brother Gabriel he stepped down and
[1:21:20] brother Moses took over I mean what can
[1:21:23] you beat that a man and it was handed
[1:21:27] down from generation to generation just
[1:21:30] like Israel it was handed down from
[1:21:35] generation to generation what tribe they
[1:21:38] were from nobody knew because when Titus
[1:21:41] rim sacked and destroyed the city all
[1:21:46] the records was lost they don't know who
[1:21:48] they are but they go to that Wailing
[1:21:51] Wall and they cried crying cry looking
[1:21:54] for the Messiah that was the message
[1:21:56] that's going to preach this morning we
[1:21:58] won't better not get off on that but
[1:22:00] there was tradition that handed down now
[1:22:03] this brother is only about 38 that the
[1:22:08] water had froze in nan Gowen now I know
[1:22:11] this I preached outside in a crusade I
[1:22:15] had to have him a colon and I wear a
[1:22:18] jacket up there and it was tradition
[1:22:20] handed down well brother Moses said last
[1:22:23] winter around January there was water
[1:22:27] sitting out on the porch and he went out
[1:22:29] and the water was froze so that was just
[1:22:32] not hearsay
[1:22:34] it was something that come to pass and
[1:22:36] that's the reason I like the mountains
[1:22:38] but when I go down to the lowland and
[1:22:41] when I preach looks like I took a bath
[1:22:43] with my clothes
[1:22:50] and it ain't no fun either reckon you
[1:22:52] get finished when you sit down in you're
[1:22:55] dying it's the one of the worst feelings
[1:22:58] in the whole wide world a man now
[1:23:06] but those Jews under the fifth seal yes
[1:23:09] are there now crying how long Lord how
[1:23:14] long will you be
[1:23:16] avenge us he took this rested a little
[1:23:21] while and still you've got some more
[1:23:23] brethren that's going to have to give
[1:23:25] they're like 144,000 yes that's the
[1:23:31] natural seed that's not the bride he put
[1:23:38] it here weighs this was they were
[1:23:42] married to the land but were married to
[1:23:45] Jesus Christ so Beulah land is married
[1:23:50] land to us to Israel it was the land
[1:23:56] Beulah land it's what is ours nobody
[1:24:00] gonna take it away that's the way we
[1:24:02] need to do with our experience with God
[1:24:05] nobody gonna take my witness away I know
[1:24:11] men that's lost their witness I know
[1:24:14] preachers I'm just going to tell you I
[1:24:16] had a brother that I hadn't seen for a
[1:24:19] long time on Facebook so I come I send
[1:24:25] him a B and so on so place I used to
[1:24:27] travel with him I traveled with him one
[1:24:30] time to a military camp where the
[1:24:36] children were all diseased and dying and
[1:24:39] God stayed stop that brother Danner told
[1:24:45] me he believed that the Roman Catholic
[1:24:46] Church had poisoned the waters but he
[1:24:52] said well I'll be
[1:24:53] I'll come you never showed up never
[1:24:54] showed up I found out you know what
[1:24:57] happened he fell from grace by a woman
[1:25:02] it happens
[1:25:05] happens all the time I know places I've
[1:25:09] gone you will not believe that's the
[1:25:13] reason why I ain't never gonna be alone
[1:25:16] because some woman could say something
[1:25:19] about me then I was nearly innocent I am
[1:25:22] never alone
[1:25:24] I'm never alone my testimony his work is
[1:25:30] like gold to me its deity it's good in
[1:25:36] me it's Christ they're there waiting how
[1:25:48] long Lord how long a Bible says in
[1:25:54] Galatians 4:4 this is a gar and Mount
[1:25:57] Sinai in Arabia pertained it to
[1:26:02] Jerusalem which now is is an in bondage
[1:26:05] with her children but droolin which is
[1:26:07] above is free which is the mother of us
[1:26:12] all for as a young man Mary the Virgin
[1:26:18] show thy sons marry the land II we won't
[1:26:24] go into what Romans chapter 11 talks
[1:26:26] about that ollie branch the olive tree
[1:26:34] or Israel was taken out and we were
[1:26:38] grafted in we were grafted in because of
[1:26:43] grace because it was the mercy of God
[1:26:47] when they went when they said let his
[1:26:51] blood be upon us if they had and I have
[1:26:54] said that the gospel would not have came
[1:26:56] to us here was really the grace of God
[1:27:02] but the Bible says don't get puffed up
[1:27:05] don't think you're somebody because the
[1:27:08] same God that took her out can put her
[1:27:14] back in and take you out and that's
[1:27:17] going to happen it's going to happen
[1:27:20] there's going to be a foolish virgin go
[1:27:22] through the tribulation because she
[1:27:24] would not accept the full word of God
[1:27:26] because she would not believe God's Word
[1:27:30] and she'll have to go through the
[1:27:33] tribulation amen
[1:27:38] the Bible says in revelation 19:7
[1:27:42] let us rejoice and be glad glad and
[1:27:45] rejoice and give honour to the king for
[1:27:46] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[1:27:48] his wife I made herself ready I kind of
[1:27:58] long but I've got to read this excuse me
[1:28:01] I'm not been preaching even an hour yes
[1:28:04] it's a Philadelphian Church age he that
[1:28:11] hath the key of David this beautiful
[1:28:15] phrase follows and comes out of the
[1:28:18] preceding phrase he that is true Christ
[1:28:20] the perfect realization contrasted with
[1:28:25] partial realization here it is Moses was
[1:28:28] a prophet of God but Jesus likened the
[1:28:31] Moses was the prophet of God David a man
[1:28:35] after God's own heart was king of Israel
[1:28:37] but Jesus is the greater king king of
[1:28:40] kings and Lord of lords God very God
[1:28:42] now David was born of the tribe of Judah
[1:28:45] and out of the priests he was a great
[1:28:47] warrior coming overcoming the in him
[1:28:50] established and the people as king he
[1:28:51] sat on the throne he was a prophet he
[1:28:53] was a wonderful top of Christ but now in
[1:28:56] Isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of
[1:29:00] David will lay upon his shoulder so he
[1:29:02] shall open and none shall shut he shall
[1:29:06] shut and none shall open the spirit uses
[1:29:11] Old Testament reference concerning the
[1:29:13] Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry and
[1:29:15] it's
[1:29:15] Church what the key of David signifies
[1:29:20] at the time is mere shadow which is now
[1:29:24] fulfilled and Jesus standing in the
[1:29:26] midst of the lamp stands it has to do
[1:29:29] with our Lord after after the
[1:29:31] resurrection not his earthly pilgrimage
[1:29:34] but what he does this key signify their
[1:29:38] answer lies and the position of the key
[1:29:40] I love this it is not his in his hand
[1:29:44] it is not worn around his neck it is
[1:29:48] placed in the hands of the key for a
[1:29:52] loan he opens and shuts and no man has
[1:29:55] the right but Jesus himself isn't that
[1:29:58] right
[1:29:59] but where is the key it is on his
[1:30:02] shoulder but what does the shoulder have
[1:30:06] to do with it read Isaiah 9:6 and the
[1:30:08] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:30:10] what does this mean the answer is this
[1:30:12] the phrase the government upon his
[1:30:13] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:30:15] of the east when the pride the bride is
[1:30:18] committed to the groom and takes off her
[1:30:22] veil and grooms shoulders signifies that
[1:30:26] not only is she under his Dominion that
[1:30:29] she has transferred her rights to him
[1:30:32] that he is the head and also that he
[1:30:35] bears a responsibility in the care that
[1:30:38] he alone and no one else no other man no
[1:30:41] other power has any right and
[1:30:44] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:30:46] key of David God being sovereign he
[1:30:50] foreknew by divine decree exactly who
[1:30:54] would be in his bride he chose her she
[1:30:57] did not choose him he called her she did
[1:31:01] not come on her own he died for her he
[1:31:03] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[1:31:05] price for her she belongs to him unto
[1:31:08] Him alone she is wholly committed to him
[1:31:10] and accepts the obligation he is her
[1:31:13] head for Christ is a head of the church
[1:31:15] as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the
[1:31:19] bride is happy that it he is her Lord he
[1:31:22] speaks and she obeys for that is her
[1:31:27] delight
[1:31:28] what does that hesitant means my delight
[1:31:32] is in her I want you to know the day
[1:31:36] that Jesus delight is in the bride of
[1:31:40] Jesus Christ it's not a denominational
[1:31:43] system it's not in the worldly system
[1:31:46] it's not in a Roman Church a Catholic
[1:31:49] Church or Lutheran Church or Pentecostal
[1:31:51] Church a Baptist Church pilgrim holier
[1:31:53] so whatever is delight it's not in four
[1:31:57] walls his delight is not in Creed's but
[1:32:04] it's as light isn't a personal
[1:32:06] relationship with you in man that is his
[1:32:09] delight that is what He desires if he's
[1:32:14] longing for anything he's longing to
[1:32:17] come to you he is longing to fellowship
[1:32:20] with you and fellowship with me as he
[1:32:22] came down in the cool of the day in the
[1:32:26] garden of he many times he would come
[1:32:30] but one time he came and they were here
[1:32:35] poor Sal Adam he came at Church time
[1:32:43] evening time and where they were here
[1:32:47] why they had sin but God in His mercy
[1:32:54] God is some bloody
[1:32:58] skins they had to leave the garden but
[1:33:03] they had those bloody skins and I like
[1:33:05] it
[1:33:05] Buller Brennan give the illustration
[1:33:07] it's Adam and Eve as walking out the
[1:33:10] garden and that blood is flapping on him
[1:33:13] and he turns around to Adam and says I'm
[1:33:16] sorry it's all my fault it's a quote I'm
[1:33:21] sorry it's all my fault I think that's
[1:33:25] what we need to do once in a while and
[1:33:27] say Lord I'm sorry it's all my fault
[1:33:33] it's all my fault I think we need I need
[1:33:37] I think we ever once why we need a a
[1:33:39] repentance and an altar to get rid of
[1:33:44] our own ideas in our own Creed's because
[1:33:47] we get so magnified with them that we
[1:33:50] think we know more than God sometimes
[1:33:53] God takes me through a valley I don't
[1:33:55] want to go that Valley I'll go this way
[1:33:57] you go that way you're in the permissive
[1:34:01] will of God and you are in big trouble
[1:34:04] like Balaam was amen amen I'm not ready
[1:34:10] to close amen another ha I'm gonna
[1:34:20] repeat it again in future honk why is
[1:34:22] God so thought and cared so much for
[1:34:25] that little place in Palestine but it's
[1:34:29] just a little spot but right in there is
[1:34:33] where the temple is set there's four New
[1:34:37] Jerusalem will break right there Mount
[1:34:41] of Ali's clean to the right and to the
[1:34:43] left and push up from beneath a nigel
[1:34:50] solid lards Jerusalem descending out of
[1:34:53] heaven as a bride adorned for her
[1:34:58] husband amen are we adorned for our
[1:35:05] husband the righteous system not mine
[1:35:09] eyes like filthy rag adorned in his what
[1:35:12] what brother man God God has allowed me
[1:35:15] to clothe that ride in the clothes of
[1:35:21] his work man if he said that I'm gonna
[1:35:26] believe it a man I believe it I fought
[1:35:31] against it for 12 years 12 long years
[1:35:36] you ain't never been on the backside of
[1:35:37] the desert like I have i've been whipped
[1:35:41] i've been whipped and I've been triple
[1:35:44] whipped
[1:35:44] I've been quadruple whipped
[1:35:47] but he did all that to get me to a place
[1:35:53] I would surrender to him
[1:35:55] and you know what I didn't come a minute
[1:35:58] too late I came just on time we're we're
[1:36:04] convinced that a baby comes too early or
