[13:29] don't
[13:31] amen amen let's stand together we'll get
[13:34] right into the word of the
[13:37] lord well it's easy thing to say you
[13:39] folks about preach me to death this
[13:41] morning ain't no doubt about it somebody
[13:44] said are you all right brother Ben can
[13:46] you preach I preach seven Services just
[13:48] like this right here amen it don't
[13:49] bother me a bit little horse don't mean
[13:52] I'm going to stop
[13:54] amen that's the good part being able to
[13:56] give what you got for the Lord Jesus and
[13:59] amen and it's a a good thing to Bear the
[14:01] marks of the service of Christ in your
[14:04] body we may not always get to do them at
[14:08] a steak or being whipped or beat or
[14:10] something like that like it was in the
[14:11] olden days of Christianity amen but we
[14:14] can certainly bear the marks of Christ
[14:17] in our body and our mind and our
[14:19] thoughts and battling the things that we
[14:21] do during the day fighting the devil
[14:22] every time we turn around we'll sure
[14:24] bear some scars along the way don't you
[14:26] think so amen let's uh let's go back to
[14:29] 1 Corinthians chapter 14: 37 and we're
[14:33] going to look tonight at the divine
[14:34] order of the
[14:36] church and we're going to really spend
[14:38] some time the Lord helping us I want to
[14:40] try to labor on why we come and uh what
[14:44] the purpose of church is and so you know
[14:47] we we we know that coming to the house
[14:50] of the Lord is an important thing
[14:52] because Paul told us not to forsake the
[14:54] assembling of ourselves together and he
[14:56] told us even more so as you see the day
[14:59] approaching so the later the hour is
[15:02] supposed to get the more that we're
[15:03] supposed to actually gather together and
[15:06] I think it's amazing that you know
[15:08] there's leadership in this message that
[15:11] absolutely do not believe that we should
[15:13] meet together like we do they think that
[15:15] the better way is stay at home listen to
[15:16] the message of the hour and you know not
[15:19] even come to church and you know I I
[15:22] understand what they're getting at when
[15:23] they say that you know uh uh preachers
[15:26] have caused problems and churches have
[15:28] got problems but Walmart's got problems
[15:31] you know JC Pennies have got problems I
[15:33] I don't stay home I go shopping amen
[15:35] amen when I need something new ain't
[15:37] that right amen so we we should always
[15:39] Endeavor to come to the house of God now
[15:42] 1 Corinthians
[15:46] 14:37 excuse me if any man think himself
[15:49] to be a prophet or
[15:51] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[15:53] things that I write unto
[15:55] you are the Commandments of the Lord I
[15:58] want you to notice this very very
[16:01] carefully Paul is not offering us
[16:05] suggestions this is not an if you think
[16:08] it's okay and if it's acceptable to how
[16:11] you feel about things or you know if
[16:13] everybody at church or School agrees
[16:15] with you this is the Commandment of the
[16:17] Lord but if any man be ignorant let him
[16:20] be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet to
[16:24] prophesy and forbid not to speak with
[16:27] tongues all all things be done decently
[16:31] and in order I like that very much is't
[16:36] that wonderful now you you you think you
[16:39] might know what the word order means
[16:41] here as I did myself but actually order
[16:46] is more than just what we would call an
[16:48] orderly condition or the state of things
[16:51] being in a nice order running order
[16:53] smooth order but this word taxis also
[16:57] means oppos
[16:59] a rank or a position which one holds so
[17:03] let's read it again with that in mind
[17:05] all things be done decently and in the
[17:09] post the rank or the position in which
[17:12] one holds amen so everything in the
[17:15] church is to be done according to what
[17:17] you've been called to do you stay in
[17:19] that calling too whatever God calls you
[17:21] to do stay right in that now I want to
[17:24] read to you from the greatest battle
[17:25] ever fought and brother brandom is out
[17:28] with the brother and he's laying kind of
[17:29] on the ground like and they're sleeping
[17:31] bags and what more and they're talking
[17:32] about the Lord and things and he he's
[17:34] looking up into the stars and he's using
[17:36] the stars is a a place to preach and
[17:40] he's talking about how each star is set
[17:43] in some certain place and how it's in
[17:46] order the way God said it and then he
[17:48] brings it down to Christianity to the
[17:51] elect and he said the whole program of
[17:53] God is upset when one member gets out of
[17:57] order we should continually strive to
[18:02] keep the order of the spirit I think of
[18:05] that for just a moment we should
[18:07] continually strive to keep the order of
[18:10] the spirit in other words we should
[18:12] strive continually to keep doing the
[18:15] thing that God called us to do whatever
[18:18] that is that God wants us to do we do it
[18:21] and then notice this again when one
[18:22] member gets out of order now this is an
[18:24] easy thing for the devil to use on us
[18:26] and say now see there you've made some
[18:29] mistake or you're not exactly living up
[18:31] to par like you think you should you're
[18:33] not walking like you think you should
[18:35] and we all have moments like that in our
[18:37] Christianity and Satan will tell us now
[18:39] see there you're out of order not true
[18:42] when a person is being just a regular
[18:44] good oldfashioned human and they're
[18:46] doing human stuff as long as you're
[18:48] repenting and you're trying to stay
[18:50] within the thing that God called you to
[18:51] do you are still in God's eyes still in
[18:54] order am but it's only when you refuse
[18:57] to do what you know you're supposed to
[18:58] supposed to be doing and you neglect
[19:01] that purpose in your life whatever God
[19:02] called you to do or whatever he placed
[19:04] you in and you neglect that it's going
[19:07] to put you in a state of disorder and in
[19:09] that condition brother B talked about
[19:12] the sins of Believers and things like
[19:15] that he said could knock someone out of
[19:17] getting healed at the platform when
[19:18] things start getting out of order in
[19:20] that way that's why the Lord wants us to
[19:24] maintain continually strive for the
[19:27] order of the spirit is that beautiful
[19:29] just such powerful words let's let's
[19:31] pray over it all can we lord Jesus we
[19:35] thank you so much Lord to come back into
[19:38] this place this uh getting toward the
[19:40] evening time in the night coming down
[19:43] lord where you spoke to Adam and Eve in
[19:46] the cool of the even of the evening time
[19:49] now as the sun's going down may you
[19:52] father once again may you come into this
[19:54] place speak to us in the cool of the
[19:57] evening may you take your word and may
[19:59] you so minister to our hearts that Lord
[20:02] we'll be able to walk out of here
[20:04] understanding the deeper side of what it
[20:06] is that we are to be as your children
[20:09] whether it be a post or a rank or
[20:11] position or whatever you've given us
[20:13] help us to find that place stay in that
[20:15] place and fulfill exactly whatever order
[20:18] you've placed in our hearts we want to
[20:20] commit these things to you Lord in the
[20:22] name of Jesus Christ asking you to
[20:24] anoint me them everything around us Lord
[20:27] may it be anointed for the glory of God
[20:29] whatever little purpose or plan or
[20:31] whatever you'd have for tonight we yield
[20:33] oursel to thy presence in the name of
[20:36] Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you
[20:39] you may be seated amen and amen we love
[20:42] the Lord he's so good to us amen oh he's
[20:45] so good to us now looking at this I I I
[20:48] I want to really focus upon leadership
[20:52] starting out I want to kind of really
[20:54] lean heavy on the ministry side of this
[20:57] and then we're going to bring it down
[20:58] down to the congregation but I want to
[21:00] start right at the top and thankfully I
[21:02] can uh save a little time for all of us
[21:04] tonight because we covered some of it
[21:06] this morning with the star of the age
[21:08] knowing that the star is the one that
[21:10] gets the message and then the messenger
[21:13] takes that message preaches it out there
[21:15] and then those that have ears to hear
[21:18] that are gifted man and woman then they
[21:20] can take that message and receive it
[21:22] under their hearts men that are called
[21:24] to preach and Housewives mothers and
[21:26] whatever more that are called to rece
[21:28] receive and put in action school kids
[21:30] and whatever they might be uh uh uh
[21:33] widows according to the Bible I'm
[21:35] talking about scriptural widows and uh
[21:37] painters and Factory workers and you
[21:39] name them once that message has been
[21:41] delivered then all of us have a Divine
[21:44] place within that message God don't send
[21:47] the message out unless the reciprocal
[21:50] part is you finding a position that God
[21:53] thought of you as being in and then you
[21:55] getting in that place according to God's
[21:57] desire and staying in that amen until
[22:01] all of the whole Army of God is put
[22:03] together fitly joined no Schism in that
[22:06] body amen ready to come amen ready to go
[22:09] in the Rapture resurrection and ready
[22:11] for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:14] so in that regard amen every one of us
[22:17] have a rank or position in which God
[22:20] wants us to be able to uh find not only
[22:24] that position by the Holy Spirit but
[22:26] stay in that position as well I can't
[22:28] can't stress enough how many times it is
[22:30] that God will reveal something to
[22:32] someone and rather than stay in that
[22:35] amen they try to find little wiggle
[22:36] rooms and wiggle holes and loopholes and
[22:38] wiggle tails and wiggle wiggle wiggle PL
[22:40] out of what God called him to do amen
[22:43] and we don't want to be wigglers amen We
[22:45] Want to Hold Steady amen under the grace
[22:47] of God that has been given to us to do
[22:50] what we've been called to do and then
[22:52] touching back upon this in 1 Corinthians
[22:54] Paul is speaking to not only those that
[22:58] are prophets remember a prophet is a new
[23:00] testament preacher we know that as well
[23:02] amen so this encompasses all of the
[23:04] ministry but to those that consider
[23:07] themselves to be spiritual as well there
[23:09] are many that would consider themselves
[23:11] to be spiritual though they don't preach
[23:13] and though they don't uh go out yonder
[23:14] and travel and things and maybe go to
[23:16] the mission field or something like that
[23:18] but they would consider themselves to be
[23:20] spiritual people well Paul said if that
[23:23] be the case if you're a spiritual or a
[23:26] prophet Amen in any way whatsoever you
[23:29] are must acknowledge what I wrote was
[23:31] the Commandment of the Lord amen and as
[23:33] brother Jesse and I was talking for in
[23:35] Fellowship here after church the Holy
[23:37] Spirit dropped a little nugget on us and
[23:39] I never thought of it he never thought
[23:40] of it amen but for those this morning of
[23:43] course preaching on this this morning's
[23:45] message about you know them thinking
[23:47] that Paul wanted to do do away with the
[23:49] prophets how in the world could he do
[23:51] away with the prophetic when he himself
[23:53] was a prophet amen never thought of it
[23:55] like that until the holy spirit let us
[23:57] catch that amen in Fellowship this
[23:59] afternoon but why would Paul do away
[24:01] with the prophets when he himself was a
[24:03] prophet amen the word of the Lord came
[24:05] unto Paul so he's not going to do away
[24:07] with himself surely no amen he did not
[24:10] deny if you'll notice that there was
[24:12] prophets in the land he did not deny
[24:15] that there were other spiritual people
[24:17] in the land other than him but what Paul
[24:20] said was if that man or woman or whoever
[24:22] they are thinks himself to be spiritual
[24:25] or a prophet let that person ever who
[24:28] they are are acknowledge what I've wrote
[24:30] right here is the Commandment of the
[24:32] Lord amen so these are not
[24:35] suggestions these are not just maybe if
[24:38] you feel like it kind of sort of down
[24:39] the road if the mood strikes you and
[24:41] everything feels right this is a
[24:43] commandment of the Lord amen he starts
[24:46] out if any man be ignorant let him be
[24:49] ignorant telling the people to covet to
[24:51] prophesy but forbid not to speak with
[24:53] tongues let everything be done decently
[24:55] and in the position the rank or the
[24:58] position that someone holds now if
[25:00] you'll notice the group that he's
[25:01] talking to here he is talking to the
[25:03] Corinthian Bunch now I I I know that
[25:06] many times when we preach about this
[25:08] Corinthian Church we have a tendency to
[25:11] really kind of push him in a corner and
[25:13] be in this bad misbehaved group of
[25:15] people and they're all mixed up in Every
[25:17] Which Way But I want to show you by the
[25:19] help of the Lord tonight why they were
[25:21] the way they were and let me start by
[25:24] saying to you that the Ephesians the
[25:26] Galatians the Philippians the Lans the
[25:29] Romans and all the rest of these people
[25:31] they had their problems exactly like the
[25:34] Corinthian Church did amen all you have
[25:36] to do is just pick up Ephesians chapter
[25:38] one Paul starts out to the Saints he
[25:40] greets them tells them they're in
[25:42] Heavenly places talks about their birth
[25:44] amen and he's not hardly into the into
[25:47] the beginnings of chapter two and three
[25:49] and four and five and six all the way
[25:51] through the rest of it is nothing more
[25:53] than Paul admonishing them amen love one
[25:56] another don't have grudges don't be
[25:58] jealous fathers don't provoke your kids
[26:01] to wrath husbands love your wives wife
[26:03] loves your husband amen and the whole
[26:05] family of God be fitly joined amen
[26:07] together in the in the unity of the
[26:09] spirit amen so Paul dealt with these
[26:12] people in the Ephesus Church amen the
[26:14] same way he dealt with the Galatians old
[26:17] foolish Galatians who have Bewitched you
[26:19] amen and tried to turn you from the
[26:21] doctrine that was once delivered and
[26:24] already delivered amen if ye would than
[26:27] yourself amen a a spiritual man or ye
[26:30] would think yourself a prophet of some
[26:32] sort he said I want you to know that if
[26:34] me or an angel preached anything
[26:37] contrary to that which has been
[26:39] delivered let that man or that person be
[26:41] a cursed amen so Paul was dealing with
[26:44] all of these churches the Romans just go
[26:46] through the Romans and look at their
[26:47] troubles look down through the thessen
[26:49] Lans they all had issues they all had
[26:51] problems amen but the difference between
[26:54] them and the Corinthian Church was if
[26:57] you look in the Ephesian church just for
[26:59] example amen they had all the gifts of
[27:01] the Spirit they had all of the workings
[27:03] of the Holy Spirit among them amen they
[27:05] had pastors they had teachers
[27:07] evangelists prophets Apostles they had
[27:09] everything in order the way it was
[27:11] supposed to be amen and those people in
[27:14] the Ephesus Church age amen they had
[27:17] preachers to straighten them out and get
[27:20] them right amen leadership was the
[27:22] primary thing that kept him running in
[27:25] the right direction but when you come to
[27:26] these poor old Corinthians right here
[27:28] they didn't have pastors and preachers
[27:30] like that right brother right we know
[27:32] that's true amen because when we open up
[27:35] the chapter Paul said it been heard from
[27:37] the house of Facebook I mean the house
[27:39] of Khloe amen that a man had lived with
[27:42] his father's wife amen now watch Paul
[27:45] did not un christianize this man he did
[27:48] not throw him in hell he did not say he
[27:50] was an off off scow or reprobate of some
[27:53] sort amen but he said uh me being absent
[27:56] I've already judged it in the Spirit he
[27:58] said that you should turn this one over
[28:01] to the devil for the destruction of the
[28:03] flesh but the saving of the Soul you
[28:05] know what's so amazing about that to me
[28:07] amen is that church discipline of that
[28:09] nature has been put in such a manner to
[28:12] where that the least little thing that
[28:14] people have done through the years amen
[28:16] they've been turned over to the devil
[28:17] amen they don't want to obey the pastor
[28:19] in certain things some Deacon gets upset
[28:22] amen and calls them down on something
[28:23] and they have a little bit of war in the
[28:25] church and at one time there were
[28:27] pastors that were were bold enough just
[28:28] to go in there and turn them all over to
[28:30] the devil amen and leave it at that but
[28:32] when you look at when Paul be to turn
[28:35] this man over to the devil the reason he
[28:37] done it was because there was no
[28:39] leadership in that church among those
[28:42] people that could set a standard of what
[28:44] living right repentance or anything else
[28:47] look like amen so Paul knew if I don't
[28:50] set the stage and and provide an example
[28:53] of how discipline works in the house of
[28:55] God Amen how many more fathers lives are
[28:58] these men going to be living with amen
[29:00] so Paul set this man out there as a
[29:03] model or an example to a group of
[29:05] leaderless people that didn't know which
[29:07] way it was up down or anywhere else stay
[29:09] with me a little while amen remember
[29:11] this very same group right here amen
[29:14] they turn right around and they are
[29:16] coming to the communion table can you
[29:17] imagine coming to the table to take the
[29:19] supper of the Lord amen and getting
[29:21] drunk at the Lord's table amen one is
[29:24] Apollo one is Paul one is this one is
[29:27] that one had a Psalm one had a tongue
[29:29] one had a hymn one had this one had that
[29:32] they were the mixed upst bunch of people
[29:34] you've ever seen in your life amen why
[29:37] they did not have pastors preachers and
[29:40] leaders equipped to deal with the
[29:42] challenge of those Corinthian
[29:44] people had they had had good leaders
[29:47] you'd have been reading about them the
[29:48] same as you would the Ephesians that's
[29:50] right had there been good preachers in
[29:52] place you'd have had the same
[29:54] circumstance out of them as you would
[29:55] have had amen the Philippines uh uh uh
[29:58] not the Philippines but the Philippians
[30:00] I mean amen out of the uh the Philippian
[30:02] church I'm trying to say Amen as you
[30:04] would have had in the Corinthian Bunch
[30:06] should have been the same on the other
[30:07] side Amen in other words the leadership
[30:10] amen was not able to bring the people
[30:13] into an understanding of their position
[30:16] their order and how God wanted them to
[30:18] behave in the house of God it wasn't
[30:20] whether or not they love Jesus it wasn't
[30:22] a matter whether they were saved or born
[30:24] again but many of these people did not
[30:27] they lack the instruction that they
[30:29] needed to know how to serve God it was
[30:33] their behavior in the house of God
[30:35] that's exactly what it was amen now uh
[30:39] looking at this let's turn now to 1
[30:41] Timothy chapter 4 I want to pick up
[30:43] verse 11 12 and
[30:46] 13 and while you're turning there listen
[30:48] this in the message leadership brother B
[30:50] said the first steps that any of us ever
[30:52] made somebody led
[30:55] us we have to be led
[31:01] people don't want to be led anymore
[31:03] right they don't want somebody get in
[31:05] their business and telling them how to
[31:06] do
[31:07] things sir if you listen to me close the
[31:10] real bride of Christ wants leadership
[31:14] amen yes sir she wants leadership in the
[31:18] pull pit she wants leadership in the
[31:20] home they want leadership in school
[31:22] wherever they can go they want proper
[31:25] leadership to lead them into the right
[31:27] things now
[31:28] want you look at this relationship on
[31:30] the other side of this now we've talked
[31:31] about the preachers for just a little
[31:33] bit let's flip the coin over a little
[31:34] bit and talk about y'all first cor uh 1
[31:37] Timothy rather chapter 4:1 now watch
[31:39] Paul going right back into it these
[31:41] things command and
[31:44] teach pretty powerful language he's not
[31:47] just referring back to these things or
[31:49] suggestions or ideas this is a part of
[31:53] my suggestion box in the church and I
[31:54] pulled out the first comment card and so
[31:56] I'm going to read that it's a good thing
[31:58] pastors don't have suggestion boxes in
[32:00] their churches you matter what a mess it
[32:02] be one brother said to me one time he
[32:04] said we do have suggestion boxes it's
[32:06] called email text message telephone amen
[32:09] I said that's probably about right amen
[32:11] but a leader amen must not only command
[32:16] but and teach this but a man that is in
[32:19] leadership a leadership position a man
[32:21] that is following the spirit of God Amen
[32:25] has to also understand how this works
[32:27] right here here
[32:29] because no matter how gifted I might
[32:32] be God May vest every gift there is in
[32:35] the body in me if ain't nobody to serve
[32:38] and there ain't nobody that I can be in
[32:40] service to what good is I have all of
[32:42] that in me if there's nobody I can help
[32:45] amen it'd be like having a bank account
[32:47] full of money and not one person with a
[32:49] bank account number to claim it you can
[32:52] have all of that stored up in the bank
[32:54] amen like when I was a kid you could be
[32:55] like Scrooge McDuck and swim through
[32:57] your money amen you can have so much of
[33:00] it amen it be coming out of your ears as
[33:01] we say down south but if there's no one
[33:05] that has a claim to it it doesn't do any
[33:07] good so the idea is not oh look at the
[33:11] ministry of God how gifted they might be
[33:14] that's true there's many of them that
[33:15] are so gifted amen they have such
[33:17] abilities that it Wows you to listen at
[33:19] and preach yes I've listened at some
[33:21] brethren in my time amen that I'm
[33:24] telling you just knows how to get to
[33:25] long cut brother they know how to preach
[33:28] and I enjoy them and I listen to them
[33:29] and I feed from them amen and I know
[33:32] that they're God's men but the reason I
[33:35] can benefit from him it's because I'm
[33:37] sitting on the other side listening to
[33:39] it now watch how Paul threads this
[33:42] together look at him there again verse
[33:44] 12 let no man despise thy youth but be
[33:48] thou an example of the Believers in word
[33:51] conversation charity Spirit Faith Purity
[33:54] till I come give attendance to reading
[33:58] exhortation and to
[34:01] uhoh
[34:04] bleep to Doctrine now that scares a lot
[34:08] of people because the idea many times is
[34:11] that only the ministry can deal with
[34:13] Doctrine right absolutely
[34:16] incorrect the congregation also needs to
[34:20] understand
[34:21] Doctrine I figured some of y'all get a
[34:23] little quiet on me about this because
[34:25] we've got that idea that preachers have
[34:27] have some kind of elevated Revelation
[34:29] above everybody else who told you that
[34:32] lie who deceived you to believe such
[34:34] foolishness as that preachers do not
[34:37] have a superior
[34:40] Revelation amen R into The Sweet Spot
[34:43] already we're in the middle of the honey
[34:46] might as well get good and sticky while
[34:47] we're
[34:48] here now what I want you to understand
[34:50] is that the gift in a preacher's life is
[34:53] not designed to go into a higher realm
[34:57] than what you can go it's not designed
[35:00] to see things beyond what the leoty can
[35:02] see let me liken it this way brother man
[35:05] talked about the Bible being like a
[35:07] puzzle see the way that it works is that
[35:11] all of us and I mean all of us with our
[35:13] Bible open our heart open our our our
[35:16] our lives invested in the message of the
[35:18] hour we all have our puzzle pieces on
[35:21] the table so to speak and all of us are
[35:24] working them puzzle pieces according to
[35:26] the grace and the knowledge of Jesus
[35:29] Christ all of us are working it out if
[35:32] you understand anything at all God does
[35:36] not discriminate based upon your gender
[35:39] or the color of your skin or how much
[35:42] money you got in the bank account or
[35:43] what church you go to or who your pastor
[35:45] might be or what your family's last name
[35:48] is flesh and blood does not reveal these
[35:51] things amen but my Father which is in
[35:54] heaven somebody say Amen this does not
[35:57] come because of who you are it comes
[36:00] because God selects to show you and
[36:02] chooses to reveal to you the things that
[36:05] you have in your life now many of you
[36:08] sitting there women included can
[36:11] understand every Doctrine in the
[36:14] Bible I'm gonna let that one soak bone
[36:16] deep for just a minute because we got a
[36:19] lot of men that ain't nothing more
[36:20] nothing less than chauvinist
[36:23] pigs they are nothing but a bunch of
[36:25] chauvinist women hating people right
[36:28] does they treat sisters like second
[36:29] class citizens that can't have a
[36:31] revelation about nothing that's right
[36:34] but that is not true a woman can have
[36:37] every Revelation that anyone on this
[36:39] Earth can have Revelation is not limited
[36:43] to whether you're a male or you're a
[36:44] female that's right there's not a female
[36:46] Bible and then a male Bible there's not
[36:49] female doctrines and male doctrines sir
[36:52] yes sir you're getting quiet on me but
[36:53] I'm coming anyways amen there is not any
[36:56] kind of gender than even Paul said in
[36:58] the body of Christ is neither male nor
[37:01] female God does not reveal based on well
[37:04] he's a man he can knows more I know
[37:06] where you're heading already but brother
[37:08] Ben brother Bram said a woman is a
[37:10] million times easier to deceive than a
[37:12] man deceive we're not talking about
[37:13] deception we're talking about Revelation
[37:15] amen yes sir this ain't got nothing to
[37:18] do with deception we're talking about
[37:20] Revelation Revelation by The Spirit Well
[37:22] but she's the weaker vessel oh oh I see
[37:25] so God is a respector of persons then
[37:29] so because you're the weaker vessel he
[37:30] chooses to S leave a set of Revelation
[37:33] for the men and then reserves a special
[37:35] dumb down lower class version of
[37:37] Revelation to you
[37:39] sisters no God don't do things like that
[37:42] but what we can understand is that when
[37:44] he called the woman a weaker vessel it
[37:46] wasn't a put down it wasn't God
[37:49] diminishing Your Role or your rank or
[37:51] your position in Christ all he was doing
[37:53] was warning us stupid men don't try to
[37:56] treat that woman the same as
[37:59] yourself that's right understand God
[38:02] made her different in the way she feels
[38:04] and the way she behaves but that's
[38:06] talking about the natural we're not
[38:08] talking about the spiritual Amen in the
[38:11] spiritual realm a woman can have every
[38:13] revelation of mank can well my God
[38:15] there's many sisters in this church and
[38:17] I figure y'all be having Pentecost right
[38:18] about now woo come on sis get your mouth
[38:21] open
[38:22] amen right this is your time to shine
[38:25] I'm giving you all the information and
[38:26] the ammunition
[38:28] amen remember that a woman can have
[38:30] every single Revelation a man can you
[38:32] can understand the godhead you can
[38:34] understand baptism you can understand uh
[38:37] amen serpent seed the Thunders the seals
[38:39] every Revelation that's out there you
[38:41] can understand it amen and God does not
[38:45] hold it back nor reserve it because
[38:47] you're a
[38:48] woman all of us are working our
[38:52] puzzle now have you ever come to a spot
[38:55] in something that you're studying or
[38:57] looking looking at you just can't figure
[38:59] it out how it all puts together I like
[39:02] to work puzzles I've told you this
[39:04] before my granny my dad's mom was a
[39:06] puzzle lover and I am too now my wife
[39:11] you know she hates a puzzle with a
[39:14] passion I I I think it goes like this
[39:16] the devil and then a puzzle I think
[39:17] that's the way it goes but I don't know
[39:19] I've almost cons kind of convinced her
[39:21] to like him a little bit you know she
[39:23] said no way see see what I'm talking
[39:25] about right there amen I tried but you
[39:28] can see the immediate response no way
[39:30] Jose right now under no circumstances do
[39:34] I ever work a puzzle without putting
[39:36] that box in front of me to see what I'm
[39:38] working by and I never try to put any
[39:41] Doctrine together unless I keep my
[39:43] picture right here before me right the
[39:46] picture is the word of God that we work
[39:49] off of what we see in the Bible am and
[39:51] work out these quotes and these ideas
[39:53] and these thoughts and these things
[39:55] according to what we know in the
[39:56] scripture here's the difference between
[39:58] lay people and a preacher I'm working my
[40:01] puzzle too there are things that I don't
[40:03] understand in the word as well but one
[40:05] day I'm sitting in the study and I'm
[40:08] turning this piece this way and that
[40:10] away and I'm trying to find out the way
[40:11] it goes and I've tried to fit it in
[40:13] there a 100 times I Know It Don't Fit
[40:15] and all of a sudden the holy spirit says
[40:17] turn it this away and so I'll take it
[40:19] and turn it that way and Boop it pops
[40:21] right into the spot well then I can be
[40:23] excited and thrilled and be enthused
[40:26] about what God showed told me because
[40:28] now I can come to the platform and say
[40:31] all you dear puzzle workers all you
[40:33] sainted puzzle workers that's been
[40:34] turning this way try it this way and see
[40:37] if it fits it's not that I have a
[40:39] superior Revelation but the gifting of
[40:42] the Lord would allow me to put the
[40:45] things in proper position so you that
[40:48] don't understand maybe how certain
[40:49] things would fit I can guide you in
[40:52] Revelation about how it fits together in
[40:54] the scripture cuz remember you don't
[40:57] need need a preacher to lead you every
[40:59] step of the way when you get saved you
[41:01] can hear the gospel get be preached amen
[41:03] you don't need to understand this thing
[41:05] and that thing and all these Collective
[41:06] Revelations to get saved and receive the
[41:08] Holy Ghost God can deal with your heart
[41:11] you can get born again amen just a
[41:13] simple sermon amen from anybody amen
[41:15] could I I know men and women got saved
[41:17] under women preachers and everything
[41:19] give their heart to God by hearing the
[41:21] gospel preach doesn't matter about the
[41:23] vessel amen but after a person receives
[41:26] the Holy Ghost and becomes a real
[41:28] scriptural puzzle worker they're going
[41:30] to need some men anointed to guide him
[41:33] in how to work their puzzle pieces
[41:36] out this is why I said this morning
[41:38] brother Bram did not have a superior
[41:40] Revelation to everybody else it just so
[41:42] happened he was called of God to be the
[41:45] first one to know how to turn them
[41:47] pieces in what direction they need to be
[41:48] turned so he could tell us how to fit
[41:51] them in there Hallelujah 2,000 years of
[41:53] church history amen there's been a lot
[41:55] of conjecture about the way way things
[41:57] are supposed to look in the scripture
[41:59] you talk about a man that's given a
[42:01] responsibility like brother randam to go
[42:03] in there and have to take all of those
[42:05] years of church history and thread them
[42:07] together and Lace them together with the
[42:09] Bible so that you and I could understand
[42:11] Rapture Resurrection Holiness amen the
[42:14] the original sin the baptism of the Holy
[42:16] Ghost forgiveness of sins the blood of
[42:18] Christ the chemistry the token all these
[42:20] other great things of God Amen no wonder
[42:23] he had to stay focused on the message of
[42:25] the hour yes glory god especially
[42:27] equipped him but notice you are supposed
[42:31] to give attendance to reading
[42:33] exhortation and
[42:36] Doctrine you want to know one reason why
[42:38] you come to church and the preacher does
[42:40] all the work and you don't do nothing
[42:42] because we've been taught the other way
[42:44] around of things we go to church we
[42:47] listen we go to church we hear we go to
[42:50] church he's done you go home but we
[42:54] don't come with the idea many times of
[42:57] being trained that when you come to
[42:59] church you have a contribution to
[43:03] make now here's the beautiful thing
[43:06] about
[43:06] it if let's say brother Jesse is going
[43:09] to bring a sermon you've been working on
[43:11] it for a month we'll say the Lord's been
[43:14] dealing with him on certain things and
[43:15] he puts this thing in order and pulls
[43:18] that in and right up to the time Amazing
[43:20] Grace is being sung or only believe he's
[43:23] putting that final piece of the puzzle
[43:24] right in its place so he can bring a
[43:26] message
[43:27] now how effective is he going to be if
[43:31] the people he's preaching to don't do
[43:34] any
[43:35] homework right don't study don't pray
[43:39] don't listen to the message don't give
[43:41] attendance to reading exhortation or
[43:43] doctrine how effective do you think that
[43:45] Ministry is going to be we've seen it
[43:47] already through the years we've seen how
[43:49] effective they are they
[43:51] ain't the preacher gets up there and he
[43:53] he Stomps around and and he punches away
[43:56] at things and D drives away at things
[43:57] trying to get the people into it he's
[43:59] got to beat the time at them come on
[44:00] somebody come on somebody come on
[44:02] somebody come on somebody when you see
[44:04] that you know you've got a bunch of lazy
[44:07] students cuz they're not doing their
[44:09] work if they were already givings to
[44:11] reading exhortation and Doctrine come on
[44:14] now then the preacher wouldn't have to
[44:16] work too hard you would already know
[44:18] where he's coming from and most of the
[44:20] time you'd be sitting there saying my
[44:22] god I've been waiting all week to figure
[44:23] out how to turn that puzzle piece I've
[44:26] been looking at that all week thank God
[44:28] for the man of God to tell me how the
[44:29] Holy Spirit showed him how to put
[44:32] it sir you say but God don't do that
[44:34] hold on who who brother B's sitting in
[44:37] his chair looking at the picture of Life
[44:40] magazine they've already taken it two
[44:42] years it's been in circulation and all
[44:44] of a sudden the prophet's looking at it
[44:46] and the Holy Spirit says turn it this
[44:49] way you can hear him on the tape when
[44:52] brother man turns it and shows him then
[44:53] you hear him
[44:54] go he said see his eyes see Jesus
[44:57] looking down there see his beard and his
[44:58] hair he's that white wig one that

[45:03] earth
[45:05] Hallelujah God told him how to turn the
[45:08] peace amen just like he could tell you
[45:10] how to turn your pieces but you've got
[45:13] to give yourself to reading exhortation
[45:15] and
[45:16] Doctrine sister don't spend all your
[45:18] time just studying on about how to how
[45:20] how to you know about dress and Holiness
[45:21] and and just looking at things like that
[45:23] sit down and learn about the seals sit
[45:25] down and figure the godhead out s now
[45:27] spend time with water baptism what in
[45:29] the world is it going to hurt if you
[45:31] know more about your own
[45:34] salvation how is that going to hurt you
[45:38] to know more about the Bible and the man
[45:39] that wrote the Bible that you love
[45:41] wouldn't you want to know about more of
[45:42] his letter hallelujah oh but I I
[45:45] wouldn't want to get deceived you got
[45:46] the Holy
[45:47] Ghost if you are born again my goodness
[45:50] for the Sisters tonight Brothers you are
[45:52] dismissed
[45:53] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen but if
[45:57] you look at all of these great things of
[45:59] God Amen there's nothing in this Bible
[46:01] right here amen that would allow you to
[46:03] be deceived if you are born again of the
[46:06] spirit of
[46:07] godj the elected cannot be deceived it's
[46:11] impossible to deceive them hallelujah
[46:13] amen be it a man a woman or whoever it
[46:15] is yes the elected cannot be deceived
[46:19] amen that's just a a a crutch that men
[46:22] in this message have leaned on because
[46:24] they like keeping their women under
[46:26] their thumb
[46:27] keeping them beat down in subjection
[46:30] treating them like you know baby makers
[46:32] and Pie makers forgive me but a woman
[46:35] has a whole lot more value than that in
[46:37] the body of Christ and I'll even submit
[46:39] to you that sometimes women can be more
[46:41] spiritual than some of us egg-headed
[46:43] hard-headed men that's right brother yes
[46:46] praise the Lord somebody oh I know some
[46:48] of y'all sisters ain't going to holler
[46:49] amen that's tradition in you that's not
[46:52] keeping you from hollering
[46:53] amen oh I don't want to believe
[46:55] something like that brother Ben but is
[46:57] true amen just because he's a man
[46:59] doesn't give him an automatic pass on to
[47:02] being the greatest of the greatest of
[47:03] the
[47:04] greatest there are some men that are so
[47:06] sorry you should the dogs won't even
[47:07] bark their name they're so low down that
[47:10] amen they couldn't get no lower than the
[47:12] snake's belly the way they behave amen
[47:13] there's some Godly women in those homes
[47:16] that through the conversation alone can
[47:18] win them ungodly men to the
[47:20] Lord amen I sat and had supper wife and
[47:24] I had supper with amen a a couple that
[47:27] we had met amen we've known him for a
[47:28] number of years but never had any
[47:30] fellowship and a brother and sister was
[47:32] telling the story and he was testifying
[47:34] of all the different things that he'd
[47:35] got into when he backslid and went out
[47:37] into the world Amen and all of the
[47:39] little abuses and the things that come
[47:41] along with a worldly man like that amen
[47:44] and I I love this part of the story he
[47:45] said I even at one time he said I got so
[47:48] cruel he said that I set up little
[47:50] cameras and things around the room to
[47:52] try to catch her in something amen he
[47:54] said and I did catch her in something I
[47:55] said what was that he said said I caught
[47:57] her praying and calling on the name of
[47:59] the Lord and calling my name out to God
[48:01] asking God to save me and deliver me he
[48:04] said I caught her all right he said but
[48:05] I caught her not doing the thing I
[48:06] thought she might be doing amen he said
[48:09] I figured she'd be doing something
[48:10] worldly amen running around on me or
[48:12] something like that he said but when I
[48:13] turned that little thing on and looked
[48:15] at the replay on the camera said there
[48:17] she was on her knees calling out to the
[48:19] Lord some women can be spiritual if they
[48:22] allow it yes amen if they allow thems to
[48:25] be spiritual they can be I know that
[48:28] women have a place in the body that
[48:29] they're not allowed to preach and not
[48:30] allowed to hold a office in the church
[48:32] like that I understand that and I
[48:35] understand that the women are supposed
[48:36] to be quiet as far as you know the the
[48:38] business matters of the assembly amen
[48:41] and if they have a question let their
[48:42] ask their own husband at home I get that
[48:45] but that is not because you're stupid
[48:48] that's not because you're ignorant
[48:50] that's not because you're dumb but it's
[48:53] keeping the order of the spirit that's
[48:55] all that is that you have a place as a
[48:58] woman and God wants you to keep that
[49:00] order and if there's a Godly Man there
[49:02] all you have to do is go speak it and
[49:04] the Holy Spirit will use you and put it
[49:07] in his heart about the right choice to
[49:09] make or the thing to say whatever it
[49:11] might be you can be a great influence in
[49:14] that way if you'll allow yourself to be
[49:16] amen amen my family on my side amen rais
[49:19] more shinness and I can shake a stick at
[49:22] and you know what it's a good thing many
[49:23] of my cousins and uncles and different
[49:25] ones Through The Years got a a hold of
[49:27] some of them corn Fred fed cornbred
[49:29] women amen because when they tried to do
[49:31] their little bully and Bulldog thing
[49:33] some of them women would fight back
[49:34] thank God for
[49:35] them cuz some of them big mouse they
[49:38] needed to have a little taste of their
[49:39] own
[49:41] medicine words Amen in case you forgot
[49:44] it sauce for the goose is good for the
[49:47] gander amen it's exactly right he can't
[49:50] walk around and talk about you better
[49:51] respect me be respectable she
[49:54] can right live a life she can respect
[49:57] and she will respect you amen I don't
[49:59] say that we don't have to lay down the
[50:00] laws sometimes in our home as Leaders we
[50:02] all have to put our foot down about
[50:04] certain things there's always going to
[50:05] be fusses and arguments and back and
[50:07] forth like that but if the people were
[50:09] talking about or Born Again of the holy
[50:11] spirit amen God will have the final say
[50:13] in what takes
[50:15] place amen it's exactly right but in the
[50:18] meantime we are to give oursel to
[50:20] reading exhortation and to Doctrine why
[50:23] in the world do we have people around
[50:26] this rank of this truth that believes
[50:28] that you can't get a revelation unless
[50:30] some preacher's preaching it to
[50:33] you you can receive a revelation at your
[50:37] houseall you can hear Brother bam say
[50:39] something and a revelation light your
[50:41] soul on fire that's right you don't need
[50:44] a preacher for that Revelation to bring
[50:45] you anywhere as far as whether you had
[50:47] it yourself or not that's between you
[50:50] and God amen amen and when God's going
[50:52] to give somebody Revelation he don't
[50:54] email all his preachers and ask for
[50:55] permission by the way
[50:57] I have yet to receive a text message
[50:59] from my phone's in there I I've yet to
[51:01] receive a text message from the Lord
[51:02] saying is it okay to give Jesse a
[51:04] revelation this
[51:05] week God does what he wants to do am and
[51:09] he does it with every open heart that's
[51:10] willing to receive him so our job as a
[51:15] congregation is to give
[51:17] attendance to reading exitation Doctrine
[51:19] I love this word be th an example it
[51:21] means a pattern or stroke or a blow
[51:23] leaving an impression this is the way we
[51:25] should live our life be it charity
[51:27] conversation Spirit Faith purity of word
[51:29] whatever it might be leave an impression
[51:31] on somebody before they leave your
[51:33] presence amen now let's turn to
[51:36] Ephesians chapter 4 now we're just going
[51:38] to read one verse of this save time
[51:40] because we quoted a much of it this
[51:41] morning I'm going pick up verse
[51:44] 16 now I want you to go a little deeper
[51:47] with me tonight about this part on the
[51:49] ministry a little
[51:51] bit all right now you'll notice that the
[51:54] whole body
[51:57] fitly joined
[51:58] together watch now
[52:01] compacted by which every joint
[52:05] supplieth this word
[52:07] compacted means to
[52:09] coales to join to unite to knit together
[52:12] in
[52:13] affection but it also means to prove to
[52:15] demonstrate to teach or
[52:18] instruct so in other words when the body
[52:22] becomes compacted together not only are
[52:26] they going to to demonstrate the word
[52:27] that's being preached in their lives in
[52:29] their families their homes and what more
[52:32] but they're also going to be able to
[52:33] reciprocate that and teach and instruct
[52:36] thems remember what Paul said when you
[52:38] should be teachers yourself still you
[52:40] have desire to be taught amen it's
[52:43] needful that I write unto you these
[52:45] things concerning the Commandments of
[52:46] the Lord Paul knowing they didn't have
[52:50] instructors that could teach him what
[52:51] was right think back now think every
[52:55] time you've ever had those areas of your
[52:57] life when you felt like the worst of a
[52:59] Christian you're trying to serve God to
[53:01] the best of your ability think back who
[53:03] was leading you at the time what kind of
[53:06] Pastor what kind of Shepherd what kind
[53:08] of evangelist what kind of influence
[53:09] were you under in the ministry yes many
[53:13] of the things that you didn't know
[53:15] wasn't because you didn't have a heart
[53:16] to receive them it's because you didn't
[53:18] have anybody to preach it to
[53:20] you you didn't have anyone to teach it
[53:22] to you therefore you don't know what you
[53:25] don't know come on somebody yes sir if
[53:28] you don't know it how you supposed to
[53:29] know
[53:30] it
[53:32] amen notice the word compacted here
[53:37] now anybody that knows anything about
[53:39] laying concrete you may
[53:41] not well let me give you the easy
[53:43] version of this they go out yonder and
[53:45] they scrape a place on the ground they
[53:47] not make it nice and level and clean
[53:50] they pour a bunch of rock on the bottom
[53:53] they put some metal rebar type stuff in
[53:55] there just strengthen it and hold it all
[53:58] together but before they put that rebar
[54:00] in there where the concrete is going to
[54:02] be on top that bar like that and it'll
[54:04] solid it'll it'll it'll cure up solid
[54:08] they put up a like a strong layer of
[54:10] good solid rock on the bottom now these
[54:13] concrete people know that if I lay that
[54:16] rock and walk off there and leave it and
[54:18] pour that concrete on top of it that
[54:21] when the seasons begin to change that
[54:23] stuff flexes and bends you can't see it
[54:25] but it moves cuz the Earth is always
[54:27] moving the tectonic plates are pulling
[54:29] and everything up on top of it's pulling
[54:31] with those plates asz you know the Earth
[54:33] is one big magnet so things is pulling
[54:36] this way and twisting and every which
[54:37] way and any good concrete layer whether
[54:40] there weight and salt knows that if I
[54:42] leave that rock loose in there you're
[54:44] going to have all kinds of cracks and
[54:46] breaks and everything in that material
[54:47] whenever it gets too many storms come
[54:50] along so he goes across with a machine
[54:53] or he takes a big hand tool and tamps it
[54:56] they call it one of the worst jobs I've
[54:57] ever done in my entire life thank God
[54:59] I'm a preacher in that case amen it's
[55:00] the only time I've ever been grateful to
[55:02] be a preacher amen he takes this big
[55:04] thing and it goes across and it pushes
[55:07] and it compacts or they got machines now
[55:09] where you can turn them on and it
[55:10] vibrates and you go across and it
[55:12] presses these rocks tightly together
[55:16] once they are compacted then you can lay
[55:18] your bar out pour your concrete on it
[55:21] and then let the winds and the seasons
[55:22] change let the winds blow and the storms
[55:25] come amen for years to come after that
[55:29] that concrete is still holding tightly
[55:30] and firm with no cracks in Revelation
[55:33] anywhere amen this is what Paul is
[55:35] saying the whole body must be fitly
[55:38] joined together remember as I've
[55:40] preached to it here before many years
[55:41] I've been saying this coming up here
[55:43] amen remember confessions are like
[55:45] stones but it takes a sharp tool to
[55:47] shape that stone into the image of
[55:49] Christ to fit fit fitly be joined into
[55:53] the body of Christ but after you are fit
[55:55] into the body of Christ after you are
[55:57] placed in your position then you've got
[55:59] to be compacted
[56:01] together amen the Holy Ghost has got to
[56:04] come amen and drill you down and cling
[56:06] you that much closer
[56:09] together that's why God sometimes will
[56:11] send an evangelist like me with a good
[56:14] sharp tool and a machine that does this
[56:17] the whole time you're in
[56:19] church and sometimes people get done in
[56:21] Services of mine I can almost see them
[56:23] doing this number when they're walking
[56:24] out Hallelujah the compactor has done
[56:26] his job all over
[56:28] again amen that's right sometimes we've
[56:31] got to be compacted together so when the
[56:34] storm hits the body the solid foundation
[56:37] will hold
[56:38] hallelujah amen so the ministry's job is
[56:42] to help the body to
[56:45] coales to come together same Revelation
[56:49] same Faith yes same understanding
[56:52] Hallelujah same scriptural Foundation of
[56:55] Truth right with the same experience
[56:57] with God same Holy Ghost yes bringing us
[57:01] all together into
[57:04] one
[57:07] complete
[57:08] compacted
[57:10] unit of Jesus
[57:12] Christ kind of like that photo on the
[57:15] wall when the Capstone sits on
[57:19] it cuz when the Capstone fitly sets down
[57:22] on all those fitly pieces you can't put
[57:25] a razor blade between
[57:27] them they are so tightly moved and
[57:31] positioned together nothing can separate
[57:34] them from the love that is in Christ
[57:37] jesusall Oh Glory to God that's part of
[57:41] the ministry's job is to bring the
[57:43] people the bride together but you know
[57:46] here's where we get all twisted up in
[57:48] another direction we think oh my
[57:49] goodness look at this person doing this
[57:51] thing and that thing they're doing their
[57:52] own thing not everybody's going to get
[57:54] on
[57:54] board right but it's our job as
[57:57] preachers to look for the ones to search
[58:00] out the ones that want to be
[58:03] compacted I I want to say something to
[58:05] you if you're not willing to be
[58:07] compacted you don't want to be a part of
[58:08] the body of
[58:09] Christ right only God's
[58:14] men can fulfill this
[58:17] role anybody else comes along with a
[58:19] sharp tool with a tamper or a compacting
[58:23] machine or any other kind of tool and
[58:25] try to to do the same job it messed the
[58:28] whole thing up and when the storm comes
[58:31] along it proves they didn't know what
[58:32] they were doing in the first place all
[58:35] it takes is for you to look back on your
[58:36] life and realize anytime you've ever
[58:38] spiritually cracked it's because you had
[58:41] a leader that didn't tell you how to
[58:42] fitly put the thing together
[58:44] right oh you say you shouldn't blame the
[58:46] preacher why not he's the one to
[58:49] blame you say he's not hold on brother
[58:52] Brenham said we talked so much about
[58:53] juvenile delinquency he said juvenile
[58:56] delinquency comes from parent
[58:58] delinquency he said but actually that
[59:00] delinquency comes from a greater
[59:02] delinquency what he call pull pit
[59:04] delinquency right brother because a man
[59:06] ain't willing to deal with the thing
[59:08] that he needs to deal with or the things
[59:09] plural he needs to deal with amen it
[59:11] puts the congregation in a spot where
[59:13] they're
[59:15] loose living any way they live and doing
[59:18] anything they want to do so that
[59:19] preacher's got to come along and say Hey
[59:21] you saints of God quit just gossiping
[59:24] about one another yes sir spending whole
[59:26] Services telling you to straighten up
[59:28] and pray and read the Bible and get that
[59:30] bitterness out of your heart don't you
[59:33] know what's happening the Holy Ghost is
[59:35] come glory to God Amen he's compacting
[59:39] you
[59:41] together cuz once he gets you tight then
[59:43] he knows he can pour a foundation over
[59:47] you but if you're still loose about a
[59:49] lot of things he can't sit it down he
[59:51] cannot establish what he needs to
[59:53] establish in the church if it's that way
[59:55] now let's let's flip it back to the
[59:56] audience for a little bit and the patas
[59:58] vision brother said like this he said
[59:59] you know that's exactly what started the
[1:00:01] church in chaos at the beginning they
[1:00:03] had taken all the solinity from the
[1:00:06] audience and placed it in the
[1:00:09] Pulpit but God is the god of the
[1:00:13] audience amen he works in every human
[1:00:18] being he lives in every human heart he
[1:00:21] can get
[1:00:22] into amen he finds gifted people and
[1:00:26] works through them so neither Paul nor
[1:00:30] brother brandham was a oneman Ministry
[1:00:33] guy brother any of these preachers
[1:00:35] around this message or any of these
[1:00:36] people around the message no matter who
[1:00:38] they think they are that say that God is
[1:00:40] only a oneman Ministry If any man think
[1:00:42] himself spiritual or Prophet let him
[1:00:45] acknowledge what Paul said was the
[1:00:46] Commandment of the
[1:00:47] Lord and Paul never established for us
[1:00:50] that we are stuck in a oneman Ministry
[1:00:53] that's right God sent a oneman Ministry
[1:00:55] to this earth but that one man Ministry
[1:00:57] has given birth to many Ministries
[1:00:59] underneath it and I don't care how
[1:01:02] devilish or evil some of these men have
[1:01:03] Liv amen there is still a true five-fold
[1:01:06] Ministry there is still true pastors and
[1:01:09] apostles and Men of God that can tell us
[1:01:11] what the truth
[1:01:13] is that's right and they'll remain
[1:01:15] faithful in spite of their own selves
[1:01:17] thank God Hallelujah yes sir I said in
[1:01:19] spite of their own self they'll live
[1:01:21] Faith as many of these guys they don't
[1:01:23] want to do the job in the first place
[1:01:25] and in spite out of their own
[1:01:26] inadequacies God will still force them
[1:01:29] to the issue and set them out there as
[1:01:31] an example and a testimony glory to God
[1:01:34] Amen of what God's doing in this
[1:01:35] generation yes sir let anybody say what
[1:01:38] they want to about these men but God's
[1:01:41] the one that'll speak for his true
[1:01:42] fivefold Ministry
[1:01:44] Amen in the days of Anan of Safar will
[1:01:47] return told us those hours and those
[1:01:50] days and those times will come back and
[1:01:52] I believe with all of my heart that the
[1:01:54] church is fitly Con compacted together
[1:01:57] living in love operating by the love of
[1:02:00] God brotherly kindness and all the
[1:02:03] things that go with a Christian Life if
[1:02:05] a man or woman is operating and doing
[1:02:07] the way they need to do I believe with
[1:02:08] all of my
[1:02:10] heart that sin won't be able to stand in
[1:02:12] that congregation amen amen and that's
[1:02:15] what brother B prophesied to us would
[1:02:17] happen before we got ready to go out of
[1:02:18] here that sin couldn't stand to be in
[1:02:21] that
[1:02:23] congregation now let me read to you out
[1:02:25] of God keep his word but man said now
[1:02:27] look do you believe the Ephesian Church
[1:02:28] spoke in tongues certainly he said Do
[1:02:31] you believe they had signs and wonders
[1:02:32] yes sir but they knowed how to place
[1:02:36] them listen to this carefully their
[1:02:38] pastors knowed how to set them and put
[1:02:40] the church in order but the Corinthians
[1:02:45] didn't so it wasn't that the Corinthians
[1:02:47] were bad the really really bad bad bad
[1:02:49] bad bad ones and the Ephesians were the
[1:02:52] so much better ones you know that's
[1:02:54] about the way we qualifi churches around
[1:02:55] the ranks today uh certain certain
[1:02:57] church is the better church and that's
[1:02:59] the one that's got all the truth and God
[1:03:01] and the Holy Ghost moving in it and then
[1:03:02] that little bitty group Down Yonder in
[1:03:04] some little place in a holler and back
[1:03:06] in the woods and on and on you know
[1:03:07] that's just the other
[1:03:11] church it's amazing how we qualify right
[1:03:15] how deep and how rich is the grace of
[1:03:16] God in an area based
[1:03:19] on how worldly the church is how exposed
[1:03:23] and visible the group is or how well
[1:03:25] known their Pastor is woo y'all getting
[1:03:28] quiet on me but here we
[1:03:30] are right God doesn't
[1:03:34] discriminate he'll come to a little tiny
[1:03:36] group and he'll come to a big one right
[1:03:39] that's right you know in my years of
[1:03:41] serving the lord and preaching all these
[1:03:43] different types of venues and places
[1:03:46] that I've been in I've preached
[1:03:47] everywhere it looks like I was thinking
[1:03:49] the other day I think the only place I
[1:03:51] hadn't preached in was in a is in a
[1:03:52] restroom somewhere or another but then I
[1:03:54] got to think it one time amen amen we we
[1:03:57] was in a an out building like this amen
[1:04:00] and and and I needed a place to go back
[1:04:02] in and record a certain thing amen I'm
[1:04:04] standing right in the middle of this
[1:04:05] bathroom because the Acoustics were the
[1:04:07] best I thought I even preached in the
[1:04:08] bathroom
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:11] amen amen and you know what I found I
[1:04:14] found this is what makes to me this is
[1:04:16] what makes Jesus so great yes in these
[1:04:19] great big churches with hundreds in
[1:04:20] front of you thousands in front of you
[1:04:22] at times I've found him to show up in
[1:04:25] immediate sized churches I found him to
[1:04:28] show up and in the little bitty churches
[1:04:30] when ain't hardly nobody around I Found
[1:04:32] Jesus to show up just the
[1:04:34] same that's what makes him so great to
[1:04:36] me he's not qualifying the effect of his
[1:04:39] presence based on whether or not the
[1:04:41] pastor is this and the people are that
[1:04:43] do they have an internet program and how
[1:04:45] many people come to their Church brother
[1:04:46] Jesse and how many that's right brother
[1:04:49] God don't care about stuff like
[1:04:51] that Hallelujah he's only looking for
[1:04:54] those that are willing to hear what's
[1:04:57] right and to express what's
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] now I love this but said in church order
[1:05:04] he said then after he told them talking
[1:05:06] about the Corinthians again like a
[1:05:08] father began to let the whip down on
[1:05:09] them I hear there's contentions among
[1:05:11] you and I hear that you get drunk at the
[1:05:13] Lord's table he didn't UNC christianize
[1:05:17] them and don't you Brethren do that un
[1:05:20] christianized them but it's the way they
[1:05:22] were behaving themselves in the house of
[1:05:25] God
[1:05:26] that's where it was at he said so it
[1:05:29] wasn't a matter of their experience it
[1:05:32] was a matter that they had all these
[1:05:33] puzzle pieces in front of them and they
[1:05:35] didn't know how to work them and the
[1:05:37] lacking of leadership in their life
[1:05:39] caused them to make very very poor
[1:05:42] choices but do you know how we know that
[1:05:44] God Loved These people and they were
[1:05:46] truly his children because every one of
[1:05:49] them got straightened out
[1:05:51] eventually cuz over a period of time
[1:05:54] this is only the book of Corinthians in
[1:05:55] rough dry
[1:05:57] form woo thank you Jesus amen all you're
[1:06:01] seeing is that Corinthian Church in
[1:06:03] rough dry form give God some time if we
[1:06:05] could have seen them 40 years down the
[1:06:07] road they might have been more spiritual
[1:06:09] than Ephesians
[1:06:11] were amen amen amen this is just the
[1:06:15] rough DFT side of these people God took
[1:06:18] all kinds of time I'm sure amen and and
[1:06:21] and selected how many men he'd send down
[1:06:23] to him and how many preachers would come
[1:06:25] how how many pastors would oversee that
[1:06:27] group to get him straightened
[1:06:28] out but we get him right in the very
[1:06:31] beginning raw
[1:06:34] uncut and all of their mess like he
[1:06:37] talked about Israel when he found Israel
[1:06:39] with her Naval uncut found in her blood
[1:06:41] given birth on the side of the road amen
[1:06:43] the umbilical cord and everything and
[1:06:44] Benta one more the blood and the water
[1:06:46] and all the the the mucking a m found
[1:06:48] Israel sitting right turn in that
[1:06:50] condition that's right that's a
[1:06:51] Corinthian Church but they were born
[1:06:54] they were Holy Ghost filled people they
[1:06:57] just didn't have any pastors to
[1:06:58] straighten them
[1:07:00] out you don't know what you don't know
[1:07:03] have I said that already yes sir let me
[1:07:06] say it again you don't know what you
[1:07:08] don't know you say well God's supposed
[1:07:11] to tell me he did but he didn't do it on
[1:07:12] their timeline or
[1:07:14] yours he chose to speak to them how he
[1:07:16] chose to speak to them and Paul went to
[1:07:18] visit this group and heard from the
[1:07:20] house of Khloe that there's a bunch of
[1:07:22] foolishness going on I imagine Paul got
[1:07:24] that little jewi stand her up a little
[1:07:26] bit and said well my God if that's the
[1:07:28] way these bunch of children are going to
[1:07:30] act I'm going to deal with
[1:07:32] them watch him when he comes in he
[1:07:35] starts talking about how they're going
[1:07:37] to behave
[1:07:39] themselves that mean angry hook noosed
[1:07:42] Jew brother B called him with that high
[1:07:45] temper well he laid the whip on him all
[1:07:48] right he spoke to him with such love and
[1:07:51] grace and talked to him as sheep and as
[1:07:55] children of God he didn't UNC
[1:07:57] christianize them he didn't throw them
[1:07:58] in hell he didn't tell them they were
[1:07:59] worthless and
[1:08:01] scum but he spoke to them starting with
[1:08:04] their experience of who they were and
[1:08:07] how God loved them and then he dealt
[1:08:10] with all of their problems like any true
[1:08:12] Minister will do you know what makes a
[1:08:15] church great when they are willing to
[1:08:17] let a preacher do
[1:08:21] that when a congregation is willing
[1:08:25] to let a preacher tell them the truth
[1:08:27] though it hurts
[1:08:28] him now you're working some with some
[1:08:31] real bride
[1:08:33] material right Hallelujah cuz until then
[1:08:37] you got nothing but a bunch of
[1:08:39] babies that ain't been born yet
[1:08:42] nearly you know just kind of halfway in
[1:08:45] halfway out bunch of
[1:08:48] kids You Preach to the gospel huh I'll
[1:08:51] give you to know my daddy's a pastor
[1:08:53] well your daddy is a pastor isn't he
[1:08:56] I give you to know I'm the Deacon's kid
[1:08:58] that's not born that's not Sons right
[1:09:02] Sons and Daughters they don't look at
[1:09:03] things like that when they hear that
[1:09:05] they've done wrong they grieve in their
[1:09:08] heart Lord I didn't realize getting
[1:09:10] drunk like that at the Lord's table was
[1:09:12] wrong you know Lord I've always drank
[1:09:13] wine like that and we always thought
[1:09:15] there was nothing wrong with it so I
[1:09:17] just grabbed it and turned it up I
[1:09:19] didn't mean to do that Lord I'm
[1:09:21] sorry and then as they found leaders to
[1:09:23] put the church in order everything was
[1:09:25] placed in its proper order now I like
[1:09:28] this in Romans chapter 13 let's let's
[1:09:31] let's turn there and go to verse one for
[1:09:32] a little
[1:09:33] bit now let me show you why this is
[1:09:38] beneficial preachers in the pull pit
[1:09:40] that are true God called man and there's
[1:09:41] a brother a few weeks ago that said
[1:09:43] something to me that I I never thought
[1:09:45] of just in this way but I like it he
[1:09:47] said brother Ben are all of these other
[1:09:51] ones out there true five-fold
[1:09:53] Ministry I said well yeah they're five
[1:09:55] full ministry preachers and things are
[1:09:56] gifted he said but do they perfect the
[1:09:59] bride and I thought wow now that's an
[1:10:02] excellent thought therefore not every
[1:10:04] preacher is necessarily A five-fold
[1:10:08] godall preacher for the
[1:10:10] bride some are just gifted to preach
[1:10:13] that doesn't mean they're gifted to
[1:10:14] bring us into
[1:10:18] Perfection amen that's why you should
[1:10:20] always be careful what you're listening
[1:10:21] to and guess what if you're giving
[1:10:23] yourself to reading exhortation and
[1:10:25] Doctrine
[1:10:26] they can't get very far when they start
[1:10:27] nonsense because you already
[1:10:29] know just a little secret I'll pass to
[1:10:32] you okay just tuck out in your pocket
[1:10:34] take it home with you now watch this
[1:10:36] verse 13 verse one chapter 13 let every
[1:10:41] soul did you get that every soul Deacon
[1:10:47] Souls Pastor Souls evangelist Souls
[1:10:50] housewife
[1:10:51] Souls farmer
[1:10:53] Souls let every Soul be subject under
[1:10:57] the higher powers for there's no power
[1:11:00] but of god the powers that be are
[1:11:02] ordained of
[1:11:05] God I like this the word he uses here
[1:11:07] for
[1:11:08] subject is it's a military term
[1:11:13] meaning in Greek they would come by and
[1:11:16] say huso the soldiers would fall in line
[1:11:20] but the other side of this word huso in
[1:11:24] a non-military way it was used as a
[1:11:28] voluntary voluntary attitude of giving
[1:11:31] in cooperating assuming
[1:11:35] responsibility and carrying a
[1:11:38] burden so every
[1:11:43] soul should have a voluntary attitude of
[1:11:46] giving in cooperating assuming
[1:11:50] responsibility and carrying a burden we
[1:11:53] going to get in trouble already ain't we
[1:11:56] that goes for preachers too preachers
[1:11:59] are supposed to have an attitude of
[1:12:00] cooperation right well
[1:12:03] Hallelujah brother Bram gives us a great
[1:12:05] example of that when they were going to
[1:12:06] build the new Tabernacle he said because
[1:12:09] the Lord did not give him a vision about
[1:12:10] it he let the people go with their vote
[1:12:12] and build a new church brother man was
[1:12:14] against the church but why did he go
[1:12:16] with the people first of all the Lord
[1:12:18] did not give him a vision or dream or
[1:12:20] interpretation or speak to him or send
[1:12:22] the angel of the Lord to tell him not to
[1:12:23] do it so he had nothing spiritual to
[1:12:24] draw back on in any way whatsoever but
[1:12:27] he also was a Christian that had a
[1:12:30] voluntary attitude of
[1:12:32] cooperation his own words I saw the
[1:12:34] people wanted it frankly we needed it he
[1:12:36] said but frankly I was against
[1:12:38] it but because he had this spirit in him
[1:12:42] are you hearing me he was willing to
[1:12:45] cooperate with the needs of the people
[1:12:47] that's
[1:12:48] right I've seen so many so-called
[1:12:51] leaders the people genuinely need
[1:12:54] something different to happen happen in
[1:12:55] the church and that man with his foot
[1:12:58] his his his foot stuck in the mud
[1:13:00] singing I shall not be
[1:13:02] moved and to people
[1:13:05] suffering because he absolutely will not
[1:13:08] Bend or change or do different you tell
[1:13:11] me that man's a true leader according to
[1:13:13] this right here he's not obeying Romans
[1:13:15] chapter 13 verse1 I won't UNC
[1:13:17] christianize him but his behavior is
[1:13:19] wrong he's supposed to give his soul in
[1:13:22] subjection to a higher power and if the
[1:13:24] people are operating under the
[1:13:25] assumption that they have a voice then
[1:13:29] he's supposed to listen to some of the
[1:13:30] things they say now I'll give you credit
[1:13:33] pastors should be the kind of men to be
[1:13:34] able to make the final decision they
[1:13:36] ought to be able to have the final say a
[1:13:38] god-called pastor can change whatever he
[1:13:40] wants in a church and he don't need a
[1:13:41] vote for
[1:13:42] it no he don't need your permission for
[1:13:44] it neither if he's called of God to lead
[1:13:47] you and lead your soul he does whatever
[1:13:49] the Lord deals with him on he does it
[1:13:51] that's the end of it
[1:13:57] but there are
[1:13:59] times that sometimes leaders don't
[1:14:03] always get it right that's
[1:14:08] right yes sir you can say am man it
[1:14:10] ain't going to hurt nothing there's no
[1:14:12] message Mafia going to take you out when
[1:14:14] this service is over because you said
[1:14:16] amen against the preachers nobody's
[1:14:18] gonna put a hit out on
[1:14:21] you that's why we've got to be
[1:14:26] open to listen to what other people
[1:14:30] think and say you know
[1:14:33] what Pastor whoever maybe we do need
[1:14:36] something for the young people in this
[1:14:38] church maybe we do need to have Bible
[1:14:41] studies maybe we do need to do certain
[1:14:43] things have a singing or whatever it may
[1:14:45] be maybe the sisters do need to have a
[1:14:48] fellowship dinner or some other kind of
[1:14:50] thing I've seen men none my church and
[1:14:53] if you don't like it get another Pastor
[1:14:56] now that's not what Paul said a man's
[1:14:58] supposed to
[1:14:59] be he's supposed to have a Val voluntary
[1:15:02] attitude of
[1:15:04] cooperation well we go down to that
[1:15:06] church down there but you know we don't
[1:15:08] get along with them people down there
[1:15:09] and they don't get along with us and I
[1:15:11] we'll just stay up here and we'll be our
[1:15:13] own church we'll be safer that way we
[1:15:14] don't want to expose oursel to people
[1:15:16] who think differently from us I know
[1:15:18] that would be awful wouldn't
[1:15:20] it CU then you know what you become a
[1:15:23] bunch of narrow minded nitwits that
[1:15:24] don't know
[1:15:25] anything stuck in your own little world
[1:15:28] stuck in your own little mode but we
[1:15:30] ought to be willing to cooperate with
[1:15:32] those that are different from us
[1:15:35] amen praise the Lord
[1:15:38] sir now
[1:15:39] notice verse two whosoever therefore
[1:15:42] resisteth the power watch resist the
[1:15:46] order of
[1:15:47] God and they that resist shall receive
[1:15:50] to themselves damnation what do you
[1:15:52] think it's going to look like at the
[1:15:53] white Throne judgment for all of these
[1:15:55] people around the message that refuse to
[1:15:57] send a five-fold ministry that's right
[1:16:00] this is what's going to happen to them
[1:16:01] right here they are they are receiving
[1:16:03] into their own bosom damnation of God
[1:16:07] God will judge them for their arrogant
[1:16:09] attitude against coming to church yes
[1:16:17] sir well I don't need to come to church
[1:16:19] nobody would miss me really so God LED
[1:16:24] you
[1:16:25] gave you the understanding revealed to
[1:16:27] you this is your pastor this is your
[1:16:30] church and so you just choose to kind of
[1:16:32] halfway
[1:16:35] come show up when you feel like
[1:16:38] it well I'll make decisions whether or
[1:16:40] not I want to go tonight I'm pretty
[1:16:42] tired ain't it amazing they get tired on
[1:16:44] church night but while they're at home
[1:16:46] they ain't too tired to do everything
[1:16:48] else they'll clean they'll cook they'll
[1:16:50] answer emails they'll finish projects
[1:16:52] they'll do all kinds of things they'll
[1:16:54] go outside and I'll do this thing and
[1:16:56] that thing and all kinds of other things
[1:16:58] and instead of having this
[1:17:01] desire I've labored all week in the word
[1:17:03] I've given tendance to study reading and
[1:17:05] exhortation and things and Doctor what
[1:17:07] more and I excited to see how God's
[1:17:10] going to help me put my puzzle
[1:17:12] together they just stay at home and
[1:17:14] don't work the puzzle at
[1:17:17] all three services become 10 10 become
[1:17:20] 20 before long you
[1:17:22] backslid and you stay out Soom and let
[1:17:25] me tell you something if you don't at
[1:17:26] least keep up on the internet and keep
[1:17:28] up on your services they've been
[1:17:29] recorded and what more amen and be able
[1:17:31] to figure out because I don't always get
[1:17:32] to be home I'm here I'm other places out
[1:17:35] preaching but we got an internet stream
[1:17:37] I can go back and listen to everything
[1:17:39] my pastor preaches and the other
[1:17:40] brothers preach and I can keep up on
[1:17:42] what's being said there because I don't
[1:17:44] know about you but I don't want to miss
[1:17:45] an opportunity to put a piece in that I
[1:17:47] didn't know how it went
[1:17:51] before Hallelujah we need these men
[1:17:55] because God ordained them to do the job
[1:17:58] they're doing amen and
[1:18:01] amen for rulers are not tear to good
[1:18:04] works but to evil will thou then not be
[1:18:06] afraid of the power do that which is
[1:18:08] good and thou shalt have Praise of the
[1:18:10] same he is the Minister of God to thee
[1:18:13] for
[1:18:14] good but if thou do that which is evil
[1:18:17] be afraid for he beareth not the sword
[1:18:19] in vain for he is a minister of God a
[1:18:22] Revenger to execute wrath upon him that
[1:18:26] doeth evil wherefore you must needs be
[1:18:29] subject why Paul why not only for
[1:18:33] wrath's
[1:18:34] sake but for conscious sake the word he
[1:18:37] uses here for conscious in the original
[1:18:39] means having the ability to separate
[1:18:42] distinguish what is morally good and
[1:18:46] bad the soul distinguishing between what
[1:18:49] is morally good and bad so I don't just
[1:18:51] come to church just so that I can Escape
[1:18:55] hell and not be preached at thrown in
[1:18:57] hell for my bad
[1:18:59] behavior if I'm living wrong I expect to
[1:19:02] get it from the
[1:19:03] preacher as a matter of fact I told
[1:19:05] brother Jesse this morning this
[1:19:06] afternoon rather I said you know I used
[1:19:08] to feel bad about preaching the way I
[1:19:09] preach until I realized the reason I
[1:19:11] preach the way I do is you
[1:19:14] all I figured it out finally it took me
[1:19:16] 33 years but I figured it out finally by
[1:19:18] the grace of God that if people would
[1:19:20] live right I'd preach to them like they
[1:19:22] do but if they're not going to preach
[1:19:25] right I'll preach you like that too yes
[1:19:27] sir right so you want your pastor to
[1:19:29] preach High to you live
[1:19:31] high amen but if he comes out and
[1:19:34] goes you know what you've been doing
[1:19:36] through that
[1:19:38] week you haven't been studying haven't
[1:19:40] been giving yourself attendance of
[1:19:41] reading exitation and Doctrine how do
[1:19:43] you ever expect the word to take an
[1:19:46] upswing if you won't do it at home
[1:19:52] yourself but I also come to church so I
[1:19:55] can understand the difference between
[1:19:57] right and
[1:19:59] wrong cuz without a Ministry to tell me
[1:20:03] I don't really know yes sir oh now let's
[1:20:06] get into the debate how but the prophet
[1:20:08] can tell you that's true but the prophet
[1:20:11] didn't have the internet the prophet
[1:20:12] didn't have online pornography the
[1:20:14] prophet didn't have social media the
[1:20:16] prophet didn't have chat rooms and
[1:20:17] dating rooms and dating sites and he
[1:20:19] didn't have all of that in his time
[1:20:21] period and God needs some men that
[1:20:24] understand the modern trends of the day
[1:20:25] and how to deal with them appropriately
[1:20:27] rather than just push play and Obey
[1:20:30] God's got some men that are pushing play
[1:20:32] and obeying and some congregations that
[1:20:34] are pushing playing and obeying and he's
[1:20:36] got the Holy Spirit right there to take
[1:20:38] the message and modernize it for where
[1:20:40] they're living in that day and time
[1:20:44] amen what time period could you ever
[1:20:46] hear Brother bam talking about a
[1:20:50] vape they didn't have them but do you
[1:20:53] know how many of our message kids in the
[1:20:55] secret closets of the world are getting
[1:20:56] hooked on
[1:20:57] Vapes cuz they're being convinced that
[1:21:00] it's not smoking that it's not
[1:21:03] harmful
[1:21:05] sure there's a brother not too far amen
[1:21:08] from a a a church that I preached for
[1:21:10] out said to the pastor I dealt with a
[1:21:12] little bit that morning he said I wish
[1:21:13] brother Ben we go into that more about
[1:21:15] vaping and
[1:21:17] things it's a question amongst us young
[1:21:21] people but you're not going to find
[1:21:23] anything about it in the message of the
[1:21:24] hour directly that's right you can get a
[1:21:26] quote that parallels it but you know
[1:21:28] what some people need sometimes whether
[1:21:30] they like it or not they need somebody's
[1:21:32] little bony finger just pointing right
[1:21:34] at them and saying you you are the one
[1:21:36] you you
[1:21:39] right sometimes God needs some
[1:21:43] skin amen
[1:21:46] glory praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:21:49] can't go little further now watch this a
[1:21:52] message called question answer brother
[1:21:53] said who has the great is Authority an
[1:21:55] angel from heaven or an angel at the
[1:21:57] pull pit Hebrews chap 1:14 gives us the
[1:22:01] answer are they not all ministering
[1:22:02] Spirit sent forth the minister for them
[1:22:05] who shall be The Heirs of Salvation so
[1:22:07] the minister at the pull pit is greater
[1:22:10] than a than an angel in
[1:22:12] heaven and people bring the ministry
[1:22:15] down to the lowest class of the lowest
[1:22:18] class whenever through the gifts of God
[1:22:20] that God is using that's how the Lord
[1:22:23] gets the message across to the people
[1:22:25] about how to work their puzzle listen to
[1:22:27] this again Revelation book of symbols he
[1:22:29] said your pastor when he stands on this
[1:22:31] platform ministering the word of God he
[1:22:33] is God's angel to the church a messenger
[1:22:36] to the
[1:22:38] church a
[1:22:40] pastor wait wait wait wait a minute
[1:22:42] brother Ben I thought only brother
[1:22:44] brandham was the messenger well the
[1:22:46] messenger said your pastor in the pull
[1:22:49] pit is a
[1:22:50] messenger not to the age but to the
[1:22:53] church
[1:22:55] he's a messenger to his own local body
[1:22:58] he said therefore a pastor should never
[1:23:00] leave that word he should stay straight
[1:23:01] with that word because he's feeding in
[1:23:04] the shepherd's place oh my think of that
[1:23:07] oh glory to God he's feeding in the
[1:23:09] shepherd's place in other words the food
[1:23:11] he's given isn't his own
[1:23:13] food he didn't get it because he had a
[1:23:15] superior
[1:23:17] Revelation because God give it to him
[1:23:19] the same way he give it to
[1:23:21] you but the gift is for me to get out of
[1:23:23] the way so God can use me to help you
[1:23:25] figure out what you need to do that's
[1:23:27] why many times I'm preaching I go Plum
[1:23:29] off these notes I ain't got no idea
[1:23:30] which way I'm going evidently somebody
[1:23:32] needs to help with a part of their
[1:23:33] puzzle I didn't know I had to
[1:23:35] work yes sir glory to
[1:23:38] God I love this statement spok word see
[1:23:41] brother man said you could only serve
[1:23:42] God and do and believe the servant and
[1:23:45] believe the servants that God sends and
[1:23:47] you can only serve God on Earth see as
[1:23:50] God's servants sent on Earth by divine
[1:23:52] inspiration interprets a word to you so
[1:23:55] you can only serve God as the word is
[1:23:57] being interpreted to
[1:23:59] you false teachers produce false births
[1:24:03] true teachers produce true
[1:24:06] births why is it that the ministry is
[1:24:09] that important think of this statement
[1:24:11] if the blind lead the blind where do
[1:24:14] they wind up where the
[1:24:19] ditch leadership is so
[1:24:22] important that when it's bad it's it's
[1:24:24] real
[1:24:26] bad eternally separated from God
[1:24:29] bad but when it's good it's Rapture
[1:24:32] Ready Resurrection ready good amen amen
[1:24:36] good praise God
[1:24:40] Hallelujah in St John 12: 47 and
[1:24:45] 48 notice how Jesus speaks this if any
[1:24:49] man hear my words and believe not I
[1:24:51] judge him
[1:24:52] not for I can't not to judge the world
[1:24:55] but to save it he that rejecteth
[1:24:59] me receives not my words hath one that
[1:25:02] judgeth him the
[1:25:05] word that I have
[1:25:07] spoken the same shall judge
[1:25:10] him in the last
[1:25:13] day Jesus says I'm not even the one
[1:25:16] judging you can you imagine that the
[1:25:17] Virgin born son of God declaring I am
[1:25:20] not even the one that judges you it's
[1:25:22] what I'm preaching
[1:25:25] it goes to prove that you don't receive
[1:25:28] your judgment based on
[1:25:30] who but more based on
[1:25:36] what because if he's preaching the word
[1:25:40] that didn't come from me I didn't
[1:25:42] originate
[1:25:43] that the spoken word is not Ben's
[1:25:46] Original Seed it's God's originaly
[1:25:49] amen
[1:25:51] amen right therefore if are doing your
[1:25:55] homework your 50% and my 50% come
[1:25:59] together and then God not being just a
[1:26:01] god of the pull pit but a god of the
[1:26:05] audience then as the word Goes Forth and
[1:26:07] you find your place and you get stronger
[1:26:10] and closer in Christ then nine spiritual
[1:26:15] gifts begin operating in the
[1:26:18] church why because it's not just the
[1:26:22] preacher that spoke supposed to be
[1:26:25] spiritual but it's the wife that's
[1:26:27] supposed to be spiritual too he's the
[1:26:29] spiritual husband you are the spiritual
[1:26:34] wife
[1:26:36] why in all of the things that we preach
[1:26:38] in this
[1:26:40] message why don't we see more gifted
[1:26:42] people in our
[1:26:43] churches you know why we cut God off
[1:26:46] right
[1:26:48] here and the only way God can move
[1:26:51] amongst many of our churches is if you
[1:26:53] leave your seat and come up to where God
[1:26:57] is I got news for you people dedicated
[1:27:01] or not we're not even talking about that
[1:27:03] this ain't nothing but a block of wood
[1:27:05] and this ain't nothing but a pile of
[1:27:06] carpet wooden nails that ain't there
[1:27:09] ain't nothing but a bunch of fabric and
[1:27:10] steel and whatever it might be that
[1:27:12] ain't nothing but a bunch of sheetrock
[1:27:14] and in one moment's Swoop a a wrecking
[1:27:17] ball could send this thing right down
[1:27:20] flat it is not because this is a pull
[1:27:23] pit or because that is a pew pew that
[1:27:26] makes God more here than God there what
[1:27:29] if I just come preach out in the
[1:27:30] congregation I guess God comes with me
[1:27:32] then don't
[1:27:33] it you see what kind of nonsense people
[1:27:35] get in their mind they think just
[1:27:38] because the man is here that God can't
[1:27:40] be out there at the same time last I
[1:27:43] checked the Holy Spirit has the ability
[1:27:45] to be anywhere he wants to
[1:27:47] be like I said one time because God is
[1:27:50] omnicient and and omnipotent all the
[1:27:52] things but you can't put God in a box he
[1:27:56] don't dwell just in one certain place or
[1:27:58] everywhere at a time God goes where he
[1:28:00] wants to go amen appears where he wants
[1:28:03] to appear that's right and he promised
[1:28:05] where two and three are gathered I'll be
[1:28:07] right there in the
[1:28:09] midst right so why do I want to come to
[1:28:12] church because while I'm sitting in the
[1:28:14] house of God if I'm doing my
[1:28:17] 50% the preacher comes out of the office
[1:28:20] he sets up on his platform and he starts
[1:28:22] launching into the preaching of the word
[1:28:23] you do your your part and I do my part
[1:28:25] it's like hand and glove It just fits
[1:28:27] together
[1:28:29] perfectly not only ises it clean the
[1:28:31] church position the church and
[1:28:32] straighten people out get them in a spot
[1:28:34] to where they know what's
[1:28:36] right but it produces a spiritual
[1:28:39] atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can move
[1:28:41] amongst that body and Gifts can fall
[1:28:44] into them amen let me tell you something
[1:28:48] that little group I worked with back in
[1:28:49] Manchester when I used to do Bible
[1:28:51] studies brother Carol my pastor my old
[1:28:54] Pastor one before he retired he approved
[1:28:57] and sanctioned me doing them Bible
[1:28:58] studies on Monday night and listen he
[1:29:00] was an old man back then and he told me
[1:29:02] I'm not going to that church every
[1:29:04] Monday night I'm tired I get done
[1:29:06] preaching on Sunday I'm War slap out I
[1:29:08] want you to go teach them people I want
[1:29:11] you to teach them in my church I said
[1:29:12] fine eight years we went through every
[1:29:15] subject I buy them the books spoken R
[1:29:17] seed Christ is the mystery Daniel 70
[1:29:19] weeks adoption the Holy Ghost series
[1:29:21] Church age book we went through all of
[1:29:22] it I set him down on Monday night we go
[1:29:25] two
[1:29:26] hours we got to a certain place where
[1:29:29] all of that teaching was beginning to
[1:29:30] really move amongst that little 50
[1:29:32] sitting in that
[1:29:33] group then I started teaching on the
[1:29:36] gifts and showing how the gifts operate
[1:29:39] their proper place and how they operate
[1:29:42] you know what happened we come to the
[1:29:44] end of the service and I'd have somebody
[1:29:46] bow their head and pray to close out the
[1:29:49] service the Holy Ghost would fall in
[1:29:51] that little group and a spirit of God
[1:29:54] would come down people start crying
[1:29:56] somebody would start singing we'd start
[1:29:59] worshiping the Lord together and it
[1:30:00] wouldn't be a moment's time somebody
[1:30:01] would speak in tongues interpret and
[1:30:03] prophesy the very last meeting we had a
[1:30:06] sister spoke in tongues and interpreted
[1:30:08] her tongues and it became prophecy she
[1:30:10] told us exactly what they were going to
[1:30:12] do and how the the critics and the
[1:30:14] people that was trying to shut us down
[1:30:16] how they were going to do it and that
[1:30:17] they were on their way to do it it was
[1:30:19] going to happen to prepare oursel is
[1:30:20] going to
[1:30:21] happen within two weeks time they' done
[1:30:23] exactly what the sister prophesied to us
[1:30:25] not a one in that Bible study was
[1:30:26] shocked when it happened we had unheard
[1:30:28] the Lord tell us it was going to
[1:30:30] happen we'd watch God speak things and
[1:30:32] do things right amongst that little body
[1:30:35] sitting there like that I'd say now you
[1:30:37] we've been talking about these gifts for
[1:30:38] seven weeks now you with the gift of
[1:30:40] faith lay your hand on somebody next to
[1:30:42] you in that Bible study they'd lay their
[1:30:44] hands on one another and we would get
[1:30:46] reports and testimonies of people being
[1:30:47] healed sitting right there in those
[1:30:48] congregation I never laid my hand on
[1:30:52] them because we come to the Revelation
[1:30:54] that God is not just a god of the pull
[1:30:57] pit but he's a god of the audience as
[1:30:59] well somebody say
[1:31:01] amen that's the desire of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:05] is for you to find your
[1:31:06] place and let all things be done
[1:31:09] decently and in order if you give
[1:31:11] yourself to reading exhortation and
[1:31:13] Doctrine if you labor in the word of God
[1:31:17] you won't be deceived if you got the
[1:31:18] Holy Ghost so you don't have to worry
[1:31:20] about that you won't be misled if you're
[1:31:23] setting under the right Ministry and I
[1:31:24] believe you
[1:31:26] are I I say this as respectfully as I
[1:31:28] know how and I don't mean it to sound
[1:31:30] arrogant or facius or nothing like that
[1:31:33] I wouldn't align myself with these Smith
[1:31:35] boys if I didn't think they love God I
[1:31:38] wouldn't go help Cam and come my Jesse's
[1:31:40] way it's not not they think I'm better
[1:31:41] than anybody but I just mean it wouldn't
[1:31:43] do me any good to come by preach to
[1:31:46] people that being led in a completely
[1:31:48] different direction that'd be like me
[1:31:49] trying to book meetings out here in the
[1:31:51] Methodist Church it wouldn't work
[1:31:54] pastors got One Direction and the people
[1:31:56] have got another that's what I like
[1:31:57] about aligning myself and confederating
[1:32:00] myself with men that love the message in
[1:32:02] the Bible and love the people of God
[1:32:04] Amen then I know that every mile I spend
[1:32:06] on the road and every moment I take away
[1:32:09] it's all for the glory of God and it's
[1:32:12] not in vain Hallelujah but why do we
[1:32:14] come to church because that Ministry of
[1:32:18] God is there to compact us
[1:32:20] together and if we're doing our part
[1:32:22] when we come to church
[1:32:25] we'll be so fitly put together that
[1:32:28] Satan could put a razor blade between
[1:32:32] us that is the
[1:32:36] benefit of understanding the divine
[1:32:39] order of the church am why why do you
[1:32:43] pay your ties huh somebody say
[1:32:47] well I can't afford to pay ties you
[1:32:50] can't afford not
[1:32:51] to right brother there are so many
[1:32:55] things oh I guess I plagiarized that I
[1:32:56] didn't say that somebody else
[1:33:01] did but you can't say well I'm going to
[1:33:05] hold on to it I ain't giving it to that
[1:33:07] old
[1:33:08] preacher you might hand the monetary
[1:33:11] part of it over to a pastor but that
[1:33:14] ain't what you're paying to God what
[1:33:16] you're paying to God is the 10% of your
[1:33:19] loyalty to his
[1:33:21] truth when you hand over them little old
[1:33:23] bunch of balls in your pocket that they
[1:33:25] made into dollar bills that ain't got
[1:33:27] nothing to do with the Holy Ghost but
[1:33:30] when you pay your TI and your offerings
[1:33:32] you are
[1:33:34] testifying of the power of the Church of
[1:33:37] God that when little is much God is in
[1:33:40] it you know God could ask us to pay 90%
[1:33:43] instead of
[1:33:45] 10 imagine what kind of thing we'd have
[1:33:47] to be in our in our lives to pay 90%
[1:33:49] instead of 10 but you know God could let
[1:33:52] us live on 10% better than 90 and I'm
[1:33:55] convinced that we can live on the 90
[1:33:57] better than we can the 10 God just asked
[1:33:59] you to give out of every dollar 10
[1:34:02] cents but I know when you're in debt up
[1:34:05] to your eyeballs that's hard thing to do
[1:34:08] but I promise you as long as you refuse
[1:34:10] pay ties and offerings and do what
[1:34:11] you're supposed to do you're going to
[1:34:12] remain in debt you're remain in money
[1:34:14] problems all the days of your life and
[1:34:16] don't think it just affects your money
[1:34:17] it affects your walk with God too
[1:34:20] because the devour will come along and
[1:34:22] take your prayer life from you
[1:34:24] you've exposed yourself to him that old
[1:34:26] Locust that old Cricket he'll come by
[1:34:28] amen that that that that he he'll eat
[1:34:31] down your prayer life and your joy take
[1:34:33] everything away from you right and the
[1:34:36] Bible said you're living under a curse
[1:34:37] when you don't give him like you
[1:34:39] should now I don't believe brother Jesse
[1:34:42] is a dictator and no he didn't ask me to
[1:34:43] say such things but that's the beauty of
[1:34:46] being an evangelist I can preach on ties
[1:34:48] and go home smiling because I don't
[1:34:49] receive
[1:34:52] them but why do we do that think of that
[1:34:55] simple Act of just giving our 10% to
[1:34:58] God I understand you get in positions
[1:35:01] with money you know what I do
[1:35:03] sometimes sometimes I be preaching
[1:35:05] meetings and more be coming in when I
[1:35:06] can cash I can't get to the bank to cash
[1:35:08] them sometimes so I've got a little
[1:35:11] Excel file on my computer brother Jesse
[1:35:13] and I write in how much I write who it
[1:35:15] was and I put the offering in the in the
[1:35:17] in the tithe that I owe and I keep a
[1:35:20] little log of it whenever I get a chance
[1:35:22] to get over to the bank can get it all
[1:35:24] collected and man I go out there and I
[1:35:27] maybe some brother pay me a cash offer
[1:35:28] and I take that money and I I maybe I
[1:35:30] owe $300 in ties or whatever it is I
[1:35:32] take that money in sticket right in an
[1:35:33] envelope and I go walk up and I hand it
[1:35:35] to my
[1:35:37] pastor I've never in 21 years had to beg
[1:35:41] anybody to give me anything in any
[1:35:43] church I've preached in because I pay my
[1:35:46] tie and my offerings and it ain't going
[1:35:48] to start tonight and it ain't going to
[1:35:49] start in a year from now because I
[1:35:51] continue to pay my tithe and my
[1:35:53] offerings I got news for you it is an
[1:35:55] inflation proof
[1:36:00] plan but think about it why do we do it
[1:36:04] why the simple thing of giving tithes
[1:36:07] and offerings it's stupid in a way CU
[1:36:10] God need with it he owns a cattle on a
[1:36:12] thousand
[1:36:14] Hells you're testifying of your
[1:36:17] loyalty you're showing God I'm going to
[1:36:20] be faithful to what I'm doing all right
[1:36:22] let's take it a little further why come
[1:36:23] to church then well you know the service
[1:36:27] is always kind of slow and old brother
[1:36:29] Jesse he teaches sometimes and
[1:36:31] everybody's tired and we get quiet
[1:36:34] why you're at church why don't you make
[1:36:36] some
[1:36:41] noise maybe you being the noise maker
[1:36:44] would change the other ones in the noise
[1:36:48] makers praise the
[1:36:50] Lord right but a lot of
[1:36:54] times we reject the
[1:36:57] idea that we have any value in the house
[1:37:01] of
[1:37:03] God I know how people are well I'm just
[1:37:05] a little quiet person I I know I've said
[1:37:09] this to you before let allow me to just
[1:37:12] beare with me to repeat it again you
[1:37:15] could be the most backward person in the
[1:37:16] world and God still move on you to speak
[1:37:18] in tongues interpret
[1:37:19] prophesy in the church
[1:37:21] ages slow
[1:37:25] backward bashful juny Jackson Jun we' be
[1:37:30] out fishing he talk so slow I said juny
[1:37:33] let me finish it for you I can get it
[1:37:34] out quicker than you
[1:37:36] can but then to hear him rattling off
[1:37:39] this morning in tongue's
[1:37:41] interpretation it goes to prove God work
[1:37:43] against your own
[1:37:45] nature if you understand the value of
[1:37:47] coming to church amen your liquor fire
[1:37:52] your pool is needed to make this
[1:37:56] ministry
[1:37:58] work Jesse is not Jesse without you and
[1:38:02] the minute that you think that you don't
[1:38:04] have any value in this church at all if
[1:38:07] you'll put your part faithful I believe
[1:38:09] that the entire church paid tithes and
[1:38:11] offerings and showed up faithfully and
[1:38:12] did their 50% and done their homework
[1:38:14] and come to church faithful in a year's
[1:38:17] time you'd have such Revival happening
[1:38:19] in this place till you couldn't even
[1:38:20] hardly believe the changes it would make
[1:38:22] even from where you you are right
[1:38:25] now you don't need a big number of
[1:38:28] people to make big
[1:38:29] movements there's enough people in this
[1:38:31] place right here to go out and pick up a
[1:38:33] whole car and move
[1:38:34] it hello we could go out all of us and
[1:38:37] go pick up Jesse's van and move it to
[1:38:39] the other side of the parking lot we got
[1:38:41] enough people to do that because if we
[1:38:43] bore the load with one another we'd have
[1:38:45] the strength and the ability to move
[1:38:46] great things you don't need a great big
[1:38:49] pile of people in order to make
[1:38:50] something happen and God don't need
[1:38:52] millions and millions millions of
[1:38:53] dollars in a bank account someone other
[1:38:55] to make great things happen God knows
[1:38:58] how to bless you bless the church and
[1:39:00] bless you in every effort you make as
[1:39:02] long as you keep your eyes single and
[1:39:04] your focus on why you come here in the
[1:39:07] first
[1:39:12] place and there's a movement in the
[1:39:15] message and it's been here for many many
[1:39:18] years and it was said by one of our
[1:39:20] great
[1:39:21] leaders God never at any time time ever
[1:39:23] use the five-fold ministry to do
[1:39:26] anything all the generations that we've
[1:39:28] had of church ages there's been
[1:39:30] evangelists and teachers and pastors and
[1:39:32] Prophets Apostles and Men of God and
[1:39:34] churches and people all over the place
[1:39:35] doing things worshiping the Lord and
[1:39:37] singing songs and on and on and on and
[1:39:40] all of a sudden we get up here to the
[1:39:41] last day and now we hear amongst our own
[1:39:43] ranks don't even go to
[1:39:45] church your best at home push play and I
[1:39:50] got news for you I disagree with that
[1:39:53] but I also disagree with people staying
[1:39:55] home and clicking play on somebody's
[1:39:57] website or somebody's Church stream or
[1:39:59] somebody's El I don't agree with you
[1:40:01] staying home less than anybody else
[1:40:03] either you got a pastor you should
[1:40:05] support that
[1:40:07] Pastor that's the way God wants it and
[1:40:11] that is the benefit of coming to the
[1:40:12] house of God does this do this help you
[1:40:14] tonight amen stand with me will you
[1:40:18] let's close up come let's bow our heads
[1:40:22] together can we
[1:40:31] with the many voices in the
[1:40:34] land all we want to hear is the voice of
[1:40:37] the Lord
[1:40:40] Jesus so with your heads bowed
[1:40:43] tonight I'm not going to ask you to
[1:40:45] raise your hand but in your
[1:40:47] heart you know you haven't been faithful
[1:40:49] to the things you need to be and you you
[1:40:52] you hear what I've been preaching to you
[1:40:53] and you know that you're just as guilty
[1:40:55] as you can be on some of these matters I
[1:40:58] I I don't want you to raise your hand up
[1:41:00] and make some kind of a show you already
[1:41:02] know in your heart what's right and what
[1:41:06] ain't but why don't you just tell the
[1:41:08] Lord while you're standing just repent
[1:41:09] say God I'm
[1:41:11] sorry forgive me Lord I've I've taken it
[1:41:14] too laxidasical I've been too slack on
[1:41:17] these
[1:41:19] things and Lord I want to be faithful to
[1:41:21] you
[1:41:23] I want to increase my attendance I want
[1:41:25] to increase my offerings and my tithings
[1:41:27] to the Lord I want to increase my
[1:41:30] contributions to the
[1:41:32] church there's nobody that's saying amen
[1:41:35] I'll be the one there's nobody praying
[1:41:38] for someone at the altar I'll pray with
[1:41:40] them whatever the little body
[1:41:42] needs I want to put my shoulder to the
[1:41:45] wheel and have a spirit of
[1:41:47] cooperation a voluntary Spirit of
[1:41:51] cooperation
[1:41:53] then maybe Lord Jesus maybe you'll help
[1:41:56] me just to get over whatever complex or
[1:41:58] fear I might have that I can find my
[1:42:01] place and stay in
[1:42:04] it Lord wherever that is that you would
[1:42:06] call me I want to be faithful to that
[1:42:10] just tell the Lord that in your heart
[1:42:11] and just say Lord I'm sorry forgive me
[1:42:14] forgive me for overlooking the important
[1:42:16] things of the
[1:42:19] Gospel now Lord there's so much in there
[1:42:21] what I've said tonight
[1:42:24] Lord Jesus there's no way I can break it
[1:42:26] all down but I've at least been able to
[1:42:28] scratch the surface enough to get a
[1:42:30] point
[1:42:31] across so forgive me Lord for the
[1:42:34] limitation of time that we have here
[1:42:36] tonight may you make up and redeem all
[1:42:40] the time that I didn't have tonight to
[1:42:42] be able to express this fully because
[1:42:45] truthfully Lord it took another two or
[1:42:46] three hours to break down some of these
[1:42:48] scriptures and things I've got up here
[1:42:50] to go into each little element of it it
[1:42:52] take a month almost to break it down

[1:42:57] I've got on this Sunday like
[1:43:00] this lord I can't take all the people's
[1:43:03] time but Lord whatever I've been able to

[1:43:11] gaps that I couldn't reach tonight Lord
