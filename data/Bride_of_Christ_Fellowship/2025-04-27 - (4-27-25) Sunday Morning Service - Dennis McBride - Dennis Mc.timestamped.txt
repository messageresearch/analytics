[0:00] knows the faults of every single person
[0:04] around the world at the same time. Yes,
[0:07] sir. Yes, sir.
[0:13] That's mindblowing. Yes, sir. Praise
[0:15] God. You know, but yet it's true. So,
[0:19] that means he's actually he's very
[0:21] mindful and considerate of each
[0:24] individual. Thank you, Jesus. Yes. He
[0:27] knows every circumstance, every
[0:29] situation in everybody's life in detail.
[0:35] Amen.
[0:37] And he cares.
[0:40] Amen. Hallelujah. Glory. He wants to do
[0:43] something about it. He wants to help. He
[0:46] wants to encourage. He wants to uplift.
[0:48] He wants to heal. Amen. Yes, Lord. He
[0:52] wants to set free. Hallelujah.
[0:55] Amen. Wow. And he loves us.
[1:00] Yes. I know the devil comes with his
[1:02] chatter.
[1:03] You know, he chatters in our ears and
[1:06] our spirits at times and tries to make
[1:08] us feel like we're the furthest from
[1:09] God.
[1:11] Amen. But that's the furthest from the
[1:13] truth. That's right. That's right.
[1:15] Praise God. Because the kind of love
[1:16] that he has is not conditional. That's
[1:20] right. You understand? is not based upon
[1:23] how good we are
[1:25] because the Bible says that he died for
[1:27] us. It says he commended his love toward
[1:30] us. Meaning it can be clearly seen in
[1:32] the fact that when we were yet sinners,
[1:34] he died for the ungodly. Praise God.
[1:36] Hallelujah. So how much more now that
[1:38] we've turned to him by his grace. Yes.
[1:42] Amen.
[1:43] So don't be discouraged, saints. Be
[1:46] encouraged. Amen. Yes. And may the Lord
[1:49] help us to always be reminded of his
[1:51] love for us. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:55] Amen. Let us bow. Heavenly
[1:57] Father, we thank you for allowing us to
[1:59] be here. We thank you, Lord, for all
[2:02] that you've done in each one of our
[2:04] lives and all that you continue to do
[2:06] and all that you will do. Lord, Father,
[2:09] everything is already set. You're not
[2:12] making plans along the way. Amen. and
[2:16] all provisions are already set, Lord.
[2:18] There's just times and seasons for us to
[2:20] enter into what you already had planned
[2:22] for us,
[2:23] Father. So, Lord, help our hearts to be
[2:26] settled and our minds to become focused.
[2:30] We need you, Lord. Yes, sir. This is
[2:32] your time. We are your people. None of
[2:35] us are able to do anything on our own,
[2:37] Lord. We're looking to you right now.
[2:40] Hallelujah. Have your way. We pray in
[2:42] the mighty name of our Lord and Savior
[2:44] Jesus Christ. We ask all these things
[2:47] and we pray. Let the church say amen.
[2:50] Amen. Praise God. Let's turn in our
[2:53] Bibles if we
[2:54] will to the book of Proverbs, chapter 4.
[3:07] We definitely thank God for Brother
[3:10] Jesse and his wife and his family. It's
[3:13] been they all have been a just a
[3:16] blessing to my heart. Um even even just
[3:19] in memory, you know, when I just
[3:21] remember them and think about them, it
[3:24] just it's an
[3:25] encouragement, you know, to be able to
[3:27] have genuine real people that love God
[3:30] and that love you. Amen. you know, uh
[3:34] it's a blessing and God brings those
[3:37] things into each one of our lives to
[3:39] help us in our hearts.
[3:42] How many realize that true friends come
[3:44] from the Lord?
[3:46] That's true. And you can feel the
[3:49] effects of it. That's right.
[3:52] Praise God. Starting at verse 10, it
[3:54] says, "Hear, oh my son, and receive my
[3:58] sayings, and the years of thy life shall
[4:01] be
[4:02] many." So that's a promise, right? Yes,
[4:07] it's a promise. If we hear his word and
[4:09] pay attention to it, allow it to be a
[4:12] focal point. Verse 11, I have taught
[4:15] thee in the way of wisdom. I have led
[4:17] thee in right paths. When thou goest,
[4:20] thy step shall not be shall not be
[4:23] straightened. And when thou runest, thou
[4:26] shalt not stumble. Gy, he says, take
[4:29] fast hold of
[4:31] instruction. Let her not go. Keep her,
[4:35] for she is thy life.
[4:38] Enter not into the path of the wicked,
[4:40] and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid
[4:44] it, pass not by it, turn from it, and
[4:48] pass away. So that means steer
[4:51] completely clear. Amen. Of the
[4:53] appearance of evil. Amen. Yes, sir.
[4:56] Amen.
[4:58] It says for verse 16, for thy sleep, for
[5:02] they sleep not except they have done
[5:05] mischief, and their sleep is taken away,
[5:08] unless they cause some to fall. For they
[5:11] eat the bread of wickedness, and drink
[5:14] the wine of violence. But the path of
[5:17] the just is as the shining light, that
[5:20] shineth more and more until the perfect
[5:23] day. The way of the wicked is as
[5:25] darkness. They know not at what they
[5:28] stumble. My son, and these are my
[5:31] focuses here, saints, attend to my
[5:34] words. Incline thine ear unto my
[5:38] sayings. Let them not depart from thine
[5:42] eyes. Keep them in the midst of thine
[5:44] heart. Yes. For they are life unto those
[5:48] that find them and health to all their
[5:52] flesh.
[5:54] Amen. It says, "Keep thy heart with all
[5:57] diligence." That means you got to work
[6:00] at that.
[6:01] And the reason why is because there's
[6:04] someone there's a whole army of darkness
[6:08] that's constantly trying to penetrate,
[6:11] right? They're trying to take control,
[6:14] right? They're trying to influence. So
[6:17] it says, "Keep thine heart with all
[6:19] diligence, for out of it are the issues
[6:21] of life. Put away from thee a forward
[6:24] mouth, forward mouth, and perverse lips
[6:27] put far from thee. Let thine eyes look
[6:31] right on, and let thine eyelids look
[6:34] straight before thee. Ponder the path of
[6:37] thy feet, and let all thy ways be
[6:40] established. Turn not to the right hand,
[6:42] nor to the left. Remove thy foot from
[6:46] evil. May the Lord bless the reading of
[6:48] his word, saints, you may be seated.
[6:52] And as you're being seated, I'm going to
[6:54] go to another scripture here. Matthew
[6:56] chapter 6.
[6:59] I believe it goes very well with what we
[7:02] just
[7:04] read and it's a very important message
[7:07] within
[7:08] this that's applicable to our everyday
[7:11] lives. Hallelujah.
[7:15] Amen. Matthew 6, I want to start at
[7:17] verse
[7:20] 22. It says, "The light of the body is
[7:23] the what?
[7:25] The eye. If therefore thine eye be
[7:29] single, thy whole body shall be full of
[7:32] light. But if thine eye be evil, thy
[7:36] whole body shall be full of
[7:38] darkness. If therefore the light that is
[7:41] in thee be
[7:42] darkness, how great is that
[7:47] darkness? And it's an exclamation point
[7:50] behind that.
[7:56] And it was very interesting me to me
[7:58] saints in verse
[8:00] 24 that it comes and says
[8:04] this no man can serve two masters. So he
[8:08] talks
[8:09] about what you're looking at right yes
[8:14] and he talks about the effects of what
[8:17] you allow yourself to look
[8:19] at. And in the near the very next verse,
[8:23] he says, "No man can serve two
[8:26] masters." So what you look at is
[8:29] connected to what rules you. Very good.
[8:36] Whether you realize it or not, what you
[8:39] give attention to is connected to the
[8:43] power that you allow to dominate your
[8:46] life.
[8:48] That's good.
[8:50] No man can serve two masters. And notice
[8:52] this now. This is so
[8:55] true. This is so true, saints. For
[8:59] either he will hate the one and love the
[9:03] other, or else he will hold to the one
[9:06] and do what? And despise the other. It
[9:11] says, "Ye cannot serve God and
[9:15] mammon.
[9:26] Naturally amongst most people
[9:29] naturally no one will say I hate God
[9:35] or I despise God.
[9:42] But your actions speak a different
[9:44] language. That's right.
[9:47] As far as what God
[9:49] sees in your actions, in your
[9:54] words, he sees that they hate me.
[9:58] They despise
[10:04] me. And that means
[10:07] that cuz he says you will either hate
[10:09] the one and do what? love the
[10:13] other. Nobody will say that they love
[10:16] Satan,
[10:18] Jesus. My
[10:24] But your
[10:27] actions communicate to Satan that you
[10:30] actually love him.
[10:36] This is just striking to me right now,
[10:38] saints. Yes.
[10:42] How many how many mistakes have we
[10:45] made? How many decisions have we
[10:50] made and not even
[10:52] realizing that this is what is
[10:54] communicating to our Lord?
[10:59] You know, we just kind of and this is
[11:02] how the enemy would have it to
[11:05] be. He would
[11:07] have I'mma call it a moment of weakness
[11:11] to be very lightly
[11:13] esteemed. Oh, it's not that bad, you
[11:18] know. It's just, you know, just a
[11:20] little, you know, just a little
[11:21] something, you know. You just kind of
[11:23] just It ain't that bad. It ain't going
[11:26] to hurt nothing, you know.
[11:30] But it's far worse than that. Yes, sir.
[11:32] Yes, sir.
[11:35] So this morning by the grace of God I
[11:37] want to deal with a topic overall of
[11:39] focus.
[11:42] Focus.
[11:44] Now those same verses in Matthew I want
[11:46] to read to you those verses out of the
[11:48] Amplified
[11:49] Bible. Just has a little different
[11:52] wording to it that kind of sometimes
[11:54] helps to capture the meaning of what's
[11:58] being expressed. Same verses starting at
[12:01] verse 22 amplified. It says the eye is
[12:04] the lamp of the body. So if your eye is
[12:08] clear, it says spiritually
[12:11] perceptive. It says your whole body will
[12:14] be full of light, meaning benefiting
[12:16] from the from God's
[12:19] precepts. So now what you read
[12:24] or what you listen to or what you watch,
[12:29] right? Yes. There is a power, a
[12:32] spiritual
[12:33] power that's connected to those things.
[12:38] Yes, sir. So that means when you read
[12:40] something, when you look at something,
[12:42] or when you listen to something, the
[12:45] spirit behind it, the source spirit
[12:48] behind those things, you actually allow
[12:51] those spirits to come in you.
[12:54] That's right. Can we say praise the
[12:57] Lord? My my my
[13:00] I'm not going to rush this morning.
[13:04] This is Listen, this right here
[13:06] determines the level of victory or
[13:09] defeat we walk in daily.
[13:12] Yes. Yes.
[13:15] So, right now, if you feel praise God,
[13:18] right now if you feel as though you're
[13:21] living a defeated life, if you see
[13:25] defeat within your life, meaning you see
[13:29] where the enemy has been able to
[13:31] overcome you, right? Please believe,
[13:34] please understand that you you you gave
[13:37] place to that defeat down some avenue.
[13:42] Amen. This is where you have to be
[13:44] extremely honest with yourself.
[13:49] You understand what I'm saying? This,
[13:51] you know, cuz demons come in and they
[13:53] bring deception
[13:55] and then and demons love to bring a
[13:57] person to a place of deflection,
[14:01] right? They see everything and everybody
[14:04] else as being the problem but
[14:05] themselves.
[14:09] Amen. Amen. Right.
[14:12] But how we live our lives, what our
[14:14] lives begin to be molded into is a
[14:17] direct reflection of what we open up
[14:20] ourselves to.
[14:22] That's why the Bible says the eye of the
[14:26] body, I mean how it says the light of
[14:29] the body is the eye. If therefore thine
[14:32] eye be single, thy whole body shall be
[14:34] full of light.
[14:37] What's being single means? What we just
[14:40] read in
[14:41] Proverbs? Focusing on the
[14:44] Lord. Keeping your mind on the things of
[14:47] God. Amen. Amen. On a daily basis,
[14:52] right? There's so much out here to do
[14:54] what, saints? To distract us.
[14:59] And within that distraction, Amen.
[15:03] defeat comes down that channel.
[15:06] So in our individual lives, let us
[15:08] really deeply consider what are we
[15:11] giving ourselves over to.
[15:14] It's not enough just to come to church.
[15:16] That's right. Yes, sir. Can we say
[15:18] praise the Lord, saints? It's not enough
[15:21] to look the part. It's not enough to
[15:24] talk the part. Amen. We want to be
[15:26] right. We want to be Christians. We want
[15:29] God. We want to invite God to come into
[15:32] our lives and take full control and make
[15:35] us into what we ought to be. We don't
[15:37] have to accept anything less than that.
[15:40] The grace of God and the blood of God
[15:42] and the and and and the love of God is
[15:44] so abundant. Hallelujah. Amen. We don't
[15:47] have to to to to uh to entertain or or
[15:51] or to be accepting of any lower level.
[15:54] Don't let your sights be lowered because
[15:57] of maybe the amount of mistakes you've
[15:59] made up until this point. No, it's still
[16:02] for you. It's accessible to each one of
[16:04] us. God made the way that plain and that
[16:07] good for us. And no matter what state in
[16:11] in my ministering what I'm ministering
[16:13] on right now, saints, please don't be
[16:15] discouraged by any means because now is
[16:17] the time of grace. Amen. Seek the Lord
[16:20] while he is yet able to be found. Amen.
[16:23] If we see areas in our lives that are
[16:25] not quite right, Amen. God is able to
[16:27] come in and make it right.
[16:33] But we have to open the door.
[16:38] And once we open the
[16:41] door, we can't close any other door
[16:46] within that
[16:47] door. If we invite God in, Lord, you
[16:51] come and come into any area of my life
[16:53] that that you see
[16:56] fit to help me, Lord, to become better
[16:59] and to be healed in all these needful
[17:03] ways. Amen. Amen.
[17:08] Verse 23 amplified. But if your eye is
[17:11] bad, spiritually
[17:13] blind, your whole body will be full of
[17:16] darkness, devoid of God's precepts. So
[17:20] if the very light inside you, your inner
[17:23] self, your heart, your conscience is
[17:25] darkness, how great and terrible is that
[17:29] darkness. No man can serve two masters.
[17:31] For either he will hate the one and love
[17:33] the other, or he will he will be devoted
[17:36] to the one and despise the other. You
[17:39] cannot serve God and mammon, money,
[17:41] possessions, fame, status, and whatever
[17:43] is valued more than the Lord.
[17:48] Hallelujah.
[17:50] So, let's just think to ourselves for a
[17:53] moment on a daily
[17:56] basis, what is it that we give our most
[17:59] time to?
[18:01] Yes, sir.
[18:05] How often do
[18:07] we I'm going say really get into the
[18:09] word of God. Yes, sir. Do we set aside
[18:13] time for that? Everybody say they so
[18:16] busy,
[18:18] you
[18:20] know, but if you really want to do
[18:23] something, you will make time for it.
[18:26] Amen.
[18:28] And when it comes to God, you know, God
[18:31] wants quality time.
[18:34] He don't want just a rushed
[18:37] moment. You think about a husband and a
[18:39] wife, right? the husband or the wife may
[18:43] have a desire to spend time or talk with
[18:45] their significant other and
[18:47] whatever, you know, and and and and and
[18:49] and what if when that time
[18:52] comes the one or the other, it just
[18:55] seems like they're trying to hurry up
[18:57] and get it get it through. Hurry up and
[18:59] get it done, right? You know, they keep
[19:02] you know, man, it's it's it's been 15
[19:04] minutes now. You know, you about
[19:07] done. You got anything else you want to
[19:09] say?
[19:11] How would that make you feel?
[19:14] Huh? Then when it comes to God, people
[19:17] want a time.
[19:20] I understand we got to live life and
[19:22] whatever, but what's more
[19:24] important? There's some things that he
[19:27] want to, you
[19:28] know, there's things that God want to
[19:31] show
[19:31] us. But God can see where we are in our
[19:35] spirits. He sees where our hearts are.
[19:39] You understand? man. He He He wants us
[19:40] to want to be with him. And then and and
[19:44] when we get into his presence, Amen. He
[19:46] don't want us to even consider time.
[19:49] He's mindful of us. If some if there's
[19:51] something important enough to do, God,
[19:53] he he wants us to take care of it. But
[19:56] when it comes to his time, he wants
[19:58] ample time. He He wants to be the caller
[20:01] of when it ends.
[20:03] So as we sit down to read his
[20:06] word, how quality of a time is
[20:10] that? And as I say these things, listen,
[20:13] our lives tell the story. Because if
[20:15] your eye is single and the things that
[20:17] you'll be holding, listening to, or
[20:19] watching are all coming from God, it's
[20:21] going to reflect in our lives.
[20:26] We'll become more and more in his image.
[20:30] Can we say praise the Lord? Praise God.
[20:32] Hallelujah. But on the other
[20:35] hand, if we're giving more time to other
[20:39] things, they don't necessarily have to
[20:41] be sin sinful things, just things that
[20:45] make you idle in your spirit and in your
[20:47] progression. That's right.
[20:55] That brings me to a certain point here.
[21:02] Amen. 1 Corinthians chapter 7 starting
[21:06] at verse
[21:14] 35. 1 Corinthians 7 starting at verse
[21:20] 35. It says, "In this I speak for your
[21:23] own
[21:25] profit, not that I may cast a snare upon
[21:29] you, but for that which is
[21:32] calmly, and that ye may do what?" Attend
[21:36] upon the Lord without distraction.
[21:43] Now, this is this is not just merely a
[21:45] man named Paul expressing this. This is
[21:48] God expressing his desire through his
[21:51] servant. Something that he he saw was
[21:54] needful not just for the group at this
[21:57] time that's going to that were that that
[21:59] were recipients of this message to hear
[22:01] but for those that was coming beyond
[22:04] that point for thousands of years.
[22:08] Right? This is a very important message.
[22:10] God wants us to be able to give him
[22:12] attention without distraction.
[22:16] He wants our focus to remain on him
[22:21] daily in the way that he desires for it
[22:23] to be.
[22:25] The prophet comes here in the message of
[22:27] of of the oneness of unity. He says
[22:30] empty is
[22:34] idleness. He says that's what's the
[22:36] matter with the converts today. As soon
[22:39] as you get converted, you start idling
[22:41] around.
[22:43] He says, "You ought to be over there on
[22:46] your knees seeking God for for um for
[22:49] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be
[22:52] filled up." He says, "Then you've got a
[22:55] wall." He says, "His blessing presence
[22:57] with you." And when the enemy comes in
[22:59] like the lion in the den that night with
[23:02] Daniel, the light of God shines out and
[23:05] he gets away from you. He says, "If the
[23:07] good man of the house hasn't gotten it
[23:12] garrisoned," praise the Lord.
[23:15] He says, "So idling around is not a good
[23:18] thing. Make good use of your time."
[23:21] Amen. In the morning time, I I know
[23:24] we're witnesses of that. When you allow
[23:27] God to be the leading factor in your
[23:30] day, isn't it a difference? Yes.
[23:33] Hallelujah. It's not that life doesn't
[23:35] happen. It's not like it's it's not that
[23:38] unfortunate things don't occur or
[23:39] whatever, but when we allow God to be
[23:42] the leading factor into our days, it
[23:44] just helps our response, our reactions,
[23:47] our thought processes. Yes, sir. Yes,
[23:50] sir. Amen. To be more spiritual and less
[23:53] carnal. Hallelujah. Can we say praise
[23:56] the Lord?
[23:57] When you when you give God that place in
[23:59] your life, listen now, as we read God's
[24:02] word and spend time in prayer, there is
[24:05] an influence. Amen. His spirit, it
[24:07] actually is able to increase
[24:10] inside of our lives. And I remember an
[24:13] instance where brother Brandham's wife
[24:15] was sitting next to I believe an Amish
[24:17] woman or a Midianite woman
[24:19] or what's the right word? Menite.
[24:23] Menite. Praise God. She was sitting next
[24:26] to her sister, right? And not a word was
[24:30] exchanged, I don't believe. But yet, yet
[24:33] yet there was a presence that was there
[24:37] to the point that it so affected sister
[24:40] Brandham. She made a comment to brother
[24:42] Brandham and says that
[24:44] sister, you can tell that she was in the
[24:47] presence of the Lord. Hallelujah. He
[24:50] talked about she talked about how her
[24:52] eyes were clear. There was no hidden sin
[24:55] behind there. Amen. There was a sweet
[24:59] presence. Hallelujah. Amen. That was
[25:02] just it it created an atmosphere.
[25:05] Saints, how many realize that when you
[25:06] allow God to have first place in your
[25:08] life, it creates an atmosphere that can
[25:11] be felt
[25:13] and picked up on by other people. That's
[25:15] not the focal point. But at the same
[25:17] time, that's what happens. But on the
[25:19] other hand, if you haven't been in the
[25:21] presence of the Lord, but in the
[25:23] presence of a demon spirit, those things
[25:25] also. That's right, brother. That's
[25:27] right.
[25:30] Hallelujah.
[25:32] I want to be careful in how I say this.
[25:38] One characteristic of evil
[25:41] spirits, and you can see it in the
[25:43] animal kingdom as
[25:46] well, they like to try to isolate their
[25:51] prey. If they're in a pack or in a
[25:55] group,
[25:57] they like to try to somehow catch them
[25:59] at a point
[26:04] where they're more by themselves.
[26:09] It tries to kind of allure them in that
[26:11] way or lead them in that way. Right? And
[26:14] one characteristic that I find of evil
[26:16] spirits, they always try to cause the
[26:19] person that they overcome to isolate
[26:22] themselves,
[26:24] to want to get away from the saints, get
[26:27] away from the right influences. Yes,
[26:29] sir. But be but but it comes in such a
[26:32] reasoning way until it like it almost
[26:35] justifies it.
[26:37] you know, by whatever perspective that
[26:39] is able to kind of embed in that
[26:40] person's spirit, it makes them feel like
[26:43] it's better for them to be away from
[26:45] people. Oh my.
[26:47] Not knowing that's the very trap of the
[26:49] enemy.
[26:51] Amen. Because God is in his body.
[26:54] I wanted to deal with something on this
[26:56] morning. I didn't have a chance to.
[26:58] Amen. But God is literally Oh my. God is
[27:01] literally here in the flesh.
[27:05] People are looking for Christ to come,
[27:07] but he's already here. He's in bride
[27:10] form.
[27:15] People say, "If I was living in the days
[27:16] of the Bible or whatever, you know, I
[27:18] would be wherever Christ was. I would go
[27:20] and listen to him or whatever. My
[27:22] response and my reactions would be this,
[27:24] that, and the other." And you have that
[27:26] opportunity right now. Hallelujah. And
[27:29] don't even realize it. Hallelujah. He's
[27:32] veiled
[27:34] right among us right now in this room.
[27:39] Amen.
[27:41] You know where the blessing comes in at,
[27:43] saints, is when God enables you to be
[27:45] able to recognize his presence.
[27:48] Hallelujah.
[27:49] Amen.
[27:53] We're living in the days of the Bible
[27:55] right now.
[27:57] You know how many people walked past
[27:59] Jesus when he was on earth
[28:02] and didn't even they didn't feel
[28:03] nothing.
[28:05] He was just just walked right past
[28:09] walked right past them.
[28:11] Maybe spoke to them. Didn't feel
[28:14] nothing. Didn't pick up on nothing. But
[28:16] those that were
[28:18] blessed. Amen. Those that were enabled
[28:21] by God to be able to see beyond the
[28:23] flesh of a man.
[28:26] They were able to see God. And then when
[28:28] you're able to see him, you're able to
[28:30] draw benefits.
[28:33] Hallelujah.
[28:35] It's the bride coming of Christ. Amen.
[28:38] He's increasing his presence within his
[28:40] people.
[28:42] You understand what I'm saying, right?
[28:44] Listen. I mean,
[28:45] I It's so striking to
[28:49] me. The bride is coming to the place to
[28:52] where she realized who she is.
[28:56] But it's so
[28:57] simple and it's so humble
[29:01] and many are walking right past it and
[29:03] missing it. Still looking for something
[29:05] to come. Glory to God. And it's right
[29:09] here, right now.
[29:17] But if your eye is not single,
[29:21] Amen. Amen. If the influence of God is
[29:25] minimal in your life, Amen. then just
[29:29] like the Bible says, when your eyes
[29:30] evil, that means you're focusing in on
[29:33] other stuff. Things that are not
[29:35] profiting you, things that are keeping
[29:37] you idle, things that don't don't don't
[29:39] don't um contribute to your progression
[29:42] in the things of God, in your journey
[29:44] with God as being a child of God. Amen.
[29:46] Is hindrances.
[29:49] Amen. our phones and and the media, you
[29:52] know, uh uh forms forms of media and
[29:54] stuff we have, they they can be used by
[29:56] the enemy to be hindrances.
[29:59] That's right.
[30:01] Amen.
[30:05] My my
[30:07] my. It says in 2 Timothy chapter
[30:11] 2
[30:14] verse4 it says no man that
[30:17] warth it says entangleth himself with
[30:20] the affairs of this
[30:23] life.
[30:25] Why? It says that he may please him who
[30:29] have chosen him to be a
[30:32] soldier. You have to be in this life.
[30:35] you have to deal with business and
[30:37] things of that nature. And I want to I
[30:40] want to make sure this is
[30:42] clear. We are not we're not capable on
[30:45] our own to come to these places of real
[30:49] decisions on our own to make the best
[30:51] decision that need to be made on our
[30:53] own. We need influence. We need
[30:56] guidance. Amen. Amen. Too many people
[30:59] trust too much in themselves.
[31:05] Amen. You know how sometimes, you know,
[31:08] you know, you know, somebody want to
[31:10] make a certain decision or whatever,
[31:11] right? And and and and you you ask him,
[31:14] "Did you pray about it?" Oh, yeah. I
[31:16] prayed about
[31:18] it. But if you were able to be a fly on
[31:21] the wall
[31:22] somehow, huh, and be able to watch that
[31:26] person's daily routine. Amen.
[31:30] I wonder how much of a different story
[31:32] will that make or tell versus what the
[31:35] individual is proclaiming.
[31:38] Have you prayed about that? Oh yeah, I
[31:40] prayed about it. Knowing knowing that
[31:42] we're not going to question that. You
[31:44] say you prayed about it. Okay, you
[31:45] prayed about it. But you know how much
[31:47] time you put into it
[31:50] and for the decisions that you need to
[31:52] make. Amen. How much didn't God say? He
[31:56] says, "Now trust in the Lord with all
[31:57] thine heart."
[31:59] and lean not to what?
[32:03] So, let's just pause on that that little
[32:06] phrase right there, your own
[32:08] understanding. What does that mean?
[32:14] Praise God. Yes.
[32:17] If he's saying, "Trust in him with all
[32:19] your heart and lean
[32:21] not to your own
[32:23] understanding," that means that there is
[32:26] something that's controlling your
[32:27] thoughts.
[32:30] And if you're not where you need to be,
[32:32] you won't realize that something is
[32:34] controlling your thoughts. You will
[32:36] think it, we've been talking about this,
[32:38] you will think it's just you. How many
[32:40] people think that the thoughts that come
[32:42] in their mind are just their thoughts?
[32:48] Think about this for a moment. When
[32:51] Jesus had
[32:52] fasted and afterward was tempted by the
[32:55] devil, was the devil there in a physical
[33:00] form?
[33:02] Huh? Was he there in a physical form
[33:05] talking to Jesus? He's a spirit,
[33:08] right? So he was talking to Jesus in the
[33:11] spirit realm and Jesus was hearing him
[33:13] in the spirit realm.
[33:17] Can we say praise the Lord? When God
[33:19] talks to us, do you see do you see a
[33:21] physical person standing in front of
[33:23] you?
[33:25] But yet it's thoughts. Glory to God.
[33:29] Coming from a person.
[33:33] Can we say praise the Lord? And many
[33:35] people are ignorant to that fact and
[33:38] they have demons talking to them and
[33:40] don't even realize it.
[33:46] Lord have
[33:48] mercy. My my
[33:52] my I have something here I want to share
[33:54] with you. Brother Brandham says in the
[33:56] message of the
[33:58] contest, he says, you know, and many say
[34:01] today that there is no such thing as the
[34:05] devil. He says they believe that it's
[34:07] just simply a thought. He says they
[34:10] believe that. And there's people that
[34:12] believe that the Holy Spirit is a good
[34:15] thought and the devil is a bad thought.
[34:18] It says, "But if you notice when the
[34:20] Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit, it says
[34:23] he said when he, the Holy Spirit has
[34:26] come and he is a personal pronoun." See,
[34:30] so he is a person and the devil is a
[34:32] person and demons are persons. Yes, they
[34:35] are demons and they come in many
[34:42] ways. So you can have a
[34:45] demon. Now I don't want to. We all are
[34:48] aware of this already. Demons are in
[34:50] this room right now.
[34:55] And there and listen now. They're
[34:57] talking to people.
[35:00] What's the purpose? To try to distract
[35:02] you away from the word of God.
[35:05] But there are angels here, too. Can we
[35:08] say praise the Lord? God is here in this
[35:12] room right now. beyond our natural
[35:14] sight, but yet they're here and they are
[35:16] actual persons.
[35:22] You mind if I share your testimony,
[35:23] brother?
[35:26] We were fellowshipping with brother
[35:27] Chris on yesterday and and as he was
[35:30] sharing
[35:32] this I mean it was very
[35:35] evident he has a loved one that's been
[35:39] receiving or has had been receiving
[35:42] visitations from
[35:45] demons and it got to a point to where
[35:48] they can actually I mean they could
[35:50] actually see
[35:52] them. Now, let's put it back on the
[35:54] message just so you can follow me clear.
[35:56] Was not the prophet able to see demons?
[36:01] All right, let's take it a little deeper
[36:02] so you don't think brother McBride
[36:06] crazy. When Nelly Sanders Oh my.
[36:11] When Nelly Sanders stopped for a
[36:15] moment to listen
[36:18] to worldly music that she used to be
[36:22] connected with
[36:24] when she stopped to do it. What
[36:27] happened?
[36:29] Listen. What came out of her at brother
[36:32] Brandham's place came in her when she
[36:35] stopped for a moment. Yes, sir. Yes. And
[36:39] once it came in her when she stopped on
[36:41] that road where that club was that they
[36:43] start playing her favorite song, huh? It
[36:47] began to reason with her mind and make
[36:49] her feel as though you can go up there
[36:51] and witness to the people in the club.
[36:54] And when listen now, when she stopped
[36:57] for a moment, that demon that that same
[36:59] demon that Brother Brandham said looked
[37:00] like what? A bat,
[37:02] huh?
[37:04] That thing came inside of her and it was
[37:07] the one, Amen. persuading her to go up
[37:10] into the club to witness. Amen. But hey,
[37:12] listen now, she was on the devil's
[37:14] ground. Amen. And what happened? There
[37:17] wasn't a w There ain't a scripture was
[37:18] said. You know what happened? She
[37:20] started dancing on the dance floor. Huh?
[37:23] But because she was a daughter of God
[37:26] and destined to be able to be an
[37:27] overcomer, the Lord didn't let her
[37:29] remain in that state. But he came to her
[37:32] in her moment of weakness and failure
[37:34] and and brought her back to her right
[37:36] mind
[37:38] and caused her to run out of there. And
[37:40] then when she got to brother Brandon,
[37:42] now all of a sudden he prayed for her.
[37:44] The door start opening and closing by
[37:46] itself. Demonic demonstration, right?
[37:49] And what happened saints? The bat the
[37:52] batlike figure came out and the man that
[37:56] was under the influence of alcohol was
[37:59] able to see it.
[38:01] Our brother's loved one was able to see
[38:04] this demon that was in her house and it
[38:07] called his name
[38:12] Mary and it would try to call it would
[38:15] try to persuade her to do things cuz she
[38:18] used to drink and whenever she whenever
[38:21] it was able listen now when it was when
[38:24] it was able to cause her to
[38:26] drink then it would try to get her to do
[38:29] things under the influence influence of
[38:30] the
[38:31] alcohol, pick up babies, go and drive a
[38:35] car. It was telling her to do these
[38:40] things. Come on, somebody. How many how
[38:43] how many deaths caused by DUI have we
[38:46] heard about?
[38:48] Huh? Do you know it was demons that was
[38:50] talking to those individuals?
[38:52] Huh? But how was it able to get to that
[38:55] state? They don't call those liquor
[38:56] places spirits for no reason.
[38:59] They don't even know what they saying.
[39:01] Huh? It's spirits, right? It's real evil
[39:04] spirits that come inside of people when
[39:06] you open yourself up to that avenue.
[39:11] One day he was at her
[39:13] home. He's a child of
[39:16] God. And the loved one looked at him and
[39:19] was looking over him and said, "Mary is
[39:21] standing over you right now, looking
[39:23] down at you."
[39:27] He was a disturbance
[39:29] to Mary. Hallelujah.
[39:32] Huh?
[39:34] Why? When I said a characteristic of
[39:37] demons is to cause people to want to get
[39:38] away from saints. Why is that?
[39:41] Amen. Forgive me. But it's because of
[39:45] the presence of the Lord.
[39:48] Brother Brandham said in his services,
[39:50] Amen. He says as he's ministering the
[39:53] word and demons listen the people that
[39:55] demons were upon were be their focus be
[39:59] oh my their focus be to change it be to
[40:04] be shifted onto the word that was being
[40:06] spoken and as their focus be to be
[40:09] shifted they were allowing now the
[40:11] influence of the Holy Ghost to come in
[40:13] and it began to battle against those
[40:15] demons that was holding them in their
[40:17] minds mind battles the greatest battle
[40:20] ever fought Right. And brother Brandham
[40:22] says those individuals that were housed
[40:24] by devils, amen, all of a sudden they
[40:26] begin to believe and the devil begins to
[40:28] get weak. And when that devil begins to
[40:32] get weak, he says it begins to call out
[40:34] for help in the spiritual realm. So
[40:36] demons were screaming across the room,
[40:39] but natural men and women wasn't able to
[40:41] hear a word.
[40:43] Amen. trying to call a kindred spirit to
[40:47] come in and increase the mind battle to
[40:50] make the thoughts more convincing to
[40:52] hold a person where they were
[40:55] cuz the more interest they gave the word
[40:57] of God, Amen, light begin to come inside
[41:00] of that individual and darkness begin to
[41:02] be pushed out.
[41:05] That's happening right now.
[41:08] You understand what I'm saying? There's
[41:09] a great battle taking place right now in
[41:12] this room.
[41:14] Who are you going to allow to win this
[41:15] morning? What are you going to give your
[41:18] attention to this morning? God is here
[41:20] to set you free. Amen. And give you what
[41:23] your heart is longing for.
[41:25] You've been praying about it. Allow God
[41:28] to give it to you.
[41:31] Allow your thoughts to be put on him.
[41:36] Amen.
[41:39] Praise
[41:40] God.
[41:42] Ephesians 6 and12
[41:45] says this is true right now at this
[41:48] moment for we wrestle not against flesh
[41:50] and blood but against
[41:53] principalities against the powers
[41:56] against powers against the rulers of the
[41:58] darkness of this world against spiritual
[42:01] wickedness in high
[42:02] places right now in this
[42:06] room spiritual wickedness in high places
[42:10] is trying a whole places in people's
[42:13] hearts and minds.
[42:18] But if your eye be
[42:20] single, your whole body shall be full of
[42:22] light. Yes, sir.
[42:25] Where are you right
[42:30] now? When we leave this
[42:33] building, it's easy for us to have our
[42:36] mind on the word. Now, but the Bible
[42:39] tells us
[42:41] clearly that the devil waits. Oh, I'll
[42:44] wait. Uhhuh. I'll wait till the service
[42:46] is over. Uhhuh. Huh? And the things in
[42:49] which you heard, the Bible says he'll
[42:51] then try to find a way to come and steal
[42:53] it from you.
[42:56] How? Through people. Through activities.
[42:59] You understand what I'm saying? This is
[43:01] reality, saints. Yes, sir. Amen. Once we
[43:04] leave, once this service ends, the devil
[43:06] is going to come in with an onslaught
[43:09] trying to see how he can get more of a
[43:11] hole, regain his position that he's
[43:13] probably losing right now, depending on
[43:16] the
[43:18] individual.
[43:20] People were in the prophet
[43:22] services presence of the Lord fully
[43:25] there and they were able to sit
[43:28] there and allow a demon spirit in the
[43:31] presence of the Lord to still hold
[43:36] residence and even and notice when evil
[43:39] spirits came on people you know what it
[43:40] did evil spirits would cause those
[43:43] individuals to be against the prophet
[43:47] remember brother Okay.
[43:49] Huh? He Oh my
[43:53] You understand what I'm saying? In the
[43:56] presence of the Lord.
[43:59] Come on. I thought it was easy to feel
[44:02] the presence of the
[44:03] Lord. I thought if God was in the
[44:05] building, you'll be able to
[44:08] know. It's not like
[44:11] that. The Bible says the light that be
[44:14] in you is darkness. He says, "How great
[44:16] is that
[44:18] darkness?" How great was the darkness
[44:21] that was in
[44:25] Cain. Listen. He knew it was God talking
[44:28] to him.
[44:31] He knew it. Come on, somebody.
[44:35] He knew it was God talking to him. Ain't
[44:37] that right, brother?
[44:40] And he was still able to hold his own
[44:44] mental listen I I
[44:45] don't he still enabled the devil
[44:50] to hold him in the place that he was
[44:55] he heard God
[44:57] listen. He knew better than to come out
[45:00] his mouth the wrong way toward God. But
[45:03] in his mind he was telling God, "I hate
[45:06] you." That's right.
[45:09] And he was telling his father, "I love
[45:11] you."
[45:13] And his action showed because even after
[45:16] hearing directly from God, he walked out
[45:19] to live his own life, his own way. Glory
[45:23] to God. Amen. He didn't care about He
[45:26] didn't care. Listen, he didn't care no
[45:27] more about being accepted by God. God
[45:31] told him what to do to be accepted.
[45:34] He didn't care no more. He just wanted
[45:36] to live his own way. His own life.
[45:40] Isn't that the thought that the devil
[45:42] bring in people's minds now? Yes, sir. I
[45:45] want to live my life my way. Amen.
[45:47] That's right. Amen. And like we talked
[45:49] about on last night, they feel, listen,
[45:51] the devil deceives them into believing
[45:53] that satisfaction,
[45:55] being able to live however you want to
[45:57] live, do whatever you want to do. No,
[46:00] that's bondage. That's imprisonment.
[46:04] That's right. Huh? I'm free. Know you
[46:06] not you're bound
[46:08] sir. Yes, sir. Amen. You're only free
[46:10] when you're free from sin.
[46:13] From the influence of the devil.
[46:16] Can we say praise the Lord? Philippians
[46:19] chapter 4:E 6 says, no, I'm sorry. 2
[46:22] Corinthians chapter 10 verse three says,
[46:25] "For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[46:27] not war after the flesh." Verse four of
[46:29] 2 Corinthians 10. For the weapons of our
[46:31] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[46:33] through God to the pulling down of
[46:35] strongholds, casting down what?
[46:37] Imaginations and every high thing that
[46:40] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[46:41] God.
[46:42] Where? In our minds.
[46:46] The devil chose the
[46:48] mind. That's where the battle is right
[46:50] now in the
[46:52] mind. Praise God.
[46:55] It says, "Casting down imaginations and
[46:57] every high thing that exalted itself
[46:58] against the knowledge of God and
[47:00] bringing into captivity how many
[47:02] thoughts?"
[47:04] Hold on now. That sound like a lot of
[47:07] work. Bring into captivity.
[47:13] Every Why? What's so important about
[47:17] thoughts? What's so important about
[47:19] thoughts are just thoughts?
[47:22] Trust in the Lord with all thine heart,
[47:25] and lean not to thy own understanding,
[47:28] which is not your own understanding, but
[47:31] it's the persuasion of a demon
[47:34] that tries to lead you down a channel of
[47:37] thought,
[47:38] huh? That'll lead you into a certain
[47:41] destination.
[47:44] That's leaning to your own. It's not
[47:45] you. You're actually leaning to a devil
[47:48] that you don't realize is a devil. You
[47:50] think it's just you being witty? Yeah, I
[47:54] got wits about
[47:56] me. I I hear what the pastor's saying,
[47:59] but I think I got a better way. I I I I
[48:02] I think it's God leading me down a
[48:06] better
[48:07] way. The devil, the Bible says he
[48:09] transforms himself into an angel of
[48:11] light.
[48:13] People think they listening to God and
[48:16] listening clearly from a
[48:17] devil. Amen.
[48:20] That devil, he a liar.
[48:24] He don't mind lying and making you think
[48:26] it's God.
[48:29] God, I thank you for for giving me that
[48:31] direction. You're welcome, my child. And
[48:34] it's a demon.
[48:38] God told me, "You
[48:42] sure? I prayed about it, but God knew
[48:45] what was in your heart, and he let you
[48:46] be given over. to what was foremost in
[48:50] your heart. Your will was greater than
[48:51] his will. You didn't care about his
[48:54] will. Like Cain, you only wanted your
[48:55] way to do what you want to do when and
[48:57] where, however you wanted to do it.
[49:01] The Bible says because you love not the
[49:03] truth, he'll give you over.
[49:08] Oh
[49:09] man, this is serious now.
[49:14] God's gentle
[49:17] beckoning, his soft
[49:20] calling, trying to call people to
[49:22] repentance and what have you to to to to
[49:25] to help them to escape destruction,
[49:28] right?
[49:30] We take that voice for granted. We think
[49:33] it'll always be there.
[49:37] Do we realize that God can call you for
[49:39] the last time? He can call you to
[49:42] repentance for the last time.
[49:46] The devil, oh, see, he's so loving. So
[49:48] he he he just he's so loving, man. He
[49:51] you a lot. You You got man, you you you
[49:53] got grace, but for hundreds and millions
[49:55] of miles. I mean, it it's just abundance
[49:58] of grace.
[50:01] That rich young ruler, how much grace
[50:03] did he have?
[50:05] After he denied the Lord that one time,
[50:09] how many more chances did he
[50:12] have? That was a done
[50:18] deal. See, that's how devils do. He try
[50:21] to lessen. It's like it tries to take
[50:23] our mind and cause us to begin to feel
[50:25] like there's no immediate danger at
[50:27] judgment. There's no immediate
[50:30] repercussions for your decisions.
[50:35] And even though you might have been able
[50:36] to live and get away with these things
[50:38] for many and many and many of years, you
[50:41] don't realize your number about to be
[50:42] called
[50:45] and you caught and you won't be able to
[50:48] say that God didn't give you fair
[50:50] warning. That's right. Brother Brandham
[50:53] says God always warns a man before he
[50:55] brings judgment.
[50:57] Amen.
[51:00] And that goes for all of us.
[51:02] May the Lord help us by his grace from
[51:05] this day forward not to make his grace a
[51:08] disgrace.
[51:23] I want to close on this.
[51:28] Genesis chapter
[51:30] 3. Very
[51:33] familiar. As you're going to Genesis 3,
[51:36] I want to read to you something
[51:39] here.
[51:42] Uh the word
[51:44] focus by definition it means the center
[51:48] of interest or
[51:50] activity. So what you focus on shows
[51:54] where your interests
[51:55] are. Amen. And this is where we have to
[51:59] be brutally honest with our individual
[52:02] lives. If
[52:08] God, if the level of occupancy within
[52:11] our daily lives that God
[52:17] holds is draw down to a very minimal
[52:20] sliver of a
[52:22] place that shows where our interests
[52:24] are.
[52:26] Yes, sir. Cuz whatever is filling
[52:27] everything beyond that sliver of a
[52:29] place, that's where our heart really is.
[52:43] My focus again means the center of
[52:46] interest or activity.
[52:48] The word entertain by definition it
[52:51] means to give attention or consideration
[52:54] to. All we have to do is entertain a
[53:01] thought. Genesis chapter
[53:05] 3. Verse one says, "Now the serpent was
[53:08] more subtle than any beast of the field
[53:10] which the Lord God had made. And he said
[53:14] unto the woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye
[53:17] shall not eat of every tree of the
[53:18] garden?" And the woman said unto the
[53:21] serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the
[53:23] trees of the garden, but of the fruit of
[53:25] the tree of the tree which is in the
[53:27] midst of the garden. God has said, Ye
[53:29] shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
[53:31] touch it, lest you
[53:32] die." And the serpent said unto the
[53:35] woman, "Ye shall not surely die."
[53:39] Even though God said
[53:41] this, he's not going to let you
[53:46] die. For God doesn't know that in the
[53:48] day you eat thereof, then your eyes
[53:50] shall be open, and ye shall be as
[53:53] gods, knowing good and
[53:57] evil. Right at that
[54:00] moment,
[54:02] listen, Satan had her.
[54:06] How do you know, Brother McBride?
[54:08] because she was listening to him.
[54:16] Right at that
[54:19] moment, she died.
[54:25] Hold on, brother MB. She began, she
[54:26] still was talking at what you mean she
[54:28] died
[54:31] spiritually. She became separated from
[54:33] God.
[54:36] Listen, right in that moment, Lord, now
[54:39] we read the scripture, so I'm not going
[54:42] far-fetched. Right at that
[54:45] moment, God was hearing a clear
[54:47] communication from
[54:49] Eve. I hate you.
[54:55] And I love this spirit.
[54:59] I despise you.
[55:02] And I'm I'm now going to go ahead and
[55:04] give my myself over to this spirit.
[55:08] Why would you say that, brother? Eve
[55:09] didn't say that, brother McBride. But
[55:11] her
[55:12] act the next
[55:15] verse. And when the woman saw, notice
[55:19] this now, that the tree was good for
[55:23] food. Now, what was wrong and what was
[55:26] evil was being looked at as being not
[55:29] that bad. And it's it actually looks
[55:31] good.
[55:36] That's a clear indication of spiritual
[55:39] death.
[55:43] Yes.
[55:47] Satan introduces
[55:51] something. I'm going to say you take the
[55:53] bait.
[55:57] The initial time that happens is the
[56:00] most difficult
[56:01] time. But after it happens, that time it
[56:05] becomes less difficult. Why? Because now
[56:08] something else is controlling your
[56:12] thoughts. You've grieved away the
[56:14] presence of the Lord. So now that
[56:17] conviction is not as strong,
[56:20] right?
[56:21] And the more repetitive that begins to
[56:23] go down that line, it becomes easier and
[56:26] easier until the point it just it
[56:28] becomes a part of your lifestyle.
[56:31] And now you become blinded to the very
[56:34] presence of the Lord as though he's not
[56:35] even nowhere around. And he's standing
[56:38] right there watching the whole time.
[56:40] You're in his
[56:42] presence, but yet being fully consumed
[56:46] by an evil spirit that called Eve right
[56:49] here. Listen, within her saying this, or
[56:52] rather the Bible is just describing what
[56:55] it was that began to take place in her.
[56:57] Listen, there was no fear of the Lord
[56:59] here at this
[57:03] time. She was caught up in the spirit
[57:06] that she had opened herself to. That's
[57:08] right. Good, brother. Good. God was
[57:11] present, but there was no fear there.
[57:14] There was no consciousness.
[57:19] and that it was pleasant to the
[57:22] eyes and a tree to be
[57:25] desired to make one
[57:27] wise. It says she took of the fruit
[57:30] thereof and we know what that fruit was.
[57:33] That's right.
[57:40] Focus is the center of
[57:43] interest and activities.
[57:46] her focus shifted. Brother Brandon said
[57:49] as she stayed behind that word, she
[57:51] would remain
[57:53] fortified. But but Satan was able to do
[57:56] what,
[57:57] saints? Pull her from behind the
[58:00] word into his presence. And he was able
[58:04] to have his way with
[58:10] her, looking at the unseen.
[58:14] Paragraph 34, Brother Brandham says,
[58:16] "I'm told that a snake can catch the eye
[58:19] of a
[58:20] bird and he can get the direct hold on
[58:24] that bird if he can catch his
[58:27] eye." So that that bird is in a on a
[58:30] higher
[58:32] place. It's in a tree somewhere on a
[58:35] limb. That snake is on the ground in
[58:39] most cases.
[58:43] But if that snake can catch the eye of
[58:46] that
[58:47] bird and that bird become locked
[58:51] in, the focus of that bird begins locked
[58:54] in or becomes locked in to that
[58:57] snake. Listen, he can make that bird
[59:01] come right off of his roost.
[59:08] Let's bring it into our
[59:09] day. You can be in church or at home or
[59:13] anywhere. Yes. In the presence of the
[59:16] Lord, listening to the word or what have
[59:19] you, but then Satan is able to bring a
[59:21] distracting
[59:23] thought that you give attention to or
[59:25] you
[59:27] entertain. He's able to pull that bird
[59:30] from that higher
[59:32] place and have that bird come down.
[59:36] That demon is able to take you from
[59:38] wherever you are, pull you from that
[59:40] place once you give your focus to it and
[59:43] draw you right down into its
[59:49] domain. It says, "Flutter right around
[59:52] and around and around and come right
[59:54] straight to that snake's mouth."
[59:57] I'm told that the eye of a snake is so
[1:00:00] powerful that when it catches the eye of
[1:00:02] a bird, it charms him, lures him right
[1:00:07] into the snake. And they say that little
[1:00:10] bird will flutter and flutter and
[1:00:12] flutter coming down. And if it listen
[1:00:16] now, even if it makes it to this
[1:00:20] point, there's
[1:00:22] still a possibility for deliverance.
[1:00:26] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:28] What brought
[1:00:31] them into that
[1:00:33] snare? The very thing that brought them
[1:00:35] into that
[1:00:37] snare is able now to also be a means to
[1:00:40] be delivered from the snare.
[1:00:43] What brought them into that snare? A
[1:00:45] focus.
[1:00:48] They became
[1:00:50] focused on this tactic or this bait of
[1:00:54] the devil.
[1:00:55] and they begin to be pulled into the
[1:00:57] devil's
[1:00:59] world. But notice how he says this. If
[1:01:02] it don't quickly start raising its
[1:01:05] head and shaking from that snake and
[1:01:10] start looking
[1:01:12] upward, look totally away from the snake
[1:01:15] and start looking upward, he says it'll
[1:01:19] never free itself. That's the only way
[1:01:22] it could free itself is to change its
[1:01:26] focus.
[1:01:30] So even if this morning you feel or know
[1:01:34] that you've been charmed by the
[1:01:37] devil and is
[1:01:39] now taking you from the place you know
[1:01:41] you should be in into a lower place, a
[1:01:46] worldly place, a place of darkness.
[1:01:50] right now by the grace of God you can
[1:01:54] begin to come up from that place.
[1:01:56] Hallelujah. If you allow your thoughts
[1:01:59] and your focus to become single
[1:02:05] and begin to fight,
[1:02:08] then you will experience deliverance.
[1:02:14] We thank God for helping us this
[1:02:16] morning.
[1:02:21] This is a real gospel
[1:02:26] and this particular subject has become
[1:02:28] so real to me because I've been on both
[1:02:31] sides of
[1:02:32] it. I've watched myself enter into
[1:02:35] defeat and I've watched God give me the
[1:02:39] victory and I've had to study
[1:02:41] that how how did I get defeated? What
[1:02:44] happened? What did I begin to give
[1:02:46] myself attention to, you know, give
[1:02:50] entertain? Amen. You you be honest with
[1:02:53] yourself. You can you can trace those
[1:02:56] moments of defeat right back to where it
[1:02:59] started, how it started, who it started
[1:03:01] with, what it started with.
[1:03:07] And you can choose to make the same
[1:03:09] mistake. Well, at that time, it won't be
[1:03:12] a mistake. You can choose to make the
[1:03:14] same decision or you can choose to begin
[1:03:17] to make better
[1:03:19] decisions. Brother Brandham says we
[1:03:21] can't blame Adam and Eve for what takes
[1:03:25] place with us
[1:03:26] now. They fumbled the ball and
[1:03:30] entertained the devil in their time and
[1:03:32] we were sold into sin. Right?
[1:03:36] But now he says you have those trees
[1:03:38] before you all day every day. And you
[1:03:42] choose what tree you're going to eat
[1:03:43] from.
[1:03:46] And whatever tree you eat from, that's
[1:03:49] what's going to dictate your focus.
[1:03:53] Yes, sir.
[1:03:56] 1 plus one equals two.
[1:03:59] Is that plain? Amen. Yes, sir. God bless
[1:04:02] each one of you. Amen. May he help each
[1:04:05] one of us. I want to say this by the
[1:04:08] grace of
[1:04:09] God. May he help us to really care for
[1:04:11] one another.
[1:04:15] That means a lot. When people are
[1:04:18] struggling, when people are having a
[1:04:20] hard time, they don't need
[1:04:23] criticism. They don't need
[1:04:26] self-righteousness. People that's full
[1:04:28] of mistakes themselves looking down on
[1:04:30] them.
[1:04:32] You understand what I'm saying? Yes. But
[1:04:33] the Bible says when you see a brother or
[1:04:36] you know it's it's including both man
[1:04:38] and woman overcoming a fault, it says
[1:04:40] we're to go to them in the spirit of
[1:04:42] meekness and humility.
[1:04:44] And this key factor God says we need to
[1:04:46] have in mind. He says considering
[1:04:48] yourself
[1:04:50] cuz that's them today but it could be
[1:04:52] you tomorrow if it's not for the grace
[1:04:54] of God. Yes sir. Right. So we need to
[1:04:58] love one another. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:01] really cry out for one another asking
[1:05:04] God to help help Lord help my brother
[1:05:06] help my sister help me.
[1:05:09] Brother Jesse, he was always it would
[1:05:10] always I believe it was Jeremiah I was
[1:05:12] reading there and he actually included
[1:05:15] himself within the prayer for Israel.
[1:05:20] Amen. I said, "What he doing that
[1:05:23] for?" He ain't the one out there
[1:05:25] committing
[1:05:26] idolatry. But in the presence of the
[1:05:28] Lord, I believe he realized that he
[1:05:30] wasn't alltogether right himself. Yes,
[1:05:32] sir. Huh. So, he wasn't going to be
[1:05:35] praying about you. Yeah. I pray you help
[1:05:37] like like the like the publican.
[1:05:40] I'm glad I'm not I'm like the Pharisee.
[1:05:42] I mean, I'm glad I'm not like that
[1:05:44] publican.
[1:05:46] Huh?
[1:05:49] Amen. Amen. He's doing it, saints. He's
[1:05:53] working among us. He's helping us. We're
[1:05:55] coming to where we need to
[1:05:57] be by his grace. Yes. We love you. We
[1:06:02] thank God for this
[1:06:04] time. has been very nurturing for me.
[1:06:08] Amen. Amen. As I minister, I'm being
[1:06:11] ministered to. Gise. So pray for Brother
[1:06:15] McBride. Amen.
[1:06:17] So as you praying for yourself, Lord,
[1:06:19] bless my brother also. Help him to
[1:06:22] overcome, Lord, all the snares of the
[1:06:25] enemy. Lord, so that he can be used for
[1:06:28] your glory, Lord. as you pray for
[1:06:31] yourself, Lord, help me to overcome, to
[1:06:34] be removed from all the snares of the
[1:06:35] enemy that I might serve your
[1:06:38] purpose while I'm here in this life. Let
[1:06:40] us all stand together and let's give the
[1:06:43] Lord a hand clap of
[1:06:52] praise. with every head bowed and every
[1:06:55] heart before the
[1:06:57] Lord. Heavenly
[1:07:00] Father, we thank you again, Lord, for
[1:07:03] your
[1:07:04] word. I realize, Lord, at times when
[1:07:08] things are being said, Father, it just
[1:07:10] seems to me that it's a clear
[1:07:12] communication. Lord, it's so beyond me,
[1:07:15] Father God. And Lord, that's how we need
[1:07:18] it, Lord. We need you to take full
[1:07:20] control and to minister to the needs of
[1:07:22] all of us that are together. Lord, I'm
[1:07:25] included within that. Heavenly Father,
[1:07:27] last night I was affected. Lord, I'm
[1:07:30] affected right now, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[1:07:33] you're giving us weapons of
[1:07:35] warfare, Lord. You're showing us how to
[1:07:38] overcome, Lord Jesus. Amen. And Father,
[1:07:41] why wouldn't we, Lord, pay attention,
[1:07:43] Lord God, and and allow ourselves to be
[1:07:46] exercised within these things, Lord?
[1:07:49] Father, have your way, Lord. May this
[1:07:52] word become a part of us, Lord. Lord,
[1:07:55] may it become a living article within
[1:07:57] our lives, heavenly father, which means
[1:08:00] that we give place to your spirit for
[1:08:02] your influence and your person to come
[1:08:05] inside of us and fill all of these
[1:08:07] places, Lord, these void places, these
[1:08:10] vacancies, Father, as the enemy is
[1:08:12] uprooted and cast out, Father, may you
[1:08:15] fill us, Lord, with your person, Lord,
[1:08:18] taking full control, Lord God, that you
[1:08:20] might control our thoughts, control our
[1:08:23] speech, Lord. control our actions,
[1:08:26] heavenly father. Amen. According to your
[1:08:28] desire, Lord, that we that we might
[1:08:31] truly be vessels for your use, Lord, for
[1:08:34] the use of the master, Lord, at any
[1:08:36] given time to be in such a place of
[1:08:39] yielding and surrenderance, Lord, that
[1:08:42] you can get glory to yourself whenever
[1:08:44] you feel to, Father. Lord, bless this
[1:08:47] church. Bless every single individual,
[1:08:50] Lord Jesus, as they meditate upon your
[1:08:53] word, Lord. Even even as we have to
[1:08:56] leave these church walls, Father, to go
[1:08:58] out into the realities of our own lives,
[1:09:01] into this world, Lord Jesus. Father, may
[1:09:03] this word be be able to be brought back
[1:09:06] to our remembrance, heavenly father. And
[1:09:08] Lord, may you help us to humble
[1:09:10] ourselves to give you more time, Lord.
[1:09:12] Amen. To make time for you, Lord God,
[1:09:15] according to what you deserve. You
[1:09:17] should be the highest priority in every
[1:09:20] one of our lives on a daily basis, Lord.
[1:09:22] But Lord, shamefully we say, Lord, that
[1:09:25] you have not been in that place, Father.
[1:09:27] But Lord, help us, Lord God, to give you
[1:09:29] that place, Lord, for your glory and
[1:09:32] your honor, Lord, that you might be
[1:09:34] pleased, Lord Jesus. We know you love
[1:09:36] us, Lord, and we're so grateful and
[1:09:38] thankful for your unconditional love,
[1:09:41] Lord. But Lord, you want to be loved
[1:09:42] back.
[1:09:44] Amen. You want to be loved back from a
[1:09:47] true and a sincere heart, Lord. Somebody
[1:09:49] that's willing to give you their all,
[1:09:51] Father, realizing all that you've done
[1:09:53] for us, Lord, that you didn't even have
[1:09:55] to do, but you did it, Lord. There won't
[1:09:58] be able to be any excuses at all, Father
[1:10:00] God. Help us Lord God to die to
[1:10:03] ourselves
[1:10:07] Lord that we might become more alive in
[1:10:12] you with every head bowed, every heart
[1:10:15] bowed. I know there are needs among us
[1:10:19] on this
[1:10:22] morning and the Lord knows all about it.
[1:10:25] Heavenly Father, you see the individual
[1:10:28] needs, Lord, the
[1:10:30] struggles, Lord, the heartaches, Lord,
[1:10:33] the
[1:10:34] troubles, Lord, that the enemy has been
[1:10:37] able to inject within your children's
[1:10:40] lives, Lord. Things that they wrestle
[1:10:42] with,
[1:10:43] Father, but Lord, may they become very
[1:10:46] aware that they're wrestling against
[1:10:49] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:10:52] Help them to be separated from thoughts
[1:10:54] within their own mind that's not their
[1:10:56] thoughts that they might be able to
[1:10:58] clearly see the enemy, Lord. Amen. And
[1:11:01] realize that it's not a part of them,
[1:11:03] but it's apart from them. It's something
[1:11:06] on the outside trying to get in, Lord
[1:11:09] God.
[1:11:10] Even as you said in your word, Lord,
[1:11:12] trusting you with all of our heart and
[1:11:14] lean not to our own understanding, but
[1:11:17] in all our ways to include you, Lord, to
[1:11:21] acknowledge you, knowing that you only
[1:11:23] know what's best for us, Lord. No one of
[1:11:25] us in this room knows what's best for
[1:11:27] ourselves.
[1:11:29] We never did, Lord God. We need you. We
[1:11:31] need your guidance, Lord. We need your
[1:11:34] leadership all the time. Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] Lord, help us to yield to that, Father.
[1:11:40] And you said in your word, Lord, that
[1:11:42] you will direct our paths. What better
[1:11:45] way to live, Lord. Lord, have mercy on
[1:11:47] us, Father. We want our paths to be
[1:11:50] directed, Lord. We need that, Father
[1:11:53] God. We want to walk in your perfect
[1:11:55] will, not your permissive will,
[1:11:58] Lord. Let it be so,
[1:12:01] Father, by your grace. Bless this
[1:12:04] church, Lord, continuously we pray. We
[1:12:07] thank you for all that you've done
[1:12:08] already, Lord, for the upcoming births,
[1:12:11] Father God. May you protect each mother
[1:12:13] and each child and each process, Father.
[1:12:16] You are the mighty God. I've seen you
[1:12:18] move. I've seen you in action, Lord.
[1:12:20] Amen. I know you're able to do it,
[1:12:23] Father God. And we look for that, Lord.
[1:12:25] We look for the testimonies, Father,
[1:12:28] Lord, of your love and grace and power,
[1:12:31] Lord God, just surrounding them and
[1:12:33] being with them, Lord. bringing thing
[1:12:35] bringing everything out Lord into a
[1:12:37] right place. We entrust you with that
[1:12:40] Father
[1:12:41] God. Every heart, every individual Lord,
[1:12:44] every home Lord, may it become
[1:12:46] different. May the individual become
[1:12:48] different Lord. May the homes become
[1:12:50] different. Heavenly Father, may your
[1:12:53] influence begin to increase and may
[1:12:56] darkness begin to decrease. Lord, we
[1:12:59] love you, Father God, and we ask you all
[1:13:02] these things in your name, the name of
[1:13:05] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:13:10] Amen. God bless you, saints. We love
[1:13:12] you. And until the next time, if there
[1:13:16] be a next time,
[1:13:18] because what I wanted to deal with, I
[1:13:21] wasn't able to deal with, but I was
[1:13:23] sharing it with my precious sister on
[1:13:25] last night. is so late right now.
[1:13:30] The things that the prophet talked about
[1:13:32] concerning the squeeze, aren't we able
[1:13:34] to see how possible that is right now
[1:13:37] with the current administration that we
[1:13:39] have? We see how it's able to act and do
[1:13:41] and handle people. Oh my, things have
[1:13:44] changed drastically. It's going home
[1:13:47] time, but it's going to be a squeeze.
[1:13:51] And that squeeze is going to squeeze the
[1:13:53] bride together.
[1:13:55] is going to bring the best of her out.
[1:13:58] Amen. God is going to be on display.
[1:14:04] Everything is making room.
