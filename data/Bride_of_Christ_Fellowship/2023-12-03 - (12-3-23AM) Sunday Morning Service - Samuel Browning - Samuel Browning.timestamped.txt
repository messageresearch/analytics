[3:13] places God placed us right there amen
[3:15] amen the footsteps of the righteous were
[3:17] certainly ordered of the Lord I really
[3:20] needed a mentor at the beginning of my
[3:21] Ministry and that's exactly what God
[3:23] gave me with brother Samuel what a
[3:24] mentor he taught me all these spiritual
[3:26] things but he also taught me how to tie

[3:30] to tie ties remember that that was in my
[3:32] first department when we first got there

[3:40] brother Samuel your gift is such a gift
[3:42] of God I said you should be preaching at
[3:44] these conventions and things and I feel
[3:46] like God is answering that right now

[10:37] scriptures here I'd like to go to Luke 5
[10:42] verse
[10:44] 17
[10:46] remember remember
[10:49] Jessie
[10:53] asking I tell you I think he's so
[10:56] far's far beyond that has to me has
[11:00] incredible amounts of energy and stamina
[11:03] and just so appreciate his seal for work
[11:08] of the
[11:09] Lord I remember when some of my stamina
[11:12] started slowing a little bit there and I
[11:15] thought honestly thought something was
[11:17] going on I said's what's taking place
[11:19] you know and so you know I think it's
[11:22] some of those things sometimes that God
[11:23] gives us Grace to help us in those
[11:26] moments of how to you know to
[11:29] even when we're using our energies and
[11:32] how to go about those things like
[11:33] brother Brown talked about in Works
[11:35] Faith expressed he said you know at
[11:36] first he said we went into the meetings
[11:38] he said it's like a person learning to
[11:40] swim that's right learning to swim and
[11:42] you come
[11:43] out he said but after a while he said
[11:46] you learn how to make those Strokes it
[11:49] isn't that we become have more stamina
[11:51] it's just that you know sometimes God
[11:53] gives us Grace on how to use the stamina
[11:57] we have is Les
[11:59] so we love you let's read here a few
[12:02] vers of scripture Luke 5 verse 17 say
[12:06] it's so good to have my wife and my
[12:08] family and the boys here with
[12:10] me verse 17 and it came to pass on a
[12:14] certain day as he was teaching that
[12:17] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[12:19] law sitting by which were come out of
[12:22] every town of Galilee and Judea and
[12:24] Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was
[12:28] present to heal them and behold men
[12:31] brought in a bed a man which was taken
[12:34] with pausy and they sought means to
[12:37] bring him in and to lay him before
[12:41] him just to ask the Lord to bless the
[12:44] reading of the word you're being
[12:46] seated I want to just continue to read
[12:51] just for a few moments I would like to
[12:56] the Lord would help us and we'll just
[12:57] see how this will move here between now
[13:01] and this evening but uh I really want to
[13:04] deal with the authority that we have in
[13:08] this presence The Authority that we have
[13:11] in the presence of the
[13:13] Lord and we go on to read here in the
[13:16] scriptures in verse 19 in Luke 5 it says
[13:21] and they could not find by what way they
[13:24] might bring him in because of the
[13:26] multitude they went on the housetop and
[13:30] let him down through the tiling with his
[13:33] couch into the midst before Jesus and
[13:36] when he saw their faith he said unto
[13:39] them man thy sins are
[13:42] forgiven the scribes and the Pharisees
[13:45] begin to reason saying who is this which
[13:48] speaketh blasphemy who can forgive sins
[13:52] but God alone I want you to notice as we
[13:56] look here in the scriptures there the
[14:00] awareness uh of even of these men who
[14:04] were friends and I'd say if there's any
[14:07] friends you want to have you want to
[14:08] have friends that have a real care for
[14:10] your life that desire to bring you into
[14:14] the presence of the reality of the
[14:17] Living God and you know bring us coming
[14:20] into the presence of God you you realize
[14:22] that the Simplicity that when the Bible
[14:25] says draw nine to God he'll Draw N to
[14:28] you Amen brother Brandon would take that
[14:31] scripture and and and bring it to us and
[14:33] say so many times in our minds we're
[14:36] become so occupied with even the cares
[14:39] of life he says that we miss we miss
[14:42] those opportunities and it's even the
[14:45] simple things that brother BR would talk
[14:46] about such as he said we get on our mind
[14:49] the latest dish soap and the other
[14:51] things things that are not even sinful
[14:54] but but Satan wants to so cloud and so
[14:57] clog our mind mind right because
[15:00] remember the word of God it won't bypass
[15:02] your mind but the word of God comes
[15:05] through that it first everything even
[15:07] coming to that of the new birth it first
[15:09] of all it's got to be believed and it
[15:12] passes through the Mind amen and then it
[15:14] moves from here down to here hallelujah
[15:17] and that's why that even as we look at
[15:19] it with within this uh these to me were
[15:23] some real friends because they uh were
[15:26] seeing a need within their uh friend's
[15:29] life and they got together and this this
[15:32] friend this individual the man with apy
[15:35] was not able to actually get himself
[15:38] there into the presence of God that's
[15:40] right and I think of it with for you and
[15:42] I that you know there are times that
[15:44] there we need a real strength from
[15:47] almighty God coming into the presence of
[15:50] God hallelujah yes how many remember the
[15:53] man by the name The Prophet by the name
[15:55] of Elisha that he was all out of sorts
[15:57] one day but there was was a need for God
[16:00] to speak through that vessel Hallelujah
[16:03] and so the very thing that Elisha said
[16:05] now you know Elisha could have you know
[16:08] he could have just said well you know
[16:10] I'm a prophet of God you know I don't
[16:12] see any obstacles I don't have any
[16:14] obstacles but being a prophet of God
[16:16] knowing that God will deal by
[16:18] inspiration and so what he looks at is
[16:21] that there is something that's needed in
[16:23] order to bring h a rest and a relaxing
[16:27] for him in order that that channel can
[16:30] be open amen you know that's the same
[16:32] way that God will deal with our lives
[16:35] sometimes even with the cares of Life
[16:37] the pressures of life that come our way
[16:40] it can become so tight so binding so
[16:43] much on your life even as you go through
[16:46] the things and the channels of life in
[16:48] Natural Care that are not even sinful
[16:51] but it's just the just the cares of life
[16:54] sometimes with schooling sometimes with
[16:55] work things that are going on on the job
[16:58] some times even as things transitions
[17:00] that happen even from in marriage
[17:03] children coming along all those things
[17:05] of learning the diversity of how to be
[17:08] able to divide ourselves and be able to
[17:11] minister to one another's needs as well
[17:14] as giving the Lord first place in all
[17:17] those things yes amen amen so sometimes
[17:21] that can be so uh uh challenging or
[17:24] mindboggling for us we can go through
[17:26] different battles where in ourselves
[17:28] we're looking and you know am I am I
[17:30] being as fervent as I need to be here
[17:32] and and we but sometimes what it is
[17:34] there's transitions that come in our
[17:36] lives even as we go into things with
[17:39] schooling a job you know how is you
[17:41] start a new job there's a more of a
[17:43] demand on you at first your mental part
[17:45] of it as you're thinking through things
[17:47] and trying to bring everything in it's a
[17:50] lot of pressure but you know this when
[17:52] we come back to Elisha he knew what was
[17:55] needed he said bring me a Ministry amen
[17:58] Isel be to play and as he played that
[18:01] that he be to play the Bible says then
[18:04] the hand of the Lord Came Upon Elijah
[18:07] hallelujah what did the music itself sou
[18:09] did it it was a changing of the
[18:12] atmosphere that was there the presence
[18:15] of God was not something that was really
[18:18] far off he right there amen as a matter
[18:22] of fact even though
[18:24] Jehoshaphat and that of that King had
[18:27] went on without consulting the Lord they
[18:31] had went off had not made uh uh
[18:34] appropriate uh um uh thinking of water
[18:37] and all those things but yet God in his
[18:40] Mercy showed that he is always right
[18:43] there with us I'll just say it like this
[18:47] I I just don't want I appreciate the
[18:49] reality to know that he said he never
[18:52] leave me nor forsake I appreciate that
[18:55] reality but it's also in the times that
[18:58] to say Lord I I I want to I want to
[19:01] sense your presence I want to be in a
[19:04] place that I am aware of your presence I
[19:08] want to be in a condition that you can
[19:10] speak to me Lord amen and I want to be
[19:12] in that place to where that if I know
[19:15] that I'm not in that place that he can
[19:17] speak to me I want to know that there is
[19:20] uh sufficient uh Grace that for us to be
[19:24] able to move into that channel that's
[19:26] why when Elisha asked for that the
[19:28] minstral and the menstral begin to play
[19:31] the atmosphere changed Hallelujah that's
[19:33] why brother Brandon when he talked about
[19:35] around the office where he was at and he
[19:37] talked about how that things that his
[19:39] son brother Billy Paul dealt with
[19:41] certain things and he would say he keeps
[19:43] that music on keep music keep that of
[19:46] the gospel music that's on it's very
[19:48] important yes amen those things like
[19:51] that it's just like when you come out of
[19:52] the workplace and you come away
[19:55] sometimes from some things and sometimes
[19:56] you look at it and say well I need to
[19:58] pray well I need to get in the word but
[20:01] sometimes it's just getting into
[20:03] condition so that we're not just going
[20:04] through the
[20:06] motions where we need the grace of
[20:08] almighty God to come the scene and move
[20:11] for our lives and this is where I look
[20:13] at this is to me what real friends are
[20:16] all about this is a moment where we have
[20:18] true brothers and sisters to wear that
[20:21] if someone else is a little discouraged
[20:23] or someone's down well God doesn't come
[20:26] down and put us down because we feel
[20:29] down God's interested in encouraging you
[20:32] and I he's interested in strengthening
[20:34] you and I sir God's God the whole the
[20:37] whole anointing of the word of God it's
[20:40] never come to beat us down it comes to
[20:43] lift us up and so when we look at this
[20:47] and see it with there operating in the
[20:49] scriptures we see even this uh of this
[20:52] principle working here of where even as
[20:55] we come into the house of God and here
[20:58] we are you know sometimes you come in
[21:00] from the toils and the tasks of life and
[21:03] you come in here and sometimes it just
[21:05] seems like that everything you're
[21:06] looking at it's so overwhelming how I
[21:10] can't even see my way through it but I'm
[21:12] coming to the house of God because I'm
[21:14] expecting God God's going to say
[21:17] something there's something that God has
[21:20] for me because God is mindful amen as we
[21:23] said before he's my helper he'll never
[21:26] leave me nor forsake me God know knows
[21:28] what I'm going
[21:29] through he knows what I'm facing he
[21:31] knows the obstacles God even knows even
[21:35] the doubt that can want to surround your
[21:38] life God even knows the thoughts that
[21:40] youve thought on within the previous
[21:42] week or even this morning and you know
[21:45] what God's not intimidated by that
[21:48] whatsoever he's not
[21:51] whatsoever God is confident here is
[21:54] wants his children come into His
[21:56] presence and you know what in order for
[21:59] you and I to come into His presence God
[22:01] Woos us into his presence you know just
[22:05] like how the prophet would describe the
[22:08] coming of the Lord and he would speak of
[22:10] that and taking that of the Clouds Of
[22:12] Glory its waves of his presence that
[22:15] just rolling in upon us it just moves in
[22:19] it just you know it starts just like you
[22:20] start in the song service it starts with
[22:23] just just pressing through a little
[22:25] barrier there a moment beyond the
[22:27] weariness beond on the just to say Lord
[22:30] you're worthy Lord where you you've
[22:33] guided me from this past week and where
[22:35] I am right now and you find that as you
[22:38] moved through that moment right there
[22:40] Then here you'll find then is it you'll
[22:42] move through the next moment and and to
[22:44] the next moment and his presence and
[22:47] pretty soon you're you're actually
[22:49] caught away from the discouragement
[22:53] Hallelujah from everything that you
[22:55] sting in that look that was so over
[22:58] overwhelming in your natural senses in
[23:01] your reasoning but now in the presence
[23:03] of God you can see things the right way
[23:07] and look at it and say God has got this
[23:11] in control Hallelujah a said it before
[23:14] now I'm seeing it now I'm experiencing
[23:18] that
[23:20] glory and so I when I look at this here
[23:24] in the scripture and seeing this this
[23:26] part uh to to me uh these are these are
[23:31] I Call These Guys these are buddies
[23:33] these are these are people that you
[23:34] definitely want to be on in your corner
[23:37] on your side that are there to encourage
[23:39] you they looked and they seen think
[23:42] about this it would be like you coming
[23:44] here to turn off of the of the road out
[23:47] here and you would look and there's no
[23:49] way to get in here your cars are just
[23:51] lined up through here and here you come
[23:53] and you think well I'll park over there
[23:55] in the dealership and at least we'll
[23:57] walk over or we'll park over there in
[23:59] another parking lot and we'll walk over
[24:01] and so then you get in here and here you
[24:02] come to the door and the door's open and
[24:05] the door's open and all the way down the
[24:07] hallway it's filled and in through here
[24:10] it's filled and you look at it and you
[24:13] would think how am I ever going to get
[24:15] in there right I want to get in there I
[24:18] just don't want to stand outside I want
[24:19] to get in there yes I I I I want to be I
[24:22] want to be a partaker and a part of
[24:24] what's taking place now you know you'd
[24:26] have a choice at that time you've got a
[24:28] choice whether that at that moment you
[24:31] say you know what there's just too many
[24:32] people here it's not going to be it's
[24:34] just not going to be comfortable for me
[24:36] I mean this is this a situation is it is
[24:39] it really worth it let me just say every
[24:42] moment in God's presence is worth
[24:48] Hall and sometimes God commit situations
[24:52] to come our way to test us that we then
[24:56] make a decision a declaration of the
[25:00] faith that we say we have within us now
[25:03] it comes to a declaration it comes to a
[25:05] showdown now you might look at that and
[25:07] say well that don't seem like a mount
[25:09] carel experience but you realize we are
[25:11] brought to make decisions time and time
[25:15] again and come to that place to realize
[25:18] hey In God's Presence I am not going to
[25:21] turn away God has a blessing for me
[25:25] praise God yes even if I had to stand
[25:28] outside God's Got a Blessing for me I'm
[25:31] certain because the house of God it said
[25:34] forsake not to assemble
[25:36] our
[25:39] more Hallelujah I have confidence that
[25:43] even if I have to listen and I'm not
[25:46] able to see the minister and I would
[25:48] have to listen through some sort of an
[25:51] audio Source stream it tap into it
[25:54] listen through the window whatever it
[25:56] would be it's worth wor it to be in the
[25:58] presence of godallah because the Bible
[26:01] says for you or three are GA together in
[26:05] my
[26:06] name I am
[26:09] there a
[26:11] pres right here Among Us think about it
[26:15] here they came and they moved back I
[26:19] mean they didn't even ask the owner of
[26:21] the house you think it'd be all right if
[26:22] we go up on your roof and we you know
[26:25] take part of your roof off and and we
[26:27] and we we lower this this our our friend
[26:29] down no they didn't ask that they what
[26:32] it is they saw a need they seen the need
[26:35] and they looked at where Jesus was you
[26:38] see it was in their heart we know where
[26:40] he's at and we need our friend is in
[26:44] need of a touch in his life if we can
[26:47] just get him in the presence of God and
[26:50] to think of that with within all of it
[26:53] that they themselves it would come into
[26:55] such a place where they would be so
[26:58] guided with such Precision to where when
[27:01] that man was let down he was let down
[27:05] right there before the Lord Jesus amen
[27:08] amen I tell you that took going beyond
[27:11] their feelings yes that took going
[27:14] beyond all the thoughts what's this
[27:16] homeowner going to think what's this
[27:18] person going to think me climbing up on
[27:19] their roof what are they going to think
[27:21] you know many times to get into God's
[27:23] presence the greatest person or place we
[27:26] have to overcome is our own self that's
[27:28] right Hallelujah I don't about things
[27:33] well I'm not worthy well it's not about
[27:35] your
[27:36] worth your
[27:38] worthiness be
[27:43] no Hallelujah the Bible tells us that
[27:46] when the fall took place in there in
[27:49] Eden that God placed a chaban there with
[27:52] a flaming sword by the gate to keep the
[27:56] way back into that of the Tree of Life
[27:59] showing that keeping the way God didn't
[28:02] seal it out like they you know wanted to
[28:04] seal up there the Eastern Gate God
[28:06] didn't seal it up but God himself placed
[28:09] there would be a chaban with a flaming
[28:11] sword showing keeping the way that there
[28:14] would be a way made
[28:18] backel back into
[28:20] the not just to a place to where the
[28:23] Pres of God would come and remove and
[28:26] come move the prophets experienced that
[28:29] but the difference was is that when God
[28:32] himself came down in Redemption the
[28:36] whole the whole uh part of it as the
[28:38] prophet tells us when he came he came
[28:41] with the Redeemer anointing well what
[28:43] was the Redeemer anointing he was
[28:45] anointed with the same spirit that was
[28:48] upon the prophets it was the same God as
[28:51] Paul said God in Su dry times spake to
[28:55] the prophets yes is that right SP to the
[28:58] people through the prophets in many
[29:00] different di manners but the difference
[29:03] was with the Redeemer anointing was it
[29:05] wasn't just a promise speaking of
[29:08] redemption but now God himself had come
[29:11] and United with man Hallelujah God had
[29:15] created a tabernacle for himself to
[29:17] dwell in and the Bible said on whom thou
[29:20] see the spirit descending and remaining
[29:24] Hallelujah that is Redeemer anointing
[29:27] and that's the same way it takes place
[29:29] in the life of a Believer do you realize
[29:32] if the way that even God brings a person
[29:35] into the new birth it's Redeemer
[29:38] anointing moving upon your heart
[29:40] bringing conviction to your life growing
[29:43] you in Repentance you realize that the
[29:46] Seal of the Holy Ghost is more of the
[29:49] same Grace that's been
[29:53] work
[29:55] hallelujah it's not
[29:59] it's us
[30:03] hallelujah it's leading us all the way
[30:06] who is it that could deal with even to
[30:09] our mind begins to change after
[30:12] justification our mind begins to change
[30:15] concerning the thoughts and things of
[30:17] the world things that didn't used to
[30:19] bother us now we we start thinking
[30:21] differently about that what is it it's
[30:23] more of the same grace of God hallelujah
[30:27] and as we'll yield to that he will take
[30:30] us all the
[30:32] way
[30:35] Hallelujah work because remember this
[30:39] example right here is the same way God
[30:41] works with you and I God knows where we
[30:44] need to get to he knows where we need to
[30:47] get to the reality of it is it's not
[30:50] when we think of the Tabernacle in the
[30:52] wilderness we're seeing as they would
[30:54] progress from the outer Court to Inner
[30:56] Court to the holiest of holies but you
[30:59] know all of that itself was a type of
[31:02] you yes amen you're God's Dwelling Place
[31:06] your's resting place Hallelujah it was
[31:08] not the blood itself where the animal
[31:11] was slay in the outer cord then the
[31:13] blood itself placed upon the horns of
[31:15] the altar then that blood would go
[31:17] deeper and the blood would be placed
[31:20] there upon the altar there uh of incense
[31:23] and it would be there in the Holy place
[31:25] but then that blood would move on in
[31:27] into of The Mercy Seat what was it it's
[31:30] God going deeper in your life yes
[31:33] Hallelujah not necessarily you going
[31:36] somewhere it's us yielding and God
[31:39] coming deeper
[31:41] Hallelujah Glory it's a gentleman and
[31:44] God works in that way this whole example
[31:47] we see in the scripture is that of God's
[31:50] presence moving in our lives that God
[31:53] bringing us to the place that we need to
[31:56] be in surrender
[31:57] amen glory because you know as we we
[32:01] speak of you know of a full surrender
[32:03] and it does take a full surrender but do
[32:06] you realize that that's something when
[32:07] we look at that and say a full surrender
[32:10] that's yielding what has God's dealing
[32:12] with your life has God's moving on your
[32:14] heart it's just Lord I want more of you
[32:17] I want more of you to take over more of
[32:19] me hallah that's why the prob can
[32:21] exppress that the coming that when the
[32:24] Holy Spirit he said is come and he'll
[32:26] deal with even in the beginnings there
[32:28] of justification he said it comes into
[32:31] your life like a little white button and
[32:33] he says the more that you can allow it
[32:36] to grow it'll push out the house it'll
[32:39] push out it'll push out the habits of
[32:43] the
[32:44] world because the Bible said how can two
[32:47] walk together except they be
[32:49] aged how you entertaining and feeding
[32:52] the right one he grows bigger he grows
[32:55] stronger pushes out other
[33:01] hallelujah thank you Jesus this is
[33:03] exactly we're heing the scriptures if
[33:06] they can get this man in the presence of
[33:09] the Lord Jesus and here he comes into
[33:12] this place and the Bible says that Jesus
[33:15] saw their faith right yes you see it's
[33:18] one thing as we look at it and we
[33:21] declare we have faith and let me just
[33:23] say it like this that Faith
[33:25] itself it is it's the very Foundation
[33:30] it's the very necessity there's nothing
[33:33] that we can receive from God without
[33:35] faith that's right
[33:37] Hallelujah and faith is an unconscious
[33:40] thing right yes it's an unconscious it's
[33:43] a subconscious thing because even of
[33:46] lives that set in the meetings brother
[33:48] Rand would describe this over and over
[33:50] even setting in the meetings of do with
[33:53] the white Moody and people were being
[33:55] healed When de might when the white
[33:57] Moody wasn't even preaching Divine
[34:00] Healing wow why because the presence of
[34:05] God was there for that moment according
[34:07] to that message that light that hour and
[34:10] there were lies believing and
[34:13] recognizing God's presence amen so the
[34:17] needs what they had need of in their
[34:19] bodies they receed what they had need of
[34:22] Hallelujah I don't know if it was on
[34:24] their minds or not I don't know that it
[34:26] just is like when I think of how
[34:28] thinking of a Consciousness is that how
[34:31] that brother Brandon would talk about
[34:33] those individuals setting on the on on
[34:35] the Pew and brother Ram will call
[34:36] different ones out and say you didn't
[34:38] think you had enough Faith did you see
[34:41] think you didn't think you had enough
[34:43] Faith amen he said but you're already
[34:45] healed amen because faith is not a
[34:48] conscious thing faith is a subconscious
[34:50] right yes that's why when brother R
[34:52] tells us he said when you're praying
[34:54] about your loved ones he said let it
[34:56] move from a conscious to a subconscious
[34:58] amen I can't do that on my own when he
[35:02] says Let It Move that way how does it
[35:04] move that way it's God to move it deeper
[35:07] in our life how does God move it deeper
[35:10] in our life it's by us yielding amen yes
[35:14] the presence of God is Not forceful amen
[35:18] right yes the presence of God is
[35:21] something as we come into His presence
[35:24] there's an awareness like brother BR
[35:26] would stand right and he would say now
[35:28] he says now that that won't hurt you it
[35:31] would make the people aware because
[35:32] they're aware there's a there's a great
[35:35] presence that's here hallelujah maybe
[35:37] never had sensed that never had sensed
[35:39] that presence before here stands the
[35:41] angel of the Lord and he would say he's
[35:43] not here to hurt you and here they would
[35:46] be aware here of the presence of
[35:49] almighty God even how some would react
[35:52] in the midst of that presence but what
[35:54] was important is is that in the midst of
[35:58] the presence of the Lord that they could
[36:00] recognize that it was God amen
[36:03] hallelujah amen that they could look
[36:05] past a veil and recognize it's God in
[36:08] the Fulfillment of his word this is what
[36:11] stumbled this is the veil itself has
[36:14] always been the hindrance among people
[36:17] that's right tells us that's the
[36:19] greatest
[36:20] challenge that God has is for one mortal
[36:23] to believe another mortal that's right
[36:25] that's right brother right the greatest
[36:27] challenge this is why when the angel of
[36:29] the Lord spoke to the prophet said if
[36:30] you can get the people to believe right
[36:33] nothing will stand before your prayer
[36:35] that's right brother R would tell one he
[36:36] says if you'll just believe me believe
[36:39] what God has spoke to me it it's done
[36:43] it's finished because what are we
[36:45] recognizing it's just like those who
[36:47] came in the days of Noah they had to
[36:49] believe what God had revealed and spoke
[36:52] to Noah right it didn't even when it
[36:55] didn't make sense
[36:57] right who first of all a man that is not
[37:01] even a ship Builder is going to build a
[37:04] ship come on you you know you don't let
[37:07] me just bring it down to simple terms
[37:09] you don't ask somebody to bake biscuits
[37:11] they can't make
[37:13] biscuits I know that's very simple but
[37:17] you you you you wouldn't choose that but
[37:19] see God was not choosing Noah based on
[37:22] his own ability yes hallah was laying
[37:25] within Noah
[37:27] Hallelujah before the word had even come
[37:30] across Noah's path Noah himself was
[37:33] devout he was he was looking to God he
[37:36] was serving God and here God comes and
[37:38] makes himself known to Noah and think
[37:41] about it in the midst of a of a time
[37:43] that's like this why would you build a
[37:46] ship if there is the necessity or the
[37:49] need for this ship here to move upon
[37:52] water why would you build it in dry
[37:55] land you build in a
[37:58] shipyard right it doesn't make sense to
[38:00] the Natural mind but you see God did not
[38:04] need the ship to be brought to the water
[38:07] God was going to bring the water to the
[38:09] ship to the AR is that right yes that's
[38:14] that's God expressing what he was going
[38:16] to do for us there's no way that we
[38:18] could get to God
[38:20] [Applause]
[38:22] God what we were at we were in a and
[38:27] we were in a condition knew where we
[38:30] were at Hallelujah just as he's building
[38:34] work in every of our life then here
[38:37] comes the water Hallelujah and it lifts
[38:41] us yes Jesus so he sees their faith and
[38:45] and the Lord Jesus in seeing their faith
[38:48] he looks upon the man and he says thy
[38:50] sins are forgiven thee my I tell you the
[38:53] the the scribes and Pharisees had a had
[38:56] a very challenging time and looking at
[38:58] that and the very thing that they
[39:00] mention is who can forgive sins but God
[39:02] alone
[39:04] right but Jesus the Bible says in verse
[39:07] 22 perceive their thoughts and he
[39:09] answering said unto them what reason ye
[39:12] in your hearts whether is it easier to
[39:15] say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say
[39:19] rise up and walk but that ye may know
[39:23] that the son of man hath power upon
[39:25] Earth to forgive sins he said to the
[39:28] sick of the py I say unto thee arise and
[39:32] take up thy couch and go into thy house
[39:37] and immediately he rose up before them
[39:40] and took up that whereon he lay and
[39:43] departed to his own house glorifying God
[39:46] and they were all amazed and they
[39:47] glorified God and were filled with fear
[39:50] saying we have seen strange things
[39:54] today now think about about this here he
[39:57] he speaks to a realm that they cannot
[40:00] see they see the man is bound with AOS
[40:04] yes they see that it would it would seem
[40:06] as though that's what those men they
[40:09] were bringing their friend there for he
[40:12] had a need in his life but the Lord
[40:14] Jesus saw their faith he saw he saw
[40:18] their faith and he saw there was a
[40:21] deeper need within that person's life
[40:26] and he went to what's the most important
[40:29] now let me say God cares about your
[40:31] health Hallelujah the Bible said I would
[40:34] that thou uh uh did prosper in health
[40:37] even as thy Soul doth Prosper God's
[40:40] interested in Divine Health God's
[40:42] interested in us in that part because
[40:44] you know why he has no other hands but
[40:46] your hands no other feet no other arms
[40:49] God God is moving through your life
[40:52] through your body to be yielded yes to
[40:55] be a vessel like Elisha was a channel
[40:58] that inspiration could come you're a
[41:00] channel amen hallelujah you're a channel
[41:03] for inspiration to come you can't serve
[41:05] god without inspiration it takes God to
[41:08] come and inspire you amen and the way
[41:10] that God inspires you inspires You by
[41:12] his word because within that word is the
[41:15] same sealed up the same inspiration as
[41:18] it was when God himself spoken amen
[41:22] that's why the word still has an effect
[41:24] and it has an authority and has a power
[41:27] because the word is not a dead letter
[41:30] when the spirit of God comes upon that
[41:33] word it lifs God out of history and
[41:36] brings him a presentence God to where
[41:38] you and I can even read this passage of
[41:41] scripture right here this morning and
[41:44] see ourselves see our day see the
[41:47] working of the Holy Spirit right here in
[41:49] our own midst Hallelujah here in a
[41:52] situation that in a realm all they could
[41:55] see was the visible and Jesus speaks to
[41:59] the invisible
[42:00] realm man thy sins be forgiven amen amen
[42:06] wow they're they're they're looking well
[42:09] you see here's the thing how do you how
[42:12] do you prove what's taking place in an
[42:15] invisible
[42:17] realm see brother Brandon said it like
[42:20] this when he's talking about even within
[42:22] imagination he says you realize he said
[42:25] that you could have he says he said we
[42:28] could sit right here and I could say
[42:29] well there goes the pillar of fire he
[42:31] said and you know he says you may not
[42:33] see it but then again he said maybe you
[42:35] would and we'd be sitting there oh my
[42:38] there it is he said but we've got even a
[42:40] greater
[42:42] confirmation than that you would think
[42:45] what's greater than being able to see it
[42:47] right right because brother Ram says see
[42:50] by me telling you that if you get to a
[42:53] place he said to where I'm saying that
[42:55] to you and you come to such a place to
[42:58] where you start seeing things that
[42:59] aren't even
[43:00] there right right right this I'm right
[43:05] out of the message and quote it yes sir
[43:07] brother Bram goes in to say he said but
[43:09] we've got something greater than that we
[43:11] have the photograph that was taken
[43:15] Hallelujah there's no imagination to
[43:18] that whatsoever yes sir that's the same
[43:21] thing it is right here in that invisible
[43:23] realm they can't see what's taking place
[43:25] in that invisible isible realm but
[43:27] here's what's happening there's a
[43:28] connection that's being made Jesus saw
[43:31] their faith and their faith was
[43:34] unlocking more than what they even went
[43:37] there
[43:38] for your will unlock all
[43:45] the with one need in your life that God
[43:48] sees a greater
[43:50] need presence it unlocks that the faith
[43:54] that you have in your heart to rec
[43:56] recognize all that I have need of
[43:58] there's this need there's this need
[43:59] there's this need and it unlocks
[44:01] everything and the very thing that maybe
[44:04] you had on your heart this morning I
[44:06] need God to minister to this I need God
[44:08] to minister to this and in his presence
[44:11] God comes down and deals with something
[44:13] that's of a much higher priority
[44:17] Hallelujah
[44:19] God that's the leadership of the Holy
[44:22] Spirit personally to you and I because
[44:25] we need that guidance sometimes the
[44:27] things that we think that really really
[44:29] really matter and this is really really
[44:32] important and if I can just get this
[44:33] taking care of if I can just get this
[44:35] settled if I can just get this and
[44:37] remember that's us trying to shift for
[44:39] ourselves not saying that it's not a
[44:42] real need but when we get in the
[44:44] presence of God everything and all that
[44:46] we have to do is do what he is asking
[44:50] you to do hallelujah amen you want a
[44:54] miracle in your life do what God says do
[44:58] when they ran out of the wine he said
[45:01] here Mary said to them said just take
[45:04] these empty pictures take them to him
[45:06] and whatever he tells you to do do it
[45:09] amen don't ask any questions just do it
[45:13] you see it's not your business or my
[45:16] business to turn the water into one
[45:18] that's God's
[45:20] business you can't do that I can't do
[45:22] that the woman that had uh the need the
[45:26] of zarapa that had a need for her and
[45:28] her son they were running out of
[45:30] substance in their home and here she
[45:33] walks
[45:35] over and she doesn't know it but God has
[45:38] spoke to the prophet God dries up the
[45:41] waterbrook and sends the prophet the
[45:44] same time he speaks to him and says I've
[45:46] commanded a widow woman to sustain me
[45:48] she doesn't know it she wasn't asked in
[45:51] the conversation her feelings about that
[45:53] weren't even
[45:54] considered because I wonder if God had
[45:57] asked her she probably would have been
[45:59] able to respond Lord you know there's
[46:01] only enough for me and my son maybe at
[46:05] that time there might have been enough
[46:07] for two KS but when by the time the
[46:09] prophet got there there was only enough
[46:10] for one k yes is that right yeah and you
[46:14] see it's when you come down to even that
[46:16] principle it shows us there's only
[46:18] really one thing that God
[46:20] wants it wasn't the one cake it was God
[46:23] wanted her will surrender
[46:27] Hallelujah prise
[46:28] [Applause]
[46:30] God she went she would go to that meal
[46:33] she go to that oil oh my you know she's
[46:36] get lower she's get lower she what about
[46:38] all the Mind battles and the worries and
[46:41] and the thoughts and things coming that
[46:43] way but when she had submitted to the
[46:46] word of God oh she never had to worry
[46:51] another day about the meal barel or the
[46:55] Cru
[46:57] GL I I I don't believe that God you know
[47:00] had her build another room on the house
[47:02] and say here you're going to have so
[47:03] much meal we need to make a storage
[47:05] seller no that's not what
[47:08] happened but what has shown is is what
[47:11] was needed for that day it was
[47:14] sufficient amen hallelujah showing that
[47:17] as we follow the word of the Lord she
[47:19] from that day on she liveed by thus
[47:23] sayith the Lord amen once sent his
[47:26] Prophet down with a word and here she
[47:28] was standing there now she's living by
[47:31] thus sayith the lord it's not about is
[47:34] this going to run out she can go to the
[47:36] meal Barrel make the cake that was
[47:38] needed for her for her son the oil that
[47:41] was needed maybe she could look down
[47:43] there and you know it seemed like there
[47:45] it is there's just going to be enough
[47:47] for another time but you know what it
[47:49] was enough and sufficient for each day
[47:52] and let me just say this God has
[47:54] everything that you have need
[47:56] of knows exactly when to bring it to
[47:59] your life hallelujah what you can handle
[48:03] at what time the only thing he requires
[48:06] is one thing that simple obedience that
[48:08] simple yielding simple surrendering and
[48:11] God gives to us just what we have need
[48:13] of Hallelujah here she was she invited
[48:17] the presence of the Lord right there in
[48:19] her home it had an effect upon the
[48:22] Natural Things of life amen is that
[48:25] right
[48:26] even there when her son and when her son
[48:29] would pass but notice the prince of God
[48:32] being invited there in her home there
[48:35] came a
[48:36] resurrection
[48:38] Hallelujah because why she made place
[48:40] for the presence of God let me just say
[48:42] this with everything you do in life
[48:44] every decision always make room for the
[48:47] presence of God hallelujah good make
[48:50] room for his presence amen Abraham
[48:54] himself could not change Sarah's
[48:57] thinking he could not dissolve Sarah's
[48:59] will even though Abraham had had an
[49:03] experience and had encounter after
[49:05] encounter with God but it took God to
[49:09] move personally for Sarah's life yes
[49:12] wonderful but how did that come about
[49:14] because Abraham was a channel for the
[49:17] presence of God to come into that home
[49:19] that's right and you might look and say
[49:22] well my husband or my wife or my this
[49:25] listen you personally can't go and
[49:28] change them or reform them but what you
[49:31] can do and what's greater is to be a
[49:33] channel for the presence hallelujah
[49:36] hallelujah yes even when you look on
[49:38] your workplace everybody else that
[49:40] stands on that line where you were this
[49:43] one over here this one over there you
[49:45] can't control those people but as a Son
[49:47] of God that place that you are given to
[49:49] stand you yourself can say Lord if
[49:52] there's nobody else here in this Factory
[49:54] I'm sent here here as a Son of God as a
[49:57] daughter of God to invite the presence
[49:59] of God right here on this assembly Glory
[50:03] Hallelujah and it has an effect on these
[50:05] things around us that's what this
[50:07] message came to do this message it come
[50:11] to bring God personally to you and I
[50:15] Hallelujah we couldn't see clearly we
[50:18] couldn't see clearly even like as it was
[50:21] there in Eden there was a cheram that
[50:24] was to keep the way in the Pres of God
[50:26] after Calvary now the Holy Spirit Goes
[50:29] Forth remember it's already started to
[50:32] be declared through the ministry uh of
[50:35] the son of man of the Lord Jesus he was
[50:37] declaring even in that time the spirit
[50:39] of the Lord is upon me he ha anointed me
[50:42] to preach the gospel to the poor to bind
[50:45] up the Brokenhearted to loosen the
[50:47] captives recovering of sight to the
[50:49] blind to preach the acceptable year of
[50:51] the Lord it was already an announcement
[50:54] that was taking place
[50:56] and now the spirit of God is not keeping
[50:59] the people away but the presence of God
[51:02] is to run or direct guide the people
[51:06] into that place hallelujah hallelujah
[51:09] that's why that the revealing of the
[51:12] word in this hour through through a
[51:14] prophet through a messenger remember
[51:17] they're the Candlestick there are the
[51:19] stars and brother R tells us that of how
[51:21] when he takes that of the Tabernacle
[51:23] that they themselves are reflect
[51:25] ctions they take that light and he says
[51:28] it's reflected there upon that labor
[51:31] it's reflected on that way that we might
[51:34] enter back into a place of certainty I
[51:36] have family members uh many have passed
[51:39] on that are a part of other uh you know
[51:42] uh organizations and things like that
[51:44] and and I I I affirmatively believe what
[51:47] the prophet told us in the sense uh he
[51:50] says if the Catholic man is trusting in
[51:52] his church he he lost that's right but
[51:55] if he's trusting in Jesus Christ he's
[51:57] saved that's right it doesn't make him
[51:59] in the brght but he's saved that's right
[52:01] amen I thank God for that yes but we can
[52:04] see that what God has done in this hour
[52:07] is brought a certainty to you and I amen
[52:09] we look at and say well that was the
[52:11] Holy Spirit well it's true God uses the
[52:14] instrumentality remember he will do
[52:16] nothing but he first reveal his secrets
[52:20] to his servants to prophets way
[52:23] Hallelujah can't break that order but
[52:25] notice within that part of it it was to
[52:28] bring about a certainty within the lives
[52:31] of the people that's what's taking place
[52:34] down through every one of the Gentile
[52:37] Church ages Hallelujah is God would send
[52:40] the word that would bring there an
[52:43] establishment to The People Under The
[52:45] Light under the portion that God had
[52:47] allotted for that moment but you and I
[52:50] are living in the advancement of the
[52:52] Gospel not because we're any better
[52:55] right right brother right we're a part
[52:56] of the body the body's been made up all
[52:59] the way down through the
[53:01] seven the stones like in Solomon's
[53:04] Temple com from here and there they've
[53:06] been assembled Through the Ages but now
[53:09] we're standing in a time where the
[53:11] mystery of God is finished Hallelujah
[53:15] and that mystery of God it's Christ
[53:17] himself in the life of the believer
[53:20] Hallelujah because this message of
[53:23] restoration was not to rest rest us back
[53:25] to the Ephesian age she was already a
[53:28] fallen woman right this message is to
[53:31] restore us back to that of what they had
[53:35] on the day of
[53:36] Pentecost Christ in his
[53:39] fullness in the body of the
[53:42] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah yes and
[53:45] this is exactly where the word has
[53:47] brought you and I to in this hour with
[53:50] such a certainty to become such a
[53:53] channel that the Holy Spirit oh my as
[53:56] the prophet could say that comes such a
[53:58] power in the bride that will literally
[54:01] draw them out of the graves how does
[54:04] that happen by heing life hallelujah
[54:07] it's everyday living Glory it's not
[54:09] until all of a sudden we get to one
[54:11] point in our life and my we've reached
[54:13] that point no it's everyday living
[54:15] hallelujah it's just like right here
[54:17] today it's putting one step in front of
[54:19] the other one foot in front of the other
[54:21] yes the Bible said that Enoch walked
[54:24] with God
[54:26] Hallelujah Enoch had come into God's
[54:28] presence and Enoch
[54:30] himself he loved the presence of God yes
[54:34] Bible said he had a testimony yes before
[54:37] his translation that he pleased God yes
[54:39] Lord yes Lord and one day as he's taking
[54:42] a
[54:44] stroll and evidently God had made known
[54:47] to
[54:48] Enoch and brother Bram tells us like
[54:51] this and it becometh us to fulfill all
[54:52] righteousness he said Enoch didn't want
[54:54] to go
[54:56] right powerful statement yes it is and
[54:58] you would think well why wouldn't you
[54:59] want to go my that is kind of carnal no
[55:03] no Enoch enjoyed his family yes he
[55:07] enjoyed that which was around him but
[55:10] see God needed a tip for you and I amen
[55:14] yes yes and God setting a tip for you
[55:17] and I here Enoch came to that result it
[55:21] becometh us to fulfill
[55:24] all amen he was a type for you and I so
[55:27] how did how did Enoch live his life well
[55:31] when trouble came in the family he
[55:33] walked with God Amen yes situations came
[55:36] up on the job he walked with God
[55:38] hallelujah right when things took place
[55:41] that was very difficult you walked with
[55:43] God Amen that is the secret of your
[55:46] Victory Hallelujah is your walk with God
[55:50] remember Cain when things didn't take
[55:53] place the way Cain thought they should
[55:55] take place we just bringing this down a
[55:58] little application way Cain brought
[56:02] fruits Abel it was revealed by the
[56:05] spirit of God what to bring and Abel
[56:08] brought that of blood right the life of
[56:11] an innocent one pain brought all of his
[56:14] efforts fruits he wasn't a smart ell he
[56:18] brought he brought good fruits you know
[56:20] he didn't bring these make believe
[56:22] things they sell at the supermarkets
[56:23] today
[56:26] you know tomatoes that don't look like
[56:27] tomatoes Tomatoes aren't perfectly round
[56:32] sorry but he brought those things and
[56:36] when God refused it how did he know God
[56:40] refused it because he saw God vindicate
[56:45] Abel's sacrifice God's presence came
[56:48] down upon the sacrifice but not only did
[56:51] it consume the sacrifice it was a
[56:53] witness the Abel was righteous
[56:56] Hallelujah yes that Abel had received
[56:59] from God and he simply did what God told
[57:02] him to do hallelujah amen where did Cain
[57:05] get that of bringing of bringing the
[57:07] fruit he got it from the teaching he was
[57:10] under that's right Adam and EV was
[57:13] teaching that you know why to hide
[57:15] themselves that's why I love about this
[57:18] message I love about this word the
[57:20] evening light that shined upon the word
[57:22] it's not there uh it it's strips down
[57:25] all dishonesty it strips down all
[57:28] deceitfulness why so there's not a veil
[57:30] between you and God hallelujah that you
[57:33] can come right back into the presence
[57:35] ofy God it's not pretending it's not
[57:39] putting you out here and giving you and
[57:41] and telling you something and then you
[57:43] think why am I in the same shape I'm in
[57:45] why am I in the same condition but it's
[57:47] God opening up the
[57:49] wayah what do I have to do look and live
[57:53] what he's telling you to do y to it
[57:55] don't try to figure it out just yield to
[57:57] his presence
[57:59] Hallelujah Glory here in that moment
[58:03] here stands Kain you know how brother
[58:05] brandham kind of puts the word to it he
[58:07] says kind of the attitude he said even
[58:10] among people today came took that
[58:12] approach when God said if you'll just
[58:14] worship like your brother I'll accept
[58:17] you right even the mercy of God right
[58:21] Cain was not going to become a if I
[58:23] could say it a bride elect member but if
[58:26] Cain would have just had respect unto
[58:28] them you know what I don't understand it
[58:30] but I I got to admit God vindicates that
[58:34] right yes yes and just had respect to it
[58:36] you know that's what that's what
[58:38] Nicodemus did yes that's what Gia did
[58:42] right yes Gia himself did not see the
[58:44] light that was being presented in that
[58:47] hour but Gia could say it like this he
[58:49] could say if God is with it you're going
[58:52] to be fighting against God that's right
[58:55] not of God come to not that's a
[58:57] principle with everything in our life if
[59:00] God's not behind it it'll come to not
[59:04] right yes sir but it's in those moments
[59:07] we want to learn we want to draw and say
[59:09] Lord help me I I don't want to be found
[59:12] wasting time and I that's not for us to
[59:15] be put on a place of becoming fearful
[59:17] and wavering of oh I I you know I want
[59:20] to be so careful here I I want to no if
[59:23] God's called you to do something do it
[59:25] amen that's right amen right right
[59:28] Hallelujah follow what God has had you
[59:30] what God has you to do but Cain the
[59:32] Bible says he went out of the presence
[59:34] of the Lord yes right when God refused
[59:37] it he walked out of the God's presence
[59:40] yes sir what a what a terrible thing yes
[59:43] sir yes sir the the one who was there to
[59:46] even to extend Mercy to help him it went
[59:50] away from the presence of God brother BR
[59:53] would say it like this he says and
[59:54] that's where you or I will fail the very
[59:59] minute yes we walk out of the presence
[1:00:02] of God right right brother right you see
[1:00:05] even God's presence around your life do
[1:00:07] you realize even your attitude invites
[1:00:10] his presence amen your thoughts amen
[1:00:13] toward one another amen it can either
[1:00:15] keep his presence at Bay or invited amen
[1:00:19] that's why the atmosphere and everything
[1:00:21] that's why even the where Satan wants to
[1:00:23] attack you in your mind wants to attack
[1:00:26] you in your home yes right because what
[1:00:28] it is as a Channel of God he knows he
[1:00:32] knows he cannot overcome or defeat the
[1:00:36] presence of God working of the belie
[1:00:39] that's right let me just sayah
[1:00:42] electricity could flow through my body
[1:00:44] but I was not built to be a conductor of
[1:00:47] it right that's right there's wires in
[1:00:50] this in these walls to these Outlets
[1:00:52] that those wiring that they have in in
[1:00:54] here I don't know I'm not even going to
[1:00:56] try to go into specifics but it has been
[1:00:59] designed to handle it right yes the
[1:01:02] curent and to be able to channel it to a
[1:01:06] destination yes sir that's why in this
[1:01:08] hour as an elect seed of God you are an
[1:01:13] ordained Channel amen amen yes not just
[1:01:17] that the Holy Spirit falls upon you and
[1:01:20] remember like brother B said the
[1:01:22] Pentecostals he said they blow it all
[1:01:24] out the Smoke Stack but where the spirit
[1:01:27] of God moves upon your life the presence
[1:01:30] of God moves upon your life but it's not
[1:01:32] something to that that is to depart but
[1:01:35] it's to move through your life
[1:01:38] Hallelujah that's
[1:01:39] a yes then that's where you have to
[1:01:42] evaluate in your life you have to I have
[1:01:44] to amen because it's so easy for the
[1:01:49] channels of Our Lives to become clogged
[1:01:52] up with so many different things yes sir
[1:01:55] yes sir
[1:01:57] unintentional unintentional sometimes
[1:01:59] offenses sometimes hurts sometimes the
[1:02:02] things of life sometimes there's things
[1:02:04] that we can even carry from our
[1:02:07] childhood that we we sometimes you don't
[1:02:09] even realize that how can you realize
[1:02:11] things that's right you know how can you
[1:02:12] unless God helps you in I right brother
[1:02:15] right true right you say well brother s
[1:02:17] why didn't God deal with that remember
[1:02:20] God's a god of priority yes amen God
[1:02:23] prepares just like he did on day one of
[1:02:26] creation God prepares on day one to
[1:02:29] sustain what's coming on day
[1:02:31] two then on day three oh so forth so
[1:02:34] it's one building that's the same thing
[1:02:36] God works with your life Hallelujah
[1:02:38] that's why God works that's why first
[1:02:40] God working in your life with
[1:02:42] justification it makes way for
[1:02:44] sanctification Hallelujah sanctification
[1:02:47] makes way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:49] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:52] makes a way for the Holy Ghost himself
[1:02:55] it's god making a way for himself
[1:02:57] Hallelujah to even these things in your
[1:03:00] life in my life things that you know I
[1:03:03] think of how the prophet's standing
[1:03:04] there and you know he doesn't as a man
[1:03:08] doesn't know this person but God knows
[1:03:10] the person yes Hallelujah and you know
[1:03:12] you and I think about it and these are
[1:03:15] certain statements that I just I I don't
[1:03:17] know I I just chewed on for years and
[1:03:20] looked at it I glory to me because I you
[1:03:24] see friends that even in the midst of
[1:03:27] God fulfilling his word God shows us how
[1:03:30] personal that he is and concerned about
[1:03:34] every part of our life think about it
[1:03:38] for the Lord Jesus let me just move to
[1:03:40] that point just a moment to the Lord
[1:03:42] Jesus here he is standing here on Earth
[1:03:45] the importance of redemption and yet he
[1:03:48] looks upon the multitude and he sees
[1:03:51] their hungry naturally yes yes
[1:03:56] naturally and he takes notice of that he
[1:03:58] says look we we we've got to take care
[1:04:00] of their needs we we we need to take
[1:04:02] care we don't have this much we only
[1:04:03] have this we can't you know and they're
[1:04:05] looking at what they have but Jesus is
[1:04:07] saying this is what I see is the need so
[1:04:10] when he sees the knee remember he is
[1:04:14] more than enough amen when God points
[1:04:17] out a KN that's in our life he is
[1:04:20] Jehovah ja amen and when the prophet
[1:04:23] could stand there there and God would
[1:04:25] transport him to different places like
[1:04:29] of the one sister there was also a young
[1:04:31] man that had happen to where you see
[1:04:33] them bound with
[1:04:36] nervousness yes right sometimes I know
[1:04:40] our makeups we can be prone to some of
[1:04:43] those things if God gives us Grace to re
[1:04:45] over it amen reigning is also
[1:04:48] Deliverance too amen yes Hallelujah but
[1:04:51] to see that you were chased by a yellow
[1:04:53] dog
[1:04:54] it speaks to the young man that has
[1:04:56] affected your nerves clear down to this
[1:04:58] day right yes 30 something years old but
[1:05:02] it goes right back down through its life
[1:05:05] and picks these things up what was it it
[1:05:07] was necessary at that moment why didn't
[1:05:10] God pick it up sooner why didn't god
[1:05:12] well I don't know I'm not here to give
[1:05:14] that answer I'm not here to put all that
[1:05:16] out but I just want to say this right
[1:05:17] here the Bible say he does all things
[1:05:21] beautiful Glory Hallelujah
[1:05:31] Hallelujah but all I know is is that it
[1:05:34] was at that moment it was able for that
[1:05:37] to move and to recognize and God to go
[1:05:39] down into the depth of that life let me
[1:05:42] say this that same almighty God what you
[1:05:45] saw what we rep what was represented
[1:05:48] there in the in in in the services
[1:05:51] service after service where God coming
[1:05:54] and God taking there uh the body the
[1:05:57] life of a prophet and God manifesting
[1:06:00] himself through let me say this this is
[1:06:02] why that when we look at in this hour in
[1:06:05] this moment when we speak of the
[1:06:07] revealing of the son of man it's the
[1:06:09] same Christ himself come down and move
[1:06:13] and operate through the ministry of a
[1:06:16] prophet Hallelujah same God coming back
[1:06:19] Among Us yes not the prophet but God was
[1:06:22] veiled in that prophet and that's why
[1:06:24] the prophet could say clear back in the
[1:06:26] late 50s he says oh he said to think he
[1:06:29] said this ministry the revealing of the
[1:06:32] son of man Hallelujah and we look and
[1:06:34] say well that the seals hadn't even been
[1:06:36] open but it was Christ
[1:06:39] alone that's why when brother R preaches
[1:06:41] the seven seal and people are looking
[1:06:44] for for something out here and something
[1:06:46] he takes them through the whole expans
[1:06:49] amen of what's been happening yes this
[1:06:52] event this testimony this event this
[1:06:55] testimony it was a walk on the road of
[1:06:58] emus it was a Luke 24 that's where are
[1:07:02] standing in the presence of almighty god
[1:07:06] listen and that with Christ right here
[1:07:09] become visible manifest Among Us he's in
[1:07:12] a bright body
[1:07:16] yes he's not in your life individually
[1:07:19] in his fullness but he's in the portion
[1:07:22] right yes is the fullness of the spirit
[1:07:25] of God in this hour it's a full measure
[1:07:28] a full word yes and to think what did
[1:07:31] what did that walk on the road to emus
[1:07:34] do well he met some people on the road
[1:07:36] to emus that were a little discouraged
[1:07:39] that's right they were disheartened yes
[1:07:41] yes they were sad brother BR called them
[1:07:43] bewildered they couldn't figure out the
[1:07:45] events that's taking place how do we
[1:07:47] make sense out of this right that's just
[1:07:50] nothing has happened the way we thought
[1:07:51] it ought to happen right that's right
[1:07:53] brother look where they were going they
[1:07:54] were going from the presence of the Lord
[1:07:57] wow they weren't going to Jerusalem they
[1:07:59] left Jerusalem they were on their way
[1:08:02] away from Jerusalem and God promised he
[1:08:04] would pour out his Spirit good
[1:08:06] Hallelujah but he's a faithful
[1:08:12] Shepherd
[1:08:15] Hallelujah he came and he you might have
[1:08:19] been disheartened yes yes sir you might
[1:08:22] have been discouraged yes sir
[1:08:24] you might have looked at your life and
[1:08:25] said I thought I had something I
[1:08:27] realized I don't have what I thought I
[1:08:28] have but remember all of every
[1:08:31] experience is not in
[1:08:33] vain he said what do you mean brother
[1:08:35] Samuel when he came on the road to emus
[1:08:39] when he came to the end he made us
[1:08:41] though he would go on but he just as he
[1:08:43] was talking with
[1:08:44] them they just their hearts were
[1:08:48] burning they got to a place that says
[1:08:51] I'm going to see if this one will be my
[1:08:53] my
[1:08:56] friendall to see if they'll friend
[1:08:59] me and invited him in and when he got in
[1:09:04] there among them he did
[1:09:07] something of what he had done before yes
[1:09:10] said let them know this has been
[1:09:13] him the whole time hallelujah
[1:09:16] hallelujah amen and he led them to a
[1:09:20] place of recovery yes they had fallen
[1:09:25] from away from in discouragement and
[1:09:29] disheartenment beautiful he went think
[1:09:32] about it here he is leading them oh he
[1:09:34] knows about Peter he knows he knows
[1:09:36] about Peter he knows he's already told
[1:09:39] you remember he's already told them and
[1:09:41] there's already been news coming Peter's
[1:09:43] already went to the tomb but here he
[1:09:44] comes in in their
[1:09:47] midst even after Peter sat in there and
[1:09:49] saying my you know I I went on a rampage
[1:09:52] and I went on this I went on that you
[1:09:53] see he was there to recover them amen
[1:09:57] from all their discouragement and
[1:09:58] disheartenment and what was he doing
[1:10:01] here the presence of the Lord came to
[1:10:04] them where they were at Hallelujah and
[1:10:08] would leave them from there the Bible
[1:10:11] says that he comes after being with them
[1:10:13] 30 to 40 days he comes out there among
[1:10:18] them and he leads them to the Mount
[1:10:22] called he Mak known to them there of his
[1:10:27] promise go wait go wait in the city of
[1:10:32] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:10:34] from on high in other words this
[1:10:36] presence that you've experienced the
[1:10:39] Miracles that you've seen everything
[1:10:41] that has taken
[1:10:43] place it's been about
[1:10:46] you yes the experiences down through
[1:10:49] life God's hand upon your life has all
[1:10:52] been god making KN his love and his care
[1:10:55] for you amen bring you into that place
[1:10:59] that now as a channel his life flows
[1:11:02] through amen yes so here they are now in
[1:11:08] the presence of God directed back to the
[1:11:11] rightful place they need to be amen
[1:11:15] isn't it incredible that when you or I
[1:11:18] could go astray from God's presence and
[1:11:21] say I don't know I
[1:11:25] understand I I feel like a
[1:11:27] failure feel
[1:11:29] discouraged he listen brother B got to
[1:11:32] that place in those times too right yes
[1:11:35] he got to those times but you know what
[1:11:38] the prince of God would lead him reach
[1:11:42] out and bring him back into that
[1:11:45] place where the true identity was at
[1:11:50] amen even as brother BR was getting
[1:11:53] ready to go way remember the complex and
[1:11:55] all and all those things that it
[1:11:56] developed and there's many other parts
[1:11:57] that I I love I love those things being
[1:12:00] uh expressed there in the word to me
[1:12:02] it's to me it's such encouragement
[1:12:04] because I see it all the way through the
[1:12:05] scriptures yes you see that of how that
[1:12:07] God's presence will come to seek you and
[1:12:10] I out and bring us back into his
[1:12:13] presence yes you see you see what a
[1:12:15] blessing it is that for you that you
[1:12:19] just don't come into church or at home
[1:12:23] and you think wow boy I just I just felt
[1:12:26] the presence of God oh that's wonderful
[1:12:28] and then continue on what a blessing it
[1:12:31] is that when his presence comes what's
[1:12:34] it to do it's to move
[1:12:38] amen sure when his presence comes it'll
[1:12:40] bring it brings conviction in our heart
[1:12:42] right the Bible said when the presence
[1:12:44] of the Lord came walking in the garden
[1:12:46] they realized they were
[1:12:47] naked that's the value of his presence
[1:12:50] coming right Among Us in the services
[1:12:52] that's the value of being in his
[1:12:54] presence Hallelujah even as we walk day
[1:12:56] to day David said I have set the lord
[1:12:58] always before me he's at my right hand I
[1:13:01] shall not be moved it's the value of
[1:13:04] being in God's presence that God would
[1:13:06] lead me God would guide me God would
[1:13:08] direct me where there's things at work
[1:13:10] things in school things in the family
[1:13:12] things in the church Lord I want to I
[1:13:14] want to be led by you yes presence is
[1:13:18] there to direct us and it's something
[1:13:20] that it just I'm I'm to me I'm thankful
[1:13:23] that and I I'm grateful for that that
[1:13:25] it's not just like boy I felt the
[1:13:27] presence of God my it just we just go on
[1:13:30] no but we take that and say
[1:13:32] Lord when your presence comes
[1:13:35] Hallelujah you don't waste time
[1:13:39] Hallelujah but when God is making his
[1:13:41] presence known as he deals personally
[1:13:43] and speaks personally to your heart
[1:13:45] that's God letting you know what he
[1:13:46] thinks about you he's letting you know
[1:13:49] what he sees in your life that's deeper
[1:13:52] than what you can see Hallelujah and the
[1:13:55] thing that he's wanting just to bring
[1:13:56] out of our life is to yield to him and
[1:14:00] then from that moment he will lead us
[1:14:03] and guide us into all truth amen amen
[1:14:07] right he's the one who helps us and
[1:14:09] strengthens us think of how brother Bram
[1:14:12] standing there with sister mey remember
[1:14:14] she was all tore up the house you know
[1:14:18] all the confusion that was in the house
[1:14:20] and what was taking place but notice
[1:14:22] what happened
[1:14:24] is the prophet saw that there was a need
[1:14:26] that was there his wife was all tore up
[1:14:29] kids were fighting over blocks it wasn't
[1:14:32] because his wife was a sister mey was a
[1:14:35] just a bad woman you know his his his
[1:14:38] children oh boy they just what it was is
[1:14:41] the atmosphere had to be changed yes
[1:14:45] amen and that's when that atmosphere
[1:14:48] changed and the prophet could stand
[1:14:50] there as a son of God to me brothers and
[1:14:54] sisters when I when I read of the storm
[1:14:58] the snowstorm in Colorado being spoken
[1:15:02] to I I I may not speak to a snowstorm
[1:15:05] here that's that's not the storms that
[1:15:06] I'm worried about right there's storms
[1:15:10] in my life there's storms that comes in
[1:15:12] your life yes God took those examples of
[1:15:16] things that was even
[1:15:18] forecasting even where brother Brandon
[1:15:20] could say you brethren need to get on
[1:15:24] down and out of here because that snow's
[1:15:27] coming there can be things that's
[1:15:29] forecast in your life good there can be
[1:15:32] family strains and things that's down
[1:15:34] through your life but let me just tell
[1:15:36] you something there is a living God a
[1:15:40] Living Word a living presence that God
[1:15:44] himself changes forecast Hallelujah
[1:15:49] glory
[1:15:50] amen his presence is more than enough
[1:15:55] Hallelujah his presence is who he is
[1:15:58] it's his word being revealed it changes
[1:16:01] us from Glory unto Glory yes Hallelujah
[1:16:06] just as we abide in his presence you
[1:16:09] know if there's one thing we can say is
[1:16:11] Lord I may not see in my life what I
[1:16:15] want to see right
[1:16:18] now may not see what you have called
[1:16:23] ordained maybe I can't see all of that
[1:16:24] fully yet in my life there's one thing
[1:16:27] that I do know is where I was before I'm
[1:16:31] no longer there hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:34] Glory you see what did that his presence
[1:16:38] yes and you yielding to his presence and
[1:16:41] seeing something beyond what you could
[1:16:43] see hallelujah amen God be to deliver
[1:16:47] his thoughts to you which was beyond
[1:16:49] your thoughts of your son glory and
[1:16:51] that's why he said my thoughts are
[1:16:54] higher than
[1:16:55] yours my ways are
[1:16:58] higher Glory because when God comes he
[1:17:01] doesn't leave us where he finds us right
[1:17:06] we might have been going away maybe in
[1:17:08] maybe even in your in your heart in your
[1:17:10] spirit maybe for you maybe you've been
[1:17:13] kind of journeying away from the place
[1:17:15] that you belong maybe you even in your
[1:17:18] position even in your even in your way
[1:17:23] God has called you to be God is his
[1:17:26] presence comes to draw us right back to
[1:17:28] that place to say hey don't go away from
[1:17:31] Jerusalem get back to Jerusalem am amen
[1:17:34] yes yes Lord I tried to do this and it
[1:17:37] seems like my family is going this way
[1:17:39] and I've tried to do this and it seems
[1:17:41] like instead of instead of instead of
[1:17:44] becoming overwhelmed and
[1:17:47] discouraged by the
[1:17:50] lack of fruit or what you're not seeing
[1:17:54] just say
[1:17:56] Lord I I know if it's something that is
[1:18:00] just been me that's been doing it and
[1:18:03] I'm asking you to teach my hands
[1:18:05] Hallelujah I'm asking you to help me
[1:18:07] Lord and if there has been things that
[1:18:09] I've been doing right then help me to be
[1:18:11] patient amen amen
[1:18:15] glory because you know in your life when
[1:18:18] we look here in the
[1:18:20] scriptures perhaps in your Bible to
[1:18:23] you'll read this you'll see in the New
[1:18:25] Testament Red Letters black
[1:18:29] letters red letters is that where the
[1:18:33] writers would would write this was the
[1:18:35] words of the Lord Jesus the words were
[1:18:37] spoken word by
[1:18:39] word then you have the black
[1:18:41] letters you know without the black
[1:18:43] letters you wouldn't have the red
[1:18:45] letters that's right it makes a way it
[1:18:49] makes a a point of
[1:18:51] contrast that's the same God does is he
[1:18:53] works within your life there's days in
[1:18:57] our life we can have a lot of black
[1:19:00] letter days strong together yes good but
[1:19:04] just be patient Hallelujah day coming
[1:19:08] amen hallelujah I don't want to just say
[1:19:10] a day I'll say a moment coming amen
[1:19:13] because it's just like in your life
[1:19:15] Enoch as we said and I'm just I'm just
[1:19:17] trying to come to a spot of closing
[1:19:19] Enoch walked with God wonder how many
[1:19:21] black letter days he walked with God but
[1:19:24] you walk with God and some of the days
[1:19:26] that you walk with God or I walk with
[1:19:28] God I don't feel him like I do other
[1:19:30] days right well then how am I walking
[1:19:33] with God because I'm walking with his
[1:19:34] word amen God is his word amen so it's
[1:19:39] not then about my feelings I love don't
[1:19:41] get me wrong I love to feel his presence
[1:19:43] amen I love to see God I love to hear
[1:19:46] from him love to see him work I love to
[1:19:48] see testimonies but there are also those
[1:19:50] times that God brings us to recogniz as
[1:19:53] we walk with him there's days that are
[1:19:55] black letter days that lead the red
[1:19:57] letter moments amen right in order for
[1:20:00] the fire to come there on Mount carel
[1:20:03] Elijah had to get the stones together he
[1:20:06] had to get put the wood in order to put
[1:20:08] the sacrifice in
[1:20:10] order but all of that was with the
[1:20:12] preparation and the presence of God
[1:20:15] would come visible the amen sometimes of
[1:20:19] things that God has you doing that maybe
[1:20:21] don't feel so
[1:20:23] spiritual so Supernatural right right
[1:20:28] but it's necessary arrangements yes in
[1:20:32] order for the presence of God to come
[1:20:34] down amen yes God knows the need he
[1:20:37] knows your situation it's mindful yes
[1:20:41] amen amen that's the authority we have
[1:20:43] in his presence amen as a son and
[1:20:47] daughter of God Amen perhaps we'll pick
[1:20:49] it up just a little bit more here this
[1:20:51] afternoon let's just bow our heads and
[1:20:53] our hearts in
[1:20:58] pray oh
[1:21:01] Hallelujah I wonder how many be
[1:21:04] one with an uplifted
[1:21:07] hand Lord remember
[1:21:10] me Amen Hallelujah Lord remember me no
[1:21:14] matter where you're at no matter the
[1:21:17] journey remember God himself is the one
[1:21:20] who
[1:21:21] recovers Resto is the one who renews
[1:21:25] he's the one who guides us he knows
[1:21:26] about every need and every
[1:21:29] situation remember that atmosphere
[1:21:31] what's happening here even in this
[1:21:33] moment as we come together as Believers
[1:21:35] the Bible said we two or three agree as
[1:21:37] touching any one thing it shall be done
[1:21:40] he also said he'd be here in our midst
[1:21:42] so right here in the presence of
[1:21:46] almighty
[1:21:48] God this is where situations change you
[1:21:52] might say Brother Sam you don't know my
[1:21:54] situation at home well it's not all
[1:21:58] together at
[1:21:59] home that maybe needs to change maybe
[1:22:02] it's your outlook on it maybe it's the
[1:22:06] attitude maybe there's a channel maybe
[1:22:08] there's something down there that the
[1:22:10] Holy Spirit to bring to light and for
[1:22:12] him to clear out that channel in your
[1:22:15] life maybe it's for you to become a
[1:22:18] yielded Channel maybe you're like a wire
[1:22:21] that you're built to handle the current
[1:22:24] built to channel it but you've you've
[1:22:27] not been placed in where you need to be
[1:22:31] but the Holy
[1:22:32] Spirit his presence is here to take and
[1:22:36] to place you just where you need to be
[1:22:38] that you might be hallelu a Chanel
[1:22:41] Hallelujah see brother Samuel what
[1:22:43] Authority is that I want you to
[1:22:45] understand you've got more Authority
[1:22:47] than what you think in the presence of
[1:22:49] almighty
[1:22:51] God there's a habit that a besetting sin
[1:22:56] way something that you have not been
[1:22:59] able to
[1:23:01] overcome you as a son and daughter of
[1:23:03] God have an authority right now yes to
[1:23:07] make that decision and say Lord I'm
[1:23:11] going to lay this down at your feet Yes
[1:23:15] Lord that's what the atmosphere of the
[1:23:18] Holy Spirit
[1:23:20] brings is a faith to believe that God is
[1:23:25] that is a rewarder of them diligently
[1:23:28] seek thank you
[1:23:30] Jesus why don't you just just let him go
[1:23:33] through every area every channel every
[1:23:35] Avenue whatever that need is that you've
[1:23:39] held behind that hand perhaps it's a
[1:23:42] need even that you hold in a different
[1:23:46] light than when you walked in the door
[1:23:47] maybe there was a different need you had
[1:23:49] on your heart when unspoken pray request
[1:23:52] for asked for but now in his
[1:23:55] presence you see what he sees this is
[1:24:00] the need in this moment like that man
[1:24:04] who was bound with the py the need that
[1:24:06] he had in his life was for his sins to
