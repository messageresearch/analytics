[34:24] myself
[34:25] raise our energy with lesser service in
[34:29] a special way yes Lord with not coming
[34:33] form of fashion where we come Lord in
[34:36] your name cause we know how we exhaust
[34:40] your Lord high above the heavens you are
[34:44] the God of all creation yes Lord we lift
[34:49] up your name because you're worthy to be
[34:52] a great father we have no glory of IO
[34:56] but not bit depending on you this
[34:59] morning as well we have no power allowed
[35:02] yes no revelation of all yes but father
[35:06] we are depending upon you who you bless
[35:09] your people this morning we ask these
[35:12] things in your lovely name Jesus Christ
[35:15] have thine own way they manly the Amen
[35:25] by the grace of God we just want to
[35:29] share if you would thought this morning
[35:31] and I trust that it would be a blessing
[35:34] to you amen I know as a pastor there in
[35:41] Iowa we have been seeing a lot of things
[35:45] come through of what we call the message
[35:49] and by God's grace I trust that God is
[35:53] telling us victory
[35:55] in our lives today all agency we are
[35:59] worshipping as they had a man we love
[36:02] the Lord a man yes and when we think
[36:06] about him we must understand who he is
[36:10] and who were thinking about who were
[36:12] meditating on yes but anyway we want to
[36:17] go ahead I'm gonna say too much but I
[36:20] was studying the message and I saw a
[36:25] quote that inspired me coming from
[36:28] Jehovah Jireh
[36:31] the Prophet goes on and he says I was
[36:35] noticing in this afternoon while I was
[36:38] studying Joe Jordan he is called
[36:43] ammonium and Joel was ridiculed made fun
[36:49] of what a picture today but John was
[36:54] resting in Elohim promise so after the
[37:01] skin worms destroy this body yet in my
[37:05] flesh shall I see God whom I should have
[37:10] seen for myself
[37:12] resting in el-medina and I thought to
[37:17] myself that's it
[37:19] [Music]
[37:20] resting in Ella him that's been sucking
[37:25] this word and Lewis Neville him Ella him
[37:30] Amen is the Lord car seat when we call
[37:36] this lady Lord God it is in the word of
[37:39] el Ella Elohim which means the self
[37:43] existing life there was nothing that
[37:47] existed but here there was no air there
[37:52] was no light there was no sauce there
[37:55] was no world there was nothing else it
[37:59] was God a God alone
[38:03] l-o-l here that we sing that song but I
[38:07] wanna do we understand what we worship
[38:10] me so you know when we talk about Elohim
[38:15] we talk about his attributes and we
[38:19] think we say well God in his Conejo his
[38:22] attributes he he wanted to be a father
[38:25] he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be
[38:28] a healer but you see all of them were in
[38:30] what we would call God's nature
[38:33] understand now because we find out in
[38:37] Peter Peter tells us that we can be
[38:40] partakers of God divine nature be who he
[38:45] is what he is and uh we were grateful
[38:49] with thankful for God it meant to to
[38:53] allow us the Sheep who we worship
[38:56] remember amen at thee oh well when Jesus
[39:02] met the woman at the well he he would go
[39:05] up all the things about discernment and
[39:08] telling her who she wanted how many
[39:10] husbands she had but what profound
[39:13] statement Jesus laid with that God the
[39:16] Father was seeking such as those who
[39:21] would worship Him in spirit and in truth
[39:25] now a lot of us we we we we we face
[39:28] because we can feel this unknown thing
[39:30] in them we can feel his presence you
[39:33] know all of that that that we were there
[39:35] and we have arrived but you must
[39:39] understand there is a death or there's
[39:41] arm a deep thing about that because all
[39:46] people can praise you because the Bible
[39:49] says let everything that hath breath
[39:51] praise the Lord but there are only a few
[39:56] that can truly worship Him in spirit and
[40:00] in truth
[40:01] hallelujah Wow
[40:05] I marvel because people say well I'm I'm
[40:08] worshiping in the spirit well I know
[40:11] that when you worship God in spirit
[40:14] you produce a life there is a life that
[40:17] is produced when God's Spirit lives in
[40:20] healing the best way to worship
[40:23] hallelujah if you are how can I say
[40:27] impersonate the thing that you worship
[40:31] me for example if you see somebody that
[40:35] worships God boy seen the heart stop
[40:39] what does that even if you do you put on
[40:42] a cowboy hat he'll put on the cowboy
[40:44] buckle he'll put on a cowboy shoes and
[40:47] he wants to look exactly like the star
[40:49] that he's worshiping right that's the
[40:52] desecrated worship for the worship is to
[40:55] try to live your life according like the
[40:58] star that you worship II is that right
[41:01] the best ways that worship God is to
[41:04] live my god hallelujah see you and
[41:10] hospice understand with Jesus it is up
[41:14] re gonna meet the scripture say John
[41:18] 4:23 2:24 says but I will come into now
[41:21] here when the true listen that word of
[41:24] true worshipers shall worship the father
[41:27] in spirit and truth for the father
[41:29] seeketh such to worship Him God is a
[41:33] spirit and they that worship Him must
[41:36] worship Him in spirit and in truth is
[41:41] that right now you sure what do you mean
[41:44] understand that Jesus himself though he
[41:48] was God in the flesh the Bible says the
[41:51] fullness of the Godhead dwells in him
[41:54] right how did he worship God I'm told my
[42:00] how did the man Christ Jesus worship I
[42:04] one of the things he says I can do
[42:06] nothing except the father
[42:09] show me tonight mister your private
[42:12] brother said Jesus never healed anyone
[42:18] and Esther drill maja
[42:22] because you find out that Jesus never
[42:26] read a scripture for you in just a
[42:28] minute so you can understand what I'm
[42:30] say a lot of times we think fresh when
[42:35] we think of Jesus
[42:36] yes but Paul said I know not even Jesus
[42:39] after the right tip Paul have a greater
[42:43] revelation of who Jesus what a melon
[42:47] dude
[42:48] Noah thought he didn't stop just at the
[42:50] min Jesus cuz of then Jesus had the
[42:53] street right the man Jesus have you eat
[42:56] all right how do you believe Jesus cry
[43:00] yeah yes but there's a greater entity
[43:03] no something greater and the flesh of
[43:06] Gina has another passion Jesus
[43:09] administration oh yes hallelujah but
[43:13] there was a greater thing happening
[43:16] there when Jesus declared and I'm
[43:19] jumping in the scripture when Jesus
[43:20] declared I am my father what yes they
[43:23] wanted to stall him when jesus told his
[43:26] disciples when you see me you see the
[43:29] father right right I want to scho him no
[43:32] doc not that knowledge but but not not
[43:35] his disciple but the people he spoke
[43:37] because all they could see was the
[43:39] housing of God right right and Jesus
[43:44] never talked about his flesh right
[43:47] hallelujah and he was talking about the
[43:50] God that was in him and saying this is
[43:54] in st. John Fox 31 34 I'm going to
[43:57] preach this whether we get headache
[43:59] along excited I'm feeling sorry because
[44:02] I can see Jesus ha hey is that what
[44:06] that's what brother Brown said he said
[44:07] he said those are the Greeks and all
[44:10] they came says shy we would see Jesus
[44:12] yeah oh and what did Jesus do he gave
[44:16] them a parable of a sea yes
[44:20] yes basically was saying you see the but
[44:22] you don't see me cuz I am the seed of
[44:25] God that's right and this evil about
[44:28] alone he does not flinch it it was not
[44:32] crushed hasn't died to a chef
[44:35] yes oh yes but I'm telling you you will
[44:39] not Yahiro says yes but Jesus to me he
[44:44] took the whole Bible
[44:46] he preached it in one barrel yeah I see
[44:50] parable yes yes and John is actually
[44:53] what God was going through do from the
[44:56] beginning to the end
[44:57] amen and he told us there was a good
[44:59] sheet ago Sebastian the good she's
[45:03] afraid for God and the fast sheet of
[45:05] rain for the devil he told us was a good
[45:08] sheet what happened to him and when but
[45:10] what would happen to the bad seat
[45:12] see we should all in just that book they
[45:15] and they were confounded because they
[45:17] couldn't understand what Jesus was
[45:19] talking about but anyway let's move on
[45:23] Jesus justified of who he is in st. John
[45:28] 5 beginning of the 31st verse he said I
[45:32] bear witness if he's a if I bear witness
[45:38] of myself my witness is not truth
[45:42] because he making bread on himself
[45:45] all right if you make an testify of
[45:47] himself but that doesn't mean that your
[45:50] testimony is true right right teeth
[45:53] there is another that bears witness of
[45:57] me and I know that that witness which is
[45:59] he witnesses of me is true you sit unto
[46:06] John and he bear witness unto the truth
[46:09] he said John man witness unto the truth
[46:11] yes
[46:13] is that right right John said the guy
[46:16] the man who I see the Spirit of God this
[46:18] is the fun he that's the one yeah
[46:22] greater than ayat
[46:24] and yeah it's on said he's made up and
[46:27] he says I I am not worried could even
[46:30] lose the shows right right say John's
[46:34] been waiting for my sneezes ah Stephen T
[46:38] he said what I'd receive not testimony
[46:40] from me but these things are saying that
[46:44] she was insane he was a burning and a
[46:48] shining light and you were willing for
[46:51] season to rejoice in his eye yes yes Wow
[46:56] yes sir John and powerful industry he
[47:00] was a burning and shining I have you
[47:02] rejoice T yes he said but I have a
[47:08] greater witness than that of John yes
[47:13] hello somebody for the watch which of
[47:16] all has given to me to finish the same
[47:18] work should I do bear witness of me that

[1:08:26] dad but you see I understand and people
[1:08:29] don't like this but they said you know
[1:08:31] that take with it because I listened to
[1:08:33] a tape and I listened to tapes but there
[1:08:36] was a time I had a situation going over
[1:08:38] my life and I needed God coming through
[1:08:43] the chains you know all kinds of
[1:08:45] complexes and everything else it I felt
[1:08:47] like a city without walls and I needed
[1:08:49] God yeah and I was listening to one of
[1:08:51] the taste and brother man was preaching
[1:08:53] was right there their prayer line he
[1:08:55] said sister he said you're going through
[1:08:57] your change of life and you just said to
[1:08:59] yourself Lord am I going to make it I
[1:09:02] just prayed that Lord to my cooker he
[1:09:06] said you'll also make it and I said the
[1:09:09] Lord God is my witness whatever demons I
[1:09:11] had left me
[1:09:15] [Applause]
[1:09:16] the course of man now the loss of top
[1:09:19] right is well have to Jesus see people
[1:09:26] are looking at whatever you look for
[1:09:28] that's what you get
[1:09:29] yes but you gotta understand there's a
[1:09:32] voice in a voice that's why I'm running
[1:09:35] away from them because they produced
[1:09:37] this message as though it was man-made
[1:09:40] yes this was not man-made right okay hey
[1:09:45] I'm so happy that God is in this manner
[1:09:49] that we're fishing off it's a shame that
[1:09:52] was the hider fail oh holy the holy risk
[1:09:57] of this man reason a lot of me a mention
[1:10:07] actually II of this matter in our own in
[1:10:10] that was failed yeah it was cop is where
[1:10:20] you are if you are eating of this manner
[1:10:24] tell me where you are where are you you
[1:10:27] are how the church ages yes sir yes sir
[1:10:31] so you can only feast on the holy of
[1:10:33] holies man hey mad daddy come out of the
[1:10:36] Holies of holding to give you nothing
[1:10:41] you had to be behind your veil to eat it
[1:10:43] exactly right amen and you up behind of
[1:10:46] it yeah he's you are in the presence of
[1:10:48] Allah yeah allow it man make you turn
[1:10:55] from just a - dick yeah to an almond
[1:11:00] tree branch yeah ready forth fruit cut
[1:11:04] off somebody is that the crew yeah oh
[1:11:07] lord help me the reason why I'm saying
[1:11:10] because the Bible says God is a jealous
[1:11:12] God neither is there salvation in any
[1:11:16] other
[1:11:17] yes but there is no other name given a
[1:11:19] among me under heaven given among men
[1:11:22] that we must be saving that's the name
[1:11:23] of Jesus Christ area and even to a lot
[1:11:26] of message to leaders I can preach Jesus
[1:11:29] I could save Jesus
[1:11:31] but as soon as I said brother branham
[1:11:33] said right brother
[1:11:36] ah right nothing what you worship it yes
[1:11:41] sir yes sir
[1:11:42] yeah because the word she spoke is the
[1:11:46] same word she spoke see and when you can
[1:11:51] see if you can jump off of Gina then
[1:11:53] jump up we around with is okay but when
[1:11:56] you just shove it up away around them
[1:11:58] and oh I can't play it down to Demi I'm
[1:12:01] trying it's a fine line folks yeah right
[1:12:06] all right
[1:12:07] it's Jesus Christ words that we are
[1:12:09] repeated we might say for them but his
[1:12:12] cheese is the words of Jesus cry he had
[1:12:14] the work of his own yes right so if he's
[1:12:19] if I'm preaching the Bible to you which
[1:12:22] is the message but I'm used to call them
[1:12:24] use a song why can't we get excited yes
[1:12:28] right yeah you know what because we've
[1:12:33] been programmed right right understand a
[1:12:38] prophet is a Nazarite in other one he
[1:12:41] has no seat of his own and the CD plans
[1:12:44] is Godsey hey go ahead I don't want to
[1:12:48] play too low I'm just trying to give us
[1:12:49] a Cecil you understand I'm not against
[1:12:51] anything but the spirit that's great I
[1:12:56] don't worship Eber I tried but my idols
[1:13:00] yes sir
[1:13:01] God hates idolatry yes sir yes sir hey
[1:13:05] even though Sonny he got me he
[1:13:08] said even the glass sir Amen that God
[1:13:11] put on that pole saved lives and then
[1:13:14] all the sudden they went to worship in
[1:13:16] dry sunny thing hostility Oh death
[1:13:21] because they worship it yo hey what I'm
[1:13:24] trying to say is the Prophet that came
[1:13:26] to bring life if you wash up him you
[1:13:29] making their back Christ
[1:13:34] kills you before God because he never
[1:13:36] taught that yeah yes sir
[1:13:39] absolutely right yes sir just like Moses
[1:13:42] never taught them to worship Him
[1:13:43] right right but they did right mother
[1:13:47] and they were such in such a worship a
[1:13:49] man they was in such a worship they
[1:13:51] tried to quote Moses if the bird right
[1:13:57] God in the flesh by the things Moses
[1:14:01] said yes sir
[1:14:05] yes sir and we do the same thing if the
[1:14:09] Holy Spirit comes in here and it really
[1:14:11] moved through this audience and shuts
[1:14:14] away if you know it's the Holy Spirit
[1:14:18] yes sir and you know what people say
[1:14:19] what she did one hour oughta make us
[1:14:21] brother Brendan said her head dry your
[1:14:25] head right now I'm telling you I know
[1:14:29] what I'm seeing that I will God give you
[1:14:31] grace your sanity shorthands yes cuz it
[1:14:34] is the spirit that quickeneth that makes
[1:14:37] us enough yes yes believe in the holy
[1:14:40] spirit out of this message right brother
[1:14:45] listen people
[1:14:46] we shall we go won't come we don't want
[1:14:48] this with all that and how much more we

[1:14:59] the file identification of a true church
[1:15:02] then where that's going to put up do you

[1:15:08] own inspiration that was the Holy Spirit

[1:25:07] quicken yours are your customers right
[1:25:11] sometime you read that's crooked all of
[1:25:12] a sudden it's Cleveland you you look at
[1:25:17] that word you get all food and tirion
[1:25:19] Lord you talking to me Laury Laury
[1:25:25] it is okay yes sir yes see it was I'm
[1:25:28] saying this is called in Mount Carmel
[1:25:30] the devil is so crafty that he had those
[1:25:34] Jews believe that Baylor was God right
[1:25:39] huh and the truth of the matter is the
[1:25:43] word male moves on right so they call
[1:25:47] them a different law and the do you
[1:25:50] think then you know those Jews what
[1:25:51] we're taught there's only one God
[1:25:53] but you're watching in bail worship is a
[1:25:57] filthy worship yes we got all kinds of
[1:25:59] Filth in worshiping thing yes sir
[1:26:01] and because of a mixed
[1:26:03] others I won't say what they are but if
[1:26:05] you study all of you coming out it was
[1:26:07] wicked
[1:26:07] yes why do you think the Bible tells us
[1:26:10] that is bow on air and the kick is a
[1:26:13] cage of every unclean and hateful bear
[1:26:15] because they're worshipping veil right
[1:26:19] right and if you don't worship God in
[1:26:21] spirit and truth you're worshipping fire
[1:26:24] but there's only two to Russia and God
[1:26:29] even people there is a denominational
[1:26:33] churches they are worshipping the devil
[1:26:35] they don't even know it yes sir because
[1:26:37] in this hour the only way to worship God
[1:26:40] is in spirit and in truth is whatever
[1:26:43] was with them out of that election
[1:26:51] election but probably have a Jellicoe
[1:26:56] election yeah you don't say even action
[1:27:01] pulls you away something on the inside
[1:27:03] because of who you are cows doing
[1:27:05] something wrong even though you can't
[1:27:07] see it written right hey or what you
[1:27:13] like shouting John right now I know I
[1:27:15] got a peach listen Jesus says and let
[1:27:21] the drive I thought it I can of mine own
[1:27:23] self do nothing so I want you on the
[1:27:26] dead I just can say that Jesus a myself
[1:27:31] I can do nothing as I hear I judge and
[1:27:34] my judgment is just because I seek not
[1:27:37] my oil but as the Father which hath sent
[1:27:41] me yes hallelujah is that right
[1:27:46] brother Bell had me taught that way
[1:27:49] right that he could not do his own wheel

[1:38:33] either you say you see so what I'm
[1:38:36] saying brother battle for purpose
[1:38:37] because I don't want you to think I'm
[1:38:39] saying it saying brother branham is
[1:38:40] wrong but if you don't know what you
[1:38:43] what what you're repeating of what who's
[1:38:46] whose inspiration it is you think it's a
[1:38:50] man's exploration know it's caught am I
[1:38:55] making myself clear
[1:38:56] but I want you to know that when I when
[1:38:59] I go down on my knees I dress geez
[1:39:02] yes I ain't knowledge the Lord in all my
[1:39:06] weight when I close my prayer is in the
[1:39:10] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:11] whenever I go to do something when I wit
[1:39:14] it that's what I try to tell somebody I
[1:39:16] said there's something to people in this
[1:39:17] person who's never gone the cabin
[1:39:19] everybody cuz nobody preaches it whether
[1:39:25] that's your heard of Calvary message
[1:39:26] Easter are you gonna go down how are you
[1:39:32] gonna tell you people what all they are
[1:39:33] and they don't even know why what was
[1:39:36] Jesus how come he was naked like I tell
[1:39:39] her somebody don't you know uh-uh uh-uh
[1:39:41] he was the first to hang over the street
[1:39:43] and cursing with me because she hung on
[1:39:46] their tree and then because he became
[1:39:48] she was stripped to became naked and she
[1:39:51] honed a trim and now Jesus had to hang
[1:39:53] on the tree and had to be stripped naked
[1:39:56] because of me Jesus had to be real about
[1:39:59] that virgin because he even lost her
[1:40:02] virginity the understanding he had to
[1:40:04] undo everything he did to bring forth
[1:40:07] the raw you'll see see and that's what
[1:40:12] people don't understand he did far more
[1:40:14] than what people understand all he took
[1:40:16] away the curse of the serpent and all of
[1:40:21] us are familiar with the curse of the
[1:40:22] serpent every time you get a pain the
[1:40:25] curse of the serpent and something cause
[1:40:28] that to be in your body see every time
[1:40:31] somebody got that's what that's all
[1:40:33] about and then we see the guy comes
[1:40:36] along it making Jesus Christ and we need
[1:40:40] to follow in him that's all I'm saying
[1:40:43] you need to fall in love with Jesus
[1:40:45] Christ I'll tell us about that I'm
[1:40:48] trying to go lumpy the reason is
[1:40:50] adjustable you know it is true it's like
[1:40:53] what people think well I had a brother
[1:40:54] tell me this years ago and he's a
[1:40:56] brother you better be careful what you
[1:40:58] say you better be careful but I can't
[1:41:00] tell you I can only take what God showed
[1:41:01] me and you don't have to believe but
[1:41:03] I'll tell you what I think he searches
[1:41:06] the time brother Brown said there was a
[1:41:08] white rock it was no writing or doing
[1:41:09] anything and he told those could you see
[1:41:11] said you stink and standards
[1:41:13] look on this rock could I come back they
[1:41:16] didn't stay they walked away and every
[1:41:20] one of those creatures that call on him
[1:41:21] and then came back with their own
[1:41:23] revelation of the message huh huh yes he
[1:41:27] did it wasn't it wasn't the body will
[1:41:30] shake of people called people creatures
[1:41:31] but either off the air is it the
[1:41:33] preachers call the people too and all
[1:41:36] they had to do because everyone had the
[1:41:38] revelation of the thunders the
[1:41:39] revelation of his breath the revelation
[1:41:41] was missing that the other and then they
[1:41:42] fed all that stuff to us yeah and
[1:41:46] whistling Lord will be all the miracles
[1:41:47] where all the signs where is where is
[1:41:49] God and God can only honor the original
[1:41:51] seat you got to go back to what he said
[1:41:56] and not somebody else's interpretation
[1:42:00] or something else I want to say but it's
[1:42:04] so amazing how God you know God he
[1:42:07] says I gotta go rebel said a true loud
[1:42:10] fast declaration experience with Jesus
[1:42:13] will cause you to only glorify Jesus
[1:42:16] Christ
[1:42:17] a man he said there was Moses I got the
[1:42:21] coded policies he said in bills Moses
[1:42:23] there was Elijah and there was Jesus and
[1:42:26] he said a day of the prophets were over
[1:42:28] and he was to glorify Jesus and told me
[1:42:33] you get together but somebody said well
[1:42:36] brother Branham say thirty a day well
[1:42:39] let me show with you scripture says when
[1:42:41] John Jesus were getting ready to raise
[1:42:43] up Lazarus from the dead jesus said
[1:42:47] Lazarus is sleeping sorry like brother
[1:42:51] where are you sleeping but the Bible
[1:42:53] says so they can understand he said
[1:42:56] Lazarus is dead we know that for the
[1:43:00] grandest evening but we also know he did
[1:43:05] go to his grave site you hear him say
[1:43:08] he's as dead as not as was but he's
[1:43:11] alive because he is dead that's what I'm
[1:43:14] trying to say and here's what he ain't
[1:43:16] dead oops my point is this he is a lot
[1:43:22] but he's trying to sell
[1:43:23] someone somebody say I'm dead he'll
[1:43:25] nobody's saying I'm finished
[1:43:27] he's not finished you're the fish I love
[1:43:32] fish when I go to the grave
[1:43:34] they bury my dead body
[1:43:37] that's the only thing today hallelujah
[1:43:41] and then but yes I'm alive the real me
[1:43:45] King that's what he's saying
[1:43:49] but people said well you know he's I
[1:43:51] don't know why they do what they do but
[1:43:53] it's because they don't read the euro
[1:43:55] they don't take no about it then
[1:43:58] I'm closing on this if you got any
[1:44:00] questions you can ask me I'm not
[1:44:02] offended in questions my point is I'm
[1:44:05] just trying to get us to see and to

[1:46:02] in his method and they fail to see
[1:46:04] that's not the way it was supposed to be
[1:46:06] William Brennan was the most humbling
[1:46:08] man I ever seen I've never met him
[1:46:11] personally but when I hear his testimony
[1:46:12] when I see his takes on when I see his
[1:46:15] life he was oh and if we're feeding off
[1:46:21] the same thing he's feeling awful was
[1:46:23] feeding off it ought to make us humble
[1:46:25] right customer if I had a bottle of wine

[1:47:46] squeeze come you think you're going to
[1:47:47] read your Bible brother Brennan said
[1:47:49] event that these doors the doors are

[1:47:53] you're not gonna be able to read your
[1:47:55] Bible where is it going to be I'm
[1:47:58] coaching this man said to me they have
[1:48:00] 40 prophesy over me and he said oh I had
[1:48:04] my Bible cook you know something up when

[1:48:22] they see that book so all you guys do if
[1:48:25] you don't you want to walk down
[1:48:26] somewhere
[1:48:27] it means dangerous take your Bible and
[1:48:29] put it there
[1:48:32] Devils are scared of your Bible tells me
[1:48:35] you're a young you don't know you can
[1:48:37] sit at a box set up an arrow with my
[1:48:40] behind and I'm isolated I'm segregated
[1:48:44] everybody should ever wear without me
[1:48:50] you don't want to be bothered take your
[1:48:52] Bible he said to me all you that kind of
[1:48:57] funny
[1:48:58] Christian you gotta take your body with
[1:48:59] you all that said listen my father was
[1:49:01] in my heart
[1:49:02] look that's right the bus that he wrote
[1:49:05] it you my heart I may not even know is
[1:49:07] written but when it's wrong is it gonna
[1:49:11] check yes hey somebody see is it not you
[1:49:16] too kind of person I want to talk to but
[1:49:18] anyway let's go I'm closing on this host
[1:49:21] I'm saying it's the promises of ello you
[1:49:28] Jesus made us promises but that was LEM
[1:49:32] making a promise the venting system and
[1:49:36] Jesus and God is the one that's why I
[1:49:37] said I come in my father's name
[1:49:40] um you know I wanted you to see them so
[1:49:43] this is what look like right so when you
[1:49:49] see me you see the father when you talk
[1:49:50] to me you talk to the father that's who
[1:49:52] I am
[1:49:53] we me and the father I wanna see I
[1:49:56] couldn't I couldn't Hawk
[1:49:58] but I doubt the Scala Church they said I
[1:49:59] said Jesus praying to a good God they
[1:50:02] said he was praying to himself y'all
[1:50:08] believe that he was playing to the
[1:50:11] Father the Spirit the unseen force right
[1:50:17] oh my god France - the same one Abraham
[1:50:22] prayed to you understand so he was
[1:50:25] praying to the the self-existing one the
[1:50:29] one who spoke the logos right
[1:50:36] see that's why this thing must be about
[1:50:39] faith because you can't don't even try
[1:50:43] to break it down and reason it out it is
[1:50:46] what it is
[1:50:47] I the father one and then right and one
[1:50:51] day we must come to that where we say I
[1:50:53] am the father of one man with God comes
[1:50:58] into this ministry listen in the way
[1:51:00] back he says he was standing here
[1:51:02] wearing my suit that it gives me he
[1:51:05] could do no more that's all he could do
[1:51:08] was vindicate that he's Christ prove
[1:51:11] that he here you have to believe him I
[1:51:14] can if you believe see that it right now
[1:51:17] if you believe it that's all there is to
[1:51:20] it it looks to me like it ought to eat
[1:51:23] Electrify see what I'm trying to say the
[1:51:25] reason why I know people don't have a
[1:51:27] revelation of who they serving because a
[1:51:30] preacher can get up and he's preaching
[1:51:32] the very words of Elohim and they don't
[1:51:35] get excited
[1:51:37] but if brother Branham was here the
[1:51:41] understand then get excited and brother
[1:51:45] Adam a piece the same things that
[1:51:46] preacher is preaching see that money
[1:51:49] goes on he comes up the unveiling
[1:51:52] God somehow we allow Satan to bring us
[1:51:55] into a charge setting and we see brother
[1:51:58] Bruce you are missing it you're losing
[1:52:03] what God is doing
[1:52:04] I'm just a veil for him is his word that
[1:52:08] I'm preaching and repeating to you to
[1:52:11] gain faith in your soul and if you can
[1:52:15] come and you can hear God in his heart
[1:52:17] that that's Scott preaching you can go
[1:52:20] out here with something great I've got a
[1:52:24] preacher and um you know he's really
[1:52:28] slow in my closing he when I say skull I
[1:52:31] mean he on you say a few words and what
[1:52:35] you call it wind up your computer stops
[1:52:38] a knitting through that circle would be
[1:52:40] called after buffering or something is
[1:52:44] you can put the low stuff on it right
[1:52:47] but anyway you know he'll stop and then
[1:52:50] he'll let the Holy Ghost
[1:52:52] then he comes again
[1:52:55] right and it's awesome
[1:52:58] but so these preachers wouldn't that bad
[1:53:02] because they're used to a certain flavor
[1:53:04] a certain taste of something gone
[1:53:08] brother as they did he said the
[1:53:10] denominations people didn't like me
[1:53:12] is it because I had I had no style of
[1:53:14] preaching and I've noticed that somehow
[1:53:19] ministers have develop a style in his
[1:53:21] message mm-hmm that's why you never know
[1:53:24] how no breach I don't have a style I
[1:53:27] don't even try it
[1:53:29] I don't set my note so - I've got the
[1:53:33] look on every one of them and make sure
[1:53:34] I'm getting it I got on my nose climax
[1:53:40] we laugh when they do it and they make
[1:53:45] sure they get to that point and they
[1:53:47] know gets going to be explosion because
[1:53:50] they've already worked with you
[1:53:51] psychologically coach oh my god don't
[1:53:55] want your mind he wants your heart a man
[1:53:57] and that's what I try to work with I try
[1:53:59] to work with the hearts of the people I
[1:54:02] want you to understand God in your heart
[1:54:05] understand you worship God here
[1:54:08] hallelujah and if you can get him on the
[1:54:11] throne of your heart he'll rule
[1:54:12] everything understand we're worshiping
[1:54:16] the Living God
[1:54:18] god I'll tell him who feels all in your
[1:54:21] wallet above all he is all and I'm
[1:54:24] telling you he never leaving over second
[1:54:26] he told me that a month ago so I was
[1:54:28] kind of feeling down enough you know
[1:54:30] he'll only believe you can hear the
[1:54:32] voice of God then why do you pray all I
[1:54:36] know it was back in here and he said to
[1:54:38] me I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:54:41] that's all you need to say that's right
[1:54:43] and I just with the week to thank you
[1:54:45] lord
[1:54:46] praise the Lord okay I feel good just do
[1:54:49] that God is real folks
[1:54:54] he's real I'm not trying to tear down
[1:54:56] anything but you know what the loss yes
[1:55:00] coming see because you don't realize
[1:55:03] when when Elijah came back alone oh no
[1:55:05] he had to restore thing yes yes there's
[1:55:11] a time of a crowd is that right yes this
[1:55:14] is Rob remember the little middle of
[1:55:16] some trauma in Israel let me ask you a
[1:55:19] question is where did he lie to get all
[1:55:22] that where didn't I get all that water
[1:55:27] to feel those barrels three times amen
[1:55:30] on top of the mountain y'all um say see
[1:55:36] what people don't understand is that
[1:55:37] this message supplies his own water amen
[1:55:41] so watch it roll it runs out is that
[1:55:44] right listen he's a feel of what you
[1:55:47] fill up twice he did but the start time
[1:55:50] he filled up is red all over
[1:55:53] that's what this ain't genius it's
[1:55:56] supposed to be the third ball it is
[1:55:58] supposed to be where God will overthrow
[1:56:00] the vessels and let's sacrifice for such
[1:56:02] a common thing that the fire will fall
[1:56:05] and will be wrapped
[1:56:07] that way because the very sacrifice was
[1:56:10] linked up everything was lived up don't
[1:56:11] know yeah try boom
[1:56:15] he did it in Paul's day he did it in
[1:56:18] real around all day and now on the bride
[1:56:21] and the Son of Man is to come watch you
[1:56:26] love the Lord and I hope you did bless
[1:56:29] just trying to focus I want to encourage
[1:56:34] you but if you can see what I'm saying
[1:56:37] go back and start listening to those
[1:56:39] tapes for a different mindset not I'm
[1:56:43] going to hear your voice
[1:56:44] talk these tapes you see not not just
[1:56:48] the voice of a man over here use me to
[1:56:51] move right I'm going to preacher comes
[1:56:56] you need to say Lord I don't care if
[1:56:58] he's cross-eyed but I want you to speak
[1:57:03] but don't know that you're too bright if
[1:57:06] I had real good looks coming in here I'm
[1:57:08] preaching everybody with you in stand
[1:57:15] it's true our Delta the better-looking
[1:57:18] people get the best jobs in this world
[1:57:21] and somehow it is that long but I said
[1:57:25] that's what happened to the church you
[1:57:26] start getting all the Ricky right okay
[1:57:28] right
[1:57:28] amen right it wasn't good looking folks
[1:57:32] and they don't understand
[1:57:33] that's not we got hot all right
[1:57:37] gone house and simplicity he has a thing
[1:57:40] that you would think he would be you
[1:57:44] know you look at this new church
[1:57:45] compared to these big churches around
[1:57:47] here and they don't know God is over
[1:57:50] here I got the same color Church am i
[1:57:55] saying god it's amazing that both of us
[1:57:57] have churches in the back of the
[1:57:59] building
[1:57:59] I see that's gonna see you
[1:58:03] I hear you so you know we look at this
[1:58:06] thing overnight I want you to be focused
[1:58:09] now about is it that he will appear to
[1:58:12] those who love a man yeah at you Odia
[1:58:19] understand we talked about the foul and
[1:58:23] there were seven dangers that made that
[1:58:27] friendly the picture frame of the face
[1:58:30] of Christ that right yes sir several
[1:58:32] changes made the face of Jesus Christ so
[1:58:37] we know that brother Brandon was not
[1:58:39] Jesus because he was one of the angel
[1:58:41] who formed the face y'all know what I'm
[1:58:44] sayin
[1:58:45] it's like a puzzle when you make it a
[1:58:49] puzzle you put all the pieces together
[1:58:51] you what you do you know what to do you
[1:58:54] do all the edges first and you feel in
[1:58:58] the pieces just made that that portion
[1:59:03] and who's the fill-in and if you look at
[1:59:09] that picture you'll see all kinds of
[1:59:11] faces you know what the Lord told me and
[1:59:17] I'll be out of here I said at the
[1:59:19] judgment he said if you don't believe
[1:59:20] the picture you're not in the picture
[1:59:28] how would you think about what I said
[1:59:30] because brother all those angels were in
[1:59:33] the picture and brother Branham said
[1:59:35] each angel each messenger would bring
[1:59:38] his people with amen
[1:59:42] just think about never take only let God
[1:59:45] show you what I'm saying there is no
[1:59:46] doctrine about it you're not going to be
[1:59:48] lost if you don't see it but if you can
[1:59:51] see yourself because he said well know
[1:59:53] him it will see him face because let him
[1:59:58] talk about the mirror is that little boy
[2:00:00] looking at him any signs his face and
[2:00:04] stuff he says
[2:00:08] no that's all I'm sayin
[2:00:12] it's more to this message than you know
[2:00:15] that's a it's a supernatural God doing a
[2:00:21] supernatural thing with the supernatural
[2:00:23] people we're not supposed to be natural
[2:00:26] that won't be natural a Maddie amen
[2:00:29] I won't be supernatural all right I want
[2:00:34] to fake it myself as being supernatural
[2:00:35] yes sir
[2:00:38] when times get hard I will I want to be
[2:00:42] able to do supernatural now how I'm
[2:00:44] going to do supernatural when things get
[2:00:46] hard
[2:00:46] I do too like everybody say does it geez
[2:00:49] up I call it a lunatic now he is my
[2:00:53] refuge he is my help he is my strength
[2:00:55] right on him he comes and it fixes the
[2:00:59] problem yes yes that's what makes me
[2:01:03] supernatural I know the supernatural God
[2:01:05] that's you love the Lord yes sir
[2:01:08] I just want me to say anything that
[2:01:09] tough because I share things sometimes
[2:01:12] maybe I shouldn't maybe I should have
[2:01:14] shared that about the picture but I only
[2:01:17] say that because when I was a boy and
[2:01:19] that man came to me I was only maybe it
[2:01:22] was in six-three six-four six-five
[2:01:24] during that time and there's a white man
[2:01:26] came in Monday with y'all and heard me
[2:01:28] testified and like I said in that time
[2:01:30] only the milkman and insurance there's a
[2:01:32] lot in my neighborhood all right if he
[2:01:35] was white filling the lake right but the
[2:01:38] point in he came and he had that Life
[2:01:41] magazine with him I'm justifying it all
[2:01:44] over now because I know what what God
[2:01:45] was shared with me and and it was three
[2:01:48] or four of us there playing football and
[2:01:50] he said come upon coming boys I want to
[2:01:51] show you something and he opened that
[2:01:53] magazine he said the daughter soon to
[2:01:54] come he said can you see his picture his
[2:01:56] face in the clouds
[2:01:57] nobody could see his face in the cloud
[2:01:59] but you know that's all I can see it
[2:02:02] that's hard he closed the book and he
[2:02:05] walked off and I never seen the man
[2:02:07] again nor had I ever seen that magazine
[2:02:09] again until I came to the Sun I see so
[2:02:12] nobody can't tell me about that that it
[2:02:16] ain't right all right God showed me when
[2:02:18] I was a ball I'm sorry I didn't
[2:02:20] understand
[2:02:21] I do now hey man how are you yeah so I'm
[2:02:24] going to tell you something people say
[2:02:25] that was some kind of science you tell
[2:02:29] what that's a lot because they can do
[2:02:31] that now they can make some smoked
[2:02:34] chicken they could never fall in the
[2:02:37] face of God no oh people people are wake
[2:02:41] up and smell the coffee work yes fine
[2:02:44] yes sir you know I thank God for my
[2:02:46] prophet I thank God for God showing and
[2:02:49] running him you know but I know I've got
[2:02:52] so many cultural programs they don't
[2:02:53] worship me you know I don't need your
[2:02:56] glory you know he said and he said I
[2:02:58] can't go Asia I wouldn't go out with
[2:03:00] Taurus Eva I said glory he said come he
[2:03:03] won't let a remember Moses glorified
[2:03:06] himself and he was our God stop the
[2:03:09] reproach of the promise Lee that's right
[2:03:11] let me play some all these preachers
[2:03:13] that's glorifying himself they don't
[2:03:14] tell me they're not doing it because
[2:03:16] they didn't impose me I am a seeker than
[2:03:18] Iowa call us I look like this and you
[2:03:21] don't know you got people in the message
[2:03:22] they won't hear a certain preachers
[2:03:24] because they are up there that's wrong
[2:03:28] that is so wrong he's near to being
[2:03:31] glorified for something they didn't even
[2:03:33] do right brother man you find out he
[2:03:39] said oh he's are you preacher who's
[2:03:41] actually getting rich off of this
[2:03:42] message and he carries all about he said
[2:03:44] I'm for that
[2:03:46] did he interested in the souls of the
[2:03:48] people just like old people out there no
[2:03:50] denomination all he interested is money

[2:04:06] you got one chance at this thing this is
[2:04:08] not chance

[2:04:13] is now the chair watching you got one
[2:04:15] chance this might be your last chance
[2:04:16] there's no chance the left will always
[2:04:20] obey right amen they don't come to God
[2:04:23] right it might be sooner it might be
[2:04:26] later but they don't come to God
[2:04:27] hallelujah don't know the elected
[2:04:31] even besting the Holy Ghost that's right
[2:04:33] they can't do it God is already

[2:05:41] know Lord the true pride of Jesus Christ
[2:05:43] would be the discernment Lord that the
[2:05:46] two spheres that works in the frameworks
[2:05:47] of the church showing us and seeing how
[2:05:50] that little need of the Nicolaitans he
[2:05:52] made us now in some places become
[2:05:55] doctrine has also become mean and now we

[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:08:02] when the Lord showed me the face he said
[2:08:09] to me we are becoming him then he took
[2:08:14] me to the gospel he took me down to when
[2:08:18] Adam or II was a nap when I went down to
[2:08:23] the stream and look in the stream whose
[2:08:27] face did he see it's all
[2:08:30] and he was it she had a face his face
[2:08:36] was perfect right
[2:08:38] and so when he showed me that and showed
[2:08:42] me that by God's grace this is where God
[2:08:44] is bringing us into the place that we
[2:08:47] see him thanks today I can't explain it
[2:08:52] it has to be a revelation so you see the
[2:08:55] face which is the body he was the face
[2:08:59] he's the egg right so will we see we see
[2:09:03] him I can't explain it
[2:09:05] I'm trying to in his Scripture yes if we
[2:09:08] are becoming him that need with
[2:09:11] possessing his name we possessing his
[2:09:13] character we possession is nature
[2:09:16] everything with possessing his face
[2:09:20] because Adam was in even now for the
[2:09:23] membership quit now in him in Christ
[2:09:26] Jesus right
[2:09:29] he's the body he threw the body
[2:09:32] he's the head a mistake about what I'm
[2:09:34] trying to say
[2:09:35] that's not my children it's a powerful
[2:09:37] revelation it gives you your identity
[2:09:41] come from if given you identity it a
[2:09:44] really big you see who you really are
[2:09:47] all it is that you are just Jesus all
