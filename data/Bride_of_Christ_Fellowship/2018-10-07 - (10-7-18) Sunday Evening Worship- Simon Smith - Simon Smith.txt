scriptures by the grace of God go to John 10 or we gonna scripture then we'll say a word of Prayer John 10 verse 30 John 10 verse 30 says I and my father are one then the Jews took up stones again to stone him and jesus answered them many good works have I shooed thee from my father for which of these works do you stone me and the Jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy because thou sayest because that thou being a man makest thyself God so say we're a prayer you're the father Lord Jesus Lord we just love you Lord we just have a such a simple thought Lord this tonight or God this evening Lord nor me just break it open to God Lord me you just speak to your children God once again Lord we love you so much Lord bless all the hearers of the word Lord everyone to push their way back out God Lord and Lord be with each one Lord we love you so much we want to lift you up and glorify your holy name that name of Jesus Christ we ask these things in the name Jesus Christ amen my receipts if I had a title would probably be talk it well speak on the veil tonight on the veil in the beginning was God actually let me read that by the grace of God [Music] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning was God in the beginning sorry God created the heavens and the earth at this time Saints he was Elohim he was a deity everything was within him but he had no hiding place he was an invisible God he all by himself he had a plan all these things everything was within him but he was completely invisible and then God started to speak creation and one by one he created natural things he created spiritual things and he wanted to he want this main objective was to reveal himself we know as the Prophet taught he said he said once we cross over this side we get into the rapture we received that body change he's once these thing plate place we go into the wedding suppers with God and we then we go then we come on down in revelations 19 into the Millennium reign we rule and reign with him for a thousand years all day we want to fold our new bodies and our new flesh he says he says then we cross over into the world look into that last war there God sets the scene then just wipes them out he sets up the Great Wide judgment throne and one by every soul is then being judged and then he said he's after those things we enter we go right back into eternity we're going into a time where there is no time everything everything that hit that that masters story is now over that master plan is now over and and and and he wanted to in his whole desire was to have this plan right and then but as we go into eternity he's going to unbolt unfold himself and unveil himself continually throughout eternity there are things we can't even imagine to even ask him yet there's thoughts in our mind that I haven't even crossed our minds yet on what to ask him when we get on to the other side our spirit realm we're going to be able to see and feel and smell and understand things we've never known it's gonna open up a million more questions is it but then even when you're past the Millennium in the in the wedding supper and we we come back to this earth and it's set up just perfectly and we walk on the ashes of the wicked we are going to then have questions about our new bodies our flesh bodies our glorified bodies and what can this thing new everyone if we can just transport and speak and and we get to the Clift of an angel or something like on the mountain whatever and if we just slip who would not fall we just speak the word and what we'd be just fine and just go on as all get-out if there be a wild animal we'll just calm that little animal and just speak to him and we'll be able to pet him and love on him and all these things and it can open up questions these bodies but then as we go on beyond God and we see that he's under there's no limit to him we're gonna we're going to have more questions of that it will go on into that era that that that space where we are going to just God is just going to speak and one by one he's gonna answer every question that we don't have questions for yet he's going to have all the answers absolutely now in Exodus 26 and verse 30 the reason i teaching on the Veil the veil is what brings all the questions the veil has brought all the canoe ujin's but then as god's chosen way to reveal himself is through the veil now in exodus 20:3 verse 30 he's now shall reel tatin trier up the tabernacle according to the fashion area which was judy in the mount and thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twined linen of cunning works with cherubs shall it be made this is going what into the holiest of holies there was that veil and he says he's when you when you make these and use your sewing machine with your hands and all these things needs to make sure there's cherubims even made inside he's white showing the one there's two angels guarding on this veil right he says he said thou shalt hang it on the four pillars of chinam wood overlaid with gold their hooks shall be of gold upon the four sockets of silver right and thou shall hang up the veil under the the catches which thou mayst bring in thither and within the veil the Ark of the testimony and the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and almost wholly Amen right so God even the natural worship the oldest form of worship to his people that it was there was a veil there absolutely failed what the presence of God sure and he had cherubim over it and then in Hebrews 9 in verse 5 he says and over over it with the chairman's of glory shadowing the mercy which cannot now we which we cannot now speak protection particularly absolutely so there's there's cherubims over the mercy seat but before we got into there there was that veil there's cherubims there as well right now and we know these everything's foreshadowing Messiah everything was moved at this time was foreshadowing Jesus Christ and and and he was such a mystery mysterious man our Lord Savior was right now in and in Daniel 9 verse 25 Daniel 9 verse 25 who is he supposed to be when this Messiah came who is he supposed to be who is this in Daniel 9:25 know therefore understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build the Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince okay shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again the wall even in troublous times and then in verse 26 and after threescore two weeks shall Messiah be cut off so here is the one instance where the Scriptures profile prophesying of Messiah right and if you actually take that word Messiah and go back to the Hebrew and it is actually means The Anointed One it means the consecrated one right specifically he says the Messiah the king priest the saint specifically the Messiah The Anointed One he was consecrated for his right so everything's he shows that this is going to be someone anointed right and now in Isaiah 9:6 we know these things for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace absolutely so this this right here is showing you this anointed person was going to be he was going to be all of it he's going to be wonderful and I know I was wonderful absolutely he fills me full of wonder he is as a counselor as well and I know it was like counseling he's taught me many many things I launched the time the hard way sometimes I got to go the hard way the the not the trips I picked the wrong path I pick I'm little too hasty of my judgments and I say well maybe this way or that's when there you go maybe this way and it's the wrong way and I have that God has to spank me and bring me up bring me all the way to the right way amen he says he's the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace eases of the increase of his government peace shall be no end unto the throne of David unto his kingdom to order to establish it with judgment with justice from henceforth even forever more he says the zeal the Lord of hosts will perform it right so God said he says everything that goes forth out of my mouth he says I will perform it and did he not perform it saints of God were 2000 years past of when what the Messiah came absolutely the very first time sure now in Matthew 2 verse one he says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem saying where is he that was born the King of the Jews which we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship when Herod the King had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and that when they were gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded him where Christ he said should be born cousin Daniel has said that he said he said there strumming someone he says and it's going to be what the Messiah and I was under anointed one but now when he come the new to the New Testament he they don't call him Messiah they call now the Christ absolutely and with that word Christ means Christos and it also means an anointed one absolutely so when you when when people are talking about the Messiah it would be what the Christ absolutely Jesus that's why God made him both Lord and Christ he was the Messiah he identified him back to the Anointed One that was prophesied back there absolutely sure in the beginning he came and he would he spoke forth and we know he was veiled right sure in John 5 five verse seventeen sorry pieces but jesus answered them my father work worketh hitherto and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he had not only broken the Sabbath but said also that the God was his father making himself equal with God right and we know they were going to stone him for these things he says his I and my father are one they're gonna stone him for these things but we know we understand by the Word of God by the message that all the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt within that flesh right now in Matthew 26 verse 62 and the high priest arose and said unto Him answers now nothing he says what is it now what is it which these witnesses these witness against thee but Jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said to him I adjure thee by the Living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ the Anointed One the Messiah the Son of God he says are you that and Jesus what did Jesus say in verse 64 he says thou hast said right in other words he says he says the Christos he says now said it nevertheless I say and you here after you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven and verse 65 then the high priest rent is closed saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of any witness behold now we have heard of his blasphemy now look at Matthew two six-six-six they said what have ye he says what think he and the answer that he is guilty of death absolutely the mark of the beast right there now he's guilty of death now in another section of scripture in Matt and mark verse chapter 14 verse 60 and the highest priest stood up in the mists and and asked Jesus saying answer thou nothing he says what is it now that he's witness against thee but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him art thou the Christ art out that Messiah the son of the Blessed and Jesus said what he said I am he was identifying himself in all three Exodus 'as God had to come down and it was the invisible God came down what and availed himself in fire what in a burning bush he bailed himself right there but it was an invisible God he bailed himself right there and then what he veiled himself what in a prophet like Moses you know in a man of God like David he bailed himself in these men how could these moral men do anything how could they live out the Christ unless Christ was veiled in them absolutely amen and but he did it the Old Testament he did it what in this right here in his own son he bailed himself in his own son absolutely absolutely one who spoke out of that when he said that I wonder now in John 7 verse 14 John 7 verse 14 now about the midst of the feast Jesus one of the temple untaught and the Jews Maher was saying how knowest this man letters having never learned there was what a man of a man came up and he's in his disputing with the scribes he distributing with the Pharisees and Sadducees and he's in his bringing forth things he's speaking things but as he's speaking he's defeating them in the very ideas the very doctors he's actually setting them astray too narrow all these things how can he do these he was the Word of God right this Bible we have here was may actually made flesh this he turned these words and he made it flesh so because oh thank you so much a Man Thing thank you sister that's exactly oh I don't know what happened here but he was made flesh the very word of God was made flesh that's why he could live it out just perfectly right saints of God that's why you find yourself in your walks because you came off of God in the beginning you came all the way back there well you were the word as well that's why you find yourselves in this situation sitting under this word I met this sister right here in an airport quite a hurricane had come in we started talking these things in that met back at we got lost today there we had just sleep in hotels or whatever and then we flew to Toledo and then I witnessed to her again what caused this we had to live out our lives because Christ is within us everything you've been through has been ordained for you absolutely no one else could have lived your life brilliant man uh-uh what's in my my own battles in my own mind I said man I'd like to be like this person this person but I I have to let those battles down you can only be who you are absolutely no he could have went through what you went through now the one person can go through what you've been through and have the exact same outcome if brother Jesse tried to live my life he might have struggled hear this listening and it might what the hell because only I was Oh danger lived my life I could never let brother Jesse's life I could never live Lydia's life never could never but each one of us has of a specific time because what we were off of God we shot us through into this time we came forth in this generation to want to be a witness in a light saints of God in Wesley's age in Wesley's in Luther's age and Pentecost those areas look crazy but saints of God we were built for this age this this prophet of God looks to the outside world looks more crazy than anything else there's more confusion here about this this movement right here then maybe 100 years ago a zoo the street there's more confusion right here about this move it more more fear about it than even in Wesley or Luther's age absolutely why because this time God has come down he has come down and revealed the word you I'll be honest when I witness now and I find out these people are Christians and the one man he tells me he says I've got a lot of questions I said I've got all the answers by the grace of God but once they find out and they see the confidence they see the boldness in your eyes is I by the grace of God I'll take this very Bible and answer your questions they don't want nothing to do with it he told me two months ago how come here your church where is he yet but they don't understand I really think saints of God sometimes I think that sometimes you run into people and I feel like they can actually see that God is with you and it kind of spooks him a little bit give us a little they stand off a little bit like this guy knows what he's talking about and he's not scared if you give them that real sincere look and you try to pull God now while you're speaking to them and express to them that God can answer these things that we know what we're talking about absolutely by the grace of God everything's by the grace of God we can't go or nothin he gave it to us we might as well expand to it others absolutely we gotta share these things but I believe sometimes I just feel like they see God and it scares them because what is it it's light and once the light has brought forth a path and into their path and the explosion exposes the darkness and the Bible says the darkness don't understand it the true light I'm not talking about a Pentecostal light a denominational light I'm not talking about a false light I'm talking about the true light of God it will confound the darkness absolutely they will not understand it and they will flee oh so you're a Christian well what do you think about this baptism this this and they flee you're now in John 7 verse 28 then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and you know from whence I am he says and I am NOT coming myself but he that sent me is true whom you know not he says but I know him for I am from him and he has sent me saints of God there might come a time there might come time Mary shortly where will have to answer just like this when you are fully what what happens when this book when this book of Acts starts again and God is now look at st. Paul look at st. Pete look at st. Peter on the day of Pentecost when he started speaking that was God in flesh speaking through it was it was it was so God they recorded as the Word of God it got recorded that sermon got recorded and now it is the Word of God even-steven a deacon so far the Holy Ghost signs wonders and miracles that when he spoke it's X recorded a deacon not even a preacher and it was recorded as a sermon start preaching bringing all the way from Genesis working it down he says he says why wouldn't you why do always resist the Holy Ghost don't lie and they stone him right there God come down veiled in there brother Malachi gets so full the Holy Ghost and he's dealing with a loss and says I have come my father I've come from my father and I'll go back to my father hey look insane absolutely crazy what if maokai would say I and my father are one and mean it absolutely sure now as far as the veil Christ this Christ was the greatest example of God veiled in flesh it was it's absolutely amazing the the Godhead study has been such an undertaking for me to really grasp it to hold it to be able to teach it to be able to understand it further and further but as once we got to these points as some of these scriptures started to actually be revealed to me it really helped me and it helped me to know on how this thing is coming yes saints of God there there is coming a time where we will have the very mind of Christ that's throw Simon what's that like I have no idea I do know there are thoughts like I'll say uh even being with sister Connie this this last week in here uh as we're trying to work a little bit here work a little air on on her house and whatever and we go ask I'd ask for this or that and and she would go and I'd see the battle that she's fighting the Lord just told me you do this and I go like this Oh silly me or you know the Lord the Lord told me to do this and yeah but I did this and so but but the Lord is constantly trying to guide her and to show her but she's in tune with it but all these voices now Satan knows God's within you and that he knows that God is trying to speak to you in that still small voice so he's got to put all your voices and he knows that you are six thousand years down six thousand years down from the fall and all this sin is compounded in your flesh and all the influence of this Laodicean world is just messing with us it's tearing us up it's tearing our minds up my goodness my cellphone is giving me tingling fingers now in ticularly hands I mean some messing with me home [Laughter] but I see the struggle that she's in she and I see her trying to yield and trying she's pushing hard to get into that leadership of the Holy Ghost that's where I want to be I want to be fully leading and guided by the Holy Ghost absolutely leaving the smallest things like what do you want me to do today absolutely I get on the jobsite Lord you want me to do this show me that I got to hear his voice do you want me to fast today do you want me to to win is this person new I caught brother Mike a fire hit our church and the smoke had totally uh taken our church and they couldn't breathe and it was in the carpet is everywhere and that day the Holy Ghost told brother mike.mccluskey leave work now but Mike said he got out of his thing called his boss and I go and I gotta go he went home he finished his his wife picked up stuff in mine ours finished putting up the walls of his garage and we had service right there two or three days before that someone gave him 60 chairs God had him in service and he had his garage ready for service the Holy Ghost says leave work now yes brother mike says no sir absolutely he said both Simon me my wife hung all those sheets and all those sheets of tea 111 he says in 45 minutes you were here but the camera texts me said brother can't beside you have a projector as absolutely just bought one boom I got there 45 minutes early got the projector setup or the mic had just got the walls him his wife got down to the walls and when we were ready for service the leadership of the Holy Ghost but I don't know too many men that would just leave work when God said leave work you got 40 hours of work we work week this week huh or do I are you willing to lay your your your job on the line if God says leave work god help us amen that's right now being the veil in Psalm and psalms 2 verse 6 wouldn't be fully yielded to the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost is so we're telling we're talking we're having good fellowship with sister Connie the other night and I was telling her how in February I got a I got such a movement of the Holy Ghost that's never hit before and I was always in the spirit for half an hour 45 minutes jumping shouting it was ours that was by the greatest feeling the Holy Ghost ever and for the next three days when I woke up he was there I felt him all over and I was it was a such a reverent time for me I'll never forget it and let me tell you how timid the Holy Ghost is I went to work I was feeling him on the way to work I feel him I'd call people listen I just feel him and he was there he was there he wanted to do it well with me he wanted to walk with me and I and I was at work and I was working and I'm working I'm cutting pie but this is and I'm still feeling the presence of God all over and it was just the most amazing one of the most amazing times in my life and I and I was feeling him and I had to go the bathroom so I went to the bathroom I got done with the bathroom and I was coming out of the bathroom and there's a real pretty young girl 21 years old and she's a construction worker demolition girl and I thought and I'm still feeding president god I thought I'm gonna say hi to her not anything evil or not I just said I'm gonna be I want to say hello so hello I said hello page and he left just like that he was gone I I did not feel him anywhere I did not I could not he left like that and I felt so burdened I said I hurry up I said I got back out I said lord please forgive me this is and he came right back just like that beside you just want to say hello you had absolutely no intentions of anything but you just want to say hello to this girl it was not the Lord's will as the Prophet was breaking down Christ at the the Pool of Bethesda I believe that all the the sick were trying to get in as the stirring of the waters he said he said now Christ was a totally LED of God God was veiled in his body and he went and picked out one sick person that was it he said now he's out that was divine love he said if it would have been human compassion he would have went to this one and healed that one healed this one and healed that because when you see someone in need someone hurt compassion naturally natural compassion starts kicking in oh my goodness they need help here and I gotta go help this and you know a Christ Fryzel he wanted to heal this one he wanted to heal that one that one this one but by the leadership of God he went and picked only one to heal and that was God that was God veiled in flesh completely veiled it was only only did what God wanted him to do see how see how far walks are off at least mine I oh my goodness I'm like Lord how am i how what will it take for me to get to that point now in Psalms 2 verse 26 I'm sorry verse 6 to 6 yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion I will declare the decree the Lord has said to be thou art my son this day I have begotten thee what God is now foreshadowing for telling that what he's going to create a son he's gonna create a body he's going to create a flesh to dwell in he says behold he's I've created these this days and this is my son right this is prophetic all the way now in Philippians 2 and verse 5 he says let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God took not robbery to be equal with God he says but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men absolutely he had to come in flesh right I've taught this before back home I said why can't Satan be saved well God's all-powerful and sure he can make a way for salvation for Satan you know or-or-or a fallen angel how can how can how can they can't be saved why because they're a spirit in order to save a spirit a spirit must die but God is God and God is a spirit and God cannot die there is no sacrifice that's why God did not let us fall in the spirit realm hello we're up there he won't put us in the flesh so we could fall in the past that's right absolutely that's why we have to endure this thing because this is this this we see this thing's over it's already done it's already finished he put us in these goofy little houses right here these little vessels he's dwelling places because the soul our spirit man is already it's then we have we don't have nothing to worry about praise we know God hey man all we're doing is bad on this little pest house that saw this thing fail the deep down nothing in here fell we're always this therefore did not change the seed if I have to see the little genes you know God and I in this gene seed I want to be a father a son I have a spirit and be a yeah all those things just like my daddy to create things where he said nothing changed that seed nothing spiritually genetics happened to that little G seed line absolutely nothing but this flesh this flesh had to suffer this thing is what Philips he allowed that that seed to fall that was in that flesh that this flesh fails the seed hey man that's right absolutely and if and if this flesh can Bale our seed the flesh can Veil the Holy Ghost the incorruptible seed hey man praise be to God now he was fashioned as a man humble himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross he meant now let's go to Romans 8 verse 3 for what the law could not do and though is weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh absolutely that's why he was able to deceive the devil because the what God was veiled in this flesh and Satan could look at that flesh and say man he breathes just like Jobe did he he eats just like Moses did he does he walks just like other men that Satan's defeated or other men that Satan's embattled he looks just like a man to me and it was a man but he had no idea it was it was in the likeness of sinful flesh absolutely he says and sending his own son in likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh absolutely now in Hebrews 2 and 9 he says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than angels for the suffering of death right he says crowned with glory and honor that that that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man he was what made as a man so that he could taste he was God put himself in flesh so that flesh could taste death that's how he redeemed us what's what through that flesh absolutely because the soul and the spirit is all connected to this flesh and get these things right he must have a sacrifice a perpetuation for that those deeds that were done in the flesh all that sin must be washed away so that so there must be as flesh they had no sin they could actually be an exchange absolutely it's right sure now Hebrews 10 verse 4 he says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings that would it's not he's but a body thou hast prepared me amen God prepared a body for himself in burnt offerings and the sacrifices for sin he is thou has had no pleasure then said i lo I come in the volume the book is written of me to do thy will O God absolutely now let's get to where the couple scriptures I want to hit here in John 2 verses 19 Jesus and answered answered and said unto them destroy this temple in three days I will raise it up this temple right he says then say that now what I wonder if this was the father speaking right here he said destroy this temple another's destroy the son I believe that was almost the father he's in three days he says what he says I will raise it up that's the Holy Ghost that sounds like the father to me he said he's speaking out see that's why that's why this that's why Jesus looks so insane he looks so crazy because he'd say things right that's right even 2,000 years later these these red letters are confounding the wise every seminary in America set up what to focus on finding who God is trying to find his will who is this God we want more we need salvation they know the end times has come and they know he may know the rapture is coming and they want salvation they set up these schools to train them and how to convert this and that he's but they're missing it Christ has been veiled again absolutely then said the Jew is 14 six years was this temple in building and without weird up in three days but he spake of the body of his temple I said the temple of his body amen in Hebrews five and six this is this really really helped me understand the veil the Godhead as he saith Austin another place thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek who in the days of his flesh who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying's and tears unto him that was able to save him from death look if the in-court rider was there he would have marked him and he was marked yet the Holy Ghost he says he had one soul travail he says he says to save him from death in here and it was heard and that he feared why was that body always crying the body of Jesus why was he always sad he was always praying it was the man and if he the man the perfect man had to cry inside from the Bhama Nations done in that city if he had to cry inside for the abominations for things that were done that he's seen his people doing he says I come as a head he says that I want to cover you like like a hand would have brewed he's but you would not these these it was his flesh that was veiled up it was that flesh had to conquer he had to conquer his flesh God was veiled in there now in Hebrews 10 verse 20 he says by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us he says through the veil that is to say his flesh saints of God Jesus Christ the man was a veil it was his body it was God's own body absolutely if you look in acts 2 and 22 he meant events are here these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you absolutely what that body remember if we are creating the image of God and you were given that body you were giving a body we're all giving these bodies right and we're in the image of God that means God had to have a body absolutely but his body did not come on the scene until what 4,000 years later because I had to come in as a saving power absolutely sure now let's continue on by the grace of God let's see in Colossians 1:19 Colossians 1:19 says forehead please the Father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether these things being earth or things in heaven and you that that ye were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in what in the body of his flesh through death in other words he took everything into that flesh every sin every evil thought all the iniquities was taken by that veil that flesh absolutely right to present you what holy and unblameable and I'm reproval in his sight absolutely that veil took it on after he took the brunt of the force right there that veil and as the problem started when it became a bumper absolutely his blood became a bumper for us even even though we sin now he's up there what he's that ugly still that bloody bleeding lamb right now yes and that veil that's the thing about him is that if you're looking reverie was the revelations of five and six it says is it don't weep John he says behold the lion the tribe of Judah has ytz he heard these things that he saw a lamb coming and that lamb that body came and took the book from the father it was the body coming to get it from God Himself absolutely but remember the same spirit that stone that throne is the same spirit in that body this is they Birdman said he says he says now he's I'll show you a mystery here and he goes there scripture where he talks about Jesus where Jesus says he says if he answer he says was John they said I was a child of God and Jesus said let me ask you a question he said the Son of Man is here on earth and he's also in heaven and the promise of reason what do you mean by that and then later in the sermon he says he said God was omnipresent that's exactly right and so he can be in heaven on earth at the exact same time yes sir that's right amens now simple study but this is a this is what we got amen now I want to read you a couple a couple quotes by the grace of God 56 truly he cried for mercy at the cross he cried like a man he says when he was dying and when he rose on Easter morning he proved he was God on that cross they saw a man crying isn't this but when he rose up you'll see him sad anymore everything changed it was over he says this is not mourn playing like I'm just a man it's God who I am and you revealing the revelation that's it he says I am God absolutely that's what I was trying to do all those things everything brought in relations worn those things he was proving it was his deity he was God but he had to play the part he's an actor absolutely you had to put their veil on and that both had to act he had to put that mask on everything had to act to hide who was behind that very God God very God was behind it as Lee all the way from Genesis 1 only brothers it was God hiding and he left that Bale act out MA he said we rose he proved a he was God a man he's the resurrected one he's God man he says God was in Christ he said he said now my for the reason people couldn't understand him sometimes it was Christ speaking or the son speaking other times it was the father speaking look at the scripture read the read the four Gospels and look at all these red letters and new with the understanding that you had the leadership you decide can you discern if that's the father speaking or the son is that God Almighty speaking at the flesh or is that a man yes he says sometimes it was the son speaking others it was a father he was a dual person how many dual persons do we have here tonight I fail constantly Saints all the time I fail but when it comes time to pray for the sick sometimes to teach a Bible study what we have to yield to the Holy Ghost say Lord you are now full control help me to catch your very mind and speak your words and what that'll be the exact same thing as Christ speaking absolutely sure now let's continue on he says it was a dual person he was one man the Sun God was was in him which was tabernacling him but he what did he do did he go around saying I'm the healer he says very contrary because remember that's just his body the life is the person the very person the invisible person the that is the life of God that is God himself he's the one that has all the power he's the one that makes all the decisions he's the one that does everything all faith everything we have is because of that invisible person God Almighty that's why we have to wait on him if there's we cannot glory in this flesh or anything that you think you've done arrived done there is no glory we have this is all a work of an invisible man absolutely absolutely but he has created a veil that we can see him now in saints of God when we catch that eyesight when we finally see him in his body that's what things are gonna this one's gonna gonna get hot absolutely I mean like there is there is and we start running and jumping absolutely because that's I cannot wait to hug that flesh they died for me that fresh they shed his blood on Calvary that's what I cannot wait for it I'm just gonna hug him as best as I can absolutely tell the whispering for every man he says what he says he says Cree take the cut the the the compliments of Amma healings of no he says it isn't me to do what the works it's my father that dwelleth in me yes sometimes I wonder if God allows people to get healed by a certain individual or listen ed to test whether they'll take the credit for it or they'll take the glory in it and saints of God that's where we must why our way ourselves as well absolutely now here in 57 12 11 he says Christ seemed to be a dual personality he would speak sometimes they'd scratch their heads and they didn't understand him he says he speak one thing one time look like and sometimes else something another what was it was Jesus speaking when Christ is speaking Jesus was the man he says Christ was the god that was in him no he says not me to do with the works my father taught men he doeth the works II God will share his glory with no one even the son would not take glory for what God had done I wonder I think on this here where the when they went when people came to worship Jesus how could you accept the honor except the father allow him to accept that spirit within him allows people to worship him because they're actually not worshiping that flesh they're worshiping the God within it but as we understand the greater understanding is what that got that flesh was God as we were well we will worship God in that flesh as well absolutely in the beginning was the word the word Ruth God the Word was God and that what word was made flesh absolutely very simple sure now instead of saying let's sing I know he says you know Jesus right at the end the end of his ministry his disciples couldn't understand him no one could understand why he says no one he said how many know they couldn't understand I'm sure why they thought he had a dual personality he says at times in time again dual personality dual personally that that flesh that veil had totally hidden God what on mystery but in this day saints of God that's why we have the revelation of Jesus Christ to lift up the veil but remember this mystery cannot just be taught it has to be revealed and you have to be able to see it you have to be able to hear it absolutely yes yes it is a complete and he said he was a capstone revelation to Godhead propensity it was the greatest revelation you could have is understanding who God is the simplicity of that he's just one person absolutely now I like the stories as Christ on the boat he says they had entered with him in the ship and brought him aboard and when they went across the sea to preach over on the other side and Jesus saw as Gloria has this glorious opportunity he's being tired and weak because he was human he wasn't immortal then he was a man and he had to die that's the reason God had to be made a man in order to die that's why he didn't have to save that ship because the disciples he had to save it for himself because what he could die he had a potential death right there he was made of March oh absolutely but once the body is resurrected and got it now is glorified now I can die no more I'm here which liveth and she'll never die again amen amen sure now but what that was that his first veil absolutely not let's see here in Hebrews verse one God who has sundry times and divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son by whom he had appointed heir of all things by whom he had also made all things who being the brightness of his glory write what it was what he they were dealing with what the light now sure God was what in the light let there be light absolutely that was showing what that was showing for that was actually take place I believe as before or am sorry that was after what the Sun had come out of the father okay now in Hebrews 11:1 he says now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth so that word there was now with God right God was the invisible man right he was invisible and he said let there be I want to be a son and he spoke out he said let there be light and what there was a body now that light body God the invisible God goes and dwells within that light and through now when I was father and son it is what the invisible God and the light body now that light and he speaks now he starts to creation yes that's for the confusion let us make man was that God in the Angels let us make man no that was the father in the son let us make man in our image absolutely sure now let's continue on by the grace of God just a real simple thought Saints the veil let's see here let's let's move here in rebel nation's 1 verse 16 completely veil himself here as John heard the voice he turned to look and he's seen one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and he had his right hand had seven stars out of mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the son shyness in his strength even though he saw the body but the very face of God shone out what the low gasp once again that bright at the face shined what the holy ghost that low gasp that light shine right out revealing it was the same one that spoke the world in existence absolutely sure now I see here kind of caught up tonight by the grace of God it's alright here we go in John 1 verse 2 and 1:1 says in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God that word is the logos it means a what a spoken word right he said the same was in the beginning with God who he was there all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life who was that life that was God himself he says in that light in their logos was like the invisible God he says and that life was the light of men absolutely and that light shined in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not God chose God Himself chose to dwell in the light that was his first choice for a veil was in the light because what's more powerful than light is darkness more powerful the light absolutely not darkness cannot even stand in the same room as light you can't do it it runs that flees at the speed of light it's just as fast as I absolutely is it and then the light shined in the darkness of the darkness comprehended at night now in verse 7 and there came for a witness this the same came for a witness to bear witness of the lights he's talking about who Jesus Christ absolutely is that were made fresh that light's made flesh see that's why these words of God are so important this is a very light these black letters these red letters is very light when you that's why we had the lampstands and all these things because they've this this word is now the light because we're in the darkness when in the world but once we hear the word the word of God he says what is a light that shines upon our seed here when we hear these things it goes and hits the very seed our life and as shoots and brings light to our seed and it quickens our seed so the word is veiled that's why people can burn this and throw it away and speak all evil against it because it's veiled he said there was a man sent from God he's at oh sorry verse verse 7 the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not whom John the Baptist was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light that was that true light that which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was that same God that gives the life to them now in in Deuteronomy 9 2 he says a great people great and tall the children of Anakin's whom thou knowest of whom that was heard who can stand before the child the children of anak understand this day that the Lord thy God is he which goes over before thee what as a consuming fire that was God veiled in that logos once again and he want it went and destroyed the enemies absolutely sure and in Hebrews 12 verse 28 he says for God is a consuming fire he's one of the same in the in in the Exodus in Exodus 14 verse 24 and it came to pass the morning which morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the fire of the cloud and of the cloud and troubled the host the Egyptians God was now lost in the pillar fire blocking the Egyptians forward his people and God was in the mysteries looking out through the fire he said that God that thought that Sun Jesus was right there he was right there before Abraham was I am Amen that's why he could that's why you could say when he had to say that's why he is God because he was right there he was just another veil that was his veil that was his body as a light body absolutely yes sure and Daniel 2 verse 22 he reveals the deep and secret things he North when is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with himself he knows what's in the darkness he has to bring light to it and expose it absolutely yes sure in Psalms 104 verse 1 bless the Lord O my soul o live my god he's the Vil our great that were clothed with honor and Majesty who covers thyself with light as with a garment absolutely yes sure God is veiled in light in acts 9 1 Saul went out with with threatenings and breathing's thrown out to find these Christians full the Holy Ghost and in verse 3 and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven was that the corporal body of Christ no the body was up there was still bleeding what the B's atoning for the people up in heaven the mercy seat but then now verse 4 and he fell to the earth and a voice saying Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus the same one that invisible God now veiled back with the light coming back to his people once again it's the same God all the way through that's why that picture of the pillar of fire brother above the prophets head is so important it shows it was the exact God though Abraham meant it was exact same God that Moses ruined what the Bible says when I raised up a prophet like unto Moses like me Christ was another one but it was also our prophet he was just like Moses those who has powerful ministries Moses and our prophet unparalleled outside of Christ they were off the charts absolutely I mean look at all look as Moses one of the Egypt's he conquered an entire nation by the power of God nothing stood before him creation literally took place right there as for in the form of plagues what is this third poet's I wonder if this moving as this was going to be this is going to be different than we've ever thought we don't need that's why Jesus said he's don't even try to think what you're going to say don't try to think what you're gonna do be sufficient full of days because it goes of the day what tomorrow but has evil in as well he says I am Jesus whom that persecutors it is hard for thee to kick against the pre the pricks John 3:24 every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light that's why they're in darkness and Ezekiel eight neither comes a light lest his deeds should be reproved oh my Saints have got our Lord everything wrong with me shown religious if you pick up an evil spirit on me you are obligated to tell me and Isabella Williams as I charge you to tell me I leave you with a charge absolutely yeah praise be to God oh my in 1st Timothy 6 verse 15 he says which in his type which in his times he shall shew is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings in their lives who only hath immortality dwelling in that light 1st John 1 verse 4 and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full is the message which you've heard from him and declare and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all I just saw a little experiment you take a candle and hold it up next to a wall and you shine a light on it and there's immunity there's gonna be a shadow where that candle is but there's no shadow where that light is because there's no darkness in them at all hey man yes sir praise the Lord and if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light he says we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin correct amen now look we says here he says notice then when we become part of him as you as you are the veil that veils him now once you receive the baptism Holy Ghost you now become the very veil of God you now our God or God's walking in your flesh right that is why it's so careful that we must be very very a sincere in our walk because if you stumble someone they can they with that that will come up on Judgment Day correct he's then when we become part of him as you are a veil that veils and you are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ amen he says he said you see you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hidden you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he is in you you are temple you are tempering Christ that's behind the veil the skin because of this veil the veil again is in the veil is in again and human flesh you hide God from the unbeliever not everyone's going to be saved Saints when it comes down to the end of the end it's all predestination and God's election and choosing if there's a pillar fire right now and it would stay a pillar fire and go and we could we could walk with and go around the world we would save every single person because that would prove there's a god there he is look he's what do you want from him in that pillar fire God would speak out and tell him what he wanted what he needed and that person would accept that yeah but remember this is now full salvation God said he's a stranger to not follow he said and that lose one so he's sending he's he's putting out the Holy Ghost and believers so that that now he can go walk through the world and what wins souls but remember he V has to veil himself there and what are we to win by were to win with the Word of God with signs wonders and miracles what proving that what's in you is real and the unbeliever is not gonna believe it a lot of times the majority time because it's you who would follow a man now many people they like to follow themselves they'd like to lead themselves but God has the veil himself in you and he wants to veil himself in you and be and you be used by him absolutely that is the whole point of the everything here in the culmination of everything there's the whole point he wants to live and dwell in you so you can have a testimony so he can do the greater works through you absolutely sure like he says here it's in a being led of the Holy Spirit 1956 he says and these things that you see now will be a mature toward our Lord is fixing to do the things that were taking place in the prophet's ministry he says what you see now he's as amateur compared to what's coming things have got in closing the best thing the best scriptural advice is to number one put God first number two get a prayer life like you've only dreamed of I told this testimony I was deal I did a side job for an insulator man he works overseas and has left his Japanese wife at home and I think I suppose before she dresses extremely tight closing bobbed hair makeup but because her husband left her for long extended periods of time and she did not want to be unfaithful to him because she's very pretty her only outlet was Jesus Christ and she go to her basement and she said she started praying for five to six hours a day and she would answer God would speak to her constantly and she said people would come to her in her church and say what I came in renamed she said they said sister we need an answer on this and she would go to the closet guy would speak to her right away and tell them and she says as many people who are very wealthy because of her getting in that closet and giving them the very correct answer on what to do in their lives Saints oh god this is a denominational Christian this is someone who stores pants but because they had a prayer life who am i preaching here but because their prayer was so in tune with God William William Seymour he said he said he had such a hunger for God that he started praying what 3 to 5 hours a day for what three years before and that is use a street hit I quote and the Prophet was teaching he said how many Moses's are out here how many Moses's that they have the same calling of God on them that the minister would have or Moses would have he says but instead these that you've taken a job and you've taken the easy life you've got a job at the pulp Factory said or somewhere he said that you didn't want to be used by God I thought he says he says you sold your birthright out he said to having an easy living life he did not want to be a veil for Jesus Christ man let's let's stand very simple Saints but as as we're out and about I'll say that when when I'm witnessing now but when I come to a soul I step in my in my mind I step back we start talking and I step back now and I just wait and I wait for things to come out the best I can and I weigh their words very carefully and I'm like Lord what would you have me say and if you just if you'll find out if you just yield and you work you work with what you're given out of their mouth you work with it and you bring it in a sweet kind manner real gentle humble just kind and and if they're looking in your eyes you can you can see what they're seeing they know they're approaching a man of God or a daughter of God I just met a big tall guy built like a tank in his 50s ruined his entire life he started spilling his guts I said sir can I pray for you he said yeah I like that I'd like you to pray for me to the prayer of faith the saints of God he went on his way but he walked in that factory like this fished down like this wouldn't smile this and that but as I started to talk with them saints of God you can you can change the very countenance of their faces by just your words just by how you are and letting God flow through you you can make a difference you don't have to be a preacher you can make a difference just by being sweet and kind and what letting out that spirit you are now a veil of God you are hiding God let him out it's time for him to come out and reveal himself and make himself manifest the promise that the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years we have not seen the book of Acts for 2,000 years like it should be it's time - we've been veiling them in long enough it's time for us to really buckle down die out so that he can live through us fully let's bow our heads say a word of Prayer dear Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just love you so much Lord we're we're confident in your Lord we we trust your God Lord though we believed every word Lord these quotes Lord are just just tasty nuggets God we we - Lord your word of God Lord is just a the perfect grandeur the bread from heaven and Lord God Lord you veiled yourself Lord when you came down to Egypt Lord you veiled yourself as you came fully and your body got lured and now is the times wrapping up Lord and we're right here at the end of labor to see agon the mouth that breaking of the day at the evening time here God Lord your veil that once again or do you feel many people Lord with the Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Lord we want now as your prophet said we have to let this the spirit move we have to let them work and order the only way is to consecrate it to crucify that flesh daily not only the fleshly but our spirit realm that our will know God help our wills to die out Lord and we're serious or we're we're so tired ourselves we're tired of this world tired of my greatest enemy know what I'm tired of myself fall short constantly Lord and we wish one day we want you to live through us Lord if you just do it and Lord you know how to get us each one there Lord to where we're willing and able and fully yielded God and over to where we enjoy it Lord we don't counter the sacrifice but we take away that we do it with love and happiness and just we're just full of your presence Scott we just love you so much lord I know it was a simple cut-ups service here Lord it's a little simple study but Lord I believe that the veil is about ready to be rent again Lord the Bible says Lord when he comes we shall be like him or that full manifested nature that divine nature put on full effect again Lord displayed one more time for the world to see and their will be done not done in an open show Lord the world in general is gonna see it Lord he will Lord this bride will take over Lord and we want to be part of it Lord and or build our character Lord so we can handle this Lord said you wouldn't give us any more than we can handle Lord but I believe we can handle a lot so just bless every soul Lord for sitting through a little Cubs service Lord we love you so much granted Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen Saints we want to be fully yielded I know I keep saying it and but and I don't even understand really what I'm saying what is this like what is full leadership of the Holy Ghost saints of God we're we're entering into our land we've never been to before in a time no other people have seen this time we're going into something we is the unknown we were not we were not the Prophet we I have no idea what it's like to live in another dimension the majority of my life I have no idea what crossing over is gonna be like the Prophet does not know what it's like to take a body change but saints of God we're going to experience this we're going into something I don't know what it's like I can't even imagine it but it's so important and if you look at the studies you look at how though the scripture goes it's gonna look like we're going right into death the death angel be standing right there you know God said I'll go walk right into it but there'll be a body change before he takes his swing we have to be very yielded our pastor really cam has been he's been hammering dying and rotting we need to killing out for eight or nine years now and I'll be honest this flesh gets tired of hearing it because what the next day I gotta go to work I have to go labor and sweat and get cut and tired and beaten and worn out and here I'm yielding to my job I'm yielding to my boss and not the Holy Ghost where is the balance how do this is the balance I want where is the fine balance on how to live this life and let God live out of you that's the hard part amen brother do you have a song for us if anyone has prayer needs prayer healing touch and answer our God is still able he's here where were two or three are gathered there I am in the mist he's here he's faithful if he doesn't get me answer tonight he will he said of whatever you ask he's I'll give it to you but we must but it must be obviously motive injective [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] into worship turned about raise god I would appreciate the message tonight amen is this something that God would want to hide behind you not only want to hide behind me who are we I was really encouraged by that message brother I really appreciate that that scripture
