anoint you in order to speak your word and like the people to here in Jesus Christ me the church said Amen god bless me the sea crazy sorry god bless you as you're standing sorry forgive me I'd like to take your Bibles to Revelation chapter 14 I like to continue on that revelation series Revelation chapter 14 I like to greet all the saints good to see the Saints in house the Lord tonight praise God thank God for His mercy for another opportunity to be in the house of the Lord we like to Lord willing look at verse 13 it's kind of where we left off last Wednesday night Sunday we looked at numerology and then God's purpose in the evening and here I think we'll pick up tonight here on the book of Revelation 13 is such a strange verse you know verses 1 to 12 we looked at last week and we saw the 144,000 on Mount Zion and then three angels fly in the heavens and preach the gospel brother Ram said was Martin Luther John Wesley and the seventh angel brother branham and then now verse 13 gives another warning so it's almost like knew that there would be saints reading about the Tribulation Period but yet they'd still be in the Gentile church age and they would need some encouragement from the Lord so verse 13 is encouragement 14 to 20 is Armageddon so let's look to here tonight Lord willing we'll finish 14 and begin 15 15s one of the shortest chapter in the book of Revelation and then Lord willing maybe 16 we'll see let's just read verse 13 together on three ready one two three and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth yayyyy saith the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them amen may God as blessing the rejas word may be seated so we'll look at these here tonight by God's grace we're trying to make as much progress as we can let me pull up my notes here and trust you've been enjoying the book of Revelation amen I believe this is part 94 tonight by God's grace we ended last week with the teaching that the prophet of God taught under the fifth seal the importance of having the commandments of God the Old Testament and the testimony of Jesus Christ the New Testament now verse 13 I said it's quite a peculiar verse as where it's placed we see that John is told right blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth now of course this is speaking to John here in the Isle of Patmos on 80/90 right right around the ninety so right about the turn of the first century and it's right written blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth so anyone after this book is written blessed are them now of course you know they were blessed as well that died before this book was written but remember there's blessings just for hearing this book and for obeying this book right we looked at that last week so he's saying blessed are they which died that have heard this word and he says yeh saith the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them all reminds me of that song I'll my way just a few more weird days and then right the Holy Spirit's telling John to tell them just keep laboring once you die you'll rest and then remember that your works will follow you praise God they're either gonna follow you for for a reward or they're gonna follow you for condemnation so may God help us to know that our works may God help us to do the right works that when our works follow us they'll testify that it was our faith that was the right kind of faith and remember there's three steps to works remember the first step is love because faith worketh by love so the first thing is to love God with all your heart soul mind and strength once you love God then you've got faith because faith works by love and then when you got faith faith goes to work because if there's no works after faith that faith is dead and it's really not a faith is that right James said faith without works is dead and he said you're justified by works and faith which we know that doesn't contradict with what Paul said because brother Branham says when Paul says were justified by faith alone what he means is that we're justified by the faith that God sees but James says when he says were not justified by faith alone but faith in works he says James is justifying us by what man sees a vet so God sees our faith but man see how it works and that's true even the days of Jesus remember when in Peters house remember when they brought that man and they brought him down through the roof Jesus the Bible says Jesus saw their faith and church have you prayed tonight when we brought these prayer requests if you came in faith and you brought this name up before the throne of God then Jesus saw your faith tonight as well amen because we don't have to bring somebody physically to Christ we can take them spiritually to Christ because we can take them by prayer by intercession and when we go to Christ and we feel what the sick persons feeling even though they're not here when we feel it the Bible says the high priest can be touched by the fee feeling of our infirmities amen so thank God that he can be touched and then what we must do is believe because the high priest loves to be touched by the feeling of our infirmities amen he ever lives to give intercession for us amen but he says I can only intercede based upon your profession amen so I want to say it again tonight god I believe God is gonna heal havens wrist they met I believe God's gonna strengthen brother Simon I believe God is gonna minister to that man that I was witnessing to that he'll come to church and take a book I'm just gonna believe that I believe God is going to save the souls of those friends of the girls and I believe if I confessed if I profess him believe it I believe God will do it I don't believe God's gonna strengthen our sister Connie minister to her tonight amen so see he can only minister as we profess his promise God is faithful I don't know when I don't know how but God is faithful amen liddie you can switch over here I got some slides here force now that's that verse there your works do follow them now since we're here revelation just flip over to chapter 20 verse 13 now this is at the white throne judgment remember some people are gonna get saved at the white throne judgment I preached on that quite often to remind you and myself that even if people don't make a confession of Christ on this earth it's possible army it's possible on the day of judgment they'll be surprised and Jesus will actually ask them to go on the right side his right side rather with those that are as the Sheep right not the ghost but as a sheep and they'll say when did we do this and he said when you gave close to those naked Christians you did it unto me right Amen because it's a surprise now verse 20 chapter 20 verse 13 and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it and the death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works to see your works follow you right like that saying goes whatever you do in life echoes in eternity that's nothing but the truth thank God we got the blood though to wipe out all of our sins before we go on that side thank God for that and those evil works will follow us because he's forgiven all of our trespasses which is why he sent his son as an offering for our sin so we even see books open and all the works are recorded right and your works follow you everything you do follows you praise God oh it's so important that we do the right works amen because now that God is not unjust to forget your labor of love praise God now I just want to just say a few things on that let me pull up that scripture I believe it's in first Corinthians so why don't you pull that up here the labor of love scripture now I'm sorry it's Hebrew 6:10 so forgive me here 6:10 I thought it was first Christians Hebrews 6:10 I think I mentioned this yeah Sunday night let's just go over this though November Hebrews 6:1 to 12 is Paul basically showing how people can partake of heavenly gifts and spiritual powers and partake of the Word of God but yet they would be a thorn they would produce thorns or thistles right and that's what we know that's the doctrine called the anointed ones at the end times at the rain falls on the just and the unjust and look at verse 6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put into an open shame when people publicly live contrary to the Word of God it's as if they're crucifying Christ in 2019 because they put Christ to an open shame when a woman knows better about wearing sexy clothes but yet she wears it and she says I don't care what the Word of God says those churches that's just a fanatic Church she's crucifying Christ afresh right when a man knows better about cussing and committing adultery and drinking and bar hopping and he drug taken and yet he continues to do it he's crucifying Jesus Christ himself he might as well get out nails and and a hammer and and shout crucify him crucify him right because they're crucifying the holy spirit that's telling them the Word of God is right they might as well they might as well get out across and it might as well put up a a dummy of Jesus you know like a a physical body of Jesus and they might as well shout crucify Christ they might as well nail Bible to that cross because when you live contrary to what the Holy Spirit has led you to live it's open shame it's disgrace and it's a crucifixion for Christ but I say that we don't crucify Christ we crucify ourselves that's the crucifixion you and I have day after day week after week we take up our cross daily and follow him you and I are experienced a self crucifixion of our will but people that go to church and hear the word but reject it and won't live it they're actually crucifying the effects of the Holy Spirit to themselves today amen not how awful and they taste of heavenly gifts they see miracles they see knowledge they see wisdom they do all these things and they sing about miracles right and yet if they don't obey that spirit they're in danger of crucifying Christ today what do they produce in verse eight but that which bear thorns they produce a thorn instead of fruit of the Spirit they produce a thorn they produce death and briars is rejecting as nigh to cursing whose end is to be burnt but beloved then we just think about you call me beloved you call me friend beloved will persuade to better things of you and things that accompany salvation though thus we speak for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love what's the order again Church love faith works God's not going to forget your labor of love love us must motivate you coming to church tonight if it didn't it's time to get right with God love has to motivate it all your works are motivated by love which love faith work with my love and then faith produces works if it's alive it produces works and your works will follow you all the way either to the marriage supper of the lamb or the where you have the judgments of God give it out or your works will follow you to the great white throne judgment I want mine to follow me to the rewards before the throne of Christ at the marriage supper of the lamb in the head see God's not going to forget anything you do if you clean the church for Jesus if you give money to the poor Christians for Jesus if you pray for the sins of the your family and the church and and the city anything you do God will not forget your work in labor of love which you show toward his name in that you minister to the Saints and do Minister amen God will not forget that because whatever you do for God's people you do it for him ain't ahead honey yeah so when I preach to it I'm tired we'll have to sacrifice time for my family or or whatever whatever I sacrifice if I'm doing it for God in the Saints then God forget that he'll remember that hallelujah same thing for you whatever you do for God's people he won't forget it because your works follow you he'll he'll have those books open they'll say look at this they did it all these years all this faithful service enter the joys of the Lord prepared for you from the foundation of the world amen God doesn't forget those works and labor of love let's go to Ephesians 2:10 I just want to reiterate this again passages in the at least an evangelical circles Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves as a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast so we're not going to boast of our works we're not saved by our works but verse 8 for we are his workmanship right created in Christ in Christ Jesus rather unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so you're not saved by your works but your saves you can do a work for God hey not in there yeah you are his workmanship you are his masterpiece can I say like that amen a Christian a Holy Ghost field Christian is God's masterpiece for this world to see amen thank the Lord so see your works will follow you whatever works you new for Christ for his name for the Saints however you minister to God God's people here it will follow you and it's recorded and it'll be announced there at the judgment seat of Christ for we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ amen now let's look at the next symbol here we these are the symbols BR did we already the lamp reported four thousand three angels announcements battle Armageddon we'll get there in just a moment we did the the father's name in the forehead and of course the Horus forehead for Babylon the three angels we ended with the commands of God in the faith of Christ and then today let's look at the harvest now so we got your Bibles remember let's go back to revelation 14 now look at and I looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle now look at him he's on a cloud right and isn't that how Jesus left in Matthew 28 remember the angel said however he left he left on a cloud a cloud take him to heaven and Jesus said however he let hover I leave that's how I'm coming back amen so see he keeps his word he left on a cloud he's coming back on a cloud then he's got a sharp sickle for harvest and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time has come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe now here's a quote on the harvest this is from the Laodicean Church age this is the age I'm sorry this age is the last of the seven church ages what began the first or Ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in this last or later seen age the two vines will yield their final fruit the two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destinations the so watering the growing is all over summer is ended the sickle is now thrust into the harvest amen so now we know when the harvest happens the harvest happens after the bride has expressed unproduced all of her fruit so when the bride gets to the spot that there's no more growing for the bride there's no more fruit for the bride that's when the harvest comes amen so the rapture is like a form of the harvest right because Jesus talked about that in Matthew 13 the angels have come and the harvest they'll take God's wheat to the garner which is the marriage supper of the lamb and the tailor's will be bound first and of course they'll be taken to the tribulation and eventually burn after the white throne judgment so we see the harvest is plain right here in the scripture look at verse 16 in Revelation 14 16 and he that sat on the cloud thrust in the sickle the earth and the earth was reaped and nones another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe and the angel thrust in his sickle and the to the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs that's quite a thought now let's get the why just for a moment here the winepress is the wrath of God and it's a symbol the winepress is a symbol of the slaying of the sinners who took the mark of the beast and worshipped His image the Battle of Armageddon because verse 20 tells us where this is taking place it's taken without the city well we know what city they're talking about there's only one the city in the book of Revelation and that's Jerusalem amen Jerusalem is the city so this winepress is outside of the city not in the city it's without the city and it produces blood so this is a press now winepress was just a VAT and they would put the grapes in there and they would just have men or women that would you know they would gird up their loins and they would just smash right and then there was a little distilling a little dispenser and I that would come out the what the the blood of the grapes right and they would take that of course and that would become their wine well this is when Jesus comes back for Armageddon the Bible said here that the the wine is pressed and now wine I'm sorry grape juice doesn't flow out of here but blood flows out of here and it's so high then it goes up to a horse's bridle right horse's bridle so think of how tall the horses the children I don't know this is symbolic or this is physical but the Bible sentence for one thousand six hundred furlongs which represents about two hundred miles so this is a stream of blood that's two hundred miles long and as tall as a horse bridle that of the horse so this is some major major destruction now is it possible it is possible because the Bible said in Daniel 11 that all nations will gather against Israel they'll gather on Israel including the Christ and the armies and so it's possible or so that's a lot of blood that's a lot of destruction we don't like to think about that but when sinners fail to repent when sinners fail to accept the merciful loving nail-scarred hand of God that's constantly reaching out Jim for 2,000 years this hands been reaching out to Gentiles 2,000 years God's been extending hand after hand God sent love know after love note to this town people saying receive it receive and each time they slapped away his hand can you imagine they slapped God face to say we don't want the gospel we don't need Jesus Christ we don't need that for 2,000 years and slowly that cup is filled up where God's patience is running out man for that final call once the Gospels reach every nation every nation slaps it away I don't want that don't give us that Holy Roller preaching don't tell us about that we've got our movies and we've got our sports we've got our money we've got our jobs we've got our civilization our culture we've got everything we need we don't need the gospel and finally God says that's enough take the sickle and harvest the earth and when that happens blood flows for two hundred miles because God was merciful this is not God's love this is God's wrath God's love was 2,000 years trying to get the Gentiles to accept pardoning grace for their sins that was God's love this is not God's love this is God's wrath this is not God's mercy this is God's judgment we after what waiting half an hour for something I sat in a car line today on the drive home for like two minutes I was garroted getting on patient like what I'm driving out you know cross it over the middle line do I need to turn around I need to get home I've got things I got church tonight and I get I'm getting upset with just one minute of waiting it and then pretty soon it clears up and like why did I get so upset you know but God waits 2000 years and then finally says that's fine if you don't want it that's the only thing left is judgment if you don't want mercy the only thing left is judgment now for God to be just to do that God would have to knock on their hearts door would he not God would have to do everything he'd have to send preachers he'd have to have an Internet to send preachers into their homes through their phones and their computers he's so merciful he'd send preachers by plane by boat by automobile anyway every nation had to hear the gospel and then when they refused God then God sends judgment how great is the mercy of God Church how great is his wrath though his judgment is fair this is fair this is not unjust this is fair God tried time after time mercy after mercy week and year after year month decade after decade till finally he ran out of patience keep your spot there go to Revelation 19 you get a little more you get the idea of the winepress in Revelation 19 verse 15 now the word tread let's look at 19 15 and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and the wrath of Almighty God go down to verse 17 and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the Great God and you may eat of the flesh of the kings and the flesh of captains in the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great and who do you see there I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sound the horse and against his army so there it is this is how you have two hundred miles of blood because all the armies of the world they all gather to try to come against the Word of God see how to fight they are Church may God help us and never have an arrogant prideful spirit against God's Word may God help us not to have an arrogant spear against a preacher who's just trying to get us to repent because this is the end of pride this is the end of epic sword of God this is what it heads up this is spiritual death saying oh we're gonna try to fight against God's Word we're gonna try to fight against God's Son I don't like what the Word of God says so I'm gonna try to fight against it this is the this is the culmination of it the last or also the last battle before the or the the Millennium is Armageddon and they're coming imagine they got their tanks they got their their helicopters and all we're gonna beat we're going to defeat Jesus and there's so many of them so and they think they can do it and all of a sudden out of heaven comes a white horse rider amen I literally and he's got blood on his thigh and he doesn't need ammunition and tanks and all these things and fighter pilots he's one thing the word out of his mouth and with that he smacks him and it creates such a feast for the birds that he calls it the great feast two hundred miles of dead horse riders 200 miles of dead soldiers and he says come Birds swallow them up this is the great supper of the wrath of God in verse 15 the Bible said and he treadeth the winepress that means he stamps out the riot winepress of the fierce and wrath of Almighty God Jesus gets stamp out the wrath of God because he's already experienced the wrath of God Amen Jesus is just in stamping on those grapes because he was already stamped on can you say Amen program tells us this in the Patmos vision he breathes revelation 19:15 and then he says what did he do the wrath of God was upon us for being sinners is that right no one can save himself there's nothing we can do we're all born in sin shape iniquity come to the world speak of Lies and what'd he do he came to the earth hallelujah and tread the winepress all the wrath of Almighty God was poured out upon him now our worthy Oh Lamb of God for you were slain so Jesus can stop on the other wrath on the grapes of all these men he can smash them because he knows what it's like because God God's law smash-up him already amen law condemn him the sin of the world was placed upon him and he was smashed he was crushed he was bruised they meant he was chasing he was bruised for our iniquities but with His stripes we are healed taking the sins of the world upon him and he bore our sin that God poured out the fierceness of his wrath upon him he's wounded for our trance questions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed never a man die like that man he suffered until the blood in the water separated in his body right and the drops of blood dropped out of his brow before his death now a member who remembers what the word guess 70 means oil press that's what the word means Jesus prayed in the garden Gethsemane Jesus prayed in the oil press praise God Jesus his will had to be crushed there it got crushed it got stamp stopped on Jesus got stomped on until the Holy Spirit left him right after their right or I forget 70 his will had to get pressed through prayer not my will but not be done prayer was God's way to get his will to be crushed amen so church what makes you and I think any different that if we want our will to become God's will it's gonna have to be crushed in prayer is there a circuit certain secret where we can take an easier Road than Jesus and be called the bride of Jesus Christ or do we have to go through the same thing Christ went through the same thing we have to die in prayer if we're ever going to manifest all of God's will for our life for Jesus to finish the work amen for Jesus to finish the job that God sent him to knew he had to be crushed his will had to be crushed in prayer in the oil press and the oil that was the same thing at the winepress right they just put olives in this time and they just smashed it and they caught the oil that came out same thing and so Jesus had to get smashed his will and to be crushed by the by his love for God so that the Holy Spirit came out so that he can be cursed for our sins this is why Jesus can tread the winepress of the wrath of God because he knows what it's like someday those brass feet of justice glory when he comes as a judge I love this he'll tread the Antichrist glory and all of his enemies hallelujah he'll walk through the earth with a rod of iron in his hand amen oh repent Center friend while you got a chance to repent try put it off and think it's a little story that won't happen it will happen it just couldn't happen to me it will happen to you she's warning them this is going to happen now for those that die it won't happen at Armageddon but it'll happen at the great white throne of judgment where they'll be separate as goats and they'll be tossed alive into the fire that burned at the lake of fire imagine is being tossed a lot of fire in the fiery furnace it's going to happen to those who reject the Word of God I like what buh-bam says here feed a brass so Jesus had feet of brass tread down his enemies divine judgment because he suffered and tried out the winepress of the fierceness of God to pay for our sins and then we guilty poor miserable worms as we are stick our little nose up and read some kind of atheist book now he calls it a Theon ik I don't think that's a real word he said people read them atheism book and stick their nose up and try to think there's no God and say there's nothing like this and judgment can't come he'll take those brass feet and crush out his enemy he'll wade over the Antichrist he'll take those apostate churches and sling them into turning to think about that he'll take churches and sling them out in the lake of fire because they failed to accept his nail-scarred love his knocking open your hearts door and let me come in and clean out your closet make you wear the right clothes clean out your vocabulary make you say the right thing give me some wisdom to fear God and fear man right fear God and man they just turned it down time after time and they drive it with drugs and sexual sin and they draw on it well Jesus says you're worthy then of condemnation and he slings them into the lake of fire he'll crush out his enemy he'll wait over the Antichrist he said some they're gonna sling it there somewhere the consuming followers she'll be consumed and done away with and he will reign on the earth him and his church forever amen remember the Bible said God is not far from every one of us praise God so getting so get that the people you're supposed to witness to God is already close to them so when you walk up to them if you've got the Holy Ghost God gets a little closer to the head hey man I owe you God is trying to get to every person and he will praise God but God wants to send you and I sometimes a witness to people now let's look at this atheist thought I preached this a few years ago I'm just gonna hit a few scriptures just in review the Bible says this the Bible teaches plainly Psalms 14:1 The Fool has said in his heart there is no God they're corrupt they've done Obama works there's none that doeth good proverbs 28:26 he that trusts us in his own heart is a fool the Atheist will say oh there's no God you need to search out the truth and know what you believe for yourself the Bible said you're just as foolish if you say well I'll just trust in your own heart nonsense remember this proverbs 18 - I love this because it's so true about today a fool hath no two understanding they don't want to try to understand God but that is heart may discover itself they walk around and say go to college and you'll discover yourself just stay away from God you're gonna discover that you're nothing but a worm that deserves to be slung into hell for all your rebellion in a and wickedness and sin in adultery oh but gods knocking on their heart thank God for those campus preachers that are out there trying to get them you can't discover yourself in your heart because your hearts to sip deceitfully wicked above all things but you can discover yourself in the word of Jesus Christ that's right let me review some of these here remember there's a man named Anthony flue I think he passed away but in 2004 he converted from an atheist to Christian by studying DNA he was one of the most outspoken atheists but once he started studying DNA he realized DNA is nothing but a book of instructions and if you study DNA long enough you're started learning the alphabet of DNA and just studying God's creation makes you realize there's a creator every living thing has DNA and DNA is the instruction manual for how to build brown eyes how to build brown hair how to build pink lips or shaggy beard it's all written in your DNA and that's contained in yourselves so scientists study deeper all they find is more and more intelligence amen it's God's hand it's God's fingerprint the more they study science the more they discover God Almighty there's that evangelist named Ray Comfort now he don't know the message but he went around asking the smartest doctorates on the UCLA campus he said can you give me one observable evidence for evolution and they could not give one the smartest man in all of the nation the world couldn't give you one evidence for evolution what they do is they try and prevent says they try to give you some atheon ik book like the winds or Origin of Species right which I don't know how they like him because he exalted he exalted white people over black people and said the black people need to die right there in his book and there they're not even real people he said how in the world could people be behind Darwinism it's foolish it's from the pits of hell but yet though they'd rather take that than God's holy word they deserve destruction to say things like that hey man the Bible said while all nations are one Baradei men and so they cannot give any examples of that oh it's so so evil I had a few other things on that now the Bible says that God has to reveal themselves to every person we've gone over too few times in revelation chapter I'm sorry Romans chapter 1 the Bible said the invisible things of the world are seen through the things that are created amen so you want to say well where's God go look at the tree you'll find God where's God go look at the sky you'll see God go look at the universe you realize they're discovering now that the universe is so so much greater than they even thought it was they think there's article this week about how it's expanding even more than they thought it's larger than they thought and it keeps stretching I just read that this morning in Psalm 43 God said I am THE LORD thy God that stretches out the heavens he's just stretching it out so if he's stretching it out that means it used to be back in one little small little piece which was in his mind hey do you know that did you know all the you know all the science points to the Big Bang but that Big Bang was let there be that was the big all science says it came out of one big explosion Dazs explosion of His Holy Word amen and so that evangelist goes out there and he just holds up any book and he says he says do you believe the scientific impossibility that nothing created everything because an atheist says there's no divine creator so an atheist really believes wherever said there'll be a theist and atheist believes that nothing created everything that's what they believe that they're so foolish they believe nothing created everything and when you really go to them into a corner like Richard Dawkins and some of these famous atheists what they actually believe is that some living thing from another dimension mention and created something and that's exactly what God did amen he came out of a dimension that had no time and he came into a different dimension he created and made time matter and space amen see they believe an alien came and brought life in this dimension but that's really what happened God and alien right from another dimension came and created as dimension and that's why we have life today that's right and now I like what the manager says he said so you believe that this book could just have created itself that all of a sudden something started raining down and you know black ink started raining down from the sky and you believe this book and all the Aces say no that niklas that could never happen that by a chance all these are black you know and then colors would fall and all these beautiful pictures you really think this book could create itself and everything could fall in just create beautiful maps like this and the church ages and all the atheist say no and he says I'll give you perfect evidence of creation he said because inside of your every cell of yours is DNA and it's more detailed than the book we read right here amen and so if you don't if if you're foolish to believe a book or create itself then you're a complete fool but we know a book can't create itself we know a book needs a writer and all the DNA and your body needed a writer and that writer was not almighty if our DNA is an instruction book that somebody had to be the creator of that instruction book amen I like that now I didn't do that justice but I had that thought today and I was I was going through these quotes about brother Branham said there'll be a theists the Sun is 93 million miles away from the earth the Earth rotates at a hundred thousand miles per hour on its axis the Earth rotates on the Sun at 63,000 miles per hour and the Sun cents raised at just the right time so it can get here just in perfect time to ripen your tomatoes and your green peppers right on time and there's a scientist scientific principle I forgot what it was I forgot the name of it starts with a a but if if the earth was moved just one degree it was the repeting off the would throw everything off there'd be no life there'd be no nothing and if Earth was moved just one a millionth of an inch or something it would throw everything off in other words whoever created this universe they place it perfectly they created it perfectly it was designed to produce life God knew what he was doing when he placed us here a medic in other words evidence we can't say the evidence proves God but we say evidence points to God and it leaves no other choice either this world wears created itself or a creator created this universe and so only a fool would say well I think it created itself only in person reading a atheon ik would say well the universe created itself nothing created everything but we know God created everything amen I just thought I'd throw that in there praise the Lord now there's a whole I could go through there I didn't have time to get everything I liked in there and I kind of chopped it up but I want you to know Church that we have more evidence for God existence than we've ever had and if you want to find it you just got to dig a little bit and I've got some good books if you'd like to study on that amen now let's move on here so Jesus already tread the winepress himself but it was an oil press and that was good Angus and now to stamp out or tread God's wine press for all those who take the mark of the beast and so yeah I just went over the atheist allusion that's kind of some of the highlights of the atheist delusion video it's a great video now the timing so here's the timing here's the timing of the events of chapter 14 the three angels message go forth first right before the tribulation the lamb in the 144,000 meat during the tribulation and then armed again comes at the end of the tribulation all right so that's the timing of this chapter so if you were if you were to able to take all the verses apart and line them up you'd actually start with the three angels message then you go to the lamb 144,000 and then you go to Armageddon all right now let's go to Revelation chapter 15 here also thanks be a Christian and to be forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ amen revelation 15 now I'm just gonna go scripture by scripture the themes of this book are the seven last plagues the victors over the beasts and the seven golden vials as these are the themes of the book now verse one introduces the seven angels so verse 115 1 and I saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of God that's verse 1 now verses 2 through 4 is the group of victors who got the victory over the beast standing on the sea of glass in heaven who sing the song of Moses they sing the song of Moses and the lamb Jesus Christ this group seems to be not believed this is the 144,000 Israeli believers who will receive Jesus Christ as their Messiah during the Tribulation Period and there's two reasons I believe that this is what I remembered last week I was looking for the harps it was right here the whole time I just didn't see it I think to read two things prove this is 144,000 first is harps second is the song of Moses so let's look at these here verse 2 and I saw I was aware of the sea of glass mingled with fire and then they've gotten victory over the beasts and over his image and the mark over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of God now it just came to me I just realized brother Branham said it's mingled with fire and brother have said that fire represents the fire of the tribulation so this proves this group came out of the Tribulation Period they're singing the song of Moses and they got harps so I believe this is the hundred forty-four thousand verse three and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great marvelous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true of our ways king of saints and brother Jose taught him to about singing to the king tonight so they're singing to the king of saints Jesus Christ who shall not fear thee O Lord and glorify that name for thou art O only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest so let's stop right there now notice they got harps so those harps are also listed in Revelation 14 so this is 15 Revelation 15 speaks of harps and in Revelation 14 they have harps as well that's right now verse so I'm going back to Revelation 14 - if you want to follow along with me so you wrote man said you gotta look at every scripture and then tie it to another so the harps in Revelation 15 connect to the harps in Revelation 14 verse 1 says the 144,000 and verse 2 says and I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of great Thunder and heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps can everybody see that so you have harps in Revelation 15 and harps in Revelation 14 with the 144,000 so I believe this is that 144,000 they're all Mount Zion but now they're up in heaven amen hallelujah and they still got harps praise God they got heart thank the Lord these worshipers of the Lamb now second they got the song of Moses now chapter 5 team they got the song of Moses now concerning the song of Moses the City of Jerusalem is the home of the remnant smoking up in revelation 11 13 in Revelation 12:17 a believing Jews it's the Jews that receive the two witnesses one of which is Moses according to revelation 11 6 so we got your Bibles let's read in revelation 11 6 if you got your Bibles these 100 please this group is singing the song of Moses well Moses was mentioned with a ministry to the Jews in revelation 11 6 and these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will all right everybody that's the Ministry of Moses hope you can it's Moses and Elijah so here this group in Revelation 15 they're up in heaven they got harps harping and they've got the song of Moses it's got to be the 144,000 amen we never see believers singing the song of Moses in the book of Revelation we never see that we see Moses connected to the Jews okay hope that makes sense by God's grace now the chapter concludes with verses 5 through 8 let's read those and we'll go a little bit further here by the grace of Lord revelation 15 5 and after that I looked at me hold the temple the tabernacle the testimony in heaven was open my imagine that heaven gets opened right now we can't see into there but brother one day that's gonna open and they're gonna see directly into heaven man talk about dimensions opening see where all these guys get their ideas it's already written right here in their Baja all these fiction riders you know changing dimensions and opening doors to heaven what they get it they get it from God's Word amen the copied it I wonder if they cited it if not they're plagiarizing verse verse six and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed and pure and light linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels now look at that one of the four beasts I wonder which beast it was I think it was the Eagle beast one of the four beasts the lion ox man or ego I wonder which beast it was which beast gives the vials seven golden vials full of the wrath of God who liveth for ever and ever verse eight and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple to the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled Wow God smoke and God's presence was so great no man could go in there into the heavenly realms there until all these were poured out not what a thought so the timing seems to be really simple in this chapter the timing seems to be you have your victors in heaven worshiping God with the harps and while that's going on you have Armageddon pouring out upon the earth there in verses 1 to 4 I'm sorry verses 5 to 8 5 to 8 would be Armageddon with the seven last plagues alright is that helpful bye great now we're through chapter 14 now we're to chapter 15 I'll just get started on 16 the Lord willing we'll do 16 next Wednesday at the Lord tarries now if you've never seen this that let's look at revelation 16 there's two main themes there are seven vials poured out Revelation 16 and there's also a blessing pronounced by Christ there's two main themes in Revelation 16 now I want you to see here's a good example Church of how brother Branham grew in his understanding how many of you want to grow in your understanding look what program says now look I highlighted it just everybody can catch it 1954 remember he's already preached a year and a half it must've been before 47 when they started recording the sermons he already preached a year and a half straight on the book of Revelation but brother Graham tells us here now he changed this later but he says he's going to preach on the seven church ages now the book of Revelation how it's made up daniel ties in with it isaiah ties in with it all the old testament ties in with it and it's the book of revelation of jesus christ see the book of the revelation of jesus christ and then in there there's the seven churches the seven plagues of seven seals seven trumpets now trumpet represents war a mystery unfolding a plague is what follows every war now here's what he changed later on brother Branham says we're living at the seventh trumpet other words Meldrum saying six trumpets have already passed he says we're living in the seventh plague with RAM saying six plagues have already taken place and the seventh seal to be opened and the seventh vow to be poured out so 1954 brother Branham believed and he changes later but he believed the seventh are the six trumpets the six plagues and the six vials were already poured out upon the earth and that were just waiting for the seventh church hey brother Branham King bro then you and I should be able to grow as well yeah but see this is why I love right here by God help brother ran was so humble he says I he sees seasons I think I can I can prove that we're living in the seventh trumpet this so he believed in 1954 that six trumpets have already been poured out but later we know brother Ram said all the trumpet sound under what seal six seal and the sixth seal doesn't come until after the rapture of the church aren't you glad brother Ram could grow in his understanding and if brother Ram and how did he grow church how'd he grow he humbled himself and he prayed those eight days in a row and that when he when he had the questioned by the air he just waited on the Lord and the Holy Spirit brought the answer each morning each seal before he preached it he said would have made an awful mistake we mentioned that last week until the Holy Spirit came in the room about noon amen all right before the Sun rose the Holy Spirit came to meet me or the angel came and the ball of fire had he said hanging there and my flesh got numb and he showed me the seal in a vision and I spent the rest of the day tracing it out through the concordance to make sure lined up with the Word of God does he at one point he believed all these things that he later taught were for the Israel he believed they'd already happened but by God's help he got straightened out hey yeah if we can only be that humble Church and God help us to do that I believe God will but you know and I know churches that are so rigid they will only take what they believe you try to show them accord outside of that they won't take God's help right because there they won't take any help because they feel like they're so arrogant and smart and proud they know all about it that was in in 54 he said all the plagues have already passed the vowels have already passed all these things have already passed and we're just waiting for the seventh of all of them in 1961 mother may have said he said Daniel seventy weeks has nothing to do with the Gentiles these seven seals seven plague seven woes seven Trump says has not one thing to do the Gentile church will be in glory at that time don't have nothing to do with it the Gentile Church it only deals with Israel Daniel thy people Israel so seven years later he's already got an understanding all these things deal with the Jews the Gentiles don't suffer that I hope we get got to Airy seven years I hope we can look back and say oh by God's help he straightened me out on this by God's help I was able to learn something and not think I knew it all remember on Sunday we preached on that that know-it-all demon the demon that knows all about it can't teach them nothing don't need to seek God anymore cuz they got to all figure it out we don't want to be a self-righteous to Ziya do we well God's blessed me all these years I can I can go to the priests it even though I'm not called by the word I can go into that that's okay God will still forgive me God will still love me well he may forgive you but you're gonna suffer for your arrogance and so I thought it was important in closing to show this how if brother Branham could humble himself and how'd he do it through prayer seeking God studying the word saying God show this show this to me line this up Lord how do these seals work out how does it scripture work out I need to remember he said the seals were greater than any ministry he'd ever had before that that was just seven years later now in 1964 he said I went into prayer I told the wife I'm going in because remember he wondered how come the Lord won't let why can't we get a school or ten to preach these seven trumpets and sincerely I knelt down that's the key right there sincerely kneel down and pray before God to pray and he revealed to me that them seven trumpets sounded under the sixth seal and I've done preachers supernaturally see it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel and we picked it up under the sixth seal and you all who have that how the persecution of the Jews the time of the Gentiles has been this Pentecostal feast amen now I'm going to close with this I stand to our feet brother bran brings out this thought the seven valves are very similar to the ten plagues of Egypt so Lord willing we'll take our time and we'll go through this next Wednesday night or maybe Sunday Lord willing we'll see maybe quite a Mother's Day sermon wouldn't it the vows and the and the plagues for Mother's Day just trying to encourage your mothers keep your children out of the vials you know how do the tribulation that might be something good encouragement but I'll try not to do that by God's grace but member ban tells them in the seven trumpets why are these so similar why are the seven vials and the ten plagues of Egypt so similar he said because in both cases God is calling Israel out of Egypt amen why do those trumpets have to blow why do the vowels have to blow why does all this destruction have to happen because God is calling his people out of their blindness to meet Jesus at Mount Zion amen just like he called Moses in Israel out of Egypt to meet them on Mount Sinai hahaha just like he called him out to meet him about Messiah and there I'm sorry not Mount Zion yeah it is Mount Zion so is he gonna call him out and meet him out on the Mount Zion again amen thank the Lord Oh sir Sinai that's right Sinai Sinai and Zion I keep mixing up forgive me he called him out to meet him on Sinai under Moses and he calls him out to meet Christ on Mount Zion forgive me so the first flag turned water to blood the second and third vial does that the second one frogs I can't find frogs in the in the vials the third ones lice which could not be imitated by Janice and Jambres they can only follow to the first two steps they couldn't follow that third one his third is life the third step the work of grace the fourth the storm of flies the fifth all the cattle died the six they have boils on their flesh in the sixth plague and that's like the first vial grievious sores the seventh vial is thunder hail and fire because it's just like the seventh vial had hail the eighth plague had locusts there's nothing to mention of that the ninth plague had darkness over Egypt and that's like the fifth vial has darkness over the world and the 10th the tenth vial I'm sorry the 10th plague doesn't have a connection because that's the death of the firstborn but I imagine that spiritual death I'd imagine and then destruction in the Battle of Armageddon praise the Lord all right so next time we'll go over more on the mark of the beast and then which of the beasts you love the Lord tonight praise God I hope that was a blessing Malik I want you come up here well we're working our way Church is it a blessing to hear the word of God tonight amen you know church many times these are like warnings and I just thought I would close on that thought about brother Branham being humble enough by the grace of God to grow and I do believe as I preach out on Sunday morning I do believe that's one of the greatest hindrances of the Antichrist fear today is to get people to stop wanting to grow in the grace of God we think oh well we got to be a denomination to be the Antichrist spirit know we can sit right in here and as soon as we say I'm not hungry for any more word you're starting to denominate you're starting to organize when you're starting to take church lightly and not come expecting God to move or we don't come hungry for the things of God we don't come to cloud to say God we need more as soon as that starts happening we start dying we start losing our first love and there's only one way to get it back repentance but there's memory saw on Sunday there's just a short little time period remember the jubilee they just had one year to redeem that back if they did it it's forever state in denomination how many friends do we know that have denominated in their understanding the message and they'll never grow any more they'll never gain a greater understanding they're never humble themselves and grow closer to Christ oh I don't need it I know everything about it I know all about God and I I know the message I can quote it just faster than the preacher that's not what we want Church we want our works to follow us we want the works of righteousness to follow us let's bow our heads for a moment the Bible said in Hebrews 6 10 I will not forget your work and labor of love with your head bowed what work of love have you show toward his name this week amen in that you have ministered to the Saints how have you ministered to the Saints this week this month what work of love are you working for God's people it don't have to be our church it could be you're trying to encourage others from another church but church let's think about that for a moment when you're so in love with price you would have to be loved as people because as people are part of it love it all goes back to that first enough let's pray tonight and let's ask the Lord if we're not in our first love to get back to our first love if we have our first love then let's just rejoice and then say God I need more of you I love you help me to grow by God's help help me to grow the next seven years help me to have a greater understanding I want to know you better I need more of you let's pray tonight Heavenly Father we humble ourselves here today father we don't want to be slung into a lake of fire we don't want to be crushed and smashed and tread upon by the Son of man we don't want to crucify the word we want our will to be crucified hallelujah Jesus we don't want to know it all arrogant sphere we want to be humble your gun we want the love of God in our hearts to work our faith to do the works of God to the Saints thank you Lord for this Word of God here tonight a clear example of seeing a Christian growth a Christian that could lock himself in shut himself in and with the Lord and pray until God you revealed it to them may we be the same not some great shutting away but just each day say lord teach me more about you today or God show me your love help me to follow more in love with you today Lord help me to grow as a Christian help me to crucify my will strengthen me to do the works of ministry to the Saints father used to be a free heart here tonight they they just talked it over with you just for a moment they're not talking to me made they talk to Google maybe the one who knew their strength Lord God maybe they want to get their eyes off other things and get it on you maybe they need to get back to their first love maybe they need to talk it over and say Lord I've been feeding on other things I need to feed on your word or rennet or Jesus and our faith Lord would be strong and Lord that our works would follow us and they'd be works that you would not forget maybe the very works you created us for when you created us in your mind in the mind of Christ Jesus let us do those very works for your great namesake who God thank you lord all by love dear Lord all motivated by love hallelujah Jesus hallelujah [Music] thank you Lord let us start by loving our families do hallelujah let us start by loving our husband or wife our children as we believe they'll be Saints let us start in such simple ways that it's minister to our families to your God and then when we leave our home let us minister to those people love them we're just giving them a word of encouragement give it up a church age book offering prayer for them as we can pray without ceasing dear god help us the minister with the power of love we know you'll help us Lord God we want to be real Christians we don't want to be that army gather there at Jerusalem outside the city trying to fight against the lamb we want to come riding behind the lamb amen a white horse is Lord backing you up although you don't need our backing up dear God but we want to be backing you up standing with you Lord God we know this word is right amen it'll conquer every foe hallelujah it'll stamp out the Antichrist glory thank you Lord but this word stop out the Antichrist spirit that attacks us in Jesus Christ a granite Lord hallelujah Jesus we thank you for your love and mercy in Jesus Christ's name the church said let's get a little round of applause just keep playing that you know had that thought real quick how do you back your first love Jesus told us in revelation 2:5 remember from whence you have fallen remember I used to live up so much higher in God amen and repent and do the first works

some point each person here would say I love you with all my heart I'm keeping the first commandment I love you with all my heart soul mind and strength but Lord there's times and scenes of our lives
