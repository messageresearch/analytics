Jesus will praise your Holy Name thank you though chief you know Saints if you wanna stand for the reading of word just real show where the Lord's been really dealing with me since Wednesday actually the last couple of months he's been really trying to get me to break and I had a real good breakthrough last Wednesday at service God came down on me I know that and I love him more than I ever have before and when that presence comes down it's just you and him all these people if he would choose to come down right now and touch each one of you none of the rest would even matter to any of you it would just be you and the King and when you get into that presence nothing matters it doesn't matter how you act how you think how you it's all worship it's all divine love to the king our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he's real and he right now as Jesus spoke and I believe was John for right now he's still looking for true worshipers that can worship in spirit and in truth not just truth but in spirit as well we could turn to Leviticus 23 15 I don't know if I've taught this here or not before I can't remember but I feel led to teach it today hopefully you guys can get the screen here by God's grace [Music] whiticus 23 verse 15 will read here very quickly by God's grace verse 15 says initio count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that he brought the sheaf of the way of offering seven Sabbath's shall be complete okay even unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days what and that number what that represented what the seven church ages went to Pentecost or to the day of the atonement and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord and verse 17 says and ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tents deals they shall be a fine flour they shall be baked bacon with leaven they are the firstfruits unto the Lord let's bow our heads Deerling father Lord Jesus load we just love you though we thank you for your grace so we thank you for your mercy Lord no we just want to worship you and praise your holy name the name of Jesus Christ Lord your wonderful Lord your merciful lord please be with us Lord strengthen us keep us low God Lord just anoint us Lord God and Lord we just want to give you all the praise and glory Lord God Lord for for Lord we don't want to take anything from what you've done Lord from what you're going to do Lord and from what you're doing or god we just love you lo bless every soul that push their way out Lord though maybe just yield to you Lord Foley God Lord we love you so much Lord jeez Christ amen hey man you may have receipts buy grads grease and today I'd like to teach on by the grace of God a meal fit for God with the subtopic of hidden man huh there's many things prophesied about in the scripture many things that the Bride of Christ is looking forward to the seven seals have been broken they've been revealed but I still believe there's more of this word to open up by God's grace and we won't go far but I just feel led to teach on this by God's grace just want to hit it if we're going back to this here in Leviticus and it goes into the seven Sabbath's and how it represent you'll see as we get to the end of the service or however we however I teach this and more of a teacher Saints by the grace of God he that well do you I'll dial you and what the prophets said but I've wanted to examine this and ye shall bring out of your habitations to wave lows of two-tenths deals and they shall be a fine flour do you see anything mysterious there anything mysterious I'm I'm not talking about right here or right there I'm talking mostly just right here just and you shall bring out of your all out of your habitations to wave lohse of two tenths of deals is there something hidden there is there something that we need to examine that has to be opened up is there is there something strange there I don't know brother Jesse's ever taught on this before amen and you shall bring out of your habitations to wave lows of 210 Steel's is there anything missing here in John 6 verse 48 he says I am the bread of life which come down from heaven that any man hath thereof and not and shall he says and not die right what was he saying here he's I am that Bread of Life how did Jesus Christ become the bread he said I am the bread that come down from heaven Jesus Christ and the old testament was the type of the meal which what the grain would come in and they'd used this special buran dinner to slice every chunk of that of grain exactly the same and that meal typed Christ absolutely and then the Holy Ghost anointed come down looking for Mary one day and said Mary you're gonna have a son named him Jesus and God sent that meal down and placed it within Mary he was not bread then that was not the bread that was the meal it was a type of Christ and as their bread that meal I'm sorry starts to grow and become a man at age thirty now that meal is about ready to become bread but what must the bread how do you make bread you have to have that meal first and the male must be pure it was sinless it was perfect he said that corn of wheat he was that wheat he was that meal yes and John the Prophet goes and says there's the Lamb of God and the Lamb of God the word came to the prophet and the Prophet took this meal and he began to place into the water and then the oil came down and now we have some bread hallelujah yes now we have the word so what would he call that not it's a dough it became dough right and he was not bread then even yet he takes the meal add some water and some oil and you have now the dough how do you make the bread directly after the baptism a water and if the Holy Ghost with that meal of Jesus Christ the Bible said he was led up of the spirit to go what into the desert and he was in fire temptations for 40 days and 40 nights oh yes and that's when he became the bread and he said right here he's not on that bread which came down from heaven a man praise be to God the bread that came down from heaven praise be to God he says your father's did eat manna in the wilderness he says in our dad he says this is the bread which cometh down a man praise God he says I am that Living bread and I remember what fell it was the the manna fell first but then they had to grind it and mix it up and then they made cakes out of that see it was that meal he says I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread and shall live forever and the bread which I give is my flesh which I give for the life of the world a man praise God the Lord Jesus Christ is perfect his award is perfect amen yes I love him love him so much in the Old Testament we had your Tabernacle right here he everything in here was symbolic what of the New Testament church Christians life correct notice we taught earlier on before on the east gate this is the lion gate right here absolutely he says we had to go through that east gate and right here at the entrance of this is the East opening and East opening as well right here in the holiest of Holies that was in the eastern opening one it had to be a lion lion lion anointing absolutely to go all the way through there absolutely and as you go through here you have the altar right here where they did the sacrifices then you head to the the brass slab or where they washed it absolutely we must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why because he was our sacrifice and then as we go beyond now beyond that abreast labra we go into now the holy place correct and then there was three I believe things specifically there's the the candlesticks the seven golden candlesticks there's the altar of incense and then there was a table of shewbread right absolutely he says and thou shalt set the table without the veil and the candlestick over against the table on the side of to hammer towards the south so that was the seven golden candlesticks was on the south part right and remember revelations one that Christ was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and he he held those things right he was in the midst right but notice he says and thou shalt put the table on the north side absolutely the north side is not the east is not the South is not the west but it represents what the north side or the ego side absolutely that food was set on the north because that's where eagles are right there and they must eat this bread absolutely so praise God here's another little picture here showing the what the north side the south side and then right here on the east entering right before you go into the Shekinah glory is that altar of incense which the Prophet broke he said that is the prayers of the saints absolutely we must get down on our knees and really see God and pray not a dry eye confession or dry this it must be with what sighing and crying for the abominations done what in the world know is the abomination is done within the holy city within Israel itself the corruption that was done in that Old Testament God warns them says we have to cry out for our own people jesus said I did not pray for the world he says but I pray for those that was sent for him I praise God we must sign cry for what the last members of this bride a man and also for the foolish words of Jesus and I'll not lose one ha ha yes praise be to God behind the old temple in the veil he says what was behind there what was Jehovah he says he was hiding back there he says what was the the veil hiding oh hi Louise as well as the veil idea was hitting it was hiding the word he says the veil the old badger skins was hidden hiding the word to their eyes natural behind there also was the shewbread if you think about that temple again remember if that if that temp that Tabernacle the inner courtyard the Holy Place the holiest of Holies if that was all hidden to natural Israel see that was a shadow type they would never be able to understand because all of Israel only the priesthood and that priesthood the Levites represented the bride of Jesus Christ absolutely so all of natural Israel would not be able to understand her to go in there and see exactly how it's set up and what it's all about but only the priests would be able to type the bride everything that's why they had doors to everything so the natural Jews would never be able to see behind there also with the shewbread see behind there was a Shekinah glory but was all hid from them it was all hid all the glory of God was right behind that old Badger skin that's right to hide all hid to the natural eye that's right a man he says notice the old temple had in the Shekinah glory in the light of the Shekinah over the word and the word is the seed see it's the green it is the very grain or the meal he says it brought forth the shewbread to believers only so that that table of shewbread that that 12 loaves was only to the what he says to the believers the true believers of the word of God absolutely in his word on the north side the ego side he says the blood also will upon the Covenant the blood is on the water and the water then life life is the grain and the wheat and the seed which is the word absolutely he says and it brought forth the Shekinah glory shined upon the word which brought forth the shewbread and the shewbread was just for a chosen people huh huh that right it was on the north side that table set on the north side by God's grace he says it was and now look what he likens it to what the word of this day he says and it ripe was the shewbread that we feast on and drive across the country for see what was it it was stored up meal stored up food for in due season actually for this time every time you listen within the tapes he said that was the Shubert they were the what the twelve rows represented what the twelve mysteries absolutely absolutely and they were driving across the country for hundreds of miles see it's believers food and just to run the other here as far as I can see but she drives three hours when she gets here she says it's for what its believers hood it's only for a believer remember the shoe grin was for the believer only see Schubert seed notice what it does do he said that she kind of glory over the Schubert kept it from spoiling see so as long as your pastor stays in the presence of the Holy Ghost and stays what in prayer and fasting and supplications and consecrates himself from the Word of God that Holy Ghost cannot dwell and he can now keep this Word of God you'll keep with you and be able to give you unspoiled bread absolutely that's right that Schubert a master and I got this off brother Jesse because he dialed in but these are your 12 mysteries I don't know if really Jesse's harness recently but he says these are twelve pieces of shewbread the 7 parables of the kingdom of heaven Matthew 13 I got these off his website godliness restored to man the mystery of iniquity godhead Israel blindness saints of God can we teach these absolutely we can teach those can we teach these let's just do a Bible study right after service right he says mystery of iniquity absolutely we know what these are we can teach these he says the Godhead is - the sensation translation - body changed we understand we know these the three fold mystery the rapture he says that the New Testament church composed of news Jews and Gentiles absolutely we can understand these things New Testament bride of Jesus Christ the baptism the Holy Ghost the mystery of the Seven Stars the Mystery Babylon and the mystery of God's will what's the hardest one to figure out the mystery of God's will for your life I can do hey sister you understand the serpent seed that's what in the first side of mysteries right there's seven parables can we can understand that we can go right to that parable we can do a Bible study they'll take about two or three hours we can go your verse by verse by verse by verse but I don't know one thing about what God has for your life I have no idea what does my what does God have in store for my life tomorrow I have no idea these things of God that's why we have to get to this but they last Shubert on their table we have to find out what is your calling what are you doing here how much treasure you have stored up in heaven from the life you've lived so far that's far how many souls have we won for Jesus Christ have we been alive or as other or less banal or carbon up it's lamb trimming time we've got to get to the altar lay down and say Lauren do me light me on fire again what is the mystery of your life what is the will for your life what is his will what is his desire what does he want to do with you what is this plan for you well I just go to work and I come home and sit on the couch relax and then go to sleep and I wake up go back to work and so my couch and that all is that is that I mean that's compared to run that back to the scriptures as they were addicted to the Ministry of Jesus Christ and they search daily what are these things we saw a man go back to the book of Acts and see how those original Saints acted a man praise God a man a sister darkus nor there was the most knitting things and making clothes for those people and all these and once she passed it was become a remembrance of God read through what is the mystery of his will why is this so important why is this last one so important we've heard this some thousand times ten thousand times he says now remember this Christ is in the true church is the continuation of the Book of Revelations the book of John the the lion book the book of Matthew no he said that the book of Acts he says but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church to file it making it Luke Ward for empower us it exposes sainted revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the describing of God's Word right down to the tiniest cast like a fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that a people get the true revelation of the true church the revelation of the true church what is the true church we get dressed up come to church on Sunday pull in the parking lot walk in sit down brother gets up there laid songs praise be to God we just love you so much Lord you're so worthy we sing we sing the pastor the preacher gets up there he starts preaching the Word of God we pull on the Word of God and we do these things right and then the song later gets back up there he sees lead songs we say praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus we love you and then we go home is that the true revelation of the true church I thought we were supposed to have power and demonstration y'ever never everything about the two ministries the book of Acts what were the two ministries the book of Acts st. Paul who wrote the majority who God anointed he said I come in the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and the Prophet broke it down he said there was another one running who was a Paulus but nothing was not one sermon or letter of apology he was a mighty in the Word of God he could preach the Word of God like no other tie scripture dovetail I'm sure like a champion listen ed but he was not what we called the book of Acts standard he would preach masterpiece after masterpiece after masterpiece he was such a good minister with the Word of God that the people started exhausting next to Paul and Paul says I come with power and demonstration interesting he knows of the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for that that she can do the greater works and she will be an invincible army this is the will of God for your life how do we do it I don't know but we have to get in our prayer closet what brother will say when I sing that song he says you must pray for revelation more than anything we must to get in the closet and come until he comes down and you start crying out for the Holy Ghost and then he starts to spend what we start getting in communion and as we speak to him in our prayer closets Lord Lord Lord Lord we must then take a break be quiet and see if he'll answer back and the Bible says he will the Bible says he says those that seek me early he says those the ones I love let's get into that prayer closet what was that tent vision it was the prayer closet the Bible says the bride cometh out of the closet why should she come out because she was in there she was gonna die and absolutely was wrong with her husband he was revealing the various things and then when he called she come notice how the world has perverted cause of homosexuality perverted it and they take the most precious thing opportunity promise given to a believers to enter into the prayer closet find God and the world perverts it to the most despicable abomination there was the Ark of Titus we taught on this on the the the forfeiting the seven church ages Titus comes down surrounds Jerusalem and notice what they carry out the Jews forfeited the seven golden candlesticks church age but is that all they forfeited according to this picture we see the seventh - two silver trumpets right there those represent Redemption salvation for the Jews the two the two prophets coming to Israel is that it absolutely not there is your table of shewbread right there the table notice Rome now has control or rules what was the vision what was the image that David dare or I'm sorry that Daniel saw it was that image with the golden head the the silver this the brass and then what has it end up are we still a image still standing absolutely it's iron now iron mixed with clay which is what Romanism who took this this is the Ark of Titus in Rome she's been ruling in the church ages she's trying to stop this she's taking what the table of shewbread which which on it contains what the 12 pieces of shewbread the 12 mysteries of the Word of God they've been in control of that until this day but the Bible said I will restore say it's a little amen that's right Jesus Christ has already come back and restored it the high priest himself had to come back and make up that bread what's more let me tell you bro I got this don't worry about this boom boom boom boom boom boom boom well right there and for the last 50 years people have traveled hundreds and hundreds of miles every service what to catch this shewbread once again amen we proved that absolutely absolutely revelation 17 when upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots abomination of the earth and I saw a woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration and the angel said to me where pieces wherefore did thou marvel why are you so surprised why is this such a mind blow to you he says I will tell thee the mystery woman the Beast that carry the rod which he hath seven heads and ten horns how did this woman get like this how did she become like this what was true remember the brother Graham talked about he's is from that time and how he met that bum on the street and he said he look up there that he had that building he's nice to be president of that Bank right there it all started with one little white lie and then this and they compiled a compound and tweak became a bomb a president of the bank became how did it start and John says how did she get to this position drunken with the blood of the saints what was her original sin and another parable he says spake unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took leaven is what sin right it's unbelief it's leprosy which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened right we've heard this before he says well this is that woman right there this is the Catholic Church right there so now notice it says and she hid that word HIDs me to conceal or to incorporate rate with to hide in to conceal to hide to keep secret notice what did that woman go for she went for the meal she did not go for bread she had the meal the meal that was not mixed with water the meal that was not mixed with oil she went for just the meal she did not go for bread she went for the meal yes brahim has that dream that man beating down that woman beating her down beating her down right the three right I woke up and me to have to dream and I thought how strange that I was I wondered why I dreamed about the woman when suddenly there came and the presence of God became known to me in the perturbation of the dream came from him now to you now you people know that not only I interpreted dreams exactly he says but I have many many times told you what you dreamed so that you could never tell me the woman represents the Church of the world today it says she represents the Church of the world today doesn't even say really the Catholic Church it just says the church in general as a whole I was born right into this mess the mess that she is in she was supposed to be a kind of mother she's the mother of harlots oh my maybe this she says her husband is the denomination's that rule her the three-quarter block is the false trying to baptism unto a trinity see saw her first mistake her first sin was what she switched the true baptism and she put what false doctrine into the Godhead absolutely Satan had to what break the Ten Commandments he says I've got to get him to worship somebody else and Satan the mastermind says let me go back to Matthew in 19 he said look father son Holy Ghost and he incorporated what a person a person a person and they're not equal and now what she has contaminated everything and she deals not the bread just that meal doctrine just the meal remember why will this meal people are believing Trinity dr. baptism now think on this naturally how do you make bread like we said before meal water oil mix it and now we have dough then you bake it right the Bible says in Revelation 6 6 touch not the oil and wine satan head cannot touch the oil in wine but it never said he could not touch the meal so she was allowed to take the Word of God and pervert it now why sister we believe in three gods three persons Trinity and if you accept that into your heart and you start getting into the presence of God and you get baptized I give you false meal you mix that false meal in your heart in your mind with water and then the whole use you actually are serious about this and you try and get into the presence of God and the Holy Ghost comes down and you have dough but when the temptation comes it'll produce eleven bread every time that leavened bread is not the same as the original and Paul said he says they'll turn the people make them twofold the sons of hell yes that's why we must be a word bride if we keep our ears pure and be able to discern good and evil from the pulpit fault keep any false doctrine yes if you're able to discern false true and false doctrine and you get baptized the right way and you get the bathroo the Holy Ghost God will produce the exact same bread he was with you profit continuous said he says she will be a word not a bread bride a word because the most important thing she can do is keep that word that that meal that stuff pure because what he'll do the rest no just give me a baptize in your precious name the name of Jesus Christ another feeling with the Holy Ghost normal Oh make sure give me the strength to keep that meal clean hey man simple but that's how we have to understand it you have to understand what kind of battle we're in right there it is this is not bread but just meal it is not mixed with oil it was not even baked the meal contains the leaven not the oil not the water but notice it says look at the price of this and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny hurt that will not the oil and wine look at the look at that price it's overpriced in order to capture the wealth of the world a measure of wheat for a penny and three barrels three measures of barley for a penny in Roman times our day's wage would buy eight quarts of wheat or twenty four quarts of barley look how overpriced this was four days wage for contaminated meal its GMO if you look on most your candies and food these days this does contain generally modified material here we are the same thing they've been doing all the way and now it's already manifested in the natural absolutely I know it's simple he says imagine bread costing sixteen to twenty dollars for a loaf that's exactly what they're charging let's say you have seven children brother Jesse whoo overtime summer school I'm signing up oh no the Lord will provide yes yes Lord we got opening in the Pipers yes it could be my apprentice praise the Lord sorry to joke Elijah tishbite it was nothing happens of Gilead she said unto the a hab the Lord God of Israel liveth whom I stand and shall not be nor do no rain these years of Co but according to my word correct there's a drought coming a dry time and then he says what he says that came to pass while at the brook dried up because there was been no rain in the land correct now look what he says he says in the word Lord Kingdom saying arise get me to Zarabeth which belongs to Zions while there behold I have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee notice the Catholic Church was one woman but God now sends his main prophet man with power to open heavens and shut heavens and send her to one woman a widow woman he says I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you sustain you sustain thee right and then look at Malachi 4:5 and behold I send you Elijah the prophet same Commission can we identify absolutely but notice the woman what this woman and yell let's move and after race reason God would send his prophet to would his woman place what a place but she must have been a real virtuous woman for God to send his property what does that say about you what kind of woman are you brother-sister Bride of Christ well you in doctor you will you bring Levin into what God's given you will you put your own spin or interpretation on something well it's okay for me to do this sisters or it's okay for me to do this brothers if we kept the meal pure are we living it exactly I'm not talking law I'm talking the law of love amen if you love me you'll keep my Commandments and the ball says he gives the whole against to those that obey Him amen absolutely must keep the meal pure or absolutely he says talk about running around with the world and flirt with the world and then expect to see angels and have miracles done how many testimony is this in the message have you heard brother sister I was I was living so close to God I could feel the presence of God and man an angel came and visited me today I had angel visitations right in my car I was on the job site work and I was just in the presence of God listen to music or listen to a sermon the prophet or this or that or listen to my pastor sermon this man and in an angel came up and talked to me how do I know his angel because truly got done I turned my head and he was gone how many testimonies of that are in the message we have the purest word the cleanest living people the greatest preachers in the world where's our angel visitations I just heard a st. Paul said I've heard and I said I and I really believe you know some things are happening down at this one Church and I really believe it's you know you must live right clean up your house clean up your habits clean up the things of the world get rid of your cards and your worldly associates get ready and then the angel God can speak and say if you're not in design and things will take place I just heard rumors there's children and certain churches going in bands and the message going to watch Star Wars they're out watching movies in the theaters now watching Star Wars running this doing this I'm like what just rumors I don't they're true but I'm hearing these things but it wouldn't surprise me anyhow notice he comes back gets to this woman arrives in getting to xerath which mean longeth his ID and dweller behold I have commanded a woman to sustain him there so he arose and went to xerath and we got he came to the gate of the city behold a woman was there gathering of sticks and he said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink and and and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring I pray the immortal bread in her hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal he says in a barrel and a little oil and a cruse and behold i'm gathering two sticks right we know that represented the cross absolute this all represented the holy ghost and the real representing Christ absolutely then I might go in and desire for me and my son that we may eat it and die we know the story right he said give me make me the cake first and the Provost said put God first in all things sink he first the king of God and his been offence no and his righteousness his clean living everything he died for seek to have that life to produce that same bread what that woman do where'd she started she gathered that meal she took the water the oil started making dough and it was just a dough did she take that dough and give it to the prophet of God no she had to take she had to go back to Calvary is that what you had to go back to camera get those two sticks again down and what they had to die out and lesson don't bake to bread amen but remember when she had already determined it in her mind and in her heart to do these things as she was turning to do this the Word of God came and said that saith the Lord he says the Barrow a lot of families isn't neither were like oil and what'd she do she made three cakes that day and well they all were sustained they all fell right amen because what the woman was able to keep the Word of God notice it was three correct yes absolutely now why is this so Wyatt why am I so why does this this portion of Scripture has done something for me let me show you something see this that is my old Bible when I first come in the message I studied this Bible I heard the Bible I read this Bible and I just got into my married to my wife we got married and the bills just came $1,500 house payment it was when gas was 350 to four dollars a gallon I was paying $900 a month in gas for work $1500 car payment this this this and I sat down after married for just a short time January 19th oh wait not even a year yet we sat down on the couch and all the weight of God is on me I'm sorry all the way to the world I'm sorry is on me how am I gonna sustain this how can I keep going this I was taking every side job possible Lord what am I gonna do and we sat down on the couch and my wife had fallen asleep and I sit there by myself I took my Bible and I was in such a desperation and I don't recommend this I do not recommend this I do not ever don't do this unless you or in their stock I took my Bible I said no I need something and I've never done this sense before after I doing that that's crazy but that day I was in that spot I closed that Bible I see my wife laying there knowing the bills are coming I'm just one tiny five foot three one hundred and thirty five hundred forty five pounds man I Lord I need your help I closed my eyes and I opened that Bible and I go it's crazy I could have revelation 17 it is 18 I was gonna hit but when I opened my eyes Saints for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the Lord sent us the rain upon the earth the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered don't do this so I'm just giving you this is a testimony I had nothing to do with this God guided all 10 of my little fingers and any guy he closed my eyes and he used my saints of God we have nothing to worry about there's rain coming that for the rain restored the 12 rows right here but saints of God we have to be perfected as well amen we have to be produced as bread absolutely and the promise 30 says and the temptation shall come as follows we're gonna be bread alright we're gonna be bread baked down hope I'm not you're taking too long just a little bit longer by the grace of God Genesis 18 1 and the Lord appeared to him the plains of Mamre and he sat in the tent in the door of the heat of the day and he lifted his eyes and looked three men stood by him and he when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground right he says and said my lord mouth off on favor my sight pass not away I pray thee for my servant he says let a little water I pray be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves God came to Abraham amen praise God and I just got a little but you angel they met and these were let the messengers he said the prophet said this is our day as it was the day of Noah as it was in the day of lot but the main man was Abraham when he says Evans days a lot he was pointing to the world remember Abraham was outside of that he was outside that with dwelling with God look now he says and I will fetch thee a morsel bread and cover ye your hearts after that you shall pass on he says for therefore you shall come here sermon said so-and-so do and thou has said right he's gonna do what you do he said and Abram hastened into the tent on the Sarah and now look what the man says to his wife make ready quickly three measures of fine meal and needed and make me cakes on the hearth Abraham did we have a br aham pranam and he had a taking care of a wife of a man as well he said Sarah princess princess he says make me three cakes with fine flour right that meal all that woman had to do was keep that meal pure make sure she got baptized right and she got the Holy Ghost down but was that it that just produced the dough again but God is not coming back for dough he's coming back for bread amen she held the head of far as well amen a Pentecostal time right there the licks of fire come now produced the book of Acts one more time amen we must be baked a man he must break everything out of us all the lemon remember when he baked the earth when guy comes out in birds the earth what he's burning all the sin out of it which is a type of the Holy Ghost we need three fillings of the Holy Ghost to burn it out and stay right there until it's all gone a man need it and make cakes upon your see she had to bake it and then what then the Sun I can pull took place see if we keep the Word of God he says what great things will happen supernatural starts striking the church but we must keep the word and get into where he wants us to be back into communion with Jesus Christ all right so look longer 1st Peter 1:7 the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perishes don't be tried with fire might be found in the praise and honor and the glory at the at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen he says I counseling to buy of me gold tried in the fire was not man's be rich and white raiment did not manage me closed into the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayst see all right why all these trials everything about that why are all these trials we break this down real quick how many trials you got your life sister a lot mine battles constantly constant mine battles it my brother my fourth first mine Judas and my Judas am I gonna turn on you am I am I gonna sell you out am I gonna betray someone why all these trials what is the manifestation sons of God the manifestation of the sons of God is when all power and authority in heaven is now placed on a people and they have to wait for his orders to display this power do we understand what is at that time it'll be back to the spoken word of God you don't have to do a thing all you'll have to do is wait for the leading of Lord speak it'll take place all that power he's restoring us back to Eden right now why are the trials because trials are for learning train up your children in the Lord right why did Jesus Christ about us that Jesus Christ had to suffer so we could learn obedience are you telling me God the Father made his son a perfect man sinless suffer and he didn't make the first Adam why why the first Adam never went through one trial never got sick one time never had this issue never had a mind battle and he was given all the power all the earth to control nature to do whatever he wanted to do but he didn't know what he had and he fell he did not know what he had he was never tried as a son that's why he chose to fall power without character is satanic bring the towel okay that's kind I like over your Bible you know what I mean that's why you're go through everything because when you are bait and you've been tried that power will be given but you must be tested first to see what kind of person you're gonna be will you keep that meal pure job six 21.9 return I pray you let it not be iniquity a return again my righteousness is their iniquity in my tongue he says cannot my taste discern between perverse things when a preacher gets back here he says preaching are they preaching so fast and you're getting into the anointing of it and trying to get his service that you don't even know what they're really saying could that be a trick of the devil I've been in services like that they'll preach and a preaching so fast so fast you can't keep up but then something will say wow that was off and then I pulled then I pulled back from the service while the people are chomping is telling this and this and I'm thinking how do I teach this soft the word and we put our faith in our pastor we believe he's a man of God after we let it let those things down for a little bit and pull on the word get into the spirit because the Bible says we should be he says doth not my ears try Ward seizes and my mouth taste his meat the bread is this leavened bread or is this unleavened bread we should be able to taste the difference by now hey man we call it the taste test absolutely he says for the ear try out the words as the mouth taste us meet a man let me speed up here by the grace of God let's hit that one right right there he said but he that a spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man of all no man right let's speed up here by the grace of God I'm hold you and held you long kind of want to get to where I'm going okay Elijah's ministry I just had to throw a meal into the pot to make it work but it was pure meal now we're back to this scripture here and Luke Leviticus 20 23 15 dealing with the seventh Sabbath's and then you have your two wave flows right notice there was two correct he said now here the Prophet says he says now notice here quickly revelations 9 under 7 the seventh trumpet their King is from the bonds but then in Leviticus now how perfect interpretation with the word because see immediately following the Pentecostal Jubilee followed by the day of an atonement that the order of the feast time between the Pentecostal feast to the torment the sounds of trumpets for the atonement it was to be in the Pentecostal feast the long period of time here there's a long period of time between the Pentecostal feast and that trumpet right so he's going with the he's tying these things together the Pentecostal feast the seven Sabbath's that's what the church ages now let's continue on here cuz I don't want to confuse he says and the seven Sabbath's is the church ages cherish eight years he says the seven church years the church ages get it see now the Jews have been blinding all this time while the Pentecostal firstfruits have been poured out upon the church right so he's now as he said those seven Sabbath's are the church age is correct now I don't see how I'm gonna go here he said now at the end of these seven Sabbath's which have been there was to be the day of atonement the day of atonement at the end these seven Sabbath's seven church ages there's an extra day there 49 days but number 50 is Jubilee there's that extra day he says and there was the day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and the some charms was called the day of mourning back to the sacrifice of atonement and we find out there Israel the seven trumpets pertain only to Israel correct okay let's go here now look what now look what the Prophet says thank God for prophet but perfection has come to the place that the middle person now if there happens to be a Jews here Jew here or somebody that understands the Old Testament prove it let me show you I haven't got the Old Testament with me right now this is the New Testament in the offering of the shewbread that was laying on the kosher plate in the Jewish sacrifice at the cleansing of the tabernacle he says ask any Jew he says all those three pieces bread but we read in the scripture said there was only two but the Prophet says there was three the middle piece was broken he says that was Christ the middle piece was broken Christ and in between showed that there was a there had to be a breaking somewhere for redemption and that piece was considered Redemption on the kosher plate but the scripture only says there was - I want to ask you something especially Jews on the kosher bread at Yom Kippur but then they have atonement he says the scripture only gives to record gives record of two pieces of bread but you know it has it has three and the middle piece is the broken piece the Messiah why did they not recognize the Messiah because it was only for the priests to understand it was a mystery he says what was it told that Jesus he says it was the Messiah what was it that told y'all where to be buried he says not a scripture wrote about it he's dealing now with the unwritten Word of God Leviticus 23 it says - but the prophet says he says by the gift he said there was actually three and the middle one he says was broken hiding what the sacrifice of Christ if this was no they would have never crucified Christ if Satan would have understand it but in the Unruh - why did why did the Old Testament Saints get buried in the promised land what scripture proves it one scripture told able to slay a lamb instead of fruits it was the unwritten word God it was unwritten catch it oma but wasn't the told Abraham to buy a piece of ground where job job when the spirit came home I know my redeemer liveth that last easy to come upon the earth though my skin worms destroy this body and my flesh he was the first this was a court according history this was the first book written down with Jobe he did not help Moses law did not under he did not have Genesis he was not reading from Genesis and Deuteronomy let me get to the dolly saying it just came by a fresh revelation the prophet said it would this end time would be a spiritual revelation not to he said he said not to gross to individuals it's the unwritten Word now let me let me break this down real quick let me showing you how this is gonna work right back right back to where that woman was that planted this Lebanon right go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost so I guess that's good enough let's get rebaptised know where is the name of Jesus in this it was the unwritten word he said it was the unwritten word when they Jesus got baptized it was unto him he just washed him right when John the Baptist was baptizing is it was unto the one that was coming for repentance right but there was no name given there was no name given for that baptism and as now Jesus comes in becomes a big bread and he starts his ministry he says he gives his disciples go two-by-two he sent me says in my name cast out devils so he was training them that that name had power but he never said anything about that name bringing it with the baptism the power of that name with the baptism he left it out but when then now he gives the the the the recipe for baptism he leaves it a mystery an unwritten name but if you understand it was already there they already knew it they just didn't understand until the Holy Ghost came and gave their interpretation he said Sawa has been missing misinterpreted today and say in the name of the father and the name of the son named the Holy Ghost he says it's not even a written in the scripture and to the book of Acts it's in the name of the singular fathers I stumbled upon stat I'm like oh my goodness it was unwritten until Pentecost on what that name was but notice now look what goodness we're getting here look at the days of Abraham he was first Abram and never could have a baby until his name was changed Abraham and Sarah or Sarah Sarah could not have nothing but a dead woman - her name was changed to Sarah Jacob meets the planner deceiver and that's why he did he put the sheepskin on himself and deceived his prophet father take a bride's birthright he put poplar sticks and while her speculums say scared the cattle when they were pregnant with their young and speckled sheep nothing but a deceiver he says until one day he says he became Israel meaning a prince with power a prince with power before God is that right every overcomer Simon was a fisherman when his faith caught and note he was Jesus he said and told me his Messiah told him that who his name was he says he changed his name from Simon to Peter notice all these name changes right name changes the revealing of the name whoa what what in the Peter's name was unwritten it was sorry Simon's Peter something written is actually what Peter right Saul had a good name Saul was a king in one time Israel but Saul didn't fit the Apostle he says it might I'll be all right for a king but now for an apostle so JA so Jesus changed his name from what from Saul to Paul and then he changes Peter James and John's name to the sons of thunder three name changes at one time Simon you'll be called Peter and you two boys brothers sons of thunder name changes right revelations 2:17 he and ear let him hear what the spirit saith churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna remember them twelve law was shoe bread that was in the holy place but if we continue and get into the presence of God behind that curtain now we're curtains ripped though but if we get into the presence of God in that Ark of the Covenant is hidden manna not not all the message here is these twelve mysteries ringing it's preached every Sunday every Wednesday mysteries mysteries mysteries but there is hidden manna for the bride and will give him a white stone and in the white stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god he shall go no more out you know write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down from heaven my god and I will write upon him my new name why did I go through this entire study I was trying to show in Leviticus they had the two wave loaves but as we see through scripture there was always three three cakes three cakes three cakes baked saints of God there's something coming Jesus his name on earth was Redeemer Jesus when he was on earth he was Redeemer that's true but when he conquered death in the hell and overcame them and ascended on high he received a new name the seven seals have been opened there was one Thunder seven seals open over off one thunder right and as that mighty angel he's taking now this open book that the seven seals one Thunder had opened Christ himself the bloody lamb and he's taking this open book and he comes down to earth and land and sea raises his hand and seven more thunders uttered their voices not the same thunder back there seven more thunders and john heard it he heard it and he took it to the grave why because he was the seed form and if he was the if a seed form was able to catch these seven thunders and it was planted and buried there had to be more come up at the end of these ages that would be able to catch these thunders and God told John he says seal him up don't reveal him has it been opened it's open but has it been revealed but when he had conquered death and held overcome and sending the high he received a new name how come we're not seeing the true church in action yet I thought the seven seals or the seven thunders would wake up the bride is she awake is this bride awake is the is the divine love of the Holy Ghost alive around this message I'm talking real love where all these everybody is on the same plane all treated the same and you can feel the presence of God all the time sign was their miracles the Angel visitations but when he conquered death hell and how overcame and sent on high he received a new name that's the reason they'll holler and do what they want he says he says but it'll be revealed in the thunders see had the new name of God been revealed yet both side that's an isolated quote I know absolutely but God said I'll give you a new name there's a lot of scriptures with this out of quotes my pastor is going right over the seven seals and the seven thunders right now and this thing's opening up to to us by the grace of God but it's to him or her that overcometh Jesus Christ overcame in that desert well Stan the only way we'll catch this unwritten word Saints a man went and talked to the Prophet said and the problems talking about the seven thunders he says all he stole a brother branham he says he says I'm sure you're gonna catch this and you're gonna bring it to the people in this net he's it'll probably be probably probably bring another book of the Bible or something he says no he said it'll be right in the Word of God baptized in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost it was already written in the Word of God everything is perfect bring me the two loaves for the atonement already showed three through Abraham and Sarah already showed three through Elijah and the woman with a woman it's already written it's already written in the scriptures already revealed it just needs opened up I'm sorry it's opened up it just needs revealed it'll be revealed in the seven thunders let's bow our heads to your heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord we just love you Lord so much Lord Lord God Lord quicken it into

doubt all the way to Jesus Christ are we need to are where are we where we need to be when I got a touched last Wednesday when I was at work he I could feel his presence for three days still on me during the job walking and I all I had to do is just think a little bit about him and I just start crying his his presence among us when we think on him does our hearts swell up forget about the mysteries him just dying on the cross his sacrifice should be enough remember we have to go back to that atonement that day of atonement is coming here it what it was for the Jews but right before that it's gonna be really close Saints this thing is so close so close between Gentile and Jew the Bride of Christ must be ready for the Jesse as you peel and be encouraged Saints Jesus said he won't
