[22:28] this whole thought theses parallel
[22:29] Joshua tonight by the grace of the Lord
[22:34] okay that's into you would let's go to
[22:38] Ephesians we'll start here at Ephesians
[22:41] first are separate for its provisions
[22:44] for Kevin listen to this series in a
[22:48] while of course I recommend all but many
[22:49] sermons and if you're looking for some
[22:52] listen to enjoy this season's for 422
[23:01] here for mayor I preaches for sermons
[23:04] about the position on the manifestation
[23:07] of sons of God and Ephesians parallels
[23:08] joshua later it was called the adoption
[23:11] series one of the four servants called
[23:13] adoption so we go really like that if
[23:17] you haven't heard at the lab I think
[23:20] I've this is no album now and a real
[23:23] blessing so let's go to Ephesians here
[23:25] on chapter 4 verse 22
[23:42] okay Bursk Laurie 22 23 and 24 of course
[23:50] with this thought we're looking at a
[23:51] type here we're looking at type of the
[23:53] spiritual believer possessing we say the
[23:56] land which is the holy ghost life life
[23:59] filled with the Holy Ghost so verse 22
[24:02] chapter 4 now you put off concerning the
[24:05] former conversation the old man chords
[24:08] that woulda been the man in Egypt ray
[24:10] which is corrupt according to the
[24:12] deceitful lusts and be renewed in the
[24:16] spirit of your mind and that you put on
[24:20] the new man which is I'm sorry which
[24:23] after God is created in righteousness
[24:25] and true holiness praise God so a life
[24:29] of a Christian living in the promised
[24:31] land is a life of true holiness and how
[24:33] many want that tonight by God's grace
[24:35] true holiness let me pray one more time
[24:37] father we love you tonight thank you for
[24:39] this reading that I word bless it to ask
[24:41] Lord God thank you for this gathering
[24:42] for the saints that love you and want to
[24:44] such it's so easy to love your people
[24:46] Lord because they have your spirit in
[24:48] them that's those that are here
[24:49] physically those live streaming minister
[24:52] to your body your bride you know you
[24:54] have that Lord God we just ask and pray
[24:56] you continue to minister to us here
[24:57] tonight in Jesus Christ's name every
[25:00] said in a godless she's beat see their
[25:02] praise the Lord praise God so we're
[25:10] thankful the last Sunday night I
[25:12] preached 47 minutes so I said 45 I only
[25:15] met two over so I'm going to try to do
[25:16] that tonight it just saves my voice I
[25:19] really got to do it because when I do
[25:21] something I will do all the way when I
[25:22] want to preach I want to preach with all
[25:23] my emotions you want to preach with all
[25:25] my body on my voice and that's not good
[25:27] for my voice because I lost it and so I
[25:29] just asking God to give me grace and
[25:31] mercy so I had a good week this week you
[25:33] know I voice seemed to come back but I
[25:35] feel like that's wisdom I got to be able
[25:37] to do it by God's grace and so I'm gonna
[25:40] set the timer here just like that okay
[25:43] alright so glory I hope you've been
[25:46] enjoying the services that goes on
[25:48] wednesday night on the Ephesian
[25:50] series here by the grace of the Lord I'm
[25:52] going to be doing a quite a few quotes
[25:54] tonight out of this message of fees
[25:56] which parallels Josh room from 1960 may
[25:59] 18th I think you'll really enjoy it like
[26:01] I was great so I'm just going to kind of
[26:02] build build off of what brother band set
[26:05] and show the types I'm going to close
[26:07] with Caleb which is a real nice
[26:09] beautiful type there of the believer ok
[26:12] so I'm starting with this quote this is
[26:14] his first quote that I pulled out I
[26:16] wanted to share brother man says before
[26:17] even starts preaching he says Oh God
[26:19] Phyllis freshly with thy spirit and with
[26:23] thy love and goodness so I want to start
[26:25] there because on Wednesday night I
[26:28] showed the three parts of a man body
[26:30] soul spirit and so someone who's already
[26:33] sealed in the soul they as far as I can
[26:35] see I can't see in scripture where you
[26:37] can get sealed again in the soul so when
[26:40] brother man is asking us to Phyllis
[26:41] fresh with the Holy Spirit for those who
[26:43] are born to get he's asking for fresh
[26:45] anointing a cleaning out of the mind
[26:47] that's what he's asking for i believe by
[26:50] scripture and for those who aren't
[26:54] filled with the Holy Ghost guests and
[26:55] ladies asking for a seal the Holy Ghost
[26:57] so I want to just prove that by the
[26:59] scripture now our text tonight is verse
[27:01] 20 or 22 23 24 verse 23 is what i read
[27:08] here and be renewed not be renewed means
[27:10] to make new so be renewed we're in the
[27:14] spirit of your mind be renewed in the
[27:16] spirit of your mind so you can be brand
[27:18] new in your mind how to enjoy that by
[27:20] God's grace I love it you know I'll
[27:22] battle depression sometimes I found
[27:24] depression sometimes I matter now you
[27:25] know a different thoughts about
[27:28] different things you know whether it's
[27:29] lust the flesh prior to life and you
[27:31] just get so we're in your mind right but
[27:33] when the Holy Spirit comes it's like you
[27:35] got a new mind and they clear again you
[27:37] know I've gotta confess my sin or
[27:40] confess this whatever long and you
[27:42] renewed in your mind and that's a great
[27:45] blessing in this day because Satan wants
[27:46] to put anxiousness nervousness like we
[27:49] said depression cares of the world he
[27:51] wants to fill your mind with those
[27:53] things but the Bible said your renewed
[27:55] in the spirit of your mind now sister
[27:57] Jean Paul second billions or 16 this is
[28:00] what we're talking on this morning this
[28:02] is
[28:02] we need the victory in our minds that's
[28:04] where we need the victory for our new
[28:06] sealed in the soul and the battle is or
[28:09] the human spirit a mile for which cause
[28:13] we fake not so we don't give up the
[28:15] cause of Christ but though our outward
[28:17] man perish yet the inward man is renewed
[28:21] how often day by day every day Paul said
[28:25] I die immediately right so aware that
[28:28] when you're seeing by the Holy Ghost
[28:29] praise God you've got God willing in
[28:30] your soul you've got the nature of God
[28:32] quickened and made a live in your soul
[28:34] but your mind is where you need renewed
[28:37] every single day that's where we are
[28:40] getting the victory as Christians we
[28:42] must contend for that victory this
[28:44] square brother have said you can back
[28:45] side every day that's in your mind not
[28:47] your soul your soul never backs lines
[28:49] it's sealed the soul cannot sit remember
[28:52] that from verse John a soul a soul
[28:55] cannot sit on a kind of them chalking it
[28:56] up I don't have it in front of me but it
[28:58] just kind of came to me a Christian
[28:59] cannot sin my mam says in your soul
[29:01] because it's sealed it is the friend
[29:03] it's the nature of the Spirit of God but
[29:05] in your human mind is where you
[29:07] backslide daily now i wanna i want to
[29:13] read this quote this is from communion
[29:15] 1965 i'll be that's my man's last last
[29:18] message okay i want to read this here
[29:22] because it basically says we need a
[29:24] fresh experience every day he says well
[29:27] it's the same thing we find in this
[29:29] message we see it's right we see God
[29:32] vindicates it's right it's perfectly
[29:33] right you're out through here you have
[29:35] to hear continues right can use right
[29:36] everything it says happened just exactly
[29:38] the way he said now we know it's right
[29:40] but see don't do it from an intellectual
[29:43] standpoint if you do you got a second
[29:45] hand of religion we don't want a second
[29:48] hand and religion something that
[29:50] somebody else has experienced and we're
[29:52] living off their testimony the Bible
[29:55] says the message we cannot live off of
[29:57] someone else's testimony we got to have
[29:59] our own testimony hey Corey so we got to
[30:02] be renewed like the scripture said in
[30:04] the spirit of our mind every day so in
[30:07] this message let me say like this we
[30:08] don't want to try to live off a brother
[30:10] branham's experiences although we are
[30:12] blessed by that right his experiences
[30:15] can help us
[30:15] so much what if we just rely on what
[30:18] he's experienced and we don't have any
[30:20] experiences ourselves then it's a second
[30:22] handle religion we must know God was
[30:24] like this we must know Christ in the
[30:26] power of his resurrection amen we
[30:29] ourselves must know it the stories of
[30:31] brother branham of guidance encourages
[30:33] to say my if God gave the victory in his
[30:35] experience than God can us the same in
[30:38] victory in our experiences we can
[30:40] experience the same Living God that he
[30:42] experienced amen so that's what I want
[30:45] to get to that I make sure we want to
[30:46] see God for a testimony of our own every
[30:49] day we must be refreshed and have a
[30:51] testimony that we're experiencing
[30:54] presently with the Lord Amen now let me
[30:58] read this quote this is from adoption
[31:00] part 1by that raw but perhaps that i
[31:03] like to say this the book of Ephesians
[31:06] Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old
[31:10] Testament Joshua he said perfectly
[31:14] parallel so the first time I heard about
[31:17] how is that possible how could a new
[31:19] testament book purposely parallel or
[31:21] perfectly parallel a new testament now
[31:25] here's and I looked at my just happy
[31:27] looking Maya Scofield Bible and here's
[31:30] what Scofield says I wonder brother I've
[31:31] got to stop from there it was the Holy
[31:33] Spirit either way seems to be right
[31:36] Scofield says this there is a close
[31:38] spiritual affinity between Ephesians and
[31:42] Joshua the heavenlies answering and
[31:45] Christian position to Canaan in Israel's
[31:49] experience so a Christian who's sitting
[31:51] in heavenly places baptized with the
[31:53] Holy Ghost is the same thing as a
[31:55] Israelite living and kadens late Lori I
[31:58] like that that's what's going on says
[32:00] here in both so in Canaan and also the
[32:04] Christian experience he says there's
[32:06] conflict even failure but also victory
[32:10] rest and possession amen like that okay
[32:16] so now let's get back to a quote from
[32:18] one branch so you set a perfectly
[32:19] parallel that's what Scofield said in
[32:21] both you have struggles which all set
[32:24] victory possession and promises achieve
[32:26] in both of them all right
[32:31] here's what program says next he says
[32:33] the book of Ephesians to my opinion is
[32:36] one of the greatest books of the new
[32:38] testament a we should preach it the
[32:41] prophets that is one of the greatest
[32:42] books of the new testament i think we
[32:44] ought to greet you he's the lower keep
[32:46] we're on down from chapter 2 we're not
[32:48] quite through in chapter 2 we're about
[32:50] the middle chapter 2 and our teaching we
[32:52] know on scripture by scripture one of
[32:54] the greatest books of the new testament
[32:55] but man says now look here now here's
[32:58] the reason why he gets reason the
[33:01] vesians leaves us on where Calvinism
[33:05] runs out on one limb and our mania nism
[33:09] runs out on the other limb so I'm going
[33:11] to miss play these because these are
[33:12] kind of don't remember I'd be hard to
[33:15] read about what they meet a Madison
[33:17] palmas and runs out there armik
[33:19] arminianism runs out there but Ephesians
[33:22] he says draws it together and
[33:25] positionally places the church all right
[33:29] so who knows what Calvinism is Calvinism
[33:33] is salvation through the works of God
[33:36] only God determined to her salvation so
[33:40] Kyle ISM is like hyper predestination
[33:44] it's all god it's all God God three
[33:47] Destiny's everything and so this is
[33:48] where if you run too far on that just
[33:50] sit back and say why should I go to
[33:51] church and already determine what I'm
[33:54] going to be saved or not why should I
[33:55] obey the Bible guys already notice that
[33:57] I'm gonna be saved or not why should I
[33:59] bring it back the Holy Spirit's already
[34:01] here like they say why should I do that
[34:04] now that's hyper-calvinism right that's
[34:07] that's extreme the other side
[34:09] arminianism is salvation through the
[34:12] works of fan right nan determines their
[34:16] salvation so they'll post scripture says
[34:18] choose you this day whom you will serve
[34:20] it right from Joshua or on the pole a
[34:24] revelation 22 where says believe arm
[34:27] server it says the spirit of brides say
[34:29] column whoever's thirsty let them come
[34:31] and drink of the water supply for you
[34:32] and that's a typer and you can go hyper
[34:35] Arminianism where it's too far it's too
[34:39] much on man's free more agency with this
[34:41] size is too much on God
[34:43] running everything and I don't have a
[34:45] choice on this side but they have said
[34:46] Ephesians get brings it together right
[34:49] down the middle of the road amen so
[34:52] there must be a balance Jesus says no
[34:54] man can come to me except the father
[34:55] draw that's true he said you've not
[34:58] chose to me but I chose to you that's
[35:00] true but Peter said your elect according
[35:03] to God's poured out so God elected you
[35:06] because he knew when she would choose
[35:08] and then the revelation 22 whoever's
[35:10] thirsty let him come let him drink
[35:12] choose from JavaScript shooters you this
[35:14] day whom you will serve so we have
[35:16] scriptures on both sides and that's
[35:18] where Ephesians now those the scriptures
[35:20] are not hyper on either one right if
[35:23] their emphasis on it be gets too hyper
[35:25] so all these scriptures on both sides
[35:28] are right out in the middle it's a
[35:30] combination God did give freedom or
[35:33] agency so man must make a choice but
[35:36] already but God already knows what's
[35:37] going to be chosen so because that he
[35:39] could predetermine the event program
[35:41] says that in this series he talks about
[35:43] that in length all right now here's how
[35:49] I see that in the book of a fiend I've
[35:52] already read this book of Ephesians I
[35:53] took notes on every scripture so here's
[35:57] how asians balances it out in chapter 1
[36:00] the Bible said you are right now in
[36:02] heavenly places so that heavenly places
[36:04] on this calvinism side hi your saw such
[36:07] in heavenly places your way higher other
[36:09] bag your brother Jassi where we're just
[36:11] out there heavenly places my we're so
[36:13] enjoying the things of God it also says
[36:16] in verse for your jokes in Christ before
[36:19] the foundation soil so look at this at
[36:20] all it's on this side of look at God wow
[36:23] we're in God's plan and God has all
[36:26] control over this he does the Bible says
[36:30] in verse 6 of chapter one here accepted
[36:31] the beloved in chapter 5 verse 5 and 11
[36:37] on chapter one you're predestinated it
[36:39] says twice the Bible says in verse 11 of
[36:42] chapter one you have eternal inheritance
[36:43] these are all spiritual blessings out
[36:45] here on God's side but when you turn to
[36:50] chapter four verse 30 it says grieve not
[36:53] the holy spirit so you're in heavenly
[36:56] places you're
[36:57] ohs in a foundational world you've got
[36:59] inheritance my you all these blessings
[37:00] waiting for you in heaven but then he
[37:02] says but don't grieve don't offend the
[37:04] Holy Ghost and so now we start be able
[37:07] to get out see it's going to take these
[37:10] scriptures he can run but look good who
[37:12] cares to be slow to care if you felt
[37:14] adultery that's going to save you anyway
[37:16] who cares you can live with into you
[37:17] people can take it too far i'm not
[37:19] saying Calvin said that but people can
[37:21] take it too far right I'm already in
[37:23] heavenly places like a live hundra what
[37:25] I can smoke and drink are you up but on
[37:27] this side of the man part God says you
[37:31] must not grieve me don't offend me in
[37:34] other words don't sing god forbid that
[37:36] we would say we saw that earlier today
[37:39] ended up I was sending in Ephesians 5 18
[37:43] do not be drunk online which leads to
[37:45] pottery but be filled with the spirit so
[37:47] man has a choice what am I going to fill
[37:49] my life with alcohol offenses sins unto
[37:53] God Paul Paul tells us be filled with
[37:56] the spirit Paul says don't grieve the
[37:59] Holy Spirit so now can you see how Jesus
[38:02] is the great balance of this profession
[38:04] where count as it goes too far our
[38:06] maiden goes too far Ephesians balances
[38:09] are right down the middle you have all
[38:10] these or predestinate a plan about all
[38:13] these promises but then you've also got
[38:15] a duty to live right before the Lord
[38:17] amen glory remember systems for the
[38:20] greatest books in the body the new
[38:23] testimony says now if you if you know
[38:26] the divisions Ephesians is divided up
[38:29] perfectly to show us about Israel it's
[38:32] divided the three basically three parts
[38:34] the first chapter chapter 1 to n to the
[38:39] end of the chapter verse 21 is all about
[38:42] the believers position in Christ there
[38:44] in heavenly places the free testing
[38:46] their chose the mind of God now from
[38:50] check from chapter 1 verse 22 all the
[38:54] way through the end of chapter three is
[38:58] a section all about the body of Christ
[39:01] if you read that and it's all about the
[39:02] body of Christ how we were Gentiles and
[39:04] God brought us in we preach on that on
[39:06] Wednesday night you were
[39:07] sins and how you're quick and unto God
[39:09] so the first part is the first part of
[39:12] Ephesians in three parts just like
[39:14] Israel and that Israel came with the
[39:16] promised land into three parts amen the
[39:19] first part is your heavenly position the
[39:21] second part is your position in the body
[39:23] hey how the body of Christ has the same
[39:26] rights and privileges as Israel the
[39:29] third and final part is your walk and
[39:31] service and warfare as a Christian amen
[39:35] sorry it's got six chapters but it's
[39:38] divided into those three thoughts your
[39:41] position heavenly your position the body
[39:43] so position individually fiction as a
[39:46] body of Gentiles in Christ and then your
[39:48] walk service and warfare has to believe
[39:51] we're to God beautiful and how does it
[39:54] how does the book of Ephesians and it
[39:57] ends by talking about the full armor of
[39:58] God you gotta fight but it starts off I
[40:01] say you're in heavenly places you got
[40:03] eternal inheritance you are totally
[40:05] Chrysler Ford Foundation you are so
[40:07] predestinated but then it ends by saying
[40:09] make sure you fight a man stand up to
[40:12] everyone is satan's temptation save NC
[40:14] so it's a perfect balance right down the
[40:17] middle it's not too much on
[40:19] predestination it's not too much on your
[40:21] work it's right down the middle the road
[40:23] amen let me answer the bride would be
[40:25] right down the road I'll Olivia will be
[40:28] too much I'll devotion will be too much
[40:30] on the election ISM should be right down
[40:31] the middle of the road all right thank
[40:36] you Jesus I love these brother calls
[40:39] these nuggets he said I month of these
[40:41] nuggets okay a paragraph 36 adoption
[40:45] partner but he's in fellowship now
[40:47] kayden does not represent the age of the
[40:50] millennium so when Israel took the
[40:53] promised land Lorenzo's I don't
[40:55] represent the millennium he said it only
[40:58] represents the age of the overcomer the
[41:01] dispensation of overcoming because in
[41:04] Hayden they killed and burned and
[41:07] conquered and took cities and there'll
[41:11] be no death in the Millennium what type
[41:15] of alidium Solomon's tired never there
[41:17] was peace rolla not maybe not even 40
[41:19] years but they had pieces
[41:21] have such a oddest anointing and
[41:23] everything but most glorious time of
[41:24] Israel was the brain of solid years it
[41:26] was like a type of peace but then Davey
[41:30] the promised land was not a type of the
[41:32] millennium because the blending will
[41:33] have no death right no no Wars it's a
[41:37] thousand years of peace so but I said
[41:39] when they take painted it's not the
[41:41] millennium it's actually time of war all
[41:46] right and then if you know the servant
[41:48] brother Ram goes through justification
[41:50] same nation bath as well he goes
[41:52] justification for us was being repenting
[41:56] baptized in water justification for
[41:58] Israel was coming out of Egypt right
[42:01] going through the waters of the Red Sea
[42:02] coming out of Egypt so for
[42:05] sanctification for us is getting our
[42:08] heart and mind ready for holiness
[42:10] getting ready for the Holy Ghost your
[42:12] daily I think uh yeah John Wesley called
[42:15] sanctification cleanliness of heart of
[42:18] mind amen cousin I was his revelation
[42:21] when God we yes we're just fine by faith
[42:24] but now we have telling us a heart a
[42:26] nine-day bad glory and for them that was
[42:30] going through the wilderness following a
[42:32] pillar of fire glory so they filed a
[42:36] thorough fire and God was sanctifying
[42:38] them in the wilderness now the promise
[42:44] and when they cross over Jordan remember
[42:47] how to get circumcised before they cross
[42:49] over Jordan so see let me see like this
[42:51] there's one final act of circumcision
[42:53] before you cross over to that to the
[42:55] Holy Ghost you got any fully circumcised
[42:58] you'll be fully cut off the things of
[43:00] the world yeah fully obey fully
[43:02] surrender the Word of God and then you
[43:05] can cross over to the baptism of the
[43:07] ghost so possessing the Promised Land of
[43:09] Israel was a perfect type of the damn
[43:13] Pentecost glory a baptism of the Holy
[43:15] Ghost they totally crossed over that's
[43:17] her brother BAM peaches paragraph 38 now
[43:20] he asked what is the land promised the
[43:23] New Testament believer but may have said
[43:25] the promise is the Holy Spirit and he
[43:28] goes Joel 228 horror mystery upon all
[43:31] flesh sons and daughters of promise I
[43:32] and they goes acts 2 38 and 39 repent
[43:36] every one of you the name of Jesus
[43:38] Christ to remit to forgive to take away
[43:40] all back trans trespasses all right now
[43:46] look what my dad says next night encodes
[43:48] a scripture from Joshua chapter 3 verse
[43:51] 5 if you got your Bible and Josh her son
[43:53] of the people sanctify yourselves for
[43:56] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[43:58] you so they would not see the wonders of
[44:01] God in their life until they were fully
[44:03] sanctified until they had been
[44:05] circumcised and then they would cross
[44:08] over that was Joshua 35 now brother Ram
[44:11] quotes this in paragraph 39 did you
[44:13] notice Joshua before they cross Jordan
[44:16] Joshua said go through the midst of the
[44:17] camp clean your clothes and sanctify
[44:19] everyone to you and let no man come at
[44:20] his wife with three days you'll see the
[44:22] glory of God see amedisys it's a process
[44:26] of getting ready to inherit the promised
[44:29] amen every promise mean hair is the
[44:33] process praise God we don't we don't
[44:36] want to get our mind like oh we just say
[44:38] one prayer and God is going to God's
[44:40] going to answer our prayer that doesn't
[44:42] happen all the time hardly happens very
[44:44] much God gives us in the process and
[44:47] ready to receive a promise so I like a
[44:49] word process for the better news see
[44:52] it's a process getting ready to inherit
[44:55] the promises and pop
[44:56] three stages again all right Oh dad said
[45:01] there was three stages of the journey
[45:02] and there's three stages of this journey
[45:05] and it goes through the three works of
[45:07] breaks I'm going to move past that
[45:09] because we're familiar with that I got
[45:11] I'm already 25 minutes into it so I got
[45:13] 20 minutes to finish up here so Gloria
[45:15] now here's what I want to get to all
[45:23] right now now he takes him up to Kadesh
[45:27] Barnea which is numbers chapter 13 let's
[45:29] go to the numbers 13 if you got ciabatta
[45:31] numbers chapter 13 now of course this is
[45:38] where people walked away we'd say from
[45:40] going in the promised land boban types
[45:42] us to you know not being born again of
[45:44] the Holy Spirit types it to
[45:45] denominational churches like totem
[45:47] holiness and Nazarene pardon sorry bout
[45:53] that numbers chapter 13 now you
[46:04] the story they go over oh I just seen
[46:09] that in verse 22 and they set it up by
[46:11] the south and came unto Hebron where a
[46:14] high man sheesh I and Tom by the turn of
[46:18] a knock were never on was built seven
[46:21] years before so so in Egypt all right
[46:26] that's the spies ok now the spies come
[46:28] back after 40 days and come back now in
[46:32] verse 26 they show them the fruit of the
[46:34] land they brought back word and now
[46:39] let's go to verse 27 and they told him
[46:41] and said we came under land whither thou
[46:42] sent us us and surely upload with milk
[46:44] and honey and this is the fruit of it
[46:46] nevertheless the people be strong that
[46:49] dwell in the land and the cities are
[46:50] long and very great and moreover we saw
[46:52] the children of anak there the
[46:56] Amalekites well the land of the South
[46:57] the Hittites in the chubby side slammer
[46:59] I explore the mountains and the canines
[47:01] 12 by the sea by the coast of Jordan but
[47:04] they seen all this trouble in the land
[47:06] they were looking so much and now here's
[47:08] what here's the trouble they looked at
[47:10] the battles more they look at the
[47:12] promise right hey look at the evils and
[47:15] the trials that would be in that land
[47:17] more they look at the promise of God
[47:19] praise the Lord so we learn we can't
[47:22] look at the trials or we can't look at
[47:26] the foes that will face we've got a look
[47:29] at the promise of God matter how big the
[47:31] enemy looks a mess i look at the enemy
[47:33] we must look at the promise of god amen
[47:38] let me say like this that's why some
[47:40] people don't get bored again they're
[47:42] like oh I don't want God to take away my
[47:44] my lust thing right because he said this
[47:47] morning I don't have to give up busting
[47:49] I'll have to give up that I don't wanna
[47:50] have to give up that all your turkey
[47:52] just got to wear different clothes your
[47:54] cheek Church teaches no make up your
[47:56] shirty shins no custance where an old
[47:58] movie guard they don't they can't handle
[48:00] the enemies right they don't want to
[48:02] fight those battles right that's right
[48:05] they don't they just can't take the
[48:07] promise they can't believe they don't
[48:09] enemies look too great they don't want
[48:12] the promise of God they don't believe
[48:14] the promise of God yeah
[48:17] I like this diverse 30 and Caleb still
[48:21] the people before Moses said let us go
[48:24] at once and possess it for we are well
[48:27] able to overcome it but the men that
[48:31] went up with him said BP not able to go
[48:33] up against the people for they are
[48:35] stronger than we know they're only
[48:39] looking at ourselves they're not even
[48:41] looking at god that's true those men
[48:43] were physically stronger than Israel but
[48:45] that's not what kayla was looking at
[48:47] caleb wasn't going at god's strength and
[48:48] not their own they then and they brought
[48:51] up an evil report on the land which they
[48:53] had searched into the turn of Israel
[48:55] saying the land through which we had
[48:57] gone to search is a land that keys
[48:59] nothing happens they're up and all the
[49:01] people that we saw in it our men and
[49:03] Greg stench now look this is what these
[49:05] people are saying oh that's going to eat
[49:07] us up that's too hard that's too hard
[49:09] but there's two men I say it's not going
[49:12] to eat me up then those foes are not
[49:15] going to eat me up I'm going to eat them
[49:16] up praise God there's only two out of
[49:20] what those two million that said they're
[49:21] not going to eat me up I'm gonna eat
[49:23] them up by the power of God I'm going to
[49:26] drive him out that's the kind of a
[49:28] Christian that we need to date someone
[49:30] who's got the Holy Ghost said I'm not
[49:31] scared of that battle I overcome I more
[49:34] than able God clonus I can possess the
[49:36] land they met brother have said you
[49:41] should see that's where you Israel not
[49:43] yet received the promise they're on
[49:45] their journey he said that's where even
[49:48] a serene cougar holiness fell because
[49:50] Israel when they come to the spot a
[49:52] penas Barney I despise went over and
[49:54] said the land is great but some of them
[49:57] come back said we can't take it because
[49:58] the cities are wall and so forth he said
[50:01] but Joshua and Caleb stood out so we're
[50:03] more than able to take it but because of
[50:07] their creeds they're signed up document
[50:09] statements they only believed in two
[50:11] works of race justification and
[50:13] sanctification and could not move any
[50:15] farther the whole generation Paris in
[50:18] the wilderness that went over in the
[50:20] promise that had brought back the
[50:21] evidence that was it a good Atlantic
[50:23] look over and says in some of the people
[50:26] going on receiving the Holy Spirit
[50:28] speaking with tongues receiving the
[50:30] power of
[50:31] God the baptism of the holy ghost signs
[50:33] wonders and miracles they felt it would
[50:36] break down their tradition of doctrine
[50:38] and what happened they perished in the
[50:40] land by they perish right up at the land
[50:45] but I said they wouldn't go to the signs
[50:46] wonders and miracles speaking in tongues
[50:48] the power of God they didn't want to
[50:51] fight those battles oh my what help us
[50:53] be able to fight those battles praise
[50:55] the Lord he said this is but the
[50:58] believers McAdam and Joshua outfit like
[51:02] that that was going on to the promise
[51:05] they moved on over into the land and
[51:08] took the land and settle down in the
[51:10] land as the possession and we never
[51:13] stopped at justification sanctification
[51:15] let us go on into the baptism of the
[51:17] Holy Spirit let's not stop at believing
[51:20] on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's
[51:23] not stop because he cleaned us up from a
[51:25] life of sin but now we press on into
[51:28] position a promise of the Baptist with
[51:31] the Holy Ghost he says the promise is
[51:33] unto you your children and to the other
[51:35] than are far off even as many as the
[51:37] Lord our God sir paul amen that's why
[51:41] sometimes hurts me gotta fight for pray
[51:43] for people that they'll be healed right
[51:46] that's why we gotta lose meals we got
[51:48] ass and pray we got to be willing to see
[51:50] our loved ones say to praise to God save
[51:52] their souls we're going to agonize in
[51:54] prayer we gotta cry out to god we have
[51:57] to put effort into it we got a lever in
[52:00] order to see these promises come to pass
[52:02] we got to be willing to fight for it
[52:04] amen there's a lot of unbelief up
[52:08] there's a lot of Jeff junkies I
[52:11] unbeliever Emily dwelling in our land
[52:13] right there's like unbelief and
[52:15] temptations and sins and stares dwelling
[52:18] in this land there is I got 18 minutes
[52:21] left so close with these two things here
[52:25] by God's grace let's look at I want to
[52:32] say this year
[52:36] so thought the Canes me so think about
[52:40] all they've been through think about
[52:42] Egypt think about the wilderness and
[52:45] I'll think about crossing over the
[52:48] Jordan River think about that now after
[52:53] you get the Holy Ghost you cross over
[52:56] Jordan how many believe that you cross
[52:57] over Jordan now then this should kind of
[53:00] struck me loans in there playing
[53:01] studying to this afternoon think about
[53:04] that you've gone through all this
[53:05] process all these years all this process
[53:08] if you're Joshua and Caleb and now God
[53:11] brings you back to the land and you've
[53:13] got a funny in front of you ever thought
[53:15] you did you've got all kinds of alien
[53:18] like sinful inhabitants in your land
[53:21] right and you got to drive them out God
[53:26] brought you all this far and he brings
[53:28] you to a sudden you're cross the river
[53:30] and praise God in the promised land I
[53:32] got the Holy Ghost I've made it and but
[53:35] now you find out it's full of aliens
[53:40] it's full of squatters what do you mean
[53:43] this is our promised land at church
[53:46] that's what we find out we get we repent
[53:48] we get baptized in jesus christ enemy of
[53:50] sanctified we sit in church it and go
[53:52] through the sanctifying process we get
[53:54] boarded in the altar or wherever we
[53:56] sprayed or screaming or shouting their
[53:58] token tons or whatever we did and now
[54:00] we're going to go to god what a
[54:02] wonderful land this is and then you
[54:04] realize you've got all this same laying
[54:06] in your mind and in your flesh is that
[54:08] right sit so much so that paul said o
[54:12] wretched man that I am right o wretched
[54:17] man that I am we just thought we got

[54:22] sweetest thing I'm never going to have a
[54:23] bow it's going to be the most glorious

[55:31] you ain't ready to live until you get
[55:33] the Holy Ghost and then when you get the
[55:35] Holy Ghost then you're just fit to live

[56:23] right that's we got told Josh you'll
[56:25] fight for every little bit right so see
[56:33] what's your boarding
[56:34] only ghosts now that shouldn't be enough
[56:38] I got the only ghost praise God but you
[56:41] should want more and a real believer in
[56:44] those days and today they want to find
[56:47] their god-given position I want to find
[56:49] a place where I'm supposed to live in
[56:51] Christ I want to find the blessings of
[56:54] God for my life my family and my church
[56:58] praise the Lord I just have an
[57:01] experience I'm still today reduction
[57:03] praise God but now that I'm in I don't
[57:05] know exactly where I was supposed to
[57:06] live the mounted on social little the
[57:09] valley i'm supposed to live it wherever
[57:11] God's calling me to beat and I'll
[57:12] inherit all the blessings i want to work
[57:14] the land on the work this the gifts that
[57:16] God has placed in my life amen I want to
[57:19] work in the ministry got placed me I
[57:21] want to be a positionally place son or
[57:24] daughter of God I want to dwell rockland
[57:26] supposed to be I'm just to pick out some
[57:29] outlet hike let me kick them out I'm
[57:32] just the kick-out impacts let me kick
[57:34] them out but there they have possession
[57:36] of what I want possession up amen and so
[57:40] see when someone just gets all the
[57:41] ghosts it's impossible for them to be
[57:43] positioning place because the type is
[57:45] what you get positioning place now it's
[57:47] time for war now it's time to fight off
[57:50] all these enemies until you find your
[57:53] place where God is positionally called
[57:56] you to be let me just scroll down just
[57:59] for a moment brother BAM said yeah
[58:02] brother Alan tells us the purpose of
[58:04] preaching these four servants here's
[58:05] what he said is buried r51 now this is
[58:08] my purpose of doing this the church is
[58:11] always trying to take somebody else's
[58:13] quarter but don't do that you can never
[58:17] raise corn and Ephraim's corner if
[58:20] you're Manasseh my pen you've got to
[58:24] take your place in Christ positionally
[58:28] take it remember the glue it gets deep
[58:32] and rich when we get in here I'll that
[58:35] God puts one of the church to speak with
[58:37] tongues what is what i'm getting at your
[58:39] gifts the gifts of your spear in your
[58:42] life right so he's typing when at or
[58:45] after a planning core which I left strap
[58:48] I can check that out I know Asher put
[58:49] his foot in oil i searched that out
[58:51] levan tongs not that he put his foot in
[58:53] oil and with nothing and that's even in
[58:56] the Bible later on generations would
[58:57] have lots of olive oil and oil you know
[59:00] from Asher's try but he says but we've
[59:05] got it gets deep and rich when you find
[59:07] your gift in your life now we've been
[59:09] through this into we talked many times
[59:11] we all have to speak with tongues that's
[59:13] wrong we all got to do it though we do
[59:14] they didn't do all one thing in the
[59:16] promised land each one was positionally
[59:18] placed Gloria now so what's the purpose
[59:24] of preaching these for sermons we call
[59:25] the adoption series so you don't try to
[59:28] take somebody's house position you can
[59:30] find your position in Christ now let me
[59:35] close with this I got 11 minutes here

[59:39] i need to do i need to have a better
[59:40] sense of self control it's like I said I
[59:43] just pour myself in and I don't think
[59:45] about my body I pray that's the Lord if
[59:47] you bring my voice back I will I will
[59:49] take care of my body better so I'm
[59:50] trying to they're actively do that by
[59:52] God's grace ok let's go to Joshua 14

[1:00:41] told Josh will start dividing the land
[1:00:43] so Harbor sick man the children of Judah
[1:00:45] came unto Joshua yoga and came of a son
[1:00:48] of Jeff Anna the Kenna's Ike said unto
[1:00:52] Him thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[1:00:54] said unto Moses the man of God
[1:00:56] concerning me and v + k dash bar do
[1:01:01] so there was a promise made by God given
[1:01:04] to given de que Ella through Moses a
[1:01:07] promise came through the prophet of God
[1:01:09] from God amen 40 years old was I when
[1:01:14] Moses the servant Lord 17 from Kadesh
[1:01:16] Barnea to spy out the land and I brought
[1:01:18] him word again as it was in my heart
[1:01:20] that's so beautiful amen remember caleb

[1:01:25] Allah head right he's the first one is
[1:01:28] it up and said we can take it we can do
[1:01:30] it it's in my heart God told Moses to

[1:07:01] of Caleb who sent up jeffanddana kenza
[1:07:03] night under this date because that he

[1:07:18] army and you go possess that land he
[1:07:22] said I'm giving you that land now go
[1:07:23] fight for it right so Caleb said I'm
[1:07:27] ready to fight I'm ready to take what's
[1:07:29] mine and that's what we should do that's
[1:07:31] what we are doing right when we pray for

[1:07:51] take their position so he can manifest
[1:07:53] Christ in this area amen petron was in
[1:07:58] Judah in praise so caleb was positioned
[1:08:03] in praise because God was in his heart
[1:08:06] Larry Caleb knew he was asking for a
[1:08:10] fight but he wanted what truly belong to
[1:08:13] him I don't forget my brother Jim
[1:08:14] Shumate came and preached that he said
[1:08:16] people who say Caleb he'll give me my
[1:08:18] mouth but what he was saying was giving
[1:08:19] a fight I'm ready to pray through praise
[1:08:22] God I'm ready to cast down spirits I'm
[1:08:25] ready to go green correction i'm ready
[1:08:27] to receive correction i'm ready to fight
[1:08:30] and battle whatever i must do in order
[1:08:32] to possess the promises God has for my
[1:08:34] life in other words this is my land I
[1:08:37] was ordained to live a victorious
[1:08:39] adopted positionally place Christian
[1:08:42] life and I can live this life in Akron
[1:08:45] Ohio Lord amen I can live this life here
[1:08:49] I was all to live here I was called to
[1:08:51] be an overcomer right here again I can
[1:08:54] drive out whatever I need to in order to
[1:08:57] possess hevron in order to possess the
[1:09:00] promised land for my life and if you
[1:09:04] remember we preach on Abraham Abraham
[1:09:06] built his first altar to the Lord
[1:09:08] injustice 1318 he built it in memory
[1:09:11] which is in what hedron glory so Caleb
[1:09:17] would say listen I'm going back and I'm
[1:09:19] going to possess the land of Abraham my
[1:09:20] father and churches that what we're
[1:09:22] supposed to do we're supposed to be the
[1:09:24] seed of Abraham we're supposed to
[1:09:26] possess the case of our enemies like
[1:09:28] Abraham possess the gates of his enemy
[1:09:30] hey man man reading strength so Abraham
[1:09:36] set up an altar in the strength which
[1:09:39] was in Hevron memory which is in heaven
[1:09:41] and head Rob means communion hell are
[1:09:45] you abraham's first author was in the
[1:09:48] strength of communion and that's where
[1:09:51] hard as for our altars that it's in the
[1:09:54] strength
[1:09:55] communing with God feasting on his word
[1:09:57] walking in the word talking pray in the
[1:10:00] strength of communion I have
[1:10:03] strengthened communion I have I'm in
[1:10:05] memory of chevra and caleb was saying
[1:10:09] either the 12 and the strength of
[1:10:11] communion I'll kick out all the a
[1:10:13] mechanic Kim's because I was called to
[1:10:16] live here i have a seed of Abraham I'll
[1:10:18] possess the gates of my enemies like
[1:10:20] Abraham did amen he said this is my
[1:10:30] purpose lets tame to her feet the church
[1:10:32] is always trying to take somebody else's
[1:10:33] corner you've got to take your place in
[1:10:36] Christ positionally take it right and i
[1:10:40] just finished 45 minutes praise the lord
[1:10:42] amen oh it gets deep and rich how God
[1:10:46] puts one of the church to speak with
[1:10:48] tongues having taught many times that we
[1:10:51] all speak with tongues he said no we
[1:10:54] have to do all the one thing each one
[1:10:56] was called the land was divvied up and
[1:10:58] provided by inspiration praise God now
[1:11:03] let me just shave Sarah few things from
[1:11:04] my heart I appreciate those who come out
[1:11:09] on a Sunday night I really do it means a
[1:11:14] lot to me and tonight I just want to
[1:11:17] close with a little prayer I want to
[1:11:20] pray that God will help us and pray for
[1:11:24] the entire church that we can all find
[1:11:25] our position the body of Christ in the
[1:11:28] past I preach on gifts and things like
[1:11:29] that nice EE that's part of it I simply
[1:11:33] that's part of it and so the thing to do
[1:11:38] is pray I think as you know especially
[1:11:40] as we see you know newcomers coming like
[1:11:42] whether a man and practices brother
[1:11:43] Benjamin different ones like that we can
[1:11:45] see how we're trying to get them if
[1:11:47] they're not born again we can see how
[1:11:48] we're trying to get them to a closer
[1:11:50] walk with the lower and we can look
[1:11:53] around each other and see mine can see
[1:11:54] Loras is truly positioned administered
[1:11:56] by the Holy Spirit on the piano can we
[1:11:58] see that by God's grace for sisters its
[1:12:01] gifts in their lives sometimes it's just
[1:12:03] of course it's gifts the spirit
[1:12:04] sometimes it's mothering I'm absent
[1:12:06] mother bad bass club and
[1:12:08] brother branham I was just a mother I
[1:12:10] never preach the gospel brother man said
[1:12:12] you did exactly what you're supposed to
[1:12:13] do because you do that you said there's
[1:12:16] a place for you over yonder and that's
[1:12:19] my burden as a pastor I want to see
[1:12:21] everybody in the church kick out all the
[1:12:23] inhabitants on their land right all the
[1:12:26] city of the leap out and people possess
[1:12:29] positions in the body I thought was
[1:12:32] interesting sister Karen came to me a
[1:12:34] few months ago that Jeff's we got that
[1:12:35] extra room in the in the room there is
[1:12:38] room in that front pasture study she
[1:12:40] said perhaps it could be a place of
[1:12:42] prayer before service about hallelujah
[1:12:46] that would be a position in the body of
[1:12:48] the church right to pray for the service
[1:12:51] to intercede for the surface like
[1:12:53] yesterday i'm here at the altar come
[1:12:55] here two to three times this is my
[1:12:56] prayer time to pray for the services
[1:12:58] today that's my position preach the word
[1:13:00] that's my position repeat the word of
[1:13:02] God probably there's there some in here
[1:13:05] tonight or there's someone here in our
[1:13:07] church this morning how do you believe
[1:13:08] there's people that need to find a
[1:13:09] position I believe that is when you
[1:13:13] truly find your positions after you get
[1:13:15] the Holy Ghost as you break through all
[1:13:17] the health of wilderness after you cross
[1:13:19] over Jordan now let's take our position
[1:13:23] let's find where's my position in the
[1:13:25] body of Christ what am I what was I born
[1:13:28] to do like my medicine somebody i was
[1:13:30] born in the natural to raise corn I was
[1:13:33] born to put my feet in the oil like a
[1:13:35] she would say actually means happy right
[1:13:38] happy he's got his footing oil of course
[1:13:40] he'd be happy in his footing zone right
[1:13:43] that's he was going to do that but I
[1:13:46] really have a burden I just want to see
[1:13:47] people let me tell you I want to see
[1:13:49] people burden to find that position so
[1:13:51] when they come to church it's important
[1:13:52] that they come to church they're here to
[1:13:55] minister I will get me wrong you're here
[1:13:58] to receive from God of course but how
[1:14:00] about ministering to the Lord how about
[1:14:03] ministering to others that's such an
[1:14:06] important thing the Bible said when you
[1:14:07] pray and fast you minister unto God we
[1:14:11] need people like that that are called of
[1:14:13] God to minister perhaps into that room
[1:14:15] perhaps us up here at the altar I don't
[1:14:17] know we need people that know their
[1:14:19] position know what they're called to do
[1:14:20] Hollywood agree to that by God
[1:14:22] I believe that follow my heart into
[1:14:24] something as a patch I want to keep
[1:14:26] continually reminding the people the
[1:14:29] rapture won't come until what
