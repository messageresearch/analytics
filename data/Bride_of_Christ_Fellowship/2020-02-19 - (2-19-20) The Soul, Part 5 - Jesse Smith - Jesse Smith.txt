right to the Word of God I want to be careful time here by God's grace let's go to John chapter seven like to continue on understanding the so I'll just call it the soul tonight we looked at part four on Sunday night and then I looked to like to look at par five tonight by God's grace John chapter verse 37 familiar scripture here John 7:37 well I'm sorry we got to our memory verse pardon me so let's go to you yeah is this you're not working really it's not working I've got the green light on and everything okay okay so it's not the mic it's that all right thank you yeah I'm sorry so let's go to Revelation 3:20 sorry that's the relation 3:20 [Music] revelation 3:20 praise God is trying to memorize this all right let's read that on three one two three behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me praise the Lord let's go to John 7 then 37 sorry about that I always look at the soul tonight I kind of wanna look at this thought about how the baptism of Holy Ghost could not be given till Jesus was glorified and I'm gonna look at some other examples I don't know I don't have any quotes or slides so case you don't worry about that maybe just pulling up scripture would be good John 7:37 the Bible says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified amen let's have a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just raise our hands to heaven or our hearts to heaven let's ask the Lord to minister to our needs help us tonight father we bow our heads we love you have any father we ask you bless this reading of thy word you're the only one that can interpret it so Lord break it to our hearts and nor let it feed our souls tonight Lord as we saw Lord where we're feeling thirst from both sides nor the flesh and then the soul tonight's the time Lord to feed that thirst in the soul let us pull upon the word believe the word receive the word and Lord let it go to action our lives it's quick it's powerful it's more active than anything Lord it's sharper than a double-edged sword so father let the word of God be quick and powerful in our lives tonight and we thank you for your mercy and grace bless each and every heart in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless your being seated praise God so we like to look at this thought here and continue looking at the soul and I want to just start with John 7 and I got some notes here as I said on Sunday I'm preaching from the chapter I wrote on this already and I think it's really helpful because a lot of it was new to me there are still a scores of Old Testament Scriptures that I want to preach and get through where it talks about the soul specifically about the soul and they would seem confusing without the revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost today and so as we read them Lord willing in the future they'll be able to give us a better understanding because remember you have three parts and you and I in our minds tonight right now in the human spear right where we're conscious were awake right are human spirits active right now are not our subconscious but our conscious is active right now and we feel a thirst if you didn't get enough to eat before service and you're feeling the hunger of your body but if you're satisfied there then then we should feel the the thirst of our soul praise God David had that thirst and he said I thirst for the Living God in the sanctuary of God and so we want to feel that bout by God's grace we want to feel the thirst in the soul and we got to feed that if we don't feed it it becomes quieter and quieter and quieter right just like if you fast or if you don't eat right you know people can go days and days and days and you know my wife was telling me about a woman who was doing it online and fasting for days and days and days just drinking water and it's hard the first few days but after that person got used to it because it gets quiet that that thirst that cry gets quiet and we don't want that to happen in the soul we don't want to miss one day I know there's days we have hard days but we don't want to miss one day where that voice gets a little a little more quiet we don't want that we want to hear that urge oh I need to spend time with the Lord today I need to pray and I need to sing to God I've been doing that more this week I've been singing in my prayer closet and it's been a good encouragement throughout to start the day because David said in the morning you'll hear my song praise God so I've been singing little songs my voice doesn't sound any better in the morning it sounds worse it sounds bad if you think it sounds bad during song meaning boy sounds a lot worse than the morning in the prayer cause but I know in my heart I know God's not looking at that he just wants to hear something from my heart praise God he wants that a burning fire of incense that prayer that song that love and devotion to come up praise God to heaven and so we hear both both tonight we hear or we feel the the cries maybe the flesh but we also hear the thirst or the needs of the soul tonight that nature and we saw on Sunday night that the nature actually directs your way so you look at the last decade of your life or the less whenever you say you got born again that soul well nature should be pointing your direction it should be guiding you and Jesus said if you're born again it'll guide you into all truth so your path or your walk with God should be getting more to the scripture all the time if you're born again because the nature it directs your way it points your way and so that's what we should see in our lives now I want to start there in John 7 again because I think there's full Bible authority to say that John 7 39 it it creates a dividing line between the temporary anointing of the Old Testament which is on the flesh and the spirit only but now we get the permanent anointing in the New Testament and that creates the dividing line because Jesus said or the Bible said it was not yet given till Jesus was glorified so that is the great dividing line once the day of Pentecost come now the believers could have more than a temporary noin ting now they could have a permanent that's what a lot of people still to this day don't understand like I told you there's many different preachers I like I listen to that their teachers but they don't believe the message and I and I'll listen like their thoughts on you know the will of God or the soul of God or different or the covenants of God and I'll get great inspiration but even great men like this that are followed by millions of people even they can't understand that there's three parts to man and even they even they can't understand these words in the Bible that plainly say the New Testament something different the New Testament had to be something more and what it had was more power what I had was more anointing and a permanent increse God that's what the New Testament had that the Old Testament lacked so John 739 says the Holy Ghost is not given till Jesus was glorified acts 1:5 Jesus said you'll receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you praise God he's telling his disciples some of them Peters walked on water already right they've all cast out devils they've all healed the sick they've all gone in the cities and preached he's telling them I'm gonna give you power and when you get that power he said I'll be in Jerusalem and you'll be power you have power to be a witness unto me because before that they would run when it came to being arrested when they were gonna get arrested they would run away and they wouldn't be arrested for the Word of God when Jesus was being arrested but after get they get the Holy Ghost they have the power to stand up and let me say this carefully if God wanted them to be arrested right because not every time to God want them to be arrested remember the Bible said they fleed out of I think Jerusalem right and God was using persecution to drive spread them out right so not every time does God want Christians be arrested sometimes he wants them to escape arrest like member Paul many times was he was kept from being arrested he was kept by being caught by the Jews one time is his nephew helped him to get out of the the castle from the basket right out of the window but then there was times where he did get arrested and it was the will of God and some of those times he got the right part of this Bible that we read tonight by God's grace because all things work together for good to them that love the Lord and then on the day of Pentecost acts 2:4 the Bible said they were all full of the Holy Ghost and began to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance so if you take those three scriptures John 7 39 acts 1:5 and acts 2:4 you can clearly see that the dividing line of the temporary and permanent anointing was on the day of Pentecost now Jesus plainly says this again so go to John 12 23 can you pull it up there acacia John 12 23 so Jesus just could not send the holy ghost so he was glorified in a glorified body John 12:23 now we're gonna read 23 24 and 25 and jesus answered them saying the hours come that the Son of man should be glorified and this is right before his arrest verse 24 verily verily I say to you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and dies what's he speaking of his own death in a bite of the loan but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit next Scripture for he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal praise God so that's beautiful right Jesus saying when I die I'm a seed and I'm gonna rise again amen huh me know you are too when you die when a Christian dies it's like a seed being planted praise God and that seed has to die in rot until it's quick and praise God now we'll get to this later but it's not the seed in it's not the the nucleus of the seat it's the outside that has to die and rot the shell amen praise God it's the shell that's got to die and rot this body right that's the part that Jesus says it's got to die and rot and then when the seed has brought forth when its quicken it becomes so much more beautiful praise God amen hallelujah thank the Lord Jesus saying I've got to die it's almost my time to be glorified praise God now there's two more scriptures that place Jesus's glorification after his resurrection so John 1216 let's read that one there John 1216 earlier in the same chapter now verse these things understood not his disciples at first this is speaking of when when they were saying Hosanna Hosanna in the highest but when Jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him so see there's other scriptures that prove the disciples didn't understand many things Jesus said till after the resurrection so Jesus was not glorified or putting a glorified body till after his resurrection see the Holy Ghost cannot be given till Jesus's body was glorified amen now John 2:22 that says the same thing here John 2:22 John 2:22 can you pull it up there hon thank you when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said praise gods that proves again that Jesus they understood Jesus words after he was raised and in a glorified body there's one more Acts 3:13 I'm gonna give you a good workout tonight acacia your fingers and wrists are gonna get a good workout acts 3:13 here the Bible says that Jesus had already been glorified the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our Fathers hath glorified His Son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go praise God so here the Bible said God glorified His Son Jesus how'd he do it by raising his body from the dead and give him a glorified body that's how he did it praise God thank the Lord now if you would case you pull up Luke 3:16 now Jesus gave the promise he said you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence in acts 1:5 and this is what this is what John the Baptist was talking about he said John answered and sang unto them all I indeed bat you with water but one mightier than I come at that the latchet of whose shoes I'm not worthy to loose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire amen sowhat's which baptism is John talking about the flesh no is he talking about the human spirit no because they already had that remember BES allele remember Micah said I'm full of the Holy Ghost see Jesus had to have a greater baptism than anything John could give what by water and of course anything greater than the Old Testament or else why would we need a New Testament what good is a New Testament the Old Testament already had the Holy Ghost baptism so see it had to be John was saying Jesus is gonna give you a soul baptism you've already got a mind baptism right like Bezalel and Joseph and all the ones we went through on Sunday you've already got that he said but I'm gonna give you a soul baptism now I'll pull up x-15 there Acacia 10 days before the Holy Ghost fell jesus said for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence Amen I love this Jesus is the one who started the doctrine on the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God he's the one those are actually red letter words and your Bible praise God Jesus that other you know some people are so scared to use it especially denominational they don't like to talk about they just talk about people getting saved and baptized in water but Jesus saying I'm giving you more than water baptism I'm giving you a soul baptism I'm gonna baptize your nature with my life amen hallelujah that's what get to next time maybe we're willing next Wednesday it's the nature that needs baptized praise God it's not the flesh the flesh gets baptized and it still corrupts it still dies it's not even the human sphere does get baptized from time to time right our thinking's got to be renewed should get baptized I guess everyday but then it backsides right I was I mean so disappointing the last few years of my life I used to be so zealous I would just love this study right away because in my mind I would love it but in the last year's I get older and tired and sometimes doesn't want to study I used to I used to never have that problem but now I got that problem because I got getting older and getting tired and and my mind is weary maybe I don't rest enough that's probably it but the point is I not I didn't always have that problem it now it's part of something I have to battle but Jesus saying I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a baptism in your soul praise God and this baptism your nature will be quickened by the Spirit of God now that's Bible truth now if you would let's go to Colossians 2:16 now I'm gonna read 16 to 22 Colossians 2:16 2:22 I want to follow up on this I didn't read all of it on Sunday night because I wanted to preserve the time and I'm glad I did because I was really tired this week cuz I had to song Lee both services and preschool services the boy was I tired on Monday Colossians 2:16 so that confirmed to me I need to be careful now Colossians 2:16 I told you I had a good quote I want to read with you so let's read this first here let no man judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or of a new moon or of the Sabbath days now let's stop right there all these are Christian liberties some people eat meat some people don't some people drink wine some people don't I would say no but that's me some people have holier days than others some people are more in the message they're more sincere about Easter than maybe Thanksgiving or maybe Christmas if some people have more respect for certain days the new moon or Sabbath days right some people are real zealous about the Sabbath but those things are shadow of things to come but the body is of Christ now verse then let no man let's go to verse 18 there then no man beguile you of your reward and voluntary humility see they're so humble with the right people can seem so humble and worshipping of angels of the paw even saw people that were so humble maybe Jews here they were so humble supposedly but yet worshipped angels intruding into those things which he have not seen vainly puffed up in his fleshly mine eyes that hum that interesting they got voluntary humility fake humility yet they're puffed up in their minds they just act so humble but if you get on their program sounds like a cat if you pet a cat the right way oh he likes it but if you go against his hair he hates it you go backward against his hair Lauretta that's how that's how it is when you attack certain attacking their doctrine he said in the fleshly mind and not holding the head from which all of the body of joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increase with the increase of God so see they hold up their own Creed's and are their own ideas rather than holding up Christ the word wherefore if you'd be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world why as next verse though living in the world are you subject to ordinances touch not taste not handle not see heirs of Liberty which are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men next verse I'm gonna read this in the whole context you can see it xx yeah which things have indeed a show of wisdom in here's where I want to go will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh now the whole point of that whole thing was to get the context of will worship so worshipping angels or thinking you're more holy because you you know you're taking Easter more seriously or let's say oh it's another day I know message people that celebrate a feast of tabernacles in September and they get real spiritual or the feast of Pentecost in May right piece of Pentecost is in May or they get real spiritual on the feast of Pentecost that's the day the Holy Ghost fell but the Bible says that's that's their own Liberty right but they'll receive the reality is every day should be holy for a Christian now I know there's certain days yeah you might consider a more spiritual but that's fine you got your own liberty but Paul says you know the people that go wrong they worship angels you know they make false commandments and all these things see they have a wisdom in will worship and this means they're worshipping according to their own will right like I believe a common example is like we've seen lately is people that will worship brother Branham or they'll send their ties only to Jeffersonville that's their own will the Bible doesn't say that the Bible says to pay it to the pastor right the fivefold ministry 1st Corinthians 9 says that but see it's their own will and God will let you worship however you will right God's not gonna force you to worship according to the commandments of God he was gonna he's going to offer to you but he as Paul says he lets them worship according to their own will because the will is in the soul that's what I want to say I want to just make that plain your will because Jesus had not my will that's flesh but thy will be done so you're in your human spirit and you got to do either the will the flesh or you got to do the will of the soul right of God's will and you want to do the will of God from your soul but Paul says they would have will worship they worship according to what they want to do now here's the court I want to read from victory day this is what I mentioned on Sunday night biting a chance to read it but man never gives the inside man a chance to explain what is right therefore that's what causes the trouble watch we find if he doesn't do it then what happens we find that his temper like Cain got up see right quit now we better be careful we got tempers he was jealous he didn't like God to offer his to accept Cain or Abel sacrifice instead of his he wanted to go to he wanted his own sacrifice he wanted his own way see now he cuts this fear instead of coming over to Abel and saying oh my brother I'm so happy that God has accepted you now we got away that we know that Jehovah accepts this way because he's proved it by receiving our sacrifice wouldn't that bend the thing to be done instead of that he got jealous now don't you see the same thing today in men it's just his way see now instead of accepting the way that God vindicates to be the truth hey man isla de hija in that beautiful cane should have looked over saw the fire fall and he should have follows knees and said praise God we know how to worship the right way all they got to do is worship like my brother but instead he got mad and he did his own will he said I'm gonna worship with fruit and vegetables because it was will worship right it was his own will that he worship with he should have got happy and searched we should get happy when we see somebody get blessing the Holy Spirit we should get happy and we hear about a church having signs wonders and miracles we should be happy for them praise God if you if you hear a revelation or something like that somebody cares a revelation you should be happy for them not jealous you should be happy praise God that should make you want to say praise God I want to study that out a little bit more I've seen it numerous times over the course of being a message believer here's one example like I'll see brother Donny Reagan talked about the two kinds of the word one was the Rhema of the revelation word and I can't remember the other one well after he preached at church I heard all kinds of different preachers preaching that thought but that's a good thing to do I like that instead of getting mad that you know God gave brother Donnie revelation they they started preaching it and they started enjoying it themselves hey I like that praise God that's a good thing to do if someone gets a revelation say praise the Lord God wanted it for everybody not just for one church but God can use that revelation to encourage other people praise God amen we should be so happy if we see God accepting other worshipers praise God and if our lives are not a worshipping according to the will of God let's get our lives lined up praise God amen like the Bible says if we're a body of believers we should be sad with those who are sad and then but we should rejoice with those who rejoice hallelujah so that was a good thought I really love that quote that's from a Victory Day 63 he should have been happy if someone gets a revelation if someone gets saved we should be happy for them praise God somebody gets the Holy Ghost don't be sad about be happy thank the Lord praise God someone was born again they got a revelation praise God all right now let's pick up next I want to go back to Luke 1 where John the Baptist his mom and dad all got filled with the Holy Ghost but we know that could not have been the soul because Jesus was not yet glorified so I want to go back to that thought cuz I never finished that one now if we weigh those things I believe it was Luke 1:15 I said and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb the Bible said that about John now that could have been in his mind right that could have been on his body but it could not have been on his soul because his sins weren't yet forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was not yet glorified so John the Baptist as a baby could not have been sealed yet because it wasn't given yet because remember Jesus even said he that's least in the kingdom the New Testament is greater than John how many more that scripture every one remember that scripture he that's least in the New Testament is greater than John and Jesus said up to that point nobody greater had been born than John so Jesus wasn't talking about as far as like someone's greater but someone was that nobody whatever they weren't forgiven in the way that we're forgiven by the blood of Christ amen they're under the blood of bulls and goats but we're under the spotless blood of Jesus Christ amen that's what that means not that we're better than John who do you think you're better than John you think you've got the wilderness and live closer to God than John the Baptist I doubt it that's a that's quite a thing it's quite a thing to say that so we have to weigh all these you know Luke chapter one a baby getting the Holy Ghost Elizabeth getting the Holy Ghost Zacharias get the Holy Ghost bezu Leo all Joseph all these ones you gotta weigh them with that dividing line of John 7 39 acts 1:5 and acts 2:38 I'm sorry acts 2:4 sorry and then when you weigh that with that you can see that the Holy Ghost cannot be given until acts 2:4 let's go to Matthew 11 - okay sure Matthew 11 verse 2 this is probably familiar but let's read it again now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples next verse and said unto Him art thou he that should come or do we look for another here is a prophet a man of God right John the Baptist a man of God who saw the Holy Spirit descend and remain on Christ he told his disciples go follow him he's the Messiah he said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world but he gets in prison and because of the probably the beatings and the starvation and the stress of prison life he asked his disciples said goats see Jesus and ask him is he the Messiah or should we look for another so see Church that proves the stress of life the pain and agony and suffering of life sometimes is enough to make a prophet even doubt his experience with God so see know that this and this is important because experiences can never be placed above the word he had experienced he saw it he had experience he baptized God's son he baptized his cousin but he couldn't put experience above the word amen that's what a lot of people do today they put experience above the word well because I went down to the altar and I prayed I know I'm okay with God it's okay that I continue going this direction in my life and it might be the wrong direction well I know my mom was a good person know my dad was a good person I know my brother he's a real man of God so I so I and I've had experience and he told me I was saved and my grandma told me I was filled the Holy Ghost so I must be no you can't put an experience above the Word of God we must line up all of our lives we must examine ourselves to see whether we're in the faith even a prophet could doubt his experience his vision he could doubt his vision as we said with brother Branham he could doubt that the vision was even fulfilled because of the stress and pains of life now remember acts I'm sorry not acts Matthew 7:21 jesus said many so say Lord Lord have we not cast out devils done mighty wonderful works in your name and cheese will say I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so this scripture shows God's anointing is was temporary and that was eventually lost they had the anointing to do miracles but they eventually lost it because they worked iniquity so this proves their anointing was only temporary it wasn't permanent it wasn't in the soul he imagined being so anointed of God in your mind and your body and see miracles let's let's just say they saw people come out of wheelchairs they saw the paralyzed walk they would see that and yet sell that out so they could enjoy the pleasures of this life can you imagine that how awful that would be but it proves that it was just temporary see they'd seen the power of God but let me say like this they'd never been to the cross of Christ they'd never seen that Jesus paid for their sins they saw Jesus power they saw Jesus's might but they never really went to the cross and really never confess their sins like they ought to they never really died out to themselves all the way Hebrews four I'm sorry Hebrews six let's just go over these because again because they're important for us and especially the children I know they need to hear it too Hebrews 6:4 it is him for is it impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing that they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame I what's-what's thus what's striking words once they've crucified the word and they they they walk away from the word despite seeing miracles the Bible said it's impossible for them to come back Hebrews 10:26 we must make sure we constantly stay under God's anointing these are examples of people that get under the anointing just once in a while just at the beginning and they sell it out later and fall away we've got to constantly be under God's anointing these people only wanted a temporary anointing and then they were okay after that they're okay with that living in iniquity continuing to sin 10:26 for if we sin willfully after that we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses so what's the example Moses's people were brought out they were justified they were sanctified brought all the way up to the borderline but then they turn around they said oh we can't take the Holy Ghost we can't be born again and they complained and died and God said they're all dying the wilderness and that's the example we get verse 29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and that done despite unto the spirit of grace not so see this is what this is what I learned I think last year was a fresh revelation to me people can be genuinely genuinely justified and sanctified but then fall away because the Bible said wherewith he was sanctified just like Israel could be genuinely left Egypt and genuinely come up to the promised land but then turn it down they could taste summer they could taste the grapes they could do all they could go over and cross over and taste to those things but they sell it out because they do despite the spirit of grace and again this again highlights how Jesus said if you got the Holy Ghost you'll keep getting more into the Word of God amen Israel did not write those Israelites they did not press into the things of God they just kept going around the same thing same thing that's what I believe is happiness message the same people just keep going over God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet to get our souls born again of the Holy Ghost amen in fact I heard more reports this week of message pastors committing adultery and all kinds of other things like that people that were highly esteemed and all kinds of things Church why does that happen because they get to the they get up to Kadesh Barnea but they don't cross over they don't get born again they truly not die out to sin because if they died out to sin the Holy Spirit would keep them from that if they truly died out God would quicken that seed and that seed would spring forth and it would bring forth new life amen glory see its judgment and fiery indignation for those who only want a temporary noin ting I want more anointing I want my anointing to continue into my 40s I've had it in my 20s I've had my 30s I wanted to continue in my forties amen hallelujah I don't want to see my life get further away I don't want to see me uh.this disagreeing with grace I want to see me obeying grace and God giving me more grace to overcome my trials let's see this group came all the way up and said oh we're not going the Holy Ghost now groups today I'm saying we'll come up and say oh we can't make a rapture we can't have the book of Acts see we don't want that in our church we want believers say we can have the book of Acts we'll keep pressing we'll keep believing we want all God's promises perhaps we're the generation that takes the rapture praise God hallelujah well what you see is a people especially around the message they just get real complacent they don't want to pray no more for the Holy Ghost they want to pray no more for revival they don't want to pray no more for lost souls they want to pray for anything like that they don't want to pray at all I just want to come to church and hear good things and people it's their ears right but see if we are listening to our soul our soul it tells tonight we're thirsting for now to pretend God or historical God we're thirsting for a Living God see that's what David said my soul thirsts for a living God that's why real Christians that our Holy Ghost filled come to church wanting to hear from the Living God amen that's right so see that's how we we understand and that's the temporary anointing people that taste of it but don't continue in it and I know by God's grace you want to continue in it don't you praise God I want to continue in it you want to continue in it by the grace of the Lord now I got a few more minutes here good praise God any time all right now let me go through a couple more examples now got your Bibles here on Sunday I showed how Joseph was filled Holy Ghost bezu Leo Caleb Micah Joshua all these other examples had the Holy Ghost now there was three examples I want to look at again a little more closely let's do Samson and Saul I just want the especially the children to see these now us adults we've read these before but they were really good when I was reading over them I go to judges 16 20 if you would here can you pull out up to education whenever you're ready judges 1620 I want you to notice here humming Oh Samson did mighty works of God mighty he moved in great ways killing thousands we know with just uh with bones right old bones but here's where the holy spirit left Samson and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he woke out of his sleep and said I will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wished not that the Lord was departed from him his man we noted great things let me turn to judges 1325 judges 1325 you're faster than me thank you and the spirit Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between zorah and eshtaol samson was a man who knew the leading of the Holy Spirit next judges 14:6 and the spear Lord came mightily upon him and he ret him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father's mother what he had done so Samson did great miraculous things right he ripped a lion here he rips a lion that roared against him like he'd rent a little kid or a little baby goat or maybe lamb he had such power but when he told a secret right to Delilah the Lord left him because he broke his covenant promise he broke his Nazarite vow now what's extremely sad as judges 16-1 here's another scripture then went Samson to Gaza and there and saw there and harlot and went in unto her and it was told the GAT guy site saying Samson has come thither and they come past come past him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him and Samson late so midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and off and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before have rod look at this Samson goes and commits fornication right lays there till midnight he hears the enemy come in he picks up the gates which we'd say we'd be hundreds if not thousands of pounds and he walks up a hill with hundreds of thousands of pounds and he sits down and he does it by the Spirit of Lord praise God look at that church and then as we saw when he broke the vow of the Spirit of God left him now it's hard for us to understand is how come the Spirit of God didn't leave him when he went in that harlot there but God had a promise as long as he kept those certain things you know anything would stay with him how do we know the Bible says the gifts and callings of God are without repentance the gifts and calling of God are without repentance that's why some of these televangelists can do great miracles right with the anointing and then go do evil things that night with all the money they took from the people right and they got it on tape people it's all over YouTube and the TV and everything but look at this it wasn't the Lord's anointing causing him to go to the prostitute right but see part of it was he didn't have the baptism of the soul where if he had the baptism of the soul he would not have went into a prostitute he would not have married outside the faith right and he would not had a girlfriend named Delilah who was outside the faith because he would have had the power of the Holy Ghost inside of him to be a witness praise God amen a witness in Gaza a witness wherever he went praise God but he lacked that power yet he had a temporary noin ting what if what a striking character Samson is and it's amazing once his hair grew out church all she had to do was say O Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray the only this one so God that I may be at once avenge of his Philistines for my two eyes and God came back and the anointing came back now that ought to teach us a lesson to church if we don't feel the anointing let's humble ourselves ask God to forgive us let's say Lord once more let your anointing come upon me praise God I want to feel your power I want to feel your glory I want to see you move in my life forgive me lord I humble myself and God once more let me feel your anointing come upon my life now let's look at a Saul's life go to first samuel 10 especially want the children to see this so they can understand it first samuel 10 I got verses 1 to 10 that's a whole lot of reading verse 10 first samuel 10 10 and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the Spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied among them remember Saul was head and shoulders above everybody else right they said where's our king he was hiding in the baskets where is our great king our great big man he was hiding from the position that should have been a clue but they called him out they anointed him and then as soon as they anoint him the Spirit of God came upon him and he started prophesying I wonder what his prophesy but he started rebelling against God and an evil spirit came upon him because of his jealousy right he got jealous of David but when David played the harp the evil spirits left so malachi lydia keep playing the piano evil spirits will lead people in the church amen hallelujah keep playing for jesus amen it'll cause evil spirits to leave this place people can find rest for their souls right here praise God after David slew Goliath the evil spirit returned to Saul because he was jealous when dancing women proclaim that David was the better warrior right Saul tried twice to murder David in 1st Samuel 19 but then Church saw and his servants went to Rhema to dispose of David but instead they all prophesied as the Spirit of God came upon them ah a church this is not the kind of Christians we want to be one day where curse and message believers the next day we got the anointing on us we don't want to be that way praise God once one Saturday night were we're doing evil things then Sunday morning praising God with the anointing on us now there's gonna be times - where yeah we might fall short but church we don't want to be that kind of a believer we want to be like brother Anderson we looked at brother Neville he's the same Christian he's just more in love with God all the time every day is the same praise God amen he's got that same testimony just a real faithful servant to Jesus Christ amen in other words if we are born again we shouldn't see these big flip flops in our lives we shouldn't be living it's gonna say like this we shouldn't be living so much outside in the holy place or the outer court we should be living in the Holies of Holies amen oh thank god but see that's what as as time goes on we're seeing more more people bear their fruits right like we said with the message preachers committing adultery or leaving the message or stealing money or hoarding up ties or whatever they would do selfishly greedy as time goes on the seeds are gonna determine what they are right they're gonna be riping right the seeds are coming to fruition it's coming down the wheat and the tares are both maturing we should mature in the Word of God amen hallelujah thank the Lord but seesaw didn't have the soul baptism so he's flip-flopped sometimes he's off sometimes he doesn't want to love God doesn't want to love God's people next time he does next time he doesn't oh my god help us praise God how many want to be a solid believer amen now the flip flopper back and forth from evil things they're good things evil things are good things let's say and the good things the good things of God praise God then all spent almost the rest of his life trying to kill David and chase him down after Rhema God grew weary of saws disobedience taken both his mercy away from Saul and the Kingdom of Israel that's Rita that's familiar to me first Chronicles 1713 yep first Chronicles 1713 we were faster than me hon good yep I will be his father speaking of David and he shall be my son and I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him that was before thee God actually took his mercy away from Saul how did it manifest the way he died God did not let Saul died and mercy right it would look there's an awful death so our obedience will produce God's mercy in our life my Saul was back and forth evil spirits good spirit evil spirits holy spirit evil spirit Holy Spirit we want to be holy spirit all the time praise God 24/7 as much as we can praise God let's walk in the holy spirit now see Christians like Christians will harbor murderous spirits like Saul did in other words let me say that this church we shouldn't hold grudges if we've got grudges and complexes it's our fault it might be a sign we're not born again it's like if we can't control our lust of our eyes or our sexual things like Samson if we can't control our anger and bitterness and relationships like saw these are things that are proving whether we're born again or not if we can flip-flop from sexual sin or evil evil things or a bitterness or anger all these things and then go to the anointing and back and forth some is wrong with that praise God because remember murderers were not inherit the kingdom of God right Saul had a murderous spirit and he would have done it if he could have he tried to throw the javelin Church he imagined a javelin going through that the drywall there I'm gonna kill you David right and preachers do it all the time people sent their congregations and they're basically killing them right they're bashing them and hurting their faith they got a personal conflict with them instead of talking them one-on-one the preachers will do it over the pulpit I know Beatrice has seen that right I know I've seen it preachers instead of talking to people and handling outside the pulpit they they won't talk about outside like Jesus said she said go to them one on one they'll try to take care of it over the pulpit that's wrong that's not how you fight your battles you fight your battles on your knees and you go talk to them one on one like Jesus said and remember the Bible said no fornicator will inherit the kingdom of God so see that's why Samson could do that because he wasn't born again now of course we believe he was saved you know just like we know Saul was saved too but see they couldn't have the permanent anointing because their sins weren't paid for by a perfect spotless lamb the blood of Jesus Christ let's close with David we're real familiar with Bathsheba but let's look at some of these other scriptures here the Bible said God's anointing came on David when Samuel poured the oil on him just like Saul right he pronounced in the next king and David of course was called the man after God's own heart David loved God's anointing and you can read about it all through the Book of Psalms right a lot of the Psalms prophesied of Jesus Christ in Psalm 16 Psalms 22 Psalms 110 the Holy Spirit took David so deep in the anointing that he even said these words my God my God why hast thou forsaken me all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture David never had that David never was forsaken by God David never saw his bones and was pierced David never went through that but he got so anointed by the Holy Spirit he prophesied what Jesus Christ was going to go through a thousand years in the future praise God he got so under that anointing that his words prophesied of God's Son God's Messiah he never went through that that's how great the anointing was upon David David said in 2nd samuel 23:2 the Spirit of the Lord spake by me and His Word was in my tongue 2nd Peter 1 verse 21 said about David and the prophets holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost my that's beautiful praise God he was so devoted to God even under the law the Spirit of God spake by him and he spake thus saith the Lord and wrote hundreds of songs but then we know the awful that he did with Bathsheba a member church the Bible said that his sin with Bathsheba was the one time he turned aside from the commands of God all the days of his life that was the one time that means most of all the other times maybe he was tricked into it but the one time he turned aside the Bible said he despised the commandment of the Lord was with Bathsheba and then your eyes setting up your ride to be lost think about that he said my bone step my bone stare at me he prophesied of Jesus Christ he said my god my god why is that forsaken me so in anointing but then he that anointing left him and he got under the Loess anointing from one extreme to the depths of the other we don't want to flip-flop like that Church all do with all due respect to David probably well well more remand than me and all of us here a man after God's own heart yet he went from that extreme the proper sign of Jesus Christ thousand years before hand to committing adultery and having the woman's husband killed look Church with God's anointing he could have cast down that temptation the Bible said cast down anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God with all that anointing he could have broke out the heart sister Beatrice he could have started playing the harp and he could have cast out on that or later have sent a message of grace he could have had that passion and he could have went and had it with his concubines or his wives he had two options there could seek as God always makes a way out in times of trouble he's faithful he'll always make a way of escape in temptation he had at least two options but yet he he despised those things and he went and took Bathsheba anyway my Nathan said you have despised the commandment of the Lord in second Samuel 12 verse 9 did you know Nathan put the sin of David or the sin of your eyes death on David he says thou has killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon Nathan put it rightly on David and when David repented he said I have sinned against the Lord remember some of the effects remember some of the consequences to this I want to read this because I want our church to know about it because of his sins Nathan said the sword will never depart from your house how many know that he and Bathsheba's first child died and then David's daughter Tamar was raped by her half-brother Amnon who's then murdered by Absalon two years later David's son yeah Davison and then Absalon steals the hearts of the people from his own father forcing his dad in the Exile Absalom then lays with his father's concubines publicly as a divine retribution for David's secret adultery because of that Absalon had public adultery with David's wives because the Bible says whatever you reap that's what you'll so if you reap secret sins then you're gonna so public shame right because jesus said everything that's done in secret he said will be shouted from the rooftops oh god help us to have live pure lives in secret when we're in secret by ourselves god help us to live righteously amen because our secret unconfessed sin if we don't confess it it'll be shown publicly oh god help your people praise God I know he was so faithful and then later his other son Adonai Jia is slain after David dies and AB Solomon has Adonai just slained because he's a traitor God is not mocked whatsoever Manzo's that shall you reap I want to show this especially so the children know this is the consequence of flip-flopping from one anointing to the other amen we got to be like those in the house of stephanas the Bible said they dicted themselves to the ministry of the saints amen in other words we got to be addicted to the Holy Ghost praise God amen now flopping from one anointing to another we've got up a solid testimony all the time we're staying in the Holy Spirit we're living the right life we're being obedient we're walking in the Holy Spirit praise God amen I'm closing in Psalms 51 David said that mighty prayer he said cast me not away from your presence and take not your Holy Spirit from me see just like Samson just like Saul the anointing was on them but then it left on him then it left and we should be able to live longer under God's anointing because we've got it in our souls that's right David's anointing was temporary and he said God restore the joy of my salvation now that the the deep part is that on our minds we need our joy restored right here this is where we need the restoration today restore the me the joy of my salvation right here our soul is sealed right it's got God's anointing but we need it right here we need to remember the blessings of God and have the joy of God and all that God's done for us hallelujah thank to the heart I thank you Jesus remember adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God so Samson was fornicators one of the Herot saw was murders 1 inherit and David's adulterers won't inherit it but see they didn't have access to the Holy Ghost like we have it praise God let's read pull up this lets us stay on our feet and in case you pull up first Peter 1:5 let's just do two more scriptures as we close here first Peter 1:5 look at this beautiful text here tonight I tried to preach just the Howerton I hope that's okay praise God Church who's keeping you tonight whose power is keeping you tonight it's God's power and we are so blessed sister Beatrice that we have access to this power praise God they didn't have access to the sole power in the Old Testament but we have access to it tonight if we want to live above sin we can do it because we have access to it who are kept by what do we kept by the power of God through faith through Revelation unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time who's that word keep means guard who's guarding your soul tonight the Holy Spirit God's power is protecting your soul your nature right so you don't choose the wrong thing you don't go the wrong direction who's keeping you who's guarding you the Holy Spirit hallelujah second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal here's the seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and then everyone that name at the name of Christ depart from iniquity uh-oh yeah 2nd Timothy 2:19 what's the seal of a Christian you depart from iniquity that sound familiar he said depart from me ye workers of iniquity right so the seal of God is we will depart from iniquity hey man look at that man Jesus tells workers of iniquity depart from me he tells Christians depart from iniquity Amen thank the Lord hallelujah that's the Word of God if David had been born again he would have cast down that lust if Samson had been born again he would have never got involved with Delilah he never would've went to that prostitute if Saul had been born again he would happy for David hey can you imagine what could they have done sister brothers what could they have done if they had David and Saul under the anointing what could they have done they could have tore up that place without anointing of the Holy Spirit Jonathan they had Jonathan - hey Jonathan and David and one Accord and Saul one Accord they could have mighty things but they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so what can we do we can save souls for the kingdom of God we know it's fewer and fewer gonna be saved I go that all the time that's true it's that coming to the headstone there's fewer and fewer but we can do a great thing by saving souls from the air of their way that's our desire tonight musicians if you'll come remember that last Scripture Ezekiel 36 27 he said I'm gonna give you a new heart new spirit and my spirit he said my spirit will cause you to keep my commands that's what David was lacking Sampson was lacking saw they were all lacking God's Spirit that would cause them to keep the will of God now this is powerheads every Holy Ghost filled believer knows this is true there's times where you're tempted and you feel like you're gonna do something awful but what causes you to obey it's the Holy Spirit it's the seal of God it's the nature of not in your soul [Music] thanks buddy [Music] or the church [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
