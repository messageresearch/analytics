look at this little thought I don't think ever preaches before I like to look at watchin one of the night and I can look at that program breaches message twice so Isaiah chapter 21 if you got your Bibles there by the grace of the Lord I was reading my Bible and come across I will look at a little bit 33 and then if anyone go this into another night a few weeks ago so I did listen to again this morning I read it actually read it this morning listen to this afternoon by God's grace and I think lesson to your help with the Lord kind of goes with what I'm increasing the last few weeks about begin to be papal to the house of God and all these things and try to warn the people you know Satan is trying to battle the church you know I think it'd be a good message to help us out your grace of the world so let's go to Isaiah chapter 21 and mother ran dry verses 1 to 12 or just the tiniest and I just want to lead at 11 and 12 as a chapter 21 11 12 [Music] the burden of Douma eikhoff to me out of Seir Watchmen one of the night watchmen what of the night watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if ye will inquire inquire ye returned come I go to zto chapter 3 this is where God calls Ezekiel or Watchmen as a prophet first you know watch me report in those days world's technology Zico 3:17 son of man I made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel therefore hear the word in my mouth gives em warning from me when I say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou give us him not warning nor speak this to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turned not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul amen the started for word of Prayer feeling you know your heart just may be known only to God yet as you look at watching what of the night father we love you here tonight over our heads lord thank you for the prayers on end of the short little worship Lord God on a teeny bit horse nor that I thank you for this time here I'll just pray by the holy spirit lord you begin ministering to us in light morning I've just felt that these last few services to give these warnings Lord how important every service is to get our mind and attention back on the word save is battling on every hand to get us thinking and planning everything outside of the word Lord and we were battling distraction traveling his devices before we thank you for this opportunity we can come to your house hear your word for faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God the Lord speak to us here tonight we're grateful for them messages we've heard from your prophet Lord and help us to preach them and live them Lord you said fear not little flock this your father's good we live in the kingdom Lord and I thought of that promise here tonight nor with the key of the scripture Lord in the strong hand of faith I hold on that promise you'll give us the kingdom if we just fear not dear God you think it'll be less of each and every heart and soul that press their way out to the house of the Lord are you just Minister now by your Holy Spirit Jesus Christ knee turned said Amen god bless you'd be in series alone now if I didn't switch over research PC him use my iPhone and I was on without a workout okay all right praise Allah ice cream all right so then I never listen to watch me water the night before later listen okay well so he preaches their two sermons are really short that's why I can get through this morning assessment they're really short service but you know I found out I did a search on it too and the message and he he they'll just hit it you know Ram will hit it just kind of briefly throughout different messages like presuming 62 and some sermons in 1964 so I think you'll like it by the grace of the Lord that's a picture of favor watch and see he's not fall asleep he's at the post of duty praise God want to be how many want a faithful watching in the shop and said that God has them today faithful Watchmen and they're exactly I'm just one of them so we're betting pool that we want to be we all want to be watching right but we all want to be but those who whose God is called to preach the gospel our Watchmen as well watching over flocks and of course you can be a watchman you know on a personal level no doubt about that well you God gives you a word of warning to give to somebody you're watching their lives so let's look at this coffee here I think it will be a blessing to you tonight by God's grace before we go there on a face actually when there is any gospel trumpet the gospel trumpet isn't sounded look at all the enemies are brushed in he don't even hear he's so tired spiritually his eyes aren't even open his eyes aren't open his ears are open to hear Satan coming in to get a flock right he's just unfaithful we don't want that Church do you want to be faithful and I'd be like that fella right there under you right away looking up see if there is any Satan's device that would try to work against our church amen we want to want to be ready we don't want to be unfaithful we want to be faithful praise God so these are the two places he preached it in old objection bill and Lake Park California where preached up so we're going to look at a few highlights but let's turn your Bibles first to Ezekiel 33 we did a sequel three I'll start Ezekiel 33 like I said this noisy Coby came across in my reading I'm still reading through the Book of Ezekiel but I said a few weeks ago came across my reading and I like I always like to preach this on the watchman so if you're 33 goodness thinking at all process of God as we read in chapter 3 but it's just nice to read throughout the world Watchmen were such important workers in those days they were crucial to the survival of a people of a community Seiler City they were absolutely crucial workers so chapter 33 verse 1 again the word Lord came unto me saying son of man speak about people say to them when i bring the sword upon the land if the people the land take a man of their coasts and Senate for their watch I mean all this was coming on us they'll say the Lord told us if when he see the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever hear the sound of a trumpet and take not warning of the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard this out of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul amen I think I had done two verse tonight so if you can that's just a little more verse six but if the Watchmen see the sword cut has blown out the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from his from among them he's taken away in his iniquity but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand so the watchman's got to warn everybody if not the souls are on his hands he's guilty but if he warns them and the people as someone doesn't hear it the Bloods on their own head right verse seven so thou son of man I set the evil watchman unto the house of Israel therefore I shall hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me why does it God just come down and show himself himself would that be enough warning God found out people don't like that so he sent prophets in their place never is really like that they said don't give us God us prophets the people wouldn't listen even if God did come down they still wouldn't listen to him they laugh at his face they market all these things like that so God said I'll just send preachers I'll just send these products and if there's a real believer they'll hear that preached in a time exactly right they wouldn't hear God anyway now verse 8 when I say to the wicked o wicked man and thou shalt surely die if does not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if not one of the wicked of his way to turn from it if you do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity with eyes deliver my soul as you know church if you read through zpo lately it's a lot of warnings against Egypt and you know seer and all these all these kingdoms and Cyrus and all these rulers I mean ever so many warnings it's just a great book reward expen there's in there there's a little bit of hope as well like the dry Oh God promises I'll raise up those dry bones I'll speak life in those dry bones and I'll bring them back to my land amen stick you 144,000 you know the Jews right but also about blackens head unto the bride as well so there's a dual prophecy in there praise God so that's the main scripture that I got for the Watchmen now there's a few where David works with some watchman and come running and watching and see some messengers come running but I don't really get you had to study that so I just want to hit the highlights now on my notes here like I said I took notes because it's a nice short sermon as far as for my timing in this stage in my life but summer is almost here and I can study again or all day where all morning I can study if I like so I'm looking for to that got a little more week of work by yesterday's brother grandma begins with he starts this sermon by telling a story of just a given City a pride of Jewish city and he said what he said I'll watch me that morning had given out an alarm I'm sorry that evening had given out of alarm and he had heard chariots and horses coming from afar so he sounded the alarm he said but nobody took notice of he said women young women God the next morning he said and they were upset with the watchman for his killjoy brother branham said he said the watchman was a killjoy he swelled all their joy their sin that they were having and he said the people don't want someone to take joy or pleasure of sitting on their lives so they said why why do you interrupt our lives and why D we're trying to have fun we're just young we're just trying to live our lives and so what a killjoy that preacher is doesn't snore you can listen to you really like it and they don't the washroom was trying to take all the joy out of their lives for the rhythm set in that like today preacher preach really hard you're just trying you're just upset at us just trying to make our lives joyless well let me tell you if you ever came to the press of Jesus Christ you'd be so full of Joey be so full of love and power and forgiveness and you'd feel so great the trouble is they're scared of this presence they won't confess their sins they won't humble themselves and will pray for others it won't come in his presence the thing is they went to the world for joy rather than Jesus hey man I'm glad to say I've come to Christ and I know what it means that joy unspeakable full of glory I know that needs amen it's exactly right but RAM said they walked around saying oh we got a strong army enough even if even if somebody does come we've got a strong we got the best start so then take heed of the warning and he said we can go ahead enjoy our gambling to go gamble with the soldiers he said have some drinks he said if there really was a some chariots coming our priests and rabbis would tell us it but instead we just got the watchman only so even though even though creatures weren't telling them about the warning just the Watchmen I'm going to make it set to a profit how then there yet but that's that's a true picture of our nation today they've just gone wild they refuse the warning when the true Watchmen gives a warning he's usually classed as a fanatic that's right when's the program classes a fanatic today is no church considered a fanatic Church absolutely let me I'm said now I wrote this time I'm trying to go around bricks and he just injects a thought here about how God always gives a warning before judgment and you know but I have preset in late 1963 future whole sermon on that God always gets a warning before he judges somebody and that scripture because the revelation to God told that fact here in church age which we'll get to in a few of services here he said he told Jess how he said I gave you space to repent but you repented not and if God got Jezebel the lowest of all women spacer head I know that's the spirit in the New Testament instead that but he also gave her space to repent the Old Testament and she repented not and if God even gives her space he's got to give everybody's face repent because he's paid for his merciful he's just he's fair so when I gave examples what we have said his father when he was getting close to death he said he wanted to go back to the homeland to go back to his home place in his known place he come back home and his brother brother Brad was Uncle in other words it had something on his heart to come see his dad but Graham's dad and he said while they were talking his dad had a heart attack and eventually died so he CEO feeling like I'm going home I want to go back to your home life I want to go back to where I was born the man said even his dad was born of that then wrote and said his father-in-law meet us dad I had a feeling to go out and go to the go hunting him and invited brother Brandon rubber have couldn't go and so he said he was out hunting now this was just in 1958 and he heard his mother who was already dead saying Oh Frankie Oh Frankie you're coming home soon so that night brother grandfather bought amita's but dad came into the church program said he sat the second row on the left side I could picture my mind at the tabernacle time in the town at one time and testified that night about that experience and said church pray for me and program said we buried in just a few days later he was sorry to hear from the other dimension right you get a full like all going over I feel God gives every man and woman a warning before they go yes to yes to be just yes to give them a chance to make a right everyone kind of said he does that because God is so loving and merciful he always gives a warning so my bap said what does this mother said God's goodness and His grace does this and he gives the true and heart a warning of the things that are approaching aren't you glad God's merciful to us it warned us of repairs even brother remember when he uh when he whatever when he was going to have that test and Satan was going to test him in the Holy Spirit warns that you got a test be careful and it was two young people kissing it is audience distracting the people bro Graham could have cursed them right but the Holy Spirit said speak forgiveness to them remember that and as a great test where he had to overcome Kirsten have in order to be a mercy to them there's the other test where the preachers running quarter him on the Serpent's seat and God showed him beforehand I forget the preacher his name but it was up and showed it beforehand they were going to change the rooms and each person would be sitting there and brother Brad was warned ahead of time and thought of that and he said 400 preachers wanted all the tapes on water baptism after that not enough never got that but the point I'm giving you is that God gives warnings if we can hear his voice and that's why we come to church that's why we pray we want to hear God's voice amen you want to hear the warning now after that whether I'm jumps back to his story of the city this Jewish city no matter they did not care what the watchman had to say they spend their time in the taverns that day soldiers drinking he said the spirit of whiskey they had all these things he said but because they refused the warning Conrad said in a few hours the chariots of the horses came rushing through the gates and overtook the city he says giving like a fictional store and what it might be like to reject the warning of a true option and then program goes into the duties of a watchman he said a watchman must be selected he must be alert to the heavenly bodies in the sky but man said people would get up in the middle night and kind of walk around the city as they watching what is the night what time is it and the watcher would look up and see well this time at this time you see anything in the stars this guy with nothing unusual tonight romancey was shot it down they go back to their sleep and go back to whoever they would and he said he said I wonder he said I wonder if we should call out to our watchman today because the whole world seems to be shaking another day yet McMansion the washington had to be on duty at all times of the night he was to warn the people of approaching danger he was up in its high tower that's higher than the walls he had books of astronomy the tower to study see he was studying at good books up there by God's grace he was studying books that others maybe would study and that's what we you and I should be doing studying the books hallelujah he said he can watch the stars until the time he could see the way further than other men because he was up higher he could see better Aram said to those who were earthbound and just stayed on the earth that didn't climb up into the higher spheres of every one o'clock and the higher spheres of God brother Branham says the higher you climb in God the more sinful this world looks then the cussing looks worse the movies look worse the movies will look worse the makeup the adultery the pornography the higher you getting God the worse it looks eventually you ever get those fears it looks worse the higher you get so see when we start getting loose warts inner not thinking that's bad what have we gone we've come down rather going up I say let's go back up and nothing does that like a good service in God's presence a man a good prayer time a good preaching time a good worship in time nothing does like that than getting in the presence of God amen but after Isaiah was God's watchman and God like in his watchman of the prophets because he says Eagles are built special for their oath altitude he said God special designed the eagle but as if God still has evils on the power today who climb in the spirit above all scientific research yes men specially designed for had they stand by the brothers said they don't stand on the tower he said they stand up on top of the cross he says and they send the message back with Gus save the Lord in grandmas that's our power today the cross of Christ internet so we stand on the cross and look out and see at the danger that's coming hallelujah but man said their sight is far beyond the ordinary man in the regular walk of life member ramdux attorney says let's turn our attention to the king of the tower watchers the mansion is the Lord Jesus himself on earth and he knows I was going into Jesus being prophetic on earth Jesus spake more of his second coming then he did his first coming of you know that remember of John chapter 14 chapters 14 because Judas leaves in 13 right the the their communion where Judas left 14 15 and 16 Jesus tells all about a second coming how do you know that Matthew 24 Luke said t he spent a much of his second pole ministry I don't understand that yet repose the first pole of the miracles second pole was the prophesied third pole was after the resurrection he of course and he preached after the crucifixion he preached eternal loss and the ministry after the resurrection we understand that so in his second pole he was prophesied for telling about his second company that his first coming he was already here he was already here you did have to deal with that so much he was already foretelling getting the people ready everybody said why because he's the king of the locksmith and there he is he's looking in the future saying this is what it's going to be like at the second coming make ready praise God he's already in the watchtower there as the son of God more telling what he sees 2,000 years old in 2017 amen he sees the latest in church age but he said if you have eyes to see have gold tried in the fire keep your life hot on fire that's what the watcher would say tonight say on fire for Jesus amen Olivia oh man said see he already been prophetic a little bit he said he prophesied of things I would take place he said he talked about his crucifixion foretold that he talked about his resurrection on the third day at David's prophecy that his soul would not be left in hell and his body would not see corruption well then said the Jesus knew no power could keep him in the grave he knew every word of God will be fulfilled in his season Amen Lord everyone said but Jesus had a question it's going to it's going to look 18 if you got your Bibles but man said hey this is the exact scripture brother end quote go to Luke 18 I believe it's Luke 18 just going from my memories I have the scripture try look it up yeah that's it yeah Luke 18:1 well dad said this is Jesus's question as a watchman he's looking out no man said as king of the tower Watchers this is Jesus question we'll just read it up cuz you know you know the story verse 8 18 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the Son of man cometh shall we find faith on the earth everybody said that's the Jesus at the king of the tower Watchers looking out and see the thing he's looking for prophetically is who will have faith on earth when I return what is faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things you don't see we don't see the rapture going off but if you got paid for it you've already got the rapture inside of you then praise God because faith is the evidence that you can already see the rapture that you're a part of it you have to have faith for the rapture packets called rap Street based on an idiot that's what it's called it's called the laterade rapturing faith but this was the watch man Christ this was this question program said will there are you people at the end that will believe and of course the answer is yes would it be a small group because he said you they're unified it and I was short in the days that even the elect would be saved because it's going to be so wicked and so evil exactly right praise the Lord and buy medicine how do you get paid for this rapture he said coming here the Word of God you can hear him say right on the right of the tape you coming tonight those life streaming that are really listening to the things of God where they want they want to have faith when Jesus returns they want to really want to hear the voice of the watchman Christ Jesus and they want to add what he is required he's requiring faith which is this inward evidence the substance that we need to go on the rapture in a night then boom M says then we can look in the Bible and find the very things that the watchman foretold which were signs and wonders men's hearts failing for fear this is Matthew 24 distress between nations that we gotta still North Korea all this distress I ran all these others distressed fearful sights in the sky earthquakes in divers places and atomic weapons program tells a story I mean he met an army army man who was going for his major he called it a rank major he's on the rank in the army his name was Julius stud static that is the army or very nothing Bowles okay great thank you sir nice I got like some but I can fact check it with you couldn't he just don't read about him he's been there that's movie like brother I never said this the stack lift man was coming to be a major of the army said brother branham under oath I can't tell you the secrets he said but our plans the autumn of this has happened yet or not madam said that up he said the plans were we're going to decrease our military and just have some guards around you listen do not take I don't think they've done that get back I think they they increase the budget on military lately did they do not got Trump did that I know I saw I did something with them where everybody was excited about the military priesthood there at least their budget many ways no ma'am said that stack up was under this impression then we're going to try to get rid of lots of soldiers just have guards but then put all their time on ramps and end up being ready to pull the trigger on atomic weapons that's what he said look up trigger number going to see it such a shaking time and then he tells a story he says there's all these flying saucers around him brother have said I don't have they'll say the Lord he said it's my opinion but he said we got to take it back to the Bible he said those flying saucers were investigating angels because he said he takes that baggage that you must take it when we had visitors from the heavens he said we had visitors in the days of Sodom when two angels came down from heaven right and investigated sidle before judgment so brother said that's fine opinion and Byron said notice they had two angels come down he said but God came down too he said God was the watch it in flesh that went to Abraham and Sarah's head other than the up and he was able to discern Sarah's heart behind us back just like brother Adam did that's exactly right so she program to get this from the Bible visitors from heaven things from heaven signs and wonders from heaven all these things we got to take it back to the Bible and how badly were Abraham's seed it's exactly right how do you know because I believe in that watchman that Cain and he said I need to serve the cause of Sarah's heart behind his back I believe that Cain and I'm bagging that message and I believe that with all my heart if you're the seed of Abraham you'll do the works of Abraham you'll believe the minister devendra you'll be trading Abraham and that's why we pay our ties just right and overuse like Abraham and Jacob did and that's why we circumcised the flesh of our honors I hate right Hannah I do yeah it's exactly right that's why we get circumcised and prayer at the office I got forgive me my said take this world away from me and give me Jesus Hannah cut this off from me I don't let this life I don't want this in my life cut it off from me that's why we know what it means to be delivered from addiction we know what it needs to be delivered for Fears and all these shakings and everything like that why cuz rain bearing seed we've been circumcised day that lord but ma'am said the only answer is the watchman he said the Pentagon doesn't have the answer Trump doesn't have the answer the United States does have the answer Germany Rocha none of them have the answer science does have the answer who has the answer the watchman that's on the wall has the answer watchman one of the night and the Holy Spirit is that watchman who's making ready the puny and I was always fear of reach through the fivefold ministry glory and giving worries from God he has been sent as a watchman see we see the sick being healed they gotta got us that's when I was in my last time thank God for that the blinded eyes coming open deaf ears unstop cripples walking the lame leaking leaping like a heart fulfilling what is it it's the coming of the Lord is pressing on that's right the more quote here and I'm going to get to some scriptures and some quotes - by God's grace watch how scripture Isaiah was when he said watch from one of the night he said the morning comment at night also us so let me just turn their time I want to reckon on Labor's on this at the end of the sermon Isaiah 21 leave is 12 I know we read it but I just want to labor on I don't want to misquote it like I said I don't have this memorized I got a revelation 10 7 memorized town 3:16 yo I've got four or five or six I got all this memorized I like this whenever I did you know you just read over so many times and you rejoice it you know how it is you just mention memorize it here preach so many times which god that's the message of the out that's the message now be honored members a british well the watchman said the morning comment also the night if he will acquire inquiry return come now program quotes description he said the morning cometh and the night also see that the morning cometh and also the night program quotes the scripture but whose head program says its what the morning comes but the night comes before the morning offenses that write night is always before morning that's what he's say here the watches are saying wash and what about the night and the watchman said the morning comes but don't forget the night he says this what was it anyone knows that just before the break of day just at the hours of the approaching of the day it turns darker than ever was o my friends listen to the save the lord program said if you consider me to be a servant and just before the break of day that's why this horrible gloom is over the earth it's just before the company of the Lord Jesus there's no more hope left in it nothing but his coming nations are against nations and they have fooled through God's laboratory so they got the power to blow one another to atomic ashes and they are wicked and their unreligious and their unpriced light and the only motive they have an object is to destroy and they're inspired by the destroying angel that was sent from heaven to inspire these men he said was from heaven I thought was beheld when he says from heaven but let me say man said in the name of Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit is sent as a watchman on the tower and as the people cry one of the night are you weary of his life are you weary of sin are you weird your funeral processions and sickness and ungodliness of every hand has the knife and long and weary what of the night watchman he says the morning cometh brother man who said to see the comfort did you guys that the Watchmen gave them comfort they said one of the night one of the night and the watchman said there's coming a morning nighttime was awful during that that's why they had night Watchers remember that they had four night watches you remember that in the Bible nice start at 6:00 p.m. when the Sun went down and then the Sun throws at 6 a.m. right so 12 divided by 4 is every 3 hours add a watch so there's a watch at 9 p.m. watchin was a night there's a watch watch at midnight watch me one of the night I watch it 3 up watching other night and then the last one through course was 6:00 a.m. when the Sun was about to break watch her mother night and they had to have somebody who was awake at all times because that was the great time to attack was night time people were ready good to see could see the forces Watchmen had a hard drive to see but they had that good ears to be able to hear the sound of safe tonight of danger coming so buyback said do you see the cover the watchman coverts that I said one of the night watchmen it's all doom and gloom it's all dark but watch it said the mornings coming Church there's a morning come today bad weather we seated up there is a morning coming hallelujah and if we go to the grave and that morning comes for us as the sixth dimension praise God with a new body with us the operative body the more you will come that day but there's also coming the morning which the rapture starts is the morning that we go to the marriage supper the lamb ain't exactly right that's the comfort there's coming a new day remember the Lord's Day the lower thing is when man's days are over when these government's no rule by Satan or cast out when men or Church on the earth when the trumpet sound when the files report out that's when the lord's day starts when these days of man start falling and over the floor to that amen the Bible said heaven is rejoicing when the vatican's destroyed you know that the Bible said that is hard to think now a human minds but we're thinking with human we're not seeing a God's mind but the Bible said the angels and prophets will all rejoice the twenty-four elders will rejoice when that wicked city that whip your church is cast on the destroyed that's the mind of God that's what heaven thinks about it no Salvia mind of heaven hey while we're here let's have compassion but once we know it was a class all we know it's going to happen we know God is going to destroy that place what did I say not compassion of our demons compassion upon individuals say God come out of her my people let them come out they beat up our takers of our sins eggs in it hallelujah exactly right now see the comfort my ram set the mornings coming and the night is also coming what is the night look how perfectly in harmony with scripture Isaiah was and the regular course of nature always had approaching in the Sun he conceals the darkness together it makes it dark it's darker before day than any other time in the night why it's approaching light that's making a dark everybody ever said it's the approaching of the Lord Jesus now that's bringing this gloom upon the earth Laurie did not he say when you see these things begin to come to pass lift up your head for your Redemption draweth that that's in Matthew 24 as well program gives two more proofs that the judgments coming Israel's didn't were homeland the man said for the first time in 2500 years how many saw the Trump how many saw the trouble go there this week he spent twenty eight hours in Israel not even two days but he's near he's a busy guy I guess currently but he's the first president alive to ever go to the Wailing Wall where the Jews pray and wail he's the first one ever go there I don't know this guy is a pretender or if he's actually had a little few moments where he's walking lightly before the Lord so it feels like he's pretended but he's doing things that are kind of shocking even Obama did do that he didn't hundred the Jews that way right he learned it about George W Bush any living Jimmy Carter never did that he's still alive today I think he's the oldest living person that we have if I'm not mistaken remember Edison photo says another proof the judgment is coming Israel's in her homeland the second one is the spirit discerned this holy spirit that deserted Sarah was here today which was his ministry he could recognize that well this must be the end time because here that watchman is deserting Sarah's heart and Sodom got heard right after that the right understand that by God's grace so the sermon gift was there through a prophet watchman and then destruction came and after program saw in his day and we saw again the truck the United States member the United States is the beast out of the land on the land out of the North America the Beast the satanic spirit all in the United States racing up on the land and look at look at the truck now the guy goes to Saudi Ravan I was all buddy-buddy with them and then he goes straight to Israel buddy-buddy with them and then yesterday or today I'm sorry he said the Vatican today you see that he got the Pope today and the Pope's like this in the picture and Trump's like this because they had a fight on Twitter last year before he got let me remember that they're fighting and the Pope said no Christian will build a wall and Trump tweeted back and said oh I'm a Christian Huck in this man judge me well by we can judge by in future known when you cuss alone strip bars and all these things like that and hurt people and do all evil things like that sable things when evil things proceed out of your mouth it shows you got evil things in your heart how can bitter water Street water come on the same pound Church so we see that look at the beast making good relations or trying to make good relation I make friends with the Jews and the Catholics I look at this church I got a couple more quotes that we'll move on here I'll move on to this program blanket is the pastor to the watchman so that's why I've been dealing with some of these things lady but before that but as that the morning cometh that's right there's a comfort what's it all about it's the making of the morning coming and it's pressing toward the light it's making roast darkest come just before the light goes to shiners just as it gets darker reported on here it is today the world's getting darker before the coming of Christ he said I was so glad to be a Christian I'm so glad I am his watchman one of them that's standing on the wall ha ha I think he's not the only one he's one of them that's standing on the wall the other Lord crying out to the people prepare to meet God for the hour of his coming his drawing nigh all right now let's get to this this this is why this scripture meant so much to me because brother Adam started saying is the pastoring the fivefold ministry or Watchmen as well and as a patch like I said the last few service I've inverted about our church's dedication you know we want to be dedicated to the Lord right and like I told everybody on Sunday if you can't here for service listen to the next day because listen if you don't you're going to hear one out of three servers the Holy Spirit spoke to the church so you're two-thirds if you listen to one you're two-thirds missing the voice of the Holy Spirit not about you but if I was a part of a church and I knew God has preached by that pulpit I want to hear a hundred percent amen I wouldn't want to be a one-third I want to be 100 percent or I go to where I knew God was speaking you know alright go somewhere I have confidence go wherever you have confidence the thing to do is hear the voice of the Holy G that's exactly right now heesu program starts telling your story and there's a story the two boys getting looking at how much their Middler minerals were worth that you sold their 50 melted-down that you would body insulted he said one look at the others at Jim we're not worth very much are we said no we're not John I said wait a minute oh if you got a sold out it's worth ten thousand worlds that's been can be redeemed by the power of God if you'll just let it man when he when he sees those things he's responsible to tell others now see this is where gets the thought about betta watch me he doesn't tell those boys listen you're worth more than that you're worth more than forty three says I saw when I was just a boy I spent my whole life at it I only sorry I got one life I wish I had ten thousand if I hadn't Ernie I still want to tell people about it because the greatest thing ever found if you'll read in Ezekiel 33 we just read that there was a watchman set on the Tower of this watch it was responsible for the entire city amen and I wait yourselves to your spiritual context minute while I get to this scripture that watchman had to be a trained man I didn't know what he was doing for it any distance as soon as they rose the enemy he could detect it he could tell their march you can tell their color it's how they rank and file just as far as human eyes could see he could see it and he was higher than the rest of them for he was training all the enemy and God required over the whole see this hand watched in one of the night hallelujah that's the way God's soldiers are today they're trained to the word when anything go comes up it's got a little polish to it it's got something else it's not Scripture they warn their congregation right anything that's not Bible anything that's not God like such as having soup supper as dad says everything else that pay off the pastor's those things are wrong Bunco games hard' parties in the churches it's wrong and the real Roger in the wall who's once been and the presence of God that's what makes all the difference someone that's forward to getting if he isn't on the wall if he's just supposed to be on the wall the wall may not be any higher aggress the congregation but if he's a correct watch we got raised him following the spheres that the rest of them never gets to but he watches the flock and God requires an appearance the man of God who stands in the presence of God at the most God is God and those that God keeps his word and watch God perform himself and do his duty and kiba swear that no matter how many organizations or denominations tries to tear it down he knows the rank of the file the enemy he knows what to tell the congregation Oh real Watchmen that's what I would be with you and I salute you goes the sisters now women you know I love you my sister you know that I don't stand to hurt you I love you but what am I going to do there at that date yesterday when I know the Bible teaches what women to do and then I know to be the truth and then if the watch resist on the walls he's enemy among the people and don't warn him God so require the blood of the Watchmen pain so remember applies this watchman to himself and now who's he applied to pastors when pastors let you cut your hair off remember we have the state the Lord if you cut your hair as I said Lord you're dead you're not born again right that's what my mentor said in 1964 and say that that's right oh it's okay to cut your hair just trip it a little bit that Pastor is telling you something that's wrong and when he lets you dress it in my disclosed and tell you that that's all right he said that's wrong here's another quote ovaries Jesus in Matthew 10 and gave them power is unclean spirits program said many pastors just let them unclean spirits stay right in the church by what not preaching against sin what kind of what kind of husband would you brothers be or you sisters if you happy when you get children things like that what kind of mother father would you be if you let sinn lay there in your house and they lit it up you'd be an awful parent you have to address it look at it address it and kick it out of house what kind of a patch would I be if I just never preach against sin and I know it and I don't preach against it with address at card parties Bunco games dances soup suppers mercy he said oh mercy what kind of pass with it not a real watching would it but Madison once you're the presence of God you'll be able to call those things out next quote over Levin raining now God has set not man God has set the church first apostles secondary profits teachers pastor so for God to live in the church if God put them in there they're qualified for the job right God wouldn't put a man in a tower in a position like that I said that thinks Americans has past got one up and a man in a position like that to be a prophet or seer that would say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when the Bible declares him to be God would not put a man in the tower there that would preach a wishy-washy gospel and not tell the truth and warn the people of the rafters to cover he put a man in there that would be bold and would have a spirit that seen the other coming judgment and regardless of what the people said he warned them anyhow cry out against it he doesn't put blind prophets in his power he puts profits preachers who foresees the coming judgement and warns the people to flee I just and God knows I just got a message on my make up in the Bible video today on YouTube I said thanks for being so bold and preaching the truth and not caring about people's feelings and I said Laurie to God I said wasn't me it was Christ at a minute which we've lost friends we've lost you know we've lost associates because that that video make up in the Bible amen that's okay we name Christ amen whenever we lose Jesus said I'll make it up today God will not leave anybody uh you won't anybody anything amen if you lose he'll add to you it's exactly right fellowship when I seen that woman another morning he led her to Christ after 90 I just wondered I just want them to be since and they never stand up administers maybe that one on the platform the other night but as I said you called out and told him he was smoking cigarettes right the platform in front everybody did the Holy Spirit spare his feelings absolutely not the Holy Spirit caught out his smoking right on the pub I've heard numerous times on the tapes but having said how you called his sins out and yet a preacher god I love that brother I love all that brothers but if I did it there'd be something wrong with me that's why there's some problem these mega preachers on TV that never preach against sin grace God there's something wrong with them they're trying to build the church rather than clean the church I don't want you to be with the church clean not full like the head I've got it fills it up break up if not fill us with love yeah bizzy's has DCC fill with angels I didn't it yeah I would have full church like that for the church that's washing the butter cried a man rather have that any day of the week amen he said but Lord when I have to speak it out let them know it's not me doing it it's your spirits calling out the sin of the world and how can I hold my peace and maintain my visual or I cannot do it and let them not feel evil but just go to the word and seek God see if I may I say let the here's a my preaching not feel evil when I preach against their sin but he said may they go to the word and seek God about it that's all any preachers that's your that's your desire when you witness to somebody right it's not to make them mad it's the hope that they don't see God because of that see that be right I'm not trying to get people when I share my message videos around I'm gonna try to get people upset I'm trying to say those who can be saved amen there's another conference coming no I'm just kicked out here talks about every time you hear ambulance it's a warning every time you hear the warning voice of your pastor I crossed this moment it tells you you're going to the judgment I can told my dad last time I seen him after his birthday he said boy just look at that face reduce it well I wasn't really old it was great hair and I said dad it's just a reminder that you're going to meet Jesus that's right I said then you got to get back pray all these things like that all these things see a pastor preaching against it as a warning going to be judging one that and if he doesn't preach it there's something wrong with the pastor now we all know that Lord is coming word and talk about gifts if a proxy would say the Lord is coming they'll see them he said we all know that behold the Lord is coming that would be all right but he's saying that the pastor at the platform he's got the word for that so when I think a pastor can tell you the Lord is coming we don't need tongues interpretation to tell you the Lord's coming the pastor can tell you Dax is in the Bible he's an immediate pastor a prophet of the church or pastor rather a pastors to study the word of the Lord and tell you what's written the word the Lord about the coming the Lord and you're worn by that I'm so glad my job is just to read the Bible and tell you what the Bible says that's mighty if that's why that's my column arrestor that's my job to tell you what's in the Bible the gifts of tongues interpretation of prophecy there to tell you what's not in the Bible they're supposed to discern the situation that's cause for your algebra we know that and in this message if you have to listen that you'd like it is from December 26 well Graham said for something like this where's your brother devil be the pastor should he leave the tabernacle in Jeffersonville go to Fort Wayne Indiana there's no scripture in the Bible that says auermann devil should go to whatever but that's why we need the gifts of God so when you come across the situation you're a decision you're not open shrug that's what we need the gifts of God and so I hope this makes us hunger so we'll pray for more gifts of God right that's why we put up that that's what we're talking we're talking right now what is the works of God I noticed this before the end of time what was it before the fire was fun they had message after message warning after warning by lot preaching and that's the pastor lot now I don't want to be lot but my madam says that that was a pastor I would be Abraham with his group bed but look lot was the pastor there inside of morning that God had a pastor warning them portabella ready brother and so they turned it down they turned it like idle tales the same as they do the pastor today Oh pastors just taught us he just saw Fiza ignoramus he's just a fire and brimstone preacher ah he's off his rocker he's his old-fashioned but the Bible said we must warn that fires coming Jackie right okay I said sometimes your pastor has to wait down something that means to kind of cut you up on something just love him that much more because he's a real spiritual father demon trying to keep you up lined up because he's watching over your soul which the Holy Ghost has made in the overseer of the church you got your Bibles turn to Hebrews 13 real quick and I know most I know these are enough they're probably new clothes but they don't contain anything you didn't already understand already I'm just reminding the church okay I'm just reminding the church because when I see things I've got a lord of the church and I go to I email people I text people on call people give them warnings why because I'm called to do it if I don't warn them the Bloods on my hands praise God I'm I'll be responsible to the end of judgment because I didn't warn them about sins they're getting into or whatever more that we understand that Hebrews 13 I'm going to Hebrews 13:7 because you should have 30 verse 13 eight memorized right eager to see that at least you ought to I know I never get out of the altar afraid all right here is 30 n-- 7 so this is actually the context that paul's writing remember them which have the rule over you who rose over you who have spoken unto you the word of the Lord whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday in other words Jesus Christ has always had a leader to preach the word the people and then you follow that leader amen he's the same yesterday today and forever now go down to verse 17 he's all done with remember inviting the church follow your leaders if I'm not a leader then write me up you know just tell me say brother Jesse I just hope me on let the follow you I want to go somewhere else I'll say praise the Lord but I don't got place in here for a reason Amen I couldn't get away from her that's how my man said you know it's a little God when you're just praying you're neutral you don't want anybody swell but dots and you just have to Russell you don't want to do it but you have to surrender and you guys got with it on your high amen and you can't read it you can't get away from it you know it's God's will amen I've seen God answered my prayers and indicate that I know it's true obey them that have the rule over you who says it twice and submit that means obey submit yourselves for they watch for your what soul I'm watching over your soul not so much your physical or your speech although we appreciate that right I'm supposed to help you if you have needs I hope you buy the engine this let me know if the loser doesn't tell me let me know if you have any needs and your mind your your spiritual eye to help that to the preaching but my main concern is your soul is their faith or unbelief in that salt and I got to watch over that's my duty I'm watching okay I just told us now for they watch for your souls as they that must give account I've got an answer to God and God is going to say Jesse Smith you're the pastor of the bronchi fellowship give an account of your congregation what am I going to say well I'm going to answer for this family I have to that family what am I going to say I've got to give an account did I warn them or not did I tell the truth or not or did not just tried to hurt their feelings I don't want to care about feelings I want to hear about God praise the Lord I wouldn't love the people who didn't tell the truth it's a perverted love to keep the word of warning away from the people look at the Bible says that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you imagine I got an answer on churches I know it seems funny but one day this word is true I understand before Christ and with all of you and I've got to answer for you every person here right I think either doing joy or with greed if I'm a faithful past man to understand that that's what he says I have a watch over your salt the Holy Ghost made me a watcher over your soul I didn't go a little bit for this message Christ came looking for me I didn't know where there was an acrid Christ set meet after God save me attackers are to church attacker why so watch over the souls attack watch over God chief it happened that's why I got sent in here if it's my choice God knows this there's my choice I'd be a home with my family because I miss my family but as I told you before I love you more that's why I'm here with you I love my family but that's just flesh and blood and water blood and you know DNA but who have enough more awesomer than the salt I love you amen because I don't lead you go to my family who I stay with the ones that I love amen but in my natural flesh if he eats you're gone is that me no more babysitter slots our kids you know why I could have more quiet time when my wife is sick she could go to bed and her mom or my mom come over watch the kids you don't have that here we got to suffer a little dose a little bit this a much suffering but it's a little bit of suffering at the door because we're far from our family but you know what God called me don't watch over souls you amen you like that you appreciate that by God's grace amen I hope that makes sense it's appreciate the word you appreciate that some talk about appreciate the word now if you're following the gospel my mom said as your pastor I would like a little later on with your spirits and just begin to come to a burping something against the spirit he said listen he goes down to would you have to correct people if somebody gets out of order and the pastor has to call it down which is a gift that's outside the word and that spirit flies up and fight to get to the pastor and that's not the Spirit of God the spirit of God always stands comes to the words he recognized the word every time so if somebody if I try to crack somebody on a gift or listen any other sin if I try to correct somebody on customs I try to correct somebody on and drinking I try to correct somebody on smoking or anything else and they fly up at me it shows the spirit of God's not behind that but somebody that will repent and say yes I'm wrong I broken the word then the Spirit of God is behind then everybody see that that's what for the Rams head then again you all say we believe the message so let's believe it I'm not you can look it up I'm not making this up it's on date but we need today is some blushing promise I'm going skip down what we need today is a household cleaning in a heartwarming a prophet of God who will stand in the pulpit and call the thing out and tell what's right and wrong and preach the gospel without rising until sinners faltered floor and meat to God sends the Holy Spirit to clean up their lives uh you know that's right even now I'm close with this I pulled up in a closed church outreach less than an hour you like that I think arguably but I also gotta watch out because I'm guarding my voice is straining the market did you know the Bible said the pastors influence here save or lose the souls of the congregation you know about tonight now remember everybody's responsible for themselves right but if someone is so irresponsible that they followed irresponsible Watchmen then they're just as guilty for letting him stay there we understand that every congregation prevention is responsible to tell the pastor if he makes a mistake everyone here is responding we're live-streaming is responsible to correcting night anybody correct me for a while now a few things come up a few people correct me on and I appreciate that or maybe some things they desire I appreciate that but that tells me either I'm preaching everything right by the Holy Spirit or the people are scared to come and correct me I hope it's the first hope inside prayed it out from the pen fasten it up and study them out where I just let the Holy Spirit preach and it's not me but if I have to be some wrong your answer your duty bound to God to come tell me about so I haven't had many people contact me so thank the Lord for that as far as I know I believe on preaching the truth because I'm letting the Holy Spirit reach that's just my opinion now here's the scripture that says it hopes re first Timothy four till I economies talking to Timothy the pastor you have attendance to reading saying I've always got really preachers always got an X or it means step step up and talk to people and a doctor this is a doctrine of water back to the doctor holiness the doctrine of predestination give your attention to that neglect not the gift that's in thee see if you got to get the preach you got to study all the time I'm gonna stand that you got to give the speakin tongue very lot right you got to get former ghosts you got a fast lot because some of these only go out by prayer and best it do that whatever your ministry is you have to invest in it you can't neglect your gift if you haven't give which was giving me about cropsy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery meditate upon these things you just always think about Mike your gift to what God's called you meditate upon that give yourself wholly to them nobody anything pull you away from it that I promptly may appear to all see so if you invest in your gift and you give yourself wholly to your gift people are going to notice why Lord is really using that sister Lord is really using that brother because they are investing in their gift they don't neglect it they invest everyone invest in one guy hey man I got to play something at every lecture if I was said a gift of God has given to every man to profit withal brother Graham says that that's the description everybody has a gift you kind of see God for meditate upon it don't neglect it say God show me about get that look I love my boys the description take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in then for doing this thou shalt both save yourself and then the here be glory see why I got to study predestination see my god study holiness and all these things and so that I'm saved and you're saved amen because it's the Holy Spirit's way to speak to the congregation always spiritual watch for the real watchman he sets me and joins me to be a spiritual watchman and I deliver his word to you and it saves both of us hey Dad I know you gonna say both of us here's how it can lose everybody jesus said what would you lawyers if you've taken away the key of knowledge which knowledge is understanding of the word you enter not in yourselves to the salvation and then that we're entering in you hindered so see they stop people from entering into the things of God salvation is for salvation Jesus a salvation now look 10 a second hit me Harvey second Timothy says a preaches last year but some shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as a canker of whom is I'm Aeneas and philetus who concerning the truth and air saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of something overthrow the pain so jesus said will I find luck faith on the earth but a boss a boss preacher will overthrow your faith and you'll be lost I'm closing with the just a few more take you remember this man said a woman was hallucinating well I'm sorry not loosing she was actually seeing the demons on her deathbed and she blamed the pastor for going to help because the pastor didn't are the truth he wasn't a real watchman here's the story some time ago in this very city Jefferson's Jeffersonville yeah there was a young girl belong to certain Church in the city she thought she was alright her pastor told her she was re she made fun of a little girl to come to church because she wouldn't go to a show a movie look at this all she was in was going to movies and she went to hell and she said your pastor is narrow-minded now the little girl said that's alright remember I told you when I purchased in that other church there earlier this year no is it late last year I preached that most people that go to movies will probably go to hell and I got the Bible for that second Peter says that lot was righteous and the things that he saw tormented him daily so lot was saved and the things he saw tormented and yet he was saved because the sin tormented him well how you gonna walk into movie it doesn't torment you and say you're safe you're not because you're so calloused to hell and then sit and everything like that you love it you're not going to be saved and I got the Bible right there when Locke saw evil things it hurt him and these people that go to church go to church and they love this galaxy or Wolverine or whatever they got yeah I'm trying to get the move summer movies it's not sent fill themselves with Superman and Batman in spider-man when Christ is the only Superman and they they hate his spirit but they love these evil demon powers how they make it to heaven with a lot barely been to heaven and that thing that kind of thing he hated it and these people go to movies and love it they won't make it to heaven they're blind and they're the they're the blind that fall into the ditch and the blind lead the blind Jesus that leaves it alone cling to Christ in the word amen he'll be wrong either balloons cars don't follow that try to pull them out of ditch right I was they try to save something theater right that's exactly right nice to believe that trip w that scripture and while she got out with some of those rough company she caught a disease so sexual disease and let it run too far the doctor of certain - city wind-up examiner come to find out she's eating with venereal disease she's not ran out of that she's a Sunday school teacher in this big church you'll find out Church sometimes the people in the church are the biggest sinners right here see I sit in a church and she's the biggest sinner sleeping with men all these things I've got in the Patrick City all right you're okay it's all right you're saved you're going to heaven go to movies it's okay it ain't worried it's not okay and just about that time your Sunday School class sir pastor walk out smoking a cigarette between services is the kind of church they went big church huge mega church pastors walk out smoke it's okay to go to movies all these things and what about that time to take your flop at the Angels come together she breaks up it's and where's that pastor you deceive her a midwife you let me get this shake I'm lost look who's guilty both but where the pastor leaders straight to hell same place he was gone why is he didn't call out against the sin that he was supposed to see amen look man said don't worry I knew he had thick leaves on to it he come before God so is he saying she recognized she was sinful it was alright when God wasn't here said but why did you let me go on like this said where's that little old girl up there at the tabernacle so she even brought up the tabernacle he said oh you're hysterical going to call doctor to give you a hypo give you a shot because he the patches on you she's hallucinating get her to be quiet she said you deceive her men I'm lost and my soul is going to hell on a cow of you she bowed her head and died program I said remember I must give what an account Jessie said that you warned them of sin did you warn them up hell did you warn them all these things I got to give it a go I can't spare anybody's feelings I'm a watchman praise God but Ram said I'm a watchman I've got to tell the people the truth obey the word follow the word the Bible says that that are unruly give him a warning what did the Bible says born everyman the Bible says honey go out to grace for that Lord every man woman that I know somehow for will good morning now just as people were lost by a false preacher people were saved by a real man of God this is my damn story of going beyond the period of time the people that led to the sixth dimension said it was because brother Branham went to preach you know the story they come running up they're all looking like twenty let's get back to the last night Lorraine was gathered to almost converse their word Rams they were converts I said yeah but there's minutes there's not that many bread it was the voice that they're not branham's that your converse there's the ones that you've led to the Lord's at some of that women that you think are so beautiful we're better than 90 years old we led to the Lord no wonder they're screaming our precious brother and they all screamed out of us if you hadn't went we wouldn't be here yeah yeah that's a fast I was I want the people to scream out I'm giving it out if you want to preach it we would not be here hey Roger too cried out to somebody right everything all the believers are going to cry out that somebody let them go so many point in the Christ somebody told him the truth and I want to say that I give an account by the word a little hey I'm faithful to my account and I can do with joy let the church listen to the Word of God and hash out every sin and walk through the spirit amen I was not a Holy Ghost amen so we're closing us and our feet here let's just read verse nestlings 5 I want to read that one and we'll get to some more scriptures but I want to preach about an hour just read a few minutes praying here by God's grace enjoy the message tonight and Watchmen one of the night what's going on in there pastor for us it's faster you say any sins coming say things around and notice what I did break something anybody notice just coming to church just being able to church right come to church going on the word Audrey the Holy Spirit right remember you can't read the Holy Spirit can expect Holy Spirit to move right if we're not keeping sin out of our lives right dressing the right way I'll be sting remember having a preach on that wife is that sweat that's what the Shepherd sees that's what the Holy Spirit and this last year we've lost I was counting up the other day we lost more families and two individuals right now one of them was okay is one of them told me why I was just not sure difference they're still in church all the other ones as far as I know are not even in a home church right now now what did that in the Holy Spirit call tonight from church did I tell them to go the other way for church absolutely not so I got to give a cow what am I am say I got to say that I preached the word I went after them I trying to share the world with them try to bring correction trying to warn them then what's God going to say God's good either to tell the truth if I did that and I think Levi did by God's grace see that see how we're in a season right now I returns in the season you see how I try to look by the Holy Spirit every see that I tried led by the Holy Spirit see what's going on I was taking attack of the church we're just so on fire one year ago brother and I were talking about we're so environment I get we're pulling and let the ear later that would be your later brother may look very stick Satan has come in here what you trying to hold people out you try to track them with shiny things track them with other things pull them out but like I said doctor differences that's okay even as long as you stay in church go to a faithful other flock that has a good watch you know I'm just trying to be faith in myself by God's grace you see I'm trying to see the spiritual state once the spirits say to the church I've got to call these things out okay first Thessalonians and church I know we know some of these things but as a watchman I got to say it I got to say it and if you love the Lord that you the Word of God that's for sure first Thessalonians five I had 14 actually let's read verse 12 this deals with preachers and we beseech you brother to know that which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish number these are preachers now remember we're over we're watching over your souls verse 13 an esteem them very highly in love for their works sake and be peace amongst yourselves to see how peace with the pastor but have peace with the bridge you had everybody's one another because jesus said I go but I'm leaving my peace a man you're going to have trouble this world not leaving you my peace so if you've really got Christ left peace in our hearts before nothing look at verse 14 now exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly so when people are unruly that means break the rules of the word anytime they break a scripture you are glanced at the congregation you can do two T's he said don't let the pastor do all the warding off to get that quote up true so you can see that when you see somebody break the word go to them personally or some of the texts are called it sees everything okay it's like you're breaking the word warn them to the Unruh this is a Holy Ghost no tricker comfort the feeble-minded when people are on the skin if through this my battle comfort them so God is with you I'll pray you through here's some scriptures to comfort you right what else can we we can't cover with anything else or money or food that will cover them the word will come amen right although they need food or shelter clothes up my right support the weak see some people are going to be stronger in the church some are going to be weaker if we see weaker we got to go support them amen what's the best way to apprai for them in contact that's the best way to support them go see it if you can I can try not as schedule time I go see some of the bones are left the church and trying to schedule that
