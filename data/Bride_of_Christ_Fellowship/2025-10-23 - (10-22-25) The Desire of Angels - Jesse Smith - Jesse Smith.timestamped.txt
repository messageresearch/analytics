[0:00] all their sins. They have peace with
[0:01] with as much as possible with every, you
[0:03] know, of course, we all have enemies if
[0:04] we're believers, you know, but with all
[0:07] possible, we've kept peace with
[0:08] everybody. We keep the love of God
[0:10] ruling our hearts. And so, I just felt
[0:12] that with brother Dale, just like I do
[0:13] with brother Rod and, you know, of
[0:14] course, Sister Beatatric and all these
[0:15] faithful saints, you know, that God's
[0:17] allowed us, Brother Jose, uh, have
[0:19] served God so so faithfully all these
[0:21] decades. And one day, if the Lord
[0:23] carries, I want to be one of them.
[0:24] Praise God. I want to be full of the
[0:25] love of God. Hallelujah. Now and always.
[0:28] Whenever whatever trials God allows to
[0:30] come my way, I want to overcome them by
[0:32] the love of God.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 1 vers12.
[0:38] That's a lot of read. And maybe we can
[0:39] get all that in sync by God's grace.
[0:41] Could we all be in harmony here by the
[0:42] Holy Spirit to read that? Let's read
[0:44] that on three. 1 2 3. unto whom it was
[0:47] revealed that not unto themselves, but
[0:51] unto us they did minister the things
[0:54] which are now reported unto you by them
[0:58] that have preached the gospel unto you
[1:01] with the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:04] heaven, which things the angels desire
[1:08] to look into. If you have a need of
[1:10] prayer, let's make let's have one more
[1:11] word of prayer. If you have a need on
[1:12] your heart, just make it known to God.
[1:13] Father God, you see the needs, Lord.
[1:15] Lord, and you tell us in your word, the
[1:17] angels are sent to bring us deliverance,
[1:19] Lord, to minister to the needs of the
[1:21] heirs of salvation. I'm looking at when
[1:22] my eyes are open, I'm looking at your
[1:24] bride, your children. Lord, these are
[1:27] the heirs of salvation. Lord, send your
[1:28] angel tonight if there's a need for it.
[1:30] Lord, I pray you'd bless your people in
[1:32] Jesus Christ's name. The saints said,
[1:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you're being
[1:36] seated. Praise God.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Well, this might be my shortest sermon
[1:40] in a long time. This could be 30 minutes
[1:41] here, saints. Hallelujah. We'll see how
[1:43] it goes. I you know I was I told brother
[1:46] Chris I was planning on preaching you
[1:47] know going back to the God hiding
[1:48] himself series but uh as I sat down and
[1:51] studied a little more this thought just
[1:53] came to me so I thought I just preach on
[1:55] this and uh I felt inspired I never
[1:57] thought about that the desires of
[1:59] angels. Hallelujah. So let's look at
[2:01] this here today. Um I think everything
[2:03] should be familiar here uh Lord willing.
[2:06] Um 1 Peter chapter 1. Let's go back up
[2:09] to verse 10 if you got your Bible. Uh 1
[2:12] Peter 1 verse 10.
[2:15] You know, Peter's book is often called,
[2:17] church, the fir the book of first Peter
[2:19] is often called the book about
[2:21] suffering. How to overcome suffering and
[2:23] trials and manifold temptations. And um
[2:26] so Peter understood what it was like to
[2:28] be tempted uh many times uh to measure,
[2:32] right? He was tempted as as hard as you
[2:34] could be tempted. You know, Satan
[2:35] himself sometimes tempted Peter. We know
[2:38] that Satan made him say the wrong thing
[2:40] to the Lord Jesus. uh but uh he went
[2:42] through also physical uh suffering and
[2:44] was crucified upside down at least
[2:46] according to history. Now I'm not saying
[2:47] that's thus sayith the Lord. Some people
[2:49] say he wasn't but uh it doesn't matter
[2:51] uh as far as in one way we know he died
[2:53] a martyr though all the all the accounts
[2:55] uh have him as a martyr. He gave his
[2:57] life for Jesus Christ. Amen. Sealing his
[3:00] faith. Now verse 10 says of which
[3:02] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[3:05] searched diligently. So Peter says all
[3:08] the Old Testament prophets, they sought
[3:11] to understand real salvation. Now think
[3:13] about that church, they spent their
[3:15] whole lives, now imagine, we don't do
[3:16] that, but think about that. They spent
[3:18] their whole lives watching animals be
[3:20] killed and bled all every Sabbath there,
[3:23] every time they gathered just animal
[3:26] blood, animal carcass, animals
[3:27] squealing, and all the blood blood. And
[3:30] they just wondered, "What does this
[3:32] mean?" They they just wondered for 4,000
[3:34] years what is the purpose of all you
[3:36] know you read in Solomon how many
[3:38] thousands of cattle he offered you know
[3:42] they would just give thousands and it
[3:43] would be all day just a we'd say a blood
[3:46] fast just blood all day long for their
[3:50] feast periods as well so seven days
[3:52] eight days you know they'd have these
[3:53] feasts and so the prophets you know were
[3:56] wondering what is this all about all
[3:58] this bloodshed what is the purpose of
[4:00] all this and theible Ible said that they
[4:03] they they they diligently sought about
[4:05] it and then the prophets remember the
[4:07] prophets would catch some revelation. I
[4:09] think it was Micah that said God you
[4:10] don't delight in the blood of lambs. He
[4:12] said you delight in a broken and
[4:14] contrite heart.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Right? I mean he's just even David
[4:17] caught that revelation that all this
[4:19] bloodshed it could be given animals can
[4:21] be given but the the worshipper could
[4:23] not be purged.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Right? The animals could die. You could
[4:27] go through all the emotions but nothing
[4:29] would change. And church we don't want
[4:30] that to happen to us. We don't want to
[4:32] come to church and nothing changes about
[4:33] our lives.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; We should we should constantly
[4:36] appreciate the sacrifice of our Lord
[4:38] Jesus Christ
[4:40] &gt;&gt; and consider what he suffered and
[4:42] consider the power that he now gives us
[4:44] to overcome sin.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, this sacrifice did not
[4:48] die in vain. Hallelujah.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; How many Old Testament Jews did it
[4:52] constantly, right? Every cycle of
[4:53] revival, the animals died in vain. It
[4:55] was vain. It was vain. Meant nothing.
[4:58] Changed not their lives. But let this
[5:00] sacrifice forever change our lives.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; They saw it diligently. What is this?
[5:06] The the salvation uh what is this? What
[5:09] does this mean? And then they even
[5:11] prophesied of the grace. Remember said
[5:13] grace grace unto it. The capstone comes
[5:16] down with grace. Even uh Nehemiah said
[5:19] God has given us a little space of grace
[5:22] to get back to Israel, right? And and
[5:25] finish building the wall to protect
[5:27] God's people. It was a little space of
[5:30] grace. And let me say this, you have
[5:31] more than a little space of grace. You,
[5:33] the Bible said, God has given us much
[5:35] grace. Hallelujah. God is rich in grace.
[5:37] God is rich in mercy. Hallelujah.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; God has given us so much mercy. So much
[5:45] grace.
[5:46] And let's live like we're thankful for
[5:48] it. Praise God.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how I want to live my life.
[5:51] Hallelujah.
[5:53] But they uh the the the prophets
[5:55] diligently sought. Lord, what does this
[5:58] mean? How how how does this relate to
[6:00] salvation? And verse 11, the Bible says
[6:03] they even were searching what or what
[6:05] manner of time the spirit of Christ
[6:07] which was in them did signify.
[6:10] So even they would search when is this
[6:12] going to happen? When is salvation going
[6:14] to change? When are we going to have
[6:16] more power? When are we going to have
[6:18] the power to to walk away from the
[6:20] sacrifice change? Because remember the
[6:22] Bible said the animal blood could never
[6:24] purge their conscience.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Think about that. If you lied or
[6:28] something, if you stole, the animal
[6:29] would die, you'd feel bad, but you'd
[6:31] still have that guilty conscience. Now,
[6:33] church, it ought to be encouraging. We
[6:34] ought to be able to know when we come
[6:36] here, we confess our sins, we can leave
[6:38] with a clean conscience.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; That is a great difference. That should
[6:42] make us rejoice
[6:44] &gt;&gt; that we have a better covenant with
[6:46] better promises that we know God totally
[6:48] forgives the sins. Not just cover them
[6:50] over like the animal sacrifice, but he
[6:53] totally annihilates them or remits them,
[6:56] sends them away. Hallelujah. And the
[6:57] Bible said God forgets them. Amen.
[7:00] Hallelujah. How can a divine being
[7:02] forget sins? I don't know. But if
[7:04] anybody can do it, it's God. Hallelujah.
[7:06] Amen.
[7:08] Glory. See, they wonder when when would
[7:11] the spirit of Christ uh testify in them?
[7:14] When would it testify before the
[7:15] suffering of Christ and the glory that
[7:17] should follow? We know even the Garden
[7:19] of Eden, the first prophecy was about uh
[7:22] Jesus bruising the head of the serpent,
[7:24] right? But the serpent would bruise his
[7:26] heel. Hallelujah. Speaking of Calvary,
[7:29] think about think about that. That
[7:30] prophecy was 4,000 years. They were
[7:32] waiting. When is the seed of this woman
[7:34] going to finally defeat this serpent?
[7:37] They're just waiting and they diligently
[7:39] search. Is this the time? Is this the
[7:41] time that that the Messiah? Is this the
[7:43] Is Moses the Messiah? Is Joshua uh is
[7:46] John the Baptist the Messiah?
[7:48] &gt;&gt; I mean they diligently sought when is
[7:50] this suffering servant going to come and
[7:52] give us real salvation?
[7:55] Hallelujah.
[7:57] And then of course Paul says or Peter
[7:59] says here that it was revealed to him
[8:01] and the other apostles who wrote the
[8:03] scripture and who preached the gospel.
[8:05] Hallelujah. Verse 12, unto whom it was
[8:08] revealed that not unto unto themselves
[8:12] but unto us they did minister the
[8:14] things. So when they got these
[8:16] revelations how Jesus is the lamb of
[8:18] God. Amen. Jesus is the Passover lamb.
[8:21] Hallelujah. By his blood, if you apply
[8:24] his blood to your life, the death angel
[8:26] cannot strike your house.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. And your sins can be
[8:31] totally free and you can have an exodus
[8:33] out of your past life. They got an
[8:36] exodus out of Egypt. But we can live our
[8:38] we can live our and leave behind our
[8:41] entire past life. We can leave it behind
[8:43] and it'll be drowned in the sea of
[8:45] Jesus's blood. Hallelujah.
[8:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of our addictions, brother
[8:49] Chris, can be drowned in the sea of the
[8:51] blood of Jesus Christ. All of our task
[8:53] masters. Amen. Hallelujah. It can all be
[8:56] drowned by the grace of God if we
[8:58] believe in the power of God's token
[9:01] lamb. Hallelujah.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. My
[9:05] So it doesn't it just wasn't for the
[9:07] preachers. This this salvation and holy
[9:09] ghost just wasn't for the preachers the
[9:11] apostles. It Paul said Peter says it's
[9:13] unto us
[9:15] all of us. They minister the these
[9:18] things which are now reported unto you
[9:21] by them that have preached the gospel
[9:23] unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
[9:26] from heaven which things the angels
[9:29] desire to look into. And now notice it's
[9:32] present tense. The angels desire to look
[9:36] into these scriptures and these promises
[9:38] about salvation and the Holy Ghost.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Think about that, brother
[9:44] Austin. For 4,000 years, the angels,
[9:46] they would protect Moses. They would
[9:47] they would protect Noah. They would
[9:49] protect all these believers, but then he
[9:51] they would watch them turn right over
[9:53] and give into sin so easily.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; Imagine me, the angel. You were standing
[9:58] there and and you gave that rock power.
[10:01] When David sent that power, the angel
[10:03] supercharged that rock. Amen. It hit
[10:05] Goliath and it fell down. And you saw
[10:07] that as an angel, you were pleased. But
[10:09] then years later, you watch him give in
[10:12] to Basheba's situation. And then Uriah
[10:14] situation. The angels are like
[10:18] now. They've never sinned, right? They
[10:20] don't they don't even know what sin is,
[10:22] but they see the good and they see the
[10:24] bad. And the Bible says they care about
[10:26] us because they desire to know more
[10:28] about salvation. Think about that. They
[10:30] watch all those animals die. They watch
[10:33] over the believers not understand it.
[10:35] Even they'll even the angels are
[10:37] wondering what is this about?
[10:40] &gt;&gt; When is there going to be a change? When
[10:42] will there be power? When when can they
[10:44] have a clear conscience? When can we
[10:46] have a stable brother? When can we have
[10:48] a stable sister? Hallelujah.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Who lives under the power of the Holy
[10:52] Ghost and faithfully serves God. Amen.
[10:55] Amen.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; And even even when they have mountain
[10:58] top victories and they come down to the
[11:00] valleys, when will there be believers
[11:02] who will still overcome sin down in the
[11:04] valley? Hallelujah.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They saw everybody rejoice on the
[11:08] mountain tops cuz the angels helped them
[11:10] get there. But they were wondering when
[11:12] are we going to have some believers? I
[11:13] desire to understand when is salvation
[11:15] going to change? When are these
[11:17] believers really going to have the Holy
[11:18] Ghost? And Peter says they're looking
[11:20] into it now. They want to see it now.
[11:22] They want to see us overcome.
[11:24] Hallelujah.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; They want to see us have real salvation.
[11:28] They want to see us have real Holy Ghost
[11:30] power. Can I say it like this? They want
[11:31] to see us have real Holy Ghost
[11:34] Christlike character that's like Jesus
[11:36] Christ.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they desired now. They
[11:42] currently desire to look into these
[11:43] things. Look into the scriptures. Look
[11:45] at all these verses that talk about the
[11:47] life of the believer. Remember Ezekiel
[11:50] prophesied of it. You get a new heart.
[11:52] Then you get a new spirit. Then you get
[11:55] my spirit.
[11:57] &gt;&gt; That's what the angels desire to look
[11:58] into. Wow. What is brother Austin gonna
[12:00] look like with a new heart. A new
[12:03] spirit. And then God's spirit.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; What is brother Jesse going to look like
[12:07] with a new heart? The angels desire.
[12:08] What does that look like? Church. Let's
[12:10] live a life so they can understand what
[12:13] the salvation is, what the baptism of
[12:15] the Holy Ghost is. Let's live a life so
[12:17] the angels can understand the power of
[12:20] God in our lives. Amen.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. They see the power of God in God's
[12:24] creation, right? And God orders them
[12:25] around, but they want to see the power
[12:27] of God in your life and my life.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the desire of the angels.
[12:33] And remember, church, everybody has a
[12:34] guardian angel.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; So, your guardian angel wants to watch
[12:38] you overcome, wants you to see do
[12:40] spiritual warfare on the job, right?
[12:42] Preaching to my son here. And he wants
[12:44] to see me do spiritual warfare more on
[12:45] my job. Amen.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what the angels are
[12:49] watching, Brother Chris. They desire to
[12:51] see us live the full salvation life and
[12:54] then a Holy Ghostfilled life.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; That struck me as inspired.
[13:01] Imagine the angels watching in in
[13:03] Matthew 16. Imagine the angel watching
[13:06] Peter.
[13:08] Jesus asked Peter, "Who do you say that
[13:10] I am?"
[13:11] Well, some say you're Messiah. Some
[13:13] Jeremiah Isaiah. No, he said, "But who
[13:16] do you say I am?" Why? Think about that
[13:18] angel Peter standing right there. Peter
[13:20] says, "You're the Christ, the son of the
[13:22] living God."
[13:24] The angel's like, "That's right."
[13:28] Amen.
[13:30] Hallelujah. But the angel within within
[13:32] a matter of a few moments or hours, that
[13:35] angel has to watch Satan come on and
[13:37] anoint Peter. And Peter grabs hold of
[13:39] Jesus and say, "You will not go to the
[13:41] cross." And Jesus says, "Get behind me,
[13:43] Satan." Imagine the angel
[13:47] I imagine I wonder if you want to do
[13:49] some spiritual wrestling, right? Because
[13:50] that's what they like to do. Hallelujah.
[13:53] They like to wrestle for 21 day matches.
[13:54] Hallelujah. But he just stood there and
[13:57] watch it. Look at this is Peter and this
[13:59] is the man who wrote this. Hallelujah.
[14:02] He watches him on he watches him under
[14:04] the power of God and then he can so
[14:06] easily get deceived. Now this was before
[14:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He gets
[14:11] so easil easily deceived to let Satan
[14:13] speak right through him. But Jesus
[14:16] overcame by the word of God. Hallelujah.
[14:18] Amen. Hallelujah. And that's what we
[14:21] overcome by the word of God.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So angels have a deep interest in
[14:26] the mystery of salvation and the mystery
[14:29] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and how
[14:31] you and I are able to receive that
[14:34] salvation which means deliverance from
[14:35] our sins and also the baptism of the
[14:38] Holy Ghost which is the power of Christ
[14:40] and the witness of Christ in our lives.
[14:44] Amen.
[14:46] Hallelujah. Now, here church, this is a
[14:49] beautiful verse. Uh some people look at
[14:50] this verse in certain ways. Luke 15:10,
[14:53] if you got your Bible, likewise, I say
[14:54] unto you, there is joy in the presence
[14:56] of angels of God over one sinner that
[15:00] repents. Now, most people think that
[15:04] when someone gets saved, the angels
[15:05] rejoice. Okay? Brother Ham talks about
[15:08] that, too. A lot of preachers talk about
[15:09] that. That's very possible. So that's
[15:11] the way I'm going to use this today. So
[15:14] imagine the angel, your guardian angel,
[15:17] watching over you all the time,
[15:18] protecting you from car accidents or
[15:19] protecting you from drowning. Amen.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; I was safe from drowning at seven years
[15:24] old or eight years old. The angel made
[15:26] sure I was I didn't drown. Hallelujah.
[15:28] Amen.
[15:30] But imagine the angels, they watch as a
[15:32] child, they watch you give in to evil
[15:34] sins like cussing or swearing or
[15:35] blasphemy uh or or lust or something
[15:38] like this or stealing thieves. And they
[15:40] watch all these years. They go through
[15:41] year after year watching you. And
[15:43] finally, and now church, look, they're
[15:45] watching you. And all these years, you
[15:47] got these demons you're letting lead
[15:48] you. And these holy angels already beat
[15:51] them up in the war in heaven. And
[15:53] they're like, "Just give me a chance,
[15:54] God. Just give me a chance. I'll I'll
[15:57] take care of these demons." Right?
[15:59] Hallelujah. And so for all these years
[16:01] they wait some I almost waited two
[16:03] decades brother Chris in my life. Amen.
[16:05] I got saved at 19. I was almost 20. And
[16:08] for almost two decades they watched me
[16:10] just give into the demons. And the
[16:12] angel's like my angel's like I know he
[16:14] can overcome. I I can defeat this this
[16:16] devil. I've defeated him before.
[16:18] Hallelujah. Just give me the chance God.
[16:20] I'm waiting on you. Hallelujah. And then
[16:22] finally at that great service I I see
[16:24] the the football player lift his hands
[16:26] and I start crying. I said I'm ashamed
[16:27] of myself. I want to be a believer. I
[16:29] need to serve God. And church, right in
[16:31] that ceremony, there was angels there
[16:33] saying, "Praise God. Oh, now you've got
[16:35] to leave. Now I'm going to cast you out.
[16:37] Now you're overcome." And this boy is
[16:40] saved. Hallelujah.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; And the angels rejoice. Hallelujah. Yes.
[16:44] Now he's going to be led by us. Now
[16:46] he'll obey my voice. Hallelujah.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[16:53] is the angels of God
[16:55] rejoicing when you repented and you got
[16:58] saved.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; I imagine they also rejoice at your
[17:01] baptism.
[17:03] See, being baptized is a special moment.
[17:05] That's a time to rejoice
[17:07] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "Whosoever believeth
[17:09] and is baptized shall be saved."
[17:12] &gt;&gt; You go through the act of publicly
[17:14] declaring, "I'm dead. I'm crucified with
[17:16] with Christ." Amen. Therefore, I no
[17:19] longer live, but Jesus Christ lives in
[17:21] me. The life I live now, I live by the
[17:24] faith of the son of God. Hallelujah.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:28] Glory to God.
[17:32] Now, remember Daniel 9:21-22,
[17:35] the man Gabriel came to Daniel in a
[17:37] vision and informed it and said,
[17:39] "Daniel, I've come forth to give you
[17:41] skill and understanding." So, see how
[17:44] angels desire, they desire to help you
[17:47] out. Anybody need any spiritual skill
[17:49] here tonight?
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Anybody need any understanding about
[17:52] what God's going to do next in your
[17:54] life? Well, you come to the right place.
[17:56] Amen.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; God's desires. God's angels, brother
[17:59] Chris, desire, brother Austin, they
[18:01] desire to give us that, but we got to
[18:03] pray and seek God for it, too.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what Daniel was
[18:07] doing. He shut himself away to pray.
[18:08] Now, we might not have the luxury of
[18:10] doing that, but we can do it every
[18:11] morning. Praise God. What I'm saying,
[18:13] you can't I can't take a month off,
[18:14] right? and a month away from helping out
[18:16] my family and paying the bills, but I
[18:18] can seek God every day. He said, "If I
[18:20] seek him daily, I'll find him."
[18:21] Hallelujah.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; That's that verse in Proverbs says, "If
[18:25] you seek me in the morning, you shall
[18:27] find me." I don't have it right in front
[18:28] of me, but that is a promise in the book
[18:30] of Proverbs. Those that seek me early
[18:32] shall find me.
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Let me see if I can pull that up real
[18:35] quick
[18:38] because it's uh it's uh wisdom
[18:40] personified.
[18:46] Yeah, there it is. Proverbs 8:17.
[18:48] Church, I wrote this up on my uh in my
[18:50] prayer closet. I got it on a post-it
[18:51] note. This is something I can pray for
[18:53] every day. And church, listen, you have
[18:54] a promise. This is a promise of God. If
[18:58] you seek God, not late.
[19:02] If you seek God early, it is thus sayeth
[19:04] the Lord. You got a promise. You'll find
[19:06] God for that day.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Now, it might come might not come right
[19:09] away, but sometime in that day, the
[19:11] Bible says you'll find God. What do he
[19:13] wants you to do that day? What's God's
[19:15] agenda for that day? Maybe somebody's
[19:17] sick and God wants you to heal. Maybe
[19:19] someone needs a financial help. You can
[19:20] help them out. But the Bible says, "If
[19:22] you seek me early, you'll find me." Is
[19:24] that right, Brother Rod? Amen. Three
[19:26] decades in the prison. Did you find him?
[19:29] Amen. We He told us about it. Praise
[19:31] God. And I told him he might give us
[19:32] some more. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[19:35] Especially with supernatural testimonies
[19:37] maybe in Brother Angley's ministry. And
[19:39] then speaking maybe maybe we'll talk
[19:41] about that maybe to the just to the men
[19:43] as well. But see angels are interested
[19:45] in that. They want to bring you skill.
[19:47] They want to bring you some
[19:48] understanding so you understand the ways
[19:50] of God. Last night Malach and I talked
[19:52] to this young man, good man, Brennan.
[19:54] And he's just struggling on uh Calvinism
[19:58] versus Armenianism. Finally said it
[20:00] right. Glory.
[20:02] But you know that that that's that that
[20:04] uh causes people confusion, right? When
[20:06] they don't understand something, it
[20:07] caused them confusion and frustration.
[20:09] Well, what does the Bible say? The Bible
[20:11] said God comes to give you skill. God
[20:13] sends his angel so you'll understand the
[20:16] situation.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Austin. Calvinism is
[20:20] God does it all. In other words, God's
[20:22] going to God's basically going to make
[20:24] it's already programmed. God's going to
[20:25] make you get saved. Armenianism is you
[20:27] got something to do in it. But they they
[20:28] they go to huge hyper extremes. The
[20:31] truth is always right down the middle.
[20:32] In other words, you're predestined, but
[20:34] God still gives you free more agency.
[20:36] And remember, I preached a sermon. Good
[20:38] question. I preached a sermon uh last
[20:39] year, and I showed by the Bible, your
[20:42] flesh has its own will. Your mind has
[20:45] its own will, and your soul has its own
[20:47] will. You got to you got to decide who's
[20:50] going to have uh whose will is going to
[20:52] be done. Every day, church, every day in
[20:55] all three eras, you got to decide who's
[20:56] going to get what what they want. Now,
[20:59] make sure your flesh don't win many
[21:00] days.
[21:02] Make sure and don't don't make sure your
[21:03] mind don't get the wrong thing at once
[21:04] and make sure it gets the word of God.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; And if your soul is saved, hallelujah,
[21:08] you're that's sealed to the day of your
[21:10] redemption. Praise God.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; It's actually your soul that brings the
[21:12] other two into subjection. Hallelujah.
[21:16] Yes. Now,
[21:20] uh let's look here. Uh
[21:23] Revelation 16 56 and 7. Revelation 16 56
[21:28] and 7. Look at these holy angels. How we
[21:30] doing on time? Oh my.
[21:34] See, they're interested. Angels now
[21:36] angels watch church for four for 6,000
[21:38] years. They've watched all these
[21:40] Christian martyrs die. They've watched
[21:42] these evil leaders seem like they
[21:43] succeed. Now, of course, we know they
[21:45] won't. But they watch all these
[21:47] injustices. And church, when God finally
[21:50] pours out the I'm sorry, the trumpets,
[21:52] the vials, the woes, the plagues, and
[21:55] then pours out his wrath on Babylon,
[21:57] watch what these angels say. And I heard
[21:59] the angel of the waters say, "Now, that
[22:01] might be another angel." That be that
[22:02] might be the ninth type of angel that I
[22:04] found. Okay, I haven't preached a sermon
[22:06] on that. Thou are righteous, O Lord,
[22:09] which art and was and shall be because
[22:11] thou hast judged us. So the angels can't
[22:14] wait till God judges this world. They've
[22:17] seen now look, they've seen all these
[22:19] fallen demons come down here and pervert
[22:21] this world, and they want to see God
[22:23] clean it up. That's their desire. That's
[22:25] our desire, too. Praise God.
[22:27] Now, still we pray for, you know, our
[22:28] enemies. We pray for them. We don't have
[22:30] judgment on them. But the angels want to
[22:32] see the judgments. They have a desire to
[22:34] see everything wrong made right.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Verse six, for they
[22:40] have shed the blood of the saints and
[22:42] the prophets, and thou has given them
[22:43] blood to drink, for they're worthy. And
[22:45] I heard another an another out of the
[22:47] altar say, even so, Lord God Almighty,
[22:50] true and righteous are thy judgments.
[22:52] Angels desire judgment. Angels desire uh
[22:56] we'd say a fair trial. Hallelujah.
[22:59] Angels desire a fair punishment, right?
[23:02] Revelation 19:1 and2. And after these
[23:04] things, I heard a great voice of much
[23:06] people in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah,
[23:07] salvation and glory and honor and power
[23:10] unto the Lord our God. For true and
[23:12] righteous are his judgments, for he hath
[23:14] judged the great which did
[23:15] corrupt the earth with her fornication,
[23:17] and avenged the blood of his servants at
[23:20] her hand." This is a mo much people in
[23:24] heaven. So this could be angels or it
[23:26] could be the souls under the altar as
[23:28] Revelation 6, the fifth seal talks
[23:29] about. But what are they rejoicing in?
[23:32] They're rejoicing that justice has been
[23:34] done.
[23:36] And church, the same is true in in a
[23:38] minor way for us. Brother Ram said,
[23:39] "Every single thing we do wrong, we'll
[23:41] get punished for it." God's not going to
[23:43] let us get by with just with with
[23:46] sinning. We're going to have to suffer
[23:47] and pay for our sins in a minor way. But
[23:50] remember, God always gives us mercy less
[23:52] than what we actually deserve.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; But the angels rejoice when all the
[23:57] punishments are poured out because
[23:59] they've watched all these demons possess
[24:01] people, deceive people for 6,000 years.
[24:05] And the Bible said they'll rejoice and
[24:06] give God glory that all wrongs will be
[24:09] made right.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:14] 1 Corinthians 4:9. Now, in my
[24:16] Corinthians series, I I paused right at
[24:18] chapter 12. I'm right in the middle of
[24:19] chapter 12. Maybe I'll pick it up
[24:21] Sunday. We'll see. But I already
[24:23] preached this verse slightly. For I
[24:25] think that God hath set forth us the
[24:28] apostles last as it were appointed to
[24:31] death.
[24:33] So he So Paul was saying we were uh
[24:35] appointed last after all the Old
[24:37] Testament here. We're last because we're
[24:40] appointed to die. Remember Paul thought
[24:41] they all thought the Lord would come in
[24:42] their day, right? They all thought it.
[24:46] For we are made a spectacle unto the
[24:48] world and to angels and to men. What a
[24:52] amazing statement this is. The word
[24:54] spectacle is where we get the word
[24:56] theater from.
[24:58] We are made a theater or show or a
[25:01] public display to men and angels. So God
[25:04] has a stage set out and the sinners, all
[25:06] the sinners and all the angels are
[25:09] watching you and I on stage. Did you
[25:12] know that church? You're in a play.
[25:14] God wrote this play before the
[25:16] foundation of the world and we know the
[25:17] end. Hallelujah.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; We just got to know our parts. Brother
[25:20] Jesse, what's my part? It's right here.
[25:22] That's in I'm sorry. I left my Bible in
[25:24] the back. Let me get your Bible, buddy.
[25:26] Yeah, we know our part. It's the part
[25:28] where we praise God. Where we live by
[25:30] every word that proceeds out of the
[25:32] mouth of God. What do I say? I forgot my
[25:33] part. The Bible said the Holy Ghost will
[25:35] bring all things to your remembrance.
[25:37] Hallelujah. You'll remember your part.
[25:39] Just stay in tune with the word of God.
[25:41] Hallelujah.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:44] Now church, look at that. And this this
[25:46] is fits perfectly with brother Ram's
[25:48] story about the three Hebrew children,
[25:49] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo. They
[25:51] were being they were chained up. They
[25:53] were being taken to the fiery furnace.
[25:54] And brother Ram dramatized in heaven.
[25:56] And Ga said, Gabriel came up and said,
[25:58] "Lord, I'll go down there." He said,
[25:59] "No, Gabriel, step back." Michael came
[26:01] up and said, "Lord, I'll go." "No, no,
[26:02] Michael, step back." All the angels came
[26:05] back and God stopped and said, "No, no,
[26:07] Michael. Gabriel, my children, I know
[26:09] they're in trouble. This is a God-sized
[26:11] job."
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to go
[26:15] down. And the Bible said God came down
[26:17] on the wings of cherubam. Angels.
[26:19] Hallelujah.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, because angels always bring
[26:22] deliverance to the people. Hallelujah.
[26:24] And remember Nebuchadnezzar, as we heard
[26:26] on Sunday, I put I thought I put in
[26:28] three.
[26:30] He said there's four in there. And
[26:31] there's one likened to the son of God.
[26:34] God came down. He stood by his people
[26:36] that believed in prayer. And God will
[26:38] stand by everyone who doesn't want to be
[26:40] an idoltor.
[26:43] Yeah, brother Chris.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Which one? Daniel.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; That's about uh 500 years before maybe
[26:56] 600 or 700 years before Jesus.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. One likened the son of God. Yes.
[27:08] Yes.
[27:18] Yeah, that's a great point, brother.
[27:19] Yeah, one liken of the son of God. So,
[27:20] there must have been some type of truth
[27:21] made known. I mean, of course, there was
[27:23] uh Davidic prophecies about God having a
[27:25] son, right? A virgin shall conceive.
[27:27] He'll be a son. He'll be a mighty God.
[27:29] Uh wonderful counselor, prince of peace.
[27:31] Remember Isaiah, I think it's Isaiah 7
[27:33] and Isaiah chapter 9. Good question.
[27:34] Give to class, brother. Good question.
[27:36] Yeah. So, they knew and even even
[27:38] Solomon asked that question. He said,
[27:39] "Lord, what's your name? And what is
[27:40] your son's name?" Hallelujah. So, there
[27:43] was a revelation. I think that's in
[27:44] Proverbs 30 if I'm not mistaken or 31.
[27:47] They knew God. There was God and God was
[27:50] going to have a son. They knew that,
[27:51] brother. So, it's one like the son of
[27:53] God. Hallelujah. Amen. And that was
[27:56] God's theophony there. Hallelujah. I
[27:58] hear it calling me tonight. Praise God.
[28:00] Amen. So, notice, church, the angels are
[28:02] watching. The angels are waiting there
[28:03] to step off on the stage and help you,
[28:05] brother Austin. Angels are waiting
[28:06] there. They're all just waiting. When is
[28:08] it my Lord? Is it my turn to go on
[28:10] stage? Can I go help brother Jesse? Can
[28:11] I go help Malachi on the job? The angels
[28:13] are waiting. They're just waiting on God
[28:15] for orders. Oh, church, you ought to be
[28:16] thankful tonight. Praise God. God puts
[28:19] you on the stage. Everyone's watching
[28:20] you. Everyone's watching the bride.
[28:22] Hallelujah.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that, church. God's
[28:25] watching the bride and Israel.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Remember we went over the ceiling angel
[28:29] in Revelation 7. The angels are holding
[28:32] back the winds, right, of the great
[28:34] tribulation. The angels are holding them
[28:37] back until what? God seals them. The a
[28:40] the sealing angels seal them with the
[28:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; So, Israel's on the stage and God's
[28:46] bride is on the stage. Hallelujah.
[28:49] And God's angels are placed and at the
[28:51] right moment, God will send them onto
[28:53] the scene and he'll cause he'll cause
[28:55] I'll say like this. He'll cause angels
[28:57] to rejoice. Hallelujah. The holy angels.
[28:59] Hallelujah.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; When people get saved and people get the
[29:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Church,
[29:05] angels are watching your life.
[29:07] Hallelujah.
[29:08] This is a cosmic drama or a cosmic play.
[29:12] See, demons are watching. When when can
[29:14] I uh tempt Brother Rod? When can I tempt
[29:17] Brother Jesse? When can I tempt Brother
[29:18] Jose? The demons are watching, too.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; And remember, they got to get permission
[29:22] from God as well.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; So, they're all watching. When can I get
[29:26] my place? When can I get when when can I
[29:29] do this? When can I do that? Church,
[29:30] we've got to trust God. We got to know
[29:32] that if God allows a trial, then he'll
[29:34] provide a solution. He'll provide an
[29:36] antidote. He'll provide a way out.
[29:38] Hallelujah.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Because he allowed the test to come.
[29:44] And remember, church, all of this is
[29:45] teaching the angels. Brother Chris, they
[29:47] want to understand what is real
[29:48] salvation. What I wonder wonder what it
[29:50] must feel like to be truly forgiven,
[29:53] to truly have a conscience free from
[29:56] sin, where the devil can't bring up your
[29:58] past life on you anymore. And the church
[30:01] said,
[30:02] &gt;&gt; "In other words, you don't have a
[30:03] conscience of your sins anymore because
[30:06] you're so forgiven. You're so in love
[30:07] with Jesus, you don't have a conscience
[30:09] of your past life."
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. The
[30:14] angels want to learn. They want to look
[30:16] into that. Well, what is that prophecy?
[30:18] What what is the Holy Ghost really doing
[30:20] in a believer's life? What is it really
[30:22] like to be saved?
[30:25] That's why we sing that song. That's why
[30:26] I chose that song. And then the angels
[30:28] all will listen. For they cannot join
[30:30] the song of the redeemed. They've never
[30:33] been lost. So they they can't sing
[30:35] along. Church, have you noticed all that
[30:37] they do is praise God. God, you've
[30:38] judged God. And God, you're the great
[30:40] one. That's all they do. They'll never
[30:42] be able to join your song. Not only does
[30:44] God judge, not only is God great, but
[30:46] God saved me from my life of sin. God
[30:50] saved me from hell. Hallelujah. God made
[30:52] me a real believer. God empowered me
[30:54] with the Holy Ghost to overcome demon
[30:56] powers. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't have to live as a slave to sin
[31:02] my whole life. I could be a overcomer by
[31:05] the grace of God.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; You shook hands with a bunch of
[31:08] overcomers last Wednesday night.
[31:09] Remember that? God bless you, overcomer.
[31:11] Remember? Hallelujah. I'm almost done.
[31:20] So the angels rejoice. They when you get
[31:22] saved, they long to understand your
[31:24] salvation. They long to understand what
[31:26] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost like.
[31:29] And I think I'll just close because I
[31:30] only got a couple minutes here. Mark
[31:32] 13:32 and 33. Mark 13:32 and 33. Did you
[31:37] guys read that chapter last was it last
[31:39] Monday night or the night the Monday
[31:40] before?
[31:48] Mark 13:32.
[31:51] But of that day and hour
[31:55] knoweth no man, no not the angels which
[31:58] are in heaven, neither the Son, but the
[32:02] Father.
[32:04] Take ye heed, watch and pray, for you
[32:07] know not when the time is. Now we
[32:11] believe according to God's prophet,
[32:12] Brother Brandham, putting the scriptures
[32:14] together, prophets come to reveal the
[32:16] word of God, right? They make known
[32:17] hidden things. So, we believe God's
[32:19] prophet showed us the rapture is
[32:21] pre-tribulation.
[32:23] Because the word caught away means to
[32:25] snatch away quickly. Why would God need
[32:27] to snatch away quickly his bride?
[32:29] Because the Bible said sudden
[32:30] destruction comes after that.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; He's got to quickly get them out of
[32:34] there because then he's going to pour
[32:35] his wrath upon the unbelievers.
[32:38] And God always rescues his people.
[32:39] Hallelujah. Before he pours out his
[32:41] wrath, his wrath. God will not allow uh
[32:44] the righteous to suffer the wrath with
[32:46] the wicked.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's thus sayith the Lord.
[32:49] Hallelujah. That's God's word.
[32:50] Hallelujah. Not me. That's the L. It's
[32:52] the word of the Lord. Hallelujah. But
[32:54] notice, church,
[32:57] as we approach the rapture, we are going
[33:00] through birth pains. We saw it with CO.
[33:02] Now we're seeing with AI technology. Rod
[33:04] sent me another article there where
[33:05] they're trying to get AI. Now, we've
[33:06] seen them for years, but it's closer
[33:08] than it's ever been before. Europe's
[33:10] trying to get you to do a digital one on
[33:11] your phone. Well, pretty soon it's going
[33:12] to get in, you know, pretty soon it's
[33:14] going to be inside or whatever it may
[33:15] be. But church, we know with each time,
[33:18] each test, it's a harder birth pain.
[33:20] It's a harder birth pain. And the angels
[33:22] are holding back those trumpets. So
[33:25] imagine, church, the earth right now,
[33:27] angels are holding back on all sides.
[33:29] They're holding back the wrath of God.
[33:33] This nation has killed over 70 million
[33:34] babies and abortions. That's just what
[33:36] they counted.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; The wrath of God is on this nation. Now,
[33:39] what am I praying for? I told you I'm
[33:41] just praying for a generational revival
[33:42] in certain pockets of the world. This
[33:44] nation will never have a national
[33:46] revival. It's too far gone. It's all
[33:48] right. Brother Ram said, "Thus sayith
[33:49] the Lord." She had her last chance in
[33:50] 1956 because it was 50 years after the
[33:53] Zuza Street revival. 50 is the number of
[33:54] Jubilee. She turned down her Jubilee.
[33:57] And that was the year Elvis got big.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; They chose rock and roll over God, over
[34:02] Christ. They chose the wrong king, the
[34:03] king of rock and roll over Jesus Christ,
[34:05] the King of Kings. And church, just to
[34:08] throw throw this in there, I heard a
[34:09] good preacher say this that no kings
[34:10] protest
[34:12] &gt;&gt; on last Saturday, whatever it was that
[34:14] was saying, "We don't want Jesus's king
[34:16] because they dress up like LGBTQ and all
[34:19] this nonsense." Whatever it is, they
[34:21] were all dressed up like that. It was
[34:23] saying, "We don't want even Jesus to be
[34:24] our king." But I'm here to say Jesus is
[34:27] the king and he's our king. Hallelujah.
[34:30] And he will reign over me. Praise God.
[34:32] His kingdom will also reign in me.
[34:34] Praise God. Amen.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is. Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within you. Jesus
[34:40] said, "Hallelujah. That's my king. King
[34:42] Jesus." Hallelujah.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; He's holy forever. Praise God.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; But imagine all the angels take their
[34:49] position. Now, church, the rapture comes
[34:51] when the last bride member is sealed by
[34:54] the Holy Ghost. That's when the rapture
[34:57] happens because the Bible said Jesus has
[34:58] to shorten the time so that somebody's
[35:01] saved. Now, church, picture this. Every
[35:03] time somebody gets the Holy Ghost when
[35:04] you got it there in Akan sister an angel
[35:07] ceiling angel came down touched you
[35:09] filled you with the Holy Ghost and then
[35:10] went back to heaven.
[35:13] So think about that in the spiritual
[35:14] realm the angels hold back then there's
[35:16] other angels coming down hallelujah to
[35:18] to South America right to Canada filling
[35:21] people with the Holy Ghost. There's
[35:22] sealing angels all around the world but
[35:24] one day it's going to be the last
[35:26] sealing angel
[35:28] &gt;&gt; and the angels will be up there in
[35:29] heaven.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Is this the end?
[35:32] And one of those archangels is like, "Is
[35:34] it going to be me?" Because the shouts
[35:37] are he's gone forth, but they still see
[35:39] Jesus over there on the throne. He's
[35:40] seated on the throne. Archangel is
[35:44] getting a little nervous.
[35:47] Going to be you. I hope it's me. Is it
[35:50] going to be you? Did he tell you
[35:51] anything? No. No. God didn't. You didn't
[35:52] tell me nothing. I'm waiting just like
[35:54] you are. I don't know the day or the
[35:55] hour. You know the scripture.
[35:57] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[36:01] At some glorious moment as all the
[36:03] archangels stand there, they're going to
[36:05] watch our Lord Jesus
[36:08] stand up.
[36:11] And now mercy is finished for the
[36:13] Gentiles.
[36:15] And he'll say, "Archangel, maybe it's
[36:17] Michael, right? He's only named one.
[36:19] There's princes or archangels. Michael,
[36:22] come here, sir."
[36:26] Michael's like, "Oh, I knew it was me.
[36:29] A you lucky guy.
[36:31] They because they desire they desire to
[36:33] be the one to do this. Michael, come
[36:35] here. Yes, my lord. Preparing for
[36:39] reporting for service.
[36:42] Michael, it is your time.
[36:45] Cry out your voice to the dead in
[36:47] Christ. Now, church, look at this. He's
[36:49] going to call out to the dead in Christ.
[36:51] Sound your voice. He's going to say,
[36:53] "Rise, dead in Christ." But all those
[36:55] dead in Christ, their theophanes are up
[36:57] here in heaven.
[36:59] So he's going to call and he's going to
[37:00] say, "Let the dead in Christ rise." And
[37:03] all those millions, maybe billion
[37:06] Christians, theophanes are going to go
[37:08] swoop down to the earth, find all those
[37:11] chemicals, and they're going to combine
[37:12] with their glorified bodies. And they'll
[37:14] be walking around. We'll see Brother
[37:16] Brent, it's Brother Bram, it's Brother
[37:18] Angley, it's St. Paul. Oh, it's almost
[37:21] time for the rapture, church. Imagine.
[37:23] Hallelujah. What it's going to be like.
[37:26] We'll see the dead in Christ and we
[37:27] know, "Oh, it's going home time. Let's
[37:29] get ready to go see Jesus." Hallelujah.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; And finally, Jesus will say,
[37:38] "Prumpet angel, prepare your trumpet."
[37:42] He'll be like, "Yes, I knew that was me.
[37:44] Glory to God. I'm ready, my Lord.
[37:49] Get ready to blow. My bride is ready.
[37:51] Every redeemed bride member is filled
[37:53] with the Holy Ghost and her body is
[37:55] ready to be swallowed up in life.
[37:57] Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Get ready to sound. It's time. And when
[38:02] you sound, I go down this time.
[38:04] Hallelujah. All the theophanes are
[38:06] emptied out of heaven. But there's Jesus
[38:08] in the form. Hallelujah. He said, now
[38:11] I'm going down to get my bride.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, "Sound
[38:17] angel." And Jesus flies down on the
[38:19] wings of a cherub, meets us in the air.
[38:22] The angel sounds and we're swallowed up
[38:25] like a lick of fire. And then we rise to
[38:28] meet our Lord in the air. There's Martin
[38:30] Luther, John Wesley. Hallelujah. Brother
[38:34] Brandham, all the saints, and then we
[38:36] finally see Jesus. And Jesus says, "Well
[38:39] done. Let us go to the marriage supper
[38:42] of the lamb. Come with me, my bride."
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; And we all go up. Be seated, bride. It's
[38:50] time for communion.
[38:53] Hallelujah. And all the angels around
[38:55] about the throne.
[38:58] Oh yes, I knew he'd make it. Yes, I knew
[38:59] she'd make it. She was faithful on
[39:01] earth. She confessed Jesus before men.
[39:04] Jesus will confess her before me.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; I was a witness of the power of God.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Let the church stand. Hallelujah. Praise
[39:12] God. musicians can come.
[39:14] The angels desire to know the time of
[39:17] the rapture as well, but they've got to
[39:19] wait just like we've got to wait.
[39:22] All heaven can't wait for that moment,
[39:26] including the angels, just like all the
[39:28] believers on earth can't wait
[39:32] for the voice of the archangel.
[39:34] Dead in Christ, rise.
[39:37] Trumpet sounding angel, blow the
[39:38] trumpet.
[39:40] It's time to meet my bride in the air.
[39:42] How many want to be ready when that
[39:44] comes? Praise God. May our desires match
[39:47] the desire of Christ and of the angels.
[39:50] The angels desire to look into church
[39:53] the joy, the victory, the strength that
[39:56] you have, church. They desire to know
[39:58] what is salvation like. What is it like
[40:00] to be totally forgiven?
[40:03] What is it like to have God live inside
[40:05] you?
[40:07] To be sealed with the Holy Ghost. What
[40:08] is that like? Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; They don't know, but we know. Praise
[40:12] God. And church, if if there's a chance,
[40:14] I'm going to make sure I go shake my
[40:16] guardian angel's hand, Brother Rod, and
[40:17] say, "Thank you for saving me from
[40:19] drowning. I really appreciate that.
[40:23] Hallelujah. That was a great That was a
[40:24] great wonderful work. Thank you for
[40:26] obeying God, saving my life. Thank you."
[40:28] Say, "Yes, sir. It was my joy to serve
[40:31] my Lord Jesus." Thank you. Hallelujah. I
[40:35] would not have met Brother Rod. I would
[40:36] not have met Austin if it wasn't that
[40:38] for that angel saving me. Praise God.
[40:41] God is good, church. Let's bow our
[40:43] heads.
[40:44] Father God, we thank you for tonight,
[40:46] Lord. The desires of the angels, Lord
[40:49] God.
[40:50] Lord, they're waiting just like we're
[40:52] waiting, Lord God.
[40:54] One of those archangels is going to be
[40:57] so blessed to be the angel to call forth
[41:00] the dead in Christ.
[41:02] One of those trumpet angels will blow
[41:04] that final gentile trumpet
[41:08] and we which are alive and remain will
[41:10] be changed in a moment and a twinkle of
[41:13] an eye and meet the saints in the air.
[41:16] Lord God, what a privilege, what a
[41:18] blessing.
[41:20] So our desire, Lord God, is to live true
[41:23] to you.
[41:25] Our desire, Lord God,
[41:29] is to enjoy our salvation and the
[41:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost. For the
[41:34] angels wish they could understand it.
[41:36] They look into it.
[41:38] They want to know what it's like.
[41:41] Oh, God.
[41:44] Strengthen us, Lord God, to live the way
[41:46] we ought to live, Lord Jesus.
[41:49] But we're so blessed to know the things
[41:51] we know, Lord God. Just make it more
[41:52] real, Lord, as time goes on. May the
[41:55] Bible become more real to us, Lord God.
[41:58] May the sermons of Brother Brandham
[41:59] become more real to us. May the sermons
[42:02] here at Bride of Christ Fellowship
[42:03] become more real to us. God, open our
[42:06] eyes. I pray that we could see into that
[42:08] unseen realm, Lord God. That these
[42:10] angels desire to fight for us. They
[42:13] rejoice at our salvation. They rejoice
[42:15] at our deliverance because they see us
[42:18] set free
[42:20] from the villains of the past, their
[42:22] enemies of the past. They've already
[42:23] defeated and they know we'll finally be
[42:25] defeated and sent to hell which was made
[42:28] for the devil and his angels.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God, strengthen us here tonight.
[42:33] Lord, if there's anyone in need of
[42:35] prayer, deliverance, I pray you'd send
[42:37] your delivering angel tonight, Lord God.
[42:40] Hallelujah for the glory of God. I I
[42:43] trust and pray this message was a
[42:45] strength to your people. Take this word
[42:48] now. May they meditate on it tonight,
[42:50] tomorrow, Lord, or some other thought
[42:52] from the Holy Ghost. And may they be
[42:54] strengthened Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[42:56] till we meet again on Sunday, should the
[42:58] Lord, Terry, help us to watch and pray.
[43:02] For no man knows the day or the hour,
[43:03] not the sun. No, not the angels. But
[43:06] they're waiting just like we're waiting,
[43:08] Lord God, for the Son of God to stand.
[43:12] Come down, Lord, and meet us in the air.
[43:14] Snatch us away from the earth.
[43:16] [Music]
[43:18] Bless us God tonight as we worship in
[43:20] Jesus Christ's name.
