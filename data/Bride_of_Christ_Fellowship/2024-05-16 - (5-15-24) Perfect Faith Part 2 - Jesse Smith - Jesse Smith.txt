TRANSCRIPT
========================================
part two what a blessing to be in the house of the Lord thank you musicians Mal M I'm sorry Mali and I Lydia rarely ever practice so they just know how to wing it you know by God's grace special gift there son hallelujah hallelujah Mark chapter 11 I guess that's his bad on life brother William he's got to deal with the dad that don't give him much practice you know so if that's his worst battle praise the Lord hallelujah Mark 11:22 hallelujah how many enjoyed uh perfect Faith last week by God's grace everybody enjoyed that that was a real blessing to me and we're going to look at it here a little little bit more further here tonight I I knew last week about while preaching I thought I'll never get to the end of this so I kind of knew I'd have a part two so let's look to the Lord here tonight we'll read our our verses here brother R mes of course uh so we want to just read this uh brother man said these always these scriptures always turned me around until the Lord showed him what it meant to speak to the mountain and it was very similar to speaking the squirrels brother Bram said God challenged me to speak those squirrels God did wasn't from his own idea wasn't from his own thoughts he was just out hunting he said God challenged me to speak those squirrels I thought is that scripture I was thinking today I said is that scriptural and Jesus said where is your faith you could have spoke to the storm right Jesus sometimes he'll challenge our faith Hallelujah we have to be walking with the Lord then we'll know exactly how to do it by God's grace Hallelujah that's right so Mark 11:22 and uh let's read we'll read 22 and 23 together okay and then I'll read uh I'll read 24 25 26 because it's a little bit lengthy but I think I like to hear your voice on 23 that's the the key verse here in one way um so let's read 22 and 23 1 2 3 and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith what a promise my goodness what a promise of course we know this relies on conditions almost every promise of God is conditional Hallelujah when it applies to us us receiving from God but I'll read 24 25 26 we'll look at this a little further tonight brother BR says this is all dependent upon forgiveness Hallelujah said if you want to speak the word if you want to see God's spirit move it all rests on forgiveness because of these verses therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses may God add His blessings to read his word you can be seated there by God's grace sorry I got a little bit of runny nose so if you hear me got to blow my nose I'm very sorry it's just kind of running so forgive me just another Pulpit manner that I struggle with there by God's grace so so we want to look here uh tonight by God's grace at uh the perfect Faith Hallelujah and like I said I'll share on with a little testimony that was just just a sweet little way the Lord worked here in my life just this morning you know I wasn't even thinking about this sermon this morning you know so I just really feel it was led of the Lord thankful for God's Amazing Grace uh Lord willing next Wednesday or maybe Sunday we'll look at uh the breach you I'll be listening to the breach beautiful message my goodness the breach between um the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals um so i' like to maybe Lord willing Minister on that on Sunday we'll see how the Lord leads uh by God's grace but last week you know I did a little a little further teaching uh again as I've tried to teach our church that perfect faith is simply a perfect revelation that's all it is it's just an anointing where God has anointed you with the Holy Spirit to know God's will that's what perfect faith is brother Ram tells us and I use a lot of verses brother from works as Faith expressed brother Ram said you'll never work your way into it you don't work yourself up into these things he said if you ever got faith it's a gift from God to you Hallelujah and so uh you know that's one thing I've I've Just Seen around the message you know some some camps of churches are so preaching about faith and marage Ires they put all the they put all the pressure on you to believe but Jesus you know Jesus doesn't do it that way Jesus reveals it to you now he'll challenge you right but if he's challenged you then you know he wants you to speak it hallelujah hallelujah and so you know we see it's also sometimes misused where people will say uh well the L Lord says you're going to get healed and then they'll die now they didn't they didn't say thus sayith the Lord but they said the Lord's going to heal them and then they die and it's a great uh confusion to some I know I know it's a some block to numerous people because they've emailed me about it and asked me about it I know it's a stumbling block to some people um and so we got to be uh we got to be a sharper on the word of God brother man said even says in this message perfect Faith he said I want to try to rub out some of some of this unbelief right some of this Elementary uh understanding he said I want to kind of rub that off and he said I want to go a little deeper in the word of God hallelujah so that's what we trying to do we trying to understand that there sometimes God will make it known to us the will of God and then other times we may not not know for sure but we just feel a leading of the Lord that God's going to do something and if we're not prophets then we can't expect to have visions right um but there will be people that have visions because the Acts chapter 2 says that your young men will dream dreams your old men will see Visions Hallelujah does it say old men because that would put some of us in that category Hallelujah let me just check that by God's grace you know because you have a right to claim God's word hallelujah let me read that just uh just as a I just thought about that you can you can claim that I heard a preacher say that at brother Cam's church last week it should come to pass in the last days sayith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy Hallelujah so if you're a son or a daughter you can ask God to fulfill his word hallelujah how many say God fulfilled in my life amen me too Hallelujah I want Lord pour out your spirit on me Hallelujah I'm a son I'm a do I'm a son Hallelujah I got daughters amen and your young men shall see Visions all right so I I I can say that too Hallelujah I want to see a vision Lord If It Be Your Will and your old men shall dream dreams Hallelujah and on your servants and your handmaids uh hand I'm sorry handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy amen so we basically see all of us have a right to say God pour out your spirit on me young men Visions I could say Lord give me a vision uh older men could say Lord give me dreams Hallelujah and if you're in between say give me both hallelujah how about that if you're in between say God do all of it amen pour out all your blessings on me Hallelujah and so we want to take advantage of this and we just want to get a better understanding and at some point church I do want to put a video out about this I believe it's a very important subject because brother R says you can never major on a minor you can't major on Divine Healing and if you don't got that then you're not even saved now that's the way some people teach it they just go a little too far and I understand the quotes that they're looking at you know brother R said Mark 16 is the Keystone of the church it's one of the five identifications of the church but yet we know we're not saved by our gifts we're saved by our relationship with The Giver of the gifts that's right right but some people go so heavy on that they start majoring on a minor Hallelujah but we got to find the right balance I believe the Holy Spirit brings that right balance amen amen I feel like this you know as I've seen it in my life I feel like in those moments when God wants to do Supernatural he'll bring me into that type of Faith he'll bring me into it uh brother M calls it desperation amen hallelujah amen he said we'll get desperate God will bring us to desperation and that's the time when we're believing we're pressing Through the Bible said uh we must uh press into the kingdom of God he said the violent taken by force amen and of course that's not violence against one another it's violence against Satan hallelujah it's fighting against the devil it's fighting away unbelief is fighting away uh evil spirits praise God that's the kind of Victory God wants us to have Hallelujah so in our lives as I said last week we we may not always have the ability to say thus sayith the Lord in fact I don't know if I've ever said that myself I just felt like I felt like the Lord said it but I could be wrong but what what I find in our lives is we simply have a strong urge from the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and then in those moments we'll we'll speak God's word right we'll just feel compelled like God has led me to do this God's brought me here I I haven't brought myself to this I feel like God's leading me to do this Hallelujah and as I said you know I went listen to Simon's testimonies you know uh did anybody go listen to Simon's testimony after last Wednesday night anybody do it okay I listened to it today at work when I had a little my little break I was listening to brother Simon he looks so young and know you know he don't have that beard and everything like that and like brother Simon look like you're 20 years younger I remember when we recorded that testimony right here like brother Mike MOSI but Simon see in in numerous places uh one of the guys he was working with fell two stories off scaffolding and landed on his shoulder and and said they're all standing around and he said the Holy Spirit came on him and he spoke healing he said I speak healing in the name of Jesus and uh they and then they called 911 he he was doing that death rattle brother Simon said he was doing the death rattle he he's heard somebody die before they do that death rattle Simon prayed in the name of Jesus Christ and he instantly just looked a little better they took him to the hospital he said the next day a guy that was 6' feet5 come up to brother Simon and said were you the guy Simon kind of dramatized it he's like were you he was like the guy was looking Simon was looking up and the guy's looking down like were you the guy that prayed for this so and so Simon's like yeah I prayed for him you know Simon's bold like a lion that's why I love Simon Hallelujah he's gonna have great rewards in heaven Hallelujah I believe Simon's like yeah he said yeah by the grace of God I prayed for him he said I want to let you know I went to the hospital he said and the doctor said he would have died except something changed and he said uh something changed there he should have died he said something changed he said said and then later he said a few minutes later after he got to the hospital he was up walking around and the doctor said why didn't he die he said the doctors he said the doctor said it was a miracle I was there the six foot five guy and Simon's like Simon's like you go tell him he said Jesus Christ spared his life amen Simon spoke the word amen hallelujah amen and I told you Simon uh prayed for my nephew he was born he was one week old and they were going to have surgery CU he had a hole in his heart he had three other things wrong in his heart my little nephew and Simon said he was on the road to go pray for him and he got a call from Sister Karen Sanders and Karen Sanders told him a testimonies after testimonies for two hours straight and Simon said by the time I got there my faith was Skyhigh see how God does that's what I'm saying when God wants you to do something God will lead you to it Hallelujah he'll build up your faith for that time and season Hallelujah and so Simon said Simon said they got there but he said his my brother and his and his wife were just sad and crying and Simon said let's pray and Simon said the Holy Ghost fell while they were praying and uh Simon said I believe God heard our prayer I believe he's going to be well and then uh uh Simon said brother he said brother let me tell you some testimonies sister Karen told me and Simon said he just told oh yeah Simon said you know what um he said if Jesus was here he couldn't even heal your little baby and my brother's like what and Simon's like that's because Jesus already healed him hallelujah amen and that's when my brother stood up and said that boy is healed amen hallelujah and so they they took him the next day to the doctor they did another 4D scan and said we don't know what's happened all four conditions have gone he doesn't need surgery amen hallelujah and there was another one you know I can't remember the other one but those were the two that kind of stuck with me as I was you know resting there on my break resting from all the one million questions for my my students there by God's grace but I just thought it was a great example of how God leads you to speak the word God will lead you to have perfect Faith amen just like the Rapture how could Enoch get raptured how could Elijah get raptured because God gave him faith for that Hallelujah is it and how many believe God's going to give you faith for the Rapture amen aren't you following the message of your hour Hallelujah didn't didn't the spirit of Elijah come and minister to us hallelujah don't we get to listen to the spirit of Elijah on tape Hallelujah direct us back to the word of the word of God and church don't we know that our hearts have been turned back to the apostolic fathers hallelujah amen amen you know let's be honest you know we went to denominations they didn't turn our hearts back to the word it was the Holy Spirit it was this message that turned our hearts back to the word of God hallelujah amen we grew up in denominations we never heard him say thus says the Lord we come to the message we hear Brother Maham say thus sayi the Lord amen then we see it come to pass Hallelujah so how can we doubt anymore like that song says how can we doubt anymore amen we trust God hallelujah we trust God Amen and uh you know I thought I thought it'd be good you know I want to read this too you know with my wife shared this with me months ago darling and I'm sorry I didn't read it but from the message communion I just want to bring a little balance to this here not every time do we have to speak the word right you know we've had you know I told you this before but we used to have people at our church that you know when when we were sick or my wife was sick or the kids were sick or I was sick you know it would just be a little frustrating but they'd walk up and say just speak the word brother Jesse I'm like well why don't you speak it right and then that person will get sick and they never speak the word and then they're sick two weeks they lay in their bed you know uh why don't you just speak the word it's it's a little it's immature you know it's it's like a simple uh it's a easy fix they want instead of because it takes sometimes it takes a while to find the will of God and people just want an easy fix they just want microwave religion let's get it over with let's do this let's get it over with and but that's not how the spirit of God always works sometimes God makes you uh wrestle it out brother bam says brother mam calls it sweating out sometimes I got I got to sweat out way more than you he says because you have hundreds of people thousands of people coming in for prayer requests but I like this quote my wife shared with me um brother brother B says in 1962 communion there was a certain Minister today I heard him he on a he was on a radio broadcast broadcast sorry and when he come to our country he had a great sinus trouble and they were talking about an operation and they said they was going to do this and that and cut him on and operate you remember that one honey and take part of the sinus glands out which would sink his face in so this is what he's saying the doctors are saying we're going to we're going to we have surgery and then your face is going to sink in and he said he taken pills by the barrel anybody ever taken pills by the barrel thank God I haven't he said look like there were so many pills he had to take but when he come to a good Christian doctor this the story about's telling now this is the same man that said speak the word this is the same man that spoke squirrels into existence Hallelujah he said so he brother man said the man went to a bad doctor then he went to a Christian doctor and the Christian doctor said let's forget the pills and let's forget the operation and let's build up the body so it can resist the sinuses brother Ram said that's it and the church said right how many times on how many times on tape have I heard brother Ram say just pray for me I'm a little sore tonight and I've got a real B bad cold but just pray for me why didn't brother Ram just say I'm a prophet I'm speaking the word in fact I I fact I heard I read him today brother man said Satan keeps trying to give me this coal but I keep giving it back well he keeps giving it to me he said but God will give me the victory why didn't he just speak the word one time it's all done because he's human because God gives you Grace God's grace is sufficient in every trial and God is not your Aaron boy or my Aaron boy God does what he wants Hallelujah that's the balance you don't hear you don't hear that quote so honey thank you right we can all say thank you sister Christen Hallelujah oh you don't have to say that but sure I appreciate that darling that's just a good balance out quote it just balances it out there was one time in 65 brother said I just come back from the mountains I was up there hunting and I was saying with some friends he said and they overfed me and I'm sick and I got a stomach ache here tonight but I still got to preach anyway why didn't he just speak the word to his stomach condition because you got to wait on God for it there's any lesson we learn we must learn to wait on the Lord hallelujah like like I told you that story you know like in the CS Lewis he said uh I don't keep God in my pocket and I can just bring God out whenever I want to use it you know that's not God doesn't fit in my pocket he's the creator of the universe Hallelujah I got to fit in his pocket hallelujah amen that's right I want to fit in his plans praise God I don't want to fit God into my plans I want God I want to be a part of God's plans Hallelujah can't just bring them out whenever I want well I'll speak in tongues now well I I'll prophesy now I'll only do it when God leads me to do it Hallelujah do I want to walk in faith yes do I want to walk in the Holy Spirit absolutely but I'm not the one in control of him he's in control of me so there you go Saints Hallelujah not every problem is speak in the mountain sometimes you just need a good Christian doctor and you got to build up your body with some healthy food and exercise and the church said and then resist that sinus that sinus trouble Hallelujah now I want to just real quick let's go over those examples again a brother Ram talking about perfect Faith uh remember this from last Wednesday I kind of ended with it I was I was real shocked at what time I I was looking at and I went really late last week so I made a little promise to myself I'm not going to preach that long tonight I'm GNA try to keep my promise yeah Amen brother M said the woman that touched him she said if I can only touch the board of His Garment I'll be made well he said she actually believed it she felt within herself the blood issue stuffed and Jesus had turned around and said who touch me that perfect Faith the same perfect Faith tonight will touch Jesus just as it did then hallelujah amen but look it look church it was already in her everybody see that she already had the perfect Faith she knew if I could just touch him I'll be made well Hallelujah so see she had the Revelation first that's right she had perfect Faith first she'd have to work her way into it God gave it to her amen after what 12 or 18 years of of bleeding for some reason after 12 or 18 years whichever I think the story I think there's two different women like that why is it after 12 years why is it after 18 years because that's God's plan Hallelujah because God doesn't want to do it when you want to do it God does it when he wants to do it Hallelujah we got to be faithful and wait till he drops that Revelation in our heart Hallelujah that's the first one brother uses who's got perfect Faith the woman who touched a garment the next one he said Joshua spoke to the son that was perfect Faith well just like it's just like just like uh Moses how could Moses control nature how could he call flies and fleas and and and darkness over the land and kill the firstborn and you know by the angel of the Lord how can you do that because God told him first brother R said remember did was it what brother say about Moses he was living so close to God Pharaoh didn't know what to do with him hallelujah hallelujah that's why he could speak the word of God that's why he had perfect Faith because God always told him what to do and that's what Jesus said Jesus said I do nothing except the father shows me first Hallelujah that's why he walked in perfect faith and that's how we can walk in perfect faith when God shows us what to do when God leads us to do something Hallelujah now we'd like him a little bit more closer in between right how many could say raise your hand and say Lord I like I like those Miracles and I like the times you speak the word through me I like it be more often that's that was brother R's prayer in that sermon he said we see Apostolic times he said but we want to see more of it oh hallelujah amen that's the believer's desire Lord let me be so and to with the holy spirit so you can speak through me Hallelujah you know someone just put a comment on my my Sunday sermon about Behold thy mother and they said wow they said uh you're truly called to preach I said well I'm glad somebody knows that Hallelujah sometimes I doubt brother William battle battle Satan you know I got to fight him off but she said you know from this time stamp to that that these 10 minutes in there I felt like you were preaching to me it was right to my situation and right for the internet the internet need to hear that so I'll tell you whoever God wants to use may God use it Hallelujah whoever whoever wants to hear from God they can hear from him remember our gifts and our poll operates the preaching hallelujah amen of course Joshua would have been told by God or would have felt the unction of God to speak to the speak to the son stand still then he said all Jesus's Miracles you know as I quoted that scripture I can do nothing except the father shows me forth brother Raam said Elijah could have perfect Faith because God showed him what was going to happen to those Hebrew I'm sorry those uh Baal prophets and he said that he said Lord let Israel and let all these people see that I've done it according to Thy word that's right everybody see that yeah brother said that's why he could Mock and make fun of them he wouldn't have done it unless he would have known what's going to happen right because you don't see him doing that after Jezebel threatens him you don't see him mocking Jezebel he tuck taals and runs from Jezebel the Holy Ghost left him the spirit of God left his mind he became a depressed Prophet a suicidal Prophet right we've heard brother the brothers preach that it's good message brother brah said that see but God's got to drop it in our hearts first Hallelujah so these are great examples we want to remember that by God's grace so you know I I I I don't want to put perfect Faith way out there like we can never uh we could never uh attain to it because we can now for us it might look different right so for brother Bram he had you know of course Visions right brother BR had visions and he know you know that person has to be standing there or this thing's got to be on the table there before God can move in the vision right before God can bring it to reality now you and I let's be honest how many times do that happen to us very very very rare right very R it's usually just in a brother brah calls it a spur of a moment usually it's in that moment you know you'll just say oh it's going to be all right or I believe God heard our prayers or you're you're well by the grace of God you know God's going to heal you it's just something simple like that so for us it's going to be a little different but we got to be under the anointing I'll say like this we want to be under expectation Hallelujah God uses God use me I want to come to church and I want to or I want to have my phone when I get a text from somebody for prayer I want to be ready to pray I want to be in a condition where I can speak the word of God hallelujah now the next example now this is new I didn't mention this but brother Ram says the next situation he says we see the disciples at first didn't have perfect Faith because they couldn't cast a demon off the sick child and they go to Jesus and they said why can't we do it he said because you didn't pray and fast this EP this epilc see demon doesn't come out except by prayer and fasting now we get a deeper thought now right now if we want to have perfect Faith now if we want to have Revelation now we got to live consecrated that's that desperation brother B talked to us about right so there's some Miracles God Will Lead You In A desperate State I got to have this now we got to see it now it's very important Hallelujah and that's where a deeper consecration comes in everybody understand that by God's grace so brother said they didn't have a revelation with this epilepsy demon so that's what we got to ask ourselves Lord is there a revelation I missing and if so I know you love me you'll lead me into this hallelujah amen you're not against me you're for me hallelujah amen you're not fighting against me you're fighting for me Hallelujah and you'll lead me into this when it's your time to do it praise God I've always wondered you know why God didn't uh use me more to speak to the mountains right in our church you know it seems like it's always outside the church well a couple times it has you know with with Zur and who his dad and things like that but I just always wondered but you know what I just got to keep myself consecrated to God I want to be more consecrated praise God you know it's been a couple people at work and different times where I've spoken uh to mountains and so forth and it was just such a refresh brother William I don't know if you ever heard this but this blessed me so much last week Jesus said speak to the mountain it'll move it'll be tossed in the sea but I I forgot and I must have never connected it in Zechariah 4 the holy spirit said tell zerubabel speak to the mountain amen and what was the mountain the mountain was the political persecution where they couldn't rebuild the Temple they started the temple but they didn't finish it but it was such a simple Revelation the mountains don't have to be some major major like impossible things it can be something simple some obstacle in your life something that's keeping you from moving on with God hallelujah and in their case remember God rebuked them God said you're spending so much time on your house building your houses and you neglect the house of God hallelujah really that's what that's what the scripture says in Hagi they made their houses so beautiful and fancy they neglected the house of God and then it's interesting too then they had to go up to the mountains and get the Cedars to finish the they had to go up to the mountain to move the spiritual Mountain that's just a nice play on words there Hallelujah so there was connections to mountains so now church you can see we can see clearly if we want to be used by God to speak the word there's times we're going to have to fast and pray devote to more prayer Hallelujah now I want I want you to hear what brother Ram says when you've got perfect Faith he says this is what you would want to do bear with me with a heart full of joy you could walk into a city room if you got if you got perfect Faith walk into a sick room knowing exactly what you're going to say walk in there and know what's going to happen something's already been revealed and you know it and you walk in and say in the name of Jesus Christ rise up from there thus sayith the Lord there you are he said that's perfect Faith now look what he says next if there be 10 million people there saying it wouldn't happen you know it's going to happen anyhow this is this is what brother calls perfect Faith you got a revelation of what God wants to did unto me that's mature Faith right there this is someone that 10 million people couldn't convince you that's a lot of doubt that's a lot of questions 10 million people could ask but brother says when you got perfect Faith nobody can convince you otherwise Hallelujah I just want you to see this is the type of mature faith we're talking about Hallelujah now church just you know when when I when I prayed for Hau and xur's Dad and God gave what was it three extra years God gave him almost three right almost three I told you that story um I I I in that moment I didn't know what to say I remember remember I told you story I woke up around 4:00 4:30 I usually don't wake up that early and three scriptures are on my mind I can never remember the last two all I can remember is Proverbs where it says there's life and death in the power of the tongue and I was like that's really strange why am I waking up thinking about there's life and death power on the tongue around 8 or 9:00 a.m brother amen calls me and says who dad has had a heart attack and they his unconscious and all these things I said brother let's go pray let's go speak the word of God I still remember that morning I'm looking out my my back on on the deck and I see the sun rising and I'm holding my cell phone there and I say in the name of Jesus Christ I speak to that mountain of heart disease and he's going to come at that hospital and he's going to be well in the name of Jesus Christ I speak to that mountain because and I said because there's life and death in the power of the tongue amen hallelujah now did I have some doubts sure we had to wait quite a few three or four weeks to really see God move but in that moment he prepared he gave me the verse ahead of time right and look and God reminded me I was already working I was it was during the co days when we everybody remember the co days how could I forget brother Jesse well you might forget but I was already working on my computer I was getting my video Lesson ready I was going to teach on the internet not in person I was going to teach over over the computer I was getting and and so my mind wasn't even on the scripture see the Holy Spirit brought it to my remembrance hallelujah amen isn't that what Jesus said Jesus said the Holy Ghost will bring all things to your remembrance Hallelujah but I wasn't absolutely sure like like I don't think I would have told 10 million people Z that your dad was going to come out I don't think I would have maybe told 10 million people but I thought we spoke God's word you know we we believe God's word I I could said there there's two witnesses you know I I woke up early and I got the word of God and then the need came there's like three Witnesses this seems like it's lining up why would God wake me up early why would the scripture be on my mind like that and why would amen call me at 8: a. it just seemed like it worked out but I had to battle the next three weeks you better believe I was battling remember the first few Sundays I'm like sister who how's your dad oh he's still in the hospital he's still unconscious let's speak let's keep speaking the word you know right just had that moment where you got to keep battling praise God but this is the perfect Faith or perfect Revelation brother's talking about now church for us to have that what we need is more consecration amen and M church it's got to be the plan of God too if God don't want you to speak the word in certain ways well then you're never going to do it right and we never want to pretend like we are right brother man said never just he said wait he said the skies are full of real things amen the skies full of Pentecostal blessings amen don't settle for something false Hallelujah now brother BR breaks into this he said job and Peter both had condemnations in their heart so they couldn't have perfect Faith he said in the Book of Job it says job feared remember the I preached on that numerous times about job job said all that I feared had come upon him so job was doing great things for God but he had a SE a problem with fear maybe a secret problem but he he says it later all that I feared has come upon me I've greatly fear these things right he said what he feared actually happened what brought it his fear that's what made it happen his faith would have kept it from him but his fear brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen see what what I mean he says he said if you're afraid to come in the prayer line maybe I just haven't got faith sufficient he said it'll never happen don't worry but if you know it's going to happen it'll happen now Church most of us don't come in the prayer line absolutely positive it's going to happen we have to battle some level of fear and uncertainty and doubt right right but that doesn't mean God hasn't dropped the Revelation in our hearts right it's like jerus said you know Lord I believe help my unbelief yeah right there's a part of me I got a revelation I believe but you know I just I just want to put my faith with the preachers I want to put my faith with the sisters or the brothers you know I just want to put it with somebody else I mean that's what every time I come up for prayer that's what I'm coming up for prayer Lord Brother Simon y I want to put my faith with yours I know the Holy Spirit spoke tonight and I believe God will hear your prayer too Hallelujah my I want to put my faith with your faith Hallelujah he said Peter was doing all right walking on the water until he got scared the word told him he could walk on water so look he had thus sayi the Lord he already knew the will of God Amen he had perfect Faith but look what happens when you start doubting perfect Faith see he said he was scared first he thought it was a ghost He said Lord if it be you bid me to come on the water brother said he was doing all right until he started doubting Hallelujah so that that's something we've got to battle as well if we know God's leading us to something and yet we start doubting it then we got to we just got to trust that God will lead us to believe it and to strengthen our faith so we won't miss it in Jesus name right that's one fear you know that that's one uh battle we always have uh am I doing something wrong did I miss the will of God did I miss a healing for somebody did right we we like when brother Dennis preached that Ain sermon right none of us want to be aens right so what does it do it makes us search our Souls like God I don't want to keep somebody in our church from getting a a miracle and thank God for those good checkup times amen but remember God's for us he's not against us hallelujah and that's the beauty of just having a time of prayer wherever your prayer time is and confess everything and say God wash me in your blood wash me white as snow help me to have the three signs to know I'm on fire a fervent desire to please you a passion know his word and let me reach out in the spirit Hallelujah amen glory thank God that's the three signs to know you're on fire Hallelujah you got a passion to know the word you have a fervent desire I want to please God today and you're willing to reach out in the spirit I I feel the spirit of God leading me amen so what's God leading you tonight Hallelujah that's the question that's what it comes down to right what is God leading me to believe tonight all right now now here's a major quote brother Williams probably heard it aund times maybe 150 brother said now perfect faith is a master of all circumstances right perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it now watch when you believe anything do anything you got to have faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances is it Masters that circumstance in a room of sickness the Lord's revealed that certain things going to happen you just speak it and go on now I've always pointed this out when I preach this maybe a few times you and I are not the master of all circumstances faith is the master of all circumstances right because we can all see maybe even times this week we failed circumstances we got to remember to keep this quote the right way now if you if you receive a revelation from God then yes you will master that circumstance but you're not going to master every circumstance because you're not Jesus you're not the word you're a part of the word but you're not all the word amen everybody got it by God's grace let's apply that quote the right way if I've got perfect Faith I'll master that circumstance God's called me to I'll cross that Jordan or I'll cross that red sea or those walls will fall down in Jericho if God gives me the faith for it Hallelujah and I can pray until those walls do come down amen I told you I wasn't going to be long tonight so we'll see keep looking at that busy body back there so again we got to understand these quotes by other quotes in scriptures in other words you can't work yourself up into perfect Faith God's got to reveal it to you amen God's got to reveal it to you that's what Simeon had remember the Bible said I read it this week the Bible said the Holy Ghost revealed to Simeon that he would not die until he saw the Lord's Christ well he didn't have any Bible for that that was a personal revelation but he had after that after that Revelation came he had perfect faith in other words I will not die until I see the Messiah Hallelujah and then he then God worked it out where Jesus was born and Jesus is brought brought right to the temple he sees Jesus he said now I can go to heaven my eyes have seen the salvation of the Lord hallelujah I always knew this would happen praise God church that's what we need we just need a simple Revelation and I told you this before but I at some point in my life if God terries I want to seek God and ask God God am I going to live to see the Rapture or not I'd like to know that I just personally would like to know that that's something I like to seek God about I mean what what what would you like to seek God out about I just love how Daniel did it for 21 days brother William 21 days three weeks he just ate wa drank water and ate little Foods you know and he just shut himself away also so he could understand when is Israel going to get back to the land that's all so if we ever consecrated God it'd be the same thing Lord when is this Gentile bride going to be finished Hallelujah when is the rure going to be in my lifetime my children's lifetime think about that that's that was just a simple request when are we going to see some of this restoration happen amen hallelujah I got to remember I got all summer I could do some of these things but I got to remember to do it Hallelujah I got to be I gotta be led by the Holy Spirit to do it got to be led by the holy spirit so faith is the master of every circumstance no matter what circumstance is if God gives you that anointing you're going to pass the test Hallelujah now Church let's rub out a little bit this unbelief here I've I've shared this before but maybe not too often some people misuse the quote where it says any positive attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass that's true if You' got the revelation of it but if you don't have the revelation of it you can be positive all you want it ain't going to happen that's what brother R says in the works of Faith Express in so many in so many different words he says they can pour a g 50 gallons of oil on you but until you got the Revelation you're still going to be sick he tells us that in in different words right so what I'm saying is don't let the devil beat you up you don't have a positive enough attitude well first I before I can have the attitude I want to have the right Revelation praise God I want to know the word of God because remember in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 Paul asked Jesus to heal him three times right but people today will look you know immature message Believers will look at him today and say just speak the word brother Paul just speak the word you get your eyesight back just speak it why don't you speak it I'm gonna start doing that more people tell me that well why don't you speak the word of God you got the Holy Ghost on you right you're the one who brought it up but three times and so we it's just a great it's a great lesson to always find the will of God it's not just based upon our confession it's based upon the Revelation and then we must confess God's revelation Hallelujah that's it he's the high priest of our profession but we got to know his Revelation first before we can profess it hallelujah amen it's always based upon the will of God like Abraham then brother uses Abraham in the story well of course he could call those things as not as though they were because God told him for 25 years brother will for 25 years God told him your children are going to be the number of the stars and the sand verse 25 well no wonder he could call those things not though they are right because he had a thus say the Lord he had a revelation right so we've got to take that same pattern God reveals it then you can confess it we got to take that same pattern and apply to our lives what has God revealed to me what's God revealed to you and then what God's revealed to you keep the confession Hallelujah call those things not as though they were Hallelujah now brother says you can just hope he said just be he said you can be positive he said that will encourage you he said just speak you know speak positive don't speak negative right don't bring an evil spirit on you be positive like I'm trusting in the Lord I don't know but I'm trusting in God be positive don't be negative but the only way to be absolutely sure is to have the Revelation the perfect Faith hallelujah oh my amen I love this amen rubbing out some of this immaturity and unel just rub that out Hallelujah Glory now I'm coming down here I'm almost done you can believe that at this moment towards this and at the end of the sermon brother R starts just Discerning people in the in the crowd he just breaks into the sermon he said Jim do you know do you believe that God knows about that baby it took fever before you left 105 bam doesn't know this he just discerns it do you believe it he'll heal it come on come on it today sick it'll leave I just looked over there and seen them over there before they left home what they done now that's true how about that before you leave home you got a sick baby with a fever prophet of God calls it out you think that would raise your faith sure discerns your heart he says Mrs little do you believe God will give you victory over that diabetes then there's a woman sitting beside you don't know you but the spirit's on her she's worried about she got a child that has an operation for an eye she's from Chicago well and then brother R breaks in that verse it's quicker more powerful than a two-edged sword a discerner what is that the word do you believe that certainly amen I love that he preaches perfect Faith about read Revelation and then God starts giving him Revelation to tell the people amen hallelujah so they can have perfect faith Mrs peena you've heard that one it isn't for you it's for this grandson sitting here you're praying about it you believe that God will make it well you believe God can tell me what's wrong with him doctors don't know that's right it's swelling lungs that's right he's got a blood condition correct they're they're kind of confused whether they're going to let him go to school or not he said it's quicker more powerful than a two-edged sword he starts Discerning all these people remember church I read it last week brother R said this sermon was to raise the faith of the people and then he says now there's no prayer cards in the building we don't use them here unless we just have to keep it in order you want to be prayed for how many wants to be prayed for while the word is manifesting through flesh Hallelujah and then brother R tells him he said don't you come in this prayer line unless you've got perfect Faith now think about that what if I said that brother William today it make you think before you come up for prayer right next time whether Keith's preaching or who brother Brook or whoever is preaching if they said don't come in this prayer line because brother Ram said you'll be wasting people's time that's what brother Ram says that's quite a statement and remember there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus right but I'm just bringing it down this sermon was about perfect Faith this was about revelation of the word of God having a revelation of what God wanted to do brother said we don't have prayer cards he said so he said just get get in the line and then how many know brother Ram prays nine minutes straight and I I wish I would have had time to put up there brother Ram says the same almost the same exact prayer word for word for every person that goes through the prayer line there's probably 100 people that go through the prayer line let me read the first for you he says let those who have faith come forward in the name of Jesus Christ I lay my hands on her for healing in the name of Jesus Christ I condemn the sickness in the name of Jesus Christ I lay hands on my brother for healing he don't discern him or nothing he just that's all he says he said but you've already got perfect faith that when I pray for you God's going to heal you praise God so we're just going through the acts because you've already got perfect Faith you already know God's going to do it so that's all I got to do I don't have to discern you I just got to speak the name of Jesus Amen it's a beautiful sermon if you haven't listened to it listen to it please in Jesus Christ's name I lay hands on my sister for healing in the name of Jesus Christ I lay hands on my brother for his healing in Jesus name I lay hands on my sister for healing in Jesus name I lay hands on my sister then he prays for brother da and brother DA's wife he said is that all of them and then they're done now I want to read what brother mam said right after the prayer line just nine minutes of straight prayer and they sing only believe the whole nine minutes nine minutes straight brother Jess you sing that song again Yes again Hallelujah God likes that song Amen only believe brother man said know ye what I've done to you you've called me your pastor and so say well for so I am if I your pastor have been identified by Jesus Christ that I do his work then believe my word by acting this faith I'm Sorry by acting this Act of Faith by laying hands on you I've condemned the disease and the afflictions that's bothering you believe that so shall you have your request regardless of what it is for all things are possible to them that believe and when you pray believe that you receive them what you asked for and I truly believe that I receive it and in my heart I accept every one of your healings I accept that it's done brother R says I accept it because you've got perfect Faith God's revealed to you you're going to be made well so I I have perfect Faith because you got perfect Faith amen I believe with all that's in me also with my hands upon these handkerchiefs laying here I've been watching it close I believe that they'll produce just exactly what the people requested I believe it now this is I put um you must read this in my notes I must read this okay just bear with me this is coming into that third poll now what was the third poll the opening of the word and he gave five examples of speaking the word of God now this was this was in August so August September October November December so four months later brother gave those uh four those five examples of speaking the word remember he spoke to the snowstorm remember yeah he he spoke to his wife's tumor I could never think of the other ones there's three other ones he spoke those five signs of the third pole yep that's right the fish were spoken back to life that's right that's three of them uh Sunny Shimp was the fourth one now who's got the fifth one who's got the memory but so we got four out of five Hallelujah brother Ram said I want to ask you a sincere question look at this question he asked him you that passed through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that there's something happened in you since you've had hands laid on you raise your hand there it is this is what we waited for this third pole is just starting to bloom now I did this for a purpose now look at that there's my 45 minute timer so I'll go 15 more minutes God's look at that brother random brought this down to the same condition as the woman touching His Garment she felt the healing in her body and brother Ram says don't you get in this prayer line unless God's revealed God's going to heal you and then he asked how many can actually feel you're better and all the hands went up amen hallelujah now church with him Discerning no doubt the Holy Ghost was there revealing with him Discerning and telling these secrets and thoughts no doubt those people could feel the presence of God that's how many times it is with you when you feel God's presence you'll come up for prayer right you don't come up for prayer if you don't feel God's presence do you you wait till you feel God how many times have I seen amen pull you over there sister who and come up for prayer how many times have I seen that I like that amen or vice versa Hallelujah but that's when you know God's there when you feel the presence of God that's when you go for prayer he said I did this for a purpose I'm working out something see it's taking a charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise Faith to a bracket where you've never noticed that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith see a full Revelation I've got a full Revelation God's going to heal me in the prayer line I got a full Revelation I can speak the word of God he says and I watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and to discerner the thoughts and Tents of the heart now we're coming into Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the Rapture Church we're going to have a revelation at the time of the Rapture if we're alive we're going to have a revelation the Rapture is near Hallelujah but said well see our loved ones we'll see the dead in Christ rise no doubt we'd have perfect Faith Hallelujah that's why I believe that's so important for us to see the dead in Christ rise first that would raise your faith Hallelujah if if a dream will raise your faith what will seeing a theophany do to you if you actually saw a theophany while you're awake but man said he' pinched his finger am I awake I mean what would seeing uh John Wesley or Martin Luther or brother random or Paul or Peter what would that do to your faith it goes Skyrocket High it raise you to a different bracket trusting in a perfect god with a perfect promise with the perfect word hallelujah perfect Faith he said we're coming now to that Perfection because they got to have it in order for the Rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that per perfect raptured Faith so see we can't do it till God brings us to it we've been waiting 59 Years brother we're almost at 60 looking for it means now look what brother says if you want rap how many want rapturing Faith I've read this before but now I get to read it in you into the context so you can hear it it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God I'm glad I got some amens on that Hallelujah I don't want to be the only one saying Amen to that I've read that numerous times over the years of being a pastor this is what this is the context he says it in we just had a service where every person knew they were going to get healed then they could feel they were going to get healed and then he says we got to have more of this if we want to go in the Rapture praise God Amen and God will bring us to it h by the grace of God hallelujah that's why this is no no doubt no wonder why people sung a song about this I've heard recognizing your day serpent SE and perfect faith and the church said what's next on Sunday the breach and the message of Grace and Lord I Thank You amen I thank you for showing me what perfect faith is it's a perfect Revelation Hallelujah and God has to bring it to me and he'll do it by his grace he will he'll cause the conditions of my life to get desperate where I'm driven into this through prayer and fasting or he he'll have me in Consecration and I'll just speak the word of God and God will answer this is the same sermon where brother Braham said God challenged him to speak the squirrels into existence just like Jesus challenged them why don't you speak to the storm why don't you speak to it where's your faith Hallelujah he said if he can create squirrels which has no way at all or anything there to believe it's my own faith that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask for so that's where it's going to take some maturity Lord are you challenging me to ask the word are you challenging me to speak the word that's what brother man had to deal with Lord you're challenging me okay I'll speak it right he had to be in a consecrated condition in order to do that that's what we need conse consecration now look what he says after this he said the god of heaven knows that's true can he also heal the sick if he can lift my faith up this way even for the people even if they can't climb to that bracket if they can't do it he can use my faith he can lift me up to that place and I'm climbing for you I'm believing for you I'm speaking for you right didn't Jesus do that didn't Jesus do miracles for people remember in John chapter 5 Jesus healed that paralyzed man and he didn't even ask for theal healing remember that is that beautiful amen that's beautiful he didn't even no no doubt he was praying for you know for years and asking God remember he's trying to get to the water but somebody always beat him to the water when the angel served the water and Jesus said pick up your bed and walk he didn't ask him do you want to be healed he said pick up your bed and walk amen his faith ministered to that man and gave him what he desired Hallelujah brother said that's what my faith did for some of you Hallelujah God uses your faith he Saidi your brother I'm standing as your brother an intercessor trying my best to hold you before God and I'm standing here tonight before the white Throne now pointing my finger at that Bloody sacrifice here look at this man this is so beautiful Hallelujah Glory brother hallelujah what what's he trying to do I'm trying to intercede for you and what am I doing I'm pointing you to the bloody sacrifice oh thank God there a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins hallelujah what is every preacher trying to get us to do look to the bloody sacrifice Hallelujah and see if God will reveal that for us will God reveal my healing as I look to the bloody sacrifice or is he going to tell me wa a little longer Hallelujah but either way we got to look to the right thing we got to look to the bloody sacrifice of Jesus speaking through his name that it's done it has to happen it has to happen you know it's happened I know it's happened so do you know it's happened and so all right I'm ending with the same verse I I ended with last week Romans 81 13- 14 musicians can come you can stop the live streamers God bless you live streamers hope to hear some more good testimonies
