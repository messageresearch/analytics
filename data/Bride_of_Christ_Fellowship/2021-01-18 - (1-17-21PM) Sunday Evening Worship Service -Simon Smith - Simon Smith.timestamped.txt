[29:14] little nuggets i got still got my uh
[29:17] trail shoes on
[29:19] so we'll start down the trail this
[29:21] flipping again
[29:23] um so uh let's get into the word here
[29:27] let's go to uh
[29:31] where do we go from here let's see let's
[29:34] go to genesis 3.
[29:37] genesis 3.
[29:43] and we'll start with this scripture
[29:44] right here excuse me
[29:46] i'm sorry i forgot to charge the battery
[29:48] so they're out
[29:51] i can take that whole thing or i didn't
[29:52] even turn it on
[29:55] oh it wasn't on it wasn't always it on
[29:56] there oh no
[29:58] [Music]
[30:01] turned on
[30:09] all right genesis 3 14 and 15 will say
[30:13] we'll read that then we'll say a word of
[30:14] prayer right
[30:17] verse 14 says in the lord god said unto
[30:20] the serpent because thou has done this
[30:24] thou art cursed above all cattle and
[30:26] above every beast of the field
[30:28] upon thy belly shout thou go and thus
[30:31] shalt thou eat all the days of thy life
[30:35] so here now the serpent has received a
[30:37] curse
[30:38] and look what god says he says and i'll
[30:40] put enmity between
[30:42] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[30:46] and her seed and it shall bruise thy
[30:47] head and thou shalt bruise his heel so

[32:40] the serpent
[32:42] and we want to uh deal with the two
[32:46] seeds we want to deal with
[32:48] this powerful question here if we can
[32:50] just determine this this would really
[32:51] solve
[32:52] everything and now and for your young
[32:54] younger ones
[32:56] uh lydia malachi
[32:59] i can't remember your name brother
[33:01] daddy's
[33:04] young sisters there you know these are
[33:06] things that are coming up on
[33:07] growing up in your teenage years and if
[33:10] you guys be the next generation to be
[33:14] uh christians real christians i'm gonna
[33:16] say message believers because we're
[33:18] christians
[33:19] um christians that believe the message i
[33:21] say like that
[33:24] uh christ is our uh that's who we
[33:27] identify with
[33:28] and jesus christ he's done it all he's
[33:31] the one that set the message the message
[33:33] come out of the bible and the message
[33:35] helps reveal the bible
[33:36] so anyhow we want to get into this thing
[33:38] if we can just figure out by god's grace
[33:40] who cain's dad was this
[33:44] was cain a a son of god or was he
[33:47] something else was he this or that
[33:49] and uh there's many things i would like
[33:52] to say
[33:53] um but we don't want to hurt feelings we
[33:55] don't want to uh
[33:56] offend and we're going to go with just
[33:59] some scriptures here we'll hit this and
[34:00] uh
[34:01] i want to come to my point but anyhow
[34:03] let's continue on here
[34:04] you see here in in first john 3
[34:09] let's examine this this is pretty clear
[34:12] here
[34:14] who was kane we know kane um he was a
[34:17] disobedient
[34:19] brother disobedient son one that done
[34:22] did not love his
[34:23] brother he says little children let no
[34:26] man deceive you he that doeth
[34:28] righteousness
[34:29] is righteous right even as he
[34:32] is righteous he that committeth sin is
[34:35] of
[34:36] the devil i mean goodness this is
[34:39] this is john the divine the revelator uh
[34:42] the one that did not
[34:43] did not become a martyr this is one who
[34:45] is a direct son of god
[34:48] in fact when john wrote his own book
[34:50] there john he says
[34:51] this is the disciple whom jesus loved
[34:55] he left his name out and just said jesus
[34:57] loves me
[34:59] that's how he identified himself you
[35:01] hear the revelation that he was
[35:03] loved of god read verse john it's all
[35:06] about love
[35:08] absolutely comforts you i was i had a
[35:10] really rough time a rough time about
[35:12] five years ago maybe six years ago now
[35:13] actually
[35:14] coming this march and sleepless nights
[35:16] and all those things and i just went
[35:18] went downstairs
[35:20] just the way it's written he says
[35:23] for the purpose of the son of god was
[35:25] manifest that he might destroy works the
[35:26] devil for whosoever is born of god doth
[35:29] not commit sin
[35:30] for his seed remaineth in him right and
[35:33] he cannot sin
[35:34] because he was born of god we're dealing
[35:35] with what holy ghost-filled christians
[35:37] that have what the very seed of god
[35:39] in them now notice in verse 10 remember
[35:42] what we talked about earlier in in
[35:43] matthew 7 it says
[35:45] he says a good deed cannot bring forth
[35:47] evil fruit
[35:49] an evil tree cannot bring forth good
[35:51] fruit
[35:52] but what evil begets evil and good
[35:55] begets
[35:55] good amen he says now in this the
[35:58] children of
[35:59] god are manifest and the children of the
[36:03] devil
[36:03] god have mercy this is just as plain as
[36:06] can be there are two
[36:08] sets of children and for you new
[36:10] testament scholars and those
[36:12] that read the new testament this runs
[36:14] all
[36:15] the way through even even obviously all
[36:17] the way into the old testament
[36:19] he says whoever doeth not righteousness
[36:21] is not of god there's
[36:22] matthew 7 he says neither he that loveth
[36:24] not his brother now notice where john
[36:27] has taken this he's taken this
[36:28] all the way he says and he brings in
[36:31] those that do not love their brother
[36:34] for this is the message that you have
[36:36] heard from the beginning
[36:38] whereas the beginning all the way back
[36:40] in genesis that we should love
[36:42] one another he said this is this
[36:44] identifies everything
[36:46] who will love who
[36:50] love divine love agape love is a
[36:53] distinction
[36:54] yes not filio
[36:57] but agape not as cain who was
[37:01] of the wicked one
[37:04] right is there any scripture that says
[37:05] adam is of the wicked one or adam is the
[37:07] wicked
[37:08] one not one scripture but he says cain
[37:11] was of the wicked one and slew his
[37:13] brother and wherefore slew he him
[37:15] because his own
[37:16] works right he was an evil tree bringing
[37:18] forth what evil deeds
[37:20] evil fruit were evil and his brothers
[37:23] were
[37:23] righteous and if his brother is
[37:26] righteous we can determine right there
[37:29] that abel was a son of god
[37:31] because the bible says that the
[37:33] righteous blood of abel in hebrews 13
[37:36] i'm sorry hebrews 11 hebrews 11 the
[37:38] righteous blood of abel absolutely so
[37:40] that amen is another scripture there
[37:42] there's a here's a little and there's a
[37:43] little two
[37:45] marvel not my brother if the world hate
[37:48] you correct amen
[37:49] now if cain was a son or or
[37:52] or of the devil does this run through
[37:55] the rest of scripture
[37:57] the word i know you all know these
[37:58] things but we're just looking at it
[38:00] then jesus sent the multitude in a way
[38:02] and went to the house and his disciples
[38:03] came at him saying declare unto us the
[38:05] parable of the tares of the field right
[38:07] and he answered said to him he that
[38:09] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[38:12] he says this the field is the world the
[38:14] good seed are the children of the
[38:16] kingdom right there's again he says and
[38:18] the tears are the children of the wicked
[38:21] one right there's two sets of children
[38:23] and they identify that
[38:24] these children uh are the tares are the
[38:27] or the children of the wicked one
[38:29] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[38:35] does it say god does it say adam is it
[38:38] peter
[38:39] no it's not peter but it is actually the
[38:42] devil himself
[38:44] the harvest in the world and the reapers
[38:45] are the angels
[38:47] okay now is this a spiritual seed
[38:53] the enemy that sow them is the devil so
[38:56] if the devil
[38:57] has children they must be spirits as
[38:59] well
[39:01] that's an argument we're seeing here
[39:02] that i'm seeing is oh brother it's not
[39:04] literal
[39:05] it is figurative it is spiritual and not
[39:08] natural
[39:12] okay so now here notice in john 8
[39:15] now this is the natural let me ask you a
[39:17] question
[39:19] if they say this is literal or i'm sorry
[39:22] if this is a spiritual thing
[39:23] is matthew mark luke and john is that
[39:27] not did that not take place on earth or
[39:30] was that in a spiritual dimension
[39:32] what if matthew mark luke and john was a
[39:34] spiritual dimension
[39:36] that we we could not see with the carnal
[39:38] eye but what
[39:39] what was actually recorded by the
[39:40] disciples were the very
[39:43] broken to the v to do to the dimension
[39:45] of the spirit realm
[39:47] and they're looking in the spirit realm
[39:48] they're watching jesus in the devil
[39:50] battle
[39:52] and jesus and the demons and angels and
[39:53] all those things is matthew mark luke
[39:55] john in the spiritual realm
[39:57] no it is in this what this earthly
[40:00] earthly fleshly realm absolutely
[40:03] he's now look here in john 8 and verse
[40:05] 22 then said the jews
[40:06] will he kill himself because he saith i
[40:08] whether i go he cannot come
[40:10] and he said to him ye are from beneath
[40:15] in genesis 1. the bible said that god
[40:19] created the
[40:20] the animal life in this old earth but
[40:22] then he said later he said
[40:24] directly on the same day he says let us
[40:26] make man in our
[40:27] image right where was that that took
[40:29] place up in heaven because we see
[40:31] in the seventh day after creation is
[40:33] finished
[40:34] in genesis i believe it was two that one
[40:37] that's
[40:37] after the completion of all that he
[40:39] takes now the
[40:40] it's like this the soul of adam and
[40:42] makes what a man of flesh and puts it on
[40:44] the earth
[40:44] amen amen yes and hides even there too
[40:48] and that's reform that's right he says
[40:51] ye
[40:51] are from beneath he says i am from the
[40:55] he says i am from above year of this
[40:56] world he says i am not
[40:58] of this world and neither are we amen
[41:01] amen
[41:01] as the song says i am not this is not
[41:04] our home we're just a passing through
[41:06] amen sure and he continues all with his
[41:09] his sermon here he says if the son of
[41:11] man there shall make you free he shall
[41:12] be free and
[41:13] free indeed he says now i know that ye
[41:15] are abraham's seed
[41:18] now here's the place where they also get
[41:20] confused
[41:22] brother sign look they're from abraham's
[41:24] sea line
[41:25] they're saved the promise went through
[41:28] abraham's seed line
[41:30] he says but notice jesus said though you
[41:31] came directly from abraham's law and he
[41:34] says
[41:34] he says but you he says ye seek to kill
[41:37] me
[41:38] remember an evil tree cannot bring forth
[41:40] good fruit
[41:42] because my word hath no place in you
[41:46] i speak that which i have seen with my
[41:48] father and you do that which you have
[41:49] seen of your
[41:50] father now this this is not just this is
[41:53] not just a prophet
[41:55] this is god in flesh
[41:58] this is the almighty the great i am now
[42:01] in his body his flesh body and he's
[42:03] calling out exactly who these people are
[42:07] is he lying is he lying is he making a
[42:10] figurative thing no he's calling them
[42:11] and telling them exactly
[42:13] what's going on he's breaking down
[42:16] revealing exactly who they're
[42:18] who they are he says then he says in
[42:20] verse 39 he says
[42:21] then they they answered said to him
[42:23] abraham is our father jesus said to him
[42:25] if abraham's
[42:26] if ye were abraham's children he would
[42:29] do the works of abraham so now he just
[42:31] said
[42:31] you're of abraham he says but if you
[42:32] were of abraham
[42:35] that's right well it looks kind of
[42:38] confusing brother
[42:39] he says but now you seek to kill me a
[42:42] man that hath told you the truth which i
[42:43] have heard of god this
[42:45] did not abraham he says you
[42:48] naturally came out of abraham he says
[42:50] but he said
[42:51] he said but your seed line is not
[42:53] abraham's seed
[42:56] which proves what there was a mingling
[42:59] before that had taken place
[43:01] right now remember if you look if you
[43:03] look at noah's day the bible said the
[43:05] noah's day that noah was
[43:06] perfect in his generations
[43:09] perfect the bible says perfect flawless
[43:12] no mistake what
[43:14] all the way from abraham all the way
[43:15] back to adam and they all married their
[43:17] own with
[43:18] within the holy seed line
[43:23] they go through the flood
[43:26] i believe it let me look real quick here
[43:28] it's in genesis
[43:29] let's look real quick so i want to make
[43:31] sure
[43:35] and
[43:38] right here in genesis 10
[43:42] i'm sorry nine
[43:52] sir genesis 9 verses 20.
[43:55] and noah began to be a husbandman and he
[43:58] planted a vineyard and he drank of the
[44:00] wine
[44:00] and was drunken and he was uncovered
[44:02] with his tent now remember if the bible
[44:03] says that if noah was perfect in his
[44:05] generations
[44:07] and if he married one of his own kind
[44:09] which is a daughter of god
[44:10] he was perfect there was no mixture
[44:12] there everything was in him was pure
[44:14] then his three sons would be pure sons
[44:16] of god
[44:19] he says and and he drank of the wine and
[44:21] was drunk and he was uncovered within
[44:22] his tent
[44:23] and and ham the the father of canaan
[44:26] saw the wickedness of his father
[44:30] sorry i'm sorry saw the nakedness of his
[44:31] father and told his two brothers without
[44:33] and shem and jacob took his garment and
[44:35] laid it both between the shoulders went
[44:36] backward and covered the nakeds of their
[44:38] father
[44:38] and their faces were uh backward and
[44:41] they saw not their father's nakedness
[44:44] and noah awoke from his wine and knew
[44:46] that his younger
[44:47] son well your son younger son had done
[44:49] unto him
[44:50] and he said cursed be canaan
[44:55] why does not noah curse
[45:00] him he cannot curse him
[45:04] because ham is blessed
[45:08] he could not like directly lay a curse
[45:11] upon him because he was
[45:12] already blessed he was perfect seed line
[45:16] genealogy
[45:18] but what he cursed what as it said here
[45:21] verse 10 and him the father of canaan he
[45:23] curses his great great whatever grandson
[45:26] however was and that came through what
[45:28] we you know mixture of
[45:30] uh the sons of god saw the daughters of
[45:32] man
[45:33] and came unto them made wives and those
[45:35] sort of things
[45:37] so obviously ham had married a serpent
[45:39] seed
[45:41] no doubt about it now let's continue on
[45:43] here
[45:44] he says if you were abraham's children
[45:45] you would do with the works of abraham
[45:46] but now you seek to kill me a man that
[45:48] had told you the truth
[45:49] he said which i have heard of god this
[45:51] did not abraham the mixing came
[45:53] after the flood which is what dealt
[45:56] right here in genesis 20.
[45:58] he said this not not abraham now notice
[45:59] what jesus says ye do the deeds of your
[46:02] father
[46:03] then they said unto him we be not born
[46:05] of what
[46:07] we'd be not born because my because eve
[46:10] ate apples
[46:11] or she ate this or ate that he says but
[46:13] we be not born of what
[46:15] the act of fornication we have one
[46:17] father even god jesus said to him if god
[46:20] were your father
[46:21] he is saying that god is not their
[46:23] father
[46:24] he says ye would love me very clear
[46:28] how do you how can you get away from
[46:29] this this doesn't need an interpretation
[46:32] this is christ bringing there was
[46:35] absolutely no
[46:36] symbolism brought here jesus now this
[46:39] isn't even the scare the pharisees
[46:40] sadducees subscribes
[46:41] he's dealing with jews the bible said
[46:44] these are just
[46:45] jews who followed him and who said the
[46:46] bible said believed him up until this
[46:48] time
[46:48] right and he just flat out just told
[46:50] them who they were
[46:54] he says if god were your father you
[46:56] would love me for i proceeded forth and
[46:58] came from
[46:58] god neither came i of myself but he sent
[47:02] me
[47:03] why do you not understand in my speech
[47:05] even because you cannot hear me
[47:06] he says ye of your father the devil just
[47:09] like king
[47:11] and the lusts of your father you will do
[47:13] he was notice he connects the devil
[47:15] and cain right here he was a murderer
[47:17] from the beginning
[47:19] he says an abode not of the truth
[47:21] because there is no truth in him and
[47:22] when he speaketh the lie he's speaking
[47:23] of his own for he's a liar and the
[47:24] father of
[47:25] it so the question i've been dealing
[47:28] with
[47:29] another question they said psy i have 40
[47:31] scriptures
[47:32] 40 scriptures that said that the devil
[47:35] has children
[47:36] he said then there's scriptures that say
[47:38] they're servants he he said
[47:40] they can't be the same they're separate
[47:44] i said what do you mean he's like well
[47:45] this is a spirit and this is carnal
[47:50] and i as calmly as i could i said
[47:53] brother
[47:53] if the devil is a spirit and he can
[47:57] enter into an animal
[48:00] and let's say god set the stage just
[48:02] like he did in genesis 1
[48:03] and that animal seed could mingle
[48:08] if it could mingle and the devil knew it
[48:10] and he figured out because he was a
[48:11] scientific genius
[48:12] and the devil came and dwelt within that
[48:14] serpent
[48:15] and used that serpent to propagate what
[48:17] he had to do
[48:19] is that possible and they said yes it's
[48:20] possible well then let's not argue about
[48:22] because it's possible
[48:23] now if it's not possible then we got an
[48:25] issue but if it's possible
[48:27] then then chances are it took place
[48:30] because how else can the devil have
[48:32] children who are flesh was jesus talking
[48:34] to spirits here no he was talking to
[48:36] people
[48:37] in flesh that ate three times a day
[48:40] that that breathed that needed to drink
[48:43] water
[48:43] that had that we could reproduce right
[48:46] he was dealing with
[48:47] people and yet they're children of the
[48:50] devil
[48:52] so i asked him are you a son of adam
[48:55] or a son of god because what's the
[48:57] difference
[48:59] if god wanted children why didn't he
[49:00] just speak them all he did up there
[49:03] but then he chose what a vehicle he
[49:06] chose of fleshly bodies to bring those
[49:08] forth
[49:09] amen amen
[49:12] who were they dealing with the great i
[49:16] am now notice here
[49:18] let's jump from that he was dealing with
[49:21] the great i am now here's
[49:22] i'm gonna i'm just gonna show you this
[49:23] here real quick see what and i wanna
[49:25] show you the
[49:26] i wanna show you the blindness okay you
[49:28] guys ready for this
[49:31] because when i this when i saw this
[49:35] okay my heart was like when i'm when i'm
[49:37] dealing here i've been dealing with this
[49:38] for about
[49:39] three days and my heart was just
[49:44] because i cannot believe what i'm
[49:45] reading most of the time okay
[49:47] this is a taking off of my whatsapp here
[49:50] and i've
[49:51] crossed out the name to protect identity
[49:56] because what i love my brother now look
[49:59] he says
[50:00] very clear bro the use of beguiled has
[50:04] nothing to do with relations
[50:06] nothing absolutely nothing i was like
[50:08] okay let me look at the definition here
[50:11] uh nasa or nasha to lead a stray that is
[50:15] mentally
[50:16] okay there's mental issues to delete
[50:19] or morally to seduce
[50:24] so i looked it up here i said morally
[50:26] seduced check check
[50:27] [Laughter]
[50:30] to lead astray to carry out physical
[50:34] relations
[50:34] blah blah blah i said
[50:38] pretty clear he actually sent something
[50:41] that had the definition in it
[50:45] i said brother you have a 50 50 chance
[50:47] here
[50:48] it has two meanings
[50:51] now 50 50 50 chance you're right
[50:55] and 50 chance you lose
[50:58] that's what we call a that's not even a
[51:01] dice that is like an
[51:02] that's like a a coin
[51:06] would you bet your salvation on a
[51:08] doctrine with a flip of a coin
[51:11] absolutely not right that's what i call
[51:15] crazy
[51:17] that was just one little thing i was
[51:18] like what are you
[51:20] you know no response after that now look
[51:22] at this here
[51:24] this is the problem this is the problem
[51:28] right here
[51:29] is this chronological is this exactly
[51:33] the fall took place uh god comes down
[51:35] judges serpent
[51:37] eve adam then it shows
[51:42] those sort of things and then we come to
[51:44] this
[51:46] and adam knew his wife eve and she
[51:49] conceived and bear cain and said i have
[51:51] gotten a man
[51:52] from the lord
[51:56] so who are we listening to whose
[51:58] testimony is this
[52:00] eve's own word the bible says
[52:04] let a woman learn in silence with all
[52:06] subjection he says i suffer not a woman
[52:08] to teach
[52:09] he says nor to absolute or usurp
[52:12] authority
[52:12] over the man but to be in silence for
[52:15] adam was first formed then eve
[52:17] adam was not deceived he says but the
[52:19] woman was deceived
[52:21] in the transgression yeah so what do we
[52:24] have here we have a modern i'd say
[52:25] an old school joyce meyers
[52:28] [Laughter]
[52:30] anyone want to listen to that woman
[52:32] anyone want to look at it
[52:34] she's starting to look like i mean i'm
[52:35] going cardinal just way back in the
[52:37] late 80s looking like joker all right i
[52:39] mean it's just
[52:41] remember ant-man adams okay yeah
[52:48] so this is a woman preacher
[52:52] though is a a daughter of god a woman
[52:55] preacher
[52:57] and people for i was like this people 6
[53:00] 000 years ago
[53:00] are still being deceived by her sermon
[53:06] six six thousand years ago and she's
[53:09] still
[53:09] deceiving what was she she was a
[53:11] deceived woman
[53:14] preaching who what preached your own
[53:17] doctrine
[53:18] and paid people take this doctrine and
[53:20] make it a one scripture doctrine
[53:22] now notice what was adam's first what
[53:25] how did adam get in a fall
[53:27] and look how god rebukes adam and and he
[53:29] said in the end because thou
[53:30] has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[53:35] now he did it because he loved her but
[53:37] she had a little cern for him too
[53:39] showing something showing him something
[53:40] new that she had just learned
[53:42] something new that just taken place with
[53:44] her one and god refused him for it
[53:51] modern day joyce meyer right there
[53:54] so that eve was this daughter of god
[53:56] joyce meyer we
[53:58] remains to be seen and as eaten of the
[54:00] tree which i commanded thee
[54:02] saying thou shalt not eat of it now
[54:06] so does this run is cain the son of adam
[54:10] saints of god he is not a son
[54:13] of adam
[54:18] is taking eve's word good enough in the
[54:20] saints of god we gotta
[54:23] let's we have to we had to fact check
[54:24] that
[54:28] god mercy modern day we got back fact
[54:29] checkers
[54:31] we have a fact checker right here this
[54:33] is our fact checker
[54:34] absolutely and it's not too uh
[54:38] atheists or or or satanists who own fact
[54:41] checker but it's actually the very god
[54:42] himself in a book
[54:43] he says okay let's look in here this is
[54:45] our encyclopedia this is our
[54:47] word of god right here all right now the
[54:50] she said that uh let me tell you
[54:53] something
[54:54] the devil hated service this morning so
[54:56] much
[54:58] my laptop quit working back there for an
[55:00] hour
[55:01] i couldn't even get it to pop off it
[55:02] pops off and you can switch it and those
[55:04] sort of things
[55:05] i had you know internet started trying
[55:06] this this and i started praying i said
[55:08] lord god
[55:10] i couldn't even type on it it wouldn't
[55:11] even connect i started praying and after
[55:14] one hour
[55:14] it finally just kicked in and i was like
[55:17] the devil is not happy
[55:18] you know what we're not we're gonna make
[55:19] him more even more unhappy tonight
[55:21] [Laughter]
[55:24] oh absolutely we're gonna we're gonna
[55:25] show uh
[55:27] we're gonna show us something we'll
[55:28] expose him you know all right hey man
[55:30] now
[55:31] let's continue on here so is this
[55:33] correct he says
[55:34] what did eve say i have gotten a man
[55:37] from the lord
[55:38] about cain right now we just went
[55:40] through the scripture there
[55:41] he says the bible says in verse john he
[55:44] says that
[55:44] cain was of the wicked one
[55:48] right now we have two contradicting
[55:50] scriptures
[55:51] what do we do is eve right or is john
[55:54] right
[55:54] or is god the wicked one no
[55:58] there's so many questions you can ask
[56:00] good good
[56:05] okay
[56:08] now here's the parable all these things
[56:09] fake jesus in the on the multitudes
[56:11] without a spirit will speak unto them
[56:12] then it might be filled which was spoken
[56:13] by the prophet saying i will open my
[56:15] mouth in parables
[56:17] he says i will utter things which have
[56:19] been kept secret from the foundations
[56:21] of the foundation of the world right all
[56:24] those
[56:25] seven parables were preached and jesus
[56:27] the bible said that jesus what was he
[56:28] doing
[56:29] he was revealing things that have been
[56:30] kept secret from what from the
[56:32] foundations of the world
[56:36] and after all this his disciples came
[56:38] into him and said
[56:40] he said gee they said jesus what okay
[56:42] those are good but and i don't
[56:44] understand any of them but i really
[56:45] don't understand tares
[56:46] what is tares and jesus said he the
[56:50] soweth the good seed of the son of man
[56:51] the field of the tares the good seed are
[56:53] the children
[56:54] of the kingdom do you know six or seven
[56:57] denominational pastors and their wives
[56:59] shut up when i brought this to them
[57:01] we had the showdown and i said let's
[57:03] read this because this
[57:04] is the interpretation of the parable you
[57:07] can't interpret this parable
[57:09] i can't interpret this parable let's
[57:11] just see what it says
[57:14] it needs no interpretation because this
[57:17] is
[57:18] this is it this is the interpretation
[57:22] but the terrors are the children of the
[57:24] wicked one the enemy that
[57:25] sowed them is the devil
[57:29] my goodness saints of god we cannot get
[57:31] much more plainer now
[57:33] as we run through the trail the serpent
[57:35] continuing on here says now look
[57:37] uh jesus goes through these woes
[57:42] now is is this clear let's let's read
[57:44] this and see how just how clear this is
[57:46] what unto you scribes and pharisees
[57:48] hypocrites because you build the tombs
[57:49] of the prophets and garnish the
[57:50] subcultures of the righteous
[57:51] and say if we had been in the days of
[57:53] our fathers we would not have been
[57:55] partakers with them
[57:56] in the blood of the prophets so they
[57:59] actually said this and jesus heard it
[58:01] and he reiterates it back to them he
[58:03] says wherefore ye be the witnesses unto
[58:05] yourselves
[58:06] the e are the children of them which
[58:08] killed the prophets
[58:10] they could literally run their genealogy
[58:13] all the way back to those that killed
[58:15] jeremiah that tortured these saints of
[58:18] god these men of god and then notice
[58:22] what jesus says
[58:24] fill ye up then the measure of your
[58:27] fathers
[58:29] ye what does he say ye serpents you
[58:32] generation
[58:34] of vipers how can you escape the
[58:35] damnation of hell right
[58:37] behold i send you this one this one this
[58:39] one you persecuted kill them all
[58:40] he says that it may that upon you may
[58:42] come all the righteous blood shut up on
[58:44] the earth
[58:44] from the blood of righteous abel
[58:49] who took cables or abel's blood was cane
[58:52] it traces the lineage he's running
[58:54] he's running the what the the seed all
[58:56] the way back
[58:58] justice we showed stephen did the same
[59:00] thing he ran it all the way back
[59:04] that's the trail blood it's a blood
[59:06] trail our trail is blood and so is
[59:08] theirs
[59:16] amen now is this pretty clear or not yes
[59:19] now look at this
[59:22] another whatsapp snap
[59:26] i've sent the same scripture the serpent
[59:28] she generation of vipers
[59:31] now look what i said being called
[59:33] generation of vipers
[59:35] here is not being called serpent seed
[59:44] okay it's not
[59:47] so do you believe that nicodemus was
[59:49] serpent seed that's not the
[59:51] that's not the question that's not the
[59:52] point the point is there is serpent seed
[59:56] that's the distinction i'm trying to
[59:57] make if cain was a son of god
[1:00:00] then we don't have a problem but if cain
[1:00:03] was the son of the serpent we have a
[1:00:04] major
[1:00:05] issue and that there are still serpents
[1:00:06] here
[1:00:08] because god comes on the scene four
[1:00:10] thousand years later and identifies
[1:00:12] that they are serpents still amongst
[1:00:14] them and in fact it calls them a
[1:00:15] generation
[1:00:16] what is that word generation means it
[1:00:18] means an offspring
[1:00:21] production fruit generation
[1:00:27] generation is an offspring this is the
[1:00:30] book of the generations of adam this is
[1:00:32] the offspring of
[1:00:34] adam in the day that now notice as as
[1:00:37] they went through cain's lineage in
[1:00:38] genesis 4
[1:00:40] moses starts over said okay they went
[1:00:42] this way but he says now this
[1:00:44] is the book of the generations of adam
[1:00:48] now notice in the day that god created
[1:00:50] man what he goes all the way back to
[1:00:52] genesis 1.
[1:00:53] these are the ones that are blessed this
[1:00:55] is the blessed seed line
[1:00:56] these are the ones that's given dominion
[1:00:57] over all the earth all everything to god
[1:01:00] all everything that we needed it was all
[1:01:02] theirs
[1:01:03] this is for them replenish the earth
[1:01:07] takes the dominion subdue everything he
[1:01:09] says this is the generation
[1:01:13] look at exactly what that generation
[1:01:14] means birth generation family history
[1:01:17] same thing so we know the first woman
[1:01:21] caused the fall the first fallen
[1:01:22] preacher calls the fall
[1:01:25] and you know the greatest explanation of
[1:01:26] this comes from the message of this hour
[1:01:29] when a church gets away from the word it
[1:01:31] will believe anything it will
[1:01:33] it is like eve
[1:01:36] right we've all seen this quote when
[1:01:38] cain was born she said i've got the man
[1:01:41] from lord
[1:01:41] now do you realize that she really meant
[1:01:44] that she thought
[1:01:45] that she had a man from the lord so let
[1:01:48] me ask you something
[1:01:49] was cain a man from the lord
[1:01:52] now remember it was a mingled seed
[1:01:56] a saint of god i don't want to bring
[1:01:57] hybrid because that's a modern day term
[1:01:59] i want to use the scriptural term
[1:02:01] mingled or mixed
[1:02:03] because that is a scriptural word
[1:02:06] the serpent was created by god
[1:02:10] but then the son and daughter of god
[1:02:11] were created by god as well
[1:02:13] but when you mixed them this was not in
[1:02:15] the original
[1:02:18] this was not original creation
[1:02:22] he says so you see once she had been
[1:02:24] deceived by taking the word of satan
[1:02:26] instead of the word of god she then
[1:02:27] thought that she but whatever she said
[1:02:30] was
[1:02:30] right and she's smart this is pre-fall
[1:02:34] or sorry this is right after the fall
[1:02:35] very very intelligent woman very
[1:02:37] intelligent man
[1:02:38] she says if she said that she had a man
[1:02:40] from god then she had a man from god
[1:02:42] she believed her own word
[1:02:47] he says but god has set laws in his
[1:02:49] universe a good seed can only bring
[1:02:50] forth good fruit and evil seed can only
[1:02:52] bring forth evil fruit now each seed
[1:02:54] though
[1:02:54] different will utilize the same earth
[1:02:57] nourishment moisture and sunshine but it
[1:02:58] will bring forth after its own kind
[1:03:00] notice the history of the cain's
[1:03:02] line notice the history of seth line
[1:03:04] only one difference between them
[1:03:06] original seed nothing else that's it
[1:03:08] saints of god
[1:03:10] it's not we can see because we're smart
[1:03:12] it's not
[1:03:13] we can see these things and believe
[1:03:14] these things or receive the holy ghost
[1:03:16] because we're anything special
[1:03:17] god placed a seed in us a
[1:03:20] gene a god gene seed not the holy ghost
[1:03:24] a literal gene seed because remember the
[1:03:26] foolish virgin make it as well
[1:03:29] they have representation already up
[1:03:31] there
[1:03:32] they will be seed they will they will be
[1:03:34] saved because what their name was
[1:03:35] already written
[1:03:38] they have to be saved because they are
[1:03:40] seed of god
[1:03:42] if the holy ghost was needed for
[1:03:43] salvation why the old testament saints
[1:03:44] go up
[1:03:46] they had they didn't have it but what
[1:03:47] they had seen representation and they
[1:03:49] had the token for their day
[1:03:52] and if we have seen representation in us
[1:03:54] and which gives us the ears to hear and
[1:03:56] eyes to see
[1:03:57] and we have the baptism of the holy
[1:03:58] ghost saints of god we will make this
[1:04:00] rapture
[1:04:01] amen because we will have in i was like
[1:04:03] this there was a type ours is the
[1:04:04] antitype we have exactly what they have
[1:04:06] except greater amen
[1:04:08] we have the actual literal blood of
[1:04:10] christ amen
[1:04:13] now he says if you look at the statement
[1:04:15] of eve real close you will notice that
[1:04:17] she had more understanding and more root
[1:04:19] than she realized but remember
[1:04:20] we cannot lean on on our own
[1:04:22] understanding we must lean on god's
[1:04:24] understanding
[1:04:25] he says she did not attribute the son to
[1:04:27] satan for that would have made him equal
[1:04:29] with god
[1:04:30] only god could create the egg in the
[1:04:32] womb of mary
[1:04:33] satan couldn't do it and she knew that
[1:04:37] eve knew that satan could only pervert
[1:04:39] so he beguiled her with the wrong seed
[1:04:41] it was the serpent seed that brought
[1:04:43] forth cain it was adam seed that brought
[1:04:44] forth seth and abel abel and seth
[1:04:46] these these seeds went through the exact
[1:04:48] same process but the children were
[1:04:50] different for they come from different
[1:04:51] seeds and that's exactly right
[1:04:54] now notice he just goes through and
[1:04:58] breaks down
[1:04:59] eve's lie
[1:05:02] eve's thoughts he just went through that
[1:05:05] whole
[1:05:06] whole thing right now notice what he
[1:05:07] hits directly after this the prophet of
[1:05:09] god
[1:05:11] if you think this is an exaggeration
[1:05:13] think of second timothy three
[1:05:15] i charge you before god and the lord
[1:05:16] jesus christ who shall bring who shall
[1:05:18] judge the quick and the dead at his
[1:05:20] appearing and his kingdom preach the
[1:05:22] word beating instant incense
[1:05:23] in season out of season rebuke reproof
[1:05:25] exhort with all along suffering
[1:05:27] he says and doctrine he says for the
[1:05:29] time will come will they will not
[1:05:31] endure sound doctrine he ties this
[1:05:34] scripture directly after revelation
[1:05:36] or sorry genesis 4 1.
[1:05:40] this is why because servant seed is
[1:05:41] sound doctrine
[1:05:44] as every time we witness about it i
[1:05:47] break it down in genesis 3
[1:05:48] and i say would you believe it i i've
[1:05:51] i've told you what it is but would you
[1:05:52] believe it if i showed you where john
[1:05:54] the baptist preached it
[1:05:55] jesus preached it peter preached it
[1:05:57] right john the divine priesthood
[1:05:59] and uh paul preached it
[1:06:03] five witnesses in the new testament that
[1:06:05] say this was exactly correct
[1:06:06] amen that's a lot to go against
[1:06:10] right now look at this one here
[1:06:16] was the serpent the father of cain or
[1:06:18] the wicked one
[1:06:22] was the serpent the father of cain or
[1:06:24] the wicked one can't be both
[1:06:26] he said send me your best three
[1:06:27] scriptures
[1:06:29] the devil would literally be the serpent
[1:06:32] in the garden
[1:06:34] the devil was in the garden it was in
[1:06:35] the serpent
[1:06:38] it can be both if the devil was in the
[1:06:40] serpent pretty easy
[1:06:42] the devil's a spirit not physical
[1:06:46] if the devil who is a spirit was in
[1:06:48] sight of animal it's possible
[1:06:51] i mean wow this is not common core
[1:06:56] it happened in ezekiel 28.
[1:07:00] yes he can be inside animal but he can't
[1:07:02] be a literal father
[1:07:04] well let me say it like this
[1:07:07] do you think the serpent come up with
[1:07:08] this idea
[1:07:10] no he did not come up with this
[1:07:14] idea and then i went on
[1:07:22] i keep saying i want your three best
[1:07:23] scriptures
[1:07:25] he says i got 40 scriptures to talk
[1:07:27] about the children of the devil
[1:07:28] not children of the serpent seed two
[1:07:31] separate things
[1:07:32] you see that you see there they have a
[1:07:35] disconnect somewhere there's a
[1:07:36] disconnect
[1:07:38] you know what i found out they don't
[1:07:39] understand they don't understand
[1:07:40] mingling
[1:07:43] and you know the crazy thing is is the
[1:07:45] prophet of god will always say hybrid
[1:07:47] hybrid hybrid hybrid and what the
[1:07:49] prophet god said prophet god said
[1:07:50] once it's hybrid it cannot reproduce and
[1:07:53] that meant that thought is still in them
[1:07:58] because they sent me quote after quote
[1:08:00] after quote
[1:08:02] i said let's forget the prophet you guys
[1:08:04] only believe him forget the prophet
[1:08:05] let's use scriptural words
[1:08:07] mingled you don't mingle this inside you
[1:08:10] bro
[1:08:11] let's just do an example inside brother
[1:08:13] jesse
[1:08:14] there was mingled seed a lot of female
[1:08:18] and two males so far
[1:08:20] [Laughter]
[1:08:22] well how come brother jesse he's a male
[1:08:23] he only brought forth he should only
[1:08:24] bring four men
[1:08:25] no because there's women and men mingled
[1:08:28] within his scene
[1:08:30] that's impossible
[1:08:32] [Laughter]
[1:08:35] but what if there was a creature who
[1:08:38] could mingle
[1:08:39] between human and man
[1:08:42] and not only would there be men and
[1:08:43] women serpent
[1:08:45] but there could be men and women sons of
[1:08:47] god all within the same line
[1:08:51] both genders two separate seed lines
[1:08:54] all mingled if you have you ever see the
[1:08:56] double helix the dna
[1:08:58] why is it twisted like a serpent when
[1:09:00] they have performed the rituals
[1:09:02] ever see the snakes in the snake pit
[1:09:04] reproduce they twist like that
[1:09:06] just like the helix
[1:09:09] just a thought for you let's continue on
[1:09:13] here
[1:09:14] so saints of god do you do ye thus
[1:09:17] requite the lord o foolish people and
[1:09:20] wise is he not thy father that has
[1:09:21] brought thee
[1:09:22] hath he not made thee in establishing
[1:09:24] remember the days of old jesus
[1:09:25] remember the days of old consider the
[1:09:27] years of many generations
[1:09:29] ask thy father and he will shooting thy
[1:09:31] elders and they shall tell thee
[1:09:32] when the most high divided the nations
[1:09:34] their inheritance
[1:09:35] when he separated the sons of adam
[1:09:39] well these must be separate from the
[1:09:41] sons of god
[1:09:43] no they're one and the same that's right
[1:09:45] amen
[1:09:47] he said the bounds of the people
[1:09:48] according to the name is the number of
[1:09:50] the children
[1:09:51] of israel here we see cain's lineage
[1:09:54] correct yeah all the way through we know
[1:09:57] these i mean this is basics
[1:09:59] here we see adam plunge
[1:10:03] yeah starter right he goes right back to
[1:10:04] genesis 1. yes
[1:10:07] you're once again the serpent she's
[1:10:08] generally just ranged vipers
[1:10:10] uh now notice he says here
[1:10:13] he says uh look at verse 32
[1:10:16] fill ye up then the measure of your
[1:10:19] fathers do you know what's a prophecy
[1:10:20] what's the measure of their fathers
[1:10:24] all i see is they're drunken with the
[1:10:25] blood of the saints of the martyrs of
[1:10:27] jesus christ
[1:10:28] that's right but he says fill ye up
[1:10:31] what was the last thing they had to kill
[1:10:34] the messiah himself
[1:10:36] you ever catch that stephen caught up
[1:10:38] with this you stiff nicked and
[1:10:40] uncircumcised and hard and ears you do
[1:10:41] always resist the holy ghost as your
[1:10:43] fathers did so to you
[1:10:44] which are the prophets have you not your
[1:10:46] father's not persecuted
[1:10:47] and they have slain them who shoot
[1:10:49] before the coming of the just one of
[1:10:51] whom ye have
[1:10:52] now been the betrayers and murders they
[1:10:54] fulfilled it
[1:10:55] jesus said fill it up phillips uh
[1:10:58] stephen comes and says
[1:10:59] you filled it up you fulfilled it
[1:11:00] exactly
[1:11:02] and what they killed them for all right
[1:11:06] see they're trailed just as bloody
[1:11:08] that's right
[1:11:10] absolutely now i want to get to this
[1:11:12] nugget
[1:11:13] i want to prove
[1:11:17] that genesis 4 1 is out of line out of
[1:11:19] timeline
[1:11:21] yes okay hope you're ready this might be
[1:11:24] basic
[1:11:27] but it's so clear once you see the
[1:11:29] scriptures
[1:11:30] now let's jump to this
[1:11:34] genesis 3 13
[1:11:37] and the lord said to the woman what is
[1:11:39] it that thou has done
[1:11:41] and the woman said the serpent begaw me
[1:11:42] and i eat and the lord
[1:11:44] god said unto the serpent behold thou
[1:11:46] hast done this thou are cursed above the
[1:11:48] cattle above every beast of the field
[1:11:49] upon the belly that shall go
[1:11:50] and thus shalt thou eat all the days and
[1:11:52] life he says and i will put
[1:11:54] hatred between thee and the woman
[1:11:58] and between thy seed who's he talking to
[1:12:03] the serpent he is talking to the animal
[1:12:07] and he said the animal had seed
[1:12:11] yes
[1:12:16] so here's the question brother johnny
[1:12:19] who has seed the male or the female
[1:12:27] the male has seed
[1:12:30] the male carries the seed that's why i
[1:12:33] take on the last name of the mayo
[1:12:36] yes but notice what it says between
[1:12:40] thy seed and
[1:12:43] percy
[1:12:46] i thought the male carried the seed and
[1:12:47] not the female
[1:12:49] but god said
[1:12:53] thy seed and her
[1:12:57] seed it shall bruise ahead and thou
[1:13:00] shalt bruise his heel
[1:13:02] he said the woman had seed
[1:13:09] but i thought the men only carried the
[1:13:10] seed here is dealing with abraham and
[1:13:12] isaac he says unto thy seed will i give
[1:13:14] this land
[1:13:15] then we see isaac he says i'll make thy
[1:13:18] seed to multiply the stars of the stars
[1:13:19] of heaven
[1:13:21] right how can a woman have seed
[1:13:24] she only carries the egg
[1:13:32] i notice this is a little terrible here
[1:13:33] jesus escaped then came over to the
[1:13:35] the sadducees which say there's no
[1:13:37] resurrection they said to him
[1:13:39] master moses wrote unto us if a man's
[1:13:42] brother died and he leave his wife
[1:13:43] behind him and leave no children
[1:13:45] then his brother should take his wife
[1:13:46] and raise up seed unto his brother right
[1:13:49] who carries a seed the man
[1:13:53] and now there were seven brothers and
[1:13:55] the first took a wife
[1:13:56] and died dying left no seed
[1:14:00] and the second took her and died left
[1:14:01] and he neither left any seed and the
[1:14:03] third likewise and the seven and seven
[1:14:05] had her
[1:14:06] and left no seed
[1:14:09] the male carries the seed right
[1:14:14] how does eve have seed
[1:14:19] in leviticus 12 and the lord said to
[1:14:22] moses saying
[1:14:23] speak unto the children rizzo's saying
[1:14:25] if a woman have
[1:14:26] conceived seed
[1:14:32] and born a man-child
[1:14:36] what i'm trying to say is that god is
[1:14:39] saying
[1:14:40] that once the seed goes forth from the
[1:14:42] man where's the seed at
[1:14:45] in the woman
[1:14:49] eve was already pregnant
[1:14:52] because once the woman receives seed
[1:14:55] whose seed is it
[1:14:56] it's her seed
[1:15:02] because if a woman have conceived seed
[1:15:06] and born a man-child now notice notice
[1:15:09] the law of jealousies
[1:15:11] well if a man if the spirit of jealousy
[1:15:13] would rise up a man and
[1:15:14] and he thinks that she had cheated on
[1:15:16] him or whatever and and it goes to the
[1:15:18] priest and there was there was a certain
[1:15:19] thing they had to drink a certain kind
[1:15:20] of water and ashes and all kinds of mix
[1:15:22] and if she drank it and her thigh begins
[1:15:25] to rot
[1:15:25] she's guilty but if she drank it
[1:15:29] and nothing takes place if the woman be
[1:15:32] not defiled but clean
[1:15:34] then she shall be free and conceived c
[1:15:38] she shall have c
[1:15:41] in other words she can become she's she
[1:15:43] can be pregnant
[1:15:44] conceiving c is pregnancy yes
[1:15:52] and eli blessed akana and his wife and
[1:15:54] said the lord give
[1:15:55] the seed of this woman
[1:16:00] how does a woman see come out of a woman
[1:16:02] she's got to be being her
[1:16:04] yes good good for the loan which is lent
[1:16:07] the lord and they went their own
[1:16:09] home through faith also sarah received
[1:16:13] herself received strength to conceive
[1:16:17] seed yes
[1:16:21] he was already pregnant god said between
[1:16:23] thy seed
[1:16:25] and adam's seed
[1:16:28] his seed her seed she was already
[1:16:32] pregnant
[1:16:38] now notice and adam knew his wife again
[1:16:40] and she bear a son and called his name
[1:16:41] seth for god said
[1:16:43] god has said she said appointment
[1:16:45] another seed god gave her what
[1:16:47] another seed instead of abel who came
[1:16:50] slew
[1:16:52] she received seed it was her seed when
[1:16:55] she were praying pregnant this is
[1:16:57] my seed this is my son this is my
[1:17:00] daughter this is mine now
[1:17:05] yes and look at hagar here
[1:17:08] this was this was powerful this is what
[1:17:10] lord show me in there
[1:17:12] now sarah abraham abram's wife bear him
[1:17:14] no children and she had a handmaid of
[1:17:16] an egyptian whose name was haggar and
[1:17:18] sarah came unto abram
[1:17:19] and behold now the lord hath restrained
[1:17:20] me from bearing i pray that go unto thy
[1:17:22] my
[1:17:22] my maid if it may be that i obtain
[1:17:25] children by her and heart and abraham
[1:17:27] hearken
[1:17:27] to the voice of sarai listen to another
[1:17:30] woman preacher
[1:17:31] and he went in verse four into hagar and
[1:17:34] she
[1:17:35] conceived and when she saw that she had
[1:17:38] conceived her mistress was despised in
[1:17:40] her eyes
[1:17:41] because verse five and when she saw that
[1:17:43] she had conceived i was despised and
[1:17:45] rise lowers between
[1:17:46] lord judge between me and thee right so
[1:17:49] here
[1:17:50] abraham goes into sarah
[1:17:53] i'm sorry hagar hagar conceives seed
[1:17:56] now notice the angel of the lord
[1:18:01] but abraham said unto sarah i behold thy
[1:18:03] hand man as thy hand
[1:18:04] is in thy hand do her as it pleases
[1:18:07] pleases and when sarah dealt hardly with
[1:18:09] her she fled from her face and the angel
[1:18:11] of the lord found her by the fountain of
[1:18:13] water in the wilderness by the fountain
[1:18:14] in the way of
[1:18:16] uh sure and he said who the angel lord
[1:18:19] hagar
[1:18:19] says hey might whence cometh thou and
[1:18:22] whether the ghost thou
[1:18:23] whither thou goest and she said i flee
[1:18:26] from the face of my mistress sarai
[1:18:28] and the angel the lord sent to a return
[1:18:30] to thy mistress and submit thyself under
[1:18:31] her hands and the angel lords unto her
[1:18:33] i will multiply thy seed
[1:18:44] i thought it was abraham's seed not when
[1:18:47] it's in
[1:18:48] her it then becomes the seed of the
[1:18:52] woman
[1:18:56] eve was already pregnant
[1:19:00] i'll put enmity between thee and the
[1:19:02] woman and between thy seed and
[1:19:04] her seat she was already pregnant
[1:19:11] to me that was absolutely
[1:19:17] it makes no sense any other way yeah
[1:19:23] amen now is there such a thing as a
[1:19:26] mingling
[1:19:27] now when these things were done the
[1:19:28] princes he says came to me saying the
[1:19:30] people of israel and the priests and
[1:19:32] levites have not
[1:19:33] separated themselves from the people of
[1:19:35] the lands doing according to their
[1:19:37] abominations
[1:19:37] even of the canaanites the hittites
[1:19:39] pesorites jebusites amorites moabites
[1:19:42] egyptians and amorites for they have
[1:19:44] taken of their daughters
[1:19:46] for themselves and for their sons so
[1:19:47] that they that the holy
[1:19:49] seed have mingled themselves
[1:19:52] is there a holy seed absolutely is the
[1:19:55] sea gene of god
[1:19:57] and here ezra is disgusted
[1:20:01] why because this is the original sin and
[1:20:03] when i heard this thing i read my
[1:20:05] garment and mantle and plucked off the
[1:20:06] hair of my head and my beard oh
[1:20:08] and sat down as the stone astonished
[1:20:10] stoned
[1:20:13] here in isaiah 6 13
[1:20:16] here says so the holy seed shall be the
[1:20:18] substance thereof and if you read this
[1:20:20] this is exactly what jesus said in
[1:20:21] matthew 13.
[1:20:25] he said he said just keep preaching he
[1:20:27] says they will not be able to hear
[1:20:29] they'll not be able to see but he says
[1:20:31] what he says but then i'll leave them a
[1:20:32] tenth and it shall return and shall be
[1:20:34] eaten
[1:20:34] as the teal tree and as an oak whose
[1:20:37] substance is
[1:20:38] in them when they cast their leaves in
[1:20:39] other words when it looks like it's dead
[1:20:41] he says there's still going to be seed
[1:20:42] left
[1:20:44] and it'll be what the holy seed shall be
[1:20:46] the substance of amen
[1:20:47] sure now is there hybrid
[1:20:50] possible in animal life absolutely
[1:20:54] hybrid bluegill will produce within your
[1:20:56] pond
[1:20:58] so not every single hybrid cannot
[1:21:00] produce
[1:21:01] there's at least one and i'll say
[1:21:03] there's at least two
[1:21:06] we know what the second one is but
[1:21:08] here's another one
[1:21:10] and if this be possible
[1:21:14] what else could be possible
[1:21:18] so i thought genesis 4 1 was literal
[1:21:23] if it was literal why would adam say
[1:21:25] that she was the mother of all living
[1:21:29] she was all what remember as as god came
[1:21:32] down and judged the serpent
[1:21:34] thy seed and her seed and then she moved
[1:21:36] to eve
[1:21:37] adam was right there and he heard it
[1:21:38] said oh my goodness she's pregnant he
[1:21:42] said i'm gonna give you a name change
[1:21:44] you're no longer adam like me he says
[1:21:45] you're different he said you're eve he
[1:21:47] says and you will be the mother of all
[1:21:48] living
[1:21:50] all right absolutely now did the serpent
[1:21:52] have seed
[1:21:53] it says so here's sir
[1:21:57] here here's the the the old serpent
[1:21:59] himself
[1:22:00] lucifer sun in the morning breaks down
[1:22:03] his plan right here
[1:22:04] he accomplishes the plan all the way
[1:22:06] into the size of the north if you study
[1:22:07] that deep
[1:22:08] sides of the north you know what that
[1:22:09] means uh they shall look narrowly
[1:22:11] nearly upon thee and consider thee
[1:22:13] saying is this the man
[1:22:15] that hath made the earth to tremble to
[1:22:17] shake the nations now jump down to 20
[1:22:20] he says he says thou shalt not be joined
[1:22:22] with them and burial because thou has
[1:22:23] destroyed thy land and slain
[1:22:24] thy people he's slain his own people
[1:22:27] servant
[1:22:28] satan doesn't care about his own
[1:22:29] children he could care less
[1:22:31] he's the most jealous self-centered
[1:22:34] creature on the face if there was ever
[1:22:36] fallen
[1:22:40] he says the seed of the evil doers shall
[1:22:42] never be renowned
[1:22:44] prepare slaughter for his children
[1:22:48] for iniquity for the iniquity of their
[1:22:50] fathers that they do not rise nor
[1:22:52] possess land nor fill the face of the
[1:22:54] world with cities here it is uh
[1:22:58] psalms 37 28 for the lord loveth
[1:23:01] judgment
[1:23:02] and forsaketh not his saints for they
[1:23:03] are preserved forever but the seed of
[1:23:05] the wicked shall be cut off
[1:23:07] god mercy saints this is clear he says
[1:23:10] here in second peter 2
[1:23:12] he says uh verse 12 but these as natural
[1:23:15] brute beasts
[1:23:16] made i was in a discussion with a couple
[1:23:20] baptists at a baptist church one time
[1:23:21] and i shared this with them they said
[1:23:23] you you don't have any scripture i said
[1:23:24] what are you talking about i said i
[1:23:25] wrote i read in romans nine and they're
[1:23:27] like
[1:23:27] i said they said show me one scripture
[1:23:29] where it says they were made that way
[1:23:33] yeah okay shannon's accepted
[1:23:36] he says they were made to be taken and
[1:23:39] destroyed and they they quit their
[1:23:40] conversation right there
[1:23:42] you want it you got it he says speak
[1:23:45] evil of things that they
[1:23:46] do not understand
[1:23:50] what if they understand malachi 4 and
[1:23:52] shall utterly perish in their own
[1:23:54] corruption he says look having eyes full
[1:23:57] of what took place in the beginning
[1:24:00] he says that they cannot cease from sin
[1:24:02] he says
[1:24:03] beguiling exactly from the beginning
[1:24:05] unstable
[1:24:06] souls look now they're giving souls
[1:24:09] a heart with ha they have exercises with
[1:24:11] covetousness practices
[1:24:13] cursed children they're already cursed
[1:24:18] ways of balaam and those sort of ways
[1:24:22] he says but speak evil those things
[1:24:24] which they know not
[1:24:25] notice peter and jude have the exact
[1:24:28] same revelation
[1:24:30] of these people they've observed them
[1:24:32] peter's watched this and
[1:24:34] they do this jude's coming back and says
[1:24:36] yep they do the exact same thing i saw
[1:24:38] them do
[1:24:40] why because an evil tree cannot bring
[1:24:42] forth good fruit
[1:24:44] they bring forth the same thing every
[1:24:46] single time
[1:24:50] speak evil of the things which they know
[1:24:52] not they don't understand it
[1:24:54] but what they do know naturally is brew
[1:24:56] beasts are they spiritual
[1:24:58] or what no the bible says they're
[1:24:59] natural brute beasts
[1:25:01] in those things they corrupt themselves
[1:25:04] wound to them for they have gone in the
[1:25:06] way of
[1:25:07] their daddy right and read greatly at
[1:25:10] the air of their daddy
[1:25:13] and perish in the way again saying of
[1:25:14] their other daddy
[1:25:18] amen
[1:25:21] now let's ask this eve had seed right
[1:25:26] what if they say well this is a prophecy
[1:25:28] of christ
[1:25:33] but who's he talking to is he talking to
[1:25:35] eve he's not talking to eve
[1:25:38] he's talking to the serpent i'll put em
[1:25:41] between thee and the woman between thy
[1:25:43] seed and her seed who is what they say
[1:25:45] most scholars believe that her seed is
[1:25:48] jesus
[1:25:49] right and her is mary
[1:25:53] seed and thy seed if jesus is fulfilled
[1:25:57] here then we should see
[1:26:00] serpents in jesus's time
[1:26:04] did we see serpents in jesus time john
[1:26:07] the baptist says oh
[1:26:08] jesus said so peter said so john said so
[1:26:11] and so did paul
[1:26:12] [Laughter]
[1:26:15] prophecy fulfilled thy seed
[1:26:18] he says and shall bruise thy head and
[1:26:20] shall bruise thy heel
[1:26:24] what serpent never got their head
[1:26:26] bruised
[1:26:28] who's he talking to satan
[1:26:31] wait so he's talking to two people at
[1:26:33] once
[1:26:35] the serpent and satan absolutely
[1:26:39] yes absolutely he says thy seed
[1:26:42] he says in satan i'm going to bruise
[1:26:44] your head who's in the serpent
[1:26:46] who did this satan inside
[1:26:49] the devil i'm sorry the devil inside of
[1:26:52] the serpent
[1:26:53] it's an incarnation a manifestation or
[1:26:56] like this uh

[1:27:04] with god mercy we're
[1:27:05] in an hour so sorry
[1:27:09] he's dealing with serpents absolutely
[1:27:13] he says either make the tree good and
[1:27:15] his fruit good or else make the tree
[1:27:17] corrupt and his fruit cropped or the
[1:27:19] tree is
[1:27:19] for the tree is known by his fruit oh
[1:27:22] generation of vipers how can ye
[1:27:24] being evil he calls them evil they
[1:27:26] cannot bring forth good
[1:27:28] speak good things he says for out of the
[1:27:30] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:27:32] speaketh a good man out of the good
[1:27:34] treasure of his heart
[1:27:36] bringeth forth good things and the evil
[1:27:37] man out of his evil evil treasure
[1:27:39] bringeth forth
