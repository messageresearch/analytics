Lord God but the Holy Ghost move Lord for thy sake o God we preview our by Jesus Christ every set Devastator Bibles and smote you Revelation chapter 3 this morning I like to look at part three of the Philadelphia Church age this morning grace revelation three verse seven relation three verse seven we're gonna read seven eight nine by the grace of the Lord revelation three seven eight and nine just to reminder next Sunday after the first service we'll have the Lord's Supper so please examine yourself this week by the grace of the Lord make sure your heart is in the right place with the Lord and today you know we're gonna preach on this scripture and then tonight we'll do a Bible study on worship I just would like to get back to the foundation of what is real worship I would like to look at that tonight at four o'clock by the grace of God will just do a Bible study because but Laura st. here and but we'll just try to look at worship we want to make sure we're true worshipers we want to make sure we're worshiping in the spirit and in truth so let's hear as we examine ourselves this week let's prepare for the Lord's Supper the following week after that is of course Thanksgiving and we'll just have one service that Sunday but we'll have a carry in for all those people who don't travel like myself we'll stay with you and we'll have a carry in of the following Sunday I believe it's a 26 if I'm not mistaken so the next two weekends we have communion next week and then the following we have a carry and by the grace of Lord how many appreciate the Lord amen God is so good to us sorry I'm getting a little slow turning there okay revelation 3 verse 7 we read seven eight and nine let's read seven together and I'll read eight and nine so let's begin with seven on three one two three and to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth now read verse eight and I myself I know thy works Christ knows our works this morning I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name now verse nine is where we're going to end Lord willing I'm going to kind of well at least when I studied the Holy Spirit let me pass verse eight to go to verse nine behold I'll make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee what a striking thought there Jesus was going to make sure all the liars knew who the people were that he really loved what a striking thought well that's just by adds a word of Prayer just like if you just have an eat on your heart just maybe you raise your hand to the Lord as we approach the Lord today have any father we love you Lord God and you pray you speak to us through this thy word have any father thank you for these red letter words Lord God the words of thy Son Jesus where we know there's no prophet today that's physically on the scene so we know the Prophet is the Holy Ghost so we're asking the supernatural prophet of the Holy Ghost to break his word to us Lord speak Lord to us help me Lord God may be revealed in your word revealed in power revealed in simplicity Lord God Lord that your people might receive you and rejoice Lord and let these holy words change them let the word be imparted to their souls in Jesus Christ's name I never said amen god bless you didn't see the praise God so we like to switch over Malachi we have just some quotes today by the grace of Lord and some scriptures to show by the God's grace we're looking at the Philadelphia Church age which was from 1750 to 1906 and the messenger was John Wesley we spent part one looking at John Wesley's life and so we looked into his life and the white or the life of his mother Susannah Wesley is it not switching over okay let me get this and I hope you were blessed by that I was truly inspired by that by God's grace to see the sacrifice of Susanna Wesley Knight is she had 19 children but only 10 of them lived and she just did everything she could do to make sure her children heard the Word of God and she would meet with them individually you know and so forth at night and would administer to them even when their her husband was out so John Wesley of course being the most famous you know that the messenger of the age he was the man of God who preached the message of sanctification which was cleanliness in heart and life that's what sanctification is cleanliness in heart in life how many 1 a a pure heart before God a clean heart before God that's John Wesley preached that he lived from 1703 to 1791 he lived 87 years preaching 800 sermons a year my and traveling thousands of miles by horseback truly he was a star in the hand of God could you say amen to that truly he was a star of the seven stars truly he was a star what an example he is for us so looking at part three this morning and then we'll look at worship you know tonight we'll just do Bible study on true worship by God's grace you know we're looking at this age right here of the yellow here this is the sixth church age here the battle which we'll get to a little bit today will begin this is the synagogue of satan' that's what they battled most was people that said they were believers but were not we would call that a very deceptive enemy right because today you know Christianity is widely popular around the world but we know Jesus said there still be very few that find the way to true salvation today so we know there's a great deception going on today and they were battling just as we are as we are in our day synagogues of states and churches that said they were true churches but were lying they were not true churches and so that's what John Wesley and the Saints in those days had to battle and we know there's a carryover remember Wednesday we looked at the lap over well actually I was two Wednesdays ago we looked at the lap over between the ages and we know there's a lap over so we know they battled the anointing of the Black Horse writer it was the anointing that had the balances member the rider had the balance it is in his hand and he was after money and power and we see that effect still on churches today churches that go after money and go after power more than they go after obedience to the Word of God and so that's this is the context in which John Wesley was preaching the words of life amen now we're preaching in a were in a time where where the the battle we have is the lukewarm spirit and how many win in the battle by God's grace amen on fire fill with the Holy Ghost a passion to know his word praise God a strong desire fervent desire to please him and a strong passion to read the Word of God amen to grow from the Holy Spirit that's someone who's on fire today walk in the spirit not walking in the flesh and so in the first two parts we completed the summary that's the city the age and the messenger we looked at the messenger and his mother again I'm just going to go past that because I just briefly taught about that but one thing I want to say about Susanna Wesley every child to her was a talent from God it wasn't a burden like most families today in America it's a burden to have another child but Susanna Wesley saw each child as a talent which is a valuable piece of money she saw this is a very valuable gift that I've been given I have to make sure I treat this talent with utmost respect amen and what a great example she was to all the mothers we saw that a few Wednesday's ago and so today we'll look at the salutation we're looking at verse 7 Jesus's words to the Philadelphia Church age that was battling the synagogue of satan' this age that was battling churches that were kingdom building on earth rather than storing up treasures in heaven mine and so we're told the key to understanding verse 7 is actually in verse 9 s that's why I just felt led to go there that's what we're told the key to understanding verse 7 is so here's verse 7 we already read that together as a congregation and and we're taught these words from our prophet William Aaron Branham he said oh how beautiful are those words how majestic is even the sound of them how thrilling to think that all those attributes can be applied to one person who would dare to such things about or say such things about himself but Jesus Christ the Lord of glory who else would say I'm holy I'm true and I have the key of David who else would say that except the Holy One amen glory he said I believe the key to interpreting exactly what each of these wonderfully descriptive phrases means is found in verse 9 that's why we read 7 8 and 9 so you really can't understand chapter I'm sorry chapter 3 verse 7 without understanding verse 9 in chapter 3 so let's look at verse 9 again I have it up here for you I know it's kind of small but hopefully you can see it okay behold I'll make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they're Jews and are not but do lie behold I'll make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee what a statement from the Lord Jesus the Prophet says I say this verse is the key because it deals with the Jews who have always called themselves a children of God to the exclusion of everyone else they crucified and killed the Lord Jesus Christ their terrible deed brought their own blood upon their own heads for centuries all because they refused Jesus as their Messiah which indeed he was to them he was not the coming one or the Son of David to them he was Beelzebub or some unrighteous one only fit for Destruction so to understand how he's holy and he's true we must know that his enemies accuse him of being everything else but that his enemy said he was not holy his enemies said he was a liar but we know that Jesus always told the truth amen but here's where the Jews brought upon themselves the blood curse as it's called you know commonly amongst theologians or just preachers you know we'd say when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I'm innocent of the blood of this just person ce2 it then answered all the people and said his blood be upon us and our children so the Jews said let Jesus's blood be if you don't want it on yours put it on us and anyone that knows history knows that less than 40 years later Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus Israel was encamped around for two years by Titus no one got out and no one got in and they literally starved them to death and overtook the city and that was God's judgment against them because they rejected Christ oh we should receive Christ today with all of our hearts amen there's no reason to refuse him there's no reason to doubt him we must always believe him amen there's responsibility everybody has responsibility to receive Christ today if not his blood may be upon our hands because that's what the scripture tells us now we know even though the history of Pilate I read about him in the lexicon in the history he said he washed it off his hands but he didn't he actually went crazy at them in his life and committed suicide he tried to get exalted to some other positions and eventually lost his life and he never got that blood off his hands because the only way to get it off your hands is to put it on your heart praise God and to fall in love with the blood of Jesus amen the sacrifice of Christ that's the only way to get the blood off your hands is to say Lord fill me with your love amen fill me with the passion to know Christ Jesus amen and remember the Nazi resume carried out the Holocaust for over six million Jews were slain all of this happened because they called Jesus so Beelzebub they said oh he's not our Messiah although they knew he met the scriptures right because that's what Nicodemus said we know your teacher sent from God they knew he was a the word of God they knew he had supernatural power but they crucified Him anyway because he preached against their churches and their denominations I don't know about you but I'm open to any word of God that will convict me or show me I'm wrong I want any Word of God to show me where I'm wrong I just want to be right amen I don't have to come to this church always I don't have to I don't have to be pastor here always but I do always want to love Jesus Christ and believe all the Word of God that he has for me praise God but they were so caught up in their church that they wouldn't accept the word their fresh word for their day and because of that a millions of Jews have been scattered around the world and lost their lives because they didn't appreciate Jesus Christ and respect who he actually was amen hallelujah but not so to the Jews now to us he was indeed Immanuel God manifest in the flesh he is indeed Messiah surely he was exactly as he now sets himself forth to be there he is the same Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever the Holy One in the midst of the lampstands is the very same Jesus who walked the shores of Galilee who healed the sick who raised the dead and who in spite of irrefutable proof was crucified and killed but he rose again and is seated at the right hand on the Majesty on high glory now in the next portion the Prophet shows why or shows what the Jews thought and what they should have thought so we're going to see the difference between a synagogue of satan' versus true Christianity and these are the examples the Prophet gives in the book so the Prophet says the Christians call Jesus the Holy One but the jews called him Beelzebub but they knew he was God they knew it was God's men the Jews decided to keep the law instead of accepting grace the Jews eventually perished for because of this because of calling Jesus the Beelzebub but the Christians were saved by the grace of God the Jews all their churches all their synagogues became became synagogues of Satan but all the Christian gatherings became gatherings of the Holy Ghost amen they had synagogues of death but the Christian had synagogues of life hey man aren't you glad to be filled with the life of Christ amen how did I'm so good I'm happier about that than anything else I know amen is he filled with the life of Jesus Christ amen since this word indeed expressed perfect realization as against the idea of partial realization now these are some deep terms I don't usually use so bear with me all right this is what the Prophet teaches in the church age book is very deep as illustrated in these verses we can now understand as never before anti-type contrasted with type and substance with shadow so let me just back up a little bit so see the law was a shadow how many know the law was a good thing the Bible said the law was a good thing because it was given by the hands of angels and the Moses praise God it contained promises hallelujah the law was good to those that were good to the law I'll say like that that's right now of course the law was also a school teacher to bring us to Christ amen so the law taught us what God was really like it taught us what was holy and unholy aren't you glad about that amen that God taught us what was wrong and what was right to show us the difference between being out and being pure praise God he showed us the difference but this was all shadow that's why I put it in black there it's all shadow of what was to come in Jesus Christ and so I'll go to the next one I got some new words up there this is a partial realization of God the Jews had a partial realization they actually cooked all the shewbread right that you the priest would cook 12 loaves of shewbread and leave it there before the altar of incense and and it would smell good and and fresh and get a New York we all like fresh bread don't we and there's something about our flesh brother bang that just mmm you like fresh bread but that's a partial understanding they were serving God and God allowed them to do that that natural bread for thousands of years but when Jesus came he said I am the bread and I'll say like this there's nothing as fresh there's nothing as satisfying there's nothing that will feel outside of the true bread Jesus Christ amen he's the perfect realization of bread today amen hallelujah if you're hungry today Jesus will fill you hallelujah you can eat natural bread we can go out to eat afterwards and you could brought your Packer lunch and that will fill you up for a little while but that's just a partial reality of what Christ really is when you really feed on Christ you do not hunger after worldly things anymore amen it's impossible because Christ is perfect reality of being fulfilled and satisfied with bread amen if you leave out of here and hear the preaching of the word and you're still not satisfied something's wrong with how you're feeding we should God called us here to come every day and we're to hear and live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God amen it's our responsibility as we said to eat the true bread the Word of God hallelujah to feast on the Word of God and let it satisfy your every longing amen but see when people come to our church or any Church and they leave out hungry and their souls something's wrong they're so hungry for the things of the world they eat what God asked them to eat praise God because Christ is perfect bread Christ is perfect fulfillment and satisfaction that's exactly right next is the vine this example brother bran gives in John 15 verse 5 jesus said I am the true vine I mean oh he said that so Christ is the true vine and if he's a true vine brother amen then I'm a true branch hallelujah oh yeah you know you might go to the vine we have an orchard right across of our street and we can I can drive pass and see the grapes hang in there you know at harvest time I think that's a pretty nice that's a natural vine and we thank God for the natural grapes you know in the and the wine you know we haven't communion in different things we thank God for the grape juice and all these all these fruits from the earth but Jesus is saying I'm the true vine I'm the one who's got real life giving resources praise God I am your harvest amen i I have what you need and in other words he's saying I'm the true vine and you'd be a true branch hallelujah you let my life flow through you and you'll bring forth the fruits of the spirit the true fruits of the spirit right not a mocking or not an impersonation but the true fruits of the spear hallelujah let's read that real quick while we're there let's go to it back to Galatians 5 the true fruits of the Spirit if he's the true vine and you're the true branch then you'll truly produce the true fruit of the Spirit amen and that is part of the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's part of it notice I said part because the Evans only ghost is all the word living all the Word of God for your age so this is part of the word for our age so this is part of the evidence of the Holy Ghost is having the fruits of the spirit now here's the works of the verse 19 Galatians 5:19 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery so people that are married and have relations with other people adulterers fornication people who are not married and have relations physically uncleanness which is just unbridled life lasciviousness is a lawless life there's no rules for me and I can do whatever I want I can enjoy all my lusts that's lasciviousness idolatry is giving anything worship except Christ anything you get more worship than Christ is an idol witchcraft is course spells witchcraft and also the use of drugs like we have a lot of that around Akron with the what's it called the the opiate crisis is that what it's called a Scott is that the right word Oh p8 okay thank you they had a convention on it at our school last week I didn't go I think that church that night but there's a big crisis in Northeast Ohio if only and they knew that was witchcraft working behind that spirit if only they knew that's witchcraft and it takes the Holy Ghost to deliver somebody from that it's exactly right hatred there should be just love in our church we should just hate sin praise God variance which I didn't look that one up emulations our divisions so dividing the church dividing families dividing friendships wrath anger right strife arguments seditions false teachings and heresies or even worse additions right there heresies that go completely against the Word of God envyings when you envy other people murdering and that's just killing someone's influence right it could be physical murder but Jesus said it's being upset with someone without a cause drunkenness of course drinking revellings are part late parties into the night and suchlike of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God and the church said they will not inherit the kingdom of God this is New Testament teaching I'll say like this this is the law of the Spirit today amen we're not under the law stones one of the law of the spear today and the Holy Spirit says these are works of the flesh this is someone who's catering to their flesh and not serving the Holy Spirit Nelligan verse 22 but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law look at verse 24 and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so when you're really walking in the spirit you've crucified the desire to have fornication you crucified the desire to envy to drink alcohol and a drunken state right to have idols in your life when you're walking the spirit you've crucified lasciviousness now I need boundaries in my life I need the word to rule my life I need the Holy Spirit's role you've crucified those feelings amen I don't end me this person anymore because I've crucified that by the power of God amen this is fruit of the Spirit this is when you're a part of the True Vine this is what flows out of your life amen this one flows out of a true branch how do you I'm glad to be a true man branch hallelujah by the grace of God we won't have any real we'll have partial realization in a natural vine even next week with communion it's partial realization but the real communion is in our prayer life leading up to that and of course it's every day if you don't have communion this morning I feel sorry for you you should had communion this morning with Jesus Christ is that right exactly right because it's communion all the time hallelujah now see there's partial forgiveness the sins were covered but with Jesus the sins are forgotten amen there is no record in the mind of God of those sins hallelujah that's perfect realization of being forgiven he doesn't even remember that you did it praise God because the word justification means declared righteous he declares you righteous as though you never did it hallelujah and this is what I love too under the law the Jews had some sin desire their their conscience wasn't cleared they still had a desire to sin and this is how you know you're really born again you have no desire to sin you have no desire for the things of the world always you have a desire for is more of Jesus Christ that's the only thing that satisfies because he's the true bread you've tasted the true bread and you're satisfied with that bread hallelujah amen the blood of bulls and goats can never do away with that sin conscience but the blood of Jesus Christ does away with it amen you say even if someone you were all alone in the room and you know nobody was watching you you still wouldn't get drunk or you still wouldn't have a cigarette absolutely I still would not I would still abstain because I know God's in that room with me amen and I know God's inside of me in this room praise God and this room wants to praise the Lord hallelujah and serve God hallelujah it's exactly right we're doing partial realization of of God versus a perfect realization of God that's what we see when he says I'm true I'm holy I have the key of David this is what he's saying here he's saying I'm I'm giving you a perfect reality of God and man today aren't you glad for that hey man I'm happy but as I said I'm happy about that anything else I know Amen that you and I can have a perfect realization of a relationship with Jesus Christ there's three more he gives and I may have missed one but I do believe there's three more Moses was a partial realization of a law giver right he brought the law down but Jesus was the perfect example of a lawgiver hallelujah Jesus's laws all the words he preached praise God and remember you know some people get hung up on this go to Acts chapter one some people get hung up on all there's no more Commandments now we're not under the law we're under grace and they get all confused because they don't study long enough they don't pray long enough that's the reason why there's false doctrine not waiting upon the Lord and not studying enough because he said you seek me with all your heart you will find me and Isaiah said call upon me while you're while I'm 9 Wow while you can while there's time to call upon the Lord and we all have time to call upon Jesus it's just just our choice what are we gonna do with our time are we gonna call on Jesus in our free time are we gonna call on the things of the world I say let's call on the holy name of Jesus it's our choice we're the one who makes that decision Acts chapter 1 verse 1 the former treatise have I made oath Theophilus of all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up now look at the next part this is the Prophet emphasized this in the message token in 1963 says this after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen so does the New Testament still give Commandments Church absolutely Jesus taught and and and taught the Word of God while he was on earth but after he left he said I'm gonna fill my Apostles with the Holy Ghost that's in me and now they're gonna give out Commandments to my people amen the trouble is today most people don't want to be commanded by the Word of God they think they can figure out salvation I'm sorry God has a government you must go through the government of the leadership that God has on the earth today it's through the commandments through the fivefold ministry which only preaches the Word of God and it perfects the people of God and brings them in line with the Holy Spirit today that's how the Holy Spirit speaking today through God's five gifts that he gave the preachers Amen that's right that's the only way he gave it today he still has Commandments today but the commandments are through his holy apostles and his ministry the government of the church amen that's what I was doing AB obviously with Benjamin this week and I showed him I show how there's two governments there's a government of the the natural government the United States government we have to honor and pray for them don't we yes we do we pray for him here we pray for Donald Trump here I don't grieve this lifestyle enough on that really don't agree with his lifestyle but or more most people in the government most the government don't live right because they're bought with money but then there's the spiritual government and the spiritual government is v preaching gifts to govern the body of Jesus Christ and it's through those five gifts that God will bring unity to the people unity to the faith don't you feel like that when we have brother cam or brother Brooks or brother Craig come in here by the Samuel when you preach our dedication meetings you know back in June don't you love that when the Holy Spirit comes in here and you have you here another gift of the fivefold ministry preaching the very thing that we preach does that make you feel good it shows that we're all being governed by this one Holy Spirit Laurie amen we're all one accord the Holy Spirit can have different men all around but the Holy Spirit's all bringing us to the same spot he's bringing us to be a church that's without spot without wrinkle and without blemish amen a church that's washed in the waters of Christ home where they men yes so Jesus is the lawgiver now look here's how he gives laws through his apostles there is fivefold ministry gives Commandments but like I said mostly what I don't want to be commanded do anything they just want to option well you can do this or not but the Bible said we're commanded to keep the Word of God they don't want commands they just want suggestions they want options well God's Word is his only option there's only one provide a place of worship and the church said there's only that's in Jesus Christ that's in the Holy Ghost the word of the hour now David was the partial realization of a king he was a mighty king subdued all the enemies he actually fulfilled you know Joshua's Commission on the borders that Israel would fulfill member we preached on that not long ago David fulfilled that some 700 800 years after Joshua took the promised land he finally reached the borders that that God had promised to Joshua but Jesus is the perfect realization of a king for he is king of kings and Lord of lords amen so it's partial verses a perfect realization and as we said again the partial realization for the Jews was they just had synagogues for the so they just had church membership but with the church they have more than church membership they have God membership glory God's inside of them amen God's walking in them God's talking to them God's living in them God is giving in them God is serving in them it's God in them it's Christ in them the hope of glory amen that's the perfect realization of what Jesus is doing today it's exactly right now let's get back to these Jews here because he said you can't understand verse seven without understanding verse nine but the Jews back there the time of Jesus did not want to accept that sacrifice a lot of people they won't accept the Holy Ghost baptism right they don't want to they don't want to ball and and cry and boohoo they don't want to lay at the altar - they're filled with power they don't want to be embarrassed I'd rather be embarrassed over here and then be embarrassed at the white throne judgment and really it's not an embarrassment to love the Lord it's a it's a joy to love the Lord it's a joy to have the Holy Ghost on you it's a joy to have your cup running over glory it's a joy and who cares what the world thinks they're lost I care what God thinks amen it's a joy to have your spirit overflowing with worship and praise and giving God glory it's a joy to have that we're so thankful for the Holy Ghost amen today hallelujah the blood of bulls and goats made nothing perfect it was once God's ordained method but now Christ having appeared in the flesh and by the shedding of his own blood has put away sin and by that offering of himself has made us perfect the Jews would not take that I will not take your preaching I will not believe that Jesus Christ makes me whole I know about you but I believe it with all my heart I will take that on every day seven days a week and twice on Sunday glory I'll take Jesus Christ every day to wash away my sins to make me perfect but what about the Philadelphian age and yes the other ages - did they really accept this reality in Christ no sir now remember the stars did the stars accepted it Wesley and Luther and Columba marked in and all these the stars were shining bright with the light of Christ amen and no doubt there were some believers but he's making reference to the majority of people in the age the majority of the people won't accept it right today the majority of the people won't be born-again the Holy Ghost but some people will praise God some people will be born again some people will have the life of Christ some people will know that for to me to live is Christ and to die it is my gain some people will know that today some people will know that I fought a good fight I've ran the course and there's a crown of righteousness that's waiting for me praise God I'm not guessing if there's a crowd I know there's a crown amen because I fought the good fight of the one faith of Christianity the Holy Ghost baptism amen that's right and Paul said I knew even though he blasts him long ago he knew who God forgave me and I've know God forgave me that blast that blaspheming and I know I've got a crown of righteousness waiting for me amen and not only me but all those hallelujah all those that love is appearing hallelujah thank you Jesus no sir they didn't really accept it even though Luther brought the truth of justification the Romish church and its eastern counterpart the orthodox church still clung to works now look at this paragraph I read this when I preached on justification a few months ago and I just put a little thing on Facebook about that that just totally refreshed me when I preached the just shall live by faith I felt so clean and fresh afterwards I think you're gonna feel that way to try to receive at church kunti let me let me let me persuade you try to receive this right now try to receive this now works are fine but they don't save you they don't make you perfect it is Christ or parish and it's not even Christ and works it is Christ alone this age began the years of our minyan ISM that does not believe in Christ as the reality it does not sing him nothing but the blood for sings nothing but the blood and my own conduct mercy now I believe in good conduct if you're saved you will do righteously see we got people baptize and say they're saved and they're not even living a right life which proves they're probably not even saved because if you're saved you will be virgin to the word your works will be pure before God because you have wise virgin and foolish virgin both are making no intercourse with the world the church said okay what church you go to no matter what church you go to if you say you're saved and not living righteously doing the right thing living the right way you're probably not save you're probably deceived in your experience with God the thing to do is repent lay at the altar open your Bible ask God to forgive you and hear the word of God amen don't follow the voice of strangers follow the voice of the word amen until your life is right you do everything right by the word that's the kind of person that's saved that's the kind of person who's righteous before God absolutely right no bad deals no speaking behind people's back no steal and no murder and no lusting after things but just somebody who lives a righteous life before God God's seeking those people look at that tonight that's who guys looking for God's going around the church I wonder is the people ro1 gonna seek me today are the people in row 2 gonna seek me today I'm seeking for a true worshiper where somebody that loves me but you know he'll always find him because he seeks and saves that reaches the house he knows all those that are called he goes down to the Row 3 Row 4 Row 5 he comes up to the pulpit amen he comes everywhere looking where is somebody that really wants to worship me in truth before we close we look at the definition of worship and I want to ask you then are you a worshipper today wonder when was last time have we looked at the word worship for a while are you a worshiper we're gonna find out if your worshiper and I'm gonna find out if I'm a worshiper to you by God's grace look at this we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus me it is Jesus alone salvation is of the Lord from start to finish it is all God let his leghe's let his life be him he starts naming all these spirit writers let his lie be in me let his blood be what cleanses me see it's all about him his life his blood let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me let it be Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of righteousness err Christ is my life amen what do you get excited about in your life right now that'll show you if you're right with God or not right because it's it's him if his words not in your life then you're really not living as you should praise God it has to be his word in your mouth praise God ask me his life in you you're his word has to be in your mouth to really speak and to really really talk we're really not talking left unless we're talking about the Word of God praise the Lord we do a lot of talking a lot of texting we dog there's a lot of face time and everything like that we do a lot of talking but we're really not talking if Jesus Christ loving him is at the center of our conversation it's true it's true it's not Jesus plus it is Jesus Jesus did all this for me it's all about Jesus and and Jesus said the Holy Ghost will speak of me amen it'll bring all things I've said to your remembrance amen glory now let me close to this yeah I got about give me a few minutes here now my closing is gonna member tell you how long my closing is gonna be here 25 minute closing ok so give me 25 minutes to close I'll set a timer here so I don't go over I got to save some strength for the evening praise the Lord I want to close with this thought because the Prophet said you can't understand verse 7 without understanding verse 9 now actually I'm already to this part okay I'm already at this part what is worship what is worship I'm said you can't worship in the church and pass notes and snicker and play around as he said he said actually helping people not worship God when you're distracting them in the congregation here's the Webster's definition and we'll look at the Greek definition now I'm gonna go down here first I kind of got him out of order sorry but worship is look at this extravagant respect now let's be honest be honest with yourself are you offering extravagant respect to God today not just respect but extravagant respect worship is extravagant respect or admiration for or devotion to an object of esteem admire that's why I said what do you admire right now if I could look on your phone and I could go through your history of what you looked at yesterday what were you admiring the latest Amazon deal it's good to get a deal but what do you admire what are you lavishing all the praise on what what are you so excited and and so emotional about that people know that person really likes the book guys who that person really likes the Detroit Lions what do people notice about you they say oh they they have extravagant respect for this that's worship and then the second definition closely related reverence offered a divine being or supernatural power now another one calls it the the Greek called it homage program called it home egde I shared with my wife one time he called it home it is definite I love how he pronounces words homage an expression of high regard or respectful what is respect its esteem so highly valuing something I think our lives chuh Church I think our lives show what we value I think our decisions we make every day really shows what we value do you believe that respect is giving something a high value all youth at work that got a boss how many you respect your boss do you value his opinion or her do you value their opinion is it valuable when you get the email from your boss or email from mom or whoever you value most yeah does it does it mean I mean you get on that email right away or you brush it off and sass some other time I don't value that this is worship respect we're talking about worshiping Jesus Christ those that worship Jesus Christ of the Philadelphia church age those that receive the key of David glory amen those that went through the open door that Jesus opened for them and did not deny the name of Jesus Christ they would stand with Jesus Christ and the ones who lied about it would come and worship before their feet it's quite a thought isn't it now here look what look what the Greek is for worship now this is the the worship is 70 times in the in the New Testament and I think 60 of them have this definition some of them are just broad worship you know just all the acts of worship but here's what worship actually means now it's Prosecco new Oh prosecute Anejo or somebody prosecute nay o cross proskuneo are you frost kunia and it gets its meaning from two words it means to kiss like a dog licking his master's hand oh my got a dog at home a couple okay two or three how many people have dogs huh yeah just a couple that's all right I don't like how they shed so much and I don't like how they stink so we don't have a dog at our house now if you got a dog that doesn't shed her stink now you're you're in business right there but that's just my opinion [Music] but the actual word worshipping God and this is the one where the Bible said that four and twenty elders fell down and worship before God this is the actual this is the one that's used the most the actual worshiper of Jesus Christ is one who's like a dog before its master they're like a dog before its master let's just let that sink in for a little bit recently I've gone to people's houses I forget who it was and the dogs really liked me can you imagine that dogs like me but I forget where it was but as soon as I got there they come running up I'm trying to think who was there wagging their tail they just and they lay down on their side and like come on rub me down yeah I spend some time with me I can't remember who it was but some dogs really fell in love with me recently I can't remember where it was but that's the kind of action that Jesus wants you and I to show not tongue wagging now you might speak in tongues I like that you might speak with tongues hallelujah but this is the worship I want to what you'd examine yourself we have communion next week are you worshippers are you worshipper do you give extravagant worship do you give extravagant adoration to Christ that's between you and God I don't know some of your faces tell a certain story all of our faces tell story but we want it to be in sincerity and truth I just want to spend a little bit of time on that I still got about 23 minutes it means to kiss the hand towards one in token of reverence you've all seen the pictures how they kiss the Pope's had raised your have you seen a picture of them kissing the Pope's in I've seen that they just run up and kiss his hand they do that to the the kings and princes in England or not they that to the King of England I don't know I haven't seen any pictures like that that's the closest that's the closest you and I could get to understanding that the Pope they kissed his hand which we believe the Pope is wrong you know we respect him but we believe he's totally wrong in his doctrine we shouldn't pray to Mary we shouldn't pray to dead people right we shouldn't do those things and we know his church is the mother harlot in revelation 17 because Rome sits on seven hills we know that but see this is what worship is it's to kiss the hand in token of reverence now those you who aren't married you can't understand this yet but after I got married with my wife I kiss her hand right or anyone that's married you kiss your loved one let me know what we're talking about by God's grace that's an act that's one way to understand where this word comes from worship means to kiss it means to touch and I wonder are we touching the heart of God this morning with our worship because we should if we're not we're not worshiping in spirit and truth we've actually gone into vain worship which we'll look at tonight in the Bible study because he said you can he said oh this is the fate of the powerful scripture from Matthew 15 in vain do they worship me they honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me what is your heart really giving extravagant praise to people come to church they sing god bless america you know they they sing hallelujah you know all hail King Jesus but is there heart in it because worship involves more than just words or else the Pharisees had worship down to the tee Christ has to be our number one object of adoration I adore Jesus Christ more than I adore lust finances right jobs families relatives Christ has to be our number one adoration and it's liking that how you would kiss your spouse or how you'd kiss maybe the baby when the firstborn I'm gonna pretty good at that by the way by God's grace hence among the Orientals especially the Persians they showed worship by falling down on their knees and touching the ground with their forehead which the Muslims still do today as an expression of profound reverence in the New Testament by kneeling or prostrating to do homage or make obeisance whether in order to express respect or to make supplication are we worshiping today are you did you worship during the worship service did you worship and adore did you give extravagant praise to Christ did you highly value the songs that we sing or is it like how could brother Jesse and Malachi play that song again that's the only ones we know right now we'll keep practicing right now okay Malik I had a dream years ago and he said he went from the congregation to the piano to the pulpit now I don't know about you but I just believe that some I believe that's the prophesy myself and so we're seeing I'm seeing it fulfilled right now this was when he's 3-4 years old he drew a picture of him brought it to me and so I'm seeing him move from the congregation to the piano just makes my heart happy because God said I'll speak to the men and women through dreams and visions the young men in dreams praise God so this is worship now there's a couple other definitions of worship homage shown disappear men these are ones were common familiar with homage rendered to God and to the Ascended Christ and heavenly beings two demons are we worshiping you know Jesus is patient but if we won't worship him at some point he starts to get angry with us let's go to the Book of Psalms you got your Bible it's got a book of Psalms Psalms chapter 2 verse 11 God will be merciful merciful merciful for years sometimes decades but at some point if we don't give over to him he gets angry that we won't give him extravagant praise you know why because he's got to the universe he gave you your life your breath your being he provides all the food shelter clothing he provides he sends rain upon the just and the unjust and he's worthy of your praise now in that but all the natural things he took away all the spiritual wrath against you on the cross by the blood of Jesus Christ and if we won't give him extravagant praise then he gets upset Psalms 2:11 serve the Lord with fear with respect see that respect there it is and rejoice with trembling kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when r at his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him Jesus tired of people some people given praise to sporting events he gets tired of that he gets tired of people praising their children more than praising God or praising money or how much money or their occupation or whatever they get tired of you got he gets tired of people just praising that and and giving all their extravagant emotion and energy that rather than worshiping him he gets tired and he said kiss the son see show that kiss shown that tender touch that extravagant worship show him that lest he be angry how many glad you can kiss the son today hey man I'm glad hallelujah glory but see some people don't come to church like that oh I could never do that like but that's what worship is follow them around long enough I would just imagine for one hour you can follow them around for one hour and you're gonna find them giving some worship to something and they're just choosing not to give it to Jesus Christ most people's as soon as they get out and get on their phones you start seeing seen what they want to extravagantly worship how many understand that there was what their it's what they're giving all their love to all their praise all their attention extravagant praise that's their God that's their idol but the Bible said kiss the son kiss Jesus touching Jesus is all that really matters it and your life will never be the same amen it's exactly right well Bram said we come to church to express our love to Jesus Christ let me out maybe I can share this the right way there's something about coming to church and worshiping God there's something that's so important about that and how you act right here don't get me wrong what you really are is what you are at home are you showing extravagant worship at home that's really what what it boils down to that's real worship because people can pretend here well there's something about when we are gathered together there should be so much worship and praise there should be such a unity when we're gathered together that people who visit our visitors this morning should know they love Jesus Christ they're extravagantly worshiping Jesus Christ this is our time to come together and foreshadow what we're going to be doing for all eternity and if you don't like putting extravagant praise on Jesus here you're probably not gonna like heaven and you're gonna have a very small chance to even get into heaven are you with me you don't like worshipping here with God's people that will you live with eternity something wrong with your worship it's vain worship God is looking for someone to show him true extravagant love extravagant worship Oh My glory kiss him lest he be angry because he's done everything for you he deserves the honor he deserves the praise he washed away your sins with his blood and all the Knick WA T's of us all were placed upon Christ and with His stripes I am healed amen glory my life is healed my destiny is healed amen hallelujah my eternal is settled because I'm healed through the stripes of Jesus Christ amen so I'll kiss him today amen I'll kiss him every day we'll kiss the Sun and we'll make him happy praise God amen we come here to do that and so we're coming here and and that's why we get worried if people are you know not enjoying the worship or they don't look like they're expressing extravagant praise that's why preachers have to preach on that now you're coming here saying you're worshiping but not expressing extravagant praise upon him something's wrong with that something's wrong with that or coming to church and worshipping isn't as important as other things it's not as valuable as other things that people placed before the house of God it's not as valuable it's not as steamed as highly the values been placed on well I ask you again what are you worshiping are you worshiping we must worship in spirit and in truth hallelujah because God is actively he's wants somebody to love him but amen he wants somebody to love him he wants somebody to kiss him this morning somebody to kiss him and say I love you Jesus you're you're you're beautiful you're you're wonderful you're marvelous oh just like pour all my praises upon you amen that's what he's looking looking for somebody to worship him like a dog licks his master's hand now we are not to be worships as we closed out of the service I got I got 12 more minutes we're not we're not the ones being worship in this scripture Jesus says I'm gonna have all those synagogues of Satan that were lying and said they were true churches come stand before you and make them worship at your feet but you and I are not the ones being worshiped are we sharing in the glory yes but are we being worshipped absolutely not because the Bible says I am the Lord this is my name and my glory will I not give to another neither my praise to graven images now don't some of the word glory because look down and we'll get to this one right here first first cut this one 29 that no flesh should glory in his presence that so if I'm standing by Jesus I won't be saying oh praise me praise me it would be like I'm standing with him praise him praise Him praise Him praise Him praise him or in this case praise him praise Him praise him because look at John 17 there is a portion of glory that we share and that portion of glory is the Holy Ghost because he said in the glory which thou gavest me I have given them see we receive glory we received a part of God amen that they may be one even as we are one I am them thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou sent me has loved them as thou hast loved me amen glory remember this is the mystery which was hid from all ages Christ in you the hope of glory amen those lying churches and say oh we're Jews or we're the true believers or we're the true message believers when they are brought before the true believer they bow down and worship but they have to worship Christ they're not worshiping us they're worshiping Christ there are five Bible examples I found a worshiping before thy feet so I'm gonna finish with this I thought that was so striking the first example is Joseph's brethren I remember that story Joseph had a dream as a young boy I saw I saw 12 stars bowing down and worshiping me now the reason Joseph could be worship was cuz he was a type of Christ right but it wasn't like God worship it was just reverence and obeisance but he said I saw twelve stars falling down and worshiping me and so we know what happened he got sodas brothers didn't like his spiritual gifts so they sold him out to to Egypt he went to Egypt got exalted when the prison of falsely accused but God was with him amen and God raised him up and Joseph of the Old Testament is a type of Jesus cry the new I challenge yesterday somebody on that that said Joseph of the Old Testament is the type of Joseph Branham which I give all respect to him and the voice of God but they never got back with me I challenge him on that they never got back this I'm waiting to hear back from them about that because Joseph or the Old Testament was a type of Jesus Christ praise the Lord he's a type of Jesus Christ because he was sold for nearly thirty pieces of silver right twenty I'm sorry he was twenty pieces yeah twenty pieces of silver and he was exalted to the right hand and every knee and every tongue had every knee had to bow every tongue you had to confess that Joseph was in the town a man Joseph was there so here you have the enemies once of Joseph forced to come and they just they're not even realized what they're doing they're just falling into the plan of God amen Joseph was the one who kept the word Joseph was the one that worship God amen Joseph was the one that did not deny the name of God amen and they were the lying brothers they're the ones that lied and said we're right with God we know what happened to Joseph and all these and they lied about it and so God made the liars come bow at the feet of those who live true to God amen it's exactly right all prefiguring the white throne judgment which we close with in just a moment did you know in second Kings to those sons of prophets were watching he lied you and he was going to go and they kept saying he lied your masters gonna leave today he said hold your peace close your mouth I know he's gonna leave today but I'm watching him I'm gonna make sure I got that double anointing he said you may your masters gonna leave today see that they're just egging him on they're just trying to discourage him they were just trying to upset that next prophet in line amen but then when Elijah went up Elijah was right there he caught the anointing he caught the mantle and he said where is the god of Elijah and he started using the mantle like a lie to use the mantle that's what we're supposed to be we're supposed to catch the anointing that was on brother Branham which was the Holy Ghost and we're supposed to say where is the God of William Branham and used the word like he used it amen it's in the name of Jesus Christ Satan you must move back in the name of Jesus Christ were supposed to be the ones with a double anointing amen that's exactly right using the mantle of the power of the word of God hallelujah and I'm glad I've seen it move back kidney stones I've seen that lorry I've seen it move back migraines amen I've seen that move back nerve trouble and back surgery I've seen the mantle of Elijah moved back all these things why because it's got to move back because he's the same God yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah aren't you glad for the mantle of Jesus Christ glory but after that when Elijah did that he smote the waters the Bible said all those sons of the prophets came and bowed themselves before heel I sure searched the scriptures they're the ones egging them on and trying to make it they thought they were the true church but God always shows who the true church is the liars the ones that are a little mischievous they'll come in worship at the feet of the true believer that's exactly right you know the story of Jesus and the demons of the maniac of Gadara they came running to Jeter the maniac came running to Jesus remember and felt on his feet and said have mercy on us before our time and they told Jesus don't send me here and Jesus just said one word go right go and the man fell down like he was dead he said oh let me follow you as an apostle and Jesus said no stay here be a light in gaturro let the light of shining gaturro you stay here and you start a church you stay here let the light of Christ tell everybody how you got delivered to everybody how will the liars and demons had to fall down at the feet of Jesus a man let the light of Christ shine in your town amen it's exactly right be the example amen be the light shine be the worshiper in your town be the one who gives extravagant praise to Jesus there's too much praise for everything else today everything else gets praise except Jesus and so it shows it's not true worship it's not true worship people start checking their watch how long is this guy gonna preach today don't you understand I'm giving an extravagant praise to Jesus I feel Jesus wants me to keep going so he can get more praise amen so somebody can get more of the word and get a revelation because we cannot overemphasize the importance of spiritual revelation to the believer and the place where you receive spiritual revelation is in the house of God because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God amen it's exactly right that's why church that's why if we sit and then sermons don't do anything for us it's our fault because we're not praying for revelation of the word if we're praying for revelation more than anything else God will give it to us because the Bible says ask God for wisdom he'll not deny you he'll give it to you you just must have faith and nothing doubting Amen that's why the service itself is so telling about your spiritual condition are you worshiping or you're not receiving any spiritual revelation that's your fault because jesus said I need to be kissed I need to be worshipped I need to be adored I need to be exalted and people are bringing a false worship they're bringing a cane offering rather than bringing the true offering of Abell praise God and the church said that's exactly right that's nothing but the truth remember to Wednesdays go ahead to the service by sharing all the inspiration all the revelations got to give me from the church age series so far I live on those I live on those those revelations give me strength to keep up fulfilling the Word of God for my life they keep unlocking the mysteries of the secret to my life and my ministry of my family the Word of God keeps on unfolding and unfolding it's the mystery of his will for our lives that's exactly right now the last two I got quotes for I have quotes for the other ones but didn't have time to put them on here so last two i got quotes for look what he says this is in the 1960 sermon december 10th that i got three minutes glory yeah alright so here's the scripture now he quotes it so these are the exams act worse down here except he takes out Jews and mother Ram types these Jews which they they are Phil so brother Graham brings it to the New Testament so there's synagogues of liars that say their spirit fill but or not oh the church we ought to search our lives and make sure we're spear filled because we don't want to be someone lying saying I've got the Holy Ghost when we really don't got it and if you got it you're gonna worship because that's your whole life my life is a sacrifice of worship cetera so the Prophet said see they which say that they say their spirit fill but they're not spirit filled now look at the example he gives he gives the foolish virgin as an example of coming to worship before the feet of the wise virgin isn't that striking I never thought of that in a hundred years until I listened to the sermon last couple weeks ago he said don't you remember the sleeping virgin when she raised up now remember what was she called there's 10 of them that went out to meet the bridegroom is that right 5 was wise had oil in their lamp how many knows what oil signifies in the Bible spirit that's in Zechariah 4 now one couldn't say you're not sanctified and I'm not they was all sanctified a foolish virgin is someone who's sanctified by the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit has not baptized them into the body yet they just have a clean heart and mind like John Wesley appreciate have a clean heart in mind he says now no one couldn't say you're not saying to fie there was all sanctified all sanctified but 5 was wise enough to have the wisdom of Revelation Oh hallelujah the wisdom of Revelation got a revealed faith God had revealed the meaning of the Bible to them how many men to catch that door see the open door to be filled with the spirit they had oil in their lamps and the others had no oil and when they were awakened why here they come up to them and said oh give me some of your Holy Spirit give me some and said yeah sorry sister just got enough for myself I ain't got any to spare and I feel the same way today I don't have any Holy Ghost to share I need all the Holy Ghost I got to keep me going next week and the week after and next month and next year all the holy ghost I can't share any with you I know I got it from Jesus I'm kissing the son and you and I must all have our own Holy Ghost we must all be packing God's life within us and our lamps must be trimmed and burning and we must worship God in spirit and in truth amen you'd like to give it to somebody else but you can't I preached for them to get it but it's up to them all right I preached everywhere I go and want people to be filled with this and if you're fill it that you're a true worshiper amen people can see you extravagantly praise Christ oh yeah you're not holding back like you're not stingy well the man said you want to revival he said you cannot be stingy with your worship so the opposite of stingy is extravagant or generous we all know what stingy with money is I ain't giving you a penny more you better give that boundary funding all that back now I'm the fool that will just pay it you know okay whatever you can have my money I don't care but with your praise we have to be generous with our praise to Christ now did you come in here and were you generous during the song service how about one brother a mentor brother Jose was singing special were you generous in your worship were you singing along where you just tried now I'm not saying if you got children crawling all over you I know what that's like you know and they're they're putting their fingers in your ear and mesons play with my hair and worship you know I'm trying to trying to give extravagant praise I'm talking about when we can do it are we doing it as our heart did we come here to worship or we just come in here with MAO service oh I honor God with my lips all I'll say hallelujah praise the Lord but is it real worship I know I'm challenging the I'm jonesing myself I'm an I know I was gonna preach this today so I was praying in my closet with extravagant worship this morning I don't have any Holy Ghost to spare I'm sorry I wish I could give you some of my Holy Ghost by can't spare any because it's sealed inside of me it's sealed and I can't go unsealed I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption amen and so while he they said go and prep the wise said go and pray up and while they were going to get some the bridegroom came and they went into the wedding supper and they was left without where they'll go through the tribulation period watch this in a little couple more minutes see it'll go right into the Tribulation Period because they weren't true worshipers they had truth sanctification but then have the baptism the Holy Ghost that makes you a true worshiper spirit and truth now here's the - cause then I got two more quotes it yeah you know you know I'm almost done here and my time or did go off so I mean yeah I just need a couple more minutes here sorry let's stand though let's tan we'll get you standing they'll make me close sooner oh I want to be a true worshipper today I want to be a overcomer I don't wanna be a liar I don't wanna lie and say well I'm a synagogue of the Jews or in other words I'm a Holy Ghost filled Christian I don't want to say that and not really be one I want to be one well good way to check is with communion I'll examine myself you examine yourselves whether we be in the faith are we worshiping like we ought to is Christ valued number one above everything else that's what respect is value highly valuing Christ above everything else I'll make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee my first Corinthians 62 do you not know that the Saints should judge the world so now we know where is this gonna happen where's where is this gonna happen when the the liars come and stand before and worship at the feet of the Saints is gonna happen at the white throne judgment which we just preached on about three weeks ago not only will there be 12 apostles on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel but the Saints also will judge the world that is when these who claim to belong to God and claim that God loves them we'll find out exactly who's a child of God and who is loved of the son yes that day is coming when it will be made manifest these who are now ruling the world in a measure and who during the last age will build an image to the Beast whereby they will actually rule the world will one day be humble when Jesus comes with his Saints to judge the world in righteousness that is exactly what we saw Matthew 25 all the ones who missed the first resurrection will stand before the judge in the bride last quote here now you recall that the beginning of verse 7 I said that verse 9 would help us to understand it everybody remember that I hope you saw that I meant what I meant Jesus sent him forth forth himself as he that is holy true and the only reality the one with the key of David I hope you can say amen to that it's Christ the only reality in your life what's real to you where are you most sincere at I hope it's right here and in your home praying before God Christ has to be a reality where he is exalted above everything else he has to be a living reality oh how my heart desires that for all of us that's exactly true those phrases describe him perfectly but the Jews and his day refused him and all that he was they rejected their Savior and all he meant to them the nominal Christian has now done the same they have done what the Jews did exactly the Jews crucified him and then turned him turned on the true believer the nominal Christian has crucified him afresh and turned on the true Church to destroy it but God is true and he who is above all will yet return and when he does he will show who the only potentate is and as he proves himself to the world and all the world bows at his feet at that time all the world will bow at the feet of the Saints proving that they were right in their stand with him blessed be God for evermore hallelujah you love the Lord tonight or today parmie it's almost tonight well actually is afternoon I hope you can understand by God's grace every understand let's just bow our heads for word a prayer here of course we're going to sing in a few moments - it's a chance to really worship to show God how valuable he is to you is it really the most valuable thing in your life is he really getting all your extravagant praise you praise things more than Christ what do we love the most how many but raise your hand say for the Jessie please pray for me I feel like I haven't been given him extravagant praise I feel like I haven't been worshiping him with where you saw the hands I'm trusting everyone is sincere more or does I prepare this message Norden as I would say you prepare this idea of the worship and to me I start studying it through the scripture Moorcock Lord I've truly felt refreshed to know what worship means to come to the master offer generous grace oh Jesus you're so Jesus ministered to my needs let me touch you Jesus let me worship you let me kiss you to this can I kiss you Jesus God help us the Lord God to see and examine our

extravagant phrase and I get your praise more this world temp sister praise and adore so many things but we know through your power we can cast all of our cares upon you because you care for us we don't want to be found saying well I honored the message under the Holy Spirit with my lips but my heart was not really in the worship we were not hearts to be behind it as well then we can have a covenant Lord that it was like Stevens it's like an angel how hoods on his face everybody saw this man [Music] Satan someone who says their spirit builder says them at your church but are lying we

futures and their finances anything that would come against their current system they clashed with the Lord we love you so much today we want your word to come against anything wrong in our lives and
