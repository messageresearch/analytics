[Music] mag the name God praise God take your bibles if you have them tonight let's go to First Peter chapter 4 by the grace of the Lord like to take a little different thought last few Services you know we've had some guest Ministry and it's really inspired me a little bit to uh Go a different direction we've been you know doing the Ephesians series and so forth but I really want to look at this thought let's go to Ephesian I'm sorry First Peter chapter 4 I think I'll start this little Series tonight I got about 30 I got about 45 minutes now to preach on this and we'll try to finish it Sunday morning Sunday night like I said we like to do a Comm communion service on Sunday night with feet washing and we're willing to do that and I really felt GL to do that since we have the new new Believers being baptized tonight I want to give them a chance to partake in communion by God's grace communion was also preached by Brother Jim last Sunday so I thought I just felt a burden felt like I need to call communion by God's grace yeah so First Peter chapter 4 brother amen if you're not here then remind me we'll have to set up a a communion shortly after so you can take communion I forgot about that you'll be out you're probably working this Sunday right yes okay yeah remind me on that wey surely want you to be a part of that by God's grace 1 Peter chapter 4 like to start at verse 12 1 Peter 4:12 I've had a title tonight like I said I like to take a little different thought I kind of want to deal with salvation a little bit uh I'd like to deal with this title called scarcely saved scarcely lost I got to kind of deal with that little thought right out of here on the scripture first Peter 4 verse 12 there say amen amen beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you ever think it's strange When Trials Come Peter said don't think it's strange right as though some strange thing happened unto you but Rejoice wow so when you go through a fire trial rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy now look at this in verse 14 if you bear the reproach of Christ if ye be reproach for the name of Christ happy are ye so if you suffer persecution for the name of Christ you should be happy for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you that's why you're being persecuted because the glory of God is resting upon you if it wasn't it wouldn't persecute you on their part he's evil spoken of so they speak evil of God or the word that you believe but on your part he's glorified amen but let none of you suffer as a murderer so this is when you sin that's not suffering for being a Christian so let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief if you steal something and get persecuted that's not God's that doesn't have nothing to do with God God didn't anoint you to do that or as an evildoer or as a busy body in other men's matters so gossiping Goss is you don't get if you get persecuted for gossiping that's you deserve that right verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian amen let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf I got to suffer because I'm a Christian praise God I glorify God for that now verse 17 so Peter is speaking about Christian persecution right and now he gets into judgment Jud Judgment Day for the time has come that judgment must begin where at the house of God if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel so judgment starts here what's going to happen what's G to be the end of those people that aren't here Verse 18 here's where I got my title and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God so if you're suffering and you're in God's will commit the keeping of your of their souls to him in wello as unto a faithful Creator let's bow our heads in a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God scarcely save scarcely lost let's look at this thought here Heavenly Father Lord we have needs Upon Our Hearts speak to us here tonight Lord we're having we're planning on a shorter service help me Lord God to find the thoughts and just lead me and guide me if my notes don't match the needs of the people as you led me to these thoughts I pray just guide me away from them that your people might be blessed and received from you tonight for you are the same yesterday today and forever strengthen us feed us help us correct us Lord God and raise us up if we're downtrod and raise us up heal us if we're sick oh God we need you tonight Lord minister to your children we love you so much with all of our hearts in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen God bless you you're being seated there praise God so we want to take this thought scarcely saved scarcely lost as the title says I'm dealing with um I'm dealing with those that are right near the borderline of being saved and being lost some will be scarcely saved some will be scarcely lost okay so I want to just look at that thought here Mal I do have a little slideshow buddy so if you can get that remote I'd appreciate that I'd like to look at this little thought here tonight by the grace of the Lord and I know it would be a blessing to you and going to bring it all the way down you know this is a trying time thank you sir and we got to be ready okay it's on all right uh you know a lot I just want to say a few things you know A lot's happened in the nation this past week and you you notice a lot of racial things uh but I want you to know a lot of that is just being done for Ratings uh for television ratings uh for example I was talking to a police officer yesterday and I said you know it's a shame all this things and and he said you know he said a lot of that is done we've seen that happen for years he said a lot of that is done is just for Ratings the media will catch one bad example of maybe a cop being un unjustice or something like that and if and if that cop was unjust then they should receive Justice right uh but most cops how many hundreds of thousands of cops around the nation are good cops and they save people they help people right they try to bring people you know help and so forth like that uh so one thing we don't want to get is our evil spirit on us a root of bitterness uh and remember that God loves all people no matter your skin color praise the Lord uh you know uh I used to be a tease a lot you know because my skin was always darker than everybody's in school you know when they call me they they called me they said I was a black boy when I was in school I got so dark I don't get I kind of get dark now but I was so dark when I was younger some people thought I was black because I just spent all summer out in the sun I get really really dark and they used to call me evil names and make me cry it would you know I go home to my Daddy and tell my dad you know he's white as all white can be you know I tell my dad so he used to call me you're my only black son Jesse that's what he used to tell me and it made me feel good that he was proud of me even though my skin was a lot darker than everybody else you know I got pictures I was really dark as a child really dark uh but you know there's always been so I've experienced a little bit of that and and when I was I'm Mexican or Spanish or Indian whatever I don't I'm gonna find out pretty soon here they would call me evil names for Mexicans you know they call me all those evil names I had to deal with that and so I've dealt with racism just a little bit I just want to say you know just keep your heart positive and love everybody pray for those if they done wrong pray for Mercy you pray the Justice be done but pray that God will change their hearts and they'll repent of the evil they've done if they've shot and killed somebody or they've done some evil God can change a murderer's heart look at Saul look at Moses he was a murderer and God got a hold of his heart right but the fact is Media pumps it up and they put it on Facebook and Twitter and they got all this tension on it so it creates better ratings for them that's what they're trying to do if you if you look at the whole skate of the United States is there uh officers in every town in every state doing these kind of evil things that maybe one or two did no they're blowing it up to try to get people have ratings and and Satan loves to do that doesn't he but the Holy Ghost loves to bring Divine love praise the Lord just keep that in your hearts and mind yes there some there's an evil cop there's bad cops out there guess what there's bad preachers out there there's bad mothers out there that do evil things there's bad teachers I'm in the teacher profession there's bad doctors out there isn't there pray for them pray for them but not all are like that and we don't want to get caught up in an evil spirit I just I didn't a chance to say that Sunday I just I could have said more but I just never stopped right there I want to do a little bit teaching there but if you have any questions about that you know just pray and maybe call me or email me or something like that but the thing to do in this hour is have Divine love the Bible said it's going to be like the days of Noah Jesus said that in Matthew 24 and Luke 17 as it was in the days of Noah and lot so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man what was Noah's day all violence it was sons of God that looked at sexy dressed women they saw the daughters of men and marry them based upon their looks rather than their Godly character right it was full of violence and lots day was homosexuality right so look at the combination that's what we should expect yeah that's that's that's what the nation's never going to repent but the bride will amen she'll get her life right she'll get filled with the Holy Ghost she'll be serving Jesus all right now let's look at this scarcely saved scarcely lost now I just want to uh go back over the scripture let's go to so let's go back to 1 Peter 4 I want to start at verse 16 yet if any man suffers a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf so if you suffer if you're a Christian and you get persecuted just for being a Christian you should glorify God for that I think a brother amen you know he's taking the stand as a chrisan as a message believer and he's taken persecution from his family for that some of you also have done that right and that's suffering just for being a Christian you haven't done nothing wrong you just decided to take the way with the Lord's despise few and you suffer because that you should glorify God because of that amen verse 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what should be the end of them that obey not the gospel so notice the US in this scripture is those who are in the house of God and not just in the house of God but obeying God because the phes and Sadducees and aans they were all in a house of God they thought they they claimed to be in the house of God did they not but that's not where the real judgment was going forth they were reading Moses's law but God had moved on past Moses and moved into the New Testament praise God so we're talking about us of that day Paul was Peter's Church the message of the hour praise God that's what we have today we have Pentecostals but they're living off the message of another hour lutherans are two hours or three hours behind that right Wesley and uh they're two hours behind that and so that's not the message of the hour the US is the message of the hour who God is working with right now and that's us amen so judgment begins with us right uh and if if if if the righteous be scarcely saved amongst us what about those that don't obey the gospel so the fact that you're here tonight proves you want to obey the gospel amen that ought to make you happy and rejoice amen now Verse 18 here's why I want to start getting down to a little bit of teaching on the three kinds of Believers in four classes maybe you never heard that before but brother Ram taught that okay so let's look at this verse 18 and if the righteous scarcely be saved now scarcely means hardly if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear now notice he he names three there righteous ungodly sinner but if you take the US in verse 17 now you got four groups and that's exactly what Jesus said there are four kinds of Hearts every person on the entire Earth Falls within one of the four kinds of hearts and the seed of the word is planted on all four Hearts praise God and each each heart produces a different crop if any right amen so if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear so my title is scarcely saved scarcely right or scarcely lost so I'm dealing right with that line between being saved and being lost we're dealing with that line there and so today's service and then Sunday morning we're going to deal with that and just show uh the characteristics of these people uh that are scarcely saved and then scarcely lost and it'll help you by God's grace I know it will by God's grace so uh scarcity also means very rarely so if the rightous very rarely be saved where should the ungodly and sinner appear amen all right that's quite a sobering thought right pretty sobering hard the righteous are hardly saved or they're with difficulty so it's not it's not easily as well that's one of the Greek words okay so verse 19 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful Creator so listen if you're suffering for a good cause you got to commit your soul to God and just do the right thing amen do well well doing right even when you're being treated evil you must treat others well that's what he's saying here commit your soul to God if they're going to mistreat me if they're going to separate from me and I have no more friends or if I have no more money because I'm cut off or whatever more whatever persecution comes upon you just do good just do what God's word said do commit your soul to God and God will take care of the rest amen that's what he's saying here now let's look at this here uh let's review this if you haven't read the church age book or maybe you haven't listened to three kinds of Believers brother Bram said there are two kind of Destinies there are the Saved and the lost Glory now those that are saved they get a new garment the Garment uh the people that get the Holy Ghost get got the Garment on right now amen because Jesus said you'll be endued with power from on high and endued means clothed with power from on high so that's in the soul so in the in the soul a Christian if you could look past the the the Flesh and the spirit down to the soul and look at their look at their soul the Soul's actually clothed with a white garment we'd say they are a saint they're walking in white amen so some people get saved now on earth right they get the white garment now but some will get the white garment at the white Throne judgment the other Destiny is lost where you burn in the Lake of Fire uh with fire and brimstone right and you'll burn burn burn and at some point you'll cease to exist total Annihilation amen not eternal life not burning eternally either but Annihilation at some point it will cease to exist all right now Within These two Destinies you have four classes you have two on each side okay so I tried to find pictures that might help you this is a picture of the Bride going in the Rapture uh the elect is the the highest quality of a Believer they're the wise version they're called holy and they can be jew or Gentile and they got the oil which is the Holy Ghost amen that's the highest quality of a Christian brother man says is a genuine Holy Ghost still believer for your day an hour you cannot get the Holy Ghost in a Baptist church today because they don't preach the whole word of God Amen right because you have some good Baptists uh in Acts chapter 19 that were baptized with Apollos but they couldn't get born again until Paul came with the Revelation on the baptism of the Holy Ghost they laid hands and they received the Holy Ghost amen Glory the next type of Saved is called the foolish virgin these are the Righteous they're not holy they're righteous but the holy ones are the ones who have the Holy Ghost Gentiles and Jews that were Souls under the altar so a a lot of people are going to be foolish virgin they'll be saved uh but they're going to be scarcely saved these are the scarcely saved right here they why are they scarcely saved because they get saved right at the white Throne judgment amen they don't have eternal life before that they're giv eternal life at the white Throne judgment now the the the first group of the Lost are the make believer these are the filthy that's a picture of Judas he's leaving he's gonna be go betray the Lord and he's gon to sell out the Lord for 30 pieces of silver and this can be a Jew or Gentile or a worker of iniquity Jesus said depart from me workers of iniquity I never knew you yet you did miracles in my name right and Judas did miracles in the name of Jesus he was sent out two by two with the apostles and they come back rejoicing saying the devils are subject un us and Jesus said don't rejoice in your signs Miracles and wonders Rejoice that your name is written in heaven amen that right that's what Jesus said to Rejoice get excited about your name being written in heaven tonight amen glory and then you have the unbeliever like Pharaoh that's a picture of pharaoh from the movie about Moses right that's Pharaoh unbeliever the Bible calls them unjust and that can be jew or Gentile it can be anybody now does that help a little bit does that help okay now a few month or last fall I preached on Saul and David and I showed how uh Saul was a type of the foolish virgin and David was the type of the wise virgin now I'm not going to go through these quotes because I already went through them if you want them I can email them to you now there's two Destinies we said they're saved and lost now the saved are the vessels of Mercy the wheat are the saved the Sheep are the saved the children of God are the Saved and the good seed are the Saved these are all representing the saved amen but you have the lost the Lost are vessels of Wrath they're tears they're goats Children Of Satan and Bad Seed oh my I'm glad I'm none of those amen amen I'm glad thank God for his mercy so but brother Brandon preaches this message and he says in 1963 he says I've always preached there's three kinds of Believers and that's true so you have this you have three kinds of Believers you have a Believer who's saved but then you have in the lost you have a make believer like Judas and an unbeliever in the lost right you have three kinds of Believers okay brother BR teaches that here and uh it's on November 24th in the evening service I'm not going to read through that we've already read through that but the church age book brother says there's another class of believer so God gives them a greater Revelation see the word just keeps opening to us amen it keeps opening as you read more remember there's many sermons where brother said I can only hit the highlights he said you need to go back and dig and find more nuggets and things like that he said he Lov finding nuggets in the scripture well he teaches in the church age book we have another type of believer so we have three kinds of Believers right three kinds of Believers but there's two kinds of Believers there's a wise virgin or there's a foolish virgin amen they're both Believers but one only goes so far with God the other goes all the way let's go all the way with Jesus can we tonight let's go all the way with Christ amen let's not stop and say this is far as I'm going I'm not surrendering anything else I don't want any more of God we need more of God Amen that's why we come here I need more of the Lord I need growing grace I need more of him I never get enough of him that's should be our attitude tonight amen glory so we do this fits we have three kinds of Believers in four classes we have that he teaches that on page 279 of the church age book uh here's where he says it literally and it's really small I'm sorry I I didn't mean for you guys to see this he said secondly there's another class their names in The Book of Life and they come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish virgin and the righteous okay so now let's go back to our picture here so now we have this picture we have saved or lost we have three kinds of Believers and then we have four classes within those kinds of Believers and church this is something that can only be brought out by a prophet amen you'll find other people preaching this except brother Bram amen I never heard anywhere else brother BR said there was four crosses how many knew that death when Jesus died there was actually Four crosses three on golgatha and Judas now there's the quote I don't time to read it it's from the faith once delivered to the Saints in 1953 so now you have four crosses which represents four types of classes of people you have Jesus representing the wise virgin right the most highest quality believer you have the sav Thief he was scarcely saved he was hardly saved I mean he got saved at the very last moments of his life praise God because we have scripture that shows he was mocking and making fun of Jesus the Bible says both thieves were mocking and making fun of Jesus and then he gets a heart change at the last few moments of his life amen how merciful is God to scarcely Save The Sinner amen but Jesus wasn't like that Peter wasn't like that right Peter had a few moments where you know he he he cursed God he cursed and said curse words right uh he denied Christ but then he got the Holy Ghost and spent the rest of his life serving Jesus so he was not scarcely saved amen he was well saved we' say so you have the sa them Judas hung on his own tree the Bible said hung himself on a tree cursed is he that hangs himself on a tree Jesus was hung on a tree right and then you have the lost the so brother said you have four crosses well that's because there's four classes of Believers right four kinds of people and three there's three kinds of Believers we'd say just to stay with brother Ram's terminology let's just say four classes of Believers or four classes of three Believers sorry so four classes is a clear Bible Doctrine and that's why I'm preaching on this I feel led I'm going to go with some more examples I felt led to preach on this here so we've gone through this you have two Destinies three kinds of Believers four classes within these three kinds you have four crosses brother Brandon said you have four let's read that Revelation 2211 let's read that death there's four there's four uh conditions you can be in when the Rapture takes place there's only four four conditions because there brother man said there's four classes and it's totally 100% scriptural Revelation 2211 brother amen can you read that for sir he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still let's say praise the Lord ready praise the Lord that's the word of God there's going to come a time when you will you will just still your your your uh condition with God will take a pause and that moment brother Ram said is the rapture amen glory he that's filthy still let him be filthy there's coming a time when he that's holy is going to be holy still forever amen GL your of the the Christian or believer that you are it's going to come to a still a pause Point amen and we want to be the ones that are holy praise God at the very least righteous right like I asked the pastor one time I said brother you you have a hundred or so people in your church you know brother mam says a holy ghost filled Christian is so hungry for the word and you see signs Miracles and wonders sometimes in their life and they love the word of God they're in the word all the way I said how come how come we look at our as pastors we look at our churches it doesn't seem like everybody's like that and he said that's easy he said I'm trying to help people to be the best Christians that they can be if the best predestinated Christian somebody can be is a foolish virgin and we're supposed to help them be the best foolish virgin they can be to God Amen but for those who are predestined to be wise virgins or Holy Ghost no Christians we're going to make you the best wise virgin you can possibly be glory because we don't know who's who praise God Only God knows but your Works tell what you are by their fruit a tree is known amen glory I thought what wise words and I really needed to hear that from a minister who's been pastoring longer than me and I thought well how come everybody says they got the Holy Ghost but we don't we don't see more of it it's prob it's probably because either's not the timing of God for maybe these things but if people don't have all the fruits and all these things in their lives then maybe the highest they can possibly live is a foolish virgin we don't know so a preacher like everybody can be a wise virgin even though we know not everybody might not become that so God help us to live the highest Christian Life we can live amen glory like what Paul say he said make your calling election sure amen so you prove to everybody by your life and show God how much you love him and serve him and do the works of God and love God and that will prove what you are God help us to prove what we are amen hallelujah Peter proved what he was and he said even though I denied him he he said Jesus you know I love you right I'm going to prove that I love you amen right and the history on St Thomas everybody gives Thomas a a hard time but all the disciples did the same thing Thomas did when when they first heard news to those women remember those women came back and said our Lord has risen they said shut up what are you talking about you women you're just silly nonsense they did the same thing right Thomas just took it a step further and said well I've got to see the nail prints I gotta see all these things like that but Thomas he proved that he was saved because he after after doubting Christ when Christ showed in himself he was the one that took the gospel farthest into Asia amen he traveled more miles than any other Apostle he was proving what was on the inside of him he did believe he just needed a little more signs to believe it and if you need a little more signs just keep asking God God will give it to you God loves you and then prove what you are amen glory give needed signs a lot of people need signs there's nothing wrong with signs but once he shows you that sign you better run with all you've got to show everybody what side you're on Amen said that's why I come to church to show the devil which side I'm on amen glory that's why I come tonight to show you which side I'm on I got about 15 minutes here to show you what side I'm G here Glory now it's scriptural Church brother BR taught this it's in the church age book he quotes all these scriptures here here's another one turn to Second Timothy 2:20 there's four types of vessels did you know that there's four conditions you can be in there's four grounds we'll get to that there's four kinds of vessels that God can use and God uses all the vessels don't say he don't use a wood vessel he does he used Pharaoh he used Judas right he used them for their purpose he pre by predestination he knew what they desire so he worked out so that they would be used for their purpose absolutely remember God had to harden Pharaoh's heart to use him for his purpose to get bring glory to himself God knew Pharaoh didn't would never believe so he would to harden his heart in order to get him to use him to glorify God and yet Pharaoh was lost second Timothy 220 but church we don't know who's lost or who's saved so make your calling elections short tonight show everybody which side show everybody who you love with all your heart Jesus Christ amen second Timothy 2:20 well Scott you got that can you read that for us sir thank you amen now I forgot verse 21 let me read that if a man therefore Purge himself from these he should be a vessel unto honor so see now Paul is saying you need to be a vessel of Honor right here's the four kind of vessels you be a vessel of Honor Sanctified and meat for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work how many love the Lord amen four kinds of vessels four kinds of conditions at the Rapture four crosses amen glory here's another one there's four kinds of grounds now we're not going to read that one uh because we we've been over that I just preached on that when we preached on the seven Parable mysteries of Jesus Christ out of Matthew 13 and brother brand preached every revealed every one of those Mysteries to us amen so there's a good ground that produces three kinds of fruit now even with now this is a little deeper inside of the Holy Ghost filled Christian there's three levels of fruit there's hundredfold there's 60-fold and there's 30-fold how many you know that glory god had I imagine Apostles might be a h hundredfold or maybe a mother that raised an apostle she might be 100 fold right because because of her faithful teaching to that Apostle she's the Fifth Gospel right he goes out there and wins Souls maybe while dad's at work you know she helps ra and the Bible said husband and wife share their heirs together the grace of life amen amen they inherit the same uh reward but within the Holy Ghost filled Christian you have those that are hfold returned 60 and 30 now that's a good message there we're going to go over that too about rewards uh there's a thorny ground where they grow for a while but they get choked out and they never produce the right fruit these are these are foolish virgin they don't get the they don't have the Holy Ghost so that they can't produce real Holy Ghost filled fruit they can't do it right then you have Stony grounds like Judas uh never had a fleshly a real heart change toward God and then you have those that are on the way side that don't even get they don't don't produce anything praise God next uh this is what we read so I added this for tonight and I got 15 minutes Paul said or Peter said there's us we're the Christians he said if you suffer as a Christian he said happy are ye amen he said but if the righteous scarcely be saved where will the ungodly and The Sinner appear because these knew like Judas knew was Godly and what was ungodly did he not he sat there and heard Jesus preach for three and a half years but that's really something praise the Lord and he and he he hit it so well nobody knew when he left nobody knew at that dinner table he was going to go betray Christ now Jesus revealed to John right John was leading him his bosom John's the only one that knew but that's why they're called ungodly because they could have been Godly but they chose to be ungodly but the sinner never even was right with God never had any desire for God that's like pharaoh right oh my never repented never had never tried to even serve God just said I don't believe there's no God of Jehovah I don't believe in all these things nonsense now brother BR said this brother bam said AB lot could never be a Abraham he said Abraham was a silver dollar lot was a penny how many know he said that lot was scarcely saved that's what we're gonna preach a little bit on Sunday barely saved hardly saved the Angels had to drag him out of of Sodom the Bible said he tried to persuade him and he kept lingering they had to grab a hold of his hand and his daughter's hand and drag him out but Abraham you have to do that he was already separated he was not hanging around those sodomites Glory he was living so holy so separate he wasn't even attached to it he didn't feel any fire he didn't see any smoke or he didn't feel any smoke or anything like that now he saw from afar off but he was living so Godly out there he was a different type of Christian amen he was a higher type of Christian he was the father of the faith not impersonator of the faith amen remember the scripture we preached on lust he was tormented every day because of what he saw and what he heard because the lust of his eyes not Abraham praise God so if our eyes if we're looking at the wrong things and hearing the wrong things something's wrong with our walk with God that's that's not a wise virgin life that's a foolish Christian life now we all fall short but see your Works will prove Pro what you are if you keep enjoying those thing or keep trying to live on both sides oh my then you better get to the altar real fast right you better come out and get born again amen and receive the P power because that will take you out of that life into a life separated under Christ now Mrs lot was scarcely lost just barely lost she was on her way out and what happened brother man said it was the cries of her children right and her grandchildren the cries of her children turned her around and brother said another place she was uh going to miss all of her C parties and want to look one more time oh oh my worldly life and the Bible said she turned into a pillar of salt right scarcely lost so with this these few sermons here I'm preaching right along here to show you the difference scarcely saved scarcely lost but it'll help you if you're way out here because it shows you that you're not one of those scarcely saved amen glory it'll help you and this like I said it's right out of the scripture I felt inspired the sodomites were never even Believers in the first place Bible said they actually laughed uh the Bible that said actually lot son-in-laws actually laughed at him and said yo you're a joker you know you're sporting you that the fire and brimstone was goingon to rain out of heaven right and they laughed at and they made fun of the preacher remember brother said this is like brother Brams ministry Billy Graham and or Roberts right here yes now what about those that I don't know I'm not I don't know who to put in there I don't want to say I don't know for sure those that maybe take the mark of the beast or something like that now you can take this all the way down they they keep getting um they keep getting smaller and smaller but you can take it down now Moses he was definitely the highest quality I didn't have somebody there yet balum was lost the Bible said the midst of darkness is reserved forever for balum and then Barack he was he was a he was a moabit king he was a he was a heathen to begin begin with he said let's curse Israel now what kind of person would want to curse God's people somebody that's never been saved yes right cursing the one that God blessed so he was never saved to begin with you probably have a core in here right a Dayan core Dayan in there those that were lost and things like that it keeps going on and on and on okay now I got 10 minutes okay so bear with me here I got 10 minutes well this is kind of hard I can't even really get to my thoughts here but uh with this few series here we're focusing on that slide I already got so let me go back to that one it's the one I think back here uh just so you remember H where is it maybe I didn't get it on there I God where is it oh Church forgive me I I thought it had that I thought it had the one with first Peter on it didn't I have it on there I guess you can't really help me can you all right now there it is yeah there it is okay yeah it was right here forgive me sorry that's what I was looking for that's what we want to look at we want to spend a little time just a few services on this because I looked up every time brother Bram said scarcely saved I want to see what brother Bram said about it and then preach that by the grace of the Lord because this will help us uh to understand what is the mindset of a wise virgin how does a holy ghost filled Christian behave in this hour I love it amen I want to I want to close with this I'm going to try to close in seven minutes I'm going to try to close now um brother Ram reads this yeah thank you Lord just for tonight uh I just want to read this quote brother is speaking in his wonders to perform I just want to say this for those being baptized tonight Lydia and AA brother braham's preaching he said God loves a sinner and everything that's on Earth will praise him someday even the Sinners will praise Him Som because every knee will bow see knee shows praise right shows honor someday you'll bow to his knee or your your knee to his feet you'll bow as a reconciled by his works of reconciliation as you accepting him as your propit and be Washed by the Water of the word and the Waters of separation and become altogether child living God you'll worship Him in peace outside of that is a fearful thing so brother says outside of this is a fear thing it's fearful to live outside of that he says now he quotes our scripture for if the righteous be scarcely saved where will the Sinner and ungodly appear and that might happen to you before you leave the door brother brandom says brother always bring it down now see how your experience is with God right now you're not guaranteed tomorrow you might die tonight he would he'd say you little teenagers he said your little boyfriend he said might he said might be in a coffin by the end of the week he said he would just bring it right down to reality and try to get them to see where are you at with God don't take this service lightly examine your heart and life and see where you stand with God tonight amen he said will you be reconcile this afternoon by Believing on him and accepting him as your personal savior one hand again before how many hands before we pray he ask think of it accept him God he's doing an alter call he said God bless you little fellow that's good A little boy raised his hand he said I'm reading this for our little girls that want to be baptized you say he's too young brother ra says oh no he says oh no he isn't Jesus said suffer the little children to come unto me they say brother B that person is too young to come to you he said no Jesus said let the little children come yes sir honey boy you're welcome bless your little heart God save you may mommy take you to the church to be baptized and call upon the name of the Lord or as little Samuel you remember not much older than you that was called a prophet he heard the voice of the Lord the first open vision for a long time in Israel that thought came to me for tonight with this baptism that's going to happen then I'll close it just a few more things if you know the history of Samuel Samuel the his name actually means Asked of God why because Hannah asked for a child of God right so Samuel means Asked of God Samuel was asked of God he was uh Hannah asked God for a son and so God chose a son and gave it to Hannah you were asked of me you were asked of me so I'm giving you to your mother Hannah right and Samuel was weaned probably for three or four years in those days in other countries children nurse until they're three or four or five years old in some countries I don't know if you ever seen it it looks kind of strange but you have a 5-year-old a four-year-old nurse and a mom that that was common back in those days and so Samuel a four-year-old boy will say was taken to the house of God if you know the story the Bible said the word of God wasn't revealed to Samuel till one night one night he's sleeping and he heard Samuel Samuel and he went to Eli and said Eli did you call me no son go back to sleep goes back to sleep Samuel Samuel yes Eli I'm here he said no go back to sleep he does a third time and Eli perceives the Lord must be talking to him he's hearing voices out there and church I hope you can hear a voice tonight it don't have to be a loud one it's probably a still Small Voice amen if will just listen the Bible said it was because Samuel hadn't known the voice of the Lord yet God help us to hear the voice of God and know when God is speaking to us then you know the story but as Samuel grew Samuel was raised as a servant as a priest and Prophet unto God Samuel was a new generation of Believers in Acts 13 the Bible said that all the judges judge until Samuel and then God started raising up prophets Samuel was the first of a new generation why because a mother had a burden said I want a son and Lord if you give me a son I'll give him back to you oh I see all the desires of all of our hearts Lord let our children do something new praise God I when I give it back to you Lord use this child from the young age amen don't let them walk out there but I will take them Glory I will take my children to the house of God that they'll learn to serve you from a young age amen hallelujah praise God and I'll give the child back to you because I the child was asked of you I asked you for this child and Samuel was such a godly man that when Israel wented a king and rejected God God had to remind Samuel he said Samuel don't feel bad they haven't rejected you they rejected me Samuel took it so personally why because his heart was knit to God's heart when they said we don't want a prophet anymore Samuel personally and God had to say well listen that's just because our hearts are so nit close together don't take it personal Samuel they didn't reject you it's because they don't love me but this child's this this boy this man's heart from a child was so dedicated to God his heart was knit around God that even felt rejection when God was rejected help me to have that kind of Heart church amen help my children have that kind of a heart that when the word is rejected they feel rejected because they're so in love with that word am man oh my that's how Samuel was his heart was so knit to God church he was so close to God from serving God at a young age that the Bible said he judged all of Israel on a circuit how many know what a circuit is electrical circuit you have wires connecting from point A to point B to point C right and they've all got to be connected in order for electricity to flow through there that's what Samuel Samuel was he was electrical circuit he was a circuit of fire amen and he go on a circuit traveling all around Israel teaching them judging them prophesying them the Bible said he was so close to God the men of Israel would tremble when he would come to bring a word the Bible said are you come to bring Jud judgment or you come in peace B they would tremble a man of God like that all because he was given to God dedicated to God at a young age amen and took him into the house of God God at a young age my mother drugged all four of us uh I'll say like this my mom drugged me when I was younger she drugged me to church three times a week somebody told me that I thought that was pretty funny drugged me to church she drugged me when I was younger drugged me to church three services every week and all six of us my dad would stay at home he didn't want to serve God in the public like that he didn't believe in denominations which was good in some sense but bad because he wasn't serving God the way but she drugs six kids every Wednesday night and twice on Sunday back to the house of God and she's got three preachers out of those six amen amen and one daughter of course she can't preach but she's in the message and so forth and all of them go to church every Sunday it's just like Hannah Hannah said if you give me children I'll take them back to you I'll take them back to your house they will dwell at the house of God amen amen that's the thing to do keep your children in the presence of God Amen and if you train them up in that way they they'll not depart from it when they're older beautiful he was such a servant that he dedicated his life to traveling teaching in a circuit preaching the gospel uh judging Israel and the Bible also said I'll close to this the Bible also said God let none of the words of his mouth fall to the ground amen all because a mother wanted a child and she said if you give me a son I will dedicate him back to you yes and God so honored that four-year-old from all the way up God never let one of those words fall to the ground let's stand to our feet here now if you got your Bible go to back to revelation 22 I'm going to close with that again when someone either obeys or disobeys the word of God like we said like uh either denying the water baptism or denying the message or denying the Revelations or they they live worldly and dress sexy or or smoke and drink and cuss and enjoy dirty movies and everything like that their very Works prove which one of these they are their very life proves which one they are how many believe that revelation 22 verse 11 let me go back to there remember you're not saved by works but works the right Works show you are saved and with all your heart make your calling and election sure let everybody know which side you're on because we don't want to be scarcely saved or scarcely lost we want to be truly saved we want to be sealed by the Holy Ghost amen verse 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that's righteous let him be righteous still there's the foolish virgin and he that's holy let him be holy still now here's Jesus and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as work shall be so whatever fruits they produce that you get a reward for that praise God works are important right you get a reward for your works but they don't make you saved you already are saved verse 13 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates of the city for without our dogs now that means homosexual dogs Sorcerers hor mongers and murderers and AD doters and whoever loveth and maketh a lie I jesus sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I'm the root and offspring of David and the Bright Morning Star and the spirit and the bride say come tonight we're asking everybody come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost come to Jesus sell out all to Christ amen don't let your Works be just righteous let's make them holy praise God amen amen let him that Hearth say come and him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely let's bow our heads here now as you bow your heads I'm going to read this from Brother BR said in this is in the Sixth Seal brother said and Jesus knows when that last believer comes in then his intercessing days is over he comes forth and to claim what he's interceded for for he's doing the kinsman redeemer work now and comes forth to receive his own he said oh my that ought to set every Chris to searching himself and holding his hands before God and saying cleanse me oh Lord look into my life and let me see where my bad part is let me get it out of the way right quick see for if the righteous be scarcely saved where will the Sinner and ungodly appear it's checking up time amen so with all heads bowed how many would hold your hearts up to God and say cleanse me Lord look into my life and make sure every part is Right In Me Amen brother man said the very fact that Jesus here is going to stop saving one day and if you're holy still you'll be holy you'll have a pause if you're righteous you'll still be righteous you can't go any higher with God oh my church may God cleanse us here tonight cleanse our hearts Lord God lord you knew I I preach a shorter message Lord trying to get this baptismal done but Lord the people pressed their way out to the house of the Lord and father this word was placed on my heart very heavy all Sunday and Monday Tuesday and today Wednesday Lord May these words seek deep into our hearts may we understand the scripture and say that Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments for those that do the Commandments have a right to eat of the tree of life oh Lord it must be earned it must be something that uh Lord a Christian lives a Christian must live the right kind of life in order to partake of the tree of life so Lord help your children here tonight Lord you know what they might be battling Lord and so forth I pray Lord God cleanse them here tonight show us our bad place that we can get it right in the name of Jesus Christ churches talk to the Lord for a few moments in your own heart just L just uh have communion with him talk to him remember he's that still Small Voice try to hear it this evening Heavenly Father we're going to close here Lord on this prayer PR but Lord I pray we'd be like Samuel and be able to hear that voice if your holy spirit's calling Jesse Jesse Jose Jose amen amen each one of us can place our name there dear God if we hear the Holy Spirit calling us to come up higher Lord help us to go up higher your Prophet said it's checking in time your Prophet also said it's lamp trimming Time Lord God sometime there will come a still there come a pause with spirit spiritual achievements in God and people can go no higher when Jesus comes back in the Rapture so Lord help us to live higher Holiness Lord God help us live a holy life before you dear Jesus Lord I pray for each person here that they'll live higher they'll make their calling election sure I'm not preaching Works salvation I'm preaching salvation produces works and Lord on Sunday we'll show how Paul said Paul said I keep my body body and beat it and bring it under subjection that I as one who preach would not be a Castaway so because Paul didn't know Paul couldn't tell everybody he was born again he couldn't prove he was in the Rapture so he said in order to make sure that I'm not a make believer I'm not a Judas I make myself live a holy life I model my life after Christ I Die daily I crucify the affections and lusts that are in my body Lord help us to have that kind of determination to make our calling and election sure dear God not to worry Lord God am I saved or not not that but Lord to have Godly fear and say Lord I want my life to always be pleasing I want my love to be fresh I don't want to compromise I don't want to get lukewarm I want to always be on Fire Lord God let that be our testimony here tonight I pray that for that those two new Christians Lord God my daughter's L AAA thank you for their respond to your Holy Spirit Lord I never talked them into it we didn't beg them but Lord I did tell my wife just a few days ago I felt that the Lord might save them pretty soon I thought they might get baptized pretty soon because I've seen them reading their Bibles and writing about God and talking about the Lord and singing and playing Tambour in the church I really felt led Lord that you might bring them to Salvation Lord you have done it and I just preached recently how we can live such a holy life till angels will visit our homes Lord I believe your angels have visited my home in drawing my girls to repentance for the Bible says the Angels rejoice when one Sinner repents and comes to you dear God thank you Lord for your mercy thank you for your grace bless us now Lord as we
