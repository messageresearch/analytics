God hold us closer to the eye bosom Lord to hear your secrets to hear your truth I will give you the glory in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen praise God let's take our Bibles tonight here go to Revelation 19 like to continue on this book of Revelation thought tonight and then Lord willing you know I had a lot of study time this week Lord willing we'll finish numerology on Sunday I've been studying a lot of hours on that by God's grace so looking forward to finishing that and then moving into or finishing the other series you know by God's grace so revelation 19 let's start at verse 1 revelation 19 1 if you dare say Amen alright let's just read a three verse one together and then I'll read verse two alright thanks Lydia wonderful let's read verse one let's read it on three one two three and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God and I'll read verse tube for true and righteous are his judgments and now he's a judge right for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever let's just have one more word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it on into God here so good to see the Saints tonight let's ask the Lord to administer one more time Heavenly Father we bow our heads we've read your word break it to ass now Lord teach us through thy word Lord Rosse closer to you then we fill your PO even greater as time goes on as time gets shorter to the rapture let us fear your poll in a greater manner Granite Lord in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God like two look at revelation 19 tonight and Liddy I'm gonna switch over here in just a moment so I can just show just a few slides here so yeah you can switch over Liddy whenever you're ready huh so let's look at revelation 19 we'll see how far we get by the grace of the Lord let me pull up my notes by God's grace this is part 2 of Revelation 19 last time we look mainly at the mark of the beast which was there in verse 20 but I like to go back to the beginning of revelation 19 and just build build from there as we go all right here we are so that's I'm just going to read here I'm gonna start reading and then we'll break this up into the parts that we see part 101 before that door I like to just remind us of these quotes brother Brown was preaching in 1961 he just got done with the church age book and he says are you enjoying the revelation and then this is the quote where he says he said you know I wish we just had now about to March or April just to put up a great big canvas across the back and just come down in daytime and draw out the pictures and the whole chart and just raise them up and down like window shades you know like I've always dreamed sometime of having a great big tabernacle somewhere where I could reach down and pull this chart down come all the way across the platform and revelation and the interpretations the Lord has given me and take a pointer and start through there and bring these ages down then when we get through with that raise that one up pull the other one down like this and start on that and teach it through oh that would just be like a little heaven wouldn't it just sit complete winter through just sit down with the Lord amen I love that call I'm just gonna keep reminding us of that because one day if the Lord tarries I want to write a book on just the whole revelation like we did with the immodesty book and then hopefully we want God will raise up one of my children or one of any child and they can learn how to do graphics real well we can make some real good graphics because that's what brother brand wanted to do he wanted to have just a beautiful presentation of all the revelations I like that the revelations and the interpretations and just have it all laid out on a beautiful just presentation so the Lord willing at one point I sure would like to do that I think that'd be pretty pretty wonderful lay it out and then all the people that can hear it to hear it by God's grace now all that want to hear it so revelation 19 let's look at these thoughts here I'm going to just pull up the themes first I kind of outline my video series on themes and then revelations or key revelations and then the timing so there's a couple themes in here there's the heavens praise at the horse judgment the marriage supper of the Lamb and then Christ's return on a white horse Armageddon yeah so let's go back to that let's look at the themes first and we'll try to preach these by the grace of the Lord now verse 1 I'm gonna just read verse 1 to 6 is the first theme it's this theme of heavens praise at the horse judgment revelation 19 1 and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which had corrupt the earth with her fornication as avenged the blood of his servants at her hand this is quite a scripture here okay we've seen now God he transitions over to the judge and he's he's truly judging this this mother harlot we looked at the last few weeks and all of heaven many voices in heaven are rejoicing at this that judgment is being done mine for 2,000 years this has been corrupting the world right 2,000 years and you know God really gave her a warning about a thousand years ago according to church ages I believe was in Thyatira where Jesus says I've given her space to repent and she hasn't repented right God issued that turning all the way back there and she's failed to repent but here God is pouring out he's already looks like he's already poured out his wrath first said he hath he hath judged the judgments in the past heavens rejoicing much people are saying Alleluia power glory honor to the Lord he's poured it out and the Bible said he's avenged the blood of his servants at her hand now church that's something we just got to remember when we see and justices out in the world we have to remember God is going to pour out or God is gonna avenge those right we have to remember that there is a law of reaping and sowing what's over man sews that shall you reap and sow all the evil and it breaks our hearts doesn't it here about the evil murders and and all the all the wickedness that's done it breaks our hearts to hear about it but God is going to avenge all the innocent blood amen because he's just he's righteous praise God he's holy amen and so church as much as it doesn't break our hearts to see the news you know times when when people are mistreated or abused and people go missing and they find them later their bodies and it just it it grieves us but we have this we have this confidence doubt in our hearts that God will bring all things to judgment amen he'll make every wrong right and thank God Church that even in our thank God we can rejoice in the fact that God is going to help us to make all of our wrongs right right now before that day of judgement amen we go through our judgments right now so we don't have to worry about that day of judgment amen thank God because this in church you know God God allowed Moses to be a murderer but God forgave him and God still used them for the kingdom of God amen God let David be an adulterer and a murderer but God still used him for the kingdom of God amen God let Paul hold coats while Stephen was being stoned but God still used him Miley for the kingdom of God amen so let us not focus on the guilt and shame of our mistakes let us repent move on and press on the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus taking that like Doug Paul said forget those things amen and press on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen because see we we're not you know we're not in this group were that actually we're the group in probably in heaven where the group in heaven saying Alleluia God is going to avenge all the wrongs God's going to make all wrongs right hallelujah I believe that group is a search I believe that group is us it's many the Bible said much people didn't say Angels glory it's an achievement that's you and I saying all praise all strength all glory to God who avenges all things hallelujah amen we don't see it on this side do we we don't see it very often on this side well I do want to say this you know I've been felt that limb felt little convicted here anybody misunderstands me you know I just wanted to say this said I you know I've been watching the news lately and and I appreciate our president I just want to say that I do appreciate our president many times and I'm if I've done in the past with Obama or George Bush forgive me I never want to condemn individuals I never want to put anything on any individuals the Bible said we should pray for those are in power because they're God's ministers and God placed them there for us right that's what Romans 13 says and you know they all make mistakes right just like we all make mistakes I I make mistakes but I appreciate the fact that our president is at least standing up for people and I appreciate he stood up for Israel and I just want to make sure I say that we've talked about that before but kind of I said I mentioned on Sunday how Trump signed that for the churches I think that might have been a wrong move but let's pray for him anyway praise God I always want to add that you know I know Barack Obama did those things about homosexuality and I tried to pray for I still pray for that want to make sure I say that that while we're here you know we won't see all the judgments but we can pray that God will lead those people in authority it's a very corrupt system and we should keep praying for them as long as we're here in the flesh praise God so I want to make sure I I state that because I kind of felt checked on Sunday you know I I do appreciate all the good things like we got the lowest the lowest job unemployment numbers ever in our country more people are working that's a good thing Church we know this there's going to be less and less people saved you know as time goes on but we but our job is to give everyone an opportunity to be saved praise God and so we're thankful for all these things and we need to keep praying I just don't want to put the wrong slant on something I want to pray for all mankind now and I've been learning a lot about history like I said on Sunday like through this man David Barton he's a man who owns a thousand documents from our early church fathers and our church fathers had a lot of faith in their hearts George Washington the member keith randolph was here he's read books about him and i've been listening to david barton and in all his writings he talks about how God is in control God is in control God's raised up this nation God's been blessing this nation we got to enjoy our blessings and worship Christ with all we have while we have the liberties praise God we should enjoy this before as we said before they shot our doors it may happen in our lifetime it may not but we ought to take not take for granted the liberties that we have now praise God we ought to just rejoice and say thank God for all that's been done that God can be glorified in this nation this nation's done more than any other nation to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ praise God and that's why we've had good golly we had a good godly founders remember George Washington was a man of vision praise God he saw visions he prayed that before before attacks he would pray and ask God to give victory and God gave him victory he had many struggles but God gave him victories I get Valley Forge and different ones I can't remember all the the battles now but he was a man he went through hardships and battles and and even Lincoln our her to her David Barton talk about Lincoln and and he said both Lincoln row about George Washington and how the pressures of their their duties drove them to their knees church that's what our that's what our trials should do they should drive us to our knees amen we should come here we should we should come here we got burdens we should get on our knees and cast them under the Lord and get down to business with God just not you know we just shouldn't not and say okay I'm I'm gonna do that we should actually do that we should actually cast our cares upon the Lord this is our time to get closer to God right now because faith comes by hearing the Word of God amen so I just want to make sure I say that you know as I'm looking at all this vengeance you know and and it's a holy vengeance it's not evil vengeance this is a holy vengeance that God is pouring out and it's hard with politics you know because I watch the news I just sometimes I want vengeance to happen upon these left-wing Democrats that say such evil things and they blaspheme the name of Lord but Church I'm human too we've all got to say Lord vengeance is not mine vengeance is yours saith the Lord we got to pray for mercy on these people that God will open their eyes every now and then it happens you know there's like that man Lee Strobel if you never heard of him he was a he was a famous journalist for the Washington Post and he was the atheist and he said about he said about he's a journalist so he said about two years of his life to disprove Christianity he was an atheist a drunkard he hated Christianity but people were praying for him his wife was praying for him and a man at the Washington Post one of their best riders is about 30 years ago as he studied all the facts around Christianity all the science and archaeology he became a believer amen whatever your testimony is he God's got to have a journalist on the day of judgment amen a journalist who found salvation of course he's not a message believer but I believe he's saved amen God's got to have a schoolteacher praise God God's got to have a security officer God's got to have a mother you know house and office workers God's got to have each each gain every kind and God loves his people praise God hallelujah and so we got to be faithful we have to find all those remaining seeds all those weak seeds that we can glean for the glory of God hallelujah I'm just thankful for God's grace to save a wretch like me praise God but see there's just looking at this thought of vengeance the many people in heaven are rejoicing because God has done what's right now this is deserving church this is deserving that praising Jesus because he's pouring out what they deserve praise God we all like to see that you know we all like to see people get what they deserve don't you alright you see when someone works hard I like to seem to get a promotion because that's what they deserve like Jesus said if you're faithful a little you're faithful as much will the same stir on the other side of people won't repent then they need to know they need to face the judges for that you know they they need to know that it was wrong what they did so here heaven is rejoicing they're praising God God was so patient as we said for 2,000 years he gave her space to repent and she repented not she was guilty of the blood of all God's prophets and servants but they all waited upon the timing of God to part his vengeance because venge does mine saith the Lord praise God that's what Romans 12:19 said vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord that's why we the RAM says you know Rome is our enemy and we must program says we must fight Rome see we got to understand that doesn't mean fight with our fists and fight with guns that's not what it means it means fight in prayer we've had glory amen those that will wrestle against spiritual wickedness in high places now if it ever came down the war yeah we would fight just like the early foundation fathers did yeah they had to fight for our rights to worship that's fine if the Lord leads us to do that but I don't see it in Scripture hopefully we don't have to but there's nothing wrong with that there's a time for war there's a time for peace God led them to fight for their freedoms but the Bible said here vengeance is mine and and God God waited patiently November let's go to zico 33 because I don't know the last time I've read this Zico for 311 God doesn't delight when people die when we could men die in fact when the saints die God loves it because the Bible said precious is in the side of the Lord is the death of his Saints but God doesn't like it when sinners die and I imagine God's not gonna like pouring out wrath upon Babylon but he has to do it because he's a righteous judge he has to punish iniquity and the only way he's Justin doing it is if he gave them time after time space the repent think about that space years a centuries decades he gives him so much space to repent zekiel 33:11 saying to them as I live saith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that wicked turn from his way live turn the attorney from your evil ways for why will you die o house of Israel can you hear God's heart think about that God's heart is saying the same thing tonight you know too we say Pope Francis he's knocking on his heart's door saying why will you do this won't you turn won't you turn to the truth God doesn't delight in the death of the wicked every sinner in every man at the strip club tonight every woman in the bar getting drunk tonight watching the game the baseball game whatever the god is knocking on their hearts won't you turn he's knocking turn turn turn but if they refuse God has one choice he has to lay upon the judgments but this is God's heart he has no death in the pleasure of the wicked oh the loving heart of God go to Jeremiah 21 as I told you I've been reading through the Book of Jeremiah I'm almost a I'm almost done there's fifty chapters on think I'm on 36 Jeremiah 21 this is a striking chapter and I want you to see church this is a very prophetic thing of what's happening now at the in chapter 21 Zedekiah is this evil king he's the last king of Judah and he's hoping for a miracle Nebuchadnezzar is already surrounding Jerusalem and they're hoping for a miracle he said go ask the Prophet and let's and they're speaking positive things and that's where churches are all doing today speak good things speak speak good things you know denominations I'm talking about mega church the speaker thing speakers they all think there's all this revival hope for America when there's not there's hope for individuals but not for the whole nation but look what he says here look at verse 1 and 2 the word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah said unto him pastor the son of melchi ax and Zephaniah the son of messiah the priests saying enquire I pray thee of the Lord for us for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us if so be that the Lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us look at this they're saying O God God send your prophet and give us good words that you'll do wonderful works who wants to guess what Jeremiah said Jeremiah said no he said I'm just we're not gonna read the whole chapter but he said he's going to precede you without walls and he's gonna burn down the city look at verse 5 and I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and with the strong arm even in anger and fury and in great wrath my the King says do under swigs come on Jeremiah give us a prophesy let the prophets say good things that God's gonna rescue the people of God even though we're surrounded like the days of Hezekiah like the days of Josiah like the days of ASA right are those kings that were surrounded but God delivered them they were looking back at just the good things they wanted the good blessings of God without doing the good things of God amen church if we want the good things of God we've got to do good things we've got to live holy if we want supernatural things we got to live supernaturally close to God amen that's what brother says in the statue ever made he said that's the reason God has a new more miracles amongst us because we're not getting built up into the things of God now that's we're just referring to individuals but see like I'm thankful that we see in our ministry you know cam you know pray or praying here then that Holy Spirit comes in the room people getting filled with the Holy Ghost when we're there in the pointing that woman's eye sights being healed there I thank the Lord for those things that God with us praise God I'm talking about as a group as as a group as a church if we all start seeking God we'll see more of God because when you draw nigh to God he draws you can't help but he shows up in the supernatural amen now go down to verse 13 behold I am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and the rock of the plain say the Lord which say who shall come down against us or who shall enter in our habitations see they're all being prideful who's gonna take away our houses you know they're all prideful the Jews are prideful even though Nebuchadnezzar is making war against them and surrounded them verse 14 but I'll punish you according to the what the fruit of your doings see saith the Lord and I will kindle the fire and the force thereof and it shall devour all things round about it so they're saying God deliver us like the days of old but God's saying you haven't turned you never turn back to me praise God and then in preceding chapters I'm sorry preceding chapters you'll see God tells etic ayah you need to leave the city now or you're gonna die instead of the kind of refuses I'm not listening that prophet on the but then at the very end he tries to leave but then you know he gets his eyes plucked out and dies and everything so in other words that God gave him so many warnings to the Prophet but he kept turning it down turning it down any never turned from his wicked ways and so this is what God is doing with America and the entire world they won't turn from their evil ways they're hoping for miraculous but they're not submitting to the miracle-working God amen just like the days of elide remember the days of Eli when they got the ark and they all they were surrounded by the Philistines and they got the ark and the Bible said they all shouted but then they got whipped by the Philistines remember that see people can have the Ark the word we've got the message the hour but if we don't live close to God we're going to get whipped Oh but if we live close to God we're going to put that devil on the run amen that's the thought I'm going to bring out at the numerology God told Israel if one of you is in the land and your faith on the land one of you shall chase away 100 and they said five of you were chase away 300 and then God saw an anointing men right like Samson one of you he drove a thousand killed a thousand Amen see when people obeyed the Lord and live the Word of God God back to mouth praise God and God who the same thing today God will back us up if we'll just do what he tells us to do hey glory we'll look at that one on Sunday Lord willing there's a whole bunch of those see if we shout without the character then we're not going to get the victory now we can all be taken on a guilt trip by the devil but Church if we honestly repent then we've gotta we gotta say God forgive me we've got to say God let me feel your forgiveness we've got to move on from the past move on from the guilt and realize we're walking the light weren't overcomer God doesn't remember that God forgives us of that and now we can be a real soldier for Christ amen you know I told the children you know before that woman got healed on two Sundays ago at brother camps her I say before she got healed I made a little mistake on Saturday and I apologize to the children remember that children I laughed at something I shouldn't have laughed at and I apologize to the children I went home and I apologized and see I repented of it beforehand and god bless us with good services people repent and people get healed thank you thank the Lord for that people's lives being discerned you know keeping them from quitting Amen God strengthen that me to keep it but see I made a mistake I laugh to something I got in the flesh I got to natural I got to carnal but before I came up to preach I relayed them pray for half an hour that's God to forgive me got up at 5:30 to pray and seek God and fasted all those things to try to get right see if we repair and live the Word of God that we can shout with the ark and the art the part of the ark will move for us amen glory see because we all fall short of the glory of God we got to move on from the guilt and just at church I was honestly struggling that morning God are you gonna move today again forgive I made this mistake but God came through amen he showed me the glory of forgiveness amen hallelujah that he looks beyond my faults and see my needs amen hallelujah that Heatley is faithful that proved to me that he's faithful and just to forgive us of all unrighteousness amen hallelujah thank the Lord see we still got character the fact we do say we're sorry shows we got character the fact you do repent shows you got good character oh they do because you're recognizing your wrongs now hope that helps their church God was giving Israel the fruit of her doings and what year was this six oh nine so you know David ruled a thousand BC so for 400 years God sent prophet after prophet warning them live right live right live right and finally God said fine if you don't live right I'm gonna judge you through Nebuchadnezzar my servant then 400 years space to repent but they didn't repent oh my thank God that we can repent in this our church we see this is what's happening in America she won't repent program said the say at the Lord 1956 it was 50 years it was a year of Jubilee after 1906 and all the ministers came back Billy Graham and all Robertson brother man they all preached in America but they turned it down you know why the big in 1956 was Elvis Presley look it up the whole battle for America was Elvis Presley or preachers like brother branham and the more the majority said we want Elvis rather than we want Jesus in that said look at that it was it was Judas and Jesus right there brother my goodness and they I say like this Barabbas or Jesus and they chose Barabbas they crucified the Lord Jesus Christ the effects of the Holy Ghost oh but thank God we got the revival today okay anybody says we've got the revival of the Word of God amen it's transforming my life it's transforming your life it's sweeping around the world it's the only living message of the world and we got it and it stirs our hearts it makes us happy makes us rejoiced it's God's word for this hour amen hallelujah it's still going around the world it's that open book thank God every time we read this word it's an open book fresh revelation from the things of God that's right church so true now let's finish this chapter looks good back to Revelation 19 not the chapter I meant in the next the first six verses forgive me revelation 19 what we read one two three yeah now verse four nineteen four and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worship God that sat on the throne how many gods one God how many Thrones one throne see that just burns up the Trinitarians saying Amen hallelujah so be it praise our God and a voice came out of throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great all right there I am I'm one of those small ones I'm not a great one I was small but I am one of their main head I'm where there's little tiny pebbles on the beach most small and great the small one say praise the Lord amen oh yeah I am right there I'm in the scripture amen Loretta said you got to find yourself in the wind I'm right there on the small one glory row six and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude a voice of many waters has the voice of mighty thunderings saying Alleluia my for the Lord got him there it is Thunder Thunder Wow that's strike you it almost looks like it's the voice of the bride because she's got the voice of Christ the spirit and the bride say come it almost looks like that that all voices are thundering out because it's all the voice of the Holy Spirit in us right because once we get our new bodies brother sister it ain't our flesh anymore it's eternal life as soon as I get a new body by there and this body drops off the Bible said I got in eternal body that means that body's got eternal life amen and it's no longer media this flesh is no longer a sin prone or mistake boat but it's perfect it's a complete eternal body amen oh so I imagine our voices our voices will thunder too because there's thunderings the Bible said I never caught that till now the voice of mighty thunderings the great multi who is that monster it's got to be us the Lord God omnipotent reigns makes me feel like singing our God reigns oh God ah cuz let me sing it there amen we'd like to sing it here too oh thank you Lord Jesus man what a thought there that's striking now let's read our next theme the marriage supper verses 7 to 10 that's our to 7 let's be glad to rejoice and give honour and him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted now let me I'm in the separator that's the scripture where brother Branham says he said a lot of people will say well I'll quit smoking and drinking if God will just take it from me but man says no that's what you've got to do I read that and Napoleon about the pipe God's not gonna push push you through a pipe and call you to overcomer there's certain things God wants you to do to overcome through your own faith so God puts a portion of faith in your heart and want you to overcome now let me see I can pull it up real quick here then everybody can see the quote would you like to see that quote tonight would help you okay let me see if I can pull it up here I had a document that had all of CAM sermons on here first church okay yeah there it is oh yeah it's pretty easy yeah let me pull it up I just got to go to the different document here there it is yeah and so it's uh that's loading up okay so I'll get started then you'll see a little bit it's actually from the marriage of the land servant and that's the arena right now in the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready he said then we know there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies he said that's just as sure to be as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride I'm on slide 14 so let me pull that up that's kind of handy there we go that wasn't too bad was it it's going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready aren't you behave I aren't you glad that your wedding dresses already here on the earth amen you can make ready right now praise God if you notice it said she made herself ready so many says so we see a lot of people gonna make excuses they're gonna make this juice like well I would have overcome if God would have helped me and God's like I gave you the word you can overcome with the word right if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from line or stealing I'll serve him like oh brother Branham says but that's up to you see you got to do something - you gotta do something - they either overcomes shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down amen see God's working with your will right your human will that's how God is going to judge everybody did you give him all your will or just some of you will let's give God all of our will that's our victory that's our victory in the love divide that we buy love choose to do all of God's will and we sacrifice all of our will he said I like that word Oh mine she's made herself ready you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull this out the other end say blessed is he that overcome you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself and doing that we show our faith in respects to God this is how God is going to give us rewards in heaven it's based upon our decisions that we made remember God told brother Branham through that guy who spoke in tongues I forget his name a great portion of having to wait you because you chose the harder way Church let me tell you you're choosing the harder way tonight there's a lot of things you could be doing at home and working to try to get more money you could be going to bigger churches you know denominational churches that compromise on the Word of God but you and I are choosing the harder way and got a bless you for that and you'll get the victory and love demand for that amen hallelujah there's a lot of churches I would like like to have your membership tonight but they'll get you to compromise on God's Word right but see you've got something to do he's not gonna push you through a pipe and say you overcame buddy see we've got the lay down our will and we got to give it to God because she makes herself ready by heard by her own death to self will right does that help by God's grace he said he can't push you through a little pipe and call you an overcomer it's just like the promised land now that co-starred on here but brother man said God said God told Joshua take the whole thing now you go fight for it take one step at a time right now did God fight for them yes there's times God fought for them like a Jericho and there's other times remember when Joshua defeated a I'd remember that Joshua win there and actually killed them he sent 5,000 over here remember the story a I was a big city he set 5000 on the bush over here hiding behind some force pizza and then he took a small group he led them in there thought he drew out all their armies glory he fought him and drew and he drew all their men outside the city and then they blew the horn darker girl and then the ambush came in five thousand men all snuck in the back door and they killed and destroyed everything with their own hands with their own swords see sometimes guy wants to fight for you other times God wants you to fight yeah but he can't find all your battles really or else then you're not an overcomer what did you overcome Oh God carry me through to the rapture I can't read my Bible and pray anymore I don't have the strength to go to church yet you got strength to watch YouTube all day or go down to the bar and drink a beer you know they got strength to do that oh no it's so sad you got straight to go to the movie theater and push back the chair you know and watch Star Wars or something like that or spider-man you know they got strength to do that but then I've strength to pray and get sincere with God say God clean up my heart and soul change me give me your sword of your way so I can fight off all the enemies that are bothering me amen so you've got something to do praise God amen let us do what God's called us to do hallelujah I want to read now that was all right see these are all laying in the message here and they're there for a purpose we got to make ourselves ready that's what that's what they're happy about look at verse 7 again Church there they're saying let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him because the marriage of the lamb has come and she's made herself ready heavens like glad heavens rejoicing say she's ready and we're happy she's gonna marry Jesus Jesus is the great one we're happy she got the work and she finally is ready to be married oh yeah verse 8 and the her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints praise God alright let me pull up some scriptures on this here yes verse 8 actually that's good to keep reading the eight or the nine and 10 - and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called on the marriage supper of the lamb they say then to me these are the true sayings of God verse 10 and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy praise God there's a lot in there but notice even when we look at on Sunday when we looked at Joel chapter 2 about the prophecy of the latter rain that's the spirit of Jesus working in our church the spirit of Jesus is trying to point out the prophecy that we're supposed to recognize and live today right that's the Spirit of Christ Christ is pointing us to the prophecy that we've got to fulfill amen now let's look at this real quick here there's numerous scriptures well there's so many well let's real quick got communions go to Matthew 26 29 let's just look at that thought real quick Matthew 26 29 see it's a marriage supper 26 29 now he does communion verse 29 but I say to you I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom look at that he's he's having communion with all these apostles who were pretty soon are gonna be scattered like sheep her high church look how loving Jesus is he knows they're all gonna forsake him he know he's got to go the cross all by himself but he promises them I know you'll get it right I know you'll overcome praise God amen even though you're gonna get defeated here you're gonna be scattered I know you're not gonna quit you're gonna overcome praise God and then I'm gonna have communion with you at the marriage supper of the Lamb amen he knows Peter's gonna deny him glory oh yeah he knows they're all gonna scatter like chickens and run away he knows that but he realizes that that once they get the Holy Ghost they're gonna be Eagles amen see because programs they never got the full armor of God so they got to Pentecost oh thank god so he promises I'm gonna eat supper with you and he knows they're gonna deny him in a matter of hours right they're gonna walk over to Garden of Gethsemane they're all gonna fall asleep they're gonna get up the sort the soldiers are going to come Jesus is gonna speak they're all gonna soldiers have fall down they're gonna get up Peter's gonna try to cut off Malka says here come here and he cuts him off thinking that thinking that he's fighting real good Angie's gonna be like if you take the sword you're gonna die with the sword he picks up the air off the ground and puts it back on Malka says head in love MA and he still says knowing all that he still says we're gonna have communion together when this is all said and done oh god help us to see how God lovingly forgives us and how we have a place at that marriage supper of the Lamb if we just repent and continue serving Christ they met Omaha glory what a blessing that is their promise is supper see it's promised in the scripture now let's uh let's jump to the fine linen here now go to Titus chapter 2 the righteousness of saints Titus 2 verse 5 yeah let's look at this fine linen here this is one of the symbols in key revelation I'm gonna jump ahead yeah the white garments I think I'll just yeah probably wanna close with that in just a few moments here give it 15 or 20 minutes here uh Titus okay I was having trouble fine Titus - praise the Lord Titus - oh no I'm sorry Titus three I wrote down the wrong scripture forgive me now this is a real good scripture uh yeah that's the start of verse 1 because there it is I was talking about the United States subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to do every good work to speak evil no man that's what I was saying forgive me I know when I ever speak evil against any man I just want to condemn any evil that they do but I gotta remember I do evil - and I want to be merciful praise God speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto all men for we ourselves also wear sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another how many can say amen to that I used to live in a lot of hate I hated different people in school I hated my dad I hate a lot of people but God has given me Grace and victory verse 4 but after that I love it the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared glory now if I works of righteousness we have done but according to his mercy saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior that being justified by His grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life now see that with it's not all righteousness that we have right the Bible said that we have righteousness is symbolic of white garments right so it's not our righteousness but it's the righteousness of Christ praise God when you believe in Christ and trust in Christ that his blood was shed for you then the righteousness of Christ comes upon you amen so that's what's why I want to read right there and righteousness the Bible said is like a garment praise God it's like a garment so let's look at another scripture here there's matters so many scriptures I think I'll just hit the highlights here it's a garment so let's go to Luke 24:49 here's the promise of you getting a garment this is the promise of you and I getting the righteousness of Christ Luke 24:49 24:49 and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen now endued means clothed right so if you look it up in the Greek and dude means clothed so he said way in wait in Jerusalem until you're clothed with power from on high right amen so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is when a person puts on an eternal garment of power it's a garment of righteousness and it's the righteousness of saints amen let's look at a few more there's quite a few scriptures on this so everybody can see it hopefully by the grace of the Lord we're not going to read it but Matthew 22 speaks of the parable of the wedding garment one one guy tries to slip in there and he tries to get in the wedding supper without the garment and Jesus comes in there one last time and I typed that to the rapture or maybe the maybe the squeeze or the latter rain right before the wedding the King slips in there one more time and he finds a man who's not born again and he kicks him out see God is going to let the Holy Spirit take out everybody who's not born again out of the bride and at the last moment before the rapture it's all going to be broad numbers here I like that see he's got a purge he's got a purge the foolish from the wise right before the wedding amen other day of the King steps in the king himself Christ the Holy Spirit comes in to make sure that there's everybody who's there has a wedding garment on hey man see I believe that's that last sweep the King coming in obably that's a latter rain the latter rain will push out any foolish virgin and only the elect will be there for that meeting in the air amen hallelujah see it's a garment the Holy Ghost is a garment on your soul I'll say like that it can't be on your body because we don't see it it can't be on your spirit because your spirits open all the time to attacks from Satan right but the soul is the nature of the spirit and the soul is the real person praise God and so the soul is clothed with the righteousness of Christ holiness praise the Lord that's right now there's quite a few and I think like I said let me just finish with this thought I just want to I'll stay with this thought here so fine linen and clean and white is symbolic of the baptism of the Holy Ghost or eternal life let me read you the quote brother Ham says it plainly this is from the Sardis and Church age he says in the second resurrection the souls under the altar or the Jews are set forth as given white robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of right white robes so go to revel a in six nine through eleven see she's made herself ready how is she ready she's born again baptized with the Holy Ghost praise God revelation 6:9 and when I opened the fifth seal these are the Jewish seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held not for the testimony of Jesus Christ just for the word of God the Old Testament and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true that's not dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them where are they given white robes that in heaven why because they didn't get on earth because I didn't know Jesus Christ but we get it on earth if we know Jesus Christ now amen glory see the Jews are given white robes later they're given eternal life but the Bible said go Jesus I go to Jerusalem until your clothes with the power from on high the righteousness of saints hallelujah amen Superman said see they're given eternal life which are of course he says is eternal life which is white robes how many believe that now go to second Corinthians five will prove it here right in the word sing Corinthians five verse 1 this is what I was saying earlier once this body of flesh drops or you know in death or gets swallowed up in life at the rapture then my voice will not be just my voice won't be a human voice it'll be a divine voice I won't be making just human carnal comments I'll only speak what eternal life would speak that's what I always desire I joke too much I get in the flesh too much now I'm too carnal I make mistakes but when I get that new body no more mistakes amen I'm just a lie I'm a pure reflection at all reflection of the life of Jesus amen yeah first one sacred there's five one four we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God I love it a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens ha ha ha I've got eternal body in heaven waiting for me amen glory for in this we groan see we're going now in our earthly bottles everybody's earnestly desiring to be clothed appalled with our house which is from heaven clothed see the clothing see Paul saying your soul is going to be clothed with an eternal body it's eternal life right now verse 3 if so be that being clothed we should not be found naked now what's he saying a soul is naked without eternal life right so like that rich man that died the Bible said Jesus gave the parable and he's carried down to hell right by the Angels he must have been a naked soul there have been no eternal life right and he goes off you know to Hell where he's tormented he must is so must have went there naked somehow I don't know what that looks like I have no idea but Paul says we don't want to be found naked if by this oh we won't ever so clothed in the righteousness of Christ a head glory a then verse 4 for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed the part that mortality might be swallowed up of life amen see we're growing and we're designed for the whole thing the whole body to have eternal life we're groaning for that but the soul has already got it if it's born again well that's right verse 5 now he either hath wrought us for the self same thing is God who has also also given unto us the earnest of the Spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him amen and that the truth whether or no matter where we are we just want to be accepted by God for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad see that's why Paul says I'm willing to beat this body under subjection because I'm gonna be paid back for whatever I let this body do amen right we want to bring this body into full obedience to the Holy Spirit now so can everybody see that Paul says we're groaning to have eternal life that glorified body but the Bible says your soul is already walking with the white garment on so let's read that let's go to Revelation chapter 3 verse 4 it's available to us right now Church and really as we said Sunday if you've got a soul of power if you got power in your soul you'll live the doctrine of Christ you'll live the life because it's right here in the scripture revelation 3 for now has a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments huh see and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy see making the right decisions just making the right decisions makes you worthy of gods of God's rewards praise the Lord see Jesus says right there it's a red letters they've not defiled their garments now Sardis was Martin Luther's age so he must've been one of those Holy Ghost field saints that was walking even though he smoked and drank he didn't know better he he must had his garment there that was not defiled or maybe he repent that in his life we don't know I don't know and they shall walk with me in white the sea church our souls either got clothing right or they're naked and Jesus there's going to be some of them that walk with me in white amen they go to verse 5 for he that overcometh the same shall not be clothed I'm sorry the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name on the book of life and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels praise God now go to revelation 3:18 this is our age I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that makes me rich and white raiment see he's offering it again right to Church ages later he's still offering this white raiment hey head out of the area and white raiment now mayor's be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear amen they go to revelation 7 verse 13 and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are waiting arrayed in white robes and whence came they and I said to him Sir thou knowest he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb Amen praise God I know ya see God is somehow he's given us garments and we have the choice to take those garments to the cleaners or not amen and our cleaners is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's man oh yeah I take I take a lot I take all my clothes to the cleaners I just go there and drop him off but somebody else washes him but in the spiritual the Bible said that they took their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb praise God amen see it'd be foolish for me to come up here and preach and I got all the stains of Genevieve throwing her food on my pants on Sunday I'd be foolish that could up here all dirty like that I've got to take my garments to be washed and the same thing is true in a judgment it'd be foolish to know you're condemned for lying or stealing or lusting or committing evil or murdering it'd be foolish to try to appear before God dirty so that's why Jesus invites everybody to come and receive a me why that you may be closed amen that the shame of your nakedness do not appear just dip in this run and this blood will clean everything off your garments amen glory and that's what we have tonight we have a chance tonight to bring our garments and dip them in the blood of Jesus Christ amen and the angel said do you know who these aren't John's like I don't know these are the ones that went to the the Lamb of God dry cleaners if you ever started dry cleaning business Lydia call it the Lamb of God dry cleaners it would be the cleanest garments ever get some organic soap or something like that but that's what that's what the Bible says in the Bible gives us that picture they made them white in the blood of lamb they made the choice to take their dirty clothes the dirty government's to the dry cleaners I've said to the cleaners and they made them white in the blood of the Lamb and God said because you did that now you've got eternal life praise God so what does white raiment what is fine linen clean and white represent the righteousness of saints where does it come from from Jesus Christ now go back to sin curtains five because it just kind of came back to me this are real from era scripture but need to we need to have it here to kind of pinch the nail down here this is the sticker in these five yeah yeah yeah now this is this is a good portion here I'm gonna close with this because it's already 8:30 okay I'm gonna cause of this let's go to verse 14 sankirtan is 5:14 all this beautiful chapter my goodness this is perfect this just ties it all together this chapter right here ties this teaching on the righteousness of saints as eternal life as white garments or white raiment verse 14 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto Him which died for them and rose again I mean living for Christ tonight you're here because you want to live for Christ yes wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh so see Paul saying I don't look at people's flesh I look at what's behind the flesh I look and see as there is their soul right with God see yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more see the bodies up in heaven we don't know Christ after his fleshly body we know him after the spirit verse 17 therefore if any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things have passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ has given to us the Ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ not a second person the first person was in Christ amen reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation see so just as we can claim that Christ is not going to give me what we did what I deserve we can tell it to other people even though you're down even though you're distressed even though you're discouraged even though you feel guilty God has given us the Ministry of reconciliation God's not going to give you what you deserve because you're trusting that Christ paid the price for your sins see that's the Ministry of reconciliation he's not imputing your trespasses unto you he forgave you of them he took the punishment of it if you'll put confidence in his sacrifice ah this religion is the best religion there everyone's amen glory amen thank you Jesus God reconciled us to himself praise God verse 20 now then we are the ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled to God amen in Christ that in Christ place be reconciled to God verse 21 free ëthe made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made what the righteous of God in him to stand in that beautiful when Jesus was made sin he took our sin remember that was that divine transfer remember that perpetuation that's what it means Christ became our wrath taker all of our wrath was put on Christ which means all of Christ's righteous was put on us amen that's the exchange innocent for guilty this is God's way to save and what does it mean it means the bride has made herself ready she's recognized Jesus is offering me his righteousness for my unrighteousness and all I've got to do is go to the fountain filled with blood and say Jesus I'm sorry forgive me cleanse me and I said like this cleanse all of me sanctify all of me that you can fill me with the Holy Ghost that I got wash all my garments amen and let me be clear with power from on high okay let's sing Jesus Messiah praise God he became sin that knew no sin now hope that helps and I want to take I kind of felt led that was gonna be as I was preparing I kind of felt led that was gonna be the main thought for the night that though the righteousness of saints is the white garment how could anybody see that in the Word of God oh it's all the way through there hope everybody can see that that right now church we can have white garments we can walk with Christ in white praise the Lord praise God despite our mistakes that despite our failures it can be washed away when we say forgive me Lord I'm confessing it I was wrong I was guilty make me innocent forgive me praise God in other words justify me praise God declare me righteous Amen that's the thought I want to bring out and as I said we can go through all the patriarchs how they fell short of the glory of God God still forgave them not still forgave each one of them and God will forgive us tonight nice grace praise God let's just take a moment and meditate on that I'm just gonna shut this down here praise God praise God thank you Jesus oh my [Music] Church all heaven all heaven the Angels the beasts the elders they're all glad and rejoice and give honour to Jesus because they're his bride stands she's made herself ready and she's clothed in white garments and he said they're the blessed ones they're called to the marriage supper of the Lamb he said these are the true sayings of God I'm thankful that God called you to that wedding they'll usually invitations real small but we received a pretty big invitation glory usually it's just like a front in the back of the invitation but God so one to prove it to you he gave me the thickest invitation ever was this is the invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb aren't you glad your call praise God praise God let's have a word of Prayer here if there's anything you need to confess in your heart I'm thankful was there for me couple weeks ago when I needed it I just share that as an example Church that I I got the flesh I laughed at something that was awful and yet the blood of Christ was available to me glory I just think if I would not a repentant Church that woman might not have gotten her eyes healed because Moran says like akin sin will keep others from getting the victory hallelujah let's just pray here if there's anything we need to confess let's just trust in the saving righteousness of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we just bow our heads we come reverently thank you for this scripture tonight Lord God who she's made herself ready she's got garments on Lord clean and white which are the righteousness of saints Oh God Nord I just pray for your people those lives trimming those here I think of those working tonight like sister Connie bang and amen or they're working Taniya but Lord here we are - Lord I pray for each person Lord that if they need to they'll go to that fountain tonight dear God hallelujah thank you Jesus it's open it's a fountain open is fill of blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins Lord and Lord the beautiful thing is there's no cost except the death to our selfishness pain ahead sorry the only price to pay is death to ourselves amen hallelujah confession operating for the things of the world it's only price there is to pay leaving our old state of sin and going to the fountain that's filled with blood oh thank you Jesus thank you Lord for that fountain it was there for few weeks ago it's there for me tonight hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus
