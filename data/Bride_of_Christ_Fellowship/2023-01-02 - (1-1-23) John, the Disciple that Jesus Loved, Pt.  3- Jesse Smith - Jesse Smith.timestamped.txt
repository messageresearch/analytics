[7:26] here tonight by God's grace
[7:31] thank you sorry about that thank you
[7:33] let's read that on three ready one two
[7:36] three now there was leaning on Jesus
[7:39] bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus
[7:42] loved praise God let's have one more
[7:44] word of Prayer
[7:45] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[7:46] opportunity Lord here we are to worship
[7:48] and bow down and say that you're our God
[7:50] we thank you for these songs of Love
[7:52] Lord you really love us Lord God we
[7:54] thank you for your love and compassion
[7:55] the enemy tries to constantly say you
[7:57] don't but Lord we know your word is true
[7:59] dear God we thank you that you are
[8:01] faithful Lord to prove it to us over and
[8:04] over again Lord you keep proving your
[8:06] love and we thank you Lord for that for
[8:08] Lord without that Lord we we might to
[8:10] question it Lord we might have have
[8:12] struggles but Lord you help us overcome
[8:14] Lord God you said you'd never leave us
[8:16] nor forsake us and we thank you God for
[8:18] these constant reminders Lord as we've
[8:19] seen that song remind me Who I Am Lord
[8:21] we're thankful that the word of God
[8:23] reminds us who we are today we're your
[8:25] beloved so father take this word now
[8:27] bless it to your people in Jesus
[8:28] Christ's name and the Saints said amen
[8:31] God bless you as you're being seated
[8:32] praise God
[8:37] so I'd like to got some scriptures to
[8:40] show here by God's grace I'd like to
[8:41] just continue this thought here
[8:43] just want to review Parts uh one and two
[8:45] very very quickly I want to be mindful
[8:47] of the time too I know everybody's tired
[8:49] you know from uh the weekend here so
[8:52] um
[8:54] just want to be mindful of the time by
[8:56] God's grace here so
[8:58] I thought I'd rather preach this rather
[8:59] than do a Bible study just kind of like
[9:01] a little bit more free when I preach you
[9:02] know I feel a little bit more freedom
[9:04] so
[9:06] you know we would like we looked at this
[9:07] here uh earlier this year you know and
[9:09] these are basically some of the reviews
[9:10] from uh the first few parts you know
[9:13] there's five scriptures that say the
[9:15] disciple whom Jesus loved and of course
[9:17] is speaking of John
[9:19] uh that's there's John
[9:21] again
[9:23] um but remember the scripture said Jesus
[9:24] loves all his disciples and his sisters
[9:27] and all the brothers all the sisters and
[9:29] and God's love cannot be questioned
[9:31] right it's it's not God's love really
[9:33] that's in question it's our love for God
[9:35] that's in question right because our
[9:37] love wavers God's love never wavers
[9:40] and you know we saw the gifts of Peter
[9:43] James and John you know uh there were
[9:45] three gifts that God could use Jesus
[9:47] used them on numerous occasions to
[9:48] minister to needs it's not that Jesus
[9:51] loved them more but they were gifted in
[9:53] certain ways where only God God can only
[9:56] do things through their gifts it's just
[9:58] like brother Branham you know God can
[9:59] only do certain things through brother
[10:00] Brown's gifts right discernment son of
[10:03] man prophecy like if you're not called
[10:05] to be a prophet you're not going to have
[10:06] with us saith the Lord come out of you
[10:08] right you know so you know just the fact
[10:11] that Peter James and John were together
[10:12] didn't make them more loved it just
[10:14] means they had a certain commission from
[10:16] God
[10:17] and God is impartial of course you know
[10:20] he's impartial but he does reward the
[10:22] faithful comers the faithful worshipers
[10:24] praise God God is not a respecter of
[10:26] persons his love is towards all praise
[10:28] God all who will receive him
[10:32] and God loved job despite job's
[10:34] sufferings
[10:36] his love was was manifest despite all of
[10:40] job's sufferings and then we saw how we
[10:43] ought to be thankful for God's love and
[10:45] uh the the whole reason John called
[10:48] himself the disciple whom loved because
[10:49] he had identified himself as the object
[10:52] of God's love and each one of us can
[10:55] take that attitude here tonight I am the
[10:57] object of God's love praise God God
[11:00] loves me
[11:01] and uh you know I'm always reminded this
[11:04] quote you know the cloudy skies and the
[11:05] storms of life are no signs of God's
[11:07] disapproval neither are the bright skies
[11:09] and Still Waters signs of his love and
[11:12] approval
[11:13] his approval of any of us is only in the
[11:15] Beloved his love is elective which he
[11:18] had for us before the foundation of the
[11:20] world remember the Bible said we're
[11:21] chosen in Christ
[11:23] so we were chosen in love because God is
[11:26] love Christ is love so we were chosen in
[11:29] love Hallelujah
[11:30] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[11:33] know we shall know because he said so
[11:35] and manifested that he did love us for
[11:38] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[11:41] his Spirit placing us as Sons
[11:44] and how shall I prove my love to him by
[11:46] believing what he said and by conducting
[11:48] myself with joy amidst the trials that
[11:51] he and his wisdom allows to come to pass
[11:53] amen so I just you know I actually have
[11:56] eight I thought of another right before
[11:58] I was coming out I didn't have a chance
[12:00] to type it up here but there's at least
[12:01] eight proofs of love God's love there's
[12:03] actually probably you know innumerable
[12:05] numbers but just briefly the first proof
[12:08] is Christ's death
[12:09] the fact that all history has to
[12:11] acknowledge Jesus died
[12:13] whether they say he was the son of God
[12:15] or not they all have to admit he was a
[12:18] man and he walked this Earth and that he
[12:20] died but the Bible said God proves his
[12:23] love toward us and that while we were
[12:24] yet sinners Christ died for us much more
[12:28] than being now justified by his blood we
[12:30] shall be saved from wrath through him
[12:33] praise God so God proved his love by
[12:35] letting Christ die we know John 3 16 for
[12:38] God so loved the world
[12:40] that he gave his only begotten son so
[12:42] because he loved he gave and because we
[12:45] love we should give of ourselves whether
[12:47] in service and the Bible says don't let
[12:49] us just love in word only but in indeed
[12:51] as well praise God help us to love in
[12:54] word and deed so that's the first proof
[12:56] is his death second is there's nothing
[12:58] that can separate us from this love
[13:01] that's another proof you know the Bible
[13:03] said death life Angels principalities
[13:06] Powers things present things to come
[13:08] uh height depth any other creature will
[13:12] be able to separate us from the love of
[13:13] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[13:16] praise God and you see this in the
[13:18] apostles life no matter what they went
[13:20] through they still had the love of God
[13:22] Amen
[13:23] see so so see there's nothing that can
[13:25] ever separate us from the love of God no
[13:27] matter what trials we go through nothing
[13:29] will be able to separate us God's love
[13:31] is eternal it's abiding Hallelujah uh
[13:34] it's immovable praise God and nothing
[13:36] can separate us from the love of God
[13:39] number three
[13:40] like this is hezekiah's prayer Hezekiah
[13:43] said the fact that he was saved from
[13:45] death
[13:46] proved God loved him
[13:48] Austin was talking about almost a car
[13:50] accident he got into last week Malachi
[13:52] and I almost got into car accident a few
[13:53] days ago God was gracious to us remember
[13:55] he stepped out okay
[13:58] but the very fact God saved you
[14:00] from an untimely death shows that God
[14:03] loves you
[14:04] he said behold for peace I had great
[14:06] bitterness but thou in love to my soul
[14:10] delivered it from the pit of corruption
[14:12] for thou has cast all my sins behind thy
[14:15] back amen not only does he save our
[14:17] natural life he saves our spiritual life
[14:19] amen
[14:21] by sending all of our sins away
[14:23] so if you can think of any time God
[14:25] saved your life that was his love to you
[14:28] number four he guarantees this love will
[14:31] never he'll never leave us or forsake us
[14:33] right and every believer can recognize
[14:36] this God has never left us God has never
[14:39] forsaken us
[14:40] despite your sins despite our
[14:42] shortcomings God will still answer
[14:43] prayer God will still show you favor God
[14:46] will still show you good things praise
[14:48] God
[14:49] despite like us not deserving it he
[14:52] guaranteed it I'll never leave you nor
[14:54] forsake you praise God that has to be
[14:55] love hallelujah it's a proof of God's
[14:57] love
[14:58] even even Jesus said you know how the
[15:01] father sends rain on the just and the
[15:03] unjust he's good unto The Sinner and the
[15:06] saint praise God that proves God is a
[15:08] loving God Amen
[15:10] amen for people that don't deserve it he
[15:11] still sends rain he still gives food he
[15:13] still gives Sunshine he still gives
[15:15] healing he even heals the sinners and so
[15:18] his this is a guarantee he never leave
[15:19] us nor forsake us a fourth proof that he
[15:22] loves us
[15:23] number five he promises to correct us he
[15:26] won't let us go through life without
[15:28] showing us where we need help
[15:30] as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and
[15:33] be zealous therefore and repent I love
[15:35] this along with this idea he corrects us
[15:37] he comes and fellowships with us
[15:39] right he tells us to open the door he'll
[15:42] come and he'll he'll sup with us the
[15:44] Bible says and he with me
[15:47] a great sign even after mistakes even
[15:50] after your shortcomings God will still
[15:51] come and love us and spend time with us
[15:54] even though we don't deserve it
[15:56] a great sign of God's love number six
[15:59] the fact that he lets us experience
[16:01] salvation of the fact that he lets us
[16:03] feel like we were dead but now alive
[16:05] that shows his love for us the fact that
[16:08] we get to experience salvation the fact
[16:10] that we can feel the burden of sin roll
[16:12] away
[16:13] the fact that we can feel uh refreshed
[16:16] amen hallelujah is God's love to us
[16:18] because the Bible said God who's rich in
[16:20] Mercy for his great love wherein he hath
[16:23] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[16:24] hath quickened us together with Christ
[16:27] by grace are you saved and has raised us
[16:30] up and made us sit together in Heavenly
[16:32] places in Christ Jesus if we've ever
[16:35] felt God's anointing if we've ever felt
[16:37] God's love if we've ever felt God's
[16:39] accepted us then it was God's great love
[16:41] that did it for us
[16:44] number seven he actually calls us his
[16:46] beloved
[16:48] uh speaking of Jeremiah 31 3 the Lord
[16:50] hath appeared of old unto me saying yea
[16:53] I have loved thee with an Everlasting
[16:55] Love Therefore with loving kindness have
[16:57] I drawn thee so just as God Drew Israel
[17:00] just as God brought Israel unto himself
[17:03] so God brings us unto him Hallelujah you
[17:07] didn't the Bible said you didn't really
[17:08] go looking for God God came looking for
[17:10] you
[17:11] praise God so the fact that that God
[17:14] Drew you to himself the fact that the
[17:16] message came to find you amen or you're
[17:19] born into it amen
[17:20] either way the message came to find you
[17:22] it found your parents praise God right
[17:24] so God at some point came in other words
[17:27] some generation had to rise out of sin
[17:29] and some generation had to stand up and
[17:30] say I know God loves me I believe this
[17:32] word I'm standing on the word of God
[17:34] Amen
[17:35] look an everlasting love he's loved us
[17:39] with an everlasting love
[17:42] and then I love you know Romans 9 is
[17:43] what I quote my prayer closet like I
[17:45] told you uh the Bible specifically says
[17:48] God loves the Gentiles and he saith also
[17:51] in Hosea I will call them my people
[17:52] which were not my people and her beloved
[17:55] which was not beloved and it shall come
[17:58] to pass that in the place where it was
[18:00] said unto them year not my people there
[18:02] shall they be called the children of the
[18:04] Living God aren't you glad you're a
[18:05] child of God Amen you're more than a
[18:07] child of your parents or you're more
[18:09] than a child a a product of of the
[18:11] educational system of America you're
[18:13] more than American Hallelujah you're a
[18:15] child of God hallelujah
[18:18] he says these are my beloved I
[18:20] specifically call them they're my
[18:22] beloved people now number eight is God
[18:24] set his love on us
[18:27] uh so I I guess I can go there
[18:29] Deuteronomy uh seven seven
[18:33] maybe I can pull it up here
[18:35] yeah I guess I got it right there that's
[18:37] gonna be hard to see
[18:39] uh Deuteronomy 7 7 let me do the view
[18:41] here
[18:47] now why this is uh applicable to us
[18:50] we'll see in just a moment
[18:52] God's speaking to Moses to tell Israel
[18:54] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[18:57] so God has God has placed his love where
[19:00] it's God's love is aimed at you
[19:02] hallelujah it's set on you like there's
[19:05] a certain path coming down from heaven
[19:06] and that and that I set my love on
[19:08] brother amen and Sisterhood like I I set
[19:10] my love on us and Elena praise God you
[19:12] know I can put each one of your names in
[19:14] there God said it it's aimed right at
[19:16] you praise God
[19:18] he nor excuse you because you were more
[19:20] a number than any people for you were
[19:21] the fewest of all people but because the
[19:23] Lord loved you and because he would keep
[19:25] the oath which he had sworn on your
[19:26] father's hath the Lord brought you out
[19:29] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[19:32] of the house of bondman for the hand of
[19:34] pharaoh king of Egypt so this links back
[19:36] to Abraham the fathers of the faith
[19:38] right
[19:39] so God loved Israel because he loved
[19:41] their fathers but the Bible says you're
[19:43] a child of Abraham Hallelujah in
[19:46] Galatians 3 verse 7 know ye therefore
[19:48] they which are of Faith the same are the
[19:51] children of Abraham
[19:52] so see you have to be one that God has
[19:55] set his love on because you're a child
[19:57] of Abraham and God said I chose you I
[20:00] love you because I set my love on your
[20:02] fathers so you can so you God loves you
[20:05] because you're a child of Abraham
[20:06] Hallelujah
[20:08] so right there is eight reasons
[20:10] undeniable proof that God loves you
[20:12] praise God
[20:16] let me find my yeah notes every
[20:18] like I said I'm going to try not to be
[20:20] too long here tonight now going back to
[20:22] John John is a type of the Jew Gentile
[20:25] bride so the fact that John leans Upon
[20:28] Jesus bosom we can look at that and say
[20:30] that's the disciple that that types us
[20:32] we want to be that disciple because he
[20:35] was so he was so dedicated to Jesus he
[20:38] was constantly leaning on his bosom
[20:40] right and the closest Fellowship right I
[20:42] mean as his two brothers Jesus and John
[20:45] as two men you can't get any more close
[20:47] than that praise God if a man just
[20:49] leaning in your bosom and you know he's
[20:51] just gonna be right there you're just
[20:52] going to be close to your heart praise
[20:54] God and so John is this a type of this
[20:57] disciple who wants to be near the heart
[20:59] of Christ
[21:00] right and that's why we want to be uh
[21:02] like David a man after God's Own Heart
[21:04] so John is a beautiful example of that
[21:06] in the New Testament how he was one to
[21:09] be so much with Jesus he leaned on his
[21:11] bosom
[21:12] wasn't enough to be around him he had to
[21:14] be right up in his heart amen oh thank
[21:16] God let us be in the heart of God Amen
[21:19] Hallelujah now he's a type of the Bride
[21:21] because of Revelation 4 verse 1.
[21:24] so I'm going to just read these briefly
[21:28] because the seven Church ages are in
[21:30] Revelation chapter two and three and
[21:32] then in Revelation 4 1
[21:34] and after this I looked and behold a
[21:37] door was opened in heaven in the first
[21:38] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[21:41] trumpet talking with me which said come
[21:43] up hither and I will show thee things
[21:44] which must be hereafter
[21:46] so in other words right after the church
[21:47] ages and John gets raptured right to see
[21:51] things that are in heaven so that's a
[21:53] type of the church the church goes
[21:55] through seven Church ages after the
[21:56] laodiceem the church goes up to heaven
[21:59] Hallelujah there's a door open in heaven
[22:01] and then in Revelation 10 8 through 11
[22:04] John eats a book
[22:07] but he just doesn't eat it for himself
[22:09] the Bible said go and take the little
[22:10] book which is open the hand of the Angel
[22:12] which sinneth upon the sea and upon the
[22:14] Earth
[22:16] and I'm gonna go down to verse 11. he
[22:18] said to me thou must prophesy again
[22:20] before many peoples and Nations and
[22:21] tongues and Kings so John represents
[22:24] someone in the end time when the seals
[22:26] are broken who eats the word of God and
[22:29] then prophesies it to the Gentile
[22:30] Nations so this speaks of a gentile
[22:33] Ministry praise God and that's us
[22:36] also uh the the fact John's gospel is
[22:40] the fourth gospel that represents the
[22:42] force the fourth Beast which is the
[22:44] eagle so I got a picture of that
[22:47] so John's John's John is the fourth book
[22:50] Matthew Mark Luke John and the fourth
[22:53] beast that's mentioned is the eagle
[22:55] and it's one of those four beasts that
[22:57] surround the throne
[22:59] praise God
[23:01] and of course the eagle anointing was
[23:04] for the end time because Eagle
[23:05] represents a Seer a prophet right
[23:08] Jehovah Likens himself unto an eagle I
[23:11] bear Israel Out On Eagle's Wings I mean
[23:14] I got a YouTube video on that where
[23:15] Moses and Aaron are like it under those
[23:17] wings of an eagle praise God where God
[23:20] draws God brings out his people On
[23:22] Eagle's Wings and God is a spirit and
[23:24] God is the father of Prophecy Hallelujah
[23:26] the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[23:29] of Prophecy praise God so we can see
[23:31] here how how John types this Jew Gentile
[23:34] Church
[23:36] okay and also the fact he leaned on
[23:38] Jesus's bosom
[23:40] uh the fact that he wanted to be in
[23:42] close proximity uh to all the other uh
[23:45] I'm sorry to Christ more so it seems
[23:48] than all the other disciples he wanted
[23:49] to be right in the bosom of Christ
[23:51] praise God now I don't have time for all
[23:53] this but there's eight women in chapter
[23:55] four of my 2021 book there's eight Old
[23:57] Testament women that typed this Jew
[23:59] Gentile bride as well
[24:01] you have Rebecca as anath Sarah I mean
[24:04] you can just go on and on Solomon's
[24:06] bride you have all these all these types
[24:10] um and so we we see John as one of those
[24:13] types he's the disciple whom Jesus loved
[24:15] praise God he recognized himself as as
[24:18] one that Jesus loved and I want to skip
[24:20] ahead now
[24:22] um to more of John's verses here's where
[24:24] I left off when I when I gave that uh
[24:27] when I gave that sermon about God's love
[24:29] for brother Austin I got left off at
[24:31] this part here I was showing how when
[24:33] John wrote his book the book of First
[24:35] John
[24:36] he used the word love many many times
[24:40] and so the Bible said whoever keeps the
[24:42] word of God God's love will be made
[24:45] perfect in you
[24:46] see Church you know you'll grow in God's
[24:48] love if you just obey the word of God
[24:51] you don't have to worry am I going to
[24:52] love God more in 2023 yeah because I'm
[24:54] going to keep the word of God
[24:56] I mean it's a promise
[24:58] if you keep God's word you grow in God's
[25:00] love
[25:02] he that loveth his brother abides in the
[25:04] light and there's no occasion of
[25:06] something in him hallelujah how do I
[25:09] know I'm walking in the light I'm I'm
[25:10] confessing my sins and loving my
[25:12] brothers
[25:15] love not the world neither the things
[25:16] are in the world if any man loved the
[25:18] world the love of the father is not in
[25:19] them so we have to make sure we do not
[25:21] love the world
[25:22] we've got to make sure we love the word
[25:24] of God because he that do is the word
[25:25] the word of God abides forever amen
[25:29] the Bible said what manner of love the
[25:31] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[25:33] should be called the sons of God Amen I
[25:35] just showed you eight reasons God loves
[25:37] you and then John says what I mean what
[25:39] kind of love is this that we get to be
[25:41] called sons of God hallelujah
[25:43] therefore the world doesn't know us
[25:46] right our families persecute us right
[25:47] brother Chris you know Sinners
[25:49] persecutives people mock us because they
[25:52] don't know God if they knew God they
[25:54] would love God and love us praise God
[25:58] but what amazing love God has for us
[26:00] that we can be called the children of
[26:02] God
[26:03] amen
[26:05] the Bible said whosoever born of is born
[26:07] of God does not commit sin for his sin
[26:10] remain I'm sorry seed remains in him and
[26:12] he cannot sin because he's born of God
[26:16] so I want to look at this more in
[26:17] another sermon I want to look at that
[26:19] thought of how brother Graham said your
[26:20] soul never did it in the first place I
[26:22] want to look at that thought later on
[26:23] not today but I want to get to that
[26:25] thought eventually
[26:28] so this is the great a paradox right
[26:30] between the soul and the spirit this is
[26:31] where I was ending the last time I
[26:34] preached on this
[26:35] kind of on this thought
[26:37] the Bible says we must confess our sins
[26:39] if we don't confess our sins we're Liars
[26:42] but then the Bible says your soul never
[26:44] sinned to begin with
[26:46] so it's a great Paradox you have a part
[26:48] of you that's never sinned that's why in
[26:49] some songs we can Rejoice because part
[26:52] of us has never sinned but then other
[26:55] songs talk about the struggle with sin
[26:57] and overcoming sin and how we need those
[27:00] songs too praise God
[27:02] we have sermons where we emphasize God's
[27:04] great love and and how how God chose us
[27:07] before the foundation world but then we
[27:09] have sermons where we have to emphasize
[27:10] the struggle with sin and constantly
[27:12] confessing sin and dying out to self
[27:14] right mortifying uh your flesh right
[27:17] because it's a paradox you and I are
[27:20] paradoxes we have a part of us that's
[27:22] never sinned and then two part of us has
[27:24] constantly sinned
[27:28] and then this is the message God gave
[27:30] that we should love one another you say
[27:31] I believe the message what's the message
[27:33] love one another
[27:35] if you if you ask them if somebody asked
[27:37] you what is the message and said what
[27:39] does the Bible say the message is the
[27:41] Bible said God is light and we love one
[27:43] another
[27:44] yeah Hallelujah
[27:47] yeah exactly right that's good brother
[27:50] yeah we call ourselves message churches
[27:52] well the Bible has to Define what is the
[27:54] message
[27:55] the message is God is light there's no
[27:57] darkness in God right we have the light
[27:58] of God and the message is we should love
[28:01] one another
[28:02] now we know there's many other ways to
[28:03] say it the revelation of the word the
[28:05] restoration of the message the
[28:06] restoration of the Bible but if you just
[28:08] looked up the word message the message
[28:09] is God is light and we're to love one
[28:12] another praise God in other words God is
[28:13] light and then we are God's children and
[28:15] we show the light of God as well
[28:18] Hallelujah
[28:20] now that's where we stopped and then I
[28:21] did the Austin love to the Lord
[28:23] I also put Jesse love the Lord in there
[28:25] too
[28:26] and you should put your own name in
[28:27] there as well
[28:28] now we know now here are some more
[28:30] scriptures we know we pass from death
[28:32] into life why because we love the
[28:34] brother
[28:35] so that's a good sign you are born again
[28:36] when you love God's people
[28:39] he that loveth not his brother abides in
[28:41] death
[28:42] and that's that scripture that says some
[28:44] people are dead while they're alive
[28:46] right so that's where people get that's
[28:48] where the world gets the zombie idea
[28:50] right they get zombies this idea from
[28:53] the scripture because the Bible says if
[28:54] someone's not a Christian they're dead
[28:56] while they're alive
[28:58] right their soul is dead while their
[29:01] bodies alive oh but with us we've got a
[29:03] living soul and a living body praise God
[29:05] hallelujah
[29:08] my little children here's what I was
[29:10] saying earlier let us not love in word
[29:12] neither in tongue but in deed in truth
[29:15] again remember it doesn't it doesn't do
[29:17] anything for us to say
[29:19] we can help somebody unless we actually
[29:21] act upon it and help someone
[29:23] praise God just saying nice things isn't
[29:26] good enough we've got to have actions
[29:27] behind our words
[29:29] I'm trying to watch my time here
[29:32] he that keepeth his Commandments dwells
[29:34] in him
[29:36] and he in him praise God
[29:38] so the more we obey God's word the more
[29:40] we'll feel his presence abiding in our
[29:42] lives Hallelujah
[29:47] now first John 4 7-21 uses the word over
[29:51] love over 12 times
[29:53] this is jam-packed full of love so I'm
[29:55] going to read it right now if you have
[29:56] your Bible you can go there with me if
[29:57] you want to read along if not you just
[29:58] listen and say Amen
[30:00] that's option two first John 4 7.
[30:05] let's talk about a love chapter brother
[30:06] I mean we think we talk about First
[30:08] Corinthians 13 that's true but here is
[30:11] also another love chapter verse seven
[30:13] beloved let us love one another for God
[30:15] is of love I'm sorry for love is of God
[30:17] and everyone that loveth is born of God
[30:19] and knoweth God
[30:21] he that loveth not knoweth not God for
[30:23] God is love
[30:26] and this was manifested the love of God
[30:28] toward us because that God sent his only
[30:30] begotten son into the world that we
[30:32] might live through him
[30:33] here in his love not that we love God so
[30:37] our love for God isn't the real love of
[30:38] God right but he that loved us and sent
[30:41] his son to be the propitiation for our
[30:43] sins so our love is not the greatest
[30:45] love God's love is the greatest love
[30:49] beloved if God so loved us we are also
[30:51] to love one another
[30:53] verse 12 no man has seen God at any time
[30:56] if we love one another God dwelleth in
[30:58] us and his love is perfected in US
[31:00] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[31:03] he and us because he hath given us of
[31:05] his spirit
[31:07] and we have seen and do testify that the
[31:09] father sent the son to be the savior of
[31:10] the world whosoever shall confess that
[31:13] Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in
[31:15] him and he and God and we have known and
[31:17] believed the love that God hath to us
[31:20] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[31:23] dwelleth in God and God in him oh so
[31:27] important to love amen
[31:29] when you love God is with you and in you
[31:31] and everyone knows you're a Christian
[31:33] praise God
[31:35] again hearing is our love made perfect
[31:37] that we may have boldness in the day of
[31:38] judgment because as he is so are we in
[31:42] this world now here's some real mature
[31:43] love right here
[31:45] that when we die we'll be bold
[31:49] we'll be bold knowing I'm going to see
[31:51] Jesus
[31:52] I'm not going to the Grave I'm not going
[31:54] to I'm sorry I'm not I'm not going to
[31:55] Hades or
[31:57] I'm not going to the the prison house
[31:59] and the Heart of the earth I'm going to
[32:00] see Jesus praise God
[32:02] see love produces this confidence amen
[32:04] if you want to be more confident about a
[32:06] Christian walk let's love one another
[32:07] better praise God hallelujah we want
[32:10] more boldness about the Rapture more
[32:12] bonus about our Christian Life we need
[32:14] to love each other better praise God
[32:16] remember God will lead us to that
[32:20] love is the key Love Is The Answer
[32:22] Hallelujah
[32:23] we see it playing in the description I
[32:25] hear Verse 18 beautiful there is no fear
[32:27] in love
[32:29] now this is sinful fear right because we
[32:31] have that we need the fear of the Lord
[32:32] that's that reverence that respect but
[32:34] perfect love casteth out fear because
[32:37] fear hath torments and now you know what
[32:39] the wrong kind of fear is when you're
[32:41] tormented under condemnation from Satan
[32:44] that's the wrong kind of fear but that's
[32:46] different from conviction oh Lord I
[32:48] don't want to do this Lord I need to
[32:49] make this right that's different
[32:51] right
[32:53] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[32:55] love we love him because he first loved
[32:58] us
[32:59] if a man say I love God and hate his
[33:01] brother he's a liar
[33:03] see we can't say oh I'm a message
[33:04] believer I love God and then hate
[33:05] message people
[33:07] right we can't say that
[33:09] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[33:11] he has seen how can he love God whom he
[33:13] hath not seen
[33:14] see we really got to make sure we love
[33:16] who we can see if we can love who we can
[33:19] see we can love who we can't see praise
[33:21] God
[33:21] Hallelujah that's exactly right
[33:24] Hallelujah we have to love who God made
[33:27] and then that proves we love the
[33:28] invisible God
[33:30] the maker of all men
[33:33] verse 21 and this commandment have we
[33:35] from him that he who loveth God love his
[33:39] brother also it's a commandment
[33:42] love God and love his people
[33:44] praise God first John 5 1-5 whosoever
[33:48] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[33:49] born of God and everyone that loveth him
[33:51] that begat loveth him also that is
[33:54] begotten of him
[33:56] that's right brother said the bride
[33:57] won't persecute the bride
[33:59] now does the bride correct the bride yes
[34:01] Paul had to correct Peter right
[34:03] Hallelujah there's numerous examples
[34:06] verse Two by this we know that we love
[34:08] the children of God when we love God and
[34:11] keep his Commandments for this is the
[34:13] love of God that we keep his
[34:14] Commandments and his Commandments are
[34:17] not Grievous for whatsoever is born of
[34:19] God overcometh the world and this is the
[34:21] victory that overcometh the world even
[34:23] our faith and I said verse five so who
[34:25] is he that overcometh the world but he
[34:27] that believeth Jesus is the son of God
[34:29] Amen oh just it's a what a summary of
[34:33] God's love Hallelujah
[34:35] loving others is the proof that we love
[34:38] God
[34:39] Hallelujah so God help us to continue to
[34:41] love one another how are we going to do
[34:42] that this year Hallelujah God help us to
[34:44] do it he will
[34:45] now remember disciples learn to love the
[34:48] Bible is clear about this we're
[34:49] Disciples of Christ because John was the
[34:52] disciple Jesus loved a disciple is a
[34:54] learner
[34:56] Jesus said whosoever doth not bear his
[34:58] cross and come after me cannot be my
[35:00] disciple
[35:02] right
[35:03] so to be a disciple to be a learner of
[35:06] Jesus that's what we all want to be we
[35:08] must take up our cross which cross
[35:10] represents a slow death
[35:12] in other words there's going to be times
[35:13] where it's difficult to love but we're
[35:16] going to crucify that difficult feeling
[35:17] and we're still going to love
[35:19] you okay so now I'm getting down to the
[35:21] real daily life thing okay the everyday
[35:23] life and maybe you may have a hard
[35:25] feeling towards somebody right you may
[35:26] have a hard feeling but you still got to
[35:28] press through that you got to take up
[35:30] the cross and you got to learn how to
[35:32] love even when the person seems
[35:33] unlovable
[35:35] you have to learn to love even when it's
[35:37] hard to love
[35:39] right that's why you're called a
[35:40] disciple
[35:42] that's why it's okay to be angry it's
[35:44] okay to be upset it's okay to struggle
[35:46] because you're still learning how to
[35:48] love
[35:49] you don't love perfectly yet no one
[35:51] loves perfectly except for Christ
[35:54] so see we read all those beautiful
[35:56] scriptures about God love it sounds also
[35:58] good but it comes down to the fact that
[35:59] we've got to learn how to love
[36:02] amen praise God
[36:04] and we will we have to just have to take
[36:06] up the cross we have to die to ourselves
[36:08] and then learn how to love and the
[36:10] church said
[36:11] amen amen I'm almost at half an hour I'm
[36:12] at 28 minutes so just bear with me here
[36:13] by this shall all men know that you're
[36:15] my disciples if you have loved one
[36:17] toward another
[36:18] this is one of the proofs that you're a
[36:21] child of God when you can love each
[36:22] other
[36:23] and then Jesus prays his last prayer
[36:25] with his disciples i in them and that at
[36:28] least you know before uh yeah I think it
[36:30] was his last prayer yeah I in them and
[36:32] thou and me that they may be made
[36:33] perfect in one and that the world may
[36:36] know that thou has set me
[36:38] and has loved them as thou has loved me
[36:41] what a statement
[36:44] Jesus says when the disciples are loving
[36:46] each other everyone's going to know that
[36:48] God loves them just like God loved his
[36:50] son Jesus
[36:52] what a statement what a statement
[36:56] Hallelujah loving other people proves
[36:59] that you're going to be loved like God
[37:01] loved Jesus
[37:03] was it always easy for Jesus no it's
[37:06] always going to easy be easy for you and
[37:07] I no but what we want is we want God's
[37:10] grace to be able to say Lord let thy
[37:12] will be done not my will be done
[37:14] that's the greatest thing we can do is
[37:15] submit our will to Christ
[37:18] Hallelujah verse 26 I have declared unto
[37:21] them thy name and will declare it that
[37:23] the love wherewith thou has loved me may
[37:25] be in them and I in them praise God
[37:28] hallelujah Jesus wants his love to be in
[37:32] us so people can feel the love of Christ
[37:34] through us hallelujah
[37:36] which I as I said numerous times people
[37:38] when they come here they feel the love
[37:40] of God and we've got to keep it that way
[37:41] praise God and I believe we can grow in
[37:43] God's love too I I don't I'm not sure if
[37:46] we're a five-star loved church yet but
[37:48] like I gave that rating last night in
[37:50] other words I always want to leave room
[37:51] for growth praise God
[37:54] I do I do believe that
[37:56] yes and then you know I love this song
[37:58] the one we sang this morning the one you
[38:00] love as soon as I heard that song I love
[38:01] that song
[38:02] and then I started to think about I want
[38:04] to go through some scriptures about that
[38:05] song So if you got your Bibles uh let's
[38:07] I don't have these scriptures up here
[38:09] but
[38:10] when I first heard this song There were
[38:12] some script some parts of the song I was
[38:13] like what I don't understand that but as
[38:15] I started thinking about it I thought
[38:16] this is a song about renewing the joy of
[38:19] salvation
[38:23] so I forgot your Bible go to Psalm 103
[38:25] and maybe I have some readers out there
[38:26] this would be a good time Sunday school
[38:28] kids if you want to read Hallelujah if
[38:30] you missed your chance to read this
[38:31] would be a good chance to read Psalm 103
[38:33] verse 8. I saw Haven's eyes light up
[38:36] doing reedhaven I tried to read the
[38:38] faces you know do I wouldn't
[38:40] are you looking at me like I want to
[38:41] read or don't don't call on me
[38:43] which is okay you don't have to read it
[38:45] Psalms 103 verse 8.
[38:50] yeah I love this song
[38:53] I was trying to work some Jesus into it
[38:55] you know the name of Jesus into it
[38:57] still gotta work on that
[39:00] um
[39:00] but the song says I can be real with you
[39:02] and say anything and not be afraid so I
[39:05] take an eternal perspective with that
[39:07] this is a song for the the redeemed
[39:09] right
[39:11] and the reason I say that it has to be
[39:13] Eternal perspective because even Paul
[39:15] blasphemed Jesus
[39:17] but Paul didn't know Jesus was the
[39:19] Messiah
[39:21] after he knew Jesus was the Messiah he
[39:23] never blessed him in him again
[39:25] right
[39:28] uh so Psalm 103 verse 8 Haven during the
[39:31] read uh eight
[39:34] I'm sorry three I'm sorry sorry eight
[39:36] and eight to twelve I'll read eight to
[39:37] twelve
[40:08] hey man can we can we hear a more
[40:10] beautiful scripture I mean it's our
[40:11] related to forgiveness
[40:14] could you hear a more beautiful
[40:15] scripture God is merciful he's slow to
[40:17] anger God don't get quickly angry with
[40:19] you right away whoa you had one mistake
[40:20] today I'm angry with it that's not God
[40:23] right
[40:24] he has not given us what we deserve
[40:27] Hallelujah
[40:29] and as high as Heaven is above the Earth
[40:32] so great is his Mercy toward the end of
[40:34] fear oh you can really make you can
[40:37] really go far from the earth the heavens
[40:38] go really far from the Earth
[40:41] light years and the church said this
[40:44] shows God's Mercy is light years
[40:47] working for us
[40:50] it's working so far from us or so so
[40:52] it's working so far to us right you all
[40:54] the way up to Heaven's Throne it works
[40:56] all the way God's Mercy is so great it's
[40:58] so massive and expansive praise God
[41:00] makes us love the Lord even more
[41:03] verse 12 as far as the East is from the
[41:06] West so complete opposites right that's
[41:08] how far God has sent away his sins from
[41:11] you praise God
[41:12] as far as they can possibly be God's
[41:14] completely separated completely forgiven
[41:17] his great love he's a father who loves
[41:19] his children praise God
[41:21] lady do you want to read 13 uh through
[41:24] 16.
[41:42] amen
[41:44] now does that sound right you know God
[41:46] has pity when his children go through
[41:48] trials you know he allows him to go
[41:49] through trials but he pities them just
[41:51] like he did job you know job Elijah who
[41:54] told job you called yourself more
[41:56] righteous than God and God didn't strike
[41:58] job dead
[41:59] job sat there and said I'm just and
[42:01] you're unjust
[42:03] and God did not Smite him dead
[42:05] why because God pities his children
[42:08] and the church said amen
[42:11] and God's mercy on job was very great
[42:13] amen it was from the Earth to the High
[42:16] Heavens Hallelujah
[42:17] God had great Mercy on job how about the
[42:20] songwriter who said where's my God where
[42:22] is God
[42:23] how many times have you asked that
[42:25] let's see God is merciful to you he says
[42:27] he never leaves you nor forsake you but
[42:29] then you question where are you right
[42:31] but then God has mercy on you he has
[42:33] Grace upon you because he loves you
[42:35] praise God
[42:37] see I can be real with God I can say
[42:39] anything and not be afraid God knows I'm
[42:41] going to go through trials and God is
[42:43] going to bring me through the trials
[42:44] praise God
[42:46] see we've never purposely blasphemed now
[42:49] verse 17 18 but the mercy of the Lord is
[42:51] from Everlasting to Everlasting upon
[42:53] them that fear him and his righteousness
[42:55] unto children's children
[42:57] to such as keep his Covenant and to
[42:58] those that remember his Commandments to
[43:00] do them so of course it's conditional
[43:01] right but we're taking an eternal
[43:03] perspective God has always foreknown me
[43:06] I was chosen in Christ before the
[43:07] foundation of the world so I can be real
[43:09] with God I'm not afraid of losing my
[43:11] salvation he saved me by grace and I'll
[43:13] have the fear of the Lord if I'm wrong
[43:15] God will correct me and I'll make it
[43:17] right praise God
[43:18] so see
[43:20] and which of these which of these men of
[43:22] God didn't say harsh things
[43:24] you know all men all men and women say
[43:26] harsh things against God
[43:28] said you owe me something and God said
[43:30] no I don't owe you anything
[43:33] you know we all we all say things we
[43:35] wish we would have had said but as a
[43:37] father pities his children as a father
[43:39] understands you know they're just still
[43:41] developing they're still young so God
[43:43] understands we're still developing we're
[43:45] not Eternal yet but one day we will be
[43:47] Eternal praise God
[43:48] Hallelujah
[43:53] he's merciful gracious slow to anger and
[43:56] he has plenty of Mercy For Us Church
[44:00] and you know the Bible says you know the
[44:01] song says you made me and you like what
[44:03] you made you made me and you don't make
[44:04] mistakes
[44:05] Psalm 139 is familiar I'm fearfully and
[44:08] wonderfully made the Bible says
[44:10] see God made you now let's read the one
[44:12] I mentioned this morning Exodus 4 11.
[44:13] this this is uh sober and this is a very
[44:16] sobering verse I remember my wife
[44:17] mentioned this and I thought oh that's
[44:18] right I forgot about that verse
[44:21] Moses complains and says well I can't go
[44:24] talk to pharaoh
[44:26] and God asking these great questions
[44:30] Moses was slow of speech that means he
[44:33] didn't talk fast and I'm kind of a fast
[44:34] talker Moses was not that way he's very
[44:37] slow can you imagine a slow preacher
[44:41] and
[44:42] the church said amen
[44:46] you'd be like finishing it before he
[44:47] said it that's right amen just say it
[44:51] well Moses was slow
[44:53] you might be happy I'm a fast preacher
[44:55] Maybe
[44:56] but he was a slow of tongue the Bible
[44:58] says and he tells God I'm not eloquent
[45:02] verse 11 and the Lord said him who made
[45:04] man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or
[45:07] deaf or the seeing or the blind have not
[45:10] I the Lord
[45:11] see the Lord made you and the Lord
[45:13] doesn't make mistakes
[45:16] Hallelujah
[45:17] now it's sobering right because we have
[45:19] we have friends who have children with
[45:21] disabilities you know friends I have a
[45:22] friend in Minnesota brother Russell my
[45:24] children met him he has a son who has uh
[45:27] I think Down syndrome it's a really
[45:28] severe case and he's got to be just in
[45:31] his chair all the time and it's
[45:32] I prayed for him we prayed for him he's
[45:34] still that in that condition you know
[45:35] and but God made it the Bible says God
[45:39] did that
[45:41] but you know Church a lot of times in
[45:43] those situations some of those children
[45:44] have the sweetest Spirits now not always
[45:46] but a lot of times those children have
[45:47] such sweet Spirits they just put so much
[45:49] joy on people's faces
[45:51] like I remember my high school friend he
[45:52] had a child with Down Syndrome
[45:55] and uh
[45:57] you know he put all these pictures on
[45:58] Facebook that was when I was on sale on
[46:00] Facebook and this was the cutest little
[46:01] kid you'd ever want to see like they did
[46:03] videos and it was they did all these
[46:05] videos he was such a loving little boy
[46:07] you know and
[46:08] you know some people get mad at that
[46:10] doctors would say abort that child but
[46:12] God says I'm making it and it's for a
[46:14] purpose
[46:15] trust my love
[46:18] trust my love
[46:19] hallelujah how many One Trust God's love
[46:22] so I mean so these lyrics you know
[46:24] the first time I heard him I was like
[46:26] wow
[46:28] so I can understand these better
[46:31] you know say uh this the song says you
[46:33] take me just as I am and Jesus said come
[46:36] unto me all you that are weary and heavy
[46:38] laden and I will give you rest for your
[46:40] souls
[46:42] Hallelujah Jesus said come God bless you
[46:44] Decorah good to see you Hallelujah so
[46:46] the song says you take me just as I am
[46:47] Jesus didn't say well get rid of your
[46:49] pain first and then come to me he said
[46:51] no come to me and then I'll give you
[46:52] rest
[46:54] see people want to try to get rid of
[46:55] things before they come to Jesus no just
[46:57] come to Christ just come to the word and
[47:00] Christ will give you what you need
[47:01] praise God
[47:02] Hallelujah he takes us all just as we
[47:05] are
[47:06] the Bible said all have fallen short of
[47:08] the glory of God all have sinned and
[47:10] come short of the glory of God no one
[47:11] deserves it so we just at some point
[47:13] we've got to make a decision I I have
[47:16] I'm faulty I have all these problems but
[47:18] I'm coming to Jesus and he'll take care
[47:19] of it praise God
[47:21] if I'm Restless he'll give me rest amen
[47:24] if I'm mourning he'll give me a dance
[47:26] praise God hallelujah if I'm sick he'll
[47:29] make me well praise God
[47:31] if I'm hateful he'll give me mercy
[47:33] praise God he'll give me love instead of
[47:35] hatred praise God
[47:36] that's what he says he says just come as
[47:38] you are
[47:39] in all of our situations right
[47:43] you choose me all over again the Bible
[47:45] says I was chosen in Christ before the
[47:46] foundation of world so if I'm chosen in
[47:48] Christ before the world was ever formed
[47:50] then he'd always choose me because he
[47:52] chose me at the beginning praise God
[47:53] before there ever was a world he already
[47:55] chose me before that so he choose me
[47:57] again
[47:58] he can't make a mistake and say I made
[48:00] the wrong choice I should not have chose
[48:01] brother Jesse I should have chose
[48:02] somebody else
[48:03] he wouldn't change it because his choice
[48:05] is always right the first time
[48:08] let me read Malachi or Malachi he read
[48:10] Malachi 3 7. okay oh you got your Bob
[48:12] okay sorry about that
[48:15] Malachi 37 this was reminded me of this
[48:17] he'd choose me all over again
[48:22] in other words despite what God knows
[48:24] and what God has seen about the failures
[48:26] of my life he still loves me he still
[48:28] choose me again
[48:29] and that's what the Bible says now this
[48:31] is just one there's many verses like
[48:32] this but Malachi go and read that
[48:41] amen
[48:43] if you just return to me if you just
[48:45] come as you are I'll return to you
[48:47] see you choose me he would choose us all
[48:49] over again
[48:51] right
[48:52] your fathers have neglected me so in
[48:53] other words two three generations have
[48:55] neglected me but come back to me I'll
[48:57] choose you again
[48:59] Hallelujah and I'm the one you love I
[49:02] already read that out of Hosea right
[49:03] nine and then Romans 9 25.
[49:06] you the Gentiles were not God's beloved
[49:09] but now you are beloved
[49:11] no one can hear no one here can say I'm
[49:13] not loved of God because the Bible says
[49:15] the Gentiles are loved of God
[49:17] Hallelujah
[49:19] let's all say let's say I'm God's
[49:20] beloved ready I am God's beloved let's
[49:23] say it again ready I am God's beloved I
[49:25] like that say with some conviction
[49:26] praise God
[49:27] I am God's beloved Hallelujah he loves
[49:29] me praise God
[49:31] now this is a this this is the line that
[49:34] got me the hardest like I didn't have
[49:36] understanding this I don't have to prove
[49:37] anything well the Bible says prove all
[49:39] things
[49:41] but that's for them that's for the
[49:42] ministry right prove all the truths but
[49:45] if you just look at this as a song of
[49:46] Salvation we don't have to prove
[49:48] anything because we're not saved by our
[49:50] works we're saved by grace
[49:53] if you and I can brag about anything
[49:55] then Jesus didn't have to die for us
[49:58] right so don't come to Jesus and say
[50:00] look what I've done no I don't have to
[50:02] prove anything
[50:04] I wasn't the sacrifice I needed a
[50:06] sacrifice and God provided it for me
[50:08] praise God
[50:10] amen I'm going to just read that because
[50:13] it's a beautiful scripture Ephesians 2
[50:14] 8-9 and thank you people for
[50:16] reading if I've called upon you real
[50:18] abruptly thank you for understanding
[50:21] Ephesians 2 8
[50:23] and 9.
[50:27] now remember this is the same chapter of
[50:28] the great love we talked about earlier
[50:29] right the great love
[50:31] verse eight for by grace are ye saved
[50:33] through faith and that not of yourselves
[50:36] you cannot save yourself
[50:39] I cannot save myself Christ saves us
[50:43] it is the gift of God salvation is a
[50:45] gift Saints you just you just got to
[50:48] accept the gift praise God
[50:50] not of Works lest any man should boast
[50:53] just a reminder I don't have to prove
[50:55] anything Christ's already proved it for
[50:57] me
[50:58] he proved I was lovable beforehand
[51:01] because he died for me praise God
[51:04] he proved I was worthy of being saved
[51:06] amen he proved I was worthy of being
[51:08] forgiven because he gave himself praise
[51:10] God he became the sacrifice and I
[51:12] accepted to praise God he proved it all
[51:14] Hallelujah he proved everything
[51:17] I want us to prove I'm good enough to go
[51:19] to heaven Jesus already proved it
[51:21] Hallelujah I don't have to prove I'm
[51:23] good enough for the Rapture Jesus
[51:24] already proved it
[51:26] he gave you the Holy Ghost amen he gave
[51:29] me the Holy Ghost that's how you know
[51:31] Hallelujah
[51:32] he already proved it Hallelujah
[51:35] he gives us the Holy Ghost
[51:38] and there's room at your table for me
[51:39] Psalm 23 5 said thou preparest a table
[51:43] for me in the prince of mine enemies
[51:46] like Esther Esther had a table prepared
[51:49] in the prince of Haman
[51:51] see God God brings enemies around to
[51:54] prove who's the real believer
[51:55] when your dad had that Feast I believe
[51:58] that was God
[51:59] when they celebrate your dad being
[52:01] healed I believe that was God preparing
[52:03] a feast in the presence of some of our
[52:04] enemies were there
[52:06] now say that in love
[52:08] but the only one your mom thanked was
[52:10] our church
[52:12] I couldn't understand her mung I'm not
[52:13] saying I understand Hmong
[52:15] that's the only time she smiled during
[52:16] that whole time was when she talked
[52:17] about us
[52:18] that's just my guess so if I'm wrong you
[52:21] can correct me after surface
[52:24] but there were some enemies at least I
[52:26] know some of my enemies were there at
[52:27] least I should say that
[52:29] uh or at least one enemy maybe maybe a
[52:31] couple more oh yes right some of the
[52:33] yeah some of the pastors had told people
[52:34] not to come to our church so yes there
[52:36] was a couple enemies I had there
[52:37] but God I felt like God gave us a table
[52:40] in the prince of our enemies praise God
[52:44] and then Luke 14 23 let's read that Luke
[52:46] 14 23.
[52:51] now this is the parable of the great
[52:53] supper I love this verse
[52:55] this is the one where Jesus sends out
[52:57] invitation come to the supper and people
[52:59] just make Excuse excuse you know houses
[53:01] money marriage land all these excuses
[53:03] and Jesus said send them out again my
[53:05] table must be filled praise God verse 24
[53:08] for I say unto you that none of those
[53:10] I'm sorry verse 23 and the Lord said
[53:12] unto the servant go out into the
[53:13] highways and the hedges and compel them
[53:15] to come in that my my house may be
[53:18] filled amen look Church there are so
[53:20] many people that don't want to come to
[53:21] the marriage supper but you're one of
[53:23] them that wants to come and is proven
[53:24] because you're here feasting at the
[53:26] Master's spiritual table praise God
[53:29] and if you're here eating at the
[53:31] spiritual table no doubt you'll be at
[53:33] God's physical table as well praise God
[53:35] because you don't get to the physical
[53:36] table unless you eat the spiritual food
[53:38] of God first
[53:40] oh Hallelujah
[53:44] see sometimes you got to compel people
[53:45] to come in
[53:47] come to Christ come to hear the word of
[53:48] God come let the word of God change your
[53:50] life come as you are amen you don't have
[53:53] to prove anything just come to Jesus if
[53:55] you need rest he'll give you rest if you
[53:56] need strength he'll give you strength if
[53:58] you need forgiveness he'll give you
[53:59] forgiveness if you need peace they'll
[54:00] give you peace he's your Waymaker praise
[54:02] God
[54:03] amen
[54:05] I have to prove anything there's room at
[54:07] the table for me Church
[54:09] Hallelujah the Bible said he that's an
[54:10] overcomer Revelation 3 21 will sit with
[54:13] me in my Throne as I sat down with my
[54:16] father in his throne see he's got he's
[54:18] got a place at the throne
[54:20] there's a table there's a place on the
[54:22] throne for you praise God if you
[54:24] overcome sin
[54:27] and then in Revelation 19 9 says we're
[54:29] invited
[54:30] the Bible says we're invited to the
[54:31] marriage supper lamb blessed is he
[54:33] that's been invited to the marriage
[54:35] suffer the lamb praise God there's a
[54:37] place at God's table for you
[54:39] hallelujah how do you believe that
[54:41] and the second verse I know you're proud
[54:44] of me Jesus says when that when the man
[54:46] comes back who's invested all of his
[54:48] talents he says well done my good and
[54:50] faithful servant
[54:51] in other words I'm proud of you brother
[54:52] man said God look down from heaven saw
[54:54] David dancing he said that's a man after
[54:56] my That's my boy she's proud of him yeah
[54:59] I brought him he's dancing for me praise
[55:00] God Amen

[55:07] my servant job
[55:09] there's none like him in the Earth don't
[55:11] you think that's don't you think that's
[55:12] parents being proud of their kids
[55:16] he said he said even he even said this
[55:18] there's none like him in the entire
[55:20] Earth that's a that's a that's quite a
[55:21] compliment right there
[55:23] that's quite a brag on your boy imagine
[55:26] if I said that there's no boys like
[55:27] Malachi some of you get what do you mean
[55:30] what about my son what about
[55:33] well I'm not saying that for sure I'm
[55:35] saying that's what God said about Job
[55:36] amen
[55:37] God's the one who sets all this up right
[55:39] he does it by God God looks at their
[55:41] their their surrender God looks at their
[55:43] dedication God looks at their diligence
[55:45] praise God and then God knows who's most
[55:46] diligent who is running who's dying to

[55:57] we're not going to argue about it like
[55:58] they are today we're not going to argue
[55:59] about it we're just going to try to
[56:00] serve the Lord the best we can
[56:03] and then Hebrews yeah if you want to
[56:04] know you're well pleasing God do this in
[56:06] Hebrews 13.
[56:08] God is well pleased with his children
[56:10] that means he's proud of you
[56:12] with a spiritual holy Pride
[56:16] Hebrews 13 15. we know God has no sinful
[56:19] Pride
[56:23] Hebrews 13 15. there we are
[56:29] by him therefore let us offer to say I'm
[56:31] sorry the sacrifice of praise to God
[56:33] continually that is the fruit of our
[56:35] lips giving thanks to his name
[56:38] but to do good and to communicate forget
[56:41] not
[56:42] for with such sacrifices God is well
[56:45] pleased notice that sacrifices
[56:47] communicate means to associate or
[56:49] fellowship with
[56:50] so constantly give God praise constantly
[56:54] give God thanks and be around God's
[56:56] people God is well pleased with you

[57:10] arguing to sacrifice of praise if you're
[57:13] constantly communicating with the

[57:17] right that's what I want I'm well
[57:19] pleased with you there's a place on my
[57:20] table amen

[57:29] just got to look at our lives the last
[57:30] two hours
[57:31] or maybe the last
[57:34] 20 minutes

[57:56] about the love of God
[58:00] in that beautiful Church all those
[58:01] proofs that God loves you
[58:03] Hallelujah
[58:09] God has set his love on you
[58:12] he looks down and says I love you Bank
[58:15] I got a Channel of love I'm just going
[58:16] to pour out my love to brother Bank
[58:18] all God's people
[58:23] because God loves us we should love each
[58:25] other
[58:26] so I'm 62. I'm sorry having a hard time
[58:28] getting her
[58:30] hurry up brother John hurry up okay
[58:33] there it is 62.
[58:35] they only consult to cast him down from
[58:38] his Excellency they Delight in lies they
[58:40] bless with their mouth but they curse
[58:42] inwardly I'm in the wrong spot
[58:48] I wrote down the wrong
[58:50] that's not the right verse there
[58:59] no that's the wrong one
[59:02] I know Zephaniah is right but uh
[59:06] where did I get that one I don't know
[59:07] how to go back and look in the scripture
[59:10] so I'm 62 4 and 5.
[59:15] I'm in psalm 62.
[59:17] no that's not it um
[59:20] it's a good scripture about expectation
[59:21] but amen preached on the you need
[59:23] expectations scripture there's another
[59:24] one but let's go to Zephaniah 3 yeah
[59:26] sorry about that I'm disappointed in
[59:28] that
[59:33] God is proud of all of his children
[59:34] Hallelujah
[59:39] remember church I don't want this verse
[59:40] on there but the Bible says there's
[59:42] rejoicing in the presence of the Angels
[59:44] when a sinner repents
[59:47] so I don't know who's rejoicing I don't
[59:48] know if it's the Angels rejoicing or I
[59:50] don't know but the Bible says there's
[59:51] rejoicing in the prince of angels over
[59:53] one sinner who repents in other words
[59:56] there's somebody in heaven giving God
[59:58] glory because you got saved Hallelujah
[1:00:02] think about that heaven's I'm sorry hell
[1:00:04] is screaming and and upset about it but
[1:00:07] Heaven's rejoicing amen hallelujah amen
[1:00:10] devils are fleeing out of your life
[1:00:12] Hallelujah devils are being constantly
[1:00:14] cast out of your mind cast out of your
[1:00:16] life but Heaven's rejoicing Hallelujah
[1:00:18] because your name's been written there
[1:00:20] praise God
[1:00:21] before the foundation of the world your
[1:00:23] name was written on the last book of
[1:00:24] life Hallelujah
[1:00:25] oh thank you Jesus
[1:00:30] I can't believe I didn't get that verse
[1:00:31] right was Zephaniah 3.
[1:00:47] all right Zechariah
[1:00:56] I'm having a hard time there it is there
[1:00:58] okay I was going to say where is it all
[1:01:00] right
[1:01:00] now this is a beautiful uh book here
[1:01:03] short book he prophesied around the time
[1:01:05] of Josiah so just a few Kings before
[1:01:07] Israel was uh totally taken away
[1:01:10] zedekiah was the last king of course uh
[1:01:12] before Babylon overthrew Israel put them
[1:01:16] all into exile
[1:01:17] okay but this is a beautiful prophecy so
[1:01:19] Zephaniah rebukes him in chapters one
[1:01:21] and two but then in chapter three he
[1:01:22] gives him hope for the future George
[1:01:23] aren't you glad you got hope praise God
[1:01:25] Hallelujah there is hope for the future
[1:01:27] praise God
[1:01:30] verse uh we'll start at 14. seeing o
[1:01:33] Daughter of Zion shout o Israel be glad
[1:01:35] to Rejoice with all the heart
[1:01:37] oh daughter of Jerusalem the Lord had
[1:01:39] taken away thy judgments and has cast
[1:01:40] out thine enemy the king of Israel even
[1:01:43] the Lord is in the midst of thee Thou
[1:01:45] shalt not see evil anymore this has to
[1:01:47] be the Millennium right
[1:01:49] you're not going to see any more evil
[1:01:51] that has to be the Millennium right
[1:01:54] verse 16. in that day it should be said
[1:01:56] to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion
[1:01:59] let not thine hands be slack look at
[1:02:02] verse 17. the Lord thy God in the midst
[1:02:05] of thee is mine now church is he not in
[1:02:07] our midst today
[1:02:08] he said wherever two or three gathered
[1:02:10] there I am in the midst praise God
[1:02:13] and the Bible just said we don't have to
[1:02:14] have fear the Bible said perfect love
[1:02:16] can cast out fear praise God God does
[1:02:18] not give us the spirit of fear but a
[1:02:20] power love and a sound mind Hallelujah
[1:02:23] so we see the spiritual aspect this is a
[1:02:26] natural prophecy to Israel probably for
[1:02:28] the Millennium but we see the spiritual
[1:02:30] prophecy for the bride
[1:02:33] the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee
[1:02:35] he is mighty he will save
[1:02:38] he will rejoice over thee with joy now
[1:02:40] church if he rejoices over the Jews then
[1:02:43] you know he rejoices over the Gentiles
[1:02:45] because he said the Jews were my people
[1:02:47] but now the Gentiles are my people
[1:02:49] praise God
[1:02:50] God rejoices over your service brother
[1:02:52] amen
[1:02:53] Hallelujah I can say that God rejoices
[1:02:56] that you got saved brother Chris
[1:02:57] it says he will rejoice let's all say he
[1:03:00] ready he didn't say they which the
[1:03:02] Angels might Rejoice but God rejoices ah
[1:03:06] God already knows it's going to happen
[1:03:07] but when it happens he rejoices in the
[1:03:10] real time amen or the time of of time
[1:03:12] he's outside of time but within time he
[1:03:15] rejoices in time
[1:03:17] the Bible said he will rejoice over thee
[1:03:19] with joy so see does God smile that's
[1:03:22] your church oh yeah he's got joy
[1:03:24] you ever seen somebody with joy that
[1:03:25] never smiles
[1:03:28] how can you have joy and not smile
[1:03:31] thank you that's right we're not
[1:03:33] cucumbers
[1:03:35] Hallelujah but see I still make my
[1:03:38] father smile he still rejoices Heaven
[1:03:40] rejoices when you get saved
[1:03:42] somebody in heaven I don't know if it's
[1:03:43] the Angels but somebody's rejoicing when
[1:03:45] you got saved
[1:03:46] right
[1:03:48] and then when you win souls like Austin
[1:03:50] winning Souls praise God hallelujah
[1:03:51] pointing Chris to the church amen
[1:03:54] sister Lena
[1:03:56] Hallelujah see God has Joy over you
[1:04:00] Hallelujah
[1:04:02] let's finish that verse he will rest
[1:04:05] in his love he will Joy over them with
[1:04:08] singing so God will now this is some
[1:04:09] people think God sings God might sing
[1:04:11] but either God will sing or he'll have
[1:04:13] the Angels Sing
[1:04:15] this is when all Israel comes back to
[1:04:18] the promised land in the Millennium God
[1:04:20] is going to have singing and he's going
[1:04:22] to Rejoice all my people or come back
[1:04:24] but Church he's already he's currently
[1:04:26] rejoicing right now because you are his
[1:04:28] beloved you are his people God rejoices
[1:04:31] over you I still make my father smile
[1:04:34] praise God let's stand up our feet

[1:04:49] I'm the one you the one you love we sang
[1:04:51] at the end and that's why I had all my
[1:04:53] heart I was thinking I was thinking
[1:04:54] about that verse all last night
[1:04:57] and I was praying in my prayer closet
[1:04:59] this morning and I had that song on and
[1:05:00] I started thinking about yeah that's
[1:05:01] right all the verses I thought about job
[1:05:02] and
[1:05:04] and David and
[1:05:06] I make these mistakes but yet God's
[1:05:08] still with me God Don't Make Mistakes
[1:05:10] all these verses started coming to me
[1:05:12] while I was praying this morning
[1:05:13] I thought well I'd like to preach one
[1:05:15] more on that by God's grace you enjoy it

[1:05:54] you stay in contact with God he's going
[1:05:56] to change some of your maybe some of
[1:05:57] your words

[1:06:03] why is this so hard or why is this so
[1:06:05] awful well God may show you there's a
[1:06:07] reason for it if he will in time there's
[1:06:10] a reason for everything God is not the
