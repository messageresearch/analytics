[21:55] let's go to first Peter chapter 1 here I
[21:59] can look at this all again we looked at
[22:01] soul first I'd like to look at same
[22:04] topic but no different thoughts
[22:08] understanding the soul
[22:27] okay I just got a text from brother bang
[22:29] so James is sick so they'll be live
[22:34] streaming awesome will read our text
[22:40] little paper bang
[23:04] verse 18
[23:16] we looked at the soul a couple weeks ago
[23:19] I've been studying more into it starting
[23:21] to finally open up a little bit starting
[23:24] to feel a bit under better understanding
[23:36] you were not redeemed with corruptible
[23:39] things as silver and gold from your vain
[23:45] conversation received by tradition from
[23:48] your father's but with the precious
[23:52] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[23:54] blemish and without spot I want you to
[24:00] just catch that thought like redemption
[24:02] really never happened until the blood of
[24:05] Christ was shed so that means if you you
[24:11] know every sit every person member was
[24:13] kept in the prison house of Hell near it
[24:19] you know near it although it was called
[24:21] Abraham's bosom we know that but it was
[24:23] near hell because Satan had a ransom
[24:29] over them the Bible said the handwriting
[24:32] of the wall was against them so Satan
[24:34] had rights to them because he tricked
[24:37] Adam the Bible said of whom a man is
[24:39] overcome the same he's in bondage to yes
[24:43] so the soul of man under the Old
[24:47] Testament was not fully redeemed and so
[24:51] he had rights over those souls and
[24:53] that's why that which could call up the
[24:54] souls now they came up in theophany form
[24:57] you know but that's still part of the
[25:00] soul you know that theophany is the
[25:01] image of the soul and then that's that's
[25:07] really fresh to me now verse 20 who
[25:11] verily was foreordained before the
[25:13] foundation of the world but was manifest
[25:14] in these last times for youth who by him
[25:19] to believe in God that raised up him
[25:22] from the dead and gave him glory that
[25:26] your faith and hope might be in God
[25:29] not in the church not in me not in
[25:33] brother branham in God our faith is in
[25:37] God seeing now here's the beautiful part
[25:40] where he breaks it down to the soul
[25:43] seeing yet ye have purified your soul
[25:46] see there's now we're getting to the
[25:47] free more agency like remember the Bible
[25:50] said remember Paul and Barnabas said
[25:51] save yourselves from this untoward
[25:55] generation remember that in other words
[25:58] there we can't save ourselves but what
[26:01] they're saying is use your free more
[26:03] agency and choose to repent and get
[26:05] saved so now it's saying you say you
[26:10] purified your souls well you didn't do
[26:12] it but you chose to allow God to do it
[26:15] see seeing you purified your souls in
[26:19] obeying the truth through the spirit
[26:24] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren
[26:28] that's sincere love of the Brethren see
[26:31] that ye love one another with a pure
[26:32] heart fervently I just wanted to catch
[26:36] that again see this is something I
[26:37] haven't got to yet but our souls are
[26:39] purified through the blood of Christ so
[26:44] that means church without without the
[26:46] baptism the Holy Ghost a soul is not
[26:48] truly pure yet see because they can
[26:51] still choose unbelief right it can still
[26:53] just a human element it doesn't have a
[26:56] divine element but once the baptism of
[26:58] the Holy Ghost comes down the Bible
[27:00] makes the Bible says your soul is now
[27:03] redeemed and it's pure because of the
[27:07] pure Holy Spirit's there but how do you
[27:10] get there through obedience obedience
[27:15] choosing
[27:17] obey choosing God's way God's will verse
[27:19] 23 here's being born again that means
[27:23] born of above being born from above not
[27:27] of corruptible seed see I have my dad
[27:31] seated me right
[27:32] but it's corruptible some day I'm gonna
[27:33] die I was born with corrupt seed but
[27:39] we're not born we're born again we're
[27:41] born from above of incorruptible by the
[27:44] Word of God which liveth and abideth for
[27:49] ever
[27:49] Oh glory there's a part of you and I
[27:52] that would live forever amen for all
[27:54] flesh is as grass see the Smith flesh
[27:58] the Li flesh
[28:00] janne flesh it's all all weathers away
[28:04] all flesh is as grass and all the glory
[28:07] of man is a glory of grass the grass
[28:09] withereth and the flower thereof falleth
[28:11] away but the word of the Lord endureth
[28:14] forever and this is the word which by
[28:18] the gospel is preached unto you we get
[28:21] to hear it multiple times a week praise
[28:23] God that's that word of Prayer Heavenly
[28:26] Father we love you Lord God we'd give
[28:28] our last breath Lord for you and by
[28:30] proving it Lord we give our Sunday
[28:32] nights to you Lord we give our Wednesday
[28:34] nights we give all of our time to You
[28:36] Lord God because we love you and we
[28:38] thank you Lord for all you've done
[28:40] dear God we just ask that your Holy
[28:42] Spirit would be with us you're here lord
[28:46] help us to hear your voice dear God we
[28:49] love you Lord keep us humble in Jesus
[28:51] Christ's name
[28:51] everybody said amen god bless you being
[28:54] seated praise God I do have a few slides
[28:57] there occasion I tried to switch over I
[28:59] think I used my iPhone so the first
[29:03] picture his brother Jason to Mars slide
[29:07] it's a little blurry cuz his file size
[29:10] was small I just kind of want to review
[29:13] it real quick he did a good job that's
[29:19] it's probably the best drawing I've ever
[29:21] seen of the soul and everything because
[29:27] you know your outer courts you know your
[29:29] flesh is out here
[29:31] oh I think I cut it down to I think he
[29:32] had the flesh as well and then he had
[29:34] the five like these five gates you know
[29:36] they're kind of like Gates or inlets
[29:38] okay
[29:39] and so the flesh had five of those as
[29:41] well was really nice to see that that
[29:43] that's how your flesh is contacted
[29:45] through the five senses but the spirit
[29:47] now is contacted through imagination
[29:50] it's contacted through memory reason
[29:54] conscience and then affection which is
[29:57] your emotions and your love whether
[29:59] strong love or strong hate and now the
[30:03] soul for a Christian it's only has one
[30:06] channel faith or unbelief you have to
[30:10] make that choice and that's what we
[30:11] looked at here tonight in our text and
[30:13] one not a beautiful text seemed like the
[30:15] Holy Spirit just directed me to that
[30:16] text right there about the soul now it's
[30:20] a little series we I don't know how many
[30:22] parts it'll be but I want to call this
[30:24] understanding the soul because it's
[30:25] helping me to understand it a little bit
[30:28] better by the grace of the Lord and I
[30:31] don't think I'll be an hour maybe if it
[30:33] maybe less
[30:36] so let's look to the word here now when
[30:39] we read our text beautiful text now I
[30:42] just caught that while I was I I need to
[30:45] go back and listen this to when I do
[30:47] when I write more on the chapter because
[30:49] the text said we were redeemed now that
[30:51] redemption that buying back there it is
[30:53] right there right
[30:54] see that's why brother Branham preached
[30:57] first and then he wrote the book next
[30:59] but see I'm trying to write the book and
[31:00] then priest I need to I need to go back
[31:04] and listen this big there it is right
[31:05] there redeem has bought back those souls
[31:08] had to be bought back and they're bought
[31:09] with the blood of Christ because he said
[31:12] I have to give my life as a ransom a
[31:14] payment for the sin debt of the world so
[31:19] there it is right there my thank the
[31:20] Lord so before that that's why the souls
[31:23] were held captive
[31:24] they were property of the devil because
[31:26] he tricked mankind or deceived Eve but
[31:29] then you know he deceit way he got Adam
[31:31] to disobey but really Adam was doing it
[31:34] as act of redemption but either way he
[31:37] forfeited the rights of obedience he
[31:39] forfeit it by disobedience and Satan had
[31:41] him bondage he was bondage to sin
[31:44] and death and all those things so we
[31:47] were never redeemed until the blood of
[31:49] Jesus Christ did away with all sin now
[31:52] what's interesting though church this
[31:53] something I've studied on but member
[31:55] Nathan told David after his sin with
[31:58] adults remember what Nathan said he said
[31:59] but God has put your sins from you he
[32:03] said God has put your sins away right so
[32:06] see God put him away but he never did
[32:07] away with them
[32:10] the Bible says we'll get to a little bit
[32:12] but the Bible said the blood of bulls
[32:13] and goats could never do away with sin
[32:16] okay so it's like a covering so it's
[32:19] like God had sinned he just put a
[32:21] blanket over and at least it was covered
[32:23] but it wasn't washed away it wasn't done
[32:26] away with because the sacrifice wasn't
[32:29] powerful enough i'ma show you the
[32:31] sacrifice of bulls and goats was
[32:32] powerful to some degrees right like we
[32:35] talked about with you know I can't pray
[32:36] son Enoch could be raptured through the
[32:39] the blood of bulls and goats Moses could
[32:43] park the Red Sea with the blood of bulls
[32:45] and goats amen that's powerful so there
[32:49] is power in that we know that but there
[32:54] was more power and that was the power to
[32:57] purify the soul praise God and that's
[32:59] what we should be seeking after now I
[33:01] just put a little picture up here I'll
[33:02] add more to it a little bit so this is
[33:05] all I've learned see so see before
[33:07] before this series this is all I thought
[33:09] this this was not there all I thought
[33:11] this all was just faith through I
[33:12] believe I even thought it was sinful and
[33:15] going to hell or saved that's all I
[33:18] thought and I thought it's either divine
[33:20] faith or not divine but I realized later
[33:26] now there's actually a human element
[33:27] there's actually a human part of your
[33:29] soul so it's a human spirit right just
[33:32] like your spirit and it's in the in the
[33:34] soul is the human freemore agency and
[33:37] program calls it it's your will your
[33:40] soul is your will or your desire to
[33:44] choose so the choice is here now I'll be
[33:48] bringing out this scripture later I
[33:49] don't have it right now but the Bible
[33:51] said that we must not do will worship I
[33:54] don't know I don't remember that from
[33:56] the New Testament
[33:57] but Paul said we must not do will
[33:59] worship and so si will worship would be
[34:02] worshipping according to your own will
[34:04] instead of God's will
[34:07] the brother Brahim said that's what Cain
[34:09] was worshipping under will worship he
[34:11] said I'm gonna worship I'm gonna do my
[34:13] I'm new I'm gonna worship how I want to
[34:14] worship nobody's gonna tell me how to
[34:16] worship God I'm gonna worship Him
[34:18] according to my will
[34:19] see it was will worship is my I'm
[34:22] bringing I'm bringing it although in my
[34:24] labor this is what I work for instead of
[34:27] doing God's will which was blood right
[34:30] he brought fruits vegetables beautiful
[34:33] beautiful sacrifice but it was his will
[34:35] not God's will so will worship means
[34:39] soul worship soul of disbelief or so of
[34:43] dis rejecting disbelieving God's Word
[34:47] okay so that's all new to me now let me
[34:50] explain this here this is my direction
[34:52] for this sermon I want to begin with
[34:56] first Peter 1 chapter 1 and I want to
[35:00] show God's imagery for the born-again
[35:02] soul is a ground and his word is the
[35:05] seed so I always looked at Jesus parable
[35:09] as just the human spirit you know Jesus
[35:11] talks about the four so or I'm sorry the
[35:12] sower that went so did he stood on four
[35:14] grounds right I've always looked at the
[35:16] ground as just the human spirit but now
[35:18] I see it as the spirit and the soul
[35:20] because the soul is just part of the
[35:23] spirit right it's not something totally
[35:25] different it's just the nature or the
[35:27] will of the human spirit it's a part of
[35:31] it okay so now I see that the Jesus or
[35:35] preachers could be preachers to throwing
[35:37] God's seed on every soul and the word
[35:40] see must fall upon every soul like Jesus
[35:42] parable either it begins to grow or
[35:44] snatched away right that's kind of what
[35:45] the parable is but here's what I want to
[35:50] show just as the seed can lay dormant
[35:53] for thousands of years right and even
[35:55] sinners recognize that so can faith lay
[35:59] in the soul without being quickened
[36:01] without fruit for years this explains a
[36:04] soul condition of the Old Testament
[36:05] Saints by faith they believed God their
[36:09] souls had chosen the word
[36:11] a lot soul was called righteous and
[36:14] rightly so Sodom sins vexed his soul or
[36:18] his will like it wasn't his will to see
[36:20] those guys surrounding his house right
[36:21] he's like why are you doing this wicked
[36:23] thing remember that I just read this
[36:24] that read that this week I'm starting
[36:26] Genesis 1 and I think I'm in chapter 21
[36:28] now it wasn't his will like his that
[36:31] that fought against his soul those deeds
[36:33] just burned in his soul like why he got
[36:35] a honey gots around men like that why he
[36:37] got to do these things like that it was
[36:39] against his righteous soul but here's
[36:42] what I want to say it's kind of like the
[36:45] Old Testament Souls Church were like
[36:47] wintertime it's kind of like the seeds
[36:51] were just there but it's wintertime
[36:53] because they can never be quickened
[36:55] praise God amen you feel me I should say
[36:59] you feel peace you understand what I'm
[37:00] saying that's why I used to say to my
[37:02] friends you feel me I'm a little tired
[37:06] Zach still not up to my hundred percent
[37:09] so it's that I mean I don't have a
[37:11] scripture for that but I'm gonna look
[37:12] for a scripture on that I mean I think I
[37:16] do
[37:16] I forget in a little bit but it's kind
[37:18] of like in the Old Testament they could
[37:20] receive the seed of God but it couldn't
[37:23] grow yet because it the conditions
[37:26] weren't right amen the soul conditions
[37:30] weren't right and so I did you know I
[37:33] did some research here oops sorry
[37:35] I think click over so I did some
[37:39] research and you know Church how many
[37:42] what are the three conditions a seed
[37:44] needs it's got to have water light and
[37:47] soil right that's anybody knows that
[37:51] well so I compared it to what a sea
[37:55] needs what is a and so a natural sea
[37:57] needs water to grow well the Holy Ghost
[38:00] wasn't given in its power to the day of
[38:03] Pentecost right it didn't have the light
[38:07] and light represents knowledge according
[38:09] to Paul they didn't have the knowledge
[38:12] of the cross they're wondering what's
[38:15] the name of member they asked in
[38:16] proverbs 31 they said what's God's name
[38:19] and what's his son's name Amen
[38:21] they didn't have the knowledge they
[38:22] didn't know it was Jesus right they
[38:24] didn't know
[38:24] they knew there was a messiah coming but
[38:26] they didn't the knowledge of what he was
[38:28] gonna do right and the Bible said
[38:31] neither did saying cuz if he knew it he
[38:32] were not a crucified the Lord of glory I
[38:34] leave the light is not yet shine Amen oh
[38:37] my this is inspired and the soil was a
[38:40] good repent and good honest heart so see
[38:43] they had soil there it is right there
[38:44] they had soil they just didn't have
[38:47] light or water it wasn't the right
[38:50] conditions yet care I see that I'm
[38:53] giving Malachi good work out he's got to
[38:54] change the cameras when I walk up when I
[38:56] walk off the pipe he gets a good work
[38:58] out there now does that help that really
[39:01] help me Old Testament Saints could have
[39:03] the water on their soul since it came
[39:05] the day of Pentecost now of course he
[39:07] could fall on their their flesh and
[39:09] their human spirit but not their soul
[39:11] Jesus brought and Paul says this the
[39:14] light of knowledge of the true salvation
[39:16] through the cross amen it was through
[39:20] the cross that the Bible says the
[39:22] glorious light of the gospel the gospel
[39:24] is good news the good news is that God
[39:27] is going to take away all your sin
[39:28] through one sacrifice amen the blood of
[39:30] Jesus Christ is gonna undo all sin
[39:33] praise God that's the good news and the
[39:37] light had not yet shown so the seed
[39:39] couldn't bring forth he lay dormant so
[39:43] that's why I believe I believe
[39:44] Abraham's soul could receive the seed of
[39:48] God but it wasn't yet born again right
[39:51] as he received faith but it wasn't it
[39:54] couldn't be quickened yet and did you
[39:56] know God preached to Abraham did you
[39:57] know that did you know that all right go
[40:00] to Galatians you know that the Bible
[40:06] said God preached the gospel to Abraham
[40:09] I'll look it up here that was fresh to
[40:13] me yeah Galatians
[40:26] not it's a beautiful and that's why
[40:30] Jesus did you know God preached it to
[40:32] Abraham and then Jesus preached to
[40:34] Abraham's seed amen Jesus was God in
[40:39] flesh amen
[40:40] now look at this and the scripture
[40:42] foreseeing that God would justify the
[40:44] heathen through faith preached before
[40:46] the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee
[40:50] shall all nations be blessed amen
[40:53] hallelujah
[40:54] when Abraham got the visions from God
[40:57] God was preaching the gospel to him the
[41:00] good news all nations are gonna be best
[41:01] because of you your faith is gonna
[41:04] ultimately lead to the Messiah amen oh
[41:06] man
[41:07] how about that God preaching to us amen
[41:09] well he's the only real preacher anyway
[41:11] so who preacher this morning it was God
[41:13] Amen God who preached tonight the Lord
[41:16] Jesus amen if it's God's Word God's
[41:18] preaching amen I thought I'd share that
[41:21] that's beautiful now were weed free and
[41:26] stony free hearts are honest and good
[41:28] hearts according to Luke 8:15 that's
[41:32] glorious all right now now here here we
[41:35] are before here it is before the blood
[41:37] of Jesus the conditions for a new birth
[41:39] were unattainable see cuz those three
[41:43] conditions could not be met because of
[41:45] the weakness of animal blood animal will
[41:49] gut this is good
[41:50] watch this actually was good to me I
[41:52] hope it's good to you the animal blood
[41:54] could purify the flesh I mean though the
[41:56] Bible says that the animal blood can
[41:58] actually purify your flesh that's what
[42:02] the Bible says but not the conscience
[42:04] which is part of the human spirit so see
[42:09] let's go outside in animal blood can
[42:12] compare farther outside but not the
[42:15] inside so it could it could clean the
[42:18] outward part the third of it but it
[42:21] couldn't purify the last two-thirds
[42:24] every with me but the Bible said it
[42:28] couldn't purge the conscience from dead
[42:30] works thus the human spirit and soul can
[42:33] be purged by animal blood oh my let's
[42:38] read that if you got your Bible Hebrews
[42:39] 9 let's go to Hebrews 9 just so you can
[42:44] see it Church this is mad at my eyes I
[42:46] just study these it just it's really
[42:47] been opening up it's real been a
[42:48] blessing Hebrews 9 13 for if the blood
[42:52] of bulls and of goats and the ashes of
[42:53] an heifer sprinkling the unclean
[42:55] sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[42:58] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[43:00] who through the Eternal Spirit offered
[43:02] himself without spot to God purge your
[43:05] conscience from dead works to serve the
[43:08] Living God amen praise God we'll get to
[43:12] some more scriptures stay there in
[43:13] Hebrews please here's the next one
[43:15] notice Church the conscious as is part
[43:18] I'm sorry not as part is part of the
[43:20] human spirit this proves the second part
[43:23] of zekiel threefold prophecy new heart
[43:26] new spirit my spirit could only happen
[43:29] through the blood of Christ
[43:30] that's why izq had to bring this out I'm
[43:33] going to give you a new heart a new
[43:34] spirit and my spirit because the blood
[43:37] couldn't even give you a new spirit
[43:40] because they kept remembering it their
[43:42] conscience was never purged from that
[43:44] amen
[43:45] but that means we brother anybody can
[43:46] walk away from our sinful life we can
[43:48] know we're forgiven praise God we can
[43:51] feel pure sister Wendy up here in our
[43:54] minds but they couldn't knew that in the
[43:55] Old Testament those still lingered on
[43:57] there because there wasn't power to do
[43:59] it but now we got power to purge our
[44:01] human spirit amen
[44:02] and our soul but see they didn't have
[44:06] that and I'll prove it to you by the
[44:07] scripture I'll prove it by the Word of
[44:09] God this could only happen through the
[44:12] blood and this means Old Testament
[44:14] States could not fully be sanctified
[44:15] enough to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:17] because the blood of bulls and goats
[44:19] could not purge them their conscience
[44:21] they always had this haunting guilt
[44:24] right they always had this guilt like
[44:26] I'm guilty I'm guilty and I can't
[44:30] believe I like Moses I killed that man
[44:31] you know I buried him in the sand you
[44:33] know they always had this guilt hanging
[44:35] around them I'll show it to your church
[44:36] even job was guilty all the time
[44:39] Joe even God caught him perfect but Joe
[44:44] still felt guilty aim ahead because God
[44:46] caught him perfect because
[44:47] I knew he'd met all the requirements but
[44:50] Joe felt it and Joe felt like I just I'm
[44:54] not close enough to God I'll prove it to
[44:55] you in a minute here because the blood
[44:58] of bulls and goats couldn't get him
[44:59] close enough
[45:00] amen but how much closer we should we be
[45:02] amen
[45:03] oh thank you Jesus if we just stay in
[45:05] the word now look at this now I will go
[45:08] back to see if your hopefully in Hebrews
[45:10] nine Hebrews nine nine which was a
[45:15] figure for the time then present in
[45:16] which were offered both gifts and
[45:18] sacrifices that could not make him that
[45:20] did the service perfect as pertaining to
[45:22] the conscience the conscience so the
[45:26] conscious is your moral compass and it's
[45:29] one of the five parts of the human
[45:31] spirit remember conscious memory reason
[45:33] affects your imagination so these
[45:36] scriptures say animal blood could purify
[45:38] the flesh but not the conscience it
[45:40] couldn't purify the human spirit let me
[45:44] read that read 1314 already yeah I think
[45:46] I did yeah I did now it seems I put it
[45:50] seems because that's as far as I am I'm
[45:52] not fully a hundred percent but it seems
[45:54] true it seems Old Testament sayings like
[45:57] job and David could never quite feel
[45:59] purged due to the weaknesses of animal
[46:02] sacrifices let's read it let's go to job
[46:04] nine now now we could read this whole
[46:06] thing it's beautiful but we won't just
[46:08] for times sake but if you want to read
[46:10] it go ahead I was reading it earlier
[46:12] this week job 9 verse 1 oh this is
[46:26] beautiful my hair right here praise the
[46:28] Lord oh my rich Lewis verse 1 job
[46:34] answered then job answered and said I
[46:36] know it is so of a truth but how should
[46:39] man be just with God now look God was
[46:41] saying he's perfect and job's like how
[46:43] can I be just with God hug the blood of
[46:47] bulls and goats couldn't make him feel
[46:50] forgiven verse 2 I'm sorry I read - I
[46:54] read one and - okay now I said
[46:57] for time sake skip down to 33 actually
[47:03] let me go to 32 for he is not a man
[47:06] speaking of God as I have that I should
[47:08] answer him and we should come together
[47:09] in judgment neither is there any days
[47:12] men be Twix us that might lay his hand
[47:16] upon both of us let him take his rod
[47:19] away from me and let not his fear
[47:20] terrify me then would I speak and not
[47:23] fear him but it is not so with me oh did
[47:26] you catch it
[47:26] Jove is saying oh did you catch it Jove
[47:30] is saying how can I be right with God
[47:32] God is so holy he why is there some days
[47:35] Minh in between that can put his hand on
[47:37] God and put his hand on man
[47:39] and purge me and justify me and brother
[47:43] man said he was praying he was crying
[47:44] out for a mediator and that mediator is
[47:47] Jesus Christ amen
[47:49] because we have one mediator between God
[47:51] and man the man Christ Jesus amen and
[47:54] he's the one who comes between the gap
[47:56] praise God he comes between the breech
[47:59] and he puts his he stands between a holy
[48:02] spirit right and he stands between an
[48:04] unholy man and he becomes the sacrifice
[48:07] for man and brings peace peace between
[48:10] man and God amen oh that's glorious
[48:14] hallelujah but see is he's like wait I
[48:17] don't have a dais Minh I don't have a
[48:19] mediator and he did it that's true so
[48:23] see as perfect as many sacrifice as he
[48:25] offered church and never purified his
[48:28] mind because animal blood can't do that
[48:31] it can't purge your conscience all the
[48:33] way only the butter only the Holy Spirit
[48:35] can do that through the blood of Christ
[48:36] of course amen so 1st Timothy 2:5
[48:41] there's one mediator between God and man
[48:43] the man Christ Jesus
[48:44] oh are you catching it tonight you enjoy
[48:47] this Oh hallelujah
[48:49] did i okay now building upon these words
[48:52] let's read David's words these are
[48:54] beautiful Psalms 133
[49:12] song of degrees I don't think he's
[49:20] talking about PhDs I do you he's not
[49:24] singing about going to college and
[49:25] getting a degree verse 3 if thou Lord
[49:29] should have smart Knik WA T's Oh Lord
[49:31] who shall stand you think David knew
[49:34] about this but there's forgiveness with
[49:36] thee that thou mayst be feared now go to
[49:40] Psalms 143 verse 2 see he knew who is
[49:44] going to be able to stand God it has a
[49:47] mark of all these iniquities right verse
[49:50] 2 43 verse 2 and enter not into judgment
[49:55] with thy servant now this is David for
[49:58] in thy sight shall no man living be
[50:02] justified
[50:04] now look at this they're offering
[50:05] sacrifice member can't breach it every
[50:07] six steps 1 2 3 4 5 a kid he make it to
[50:11] 6 every six steps had to stop and kill a
[50:14] sacrifice to make sure the ark would
[50:17] could be brought back and they could
[50:19] have revival and yet still he says that
[50:22] he says who shall be justified before
[50:25] God
[50:25] 9 so see that they knew God was blessing
[50:29] them and they could feel clean their
[50:31] flesh but in their minds they never
[50:33] quite got the victory see because that
[50:35] anointing would come and go like just
[50:37] like it does ours right sometimes our
[50:39] minds are on fire for the Lord so now if
[50:40] you love thinking about meditate on the
[50:42] Lord sometimes we don't so these are the
[50:46] moments we catch the moments when their
[50:47] minds aren't always anointed see that
[50:51] please don't enter the judgment says for
[50:54] in your sight no man living should be
[50:55] justified because he realized I can't
[50:58] really be purged in my spirit my
[51:01] conscience nor my soul Wow
[51:08] now Romans 3:20 this beautiful 9 this
[51:12] some of these they're just
[51:14] I don't know how say it but just
[51:17] highlight scriptures of the New
[51:18] Testament they're just so beautiful they
[51:19] kind of summarize the beauty of the good
[51:22] news of the gospel Romans 3:20 therefore
[51:26] by the deeds of the law there shall no
[51:29] flesh be justified in his sight now look
[51:31] at that man as much as they obey the law
[51:35] they could not be justified so much as a
[51:38] sacrifice as much as they obeyed they
[51:41] couldn't be justified for by the law is
[51:44] the knowledge of sin see the deeds of
[51:48] the law
[51:50] now these scriptures explain the lack of
[51:53] rest right Old Testament Saints were
[51:56] working doing the deeds of the law which
[51:59] could not justify the flesh so see their
[52:02] human their soul was not quickened so
[52:05] they received the seed the seed fell on
[52:07] their soul they believed but it wasn't
[52:11] quickened yet so the holy spirit wasn't
[52:13] actively his will wasn't active actively
[52:16] causing them to keep the word can I say
[52:18] like that because that's what zekiel
[52:19] said the Holy Spirit will cause you to
[52:21] keep my word amen God's will did it have
[52:25] wasn't active it wasn't quickened yet it
[52:28] wasn't active so the Bible said the soul
[52:32] then must witness the human soul was
[52:34] still working the still human soul was
[52:36] still doing the deeds of the law the
[52:38] deeds of the flesh now our law was a
[52:40] schoolmaster or a teacher to bring us to
[52:42] Christ the grace of Christ according to
[52:44] Galatians 3 so this was all to teach us
[52:49] to learn to rest to learn to trust in
[52:52] Christ to have our minds purged that's
[52:55] what our blood of Christ is all about he
[52:57] can he can undo all your past
[52:59] amen he can put it for under the blood
[53:02] he can do it he can give you a good
[53:04] conscience he can clean out your
[53:06] conscience so that you know you're right
[53:08] with God and he can he can quicken your
[53:11] soul he can birth your soul and make it
[53:13] alive amen
[53:14] hallelujah now also i read romans 326
[53:20] since were there to declare i say at
[53:23] this time his righteousness that he
[53:25] might be just and the justifier
[53:28] him which believeth in Jesus see
[53:32] remember David said who should be
[53:33] justified and now Paul says we are
[53:36] justified by the blood of Christ amen
[53:39] because I believe that Jesus Christ is
[53:41] God's Son amen
[53:43] he died in the cross rose again I
[53:45] believe that and so God says you're
[53:47] justified now day man and I'll justify
[53:51] you I'll sanctify you now through the
[53:53] Holy Spirit and I'll fill you with the
[53:55] Holy Ghost amen
[53:57] now Hebrews 10 1 says this I'll just go
[54:01] cuz it's important to read that it's a
[54:03] important part of the lesson here okay
[54:12] now for the law having a shadow of good
[54:14] things to come and not the very image of
[54:16] the things can never with those
[54:19] sacrifices which they offered year by
[54:21] year continually make the comers
[54:22] thereunto perfect it can never do it but
[54:27] yet God had him do it for 2,000 years
[54:30] right almost 2,000 years because Noah
[54:32] flood was 2,000 years then there's 2,000
[54:34] years of the cross right so almost 2,000
[54:37] years I think is 1500 years Moses got
[54:39] the law they tried to keep her they
[54:41] tried to keep her they tried but it
[54:42] never made them perfect because it
[54:46] couldn't make them perfect the blood
[54:48] wasn't pure blood right wasn't God's
[54:50] blood right we'd say now Hebrews 10:10
[54:54] by the which will we are sanctified
[54:57] through the offering of the body of
[54:59] Jesus Christ once for all and every
[55:03] priest stands daily ministering and
[55:05] offering oftentimes the same sacrifices
[55:06] which can never take away sin ah huh I'm
[55:10] so glad Church that I don't have to come
[55:12] to churches be like well I'm really not
[55:13] going to help the people today my
[55:15] ministry's not gonna help the people
[55:16] today but I can govern the New Testament
[55:18] say my ministry God can use my ministry
[55:21] to take the sins away praise God amen
[55:24] the blood of Christ or the blood of
[55:25] bulls and goats couldn't do that all
[55:27] their ministry could never produce this
[55:30] people all sins forgiven but today in
[55:32] the New Testament under the Melchizedek
[55:34] Priesthood we can preach and church we
[55:37] can leave here perfect amen Oh through
[55:40] the blood
[55:41] of God's own son Amen hallelujah oh
[55:44] thank God well the blessing is to know
[55:46] our labor is not in vain in the Lord
[55:48] Amen you can come in here feeling guilty
[55:52] you can walk out purged you can walk out
[55:54] clean you can walk off with a clear
[55:56] conscience Amen
[55:57] free from dead works and guilt and shame
[55:59] that's what the power of this bread does
[56:02] amen
[56:03] week after week month after month year
[56:04] after year amen see sins were covered
[56:07] but never taken away verse 11 and 12
[56:13] yeah first of all but this man after he
[56:17] had offered one sacrifice for sins
[56:18] forever sat down on the right hand of
[56:20] God now verse 14 for by one offering you
[56:24] have perfected forever them that are
[56:26] sanctified hallelujah so see sins were
[56:31] covered but never taken away praise God
[56:37] they can never take sins away alright
[56:41] next and now the Bible says Colossians
[56:44] 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and
[56:47] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[56:49] quickened together with him having
[56:50] forgiven you all trespasses amen this
[56:55] blood does away with all of it the blood
[56:57] of bulls and goats can never take it
[56:59] away but now it's taken all out of the
[57:01] way see Satan doesn't like that right
[57:03] Satan doesn't like for you to hear that
[57:05] all your sins are taken away they're not
[57:07] covered they're taken away praise God
[57:09] amen it's kind of the trash right you
[57:12] put your trash in your container right
[57:14] you everybody have a trash container at
[57:15] their house you got to push it out to
[57:17] the road or your trash is in there all
[57:19] week and if you open the lid oh man
[57:21] close it well at least at least that's
[57:23] how mine is how much curse
[57:25] maybe you got clean trash or something
[57:27] but our trash lays there covered all not
[57:30] but thank goodness for the trash man
[57:32] hallelujah thank goodness for Friday
[57:34] morning when he takes away all my trash
[57:36] amen that's what Christ did Christ came
[57:39] and then all this trash under the Old
[57:40] Testament all this trash it was just
[57:42] covered over its stank it was awful but
[57:45] the blood of Jesus Christ was our trash
[57:47] pick her up her and he took all the
[57:49] trash and carried it all the way praise
[57:51] God
[57:52] now we're clean now we feel clean and
[57:54] now we don't feel clean because there's
[57:56] no more evidence of any trash amen
[57:59] oh thank you Jesus there's no more
[58:02] evidence it's done take it away Oh
[58:05] hallelujah now it just says I'm not
[58:10] gonna go through this again but I just
[58:11] want to show again or just reiterate
[58:13] it's just it's your you know your sin
[58:16] your so is your will or desire or free
[58:19] more agency that chooses one or the
[58:21] other and I want to show the quotes but
[58:25] I don't actually don't have them ready
[58:26] right now so I have to show those later
[58:28] now I want to get to that this little
[58:30] thought again about soul rest so with
[58:35] soul rest it must be true that the Old
[58:37] Testament Saints could not truly have
[58:38] rest for their souls or else Jesus would
[58:41] not a preacher to rest in Matthew 11
[58:44] right jesus said come unto me all that
[58:46] we're heavy laden
[58:47] I'll give you what rest to your souls
[58:50] okay so under the Old Testament souls
[58:53] could not rest
[58:54] they were seen so that now they just it
[58:59] was just their human will was just
[59:00] wanting to do something hit their human
[59:02] will it was their will their will their
[59:04] will yet they had faith but Jesus said
[59:08] I'm gonna give you rest
[59:10] they still labored spiritually in their
[59:13] souls somehow this thought connects to
[59:15] zekiel 36:27 states God's Spirit will
[59:18] cause you to keep my commands so see in
[59:21] the Old Testament they couldn't rest but
[59:23] now you can rest because now if in the
[59:25] New Testament God's spirits in your soul
[59:28] working through you praise God it's not
[59:30] it's not me it's God working through me
[59:33] praise God that's what that's what
[59:35] Ezekiel said and that's what they needed
[59:37] that's what Joel 1 that's what David 1 I
[59:38] want someone to come and put his hand on
[59:42] God and hand on me and give us unity and
[59:44] harmony in other words I want God to
[59:47] come work for me praise God amen
[59:49] and that's what the Bible said in
[59:51] Ezekiel my spirit will cause you to keep
[59:54] my commands you can rest I'll work my
[59:59] will will be done not your will done you
[1:00:01] have to try to work your way to heaven
[1:00:02] I'll get you to heaven that's right
[1:00:06] because that's where Jesus said it come
[1:00:09] unto me all that labor and heavy laden
[1:00:10] and I will give you rest take my yoke
[1:00:11] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[1:00:13] and lowly in heart and you shall find
[1:00:15] rest unto your souls now here's the
[1:00:17] beautiful this ties it all together
[1:00:18] right here and it's beautiful
[1:00:19] why would Jesus say your soul needs rest
[1:00:22] cuz it says right here for if Jesus does
[1:00:24] Joshua had given them rest then would he
[1:00:28] not afterward have spoken him another
[1:00:29] rest day another day there remaineth
[1:00:32] therefore arrests of the People of God
[1:00:34] so in the Old Testament they their rest
[1:00:36] was getting in the Canaan's land but the
[1:00:38] Bible said they remained the rest for he
[1:00:42] that has entered into his rest he have
[1:00:44] also cease from his own works as God did
[1:00:48] from his see when the soul gets born
[1:00:52] again the New Testament is no longer the
[1:00:54] sole doing its own will oh I want to do
[1:00:56] this I want to try to do this for God
[1:00:57] I want you that forgot no when the Holy
[1:01:00] Ghost comes in you let God do what he
[1:01:02] wants to do brings God amen
[1:01:04] jesus said I always do that which
[1:01:05] pleases who me know the father what
[1:01:09] should your life be what's your
[1:01:10] testimony be I don't do it pleases me I
[1:01:13] do what pleases the father that's soul
[1:01:17] rest
[1:01:17] they couldn't have that in the Old
[1:01:19] Testament they could obey and keep God's
[1:01:21] word to a great degree but they can
[1:01:23] never have it like the New Testament
[1:01:25] praise God that's right it has to be
[1:01:28] that way because that's what it says
[1:01:29] right here Jesus that I'm coming to give
[1:01:31] rest to your souls so you will stop
[1:01:33] trying to do it yourself all right
[1:01:38] and then think of the times I just read
[1:01:43] it this morning was it I was trying to
[1:01:50] get the second time Abraham lied I think
[1:01:52] he'd already had Isaac no yeah I didn't
[1:01:54] have Isaac yet okay he didn't have it
[1:01:56] yet but God had just visited him and
[1:01:58] changed his name and God visit him at
[1:02:00] the tent and he interceded then Abraham
[1:02:03] goes off and lies to his second king he
[1:02:05] lied to the Egyptian king and and the
[1:02:07] king of Emma's like why did you do this
[1:02:08] to me this was a dirty trick
[1:02:10] and God said still you're a dead man if
[1:02:13] you don't pray cuz he's my prophet now I
[1:02:16] can't wrap my mind around that but
[1:02:17] that's just God's favor right there
[1:02:20] Abraham was wrong he was deadly wrong
[1:02:24] but the Bible said God struck Abimelech
[1:02:28] house with disease so the women can have
[1:02:31] babies all because the man he took Sarah
[1:02:35] and was it and he didn't even know but
[1:02:37] God said I kept you from sinning from me
[1:02:40] but Abraham see he was doing his works
[1:02:44] right there's a good example
[1:02:45] he's doing his works well I'll try to
[1:02:47] spare my life now see that proves his
[1:02:48] soul wasn't born again he's he's already
[1:02:51] talked to God so many times right
[1:02:52] chapter 12 you look at it chapter 12 14
[1:02:55] 16 7 he's talked to God face to lip to
[1:02:58] ear and yet he can still go after
[1:03:01] talking to God
[1:03:02] he laughed at God one of the times
[1:03:04] remember that God said you have a sudden
[1:03:06] my Sarah and he literally laughed at God
[1:03:09] Amen you've had some dreams about Jesus
[1:03:12] Ryan and brother branham can you imagine
[1:03:14] laughing at Jesus in one of those dreams
[1:03:16] I can't but yet Abraham did he laughed
[1:03:20] at God in the dream and said am I gonna
[1:03:23] have a son from Sarah right after God
[1:03:27] said it to him and then God keeps
[1:03:28] talking to him and then he has all this
[1:03:33] and God said I'm gonna visit you next
[1:03:35] year and then he goes okay alright and
[1:03:37] then he goes down to Bimala and then he
[1:03:38] lies again he lies again after God tells
[1:03:43] him you're gonna be through Sarah and he
[1:03:47] let Sarah go with another man
[1:03:49] see because he wasn't born again he was
[1:03:53] still doing his own works and a Bimala
[1:03:55] Kassadin why did you do this
[1:03:56] he said we because I made this agreement
[1:03:58] with my wife that whenever we come
[1:04:00] around Kings that she's got to say she's
[1:04:02] my brother and I'm I'm her that I'm I'm
[1:04:05] her brother and she's she's my sister
[1:04:07] so he just stayed in his old ways doing
[1:04:11] his own works but the Bible said you and
[1:04:13] I got the labor to enter into that rest
[1:04:17] we need to enter in the Holy Spirit rest
[1:04:20] where God causes us to keep the commands
[1:04:24] amen in other words God causes us to do
[1:04:27] his will amen now stay like this sister
[1:04:30] Wendy I believe this God do whatever you
[1:04:32] have to do drive me to do your will
[1:04:33] our gods will more than I want my will
[1:04:36] amen that's the real soul of a Christian
[1:04:40] no matter what it costs let me do God's
[1:04:42] will not my will I don't want to work it
[1:04:45] for my own desires I don't want to try
[1:04:47] to work my own deeds and my own thoughts
[1:04:49] I want to yield to God that God's Spirit
[1:04:52] causes me to keep the word that's what
[1:04:56] the Holy Ghost is does that help by
[1:04:59] God's grace it's helping me it's gonna
[1:05:02] open up clear up more as we as we go
[1:05:04] down the road here
[1:05:05] Lord willing if the Lord tarries so
[1:05:08] Courtney Hebrews 4:10 the soul was doing
[1:05:10] its own works meaning its own will
[1:05:13] that's why David Church he can have I
[1:05:16] think he hadn't
[1:05:17] I can't members here seven eight or nine
[1:05:23] wives before Bathsheba I forget maybe it
[1:05:25] was less than that but then he had
[1:05:27] concubines and things like that but
[1:05:29] that's why he could commit adultery
[1:05:30] because he wasn't born again the soul
[1:05:34] the Bible said he despised the will of
[1:05:37] God so in his soul or in his eyes he
[1:05:39] looked out at the woman lusted after her
[1:05:41] and he didn't have that anchor in his
[1:05:43] soul to say no right cuz as a man he
[1:05:47] could have stopped the thoughts from
[1:05:48] coming right he could cast him down but
[1:05:51] he couldn't start to stop him from
[1:05:52] starting right but he didn't have that
[1:05:54] anchor to cause him to do God's will say
[1:05:57] no I'm not gonna go get her he didn't
[1:05:59] have that anchor he was still doing his
[1:06:01] works what he needed was the Holy Ghost
[1:06:03] but it wasn't available yet so God had
[1:06:05] mercy on him amen
[1:06:07] glory hallelujah but now in the New
[1:06:11] Testament now no matter what we see or
[1:06:13] feel whatever in our minds when it comes
[1:06:15] down to making the decision God is going
[1:06:17] to cause us to say no we're gonna keep
[1:06:19] God's word amen
[1:06:20] we won't commit adultery we won't do
[1:06:22] those evil things we won't murder we
[1:06:24] won't do these things why because we
[1:06:26] have God in our souls to cause us to
[1:06:28] keep his will and that's what we want
[1:06:29] hey man I want God to cause me to keep
[1:06:33] his way men that's the beauty of the
[1:06:37] soul in the New Testament does that help
[1:06:40] grace I hope soldiers I hope you're
[1:06:42] being blessed this is like this is fresh
[1:06:45] manna to me praise God
[1:06:46] I'd like one of those Eagles you know
[1:06:48] gather around the carcass just feasting
[1:06:50] on the the meat what do they call it
[1:06:51] when the Sharks all eat fast what's that
[1:06:53] called I feel like it's a feeding frenzy
[1:06:55] here tonight they use all jump in and
[1:06:57] everybody eat as quick as you can it's
[1:07:00] fresh to me it's fresh because I'm
[1:07:03] starting to see this is what it means
[1:07:04] now the next one I'm gonna close with
[1:07:08] this one so I'm gonna keep this screen
[1:07:10] up here till I close so if you hope it's
[1:07:12] a hope you like it hope it's a blessing
[1:07:14] I think I got one more after that yeah I
[1:07:16] got one more okay now have you noticed
[1:07:19] this church the Bible gives all these
[1:07:22] different descriptions of what happens
[1:07:24] in your soul your soul gets filled your
[1:07:27] soul gets sealed Jesus says you're gonna
[1:07:30] be in do with power or closed your soul
[1:07:34] gets closed your soul gets circumcised
[1:07:36] are you mature your soul gets born again
[1:07:39] and that's not even all of them that's
[1:07:40] the only ones that time to prepare
[1:07:41] there's other ones all right the other
[1:07:44] ones are like quicken and all these
[1:07:45] things like that so let's go through
[1:07:49] each one of these risks briefly how can
[1:07:52] your soul get filled it gets filled with
[1:07:55] God's nature because before it's just
[1:07:59] human but they meant it's just a human
[1:08:02] nature what is your human nature do lie
[1:08:05] get angry think evil thoughts right
[1:08:07] unbelief right but when you're born
[1:08:11] again now it's filled with God's will
[1:08:14] God's nature before it's just a human
[1:08:18] nature but God tries to give us a
[1:08:20] picture so it's like a vessel that needs
[1:08:22] to fill with water and that's the
[1:08:25] imagery God gives us now it's filled
[1:08:27] with God's God's nature not our nature
[1:08:31] our nature just yields to that nature
[1:08:34] right we take upon his nature his will
[1:08:37] that's the first imagery so when they
[1:08:40] got filled with the Holy Ghost what were
[1:08:41] they getting full with they were getting
[1:08:43] filled with God's nature God's desires
[1:08:46] and now that's what I put in the book
[1:08:48] that's what proves because the Bible
[1:08:49] says after the day of Pentecost I
[1:08:51] remember this but the Bible said they
[1:08:52] are one
[1:08:53] and one song Oh hallelujah see that how
[1:08:58] could they have one soul
[1:09:00] they had one desire churches if we all
[1:09:03] got the Holy Ghost that's what art is
[1:09:04] our be two to do the will of God it'll
[1:09:08] be with the Saints whether they do they
[1:09:10] stay in fellowship with the Apostles
[1:09:11] they broke bread their prayers together
[1:09:14] they fasted they did all these things
[1:09:15] that's the same thing we'll do if we've
[1:09:18] got the born-again experience so when
[1:09:20] people don't follow through with the
[1:09:22] word of God it shows they're not born
[1:09:23] again because when they got the Holy
[1:09:26] Ghost they were of one soul one desire
[1:09:29] one will amen second the Bible said your
[1:09:35] soul gets sealed oh my I'm sorry before
[1:09:41] that one let me go back did you know the
[1:09:42] Bible said that we are partakers of the
[1:09:45] divine nature and it was in the statute
[1:09:49] vervet man Peter so this is perfect
[1:09:55] brother Ram says your soldier nature and
[1:09:56] the Holy Spirit is God's nature and see
[1:10:00] by the Baptist only Ghost we partake of
[1:10:01] the divine nature Oh mats it's rock
[1:10:05] solid amen this
[1:10:06] this doctrine is rock solid nothing's
[1:10:08] gonna break this amen because it's God's
[1:10:11] Word that's second Peter 1 says we're
[1:10:16] partakers of the divine nature and Paul
[1:10:20] says we're like a vessel we must be
[1:10:22] filled with the spirit sanctified ready
[1:10:24] and meet for the Masters use he's the
[1:10:28] imagery of a vessel I'm gonna fill you
[1:10:29] with God's nature God's will now you do
[1:10:33] my will all right that's the first
[1:10:36] imagery second imagery is sealed or
[1:10:42] marked as God's eternal property now
[1:10:46] this is good because remember if you
[1:10:48] remember the mark of the beast remember
[1:10:49] the Ark of the Beast
[1:10:49] Cain had the mark of the beast everybody
[1:10:52] on teaches the mark of the beast is for
[1:10:54] all generations so see the mark of the
[1:10:57] beast is when the person crosses over
[1:11:00] and they keep rejecting God till God
[1:11:03] knows they'll never do it again
[1:11:04] and so God gives them over to a
[1:11:06] reprobate
[1:11:07] and now they accept the human they said
[1:11:11] I'm only doing my will which really is
[1:11:14] Satan's will yes Lucy
[1:11:18] they're marked because that word seal
[1:11:21] means a mark it means a stamp or an
[1:11:24] imprint and so every unbeliever down
[1:11:27] through the age has been stamped with
[1:11:29] that when they take the reprobate mind
[1:11:33] it's like a point of no return that
[1:11:36] sinners but see when Abraham received
[1:11:38] faith it
[1:11:40] he didn't take Satan's mark he received
[1:11:42] faith he was he was saved his soul
[1:11:45] received the seed of God's Word so he
[1:11:48] had faith but it wasn't quicken yet hey
[1:11:51] amen that's right
[1:11:54] and I hope that I hope that's a blessing
[1:11:56] as well yeah
[1:11:59] if Romans 1 you know it the Bible talks
[1:12:02] about homosexuals and the Bible said
[1:12:03] they because they did not retain the
[1:12:05] knowledge of God God gave them over to
[1:12:07] reprobate mind so God is working so hard
[1:12:10] saying just surrender your will to me
[1:12:13] just receive this seed but then they
[1:12:15] keep letting Satan come down like a bird
[1:12:16] and snatch it up right but God says
[1:12:20] finally okay if okay keep sending seeds
[1:12:23] but if you don't want it then fine I'm
[1:12:25] not gonna I'm not gonna force you so
[1:12:26] I'll give you over you can have Satan's
[1:12:28] mark and God says fine I'm not gonna try
[1:12:31] anymore all right that's the point of no
[1:12:35] return it also talks about in 2nd
[1:12:37] Thessalonians 2 9 through 14 the Bible
[1:12:39] said because they were they received not
[1:12:43] the love of the truth there should be
[1:12:45] damned by believing in unrighteousness
[1:12:46] and God gave them over to a reprobate
[1:12:50] mind okay so the seal is a mark
[1:12:56] it's your price God's your mark the Holy
[1:13:00] Spirit is a sealants you are God's
[1:13:01] property and I'll say like this it's
[1:13:04] also it also means to close up so a seal
[1:13:07] means to mark and close up and it's like
[1:13:11] close up like an envelope praise God
[1:13:15] so God takes the Holy Spirit and he
[1:13:17] seals up his will inside of you
[1:13:20] or will praise God that's the way I put
[1:13:23] it in the book there I think that's the
[1:13:24] best way to put that he seals it up and
[1:13:28] you're sealed to the day of redemption
[1:13:31] and as you and I will soon see in the
[1:13:34] scripture I like this unbelief or your
[1:13:37] will is sealed out when you get the Holy
[1:13:39] Ghost and God's wheel will is sealed in
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:43] so it's marked and then sealed up
[1:13:46] unbelief is out Satan's lies are out
[1:13:49] Satan's stamp is out God seals it and
[1:13:52] it's sealed forever praise God unto the
[1:13:54] day of your Redemption Amen see because
[1:13:57] all the way since Cain either Satan's
[1:14:00] mark or God's mark Satan's mark God's
[1:14:02] mark see in the soul either Satan's with
[1:14:04] or God's will Satan's will of God but
[1:14:06] now the New Testament God said I'm
[1:14:07] sealing it it's a finished work this
[1:14:09] Satan's field only goes he's mine for
[1:14:12] all eternity amen amen
[1:14:15] his will is now my will oh thank you
[1:14:21] Lord amen
[1:14:22] Oh makes me want to shout take man thank
[1:14:24] you lord
[1:14:25] next the soul needs clothes with divine
[1:14:29] power so in other words we are naked or
[1:14:32] powerless without the baptism of the
[1:14:35] Holy Ghost because the Bible says Jesus
[1:14:36] returned in the power of the Spirit into
[1:14:41] Galilee so before that he was naked with
[1:14:45] a power we'd say or he say absent of
[1:14:48] power he was lacking divine power Paul
[1:14:51] calls this the powerless old man Paul
[1:14:54] calls of the old man and then Paul says
[1:14:57] in Colossians 3 - 7 - 10 he said you
[1:15:00] must put off the old man whose works are
[1:15:04] anger wrath malice blasphemy and he said
[1:15:06] put on the new man which is created in
[1:15:09] Christ Jesus a man so you got to put off
[1:15:12] the old clothing right your will and you
[1:15:16] got to put on the new clothing God's
[1:15:18] will and his power God's will is power
[1:15:21] because God's Spirit is his or God's
[1:15:24] will is his spirit okay so some of these
[1:15:28] have some overlap but you see we have to
[1:15:29] use all the images Jesus uses Jesus uses
[1:15:32] filling a cup Jesus
[1:15:34] uses stamping and stamping and sealing
[1:15:36] an envelope Jesus uses taking off old
[1:15:39] clothes putting on new clothes and it
[1:15:41] all lines up with the will and then I
[1:15:46] like this one Paul says put ye on the
[1:15:50] Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision
[1:15:53] for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
[1:15:56] thereof in that beautiful the soul can
[1:16:02] put on the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:16:05] his spirit his will is your clothing
[1:16:08] it's your soul's clothing
[1:16:10] oh my thank the Lord almost done here
[1:16:14] thank you for your attention I
[1:16:16] appreciate it
[1:16:17] the next one is the soul needs
[1:16:19] circumsized and this means the unbelief
[1:16:25] option needs cut off and permanently
[1:16:28] removed on a new you so see we're born
[1:16:33] and we have ours as human will trying to
[1:16:35] work is trying to do its own will but
[1:16:37] that human element of it has to be cut
[1:16:39] off just like a circumcision we got to
[1:16:42] cut off that excess flesh you got to cut
[1:16:45] that off and then once it's cut off it's
[1:16:47] cut off forever praise God Paul said he
[1:16:52] that as a Christian as a spiritual Jew
[1:16:54] having the circumcision of the heart in
[1:16:56] the spirit see in the spirit which has
[1:16:59] to be the soul because it's in the
[1:17:01] spirit amen and the soul is the nature
[1:17:04] of the Spirit
[1:17:05] they couldn't have this in the Old
[1:17:07] Testament and the Old Testament had to
[1:17:08] pin you down and circumcise the natural
[1:17:10] male naturally but now Paul says now
[1:17:13] it's spiritual circumcision amen God's
[1:17:16] going to cut off your will your human
[1:17:18] desires because you don't want them
[1:17:20] anymore and then you're circumcised and
[1:17:22] you're a part of God's holy Covenant
[1:17:25] amen well thank the Lord
[1:17:28] Costin three three I'm sorry Philippians
[1:17:31] 3:3 in Colossians 2:11 say this we are
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:38] which worship God in the spirit and we
[1:17:42] have we have the circumcision of Christ
[1:17:45] my doctors not gonna circumcise us
[1:17:48] Abraham's not gonna the dad's not gonna
[1:17:50] but Jesus Christ is gonna circumcise our
[1:17:53] souls he is going to cut all your self
[1:17:58] will out of you amen
[1:18:01] because remember church the soul has to
[1:18:03] be in a place where it cannot sin
[1:18:05] anymore it has to rest from its own will
[1:18:10] it cannot do its own will anymore it's
[1:18:12] only gonna do God's will
[1:18:14] amen because if that soul sins it shall
[1:18:17] die the soul that sinneth it shall die
[1:18:21] but when Christ circumcised is off the
[1:18:25] will of man he circumcised off your will
[1:18:27] and now there's a that's left is God to
[1:18:29] LA man oh thank you Jesus and now the
[1:18:33] soul doesn't believe this believe the
[1:18:35] soul believes the soul cannot sin
[1:18:37] anymore
[1:18:38] oh that's beautiful praise the Lord
[1:18:46] alright boy that's the preaching along
[1:18:48] and I thought okay all right sorry
[1:18:53] now the next one and this would be the
[1:18:56] last one here the soul needs born from
[1:19:00] above now the word again in when Jesus
[1:19:03] said you must be born again in John 3
[1:19:05] that word doesn't mean twice it means
[1:19:07] from above Jesus said you must you
[1:19:12] didn't say you might want to consider it
[1:19:14] said you might want to you might want to
[1:19:15] consider going the holiest of holies
[1:19:17] sometimes you might want to consider no
[1:19:18] he's saying you must go in there the
[1:19:21] veil is gonna be torn you must go into
[1:19:23] God's presence amen see a birth is a
[1:19:27] bringing forth a start of a new life
[1:19:29] your first birth from your mom's womb is
[1:19:31] your natural birth but Christ promised
[1:19:33] and required a heavenly birth for your
[1:19:35] soul saying you must be born again
[1:19:37] in the Greek again means from above your
[1:19:40] body birth on earth was your first birth
[1:19:43] through your father's corruptible seed
[1:19:44] but your soul's birth from heaven is
[1:19:47] another birth experience amen glory it's
[1:19:50] another coming form it
[1:19:51] another bringing forth through your
[1:19:55] heavenly father seed oh thank the Lord
[1:19:59] amen in first Peter 3 it plainly states
[1:20:02] being born again not of corruptible seed
[1:20:04] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[1:20:06] which liveth them by forever your body
[1:20:08] will die in perish but your soul live
[1:20:10] eternally because it is God's own life
[1:20:12] or his own seed and first John 3:9 this
[1:20:16] is beautiful
[1:20:17] says this and it's undeniable it says
[1:20:19] your soul cannot sin because it's seed
[1:20:22] life is from God a man who suffers born
[1:20:27] of God does not commit sin it cannot
[1:20:31] disbelieve because it's a seed of faith
[1:20:34] in the head it's a living see it's a
[1:20:37] living attribute of God's own spirit
[1:20:39] it's a seed of eternal life amen
[1:20:42] it cannot disbelieve anymore it only
[1:20:45] believes praise God glory for his seed
[1:20:50] remaineth in him for he cannot sin
[1:20:53] because he is born of God amen
[1:20:58] the Apostle Paul taught is flesh and
[1:21:01] mind sin but not himself his soul Romans
[1:21:07] 717 now then it is no more I that do it
[1:21:11] the seed of God but sin that dwelleth in
[1:21:16] me so see that's how we can say this
[1:21:22] this we're the soul that sinneth shall
[1:21:24] die well Christians don't sin in their
[1:21:26] soul and I'll go on record as saying
[1:21:30] this if you and I wait long enough on
[1:21:33] every question our lives God will give
[1:21:36] us the right way if we'll just wait on
[1:21:38] it he'll speak it to our soul because
[1:21:41] that's what the soul is there for the
[1:21:43] soul is there to choose the right or
[1:21:46] wrong way it's your own for your more
[1:21:48] agency but when you get born again it
[1:21:51] cuts off your will because circumcised
[1:21:54] is your desires and now you've only got
[1:21:57] God's desires and if you and I get on
[1:22:00] our knees like our brother saying and
[1:22:02] saying about and prayed about if we get
[1:22:04] our knees and shut the door
[1:22:05] you know God's gonna give us the answer
[1:22:07] because we that's all we can accept we
[1:22:09] can't he the Spirit will cause us to do
[1:22:12] God's will that's the beauty of the New
[1:22:15] Testament that we can choose to let God
[1:22:20] come in and God will cause us to keep
[1:22:22] his commands because God said long ago
[1:22:24] God said I just don't want to be in the
[1:22:26] temple he said I want to be in them I
[1:22:28] want to walk in them I want to talk in
[1:22:30] them before they speak I'll answer amen
[1:22:32] that's what he wants a man possession
[1:22:35] hallelujah he wants oneness with his
[1:22:37] children praise God
[1:22:38] hey bad mother he'd be wondering what
[1:22:41] he'd be it's amazing he want to be one
[1:22:43] with a person like me like a person like
[1:22:45] you but yet he does because you don't
[1:22:48] want to do your will you don't want to
[1:22:50] do Satan's will you want to do his will
[1:22:53] praise God he born again born from above
[1:22:58] so it can be born again a second time
[1:23:01] because it's a spiritual birth the first
[1:23:03] birth is natural the second birth is
[1:23:04] spiritual but in context Jesus said that
[1:23:07] this birth was not of the earth this
[1:23:09] birth is from heaven Oh glory and I love
[1:23:12] this church and then you come in like
[1:23:14] boat around said you come in with the
[1:23:16] baptism of all he goes shouting speaking
[1:23:18] slobberin speaking in tongues praising
[1:23:21] God crying screaming praise the Lord
[1:23:24] because the Bible says when God sent
[1:23:26] forth the spirit of his son in your
[1:23:27] hearts you started crying daddy daddy
[1:23:30] father father where we see it was God's
[1:23:34] God birthed you into the kingdom of God
[1:23:36] amen
[1:23:37] hallelujah thank the Lord that's why
[1:23:41] we're been said we got to be born again
[1:23:43] he said we've got to be born the
[1:23:45] old-fashioned way
[1:23:46] like the day of Pentecost amen when the
[1:23:49] spirit came in the sea it cut off it cut
[1:23:52] off them with the desires of the flesh
[1:23:53] and now God's desires and their nice act
[1:23:56] daddy I want your will I'm willing to
[1:23:58] pray for you I would do it you were all
[1:24:00] the time ah the gods my spirits crying
[1:24:04] for daddy I love you show me your ways
[1:24:07] let me walk in your way Oh daddy
[1:24:09] praise God let's say in our feet praise
[1:24:12] the Lord and because let's keep that up
[1:24:14] there just a moment
[1:24:17] of this your new birth you you become a
[1:24:19] new creature because just like when
[1:24:22] you're born it's like when we saw I saw
[1:24:24] my babies come out there are new
[1:24:25] creatures now Maya we have a new
[1:24:27] creature out here
[1:24:29] Lydia's crying Malachi his crying
[1:24:31] screaming I got a new creature right
[1:24:33] here
[1:24:34] well then Paul says when you're born
[1:24:36] from heaven he said therefore if any man
[1:24:38] be in Christ he's a new creature and you
[1:24:42] come out crying and snot and praise the
[1:24:44] Lord because your soul has had a new
[1:24:49] your real soul has been brought forth
[1:24:51] you're real you're your real will your
[1:24:54] real desires have been manifested in
[1:24:57] Breaux of course now old things are
[1:25:00] passed away behold all things are become
[1:25:08] thank you Lord that I could be born from
[1:25:12] heaven and that now I don't want to do
[1:25:15] Jesse Smith's will I want to pray and
[1:25:17] wait and I say father where do you want
[1:25:19] me to do about it well I make mistakes
[1:25:22] sometimes sure indeed we all do we all
[1:25:24] make mistakes from the mind or from the
[1:25:25] flesh but ultimately when it comes down
[1:25:29] and God's gonna show us what we should
[1:25:30] have done and the whole time it was
[1:25:32] accessible to us if we just would have
[1:25:35] waited upon it and listened to God in
[1:25:37] the still small voice of our soul you
[1:25:40] believe that the Bible says we are born
[1:25:45] again not of the will of blood not of
[1:25:47] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[1:25:49] man but of God born again of the will of
[1:25:54] God God foreknew you'd love him praise
[1:25:57] God so he made a way you could be born
[1:25:58] again alright let's have our brothers
[1:26:00] and sisters come here to the the music
[1:26:03] here I hope that was a blessing was that
[1:26:07] okay oh my that was a refreshing to your
[1:26:10] heart that was to me that's fresh meat
[1:26:12] praise God I've I've never preached so
[1:26:14] deep on this I was telling brother
[1:26:15] Steven after service there I said I just
[1:26:18] I just rejoice in the Word of God that
[1:26:22] message thirst 1965 I was I'm about an
[1:26:25] hour through it just going slowly real
[1:26:26] through that has just changed my whole
[1:26:28] thinking on the soul to think
[1:26:30] whole time and is almost twenty years
[1:26:32] and the message of that one servant
[1:26:34] right there contains secrets that would
[1:26:37] help me understand the soul when before
[1:26:40] I just thought well it's only either
[1:26:41] either diviner or diviner lost if I'm
[1:26:44] lost but now we see free mower agencies
[1:26:47] their desires their wills their and that
[1:26:52] soul must have rest that soul must be
[1:26:55] circumcised must be filled must be born
[1:26:58] from above oh my what a blessing praise
[1:27:01] God how do I say Lord purify my soul
[1:27:06] maybe tonight race maybe it says Lord
[1:27:09] purged my conscience from Mike from any
[1:27:12] sin I've done raised God because that
[1:27:14] couldn't happen under the Old Testament
[1:27:16] they could kill and kill and kill they
[1:27:18] could pour the blood out they could
[1:27:19] sprinkle the blood everywhere and it
[1:27:21] only purified their flesh the church
[1:27:23] members can never walk out feeling pure
[1:27:25] but you and I can walk out pure you
[1:27:27] believe that because it's under a
[1:27:29] greater blood praise God
[1:27:31] it's under God's old blood let's pray
[1:27:34] whatever your need is our Father Abba
[1:27:37] Father can handle it for us your Lord we
[1:27:42] thank you again for tonight lord thank
[1:27:44] you for your word what a refreshing that
[1:27:46] Lord is my just opening here please Lord
[1:27:49] remind me to go back and listen this so
[1:27:51] I can write it correctly Lord that other
[1:27:53] people might understand these things
[1:27:55] Lord God your Bible tells us to grow in
[1:27:59] knowledge to grow in understanding your
[1:28:02] Bible says the spirit searches the deep
[1:28:04] things aim the Holy Spirit doesn't stay
[1:28:07] on the surface it goes down deep into
[1:28:09] the word yay the deep things of God the
[1:28:15] Lord of proves that we're not we're
[1:28:16] going to be complacent staying on the
[1:28:18] surface surface level understanding
[1:28:19] we're gonna press deeper and the things
[1:28:22] of God they take our roots deeper make
[1:28:25] us stronger make us live more holy so
[1:28:28] father I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[1:28:30] every listener today if they've sinned
[1:28:33] Lord they could confess it in their mind
[1:28:35] and
[1:28:36] perched and they could be perfect
[1:28:39] leaving this place in the name of Jesus
[1:28:41] I pray by the blood of Jesus Christ any
[1:28:44] person that needs our pray they'll
[1:28:45] receive a dear God and they can know
[1:28:48] that the Holy Spirit will come and take
[1:28:50] that trash away praise God
[1:28:52] it will just be covered over in the
[1:28:54] garage but he'll be taken away never to
[1:28:57] return what a beautiful time I'll never
[1:29:01] look at trash collection the same amen
[1:29:05] hallelujah not in Jesus Christ often the
[1:29:11] way that the trash collector could take
[1:29:13] all our sins away dear God
[1:29:16] and now we are perfect we are justified
[1:29:20] it's as if we never did it in the first
[1:29:22] place is there no evidence of in your
[1:29:25] gun it's been taken away hallelujah so

[1:29:35] they feel forgiven as they confess their
[1:29:37] sins Lord as I confess mine Lord God all

[1:33:37] just takes it away let us remember that
[1:33:41] in the saw the soul cannot sin cannot
[1:33:45] sin the thing to do is get Christ in the
[1:33:48] soul get his spear there it will cause
[1:33:50] you to do God's will that's why those
[1:33:52] Matthew 7 workers of iniquity

[1:33:57] do the will of my father there it is
[1:33:59] right there

[1:34:02] soul was not surrendered to God's will
