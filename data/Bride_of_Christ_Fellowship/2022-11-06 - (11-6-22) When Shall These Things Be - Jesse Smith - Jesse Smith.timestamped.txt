[35:50] bless the preaching in our prayers oh
[35:51] God afterwards we'll give you thanks for
[35:54] everything that goes on today to magnify
[35:56] the name of Jesus in Christ's name we
[35:58] ask it and the Saints said amen praise
[36:01] God let's take our Bibles here to
[36:02] Matthew chapter 24. like to kind of
[36:05] continue last week's thought but just
[36:07] kind of look more General
[36:09] at the order of events here towards
[36:11] we're looking going to the Rapture and
[36:13] of course all the events that come after
[36:15] that by God's grace so Matthew 24 verse
[36:18] 3.
[36:21] I'd just like to title this when shall
[36:23] these things be because that's what the
[36:25] disciples asked Jesus over 2000 years
[36:28] ago when shall these things be
[36:30] and so we'll look at Jesus's answer here
[36:32] Matthew 24 verse 3.
[36:36] here's the question of course in the
[36:38] rest of the chapter
[36:39] gives Jesus his answer
[36:48] praise God Matthew 24 verse 3.
[36:54] let's read this together if we can here
[36:55] by God's grace ready on three one two
[36:57] three and as he sat upon the Mount of
[37:01] Olives the disciples came unto him
[37:04] privately saying tell us when shall
[37:08] these things be and what shall be this
[37:10] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[37:14] world may God add His blessings to the
[37:16] reading of his word you may be seated
[37:18] God bless you you can switch over our
[37:20] episodes
[37:22] some slides I'd like to show here by
[37:24] God's grace
[37:27] if you just keep your Bible there in
[37:28] Matthew 24 we'll try to start there by
[37:31] the grace of God
[37:33] I just kind of want to give you a
[37:36] little look at what Jesus
[37:38] said here to his disciples when when
[37:40] they asked him and I love this text
[37:42] because you know Jesus disciples were
[37:44] the ones who left everything to follow
[37:46] him and that's what we've done you know
[37:48] most recently we've seen it with Austin
[37:49] Lena leave everything to follow we saw
[37:51] brother amen leave everything to follow
[37:54] the lord Jesus Christ we saw sister Sia
[37:55] leave everything to follow the lord
[37:58] Jesus Christ so once a person leaves and
[38:01] forsakes their family they have no other
[38:03] family other than the spiritual family
[38:05] of God Amen and so when these disciples
[38:08] leave they're here at this is right at
[38:10] the end of Jesus ministry just weeks
[38:12] before his crucifixion if I'm not
[38:13] mistaken and they get to him privately
[38:16] they say Lord when are these things
[38:17] going to happen
[38:19] and so then Jesus gives this entire
[38:21] chapter as a uh as an answer to three
[38:25] questions so also we'll kind of look
[38:28] look at this like the a subtopic of
[38:30] order of the end time events before the
[38:32] Rapture and look at some of the events
[38:33] after the course the main thing is to be
[38:36] ready for the Rapture praise God that's
[38:38] that's the main thing anything that we
[38:40] talk about after the Rapture doesn't
[38:41] really mean anything
[38:43] as far as to us really it doesn't really
[38:46] matter if we're right or wrong we do
[38:47] want to be right of course uh if we have
[38:50] the spirit of Christ we have the spirit
[38:51] of Truth we want to believe the truth we
[38:53] don't want to believe a lie or anything
[38:55] false of course no one's no one's equal
[38:57] with God here none of us have the same
[38:59] you know none of us are Eternal none of
[39:01] us have infinite knowledge so we're all
[39:03] growing in the same time the Bible
[39:04] actually says to pray to grow in
[39:06] Revelation to grow in the knowledge of
[39:09] God and that was of course that's my
[39:10] prayer I'm sure that's your prayer as
[39:12] well by the grace of God but there's
[39:14] just some things that from last last
[39:16] Sunday's sermon I kind of couldn't get
[39:17] away from so I I thought I would just
[39:19] come back this and we'll look at a
[39:21] little bit more on Russia here today by
[39:23] God's grace and but have your Bibles
[39:24] there handy in Matthew 24 our text was
[39:27] 24 3 and Jesus gives us three questions
[39:30] I'm sorry disciples asked three
[39:32] questions in here
[39:34] and so we want to look at each one of
[39:35] those and uh and then I'd just like to
[39:38] briefly read this chapter I'm a pretty
[39:40] fast talker I'm a pretty fast reader I
[39:43] think so I can go through these kind of
[39:44] quickly and I just kind of want to give
[39:46] you an idea how you know Jesus has asked
[39:49] three questions but he gives the answer
[39:50] and whoever recorded this answer Matthew
[39:53] either either Jesus gave the answer
[39:55] totally out of order or Matthew recorded
[39:58] it totally out of order and the purpose
[40:00] behind that would be to hide it from the
[40:02] eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal
[40:04] it unto babes such as would learn
[40:07] that would be God's motive behind that
[40:09] as you'll see if you ever if you ever
[40:11] have read Matthew 24 you're kind of
[40:13] scratching your head well which one does
[40:15] this apply to which what what is that
[40:17] all about
[40:18] and so uh we understand God is hiding it
[40:21] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[40:23] it's just like Jesus's first coming
[40:24] praise God you know the first prophecy
[40:27] was Genesis 3 15. uh the Lord said uh
[40:32] that that the serpent would bruise the
[40:34] heel of the Messiah right the woman's
[40:36] seed but then the woman seed would
[40:38] bruise his head praise God well that was
[40:40] four thousand years of waiting But as
[40:42] time went on God gave more details it'll
[40:45] come out of the seat of Abraham and then
[40:47] a thousand years after that it come out
[40:48] of the seat of David praise God and then
[40:49] then pretty soon he'd be born in
[40:51] Bethlehem praise God and then Isaiah 800
[40:53] years would say uh he'd be a branch that
[40:56] would write raise out of David and he'd
[40:58] be wounded for our transgressions and
[40:59] and David said he'd cry my God my God
[41:02] why is Thou forsaken me praise God so we
[41:04] see that God gives Revelation uh
[41:07] prophecy and then he gives more
[41:08] information about the same Revelation
[41:10] and that's what's happening today by
[41:12] God's grace we're learning more about
[41:14] these end time events and and trying to
[41:17] understand more about the coming of the
[41:19] Lord praise God and so you know we see
[41:21] the three questions they came privately
[41:23] said when shall these things be
[41:25] what should be the sign of thy coming
[41:27] now the first question was about when
[41:29] will the temple be destroyed because
[41:31] they'd ask him in verses when it or
[41:32] Jesus had said in verses one and two
[41:34] that not one stone will be left upon
[41:36] another
[41:37] okay so when will these things be the
[41:39] temple be torn down that was herod's
[41:41] Temple
[41:42] and number two what should be the sign
[41:43] of thy coming the Rapture and what will
[41:46] be the end of the world Armageddon right
[41:49] Armageddon uh would be the end of the
[41:52] world of man's day and of course the
[41:54] Millennium would be the Lord's Day
[41:55] praise God and so uh we see now verses 7
[41:59] and 8 Speak directly of the events of
[42:01] two thousand years so imagine Jesus
[42:03] squeezed 2 000 years in two verses
[42:07] right two thousand years and two verses
[42:09] so we're going to read this here and
[42:11] think about this church how many wars
[42:13] have there been in 2000 years
[42:16] many many wars how many pestilences
[42:21] have there been in 2000 years
[42:24] how many earthquakes have there been in
[42:26] 2000 years so again Jesus you know he
[42:29] gives us uh these these these prophecies
[42:31] but they're very broad right they're
[42:32] very Broad
[42:34] and so I would take a spiritual mind uh
[42:36] to understand well we're going to have
[42:37] to look at more more than just this
[42:40] chapter right we're going to look at
[42:41] Revelation chapters two and three amen
[42:43] with the seven churches the Gentile
[42:45] churches the Gentile cities at that we
[42:47] have to look at more prophecy Daniel
[42:49] chapter 9 10 11 and 12. uh then the
[42:52] entire Book of Revelation that God gave
[42:54] to John on Patmos you know we have to
[42:57] look at all these combined together and
[42:58] no doubt many many more and then the
[43:01] Holy Spirit as we're seeking God as we
[43:03] see God's face he reveals more of
[43:05] himself praise God
[43:06] Hallelujah as you draw night to God God
[43:09] will draw closer to you praise God
[43:11] Hallelujah that means as Jesus is coming
[43:13] we're going to be Drawing Near as he's
[43:15] coming in the Rapture I'll say I'll use
[43:17] this this visual from up above we'll be
[43:19] drawing closer to him praise God we'll
[43:21] be drawing more and more closer to him
[43:22] when we draw not to him he draws nigh to
[43:25] us so as time goes on here church we get
[43:27] a better understanding now think just
[43:29] from the times of brother Branham
[43:30] brother random thought the end of the
[43:31] world would come in 76.
[43:33] and here we are all these years later
[43:35] see so we have see we have greater
[43:37] revelation we have a great we have more
[43:39] information about the same Revelation
[43:41] praise God now we can see oh there's
[43:43] going to be more birth pains there's
[43:44] going to be more more pestilences more
[43:47] Wars we're going to see all this come up
[43:48] and then we have the pressure of the
[43:50] mark of the beast and the One World
[43:51] Government so we're getting a much
[43:53] better understanding as time goes on our
[43:55] vision gets more clear praise God it
[43:58] doesn't get more blurry in fact it gets
[44:00] more clear all the time praise God as
[44:02] long as you're looking through the
[44:03] lenses of the Holy Spirit praise God put
[44:05] on your put on your uh your spiritual
[44:07] lenses make sure your eyes have the eyes
[44:09] out of the Holy Spirit the anointing to
[44:11] take away any sickness in our sight
[44:13] right any blurriness of our vision may
[44:16] God give us the vision of the word of
[44:17] God hallelujah that we can see exactly
[44:20] what's going on here praise God now I
[44:22] want to read verse 4.
[44:24] I'm going to read fast because I'm just
[44:25] a fast talker my I've had teachers tell
[44:28] me that my students tell me that I just
[44:30] pre talk really fast so forgive me
[44:33] verse 4 and Jesus answered and said to
[44:34] them take heed that no man deceive you
[44:36] this is actually speaking of the church
[44:38] ages as well I'm sorry Verses 4 to
[44:41] um
[44:42] four to eight are the two thousand year
[44:44] Church ages
[44:45] verse 5 for many shall come in my name
[44:47] saying I am Christ and shall deceive
[44:50] many every year there's another preacher
[44:51] from somewhere he calls it he says I'm
[44:53] literally Jesus
[44:54] there was one and I forget which Eastern
[44:56] nation it was there was uh one in Canada
[44:58] there's one in South America a few years
[45:00] ago they just they literally say they're
[45:02] Jesus
[45:03] of course they're Liars verse six and ye
[45:05] shall hear of Wars here we are Wars
[45:08] rumors of War say Russia Ukraine right
[45:09] recently
[45:11] see that you be not troubled for all
[45:13] these things must yet come to pass but
[45:15] the end is not yet now think of all the
[45:17] wars the papal Wars right of the Dark
[45:19] Ages think of all the wars then think of
[45:21] all the American wars from the 17th 18th
[45:24] century on all the American roads the
[45:26] revolution Spanish-American War all
[45:28] these wars right that's just the end of
[45:30] these last two thousand years what about
[45:31] the beginning of these 2000 years the
[45:34] Roman wars
[45:36] look at all these see now uh verse 7 for
[45:39] nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[45:40] against Kingdom and there should be
[45:42] famines pestilences and earthquakes in
[45:44] diverse places and all these are the
[45:48] beginning of Sorrows of course the end
[45:50] of Sorrows will be the seven trumpets
[45:52] and the Seven vials and then the three
[45:54] woes those will be the end of Sorrow
[45:56] those will be the final pouring out of
[45:58] God's Wrath on a wicked generation that
[46:00] would not seek the Holy Ghost
[46:02] that is the end of Sorrows right and
[46:04] then a new a new day amen A New Earth is
[46:07] birthed out of that praise God the
[46:09] Millennium praise God that's the new
[46:10] birth amen it's birthing the Earth has
[46:13] to go through these pains to bring forth
[46:15] A New Earth praise God a new Heaven and
[46:17] new earth the Bible says praise God Amen
[46:19] that's right
[46:21] now once we get to verse 9 now we have
[46:23] some new
[46:25] prophecy to those three questions
[46:27] then shall they deliver you up to be
[46:29] afflicted and shall kill you and you
[46:31] should be hated of all Nations for my
[46:33] name's sake now that's that looks like
[46:35] uh uh the answer to uh the end of the
[46:37] world
[46:38] remember how Russia and the kings of the
[46:40] East are going to come against Israel we
[46:42] read that last week
[46:43] I know it's a lot to remember there's a
[46:44] lot happening this week
[46:46] for everybody's life right Ezekiel 38
[46:48] and 39.
[46:50] they're going to come up and try to uh
[46:52] try to kill them
[46:53] now verse 10 and then shall many be
[46:56] offended and shall betray one another
[46:57] and shall hate one another and many
[46:59] false prophets shall rise and shall
[47:01] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[47:03] bow in the love of many shall wax quote
[47:05] now actually verse 11 we actually apply
[47:06] in verse 11 and 12 we actually apply
[47:08] that to the church ages brother Brandon
[47:09] does
[47:10] verse 13 but he that endure unto the end
[47:13] the same shall be saved verse 14. now
[47:16] here we get now this goes back here to
[47:18] uh the the 2000 Church ages and this
[47:21] Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached
[47:23] in all the king I'm sorry in all the
[47:25] world for a witness unto all nations
[47:27] then shall the End come now that should
[47:30] remind us of Revelation chapter 10 where
[47:32] John said eat the book and you go
[47:34] prophesy again to Every Nation Kindred
[47:37] people tongue and try praise God
[47:40] see how there's just there's different
[47:41] prophecies there's different there's
[47:43] three different prophecies in here and
[47:45] you have to line them up the right way
[47:48] all right
[47:50] now I guess in verse 9 you could even
[47:51] apply that to the wise and foolish
[47:53] version when the squeeze comes down I
[47:54] guess you could apply that
[47:56] so again I I'm I'm not saying I have the
[47:59] perfect understanding of this chapter
[48:00] I'm just gonna let you know as you'll
[48:01] see there's different there's three
[48:03] prophecies that are being fulfilled and
[48:04] it seems the answers are all spread out
[48:06] in here
[48:07] now verse 15.
[48:09] now look at 15 here we go to the Jews
[48:12] when ye therefore see the abomination of
[48:15] desolation spoken of in Daniel the pro
[48:17] I'm sorry of by the Daniel the Prophet
[48:19] was Daniel in the chapter nine stand the
[48:21] holy place whoso readeth let him
[48:23] understand now Daniel 12 actually says
[48:25] this takes place 30 days after the
[48:28] Covenant is broken between Israel and
[48:30] Rome
[48:31] so look Jesus goes he's talking about
[48:33] the Rapture or the Gentile and then he
[48:34] goes right to three and a half years
[48:36] after that
[48:38] right the end of the world
[48:41] verse 16 then let them which be in Judea
[48:44] flee into the mountains let him which is
[48:46] in on the housetop not come down to take
[48:48] anything out of his house neither let
[48:50] him which is in the field return back to
[48:52] take his clothes and wound to them that
[48:53] are with child to them that give suck in
[48:56] those days but pray that your flight be
[48:58] not in the winter neither on the Sabbath
[49:00] day
[49:01] now that's interesting I've always
[49:03] applied this to when the temple was
[49:05] destroyed
[49:06] because Broadway says it doesn't matter
[49:08] when the Rapture takes place if it's
[49:09] summer winter
[49:10] that doesn't matter it's not about
[49:12] physically Rapture it's a spiritual
[49:14] Rapture praise God right it's a meeting
[49:16] in the air god changes your body so see
[49:18] again here is prophecy about the temple
[49:20] being destroyed most likely
[49:22] and look he's just hidden right in there
[49:24] whether Matthew's choice or Jesus choice
[49:26] but ultimately Jesus's Choice whether
[49:28] Jesus spoke it like that on purpose or
[49:30] if Matthew just recorded it in a in an
[49:33] order that's not the correct order to
[49:35] hide it from the eyes of the wise and
[49:36] prudent
[49:38] now look at verse 21 now this is
[49:39] interesting for then shall be great
[49:42] tribulations such as not yet since the
[49:43] beginning of the world to this time no
[49:46] nor ever shall be
[49:48] so I don't know if this is referring to
[49:50] when Titus came if that was the greatest
[49:51] tribulation I would think the greater
[49:53] tribulation would be at the end of
[49:55] Daniel 70 weeks at the end of the Great
[49:58] Tribulation period that's what I would
[49:59] think when you have the vows again the
[50:01] trumpets and the woes that's what I
[50:03] would think
[50:05] now look at verse 22 and except those
[50:07] days should be short and there should be
[50:08] no flesh saved but for the elect's sake
[50:10] those days shall be shortened
[50:13] again not sure which verse that one
[50:15] applies to
[50:16] I've always applied that to the church
[50:18] ages God has to shorten the day so that
[50:19] somebody save because then the awful
[50:21] tribute the awful Wrath of the
[50:23] tribulation comes but again I could be
[50:25] wrong on that verse 23 that if any man
[50:27] shall say unto you Lo here's Christ or
[50:28] there believe it not for there shall
[50:30] rise false Christ now we always apply
[50:31] this to today right for there shall rise
[50:33] false christs and false prophets and
[50:35] shall show great signs and wonders in so
[50:37] much that if it were possible they shall
[50:39] deceive the very elect and of course we
[50:40] know the elect cannot be deceived you
[50:43] cannot be deceived praise God
[50:44] Hallelujah there's little things that
[50:46] will fall short on you know those are
[50:47] little sins but we're not deceived on
[50:49] those we know we're doing wrong many
[50:50] times when we do those but he's talking
[50:52] about anyone that will say I'm Christ or
[50:54] here's Christ or there's Christ or
[50:55] there's the Messiah or there's the
[50:56] rapture we will not be deceived on that
[50:58] because we have the spirit of Truth
[50:59] praise God
[51:01] just so you know Joseph Branham my my
[51:03] friend I'm gonna call my friend he put
[51:05] that verse out yesterday and said we are
[51:06] the ones with the wrong spirit because
[51:08] we're putting preachers ahead of brother
[51:10] Branham he just said we are the ones
[51:12] deceiving the very elect
[51:14] and I wrote him back I said no sir this
[51:16] morning actually running back I said no
[51:17] sir you're the one deceiving the elect
[51:20] think about that he just called us the
[51:22] Antichrist spirit so I said no you are
[51:25] and it's either one or the other Church
[51:28] to either and it is his point was well
[51:31] you're making a five-fold greater than
[51:33] brother Branham and I said we're not
[51:34] making anybody greater we're making them
[51:36] equal
[51:37] that's how it's always been praise God
[51:39] no one's greater than others
[51:42] I said but God don't send dead men to
[51:44] preach God says living men praise God
[51:46] and show me where that's ever changed in
[51:48] the Bible I said just to make your fancy
[51:50] he keeps calling the prophet is the
[51:52] greatest gift I said just to suit your
[51:54] fancy brother I said brother random said
[51:56] the Apostle is greater than the prophet
[51:58] and I gain the quote
[51:59] I said you could look it up but I'll
[52:01] give it to you anyway
[52:02] since he claims to believe everything on
[52:04] the tapes
[52:05] see I just nah see you see how this see
[52:08] we're the church we're living in this
[52:09] time where it's becoming more and more
[52:11] deceptive praise God fewer few are going
[52:13] to be able to receive it now think about
[52:14] that you just got he's already called us
[52:16] make-believers unbelievers and he's
[52:19] called us demises and now he's calling
[52:21] us the Antichrist spirit and I just say
[52:23] right back that's you
[52:25] because I know where I stand praise God
[52:27] I cannot be deceived because the Holy
[52:30] Ghost lives in my soul praise God it
[52:32] just fires up my righteous thing to
[52:34] Nation so I know everybody just says you
[52:36] know I'll smile on with me and
[52:37] everything like that but I'm standing
[52:39] against it I'm not standing with that
[52:40] that's that's wrong I said I said please
[52:43] stop Whispering your dad and his tapes
[52:45] please stop doing that
[52:46] I just also you can do is bleed for him
[52:48] all you do is pray for them and plead
[52:50] for them said please repent brother
[52:51] please repent and you know what your
[52:54] team made over a million dollars in
[52:55] donations last year the IRS went and
[52:57] audited all these people you know he
[52:59] made more money than Benny Hinn last
[53:00] year
[53:02] guess who made the most money last year
[53:03] or this year with all the donations
[53:05] Joyce Meyer she beat out Joel Osteen I
[53:08] don't know if that's the first time
[53:09] that's ever happened but think about
[53:10] that the preacher America likes the most
[53:13] is a woman preacher because it's a
[53:14] woman's Nation
[53:16] right because they control by sex
[53:17] control and all these things like that
[53:19] Temptation and everything
[53:21] and of course America is like into a
[53:23] immoral woman right 13. so interesting
[53:26] just thought I'd share that with you by
[53:27] God's grace see there's a reason he's
[53:29] saying press play plus pray because he
[53:30] he's got all the tapes right he wants he
[53:32] wants to be the headquarters he wants
[53:33] you to send his ties to him now he says
[53:35] he don't but actions speak louder than
[53:37] words
[53:38] Hallelujah all right now see that's a
[53:41] that's a very relevant verse for today
[53:42] we just got called The False Spirit but
[53:45] I said no you're the false Spirit verse
[53:47] 25 behold I have told you before verse
[53:49] 26 wherefore if they shall say unto you
[53:51] behold he's in the desert go not for it
[53:53] behold he's in the secret Chambers
[53:55] believe it not
[53:57] now look here 27 now for as the
[54:00] lightning cometh out of the East and
[54:01] shineth even in the west so also shall
[54:03] the coming of the son of man begin that
[54:04] beautiful the Rapture is going to be
[54:06] like lightning praise God
[54:07] he's going to come down and anoint us
[54:09] get our bring our glorified bodies and
[54:11] take us up to meet at theophany amen
[54:13] like lightning Hallelujah
[54:15] think about that people may be around
[54:16] you and then they'll see you and you'll
[54:18] be gone in a moment
[54:19] like lightning because lightning you can
[54:21] see it for a moment but then it's
[54:22] banishes but you still see like the
[54:24] after effects on your eyes
[54:26] that's how the Rapture is going to be
[54:27] praise God
[54:28] verse 28 now look another uh Church age
[54:31] verse for wheresoever the carcass is the
[54:35] fresh meat there where the Eagles be
[54:37] gathered together where where the
[54:38] lightning is where the Rapture is verse
[54:41] 29 immediately after the tribulation of
[54:43] those days now he gets tribulation so
[54:45] here he goes into another one of those
[54:47] answers
[54:48] right because the church the church ages
[54:50] we don't go through tribulation
[54:52] right
[54:54] shall the sun be darkened oh that ought
[54:56] to remind you something The Sixth Seal
[54:58] yeah that's right the six seal and the
[55:00] moon shall not give her light and the
[55:02] Stars shall fall from Heaven and the
[55:04] powers of the heaven shall be shaken
[55:06] that's the second half of the
[55:07] tribulation that can't happen until the
[55:10] very end when the trumpets and the vows
[55:12] and the woes are poured out
[55:14] that's right
[55:17] and the Bible says for the finishing
[55:18] verse uh
[55:20] I'm sorry go to the verse 30. then shall
[55:22] appear the sign of the son of man in
[55:23] heaven and then shall all the tribes of
[55:25] the earth mourn see they're going to be
[55:27] trying to kill themselves but they want
[55:28] the God's going to give them over to
[55:30] some insane Spirit where they can't even
[55:31] kill themselves
[55:32] right the Bible says they're going to be
[55:34] tormented for five months with scorpions
[55:35] and all these different torments death
[55:37] is going to escape them
[55:40] see all the tribes are shall mourn and
[55:42] they shall see the son of man coming in
[55:44] the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[55:46] great Glory that's the battle that we
[55:48] come back on the battle of Armageddon
[55:49] praise God
[55:51] we just come and Jesus is leading his
[55:53] bride Jesus just brings his bride comes
[55:55] out and he just pours out judgment and
[55:57] he pours out wrath and he just shows the
[55:59] Earth before he judges him he just shows
[56:01] the Earth this was my bride amen
[56:03] hallelujah this was my blood raw bride
[56:05] and you rejected her and you killed her
[56:07] down through the church ages and you
[56:09] martyred hundreds of millions of her but
[56:10] this was my bride and now judgments
[56:12] being poured out praise God
[56:14] Hallelujah he comes back one more time
[56:16] to show all the nations who his bride
[56:18] really is aren't you glad Church you're
[56:19] in the bride of Christ this ain't a
[56:21] light thing this is the greatest
[56:22] blessing my brother said the greatest
[56:24] thing in your life is that you're
[56:25] invited to the marriage supper of the
[56:27] lamb praise God by the blood of Jesus
[56:29] Christ hallelujah amen
[56:32] Hallelujah
[56:35] verse 31 and he shall send his angels
[56:37] with the great sound of a trumpet and
[56:39] they shall gather together his elect
[56:40] from the foreign that's Israel from one
[56:42] end of Heaven to the other that's Israel
[56:44] the Bible says that later he has to draw
[56:45] them all from the ends of the there's
[56:47] Old Testament scripture that says that
[56:48] as well gather Israel from all the four
[56:51] corners of the Earth
[56:53] now look verse 32 now learn a parable of
[56:55] fig tree that's Israel when his branch
[56:56] is yet tender and put it Forward leaves
[56:58] he shall know that summer is not so
[57:00] likewise he when ye shall see all these
[57:02] things know that the know that it is
[57:04] near even at the door
[57:06] so when Israel becomes mature
[57:09] know that all these things are going to
[57:10] come to pass soon
[57:12] okay well that's not speaking of the uh
[57:14] that's not speaking of Titus that's
[57:15] speaking of uh the end of the world
[57:17] right when Israel's gathered together as
[57:19] a nation the fig tree
[57:22] verse 34 verily I send you this
[57:24] generation shall not pass till all these
[57:26] things be fulfilled now this is the
[57:27] scripture brother random use brother
[57:28] random use the scripture uh that's why
[57:31] he thought that uh the world would end
[57:33] in 1976 because he thought all these
[57:35] things have to happen when Israel
[57:36] becomes a nation
[57:39] how many how many remember when Israel
[57:41] became a nation what year was it 1948.
[57:44] so he said a generation would be 80 80
[57:47] 1988 and did you know there was a famous
[57:49] preacher that said 88 reasons Jesus is
[57:51] going to come back in 1988. I remember
[57:53] seeing the book on the shelves I was
[57:54] eight years old
[57:56] did he come back in 1988 no but brother
[57:59] man was using this scripture oh the fig
[58:01] trees how many times did he sing that
[58:03] the Fig Tree is growing Israel's
[58:05] restoring the signs of the prophets were
[58:07] told that's why he thought the coming
[58:09] would be before 77.
[58:11] and all these things are going to come
[58:13] to pass before this generation is
[58:15] fulfilled but now we can see it's been a
[58:17] generation since 48 right
[58:20] so now we can see that brother man was
[58:22] just doing his best programs uh uh
[58:24] brother's Ministry was to turn our
[58:26] hearts back to the apostolic fathers to
[58:29] finish the mystery of God to show the
[58:31] sign of the son of man praise God
[58:33] his ministry wasn't to actually tell us
[58:35] the day and hour of the Rapture or the
[58:37] year of the raps or anything like that
[58:38] he was just doing his best as a Bible
[58:40] student which Christian doesn't want to
[58:41] know the year the Lord's coming all of
[58:43] us want to know praise God we're all
[58:44] just doing it and he never said thus
[58:46] saith the Lord on 1976 but see he was
[58:48] doing his best to interpret the word of
[58:50] God that's what I'm trying to do today
[58:51] but now we're all these years we're 56
[58:53] years after brother random and the Holy
[58:55] Spirit is still guiding us into more
[58:57] truth amen
[59:00] Hallelujah
[59:04] so see that's we've got to be very
[59:05] careful with that verse 34 is always
[59:07] stumble people
[59:08] I've had different people come to our
[59:10] church off and on saying brother what
[59:11] they've asked me specifically brother
[59:12] Jesse what about Matthew 24 34 brother
[59:15] man said all these things are coming to
[59:16] pass I said well that he never said thus
[59:17] saith the Lord
[59:19] we've got to let brother random have his
[59:20] opinions
[59:22] and that they never said nothing back
[59:23] they just said okay thank you
[59:26] see we can you just cannot make every
[59:28] word thus saith the Lord You're Going to
[59:29] tie yourself in knots you're going to
[59:30] create all these false doctrines like
[59:31] these people do
[59:34] verse 35 Heavener shall pass away but my
[59:37] word shall not pass away but out of that
[59:39] day and hour now look day and hour
[59:40] knoweth no man no not the angels of
[59:42] heaven but my father only that's the
[59:45] Rapture the day and hour of the rapture
[59:48] yes right
[59:51] Church everything is based upon that day
[59:53] because as soon as the bride goes up God
[59:56] comes down to Israel
[59:57] right and Satan comes down to the
[59:59] Antichrist they make that seven year
[1:00:00] Covenant and then we know is though
[1:00:03] those two prophets have three and a half
[1:00:04] years
[1:00:05] 1260 days like everything is based upon
[1:00:09] that unknown day and hour and then after
[1:00:11] that you know they die their prophets
[1:00:12] die they're raised and then there's only
[1:00:14] three and a half more years until
[1:00:15] Armageddon everything is based upon that
[1:00:18] unknown day and hour it's a secret
[1:00:20] snatching away it's going to come in a
[1:00:22] time when they don't win the world
[1:00:23] doesn't expect it it's going to time
[1:00:25] when the foolish virgin don't expect it
[1:00:27] but we'll expect it because the spirit
[1:00:28] of God will be with us amen
[1:00:31] the spirit of God has always prepared
[1:00:32] Believers Elijah Enoch praise God
[1:00:35] hallelujah every saint that's ever been
[1:00:37] raptured every saint that's ever been
[1:00:39] delivered God has always prepared his
[1:00:41] Spirit loving his holy ghost abiding his
[1:00:43] obedient children to escape judgment God
[1:00:46] will do the same today praise God
[1:00:48] Hallelujah he's always done to praise
[1:00:50] God
[1:00:54] verse 37 but as the days of nowhere so
[1:00:56] shall the coming of the son of man be
[1:00:58] okay that's brother Ram's ministry right
[1:01:00] we can see that from those days that
[1:01:02] they were before the flood they were
[1:01:03] eating and drinking Mary and giving him
[1:01:04] heirs until the day that Noah entered in
[1:01:06] the ark and knew not until the flood
[1:01:08] came and took them all away so shall
[1:01:10] also the coming of the son of man be
[1:01:13] then shout now here we go then shout to
[1:01:15] be in the field one shall be taken the
[1:01:17] other left does that fit any of the
[1:01:19] other descriptions it only fits the
[1:01:21] Rapture when's the sign of your second
[1:01:22] coming
[1:01:24] right the second coming it doesn't fit
[1:01:26] when the temple is going to be destroyed
[1:01:27] well they're only going to take one of
[1:01:29] you when the temple is destroyed
[1:01:32] they're only going to take one of you
[1:01:33] I'm only going to take one of you at the
[1:01:35] battle of Armageddon it doesn't make any
[1:01:37] sense
[1:01:39] verse 41. two women shall be grinding at
[1:01:41] the Mill the one shall be taken the
[1:01:42] other left watch therefore for you know
[1:01:44] not what hour your lord does come aren't
[1:01:47] you glad you're watching and praying
[1:01:48] today
[1:01:49] that you could be out there tailgating
[1:01:51] for the football game you could be out
[1:01:52] there uh get uh trying to get over a
[1:01:56] hangover something like that but where
[1:01:57] are you you're in the house of God
[1:01:59] you're telling God Lord I love you I
[1:02:01] know you're coming soon I'm watching and
[1:02:03] praying I'm doing exactly what you told
[1:02:04] me to do I'm obeying your word praise
[1:02:06] God hallelujah amen
[1:02:10] remember Jesus said if you keep the word
[1:02:12] of my patience I'll keep you from the
[1:02:13] hour Temptation that comes upon the face
[1:02:15] of the Earth praise God hallelujah
[1:02:18] you have a thus saith the Lord promised
[1:02:20] praise God
[1:02:21] Hallelujah that's what I'm anchoring my
[1:02:23] life on praise God my soul everything
[1:02:24] praise God
[1:02:26] now
[1:02:27] look at verse 43 but know this that if
[1:02:30] the good man of the house had known in
[1:02:32] which in what watch the thief would come
[1:02:34] he would have watched and would not have
[1:02:35] suffered his house to be broken up
[1:02:37] therefore be also ready for in such an
[1:02:39] hour as you think not the son of man
[1:02:42] cometh
[1:02:44] see most of the world is not going to be
[1:02:46] ready for us coming he's going to come
[1:02:48] at an hour when you think not
[1:02:50] that makes me think he might come in a
[1:02:51] time of prosperity
[1:02:53] because that's that God always told that
[1:02:55] to Israel when you got rich and
[1:02:57] increased with Goods you forgot about me
[1:02:58] oh it's all through the Old Testament
[1:03:00] whenever they get focused whenever they
[1:03:02] have natural blessings that's when they
[1:03:04] would fall away it's always that way Now
[1:03:06] by God's grace we can balance it by the
[1:03:08] grace of God but we also go through
[1:03:10] highs and lows in our finances right
[1:03:12] none of us are just constantly oh here
[1:03:14] twenty thousand eighty thousand hundred
[1:03:16] thousand two hundred thousand I got 10
[1:03:17] million I mean none of us are going like
[1:03:18] that if you are I would have seen it in
[1:03:21] the ties right
[1:03:23] then you're steal from God if you if
[1:03:25] you're not paying tithes no we don't
[1:03:27] desire to be rich on this end but God
[1:03:29] has blessed us mercifully and so we
[1:03:31] thank God for that we try to help out we
[1:03:33] give all of us we help out the people
[1:03:34] that are less less uh less blessed than
[1:03:37] we are
[1:03:39] so he said watch verse 45. now here's
[1:03:41] what we want to be who then is that
[1:03:43] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[1:03:45] hath made him rule over his house to
[1:03:47] give them meet and due season
[1:03:49] so God needs faithful preachers to feed
[1:03:52] us the meat of God at the right season
[1:03:54] praise God
[1:03:56] blessed is that servant whom is Lord
[1:03:59] when he cometh shall find doing so
[1:04:02] think about all those preachers let's go
[1:04:03] back to 1977. think about all those
[1:04:05] preachers Karen and Laura saw they were
[1:04:08] just they were taking brother Adam's
[1:04:09] ideas and making it thus at the Lord and
[1:04:12] they warned all those people the Rapture
[1:04:13] is coming were they given the Rapture is
[1:04:15] coming by next year were they giving
[1:04:16] them meet and seas in church no
[1:04:19] that think about that was that meat in
[1:04:21] season
[1:04:22] like you got let's say it's October you
[1:04:24] got two more months and the Rapture is
[1:04:25] going to happen by set by 77.
[1:04:27] was that meat in due season no what
[1:04:30] would have been the meat in that new
[1:04:31] season well get the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:04:33] getting three would get Justified
[1:04:35] sanctify fill with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:37] that's all the meat for the season so
[1:04:39] see church that's why we can't just get
[1:04:41] we can't get our eyes off of what's most
[1:04:43] important we got to keep focused on
[1:04:45] loving the Lord with all of our hearts
[1:04:47] Souls mind and strength we gotta we
[1:04:50] gotta trim our lamps praise God this is
[1:04:52] uniting time we gotta we gotta become
[1:04:54] more mature we got to lay in the prince
[1:04:56] of the sun we got to stay connected to
[1:04:57] Jesus we got to bring forth fruit in a
[1:04:59] season praise God
[1:05:02] and the danger is that now is like back
[1:05:04] in 2015 Bengal remember and amen and who
[1:05:07] and uh everybody I was here
[1:05:09] uh the blood moons right the blood moons
[1:05:13] I heard a person who left the message
[1:05:14] this week he was on a podcast he left
[1:05:16] the message one of the reasons he left
[1:05:18] because his his message preachers kept
[1:05:20] predicting the end of the world first it
[1:05:21] was 77 then it was 2005. I don't know
[1:05:23] where they got there from and then it
[1:05:25] was 2015 with the blood moons and
[1:05:26] finally he's like I'm out
[1:05:28] because they don't have they don't have
[1:05:30] any more reasons
[1:05:31] I see Church where was that was that
[1:05:33] message Church giving them the meet and
[1:05:35] due season
[1:05:36] no
[1:05:37] no
[1:05:39] but see I desire to give you the meat in
[1:05:41] due season praise God and I believe God
[1:05:43] has helped me to do that praise God and
[1:05:45] if he hasn't somebody like I told on
[1:05:46] Wednesday somebody come let me know
[1:05:48] praise God
[1:05:49] so I don't want to get your eyes off the
[1:05:50] main thing I'm gonna get your eyes on
[1:05:52] Jesus Christ praise God
[1:05:54] Hallelujah keep your eyes on Christ
[1:05:57] now
[1:06:00] verse 46 blessed is that servant whom
[1:06:03] his Lord when he cometh shall find him
[1:06:06] so doing verily I say unto you that he
[1:06:08] shall make him ruler over all his Goods
[1:06:10] but and if that evil servant shall say
[1:06:13] in his heart my Lord delays is coming
[1:06:14] and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[1:06:16] servants and to eat and drink with a
[1:06:18] drunken now see
[1:06:20] that now that we got to watch that too
[1:06:21] because I told you last week I don't
[1:06:23] feel like the Rapture is any day now and
[1:06:25] someone might be confused and say well
[1:06:27] you say he's delaying his coming
[1:06:28] no I'm saying I don't think I'm I'm
[1:06:30] going to guess it like it's going to be
[1:06:32] next week
[1:06:33] because I don't have that same spear
[1:06:36] because I'm not getting drunk with the
[1:06:37] things of the world
[1:06:39] you see
[1:06:40] they're falsely predicting like Joseph
[1:06:42] Branham and all those preachers they
[1:06:43] said back in March the Lord was coming
[1:06:44] here we are where is he they're wrong
[1:06:47] praise God
[1:06:48] see it's just if there is a
[1:06:50] fear-mongering system to keep them
[1:06:52] empowered keep looking to them keep
[1:06:54] looking at them rather than looking to
[1:06:55] the word of God praise God
[1:06:59] Jesus had been delaying his coming for
[1:07:01] 2000 years
[1:07:02] we want to live like he's coming any
[1:07:04] moment but we also want to keep our
[1:07:06] lives holy and keep serving praise God
[1:07:08] and keep focused be faithful because
[1:07:10] Jesus said if you do that I'll make you
[1:07:12] rule over much praise God
[1:07:14] so once you understand that
[1:07:17] I'm saying I don't believe it's going to
[1:07:18] be any moment because that's what the
[1:07:19] the preachers who are calling themselves
[1:07:21] the greatest of all time they're saying
[1:07:22] it's going to be like now or next week
[1:07:24] or something like that
[1:07:26] and they've been wrong for the last 10
[1:07:28] months or eight months or so
[1:07:31] so I I just want you to understand we
[1:07:33] got to have balance on these things I
[1:07:35] hope I hope you understand by God's
[1:07:36] grace for some reason I just feel like I
[1:07:37] just can't say it the right way
[1:07:40] in other words Jesus choosing to delay
[1:07:42] but we can also be ready for the Rapture
[1:07:44] spiritually by the grace of God
[1:07:47] all right I hope you got us forgive me
[1:07:50] now look in verse 49 see he smites his
[1:07:52] fellow servants eat and drink with
[1:07:54] drunken the Lord of that servant shall
[1:07:56] come in the day when you looketh not for
[1:07:57] him in an hour when he is not aware of
[1:07:59] him now look we're looking for Jesus
[1:08:00] today
[1:08:02] we're looking for Jesus praise God we're
[1:08:04] looking for him to come today praise God
[1:08:06] but our lives are going to stay cleaned
[1:08:08] out to the word of God
[1:08:09] we're not going to let our lives slip
[1:08:11] we're not going to compromise we're not
[1:08:12] going to worship idols we're not going
[1:08:14] to enjoy worldly things we're going to
[1:08:15] take our pleasure in one thing that's
[1:08:17] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:08:20] and if he delays praise God he delays
[1:08:22] but if he comes praise God he comes
[1:08:24] we're ready praise God
[1:08:29] verse 50 the Lord that servant shall
[1:08:31] come today yeah when you looketh not for
[1:08:32] him in an hour when he's not aware and
[1:08:34] shall cut him asunder and appoint him
[1:08:35] his portion with the Hypocrites that's
[1:08:37] the tribulation and there should be
[1:08:39] weeping and nationality well there's a
[1:08:40] chapter
[1:08:41] okay so see
[1:08:43] there you have the you somewhere in
[1:08:44] there you have the destruction of the
[1:08:46] temple which was uh pray that your
[1:08:48] flight be not in winter when you got to
[1:08:49] run with the babies away from Jerusalem
[1:08:51] because remember they surrounded Israel
[1:08:52] and they starved out Israel for was it
[1:08:54] five years they starved out Israel
[1:08:56] and then they slew Israel until the
[1:08:58] blood ran out of the house of Herod
[1:09:00] before they destroyed it Josephus wrote
[1:09:01] about it Titus did awful things some of
[1:09:04] the most wicked things but it was
[1:09:05] judgment because they rejected Messiah
[1:09:08] well you also you have the Rapture the
[1:09:10] sign of their coming and the end of the
[1:09:12] world Armageddon can everybody see that
[1:09:14] all right hopefully you can see that by
[1:09:15] God's grace
[1:09:16] all right so that's a great mystery you
[1:09:18] know God hid uh it's a great uh mystery
[1:09:22] godhead all those three answers in there
[1:09:24] but they're not in chronological order
[1:09:26] all right
[1:09:27] now just re think of some recent birth
[1:09:30] pains I was meditating on this this week
[1:09:31] think of the recent birth pains since
[1:09:34] brother Ram left
[1:09:36] I showed you pictures I'm going to show
[1:09:37] you again these 1970s right after
[1:09:39] brother left
[1:09:40] had a time of awful inflation and even
[1:09:43] gas shortages my dad told me about it
[1:09:49] um and Jimmy Carter ran up inflation to
[1:09:51] the highest it ever was in January 1981
[1:09:54] I always remember that because I was
[1:09:55] born in November of 80.
[1:09:56] and I just remember that date but then
[1:09:59] that awful birth pain like it looked
[1:10:01] like the end of the world did it not
[1:10:02] you've got to stand in line to get gas
[1:10:04] for your car
[1:10:05] it looks like the end of the world
[1:10:07] right
[1:10:08] your money all the jobs are going away
[1:10:10] there's no Brett there was actually
[1:10:12] bread lines and things like that
[1:10:15] but then in 1980 Ronald Reagan came in
[1:10:17] and it became a nation of prosperity and
[1:10:20] I was alive I was eight years old when
[1:10:21] they started the Desert Storm War I
[1:10:23] remember that I still remember going to
[1:10:24] the grocery stores and hearing them
[1:10:25] announce it seen on the magazines
[1:10:27] there's a short war Desert Storm War
[1:10:30] just like Jesus said Wars rumors of wars
[1:10:34] and then of course the Afghanistan War
[1:10:35] 2000 it was 20-year war and then Biden
[1:10:38] left all the billions of dollars of
[1:10:39] weapons there for those
[1:10:41] Wicked people
[1:10:43] they kill Christians and it's just all
[1:10:45] this wicked stuff
[1:10:47] and there was a time of prosperity but
[1:10:49] then the 20 I'm sorry 2008 recession hit
[1:10:54] right with a housing recession it
[1:10:56] impacted the whole world
[1:10:58] but then under President Trump there was
[1:11:00] a time of prosperity the uh everything
[1:11:02] reached its highest level the uh the
[1:11:04] stock market and everything housing
[1:11:06] prices
[1:11:07] and then what happened in 2020 and covet
[1:11:10] happened another enough pestilence right
[1:11:14] and I think they said last time it was
[1:11:15] six million people died from covert
[1:11:17] which is about the same as the flu every
[1:11:19] year
[1:11:20] if there is a coven
[1:11:22] bank and I talk about that something
[1:11:27] but we also saw The Birth the worst
[1:11:29] birth pains though were the mandates
[1:11:32] where you're going to lose your job if
[1:11:34] you don't take this vaccine which is a
[1:11:36] pre-figure to the mark of the beast
[1:11:38] right
[1:11:40] and now we're seeing course inflation
[1:11:41] Rising inflation because they printed
[1:11:43] off trillions of dollars don't go to
[1:11:45] work we're going to pay you not to go to
[1:11:46] work worst decision worst decision they
[1:11:48] can make
[1:11:49] and keep the kids out Works everybody at
[1:11:51] my school and other schools are talking
[1:11:52] now the kids coming down to school
[1:11:54] they're so far behind everybody else
[1:11:56] because they were the generation that
[1:11:57] didn't go to preschool
[1:12:00] and their parents must not spend any
[1:12:01] time with them but I mean I I have
[1:12:03] students that are very Advanced a couple
[1:12:04] of
[1:12:05] because their parents spent time with
[1:12:07] them every day so Church you got to
[1:12:08] spend time with your parents I'm sorry
[1:12:10] the parents you got to spend time with
[1:12:12] their kids if you want them to be smart
[1:12:14] don't push them in front of the screens
[1:12:15] that's what I got today I gotta I over
[1:12:17] 70 of my classes below level in Reading
[1:12:21] it's unbelievable I I just I'm shocked
[1:12:23] I go into work every day I'm like help
[1:12:25] me Jesus and I got the behavior problems
[1:12:26] on top of that I'm being spit on and
[1:12:27] slapped and pulled my tie and
[1:12:30] all these kind of things
[1:12:32] but all because of coven
[1:12:34] it's a bird pain right it's a bird pain
[1:12:36] and now here we have another pain like
[1:12:38] two in a row 20 20 and 20 22. a Roar and
[1:12:42] all the preachers are saying oh this is
[1:12:43] the sign of the Rapture is it the sign
[1:12:44] of the Rapture we'll see
[1:12:47] but let my voice be recorded if time
[1:12:48] goes on let my voice be recorded of what
[1:12:50] I said
[1:12:51] I'm going to make a video on that if
[1:12:52] this goes on and that war ends and we
[1:12:54] just go back to I'm going to make a
[1:12:56] video on this and show everybody
[1:12:58] I'm gonna put the actual preacher's
[1:12:59] videos on there
[1:13:00] see because they're they're not praying
[1:13:02] about these things before they're
[1:13:03] preaching them
[1:13:06] same thing happened in the 70s same
[1:13:07] thing happened just not even 20 years
[1:13:09] ago
[1:13:10] I'm not saying there's going to be a a
[1:13:12] Prosperity but what if time goes on
[1:13:15] something has to happen
[1:13:17] right
[1:13:18] it's been that way it's been this way
[1:13:20] for two thousand years sorry Mercy two
[1:13:23] thousand years wars rumors of wars
[1:13:26] pestilences earthquakes peasants uh all
[1:13:29] all this it's been going on for 2 000
[1:13:31] years we can see they're getting closer
[1:13:35] all right
[1:13:37] now I just have a little just this will
[1:13:39] help Austin lean on those who didn't
[1:13:41] know about Daniel 70 weeks but so Daniel
[1:13:43] 70 weeks is broken up into three parts
[1:13:45] the first set was seven weeks that was
[1:13:48] uh from 4 45
[1:13:52] to about about 500 BC
[1:13:56] okay let me just get these up here so
[1:13:58] I'm done with all the
[1:14:00] all the in build-ins are they're called
[1:14:03] them okay so so the Holy Spirit told
[1:14:05] Daniel Israel has 490 years left well 49
[1:14:09] years was to the building of the temple
[1:14:11] and then 434 years was till the time
[1:14:13] Messiah was cut off
[1:14:16] but then there was a pause and then God
[1:14:18] said I'm going to Blind the Jews I'm
[1:14:20] going to go get me a gentile bride amen
[1:14:22] since they rejected my Messiah says they
[1:14:24] rejected the bridegroom I'm going to go
[1:14:26] get a a gentile bride praise God and no
[1:14:29] one knew how long this would be well
[1:14:30] actually the Bible did prophesy of it it
[1:14:32] said after two days I'll return to
[1:14:33] Israel after 2 000 years amen I'll
[1:14:36] return I'll give you a former Atlanta
[1:14:39] Reign praise God that's right Jose did
[1:14:41] prophesy that I was wrong on that
[1:14:44] so now we've had 2 000 years of seven
[1:14:47] Church ages the last so another in other
[1:14:50] words Israel has seven more years of
[1:14:51] ministry
[1:14:53] okay
[1:14:54] they had 483 years so far in Ministry
[1:14:58] and now they've still got seven years
[1:14:59] left in Ministry did I finish that one
[1:15:01] okay
[1:15:02] all right so does that help Austin Lena
[1:15:05] does that help Daniels Daniel chapter 9
[1:15:07] is so important for understanding the
[1:15:09] end times and if I I may preach on it
[1:15:12] you know again we'll see
[1:15:14] but so important because as soon as the
[1:15:17] Rapture goes that time that clock starts
[1:15:19] it's like God paused the clocks kind of
[1:15:21] like today like with the daytime savings
[1:15:23] you know he just really reset the clock
[1:15:25] well it's like God press pause on the
[1:15:27] clock 2000 years ago on Israel's clock
[1:15:29] they've only got seven more years left
[1:15:32] and that's then Jesus returns and he
[1:15:34] sets up the millennial Temple
[1:15:36] the Bible said Everlasting righteousness
[1:15:37] will come in at the Millennium praise
[1:15:39] God they had 490 years until Messiah was
[1:15:42] set up Everlasting righteousness on the
[1:15:44] earth praise God Amen
[1:15:47] remember there's a six-fold purpose that
[1:15:49] Gabriel's coming remember that we last
[1:15:50] preached on that long long time ago it's
[1:15:52] five or six years I have to break that
[1:15:54] one out and preach refresh that and
[1:15:55] bring it on up to date by God's grace
[1:15:57] now I just want to share a little bit
[1:15:58] more on Russia
[1:16:00] um
[1:16:01] now my wife was listening yesterday so
[1:16:03] my wife gave me this quote sometimes
[1:16:05] when you find a quote share with me you
[1:16:06] might make it in the sermon
[1:16:09] my wife on this call with me and shared
[1:16:10] with me I showed you numerous quotes
[1:16:13] last week wrote brother man made it
[1:16:14] sound like Russia could bomb the USA now
[1:16:16] look at this
[1:16:17] 1961. now but if Russia ever comes to
[1:16:20] United States which is one of the
[1:16:21] leading nations of the western world
[1:16:24] they wouldn't want to blow it up
[1:16:26] they would not
[1:16:28] want to blow it up
[1:16:30] and the church said
[1:16:32] see brother was living in a time where
[1:16:33] it was a very stressful time right both
[1:16:36] racially politically globally nuclear
[1:16:40] Wars right Cuban Missile Crisis
[1:16:43] and so sometimes you make it you'd be
[1:16:44] really stressed out about it other times
[1:16:46] he would say no they're not going to
[1:16:48] invade they're not going to blow us up
[1:16:49] they might know this court exists I
[1:16:50] didn't even know this court existed
[1:16:52] this was preaching Canada
[1:16:54] Alberta
[1:16:57] they wouldn't want to blow it up now if
[1:17:00] you've got if you make every word thus
[1:17:01] say the Lord like Joseph Branham and all
[1:17:03] these people how do you make this make
[1:17:04] sense
[1:17:06] Russia doesn't want to blown up but
[1:17:08] Russia will drop one and but we'll be
[1:17:10] gone moments before it drops
[1:17:12] because we're hiding in Jehovah Eagle
[1:17:14] under his feathers how in the world do
[1:17:17] you make that fit you can't
[1:17:19] you just got to be insane
[1:17:21] to accept it
[1:17:22] they could do it but if they want to do
[1:17:25] it right now or we could or we could
[1:17:27] blow that up see we could we could blow
[1:17:29] brush you right but they'll never ever
[1:17:31] Say Never Never now this is not thus
[1:17:33] saith the Lord I just want you to hear I
[1:17:35] just want you to hear program has
[1:17:36] different opinions about this they'll
[1:17:38] never do what he said well I thought
[1:17:39] this was thus saith the Lord Brother
[1:17:40] Joseph
[1:17:42] you see Church you see how we just can't
[1:17:45] we just can't be deceived thank God Amen
[1:17:48] we won't be deceived amen
[1:17:50] because they would destroy everything
[1:17:52] they want the wealth of the nation and
[1:17:54] that's scripture that is absolutely
[1:17:56] scripture I'm going to show you to you
[1:17:57] again we read it last week I'm gonna
[1:17:58] show you again Russia wants the natural
[1:18:01] resources
[1:18:04] they want the wealth of the nation they
[1:18:07] don't want uh America all burned up and
[1:18:10] and all destroy where they can't enjoy
[1:18:13] the resources of it
[1:18:14] so therefore they'll try to put them to
[1:18:17] sleep spiritually
[1:18:20] and one thing I do not think the war
[1:18:22] will be a missile Warfare oh so you see
[1:18:24] now now he says the war with Russia
[1:18:26] won't be a missile Warfare it'll be a
[1:18:28] spiritual warfare
[1:18:32] you should see some of your faces now
[1:18:34] that'll come and just come in and just
[1:18:37] take the nation over and put them to
[1:18:39] sleep
[1:18:40] oh so we're going to get hit with
[1:18:41] spiritual bombs from Russia
[1:18:44] to put us to sleep
[1:18:46] now not us I'm talking about the nation
[1:18:47] we'll never go to sleep we're Children
[1:18:49] of the day
[1:18:50] yeah let me rephrase that they won't put
[1:18:52] us they'll put the Sinners to sleep
[1:18:56] till they get in and get a hole well if
[1:18:58] they get a hold there and take the
[1:18:59] United States Canada's a small thing for
[1:19:00] them
[1:19:01] now there's nothing in the scripture
[1:19:03] about Russia taking the U.S or Canada I
[1:19:05] showed it to you last week all I found
[1:19:06] is them trying to take Israel
[1:19:10] so therefore there is nothing really in
[1:19:13] the world that we can build our hopes
[1:19:15] upon
[1:19:16] see that's what the preachers are doing
[1:19:17] they're building hopes upon oh the
[1:19:19] Rapture is going to be any day now or
[1:19:20] any week or any hour they're building
[1:19:22] their hopes on that and what happens
[1:19:24] when they find out they're wrong
[1:19:27] what have they neglected in this time
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:33] there's going to be neglect
[1:19:35] because they're not getting the meat
[1:19:36] that they need in the due season
[1:19:39] he says
[1:19:41] there's nothing we can build our hopes
[1:19:43] upon upon any achievement that we could
[1:19:44] give in this world because there isn't
[1:19:46] no hopes for it there's only one hope
[1:19:48] that is Christ it's true so I want to
[1:19:51] thank my wife publicly thank you for
[1:19:52] finding that quote honey you know she
[1:19:53] every Saturday morning she listens and
[1:19:55] she's listening to him in order you know
[1:19:56] from 1960 I think she started and so
[1:19:59] this is where she was at on Saturday
[1:20:02] so thank you darling sure helping me out
[1:20:03] today praise God I just knew that was
[1:20:04] God I was studying on this yesterday and
[1:20:06] she sent me the text right when I'm
[1:20:07] sitting at my desk that's got to be God
[1:20:08] Amen now actually I changed this there's
[1:20:10] five reasons here let me change that I
[1:20:12] did I forgot to do that one
[1:20:14] I said this last week I increased it to
[1:20:16] five there's five reasons I don't think
[1:20:17] nuclear war is imminent
[1:20:20] first they're ignoring Revelation 13 16
[1:20:23] where brother Branham said
[1:20:26] they're fear-mongering us and they're
[1:20:28] ignoring brother Adams pick up the pen
[1:20:29] and write description
[1:20:32] the pickup in Penn says uh that the
[1:20:35] bride members will be forced to stop
[1:20:37] preaching and won't be able to minister
[1:20:39] to the saints that need Ministry
[1:20:42] well how's that going to happen uh if
[1:20:45] the bomb comes while we're sleeping and
[1:20:46] we get rapture while we're sleeping
[1:20:48] how they're going to stop us from
[1:20:49] preaching they're not so that's that's
[1:20:52] what they're saying they're saying
[1:20:53] things like that
[1:20:54] see they're ignoring what brother bam
[1:20:56] said about Revelation 13 16 and he said
[1:20:58] the Holy Spirit told him to write that
[1:21:02] and they're also now imminent nuclear
[1:21:05] war would also mean there's no squeeze
[1:21:07] time which is why one of the brothers
[1:21:08] says it's just a spiritual squeeze we're
[1:21:10] in right now he said we're in the
[1:21:12] spiritual squeeze right now now Church
[1:21:13] listen we've always been in a spiritual
[1:21:16] squeeze you don't think Paul was
[1:21:18] spiritually squeezed when he knew death
[1:21:19] was coming and he had to go give his
[1:21:21] life and get his head chopped off as a
[1:21:22] martyr don't you think he felt squeezed
[1:21:26] every believer down through the age has
[1:21:28] been squeezed but the squeeze we're
[1:21:30] talking about is the squeeze of the
[1:21:31] United States and their nominations take
[1:21:33] laying down the mark of the beast and
[1:21:35] saying if you don't take this Mark you
[1:21:37] can't preach that's the squeeze we're
[1:21:38] talking about that's perfect that's
[1:21:40] prophecy that's Revelation 13. so see
[1:21:43] they got to confuse we've always had
[1:21:44] spiritual squeezes it's always been
[1:21:46] spiritual difficulties but we're talking
[1:21:48] about the one in Revelation 13. so
[1:21:50] they're wrong I believe we're right
[1:21:51] praise God
[1:21:53] now the laws could change overnight but
[1:21:55] they have to be so cruel
[1:21:57] right that we'd already hear rumors
[1:21:59] about
[1:22:00] them taking the life of dissenters or
[1:22:02] the conservatives or closing churches we
[1:22:04] haven't heard any but see with with
[1:22:06] covid we did see some churches close
[1:22:08] now they didn't have to but they
[1:22:10] actually elected to do it
[1:22:13] right because we didn't close we we just
[1:22:15] stopped Wednesday night for a few months
[1:22:16] and Sunday night we stopped we just met
[1:22:18] once a week for a couple months March
[1:22:20] April but in May I put it back in there
[1:22:22] I said well live or die it's 50 days
[1:22:25] it's Jubilee time
[1:22:27] and Ms Pastor cam they never stopped any
[1:22:29] service right but covert went through
[1:22:30] our church because we went through your
[1:22:31] church because we went through almost
[1:22:32] every Church
[1:22:35] right
[1:22:38] but it was a birth pain we could see oh
[1:22:40] here's how the mark of the beast is
[1:22:42] going to look like
[1:22:43] it's gonna be this mandate they're going
[1:22:44] to prep they're going to push it on all
[1:22:45] the media push it on social media push
[1:22:48] it on all the TV screens push it
[1:22:49] everywhere lockdowns mandates because
[1:22:52] they're eventually going to have a
[1:22:53] mandate for the mark of the beast
[1:22:55] cannot preach unless you join our Union
[1:22:59] also the birth Pains of course get more
[1:23:00] and more intense doesn't seem like the
[1:23:02] intensity right now is as severe as the
[1:23:05] government being licensed to kill all
[1:23:07] those who defy the mark of the beast
[1:23:09] just doesn't look like America is ready
[1:23:10] to kill everybody that doesn't take the
[1:23:12] mark of the beast
[1:23:13] doesn't look like that to me number two
[1:23:15] they're ignoring now get your Bible here
[1:23:17] uh they're ignoring the fire in the Book
[1:23:20] of Revelation I didn't really get this
[1:23:21] one studied out last week so I wanted to
[1:23:23] bring this out to you today go to
[1:23:25] Revelation 13 13.
[1:23:41] I want you to show this I'm just trying
[1:23:44] to make a point here now fire is used 25
[1:23:46] times in the Book of Revelation just the
[1:23:48] word fire
[1:23:49] but Revelation 13 13
[1:23:54] is the atomic fire and the church said
[1:23:58] this is the only time I know and I could
[1:24:00] I'm not God this is just the best I know
[1:24:02] this is the only time I know atomic fire
[1:24:04] is mentioned in the entire Bible
[1:24:06] other than maybe the fervent Heap Peter
[1:24:08] talked about but we don't know about
[1:24:09] that that's in second Peter chapter 3.
[1:24:12] but Lydia can you read that for us read
[1:24:13] Revelation 13 I'm putting her on the
[1:24:15] spot today Revelation 13 30.
[1:24:20] thank you
[1:24:22] thank you who does that who's he the
[1:24:24] Beast out of the land
[1:24:26] that's America United States of America
[1:24:28] Satan in the United States of America
[1:24:31] so a br a beast brings fire down from
[1:24:34] heaven that's and that was Nagasaki and
[1:24:36] Hiroshima 1945 where's Malachi to
[1:24:38] correct me on that okay I think that's
[1:24:39] right
[1:24:42] so
[1:24:43] as far when I read the book of
[1:24:45] Revelation I can find no other fire
[1:24:46] verses that come from a he or a nation
[1:24:50] it looks like they're all from Angels
[1:24:52] now could Angels bring like an atomic
[1:24:54] fire of course they could they could do
[1:24:55] anything
[1:24:57] but if there's another Atomic drama
[1:24:59] atomic bomb dropping in the Bible we'd
[1:25:02] have to look for Under Fire
[1:25:04] or something similar to that now let's
[1:25:06] go through a few of these here
[1:25:08] um
[1:25:09] now most of them are before this
[1:25:12] Revelation 13 13. but we'll read a few
[1:25:15] of them here uh Revelation 8 verse 5.
[1:25:18] who's got a sister's name when can you
[1:25:19] read that Revelation 8 verse 5. I'll
[1:25:21] start calling on some people here so
[1:25:22] thank you
[1:25:32] amen thank you now this is right before
[1:25:34] the trumpets are blown so here's Fire
[1:25:36] coming down from heaven
[1:25:38] and it's right after the Seven Seals
[1:25:40] open which is the rapture so this could
[1:25:41] be
[1:25:42] atomic fire
[1:25:44] or this in this case to be holy fire
[1:25:46] which would act a lot like atomic fire
[1:25:50] okay right after the Rapture
[1:25:52] not before after the Seven Seals open
[1:25:55] okay
[1:25:58] now if you go to the net in the same
[1:26:00] chapter verse seven sister who can you
[1:26:01] read eight verse seven this is the
[1:26:03] seventh I'm sorry this is the first
[1:26:04] trumpet if I'm not mistaken
[1:26:15] um
[1:26:17] amen that sounds like atomic fire
[1:26:19] a third of the grass is burned up
[1:26:23] when was last time I see my watches I've
[1:26:24] seen pictures of Hiroshima namas
[1:26:26] Nagasaki I gotta get online and check
[1:26:27] some of those out to see if all the
[1:26:28] grasses burn up I imagine it was
[1:26:32] even the it's even the uh
[1:26:34] even Pompeii remember when the volcano
[1:26:36] went off even that was that even all
[1:26:38] that volcanic ash wiped out all the all
[1:26:40] the grass
[1:26:42] let alone fire from heaven
[1:26:44] now of course that this is this this uh
[1:26:47] Revelation chapter eight would be the
[1:26:48] second half of the tribulation period
[1:26:49] that last three and a half years
[1:26:51] when the trumpets and the vows and the
[1:26:53] woes are being poured out
[1:26:55] okay so that's another case of fire
[1:26:58] in verse 8 it says uh also and the
[1:27:01] second Angel sounded as it were a great
[1:27:03] Mountain burning with fire was cast in
[1:27:04] the sea a mountain burning with Fire
[1:27:07] cast into the sea and a third part of
[1:27:09] the sea became blood
[1:27:10] a third part of the sea became blood
[1:27:13] so there's fire again could be atomic
[1:27:15] fire but the mountain burning with fire
[1:27:17] thrown into the ocean
[1:27:19] how's that going to happen
[1:27:21] only by Supernatural forces
[1:27:23] okay now Revelation 9 verse 17 we see
[1:27:27] horses having breastplates of fire that
[1:27:30] doesn't look like atomic fire uh
[1:27:31] Revelation 19 8 by these three was the
[1:27:33] third party men killed by the fire by
[1:27:35] the Smoke by the brimstone which issued
[1:27:37] out of their mouths
[1:27:39] actually I'm going to get my Bible there
[1:27:40] because it might go a little faster
[1:27:42] Revelation 9 18.
[1:27:53] thank you for your patience
[1:27:56] now church this is what we should always
[1:27:57] be doing right if there's a question the
[1:28:00] Bible has the answer
[1:28:02] right you got a Bible question the
[1:28:04] Bible's got to answer for you amen
[1:28:06] this is the sixth trumpet Verse 18 by
[1:28:08] these three was the third part of men
[1:28:10] killed by the fire and by the smoke and
[1:28:12] by the brimstone which issued out of
[1:28:14] their mouths
[1:28:16] the three what the Three Angels the
[1:28:18] Bible says were loosed
[1:28:22] okay so there we go there's fire again
[1:28:23] now the next one is chapter 10 verse 1
[1:28:26] of course that's right that's brother
[1:28:27] random that's that's the pillar that's
[1:28:28] the pillar of fire and uh The Cloud of
[1:28:31] 1963. now Revelation 11 uh
[1:28:34] verse 5 is fire coming out of the two
[1:28:38] prophet's Mouse which I believe is
[1:28:39] spiritual but it could be natural
[1:28:41] so that's not atomic fire
[1:28:44] uh 1313 of course is what we read atomic
[1:28:47] fire that's the uh two atomic bombs
[1:28:50] 1945.
[1:28:54] Revelation 14 10 is there tormented with
[1:28:56] fire and brimstone that's not atomic
[1:28:58] fire
[1:28:58] 14 verse 18.
[1:29:02] I'm gonna turn there Revelation 14 18.
[1:29:08] this is Armageddon according to Scofield
[1:29:11] and I believe too
[1:29:12] and another angel came out from the
[1:29:14] altar which had power over fire and
[1:29:16] crowd cried with a loud cry to him that
[1:29:19] had the sharp sickles saying thrust in
[1:29:20] the sharp sickle and gather the clusters
[1:29:22] of the vine of the Earth for her grapes
[1:29:24] are fully ripe that seems to be the 144
[1:29:26] 000 gather that last Harvest
[1:29:28] but an angel comes out who has fire
[1:29:31] so again that could be atomic fire
[1:29:34] uh Revelation 15 verse 2 this is
[1:29:37] uh the last seven plagues the Bulls
[1:29:40] and I saw as it were a sea of glass
[1:29:42] mingle with fire
[1:29:44] and then they had gotten because that's
[1:29:46] Heavenly that's a Heavenly Fire and then
[1:29:47] they had gotten the victory over the
[1:29:48] Beast over the image and the mark
[1:29:50] and over his Mark and over the number of
[1:29:52] his name stand on the sea of glass
[1:29:53] having the harps of God that's Israel in
[1:29:55] heaven so a c uh mingle with fire
[1:30:00] sea of glass being with fire Revelation
[1:30:02] 16 18.
[1:30:04] this is the sixth I'm sorry seventh
[1:30:06] vowel seventh wow this is the last vial
[1:30:09] Verse 18 and there were voices and
[1:30:11] thunderings and Lightnings and there was
[1:30:12] a great earthquake such as not since men
[1:30:14] were upon the Earth is that Los Angeles
[1:30:16] it looks like it to me
[1:30:18] and so mighty earthquake and so great
[1:30:22] that was I'm sorry that was 16 18. I'm
[1:30:24] sorry that was 16 18. I'm sorry
[1:30:27] I read the wrong one 1618. there's a
[1:30:30] great earthquake and I'm kind of jumping
[1:30:31] ahead there but I believe that's the Los
[1:30:33] Angeles one I could be wrong it could be
[1:30:35] before the Rapture I don't know
[1:30:37] but whatever earthquake it is it is the
[1:30:39] greatest earthquake there ever was
[1:30:43] what could be greater than that I don't
[1:30:44] know
[1:30:45] okay now 16 verse 8 was where I want to
[1:30:49] go 16 verse 8 the fourth vow and the
[1:30:52] fourth Angel poured out his vowel upon
[1:30:53] the son and power was given unto him to
[1:30:55] Scorch men with fire so an angel has
[1:30:57] power to Smite men with fire
[1:31:00] could be Atomic could be holy fire could
[1:31:02] be the fire of the Sun the heat of the
[1:31:04] Sun
[1:31:05] okay uh now
[1:31:07] Revelation 17 verse 16 says uh the
[1:31:10] mother heart is going to be destroyed
[1:31:11] with fire we know that's Russia brother
[1:31:13] man gave us thus saith the Lord on that
[1:31:15] Russia will destroy Babylon with fire
[1:31:19] atomic fire
[1:31:21] and that's God judging mystery Babylon
[1:31:24] now Revelation 19 12 as Jesus has eyes
[1:31:27] of fire amen Revelation 19 20.
[1:31:30] uh Satan and the Beast are cast in the
[1:31:34] Lake of Fire
[1:31:35] Revelation 20 I'm almost done Revelation
[1:31:37] 20 verse 9.
[1:31:39] is the Millennium fire comes down from
[1:31:41] heaven at Battle of Gog and Magog and
[1:31:44] saves Us in Jesus amen hallelujah
[1:31:48] Revelation 20 verse 10 the devil's cast
[1:31:51] in lake of fire and brimstone Revelation
[1:31:53] 20 verse 14 death and hell were cast in
[1:31:55] Lake of Fire in Revelation 20 verse 15
[1:31:58] anyone not found the Book of Life
[1:32:00] casting Lake of Fire and Revelation last
[1:32:03] one the last fire mentioned in the Bible
[1:32:04] is revelation 21 verse 8 the fearful
[1:32:07] unbelieving abominable are Liars are
[1:32:09] cast in the lake which burned with fire
[1:32:11] Brimstone which is the second death
[1:32:13] now see church I went through all those
[1:32:15] to show you this
[1:32:16] I don't
[1:32:17] I don't know when the other fire atomic
[1:32:19] fire is going to be but I just I listed
[1:32:21] all of them for you there
[1:32:23] could be some of those
[1:32:25] I don't see fire before the Rapture I
[1:32:27] don't see any more atomic fire before
[1:32:28] the Rapture but again I'm not God I
[1:32:31] could be wrong God don't have to tell me
[1:32:32] us God don't have to tell us every time
[1:32:34] there's going to be atomic fire
[1:32:36] he can do whatever he wants
[1:32:38] but with what we know
[1:32:40] it seems like there won't be
[1:32:43] uh see like they're ignoring the fire
[1:32:44] scriptures in the Book of Revelation
[1:32:46] there have a lack of scripture for what
[1:32:48] they're saying oh Russia is going to
[1:32:49] send atomic fire then the Rapture goes
[1:32:51] well where's that in the Bible
[1:32:53] can somebody show me that
[1:32:55] so far the answer is no
[1:32:57] now remember Church the Earth cannot be
[1:32:59] heard until after the 144 000 Jews are
[1:33:02] sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:04] okay number three the current conditions
[1:33:07] I mentioned this earlier feel like
[1:33:08] another birth pain like the 70s and 80s
[1:33:11] this doesn't feel like the squeeze I
[1:33:13] shouldn't say that I got the name up
[1:33:14] there
[1:33:15] okay so this is what it was like when my
[1:33:16] dad was uh
[1:33:18] he would have been in his 20s
[1:33:20] they didn't have gas they said ask the
[1:33:22] president for some there was lines for
[1:33:24] gas I've seen this in Guyana they had to
[1:33:26] do that in Guyana got they had a gas
[1:33:28] shortage when I was there they had to
[1:33:29] line up to get gas for their lawn mowers
[1:33:31] and everything
[1:33:32] and this was what I showed last week so
[1:33:34] it seems like the current war is just
[1:33:36] another birth pain
[1:33:39] and now remember church we could see
[1:33:40] more wars in the future and it would
[1:33:43] still be pre-rapture prophecy being
[1:33:45] fulfilled think about that America has
[1:33:47] gone through two world wars don't you
[1:33:50] think those people thought the Rapture
[1:33:51] was any time
[1:33:53] world wars
[1:33:55] the entire world fighting
[1:33:58] but yeah look what happened after the
[1:34:00] 40s we had the 50s 60s sexual Revolution
[1:34:03] 70s 80s here we are 90s 2000s here we
[1:34:07] are
[1:34:08] I would think of any time there would
[1:34:09] have been end of the world after those
[1:34:11] atomic bombs dropped I thought this is
[1:34:12] the end of the world now everybody's
[1:34:14] going to start bombing each other
[1:34:15] but we could still have the end of this
[1:34:17] war there could be another War think
[1:34:19] about what if the Russian Ukrainian War
[1:34:20] goes on 20 years like the Afghanistan
[1:34:22] war went on
[1:34:25] it would not be outside of scripture
[1:34:26] because Jesus said there's going to be
[1:34:27] Wars Kingdom Rise Against Kingdom
[1:34:31] all right now number four Russia wants
[1:34:34] natural resources go to Ezekiel 38-11
[1:34:36] Malachi read that for us buddy please
[1:34:38] I'm gonna put him on the spot there
[1:34:39] thank you buddy
[1:34:41] he's on the spot with the piano I'll
[1:34:42] just make up some song or I'll start off
[1:34:44] the wrong key
[1:34:45] all right and amen to you know
[1:34:48] bless their hearts
[1:34:51] Sinners don't want to die
[1:34:54] Vladimir Putin doesn't want to die
[1:34:57] president Xing from China he doesn't
[1:34:59] want to die they don't want to they
[1:35:00] don't want atomic war unless they would
[1:35:02] have started one already they have no
[1:35:04] hope for the future they're going to
[1:35:05] hell if they don't repent
[1:35:08] they have no guarant they have no future
[1:35:09] hope
[1:35:11] they want their best life now like Joel
[1:35:13] Osteen's book they have no Eternal hope
[1:35:16] they don't want a nuclear war
[1:35:18] and one one bomb drop would instantly
[1:35:21] start all these other nations dropping
[1:35:23] bombs
[1:35:24] who who be left to stand
[1:35:29] remember Russia
[1:35:31] wants the physical resources of Israel
[1:35:34] remember I need to show you that if I
[1:35:35] can show you that they have pictures
[1:35:37] before 1948 of Israel it's like a
[1:35:39] wasteland there's I mean the there's no
[1:35:42] grass that the waters are dried up and
[1:35:45] then Israel comes back and you should
[1:35:46] see the pictures now it's it's Lush it's
[1:35:48] Lurch or it's flourishing with milk and
[1:35:50] honey I mean uh the buildings and
[1:35:52] businesses everything's fruitful oh my
[1:35:55] God because God's people are back in the
[1:35:57] word God's people are back in the land
[1:35:59] when God's people start obeying God's
[1:36:01] word all these blessings come back under
[1:36:03] that old Covenant praise God
[1:36:06] and that's what Russia is going to want
[1:36:08] the Bible says it so Malachi uh Ezekiel
[1:36:11] 38 11 12 and 13.
[1:36:24] to take a spoiler to take a prey to turn
[1:36:26] my hand upon the desolate places that
[1:36:28] are now inhabited and
[1:36:30] the people that are gathered
[1:36:32] that I've gotten cattle
[1:36:34] in the midst of the land
[1:36:36] Chiba and data and the merchants of
[1:36:38] tarshish with all the young minds there
[1:36:40] are shall say unto thee Art Thou come to
[1:36:43] take a spoil past them gathered my
[1:36:44] company to take a break and carry away
[1:36:46] silver and gold and take away
[1:36:50] thank you now remember if you read
[1:36:52] earlier this is the King of the North
[1:36:53] God tells us hello I love it amen God
[1:36:57] tells us exactly what they're thinking
[1:36:58] praise God just like when was it Elijah
[1:37:01] or Elisha
[1:37:02] uh one of the kings of Syria said how
[1:37:06] does Elijah and Elijah know this and the
[1:37:08] answer was well God tells the prophet
[1:37:10] what you're saying in your secret secret
[1:37:11] Chambers amen here it is God is telling
[1:37:14] us what Russia is going to say they're
[1:37:16] going to want the spoils and resources
[1:37:18] of that blessed land Israel praise God
[1:37:22] they don't want to destroy they want
[1:37:24] brother like brother man said that quote
[1:37:25] Russia doesn't want to destroy America
[1:37:26] they want America's resources that's
[1:37:29] what the quote says
[1:37:30] now I can't find any scripture for that
[1:37:32] but I can find scripture where Russia
[1:37:34] wants Israel's resources
[1:37:36] they've been thinking real hard again
[1:37:38] today praise God
[1:37:40] Hallelujah
[1:37:42] now I added this one the Rapture must be
[1:37:45] unexpected
[1:37:47] this is a secret snatching away
[1:37:49] the world will not be thinking this is
[1:37:51] the end of the world think about that
[1:37:53] they will not be saying this is the end
[1:37:55] this is the end well we better get ready
[1:37:56] Jesus is going to be coming back they're
[1:37:58] not going to be ready for it
[1:37:59] it's going to be an unexpected time
[1:38:01] they're gonna be the Bible says it's
[1:38:02] gonna be a time of night time they're
[1:38:03] going to be sleeping they're not going
[1:38:04] to think nothing's wrong there's not
[1:38:06] gonna be any Rapture they're they're
[1:38:08] going to totally miss it
[1:38:10] but with all this nuclear war talk they
[1:38:13] think it's the end of the world right
[1:38:16] so that's a fifth reason I put in there
[1:38:18] it has to be unexpected
[1:38:21] where people are not looking for does
[1:38:23] everybody understand by God's grace so I
[1:38:25] just gave you five reasons there I'm
[1:38:26] glad this is on a recording there I can
[1:38:28] always go back and update my uh
[1:38:31] my thoughts and my reasons right our
[1:38:33] reasons now remember there's two quotes
[1:38:34] don't worry about Russia I read these
[1:38:35] last week
[1:38:37] Bill said many are thinking Antichrist
[1:38:39] is Russia he said don't worry about
[1:38:40] Russia it's Rome
[1:38:42] Rome is anti-clark Rome is the
[1:38:44] Antichrist
[1:38:46] it's either Antichrist sits right by you
[1:38:47] that's a Deceiver
[1:38:49] of course they're sitting right by you
[1:38:51] there in Jeffersonville but they're not
[1:38:52] actually gathering in church so I
[1:38:53] actually can't say that
[1:38:55] another one was see don't worry about
[1:38:57] Russia Russia is a small pebble on the
[1:38:58] beach don't worry about communism you
[1:39:00] watch romanism
[1:39:01] when it's uniting with the churches see
[1:39:02] that's what we're looking for church
[1:39:03] that's what I'm that's what I'm looking
[1:39:04] for I'm looking for America to unite
[1:39:06] with the churches and Rome and change
[1:39:08] laws in times and seasons that's what
[1:39:11] I'm looking for because that's what
[1:39:12] Revelation 13 says
[1:39:14] and I preach that to you all these 16
[1:39:16] years now I'm going on seven almost 16
[1:39:17] and a half years pastor and yeah you
[1:39:19] know by God's grace that's what I've
[1:39:21] been looking for all these years because
[1:39:22] that's what brother said in the church
[1:39:23] age book spoken words Original Seed
[1:39:25] 1962.
[1:39:29] now let me just rehearse these briefly
[1:39:30] I'm almost done here almost done
[1:39:34] everybody should be feeling at least one
[1:39:36] hour healthier today right
[1:39:39] so you can handle a little bit more
[1:39:40] preaching today
[1:39:42] now I have a video about this uh sorry
[1:39:44] it's it's ours sometimes I say my videos
[1:39:46] are ours but really it's ours because I
[1:39:48] couldn't afford all this uh technology
[1:39:49] without your ties so that's why I say
[1:39:51] there are videos but it's our third most
[1:39:54] popular video only 128 000 but you know
[1:39:56] makeup's our most popular long hair and
[1:39:59] then long dresses is our fourth most but
[1:40:01] so I put all these on that video
[1:40:04] uh seven years old
[1:40:06] yeah so 2015.
[1:40:10] so uh we have thus saith the Lords about
[1:40:12] the driverless cars which I still think
[1:40:14] is future personally because I've never
[1:40:16] seen a family driving down the road
[1:40:17] playing checkers yet but I'm I'm looking
[1:40:19] for it
[1:40:20] I wouldn't even mind if it's my family
[1:40:21] praise God
[1:40:22] I don't like driving I'd rather spend my
[1:40:24] time on better things than driving
[1:40:26] um United States we have Let's see we
[1:40:28] have five six seven Broadband gave us
[1:40:31] seven thus saith the Lords about the
[1:40:32] United States Los Angeles will be judged
[1:40:34] in sync now I showed you where that was
[1:40:35] I think it's Revelation six no I'm sorry
[1:40:38] I think it's Revelation 16 18. that's
[1:40:40] what I think I think that's the worst
[1:40:41] earthquake I could be wrong
[1:40:45] um U.S will take the mark of the beast
[1:40:46] woman will rule United States next major
[1:40:49] Vision I still think that's future
[1:40:51] God will destroy the USA
[1:40:54] God will never have a nation I'm sorry
[1:40:56] USA will never have a nationwide Revival
[1:40:58] USA will have a Peg and Rome like
[1:41:00] persecution I believe that's a
[1:41:01] tribulation that's thus saith the Lord
[1:41:04] America is going to kill
[1:41:07] uh dissenters like Rome did
[1:41:09] uh in the Pagan the Pagan ancient Rome
[1:41:12] time
[1:41:14] and the seventh major Vision that's the
[1:41:16] that's the explosion in America I don't
[1:41:18] that's one I don't know I just showed
[1:41:19] you all the fire Scriptures it could be
[1:41:21] one of those fire scriptures in
[1:41:22] Revelation or it could be the day of the
[1:41:24] Lord that burns like an oven
[1:41:25] where the Bible said they'll be
[1:41:26] destroyed with fire I don't know where
[1:41:28] America being destroyed in the Bible is
[1:41:31] and if any of you uh find out you let me
[1:41:33] know I believe God can speak through you
[1:41:35] I believe God can give you Revelations
[1:41:36] and the church said
[1:41:38] I'm not the only one God speaks to right
[1:41:40] God speaks to you too praise God
[1:41:43] but it has to be it would be like some
[1:41:45] type of explosion some that's where
[1:41:46] everyone said he said on explosion and
[1:41:48] craters
[1:41:51] so I don't know where that one is but we
[1:41:53] believe it's thus saith Lord because all
[1:41:54] the other things brother Adam said thus
[1:41:55] say the Lord that have come to pass so
[1:41:57] far and all the scriptures he gave us
[1:41:58] the doctrines he gave us with us saith
[1:42:00] the Lord that we know are right
[1:42:03] all right now Mark of the Beast it will
[1:42:05] be some form of unionized religion
[1:42:09] you have to agree with the the church
[1:42:12] and the state and brothers said thus
[1:42:14] saith the Lord denominations will talk
[1:42:16] take the mark and I shared with your
[1:42:17] brother on a text of last month I said
[1:42:19] are you ready to come out of that
[1:42:20] denomination I never heard back from him
[1:42:22] but just so you know brother I love
[1:42:23] those guys I told him I love you I'm
[1:42:24] praying for you I said we talked about
[1:42:26] that now it's probably been like five or
[1:42:27] ten years ago
[1:42:29] I said when are you going to come out of
[1:42:30] that I shared it with love
[1:42:32] I always do by God's grace
[1:42:34] it's thus saith the Lord they'll take
[1:42:36] the mark of the beast
[1:42:38] uh now I forgot I didn't have time I
[1:42:40] just forgot I must got busy you know get
[1:42:42] ready for church or something like that
[1:42:43] but there's thus hate the Lord's about
[1:42:44] Roman Vatican Russia will destroy the
[1:42:46] Vatican in one hour it's thus saith the
[1:42:48] Lord revelation 18.
[1:42:50] and then reassurance for Christians
[1:42:51] brother Adam said thus saith the Lord
[1:42:52] the message of Malachi 4 will turn our
[1:42:55] hearts back and we will have the
[1:42:57] fullness of Pentecost in the latter rain
[1:42:59] that's thus saith the Lord Brother Adam
[1:43:01] says praise God in church we're so close
[1:43:03] all we need is a little more power
[1:43:04] praise God
[1:43:06] we've got the right Doctrine we've got
[1:43:08] holy living praise God we got all these
[1:43:10] we got so much of the apostolic right we
[1:43:12] got the baptism we got the godhead we
[1:43:14] have so much we have we have wonderful
[1:43:16] testimonies all year God answering
[1:43:17] prayers all we just need is a little
[1:43:19] more power amen that's nothing for God
[1:43:22] Amen we just need a little more power
[1:43:24] Hallelujah
[1:43:25] and they had power
[1:43:28] where a lame man they could say raise
[1:43:30] and walk and the man got up that's we
[1:43:32] just need a little more power by God's
[1:43:34] grace
[1:43:35] Hallelujah you think that you think
[1:43:36] that's hard for God you think raising up
[1:43:38] a a paralyzed man is hard for God no
[1:43:42] right and brother Brown says that's not
[1:43:44] even the greatest Miracle the greatest
[1:43:45] Miracle is getting the Holy Ghost amen
[1:43:47] being saved amen so see we have power we
[1:43:50] just need a different kind of power amen
[1:43:52] ah hallelujah amen thank God
[1:43:56] I had we had friends come over a couple
[1:43:58] weeks ago
[1:44:00] from the horse Ministry
[1:44:02] and they said we he said something along
[1:44:04] the lines that we've hardly ever met a
[1:44:06] family like yours and they said you're
[1:44:08] our favorite family that they interact
[1:44:09] with
[1:44:10] no I wasn't trying to be we're not
[1:44:12] trying to be the favorites we just love
[1:44:13] Jesus
[1:44:14] but that's a man and he said I work he
[1:44:16] said I have meetings weekly with all
[1:44:18] these Millionaires and these Christians
[1:44:19] and of all that he looks at our family
[1:44:21] he said he said there's something
[1:44:23] different about your family see he's
[1:44:25] with all those denominations amen he's
[1:44:27] with all those wonderful over there
[1:44:28] millionaire denomination guys but he
[1:44:29] comes down to our family he says there's
[1:44:31] something different about you it's the
[1:44:32] word it's the holy spirit it's Jesus
[1:44:35] Christ praise God how did this real
[1:44:37] Holiness amen it's the baptism of the
[1:44:39] Holy Ghost it's Christ in us working
[1:44:40] mightily praise God
[1:44:43] we get those all the time it's not just
[1:44:44] once in a while we get those often
[1:44:47] there's something different about this
[1:44:48] message this message is the message of
[1:44:50] Jesus Christ amen
[1:44:53] amen hallelujah
[1:44:55] and then I gave reassurance for
[1:44:57] Christians brother Randolph said if
[1:44:58] there ever would be an invasion he said
[1:45:00] the bride will be gone before that thus
[1:45:01] saith the Lord because the bride doesn't
[1:45:03] suffer through the tribulation period
[1:45:07] but again there's Christians dying
[1:45:08] around the world Nigeria Kenya there's
[1:45:10] all kinds of Iran China there's all
[1:45:13] kinds of examples Christians are still
[1:45:14] dying they're still Martyrs so we can't
[1:45:16] say we'll never have trials
[1:45:18] we can't say we'll never have
[1:45:20] tribulations
[1:45:21] but the bride as a whole will not go
[1:45:23] through the trumpets and the vows and
[1:45:25] the woes thank God for his Mercy praise
[1:45:27] God
[1:45:30] now I made another video about this one
[1:45:32] 14 Signs Now this there's a lot of
[1:45:33] overlap on here uh put it out eight
[1:45:36] months ago
[1:45:37] another church we all we almost have 14
[1:45:40] 000 subscribers and most of our videos
[1:45:42] don't even get a thousand views you know
[1:45:44] so
[1:45:45] who cares that's why that's why I've
[1:45:46] never asked for one subscriber I'm like
[1:45:48] I just want God to take his word and
[1:45:49] just give it to the person who needs it
[1:45:51] I've never asked for one penny one
[1:45:53] subscriber I've never said well you like
[1:45:55] And subscribe and all those things I
[1:45:57] will you will you support me on my my
[1:45:59] campaign I only got one campaign that's
[1:46:01] to finish the Great Commission praise
[1:46:03] God
[1:46:03] to preach this words and to preach this
[1:46:06] word until the last soul is saved
[1:46:08] Hallelujah
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:11] anyways oh I got these out of order
[1:46:13] sorry I got them out of order so the
[1:46:16] Sinners will be unaware of the Rapture
[1:46:17] the Mantra will be peace and safety
[1:46:19] scoffers mocking Jesus coming Noah's
[1:46:21] conditions right
[1:46:23] silence conditions homosexuality that's
[1:46:25] obvious deceivers will grow worse and
[1:46:27] worse like Joseph Branham Falling Away
[1:46:29] few will have genuine Faith birth pains
[1:46:32] men will love themselves more than God
[1:46:34] gospel preached to Every Nation new laws
[1:46:37] and the squeeze but later rainfalls is
[1:46:39] returning to Homeland and nominal
[1:46:40] churches in laodicean condition
[1:46:44] now I'm about ready to close here so
[1:46:45] just bear with me everybody take a deep
[1:46:46] breath can you
[1:46:47] I'll try to put a lot in here today by
[1:46:49] God's grace
[1:46:50] I want to just show a few more visuals
[1:46:52] here now these are the ones we could be
[1:46:54] wrong on I could be wrong about the ones
[1:46:55] before the Rapture I just tried to show
[1:46:57] you what Jesus Christ said in Matthew
[1:46:59] 24. everybody understand that by God's
[1:47:00] grace
[1:47:01] okay
[1:47:02] now in two look I put this out in 2007.
[1:47:06] I printed this on 2 April 21st 2007. I
[1:47:09] just started I just been a pastor for
[1:47:11] one year right
[1:47:12] and I said this is subject to change by
[1:47:14] further Revelation from the Lord Jesus
[1:47:16] Christ I said that in August 3rd 2008.
[1:47:18] so this is my order of events the
[1:47:20] maturation of the wheat and tears or the
[1:47:22] squeeze next was the catching away the
[1:47:25] church the Rapture uh the Great
[1:47:27] Tribulation and then the battle of
[1:47:28] Armageddon the millennial Reign I forgot
[1:47:31] the marriage supper lamb happens at the
[1:47:32] same time as a tribulation uh St Louis
[1:47:35] at the end of the Thousand Years Gog and
[1:47:37] Magog white Throne judgment second death
[1:47:39] new Heavens new Earth
[1:47:40] now the reason I want to show that is
[1:47:42] because brother Brown puts it up here
[1:47:45] he said when you start talking when you
[1:47:47] start getting mad about when things
[1:47:48] happen you don't even get the message of
[1:47:50] your day he says don't get caught up
[1:47:52] arguing about the order of events he
[1:47:53] said because you'll miss what God is
[1:47:54] doing
[1:47:55] so I'm not arguing about anything but
[1:47:57] I've had all these I've had 16 years to
[1:47:59] preach I mean at some point I might as
[1:48:00] well preach I need to preach on the
[1:48:02] order of events because we have how many
[1:48:03] have questions about the end times
[1:48:05] I do everybody does
[1:48:07] we got to address it at some point I
[1:48:09] love this quote brother man says
[1:48:13] he says now it might come the same way
[1:48:15] today wouldn't it be too bad if it would
[1:48:17] and we've we've got to all draw it out
[1:48:19] and we've had so much schooling until we
[1:48:21] make a chart and tell you almost the
[1:48:23] hour he's coming
[1:48:24] now that's what message preachers are
[1:48:26] doing today I could show you the video
[1:48:27] again I've showed you the video they say
[1:48:29] he's coming any hour he's coming in any
[1:48:30] day now that's what they're saying
[1:48:34] he's coming in and well we tell you
[1:48:37] whether he's going to be riding on a
[1:48:39] white horse or in a cloud we just know
[1:48:40] how it's going to be and it might be all
[1:48:42] together different when he comes
[1:48:45] he says I tell you it pays us to be
[1:48:48] ready say see just be ready for that
[1:48:50] hour
[1:48:52] so the point I'm making here
[1:48:54] hope everybody's okay out there
[1:48:57] uh the point we're making here is that
[1:48:59] we don't spend our two a lot of too much
[1:49:01] time on debating when things are going
[1:49:03] to happen but every now and then I like
[1:49:04] to revisit some of these events because
[1:49:06] like I said we get a clear picture about
[1:49:07] the order of events
[1:49:09] especially I hope you can see that with
[1:49:11] 1977 my if there ever was a time where
[1:49:13] you guys where we can see you we got to
[1:49:15] give the people the meat and due season
[1:49:16] that's a clear example
[1:49:18] clear example
[1:49:21] we've got to feed the meet and do season
[1:49:23] and remember Church remember brother
[1:49:24] brother Loris and sister care remember
[1:49:26] what they were saying there was Couples
[1:49:28] they had so many weddings in 1976 and
[1:49:30] there were so many people maxing out
[1:49:32] their credit cards and not wanting to
[1:49:34] pay it back
[1:49:35] that's stealing
[1:49:37] and the preachers allowed it
[1:49:39] was that giving them their meet and due
[1:49:40] season no
[1:49:43] see buy their fruits you're known
[1:49:45] and the church said
[1:49:47] let me just give you some examples there
[1:49:49] by God's grace
[1:49:50] now I try to list all these events
[1:49:52] before the Rapture so I tried to
[1:49:53] organize them now what's happening now
[1:49:55] now these are all the same these are all
[1:49:57] things brother Adam says the wheat is
[1:49:59] maturing we're laying in the presence of
[1:50:00] the sun it's uniting time we're uniting
[1:50:02] with Christ one another it's laughter me
[1:50:03] time it's Malachi 4 time and the church
[1:50:05] said
[1:50:06] that's what's going on now
[1:50:08] also we're eating and prophesying again
[1:50:10] which is the same thing we are finishing
[1:50:12] the Great Commission here in Akron
[1:50:14] we just got Austin Lena two Marcels in
[1:50:16] by God's grace see God knew there were
[1:50:18] some souls in Akron that wouldn't be
[1:50:19] saved and Arizona
[1:50:21] Hallelujah I believe there's some more
[1:50:23] out there in Arizona too that are going
[1:50:24] to get saved by God's grace
[1:50:26] we're believing
[1:50:28] hallelujah it's happened praise God
[1:50:30] we've seen it happen
[1:50:31] Hallelujah
[1:50:32] so we just gotta do our part and if God
[1:50:35] ever anoints me maybe one of these young
[1:50:36] men right here maybe be a missionary
[1:50:38] someday we'll see where's that little
[1:50:39] Zion where's he at here he's got the
[1:50:41] energy for a missionary we might God
[1:50:43] might send him out there and he's got
[1:50:44] the language too he's quite a talker
[1:50:46] right I'm no pressure Malachi I'm just
[1:50:48] saying like at some point I like to do
[1:50:49] missionary work after I retire Lord
[1:50:51] willing
[1:50:52] like to put another Pastor in here be
[1:50:54] faithful and I'm gonna go out and be a
[1:50:55] missionary by God's grace I like to
[1:50:57] spend if the Lord Terrors I like to
[1:50:58] spend my final years you know turning
[1:51:01] people to Christ I want to feed you
[1:51:03] while while we're all young feed you get
[1:51:05] you all strong and spiritually fed and
[1:51:07] mature filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:51:09] everything I like to go be a missionary
[1:51:10] at some point
[1:51:12] now what's happening in the world right
[1:51:13] now
[1:51:14] the tares are maturing and being bound
[1:51:17] together
[1:51:18] right also here's what we're seeing
[1:51:21] mostly the wars pestilences earthquakes
[1:51:23] family that's what's happening in the
[1:51:24] world what's happening with Israel
[1:51:25] they're returning their Homeland
[1:51:26] according to all those verses and I told
[1:51:29] you last week I don't know if you saw
[1:51:30] the video but they're preparing for a
[1:51:32] temple
[1:51:33] they are soaking the wool in the insect
[1:51:36] uh body parts and turning them red they
[1:51:38] show you right there on the video we are
[1:51:40] doing exactly what Aaron said they're
[1:51:42] getting ready to worship praise God
[1:51:44] they're getting ready for animal
[1:51:45] sacrifices
[1:51:47] all you gotta do is bust down that uh
[1:51:50] that that uh that Shrine there what's
[1:51:52] that Muslim Shrine called
[1:51:54] Temple Mount yeah what's this is Islamic
[1:51:56] Shrine Shrine on the Temple Mount he's
[1:51:59] got to break that down somehow and build
[1:52:00] up a Jewish temple
[1:52:02] yeah Dome of the Rock thanks buddy all
[1:52:04] right I got two I got two extra mines
[1:52:06] two SEC two I got a second and third
[1:52:07] brain that's what I'm trying to say now
[1:52:10] here's here's what
[1:52:13] is rupture there's got to be a squeeze
[1:52:15] and a lot of rain for us
[1:52:16] there must be a squeeze of the One World
[1:52:18] roman-led Government now I don't know
[1:52:20] when these are going to take place I
[1:52:21] don't know if is Israel's gonna are they
[1:52:23] gonna start the temple before or not the
[1:52:24] Rapture I don't know
[1:52:25] I think we'll see that beforehand
[1:52:28] uh the driverless cars undress I mean
[1:52:30] that could be argued could be no I don't
[1:52:31] know they could go out of order I don't
[1:52:33] know
[1:52:34] um woman leader I believe that's Rome I
[1:52:36] believe that's I believe that is that I
[1:52:37] believe the sixth vision is Rome putting
[1:52:39] down the mark of the beast and the
[1:52:41] explosion we don't know the explosion
[1:52:43] okay
[1:52:45] now during the first three and a half
[1:52:47] years of the tribulation you have a
[1:52:48] three and a half of your ministry of
[1:52:49] Mosin Elijah and they begin tormenting
[1:52:51] with plagues now we don't know how many
[1:52:53] people they torment the Bible just says
[1:52:54] they torment
[1:52:56] uh then the Antichrist is revealed he
[1:52:58] makes a seven year Covenant with Israel
[1:53:00] and I didn't have time to put all the
[1:53:01] verses on here but I got them in my book
[1:53:03] the Jewish temples rebuild or finish in
[1:53:05] animal sacrifices are resumed remember
[1:53:07] Church the tribulation is also called
[1:53:09] Jacob's trouble because all the armies
[1:53:11] come against Israel and contains the
[1:53:14] Sixth Seal like Jesus said then the
[1:53:16] second half you have the end of the
[1:53:18] first half of the Covenant Rome breaks
[1:53:20] the Covenant Israel no longer allowed to
[1:53:22] have animal sacrifices the two prophets
[1:53:24] are killed raised from the dead are
[1:53:26] Rapture in the sight of the whole earth
[1:53:27] my and then a tenth part of Jerusalem
[1:53:30] falls in an earthquake
[1:53:32] 30 days after the broken Covenant
[1:53:34] according to Daniel 12 11 Rome sets up
[1:53:37] the abomination of desolation I believe
[1:53:39] that's the Pope in the Jewish temple
[1:53:42] 45 days after that the Jews will be
[1:53:45] blessed now I believe that's when uh
[1:53:47] though 144 000 will receive Christ and a
[1:53:50] nation will be born in one day that's
[1:53:51] what I believe
[1:53:54] then sometimes Roman or Allies like
[1:53:56] Russia the kings of the north Russia
[1:53:58] King of the South Egypt and kings of the
[1:54:00] East China they send all their armies
[1:54:02] against Israel
[1:54:05] and then sometimes Jesus reveals himself
[1:54:06] 144 000 uh you have the seven trumpet
[1:54:09] sound I don't know when the Vatican is
[1:54:10] going to be destroyed in there or the
[1:54:12] seven vows poured out I don't know if
[1:54:13] that's the fervent heat before the
[1:54:14] millennium
[1:54:15] and then of course after that you have
[1:54:17] Armageddon Antichrist Castle Lake of
[1:54:19] Fire now here's some things I didn't put
[1:54:21] on here remember it takes seven years to
[1:54:23] burn the weapons of the King of the
[1:54:24] North King of the South and kings of the
[1:54:26] east east seven years Israel burned
[1:54:28] their weapons
[1:54:29] so that goes into seems like the
[1:54:32] millennium
[1:54:34] and then for seven months they're going
[1:54:35] to be bearing dead Russians Egyptians
[1:54:37] Chinese anyone and all the nations that
[1:54:40] come against Israel for seven months
[1:54:42] they're going to be bearing them that's
[1:54:43] what Ezekiel 38 and 39 say then you have
[1:54:46] the millennial reign of Christ
[1:54:48] okay so again Daniel 70 weeks I'm almost
[1:54:50] done I keep saying that but I am almost
[1:54:52] Daniel 70 weeks have broken up into
[1:54:54] three parts seven weeks 62 weeks one
[1:54:56] week
[1:54:57] the church ages are right in here
[1:55:00] I already showed it
[1:55:01] yeah so you have the seven weeks the 62
[1:55:03] weeks
[1:55:05] until the time a size cut off
[1:55:09] 69 of the 70 weeks have been fulfilled
[1:55:11] then you have Jesus okay then we got
[1:55:14] this one I'm gonna skip this one because
[1:55:15] I already did that one
[1:55:16] uh I'll just do the new one here it's my
[1:55:18] last one let's stand to our feet a
[1:55:19] musician's gonna come I'll just do the
[1:55:20] last one now here's the best I can do so
[1:55:22] far I got a couple more dates to get on
[1:55:23] there but the best I could do so far the
[1:55:26] first thing
[1:55:28] is the rapture of the Bride of Jesus
[1:55:30] Christ that ends the time of the
[1:55:31] Gentiles God goes back to the Jews
[1:55:34] now here's a good question I thought
[1:55:35] about this on the way to church
[1:55:37] when is the mark of the beast laid down
[1:55:39] actually I think it might be during the
[1:55:41] second half
[1:55:43] and the reason I believe that did I have
[1:55:45] my notes up here yeah the reason I
[1:55:46] believe that I just thought about while
[1:55:47] I was praying I didn't plan to do that
[1:55:54] the reason I believe the mark might be
[1:55:56] in the second half because if they laid
[1:55:58] down the Mark at the beginning the 144
[1:56:00] 000 Jews would be killed because they're
[1:56:02] not going to worship Rome
[1:56:04] if they take the mark they're eternally
[1:56:06] lost then they can't get the Holy Ghost
[1:56:08] did you ever think about that I never
[1:56:10] thought about that all these years till
[1:56:11] this morning
[1:56:13] so there might be pressure leading up to
[1:56:15] the mark before the rapture
[1:56:17] but the mark probably won't be laid down
[1:56:18] until the Beast makes himself like he's
[1:56:20] God in the temple of God claiming that
[1:56:22] he is God
[1:56:24] so I don't know something to consider
[1:56:28] of course that would mean the foolish
[1:56:29] version then wouldn't be killed until
[1:56:31] the second half of the Great Tribulation
[1:56:34] so for the first half you have the
[1:56:36] torment Ministry of Moses and Elijah
[1:56:38] then you of course that's the temple
[1:56:40] being rebuilt
[1:56:42] then you have the Sixth Seal which is
[1:56:44] the second half that's also Jacob's
[1:56:46] trouble The Sixth Seal
[1:56:49] of course the pope breaks a covenant you
[1:56:51] have the death Rapture of Moses and
[1:56:53] Elijah or two men with their Spirit then
[1:56:55] you have the abomination of desolation
[1:56:56] 30 days after that
[1:56:59] and then you have Jesus reveals himself
[1:57:01] and seals the 144 000 Jews 45 days after
[1:57:04] that I believe
[1:57:05] then you have the seven trumpets seven
[1:57:07] vows Vatican the kings of the north
[1:57:08] south east all battle against Israel
[1:57:11] Armageddon fire I don't know how much
[1:57:14] time's in there then you got the
[1:57:15] millennium and the church said
[1:57:18] amen God bless you praise God let's bow
[1:57:20] our heads for a word of Prayer
[1:57:22] When shall these things be Church it is
[1:57:24] a normal thing for a holy ghost-filled
[1:57:26] Christian to ask those questions
[1:57:28] when are these things going to be when
[1:57:29] is the sign of your coming Lord God
[1:57:32] these are normal things to ask
[1:57:34] and church if we're Faithful Servants
