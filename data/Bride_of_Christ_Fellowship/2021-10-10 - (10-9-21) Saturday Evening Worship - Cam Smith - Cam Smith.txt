amen amen well you know something about the holy ghost you know uh even in the scripture he was when he get on those prophets he was a fire shut up in their bones amen and uh this is really what we want we want the lord to burn burn within us amen amen you see the prophet he couldn't sit still because it was burning so much in him he couldn't help but just release the word that god had placed in him amen and that's the type of word we want we want a living word amen because this bible is what the letter killeth but the spirit bringeth life amen amen so let's try to sing this real quick and then we'll get right to the word amen i guess i'll just start singing it's all right i got anything ooh maracas i got a big one and a little one so we're rejoicing hallelujah amen oh burn [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen make me just like they were in the first ephesians amen nothing separate nothing different she represents the bride of this hour she looks like just like in the preview of the bride she looks just like the bride that came before hallelujah when when the prophet was like oh could the ministry have produced this and then he heard that marching to zion and there that second bride came up looking just like the first one amen are you identified there by the word and then we know his coming is nigh amen let's go ahead and get our bibles out if we can uh so glad to be here this is a home which god has called me uh to be actually have a part of the ministry um for those who didn't know uh you know brother jesse that's my brother uh in the flesh and uh lord let his gift just really come around right off the gate this is decay or what 17 15 some some odds some years ago he's been pastoring here but you know just just to bless you if you never heard it but uh anyway um god knows where you know we all kind of come out of lima area there and you know the lord actually used brother jesse to start a ministry here and uh you know by god's grace i stayed in lima you know being from that area and anyway what happened was a new pastor had set in there and and one day one day uh they wanted me to take a use pretty much almost like a youth pastor position in the church there and i was praying and uh something something struck me and it said you're not staying here you're going to brother jesse's church and this is just right off the you know right off the get with the new pastor i'm like okay i got i got this youth thing that you know it's been offered to me and god you want me to go to brother jesse's and brother jesse's church was two and a half hours away it still is [Laughter] and uh anyway um god told me that and so i'm like oh boy i gotta call this this brother and i gotta let them know that that i gotta leave the church i got to leave the church and anyway so what happened was i i called him that morning he said god bless your brother and uh i said uh i said yeah god bless you too and i said i said you know um the reason why i called you this morning he said yeah and uh said maybe about the youth position i said yeah yeah it's kind of about that and i i said uh you know i i was praying about it and the holy spirit come and told me to go to brother jesse's church and not to take your position i'm so you know i'm just really sorry about that and he said brother he said that's so strange and i said why is that he said this morning i woke up and i was i was at the table drinking coffee with my wife and he said brother cam he said it was a nothing preconceived he said i was just drinking my coffee i set my cup cup down and he's like something just rolled through my mouth and said brother cam needs to go to brother jesse's church and he said he said god is my witness he said it rolled right out of my mouth he said so i have no hesitancy about what you're doing he said go ahead and go brother and you know what uh by god's grace i sat under this ministry for two years i grew much i wish i could have grown closer to my brother's abilities and and so forth there he's just a mighty man of god i feel very blessed uh to have him as a natural brother but i tell you that because even part of the ministry i've been pastoring what 12 13 years almost however it is i can't remember that's how long it's been so my memory obviously cuts off right about 10 years somewhere right in there but anyway by god's grace um you know god spent i spent two of the finest years of my of my uh mentoring uh through uh the pastoring of your pastor so um it was phenomenal to me uh it's growth uh that i i can't uh take for granted so i love your your pastor here and my natural and spiritual brother and uh by god's grace i haven't done anything from that point but see a living god and and i don't know if i'll testify at some point in time but i have seen so much i know that this message is right i know that that there is a real devil and there's a real jesus christ and beyond a shadow of a doubt i'm i'm convinced that uh we're called to make this amen so uh by the grace of god if we could let's open up our bibles to joshua 3 10. i'm a little bit different of a preacher um perhaps i i'm kind of a teacher preacher and uh but uh i am i'm yielded to the inspiration of the holy ghost so whatever is on your heart just remember he's in this room amen and what is actually happening right now because of your worship you know the scripture says that that oh god thou that inhabits the praise of israel with the praise that you've brought i felt god when i when i was coming out of this room he is in this room so that means all things are possible tonight amen so whatever is on your heart now it's for you to realize that he is here and you want to make that known from your heart what you need amen so while the word is going forward it should be on your heart god i know you're here oh god meet the needs that i have amen and if you can get into that mindset amen if you can produce that type of an atmosphere then there won't be one person sick walk walking out of this room amen because that's the real message because the message is jesus christ amen amen so how we doing here joshua 3 10 then we're going to hebrews 12 after that there we go joshua 3 10 it says here it says and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and the gurgashites and the amorites and the jebusites all right somehow that word jebusite got emboldened and underlined but we have a reason for that hebrews 12 18 next amen really excited today and lord he just kind of brought me around i uh with so much to preach and uh so little time to do it um we just try to find the mind of god and this is where we ended up and uh i'm so glad that uh you know even amongst our brother's family there that now he has his own little zion amen uh hebrews 12 18 it says but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the chur and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and the spirits of just men made perfect all right now we know that there in that passage i'm just reading it to bring to you mount zion obviously this right here is working with the spiritual tense of a spiritual zion that the church was moving into there he said you've already come unto it uh but yet we're gonna learn a little bit about these things or perhaps be refreshed by some thoughts uh let's bow our heads for a word of prayer and we'll get right to this thought the lord jesus christ oh god you who are in our midst the great god of all creation oh god it was you that by your hand all the heavens and the earth consist o god just one little move out of your hand o god and everything would be completely out of cater lord but lord you hold the moon the stars the earth everything in a perfect order and yet oh god we are yearning oh god for something else to come into order tonight god that is the house of the living god lord where it's so important that if one person were out of cater in that room god it could stop divine healing because stop deliverance it could stop the movement of the holy ghost but yet tonight god we're longing for your spirit which is in this room to put in order oh god put us in a heavenly atmosphere oh god set us in heavenly places and we're asking o god tonight that you just move on every heart in such a way oh god lord thou knowest where i have felt led to bring this o god by your spirit but yet lord your spirit can order it and put it right where it needs to be so i ask oh god i give you a heed o god and and put you at the helm of this service lord i don't want nothing here i don't want my mind i want your i want your mind to speak through o god to a group o god who have moved past their minds o god to allow you to be preeminent in this place god so we're asking o god that lord lord it's a saturday night but lord what better could we do on a saturday night then though god to hear your word to invite you here oh god to worship you what more could we want we just ask now lord that you just come and have your way take a hold o god and bring great blessings to your church here for the glory in jesus christ's name the church says together amen you may be seated a little thought the lord has brought to me uh this evening i i ministered several sermons on this tonight we just feel that to come this direction and uh i pray that you're you're in victory mode amen and uh if not we'll begin to go through some of these thoughts for you uh tonight we want to work with the showdown for stronghold zion all right the the showdown for stronghold zion and uh if we could we want to entitle this i haven't went this direction before uh defeating the last enemy all right uh the showdown for stronghold zion defeating the last enemy all right so we want to work in our bibles here and i'm going to try to go fast because uh uh i don't want to be too long here uh but uh psalms 132 13 and uh just looking now into this zion you know the bible especially extensively in the old testament talks about zion all right and uh maybe while i say zion somebody back there look to me that little sweet face amen but uh we understand that uh god talks all about this zion but why this zion and uh what is the bible trying to tell us about his plan for zion all right now notice here in psalms 132 13 it says for the lord hath chosen zion all right god's choosing is zion now why didn't he say gilgal why didn't he say uh some of the other cities bethlehem or bethel or any of these but he actually says the lord chose zion there must be something very important about zion oh my it says he hath desired it for his habitation all right notice his habitation that means that he has inhabited it right so god wanted zion so that he could live there amen hallelujah oh in a natural sense david is bringing this out but not noticing that it will come forth in a spiritual manner upon a spiritual people oh my but seeing this he says this is my rest forever amen here will i dwell for i have desired it amen so the psalmist david coming under the inspiration of the holy ghost we unders that that were coming upon david as he was moved by the holy ghost writing his music amen i mean god still prophesies through his music amen we know in the bible that was that david he just didn't prophesy here but he could cast off demons off of saul through the worship amen hallelujah it's a way to look at worship brother sister as you are saying i will hasten amen he as you are hastening to him he himself will come he can drive a devil out of your life he can drive it out of your neighbor he can make an atmosphere so precious amen that he will move upon you to deliver you from your adversary amen you know those little devils how they try to sneak up on you they try to get that hold on you and once you got them there remember the revelation is that when the devil brings something your way what are you supposed to do your prophet said he's actually bringing you the devil's bling bringing you a box of rattlesnakes he's delivering you some rattlesnakes he said what do you do he said if somebody showed up at your house with a box of rattlesnakes you actually have the right when they knock on that door to give you the package you have the right to say i'm not wanting this i didn't order this it just come to me i'm going to return this to the sender amen hallelujah anytime the devil tries to put something off on you you rebuke him in the name of jesus christ hallelujah say no i don't have to do this amen i don't have to live with this hallelujah hallelujah last time i was here i just told that story because about five years ago the devil tried to put diabetes on me i fell down on the steps i was all dizzy hallelujah and the voice i heard the devil whisper my ear he said now you've got diabetes just like your family and i said i just kind of caught and said oh my what's going on here because you know your sugar your blood sugar everything gets out of whack and you get you get dizzy you can pass out you can even die in certain aspects right but yeah i just rebuked i said no i'm not gonna receive this in the name of jesus christ hallelujah i stumbled up and i went to my bed i said by god's place i'll be better in the morning i woke up the next morning and it was gone hallelujah well somebody might say well your your blood sugar just you know stabilized well a day or so later it came on me again i said no god has already shown me you couldn't stay you're trying to get back i said no i rebuke you go back to where you come from in the name of jesus christ not in the name of cam smith not in your name not anybody's name not in the name of father son holy ghost in the name of jesus christ amen because jesus christ means jehovah's savior the anointed amen he's there to save you amen any time now brother sister when he gave that attribute do you understand what that is when jesus christ wanted to call himself by an attribute what do you call himself why didn't he call himself jehovah jireh he could have called himself we could have said what whatever you say because you know jesus means to have a savior i don't know what the interpretation in english would have been for jeopardy but what if he would have called to him that would mean that he was trying to express that he would always provide for you when he named himself jesus he is actually identifying that when you call on your name you're calling upon a savior amen [Music] hallelujah el shaddai the breasted god right he was wounded for your transgressions bruised for your iniquities and by his stripes you're healed amen you have the right to pull whatever spiritual need you have or what other physical need you have for him hallelujah that means right now amen you call on the name it's not a joke it's not a gimmick you're releasing jehovah's savior from your mouth oh i've been feeling sick jesus how many times you heard testimonies people they've cried out jesus and all of a sudden if someone's trying to hurt him something happens they're in a car and they're gonna die something happens hallelujah my grandpa 50 years ago he was he he had a lead foot he was driving up this hill or whatever and the semi's there he went to go past semi there was another vehicle coming straight at him and so what he did he said he put his hands up said jesus and i'm i'm here me and brother jess you're here right he said when he did that he said all he remembers is raising his head up he was on the side of the road and the vehicle's past you see all your needs whatever it is if you can cry from a true heart and a true need in true centerity you will obligate god to being a savior for you amen hallelujah no this is not what i'm this is not in my notes somebody needed to hear this amen hallelujah you need a revival here you say jesus jesus amen and when you call on that name he is nigh to them that fear him hallelujah but where we're going you'll find out when you call on the name of jesus you're not just calling on his attribute you're calling on your husband [Laughter] you know if my wife cries out for help i hate to say this but sister who you might not be as quick as her husband hallelujah right right sister lydia my she might be quick she probably ain't a big quiz husband because that's the way that relationship works hallelujah i looked out the door the other day at church or somewhere talking to my wife and i just seen her out there i didn't know who it was and i just ran to it i said what's going on i need to go that's my wife hallelujah before she called i was already on my way to help her amen sometimes god is on his way already he's waiting on you to call him on the scene amen hallelujah hallelujah this ain't built on big crowds this gospel ain't built on big giant strobe lights and smoke this gospel is the good news of jesus christ for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life now notice this so he's talking about this zion and he says i will abundantly bless her provision he's going to live with he's going to live there that's going to be his place of habitation and rest it was zion that he desired and he's always going to bless your provision it don't matter it doesn't matter if our government's coming cutting supplies off it doesn't matter who tries to cut it off they might cut it off from man but it can't cut it off from the bride amen because what your husband he want he owns the cattle of a thousand hill amen the bible said that what he never seen his seed forsaken nor his seed begging bread amen hallelujah that's a promise brother sister it don't matter how what the cupboards might get bear just cry out like that widow as hell fast amen hallelujah because the meal and the oil will not go dry notice even with the widow of zach what was it elijah was going to sustain her until the rain hallelujah god is going to pour the rain out amen it is thus saith the lord by the word of god it's a harvest ring but that widow needed what she needed provision before the rain don't you see what's going to happen as these things are getting worse and worse in this country around the world god is going to identify and vindicate a gentile widow of zarephath who is dead to her first husband the denomination amen the denominational spirit amen she was dead to the nicolaitan spirit she was so dead to the nicolaitan spirit that god could send a vindicated prophet's message to her and it would provide not the pr affair it's god himself amen hallelujah hallelujah back to my nephew hallelujah no i'm not gonna play the piano but i want to i feel like i could amen i feel like i can worship god in every language he's ever allowed to come forth and then god give me a heavenly language because that's not enough amen god wants this zion for his habitation zion is a in definition there's a few different ones because zion is a very mysterious word zion is a defense a fortress it literally means the fortified fortified place or stronghold so god was actually looking to a place that would be a stronghold it would be a place that what he would be able to be fortified there hallelujah takes you right back to revelations 5 where that lamb come and took the book and he was ordained with seven horns on his head those seven horns were watched seven church ages amen they were called horns because they were a defense to the animal amen that is the bride of jesus christ she amen the stronghold of god right now it's not based on how big your church is it's not based on how anointed your preacher is everybody in the church is anointed by this holy ghost hallelujah he wants you amen he's not interested in some sort of a nicolaitan move where it's just one anointed man the whole church needs to get yielded to the holy ghost get in position because that's what's slowing it down god wants you he wants you to get busy praying he wants you to get consecrated just reading quote where brother branstad he said why are these meetings happening like this i can't remember one brother's name he said he said that brother and gene goat he said they're praying and fasting days and days on end he said that's where it's coming they were actually doing the unmerited thing nobody knew about it but there they were staying consecrated before god god come out of bride of christ fellowship and acronym they were crying out that god would live in this place if a soul comes in let the holy ghost move like that amen hallelujah all right let's go for another one psalms 48. you know i'm gonna get moving a second here it says a psalm a song it in psalm for the sons of korah great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his hallelujah it's a mountain of holiness so it's going to be a church that's on the highway of it's holiness to be our church that's living by the word now hallelujah that's why we've got to get in the book brother sister we've got to see what the bible says there's too many people that have cut too much out amen the bible is full and it what the truth will set you free when you give yourself to it amen so he says beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth the joy of the whole earth i thought that was new york city nope some sweet people there is mount zion on the sides of the north remember that what does that stand for intimacy the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge amen so now another characteristic is coming forth that design is actually what god has known in her palaces i'm going somewhere with this yes because something something in our mind it would like to say that you know zion this dying that but i want to just set it forth in your mind what god's original idea was about this hallelujah now notice so it's palaces wait did it say temple it's analysis what's the difference between a temple and a palace and notice it's a palaces there's palaces for refuge ah just like in the old testament where there's what seven cities of refuge the sixth city in the last was christ right that's where the levites were that's where the word was amen and it didn't matter what come your way you could have accidentally murdered something wicked you could go to that city of refuge and find safety there now god is calling this zion a place of refuge but he identifies it as palaces all right all right now we know this i'm going to read this real quick because isaiah 4. i put that in parentheses not trying to ruin a quote it says in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious the fruit of the earth shall be excellent calmly them that escaped of israel how that you escaped all that damnation we're in a rapture our we're getting ready to leave damnation behind because the tribulation is when judgment is pouring out god is giving everyone a chance to wake up right now your fortification is not in a being a member of a church it's not in paying your tithes your refuge is in christ this message delivers you to the holy ghost hallelujah that's why it's three works of grace just forgive your sacrificial holy ghost hallelujah i was working with on on wednesday last wednesday at the home church there and i was showing them that there there are so many promises that are available to the holy ghost believer i was looking online and and they said there's 3 000 biblical promises in there see the devil wants you to have the entertainment and joys of of youtube or our television or a movie or something like that but to truly walk into christ you actually have so much of god available for you hallelujah 3 000 i was thinking 300 when i looked it up 3 thousand that's why i was just writing i just told you a scripture where he inhabited his praise he promised he inhabits praise that's what he does that's his promise hallelujah now that he doesn't inhabit noise he doesn't inhabit uh something that sounds nice he inhabits praise amen he wants you to come to the house of god with a spirit of worship amen and he wants you to love on him amen he wants you to invite him come lord your bride is here and worship amen hallelujah so he says it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion he that it's a remnant in jerusalem shall let's see in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem see wherein the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of zion notice what he says remember that's always the bride hallelujah so when we say zion spiritually in the old testament it's talking about the bride all right now we're going somewhere at this now hold on i know everybody's like i know that glory to god we're coming he said remember that's always the bride and shall have purified the blood of jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews plus bride in the midst thereof with the spirit of judgment and fire all right now let's go this little path now okay i want to show you something now all right we're going to remove these scriptures very quickly here so i want you to see this so we know according to scripture when the bible talks about zion and mount zion in the old testament he's talking about the bride all right that's factual but what is mount zion mount zion is actually a location within israel also synonymously called at times jerusalem there's a new heavens and a new earth coming forth amen there's also what a new city new jerusalem that will come down 1500 by 1500 miles by 1500 miles it will come down and set right at the spot of jerusalem hallelujah now watch this because in the old testament this all ties in really good and i'm going to take you somewhere i just trust you'll be blessed joshua 24 11 so remember god what he raises moses up and he says go take that land flowing with milk and honey moses takes them in the wilderness they spy out the land they have a bad rapport and what they can't go in so god has to raise up joshua joshua parallels ephesians of the new testament it is what ephesians is a grace move in the new testament it's not based on your law it's based on who you are amen god reveals to your predestination he reveals to you that watch that you're saved by grace not by message works you're saved by faith through grace in jesus christ amen hallelujah when you look what the prophet said he said and he talks about the people that missed the rapture he says they thought they were under the blood the foolish virgin thought they were under the blood of matthew 25. they thought they were there but they weren't hallelujah let's move into this now so someone could think that they're under the blood because they go to a message church because they heard the midnight cry but there's only one that can baptize you with the spirit it's not a church it's not a pastor it's not a messenger it is jesus christ himself coming on an individual level to you blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear god is trying to call you to a place that you can be so in tune with him that you will be the saith the lord or sit still got quiet on that one glory as long as you can say amen hallelujah because that's what you're called for all right let's go so what so now joshua goes into the land god says as i was with moses so i'll be thee you're praying i know your pastor's been preaching on this they were invincibly conquering that land hallelujah joshua 24 11. and you went over jordan and came into jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites parasites and canaanites and the hittites girgishites hivites and jebusites and i delivered them into your hand so god fought them for for them god fought him joshua 23 3 and you have seen remember there's seven in uh enemies i got oh i got ah yeah seven enemies in that land and god said i fought him for you i delivered you for you amen joshua 23 3 and you have seen all that the lord your god have done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that fought for you do you see the difference between law and grace you see the law is dead right as far as advice it can't save you the bible says that if you've offended in one point you're guilty of the whole the only way to move in grace is to receive christ and have him move upon you now remember everything that you're going to be uh receiving as a christian you receive it by how about how pretty you look by how great you're going to live out holiness everything you receive is actually done because of your faith because you are abraham's face seat hallelujah when your prophet talked about it he said that what he says by your faith you accept that so we can say i have faith but faith accepts it how do you get the holy ghost oh i got to live cleaner no you're missing it you've got to die to self and stand there and say god you promised if i repented and got baptized in the name of jesus christ you'd give me the promise of the holy ghost notice the holy ghost is a promise it is not a marriage god unconditionally gave abraham the land and by faith he took it amen hallelujah i was working with on wednesday when when we talk about abraham in genesis 13 the scripture says that god told him to look north south east and west he said everything you see it's yours and then when he got done saying that he said arise and walk through that land so it wasn't just good enough that he'd seen it oh i see the promises of god oh i see the holy ghost oh i see somebody else the holy ghost in there all right brother by faith they had to see that god gave them all that amen he gave them all that land and then what you arise he said and go through that land and what take the length and the breath and look through the entire land this holy ghost got gifts for you he's got fruits for you hallelujah he's got power upon power for you and when god comes to you faith is the substance of things hoped for amen when god raises up something in you i need this i need that he will give it to you he didn't say whatsoever things you need if you can believe it i'll give it to you he said whatever things you desire you can have it but what your desire has to line up with the word you can't go in there carnally god has so much you see what i'm saying if you ain't got no joy you know what the issue is you ain't pulling you ain't you ain't walking through the land to see your joy your joy's walking through the land if you ain't walked into joy yet you gotta walk through it peace you gotta walk through it brother sister the seven compound redemptive nature you walk through it jehovah jehovah shalom walk through it he's your peace jehovah general walk through it these are things that god says are yours brother bram said he said i never understood christians he said he said he said they can't accept it he said god he's talking about abraham he said god gave him all that land he said he said what can't they do they can't accept it he said when i seen the bible he said i wanted to see everything in it he said he and then this is this this is the 60s he says he says it's just like an arcade he said if there's things on the shelf that i can't i can't see that's still mine he said so what i do i go get a ladder he said jacob's ladder and i fall on my knees and i start praying until i can climb up and see it hallelujah your faith grows with communion your faith grows as you commune so much with him his mind becomes your mind and what you can accept his faith through you hallelujah amen now so what'd he say it's god that fights for you he's the one that fought through you he said behold i've divided on you by a lot these nations reign to be inheritance for your tribes for jordan from jordan with all the nations cut off even unto the great sea westward and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you god promised they were going to take that land right but joshua rebukes him and said you've been slack yes you've been slack you're not going to your inheritance now watch us watch us joshua 13 josh is old and stricken in years lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years and they remaineth yet very much land to be possessed all right they were done fighting with joshua all these victories not anyone dying at all it was promised of god that they had inhabited the entire land of israel sir brother sister i believe that when abraham god told him to arise and walk through that land i believe the same land that israel ended up with is what abraham went and seen i don't believe that abraham took a one-day journey on a horse or a camel or whatever and he said yep looks like it's good and it's fine because god told him to go go look through all of it see the same god that gave him the revelation that he'd have a son gave him the revelation that wherever you go it's yours he's seen it and then israel possessed it amen why are you saying that no no i didn't say this because i might think everybody knows it but but the scripture says that why we know that the land was a type of the holy ghost so all that you can go out god promised you you can you have utmost limitless bounds of the baptism of the holy ghost you can see every single all three thousands are your sister naomi it's yours you don't need brother jesse's permission you know your parents it's not based on what someone can give you or what you can do it's based on how much you can die out to your husband christ i understand i'm staying all you're wanting him to do is be your husband because your husband is the owner of all of it he wants to give it to you that's why your prophet said the gifts have to be in the church the type is rebecca eliezer brought gifts to rebecca yes sir she took those gifts those gifts and put them on and wore them all the way back because they weren't eliezers gifts they were god sent from isaac to rebecca hallelujah they're your gifts before the bride of jesus christ amen you say brother cam you're excited yes i'm excited the anointing is here how can i not rejoice you see you're experiencing heaven right now ephesians is heavenly places we should be what that's your promise i don't believe brother sister that heavenly places is well we come to church are we coming we listen to the word we're all passing out it's your promise you know the brother brother branham said he said that when you fall asleep in church he says the devil it's making you do that so what do mature christians do hallelujah i wasn't preaching the day at home church i did what brother jesse i stood right up because because i felt i literally felt the atmosphere dive twice and after that first time i jumped up i go hallelujah because i felt the atmosphere and i felt it trying to cling on to me it wasn't my you know what after i got up i wasn't tired you don't have to get up either that's just what i did if god tells you and you're in your sin you're getting tired you say no devil i'm in heaven right now i'm where the word is coming forth my god is in this room amen i'm not making something up the bible says where two or more gathered in his name there am i in the midst another promise is yours hallelujah all it is is revelation laodicea tries to make us so flesh-bound you are zion hallelujah we got a reason to be excited we gotta reach in the shout amen because god is promised he is with us amen you know your promise in acts 10 said well peter yet speak these words the holy ghost fell on him you know what that means brother cam you know peter's sermon was only 15 minutes longer graham said you want to refilling you know it takes 15 minutes of preaching you want a healing you know it takes 15 minutes but you see you're moving into an atmosphere you realize why you're there your promise that you should go from birth to birth to birth to birth he said every day of earth that's not fiction brother sister that's your promise acts 4 your prophet said was three days after the upper room oh and then he said he said there's too many people trying to trust an experience from 10 years ago oh hallelujah well i gave my heart to god way back here and there ain't nothing shown from it the problem is somebody didn't teach you someone didn't teach me we have to get in the word and see what our promises are i'm going somewhere this birth sister but i want you to see this they did not possess the land they didn't possess the holy ghost with joshua it just let's let's prove it i want you to see this joshua 15 63 as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem watch this the children of judah could not drive them out judah you know the lion of the tribe of judah god always sent them up first to battle yes they could not drive out the inhabitants of jerusalem but the gemsites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem until this day they couldn't dry them out at the end of joshua they still couldn't drive them out all right judges 121 and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem judah couldn't do it benchmarks couldn't either who are these tributes dwell and what but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin and jerusalem until this day yes sir all through time we find out that there's this group that is stuck in jerusalem called the jebusites now i'm not going to read it for time's sake they did drive out some of the jebusites but they could not take jerusalem wait a minute why not now watch so it comes all the way to this right here in 2nd samuel 5 3. you mean it lasted all the way until 2nd samuel 5'3 now watch this david david it's going to come down to david yes who's david david was a type of jesus christ [Music] notice with joshua there was no possession of jerusalem see types only run so far but when we look at the biblical story it comes saul didn't do it saul didn't even get the ark back in its spot but neither did david actually he brought it in but he didn't build the temple all right so notice watch us this is where you come in so all the elders of israel came to the king in hebron right so saul's dead now i want you to see what happens saul dies david was already ruling for seven years but now everybody now saul's dead his son's dead yes and now everybody comes to the king in hebrew and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord so now notice what does he do he makes a league with them he brings a fresh uniting with david yeah that's rush and they anointed david king over israel david was 30 years old when he began to reign he reigned 40 years and in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah that's something 33 years just like christ hallelujah now watch so david now he unites all of his people of israel together remember now notice this your prophet said that it would take a press to get the church together numerous places i don't believe i i don't know i'm just presuming but i don't believe because your prophet said there'll be one in jefferson there'll be some over here be someone here they'll be about you know 20 or however many they'll be over in akron hallelujah i preached like this in my church i said i'm not believing three three three types of beliefs i'm believing an exception right here i believe god's gonna have thirty or forty how are many over and over in the point i believe that i'm not giving up on anybody i'm going to pray with compassion and love i don't care how bastard they look or religious or or or what they're showing i believe that something has drawn them to the word and no matter what devil it is my god is going to cast it out amen hallelujah how's he going to do it it doesn't matter but i'm putting love on it because love will drive the devil away that's why faith worketh by love so as the bride is coming to the capstone the agape love what happens there's a third pole for you brother sister you know within those five identifications there's the ability to speak salvation well if there's salvation that means you can speak a rapture too well that's for brother branham brother cam you can believe whatever you want to believe but when i look at it brother branham types the holy or the holy spirit with the third pole he says he when he talks about their in certain thoughts he says he third pole is another work remember even souls that are in prison now what'd he say he said all ministries have three polls you got a ministry wait a minute i thought brother graham said everybody has a ministry it's just how he lives it through them in position sisters are not called to the pulpit the bible says that right but you've got a ministry hallelujah amen all brothers don't but what whatever their position is we've got to get that positional placement when we get in place then it lives and the king sixth verse and his man went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land come down to david which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come hither i want to stop here so notice the inhabitants of the jebusites they went through hundreds of years where joshua they would go to jericho and walls come coming down they see the 30 had some kings they were killed and destroyed all the people drove out and hallelujah i was watching a video and they said that some of the giants that that joshua drove out actually ended up on some of these isles over by italy and by oral tradition they came from israel when joshua drove them out but look at this they could drive out giants but there was a specific time in a specific king that had to be there in order for them to take jerusalem but notice how haughty they become this is jfb commentary it says it was strongly fortified and deemed so impregnable that the blind and the lame were sent to man the battlements in derisive mockery of the hebrew king's attack and two shout david cannot come in hither to understand the full meaning and force of this insulting taunt it is necessary to bear in mind the depth and steepness of the valley of gehan and the lofty walls of the ancient canaanite fortress wait a minute so god allowed the jebusites to take jerusalem and it was so strongly fortified it was actually according to what you read it was one of the greatest accomplishments that david had and no israelite before could even touch it that's right right hallelujah now watch so what well think about it in a spiritual sense brother sister there's one thing that we're fighting for we're fighting to return to the original and there's one squatter that has been holding this rapture up the whole time but the rapture is not dependent on him the rapture is all dependent on david when it's time for david to take over [Music] and notice it's a unification time that when david remember the lineage had to come through david he was the first rightful king of israel he had the what he didn't have the height he had the heart and what even in david's time the scripture said and watched all the men that were discouraged that were tired of saul the nicolas in spirit they went to david they were tired of denomination they were tired of dead services they were tired of false anointings they wanted the real anointing amen and when they were looking for david they seen he was truly anointed to be the king of kings amen watch this so they what they think david is no different they said we've destroyed everyone else they couldn't take this area you know the devil's been sitting here for all these years right so many people thought it would happen they thought the rapture was going to happen in the 60s they thought it was going to be when brother branham was here it wasn't you know why because god won't share his glory with no one else hallelujah it don't matter what man it is on the scene right now it ain't mine it ain't no no these big churches nothing there's only one that you can glory in and that is the lovely lord jesus christ what's he waiting for he's waiting for his church to unite with him you gotta see he's king you gotta see he's anointed don't you see that when they joined with david they all seemed well they could never get away from it oh hallelujah i won't do it for time's sake but when you when you see this finished god goes on to to mark david and all of his mighty men to show that these people it didn't matter if there's 900 people there it was just one guy he'd go kill them all he didn't need david because he was joined in spirit now i'm typing that [Music] he knew he was with david so he could go and take on anybody because it was god's desire to have david to be king and it was his mission to help get him there right back to those seven horns hallelujah look at the seals watch so notice they didn't say israel can't come have feather they called it david the type of christ jesus they called him the son of david now remember i i won't have time to do this why david what was david's purpose remember david was such a type of jesus christ that it said that he put all enemies under his feet the scripture said that he shed blood abundantly yes yes so he couldn't make the temple remember solomon's temple was a type of of the holy ghost uh outpouring uh uh in the upper room your prophet said that he said psalm is a type old testament type of ephesians church age so he says you know what i'm talking about i preach all about it it's there but what was david's job to shed blood what was jesus christ's job to shed blood what do we read about the new testament what was what was jesus's job to put all enemies under his feet what does scripture say that david put all his enemies under his feet david was a perfect bible type you won't find it in the niv you won't find it in the amplified you will find all these all these other different bibles with different different uh codexes and documents manuscripts you won't find it you'll find it right in the king james because the revelation is to the bride of jesus christ nevertheless seven verse david took the stronghold of zion now watch what he says the same is the city of david and david said on that day whosoever geteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of david's soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house so david dwell in the fort and called the city of david and david built round about from mello and inward and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him yes the last land that david took was zion watch this but notice was it david that went up himself no but what did david have david actually what he had the revelation of how to take the city wait a minute how is he going to take the city whosoever geth up to the gutter remember it's on a mountain whosoever giveth up to the gutter and smite of them they will be chief and captain of that city so wait a minute god is now saying right through david he's going to tell you how to do it but you've got to go do it by how the revelation of david david had the revelation of how to take the city you might not be understand where i'm going you'll get in just a sec now watch watch this according to commentators this word gutter here it's only used in one other spot and it's actually talking about water spouts but the commentators say that that word gutter it's actually talking about a specific subterranean passage that was into mount zion there was a secret way into it and david knew about it and he told them where it was and how to get in wait a minute didn't your prophet say that right at the end time there'd be a short quick message sent to the church and the church would take it and go into the rapture [Laughter] glory the secret is with david oh my i'm still sitting in heavenly places brother sister i don't know about you but i'm sitting right there because i want you to see this jesus christ has your revelation to get this rapture but i want you to say this because the rapture that anointing is already in this room [Music] the ability to make the rapture is what he who abides in you we've got to get closer we've got to get hungry scripture says in luke 16 16 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it how are you going to get into it you got to press into it you've got to take zion how are you going to take zion wait a minute the dynamics is nothing more than a refilling of the holy ghost which god had worked in a small measure while the capstone was coming down so you're actually supposed to learn how to get what refillings of the holy ghost and that will bring you to the dynamics because you're already sealed when he brings it you've got to press into this zion what's zion that's the bride of jesus christ now notice this i want you to see this let me go back it is easier so notice how he ties us in and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than the one tittle of the law to fail why does he join that together what's he doing if you go to luke 17 uh uh four and five and the the disciples go to jesus and they say increase our faith remember that and jesus christ how do you answer them he said if ye say unto the sycamine tree be plucked up and cast in the sea and obey you how does that increase faith how does this increase faith don't you see it all you need is the word remember brother branham said if evil to just use the word she wouldn't have fell that's why when jesus fasted for 40 days all he needed was the word to combat the devil he wanted to show you that all you needed was this baptism of the holy ghost with the word of god amen you would slay every single devil in your way amen hallelujah how am i gonna press it by the word amen because i'm hungry for it i want it amen and jesus is the word my husband amen now watchers i want to show you this real quick i went through this before i just touched it second chronicles 3 2 1 2. so david takes he takes mount zion okay did you know that it was oh samuel 19 when david actually takes mount moriah well what's the difference between mount zion mount moriah now solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem on mount moriah where the lord had appeared to his father david at the place that david had prepared on the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite and he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign look at this picture mount zion is here and mount moriah is here mount moriah is where the temple is built mount zion is what it's the castles wait a minute i'm still not getting it brother god always calls jerusalem mount zion yes why does he put emphasis on zion and not moriah moriah is the temple ministration but it's fulfillment is in mount zion why my moriah is what brings your what it brings your sacrifice it blings your blood but mount zion is actually the dwelling of husband and wife hallelujah so that's why he's always talking about he didn't say i want to inhabit mount moriah but he actually joins all jerusalem or the city of peace in mount zion hallelujah i hope you can see it amen see my mariah is not his portion zion is his portion you are his portion you know why it's a tribulation to come because god is still calling those names on the book there is still an accuser of the brethren that's trying to stop you he's trying to say david you can't have it you can't have zion yes i'm laughing but i'm laughing at the devil amen he thinks he can have you he thinks he can keep you bound in sin and shame but brother sister there is a revelation with this gospel that what god cannot impute sin upon you you can fail 10 times a day god can impuge it amen because you're under that blood amen that's why i think brother sister let all of them say that brother branham was a false prophet let him make all sorts of stuff up let him come up with the facts of how inconsistent he was let him come up with it because they don't understand the purpose i understand the purpose do you understand the purpose yes sir yes when i looked at brother branham and i seen that i said oh god what's going on here and god brought it to him and he said he said that's how far grace goes he could tell a story wrong in a sermon and then the angel of the lord without an apology without saying i think that's how it went well hopefully i tell this right he tell the story he tell it wrong hallelujah don't you get it [Applause] the holy ghost falling tonight is not based on what you're doing right now it's based on what you're believing and what you see yourself as justified means you never did it in the first place hallelujah he could tell a story wrong say something wrong and then the angel lord come right down and vindicate the gift you don't think you got a gift you don't think you need to be vindicated he has already promised it you are stepping into the revelation amen all things are possible see it it's all about you don't you get it that's why the jews they want to stick right at all these laws and so forth they're missing and they're putting on mariah they're putting it on a weeping wall but the proof is in zion watch this i know i'm probably a little bit long but i feel so good right now it's hard to stop if we can see this apply it to your life you know what do you need to say zion's mine i'm the bride of jesus christ i've taken the city amen notice you've got to get back to ephesians what was ephesians brother cam but ye are come now come unto a mount zion and he talks about the city of angels they had such a move of the holy ghost that the literal presence of heaven was down in this dimension now brother branham said he said you think that heaven some far-off place he said but they're going to find out that it's actually right here it's only moving a little faster do you get what that means you could literally touch the throne you could literally touch the seat of the elders what's the holdup we don't know who we are the bible shows us who we are brother came why mount zion pick up your pen and write yes specifically to the bride watch this carefully now to see it in the word john was the forerunner of malachi 3. he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of that day organizations jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown the second forerunner of christ will sow for the latter rain who was the second forerunner brother brown jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds wait a minute why doesn't that say between the bride and her flesh why doesn't it say that it'll be the showdown between the message and the denominations right brother that's exactly what i'm saying brother brown said he said that is one of the secrets that was under the seals he said the secret was god didn't like those organizations be careful because it's right in the message brother sister god's been revealing this thing to me lately and i'm seeing it and it comes down i even found out that i was doing it for the cam how how are you doing it i go off on a whole other sermon right now i can't do it but i'll say this when brother branham tied in the organization his nominational spirits he said it was divine leadership plus human right right anytime you or me any of us take our own will and start making our own decisions we're showing that we're basing it on humanism and not divine leadership let me say it let me say this i'm going to say it's loud and proud and i don't say proud in a prideful way by saying i'm going to say this boldly before you forgive me for that word when we go and we say okay i need youth programs we got people in the message now we got vbs we got vacation bible schools we got we got we got all sorts of little programs i got to be careful because i don't want to throw brothers under the bus but it's very obvious right now well we're having a pizza party for the youth we're having this we're having this it's denominationalism so wait we have to go back to what denominations do in order to get people to be happy in our church we need a football night we need to we need a vibe i'm not saying that you can't do it but i'm saying this if you're not a nicolaitan as far as a pastor you need to go to god and see if god approves it because you know what i'm being honest in my failure i was making too many decisions because i was too busy i said god i don't know here we go and i've come to find out that cam smith was making too many decisions but now i know it was one of the secrets hid under the seals watches jesus is going to come and show who is denominational with creeds it doesn't matter doesn't matter if you're a message believer that don't matter are is the message church led by man or god that's the deciding point amen brother sister you will sit dead in this church if you sit under nickelodeonism because you're expecting a preacher to be anointed you're anointed hallelujah you're expecting his prayer his anointing to go to god it's your prayer your anointing it's not your pastor's gift alone it's your gifts you've got to die to self and live amen brother cam that's rough you sure ain't kidding it is rough that's why i say god forgive me for he will come back to back up his word and take his bride and rapture the first showdown was mount carmel the second was mount transfiguration and the third would be mount zion there it is there it is brother cam why zion because the very showdown notice they couldn't take joab's word for it they couldn't take any of the mighty man's word for how to go it was purely jesus christ now remember jesus is we're going to meet him in the air so who's the showdown really between with david he said whosoever geth up to the gutter and taketh the city that's what pick up your pen and write is all about he said that the bride in christ will be so much alike that she will become in this very image right greater work shall ye do for i go unto the father the very word of christ will be so much in the bride that shall be an invincible army brother cam watch this i'm going to tie this in lord shows me right before service first chronicles 11 4 same same spot watch this real quick cam you've been long gorgon i'm still in heaven just give me a chance to maybe maybe i'll come out maybe i'll stay in i can't promise nothing but i can promise you this that jesus christ is still here amen hallelujah as long as somebody's holding in that atmosphere there is always the ability to stay in it amen i knew even if you felt like you left a little bit ago you can get right in today man you can still while the word is speaking you can get the holy oak street feeling right on you amen here it is you're parallel watch this real quick and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land now we've got the same portion but watch this there's one little difference here watch us nevertheless david took the castle of zion he was interested in what the castle who lives in the castle the king and the queen [Applause] [Music] hallelujah and lot in taking it he sent them in to fight and take it the zion showdown that the bride that you are will live out so then david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city of david he's giving you the revelation of this holy ghost he's giving you how to take what system or whatever you've been brought up under and to come to the place the holy ghost has to be in me i've got to get hungry for this i've got to cry out i need as much holy ghost as my pastor you know when brother brahm said that the church can live no higher than a pastor that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try don't even think about living higher just say god let me live on that level if we all get on the same level it'll happen i told my church i said if i study and pray six to ten hours for most sermons how much should the church do this is what's killing us brother sister if you've come for service you need to prepare for service just like your pastor does just like the minister does the frolic's got to go because how are you going to operate in a gift how are you going to operate bring the holy ghost down if you're not doing anything to bring god here [Music] that's hard that's hard but it's so true i'm telling you i'm seeing this like i've never seen it before but it'll work if you get there you oh it's all over me i can't help this why did brother branham say that when the gifts of the spirit were truly in the church that they would meet one hour before the service and the gifts would would all operate and then they'd go into service see we've come under this thought that it has to be during the preaching of the word it'll have to be in the worship the church the laity is supposed to be so in love and gifted with christ that they can be just like elijah they can say just bring me a minstrel that's all i need you don't need a pastor to show up and he's got a gift he'll be here or if he wants to whatever he wants to do if he wants to be a shepherd that's what he's gonna do but there should be enough people in this room and there are enough people in this room that if you can get set aside to jesus lay down all laodicea got to live this right through him but what's he after this last showdown brother sister is all about you going to your husband his wife have made herself ready now watch us watch us one last thing maybe jebus in hebrew means a trodden place as a threshing floor what was the threshing floor it was where they separated the wheat in the chat hallelujah which is what the feast of pentecost the waving of the loaves and what did jesus all type that the gathering to the garner it's the feast of pentecost that ends with the reaping of the wheat namely the dry rock see it might seem like it's dry to some people but god is still separating real seed wheat hallelujah brother cam notice as we close we can stand we can stand let's stand let's stand amen i still feel the holy ghost amen revelations 10 8 this is after receiving the the final the final voice the full mysteries and the voice which i heard from heaven spake on me and again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth who is that christ he said you go take it yes yes you go take it now how does he ask you to take it you go take the you tell your book is open and jesus says hey watch what he says and i went on the angel and said to him give me a little book and he said take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said to me he'd almost prophesy again before many people's nations multiple thoughts tongues and nations and kings what is it it's coming right back down to what this is david had the revelation that you needed to go and do the final work of the bride it's time to get in that castle so to say it's time to what to catch the revelation and move into this move into what before this rapture you have to be in ephesians you have to be a mature church you have to be in the mature world living it watching him in your life that way if he's not there it's time what do you say he's already told you what to do go and take it go and take it so what do you got to do give it to me give me the word i need the word amen not just that not just the preaching you need the revelation you don't want to be a hearer of the word you want to be a doer of the word hallelujah all right amen i'm gonna sleep really good tonight hallelujah i trust it brother sister we got to get in the place you know how many services that i've been in or i've preached in that you feel the holy ghost all night long and into the next day that's what i'm interested in i want an anointing that i enter into it doesn't leave i can't tell you how many times you preach the word or or you have an experience of the altar and and you're one you're ready to walk out and all of a sudden the holy ghost falls on you again and say hallelujah because he's wanting to what take habitation where in this building in you or the cam that's a long sermon but i'll tell you what if you can get into it you can catch that revelation say god give me the book give me the revelation god i believe i am zion oh god i believe in the bride of jesus christ there is a castle that you have called me to dwell in with you i'm not worried about moriah the law already failed but i know i can receive the holy ghost and he'll he'll let me fulfill the law amen you see you can't take moriah out of jerusalem mariah that word is part
