TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then revealing himself in the same Matthew 11:25 Matthew 11:25 we'll read 25 and 26 I might even read 27 by God's grace and just as you'll probably know you know the communion service is a longer service so if anyone needs to step out and get water or something like that of course you're free to do that uh by the grace of the Lord Matthew 11:25 26 and 2 7 I'll read 25 and 26 then we can look at 27 27 speaks of course the Revelation the father gives to his children praise God how you glad to be a child of God today I'm so glad he's revealed it to me I wasn't worthy to see these things I wasn't I wasn't anything I was a sinner but God in his grace reveals it to us because we're his children praise God that's the sign we are his children I'll read 25 and 26 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight verse 27 on three 1 2 3 all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him may God add his Blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated by God's grace so we're in the series we're on the uh third four five the seventh sermon out of eight sermons in this song We preach on recognizing your day uh serpent seed perfect Faith the breach the message of Grace the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery now we're looking at God and simplicity and then we'll go to the spoken word is Original Seed by God's grace we review here briefly brother randam was astonished as we were preaching in part one last week at the renovations the brandham Tabernacle and then he uh we saw his dedication to his children's education and then uh he recalled the Tabernacle being built on a land previously uh with Pon lies a pond and that reminded him of Jesus Christ as the lily of the valley and then we see all the benefits uh the natural benefits from the lily of the valley we see all the spiritual benefits in our lives today Hallelujah the blessings of the Lord and then brother R thanked all the the men that led the construction efforts uh in the renovation on Brenham Tabernacle then we took a virtual tour of the Brenham Tabernacle and Jose I made that a video Jose posted it on his YouTube channel and I have a link if you want the video I can send you the link on YouTube and he put music on it I his is his is better than mine so if you want some only believe piano instrument on there uh you could get that from Brother Jose and then we ended with how God uh kept brandom Tabernacle for him being burnt down and the beauty of the church is the character of the people hallelujah so I want to just pick up right there I'm just going to add this thought in here just hit a few scriptures uh the beauty of the church is the character of the people what is character character is moral excellence and firmness so you're firm morally so character is your ability to not compromise character is how true you are to obeying God's word hallelujah so often we think of oh he's a funny character or he's a or she's a uh she's a fun character to be with or something like that or she's a serious character that's a little different definition uh that's just the that's just attributes about a personality but the the definition of character that we want to focus on is the moral Excellence so how excellent are you obeying the word of God that's the character we're looking at Hallelujah and of course God doesn't anticipate or expect perfection and that's why Jesus had to die because nobody could achieve it under the law praise God but still you know God With God gives us this gift of forgiveness then he gives us the gift of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he gives us power power to become a witness praise God and so then with that power God uh gives us responsibility Hallelujah and so we know we're not going to be perfect but we want to glorify God we want to glorify Jesus Christ Hallelujah and the way we show that is through our firmness or our character of our moral decisions Hallelujah uh it's found in Hebrews 3:6 but Christ as a son of over his own house was like Moses Moos Moses was the type Christ was the antitype whose house we are so think about that you're the house of Christ If We Hold Fast the confidence how many confident in the gospel and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end so there's the word firm we're we're called to stand firm nobody can shake us nobody can make us compromise that's character right so we have to we are the house of God if we have firm character Until the End okay again that doesn't mean a sinless Perfection we never make a mistake but when we make a mistake we acknowledge our sin like David said I acknowledge my sin before you and then we say Lord create in me a clean heart amen hallelujah and renew a steadfast Spirit Within Me Hallelujah so that that's the question I want to ask each and everyone today How firm are you in your convictions because that's your current state that's your character right now now before you're born again we got the statue of perfect man over there each one of those is anointing to a certain level of character so when when uh when denominational talk about uh you know uh uh they talk about going up a level it it's so General that they don't even know what level they're going to go up or oh in 2025 it's going to be alive you know they make up these Rhymes you know you're going to be alive in 2025 well that means you're dead in 2024 you know so they don't even understand the levels that God wants us to go but Peter gives us the levels we go from glory to Glory Hallelujah God God shows us the levels we're supposed to go up that's the firmness God wants us to have Hallelujah is staying true to those attributes and of course that's what Peter says in second Peter uh chapter 1 so we don't want to compromise as much in 2025 how how many want to be more faithful in 202 you want to be more firm you should be because you're drawing closer to God hallelujah you're hearing God's word more often Hallelujah so often you know my wife and I were talking on the way here so often we forget when we have two services on a Sunday and a Wednesday night and and all these gatherings it's a lot of gatherings it's it's it's actually more worship and hearing the word and meditating on God than most churches and it's not it's not a competition but it is a dedication Hallelujah it is showing more dedic a to the things of God it's allowing your character to be formed and and uh conformed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so our church is beautiful if we have moral Excellence if we're firm in our convictions on the word of God hallelujah now the same word firm the word firm is only used one time in the New Testament I think 10 times the Old Testament but I didn't look up the Old Testament uh but the same Greek word is the word sure like 2 Peter 1:10 the statute of perfect man wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall do what things these things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity if you do those things you'll never fall away hallelujah amen what a promise amen you mean I'll never bring reproach upon Christ I'll never go back in the world I'll never go back to those bad habits yes you'll never go back if you're firm if you're sure if if you let Jesus develop your Godly character Hallelujah you'll never go back you never have to worry about falling away if you let Jesus build your character one step at a time Hallelujah now what we forget often is that once you know once once we think well I'm born again I've got the cap sewn of Charity we forget that our minds our human spirits still need all of those anointings they still need renewed that's why I leave it up there because I need that every day every day I need Faith every day I need virtue which is uh public strength to to live an example before people publicly I need knowledge I need to understand why I'm doing the things I'm doing I need Temperance uh control over my bodily passions Hallelujah uh I need patience especially with God when I feel like well things aren't going my way Lord I've served you all these years why aren't things changing well you can you got to have patience with God hallelujah God's writing your story Hallelujah God's taking you on a journey God's in control amen hallelujah God works at the pace of perfection Hallelujah need some brother uh some uh sorry after knowledge Temperance patience we need some godliness to be just like God loving the unlovable Hallelujah and then we need brotherly kindness we need to be good to God's family Hallelujah so we're thankful so a church our church will be beautiful if we constantly are faithful to the commands of God that's character Hallelujah and brother bam said character is a victory now I'm going to read uh just a small portion on of chapter four of the church age book brother Adam said Israel could not figure out God's love they thought love meant no suffering I just want to remind you and I of that just because we suffer doesn't mean God doesn't love us that's what Israel thought oh I'm suffering I must have done something bad God must not love me exactly the opposite God knows the only thing that will teach us certain lessons is to suffer Hallelujah Israel thought the that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elected love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happens his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation Hallelujah so God's love is proven by the fact that I'm chosen to receive the word of God I'm chosen to believe the truth I was chosen to hear the truth hallelujah so many people in my family weren't chosen but I was chosen amen that's proof God loves me Hallelujah so many friends so many co-workers were not chosen to believe the truth but you were chosen Hallelujah let's read that 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 I think it's 13 but um I'm I'm not sure I I went over that scripture this week I Was preparing a lesson but didn't get yeah it is 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren be loved of the Lord because God from the beginning chosen you salvation through sanctification of the spirit and what the belief of the truth the very fact you believe the truth that proves God chose you to be his child God's sheep hear his voice Hallelujah a stranger they will not follow that's the reason you can't go to other churches and I'm not talking in the message I'm talking about outside the message that's the reason you can't go to a Catholic church because you you can't hear you you don't listen to voice of strangers that voice doesn't make sense that doesn't attract you but the voice of the word the voice of Jesus Christ it draws you in Hallelujah it's the only voice that you can receive and say Amen to so be it is the voice of the shepherd the great Shepherd Hallelujah I always remember that video you know uh there was a real Shepherd out somewhere and there was all the Sheep are on the hill I probably told you about it numerous times but it's it's worth retell it again and there's all these uh tourists and the shepherd taught three different tourists the the cry for the Sheep it was something like a Yodo Yodo yodel something like a yod I'm not a Yoder so I'm not going to embarrass myself but uh he let each one do the yodel really loud a man a woman another man and each time the Sheep didn't even look up and the shepherd said now watch this watch how they know the voice of the shepherd and the shepherd doesn't do it very loud he just does the YOLO yod Yoda and the Sheep all perk up they come running to the shepherd because the shepherd gave the command that's how we should feel when we hear the word of God preach Hallelujah with the right Revelation behind it we should come running to the the word not running away not ignoring the word we should come and obey the word hallelujah that's what a real sheep does a real sheep obeys the word of God hallelujah and how how are you chosen because you would believe the truth hallelujah and notice God chose you I love that that that's the other side that's God's perspective on predestination right our perspective is I chose God I chose the message I filed the message I left denominations but God's perspective is I chose you and they both work perfectly Hallelujah that's right brother Ram says God May commit you to suffering as he did job that's his prerogative so you got to understand God has a purpose for your life and it's not for you to tell God what your purpose is it's for you to accept God on what God's purpose is for your life it's God's prerogative he's Sovereign but in all this there's a purpose if he did not have a purpose he'd be the author of frustration not a peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered so many times we have to suffer in order to obey better the next time around in very plain language brother brandom says the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and Paul said he's left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him could come to a place of perfection Hallelujah so Church our heart should be Lord help me to endure whatever suffering you allow in my life so I can have a character like Christ's character so I can obey the truth like Christ obeyed the truth that's the purpose of suffering Hallelujah right a little bit of a a little bit of a trial a little bit of mocking a little bit of made fun of a little a little bit of short money in your pocket that'll make you pray more Hallelujah it'll make you listen to a few more sermons Hallelujah it'll make you read your Bible more Hallelujah unless you're disobedient unless you harden your neck but the Bible said don't Harden your hearts right soften your heart go to God draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh to you Hallelujah that's what God wants us to have soft hearts that we can be drawn to him brother raham said unless you suffer with him you cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reain so see church if we want to be in the Millennium we've got to be able to suffer now and still be a Christian for us it's going to be mostly rejected by family um at one point the laws will change uh we haven't seen it uh maybe on us but we can see it more on conservatives in America we've seen it the last four years to the the greatest degree it's ever been and we don't know what we'll have to suffer but we got to be willing to suffer because Christ will build our character that way he said character is never made without suffering you'll never obey God better until you suffer right which one of you after having a a just a easy week wake up on the next day and say I can't wait to read my Bible it usually doesn't happen that way usually we wake up and we think about all the great things that could happen today but if we if we have a few days then we wake up in the morning we actually we go to bed at night saying God have mercy God hear my prayer God and then we get up and we want to spend time with God hallelujah let's be honest with ourselves Hallelujah let's be honest with God that's the main thing let's be honest with God character is never going to be made you and I are never going to obey God better unless we suffer Hallelujah now sometimes it's our own fault right and sometimes it's just character development Hallelujah if it's our fault let's accept correction so we don't have to go through this again Hallelujah but if it's not our fault we'd say and we're living true then we know it's a testing it's a testing it's a proving of our character to bring forth more obedience more thankfulness Hallelujah more hope more faith then he says character is a victory not a gift Hallelujah all of you probably got Christmas gifts that's not what character is oh look how beautiful what a beautiful rap gift this is that's not how God gives you character God gives you character by suffering trials tests not in a beautiful package oh I can't wait to untie this bow and unwrap this beautiful wrapping paper that's not how God gives character it's through suffering it's through hard times Hallelujah he says a man without character can't rign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation Hallelujah the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval they're no sign whether things are going good or bad that's not a sign of God's approval or disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of God's love and approval his approval of any of us is in the Beloved his love is a Ive which we he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ah yes but how should we know we shall know because he said so Hallelujah and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him in 2025 by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he he and his wisdom allows to come to pass then he says the people of God are not Material minded now as providers I have to be in one way I have to be uh I got to go provide I got to go buy uh groceries I got to get uh Insurance paid I got to go shovel the the the the I got to go shovel the sidewalk I got to go buy toilet paper or paper towels I my my mind is materially minded in that sense I have to provide but it's the love of materials that's the sin the Love of Money the love of material things that's the trouble we got to get into sorry that's the trouble we got to get out of Hallelujah and get it out of our minds Hallelujah see and so actually when I'm providing for my family I'm doing the next sense he says they are christm minded when I'm doing all I can do to provide for the church or provide for my family I'm being christm minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above Hallelujah so the kingdom of God is not Material he said the kingdom of God is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things uh Casa pull up Romans uh 5 verse 1 through five therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Church there was a time in my life I had to quote this to in order to remember I had peace with God I felt like I was failing God I felt like God was against against me I felt felt felt anybody catch the wrong word there feelings your feelings don't matter facts don't care about your feelings thank you bop hero but there's a time I felt oh God doesn't love me and so I had to go to bed quoting this I have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah I remember I had a Bible app to memorize this specific verse and the next few verses after this I had to preach that to myself I had to come up and preach I come up my soul preach that to myself till I believe it and now I believe it praise God I have peace with God how do I know because Jesus's blood forgave all my sins Hallelujah I'm a Child of God hallelujah I took him at his word that's what his word says by whom also we have access by faith into this grace church I'm not living in law I'm living in Grace and like Simon's message said that's God's grace if there's more time I need to give God if if I've been unfaithful with my time then Lord I'm giving that time back to you praise God that's but I'm living in Grace I'm not living in law I'm living in Grace Hallelujah by Faith by faith I have a revelation Assurance I'm living in Grace I have peace with God and when God needs to help me to obey better he'll let me suffer in Grace Hallelujah but it's all all in the grace of God I've you you and I have already passed from Death condemnation into life once I believed in Jesus I've already left death and now I'm living in life Hallelujah you and I will never come into condemnation our sins will never be remembered before God God has already forgotten all your sins hallelujah amen he's already forgotten all your sins praise God we rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also we don't always Glory right away but once we get through the tribulation then we can have Glory think of the tribulations you went through in 2024 now that you're through it you can look back and say thank God I give God glory he brought me through that I didn't know how this had never happened to me before I didn't know how I was going to get out of this but God brought me out I'm giving God the Glory we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation Works patience so see sometimes we get impatient on the statute of man God's got to give us a trial to build back up our faith our virtue knowledge our Temperance and our patience and patience experience now that word means tested character so first God's going to give you a trial Hallelujah that'll give give you patience you go up trial patience then you get character and once you're mature with character then God gives you hope and that's the steadfast expectation God has something good in store for me hope it's not hopeless it's not character produces depression character produces hope Hallelujah that's why Christians ought to be happy Hallelujah because the trials will bring us to pain patience patience will give us Godly character we're more moral we're excellent in our moral decisions we're more firm in our our convictions we won't compromise as much and then God gives us hope for the future Oh Glory Hallelujah verse five and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us so when you have the hope when you have character then you have hope you're unashamed of the Gospel you know God's called you he's elected you he loves you Hallelujah the trials he allowed are for your good God can't get any gooder he can't get any more good so it's for your good Hallelujah and God can't love you any more tomorrow than he does right now praise God Amen he's he's loving you with an infinite love Hallelujah if we'll just open up our minds uh to remember the promises of God and the character of God hallelujah we remember how much he loves us and then he pours that love right into our hearts it's shed the love ofro the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts I've heard people say this before when they got the Holy Ghost it felt like God was pouring Liquid Love in their soul that's kind of what it is God opens up your soul and he pours his love into your soul close it back up Charity see because before we didn't have all that love but but now we have love now we have now we can trust God and we go through hard times when we can fight past all the Mind battles and the trials in our flesh and really get down to our soul what do we believe what do we feel we love God we find love is the anchor of our souls Hallelujah the love of God is the anchor of our souls okay now I want to show a quick visual that was just my uh few that was just my warmup on uh character that's not in brother Ram's sermon so let's see if this will work out here we're on God hiding him himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same no did Simon change any of the let me try it again I mean I did all this work on slides technolog is not going to work here today all right well okay this I'll keep trying here just one more second let's try it again says the adapter's in there you go back and you cycle through again go to HDMI HDMI 1 let go to the hdmis may just a simple visual wanted to show a few uh quotes and then a visual of the Seven Seals series okay try one more time I'm going to turn it off and plug it back in let's try one more time so brother Brandon preached nine sermons basically during A8 day stretch from March 27th to March 24th 1963 and just on a side note how many know this is the 60th year 2025 since brother ran passed away so we come up on Christmas of this year Lord willing in December of 2025 that'll be 60 years uh since uh brother brandham had has been off the scene and I think about I just reminded I've been reading through Jeremiah and they went 70 years outside of the promised land and I just it was just interesting to me you know uh it' be interesting how long God allows us to have a a Ministry without God's Prophet being here so it's just interesting to me now that's really strange okay I'm GNA try one more thing let's see if this will work here I'll try my phone this worked yeah this worked last week right because I didn't show the video well praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus I just wanted you to see it you know it's just a simple chart these are the days of the week uh brother R so what I'm preaching right now is God hiding himself in Simplicity that was the morning service on March 17th in the evening he preached the breach I already preached the breach to you that was M mainly about the lamb taking the book and were're redeemed uh by the blood of the Lamb the breach was between the church ages and Seven Seals first seal Monday second seal Tuesday third seal Wednesday uh fourth seal Thursday fifth seal Friday six seal Saturday night and then Sunday morning questions and answers on the seals and then Sunday P PM was the seventh seal okay it's going to be okay all right well praise the Lord I think what happens is it just can't handle all the different devices you know we go from Simon's device my phone iPad MacBook they got the Pro laptop all these things anyways that's just my two cents now uh I'm G just leave that up there for oh she's out so leave it up there anyway uh brother BR said this sermon was evangelism which means just a broad uh sermon just it's just declaring truths in the Bible and that's different than we we call teaching teaching is when you teach all the verses in a certain section and you teach on the word of God you give instruction on what the scripture says uh later brother R we'll get to this maybe next week brother B said the Seven Seals were teaching uh the word teaching means instruction so when brother Brandon was revealing the meaning of the symbols verse by verse he was teaching on them as well so see you can teach with Revelation Hallelujah brother Ram said I have a message on evangelism this morning to build in my message coming up so this he calls this an evangelism message and then he starts getting into teaching the seals starting there and he teaches on seals the rest of the week by God's grace brother Ram said uh tonight I want to take the fifth chapter of Revelation which is blending in from the church ages unto the Seven Seals Hallelujah so now remember uh in Revelation 5 uh the the 24 Elders said he's redeemed Us by his blood and made us Kings and Priests unto God hallelujah so that's what the breach message was about it was about Jesus taking the book right Jesus broke the seals he sent down the book down to earth Hallelujah and then we can understand we're redeemed which means were bought out of the pawn shop Hallelujah recently I've been given like six coins on silver coins anybody been giv silver coins lately so instead of like people buying me presents they've been giving me silver coins I'm about ready to take them to the pawn shop and get some cash for but I know silver might go up and then I'd kick myself so but it's just this idea I could go to the pawn shop and get something out of the pawn shop right and when I get it like let's say there's a nice uh this is there's a nice blender in there if I buy that blender out of there I redeemed the blender out it's now mine and that's what Jesus says about us Jesus Paid the price he shed his blood and now he purchases US Jesus has a hold of you hallelujah amen Jesus brought you out of the pawn shop of sin Hallelujah he bought you he paid for you and so he brings you unto himself Hallelujah and that's what the breach message is it's letting us know Jesus Paid the price he brings us out of the sin of the pawn shop Hallelujah and then he makes us a king and a priest Hallelujah who wants to who wants to live under a king who's got good character who wants to live under a president that's got good character hopefully this next one we'll see by God's grace if they let him get in we'll see but Jesus asked us to be Kings and Priests so we need Godly character we need Christlike character Hallelujah glory to God now brother says now I don't know what what these seals mean I'm just as much at my end of wits to them as perhaps some of you are this morning we have ecclesiastical ideas that's been presented by man but that will never touch it if you'll see it it has to come by inspiration it must be God himself it is the only one that can do it is the Lamb so in this sermon brother man admits when I preach these seals I I'm at my Wit's End I have no idea what they mean God has to give me inspiration Hallelujah and that's what the Bible says the Bible says the scripture is of no private interpretation Hallelujah so nobody can tell you what the Bible means except God gives some man the inspiration for it hallelujah praise God that's right that's out of second Peter chapter 2 not going to read that today but I love what brother Ram admits he says uh he says I don't even know what they mean now I want to back up and show brother R under the first seal he said the white horse rider was who who remembers the white horse rider was the Antichrist right later we know his name we know his name on Thursday night what's his name death it's the same writer I'm yeah it's the same writer it's death it's the Antichrist Spirit brother B tells us these seals were given with thus sayeth the Lord so the symbols the meaning of the symbols and the meaning of the seals is thus sayith the lord it's God's interpretation of the seals sometimes we take that for granted we don't want to take that for granted Hallelujah if you haven't read your seven seal book yet if you haven't read your church age book yet you better get reading them Hallelujah you'll understand the gospel more you'll draw close to God church we got to be drawing closer to God not closer to the world Hallelujah right now we uh we in our Bible reading our our time we uh we finished up all these American history in the Bible now we're going into my teaching videos each night we're watching part of a teaching video and I'm giv instruction on it uh because I've made 400 some videos I want my children to see them by God's grace so I'm teaching my children at night time then we'll probably switch back to the church age book or something like that or the seven seal book because we've already done the church age book once for the whole family but I want you to see brother random said with thus sayith the Lord the white horse rider was the Antichrist Spirit who knows what he said three years before that does anybody know what he said three years before that it was the Holy Spirit which is what complete opposite in 1960 on December 11th brother said the sixth chapter deals with the White Horse which was the Holy Spirit went forth conquering and to conquer So within a matter of three years brother God gives brother Ram the Revelation and brother Ram says in the first seal he said I would have made an awful mistake preaching this seal if it had it been for the Holy Spirit which swept into my room at noon church that's what we we need we need God to sweep into our lives and show us the real interpretation of God's word hallelujah hallelujah so three years before he said oh it's it's the Holy Spirit he's going forth conquering he's shooting a bow all these things but then three years later the spirit of God visits him and said it's the Antichrist Spirit total opposite and that's true with our own understanding our ideas about how our lives are going will be totally opposite of what God's ideas are about them until we get God's ideas Church we're lost until we get God's interpretation Hallelujah God has to interpret our lives for us and show us what is my life all about which direction is my life going it'll be totally opposite of what we think many times but that's isn't that the scripture God said my ways are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts that's why he's God hallelujah so we see that here he says uh I have no idea but then God visits him every day sometimes uh he said sometimes the pillar of fire would hang there for an hour and he show the vision of what he seal was and he he'd write it down and then he said I'll spend the rest of the day going through the scripture making sure this Revelation lined up with the rest of the Bible amen hallelujah now getting back here to God hiding himself in Simplicity brother R says now the reason I'm not announcing prayers meetings for the sick is is because I'm staying with some friends I'm giving every minute of my time to study and prayer he says and you know the vision I had just before leaving and going out west of those seven angels come flying so you'll understand a little later okay so here we are we are in right now we're listening to him preach in March of 1963 but he says all this is based upon a vision I had three months ago February January December right he says and you'll understand a little later and to be honest church I've been a message believer for 24 years I'm still trying to understand parts of these Visions right brother Jose I'm but here I can really nail it down today so this Vision we're going to go through today was a prophecy and it was a prophecy foretold three months in advance that brother random was going to have the third pole of his ministry or the third phase of his ministry and brother R even calls it my new commission the first commission he would hold hands with a sick person and the dots on his hand would tell him what disease it was the second commission was he would stand there and see Visions between him and the patient on his right side he would see visions and tell them the thoughts and intents and secrets of their heart but now the third the third part or third phase was for him to just speak the word hallelujah God would give him what to say he'd say it praise God hallelujah and so this is the vision he had now here he is in h December so let's read through this now I know that's small so I apologize I thought it would look bigger than that I could see those angels those shape back Wings traveling faster than sound could travel they come from eternity in a split like a twink of an eye not enough to bat your eye just a twink they were there so it's a vision of seven angels coming to him I didn't have time to count I didn't have no more than just look mighty ones great powerful angels Snow White Wings set and heads up and they were woo woo and when it did I was caught up in this pyramid a constellation now notice this is December 30th 1962 and I thought now this is it I was numbed all over and I said oh my this means there's going to be a blast that would kill me so he sees these seven angels come to him there's a big blast and he thinks oh my someone's going to kill me and I'm at the end of my road now I mustn't tell my people when this Vision leaves I don't want them to know about it but the Heavenly father's let me know now that my time is finished and I won't tell my family so they'll not worry about me because he's fixing to go and these angels has come for me and I'll be killed pretty soon now in some kind of explosion okay he says and then it came to me while I was in the constellation so brother seven angels coming in there's an explosion he he's caught up in the constellation in other words he meets with the angels no that isn't it so the a one of the Angels corrects him if it would it would have killed you it would have killed Joseph and I could hear Joseph calling me because Joseph was there in the vision well then I turned again I thought Lord what does this vision mean and I wondered and then it come to me not a voice just come to me oh that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me my new Commission so the Angels come to him there's an explosion he's caught up and he gets a new commission it's the third pole it's the third and final stage of his ministry Hallelujah and when I thought that I raised up my hands I said oh Lord Jesus what will you have me to do and the vision left me for almost an hour I couldn't field now then after the vision a few paragraphs later brother says I'm standing in an awful place if you but knew it remember I tell you in the name of the Lord I've told you the truth something is fixing to happen so in December thus sayith the Lord something's going to happen and then it happens for him in March Hallelujah the beginning of March by God's grace so he meets the seven angels now here he is in January a month after a month after having the vision here in January of 63 I'm here in Phoenix tonight in the name of the Lord I would not try to explain what's happened many you people take the tapes be sure to get that one what time is it sir that was just before I left home a vision sent me here I don't know okay now this picture was taken on February 28th 1963 in Arizona so Arizona we got a nice connection to Arizona because this is where God met brother random now this was taken on February 28th now either brother random was translated there by Vision which could be scriptural or uh he was there on March 6th or 7th a few days about a week after that and the angels remained there and then he saw them in another uh another Vision by God's grace it's either one of those hallelujah it's hard to tell from the quotes but physically brother Ram couldn't have been there on February 28th because he was down in Texas pleading for the life of two people that were on death row and God heard his prayer and the people were leted off a death row so God used brother Ram to spare two teenage lives okay but then brother Ram looks at this months later he says this was those angels now he says these are angel wings somehow and of course we know if we turn it sideways it looks like Christ the white head of Christ there in Revelation chapter 10 Hallelujah so that's the prophecy Church the prophecy was in the name of the Lord how many believe that by God's grace now why is this important because if we've had a prophet visit us then his prophecies must come to pass that's what Deuteronomy says that's what Jeremiah says that's how you know a prophet he must have a vision and it must come to pass and it must be spoken in the name of the Lord you know there's so many false prophets out there some of them say said uh you know by 2023 Israel will have a two-state solution and look how Israel is just fighting for their lives prophets Benny Hinn said that another uh man named Chris Reed said that false prophecies those men are not sent by God to prophesy but here's a man who announces it he says I'm going to meet seven angels I'm going to go into my new commission it's in the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God hallelujah and then it happened Hallelujah now the following week I'm going to go back uh I'm going to go back here so he announces this on Sunday morning the following week on the final service in the seventh seal he told the vision of receiving the king's sword so the word was given to him uh to preach the Seven Seals then he met up with the seven angels and the voice of God telling him to go back to Jeffersonville go back East for the revelation of the Seven Seals so as prophesied in December 62 in the name of the Lord and then it was fulfilled in March well February and March of 1963 Hallelujah now in this sermon right here look what brother R has to say after three months brother has to say but look just let me say this now he says you don't get it see and you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything don't try to put your interpretation to it you only get further away just take my advice if God has given me favor in your sight them Revelations I've been here with you a long time see it's always been right now to double prove it it hooks right in with the word of the Lord so you know it's thus sayith the Lord so brother I'm saying the vision I had about the angels and then the revelation of these seals it's thus sayeth the Lord so I think we should understand that praise God the importance of the Seven Seals the importance of this week of sermons it's so important because it's power over the devil praise God as Simon said it's like us like Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus and whatever receive by Revelation it can never be taken from us don't you know Satan's trying to take the faith out of your heart don't you know Satan's trying to take your joy Satan's trying to take your courage Your Love he's trying to take all these things but if it's a real Revelation he can never take it Hallelujah that's why this is so important so see if people get some of these things taken away from either they're not born again or just taken out of their human Spirit but a child of God has received Revelation and the gates of hell are not more powerful the Revelation is more powerful than all the gates of hell all the demon powers that could come against us hallelujah amen and we've been visited by a prophet of God in this day Hallelujah my he said take my advice as your brother don't you try to interpret anything you just live go on and live a good Christian Life with character because you only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it you only wind your way again away from the thing now look at the statement brother man says now this one's actually in questions and answers in the morning all of you are conscience and knows there's something mysterious happening and it is happening I know what it is I'm just not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it but so help me god with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it's been told you before what was it the vision of the Seven Angels it's been told you before so just don't try to put any interpretation just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour and then later that night brother Ram tells us that's what it was the vision of the Seven Angels he's saying has been fulfilled he says remember the vision of the constellation so brother B had a vision of this here you are something was going on I told you all week it's been all around you but I wonder if you noticed it remember the constellation of the vision of the Angels when I left here to go to Arizona everybody says amen you remember what time it is Sir you remember that notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appeared is that right one burst of thunder seven angels appear and I saw the lamb when he opened the first seal okay read that now notice one Thunder seven messages that's been sealed up up and cannot be revealed until the last day of this age see what it mean Hallelujah so brother ra says his vision was of seven angels coming to to him to meet him so that the the revelation of the Seven Seals could be open to us H Allelujah think about that the seals had not been open for 2,000 years but brother R saying this is what it was I had a vision seven angels came to me to give me the revelation of the Seven Seals in other words the Bible scriptures are being fulfilled right before your very eyes hallelujah oh my Hallelujah and remember school was so important he didn't let his wife and children skip school to come and see the Fulfillment of Revelation chapter 6 and Revelation chapter 10 now to me church I don't understand that all I can say is that God was probably hiding himself because that's what God likes to do even in other words brother Ram didn't even fully realize till maybe he got there preaching the Seven Seals how magnificent this was church I hope you're catching it Revelation 10 1:7 has been fulfilled in our day Hallelujah let's read it Revelation 10 verse1 remember we went through this a few months ago brother Ram said this is history and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was over his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire we believe this is Jesus in the form of the Holy Spirit and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a l cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not remember the first sermon after brother preached Seven Seals he said I just he said go listen to what sir what time is it it's called The Seven Thunder sermon so the visitation of the Seven Angels was connected to the seven Thunders because I believe each each Angel gave him thus sayith the Lord the voice of God which was a thunder because a thunder is a voice of God hallelujah amen verse five and the angel which I saw s upon the sea and upon the Earth was lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein that are and the earth and the things are therein are and the Sea and things which are therein that there should be time no longer or delay no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets Hallelujah so brother Ram said that's what it's been it's not been a human being a man it's been the seven angels of the Lord think about this church these people are sitting listening to these sermons let me go back there they're they're listening to brother preach the first seal and most of them didn't even know an angel came that morning or that at noon an angel visited one of the Seven Angels came and gave brother bam the true interpretation Hallelujah and brother B's like it's been going all around you but you missed it he said you're not supposed to get it because it only comes to the prophet Hallelujah glory and then the next day a second angel visited brother brandom and the third day a third Angel fourth Angel fifth angel sixth angel a seventh angel seven angels visit brother brandom to give him the seven Thunders to open the book of God to finish the mysteries of God and now we know the revelation of the mysteries of God and brother Chris that's what I wrote that blue book about was the mysteries of God all 12 of those Mysteries remember that one okay good so that that's that's that's what Revelation 10:7 the mystery of God should be finished that's why God sent these angels to brother bam to give us thus sayith the Lord on the godhead Hallelujah amen if you want to refresher on let us make men in our image I just put the video out last night so if you want to go watch that you can watch it after service let us make men in our image God has to use a a plural pronoun because he has multiple manifestations Hallelujah like Jesus or God said let us what does US mean us means the invisible god with the visible Pillar of Fire logos Hallelujah remember the light wasn't God God was in the light I'm getting real deep here now by God's grace God's invisible you'll never see God you never have no one's ever seen the invisible spirit of God because he's invisible but he had to make himself visible Hallelujah and then the Bible said God created All Things by Jesus Christ and Jesus is the word hallelujah so no wonder God would say let us because it's father and son it's invisible and visible Hallelujah I know it's deep and Rich Hallelujah notice he says and then he talks about the men that were Witnesses when he uh was a part of this Vision that must have been in March 6th or March 7th 1963 he said I was picking a cocko bur or a thorn off my sambers off my trouser trouser leg and a blast went off that almost looked like shook the mountain down so there's the Fulfillment brother R's out in this mountain there's some Mountain near here and the blast goes off and there's there men that were Witnesses of the blast Hallelujah I never told my brethen but they noticed a difference in me and he said to meow be ready go east here's the interpretation of that vision and I was in the west and the angels coming east and as they came by I was picked up with them you remember me coming east he says what was it it was because this is what it was exactly what it was and knowing that I couldn't say it till it happened to see if the people would understand it oh Church did the people understand it no but that's normal usually God's people don't catch it at first God normally shows it to a prophet Church John the Baptist preached for six months and the Bible said he'd ra he'd raised up The Valleys bring down the mountains and when he died the disciples are like when is Elijah going to come and Jesus like he's already came and you didn't even know it all these prophecies were fulfilled right in front of them the preaching of the word John the Baptist the spirit of Elijah and it goes by and brother Church it just goes right over their head it just Pro and they were elected it just proves God will let you know something when he wants you to know it praise God but brother man for told this three months in advance and then when it happened he it went he had to go back to the go back to uh Jeffersonville and preach the revelation of those Seven Seals here for seven days in a row by the grace of God scriptures been fulfilled in our day no wonder brother could say this day this scripture is fulfilled Hallelujah glory to God brother R said one day when when I was in Sabin Sabino Canyon that's up in Sabino Canyon God called me early in the morning up there I was with my hands there praying and a sword came into my hands I stood there and looked at it and a voice said this is the sword of the king and later when the angel of the Lord revealed it it was the word in the hand so what is the third poll it's you with the word I just preached it a few weeks ago the full armor of God each one of you carry the word of God but you've got to use it you've got to fight against Satan you got to fight against Satan with God's word and then Satan will give up and leave for a season but you've got to fight how many want to fight the devil praise God you got to fight don't don't don't don't drop your sword as we said don't take off your Shield or your breastplate or your helmet keep the armor of God on Hallelujah he said and then immediately after that the angels of the Lord appeared and told me about the Seven Seals that I was returned back here to Jeffersonville and preach the Seven Seals and there if I've ever said anything that was inspired it was in that there were the angel of the Lord met us and the Bible become a new Bible because remember before the Bible said the White Horse he thought the Bible said the white horse riders the Holy Spirit now oh now the mask is off now the white horse riders not the holy spirit it's the Antichrist Spirit oh it's a brand new Bible now I can understand it it's not the Holy Spirit going out to conquer people it's the Antichrist Spirit going out to conquer people hallelujah it became a brand new Bible there opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was the complete Revelation I hope this blesses somebody it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ alog together new to us am see I I don't know I just hope I hope everybody feels the same way I do when I was in denominations I only heard Jesus preached one way but when I came to the message Jesus became altogether new he he Jesus no longer was a compromiser with sin Jesus was holy Jesus was God hallelujah he's God In the Flesh Emmanuel God With Us the Bible became a brand new Bible now I can understand The Book of Revelation amen now I can understand the Book of Daniel now I can live my marriage the right way I know marriage and divorce now I can understand gifts and anointings and just because people have the right anointing you got to look at the seed inside of them what kind of Life do they live are there work are they workers of righteousness or are they workers of iniquity in their daily lives Hallelujah just Revelations that became a brand new Bible to me Hallelujah it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ altogether new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which has always been I was so inspired and directed Hallelujah now in uh June of 1963 so uh that was February March April May June four months later brother R says and the Blasted exactly the way I said it is that right brother Fred I must have jumped way off the ground just above me was the angels of the Lord that the the that sent message back for me to come here and break the seals Hallelujah so friends this is so important for our day because a prophetic Vision was fulfilled in our day Hallelujah the mysteries of God are finished glory to God and see our our thing we have to make sure we do is make sure we keep eating the fruit of God because that's what they are they're 12 Mysteries 12 loaves of bread now church we'll see in our life if we get weak it's because we're not feeding on the word right like you've heard it before well it's happened to probably all of you let's say you husbands right your wife has a good meal ready when you get home but you kind of stop at the store you maybe like me sometimes you'll stop at your pole you didn't know supper was going to be made and so you get home and you're not really hungry for the nice meal that was prepared that seven seal meal by God's grace and church that's what we are if we eat on the wrong thing then the word of God's Not fresh to us so Church the question is what are we feeding on the character of a Christian will feed on the word of God hallelujah amen hallelujah see the reason we're not hungry for the word is because we're not feeding on the word is that right church amen that's right it's it's exactly the scripture if if if if brother sermon made this a complete revelation of Jesus Christ and we don't want to spend time on the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and something's more important to us than the complete revelation of Jesus Christ amen and the church said Hallelujah the church we can't let it become common to us remember we're I said earlier it's still true we're living in Grace but Satan's trying to make us live in disgrace we got to live in the grace of God hallelujah let's go read those seals real quick let's go to uh Revelation 61 I'm coming down to closer Revelation 61 and church I've done my studies if you know if you've been paying attention or if you remember I've done videos on all the Seven Seals uh accusers of brother brandom have said brother BR plagiarized he did not there's over 38 differences between brother brandham and Clarence Larin Charles T Russell and euriah Smith founders of Jehovah's Witnesses founder of sday Adventist and a Baptist preacher Clarence Clarence Lin these people just I don't know why they just lie I don't know why maybe it's because it's either on purpose or it's uh ignorant Hallelujah now let me get some pull up here Revelation 61 looking for a little note here oh no it's not going to going find it there Revelation 61 so in other words church we have thus sayith the Lord on 1 and two and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see which Beast was that we have thus sayth the Lord we know which Beast it was which Beast was it the lion thus sayith the Lord come and see and I saw Behold a white horse brother thought it was the Holy Spirit who is it the Antichrist and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer brother said the bow is the of lie Satan shoots fiery darts how many know the book of Peter Peter shooting fiery darts if you don't put up the shield of a revelation you're going to get hit you're going to live in pain you're going to live in depression or fear or anxiety or stress or anger or whatever more lust if you don't put up the shield you get hit and you're in pain because that's how he comes he shoots Brother Chris do you have a question every brother that's what I'm getting to next very good very good brother no you're fine that's great it's great brother great I'm used to getting questions that's how I want to be and a crown was given un him brother R said you can't Crown a spirit so the E the Antichrist Spirit went through preachers at first but then he got a crown which means uh the Antichrist Spirit went into a pope so in the early churches they started getting a pope and they put a crown in the pope now now he wears a crown or he can wear a crown at some sometimes not when he travels when he's in certain places in the Vatican who wear a crown in other words the Antichrist became a ruler he started ruling through the Roman Catholic church and the pope because Revelation 17- 18 is all about that mother Harlot the worst of all the prostitutes that's the Roman Catholic Church she's the greatest enemy to the church the true church and who's the head of the Roman Catholic Church the pope and we and we're not guessing we've got thus sayith the Lord hallelujah and he went forth conquering and to conquer now I preach it like this church the white horse rider is going to try to ride into your life and deceive you he's going to try to shoot a bow of Lies I think it was Hosea says he shoots the bow of lies he's going to tell you a lie and if you believe it it'll hurt your walk with God but if you put up your Shield it'll distinguish every fiery Dart of the enemy praise God then you can be healthy then you can be strong then you can be a good soldier of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so now you know what Satan's doing he's going around and the these are all these are all uh successive stages of the Antichrist spirit because remember James 1 has the four steps of sin uh sin enticed uh sin I'm sorry lust enticed I forget the next one and then sin and then death there's four stages of death there's four horse riders verse three and when he open the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see who's the second beast the ox I'm sorry I'm sorry Beast yeah the first Beast was the lion second was the ox labor so the first seal was like the first 300 years or so 400 years of church history the next seal was like from 400 on uh till almost a thousand ad verse four and there went out a horse that was red and power was given on him red means the blood power was given him to take uh that sat there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword so from 400 so ad to a th000 ad the Catholic Church started getting per to kill dissenters right one man uh uh what's the name uh Samuel Schmucker he had a he had a list he had a role he put a he started recording a record and he said over 60 million Christians were killed on just those records by the Roman Catholic Church no wonder she's drunken with the blood of the Saints in Revelation 17 verse three I'm sorry verse five and when he open the four the third seal I heard the the third Beast say come and see and I be beh held a low a black horse now black horse represents the Dark Ages so about a th000 ad to about 1500 ad maybe 1,600 because Martin Luther brought us out of the Dark Ages Hallelujah a black horse and when he sat on me had a pair of of balances in his hand now we're told about that and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the 4B say a measure of wheat for a penny so it's like food for money right making sure it's equal what you pay for is what you get he says uh three measur of barley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine brother raham said what was the Catholic Church doing they were capturing the wealth of the world in other words the Catholic Church Controlled all the economics the Catholic Church Controlled the Kings right there right uh the the kings in uh Great Britain and England all those kings in Italy the Catholic Church Controlled all of them the Catholic Church Controlled economics so he went from deception white uh to Red violence and murder and then he went to Kingdom building under the uh under the the Dark Ages we got thus say the Lord hallelujah amen and so he determines the prices of of everything so he can capture the wealth of the world but a voice Cries Out Hallelujah a voice in the midst of the throne said hurt not the oil and the wine Hallelujah Glory that brother BR said that's Jesus saying Satan don't hurt them they've got the oil they've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they've got wine they've got the stimulation of Revelation see you can't hurt a believer's experience with God hallelujah even suffering will produce character Hallelujah you can't hurt it it looks like yeah we're going through pain we're going through suffering and Satan looks like he's trying to hurt us but Jesus said you can't hurt them all things are work together for good to them that love the Lord hallelujah even after you're suffering you'll come out giving God more Glory more praise more appreciation more Thanksgiving for what God has allowed because it's making you more like Jesus Hallelujah and you've got a complete revelation of Jesus Christ with a brand new Bible oh my Hallelujah glory to God verse seven now I finally feel like preaching Hallelujah no I'm just kidding verse seven and when he open the fourth seal who's the fourth Beast fourth Beast is the flying eagle so this is the age we're living in I'm sorry the third Beast was uh the man that's the intelligence of man uh represented the great Reformation through Martin Luther so third seal was Reformation coming out of the Dark Ages four seal is our day the four seal I Heard a Voice of the fourth Beast say come and see the eagle saying come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse now pale represents uh leprosy in the Old Testament uh they had pale skin that represented leprosy so this is spiritual leprosy this is a horse representing the whole church is dying the church is under death because that's the name of his writers death the Antichrist spirit is now identified it's death right it went from deceptive white to bloody red to to Black Dark Horse Dark Ages and now it's in spiritual leprosy it's doomed to die that's right brother said thus sayth the Lord the denominations are dead thus sayith the Lord hallelujah but you and I we can have life and we can have it more abundantly by the grace of God hallelujah I don't know about you but I'm living in Christ today Hallelujah I'm not dying I'm living in Jesus Christ Hallelujah we used to sing that song Alive alive alive forever more my Jesus is alive alive forever more alive alive my Jesus is Alive my Jesus is Alive sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah my Jesus is alive forever more sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah my Jesus is Alive and the church said he's alive and if he lives I live Hallelujah because Christ is in me Hallelujah and I'm dead and my life of sin is hid in God in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen that word hid means concealed all the mistakes of my past all the sins of my past are concealed they're hidden in Christ Jesus paid for all of them so all my sins are hidden my life is hidden god with Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'm alive forever more Hallelujah because Christ lives Within Me Christ lives within you let's shake ourselves today by God's grace physically not physically Shake ourselves recognize what we've been given verse eight I looked and behold a Pale Horse leprosy and his name that sat on him was death so now we know after four horse riders now we finally know his name it's death death goes to conquer right death physically kills death Kingdom builds and then we get to see death be poured out upon the whole world death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the Earth to kill with a sword this is during the armag right before Armageddon to kill with a sword with Hunger with with death and with the Beast of the earth and we've got thus say brother man said don't you ever forget it those beasts those four beasts uh lion ox man egole he said those are thus sayth the Lord don't you ever forget it in other words we need the anointing if I'm going to be an eagle and Fly Above All the cares of this world I need to have the anointing of God upon me Church we're not to live Earth bounded we're not to eat on the things of the earth hallelujah we're not supposed to compromise with Delilah we're supposed to Fly Above far above these things live so far above them that we're seated in Heavenly places Hallelujah that's the anointing for today that's what God's called us to have this anointing of the eagle that flies above it waits on the Lord and then God renews his strength like the eagle hallelujah how many waiting on the Lord today trust in the Lord you can wait on the Lord you can trust the Lord with your life Hallelujah the fifth seal and when he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them when were slain for the word of God notice not for the testimony of Jesus Christ just for the word of God these are Jews and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and Truth Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth brother R said part of these Jews are the Holocaust Jews it was 6.6 million Jews were killed probably more in the Holocaust brother see these are all the Jews for the last 2,000 years that have been persecuted and they're all crying out for vengeance Vengeance Lord Vengeance Lord and brother said see their their desire for vengeance proves they weren't born again because when you got the Holy Spirit you don't say God avenge me you say father forgive them you say father let this not be held to their charge be merciful to them that's what a Christian does but a Jew who's not born again will cry out for vengeance so God help Hallelujah God help us to not seek vengeance upon those who do evil to us but to pray for them that's right verse 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them see because they didn't have the white robes now they didn't have it while they were on Earth they were not born again on Earth they had to be given that white robe in heaven the what's the right Ro what's the right robe it's the righteousness of Jesus Christ well you've got it now you are the righteousness of Jesus Christ I was hoping for a little more Amen on that by God hold your place let's go read it so I'll prove it to you second Corinthians chapter 5:17 church if you feel dirty you you you just got to look at the Bible God does not see your sin anymore when you confess it that ought to make us happy verse 17 therefore for any man being in Christ he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath Recon SED us to Jesus by I'm Sorry by to himself by Jesus Christ and given to us the Min Ministry of reconciliation to it God was in Christ there it is the invisible was in the visible reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespass on them not your sins will not be imputed to you you cannot be punished for your sins because Jesus already took the punishment you've already got a white robe Hallelujah words you've already got the righteousness of Jesus Christ upon your soul Hallelujah and ha committed unto us the word of reconciliation so if you want some righteousness you come see me at the altar today I'll tell you about it Hallelujah I'll help you repent and get your sins under the blood of Jesus Christ so you can have the righteousness of Christ upon your life verse 20 now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ dead be ye reconciled to God so that's what preachers do now they plead with the people be H have peace with God come get peace with God come get your white robe God wants to give it to you praise God verse 21 let's all read that together ready 1 two 3 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him you are made righteousness he took on your sin so it's substitution he took all your sin so we can take on his righteousness Hallelujah I've already got a white robe brother Claude Patrick I already got a white robe I got a white shirt on I got something way more white than this Hallelujah I got the white robe of the Forgiveness the righteousness of Jesus Christ upon my soul praise God I don't ask for vengeance upon evil people I ask for Mercy Hallelujah that's the revelation of the fish seal you'd be surprised how many Christians believe uh that it's a sin to think Jews can be saved even today they think there's no hope for Jews all the Jews are lost it's so sad but why do they think that why do they think all these millions of Jews are going to hell because they don't have a revelation of the fifth seal ah but who's got it we got it by the grace of God so we should have compassion upon the Jews we should pray for the Jews now I know most of them aren't saved right just like most Americans aren't saved but we can have pray for God to have mercy on the elect the children of God who want the righteousness of Jesus Christ well I'm sorry I didn't preach Wednesday so I got a lot of preacher left in Me by God's grace here so I told you it might be a little long today Hallelujah and the robes were given unto every one of them and it was said in them that they should rest yet for a little season now brother baram says that's the tribulation period they got to rest for a little tribulation period he says uh until their fellow servants also and their Brethren so more Jews should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so the total number of Jewish Martyrs has to be filled up and then God will give them white white robes and then God will have Vengeance on him God will pour out the Vengeance and the trumpets and the vials and the woes but God has everything in its time and season verse 12 and behold when he' opened the six seal now brother man say the six seals of tribulation seal I put a video about about that last week the whole seven-year tribulation period is the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake wait no that might be the LA I don't know and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell onto the Earth what would a star do to the Earth if it fell a burning ball of gas what would that do to the Earth massive destruction even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven depart as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places think about that stars hit the earth and the mountains are brought low the islands are covered up so there's a there's a change in the in the crust of the earth there's a change in the level of the oceans God's putting wrath upon everyone in other words you can't hide in a mountain you see Zuckerberg did that he he made like a a $30 million uh Fort up there in one of the Hawaiian mountains like he's going to live in that when destruction comes that's sry you can't run from Jesus you can't dig yourself away from Jesus you can't pay your way out of that either see they they know judgment's coming right that's why they're building these uh getaways or fortresses all these things like that but the Bible said God is going to bring down all the mountains cover over all the islands that so that Island's going to be under the water that's right brother that's probably right if he doesn't know Jesus he'll probably do that but let's pray for him to repent verse 15 and the kings of the Earth the Great Men and the rich men and the chief Captain so rich men there it is Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos even Donald Trump put all the rich men in there Bill Gates all these and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains just like they're building and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth upon the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath that's Armageddon is come who shall be able to stand so all these things happen before them the battle of Armageddon Hallelujah that's during yeah this is this this is this is all describing during it and it leads up to that last battle Armageddon because it's the great day of Wrath that's the battle of Armageddon that's when Jesus destroys all the nations that's before that's right before yeah so God has to destroy the armies of the north Russia armies of the East China and all the East armies of the South probably Egypt they're really building their their Nation up right now so God has to destroy Jesus has to destroy all them that come against the lamb and then the Bible said he'll burn them with fire and then we will as Believers we walk upon the ashes of the wicked into a brand new Earth the Millennium yes sir yes sir great question brother great question okay now the seven the the seventh seal Revelation 8 verse1 and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour we believe that's the Rapture the only reason Heaven would be silent was because Jesus left heaven to come down and Rapture his bride so the seven seal is the physical coming of Jesus Christ to meet the bride in the air to Rapture the bride off the Earth Hallelujah all right so in closing by God's grace we have been visited by a prophet of God God sent a prophet to finish the mysteries of God hallelujah we saw brother Ram's new commission we saw the third pole in operation we saw brother R speak the word we he can hear it on tape he speaks the word and God backs up the word hallelujah the word of God has been opened and now the revelations of the Bible the Bible has become a new Bible and now we see Jesus Christ all throughout the pages not just in the New Testament we see Jesus Christ all throughout the Old Testament as well Hallelujah he's revealed all these truth to us and so what should our attitude toward this be Hallelujah our attitude should be one of God give me the Christlike character that I desire let this let let let me see Christ the the the full teaching of Jesus Christ in the Bible and let me have character let me praise God through all my trials Lord uh give me character help me to have moral Excellence help me Lord God to obey the word of God when no one's watching Hallelujah that's what I've told Malachi I told different ones young people that's when you know you got real character you obey the word of God even when no one's watching it's just you alone in God hallelujah amen the real character of Jesus Christ because Christ is building character in us because Christ wants us to rule during the Millennium how many want to rule during the Millennium let's stand to our feet musicians can come by God's grace if you want to rule in the Millennium you must overcome your trials going on right now and then brother Ram said do it with joy try to have joy try to give a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah in the midst of your trials try to give give God glory and know that God is going to bring you out praise God oh it's so true by the grace of the Lord okay let me pull that off there now Church did that sermon help anybody today was that helpful by God's grace I thought it'd be good for you see The Prophecy Before the seals were open it was foretold in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah then seven angels met brother brandom to give him the Revelation and the Bible became a new Bible to him it's become a new Bible to us hallelujah praise the Lord now uh if you would play pass me out of gentle Sav before we pray and I'm going to open up the altar if anyone needs Prayer by God's grace then we'll do all that before commun like I said it's going to be a little longer today you know hav and I had the privilege of visiting that church out there and a wonderful Church uh the women have long hair the women wear dresses the women are makeup free as far as I can tell my wife and the girls they can catch when people are wearing just the what's it called the concealer what's it called when they wear like a layer Foundation People sisters in the message think you can wear it people don't know no the sisters see that you can see when you got a little mascara on why would you want to be like Jezebel I don't know why anybody want to be like Jezebel God have mercy why would people want to do that they had the right water baptism they baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they had faith for miracles all these things but church when we walked in there people are talking really loud and I think it ties him perfectly our next lesson in here brother R gives is church order I talked about on it last Sunday here's a people that have so many Revelations but they've stopped right there they don't move forward as he said go going forward into the word of God and we watch it Haven we watch children just walk all around all around the service during the service all over right it was so irreverent and it just it made Haven and I so thankful and now their their music team needed a lot of work I couldn't even worship because the music was it was so offkey it was I had to like make my face where I didn't look like I was sad in other words Church they're not investing in their talents they're okay with coming to church and not giving your best we need to give Jesus our best I don't want Jesus to have a half-hearted effort I want to give Jesus my best and they were praying saying I'm not trying to be critical but they're praying saying oh God's going to restore USA to its original Majesty God is not going to do that God's going to bring the United States under judgment 70 million abortions God's going to have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah if he doesn't judge our nation just no very little respect for God very little reverence for God God give us hearts that reverence Jesus give us respect for the word of God give us Christlike character how many want Christlike character today let's pray father God we thank you for today Lord I Thank
