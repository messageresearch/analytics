========================================

first timothy 1 verse 18. it's a little hot in here so i didn't put the air on and then i got the fan on so mouth guy or bang if you want to open the window you don't have to have the same if it gets hot and you want to hold it in you'll feel free to do that in god's grace first timothy 1 18 will read 18 19 and 20. so we like to look at shipwrecked faith as i said on wednesday this is a thought regarding the judas iscariot group and i was listening to a baptist preacher last week and i heard him say a few things i'm like that is an unbelievable thought such a good thought like looking for all the different metaphors that describe the judas group so there's praise god we are warriors inside of a war going on praise god and yet in the midst of the war doesn't god give us peace ours glad for the peace of god praise god next verse let's read this one together 19 one two three holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck so first he gives it the metaphor of a war and now he gives the metaphor of a ship in the war that has been sunk verse 20 i'll read this one of whom is hymenus and alexander whom i've delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme so here we have an understanding a person who falls away like judas is scared he was in the war or she was in the war but then their ship was sunk and the purpose was because they blasphemed the holy spirit praise god and that's essentially what judas iscariot did he spoke evil against jesus he sold out jesus for money speaking evil against it let's have one more word of prayer if we can't hear by god's grace let's bow our heads father god in heaven we've loved the songs we've enjoyed the worship lord god so much it's such a blessing god turn our eyes on jesus today lord we'll never look away from you lord always look to you in your word thank you lord jesus for your mercy and grace we wouldn't take nothing for our journey now lord god we're so grateful to be christians called to this good ground group out of the four grounds we're so grateful lord to be on the good ground so father we ask god today you anoint this word anoint me as i preach it lord anoint the saints to receive it lord god and we take warning from it but also encouragement that we'll never be in this group lord that we're of a different kind we're a different quality lord god hallelujah speak to your people bless us god in your divine presence and father we'll rejoice in all that you say and do lord and all that your spirit does among us may your spirit have a free course this morning move amongst your people give us that daily revival that we need we pray in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you mean praise god i have a quote i'd like to share i'm going to review this um briefly i'm going to review this thought uh back in 2016 i preached that thought scarcely saved scarcely lost i always remember that sermon because scott walker and his wife came up and said we just want to after service we just want to thank you for preaching that they said we had never heard that before i said well praise the lord you know it's in the church eighth book i want to bring it out but that's back in 2016 over the other sanctuary there but i'm just going to review that rope briefly and this is the big chart but if we start at the top everybody is either going to be saved or lost okay and then brother answer there's three kinds of believers which is true you have believers make believers and unbelievers but then the believer then you have two kinds of believers right you have the wise and foolish virgin and then we have three or we have examples of all four kinds in jesus day you have jesus wise virgin same thief jewish virgin judas was the make-believer that's kind of what we're looking at today and the lost thief never believed to begin with now it's fully taught in scripture i think this would be good for austerlina to see that as well maybe brother daniel they've never seen this before i was going to briefly go this revelation 22 11 says there's four kinds of states you'll be in at the time of the rapture right when you cannot change what you are any anymore you either be holy which is wise virgin righteous jewish virgin filth be like judas or unjust second timothy 2 paul says you're one of these kinds of vessels you're either a gold vessel praise god silver wood or earth these are made to be burned praise god but these are made for service prayer by god you are made for god's service hallelujah god wants to keep you praise god amen he's going to use you for his service there's four kinds of grounds jesus said there's a good ground which is a good and honest heart a quiz maokai on that this week at our house i said what how did jesus describe what two words did jesus describe that good ground good and honest that's a good and honest heart praise god the thorny heart they let the cares the riches grow up and the cares of the world grow up and it choke the the plant so it didn't bring forth fruit so the only one that had fruit was the good ground uh we'll get to this one here judas was the stoney ground it sprang up real fast but it had no root it wasn't rooted and grounded in christ amen and then you have the wayside doesn't even fall on any ground at all and of course we have these four kinds of abraham today abraham harmony lot mrs lot and the sodomites you had four kinds in enoch's day enoch noah remember noah was uh was he was born hundreds of years after the enoch was even raptured uh but the fact was their lifetimes were 900 years so in other words noah was one generation after enoch that's why we would call it still the same day praise god we also know that because uh jude says that jesus christ uh comes back uh or enoch prophesied of jesus christ coming back at armageddon with ten thousand of his saints and the bible says when jesus was crucified his spirit went down the soul and preached to the souls that were imprisoned that rejected him as in the days of noah praise god right which some of those would have been alive during the days of enoch there's a connection between enoch and noah through the scripture then you had borderline believers in the days of noah that you maybe wanted to get in the heart but didn't and then you had the mockers that never wanted to get into the ark in the days of jacob i put a question mark here jacob was truly a believer now rachel she was a a beautiful woman outwardly uh but lacked the character we'd say because she brought gods into her tent and then died of premature death we'd say and then esau was the make-believer he believed for a while but then uh went despite uh jacob and his mother's desires here i'm sorry isaac and rebecca's desires and then the hittites of course they never believed to begin with and then the days of uh elijah you had micaiah and elijah you could put in there jehoshaphat was the borderline he kind of made some deals with ahab right he kind of made some alliances with ahab who was a make believer the judas group he believed for a while you know repented a little bit but then of course sold out the truth sold out elijah for his wife's sake and of course jezebel never believed to begin with okay and just give you a visual uh there's two groups saved and lost all the same you get a white robe praise god they're saved because of jesus righteousness not their own and just to give you a visual of the four kinds here now this is i know i should have made these pictures bigger i just didn't think of it until later but that's a picture of the rapture so there's two kinds of save one group is going in the rapture praise god another group though there's a person bowing at the white throne judgment they've got a bow there and they've got to just humble themselves and their whole their whole life is going to be played before as a book the bible says the books were opened and the book of life so the book of their life is going to be played and uh but they're going to have eternal life they're going to be saved now here you have judas he's leaving the the last supper there again i'm sorry these are so small he's lost he's the son of perdition son of destruction because he sold out jesus that's kind of what we're looking at today we're looking at these filthy ones uh these shipwrecked souls and then you have like pharaoh that's from the movie ten commandments with moses and brother talk about that movie pharaoh he was an unbeliever and god used god knew he would never believe that's why god kept allowing plague after plague his heart got harder and harder so look church no matter how many miracles he saw he was always going to harden his heart that's right so miracles they can help people believe but miracles will not make anybody believe that's right right and the greatest miracle is a repentant heart praise god so just a good thought there said let's end my review like i said i'm going to keep it short i got a lot of scriptures here so i like to look on this thought here uh shipwrecked fate 13 metaphors of the judas iscariot group so i trust this to be a blessing to you and i pray so hard on wednesday i'm going to really try not to pray so hard tonight today by god's grace i just the holy spirit come on me i just got real bold there in god's presence my throat kind of was sore all week by god's grace but anyways let's look at this so we have 13 metaphors now a metaphor is a story but it's not a literal story right it's a symbol a metaphor is like a symbol of something that happens so there's 13 metaphors of judas's group and so i believe church they're placed in there to warn those that are on the borderline like israel to warn them you really must cross over to canaan praise god you must cross over into salvation do not stop shore praise god press on until you inherit every promise of god amen amen do not fall short of any promise of god amen believe to your deathbed and then believe even on your deathbed amen amen amen just believe to the end praise god trust god with all your heart soul and life and strength amen amen now we read our texts here the first one is shipwrecked faith okay and this kind of they're kind of interconnected you'll see a little bit of overlap in some of them by the grace of god let me set the timer here a little nervous like i'll i'll only preach like 30 minutes so i don't know if that's possible but i want to make sure i go a little longer or at least an hour so we'll see so we read our text here now paul gives two metaphors he tells timothy you are fighting a warfare how many know you're in a war today not a picnic praise god now do we want to believe god that god can put us in the cleft of the rock and hide us away at times absolutely but where's that at that's mostly in your soul praise god now you're going to have some of those in your your mind and your body as well where you say god the pressures of life are so overwhelming i'm so stressed out i'm going through such battles or such torment lord hide me give me a place of rest put me in a secret place where i can rest with you praise god we're going to have those times you know no doubt but overall the bible says we are in a warfare and paul was charging timothy to fight a good warfare amen hallelujah he said when you go to war fight with all you've got amen use every weapon at your disposal amen you gotta say like this use some good military strategy i'm gonna leave a good military strategy we just reached out on joshua i just gave you all that good strategy now of course i don't remember it either i'm sure you don't remember every strategy he used but he did ambushes right he did sometimes where he didn't even pull one sword he just walked around jericho and he just sang he just sang and marched his way and he shouted his way to victory praise god amen so church you're gonna have some warfare praise god but you'll overcome as long as you keep god's word and you follow the holy spirit how he's leading you at this time of your life remember prayers are not answered the same way every time it won't always be uh you're anointed with oil and be healed or it won't always be you know i just need a prayer cloth or something like that it may be you you're in the hospital and god uh slowly heals you in the hospital like we saw brother amen you know or maybe something supernatural god will touch you right here on this earth amen but the thing to do is fight a good warfare amen amen be determined i'm fighting for jesus i'm not going to fight against him i'm fighting for him praise god so he tells timothy you are going to fight a a or a mighty war and he says hold your faith don't drop it hold your faith and hold a good conscience now conscious remember is your moral compass it's that's it's that ability in your human mind conscious memory reason affection imagination is that channel in your mind that knows right from wrong and everybody's got one so he says hold faith and keep a good conscience so when we sin and we don't confess it we've got an evil conscience right our conscience are because i like this a guilty conscience but when we hold the faith and we confess our sins every day we are we're doing what paul told us we're holding the faith we have a good conscience i'm walking the right path i'm living the right way god is pleased with my lifestyle amen i'm walking the ways of holiness i'm walking on the highway of holiness praise god i'm walking on the king's highway amen all glory but paul said to tell timothy some have put away the holding the faith they don't want the burden of holding the faith anymore and they they they put away the the the good conscience in other words they get used to living in a state of guilt well i've already done this anyway i might as well keep going in it right well i know i know i know the church doesn't believe this but i'll just do it anyway i'm so far gone and ain't gonna make a difference anyway or some other excuse but paul tells timothy the church age messenger prophet tells the next generation right that he's gonna fight the good fight of faith and he must hold his faith and he must keep a good conscience he must know i'm living morally i'm keeping god's word god's word is the delight amen god's word is honey in my mouth amen i love to meditate on the word of god amen but some he tells timothy some have made shipwreck think about that they're shipped we've all seen boats right you know if you a few weeks ago we were watching somebody on the paddle boat at silver lake creek you know and they just almost fell like so many times i'm like well they're going to go shipwreck if they're not careful they're standing up on the look like a kayak you know i don't forget what it's called you guys know what it's called down on the knee and reestablish your balance get balance in the word of god amen find your balance in the scripture brother that's what brother brother perry green always was told by brother branham keep your balance in the scripture that's right don't be shipwrecked church we're on a journey we are sailing like solomon's hallelujah we are on a journey our ships we have individual ships right and the example he gives of a ship that is shipwrecked is hymenus and alexander who were blast streaming and had not learned not to blaspheme now this is a mysterious text because later we hear about them they were in the book of timothy ii timothy they were saying uh uh i'm sorry i mean this hymenous and felidas so hymenus was one of the ones later saying the rapture has already happened the resurrection's already passed and it caused a canker in the church it caused a diseased church which would be sin right puffed up in the church lead and up in the church because this was well the rapture's already happened so might as well live like this i lived like that i lived like that that's why jesus keeps it a secret he wants every generation to live like jesus come in this generation it's good to live like he's coming to this generation but we've got to do both we got to live like we're going to live in our flesh like we're going to be here our whole lives right we've got to use wisdom like we've been preaching our finances then spiritually we got to be ready to go at any time praise god i think about that often you know sometimes well if i passed away today how would people find my office how would they find my bible would they find my bible open and written on and how how would they find the condition that i lived in and what was my daily life like my daily life was dedicated to christ amen i want them to find that my life was spiritually being made ready for the coming of the lord [Applause] and i had all my natural things taken care of but my main objective was the spiritual things of god man now this is striking here because uh paul was hoping they would learn not to blaspheme because remember paul blasting but that's before he met the pillar of fire yeah so this is strange i don't know if they can be forgiven or not it's just one of those strange scriptures okay but then of course we find out later hymanius may not have learned it because he was saying the rapture's already happened right there's a lot of message churches that say that uh since that cloud has been taking a picture of in 1963 a lot of them are something out a lot but some message churches believe that jesus is already here the rapture has already happened because the clouds come down well they just got revelation 10 confused with first thessalonians 4. amen they got it confused praise god the mighty angel just came down but there was still a ministry for the seventh angel amen and there was a ministry for john to eat the book and prophesy again to every nation people's sons kindred and drive they're still ministering to the gentiles amen meaning time was not no more there was still time there was still hope the gentiles still had a chance of salvation there's still ships out of the sea that can make the destination amen hallelujah and we can still rescue souls amen we can still rescue souls and help them reach god's destination of eternal life amen amen glory amen so i was not going to freestyle okay try not to great now practice faith does not make it to his destination so we get the picture of someone who set sail or sets off but doesn't make it they drop then the bible say that rich men will drown in their sorrows that's why the bible said if you're a rich christian you better be rich in good deeds right like we like we're preaching on that we want to do that if god if it's god's will for our life if it's god's calling for our life but then we must be very careful to constantly give hallelujah now shipwrecked faith blasting the truth by going against your conscience that's what the bible says here imanius and alexander they went against their conscience the conscience was saying don't say that about god don't speak that against god don't speak that against god's servants don't speak that against god's people but yet they did it anyway and paul said because of that they're likely shipwrecked [Music] they're not making i don't think about that sure think about that they stop making progress with god they're drowning in the things in the the battles of the world they're not fighting anymore oh god help us amen they stopped fighting they stopped sailing they weren't making progress god help us to make progress amen in other words each service should be just as important for you to make progress with god amen that's one of the saddest things brother we've seen over years people come in and pretty soon i always see when we get new people always here their faces light up and they love the preaching and then give it six usually three to six months right three i've i've charged you brother william i got charts on my on my computer this person lasted six months before they started criticizing me this one lasted a year this was year and a half you know i just kind of want to get an idea how long will they enjoy the word of god until they start rebuking me or uh just go get attention to other things of the world how long can their ship sail before our trial comes before they'll let it get sunk right because they don't have to let it get son you don't have to be shipwrecked paul was telling timothy you don't have to be shipwrecked hold the face keep a good conscience you'll reach your destination you'll fight it goodbye praise god so see their conscience at one point said don't do this don't say that don't criticize there don't attack that but yet they do anyway they go past their conscience and they do the evil even though they're conscious says do right that's why church is so important to confess all your sins the bible says confess all your sins right and then jesus will forgive all your sins cleanse you from all righteousness praise god how many want to reach our destination today that's only one out of 13. i think i got more on that too because remember jesus said jesus said uh getting to the ground here again this is the second kind of ground the wayside was the first the stone he said on the rock or they which they hear they receive the word rejoice so look there when they're when their vote uh leaves and sets sail they have in parties they're shouting right they're praising the lord when their their ship set sail street's a destination but after a while they get offended and they fall away in the time of temptation that's why i want to have joy when i start i want to have joy in the middle and i would have joy at the end i want the fruit of joy it's the fruit of the spirit in other words if the spirit of god is in your soul it will produce a joy peace patience faithfulness goodness separates all these fruits until the people the people of god can enjoy the fruits of god that come out of my life amen amen in your life too praise god everybody here who is born again remember there's fruits before you're born again too john the baptist said bring forth fruits worthy repentance so people can enjoy all your fruits praise god whether you're born again or not but all of us that are born again will have the fruits of the spirit and we ought to enjoy the fruits in our lives in other words brother amen ought to have a lot of long suffering with me right and my joy ought to lift him up if he's down or my love for brother austin he ought to feel my love when he don't feel loved by or when things are going hard he ought to be able to feel my love for him praise god right we ought to be able to help one another praise god see they believe for a while they could sail for a while see but then everything falls apart they fall away they did not reach the destination of christianity now here's the second metaphor it's a war against god can you imagine that god wants us fighting on him but some people actually take the opposite side and they actually fight against god when they blast you right when they when their god is their own belly we looked at that in the book of philippians but here well here's what uh uh gamalia actually remember brother and said give him perhaps commander will be saved because of this right here he set up for god's people in a time of persecution that's he said perhaps if we say perhaps perhaps perhaps and now i'm saying to you jews refrain from these men these christians and let them alone for if this council or this work be a man it will come to naught but if it be of god you cannot overthrow it amen look at that two thousand years ago they tried but they couldn't overthrow christianity here we are two thousand years later it cannot be overthrown it's a kingdom that cannot be moved it's not an outside kingdom with buildings it's the kingdom of god that's within you amen oh and when god puts that kingdom in the heart that it will spread to others praise god life will throw flow through the body it'll flow from one believer to the next lever to the next flavor it cannot be moved it's an invincible army amen you can't overthrow this holy ghost gospel amen amen impossible praise god you cannot sing all these shits holy spirit and they might think so but they won't sing fired amen they won't see yours amen why because i'm going to get to it a little faster because somebody else is in my ship upon me it's christmas [Applause] it's not about me i'm not the one that's really keeping my ship floating it's christ amen i invited him into my shivering man and if he's in the ship he'll step on the ship and say peace be still you are reaching your destination christ is in the shipping [Applause] hallelujah thank god see don't don't start a war against god and christianity that's right the message of the hour don't start a war and i see that people get careful you better be careful here they get on dangerous grounds now here's where we actually struggle all of us we have a war within ourselves but we can't we got to keep fighting the war within ourselves and we can't just give over to that war and then fight against god you understand you have a war within you you've got to win but you don't want to ever turn and fight against god that's true dearly beloved i must teach you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from i'm sorry fleshly lusts which war against the soul when a person man or woman starts giving in to fleshy lust they will automatically be in war against god and if they're born again the god that's inside of them so in part of their minds they'll be like i'm not saved and another part i am safe i'm bored again right well see that's why we've got to get temperance amen temperance controls the bodily passions amen that's why all these message preachers fall away maybe they had it at one time but then they give in and they lose that anointing because they never got born again they don't have self-control and now they'll drink wine more publicly now they'll drink alcohol and now they'll uh uh they'll divorce and remarry you know get another wife or you know whatever wicked now they're listening to rock and roll they can't even control that fleshly passing passion rock and roll or rat right they put it on they even put it on facebook i could show you them i took pictures of them i don't know on facebook anymore but see it starts to war within them and are they going to fight or win that war well that's up to them so yeah it's a it's a personal i like that it's a personal civil war now church part of us we always have this civil war within ourselves right we think it's so awful the civil war it was awful but the good guys will praise god the right the right way one in our american civil war but paul says you have the civil war going in on you right now i see another law of my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so you're in a ship right that's one metaphor you're on but you even have a war inside the ship you're constantly in a war in the ship between your flesh and jesus in your soul ah amen but paul says o wretched man that i am who will deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with my mind everybody say my mind with my mind i serve the longer but with the flesh and loss and see why you got to get your mind in the things of god every single day every morning if we don't get our minds right away in the things of god it may start a war that whole day why am i struggling with why am i battling this why how did this come back again did you get your mind right in the morning because the mind getting your mind right with god is what will help you keep the war and getting the victory over the war of your flesh that's right here paul says a preacher he calls them and this in this passage he's speaking to preachers how they how they operate in the new testament paul says or i only a barnabas have we not power to forbear workings he don't preachers have the power or the the authority they don't have to go to work they can just preach they can be a full-time preacher yes of course who goes to a warfare at any time at his own charges so it's warfare preaching is warfare and the church said boy sure is i've never done it over the years i tried to have a smile throughout throughout it right all the battles as paul said battles within and battles without it right we all experience this we're in a warfare as paul said you got uh battles amongst the jews battle against uh the robbers no in other words everywhere we go we're fighting battles you remember this second verse 10 beautiful scripture we walk in the flesh but we do not war after the flesh so it's not like a gun or sword or nunchuck that's not the weapons we need praise god for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so god's word and this war will hold on any stronghold any wall can be broken through praise god any fortress can be overthrown can be ransacked amen and we can have spoils of victory because we've got better weapons than satan amen we've got the word of god hallelujah what should we do we must cast down imaginations that's right anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and they're going to church bring into a captivity every what thought the thought life the human spirit your thoughts you must have control i must have control we must have control of all of our thoughts amen and then take revenge on the devil if you fail to sin one day take revenge and say i'm not falling this day i'm going to obey god's word today right got to have revenge got to have that i'm not going to fall this time i'm going to get the victory i'm in a battle praise god i'm not going to let him cut me with a sword i'm going to cut him amen hallelujah paul says again timothy endure hardness as a sole good soldier of jesus christ so we have to expect of course we see it we have to expect in public and even amongst other churches denominations we have to expect that they're going to be hard toward the gospel of jesus christ but paul says endure it just get through how many can just get through it just endure just live with it how do you can just live with it we're learning that we just got to live with the hardness of the world we got to live with the hardness of the churches we can't give into that we can't let that discourage us they're going to be hard but we can be salty we can be soft we can be fleshly as far as fleshy tables of the heart we can be loving we can be gentle as doves heartless as servants we can be the servants of god amen see no man who wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen to be a soldier so one time i had a boy in my class named what writer was his name and his dad come back from ir uh afghanistan i said uh his wife's name was jessica i can't remember his name i said hey how often did you get to see ryder he's like he's like once a month we could do a video chat right you imagine that you've got a wife and kids but he was a soldier in afghanistan he had to work out there i forget if he was a truck driver i can't remember exactly what he was working there of afghanistan but once a month because of security reasons he get to go on the on the on the ipad and say there's my son there's ryan how you doing buddy i miss you once a month imagine you got to see your kids once a month that'd be awful but that's what a solid duration a soldier separates everything right his heart his heart can't be moved by other things other than the purpose of the war he's focused on his mission right and so that's what paul says you can't be entangled with things that are not a part of the war you've got to be focused on the things of god you got to remain free from any worldly thing praise god and you're going to be totally devoted completely focused on winning this war praise god because god chose you to be in this army amen now in the military they signed up but really god chose us before the foundation of the world hallelujah he told that yes we had to surrender but he knew we were going to threaten the whole thing right other than going on the other side of sovereignty right those are the predestinations now god poor knew you so he cannot he could never lose you praise god he knew you choose to praise god see and the only way you'll overcome the only way you get a crown church is if you follow the laws of the warfare let's keep the all the commands keep your commission every all the details of your mission you've got to complete it and then you get a crowd then you come home and everybody's going to clap for you and they're going to have a they're going to have all members going to salute you bray scott and all you imagine the salute in heaven we're going to get all the other ones have come through it but it's our turn we'll say thank you lord hallelujah and they'll salute us like soldiers coming in we come back our ship made it through we won the war he was with us we fought a good fight we finished the course amen just like all the other ones we're no different no better but we all overcame by the grace of god amen why because we didn't get entangled in the things of this world right the main one for us as i said was riches getting entangled in riches right or lust of the flesh less to the eyes pride of life see there's a lot on this how many more i got in this room i got two more okay uh james says where do wars come among you see so first they they war star in you but then if people don't if people don't overcome those wars in their minds or their bodies then they're going to take that war out to other church members that's why i want to be a church full of god's peace full of love let's confess our problems one to another and let's remain in god's love praise god paul says i'm now ready to be offered as a sacrifice martyr the time of my departure is at hand i fought a good fight i finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me of that day and not to me only but all them also that love is appearing oh i'm looking forward to the rapture praise god we love that he's appearing we're uh yeah we have godly fear you know we have godly fear he's going to come back we know that but we also at the same time we love it we always have the fear of the lord but we also have love we we know he's going to make us a part of it because he's already saved us you've already satisfied us he's already filled us with the holy ghost he's going to finish what he started and we love him so we'll see him in love oh my number three metaphor is the falling away this is um the most often one used i think so we'd say one who falls away is a deserter they deserve the army that's what my dad did in the marines and he went to jail for a while my dad left the marines the marine the marine instructor made him get down like a dog and bark in front of the people and they embarrassed him uh they made fun of his name snooki so my dad went awol well they caught him and took him to jail and so he's discharged dishonorably but see that's that's the battles that he was facing at that time you know um but he's a deserver uh also the other word in the greek is apostasy or apostate so you hear that the apostasy report there's different you know youtube channels the apostasy report it's those that are falling away the judas groups or another word is run away okay so paul says let no man deceive you for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first that this the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition okay so this is speaking of course the antichrist is the son of perdition he's the modern day judas iscariot okay so the example was like judas uh there's got to become a falling away first there has to be a great deflection uh there's have to be people that deserve the faith praise god deserve the gospel john says it as well in our church this how they encourage you here by god's grace he says there's many antichrists that's how we know it's the last time they went out from us because they were not of us for if they had been of us they no doubt would have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us but you have an unction that means anointing you have an anointing from the holy one and you know all things amen so this judas is scared group they don't have the same anointing to god even that's why they can't worship like you worship amen that's why they can't rejoice like you rejoice amen they know they they turned down the unction from the holy one praise god and they don't know all things we know all things that are needed for the rapture we know all things that pertain unto life and godliness oh hallelujah so one proof that we're not antichrist is that we stay in the right church that's why i always preach on church attendance that's why i preach on getting up early studying the bible get your mind right because you're going to be fighting a war every single day amen and one proof that you are god's army is that you stay with god's people amen you don't deserve god's people we see it again here first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it so remember the corinthian church was divided with gifts and they were just all over the place with gifts some like apollos peter's ministry jesus some said i'm just jesus some like paul they were divided all over the place he said uh remember there's a group also that they didn't even mourn over the uh the young man sleeping with his stepmother they didn't even mourn about that all these divisions and what would fix it a prophet writing a letter a prophet writing a letter amen two letters amen two and just reading lord just reading the written word and that written word becoming the spoken word it went out like a sword rightly dividing the word of truth amen it was sharper than another sword that's the mighty weapon and it brought the church back into the line amen amen just the word of god just read the word of god amen brought the church right back in line praise god hallelujah amen that's why reading the word of god is so powerful we've all been there right we've been discouraged or uh tempted whatever all it takes is a song also takes a scripture oh hallelujah i'm better now by god's grace forgive me lord all it takes is the spoken word of jesus christ now there must be heresies remember heresies are man-made tenets or man-made commands that's what intent that's what heresy is it's a man-made dogma or doctrine or creed there must be man-made doctrines among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you so that's the reason there's all these arguments about doctrine in all the churches that's normal because the true doctrine will show who's the true church and the false doctrine will show who's the false that's right that's true and then those of the true church they'll hang together with the true doctrine they won't fall away the spirit said in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed and seducing spirits and doctrines of devils they speak lies in hypocrisy having their theirs that conscious again conscience here with the hot iron they took out iron and put it on their conscience what kind of mark would that be right we saw that we saw the man in slavery who had all the sears on his back the branding's on his back and paul says this is happening spiritually someone's putting an iron on your conscience you can't even feel right and wrong anymore it's numb right it's all numbed out service after service no more conscience no more good and wrong they can't even discern good wrong they've departed from the faith they gave ye they let the seducing spirits burn their conscience with an iron flatten out that conscience right flatten it out don't feel it anymore don't feel the effects of sin anymore god help us to always feel bad when we sin now our conscience will be so tender our conscience will be so sensitive not seared over like oh i can keep doing this or it's okay for me to do this is that okay they specifically said you can't marry they said don't eat meats on friday or whatever they was whatever it was and notice their conscience is mentioned again these that fall away just like in remember timothy said uh they put away their good conscience so now i'm connecting first timothy four and first timothy one they branded or seared their conscience and they couldn't discern evil and bad anymore evil good anymore they couldn't descend well no you should er you shouldn't you shouldn't marry you don't have to marry and no you don't eat meat on saturday or don't eat meat on friday you know just seared over thinking that that made them righteous when it didn't make them righteous that's right ii timothy 4 paul says look at this example of demons i remember demons from the bible paul said this is the last letter before he was martyred due diligence to come to me shortly for demeth has forsaken me having loved this present world and departed unto thessalonica went to thessalonica for the things of the world brother william but remember there's messy church in this vessel that's the night that's why he wrote the letters but there was something other than message churches in thessalonica drawing him to the city and so he left paul saying oh i don't i can't live this life anymore i want to go enjoy the world i want to make some money or i want some women or i want some food or you know whatever whatever the temptation was paul so dennis forsook or abandoned or deserted paul's in prison and don't you you don't come to visit anymore you don't come to check on the prophet anymore in prison forsook the prophet so just like judas demas had to hide his love for the world for a while he could hide it but finally that love for the world i manifested church he had all his opportunities to the prop like like i said with judas he had all those opportunities he could have went up to jesus said jesus can you forgive me i've got this i've got a thief heart can you i'm repenting my feet heart can you forgive me he could have done that but he didn't same thing with demons he could have went up and said paul you're the prophet of god you've written the word of god you have not said the lord will you pray for me that i won't love the things of the world and he never did that you see why church is so important sometimes just confess your sin to somebody you don't think that confess it to me but just confess it to god amen that's what this altar is for amen you don't have to tell me but this is what it's for tell god amen that's what judas didn't do he didn't come here he didn't lay here and say god forgive me i'm confessing it to you it doesn't matter if anybody else knows but christ has to know praise god he's going to find out anyway you're going to find out eventually demons had all those opportunities to talk to the prophet he could have said can you give me a vision can you see if the lord gives you a vision for me i can overcome the love of the world same thing jesus could have said jesus did the father show you anything about how to overcome a bee's heart i'm really coveting after money and i don't i'm holding the bag here and i'm having trouble not taking money out of the bag why didn't you go to jesus said lord forgive me or you know i'm going to surrender this i don't have to be the trustee i'm sorry i have to be the treasurer that's right i i i have to be the treasurer can we let peter be the treasurer he had the keys to the kingdom maybe he could handle both i don't have to be the treasurer see that's what he would have done if he was if he was really humble he would have said listen i'm having trouble with this area of my life that's why you have trouble with your smartphone get rid of your smartphone right go back to the flip phone i know numerous brothers that have done that they can't handle a smartphone because the temptation the lust so they just have a flip phone right i got a teenage friend right now i was texting his phone is set up he has a smartphone but it's set up or you can't even receive pictures on it so to get some pictures ahead of him like when we were younger i had to send it to his dad and then get taken to him so church if there's a will to live holy there's a way to live holy amen hallelujah there's a way for demons we turn him down there's a way for judas to turn him down there's a way for us praise god but we're not going to turn it down amen we're going to receive god's wisdom we're going to we're going to sail on lifestyle again and we're going to reach our destination amen hallelujah amen now look earlier church demons was a fellow worker look at this and philemon he was the slave owner of onesimus that paul said or nesmus left philemon and he got saved under paul's ministry and paul saying all the money that you lost put it on my account but while he was working with philemon look who was a faithful worker demas was a faithful fellow labor in the gospel he was a companion in work see church judas and demas they can hide it for so long but pretty soon they're going to love the world judas lasted three and a half years i don't know how long the demons lasted thank god i'm beyond three and a half years thank god for that i'm not saying that's the mark but you know i say right around 2000 so 20 almost 23 years now god's great i'm still pressing on towards the mark of the high cost i'm not satisfied if i walk with god i want more of god amen i need more of god that's the reason why i want more of god because i need more of god because i'm a wretched man there's a war in my memory but thanks be to god that we can rejoice in the law of god in our mind and we can bring this body into subjection to the holy spirit praise god amen i'm going to keep laboring for jesus eventually the world was more loved by demas than the revealed word of the hour can you imagine that those those letters paul was writing they were fresh off the presses kind of like they were fresh off the heavenly presses paul was getting fresh revelation right timothy colossians philippians believe it he's getting fresh revelation and the fresh word of god no longer interested in demons church if you get to the spot where you don't like listen to brother branham anymore something's wrong with you praise god if you get the spout or you don't like sermons anymore something's wrong with you because this is what happened demas didn't like the reveal word of the hour anymore that's the same thing herodias did right that's the same thing herodias had the messenger the prophet messenger john the baptist had his head cut off in other words he silenced the messenger in his life he silenced the forerunner in his life oh may god help us to enjoy the forerunner hear the forerunner let the 400 keep preaching let your pastor keep reaching let the final ministry keep reaching just fall more loving the word all the time the reveal word of god amen glory what did jesus say what is the reason jesus said people are lost they love darkness more than life what was demons demons love the world more than the revealed word of god it all boils down to love boils down to love rather having a hard time talking okay bear with me so jesus foretold we either love him or love the world this fourth or fifth one i can't keep track anymore i should put numbers on another metaphor is you stumble like if i stumbled down this i would trip on this and i'd fall down all right stumble going up the stairs right how many fall down on the stairs before i mean anybody ever fall down the stairs many times i did the other day i thank god i caught myself i almost did a face plant i was trying to get up there and wash dishes or something i stumbled well stumble is a metaphor of what judas did and that's what the word offended mean here's the second kind of ground on the stony ground jesus says he hears the word he has joy but then he has no root he can hang around for a while but then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word of god he's offended or he stumbles he stumbles when he's persecuted he's offended at the word of god remember john the baptist battled this when he was in prison how do you know that yeah john said our is jesus the one or should we look for another because jesus said blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me so john was battling this and he sent messengers to jesus and jesus said go tell don't tell john the blind received their sight the death the death he received their hearing the dead are raised amen the kingdom of god is preached hallelujah and tell them blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me can you imagine how good john felt when the disciples come back and and they said john said what'd you say he's looking up from the prison bars there what did jesus say he said you are the greatest prophet that was ever more can you imagine he'd think of moses he thinking joshua he'd think of adam and you know enoch all these prophets what jesus said is he the messiah yes he is we saw signs wonders and miracles we saw the spirit of god moving and you're the greatest man that's ever been born amen that's right what a way to encourage what a way to keep a man from stumbling amen that's right that's right tell him how much god loves him tell them how many rewards he has in heaven amen that's the way it encourages us to even remember your labor is not in vain in the lord praise god you will reap if you faint not the bible says hallelujah another one is cut off they go a little faster okay these metaphors 13 metaphors another one is jesus will cut off people that's what happened to judas he got cut off from the life of god jesus said i am the vine you're the branches he that abides in me and i in him the same bringing forth much fruit for without me you can do i can do nothing without jesus if a man abides not in me he's cast forth as a branch he needs to throw or let go so a branch the other way you can throw a branch and his wither and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they're burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you what a promise praise god see we must abide in the word of god because without jesus we can do nothing now church we don't want to wither away are you with me yes that's what i'm saying we don't want to see our love for god with our way we want to see our love for god sustained amen stay faithful with god and enjoy the things of god we don't want to see our strength with our way now i'm getting older and i'm starting to see my strength other way a couple years ago i used to be able to jump and hang on the rim well i tried to touch the rim a few weeks ago i can't do it anymore wow my muscles are withered away if i don't use them they're going to wither away right same thing with spiritual are you as strong as you were spiritually a couple years ago or were you withering away the thing to do is if you're if you're getting weaker get stronger go exercise spiritually i think natural exercise is good too but the main thing is spiritual exercise exercise your faith amen hallelujah the church said you got to exercise your faith flex your faith muscles amen list of spiritual ways there's bear the burdens of one another amen amen with your spiritual strength lift the burdens of others off them give them a break with your strong muscle get busy for god you'll see your strength return i promise amen hallelujah another metaphor cast away paul says if a man is striving speaking of athletics here speaking of runners like i was a runner some of you may have been runners if you're striving for the master if you're trying to obtain a goal you must be temperate in all things they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptible crowd i therefore so run how does paul run his christian race there's another metaphor running the race right not as uncertainly so fine i not as one that beats the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i preach to others i myself should be cast away so he's speaking of a runner and a runner that's castaway is rejected he didn't stand the test simon talks about this sometimes uh he was a cross-country runner in college and he'd be tempted he said some of the runners would cut corners you ever seen that at a cross-country event they got like they spray a path of chalk or whatever they or they spray paint and they gotta pass certain paths you have to run well sometimes you can cut a corner sometimes the path will go around the tree and you can actually cut between the tree and the path you can cut through the field and simon said he was tempted numerous times to do that on the cross country course but if you do that the bible the bible says you get rejected you get canceled at the end and paul said if i try to cut corners i'm going to get canceled at the end how do you how do you not cut corners paul you keep your body under subjection the lust of the flesh the church said amen you've got to control the lust of the flesh that's how we overcome that's how we know when we finish the race the angels be shouting happy they won't be sad that we cut corners paul said i bring my body to subjection so i'm not cast away i'm not disqualified for winning the race praise god how many left the bible still has today praise god i love it oh my so beautiful i heard that thought like the sermon was only 18 minutes but i got i got to send this out i got to preach this to myself this is so good the other metaphor is returning back to sodom remember this one jesus said luke 17 that's where he said it talks about the son of man in the last days brother and it's ministry but the next verse he says in that day he which shall be upon the househop and his stuff in his house let him not come down and take it away and he that's in the field that likewise not returned back remember lot's wife see she re she attempted to return back to sam to save her life what would cause a person you could you can hear the fire and brimstone falling you can smell the sulfur you can smell that what would cause you to want to turn around and try to save some of that back it wouldn't be an evil heart right that's returning back i want to try to salvage anything i can from the world now isn't that so sad but see that's what people do they return back to sexual lusts right sodom so well i gotta if i can't have a marriage partner i i gotta have one i'll just leave the church i've heard people say that before i can't live single think about money anything where they turn back and they want to go back to the things of the world just to salvage a little bit of the world oh lord just take all the world away from me praise god just give me enough so i don't have to beg give me enough so i don't forget you just give me that middle of the road praise god and i won't turn back i'll follow you i'll face forward all the time i'll never turn away i'll never look away there it is amen i never turn back and say oh that was actually pretty good when i got to smoke those cigarettes and that was awful awful children you don't need to go out into the world to prove that you're a believer and that brother was right never preached out i forget i can't remember his name but he said a greater testimony is staying out of the world that's true because jesus had a great that was his testimony he never went out in the world to enjoy the things of the world so if you were raised in the message and you overcome and stay in the message god bless you i believe there's great rewards for you praise god because that mimics jesus life now that our disqualifies some of us that's okay i'm going to keep trying to do as much as i can for the kingdom of god as long as i'm there already as long as my can take doc in the heavens the heavens great docking station that's all that matters because i know there's a medicine for me praise god amen hallelujah remember that's why don't turn around don't desire to go back to the smoking the drinking the customs swear and movies no don't desire that praise god amen like jesus set your face toward calvary amen set your face towards the rapture towards heaven hallelujah make no compromise this is lot what uh what uh oh yeah that's what brother said how do i overcome he said she was able to start but wasn't able to finish he said a lot of people were able to start but they don't finish right we got to be willing to say i'm not just starting i'm going to continue and i'm going to finish the race i'm going to finish this race i'm going to finish this war i'm going to finish this journey on my boat right now amen but i'm not acquitted of the spiritual things of god amen i keep pressing on see what she was trying to preserve she was trying to save some of her life i could save that dress or i could i could save that picture of my family i could save that remember church the angels had to pull them out of there they had to grab lots wrists and pull it drag him out of there that's the virgin type but abraham live far far away from that praise god amen we live far far away from those things praise god itching ears i shared this one earlier remember itching ears means to uh scratch or tickle you ever have it itch you just can't help it you probably see me do it all the time gotta itch you know this is the illustration of falling away now the bible said they will heap which means accumulate in piles they will build piles of preachers that tickle their ears isn't that such a strange illustration they will accumulate they will pile up preachers who tickle their ears it's kind of like they got a playlist right they got a pile of playlist well listen to joe olsteen now listen to this person then td jakes now they're nice people but they ain't going to point you to the truth that right they just itch the ears right they don't really say lord they don't really say what the spirit's saying to the churches amen they just hit your ears be your best brother be the best you can be you can be better you can be smart you can be you can be stronger you can be more handsome you can be more beautiful you know all these natural things praise god but that's that's itching the ears that's making your flesh feel good don't pile those things up there clear out the decks amen and hear what the spirit's saying to the churches clear out everything get you somebody that'll tell you the truth get somebody that's saying what the spirit says amen amen these guys are not saying what the spirit says they're itching their ears they're scratching or tickling now what do you what happens when you get tickled do you laugh it's what these guys mainly do they make you laugh see a lot of laughing a lot of scratching and carnal things they look and then finally they turn their ear away and they won't even hear the message anymore they won't even hear the truths of the gospel anymore they won't even hear about holiness location they'd rather have somebody tickle their ears hardening heart i'm almost there by downstairs hold on sorry hebrews 3 is a powerful chapter on israel as a type of christianity if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of hope firm unto the end there it is look conditional problems how do you remember that two remember that these are all conditional promises if you will be christ's house you will be his tabernacle his temple if you hold fast the word of god but you've got to hold it fast he says wherefore today if you'll hear god's voice harden out your hearts as in the days of the provocation heart of means stubborn which is self-will you ever had that you toss somebody this this this you can tell you can tell them for five minutes ten minutes you can tell them for an hour but even when you're done they'll say no i'm doing it my way you can pour out you can make them laugh you can make them cry you can barf your whole heart to them but they still say i'm doing it my way that's stubborn and this happened when on israel's second stage of grace in the wilderness in the sanctification stage see they hardened their heart and i was looking up you know um i was looking at petrified wood like right we're all supposed to have soft hearts right but then what happens uh sometimes wood can be petrified so that's when it's buried in mud really fast right and there's oxygen under there some other elements that remain in there and when you find that piece of wood later it is hard as a rock what happened it got quickly overthrown right a quick a quick temptation of safety right and the heart becomes hard reminds me of that woman brother talked about she used to be dancing with the dance kings in queens and she was saved and then she was walking by one day and she stopped for just a minute to go in there and listen to music and before she knew it she was dancing winning the trophies again and she come crying back to brother ram's house i'm lost i lost billy and brother i prayed for her and the the devil went out of her looked like a bat never went out of bowdan's house see she just stopped for a minute see she got piled over amen her heart got hard for a moment see she got overtaken her face got piled upon she got overtaken by a temptation quickly and her heart became so hard so she went out and danced of course she wasn't born again right when their brother afraid of her she got delivered see hardness of heart at one time she was so soft to the gospel she wouldn't even stop to listen to it so she's teachers we can't even stop to listen to those old things we used to listen can't even stop to listen to it because that's one step in getting close towards a hard heart let me see what i'm at one two three four i got one more though yeah i'll go kind of fast yeah i wish i could i feel bad i appreciate that all right i guess i always make it apart too that i'm like oh he's got to get to the other parts of the other part so the other sermons are working on when am i going to get to that it's the joy of the past record come back to me uh we don't want to be sober we're going to be humble we want to take god's will not our will in the same chapter paul says take heed bride of christ fellowship take heed brother jesse lest there be any evil heart of unbelief in you where you would depart from the living god but see instead exhort one another build it but build each other up today while it's called today lest there be any hardened through the deceitfulness of sin so here's the way you help people overcome when they're getting deceived you come up and you build them up in the faith so if you hear somebody they're struggling say oh i'm sorry about that but here let's pray together or let's talk about this or i can help you out with this uh god's gonna bless you god's gonna bring you through we gotta build them up we're all gonna be tempted we're all gonna have to go through deceitful temptations and things like that so we all must build one another up we must bear one another's burdens praise god for we are partakers of christ if there's a if again there's the f if it's conditional if we hold the beginning of our confidence set back to the end deceit means to be misled see the world will lead you astray but jesus is the great shepherd he'll lead you in passive righteousness praise god amen he'll lead you in holiness amen another metaphor is crucifying jesus afresh i have 13 metaphors the bible said those who partake this is judas they partake of gifts if they fall away they crucify the son of god afresh and put into an open shame in other words they kill the in the voice of god in their lives they kill that voice and they'll live anyway openly they'll live any way in public they'll put jesus to open shame that's what that word means public shame they'll speak against jesus they'll speak against the message they'll live all kinds of sinful things that's crucifying jesus christ the fresh that's what judas did he sold him out he said here here you roman soldiers here's jesus i'll give you the money i'm not going to be with jesus i want to see him arrested and think about that i want to see jesus christ arrested that's how far he got let his mentor his teacher his pastor his prophet let his prophet get arrested and sold them out that's crucifying christ the fresh and what does paul say paul says the people that crucified jesus they are thorns they're not the good plants they're the thorns right and the rain falls on the just and the unjust but i love this brother we're persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak praise god i'm persuaded better things for brother amen and sister for austin alina i've persuaded better things for all of you because you're hanging on to the things of god you're holding your profession steadfast unto the end praise god there's better things in store for us hallelujah thank god amen i better move on here the other one is trampling underfoot the son of god afresh that's in hebrews chapter 10 how much more sore punishment shall he be thought worthy who have tried to underfoot the son of god encountered the bloody of the blood of the covenant wherein he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite on the same unto the spirit of grace so just like judas again just like israel israel almost reigns in the promised land it's in that second stage where people can sell out jesus that's where they can trample underfoot that's where they can crucify him afresh in that second stage they reached the second stage they did the opposite so see how they're stubborn the holy spirit said do this they said no i'm stubborn i'm doing what i want to do instead i'm learning some good lessons today cast out away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward be confident in god's promises for you have need of what patience how many patients church see we get a portion of it but we always need more of it it's true after you've done the will of god everybody say after ready you've got to do god's will first and then after sometime soon you'll inherit the promise amen amen amen you got to follow god's steps obey be patient receive the promise praise god forget a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tear he's coming church he's coming oh yeah jesus is coming back someday amen let's live like it praise god amen he's coming back there's gonna come time he won't tear anymore he's coming back to rescue his people hallelujah bye but i never have enough time to preach second beater now i'm just gonna go this you brought from here with this peter calls balaam a well without water a cloud with no rain and then he says balaam was a man who used great swelling words of vanity to use the lustly flesh through when tightness those that were clean escaped from them who live in air in other words balaam brought people that were living holy he deceived them and brought them into fornication the bible said they were clean they were escaped those israelites that went down to baal pior they didn't escape from the things of the world but through balaam's false teaching he tempted them back into fornication to sexual sin that's what the bible says he promised them liberty oh you'll feel freer than ever if you just commit these sins but he actually was a servant of corruption he served money now look at what he says they were brought they were overcome by balaam and they were brought back into bondage so they they were sinners they got saved as israelites but then balaam convinced them to commit fornication and brought them back into slavery to sin for after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ they're again entangled so you think about that they were entangled in their sins they confessed under moses but then they went to hear balaam preach and balaam tangled them back into their sins of tangled entanglements and now i'm a slave to a sinner i'm not free anymore the law of moses brought them out but they willingly went back into being entangled and addicted oh god help us be free amen amen hallelujah amen if that happens they're free and then they go back to entangled the bible says the latter end is worse than the beginning it would have been better for them not to know the way of righteousness than after they've known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them but what's happened a true proverb the dog is returned to his own vomit again the sow that's the female adult pig the sow that was washed to her wallowing returned to the muck and mire and this reminds us of lot's life right she had left the things of the world but she's like i could just get a few more and turn back to uh turn back to the salt turn the salt right the dog left the vomit but it goes back to the bottom the pig leaves the mud and then goes back to the mud that's judas good warnings for church last one last one everyone take a deep breath refresh yourself the last one is satan uproots people's lives in other words they're no longer what the bible is paul said be rooted in what rooted and grounded in christ make sure your whole life is rooted in the word of god in other words i ain't going anywhere because i'm rooted in christ i'm not leaving this word because my whole life is connected it's holding on to this word i cannot be moved i shall not be i shall not be moved amen i'm like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen hallelujah you're going to see that song or what buddy he's laughing is that song you want to sing see our roots got to be in the lone god in other words i love jesus christ more than this world amen i'm rooting that i'm hanging on to his love oh hold on i don't know but really his love is hanging on to me jude says these evil ones speak evil of things that they don't know they corrupt themselves see it's because they love sin they corrupt themselves they've gone the way look at this the threefold or the threefold judas group cain balaam and korah are just like judas cain refused the perfect will of god he refused the blood of the lamb balaam desired the permissible of god for money torah rebelled for personal position judas did all these things he denied the blood of jesus on the cross sold out for money right wanted a different worldly position he didn't want the position of an apostle but rather he turned on the highest position in the entire christianity was the apostle i'm trying to close and what you'd say jude said they are spots in your feast of charity see we're having a feast here today i don't know if you notice it but we're the beautiful feast of god's word amen amen every now and then a judas is scared comes among us right and the bible said the cain of balaam accora they feast with us look they feast with you sometimes they sit right among us and they feed themselves without fear so they feed this feast and they're not even they're under the fear of the lord but i'm already saved i'm i'm i can live however i want they don't have the fear of god like they need to you hear the preaching but it doesn't cause any godly reverence in them it doesn't make them clean out their lives they think they can live in sin what are they they're clouds without water they're carried about with winds trees use fruit wither there's no wither again wither getting weaker dying without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots the raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars who has reserved the blackness of darkness forever they always corrupt themselves they let themselves get plucked up out of the ground and taken away from being rooted and grounded in christ see church christ is our ground amen christ is where we need to be planted let's stand to our feet so here's the 13 the musicians can come shipwrecked war against god falling away deserter of stumbling cast away cut off return to sodom itching ears heart and heart
