[16:19] day that's a great day to say thank you
[16:21] Lord for being my father praise God also
[16:24] we'd like to get July testimonies I
[16:26] think I'll do a sign-up sheet okay so I
[16:29] like everybody to give their testimony
[16:31] in July and we'll probably like one in
[16:34] the a.m. I'll preach like a short sermon
[16:36] because I can do it I can preach your
[16:38] short sermon I proved it to you last
[16:40] Wednesday kind of my wife said kinda
[16:43] yeah but I do want to make I want to do
[16:46] I want to do it in July I want to do
[16:48] like I'll preach a short sermon on
[16:50] Sunday morning and then we'll have like
[16:52] somebody give their testimony for 30
[16:54] minutes or something like that because I
[16:55] want the young I want the kids to hear
[16:57] about the reality of Jesus Christ I want
[17:00] the next generation to know about the
[17:02] power of Christ so I'll probably do a
[17:04] sign-up sheet Lord when
[17:05] I might write that down so I get that
[17:08] because I want everybody everybody to
[17:10] testify and I also want to get my cousin
[17:14] add him out here to testify about what
[17:15] God has done for him because we seen him
[17:17] a few weeks ago and he's doing great by
[17:19] God's grace so I want him to testify
[17:22] also one more I just want to apologize
[17:24] again to Johnny and Sarah publicly last
[17:27] Sunday I said that they had already
[17:29] decided to come here why kind of jumped
[17:30] the gun I apologized to Johnny on the
[17:32] phone I want to apologize to you Sarah
[17:34] and I apologize to brother Jim because
[17:37] he was actually listening when I
[17:39] announced it and that was my fault I
[17:41] should not have done that I just was you
[17:42] know I was in my mind I was placing
[17:44] things together and I thought you know
[17:45] that but we are happy while while
[17:47] they're praying and deciding we're so
[17:49] happy and we're so blessed by the
[17:51] sacrifice you make think about that ones
[17:54] last time everybody here drove two hours
[17:55] for a Sunday morning service and then
[17:58] two hours home so let's support them and
[18:02] pray for them as they're deciding and
[18:05] praying about that it's a it's a
[18:07] fantastic sacrifice you know we think of
[18:09] Wendy she's done it for what 10 years or
[18:11] I get my numbers wrong eight or nine
[18:14] years she's driven three and a half
[18:16] hours one way to come to our church so
[18:19] it's a great sacrifice and so we
[18:21] appreciate the plans and the Lord will
[18:23] guide them we know the Lord will guide
[18:24] them all who have the Holy Ghost
[18:26] he said I'll guide you into all truth so
[18:29] we always want to support God's people
[18:30] and I just want to offer that public
[18:33] apology by God's grace I make mistakes
[18:35] to who who's I telling us tell Malachi
[18:37] and Lydia or no cell in Haven this
[18:39] morning daddy makes mistakes all the
[18:40] time
[18:41] I don't want to though I hate making
[18:43] them but brother Graham said I make
[18:45] thousands of mistakes every year and if
[18:49] you divide that up that's five or six
[18:50] mistakes every day that's it's just if
[18:54] you do 2,000 because thousands more than
[18:57] 1,000 so I don't ever want to do
[18:59] anything wrong
[19:00] I'm ashamed and Haven I'm ashamed when I
[19:02] do make mistakes I'm ashamed of myself I
[19:04] don't I don't I don't like doing that so
[19:08] amen thank the Lord for that so we
[19:11] appreciate the Bland's and we appreciate
[19:12] all the saints in Albion hallelujah
[19:15] always have always will praise God
[19:17] so here's a
[19:19] prayer requests here let's do a men's
[19:23] dad I'm sorry Amon has an unspoken
[19:25] request for his dad
[19:26] very good godly request so let's
[19:29] remember his dad in prayer praise God
[19:31] while we're at it let's remember my dad

[19:46] strength to make it here this morning
[19:47] brother with all that pain you have
[19:49] praise the Lord and yet a little
[19:51] testimony there christopher was reading
[19:54] and writing this week right so the so I
[20:02] think there was some connection to
[20:03] Christopher's seizures with his ability
[20:06] to read and write then God took all the
[20:08] seizures away now he's Jose said he's
[20:10] reading and writing so thank the Lord he
[20:13] cares about every one of our requests
[20:15] and our God is so great and merciful
[20:18] praise God also let's pray for everybody
[20:20] around the country especially those in
[20:22] Atlanta there was a shooting again
[20:24] yesterday and it's just awful you know
[20:27] the only thing that's gonna change is
[20:29] when hearts are healed by the love of
[20:31] Jesus Christ I was showing this the
[20:34] musicians in there that Magazine of
[20:36] brother branham from Life magazine from
[20:38] 63 that magazine is filled with articles
[20:42] about race relations and dog I can show
[20:46] you afterwards dogs were biting the
[20:48] clothes of the black people and there's
[20:50] a picture of a white officer dragging a
[20:52] black woman upside down she's got a
[20:54] skirt on dragging her upside down into
[20:56] the the wagon the the police wagon I
[20:59] mean this nothing's gonna change until

[21:05] for mercy we can pray for Souls saved we
[21:08] can pray for justice amen
[21:11] a justice will be done to any cop or
[21:14] anybody any civilian who breaks the law

[21:21] awful and then they put it all over
[21:23] media and everything it's just so awful

[21:28] to extend to people
[21:30] anybody with any ounce of racism in a
[21:33] even saved they don't they understand
[21:36] that God creates all skin colors and
[21:38] they're all beautiful in his sight and
[21:39] God loves that he died for all of them
[21:42] all the iniquity of all man was placed
[21:45] upon him once and for all

[42:44] right now you know this last night this
[42:47] morning I was caught I was trying to
[42:48] study on the Philippian series but then
[42:50] I felt like the Holy Spirit just guided
[42:52] me back to this thought on the Holy
[42:55] Ghost we had a wonderful service two
[42:57] Saturdays ago I think that was the
[42:59] highlight service of the meetings just
[43:01] such a tremendous atmosphere of
[43:03] surrender and worship and prayer and so
[43:07] I wanted to continue looking at the
[43:08] thought on the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:12] so I want to continue there by God's
[43:15] grace in a little bit I'll switch over
[43:19] Keysha but not right now
[43:21] I want to switch over a look at a few
[43:22] quotations and some scriptures I believe
[43:26] there'll be a help to us so let me take
[43:29] off my jacket here real quick we'll
[43:30] start in acts 2 verse 33 is where I get
[43:34] this principle from and the reason I
[43:36] call the principle is because there's so
[43:38] many quotes where brother Branham says
[43:39] the new birth is just like a natural
[43:42] birth yeah he said just like a baby
[43:45] being born the natural he said they come
[43:48] out screaming and crying
[43:50] Vauban so they come out speaking in
[43:52] tongues right they don't know any
[43:54] language now that's just a joke but they
[43:59] come out trying to talk right they come
[44:01] out screaming and with needs crying out
[44:04] so we know the same thing happens in the
[44:07] spiritual because here Peter says
[44:11] something you both see and hear now
[44:15] there's a little bit of
[44:16] confusion with one quote in particular
[44:19] and I think I'll pull it up here it's
[44:21] okay so you can switch over
[44:22] it's without sensation Holy Ghost
[44:25] without sensation I think a lot of
[44:27] people misunderstand that so let me pull
[44:32] it up here
[44:33] I just I'm kind of going off I got a
[44:36] special sensation right then I'll get it
[44:38] so a lot of people take this quote and
[44:41] they say see brother Jess you don't need
[44:43] a an experience programs now this is
[44:47] where he's listing the 12 mysteries I'm
[44:49] writing that book on by God's grace and
[44:51] I just got another chapter done this
[44:52] week so I'm 85% done so I'm excited I
[44:55] hope to get out by the end of the year
[44:56] Lord willing cuz I I believe it's got
[44:58] its brother Rams message all in one book
[45:01] that's what I believe it is it's gonna
[45:02] put it all in one place because this is
[45:04] where he talks about it yeah he said the
[45:11] mystery of the Baptism Holy Ghost
[45:12] without sensation but see people stop
[45:15] right there they failed to keep reading
[45:17] but the person of Christ performing in
[45:20] you the same works that he did remember
[45:25] when Jesus was baptized how do you get
[45:27] the Holy Ghost the Bible said heaven
[45:29] spoke amen they could see it in a year
[45:33] something happened praise God to the
[45:34] body of Jesus the Dove came down to
[45:37] dwell in the tabernacle of Christ amen
[45:40] you could see it you could hear it
[45:42] praise God John saw it now we know not
[45:45] everybody saw but it was seen and heard
[45:47] by some people okay and now you also
[45:51] here's a good one I heard brother Donnie
[45:54] Reagan preach years ago the same people
[45:57] that you know they say oh you don't need
[45:59] a sensation they failed to read on after
[46:02] the seals brother Graham said that's
[46:03] exactly what the church has done it has
[46:05] come from Luther Wesley now back to the
[46:06] original grain back to its original
[46:07] glory back to the glory it was at the
[46:11] beginning he said the Sun that rose in
[46:13] the east it's the same Sun that's
[46:15] manifesting the same thing in the West
[46:17] changed you from glory to glory
[46:18] I'm skipping down he said now it's right
[46:20] to bring back exactly like he was at the
[46:22] beginning
[46:23] same ministry same Jesus same power same
[46:27] Holy Ghost the same one that found the
[46:29] day of Pentecost
[46:30] is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested
[46:32] today from glory into glory to glory and
[46:34] it's back to its original seed with the
[46:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost the same signs
[46:39] same lunders same baptism same kind of
[46:42] people acting the same kinda way with
[46:44] the same power with the same sensation
[46:49] see that's what false doctrine people
[46:52] always do that they take one whoa and
[46:54] they say look I got a quote but there's
[46:56] so many more quotes amen and then you
[46:59] that's not it I mean first you gotta
[47:01] have a quote but then either the quotes
[47:02] got to be taken back to the word amen I
[47:04] hope our live streamers probably missed
[47:06] on that because I wasn't speaking on the
[47:07] mic so forgive me live streamers there
[47:10] it is I just keep forgetting but so see
[47:15] you can see this is after this is well
[47:18] after this the sermon of where he said
[47:23] without sensation that was from New
[47:25] Year's Eve 1962 so this is what this is
[47:29] - almost a year and a half later yeah
[47:31] almost here have later June 29th 64 now
[47:36] while I'm here I want to just lay
[47:37] something out the Lord really blessed me
[47:39] a few weeks ago I felt like he gave me a
[47:41] little bit of better understanding on
[47:43] the seven thunders so can I just can I
[47:46] just share a few quotes on the seven
[47:47] thunders real quick I was amazed I was
[47:50] listening to brother Jason to Mars you
[47:52] everybody probably members Jason to Mars
[47:54] he preached here a couple years ago and
[47:57] so I was just listening to one of his
[47:59] messages on Facebook it was a really
[48:01] great message on the seven thunders and
[48:02] I came across this really beautiful
[48:05] quote that he was sharing so I want to
[48:08] read it I want to get it up here and
[48:09] read it to you now uh while I get it go
[48:13] to acts 10 and let's look at the seventh
[48:16] under scripture now and church I'm not
[48:18] trying to be uh a know-it-all I'm not a
[48:21] know-it-all but I think the best I'm
[48:23] trying to just express that the way we
[48:25] believe the seven thunders I believe is
[48:27] the right way and I'm not trying to be
[48:29] critical but I'm just trying to say it's
[48:32] the only way that fits scripture okay a
[48:35] lot of people they're still waiting for
[48:36] the seven thunders Oh God's gonna say
[48:38] some seven thunders you know before the
[48:41] rapture and now I know there's quotes on
[48:43] that but
[48:43] and brother branham gives us other
[48:44] quotes on it and then you got to line up
[48:47] with the word so while you're turning
[48:50] there let me pull up the quote that I'm
[48:52] gonna read to you where brother man
[48:53] plainly says it like I said I am enough
[48:58] time these were just kind of quicken to
[49:00] me this morning I think you know as a
[49:01] preacher are you probably aware of it
[49:04] you know sometimes you got the messages
[49:05] way in advance other times it's like
[49:07] waiting on the Lord like Lord am I ever
[49:09] gonna can you please give me some help
[49:11] here yeah and I always I always have
[49:14] many sermons just waiting in the banks I
[49:15] just waiting in my pocket you know I got
[49:17] I always got I got plenty of sermons
[49:20] waiting I could preach that I've already
[49:22] studied and preached but I just want to
[49:24] find what the Lord wants me to do right
[49:26] now now what's interesting is church
[49:29] here's what I want to share this this
[49:30] morning this quote about the thunders
[49:33] was on June 14th 63 today's June 14 2012
[49:43] and when to share this quote for weeks
[49:45] and I'm like this morning I'm like when
[49:46] was this quote and it was this day 56
[49:50] years ago so I thought you know that's a
[49:53] pretty good witness that I need to say
[49:54] that I'm not a prophet but it's a pretty
[49:57] good witness like wow that sir that
[49:59] quote was 56 years ago today I thought
[50:01] and it was in the morning sermon too
[50:02] because he preached two sermons that day
[50:04] so I thought I better share this morning
[50:07] because I think is just it's a nice I
[50:10] don't believe in coincidences it's a
[50:12] nice vindication that I was under the
[50:14] thought God wanted me to share okay I
[50:17] just try to look for those things you
[50:18] know as a Christian in the mouth of two
[50:21] or three witnesses that every word be
[50:22] established so I try to just balance my
[50:24] life out like that especially when I'm
[50:26] dealing with preaching now revelation 10
[50:28] you know the mighty angel comes down we
[50:30] know it's Christ it can only be Christ
[50:32] it matches his description from
[50:34] revelation 1 it has to be Christ the
[50:36] feet of pillars of fire and the rainbow
[50:40] and everything faces the Sun that it has
[50:42] to be Christ and he has a book open it
[50:46] was the book of the seven seals from
[50:48] chapters four and five the book that
[50:51] Christ opened in Chapter six is now
[50:53] being brought to earth right and then
[50:57] verse three and cry with the loud voice
[50:59] as when a lion roar and when he had
[51:01] cried seven thunders uttered their
[51:03] voices so when this book is brought to
[51:06] earth seven thunders sound right now
[51:10] John is told he's gonna ride him down
[51:13] but he said don't ride him he said seal
[51:16] him up and don't ride him he said seal
[51:20] him up so that's all we know is all we
[51:22] know is that when that book came down
[51:23] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[51:26] God did not want what was uttered
[51:28] written amen and but then remember verse
[51:33] seven the angel gets the open book and
[51:36] he and then the Bible said the mystery
[51:39] of God is finished amen
[51:41] that means whatever those Thunder said
[51:43] gotta be finished amen right
[51:46] because the mystery of God everything
[51:49] that's mysterious about God that we need
[51:51] for the rapture is already finished
[51:54] because it's already been brought down
[51:55] to earth the but is open the seven
[51:57] thunders of God and the Bible said the
[52:00] mystery of God is finished and then you
[52:03] and I take it to the rest of the world
[52:04] praise God John eats it and verse 11
[52:07] then he said unto me thou must prophesy
[52:10] again before many peoples and nations
[52:12] and tongues and kings
[52:16] so whatever those thunders said it's got
[52:19] to be part of the finished mystery and
[52:21] then it's got to be taken around the
[52:23] world how can we prophesy again if we
[52:26] don't know what it is the reality is we
[52:28] know what it is it's the revelations of
[52:30] the seven seals it's the only one that
[52:33] makes sense and now look at this quote
[52:36] program he add Recker I'm sorry he
[52:38] directly addresses how the seven
[52:40] thunders cannot be something outside the
[52:43] Bible they gotta be in the Bible you'd
[52:46] be surprised how many preachers believe
[52:48] the thunders are gonna be something
[52:49] outside of the Bible they can't be
[52:52] because Jesus said you can't add to it
[52:54] or take away from it
[52:56] and brotherman plainly says it everyone
[53:00] has come to me and said brother Brennan
[53:01] I look at this brother and says they're
[53:03] trying to trick him so it's Satan Satan
[53:05] got in these brothers a brother and he
[53:07] them seven thunders at the voice uh Terr
[53:09] he said write him not see
[53:10] close it up and that'll be the seven
[53:12] thunders that'll be revealing the last
[53:13] AC the seven thunders that'll tell us
[53:16] now don't that sound real good see but
[53:22] watch what you're talking about when you
[53:25] say that I'll tell you I just rejoice
[53:27] for the Jose I just rejoice when I heard
[53:29] brother Jason read this I'm like where
[53:31] was I
[53:31] I've listened this sermon before how did
[53:33] I miss this quote but see God lets me
[53:36] forget and then he brings it back at a
[53:38] time when I need it and you'd be
[53:40] surprised
[53:41] every seems like every month I get
[53:42] somebody emailing me what huh what is
[53:44] about the seven thunders what about the
[53:45] trumpets what about the seals and so I
[53:47] got these quotes I just give him write
[53:49] to him so they don't get mixed up in
[53:51] some fanaticism now I said he said write
[53:56] it not oh yeah
[53:57] he said seething riding out see the
[53:58] seven thunders other voices he he said
[54:00] don't write that but it's to be sealed
[54:02] up in the book until the last days now
[54:04] someone has been Manning now look many
[54:06] has been saying to me can you imagine
[54:08] people asking you all the time brother
[54:10] Brandon with the Lord if it with your
[54:13] experience that the Lord has given you
[54:14] for his people humbly saying this and I
[54:17] look at humbly you you spoke to the
[54:20] smoke and squirrels into existence
[54:22] you've done all these things and humbly
[54:24] do you think you can tell us do you
[54:26] think the seven thunders have come later
[54:28] look what he says with your experience
[54:32] the Lord has given you humbly you would
[54:33] be eligible to ride a Bible yourself
[54:35] couldn't you a prophet write your own
[54:37] Bible see your word if God is manifested
[54:40] I said that might be true see he was
[54:45] trying to catch me so of all these many
[54:48] people one of them was anointed of the
[54:51] devil trying to catch him see be careful
[54:54] people that like you not everybody likes
[54:57] you is really for you brother bang
[54:59] they're trying to catch you they're
[55:02] trying to get you to say something that
[55:04] will go outside the word brother
[55:07] BAM had enough to sermon to know it oh
[55:09] this this humble supportive person was
[55:15] really led of the devil he was trying to
[55:17] catch me look at that in that awesome
[55:19] little man lets us know this oh I love
[55:22] it
[55:22] he said but you see
[55:24] couldn't do that he said well why
[55:27] couldn't you you have all the
[55:29] qualifications I said but you look one
[55:32] word cannot be added or taken away so
[55:38] church let me just say like this as we
[55:39] get closer to the rapture get your eyes
[55:41] in this word it's okay to pray for and
[55:45] seek revelations I do it to many men but
[55:47] I know any revelation that's worth
[55:49] anything it's gonna come out of this
[55:51] word amen now here's where it deals with
[55:54] the seven thunders and he said well well
[55:56] them seven thunders you see wouldn't
[55:58] them seven thunders blasting now won't
[56:01] that be a revelation to be give to some
[56:03] man I said no sir it would be adding
[56:08] something to it or taking something from
[56:12] it so his whole reason behind it was to
[56:15] try to pressure brother Branham give us
[56:17] seven thunders give us some revelation
[56:20] that's outside the Bible and brother
[56:23] Branham was a god-sent prophet amen he
[56:25] said don't pressure me to do that it
[56:27] ain't gonna be you can't add to the
[56:29] Bible you can't take away from the Bible
[56:32] it's all revealed in there now he's
[56:36] talking about the thunders it's all
[56:37] revealing there and the seven seals
[56:39] opened up what the revelation of that
[56:43] was Amen see you and brother and
[56:45] preached the first seal the seven
[56:47] thought the first Thunder under his
[56:49] voice amen
[56:50] as he preached and said that's thus
[56:52] saith the Lord that was the thunder we
[56:54] heard on Wednesday night when that
[56:56] beautiful that was so awesome
[56:58] I finished my sermon and we hear the
[57:00] thunder of God amen
[57:02] oh I thought thank you Lord Jesus amen
[57:04] what a good timing praise God he said no
[57:07] he's a no sir
[57:08] he said the seven seals open the
[57:11] revelation of what that was that's what
[57:14] it was see it's still in the word Amen
[57:18] see it won't leave the word he said you
[57:22] can't get out of that word it won't
[57:23] leave the word and God's Spirit will
[57:25] never leave that word it'll stay right
[57:29] with the word blinding some and open the
[57:34] eyes of others it'll always do that
[57:37] and the church said well bang I could
[57:42] share
[57:42] there are many quotes for mother madam
[57:44] said those seven thunders gonna be real
[57:45] right about the end time listen we're
[57:47] listening to right now to the Seventh
[57:48] Seal that's where he says it the most
[57:50] but later months later the Holy Spirit
[57:53] is the obviously dealing with him for
[57:55] these people trying to get him to say
[57:57] the seven thunders and finally the Holy
[57:59] Spirit strikes him and said that's wrong
[58:00] it can't be anything outside the word it
[58:03] has to be in the Bible does everybody
[58:06] understand
[58:07] now there's two quotes you know after
[58:09] there's one in questions and answers
[58:11] I'll pull it up real quick cuz I succès
[58:13] didn't have time to get all these going
[58:14] here oh there it is okay
[58:20] he said have the seven thunders they
[58:25] asked brother Brad specifically have the
[58:27] seven thunders been revealed yeah have
[58:32] the seven thunders which equals seven
[58:34] mysteries already been revealed were
[58:35] they revealed the seven seals better are
[58:38] yet but are not known to us as the
[58:40] thunders yet he said no they were
[58:43] revealed in the seven seals this is two
[58:48] months after the quote I just read you
[58:50] that was June member June July August
[58:52] two months later the people asked him
[58:54] straightly arthas are the thunders
[58:57] revealed or not he said yes they were
[58:59] revealed in the seven seals that's what
[59:02] the thunders was about so you have seven
[59:06] thunders you have seven seals that's
[59:08] what each thunder was about one of the
[59:10] seals the seven thunders that had
[59:16] uttered their voices no one could make
[59:17] out what it was John knew what it was
[59:19] but he's forbidden to ride it he said
[59:21] with the seventh angel son look what he
[59:22] ties it again see he ties it in again
[59:24] revelation ten seven but in the days of
[59:26] the sounding the seven mysteries of the
[59:29] seven thunders would be revealed and the
[59:31] seventh angel is the messenger of the
[59:33] seventh church age okay and then now you
[59:37] know the you probably know if you've
[59:40] been around here a little bit is the
[59:41] seven thunders quote he will reveal
[59:43] brother Branham says that's what the
[59:46] seventh messenger will do here the
[59:49] mysteries
[59:51] I better get my words right here so I'm
[59:56] sorry for taking the time but I just
[59:57] want to nail this down I thought you
[59:59] know since the date of that quote was
[1:00:00] today I wonder if I would want to preach
[1:00:02] it for a while I thought I just better
[1:00:04] do that now the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:00:06] and revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:00:09] things one according to Malachi he will
[1:00:11] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:00:14] father's see our hearts should we turn
[1:00:16] to the book of Acts praise God we should
[1:00:19] say God give us a church like they had
[1:00:21] in the book of Acts amen we've seen we
[1:00:24] have the same baptism we we've seen many
[1:00:26] of those same signs but we are promised
[1:00:28] the fullness of that church right before
[1:00:31] the rapture amen that's why we know
[1:00:34] there's more of it to come because God
[1:00:35] said I will restore what should our
[1:00:38] prayers before now restore the power
[1:00:40] amen we've seen power but restore more
[1:00:43] of it praise God amen we've seen people
[1:00:46] save but restore all the people that can
[1:00:49] be saved
[1:00:50] see we got we have the restored word we
[1:00:52] have the restored doctrine but we want
[1:00:54] to see all that they had in the book of
[1:00:56] Acts we want to see that restored to the
[1:00:58] Bride of Christ
[1:01:00] that's thus saith the Lord I'll show you
[1:01:02] that one next
[1:01:03] according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts
[1:01:05] to he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:01:08] seven thunders in Revelation 10 which
[1:01:10] are the revelations contained in the
[1:01:13] seven seals it will be these divinely
[1:01:18] revealed mystery truce that literally
[1:01:20] turned the hearts of the children to the
[1:01:22] Pentecostal father's exactly so and the
[1:01:24] church said now it's on tape George
[1:01:28] Smith who was brother and son-in-law
[1:01:29] said that brother Branham probably read
[1:01:32] this book over five times before it was
[1:01:34] published because his wife Rebecca SH
[1:01:36] now she passed away she would read it to
[1:01:39] her dad sometimes while they're driving
[1:01:40] down the road and then there's audio
[1:01:42] tapes of lavell and brother Branham
[1:01:44] giving their ideas back on editing this
[1:01:46] book they edited it for about four years
[1:01:48] four or five years so brother Graham
[1:01:50] read this through or heard it at least
[1:01:52] five times and see these quotes match
[1:01:56] the quotes I just read you from the
[1:01:58] questions and answers so anybody that's
[1:02:00] trying to get you to find you look for
[1:02:02] something that's contrary to the word
[1:02:04] just tell them say get behind me Satan
[1:02:07] I'm staying with God's Word
[1:02:09] I've heard the thunders of God amen
[1:02:12] I think the Thunder of God has roared
[1:02:15] out and its impact in my life praise God
[1:02:18] amen it's turned my heart back to the
[1:02:22] Apostolic father's glory all right now
[1:02:27] let me poke that one real quick again as
[1:02:29] I've always said this is one of these
[1:02:32] days Lord willing I want to buy one of
[1:02:34] those stickers you know how people can
[1:02:35] hang skips or stickers on the wall and
[1:02:37] it's like a Bible quote one of these
[1:02:39] days I want to put that scripture over
[1:02:40] there the fullness of Pentecost will be
[1:02:43] in the bride thus saith the Lord because
[1:02:46] that's our vision any church without a
[1:02:48] vision will perish right but what about
[1:02:51] the true seed it will happen just as
[1:02:53] we've said the people of God are being
[1:02:55] made ready by the word of truth from the
[1:02:58] messenger to this age in her will be the
[1:03:01] fullness of Pentecost for the Spirit
[1:03:03] will bring the people right back to
[1:03:06] where they were the beginning that is
[1:03:08] thus saith the LORD Oh what are we doing
[1:03:11] church we are prophesying again to every
[1:03:14] nation kindred and tongue amen we are
[1:03:17] part of Revelation 10 11 we're doing it
[1:03:19] here in America praise God
[1:03:21] we're prophesy again and every week I
[1:03:23] get another request somebody overseas
[1:03:25] likes my video and they start listening
[1:03:27] to our sermons I got one this week from
[1:03:28] Uganda another brother wants to follow
[1:03:30] our the preaching because they they can
[1:03:32] sense the Holy Spirit's in it so see
[1:03:35] even even our little church is doing its
[1:03:37] part to take this mint this revelation
[1:03:40] this mystery and prophesy it again
[1:03:43] that's the age we're living in then he
[1:03:45] quotes the scripture I will restore
[1:03:47] where is it there it is Joel - 23 to 26
[1:03:51] is our scripture for the latter rain
[1:03:54] before the rapture I'll restore all the
[1:03:57] years the loketh is eaten by and ye
[1:04:01] shall here's here's our prophecy church
[1:04:03] this is what we're going to come to we
[1:04:04] are going to eat in plenty and be
[1:04:06] satisfied and we're gonna praise the
[1:04:09] name of Jesus before the rapture we will
[1:04:13] eat all God's food will be satisfied
[1:04:16] will praise His name
[1:04:18] then we will have the fullness of
[1:04:21] Pentecost back in the church the program
[1:04:26] says how it's gonna be done now he says
[1:04:28] it twice did I miss it yeah he says it
[1:04:31] twice thus saith the Lord it is thus
[1:04:33] saith the Lord for that is what Joel
[1:04:34] 2:23 says and then he tells us the
[1:04:36] latter rain is rapturing faith at the
[1:04:39] bottom he said God is doing it he's
[1:04:42] restoring his church by 23 verse 23 the
[1:04:46] former and latter rain next will come
[1:04:48] the harvest rain a rapture in faith so
[1:04:51] we got to stay under this and this is
[1:04:53] what I believe it now - I know many
[1:04:54] preachers disagree with me
[1:04:55] the rain we're getting right now is
[1:04:57] teaching rain people don't want to be
[1:05:00] taught the Word of God they just want to
[1:05:02] come to church and live however they
[1:05:03] want to live but if you're a real child
[1:05:05] of God you'll be enjoying the rain from
[1:05:08] heaven and it's gonna teach you this
[1:05:10] message amen it's gonna teach you the
[1:05:12] message because Jesus said go into all
[1:05:14] nations and teach and make disciples
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:18] praise God they said baptize them in the
[1:05:21] name of the father's and only ghost
[1:05:23] let's pull that up real quick
[1:05:24] he said teaching all nations where's my
[1:05:28] Bible app there it is so I wasn't really
[1:05:33] planning this is one of those nervous
[1:05:34] sermons well Jose where I was trying to
[1:05:36] get a message ready but I felt like the
[1:05:38] Holy Spirit gave me some kind of just
[1:05:39] waiting on his leading you know Lou
[1:05:41] usually I got all the quotes lined up
[1:05:43] and it's just picture perfect not today
[1:05:46] and these are the days I don't like
[1:05:47] preaching like that but God can still
[1:05:50] use it praise God
[1:05:51] okay what Scripture was I going to are
[1:05:55] you forgot hmm help me Lord oh yeah yeah
[1:06:02] thank you thank you brother appreciate
[1:06:04] that teaching all nations yeah thank you
[1:06:08] brother
[1:06:16] yeahthere's yeah you know and in church
[1:06:19] even I think a lot of people
[1:06:21] misunderstand these are God's last work
[1:06:23] these are Christ's last words before he
[1:06:25] leaves the earth he says all power is
[1:06:28] given to me in heaven and earth go
[1:06:29] either for and teach all nations teach
[1:06:31] teach baptizing them in the name of the
[1:06:34] Father and of the son of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:36] teaching them he says it twice people
[1:06:39] need to learn how to obey God amen how
[1:06:43] do you get children to obey at school
[1:06:45] Johnny I just got to tell them over and
[1:06:46] over they got to erase their their
[1:06:49] capital letter capital T when it should
[1:06:51] be a lower case they got erase it and
[1:06:53] erase it and rewrite it until they learn
[1:06:55] it praise God
[1:06:57] same way for us a preachers got to
[1:07:00] preach it brother cams got to preach it
[1:07:01] brother Brooks has to preach it brother
[1:07:03] Jesse's got to preach it all these
[1:07:04] preachers and I gotta learn it too we
[1:07:07] all got to learn it we all got to be
[1:07:08] taught the things of God amen that's the
[1:07:11] rain that's falling now but about the
[1:07:13] time of the rapture there's gonna come a
[1:07:15] greater anointing praise God it's not
[1:07:18] the latter rain it's gonna be rapturing
[1:07:20] faith amen and don't worry God will get
[1:07:23] you ready for it amen
[1:07:24] if God got them ready for the first
[1:07:26] Exodus if God got them ready for the
[1:07:28] second axis then you know God's going to
[1:07:31] get us ready for the third accidents
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:33] we will not glory in our ability always
[1:07:37] we will do is just yield to the Holy
[1:07:39] Spirit the same way they did if the
[1:07:42] second Exodus was the day of Pentecost
[1:07:43] what do they do they just let the
[1:07:45] conditions they kind of got nervous of
[1:07:47] the conditions the conditions squeeze
[1:07:49] them to the upper room come on church
[1:07:52] and then they started praying brother
[1:07:55] Johnny and they started crying out to
[1:07:56] God for 10 days and then the fire fell a
[1:08:00] man the scripture the promise was
[1:08:03] fulfilled see God is going to get us
[1:08:05] ready for the rapture amen you don't to
[1:08:07] rely upon a man you should trust man and
[1:08:10] and love your Christian family but God
[1:08:12] is going to get us ready because Jesus
[1:08:14] does all three the shout voice of the
[1:08:16] Trump as he descends amen
[1:08:19] he does all three that's what Paul said
[1:08:22] Paul said Jesus will give a shout a
[1:08:24] voice and a Trump Jesus does all three
[1:08:27] Jesus
[1:08:28] is gonna get glory not us nobody's come
[1:08:31] nobody's gonna come in heaven and
[1:08:33] worship and say oh you're a Laodicean
[1:08:35] Church age bride member oh you're so
[1:08:38] holy that not we need to get that
[1:08:40] nonsense if it's in our minds we need to
[1:08:42] get it out of our behinds we're not
[1:08:44] gonna get any glory will get honored by
[1:08:46] Jesus will get it rewards from Jesus but
[1:08:49] Jesus is gonna get all the glory praise
[1:08:51] God amen
[1:08:54] see we got to teach well the RAM says
[1:08:57] the rain right now is the teaching rain
[1:09:00] how many want to learn just how to live
[1:09:02] the message I'm constantly I want to
[1:09:05] always learn how I can live the message
[1:09:06] especially for my children that I can be
[1:09:08] good examples to my children for the
[1:09:10] next generation I'm constantly seeing my
[1:09:13] failures here my fairs there but I'm
[1:09:15] also seeing victories here amen like my
[1:09:19] children coming up for the Holy Ghost I
[1:09:20] didn't tell them to come up God brought
[1:09:22] them up now their experiences they got a
[1:09:25] lineup just like just like I do they got
[1:09:27] a lineup
[1:09:28] their experience to the word just like I
[1:09:29] got do it too I can't give them the Holy
[1:09:32] Ghost I can't I don't beg them to get
[1:09:34] the Holy Ghost now when they when they
[1:09:36] were little I'll be I'll be honest when
[1:09:38] they were little sister Naomi I go up to
[1:09:40] their bed I remember Malik guys bunk and
[1:09:41] ladies bunk and while they're sleeping I
[1:09:43] pray God please fill them with the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost I did that numerous times but I
[1:09:48] don't think I ever told them that I mean
[1:09:49] if maybe they were half awake one time
[1:09:51] and heard me do that but I would go in
[1:09:53] there and say God fill them with the
[1:09:54] Holy Ghost God let your Holy Ghost come
[1:09:56] upon them let them be real Christians
[1:09:57] and for the girls I pray God send Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost fill men that they'll marry and
[1:10:02] not these scallywags that say they
[1:10:03] believe and don't have the Holy Ghost I
[1:10:08] think that's a pirate term or something
[1:10:10] like that but that's just the word that
[1:10:12] came to my mind so forgive me you know
[1:10:13] what I mean some in in sincere
[1:10:16] unrepentant churchgoer
[1:10:18] that's not born again that doesn't love
[1:10:21] the blood of Jesus Christ that doesn't
[1:10:23] love the cross of Jesus Christ God sends
[1:10:25] some men who are really born again that
[1:10:27] love Jesus Christ more than everything
[1:10:29] else amen don't have these perverted
[1:10:33] message churchgoers that are addicted to
[1:10:36] pornography try to woo my daughter's and
[1:10:39] I pray the Holy Spirit protect this
[1:10:40] church from that amen
[1:10:42] I know yeah that's my prayer or some
[1:10:45] Jezebel that would try to trick maokai
[1:10:47] into it and lord willing our next son
[1:10:49] we'll see but you understand church we
[1:10:53] need taught the Word of God all of our
[1:10:58] trials in life are to teach us God's
[1:11:01] Word how many believe that everything in
[1:11:04] life is a lesson so we can learn how to
[1:11:07] better serve the Lord but a lot of
[1:11:10] people don't like to learn these are
[1:11:12] just to turn on the TV or it's easier to
[1:11:14] turn on your phone or your iPad right
[1:11:16] it's easier to turn that on rather than
[1:11:17] just pray it now it's okay if your turn
[1:11:19] on to worship right but if people are in
[1:11:23] other words they're trying to escape
[1:11:24] repentance if they're trying to escape
[1:11:25] dealing with problems or escape dealing
[1:11:28] with their situation and just escape
[1:11:30] that like they would alcohol I mean
[1:11:32] that's all I can was saying we're that
[1:11:34] beautiful that's all people's
[1:11:35] smartphones are they're just another
[1:11:36] form of alcoholism it's just another way
[1:11:39] for people to escape and and feed their
[1:11:42] fleshly lusts it's just a different form
[1:11:44] right it's just another idle see just
[1:11:48] like a bottle of alcohol so idle just
[1:11:51] like a pack of cigarettes as idle
[1:11:52] people's phones can become idols too and
[1:11:56] so we must make sure nothing is idle we
[1:11:58] must use that phone we must use all that
[1:12:01] God's given us to help us glorify the
[1:12:03] Lord yeah we know that priests long and
[1:12:06] hard on that so see don't and I know
[1:12:10] there's quotes but you have to balance
[1:12:12] out all the codes brother and says see
[1:12:14] the gospel is not done in teaching it's
[1:12:16] done in power and demonstration that's
[1:12:17] true but but it's both true both are
[1:12:20] true you got to have the power of God
[1:12:22] then you got to come around and teach
[1:12:23] him how to live right right because
[1:12:27] we've all seen people that have had
[1:12:28] miracles happen like I was telling that
[1:12:30] brother at cancer he used to walk on a
[1:12:32] cane God healed him I was there and God
[1:12:34] did it and now they're back stirred in
[1:12:36] living in the world so you need the
[1:12:39] power of the power of God was there to
[1:12:41] show them how real God is to show them
[1:12:44] God's love but then you got to be
[1:12:46] trained and taught God's Word afterwards
[1:12:48] amen because we all got away we all got
[1:12:51] to come God's provided way through
[1:12:53] justification st. vacation that's
[1:12:55] holy ghost my okay now I think I'm yeah
[1:13:07] okay now let me pull this out here let
[1:13:10] me post next chord out here I've used
[1:13:12] this in the past but as I was praying
[1:13:16] this morning at the altar this script
[1:13:20] this quote came to my mind
[1:13:21] oh yeah there's only one okay okay so
[1:13:25] Bob Rams preaching or teaching in the
[1:13:27] Laodicean Church age and he's saying how
[1:13:31] he's saying how denominations have
[1:13:33] enough of the Holy Ghost they don't want
[1:13:34] more that's what I love how everybody
[1:13:36] supported our special meetings and I
[1:13:39] love even more how you're here the next
[1:13:40] Sunday because special meetings aren't
[1:13:44] enough you need more of God today right
[1:13:47] anybody can get excited for special
[1:13:49] meetings I get excited too but who can
[1:13:52] get up the next week when there's no
[1:13:53] special guests no visitors there's
[1:13:56] nothing there's nothing fantastic going
[1:13:58] on but who just wants more of God amen
[1:14:01] that's who's got the Holy Ghost that's
[1:14:04] quarter brother branham he said he said
[1:14:07] compare the twentieth century Church to
[1:14:11] the first century Church go ahead
[1:14:12] where's the power where's the power and
[1:14:16] denominations and mega churches just to
[1:14:18] overcome lust or greed where's the power
[1:14:20] there
[1:14:21] they don't have it where's the love who
[1:14:26] was it telling me this week a preacher
[1:14:29] former domination oh yeah yeah there's a
[1:14:32] brother well there's a brother from
[1:14:35] Columbus yeah the brother from Columbus
[1:14:37] one of his buddies went to a new church
[1:14:41] and the pastor buddied him up they were
[1:14:43] Pentecostal they were speaking in
[1:14:44] tongues and believed in all kinds of
[1:14:46] supernatural things but the pastor buddy
[1:14:48] them up and then said hey can you invest
[1:14:51] this certain number of thousands of
[1:14:53] dollars we're gonna try to do this
[1:14:54] business investment and then a week
[1:14:57] later the pastor stopped contact him he
[1:15:00] just took the money man can you imagine
[1:15:03] that church that's that's in Columbus
[1:15:06] that's not a message church but it's
[1:15:09] people that used to
[1:15:10] in the message and they go to the visit
[1:15:12] these churches you better watch those
[1:15:14] preachers you better watch those
[1:15:16] preachers where's the love you don't
[1:15:19] have enough
[1:15:20] the very purpose he brought him in was
[1:15:21] to get money from them and then just go
[1:15:23] ahead and go I got a big enough Church
[1:15:24] you can go ahead and go Devils and
[1:15:28] shoe-leather is what they are where's
[1:15:30] the purified Church that withstood sin
[1:15:33] and walked with fate toward Jesus
[1:15:35] where's the unity you can't find it if
[1:15:39] this church has all it needs speaking of
[1:15:41] the denominator church why were they in
[1:15:44] Pentecost crying out for more of God in
[1:15:47] the book of Acts as though they didn't
[1:15:49] have it at all and yet they had far more
[1:15:52] than they have today
[1:15:54] go to acts 4 here's where they're crying
[1:15:57] out for more of God they just got the
[1:15:59] Holy Ghost I think a few days or weeks
[1:16:01] previous to this and we read it on a
[1:16:05] little bit on Wednesday night but go
[1:16:06] back there acts 424 this is the quote
[1:16:11] this is the scripture brother Rams
[1:16:12] referring to the original Holy Ghost
[1:16:15] field st. they got the Holy Ghost Peter
[1:16:17] and John did that miracle on the name of
[1:16:20] Jesus Christ rise up they got persecuted
[1:16:23] they got brought before the council they
[1:16:25] got beaten and they were so there were a
[1:16:27] little bit discouraged so they went to
[1:16:29] have a prayer meeting and then they
[1:16:31] prayed and the Holy Ghost filled
[1:16:33] everybody that wasn't filled so church
[1:16:36] like this is a good idea when we get
[1:16:37] discouraged we need a fresh prayer
[1:16:39] meeting we need a fresh time in the
[1:16:42] closet sister Beatrice we need a fresh
[1:16:45] time on our knees amen and ask God
[1:16:47] restore my boldness amen I need more of
[1:16:51] God romance in the early church they
[1:16:53] were crying out for more of God that's
[1:16:55] proof that they had a see proof that
[1:16:58] people don't have it is they don't want
[1:17:00] more of the Holy Ghost they're lukewarm
[1:17:02] see verse 24 and when they'd heard that
[1:17:06] they lift up their voice to God with one
[1:17:08] Accord and said Lord thou art God which
[1:17:10] has made heaven and earth and the sea
[1:17:11] and all that is in them now go down to
[1:17:13] verse 29 and now Lord behold their
[1:17:15] threatenings and grant unto thy servants
[1:17:18] that with all boldness they may speak
[1:17:20] thy word by stretching forth thine hand
[1:17:22] he
[1:17:23] that signs and wonders may be done by
[1:17:25] the name with I Holy Child Jesus and
[1:17:27] when they had prayed the place was
[1:17:29] shaken where they were assembled
[1:17:30] together and then they were all filled
[1:17:32] with the Holy Ghost and they spake the
[1:17:34] Word of God with boldness this is the
[1:17:37] scripture brother Rance referring to
[1:17:39] people that had the Holy Ghost said I
[1:17:41] can see I'm not bored as I should be
[1:17:44] Lord send the power give me a fresh
[1:17:46] anointing in my mind praise God
[1:17:50] thank the Lord the church sometimes
[1:17:56] you'll see me come up here for prayer
[1:17:57] that's because I need a fresh anointing
[1:17:59] I'm saying God restore my boldness how
[1:18:02] many can say amen to that you've needed
[1:18:04] a fresh anointing from time to time when
[1:18:07] you go through trials and you get
[1:18:08] discouraged
[1:18:09] you got a that's what we have to do we
[1:18:11] have to cry out for more with the danger
[1:18:14] as we said in message churches as people
[1:18:16] that go for weeks and years and months
[1:18:18] and decades and never cried to God for
[1:18:21] fresh experience and I think I can share
[1:18:26] like it when I was there at Albion last
[1:18:28] time in September I had grown people 60
[1:18:30] and 70 years old walking up they've been
[1:18:32] that they've been in the message longer
[1:18:33] than I've been alive and they're weeping
[1:18:35] and crying say I don't even feel like
[1:18:37] I'm saved
[1:18:38] now why now we had a good prayer and I
[1:18:40] gave him some quotes in the scriptures
[1:18:41] and later that over Facebook I get I
[1:18:43] shared some things and I think they got
[1:18:45] their victory back but see church you
[1:18:49] know we shouldn't go decades and decades
[1:18:51] and decades without a fresh experience
[1:18:53] where we know God's Spirit came down and
[1:18:56] anointed me it failed me it gave me
[1:18:59] power and I'm walking in victory praise
[1:19:01] God let's be one of those Saints that
[1:19:04] you have victory you go from victory to
[1:19:06] victory from glory to glory from faith
[1:19:09] to faith more and more shining brighter
[1:19:12] unto a perfect day praise God let's be
[1:19:16] like that and I'm not speaking against
[1:19:19] that the sweet people out there Alby and
[1:19:20] I'm just saying it could have been any
[1:19:22] Church you know I'm just saying that was
[1:19:24] one example yeah I thank God for the
[1:19:27] that they came up for prayer that's a
[1:19:29] good sign that the Holy Spirit's deal
[1:19:30] with you when you come up for prayer for
[1:19:31] things like that but you don't have to
[1:19:33] come up for prayer God can meet you
[1:19:34] right at your seat how many believe that
[1:19:37] it just raises your faith many times
[1:19:39] when you come up for prayer because
[1:19:40] you're gathering your faith you're
[1:19:42] putting it with a minister or a brother
[1:19:44] sister something along those lines
[1:19:47] okay and I want to read this too and
[1:19:54] then I'll get back to my my text here I
[1:19:56] guess it's all kind of the same program
[1:20:02] tells us Jesus now look at this you know
[1:20:04] who Jesus his biggest enemy was his
[1:20:07] flesh
[1:20:08] well Ram said in his own personal life
[1:20:10] contending with himself can you imagine
[1:20:14] that Jesus had to drive away the devil
[1:20:17] the angels came and strengthened him but
[1:20:19] brother have said he was contending with
[1:20:21] his own flesh in that encouraging your
[1:20:24] greatest enemy is gonna be yourself if
[1:20:27] you can just overcome your flesh your
[1:20:29] sin nature how did Jesus overcome by
[1:20:34] obedience to the Word of God there's no
[1:20:38] other way to overcome then obey God's
[1:20:40] Word in other words don't sin next time
[1:20:43] don't let that addiction get you again
[1:20:46] don't let it happen overcome it Hebrews
[1:20:50] 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh
[1:20:52] we need to offer the prayers and
[1:20:53] supplications with strong crying in
[1:20:55] tears under him that was able to save
[1:20:58] him from death he was heard and that he
[1:21:00] feared though he were a son yet learned
[1:21:02] he obedience by the things which he
[1:21:04] suffered and being made perfect he
[1:21:07] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:21:08] unto all that obey Him what was the
[1:21:11] obedient to the Word of God and now
[1:21:15] let's bring it down to you and I now
[1:21:18] then there will not be one person who
[1:21:22] will sit in the throne with the Lord
[1:21:24] Jesus unless he's been living that word
[1:21:30] so brother that makes it clear the only
[1:21:32] way you're gonna sit by Jesus is to cry
[1:21:35] out and say God deliver me from my flesh
[1:21:37] amen and then get victory over my flesh
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:41] that's the only way how many want to sit
[1:21:45] by Jesus I know I already know my seat
[1:21:48] if I make it my seat is the last one in
[1:21:50] the
[1:21:51] the last one because I'm the least of
[1:21:53] all God's servants I believe that I
[1:21:55] really am but I'm doing a seat there
[1:21:58] praise God
[1:21:59] they said the only way you're gonna do
[1:22:02] that is if you're living the word you're
[1:22:05] overcoming the sin nature in your flesh
[1:22:10] now look you says your prayers your
[1:22:13] fastings your repentance is no matter
[1:22:15] what you present to God none of that
[1:22:17] will gain you the privilege of sitting
[1:22:18] in that throne see something that
[1:22:20] denominations they fast think of Muslims
[1:22:22] they fast all the time at their holidays
[1:22:26] and Jews they fast way more than
[1:22:28] probably we do see fasting prayers
[1:22:31] repentance see that's probably half
[1:22:33] harder repentance no matter what you
[1:22:35] present that won't gain you the
[1:22:37] privilege of sitting in that throne it
[1:22:39] will be granted he says only to the word
[1:22:42] broad as the throne of the king is
[1:22:45] shared with the Queen because she's
[1:22:46] United to him so only they who are of
[1:22:49] that word even as he's of that word will
[1:22:52] share that throne and this is where I've
[1:22:57] been laboring on Peter said if you want
[1:23:02] to overcome giving all diligence right
[1:23:06] so it's gonna take here Peter says
[1:23:09] everything you get is by a promise see
[1:23:12] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:23:14] diet into by nature by what promises so
[1:23:17] we have to read a promise like let's say
[1:23:19] justice overcoming greed or pornography
[1:23:22] you got to look at the promise and you
[1:23:23] gotta look at Joel where he said I made
[1:23:25] a covenant with my eyes I won't look
[1:23:27] upon a maid you have to read that
[1:23:29] promise and say God I believe that I'm
[1:23:32] gonna obey that next time the tempter
[1:23:34] comes see what I mean and now you're an
[1:23:38] overcomer you got to believe that
[1:23:40] promise and then when you obey that
[1:23:41] promise now you overcome amen but see
[1:23:47] it's gonna take some effort see that's
[1:23:49] what Americans don't like Americans
[1:23:51] don't like effort they don't want to
[1:23:53] give effort because life gets so easy
[1:23:55] well the rams have a higher paying job
[1:23:57] we'll just make things a little bit
[1:23:58] easier for your flesh it's not gonna
[1:24:00] make it easier on your spirit right now
[1:24:03] the
[1:24:04] god we get you know job increases you
[1:24:06] know money increases but that's not the
[1:24:08] answer
[1:24:09] the answer is increasing your love for
[1:24:10] God that's the answer
[1:24:13] increasing your time coming to church
[1:24:15] increase your time praying an increase
[1:24:18] increase your time serving other people
[1:24:19] that's the answer if you can have that
[1:24:22] with that then praise God if not God may
[1:24:25] take you through a season of loss so see
[1:24:29] escaped corruption and then give all
[1:24:31] your diligence if we want to get closer
[1:24:35] to God we got to give all diligence but
[1:24:38] man says I don't care if you faster pray
[1:24:40] or try to repent you've got to live the
[1:24:41] word if we overcome and give all
[1:24:45] diligence
[1:24:45] we'll sit with him on his throne he's
[1:24:48] got a seat ready somewhere by him I
[1:24:51] imagine you know Paul might be here
[1:24:53] Peter might be there it's up to the
[1:24:56] Father but I want a seat up there by the
[1:24:59] grace of God now he says it again just
[1:25:02] so you know yeah Peter repeats it you
[1:25:07] know why they do repeat it to emphasize
[1:25:08] it
[1:25:09] he says wherefore the rather brethren
[1:25:11] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:25:13] election sure for if you do these things
[1:25:16] you shall never fail in other words
[1:25:19] prove it to everybody
[1:25:21] prove to everybody which side you're on
[1:25:23] if you want people to know you're a wise
[1:25:26] version then prove it to them when sin
[1:25:29] is placed before you cast it down
[1:25:31] overcome it and be an overcomer praise
[1:25:34] God when your flesh when it's just you
[1:25:37] and your flesh and no one else is around
[1:25:38] prove that you're the word bride cast
[1:25:41] that down overcome it and the Bible said
[1:25:44] that he'll give you the victory in due
[1:25:46] season praise God amen all right is that
[1:25:50] helpful by God's grace now that's my
[1:25:52] introduction praise the Lord so now
[1:25:55] let's uh let's move on here I didn't
[1:25:59] really plan to preach all that go to
[1:26:00] acts 11:15 that's all that kind of came
[1:26:06] to me and a lot of that is review but we
[1:26:08] need to review it from time to time
[1:26:09] don't wait Church how many appreciate
[1:26:11] that reminder I hope somebody
[1:26:13] appreciates it now
[1:26:18] what convinces this group of Jews who
[1:26:21] really they think all Gentiles are dirty
[1:26:25] filthy human beings and they won't eat
[1:26:26] with them what convinces them that the
[1:26:29] Holy Ghost did fall on Cornelius and his
[1:26:31] house verse verse verse 14 who shall
[1:26:37] tell the words which whereby thou and
[1:26:41] all thy house shall be saved and I see
[1:26:43] as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell
[1:26:45] on them as on us at the beginning then I
[1:26:47] remembered I the word of the Lord how
[1:26:50] that he said John indeed baptize with
[1:26:52] fire but I shall be baptized with the
[1:26:54] Holy Ghost for as much then as God gave
[1:26:57] them the like gift as he dosnt us who
[1:26:59] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what
[1:27:01] was I that I could withstand God look at
[1:27:04] that he was trying to withstand God he
[1:27:09] was trying like I don't want to go to
[1:27:10] the Gentiles lord I don't want to go
[1:27:12] there and then eventually he went
[1:27:15] through the three visions remember the
[1:27:16] visions of the sheet drop down finally
[1:27:18] then he said okay and then corniest
[1:27:22] falls down to worship him he said get up
[1:27:24] I'm just a man he knew he was a man cuz
[1:27:26] he failed he denied Christ three times
[1:27:27] I'm sure that was fresh on his mind I'm
[1:27:29] nobody Church we should have the same
[1:27:31] attitude who are I Who am I who are we
[1:27:34] were nothing but with God all things are
[1:27:36] possible
[1:27:37] so raised him up he started preaching
[1:27:40] the Holy Ghost falls on them and then
[1:27:42] the next verse I believe it's a 18 and
[1:27:44] when they heard these things they helped
[1:27:46] their peace and glorified God saying
[1:27:49] then hath God also to the Gentiles
[1:27:52] granted repentance unto life so how did
[1:27:56] Peter convince these Jews that were
[1:27:58] staunch we don't like Gentiles they're
[1:28:00] just their unholy rollers we won't even
[1:28:02] eat with him how'd he convince them he
[1:28:04] used experience and the word glory
[1:28:07] that's what you and I need praise God to
[1:28:10] convince us of anything we've got to see
[1:28:12] God vindicated by a supernatural power
[1:28:15] and first it's got to be in the word see
[1:28:19] that and here's what I believe with amen
[1:28:23] since those guys since those Jews were
[1:28:24] filled the Holy Ghost as the Holy Ghost
[1:28:26] anointed Peter I believe the Holy Ghost
[1:28:28] came in like a rushing mighty wind
[1:28:31] and just swept over those men's minds in
[1:28:33] there there discriminator racism right
[1:28:36] against Gentiles that's what is the same
[1:28:38] thing you'll do today same thing you do
[1:28:41] today
[1:28:42] let the Holy Spirit anoint a man he'll
[1:28:44] just talk about the Holy Ghost if that
[1:28:46] person's really born again the Holy
[1:28:48] Spirit will change their minds if
[1:28:49] they're willing to accept correction
[1:28:54] imagine that some brilliant man some of
[1:28:56] these men were probably 40 50 60 years
[1:28:58] old and they knew Gentiles were dirty
[1:29:01] filthy pigs dogs seek Jesus call them
[1:29:03] dogs and in a moment their mind has
[1:29:07] changed because they the Holy Spirit was
[1:29:09] there they said well if they acted like
[1:29:11] us and they must be one of them praise
[1:29:13] God and they got excited about Jesus and
[1:29:16] looked like they were drunk and
[1:29:17] declaring the wonderful works of God
[1:29:19] they must be born again and so the Holy
[1:29:22] Spirit changed their minds after decades
[1:29:24] of this disgrace towards Gentiles and
[1:29:28] look and putting their nose up at him
[1:29:30] and all those things God changed their
[1:29:32] minds in a moment by the power of the
[1:29:34] Holy Spirit glory
[1:29:37] remember they thought they were drunk
[1:29:39] now well Johnny spent a long time since
[1:29:41] I've been around drunk people so I've
[1:29:42] been a Holy Ghost field sanctified Saint
[1:29:44] for a long time but the last time I
[1:29:47] remember being around drunk people where
[1:29:48] they meant was that some parties and
[1:29:49] they just had this the big red you know
[1:29:51] how their faces were red I don't know
[1:29:53] and I got smelly breath I never really
[1:29:57] got drunk all the way I just kind of got
[1:29:58] a little buzzed I guess you saw you say
[1:30:01] like that but I always knew I was kind
[1:30:03] of in control
[1:30:05] I said but I started saying things as
[1:30:07] soon as I started saying things I'm like
[1:30:08] I didn't know that was gonna come out of
[1:30:09] my mouth I started losing my inhibitions
[1:30:11] as soon as that happened I turned out
[1:30:13] and I never liked the taste of it anyway
[1:30:14] it's poison you know but you know when
[1:30:17] you see a drug person a lot of them just
[1:30:20] get really lose their inhibitions right
[1:30:21] and they stick out their chest and they
[1:30:24] start talking real loud a lot of them do
[1:30:27] well what do you think the Holy Ghost
[1:30:29] does the people and then they're fearful
[1:30:32] it's caring and doubting the Holy Spirit
[1:30:34] sets them free praise God and they
[1:30:37] worship God and they said they're a
[1:30:38] bunch of drunk people it's 9:00 a.m.
[1:30:40] what are they doing and running around
[1:30:42] the streets here what are you doing
[1:30:43] and praising God crying they must be
[1:30:45] drunk and Peter said no this is what
[1:30:47] Joel spoke up this is that which the
[1:30:50] Prophet Joel spoke up this is divine
[1:30:52] wine praise God this is that this is God
[1:30:56] pouring out shedding his spirit upon us
[1:30:59] and we're declaring the wonderful works
[1:31:01] of God so much so the three thousand
[1:31:03] people got saved the same thing they
[1:31:08] wanted in Chapter four give us boldness
[1:31:10] they were boldly praising the Lord oh
[1:31:14] thank you Jesus brother Branham calls
[1:31:22] his experience
[1:31:24] booooo-whoo experience maybe I can find
[1:31:29] out a little quote I mean I got it on my
[1:31:30] notes but let me see if I can just pull
[1:31:31] it up real quick here in the app he says
[1:31:37] I think every once in a while when it
[1:31:39] comes back on me yeah here's the new
[1:31:42] verb there's no different from any other
[1:31:44] birth it's a mess so children think
[1:31:46] about what happened two Saturdays ago
[1:31:48] it's got to be a mess it's got to be
[1:31:51] like you've lost you lost your control
[1:31:53] of your of yourself and you start praise
[1:31:56] and glorifying God you ought to see what
[1:32:00] mess I was when I got it and every once
[1:32:05] in a while see I like that seat we got
[1:32:07] to have fresh experiences every now and
[1:32:08] then and every once in a while when it
[1:32:12] comes upon me again again I get messy
[1:32:15] again with it I cry and boohoo and carry
[1:32:21] on till guests I don't know I don't look
[1:32:23] very good to look at when I got
[1:32:25] something on the inside of me that's
[1:32:27] taking me on and on and on it's new life
[1:32:31] I don't care what it looks like I want
[1:32:34] to know what it is that's the main thing
[1:32:37] hey man see when you come to church and
[1:32:39] just get a boldness or maybe you're not
[1:32:41] both happy maybe just crying and
[1:32:43] boldness and praising God but when you
[1:32:45] leave out of here with new life then God
[1:32:47] has given you a fresh anointing and
[1:32:49] you're to use that anointing to serve
[1:32:51] the Lord and that anointing is let you
[1:32:55] know you are born again
[1:32:56] is to remind you I'm taking you higher
[1:32:58] I'm taking you further I'm gonna keep
[1:33:01] you pray like brother even I was
[1:33:02] thinking about he will hold me fast
[1:33:03] hey man he gives you a fresh anointing
[1:33:06] to hold you for another couple years or
[1:33:09] maybe months or weeks whatever you need
[1:33:11] praise God I'm gonna give you a fresh
[1:33:13] anointing so you can have power and
[1:33:17] strength to continue on the journey he
[1:33:19] said I'm he said it comes upon me I
[1:33:21] don't care how I look I just need new
[1:33:23] life thank the Lord and that's honestly
[1:33:29] what a lot of drunk people I've seen
[1:33:31] look like you know they're all red red
[1:33:33] eye they look kind of tired and some of
[1:33:36] them get sad and angry you don't see
[1:33:37] them fight well that's a program says
[1:33:41] boohoo
[1:33:43] carry on praise the Lord now one thing
[1:33:47] go to second Corinthians
[1:33:48] you know I'll just pull it up here this
[1:33:54] is the thing I've seen the message where
[1:33:58] I think the most people well you
[1:34:00] understand it except probably I've said
[1:34:01] it before yeah there's two kinds of
[1:34:07] weeping at the altar right it's either
[1:34:11] galley weeping or it's worldly weeping
[1:34:14] for godly sorrow worketh repentance to
[1:34:17] salvation not to be repented of so when
[1:34:19] you have a really godly cry you'll see
[1:34:22] because your life will be more obedient
[1:34:25] that's godly repentance but the sorrow
[1:34:29] of the world worketh death okay so
[1:34:35] anybody and I've seen it you know I'll
[1:34:36] share it again just because you know
[1:34:37] Johnny and Sarah here a couple years ago
[1:34:40] we had a brother I was really trying to
[1:34:41] help him out you know becoming the
[1:34:42] message and there was twice I pray with
[1:34:45] him at least an hour and a half on two
[1:34:48] occasions so for a total of three hours
[1:34:50] we cried at this altar right here this
[1:34:52] altar and I tried casting off that devil
[1:34:56] often brother amen about 10 times and he
[1:34:58] wept and cried and scream you probably
[1:35:00] know who I'm talking about but I'm just
[1:35:02] using it as an example and the very next
[1:35:04] Wednesday he wasn't even in church
[1:35:06] already fought after weeping and cried
[1:35:09] for an hour and a half
[1:35:11] it was worldly sorrow because they
[1:35:14] everybody has a conscience that they're
[1:35:16] doing wrong and everybody they're honest
[1:35:19] will feel bad about it and when they
[1:35:21] finally face up to it they're gonna
[1:35:23] sorrow you're gonna have a motion one
[1:35:25] way or the other you're gonna be
[1:35:27] emotional and either continue in it or
[1:35:28] get emotional and and die yourself and
[1:35:31] that the power of Christ guide you so
[1:35:35] there's two kinds of emotion so children
[1:35:38] that's what you should be examine your
[1:35:39] life if you are really repentant Paul
[1:35:44] says you're gonna see it your repentance
[1:35:47] onto deliverance you're gonna be
[1:35:48] delivered you're gonna see your little
[1:35:50] you're living a victorious delivered
[1:35:51] life okay so no make sure I say that
[1:35:55] that's where there's a lot of confusion
[1:35:56] people in the message say they're born
[1:35:58] again because they cry at the altar well
[1:35:59] that just might be worldly sorrow it's
[1:36:02] gotta be genuine repentance and then he
[1:36:04] says later he says you will have zeal I
[1:36:07] like this if you want to get revenge on
[1:36:10] the devil do it by obeying God's Word
[1:36:12] don't badmouth somebody that's us uh
[1:36:15] that's what is that that's hatred that's
[1:36:18] wrath that's jealousy don't badmouth
[1:36:20] somebody you obey God's Word that's how
[1:36:23] you get vengeance on Satan because he
[1:36:25] says it right here he says yes you saw
[1:36:30] it after a godly sort what carefulness
[1:36:31] it wrought in you yay what clearing of
[1:36:33] yourself what indignation see zeal when
[1:36:36] you really repent you got zeal to do
[1:36:38] what's right next time what the Hemet
[1:36:40] desire what zeal what revenge there it
[1:36:43] is right there
[1:36:43] revenge amen glory in other words like
[1:36:47] for me it was I'm gonna take a revenge
[1:36:48] on those cigarettes and I'm gonna write
[1:36:50] walk right past him at Walmart and I'm
[1:36:51] not gonna buy him and then people I see
[1:36:54] smoking I'm gonna try to witness to them
[1:36:56] and say God deliver me from smoking say
[1:36:59] I would take revenge on that I'm gonna
[1:37:01] have zeal and desire to do what's right
[1:37:03] the next time because I really had godly
[1:37:06] sorrow praise God
[1:37:12] all right now
[1:37:17] now let's go through a few more things I
[1:37:19] want to bring up here by God's grace how
[1:37:23] am i doing okay let me set my timer I
[1:37:26] usually do about a hour and a half on
[1:37:29] Sunday morning and that's right yeah so
[1:37:34] let's uh let's finish with a couple more
[1:37:37] things here I want to say give me 15
[1:37:38] more minutes I set my timer the next
[1:37:41] thought I want to bring out is this
[1:37:42] thought on not only will you have an
[1:37:45] emotional experience you have to have
[1:37:46] one of those to be born again right you
[1:37:48] got to have some something's got to
[1:37:50] happen to you when you're born again it
[1:37:52] might be it might be fire over your
[1:37:54] forehead it might be running in the
[1:37:56] streets it might be shouting about we
[1:37:57] might be magnifying God might be
[1:37:59] prophesying speaking in tongues now most
[1:38:01] people I know don't have the prophecy or
[1:38:04] speaking in tongues or we just have
[1:38:05] mostly magnifying God you know which is
[1:38:09] good that's that's that's that's right
[1:38:10] that's that's fine uh because it's all
[1:38:14] ordained of God because the gifts and
[1:38:17] callings of God are without repentance
[1:38:19] and let me lay this in here before I
[1:38:21] forget brother Cameron brother Brooks
[1:38:23] told all these stories about speaking
[1:38:24] the word right brother Brooks would
[1:38:26] speak to a paper and let me just remind
[1:38:29] our church of this brother cam Wood
[1:38:31] spoke to the cat right
[1:38:33] josè spoken to the barren woman right I
[1:38:37] spoke to who is that right spoke to the
[1:38:42] mountain that was in front of them I'll
[1:38:43] say like that and God honor those
[1:38:45] requests I just want to reiterate to you
[1:38:48] we can only do that as letter the Lord
[1:38:52] because I talk to brother Brooks and cam
[1:38:54] they both have problems you talked to me
[1:38:57] I have some problems I wish we could
[1:38:58] figure out you know well if it's so easy
[1:39:02] to speak to everything why don't we just
[1:39:03] want me to speak to our problems because
[1:39:05] you can't do it until God tells you to
[1:39:07] do it let me tell you brother Oaks can
[1:39:10] they have some real problems with people
[1:39:11] in their church and family they have
[1:39:14] some real family problems look at my
[1:39:16] family look at my parents we have some
[1:39:18] real problems and I do anything but
[1:39:20] Johnny I'd do anything to speak right
[1:39:22] now to that mountain but I can't do it
[1:39:24] until God tells me to do it does ever
[1:39:28] understand I want to just encourage you
[1:39:30] like whether
[1:39:31] even Jose this week with Jose I was just
[1:39:33] use you I was like Lord just annoying me
[1:39:36] to speak to your mouth situation because
[1:39:37] remember those quotes brother Ram said
[1:39:39] we gotta have faith to cure a toothache
[1:39:41] right and so my heart I'm like Lord
[1:39:44] anoint me while I'm still waiting right
[1:39:45] here but I can't do it not in my flesh I
[1:39:48] want to but I can't do it until God
[1:39:51] tells me to do it but see if we all get
[1:39:55] under the spirit and we all go under
[1:39:57] God's anointing maybe God will have
[1:39:58] somebody do it
[1:40:00] that's the thing that's where Paul says
[1:40:02] you got to not just you just got to not
[1:40:05] just go to church you got to walk in the
[1:40:07] spirit we got to constantly pray and say
[1:40:10] God speak to me and have me know what
[1:40:12] you had me to do help me to be able to
[1:40:15] speak to it I'm glad I'm glad Jose's
[1:40:18] feeling better he can come to church now
[1:40:19] thank God for that we prayed for that
[1:40:21] there's everything to understand I just
[1:40:24] want you to understand so much that just
[1:40:25] like brother Branham said we can't speak
[1:40:27] anything until God tells us to but we
[1:40:30] got to be sanctified and set aside so
[1:40:32] God can tell us to do something like
[1:40:34] that because I was really moved by those
[1:40:38] testimonies I love I love the one I was
[1:40:40] a witness of cam situation cam let me
[1:40:42] know about that that man that kind of
[1:40:44] swindled the money from him cam let me
[1:40:46] know about that a year ago now and I'll
[1:40:48] tell you bout Johnny I was mad on the
[1:40:49] phone I was like brother cam you need to
[1:40:50] take him to court I think I was saying
[1:40:51] stuff like that I was like man that was
[1:40:53] a lot of money it was thousands of
[1:40:55] dollars
[1:40:55] I don't suppressions say the number I
[1:40:57] remember it was a lot of money and I
[1:41:00] felt bad for my brother amen I was like
[1:41:04] feeling bad like what should I do I'm
[1:41:06] gonna call that guy in Tomah and I never
[1:41:08] did but I felt the flesh and it's so
[1:41:12] awesome to hear I didn't even know that
[1:41:13] story till cam told it the Holy Spirit
[1:41:15] just said wait on it you know just wait
[1:41:17] just forgive forgive and then he got
[1:41:18] some of that money back years later I
[1:41:20] was a witness of that because I was cam
[1:41:23] told me about it right after it happened
[1:41:24] and see Church God work everything out
[1:41:28] if you just leave it in his hands we got
[1:41:31] to leave everything in those precious
[1:41:33] nail-scarred hands alright now let me go
[1:41:36] through this thought this is the one I
[1:41:37] want to close with here you will do more
[1:41:39] than just come to church pay your tithes
[1:41:42] we know all those things those are all
[1:41:44] excellent
[1:41:45] oddly things to do we wouldn't have a
[1:41:47] church without it right so remember
[1:41:50] speaking in tongues I got six things we
[1:41:52] know tongues isn't the evidence but I'll
[1:41:54] skip those but in the book that's coming
[1:41:58] out Lord willing if God will help me the
[1:42:02] sixth reason that tongues aren't the
[1:42:04] Holy Ghost is because Jesus told us what
[1:42:06] the real evidence of the Holy Ghost was
[1:42:08] and he says the Holy Ghost
[1:42:11] he shall teach you all things and bring
[1:42:13] all things to your remembrance that's in
[1:42:16] John 14:26 John 16:13 howbeit when he
[1:42:23] the Spirit of Truth has come he'll guide
[1:42:25] you into all truth he shall not speak of
[1:42:27] himself but whatsoever he hears that
[1:42:30] shall he speak and he will show you
[1:42:32] things to come see the evidence you're a
[1:42:35] child of God but have says that you can
[1:42:37] be taught the the Word of God from your
[1:42:39] father that's in John 6:45 it is written
[1:42:46] in the prophets and they shall all be
[1:42:48] taught of God every man therefore that
[1:42:50] hath heard and hath learned of the
[1:42:52] Father cometh unto me so see when we get
[1:42:56] message people that hang on the message
[1:42:58] but they never learned how to serve God
[1:43:00] better it shows they're not born again
[1:43:02] because Jesus had teach them to observe
[1:43:06] all that I command you they gotta have
[1:43:10] supernatural yes they got to have some
[1:43:12] miracle some something supernatural some
[1:43:14] vision or something they got to magnify
[1:43:15] God but after that they got to learn to
[1:43:18] be taught all the word and that's why I
[1:43:23] know it's the evidence because most
[1:43:24] people don't like that most people don't
[1:43:26] like to be taught the word then they got
[1:43:28] apologize and they gotta say they're
[1:43:29] sorry but most people if they're not
[1:43:31] born again they don't want to apologize
[1:43:33] okay
[1:43:39] the Bible said sinners will increase
[1:43:42] unto more and more ungodliness that ii
[1:43:46] corinthians 2:16
[1:43:47] paul said evil men and seducers or wax
[1:43:50] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:43:52] deceived to see church you're either
[1:43:54] going to grow one way or the other right
[1:43:56] you're going to grow in a nick
[1:43:58] witty I know I should be doing this my
[1:44:00] it's too long I need to get right with
[1:44:01] God but you keep saying that over and
[1:44:03] over you're gonna grow thatwe are gonna
[1:44:05] grow up into him into all things even
[1:44:09] Christ see we're growing one way or the
[1:44:14] other now there might be an argument
[1:44:16] where you say the foolish virgin just
[1:44:18] has a stalemate and I believe that might
[1:44:19] be true because see she's a virgin she
[1:44:21] doesn't interact she doesn't worship and
[1:44:23] have intercourse with the world and it's
[1:44:25] idols she just stays virgin but she
[1:44:29] never goes into the Holies of Holies as
[1:44:31] we heard last Saturday right to have
[1:44:34] relationship with Christ amen of Christ
[1:44:37] in part is life into their souls praise
[1:44:40] God so that I think there can be
[1:44:43] something said for that that's something
[1:44:44] I have to study out a little more by
[1:44:46] God's grace
[1:44:52] okay last things here last things I have
[1:44:56] seven quick scriptures one more evidence
[1:44:59] you're born again the notice evidences
[1:45:01] brother BAM said there's no certain
[1:45:02] evidence the evidence is you believe all
[1:45:04] the word not let you said there's no
[1:45:08] certain evidence he said you just
[1:45:09] believe all the word and you live all
[1:45:11] the word here's the next evidence John
[1:45:13] 13:35 by this shall all men know that
[1:45:16] you're my disciples if you have love one
[1:45:19] to another
[1:45:23] now remember brilli love is the step
[1:45:25] before the baptism Holy Ghost so when
[1:45:28] you see people that can't love other
[1:45:29] people they hate people they badmouth
[1:45:32] people they lie against people now how
[1:45:36] can they have brotherly love even
[1:45:37] brotherly love let alone the Holy Ghost
[1:45:40] but then when you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:45:41] have the fruit of love it's mature love
[1:45:44] right it's ripe love it's it's seasoned
[1:45:47] it's been brought forth it shines it's
[1:45:50] it's beautiful print like we had some
[1:45:52] shiny strawberries yesterday they were
[1:45:53] all they were ripe I'll tell you I was
[1:45:55] like man that's the color red right
[1:45:57] there that's glorious that's how the
[1:45:59] your love should be praise God people
[1:46:02] should see my that's that's weathered
[1:46:04] fruit that that fruit is ripe but just
[1:46:06] delicious that's how a Christian should
[1:46:09] act that's
[1:46:12] more evidence you have to love he said
[1:46:14] you'll know my disciples cuz they love
[1:46:15] one another second they'll have
[1:46:19] supernatural signs and wonders and these
[1:46:21] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:46:23] my name they shall cast out devils speak
[1:46:26] with new tongues lay hands on the sick
[1:46:27] and they shall recover mark 16 third
[1:46:31] they'll remember Jesus's words jesus
[1:46:34] said the Holy Ghost shall bring all
[1:46:36] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:46:38] said unto you fourth they here's here's
[1:46:43] one thing I like to church testifying
[1:46:46] and glorifying Jesus Jesus said the
[1:46:51] Spirit of Truth he shall testify of me
[1:46:53] and he shall glorify me let me share
[1:46:58] this brother hope this okay do you
[1:47:00] remember when we had the testimony
[1:47:01] services a few years ago up here we had
[1:47:04] some people that testified up here and
[1:47:07] if you listen to their testimony closely
[1:47:09] they never talked about the cross or any
[1:47:12] supernatural you probably know what I'm
[1:47:15] talking about and they've since left the
[1:47:17] message listen to people's testimony
[1:47:20] Church Jesus said if you got the Holy
[1:47:21] Ghost
[1:47:22] it'll testify of me re amen see there's
[1:47:29] some people that can testify facts
[1:47:31] there's other people that can testify of
[1:47:33] supernatural Holy Ghost power praise God
[1:47:37] and like I said there's been preachers
[1:47:40] we had up here that I've left the
[1:47:41] message now what happened in their
[1:47:43] testimony they didn't have the right
[1:47:46] testimony see that's one of the
[1:47:49] evidences you're born again you will
[1:47:50] testify of Jesus Christ in all things he
[1:47:53] helped you as you get saved you sanctify
[1:47:56] you food with all the ghosts he's
[1:47:57] helping you all throughout your life
[1:47:58] constant testimonies of God's grace hey
[1:48:01] man thank you lord
[1:48:03] almost done he will here's another
[1:48:06] evidence he'll convict you of your sin
[1:48:08] and you'll overcome sin John 16:8 jesus
[1:48:13] said the Holy Spirit will reprove the
[1:48:15] world of sin that means convict and then
[1:48:19] first John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of
[1:48:23] God overcomes the world
[1:48:25] glory program says that the church age
[1:48:28] book he said if you're an overcomer
[1:48:30] you gotta overcome now praise God you
[1:48:34] always said the only way you're no
[1:48:36] you're an overcomer is if you're
[1:48:37] overcoming right now
[1:48:40] thank the Lord my just oh it's so good
[1:48:43] it thank the Lord
[1:48:44] oh I believe I'm one of them praise God
[1:48:47] God helps me overcome my battles in life
[1:48:51] I repent of them I say I'm sorry and God
[1:48:54] helps me overcome the next time six you
[1:48:58] will know future events Jesus said the
[1:49:02] Spirit of Truth will show you things to
[1:49:04] come he'll show us things to come
[1:49:08] like I've made a whole video on that
[1:49:10] that's one of my most popular videos
[1:49:11] right now is thus saith the Lord future
[1:49:13] prophecies William Branham God has let
[1:49:15] us know all these things as to come and
[1:49:19] remember we knew the coronavirus because
[1:49:21] now I didn't predict it but we
[1:49:22] identified in the scripture Jesus
[1:49:24] foretold pestilences will come but it's
[1:49:27] the beginning of Sorrows that's right in
[1:49:30] Scripture
[1:49:31] same thing with h1n1 they're all
[1:49:33] beginning of Sorrows or the ending of
[1:49:35] Sorrows and last one that's into our
[1:49:37] feet here's the another evidence you
[1:49:40] listen to and believe the human
[1:49:43] preachers God sends to you in your
[1:49:46] lifetime that's another evidence you got
[1:49:49] the Holy Ghost because Jesus Christ said
[1:49:53] neither pray I for these alone but for
[1:49:56] them also which shall believe on me
[1:49:58] through their word and that they all may
[1:50:02] be one see that Christians have a
[1:50:06] oneness real Holy Ghost field Saints
[1:50:08] will have a oneness with William Branham
[1:50:09] if he was God's prophet we know he was
[1:50:14] now has a oneness there there are other
[1:50:17] preachers in the message that preach the
[1:50:18] truth whoever oneness I'm glad I got a
[1:50:20] oneness with cam and Isaiah and all the
[1:50:22] saints you know I am you got to have
[1:50:24] that that's one of the evidences you're
[1:50:26] born again
[1:50:34] and I hope this was helpful by God's
[1:50:35] grace I just felt led to the Holy Spirit
[1:50:37] to go back here and let's invite our
[1:50:41] musicians to come if you have a song
[1:50:43] with it
[1:50:43] okay wonderful just play that song here
[1:50:48] I'm today I was preaching to the soul I
[1:50:51] was preaching to the very depths of your
[1:50:53] being how many believe that when we talk
[1:50:56] about the Holy Ghost baptism I'm
[1:50:57] preaching as deep as I can go I can't go
[1:50:59] any deeper than that I'm not just
[1:51:02] talking about all you need to you need
[1:51:03] to wear more modest clothes looks a
[1:51:05] little too tight that's on the outside
[1:51:06] right I mean I just talk about mind
[1:51:08] battles here I'm talking about the soul
[1:51:11] is Jesus Christ spirit is it quicken
[1:51:14] your soul can you look down at your
[1:51:16] nature and say my nature's been
[1:51:19] quickened my soul's been filled my
[1:51:21] soul's been sealed amen my soul's been
[1:51:24] circumcised they met all these
[1:51:25] descriptions of it's all the one the
[1:51:28] same my soul the very my very I'll said
[1:51:32] I this the heart of my heart is God's
[1:51:34] presence God has come and lived upon the
[1:51:39] throne of my heart and every now and
[1:51:43] then glory that Holy Ghost comes on me
[1:51:47] on a great way again and I boohoo and

[1:52:30] time as they become more clear to you
[1:52:31] all the time I don't watch you but as
[1:52:33] these more people fall away all the time
[1:52:34] it should become more clear to me that
[1:52:36] we've got it right not because of me but
[1:52:39] because the Holy Spirit people majored
[1:52:44] on this major on that man and majored on
[1:52:46] that got a major on Christ if people
[1:52:50] born again when they're born again Jesus

[1:52:59] to be witnesses unto Jerusalem Judea and
[1:53:03] the uttermost parts of the world

[1:53:45] but to overcome them proving there's a
[1:53:47] seat for us all the throne ready for
[1:53:53] Jesus help us to live all that word
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:54:00] and overcome our contentions with our
[1:54:03] flesh and let's admit we're all when
[1:54:05] we're all gonna say we're sorry when we
[1:54:07] make a mistake let us be convicted and
[1:54:10] let us be overcomers I pray a special
[1:54:14] prayer for the children that came up
[1:54:15] there all the ghosts God that through
[1:54:17] these sermons they would truly know
[1:54:19] where they stand

[1:54:43] Lord fill them with my prayers Lord

[1:54:59] leaders were the ones that children are
[1:55:01] looking at may our lives so testify of
[1:55:04] Christ that the children can see that we
[1:55:06] are parted and if now may we cry out to
[1:55:09] God may we be desperate and may we get
[1:55:12] born again that will be you have power
[1:55:14] to be witnesses that we can be taught
