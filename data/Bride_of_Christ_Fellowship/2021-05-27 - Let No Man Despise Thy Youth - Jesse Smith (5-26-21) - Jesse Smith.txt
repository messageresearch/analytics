preach a little different kind of thought tonight uh you know we have a we're having a youth service on saturday night so i kind of want to preach a little thought to the youth i want to kind of preach it here first i always like to preach my sermons here first and then uh preach them there brother cams saturday night we'll do you service and sunday morning just one service there so i'd like to go to first timothy four let's let's look at this thought i just want to take this thought let no man despise thy youth i just want to look at that just a general thought kind of to the youth this evening by god's grace so first timothy 4 verse 12 then we'll read our memory verse for may hmm first timothy 4 12. let's read that together just that one verse with uh plenty time tonight so we won't be in a rush or anything like that read that one verse and we'll read our memory verse for this month let's read that together on three one two three let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity notice he listed six areas of a young man's life i thought that was really striking sixes the number of anointed man or fallen man right there's six pieces of armor and the full armor of god so it's very interesting the holy spirit led paul to name six areas of a young man's life let's go to psalm 19 verse 13. praise god psalms 1 i'm sorry psalms 19 verse 13 sorry all right let's read verses 13 and 14 and may the holy spirit write this upon our hearts by god's grace the words of our mouth the meditation of our heart be acceptable in this god's sight verse 13 let's begin on three one two three keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh lord my strength and my redeemer let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart tonight let's ask the lord to minister to us here we surely need god's grace uh tonight so let's go before the lord here heavenly father god we love you we bless your holy name lord we love you because you first loved us lord god we're just returning back lord are our humble expressions of love oh lord we know your love is unchanging your love uh is eternal father you loved us before the foundation of the world wrote our names on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world we recognize it here tonight that you loved us with this eternal love and lord we want to return our love to you father lord we want to take expression lord from this the scripture we're going to express this word lord god we want to uh be examples lord god and we want to lord live a life that's worthy of the gospel lord jesus so i pray you'd help us tonight father as we preach to the youth and lord imagine we're all young here tonight with me being the oldest lord uh i pray lord jesus you'd speak to every heart and prepare us for this weekend lord the ministry and also brother keith coming in lord just prepare our hearts for a wonderful weekend guide me by the holy spirit lord god may you speak words of life to us in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seen to praise god all right so let's look to the scripture here let no man despise thy youth uh the same idea be thou an example look at this for a few moments here as i said i would like to uh you know start i've been directing my thoughts i've been writing down some different thoughts about preaching to the youth here this weekend and so i just want to kind of get this uh thought out and hope to be a blessing to you uh let's let's go back to first timothy four and i think i'll just background a little bit you can kind of get the context of this verse from first timothy 4. remember this book is a paul's first letter there to timothy it was his second to last letter he wrote before he was martyred right at the end of his life second timothy was actually the last letter he wrote and so remember this is the book of uh he warns about false teachers in chapter one how christ came to save sinners and and he was an example a pattern of how people would be saved you know blasphemers could be saved right the wretched the the the worst of all sinners could be saved paul was the example of that in chapter two that's the famous chapter for praying for the government right and then also women wearing modest clothing that's a good one chapter two and why women aren't called to preach chapter two then he shows how men are called to preach but they have to meet requirements uh bishop requirements deacon requirements in chapter three and he ends chapter three with the mystery of godliness which we believe i believe is the statue of a perfect man because god was manifest in the flesh and christ is the mystery of godliness in other words he shows us how to be godly uh god restored uh godliness to man through christ jesus and we live through the spirit of jesus christ we follow his example that's the chapter three now chapter four is where we pick up this is kind of where paul you know he has i think a couple more chapters here i think two more chapters yeah to deal with uh timothy uh and as we start reading here i've listened and read a few things timothy's either in his early 30s or he's about 40 years old so uh the ones i read said he probably got saved around 16 through paul's ministry that's why paul would call him my son so he's probably 30 so this is maybe 15 or 20 years after timothy was saved through paul's ministry timothy being a very instrumental part of paul's ministry and just learning how learning from him as a son would a father just being around him constantly kind of like the elisha and elijah type right uh or a disciple or a master and a disciple right just learning right there following along in his ministry but uh so i might say uh this scripture could apply to me i'm still 40. i'm 40 right so i could although i think i'm old or maybe joke around that i'm old i guess i would be a youth according to the scripture let no man despise your youth so paul was uh paul was speaking to timothy here as a young man but i want to just i want to just read through this chapter verse 1 and i want to go down to verse 12 to kind of get you to see some of the background i mentioned some of it in the earlier chapters but i want to just read through it here verse 1 says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils okay so we know uh we we know this is of course fulfilled today uh later paul or paul tells the thessalonians i can church i'm sorry earlier paul told the thessalon thessalonican church he said that many would depart from the faith so we see this was something paul was constantly writing about that there was going to be a great falling away remember he said that in second thessalonians chapter 2 and they would take doctrines of devils so that means devils have teachings right devils have instruction and it will never lead you to righteousness it would always lead you to unrighteousness there's doctrines that specifically come from devils right now doctrine means instruction it's actually telling you what to do right i heard a good thought i thought it was an interesting thought teaching is telling you what to do preaching is urging you to do it i thought that was a good thought and you know doctrine and teaching is telling this is how it happens but then preaching is urging you maybe rebuking you right putting a great burden on you to do it i thought that was a good a good illustration good way to say it uh because we have to have both we have to have preaching and teaching right so uh there are devils that are teaching devilish instruction in other words they're telling you the wrong steps right and we've been mentioning it you know with our false teachers we looked at false preachers last month how they'll instruct people to marry a second time or marry a third time that's a doctrine of a devil right that's a doctrine of a devil okay uh it's okay to allow tv shows and all kinds of evil things in your home that's a doctrine of a devil right so a lot of these things can be easily picked up on now verse two he starts getting into a few examples that were affecting timothy verse two speaking lies in hypocrisy so hypocritical lies having their conscience seared with a hot iron so these people can no longer feel the effects of false doctrine a church i don't want to get to that spot i always want to have a sensitivity to false doctrine like that buzzer we talked about brother brown said that you got buzzers there to protect your life but if if people keep sinning and keep accepting false doctrine that buzzer they'll stop hearing the buzzer right because the bible says their conscience is seared no more feeling they can't feel that anymore they don't have a sensitivity to the holy spirit i always want to be sensitive to the holy spirit where i'll be able to detect a lie i'll be able to detect if a preacher is maybe uh if i could just say like this if a preacher's got a complex they're really preaching hard on somebody and they're not really trying to help people they're trying to bash people right i'm guilty of that i've done that in the past because i've had complexes in the past i've asked the lord to forgive me you know preachers are human preachers are fallible but they still need to be sensitive to correction by the holy spirit right so that's the point i want to make here that paul was telling timothy demons have doctrine demons have steps they take in order to get the wrong result right they want to get the main result they want is iniquity because we talked about that workers of iniquity that's the main result demons want they want to instruct people so they remain enslaved in in pleasure right and the pleasures of sin for a season the bible says so that's where a devilish doctrine will take someone into total deception into sin now verse three forbidding to mary so this was a demon lie that was coming through uh local preachers that timothy was battling timothy's a young preacher so some preachers were forbidding people to marry and paul said that's a hypocritical lie that's a doctrine of a devil oh the rapture is soon to come and don't bother getting married that's a lie right that's a lie commanding to abstain from meat you can't eat meat you got to be a vegetarian that's a lie which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received for thanksgiving for sanctified by the word of god and prayers this was a big deal remember diet was a big deal in those days because they were coming out of judaism where they had a very strict diet into oh now you have all these liberties now you can eat this type of food it was a big deal so demons demons knew that was a big deal in that day so demons tried to anoint people to kind of get some of those ideas back right in other words to bring legalism back into the word and back into grace and so a doctrine of a devil would do that they tried to bring legalism back into grace but paul has to tell them watch out for those guys that say you can't eat meat watch out for those guys watch out for those guys that say you can't marry right you got to be single to the rapture so he has to correct them now verse 6 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things now look at that that was the big trial that day marriage and then diet and that was a trial that they had to overcome the church what about our trials lebron tells us the pleasures of riches laziness and worldliness right now i may have misquoted that a little bit from the church age book oh soft live easy living soft living riches and cares of this world that's what we've got to overcome right so in other words the laodicean church age that's what we've got to overcome but in those days it was your diet you you know the devil would really try to get people on diet you really try to get them on you need to remain single to the rapture and you you you just you got to overcome those passions and you can't marry you know but paul said the opposite if you burn you should marry look at the wisdom of god on paul there but then paul said well i'd i'd have you you know to know that my gift is i could be single i don't know i don't have that problem right but the the devil was working in a false doctrine to get people to you know think they were more holy because of their diet or things they couldn't marry because the rapture is too close he said but you must you must be put them in remembrance and let's finish verse six thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ and nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained in other words the preacher has to attain good living first or holy living first and then he can bring the people up to that type of lifestyle praise god now let's look at the word nurse nourish means to educate or so when you educate i'm sure you know you do a little at a time right it's just one day at a time one one little lesson at a time until you nurse them and educate them that's amazing for me to see how like some of my children like you know haven and working on like addition and multiplication but then lydia's back there doing chemistry you know it's just it's kind of like mind-boggling to me to remember that oh yeah lydia used to do that but but educating one day at a time takes you up to the spot where you can do chemistry and logic and latin and all kinds of things that lydia's smarter than me when it comes to those things that's that's nourishing right just a little bit of food a day is going to build up a pretty big child right a little bit of knowledge a day is going to bring up a pretty smart person right if you read the right books right if you read the right books pretty soon a little bit more difficult each day pretty soon they got a pretty good educated child right or you say young person well that's what the bible says the preacher does he gives you a little bit of nourishment a little bit builds you up uh in words of faith and doctrine he builds you up slowly that's why i like preaching through books of the bible right now sometimes i'll just jump like like this one i'm just jumping from one place to another but like preaching all the way through philippians or all the way through ephesians or like i did years ago i went all the way through daniel when we first got in here i went through all the way through the whole book of daniel i preached that whole book i like to just nourish you up a little bit at a time right we preached the whole way through the book of revelation a couple years ago right just nourishing just building you up and now a lot and when we do that church we find that we're able to grow a lot right and then when someone brings a scripture out of revelation like i just saw this week oh yeah somebody tried to say uh a false doctrine about brother branham that said uh the blood moons have already taken place and they they they play a quote by brother branham and they they misquote brother branham but we know because we've gone through the seals that the blood moons don't happen until the sixth seal in other words here's a here's a message believer and they're so they're so unnourished in the word of god they're so immature they don't they haven't even read and studied enough to know that the blood moons don't happen until the sixth seal until the tribulation in other words we won't see it because we'll be in the rapture praise god amen and they're and they're actually the title of the youtube video was that the blood moons has already been prophesied and fulfilled and that's nonsense because we know what the sixth seal says the sixth seal says the moons will turn to blood right and the sun won't give us light anymore i mean there's and then that was given thus saith the lord brother adam gives us the seals with thus saith the lord so what i'm saying is that god see when we when we follow god's way of slowly going through the books and teaching all the word of god and nourishing strengthening up you become a pretty solid christian and there's those devils are going to have a hard time deceiving you on some of these issues that don't mean we're we're free from battles we have a battles in other ways but we should be mature and the bible says we should grow up and attain unto faith and good doctrine praise god and paul said timothy you'll be a good preacher if you can build the people up this way that's what i want to be verse 7 but refuse profane and old wives fables in other words don't preach people's feelings preach the word and exercise thyself rather unto godliness so we don't want to be fables which is a tale or a fiction or a myth right we're not interested in old wives fables and tales we want to be exercised we want to devote our minds to godliness right to living holy praise god we don't want to see how loose we can be we want to see how holy we can live amen that's exercise now so we're either exiting ourselves with fiction or with holiness right that's why we got to be careful what especially as we get older what kind of books we read right or what kind of videos we watch because any fiction video anything that's fiction got to be very careful right because that could take you into thoughts that don't pertain to godliness right that's what he says right there okay so but you have to be exercised into godly things so as we come we become more mature in christ we got to be more interested in holiness how can i live a whole life how can i pray more how can i learn more about god right how can i how can i be a better witness like these are the things we want to be how can i be more patient right how can i be more loving how can i be uh how can i memorize more scripture right these are issues that that we should be interested in praise god not fiction tales right but the reality of gospel the gospel the fact that we're going to heaven and we want to be ready to go to heaven when jesus returns amen verse 8 for bodily exercise profiteth little so see there's only a little uh benefit for keeping your body healthy but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and that which is to come may i just inject though see people will say this you know body exercise profits little but then today people get they look at that and they say well i don't have to work out or i don't have to exercise my body and they get really lazy and unhealthy because they'll eat too much ice cream right or they'll drink too much pop right which basically is asking for cancer right if you want cancer drink a lot of pop i mean diet or not diet that you're going to get you're pretty prone to get cancer right but see they'll take that and they'll they won't have the right balance with that right they won't remember that in bible days everybody worked hard if you didn't work hard you didn't eat hello you couldn't sit back and do nothing that's what paul said if they don't work they don't eat and so you had to be a hard worker right you had to the bible said be fervent in business paul said don't be a slawful lazy person be fervent in other words be the best you can praise god i had a parent write me a note today and they just you know tomorrow's the last day of school so they wrote me a note and said they said my daughter comes home and she says all this about you she says you truly found your calling in life you were born to be a teacher i thought well praise the lord i thank you lord i just in other words i just want to be the best i can be right i want to do what god's called me to do i don't want to try to impersonate somebody else i just want to be what god's called me to be right so that gave me a little bit of encouragement today uh to be the best i can be at what i'm doing and try to find the will of god but he said so see we don't want to uh we don't let our bodies go we but we but we can't we can't overemphasize the body right uh we have to but we have to exercise ourselves unto godliness and you'll see the blessings of of that right now and in the future and in heaven of things to come praise god so we'll see blessings now if we live godly and blessings to come praise the lord verse 9. this is a faithful saying and worthy of all ex acceptation uh that means yeah okay that they don't give a different definition verse 10 for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god so paul's telling timothy we are being reproached which means railed at taunted upbraided defamed so people are mocking us that's what paul says because when we live a godly life people are going to mock us right people are going to make fun of us right that's what he's saying here we labor and we suffer mocking right we suffer this reproach because we trust in the living god who's the savior of all men especially of those that believe now you can see in america and on the news right now there's a lot of anti-semitism right a lot of people are glad the jews were being bombed you see that in the liberal media not the conservative but the liberal media they're actually rejoicing that jews are dying well that same idea is going to come to christians before the rapture right because they're going to change the laws to kill anybody that disagrees with the beast right the roman catholic church so you can see it growing i i'm just 40. i've never seen anti-semitism so so public before this is the worst i've ever seen it where p you know the liberals and the democrats actually rejoicing that jews are dying that's god's covenant people right but that's under the noah or sorry the moses covenant we're the new covenant people so you know it's gonna if it's on them it's gonna come to us right eventually we don't know if it'll be in our lifetime or the next generation or the next we don't know but we if we see it growing now on the jews then it's gonna grow on us as well so i'm at we imagine that's only going to increase right it's only going to increase the hatred well that's what paul said paul said they're suffering reproach and we know for us it's only going to grow now i feel like this i feel blessed too because i feel like god's kind of he's going to hide us under the shadow of his wing right now right we're in america we're an actor we got a real small church most of our lives are pretty wonderful right so i feel i'm just saying i'm just thanking the lord i feel very protected right now so i thank the lord for that but that may not always be that way right it might not always be that way and we have to have job's faith the lord gives the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord if the lord would take away our covering of protection we have to suffer more reproach or physical violence or someone tried to hurt us or something like that we'd have to stand there with the love of jesus christ and we have to be a real christian we have to bear some more reproach right because right now we just get reproached from family right family friends maybe but it's light compared to like being beaten or shot at or something like paul like the sword right or daley being robbed like he had to suffer right robbers and all the evil men and all kinds of things so we got to keep that in mind and i'm trying to get to the young people i just i i guess i didn't realize i'm stopping so much but he's telling timothy you're suffering reproach right because we trust in the living god he's the savior of all men especially of them that believe in other words he's able to save all men but especially those who believe are mainly those that believe right now verse 11 these things command and teach can you pull that up there these things command and teach that's verse 11. thanks lydia now what was the last time you heard your church friend say oh we got good commands at church today the preacher commanded me to do something now who would like who's ever said that right but paul says to timothy these things command and teach right oh that guy's uh he's on an ego trip he's given us commands no we're giving commands from the lord jesus christ we're giving we're giving ways to eternal life right we're giving wisdom to eternal life we're commanding the people of god to obey the word of god right commanding and teaching i'll say like this i've got a right to command the word of god as long as i live it amen hallelujah praise god that's why i've got the right i've got the right to command those brothers and our sisters if you can't handle a cell phone i've got the right to command you to give it up and get rid of it if you can't handle it because i'm living it i'm not a slave to it right i'm not i'm not addicted to these things like so many people are and they're trapped in sin i've got a right to command it because i never ask anybody to live higher or to do something that i'm not already doing praise god i've got a right to command people to obey the word of god if i'm obeying it because he said don't let no man despise your youth and i'm young at least according to paul that's right let no man despise thy youth that's verse 12. so we have to command and teach these things to live a sound doctrine write don't give heed to lies and uh doctrines of devils we must command people that's why i've commanded people uh don't mix with those jeffersonville people i've commanded people to do that but some of them didn't believe me right because that's a seducing spirit it's getting them in the spirit of idolatry and it breaks the word of god now i'm up to 10 false doctrines that i've been sharing with people they've got 10 false doctrines up to this point and when people actually hear the the the relatives of the prophet say some of those things they're blown away they are and it just keeps building went from seven eight nine now i've got ten that's a spirit that's a doctrine of a devil and i've got a right to command people to stay away from it right because they'll start worshipping a man instead of jesus christ okay now now here's where i want to get to after all those what was that 20 minutes i didn't mean to say that long on it verse 12 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity now i'm going to get back to this scripture but paul tells timothy don't let anyone despise you because you're young see in those days it was very respectful to be an older person it's flipped right today most people no not amongst christians but amongst worldly people it's flip now the cool people are the young people right who's the most who's the most popular people on twitter oh it's the young female singers right or the handsome young guy who sings the new song like we're looking at the other week at the most youtube views ever and it was this spanish guy who sings about being desperate for love he's got like five billion views on one of his songs like that like what wisdom what good is that song ever doing anybody nothing it's just it's getting them probably stds and uh abortions and that's probably probably what it's doing right but that's what the world exalts and they probably did in that day too but paul says but real wisdom is found in in age if you're sincere remember they asked brother brown brother they said brother brown if you could live one of the quarters of a hundred years which one would it be zero to twenty-five lebron said if i was an athlete it'd be zero to twenty-five he said if i was a young parent be twenty-five to fifty he said but i would choose from 75 to 100. he said because i know more about it he said i'd be able to use my energy the right way i know more answers he said if i could choose any of those quarters you know 50 to 75 uh 75 to 50 i'd choose 75 to 100 brother graham said that if i was guaranteed 25 years on this earth which years would i want the most from 75 to 100 church most of us aren't even halfway there right that would be his choice because he said i no more i have the wisdom of god what's the one principle thing that we should seek in this life the wisdom of god amen but paul says don't let anyone even though you're not old don't let anyone despise your youth now verse 13 how you can do this so for our young people how we can do this and all of us right we're all young now of course this is for ministers right but the bible says we should all be followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises okay so verse 13 until i come you have attendance to reading now that's actually reading so church we need to be reading god the bible right and message books and you can read my book because i'm your pastor and the ones that come out hopefully soon i've heard from my guy for a while but read to exhortation exhortation means comfort or entreaty so comfort so read a lot comfort people and then doctrine instruction so how can you be an example to someone the bible says read a lot glad we got some readers in here exhort comfort people so in other words look for people who are hurting and try to minister to them like we said on sunday right minister to someone and then doctrine now this is for preachers of course but we are we should all be interested in doctrine instruction now verse 14 now church this applies to everybody neglect not the gift that is in thee because jesus said everybody's got at least one talent amen some two some five so even though this is spoken to a preacher everybody can do something here so this is the way to be an example focus on your gift don't ignore your gift but focus on your gift listen to what people have said well i really enjoyed how you do this or why i really felt god when you did this and oh my i was really blessed when you did this or did that look and see how god has gifted you and don't avoid that but devote yourself to it right like how did anna how did anna the prophetess eventually see jesus you know the baby the bible said she prayed and fasted and then she saw the she saw the prophecy of jesus come to pass so see she was devoted she didn't neglect her gift she prayed and fasted and ministered to the lord and prayed in the temple praise god hallelujah so that's how you do it you just got to focus on that and and consecrate your body right consecrate your mind focus on reading and and studying the word of god and loving god worshiping god and being fasting praying and then god will bless your talents because that's what the bible says which was given me by the prophecy with the laying on the hands of the presbyter presbytery so no doubt timothy you know they were they must have been laying the hands on timothy and some people prophesied and said thus saith the lord you've got a gift of teaching or you've got a gift to be a pastor because he was a pastor this time in ephesus thus saith the lord you're going to be the pastor in ephesus you know he had so paul reminds him you've got prophecy over your life but just because you got prophecy doesn't mean you can sit back and be lazy you've got to you've got to focus on that gift and give yourself completely to it praise god you're a young man don't waste those young years use those years focused on what god has placed in your life amen verse 15 meditate upon these things so think about all the things god has placed in your life meditate upon them meditate that's our memory verse for this month right it means revolve in your mind revolve it in your mind over and over go over that again give thyself holy to them so how many want to make the most of your youth find out what god has blessed your life with like sister you might have divine healing because remember when you prayed for your uh your hubby there and god anointed you and you so the testimony was amen woke up sick right and you just laid your hand on him and your your hand went numb right your arm went numb is that right is that about right in a dream that's right did did he feel the numbness or did you feel it i felt it whether his brother amen said he was instantly healed that might be a gift of uh healing in your life and so that's just i just kind of came to me because i was looking at you you know i'm just trying to think of the things give yourself holy to them in other words uh just say lord if you want to if you want me to pray for somebody here i'm i'm going to focus on that i'm going to remember the scriptures i'm going to i'm going to build up faith in case someone needs prayer today praise god see that your profiting may appear to all because we can all see how the saints have grown in our congregation right we talk about that our family talks about all the time we've seen growth in our sisters and and the saints all the saints that come faithfully we've seen growth in their lives right i hope you've seen it in my life if not something's wrong but i believe i've grown i just don't think about it very much but see we meditate we give ourselves and then everybody sees the prophet on your life or the advancement is a better word everybody sees you advance in faith amen everybody sees you advance in faith in entrusting god and confidence in the word of god amen not getting weaker not falling back but raising higher amen going from glory to a higher glory amen going from a faith to a higher faith praise god amen that's how you do it you focus on what you know god has placed in your life you focus on that read on that devote yourself to that and then everybody will see when god blesses your life everybody will see that verse 16 take keen unto thyself and unto the doctrine that's what uh what a recommendation take heed to yourself what's he mean it means to retain it means to mark mark yourself and unto the under look at your life and mark how you've been doing right take a real inventory of your life what kind of christian am i living what kind of life am i living mark it look at it examine yourself right and and also mark the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save yourself and them that hear thee okay so a preacher if he meditates upon the word and gives people instruction and tells him what to do and if he meditates on that and keeps revolving around that meditating on that then that will lead to his salvation and the salvation of those that are listening to him amen church i hope one day i can stand before jesus and as a pastor i can present the whole church that all these souls were saved because i preached christ's word amen that's my desire and not because of me but the bible says the preacher is connected to the ones he's preaching to amen not only is he saved but the people are saying amen oh that's my greatest desire praise god is that i be saved and then those that hear me are saved by preaching the acceptable words of the lord amen hallelujah how do you do that you meditate on the word you just you totally focus on the word of god give yourself completely to the word of god that's what i've tried to do praise god i tried to give myself completely to the word of the lord okay so now in this context let's just take a few minutes here and i'll come back to it in just a moment i want to uh yeah i also want to advise uh just with a few scripture now go to second timothy 2 19. let's go there ii timothy 2 19. let me just give a little word of uh advice here we say i'm sorry not vice word of wisdom rather from paul to timothy second timothy 2 19. uh nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that name at the name of christ depart from iniquity okay so that's young and old right anyone who's names christ should depart from iniquity which is knowledgeable sinner sin that you're aware of anything that you're aware of any sin you should leave it verse 20. but in the great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver and of wood and of earth are some of honor and some of the dishonor let me stop right there see people will uh these people that leave the message i've been listening to some of them their podcasts they say that message people make themselves an elite group right they're in other words they're prideful and exalting themselves let me say this some people may do but a real christian who's filled with the holy ghost with the power of god in real humility is an elite person just because gold is more elite than silver so a real christian doesn't exalt himself it's god exalting him praise god or her praise god hallelujah because we can never exalt ourselves in fact all we can do is humble ourselves amen and then when we humble ourselves god exalts us praise god remember jesus said many will find the way to life no few will find the way so there is an elite group of christians a few that find that narrow road and they are gold quality yes sir there are elite christians today praise god not by their own calling or their own proclamation but by god's word so see these people that leave the message they they bash message people but the reality is the ones that are sincere they are an elite group of christians because they keep all the word of god so you know i'm not done with that yeah i'm done there now go to verse 22. here it is flee also loose i'm sorry youthful lust so see you know there's going to be lust when you're younger they're more attractive when you're younger like music and parties and not for us video games videos you know what are the youth like video you have to flee the youthful lusts drugs and feelings and popularity right when you're younger those things matter like i can remember going back to high school i just wanted everybody to like me so i do i do a lot of sinful things just for people to like me but now i could care less what people say i gotta care less what my co-worker across the hallway says i don't care what they say i don't care what they do like i don't mean nothing to me i don't feel any pressure about what they're you know that doesn't mean nothing to me like if if some of the teachers want to do that that doesn't mean nothing i'm not going to do that that doesn't bother me at all i don't care to be singled out because i know who i'm standing with i'm standing with christ praise god they're separating their self from christ i'm joining myself to christ amen i'd rather stand with jesus than the whole world praise god so see it's it's a it's a as i get older those things mean less to me i don't care what i'm i don't care what any church thinks of me or a preacher thinks to me all i care is what jesus thinks of me amen praise god now but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart so young people need to find people that are pure in heart and then they need to follow the pure in heart those that are following pure things okay so he just gives that uh he just gives that great advice there verse 23 but the foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes verse 24 the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach and patient when you see a preacher he just wants to fight and bicker and argue and fuss all the time he's probably got he's probably got a complex or he's not born again right because even when we disagree we can be gentle right so i just want to give that advice that as a young person it's best to flee unless you've got a strong anointing to stand there in the face of a youthful lust or a temptation unless you have that strong anointing where god you know god's there you should just walk away like joseph remember potiphar's wife's tugging on him said oh lie with me every day lie with me like what'd he do he just ran away right that didn't mean he was weak that showed he was strong praise god see flee the youthful lusts that shows you're strong when you're able when it's right there presented before you but you're able to turn the devil down and leave the devil right amen leave that situation get out of the situation that shows more power praise god hallelujah i was just looking at a few my notes here like i didn't have them all organized like i like to okay so uh i'm going to try to close in just a few minutes here but let me close with a few thoughts remember church god can use many young people anyone who surrendered to him samuel was just he just got done nursing and god uses him by speaking to him there at the house of the lord right and he had to use a young man samuel because the old men were committing adultery the priests were committing adultery the two sons of eli and then eli was letting it go on he was an old dodie grandpa he just let the kids sin do whatever they want and he was getting big and large he was he wasn't taking care of his body right then the bible just say that right you gotta you gotta exercise yourself to godliness right it's not godly to become overweight it's not it's not golly to become addicted to food hello that's still a devil right it's still a devil a food addiction that's a devil so god had to use a young man and speak to him through the holy spirit and even give him words of correction so much so remember that eli come up and said samuel tell me what the lord told you what did samuel do he told him look at that a young young boy wouldn't hold back on an old preacher now that's a good example of let no man despise your youth samuel was in such a condition even as a young child god could speak to him and give him words of correction for the older generation and he was still able to do it with grace may god help our young people to be like that where they're so dedicated even at a young age god can give a word god can give a dream god can give a a doctrine a revelation that it can be taught to other people praise god what a good example how about that uh little jewish maid that was a slave of naaman we like that uh we like the audio drama about that uh there's a little audio drama where a girl wants to be like that little maid but look at that she's a slave right to a heathen king but even as a young girl she's able to look past even though being mistreated being a slave she's able to say naaman i know a prophet and he might give you might get healed by going to that prophet a little girl is going to point a grown man to his healing praise god amen hallelujah a little child might be able to appoint us to repentance amen or forgiveness right or some some spiritual trait we might be lacking we might be humbled by a little child speaking the word of god and it makes us want to live that way that's what god used in that day for a man the center is not a centurion but he was a general and he was able to get healed from leprosy all because of a little girl god speaking through a little girl right we want to be vessels where god can speak through us right and people can be healed people can be helped right david was such a obedient young young man there he could write songs and praise god now shepherding is not a very it's not a very high calling right all his brothers are at the war but he's out there with the sheep they're out there you know trying to get victories and they got shield and armor and david's just got a sling and a staff that's all he's got he's got sheep to feed and he gets to pet him and he gets to feed him and he gets to hold him and but but then god gives him some great victories right he gets to fight a lion and a bear praise god you get to experience the power of god and then god gets to use him to destroy uh goliath right as a young man in other words god was telling him let no man despise your youth amen but be the example of the believers remember when he went into the camp his question was his question wasn't how great is goliath his question was what does the person get who slays this guy amen that's the example praise god right here's an example he was thinking about what does the what can i get if i have faith and defeat this fella in other words i'm i'm an overcomer i've already seen god save me from great enemies god can use me to deliver the nation of israel praise god i face very fierce people or very fierce enemies just like goliath he was thinking about the victories not about failures praise god see he just meditated on the songs of god right and the songs encouraged him right he just sang songs and played the harp and he was always in the presence of the lord he meditated on those things so he came in ready for battle praise god well everybody else was afraid and fearful and discouraged david was encouraged david was ready to overcome even as a teenager praise god ah that's striking there's 45 minutes i'm gonna try to close here david did that and then the people started singing david has killed his ten thousands and all he done was killed goliath right he might have killed a bear in a lion but not probably not ten thousand lions right but his faith was so intense right it was he was so devoted to god he had such a conviction that they attributed to him many great victories but this is an example of a young person praise god now we already went through joseph right but we never see joseph complaining even though he's thrown in the pit even though he's sold in uh you know uh to potiphar's house he never he never gave up he just kept doing his best work he kept faithfully serving god all those days right and then god raised him up he went down to the prison we never see him given up he was an example there church that's a great example right there be an example no matter where you are no matter how god how high god takes you or how low god takes you always be an example of living a righteous life we never find joseph giving in to depression or giving in to living a defeated life but he always was an example and god blessed his hands in everything that he touched praise god he was an example praise god look at mary a little teenage virgin girl and of all the people god could have chose uh to do a virgin birth by overshadowing of the holy ghost he chose mary right and now what is her what is her great attribute pondering the things of god because even after the angels spoke these things she still had to the bible said she kept them in her heart which means we can choose to keep the word in our hearts or we can choose not to keep the word in our hearts so we want to choose to keep the word in our heart the bible said she kept these things right she pondered them in her heart all the things the lord has spoken to me i'm going to keep thinking about that right all those things uh like any fresh thought you have you should keep that and ponder that in your heart like i've been thinking about a lot about how i'm strong and very courageous right like joshua i've been keeping that in my heart i'm taking land i'm not getting defeated i'm an overcomer praise god god's going to do more miracles in my ministry like i'm taking more land praise god i'm not being defeated i'm not falling back i'm pressing on into the things of god praise god i'm strong and very courageous right that's what god called me to be so we meditate on those things and remember we're the joshua army praise god we're a we're a new love praise god we're not an old love we're a new love hallelujah i'm going to get back into last sunday's message right we're not an old sinful church we're a new church we're a blood wash church amen we're an on fire church we have to remember what god said about us amen and live that amen live it see meditate on those things like mary kept thinking about it kept thinking about it and then the hebrew children they had no revelation that god was going to step with step in the fire with them god didn't tell them in advance hey i'm gonna save you from the fire they said all we know whether god saves us or not we have no revelation our only revelation is i'll not bow down i'll not become a worshiper of a man i'll only worship jehovah that's how we are church we may not know the revelation of that no man knows the revelation of the day and the hour but we we don't know if god will let us die and go to the grave or not i don't know if i'll preach some of your funerals or not or someone else will preach my funeral i don't know what god will do but will not give in to sin will not give into this laoceian world will obey god's word only amen hallelujah however many days we have how many ever years god gives us we're going to give our youth we'll give our middle age give our old age we'll give everything we have to jesus christ i like those three hebrew children they had no revelation if there was going to be a miracle or not but all's they knew they had a revelation that i am not to bow down to idols what does that show us live whatever revelation you have just live as high as the revelation that god gives you and he'll show up in great ways in your life praise god amen hallelujah now now i want to find that scripture real quick when i became a man i put away childish things was that first corinthians 13. yeah first corinthians 13 11. he put that up there real quick i'm almost done that was my 10 minutes so i'm going over my 45 now i'm going over my 55 so forgive me when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put childish things away this is speaking of love so if you've got the love of god right charity this is charity so when you've got the love of god you put away childish things that that doesn't mean you don't play with your little brothers and sisters right that's not what that means it means when you have a choice of mature things or childish things do you play angry birds or do you read your bible right hopefully my children shouldn't have angry birds on their phones or tablets if so if not i'm going to come and delete it but when i became a man when i became full of charity and divine love i put away frivolous things right go to the next verse first 12. can you go to verse 2. now we see through as a glass darkly but then face to face in other words i put away childish things because i know one day i'm gonna see jesus face to face he said i see things darkly now right now look even as a sold out christian things aren't always absolutely clear he says we see through a glass and it's kind of dark there's some things that are still a little bit you know like we're not sure about the squeeze right right we're not sure exactly what's going to happen are we going to be hunted down or not totally so we see through a glass but darkly right but he said i became a mature christian when i put away childish things and i began focusing on the most important things in life christianity christian principles godly living praise god i put away childish things so you can still be a child and have fun right and have fun with your friends but then also be mature a mature christian as well you guys ever see that picture of brother branham there's a picture of brother branham and he's out hunting and he has this coffee pot and he's going like this and they got a picture of him doing that he was making a joke so he could let off the pressure a little bit there's videos where they got him and his son they're kind of playing with each other's hat and him and billy paul pretending like they're boxing you know they you know we become a man you put away childish things but you can still laugh a little bit and have to have some jokes you know but when you have a choice between this is my time to grow am i going to choose this could be my time to to to wholly give myself to the word or am i just going to kind of waste my time in things that don't really matter well you've got to you got to realize that when you're young you got to devote that to the lord right there's times for that and as you grow as a christian you grow up more into those more mature things the holy things of god and you know why you do it because the bible says when you exercise yourself in that now you see the blessings now right you see blessings now plus you got blessings of things to come all right i'm closing with this now i'm really gonna try to close here i know you all love me i appreciate that first timothy 4 12. let's go back there i want to challenge our young people are you the example of all of these six attributes that's how i'm gonna challenge young people i kind of feel led to finish on this scripture in other words if i said i want to find an example of someone who speaks the word or says the right words yeah just this is just words speaking the word so your common words i want to find an example who could i find that they just say all the right things they're just real humble and their words are seasoned with grace i wonder who that example is which young person is it praise god because that's what he says he says you be an example don't let anybody despise you just because you're young doesn't mean you can't say the right things and say spiritual things not that you're trying to impress people but you do it out of the love of god in your heart in other words you don't want to say foolish words you don't want to uh you don't want to weaken people's faith you want to build people's faith up so are you the example young person are you the example of the words saying the right words would i would have would i be able to put your name young person is an example of saying the right words lydia acacia malcolm haven they're the example of saying the right word because that's what paul is saying be an example timothy next in conversation conversation just means your behavior wow the best behave the best behaved people i saw at the church were insert your name young person right that's what that's what paul said timothy you be the example don't let don't wait for other people to do it you be the good example you behave like a real christian ought to remember how do you get there church you gotta give yourself to reading give yourself to prayer give yourself to meditating on the word of god don't neglect the gifts in your life so malachi better maokai and liddy better bang on those pianos at home right you better bang on it you give yourself holy to it you got to if you do it everybody will see your profit everybody will see the advantages the gains you're making give yourself holy to it in charity that's love we just talked about that affection think about that who's the example of showing affection amongst the young people who really let you know that you're loved should be should be a real christian right all christians will be like that but paul challenges timothy you be the example preacher you let everybody feel your affection tell them how much you love them and why you love them thank them for what they do right show them anybody can say it but you got to act on it praise god in spirit now spirit means your disposition right so if you're down in the dumps you got a little they got a weak spirit or you gotta encourage spirit you got a strong spirit you be the example of somebody which young person is strong in the spirit they just got a lot of strength put your name in there are you that example are you what everybody should be following next one is faith well we know what faith is faith is assurance right persuasion conviction you're an example of someone who's convicted by the word of god you really trust in the word of god god's given you revelation you know what the word of god says you're an example of trust in god so when you get bad news instead of screaming and worrying about it you say well lord the lord's going to make a way somehow you're an example of that let's pray oh this awful thing happened well let's pray about it let's at least pray about it you're an example of faith is that what everyone would say about you young person you're the example of that now if you want to do it god will god will make a way for you because remember i was just we're just listening to my testimony last night uh when your dad got healed the lord woke me up at 4 15 that morning before amen called me and gave me the scripture there's power of life and death in the power of the tongue see so if we want to speak the word if we wanted if we want to be an example the lord will make a way for us to do it he'll even wake us up early to do it thank you jesus amen if you want to be an example if you really have integrity and you want to be an example for god to use god will make sure you are that example and last one is impurity let's stay in our feet impurity which is cleanness or chastity wow these these people live so clean to the message they're so clean to the bible we'd say this young person is such a clean living person they're so pure they won't mix with any of those teenagers that are doing this and that and the other they're not on tick-tock like everybody else though i'm just throwing that in there i don't have tick-tock i don't have facebook anymore i don't know but you can do facebook and still be a christian right i'm just taking my stand against facebook all right that's what the bible says you're an example of purity this is how a young person should live their life they're so clean they're so far from sinful things let no man despise your youth don't let anybody say oh well they're just young it's okay they act silly and they do these foolish things and they hang out too late at night and they they go to these certain places that's they're just young they're just sowing their wild oats you know no paul said be an example of the believers in every area of your life musicians you can come are youth musicians be an example church how many want to be an example that word actually means a stamp or a statue a stamp a statue a pattern you want to be a pattern that everybody tries to live like them you are the pattern of how to live pure what a challenge paul the prophet wants me to be the the pattern everybody looks at i say the right things i behave the right way i have a lot of love flowing out of my heart a lot of affection i have a lot of charity he says you be the pattern you're like a stamp like a seal right you're you're like a seal you are what everyone's trying to obtain to may god help us to have a church full of those can we you think that's possible a church full of examples i think it could be i think it could be because i know that first church 120 that got the holy ghost i know that was a church of examples because they were all born again amen hallelujah let's play that little song make me more like you jesus make me more like you i know i went a little longer forgive me i'd always i don't always do that but i try to preach a little shorter but i'll laugh about it when i get home tonight well let's church let's just real sincerely for a moment [Music] church we haven't been in the message very long right that doesn't mean we can't be good examples now the message there's a lot of you know there's a lot of older preachers and people really look up to them that's great but that doesn't mean that people can't look up to you you should take it as a challenge it's not me challenging you it's paul challenging you don't let people despise you the youth but be an example of the believers i don't think i've ever shared
