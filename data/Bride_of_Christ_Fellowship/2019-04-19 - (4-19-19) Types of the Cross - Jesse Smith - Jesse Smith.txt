if you're ready one two three and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up I'll read verse 15 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life verse 16 let's all read that together as well one two three for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved praise God let's have one more word of Prayer here tonight Heavenly Father what a glorious scripture Lord God one of the first ones I was ever taught to memorize John 3:16 Lord when I read it I see how Lord in the same passage you're speaking of this serpent that was lifted

god bless yous bein seated praise God like to look at this thought here tonight and trust me a blessing to you by the grace of God I love Good Friday cuz I never have to work on Good Friday and it gives me extra time in the Word of God so that's why I love this day I'm gonna switch over here and of course remember in the old rugged cross what a blessing so let's look I'll start with these thoughts on types of the cross and then I like to look at a few other thoughts that the Lord has inspired here so let's look at a few these scriptures now before we get to types of the cross let's go through and read about the cross again so let's go to Matthew 27 let's just get a little bit of refreshment how many like little refreshment on the cross praise God it sure is a blessing to go back and see what God was doing on that specific day so Matthew chapter 27 now verses 1 & 2 he's delivered to the sin or to Pilate rather and then Judas is in verse 3 to 10 he's interrogate arrogated by Pilate in verses 11 to 14 and then they choose Barabbas instead of Jesus in 15 to 25 let's pick up at verse 26 where Barabbas is released and how many remember two years ago when I preached on this where were used by the Rams quotes and mother Graham said I was that Barabbas praise God I remember that you were Barabbas you were the one that should have been crucified but Christ took your place thank God for that amen verse 26 then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourge Jesus he delivered him to be crucified verse 27 then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common Hall and gathered on him unto the whole band of so soldiers let's pick up there at verse 28 and they stripped him now remember this was pure stripping there was no cloth on him like you see in the passion movie or any crucifixion movie he was just plain stripped naked and put on him a scarlet robe when they mocked him and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews now yesterday at school we had a Bible club and it was about the cross and and one of the mothers went through all went through and made 80 packages with all these like stones like a stone representing the stone that was rolled away she put a coin represent in there how Jesus was over 30 pieces silver and she put a piece of a thorn in there off roses it's so striking to me the kids could look open up their bag and take out each one of these things represent the cross and one of the girls got cut and started bleeding from that thorn I thought my what a reminder now as awful as it is and these are just little thorns off of a beautiful rose you know just little thorns what an awful thing but what a reminder that Christ not only got one thorn he had a crown of thorns I mean I imagine that girl will remember that this year right sure her family does does attend church I imagine so remember I know what it's like to be cut by a thorn and what a reminder to to help us to think it and feel for Jesus as he was crowned with the crown of thorns not just a little bit I just won but a whole crowd man what a reality it is - to her no doubt and they mock him in verse 30 and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him that they took the robe off from him put on his own own raiment on him and led him away to be crucified and as they came out they found a man of Cyrene Simon by name him they compelled to bear the cross now let me stop right there I got some quotes on Simon Cyrene I preached on him a couple years ago we know he was from Africa Libya I'm not mistaken I got some slides down here I'm just gonna jump down here to Simon the Cyrene but notice the verse 32 as they're leading him away to be crucified they found a man of Cyrene which is modern-day Libya in Africa Simon by name him they compelled to bear the cross so he didn't want to bear the cross they had to compel him you need to carry the cross and historically it's probably because the soldiers could see his blood loss they could you know they they already scourge him they could see how weak he was already remember he was up all night getting Jews in prison and question he was that he had to go through six trials can you imagine that six trials in one night and they'd already scourge him he lost all this blood and they could tell this man cannot he cannot carry this cross and live but remember the the commission from Pilate was he's got to be crucified they couldn't let him die here before they went up to Gao Gotha because if he did then they didn't they didn't fulfill pilots requirement he had to be crucified so they they pulled somebody and say Simon you've got a you you've got to carry his cross he didn't want to do it I mean which which one of us would want to do that he didn't want to do it but they compelled him and so we learned a few things from Simon the Cyrene we learned that he was a real man if you go to mark go to mark 1521 here's a few important things we learned about Simon the Cyrene mark 1521 the script tells us here and they compel one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of Alexander and Rufus two barons cross I remember marks riding this mark wasn't there but he's riding it like Luke Mark and Luke weren't there they're just riding down the accounts they've seen and they wanted to have a witness and they had to make sure that this was written down correctly this Gospel of Mark and so notice he records even his two sons names right Alexander and Rufus because it seems like later in the scripture Peter or Paul writes a letter to the church the Christians in Rome and Rufus is one of those believers so it's almost like mark records this because Simon we don't know if Simon was saved or not but it seems like his children were saved because Paul salutes Rufus who was living in Rome so let's read that let's go to Roman's 1613 because if you were writing a letter and you wanted people to to know that these things were true you'd have to call out people that were living that at that time right you'd have till you'd write it and say well that's because Simon's sons are still living today to give proof that these people actually experienced Simon was a real man you can go talk to him he knows what it's like to carry the cross of Christ amen my Roman 1613 he said salute Rufus chosen to the Lord and his mother and mine praise God so it seems like Rufus was according to historians was a real believer he was chosen and no doubt his daddy was chosen to carry the cross now so that's that's one reason Simon is brought up because he was a real person they wouldn't know he's a real person also the second thing he's a foreigner now brother BAM said Ethiopian but it looks like from Libya Libya and he actually helped Jesus now Libya is mentioned in Acts chapter 2 verse 10 so Libya was one of those nations that heard the same speak in tongues on the day of Pentecost course in their own language amen it understood language and so Simon steps in to help the help Jesus just like the angel who came to help Jesus when he was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane to finish his calling so Jesus needed help from angel he need to angel help to do this and he needed man's help to do this praise God and I tell you this if anybody helps out a Christian if anybody helps out Jesus they have a reward amen so God is giving Simon he chose Simon to be one of the helpers to help out Christ the Messiah himself carry his cross and no doubt Simon will get a great reward for that because just like the angel came in the garden Jesus could not have done it without the help of the angel or else God would not have sent him right he needed the help of the angel and so God gave help through an angel to endure this cross remember church crucifixion was the absolute worst death it still is the worst death the person could ever go through it was perfected it wasn't it wasn't even invented yet when David wrote about the crucifixion my bone stare at me it wasn't even invented now in fact the Grecians and actually started it and and then it was perfected by the Romans and it was the worst death because she had to die naked and you had to die alone and and even Roman citizens themselves were never crucified even Rome wouldn't allow their own citizens to die by crucifixion it had to be a foreigner and they would kill these men publicly crucify them as examples to the Roman citizens and all the foreigners that you don't go against Rome and so Jesus not really being a Roman right not being he had to be killed this way and he was killed publicly and given the worst death that could possibly be given and it's the worst death also because you have to die alone all the other deaths if they cut your head off it's a human that does it right or if they spear you or whatever they do another human caused you to die but when you're crucified you die from your own self you get so tired you get so uh your diaphragm collapses and you're just trying to get a breath you have to die alone it's the absolute work that worse death if somebody could ever suffer and Jesus needed angel help to do it amen oh they do Yeah right he was the suffering Savior hallelujah he was willing he knew as a heaven brother amen he knew he but he's the Bible said he did it for the joy that was set before him and he did it through great crying's and tears no doubt if Jesus was around there Jerusalem there he would have seen people crucified they would have seen it was part of their everyday life and that's why the the historians the the the Gospel writers they don't put a lot of details about crucifixion in their Gospels because the people knew about it it was very familiar they didn't need to but now we need to go back and see and people examine it so we could understand how awful was it because we it's not acceptable in our society but Jesus prayed so desperately let's go to Hebrews five seven through nine and I read one place where people could live that were crucified four days can you imagine four days walking past the same person died just getting weaker it depends what if they were in good physical health and then their scourging wasn't that bad they could live for days just dying and people and it was other people's job the Roman government encouraged Romans to walk by and mock them and spit on them and make fun of them and hit them it was all part of the Roman society to try to curb violence and crime it was all meant to do that and so can you imagine as a child of your four days you walked by this man day-in day-out and then the animals wild animals would jump up and kill them and what brains was flying and pluck at them and because they're dying I mean it just it's the absolute worst it's the lowest disrespect you could ever give to a person yet jesus knew what he had to do and he did it Church for you and I amen Hebrews five seven nine in the days as flesh we need to offer to prayers and supplications with strong crying in tears unto him that was able to save from death and was heard and that he feared so God heard his strong crying's and his groaning he knew every he knew he'd seen people crucified he knew the awful pain he was going to have to suffer but he's willing to do it for the joy that was set before him for though he were a son yet he learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him amen see strong crying tears he say help me God and God sends an angel and helps him amen hallelujah God sends the angel gives enough strength to go through the trial trials all night the imprisonment the the scourging the beating the whipping the spitting the hitting on the head gives him the strength to make it through there and just when he's ready to die God allows Simon compels him pulls him out to carry the cross I'll do it for you he said I've got to do it for you Jesus my brother man said because Simon was African he said it just shows God cares about the Jew right God cares about the African God cares about everybody and even if you give it a Christian a cup of cold water the name of Lord you'll have a reward so no doubt Simon will have a reward first step begin to carry this the cross thirdly Simon is a beautiful example he's a picture of what a true disciple does now turn your Bibles to Luke 23 26 let's go back there Luke 20 26 look at this picture here notice and as they led him away they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian coming out of country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear after Jesus so Jesus goes before can you imagine they're just kind of pushing him and beating her he would die he would die if he had to carry that cross they're pushing him in a beating him along and he's he's all dripping blood he's just you can't recognize we don't look like a man but Simon is behind him carrying the cross he's following Jesus amen and it's so perfect because in Luke 9:23 I'll turn there it's such a perfect picture of discipleship and this is why you'll hear brother Branham say we got to follow the bloody footprints of Christ amen glory he said and he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me amen so Simon is behind he's following and no doubt he's bleed oh Jesus bleeding and he's able to follow those bloody footprints yet he's carrying the cross and it's a beautiful picture of how you and I must carry the same cross of Jesus Christ we carry a heavy burden right we live our lives and although there's days of great joy there's always a burden we got to carry whether we're rejected or whether we're laughed at or made fun of or whether we God allows us to be sick or God allows us to lose a loved one at a young age whatever the burden is whatever the cross that we must be a bear is we've still got to carry it and we've got to be willing to follow Jesus all the way to the cross amen till death sets us free hallelujah that's right what a picture of discipleship praise God and he was compelled than that doesn't that work compare our mind he had to kind of be pushed into it right you kind of had to be you better do this right you need to do this I remember jesus said when we're the last days we've got to compel them to come into the marriage supper so we've got to use compelling - you really need to read this book my pastor wrote right you really need to come to church and hear the message this hour you really need to listen this sermon that we put on YouTube you know you really need to hear the message of William Branham right whatever whatever tool or whatever witnessing opportunity you're gonna give you've got to compel people you really should do this this changed my life just as he was compelled to carry the cross we've got to carry we've got to compel people to carry their cross - and come and follow Jesus you should come to church you should repent we've got to compel each other amen so it's a beautiful picture of discipleship and lastly I like this it's a picture of sudden unexpected cross bearing and I think that's a beautiful picture don't you he wasn't he was just there right he was just there probably for the feast we're not sure why Simon's there but he's just compelled to do it because he came out of the country was coming out of the country and as they're as they're going on the the procession to go Gotha they just compel him you get over here and you help us out you help up this man being crucified out so it's a great picture we don't know when God's going to call us to take the cross but we got to be willing to carry the cross amen especially like when unexpected things happen in our lives we weren't expecting this now it's a burden now it's a now it's a life-changing event it was so unexpected well it might have been unexpected to us but God had it in his great plan all that's all along and we've got to be willing to accept the burden we've got to be willing accept that the cross that God allows us to carry all right good praise Lord now let's head back there let's go back to Matthew 27 we left off all right verse 33 when they were coming to the place called Golgotha that is to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingle with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting Lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet they part of my garments among them and upon my vesture they did cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation written this is Jesus the King of the Jews then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right and other on the left and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads and saying thou that destroys the temple ministered in three days save thyself if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders and said he saved others himself he cannot say if he be the king of Israel let him come down now from the cross and we will believe him verse 43 he trusted in God let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said I am the son of God the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his tC oh what a picture church I know we say that often but look how merciful God is people the only very thief on his right that would get saved in a few minutes is still saying the same thing to him he was just as guilty as everybody else but his last moments he asked for mercy amen live kind of the Holy Spirit even in your worst situation even in your lowest spot he's died look how the Holy Spirit was still working there the Holy Spirit had to leave Jesus so he could be cursed but the Holy Spirit was still there to bring that man to repentance and salvation amen you see you see here people say where was the Holy Spirit there why where's all these spirit if he wasn't on Jesus he was right there trying to win souls amen the Bible said the eyes of the Lord go forth around all the earth seeking someone that will honor God and serve God someone has a pure heart and I found up your heart amen but it wasn't always Pierre he's even their Machens mocking them the Bible says cast the same and his teeth see they're sneaking right through their teeth they're angry if you're the Son of God do something you see their faces the Bible reads it like that on purpose because it shows you how quickly a heart can change amen Lorie amen thank you Jesus now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land under the ninth hour the six hours noon so from noon to 3:00 there's darkness all over the land God turned out the lights on on earth amen hallelujah God was saying he's becoming dead he's becoming sin the very holy one the very perfect one has become a curse amen and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is to say my God my God why is there forsaken me so we are not sure when the Holy Spirit left Jesus probably the Garden of Gethsemane remember he still healed that man Malchus right the servants the soldier of the servant there he still had the holy spirit 19 to heal his ear at Peter cutoff so somewhere between there after that healing and here somewhere the Holy Spirit left him and then he cries out God you forsaken me my God my god watch out for sake of me showing to God and turned his back on his son right and God even showed it by turning off the light from the Sun I'm not going to let the Sun Shine on him because he's he so he has the Beast he's cursed all the curse of all your sins and my sin was on him and got it and turned his back and God had to forsake him that you and I won't be forsaken amen hallelujah my God my God why have you forsaken me at church we never have the opportunity to say that because God is always with us amen we should be saying my God my God help me to see you in this situation I don't see you help me to see you and help me to trust that you have not forsaken me let me not give in to the devil's lie that you have forsaken me because the Bible said he cannot forsake us amen he cannot leave us and some of them that stood there when they heard that they said this man calls for Elias nope he called for God and straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him the drink the rest said let be let us see whether a lice will come to save him Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost let's just we'll read 51 then we'll stop right there and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks read he imagined such can you imagine such a earthquake that would rip veil on a 30-foot high veil a cloth veil think about it you think about like if it tore not you're ripped apart the wall I mean you'd have to have a huge shift in order to lift this 30 foot really thick strong veil you have to have a major earthquake and so the light the sun's out earthquakes happening and the Romans sent it looks like it's up I said this has to be the son of God amen God was letting everyone see that this was a son he was paying the full price of all the sins past present and future and God was letting everyone see this is my lamb this is my sacrifice or he's curse that you might not be cursed that you might be blessed amen glory let's look at some of the types of Christ here brother man I'm just going to go through a few of these thing there seven he said notice in the butcher and the Baker one was refused one was rejected like the two thieves at the cross a perfect type can you say amen to that amen praise God little man and I just typed in cross and types and I found seven different ones from brother branham of course there's more I'll go through those in just a moment that's a tie the cross Jesus or Joseph in prison two men with him - yeah one dies and one lives and that's speaking of eternal salvation praise God amen number two Israel through the Red Sea brother man said the church ought to be pressing everywhere to hear the word of God staying with the word so I'm so glad you pressed your way out to the house of God tonight that's what the real church ought to be doing he says we're the church now tour the church spiritual just like Israel was the church natural we were brought out of bondage human bonded just like Israel's brought out of Egyptian bondage you believe that we come across we had to sacrifice to come out by the blood of the lintel the door in the post just across perfectly no one wants to go out to go under the blood after once coming in until they can't the call came to go out they crossed Jordan across the Red Sea a type of the blood sanctifying power of God killing all sin nature sin behind you the taskmasters the cigarettes the whiskey the road houses and the picture shows everything that bothered you back there and hindered your Christian experience died in the blood of Jesus Christ yes sir brother amen all your bandages all your addictions all the things that that bothered you it all was buried it all drowned in the sea and the blood of Jesus Christ a perfect type of Christ he says and they marched over how beautiful the types of our churches today how that they crossed the Red Sea and then Moses begin to sing in the spirit man picked up a tambourine began to dance it's like an old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting dancing dancing and praising or why they had to victory they got the victory thank God for the victory amen number three Isaac but then it said Abraham when he was old he believed and God told him to go and he obeyed and all just rode out I can see him take the servants the little mules and start out they get to the Mount of God I just love this this and this he said to the servants you say here while we go yonder in the land I shall return home I excuse me my emotion gets me from sometimes the land I shall return how I don't know I'm going up there to kill him and he says he knows somehow someway you return and here he had a knife sticking in his belt and he laid the wood on Isaac's shoulders and Isaac went up the hill led by Abraham beautiful type his only son taking him to the hill and the very altar that he had laid his son on he packed it up the hill on his back a type of God sending his son up Gow Gotha with the wooden cross on his back the very cross he was nailed on where the Bible said God spared not his own son amen Isaac taking that own cross up there just like Jesus had to carry it right but then they had to get Simon Cyrene to finish the job the very the very type the one who's to be crucified carries the cross right MA thank the Lord beautiful type Abel's blood sacrifice in Genesis chapter 4 the Bible said God received Abraham's sacrifice I'm sorry Abel's sacrifice but he rejected Cain's and the Bible said I can see Abel he gets a little grapevine reached out a little male lamb first from the old mother you wrap this vine around his neck and here he comes dragging him not much beauty is that is there pulling her up there then he got him up there a big rock laying at the east end of the gate came probably told all year to make the best crop that he could thought he could please God by that notice the beautiful type here he comes dragging little lamb pulling him along I could imagine little fellow falling probably knew what was near dragging his little feet perfect type of Christ dragging the cross God's lamb coming down through Jerusalem fouling week here come the little fellow beating along and when he got into the great rock laid him upon the rock taking a piece of sharp rock I don't know I guess they had no knives in those days laid him like that took him by the back of his head and pulled him up like this or the rock and began to chop as in a throat and the rock began to beat through his throat striking and on that rock died the Lamb bleeding blood splashing his little arteries cut the blood flying all over his little white will become bathed that red with blood God looked down from heaven and said that's it now you got it the way the blood spurting out his little veins amen and so this is Abel sacrifices he's striking at the lamb and it's all bloody and God said that's the way and then Cain tries to bring beautiful fruit and said God said that's not it salvation only comes by death and death is never easy right and God the only way God can save is through substitution because you and I can't save ourselves we need a substitute to take our place amen it's never pretty salvations never pretty if you got saved it was pretty you probably didn't get saved amen but if you got saved and you were weeping and crying rejoicing and dying out and you felt like you were totally ripped apart and fully repented and you felt like you died then you can understand what it was like for Abel amen because that's what Abel had to go through the bleeding the diagram the mess of animal sacrifice was a perfect type of Jesus Christ hallelujah what was it the Son of God 1,900 something years ago he was led from prison he was taken to the judgment seat from there to the Hall of scourging from up there up Gotha pulled up his Hill Simon the Cyrene helping him bear the cross and there died on the Rock of Ages with his blood beat out of him his body strip stripped or striped great big old globs of his maken soldiers spit on his face he said of my kingdom was of this world I'd asked my father he gave me legions of angels that would come and fight for me but this is not my kingdom but died kingdom come Thy will be done and it will be here pretty soon thy kingdom come Thy will be done glory when Billy Sunday said one time in every tree said an angel he just pulled your hand loose and put your finger that's all you'll have to do we'll settle the question down their mind ain't that the truth remember Jesus said I could call for twelve legions of angels he told Pilate he said but I'm not going to do it so go to him says Billy Sunday taught us that angels are sitting in every tree just waiting for the moment we'll help you we'll bring you down just like we strengthen you in the well strengthen you we'll bring you back to the health again and Jesus had that temptation but he knew God's will was not to deliver himself but to be delivered for you and I so he let those angels sit there and watch him and no doubt they wanted to help right but he said he kept himself from calling for deliverance he still suffered he chose to suffer that we didn't have to twelve thousand twelve legions rather twelve legions of angels I read somewhere that legions have at least 3,000 soldiers the twelve times three over thirty-six probably thirty almost forty thousand angels right around there he says don't you know I could call from heaven and my father would send twelve legions of angels I have all this help but the purpose is not to be delivered right now from from fleshly plane the purpose is to pay the sacrifice of all the sins of humanity Caiaphas looked and said oh he saved others himself he cannot save it was the greatest compliment ever paid to him idea the greatest compliment he saved others he can't save himself it was the greatest compliment if he saved himself he couldn't save others so he gave his life that he could save others hallelujah Amen what a compliment Amen he didn't save himself he didn't take the easy road he took the hard road he took God's Way amen the greatest compliment you could play he didn't save himself praise God he said all we like sheep have gone astray God laid upon the iniquity of us all he was led to the slaughter and like a sheep led like a sheep done before the shears opened out his mouth yet he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes were healed how could you reject such masters love amen he said to see him as he goes staggering up the hillside poor little weak frail body bending beneath the load that's why they had to call Simon out number five the brass serpent rodenticide now notice when these people had sinned against God and against Moses they sinned against God by speaking against God and speaking against his leader and now I want you to notice God told Moses to go make something make a serpent hanging on a pole now it was a serpent that was the death bite and he made it out of brass and hung it on a pole now what that represented the first thing the people had sinned and were dying of sickness now watch the compound reason they were sin and were dying of sickness because of sin and all sin is direct or either direct cause all sickness rather caused by sin before we had any sin we had no sickness and sicknesses in the hatchery to sin maybe not what you've done but what someone else done before you inherited sickness is an attribute of sin now God showing you the type now the first thing the pole represents the cross the wood the serpent itself being a serpent spoke of sin already judged for God had judged the serpent in the Garden of Eden but brass spoke of divine judgment was like the brazen Laver in the days of Elijah looked out and he said the sky looks like grass divine judgment over all the country no rain and now notice that these people had to look or behold that brass serpent the serpent couldn't pray for them they just had to look and live and it was for a compound reason to take away their sin and to heal their sickness praise God and Jesus over there speaking as Moses lifted up the brass serpent awareness the same reason must have Son of Man be lifted up now if the type done the healing what about the anti-type if the brass serpent the shadow done the healing what will Christ do - look at him look and live my brother look there Jesus now in the hymn amen if a natural brass serpent would cause healing and forgiveness how much more we're looking at Jesus Christ the real Jesus Christ today how much will that today bring both bodily healing and spiritual soul healing amen what a beautiful type it was our sin it was our sin right that causes the get bit by the snakes right but yet God made a way out of that and all she got to do is look away from our trouble and look to Christ and he'll heal us amen thank God how I'm gonna just move past that number six listen you're familiar with - this is from the fifth seal when Joseph brought his two sons to his father Jacob Jacob was supposed to bless them but member the Bible said that his hands were crossed I want to read it from this quote from the revelation of Jesus Christ he says now Joseph on Egypt was given a Gentile bride and through her he received a family of Gentile of two sons Ephraim and Manasseh Joseph asked of his father to bless the two boys he placed him in front of Jacob so that Manasseh the first boar would be on Jacobs right hand and Ephraim on his left as Jacob was about to bless that me cross his hands so that the right hand would fall upon the younger Joseph cried out not so father this is the firstborn to your right but Jacob said God has cost my hands amen so Ephraim was brought on this side Manasseh was on that side because the right hand represented blessing and authority and so the Jacob felt letting the lordís switches hands here in type we see the blessing which belonged to the firstborn the Jew was given over to the younger the Gentile through the cross the cross hands of the Lord Jesus Christ the blessing comes to the cross Galatians 3:13 and 14 said Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us amen hallelujah ofertas written cursed is every one that hangs on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith the blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentiles the Jews rejected the cross therefore Jesus got the Gentile bride how important it is for us to accept the cross because it's through the cross that we are blessed Jesus was cursed that we might be blessed and it all came through the cross all these are types the brass serpent is healing forgiveness divine healing of the body and here blessing comes to the cross because Jesus was cursed for us this is a long one here remember the and Elijah it was after Elijah less left the brook of cherith and gods that I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you and brother Bantam dramatized it she dramatized is it that this widow woman her husband died fighting for Israel but now they had three and half years of no rain and she kissed her little son and knows that they're going to die soon and she goes out and begins to pray and the Bible said she hears no and the Bible said she went picked up sticks and weatherman said notice two sticks what is it the cross now anyone knows any Indian friends here any hunter the correct way of making a fire is to cross two sticks I'd never know that cuz I'm not a hunter or two logs light it right in the middle and just keep pushing the ends together that's the perfect way to keep a fire going you keep pushing it together he said it didn't last all night he said many time have I laid in the wilderness with just two sticks no bigger than that and keep them warm all night just enough to keep ward keep it right in the center of it now what's she going to do line up these sticks and the word and the spirit has brought the self-sacrifice of the Cross ready for duty ready for life putting the word in the spirit that's her faith in the Word of God by the Holy Ghost leading herself to sacrifice anything else to the cross and when she got back or when she got this thick underarm two of them she started back and there's a voice came from the gate said lady maybe an old bald-headed gray man with whiskers and the old sheepskin wrapped around and walking down the street Lord it's a certain saying Lord is it it's a certain white fence there'll be a lovely young lady she must have been young because the boy was young you told me there's a widow that was going to feed me now where she I'll keep walking the spirit leads in this way then turns him now notice God was finished feeding him through crews and now God's gonna feed him through a young woman but see the point is God's still gonna feed him and that's how it is for you and I God may provide for you one way financially this way but when that runs out God is going to find another way amen or if so if something fails that something was blessing you and it failed God will find so another way to bless you praise God see God may provide through different means but he still Jehovah Jireh praise God he said so wonderful sons of God are led by the Spirit of God and all of a sudden the spirits that look to your right and then he said look to your right to your left there's someone praying who needs it and she looked back and said I just have a little bit of me left in a barrel I've got just enough oil i dampened it and I've already dressed it or I mix it I've got the word in the spirit so she had oil and flour but man said the oil is the Holy Spirit the flour was the word amen she said that's all I've got I've got a little bit of Holy Ghost and I've got a little bit of word oh my god that's all I got to live on amen so I need the cross I need the fire that comes through the cross to be able to take this oil and flour put together that I can live amen hallelujah and that's how we live today church slowly we live through the cross the fire the power of the sticks the cross plus the Holy Spirit and the Word of God it must all come together it's got a mixture of all those that we can live today in this and this our famine can the church say Amen it's a famine but the only way we live is through the cross and the word and the spirit and and the word gets together on the cross it makes a life loop for you a life of the hope anyway thank God he said I'm gonna bake it then we're gonna eat it and die now take him up we'll wait for death she said he said but you make me a little one first isn't that strange guy would ask a widow woman dying for the last bit of meal with a dying child God does things so strange make me a little one first she said you know the Bible says that we have entertained strangers we've entertained strangers there were angels not knowing what we were doing well she said I'll do it in that strange God will let some of us get so far into a struggle it seems like we barely have any strength left and then at the end of that God asks you to sacrifice a little more right you thought it was so hard before well I don't know if it could get any harder and she is tested to the very last this is her last hope she's given she's down to her last hope and God said now sacrifice that and put the word first stay ahead live for others amen manifest eternal life it looks like you have nothing left but still even if with your last hope live for somebody else and she turned and there it was the greatest consolation that any believer ever listened to he said for thus saith the Lord amen he said that's what the word she was waiting for the bell would not go empty neither will the crews go dry until the day God said rains rains set on the earth what was she waiting for she was waiting for a prophet to say thus saith the Lord amen she was waiting for a word from heaven and that's how we know we will survive in the midst of a famine because we were given thus says the denomination or thus saith the church we were given thus saith the Lord amen thus saith the Lord the last sign before the rapture was the ministry of William Pam saith the Lord so we look for no other signs because we've already received the sign first saith the Lord the mark of the beast is unionized religion the Confederacy of apostasy verse 8 the Lord every Church will take the mark of the beast will saith the Lord so we know not to join in with them amen it's not safe the Lord they'll say the Lord trinitarianism is of the devil thus saith the Lord amen that's it the Lord the only true baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ oh we've got that's how we live today just like she did we sacrifice everything there any last hope we have for any natural hope we've got to sacrifice it and Trust and thus saith the Lord what do we get there so what do we learn from this woman trusting in thus saith the Lord seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteous will be added how do you know brother Branham how do you know only thing I know put God first and move on sacrifice makes the oil makes the word and the spirit together and lay yourself upon the cross lay yourself upon the cross he says and say Here I am Lord put God first and everything so even as in your greatest trial the greatest hardship you'll have in the coming months put God first obey the word first don't compromise put God first for thus saith the Lord the crews will not run dry neither with a barrel empty into the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the earth she know then that that prophet was speaking to her oh how her heart must have jumped she ran and made that little cake and brought to him with the water trembling hand over that old sunken cheek she knew that God had come to the rescue over a little piece of bread oh you just take that one little promise of God and get everything right out of the way watch and what takes place get that heart the unbelief away from it just take that little believe that you've got and lay it on the cross and say this is all I've got Lord take it watch the turn thus saith the Lord oh he's just the same today as he ever was that's what she was waiting for maybe looks awful dark now Church but you know sometimes we're taught it's always the darkest before the day it's at the darkest hours or night when the morning star shines its reflecting the coming of the son hey man lay yourself on the cross he says so consider that you're you're the one that's got to lay there you've got to sacrifice everything you have and give it to God and trust God that if you put God first God will hear your cry he'll meet your need now oh that was all the types I had huh I thought I had more than that okay so I thought I have a few more though before I get to this one have a few more remember the cross when Moses was fine the Amalekites of the Israel they only won the battle when Moses his arms are raised a beautiful type of the cross of Jesus Christ but notice even he needed help right and look he had two helpers oh look it's Simon the Cyrenian and the angel glory I didn't think about that till just now Caleb and it wasn't Joshua it was Caleb and who was it her yeah that's right Caleb and her or Joe Joshua and her Josh Xuan her not Caleb Joshua because I always think Joshua and Caleb but it's actually Joshua and her so they whenever their arms were up they were winning whenever his arms were down and they were losing right so he needed help as long as Moses had help to keep his arms up in the shape of a cross then they would win and the fighters could look up and say we're winning now the hands are up or we're losing out because the hands are down let the hand stay up in other words keep our eyes on the cross of Jesus Christ when we realize the part of the Cross will win every battle amen right when we look to the victorious cross and all the Jesus accomplished on the cross all we gotta do is look and know the battles won just like the brass serpent amen hallelujah remember in first corinthians 10:4 the bible said they all drink from the spiritual rock that accompany them and that rock was Christ so Moses had to take the rod and he spit the crown or though the rock and the rock brought forth water which is a type of Jesus Christ when they Smit him it brought forth the holy spirit amen huh yeah and it happened twice right and believes in the second time Moses was supposed to speak to it but he struck it and we have said that was a type of this day where now he's being crucified Jesus being crucified a second time through denominations and creeds of men oh but they're still water flowing today amen today a former laterade they're still waters of life today for you and I although he's been crucified again they're still believers that will accept the water hallelujah remember the thirsty Israel came upon the oasis of Marah and the water was bitter and Moses said throwing he didn't say throwing gold glory he didn't say throw in brass he said throw in wood and when they throw the waters of the wood in the waters the Bible said the waters were made sweet and this is the type of if you throw the cross into a bitter situation it produces sweetness Oh hallelujah how many believe that Christ the cross of Christ will make you sweet when you're bitter how many ever experienced that oh it's really upset I really had a bad day I really had a bad attitude but when I got on my knees and prayed and I thought about Jesus or when I came to church I was all bent out of shape but as brother amen started singing or brother Jesse started preaching or somebody started preaching all of a sudden all my bitterness floating away and the waters became sleet all because of the cross of Jesus Christ hallelujah thank you Lord even even remember Balaam looked down from the mountain and he saw Israel and what shape were they in they're in the shape of a cross the Victoria they camped about in the shape of a cross a foreshadowing that God's people will be near the cross you'll have a part in that what brother have said you had a part in the cross if Jesus was the word then we had a spiritual part in him right not a physical but a spiritual right if he's the way that we in other words we are represented in the cross he paid the price for me because I'm a part of the word is that right you and I weren't on the cross we didn't die on the cross you and I didn't pay the price for sin Jesus paid the price for our sin but because the word was crucified and we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world that we know that he's paid our price he was thinking of us when he was on the cross amen so we have a great connection to the cross hallelujah Jonah was a type of Christ right three days the night to the belly of a whale and so his prayer in the belly of the whale was a foreshadowing of of Christ's right as a for shouting of the cross and so he cried out and he cried out to the temple he cried out to God's chosen place of worship right and Jesus cried out to God my God my God why have you forsaken me and that was so that we didn't have to be forsaken as we said earlier just like Jonah cried out to the temple so Jesus cried out to the heavenly temple and he was heard praise God he was heard Amen I'm almost through with these types here all right yeah I do believe that's it I had a list of 14 here but I've already covered those okay now let's look at a few things the Bible said that Jesus would bruise the serpentine oh Mack I like snakes I'm gonna show a little just a little bit about a serpent being crushed on the head okay so I don't mean I know won't upset you but I just want to prepare you because I know he likes to go around catch snakes and he's real good with them and he's got a pet snake but remember here the Bible says this the Bible said put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed and your seed shall bruise the Serpent's head in other words I will overshadow a virgin someday and come down and be made flesh myself and I'll take the sinners place amen so when Jesus was prophesied to bruise the head of the serpent it was a foreshadowing that Jesus was going to take our place praise God Jesus bruising the serpent head was him taking our place you and I couldn't bruise Satan we'd lose every time right just like Adam and Eve lost they couldn't Bruce the serpent only one person could do it the seed of the woman which was Christ the lamb said this now he cannot bruise it with the law so G God couldn't used well maybe I'll use Moses to bruise the serpent Moses couldn't do it wasn't the law the tables of stone couldn't defeat Satan glory he could not bruise him with the prophets Enoch couldn't do it right Ezekiel Jeremiah couldn't bruise the serpent so he had to do it when the woman's seed became the masterpiece Christ then the seed of the woman had to be a masterpiece and this revelation just struck me last week when Michelangelo made that masterpiece did he add anything to the rock or did he just take away he just took away are you with me when he's chipping away do you think he was worried oh I lost I lost some stone you think he was worried about that no that was the whole point of it to chip away so the stone would lose the stone so that we could see the masterpiece hidden in the stone and that's what you and I missed struck me last week that's just like you and I we only become a masterpiece when God chips away at our fleshly desires amen helps us lose some of our fleshly less and after chipping away all of our desires of the flesh AHA god help us to do it tonight he's God when God can chip away when we dial to this and that the self and die of the selfishness and die with the pride when we can die out and God can chip away all these things from our life we're constantly losing our own desires when he can chip away all that then you and I will be a masterpiece like Christ amen he said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus he became a servant and church that's what God is doing to us he's chipping away our thoughts so that we can get the right attitude to always be a servant for Christ do you want to be a masterpiece for Jesus well then you got to get a lot chipped away from you we got to get a lot of selfishness chipped away from us that we can be the right masterpiece for Jesus I like that the head glory look what he said about bruising the separate this old sinful world had a block out the Sun went down in the middle of the day it had a nervous prostration the rock shook the mountains rented the dead bodies bursted from the grave what'd he do God zeroed in at Calvary he wounded that animal called Satan forever so God did this God wounded the animal Satan now he's been more vicious since then Satan because it brought light to the human race and anyone knows that a wounded animal is at its most vicious crawling around with his back broke Satan was knocked out at Calvary by the heel right so God took his heel he zeroed in he said I'm gonna do it right there he saw that serpent right there all that sin right there and God took his heel he went and he smashed that Serpent's head amen God zeroed and said I'm going to put all the sin right there an evil serpent Satan all the Dominion he has over them and I'm going to smash him right there and I'm gonna crush his head amen under there yeah and Satan got knocked out at Calvary so you imagine God knocking him out he smashes up the head and the snake just goes like that sorry Malachi but he knocked him out the earth proved that it was the greatest price that was ever paid the only one that could pay it come down and down in that Calvary that's where the great prices pay that's one of the things now I'm gonna skip down there he said Lucifer the son of the morning was walked on the earth where as burning volcanic those same rocks that had cooled off when Jesus died at Calvary belched forth out of the earth that price that was paid the bondage of Satan was broke so Satan had chains of bondage Iran or everyone at the cross and God crushed that praise God God broke our chains at the cross oh I forgot the high decision he said yet he broke the backbone of say in their Calvary the backbone of sickness and it brings every mortal being on the earth back in the Friends of God with sins forgiven our sins are forgiven no more can Satan black us off from God there's a highway made there's a telephone sitting there there's a line the glory it brings every person in reach of that line because before the cross all the saints were kept in the heart of the earth and they felt member there's a chasm they could see the sinners and they didn't really feel close to God but Jesus came and he smashed those chains he broke Satan's back he bruised his head and he pulled them out and now they were live surely in the presence of God and now we are spiritually in the presence of God hallelujah we got a line to glory thank the Lord advance another church you don't have to say I'm not worthy we all know you're not sure you're not well I I don't deserve it of course you don't I don't deserve it I'm not worthy you're not none of us are worthy he said surely not you never could be but a worthy one took your place you're free you know have to wonder anymore you don't have to be a pleasure-seeking man out here on the earth because there's a fountain filled with blood for you see that in other words don't live in guilt instead of living in guilt live in gratitude amen instead of saying I'm not worthy Otto deserve of course you don't live in gratefulness living thanks in everything give thanks for this is the will of God we should be thankful for the cross all the days of our life you don't have to be lost there's a highway in a way it's called holiness he broke the powers of Satan he opened the prison doors of hell to every man that was shut up in the earth and the Prince fearing that when he died what death would be for him on Calvary he opened those cell doors that every captive go free you have to be no longer be torn by sin you don't no longer have to yield your members to send drinking smoking gambling telling lies you can be honest I love this page this is what we can meet today we can be honest we can be just we can be upright Satan can do nothing about it because you got a hold of a line you got a hold of a life line it's anchored in the rock of ages' nothing can shake you from it no winds can shake you from it no nothing not even death because the love of God that's in Christ Jesus so just whatever we struggle with we don't have to struggle with it right we can get freedom because Jesus broke the chains he broke the bondage Satan doesn't having dominion over us because we're free Jesus paid the price all right let me get a few of these things here I got these on here let's take our Bibles again let's remember what God did let's go to Colossians 2:15 Colossians 2:15 let's rehearse some of these by the grace of God I'll try to finish here almost been an hour my questions 2:15 since this is why it's called Good Friday right this part right here wasn't good for Jesus right but it was good for us amen that's why we call it Good Friday now let's go up to verse can't skip this verse 13 Colossians 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him for giving you all trespasses listen church if you're hanging on to anything from your past let it go let it go in the scripture he's forgiven you all your trespasses praise the Lord don't let if st. remind you some from the past just say God forgive me Lord if I haven't fully repented I'm sorry I never would have to answer for that I want to be forgiven I'm trust your blood has forgiven me for all my transgressions verse 14 blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross amen so all those mistakes we made it was nailed to the cross of Christ paid for and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it how did he spoil the powers of hell because he took the keys to death in hell hey that's how he spoiled them praise God he took their keys I remember them said Jesus didn't have the keys to the king gave that the Peter but Jesus had the keys to death in hell haha amen he gave him the keys to the kingdom to Peter but he said I'm gonna go get the keys of death in hell and when he raised from the dead he had those keys he was swinging those keys and all those Saints that were resurrected he spoiled all those principalities and he's proved to them that I'm in control deaths not in control I have power over death amen beautiful thank you lord Hebrews 2:14 and 15 I've tried to preach these every year so you remember and I remember what Christ did through the cross always trying to find a place to put these in here we ought to be so happy tonight praise God we ought to be Hebrews 2:14 and 15 first much soon as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is to say the devil to see the bruised head was Satan was Jesus destroying death the power of death and I remember when I preached on fear and brother him said the greatest fear of humanity is death now recent polls say public speaking is the biggest fear now but I think in all reality I think if people were near death I think if you ask older people I think the biggest fear would still be death don't you they probably asked young people they never think about death but yes old people it's probably death dying what's gonna happen when I die is everything in order when I die verse 15 here it is and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life subject to bondage see they they felt like they were and they were slaves to death right that's what Solomon said that's what Ecclesiastes was all about right he said I work and work in toil what is it just vanity he said I'm gonna build this kingdom I'm gonna dine I'm gonna give it to my sons and who knows that my sons are gonna be faithful with it he had all these sadness he was so discouraged he was depressed about death but in the New Testament when we know Jesus took his heel and crushed the powers of death now Paul can say Oh grave where is your sting Oh death where is your victory amen oh yeah and now Paul doesn't fear death where Solomon and Joel they all fear death now Solomon to earn parlors in fear because he knows Jesus conquered death amen and parted out the wonder if she's alive Jesus met him himself Jesus came and made sure the man is going to write the New Testament I'm gonna meet him myself a resurrected living Christ to show that I've conquered death hell and the grave and that way when Paul was walking to get his head chopped off as a martyr and program said that bee was flying around him Paul could say oh you've got no stinger you've lost your stinger there's no such thing as you've got no victory because God has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ so God destroyed God zeroed in and he took his heel and he smashed the powers of death but death has no more victory over us hallelujah now let's look at that picture here now bo-ram says it's also well known if the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in actuality a prophecy concerning what Christ would accomplish against Satan at the cross so what would he accomplished Church if you know a venomous snake their venom gland is right there in their head right and then it flows down this duct and it's released out through the fangs he's released out through the Fang so if you bruise a Serpent's head you've cut off the poison then it combines like one time I got bit by a gardener snake through a glove and it was really hard to rip it off the glove and I think I killed the snake I didn't mean to poor little fella and Bush he sure was aggressive though but they is what the pictures Jesus is going to bruise the head so the poison of death the sting of death this thing of the grave would be cut off so now there's no if you see a gardener snake now you might be scared but you're not life and death scared you just know that's just a little gardener snake right and you probably know a snake that's got a triangle head those are the most poisonous right the more so when you see a little gardener Hakes and gardener snake head it's just like you're not scared of that because that's not poisonous and usually the more colorful there are the more poisonous they are but see st. was the most poisonous snake ever and God zeroed in God saw him slithering around Jesus and the member sure Satan didn't know what death would do to Jesus but the brand said when Jesus got down to hell Satan's that I thought I had you enable he said I thought I had you in Moses that I thought I had you in Ezekiel and Jeremiah he said I was for sure I had you in John the Baptist seed st. really didn't quite understand it all but gee but Satan said now I've got you now and brother and said Jesus gave him a swift kick Jesus gave him a swift kick and took the keys of death and hell and they slammed the door and said he said come with me let's take this make a whistle-stop in Jerusalem I'm going to prove that I've spoiled all the powers of death and hell and I got the keys amen see Satan thought he had him he thought he's going to kill the Messiah and enable he thought he thought Moses was the Messiah Joshua he thought all these people were the Messiah and then when he killed Jesus he didn't understand what he was doing he was actually saving God's people free amen hey God zeroed in there and he smashed with his heel and now the Serpent's head is bruised and now death cannot conquer because Jesus has the keys of death hallelujah let me find it the closer now do you remember that day on Calvary better have said did three things I forget the second I remember I remember the the first and the third the first thing is that it's settled the sin question I was looking at my notes today I remember the second Calvary cell the sin question you and I no longer have to answer for our sins because we recognize God's sacrifice took our place right and we're forgiven all of our trans trespasses and the third thing it did brother Graham said was it the Calvary motivates us to do the greater works so let's look at the greater works just for a moment here now I'll skip ahead there's a lot of reading here perhaps Jesus at the works that I do shall you do also and greater works shall you do because I go to my father here in this church here's the greater how many one do the greater works if people have received the Holy Ghost in our church then we've done the greater works amen now notice the greater works was that power of the church not only to heal the sick by prayer which were thankful when God does that now only to cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the Holy Ghost was coming and giving the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant today huh so not only are sins forgiven but now we can do the greater works and the greater works are imparting and praying for people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost aren't you glad Church oh my goodness hallelujah that's beautiful he said what does he turn a life the life that he lived the life that was in him and part that to others can a man do that a son of God can Jesus said whosoever sinned you admit to them they were admitted whosoever seems you retained to them they are retained all right let me uh I'm going to close in just a minute let me get a couple more things so the last few things I want to say on the cross Jesus destroyed the power of death do we still see death though sure yeah people die all the time and if God Darius we're all gonna die right so he destroyed the power of death he took the poison out of that serpent right he crushed the head of that serpent and now death can't hold us in the heart of the earth remember what brother Branham said he said that's the reason the Witch of Endor could call up Samuel because there was no blood to protect them they were just in the heart of the earth so Satan could have access to Souls and he could just he had the Piatt jury as he has great power but after Calvary Jesus that I haven't taken them back and Satan won't ever touch him again and he led captivity captive amen and now how Satan can't get them because every time he tries to come to heaven together Jesus said where's their sin I don't see their sin it's already paid for amen hallelujah thank the Lord but death is still here death has been though disarmed right death has lost its power death has lost its victory praise God and you and I know that the last enemy that will be destroyed as what death remember that revelation the last thing that destroyed is death because as soon as death is destroyed then everybody that's left after the Millenium is gonna live for eternity hey hey remember all those people in the Millenium they're all going to that all the ones that get to see by Satan are gonna have to come up to the surround Jerusalem but the the Jerusalem Temple and Bieber by fire and then the white throne judgment where the the sheep are saved and then the goats are casting like a fire and the last one that's destroyed is death God takes this wounded snake it's got a bruised head no more poison God and he's still around there he still he still does a little bit right but he's wounded and God finally takes that snake and he throws him into the fire and that's the last enemy that's destroyed and normal enemies praise God no more snakes through the route no more people dying from here on out it's all life it's all eternal life no more death the last enemy's been destroyed no more serpents no more tears no more sadness it's all joy and glory and Holy Ghost life amen yeah thank God and who we fight now were fighting that same snake now except that snake is on a pale horse right now right and he changes appearance now I don't look like a snake he looks like a horse rider the last horse rider what's his name we don't know his name for the first three rides on that last ride that Eagle anointing calls him out he's death brother random the prophetic ministry he's death that's the Antichrist spirit Satan but the Bible's the rapture we get we get our victory over death because the Bible said death will be swallowed up in life oh thank God for that aren't you glad Church that you and I get the victory over that pair of horse rider just like think about it eagle how easily can an eagle Brant or put their in a tree if a horse rider comes by how easy is it for an eagle to fly on the out of the way all you gotta do is flap his wings cause the others put to work these powerful wings that he has and then he catches the air and he flies up that's that's the type of the rapture praise God when we go in the rapture that's all we got to do spread our faith in the Old Testament New Testament and fly out of here because we'll get victory we'll defeat death we'll fly up in the rapture and when victory over death because that's God's plan for his Eagles thank the Lord out of the area we batter him we see him but one day for the rapture will get death will be swallowed up and we'll have victory over him and we'll fly away up to heaven let's stand to our feet let's close to this quote I gots got one more quote I hope it's been a help to you tonight by God's grace Pope would spend a good reminder of the power of Christ the power of the cross by the cross is so powerful it can take a murderer who's mocking Jesus in a few moments make him tender-hearted make him repent make him say sorry remember me remember me on the day of judgment I don't want to go to hell there's nothing wrong with Jesus Christ he's perfect he's holy or if they can do that to him how about us tonight praise God those of us who already saved already filled with His Holy Spirit how it should make us have the right attitude tonight if we got the wrong attitude if we done anything wrong how it should make us understand the cross of Christ the last thing Krauss does I just wanted to close to this there's just three little slides the last thing the cross does is make us humble right buh-bam says this tell me any man any woman can come to Calvary and try to be a big somebody because somebody said something tell me where you can look in the face of Calvary he said it's right light that day in Calvary he says have you had your day on Calvary and come out of a stuffed shirt how can you come out a puppet for some organization and preach some man-made doctrine why don't humble you to the Word of God I said why don't it humble you to the Word of God if you ever go there you'll come out humble it's like for me preaching on a good Friday night this doesn't make me feel prideful and look how it look what a great preacher look how faithful this makes me humble right coming to church on Good Friday should make us all humble it doesn't make us a stuffed shirt look what we did because church we didn't need nothing all we did was look and live a may Christ did all the work amen Christ did everything and all we got to do is stop looking at our sin problem and look to our forgiveness solution amen we just got to look to this the solution to our problem how can you want to be some big something in your organization with a feather in your hat when Jesus Christ son of God humbled himself to a hacked-up body to a spinet face until shame and disgrace and they stripped his clothes off and crucified him before the world despising the shame how can you in a countering come away anything different than when he was a disgrace in a shame it's the last quote brothers we can come here to the your instruments here oh you say they'll kick me out let them kick have your dad Calvary God will have his way with you let me quote that again have your day at Calvary and God will have his way with you and we'll stop right there praise God you can pull up the songs there honey want God to have his way your life amen you and I cannot come to this service I can't breach this and come out we'll look what a great job I've done we haven't done anything I haven't done one thing all I've tried to do is remind you and remind myself of what Jesus Christ already did for us what he did he sent us free he's the one that conquered death he's the one that destroys the works of the devil how many wanna be more humble as we pray here at the end how many need a healing does anyone need anything from the cross tonight all's we got to do is look to the cross let's pray Heavenly Father I don't know the needs tonight but we have just enjoyed your word it doesn't make us prideful it makes us humble Lord God I was marabous I ran from you for 19 years Lord God but instead you took my place so I didn't have to die thank you Lord God you know not seen the effects of the cross in my life I've seen you bury my taskmasters in the blood-red sea as I came out of organization Egypt thank you lord god it wasn't me held in the waters it wasn't me that drowned all the enemies it was you I just followed those bloody footprints like Sabbath I was just willing to take up my cross and follow you Lord God and you made the way well it seemed to me the way we since did I stood still and saw the salvation of God

area if something's bothering them from the past may they remember that you married it in the sea of forgetfulness Lord God it's only been married no sin followed us out of Egypt hallelujah thank you
