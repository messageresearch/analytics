[Music] [Music] my lord my lord kumbaya kumbaya that's all Stan I believe he'll come by here don't you I believe that he promised to praise God mm-hmm let's go to Matthew 13 here as we open our Bibles tonight by God's grace Matthew 13 I like to continue on the kingdom of heaven as I mentioned this morning Matthew 13:44 look at the treasure hid in the field tonight by God's grace and I'll be honest you know I got a lot of good revelations out of this this study I seen it in a brand new way and I never preached on it before and as I was studying and reading and praying you know I just felt like a new revelations came out of here so I trust to be a blessing to you Loran when the seals were opened the Bible became a brand-new Bible I can say that amen to that because I knew the Bible for a couple years in denominational systems and then when message came it became a brand-new Bible I know Amen could save him into that too you know van could they all went to church and Jose went to church but now it's a new Bible so it's still opening up the Bible is still unfolding so we're very thankful Matthew 13:44 just one verse but there's a lot in this verse right here because we have to look at the symbols of it so this is the parable the treasure hid in the field let's just all read that verse 44 let's all read that on three one two three again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field amen let's have a word of Prayer everything on your heart just making known unto God Heavenly Father were happy to be in your house Lord and we've sang that song come by here Lord God and that's what we want just come by here we felt your presence so strongly this morning we thank you for that Lord God and thank you for keeping this church pure and clean dear God and driving all the trash Lord to the shores Lord God and just doing a great move by the wind of the Holy Spirit the Lord just come tonight Lord and minister to every heart Lord God may each one Lord receive their heavenly portion Lord God I'm in need of it Lord we're all in need of it and we're happy to be in your house thank you for the songs that we've saying Lord there calmly Lord God they're pleasant they're beautiful Lord God it's a joy to worship and sing to you and I'll bless us with thy word may we receive it and get our spiritual vitamins in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you I like to just share a few things here from Wednesday night Wednesday night I kind of went longer than I thought I would I didn't get quite to finish what I wanted to share Wednesday night so let me just finish a little bit about the seed into the ground did you enjoy that hope that was a blessing to me it is the revelation of the three works of grace and so I believe that to be fully taught there in the Word of God I'm gonna turn there here in my notes excited I think I recycled the other ones because I've used him up and wrote all over him but let me go to the end of my notes there I want to bring out this one thought yeah so with the seed cast in the ground there was three stages and a Wednesday I actually had not studied out those words blade ear and corn so I went and I shared that with you on Wednesday night and then I went home and studied what brother BAM said and the only thing brother Branham said about it was he typed the blade ear and corn to the last three Church ages which is an interesting type you know Luther Wesley and then Branham we believe it's Branham some people don't but we believe it's Branham so that's an interesting thought there as well for the kingdom of God and you could take it no doubt you could take it that way and God rest restoring and getting the bride ready for the actual entrance into the kingdom of heaven because that's the end of time after the Laodicean Church age tribulation and then the Millennium and that's the ushering in of the kingdom praise God so you could take it that way too but I think it really works out great for the three works of grace now I want to read that quote I didn't get to it on Wednesday night but I think I've reviewed it a couple times in the last few weeks so he says the rams talk telling a story and it is the rising of the Sun his mother had a dream before she passed and she saw a woman on high heels trying to walk the highway there was three steps member to walk the highway and brother Ram said you can't walk this road in those heels and brotherman warned her and she kind of threw him off you know and just disregarded the warning he said she started walk a little bit but then fell off brother branham said he tells a story and he said right on the highways a little pearly white lying right the doors of heaven to the pearly gate and that pearl had been stretched out to the top of the three steps oh there it is pearly gate if that ain't my message exactly today justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so Bo BAM said those three steps leading to the highway were the three works of grace justification sanctification back to the Holy Ghost and he called it my message amen so that was my man's message so this parable of the three stages of wheat has to be connected to the baptism the Holy Ghost because the batson Holy Ghost is the Kingdom of Heaven and so it has to fit there somewhere in the scripture and God did that for us so we're thankful for that now I got four more pair or more parables to do of the Kingdom of Heaven then we'll be finished with this little series Lord willing and once we have the treasure hid in the field we'll look at that tonight the pearl of great price the laborers in the vineyard and the unmerciful servant so have those four left and these all deal with salvation he's all deal with salvation someone look at those here all right so yeah that oh yeah one more thought here to finish this off one more thought now what was interesting in this parable is that once the grain came to full fruit the Bible the Bible calls the fruit of the corn once it came that third stage he said immediately the man went and harvested the wheat now so see this speaks of immediately when the last grain of wheat is mature the rapture is gonna happen amen when that last person gets the bat to the Holy Ghost and they recognize their names on the Lamb's Book of Life Jesus is gonna come back amen wouldn't you be why don't you you privileged to me what the one to witness to and win that person to the Lord and the last person is maybe out of Akron or last persons maybe out of Ohio or something like that would that be glorious to us it doesn't matter though where it happens as long as it happens amen we may not have in our life but it'd be nice if it did happen in our life but we know Christ is coming back for his bride and his wheat children right his wheat seed children he's not coming back for the tares they're getting bound and burnt he's coming back for his wheat praise God now we still pray for the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his vineyard so still pray for brother Simon pray for the brothers had go over to Japan pray for the brothers to go to China you know pray for them because the jesus said it we need it praise God we got the the harvest is ripe for them in other countries not for us but the harvest is ripe for them I said another big check over to support Simon's ministry so I'm not sent to the last two months like I said I just I had it on my heart I told the Lord I said Lord I'm gonna give you 1/4 of all the tithing I'm gonna give that to missionaries I just had that all my heart so I've been doing that the last two months and so I'm gonna keep doing that and I may send it you know some months to brother Jason to Mars but right now since Simon's got the need right there and I don't think any church supports him I believe there's even if there's no see there in Thailand I believe they deserve a chance to hear the message and if he's got nobody supporting him it must be our duty to support him right you know because we got to do something so I've just felt led to do that now some some months I may send it to do some more postcards for our church but I just want to do that I want to invest in I want to make sure I'm putting at least a quarter of our income into the ministry and now it takes about a quarter to keep this building going which is alright I'm thankful for it you know I appreciate this but I just wanna let you know I still believe in that the harvest is ripe and we must pray for the heart Labor's to go into the harvest praise God because it takes a real or it takes a real sacrifice to go out and do missionary work missionary work like I said it's not evangelism evangelism where there's already churches that that's easy that's not missionary work because you got air conditioning you got you just easy life it's easy living I know cuz I've done it before it's it's not really hard so we got to pray for the laborers now also I want to just close with this there's two more scriptures James 5:7 says be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain now know did you notice what he said there but they men did you notice he called all those wheat seeds precious amen there's some precious wheat seeds in hongkong they still need to hear the message right there's some precious wheat seeds in Thailand that need to hear the message I believe do we believe the gospel we got to go to every nation till the rapture comes so we got to be patient and let the word go to every nation and then Jesus will make sure every precious soul that once the truth will receive it praise God we just got to be patient therefore to the coming of Lord now and the parable looks like immediately but that's really what happens in jesus's mind once that last one's mature he comes and snatches them away harvest ism' harvest them up see each mature wheat plant is precious in his holy site like that song red and yellow black and white they're all precious in the sight it's so true the Lord of the harvest will not lose or leave behind one single kernel of a single wheat head remember there's between 30 to 50 little wheat seeds on each head praise God and he's not gonna lose one of them because he says and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day he's not gonna as we end it on Wednesday night member with the miracle of the fish in the loaves he didn't leave one fish behind he gathered every one of them up because it was part of his supernatural work and his work is not in vain amen his work is not wasted the work of a Christian is your Labor's never in vain in the Lord amen and there's nothing lost and and God will never own a man anything praise God he will reward you or all your labor of love God is faithful amen so I want to finish with those few thoughts there hope that was a blessing now let's go to the next then the one we read for our text here well let me uh let's go to Matthew 25 let me lay this thought in here real quick by God's grace I know we all like seeing quotes I love seeing them too so later you can switch over later you can switch over when you want here now I don't smile I know this this app I don't know how to raise the iTap this thing but it don't give me an option well maybe it's that one full screen mode maybe I'll try to let's try that well now then I lost my spot okay it didn't do it it's no it's no different okay I I just don't know the app really good Matthew 25 I want to share this again I've been preaching on it I mentioned it a few times but I just think tonight I'll just nail it down here Matthew 25 so this is the parable of the the sheep and goats being divided Matthew 25 am I in the right chapter oh no I'm in 2026 okay now hear him all right now verse 31 when the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit on the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats my brother have said see it's as a shepherd so brother man says they're these truly weren't the real sheep of God because the sheep of God already heard his voice they were the bride the ones that lived on the earth and had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he has to give some symbol to the people being saved and the people being lost so he used his sheep and goats it's as a shepherd verse 33 and he set the sheep on the left right hand but the goats on the left and here it is right here then shall the King say unto them on the right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so with that in mind let's read this many you might might remember this is from the same message that we referenced this morning questions answer 64 I'll tell you I'm so glad I listened those when I first came in the message both samuel was preaching on him I just listened to him over and over again they answer so many questions so if you really want to listen to a good set of sermons listen those four if you haven't listened those really amen there'll be a real blessing to you brother Branham who will populate the earth outside the heavenly City now notice in our text Jesus just says come he blessed you were for know know my father inherit the kingdom well the bride's already sitting with Jesus up on the throne so who are these that are gonna in have a part of the kingdom the foolish virgin because he loves a foolish version they're a part of the they're part of the cloth they're they're not the that they're not the chosen piece you know the pattern they're the remnant but he still loves the Redmund the remnant still kept him at it they still live version now verse 4 chapter 4 I'm sorry paragraph 48 who will populate the earth outside the city outside it will be the redeemed that will populate the earth outside the city but they will not be the elected and called bride the bride will live inside the kingdom with the King on the outside will be the kings of the earth that Labour and bring their toils not toil but bring their fruits into the city the and the doors will not be closed by night now on this light on top of the mountain will not light the whole world and only light in the city but it can be seen the distance of thousands of miles maybe but it won't lighten the earth because the Bible said the new world from that from one Sabbath to the other and from one of the new moon to the other you see where the people come up before the Lord and a Zion up to the city to worship can you imagine every Sabbath everybody's gonna gather around but we're not we don't have to travel to church because we're already at church amen you'll be a pillar in the temple of God amen see they gotta travel to church but we already at church oh thank you Lord is my heart that was David's desire and that's our desire to you amen Oh glory and now they will be outside the city not the bride but the people that come up in the second resurrection right why throne judgment and that will be the tillers of the soil just like animals and so forth the cares of the garden but the king and queen will remain in this city and then he stops right there talks about each person's angel how the angel Lord and camp with them that fear the Lord now you might think well there's not enough room in that City but yes there is remember the size 144 thousand cubits it's the size from Maine all the way down to Florida that's just that's just the ED that's one side of it that's how big it is and it's going up you know its upward mountain you know it's a mountain that comes up I'm sorry yeah the Bible said the earth raised up like a mountain and then the the capstone comes down from heaven and so the bride all the bride down through the ages lives in that city now what's interesting church is that court I read where the RAM said that the Millennium was more important than we thought before so in the Millennium the bride the Bible said we plant and build houses and all these things the jesus said will rule nations with a rod of iron so it's interesting it seems like in the Millennium we get to go out and maybe have our own little kingdoms and nations and things like that and the Bible said rule over ten cities right rule over five cities but then it seems like it switches and then in the and then in the future home the bride just stays with her groom all the time amen so it's kinda like we get a little recreation during the honeymoon there's time for recreation and go build and everything like that but then Jesus says I want my bride with me for all eternity that's what it seems like so it's so important for Christ to have his 1,000 year millenium one day is 1000 year millennium with his bride he lets them rule right you know they rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years the Bible said but here in the future home the bride stays in the city and then the foolish virgin have a portion of the kingdom isn't that gracious of God to give them up easy give us and give them of course we believe will be the bride because of the word but even the foolish version get a portion a part of the kingdom of heaven he says blessed are you coming to Haran a part of the kingdom of heaven amen but then every Sabbath they got to come in and they got to come into the temple then they'd have to leave the temple I'm so glad it off to leave it praise God I'm so glad we get to stay with Jesus amen if we're faithful we'll get this day with Jesus praise God now hope that was a blessing there by God's grace yeah so the treasure hid in a field and I did look for quotes on this one I never found anything specific on a quote about treasure in the field some so what I have to do is rightly divide the word of God so the treasure hid in the field I think you'll like some of these scriptures here now here's the if I remember I tried to sum up every mystery or every parable with a one sentence revelation so here's what the sentence I came up with from my heart a true believer joyfully trades all his possessions at the surprising opportunity to gain Christ and this is the treasure in the field because if you read the parable if we read through it again we'll see it's a surprising thing he's he's not expecting to find this treasure amen neither was I expecting to find the message amen and now each parable is a little different because now this this might be some of us we might have been totally surprised now in this one they're actually searching for that they're actually searching for the pearl they're actually searching for pearls here so and I'll explain that you know Jesus gives multiple parables to kind of fit our different experiences that we have as everybody has it a little different experience right like Paul Wendon I've talked about this before how she kind of fought the message for a little while and you know and cam did too and and if anybody fought the message it was st. Paul he heard about Jesus Christ and he bought it bought it bought it other people like Peter they said he said come follow me he's like okay but see it's the same grace for all of us we all love Jesus Christ and some have different experiences but Jesus gives us these different parables to match our experiences so Matthew 13 I'm gonna read that again there 44 again that the kingdom of heaven so the batsu the Holy Ghost is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man has found he found it he hide a--the and for joy therefore goeth and selleth all that he hath that might by the field so see a true believer joyfully trades all of his possessions at the surprising opportunity to gain Christ he just found this treasure hid in a field you wouldn't think your treasure would be in the field right so let's look at some of the symbols here let me set my timer here the first symbolist treasure now this may strike you I don't know but listen the first simple treasure stands for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe that because Paul teaches that gospel light that is shine in our hearts is treasure in earthen vessels that's in that's in second Corinthians four six and seven so that's what I believe I believe it's the baptism Holy Ghost for Christ dwells in our hearts by faith the Bible says in that scripture Jesus spirit is treasure it abides in the heart or the inner man according to Ephesians 3:16 it is the treasure in the inner man this Holy Ghost treasure fell into the hearts of believers on the day of Pentecost for Peter said the promise of the Holy Ghost is what God shed forth see he shed it forth right and Paul we see the same experience later saying the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us in Romans 5:5 amen yes so you just see what it does these parables tie all the scriptures together and you can see it if you look at all the scriptures to gain Christ is to be filled with his spirit and Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you and Paul says that the kingdom is the hope of glory it's Christ in you praise God so Jesus says the kingdoms in you Paul says Christ is in you amen oh it's so clear and after his resurrection Jesus breathed on his disciples urging them to receive the Holy Ghost treasure saying receive you the Holy Ghost Christians will always love and consider God's Spirit a treasure above the things of the world whereas the tears will love worldly pleasures and riches more than God amen so hope you can see that treasure stands for the baptism Holy Ghost because it's in earthen vessels praise God now where's the treasure found this might surprise you too it's hidden in the field but the field is the the Old Testament because Jesus is teaching from the scriptures says how God hid hides himself from the wise and prudent the prideful right and reveals themselves to babes such as would learn let me show you how he did it eight hundred years before the Messiah Joel prophesied of the baptism of Holy Ghost treasure in Joel chapter 2 28 to 32 it was laying there it was hidden there right in the scrolls the whole time just in some field right anybody could have read that just out in any field right eight hundred years Jeremiah 600 years before Christ he prophesied and said this is the Covenant I'll make with Israel after those days I'll put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people praise God jeremiah 31:33 it's laying there it's hidden there 800 years 600 years the next is Ezekiel praise God 500 80 years before the Messiah Ezekiel found the baptism or foretold the batson Holy Ghost and he said a new heart would I give you a new spirit when I put within you and I will take away the stony heart of your flesh and will give you a heart of flesh and I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them so see the treasure is in the field and that means the bats of the Holy Ghost is foretold in Scripture praise God hallelujah that's right thank the Lord so he just found it laying there in the scripture praise God now the parable says the man found the treasure and this is the human perspective not God's okay because in our perspective it seems like when we come to Christ we just found him but did God did God just find us did God just haphazardly I hope somebody hope when he gives her heart to the Lord some their whole van gets saved someday no God didn't just stumble upon us and find us God had it all he all he foreknew at all amen so see this parable is from man's perspective it's just like it's just like works and faith right but the RAM said faith is what God sees works is what man sees amen so it's the same idea it's different perspectives people have different perspectives right we have God's perspective and we have man's perspective same thing here this is man's perspective praise God the Bible says no one can come to the Father Jesus except the father draws him and Jesus is the one seeking the lost not vice-versa so see Jesus is out there actively seeking us out right but we don't know it he lets us many times he lets us experience it when people get saved it's a surprise to them they just stumbled upon it people say I found Jesus but really Jesus found you but see for those people who experience it like that that's that's that's the parable they can relate to that's well that's how it was for me I just stumbled upon it amen see God's gracious heart though let's man experience the joy of finding unexpected treasure from his own human perspective this is what Philips heart burned with excitement when he experienced the joy of finding Christ he told Nathanael we found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Gee's of Nazareth the son of Joseph Amen see that was Philips experience Philip is like the one who found this treasure praise God this is what they all wrote about and I just found it but it was laying there the whole time amen see God knew he's gonna come upon it but from God's perspective Jesus was finding Philip and Nathanael but for Philip it's like look who we found Oh amen hallelujah you see that he used those actual words look what we found and this was treasure that they found in the field amen but Jesus knew the whole time they'd believe see while men are surprised at finding Christ God's not but I'll say like this there is rejoicing both on earth and in heaven the angels of God rejoice over ones sinner who repents praise God that's right heaven rejoices when you repent hallelujah and of course earth does to the believers rejoice thank you lord see so this parable emphasizes how God uses the element of surprise in believers lives awakening them from their complete ignorance just as finding unexpected treasure in a simple common feel with the light of man how many ever found 50 bucks laying around I don't think I've ever found 50 Oh Stephen has praised alone Steve has how many 200 my god is good sir god is good I think I found 20 before I think I've found 20 pretty good fine oh I found $5 at the cash register we went through a car wash I was like oh there's $5 but the workers like oh I'll take that and he took it right from me I'm like well okay buddy if you wanted that bad you're gonna have it because somebody you know it got dispensed out and the person didn't take it they must have not seen it I'm like okay you can have it see surprised to find it see unexpected treasure it delights man see God's surprising instant introduction of himself into a man's life brings joy unspeakable and here's another example the Samaritan woman at Jacob's Well went to find water but instead she found living water amen surprise surprise surprise this ain't gonna be the regular day not for her it was just gonna be a regular day I'm gonna have to go out there with the prostitutes I can't go out with the pure women oh but she found something different that day praise God hey man she found the living water surprised her so much so she ran into the field I'm sorry she ran out and she made sure she bought it she made sure that she could keep this treasure amen hallelujah the Bible said many of the Samaritans of the city believed on Christ for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that I ever did so she's one this is just like the parable that Samaritan woman finds a treasure and she makes sure she goes and sells outright so she have that treasure here's another one so we went Philip and Nathaniel as one example the second example the Samaritan woman the third one is Philip the eunuch Philip and the eunuch in Acts chapter 8 he's just reading Isaiah 53 and all of a sudden he gets some spontaneous joy when Philip starts preaching to him and he's so surprised what does he do he said stop the chariots can I be baptized right now he found that I found the treasure can I go make sure I sell out can I sell out to the world and make sure I'm baptized and Philip said of course if you believe that's what we need around here we need everybody to believe with all of our hearts amen that's what I need we got to believe with all of our hearts and that shows the joy of finding treasure unexpectedly see he didn't expect that God had to translate Philip right God had to translate him out of a revival in Samaria and bring him out here out in the wilderness to surprise this man and so the man the unit could see the treasure of God and then sell out and believe it praise God hallelujah now this parable says the man hid the treasure before making the purchase of the field this hiding God's treasure is like meditating and memorizing Scripture so you hide that word in your heart because Psalms 119 11 says thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee I memory Church when I first heard this message guess what I did I went out and bought a voice recorder remember the ones that those handheld voice recorders this is before iPhones so I had a I had a flip phone I could call on then I had a little voice recorder with those plastic little cassette tapes and it was so dear to me brother bang the first thing I did I started reading acts 2:38 in there and I just read it and I listened to it I Drive I just press the play button and just listen to it repent and be baptized everyone you the name Lord and then I started memorizing scripture that way see because that's what it is in the scripture when you go and hide the treasure before making the purchase you're hiding God's Word in your heart that's right see meditating on Scripture ensures that the word is stored in your heart because David said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength and my Redeemer amen Psalms 1914 Psalms 1 verse 2 declares the Blessed man who delights in God's Word and his law doth he meditate day and night that's how you're gonna grow is memorize any more scripture may God's Word be hidden in our hearts amen right like Jeremiah said here's a good one from Jeremiah maybe haven't read this in a while this bless me Jeremiah 15:16 thy words were found and I did eat them and thy word was unto me as the joy and rejoicing of mine heart a man he said he found God's Word and they were a joy and rejoicing that's a demanded he found the treasure and it was for the joy he went and sold everything he had praise God so we can see all the beautiful types here that go along together hope you can see that now the next symbol is buying and selling buying and selling have both a natural and spiritual meaning in this parable and the natural believers gladly sell out any financial gains that might hinder their relationship with Christ in order to receive him and there's many examples what in Moses do instead of the financial blessings of Egypt the Bible said he chose to suffer affliction with the people of God in order to gain heavenly riches hallelujah he sold it out he sold out Egypt he saw the financial worldly pleasures that would accompany being the son of Pharaoh that was Hebrews 11 24 through 26 Elisha sold out his farming aspirations order follow Elisha he slayed his yoke of oxen and fed the people so he could minister to Elisha ah he really sold out lock stock and barrel huh he'll assorted out so much that death was there right he fully died out he died out to everything so they could follow the spear Alijah a lot like us praise God the brothers Peter and Andrew and James and John had two sets of brothers their left their fishing nets in order to follow Christ as fishers of men and then Jesus promised Peter and all the believers that the rewards for sake in the world would be a hundredfold now in this time and eternal life I'm sorry and eternal life in the world to come praise God what a what great rewards he promises to all those who forsake everything for him hallelujah now the spiritual selling out means forsaking Satan's lies and buying represents repenting from those lies and believing God's Word that's scriptural Jesus says selling is losing your life that you might find your spiritual life which includes loving Christ more than your family praise God that's Matthew 10:37 239 he said you sell your life that you might find it praise God and I love this from proverbs 23:23 says buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding praise God you we see we bought this truth praise God we sold out all Satan's lies and we purchased this with our faith amen we bought this truth it's ours ain't man it's our possession we just got to hang on to it praise God buy the truth and sell it not when you buy the field of biblical truth you experience the treasure of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right not only can you buy the truth but Jesus tells the Llano see in church age which is our age to buy spiritual gold and white raiment from him Gold is time-tested unwavering faith and white raiment represents a righteous spiritual life of integrity in obedience to the Word of God Oh church don't you want to buy that praise God aren't you glad if you have bought it praise the Lord gold time-tested unwavering faith white raiment the righteous the righteousness of spiritual integrity I was praying that the other morning in my claws I'm saying Lord you know my heart I don't want to sin against you give me a spirit of integrity godly and integrity you know I never want to sin against you help me Lord and if you helped Abimelech to do it how much more will he help us a heathen King right he only knows about the Living God but see we have the revelation of the Living God and that God supposed to be living in our souls amen how much more should we live lives of integrity than a man in the Old Testament that's right so every symbol works out scripturally by the grace of God alright do you like that one a true believer joyfully trades all of his possessions at the surprising opportunity to gain Christ let me go a few murmurs let me do one more here I got to be out about 15 minutes here good all right let's do the one pearl of great price then we'll be done here now here is the other side for those that were searching so the other one is surprising right you surprisingly find this parables about you're actually searching for it now this this kind of feels like me too like this feels like me like when I stumbled upon the message but this feels like me when I was in denominations I had some pretty good pearls but there's one pearl that was better than oh praise God there's one that I I want that one more than anything else so that's the revelation if my one sentence sentence summary summary hears a true believer abandons his search for many spiritual truths in order to gain the one the most valuable truth Christ so that's in Matthew 13 45 and 46 so let's go there and I do have a new member I had a few quotes on this from brother branham yeah so read those in just a minute here but let's read the scripture again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls I notice that he's already seeking them that was silent that was probably some of you right right you were seeking after truth and then you found the message some of you weren't some of you more like Oh someone upon it what a surprise totally changed my life just shocked me but this man wasn't he was seeking for it praise God who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it so no matter which experience looks like yours they both have something in common that everybody's got to sell out your previous life in order to gain Christ hey man hallelujah there's a quote we're programmed says listen I know my redeemer lives I want to have an experience now in this Easter morning I can say anytime through life yes I was seeing a little old block Tabernacle one beautiful Easter morning God raise up the curtain I looked at pass I seen my church didn't mean very much I seen there was nothing on earth that very much meant to me any more there I sold out everything I had I bought the pearl of great price I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior I now raised my hand Lord God be merciful to me God I want to look past the curtain of time would there be another before just closing now amen here's another he says he's talking about receiving the Holy Ghost I know many don't think I lost my mind even my good old righteous mother that died a few years ago when I first received the Holy Ghost there was no one in our country knowing anything about it I was just a little local young Baptist preacher about 20 years old but when I received the Holy Ghost my mother said that boy has lost his mind see but no matter what mother thought I had found the pearl of great price amen it might have seen like that to her but to me it was real see it was it was the genuine something that I had found in God oh thank you Lord amen see people think you're crazy but you found the pearl of great price I found it thank you Jesus a oh I know I found it hallelujah I said I said like this I've been in the denominations I've been out there in the mega churches they don't have it they don't have it we got it by God's grace we got the life of Christ it's exactly right and I'm not saying anything negative I'm just saying we got it it's different it's a different life I'll leave that one up there hear this one few more minutes here let us call it let me go on some of the symbols here okay so this one is not about suddenness in this parable Jesus illustrates how God satisfies those who are actively seeking many pearls by letting them discover the ultimate puerperal and there's Bible examples of this so just wait you hold your horses here I'm gonna get it the first symbol show a merchant man seeking many pearls meaning someone who's actively searching for religious or spiritual truths the man is not a careless or wicked man see but one who has been awakened and is sincerely looking for truth pearls always represent valuable beautiful and rare treasures in Scripture always as Matthew 7:6 says 1st Timothy 2:9 revelation 17:14 revelation 18 12 in revelation 21 21 in Matthew 7:6 Jesus said pearls are life-changing truce because he said give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast your pearls before swine lest they trample them under your feet and turn again and rend you see there came a time church when the disciples would share things with the Pharisees but after a while he got tired of it and said don't you share it let the blind lead the blind and don't cast your pearls your life-giving truce underdogs so it's ok like I think we've talked about this really a man I think we text about this so a year ago or something like that there it's okay for a while to share them the truce with people but when they start trampling under it and blasphemy it's time to let it go remember I think man was here I said that I was working member I was work with Benjamin for three years but on the fourth I stopped because that parabola the other that's the tree parable right give it three years I'm sorry two years right there was a parable of the the tree that wouldn't bring forth fruit he did it two years he said do it one more if it doesn't bring forth fruit in the third year and the fourth year cut it down and so that spoke to me on that night it was the Holy Spirit show me that I cut off brother Benjamin in the fourth year now but he's on his way back it looks like it's gonna work by Lord willing so you give an opportunity after - you give it chances right but you got to see some fruit at some point but then the Bible said cast not your pearls before the swine so pearls represent the life-changing truths of the Bible the revelations of the Bible okay so don't cast your pearls now what pearls that the disciples had they had the pearls that he was the Messiah they had pearls that they have authority to cast out demons right and all the revelations of Jesus that they had all the revelations they had he said don't give him any more and so see you got to see God when is that when is that when is that time come for you right when is that time come for you and your friendships and your family members when it's a time to cut it off so you got to lead you when it's that time now see now you can find valuable or moral teachings or pearls in any religion but especially Judaism right speaking of Moses law Paul says the law is holy the commandments holy and just and good you're gonna find some great pearls in the Old Testament right there's tremendous wisdom in the moral law of Moses yet there's one religion that's far above all others that's Christianity right because its founders if its founder offers complete forgiveness by grace power for living golly on this earth and unending eternal life amen see the pearl of great price typifies receiving Jesus Christ's spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it was the baptism was the mystery hid from generations and ages in memory Colossians 1 God's love will reward diligence he researchers because god only rewards those who search after him because he lets them discover the ultimate pearl the baptism Holy Ghost when a man finds this great pearl by hearing preaching about Jesus Christ he'll sell everything in order to possess it as seen in to clear New Testament passages so let's look at one well just for times sake we'll just I'll just read them over acts 19 is the first example these twelve Ephesian believers sold out their goodly pearls or their previous teachings the holy teachings they learn from John the Baptist a man that loved how the word interprets itself don't you acts 19 as believers they already believed John the Baptist message they got great pearls but they have to sell that out in order to gain Paul's message of the baptism of Holy Ghost hey man oh the word always interprets itself amen see that to sell it out Paul revealed to them there's one great pearl that's greater than John's baptism that was the baptism the Holy Ghost and the twelve quickly weary baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ and received the Holy Ghost treasure because the Holy Ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied hey man glory the Ephesians sold out John's baptism or moved on to the fresh revelation of the Spirit for their time period in order to possess the baptism of the Holy Ghost the one pearl of great price oh that's beautiful so they're the first example the second example is Paul Paul being converted from Judaism to Christianity Paul was a man who had to sell out all of his goodly pearls his moral teachings in order to gain the baptism of the holy ghost remember by Paul's own words he was blameless a hebrew of hebrews a dedicated devoted learned man with tremendous zeal for moses law but after once being in the supernatural presence of jesus christ his desires were transformed and he eagerly forsook his precious self-righteousness denouncing them as dung in order that he might win Christ amen and then after his conversion he received the pearl of great price the baptism of the holy ghost amen now listen how Paul describes the Pearl great price he says the pro great price he said I want to be found in him Christ not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that's which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the powers resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death see he was actively searching out truth in Judaism he was Pharisee of Pharisees praise God but then when he found the pearl of great price or the profound him he went sold out everything it's all done that I might have that one pearl praise God hey man here's the final thought I preached this before but I'm gonna preach it again so just me just bear with me give me five more minutes thank you lord thank you lord raise God so my final thought is this for me or thought you might remember me saying him it's revelation 21 21 and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was one pearl with of one pearl so they were huge massive pearls and the street of the city was pure gold as it was transparent glass here we see Christ future home the holy city the New Jerusalem the tabernacle of God which comes down from God out of heaven as the eternal abode after all sin death and hell are annihilated and forgotten this is the eternal city described beautifully and here's my brother BAM said he says every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace in Jesus love Oh so everything you look at everything we look at Church in that new city is gonna tell of his Amazing Grace and his love there's 12 gates three gates on each side of the four sides each made from a massive pearl so entering the holy city you must pass through a massive pearl of great price as a reminder of God's saving grace to you no wonder Christ will wipe all the tears from our eyes as we enter the city and then we rejoice in his mattress love story of redemption because passing through there will remember our life story we'll remember our deep desire and passionate longing to possess the ultimate treasure God's Spirit will remember his amazing grace to let us find that pearl of great price see our hearts will fear eternally grateful that we sold out the many goodly pearls of religious truth in order to possess the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the best word to describe this word I'm sorry the best word to describe this happy group is the word blessed because in Revelation 22 14 and 15 blessed are they that do His commandments that they might have right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates in this city for without our dogs sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie let's say in our feet praise God I'm closing with that by God's grace in that beautiful thought my ma'am as we walk in there we'll have to pass through the Pearl and that will make us remember when we found the pearl of great price Jesus Christ and that's exactly what the Bible says Jesus is the door praise God amen that's the door to the Eternal City and that's of course we know Christ is the door to eternal life praise got a musician's if you'll come here amen what a blessing praise God so I hope there's something in there you never saw before because I know there was a lot in there I'd never seen before - I sat down and meditated on it and look to the scripture to help define those things so let's as we bow our heads here let's bow our heads and let's think about this the treasure in the field the Pearl great price [Music] what a blessing praise God one the man is surprised he goes out and sells everything he has so you can have this great treasure another one the man's actively seized already searching for it but then he discovers the great price the pro great price in both parables they sell out they might have Christ hallelujah I said a prayer here Heavenly Father we love you tonight dear God we thank you for these words or help us to see this order to just make it fresh here tonight that what we have in us is an absolute treasure treasure in the field who's just hid there in the Old Testament layin there all those years we just happen to find it nor God like Phillip said we've found the Messiah comin see and we found boma but really it was God finding them Thank You Lord God like Simon when he first came and told me about the message but I found this message really it was you finding us preaching like John Piper I was seeking I was seeking good thoughts I wondered for this great privilege father Lord if there's anyone here Lord that needs to sell out anything what beautiful pictures you give us may we see the value of the treasure tonight may we see the value of just having one thing in our life that's really really important the baptism of the Holy Ghost may we see that Lord we we not seek little treasures Lord or little pearls of relationships or money or pride or any little other pearls may we just seek this one thing that I might know Christ in his power and the Fellowship of his [Music] sufferings that that'd be our testimonial do we find value in that one great thank you Jesus for these great teachings nor did he give us or not through me but north of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God what a tragedy we rejoice in the side thank you for allowing us to be a part of the kingdom
