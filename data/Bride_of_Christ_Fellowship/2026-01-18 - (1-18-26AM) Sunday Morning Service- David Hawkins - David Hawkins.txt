TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we'll be talking about this morning by God's grace if that's if he should lead that way. Um he could you never know he could he could always lead another direction but &gt;&gt; but praise the Lord. So this morning um if we'll we'll get ready to go into the scripture here. Um we'll be in 1 Timothy chapter 6. And this morning um this something that just kind of been on my heart. I I was trying to study a few different things but this is really what I felt like I couldn't get away from it here. So, I really I feel like these are the things the Lord put on my heart today. So, um I I trust it's it'll be edifying and that the Lord will be glorified uh through us this morning. Amen. And uh the Lord helping us. We'll be preaching on uh the real prosperity gospel. Amen. Don't don't don't start sweating on me, Brother Jesse. It's not the prosperity gospel, but the real prosperity gospel, sir. There's a there's a fake one out there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a real, too. Amen. And uh before we read the scripture from uh first Timothy, let's bow our heads and ask the Lord to bless the word here. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, how we appreciate you and we thank you for bringing us all here, gathering uh under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; uh to worship you, Lord, to hear from you, to hear your words, Lord, the wonderful words of life. Lord, we how we appreciate when you teach us, Lord, when you help us. You know what is needful, Lord, for our lives. We just pray that you'd uh uh sort this out to us and and give us ears to hear, Lord. Anoint the word that goes forth. I pray you'd help me to to be out of your way, Lord, and uh use me as a a tool in your hand, Lord. Just to bless your people, and uh anoint the people, Lord. Anoint our ears to hear and our hearts to receive, Father. And may we be helped and strengthened, encouraged, Lord, uh to help us stand in this evil day, Lord. We ask it for your glory. That you'd have your way and that uh you'd use all the gifts according to your will, however you would desire to do that, Lord. And uh that your anointing would be upon us, Father. All the working of your spirit in your house, Father, through your body. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. uh 1 Timothy chapter 6 and uh we'll read verses uh 3 to 12 and then uh 17 to 19. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; 1 Timothy chapter 6. Praise God. It's wonderful to be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for for bringing us here safe this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's been a lot of lot of nasty accidents on the road with the weather and things recently and we just we pray for them and we thank the Lord for bringing us here safely this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh starting at verse three of 1 Timothy chapter 6 here. If any man teach otherwise uh and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifees of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings. Amen. Is my is my microphone on? Can you hear me? Okay. Praise the Lord. Thank you. Thank you. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh verse five, perverse disputings of men, of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that God that gain is godliness. Amen. From such withdraw thyself. Amen. We know that's that's the the prosperity gospel that big megaurch pastors and uh and uh different people preach um that that gain is godliness. That's exactly what they preach. And then they they somehow they read this in the scripture and still continue to preach it. Amen. Because they love the money that they're receiving. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, "From such withdraw thyself." That's not the real gospel. Um you're not save you don't know you're saved because of how much money you get. Right? Amen. It's it's as simple as that. But what does he say here in verse six? But godliness with contentment is great gain. Amen. That's the gain. to be partakers of the divine nature through godliness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we know that the real gain is is godliness, partaking in in in godliness and and righteousness and true holiness. Amen. And uh it's gain isn't godliness. Godliness is gain. Amen. We we see Paul sort that out here. And uh and then continuing on in verse 7, he says uh for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. &gt;&gt; And having food and raignment, let us therewith be therewith content. &gt;&gt; But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare. Now, it doesn't mean it's wrong to have money. Amen. But what he's saying is they that will be rich, they fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and predition. Uh money to the flesh, money enables you to fulfill more lust of the flesh. Amen. Because in in this world, money is power in in this earth. Amen. But it doesn't money doesn't mean anything to God. Amen. That's not power with God. Praise the Lord. Uh verse 10, for the love of money is the root of all evil. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement. Amen. Which while some coveted after, they have aired from the faith and pierce themselves through with many sorrows. Amen. So money is actually uh remember there's three things brother Bham taught that that would uh draw uh ministers away and that's money, popularity, and women. He taught. Amen. And so money when people get to where they they love receiving it and love being wealthy, love having the the nicest things and and and taking care of themselves and and and looking better than other people and and they get used to that prestige, you know, we call it. And and some it actually pulled them away from the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if they if you continue in the true faith, your money belongs to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. You don't you can't in good conscience just use it all lavishly on your own to consume it on your lusts. Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and then he says uh verse 11, but thou, oh man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Amen. That that sounds better already. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Things that that pass that don't pass away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life. Amen. Not the not the not the stocks and and uh don't you don't need to lay hold on uh the the biggest paycheck. Amen. Or he didn't say lay hold on six figures. Amen. Lay hold on eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's that's the real thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where unto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. Amen. Skipping down to verse 17. Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded. &gt;&gt; Uh oh, that's that's a you know, I can't speak to to people personally. Um these the the megaurch pastors, you could say. I mean, um but if you maybe you've seen video clips or you know, you you have to be careful what you see. It could be hearsay or anything, but generally the attitude of some is we know for sure it's the attitude of some, maybe not all. But they're high-minded. That's a good way to describe it. What he says that they they think they're so above. Well, obviously, um, the Lord loves me because I have I have four limos and and a private jet and and look how big my church is. The Lord wouldn't increase my church to um, you know, 400,000 people or however much um, if if the Lord uh, didn't love me the most. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that's that's not what he's teaching here. That's high-minded. That's being puffed up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. I Let me tell you something. This church is rich in the in the spirit of God, not having um a thousand people. Amen. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's uh as long as we've been coming here and attending and and fellowshipping with brother Jesse and you all here, um the Lord is just as welcome here, probably more welcome here than a lot of other places. So it's not it's not about how much uh worldly goods the church has or the pastor has. Amen. We and we know this. Amen. This is is fundamentals of the of the faith here. &gt;&gt; But uh but it's needful. Amen. Praise the Lord. So verse 17, charge them that are rich in this world. They be not high- minded nor trust in uncertain riches. So that's what they're doing. They're trusting in their riches as a sign of God's approval. Amen. But what did brother Brandham say? He said, "Clear skies and sunny skies are not signs of God's approval, but neither are dark and cloudy skies signs of his disapproval." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he said, "But that they do good." Um, oh, sorry. But then the living God, verse 17, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. &gt;&gt; Verse 18, that they do good, that they be rich in good works. Amen. Ready to distribute or share, &gt;&gt; uh, willing to communicate. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or take care of people, you know, and laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come. Amen. This isn't the time to come. This is the time now. But the time that's to come is in the the in the in the next in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That they may lay hold on eternal life. Amen. That again, he's pointing to eternal life as the gain. Godliness is the gain. Amen. The main thing, the prize. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Praise God. You It can't be bought or sold. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, um going to uh we'll read Philippians here. Um in chapter 3 of Philippians, uh we'll start verse 7. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to gain the heavenly treasures. Amen. Praise God. Amen. Excuse me. I had two scriptures written down here. Yes. Uh Philippians Yes. 3:7. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh even as is as it is meat for me to think uh this of you all because I have you in my heart. In as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. Uh for God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. Uh, and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment, that you may approve things that are excellent, that you may be sincere without offense till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. Amen. What did he say to to follow after? Amen. Uh, righteousness and um, you know, godliness, faith. Amen. These things that can't be purchased with money. Amen. and he said, "Lay hold on eternal life." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then, uh, going to the next chapter here, Philippians 4. Amen. We're looking, that's what we're looking to attain is, is eternal life and the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking toward. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. in Philippians 4 and starting at verse 10. He says, "But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that how that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity." Other words, they were trying to take care of Paul, but at the time they they just didn't have a way to to get their support to him. Maybe he was in in prison or they couldn't get somebody in the prison or something along those lines. Um, but he said, "Not that I speak in respect of one, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, there was to be content." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I wonder all the I wonder all the lessons maybe he had to go through that he had to learn that. Amen. You You don't always learn just by receiving knowledge, you know, from a textbook or something. But but to learn these kind of things has to be by experience. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I I wonder going from being a Pharisee of the Pharisees to being a a a hated apostle of Christ, servant of Christ, &gt;&gt; he had to learn in whatever state he was in, money or no money. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh food, food or no food, you know, meal or no meal. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I know the Lord provided uh but he said in whatever state that I am in right now, I can be content. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I've laid hold on eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. Excuse me. So he said, I'm I'm instructed. Amen. By what? By the words of the Lord Jesus. Amen. That uh Jesus talked about and and by his own example, his life. Amen. He who he didn't even have the money to to pay the tax. So he told Peter to go to go catch a fish and the fish would have the money. You know, Jesus didn't just have a pile of money laying around that just, you know, he didn't he wasn't taking people's money. Amen. &gt;&gt; He he wasn't that kind of prosperity gospel preacher. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He was the He was the real prosperity gospel preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Take no thought for tomorrow." Praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm instructed, he said, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. Amen. And I can do, this is another scripture, verse 13, that that they uh many people use, you know, out of context or use in the wrong way, but it says, I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me. These all things is to be abased, to be to abound, to be poor, to be rich, you know, and and what whatsoever state I am. Amen. I can do all of it through Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which strengthenth me. Praise God. He is our portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; And verse 14, notwithstanding, ye have well done that you did communicate with my affliction. Uh now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from ne Macedonia, no church communicated with me concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. Now these days, you know, we still communicate with with apostles that the Lord sends missionaries. um now that that the Lord sends, we still want to support them with offerings and and uh support there. And um so we still want to communicate to their need. Amen. The same way. Praise God. And verse 16, &gt;&gt; for even in Thessalonica uh ye sent once again unto my necessity, not because I desire a gift. See, there's there's the difference. Um but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. Amen. Not because he desired them to pay all your all the money you have. Just give it to me. Amen. And I'll I'll use it, you know, for the for the Lord's work. You know, uh but he said, "I desire that fruit may actually abound to your account." Amen. He didn't just desire a gift. It was all going to the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. To to invest in the kingdom of heaven. Amen. To win souls. That's what it was for. &gt;&gt; Amen. And remember Jesus promised that whosoever shall give uh to drink uh to to one of his disciples a cup of cool water in the name of a disciple. Amen. They shall no li and no wise lose their reward. Amen. Praise God. In verse 18 he says but I have all and abound. I am full having received of Apaproditis the things which were sent from you. And notice what he says an odor of sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God. Amen. Not just to Paul. Paul. It wasn't a sacrifice to Paul. Amen. It was support to Paul, but the sacrifice was to God. Amen. For the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh you know in Acts chapter 10, uh we read the story of Cornelius and um I really appreciate that story. And it says that he he gave alms and prayed always. Amen. That he was a a devout man unto God. Now him being uh I believe he'd be a Roman. Amen. He was a uh he was um not a Jew, but still being a devout man. He was a gentile. &gt;&gt; Um but still he served the Lord. Maybe he saw the things that Jesus did and he recognized there was something real and and he thought that's the God that I want to serve. The the God of the Israelites is God. Amen. I want to serve him, too. Amen. And so he was devout, not even not knowing the whole gospel. Amen. He didn't even know. All he knew is he needed to serve God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that his alms and his prayers actually came up as a memorial before God. &gt;&gt; So God saw it and he looked on it and and actually the Lord chose him and his house to be the first Gentiles to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And isn't that a wonderful reward? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because the Gentiles before then, the Jews looked at them as dogs. Amen. But uh God gave Peter the vision, remember, of the unclean animals that uh that God told him, "Don't call unclean what I have made clean." Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. He made a way for us to to us to be clean and and receive the Holy Ghost, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank the Lord. But it actually is a is a like Paul said, an odor of a sweet smell. It's something we can actually do for God. Amen. A sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God. Praise the Lord. That's what that's what I want to do. Amen. That's what I want. Amen. And uh realize God blessed in Cornelius's case, God blessed his soul. Amen. Not his not his bank account. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Which he can he can bless both. Amen. He he'll provide all our needs. Amen. And some people he entrusts with more than others. Amen. But the main thing, Amen, is is is your soul being rich before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Laying hold on eternal life. That's the main thing. Amen. But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the prosperity gospel. Amen. The real the real prosperity gospel. Praise God. And uh in Matthew chapter 16, uh Jesus says from starting in verse 24, uh he says uh then said Jesus to his disciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Oh boy. That's that's different from the the fake prosperity gospel mindset. Amen. They don't deny themselves. They indulge themselves. Amen. They they use their money to fulfill the lust of their flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he instructs them to deny themsel. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself. Take up his cross. Amen. A cross is not a pleasant thing. Amen. He didn't say, "Let him take up his Lamborghini and follow me." Amen. Take up his cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. the his the old things, the lust of the flesh are crucified. Amen. Done away with. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it. Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world &gt;&gt; and lose his own soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you gain every every model sports car you wanted, every expensive house you could want. Amen. If you gain you you have your own island resort. Amen. Whatever it may be. Um or let's bring it maybe to the to the middle class. If you just if you just make the six figures that you wanted or whatever it may be, you just get the house that you just couldn't live without. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you gain all that you wanted and thought you needed but failed to gain eternal life, what does it profit you? Amen. You've lost everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. For what is a man profited? if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul. Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you can get everything you want and still fail to gain the the most precious thing. Amen. It's eternal life. Amen. And and they you get to the point if you follow after money uh and you get and get and get and and spend and buy and acquire and and for all for the flesh, you know, and you get to the point where the only thing you want is everything you don't have. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's all that they want is what they don't have. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and then it just becomes a a lust that that can't be um can't be satisfied. Amen. Because they're and we've we've all heard it put this way. They're trying to fill their God-shaped hole in their heart with the things of the world. Amen. It's the wrong things. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only one thing that can satisfy that. That's the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's all all vanities. Amen. It's all vanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. and all the things of all the earthly things is vanity. Amen. And you know, I wonder uh if the if uh the the bigname um preachers and and uh prosperity gospel preachers that that spend so much time acquiring these things and and they've got, you know, um multiple accounts and and they're the CEO, you know, and and a big name and a reputation and I'm known all over the world. Amen. I'm Dr. Dr. Reverend so and so, you know, and and um and as as I think that's one way brother Brandon put it, um the holy Reverend Dr. Pope So and so or something along those lines and and um but they that's what they look for. They seek for um the certification and approval of man. Amen. And gaining all these these treasures and and that's what it is, approval of man. Amen. But they they fail to get the approval of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that the approval of God is his seal of the Holy Ghost. Amen. That he he approves your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I wonder in seeking all those things if they forgot to seek after righteousness and faith. Amen. And and and love and patience and meekness, all these things that that he he was instructing Timothy to seek after. He said, "But thou, oh man of God, flee those things. Seek after these things." Amen. Righteousness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. My throat always seems to get dry right when I get up to preach. Praise the Lord. That's all right. The Lord's gracious. Amen. And uh, Brother Brandham says this here in in uh, a sermon called Come Follow Me from uh, 63. He says a little story I heard one time uh, a man who was he was poor and he he always wanted to be uh, rich. It's a a little fairy story. So, he's it's he's using this fairy tale as an example here. So, understand that. It always stuck with me though. And one day he picked a flower and the flower was was magic. You know, in the in the in the context of a fairy tale, it was magic. He says, "And the flower answered to him and said, "You've been poor all your life." He said, "Now ask what you will and it'll be given to you." In other words, it granted granted his wishes. You know, kind of like a genie or something. But uh but he said uh that yonder's mountain would open up. This was his desire that he was telling this flower that could grant anything he wanted. He said uh that yonder mountain would open up. I could go therein and find all the gold in the mountain. And he said, "Well, you'll have to take me wherever you go. See, you'll have to take me with you. So, wherever I am, then you can ask what you will." And he walked to the mountain and the mountain opened up. He went in, the shelves was full of gold and diamonds, as the little fairy story goes. He laid the flower down on a a table or a rock and he he grabbed a great big gem. He said, "I I must go show this to my friends and now I'm a rich man. I have everything now. I must show this." And so the flower spoke. Uh but said, "You forgot the main thing." So he runs back in, picks up, says, "Well, maybe I'll grab a piece of gold. I'll get a piece of silver." He says, "Then I'll hurry out, tell the the people how rich I am, what all I've got." And he got to the door and the flower said, "But you forgot the main thing." Amen. So he runs back and and picks up and says, "Well, maybe I'll um sorry." He runs back uh again says, "In here we find all kinds of materials." So he picked up a stone. He said, "I'll go um take this stone and show the people what kind of stone this mountain is made of so I can come find my way back to it." See, he started out the door again and the flower for the final time said, "You have forgot the main thing." He said, 'Oh, shut up.' And see, he didn't want to hear it anymore. Forgot the main thing this flower was trying to tell him. And and and he ran out the door. And when he did, the door closed behind him with a flower on the inside. Amen. The main thing was the flower the whole time. Amen. See, the main thing was the flower. And being a being a a fairy tale, he says, using it as an example, um being drawn to the riches. All he wanted was the riches. He forgot the main thing. Amen. that that was that made him able to get what he wanted in the first place. And that was the flower. And and it would be a type of of Jesus who said, "Ask what you will in my name and it'll be done unto you." Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you ask a miss just that you can consume upon your own lusts. Amen. That won't be given to you. Amen. Because you ask it miss. Amen. But they they ask and ask and and desire these things to consume upon their lusts and forget the main thing the whole time is the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the main thing. They forget all about him. Amen. They they they leave him behind and uh and they use his name. Amen. But they leave him behind and and just use his name to get riches and glory for themselves, not for God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh we're all familiar with this here. The message to Leosia in Revelation um chapter 3:1 17 says because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. My thinking they're rich but he told them their real condition. Amen. And they were wretched in his eyes and miserable, poor, blind, naked. Amen. And that doesn't sound rich. Amen. They weren't rich toward God. In other words, &gt;&gt; verse 18, I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich, and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with Isaav, that thou mayest see. Amen. The the real treasure, the gold that's tried in the fire. Amen. But people don't want to be tried in the fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. In order to get something worth something, you've got to sacrifice something for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And um again in Revelation, we we read uh in the the messages to the churches, um all of them come with a with a reward. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a reward to the overcomer. Whosoever overcomes um in in each age. Amen. And um I'll just read through them here um from Revelation chapter 2 and three. Um, but it's the portion of the overcomer here. He says, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God." Amen. Notice the the notice what all these portions are. Amen. The tree of life. Amen. And then, he that hath an ear, let him hear of the spirit saith unto the churches. He that overcomemeth shall not be hurt of the second death. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, life. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the hidden mana. Amen. And will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. And he that overcomemeth, and keepeth my words uh my works unto the end. To him will I give power over the nations, and he shall rule over them or rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken into shivers. uh even as I received of my father. Amen. And I will give him the morning star. Amen. So what is what is he saying? What are all the overcomers receiving? What is their portion? It is the Lord Jesus himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The morning star. Praise God. The hidden mana, the living bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. To him that overcomemeth. The same shall be clothed in white raignment. I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels. Amen. What an honor that is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Him that overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out, go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then to him that overcomemeth will I grant to situ uh with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne. Amen. Praise God. The the portion the reward of the overcomer is the Lord Jesus himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there there is no greater reward there that you that there could be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the same way that he could swear by no greater because there was no greater. Thus he he also cannot reward any greater than himself. Amen. He is the reward. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is our portion. Amen. There's What else could we ask? Amen. What else could we long for? Amen. Other than that, Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reward of the soul. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother. Appreciate that. Amen. And uh in Lamentations um chapter 3 and verse 24, he says, "The Lord is my portion. saith my soul. Amen. Not everybody can say that. Amen. Unless you're sure. Amen. Unless you've accepted the Lord and obeyed the Lord, then you can say like like he says here in Lamentations, the Lord is my portion, saith my soul. &gt;&gt; Therefore will I hope in him. Amen. Not trusting in uncertain riches but in God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um and brother Brandon, I'm here in in uh in a message called birth pains. Uh here he tells um the interpretation. He gives the interpretation of uh one time a a Baptist brother came up on the platform to greet him and um and the Lord anointed him, opened his mouth and he he uh spoke a message in tongues uh to brother Brandham. And uh of course we know it as as the uh as the harder way, you know, um &gt;&gt; quote here. And so this is the interpretation of that. But notice what the Lord wanted to tell brother Brandham here. &gt;&gt; Amen. that because thou hast chosen the narrow path, the harder way, thou hast walked of your own choosing. Praise God. It is a choice, brothers and sisters. Amen. &gt;&gt; That thou has picked the correct and precise decision. Amen. &gt;&gt; And hearing that from the Lord himself. Amen. Amen. We'll hear it, too. Amen. Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we long to hear. Now, it's made the correct decision. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to choose. Uh and it is my way. Amen. Because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of heaven awaits thee. What a glorious decision thou has made. Amen. I have I have decided to follow Jesus. Amen. No turning back. &gt;&gt; Amen. No. None. Go with me. Still I will follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a glorious decision you've made if you've decided to follow Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; This in itself is that which I will give and make to come to pass. The tremendous victory in the love divine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful? That's that's the portion I want. Amen. He said a huge portion of heaven awaits the the the biggest portion of heaven he could have is Jesus Christ. Amen. The the portion of the overcomer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know he'll also receive a prophet's reward. Whatever that is. We I I don't know at least on this side exactly what that is, but but um but we know he'll receive it. Amen. But we will also receive the greatest reward, Jesus Christ. Amen. Forever eternally. Amen. Our our light, our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh we read this in the in the church age book in the Smyrnian church age here and uh in the new book that was printed to be uh paragraph starting at paragraph 31. Amen. But it says I know thy poverty uh but thou are rich. And this is the the uh message to Smyrna here. There it is again. Uh see him walking up and down in the midst of the church like a father. He is looking down upon his family. He is the head of his household. He is the provider. He is the protector. Uh yet he looks on on at their poverty. Oh, how the untutored believer stumbles at this. My how can God bear to look upon his own in a time of need and not just stop it all, just give in and lavish every material thing upon them? Amen. That's how carnally people think. And that's why they fall for the prosperity gospel. Amen. Because they think that gain is godliness, not realizing that that godliness is gain. Amen. Yes, sir. Here is what you have to believe again or where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God. This too is needful. Remember he admonished take no thought for the tomorrow what ye shall eat or what you shall put on. Your father knoweth the things uh ye have need of. He who clothe the lily of the field uh and feeds the sparrow shall do much more for you. These physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life. For a man's life consisteth not of the things he possesses, &gt;&gt; but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all material necessities will be added unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice it's not not all material wants. Amen. It's the necessities. Amen. He knows what you have need of. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because what heart wants, Jesus said, the heart is deceitful above all things. &gt;&gt; It wants what the flesh wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. But but that's not what is needful. Amen. &gt;&gt; And but look what he says here. This struck me when I when I read it. The people of God are not material-minded. They are Christminded. Amen. They want the things of Christ. Amen. Who who cares if we have an a nice car or or uh you know a a mansion here on earth? Jesus didn't have anywhere to lay his head on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he was despised, he said, "You will also be despised." Amen. Not that again, not that we can't have houses. Thank the Lord we we have houses and roofs over our head. Thank the Lord we have vehicles to get us here and there and for places. Thank the Lord for those things. But that's not the main thing. Amen. Remember the main thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They do not seek the treasures that are below. They seek those above. It is absolutely true. The majority of Christians are not wealthy. Uh rather they are on the poor side. Usually he says uh it was so in Jesus's day. It was true in Paul's day and it should be true today. And then he says, "Oh, it's not too true today for the Leoysian age is one of vast wealth where often the criterion of spirituality is an abundance of earthly goods." Amen. That's how they measure the blessings of God as their their physical goods, their earthly goods. Amen. &gt;&gt; But my how rich the church is in goods, but how poor in spirit, &gt;&gt; but not the not the poor in spirit Jesus was talking about because he said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, &gt;&gt; but but poor or lacking in the fruits of the spirit." Amen. And the power of the spirit. They're lacking. They're poor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed are be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink. It is not material. It is within us. &gt;&gt; A rich man is rich in God, not in worldly things. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, cries the spirit. I see your poverty. I see your need. Amen. Don't ever think he doesn't see it. Amen. He says, I see your need. You haven't very much if anything to boast of. What you did have has been taken from you. You gladly gave up your possessions in ex in exchange for eternal ones. Amen. You are laughed at. You are scorned. You don't have material resources to fall back on. But you are rich in spite of it all. Your security lies in him who is your shield and exceeding great reward. Praise the Lord. Amen. I I have that one highlighted. I just highlighted in the office there. Amen. Who is your your security lies in him who is your exceeding great reward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not what they call securities and and stocks and bonds. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's the real security. Eternal security. &gt;&gt; Amen. Assurance. Blessed assurance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine. &gt;&gt; Heirs of salvation, purchase of God, born of a spirit, washed in his blood. Amen. Praise God. That's the main thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, "Your kingdom is yet to come, but it will come and it will be an everlasting one." Yes. I I am mindful of your trials and woes. I know how hard it is to get along. But I will remember all of this when I return to claim you as my own. Amen. And then I will reward you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice what he says here. This is nothing against rich people &gt;&gt; because God can save a rich man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus just said how hardly it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; But God can save a rich man. Nothing against rich people. He says, "Some of God's children are rich." Again, like we said, God entrusts sometimes more to some people than others. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that is not the standard of of their condition of their soul with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But money can be such a snare. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Amen. Not only to those who have it, but to those who don't have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Way back there in the first age, James cried out to those who were putting stock in wealthy people. Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons. The poor there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in God. &gt;&gt; Don't do it, says James. Don't do it. Money isn't everything. Money isn't the answer. And today, it is not the answer either. Amen. That's that's the point we're trying to get to. Amen. We have more wealth than we have ever had. And yet less is being accomplished spiritually. Amen. Look at the the conditions of churches, you know, in general, the national church. Amen. The global church, the condition is it's so sad. Amen. What they're focusing on. Amen. Getting themselves a name, having the best the best uh musicians and songs and um their their churches uh selling music and and um selling their their uh sermons or courses. Oh, just take this course. Learn even some of them. I've seen some of them that learn how to be a prophet. Take this course in order to learn how to be a prophet. Amen. And you'll be blessed, too. And it's like, well, that's that's not what the scripture teaches. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture teaches the Lord gives gifts severally to whom he will. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now, um, he says, uh, money isn't the answer. Um, yes, less less is being accomplished spiritually. Amen. How many souls are being saved and and sealed into the kingdom? &gt;&gt; Yes. by by pastors gaining all these wealth all this wealth you know by taking all their money is that is that giving them eternal life amen by by taking their livelihood &gt;&gt; absolutely not that's that's hogwash we call it sir &gt;&gt; praise the lord it is not with money that god works again he can use it but it's not with money that god works he moves by his spirit &gt;&gt; and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word. Amen. That's why they forsake the word and and take uh monetary gain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They take money. They serve mammon and not god because you you can only serve one or the other. You can't serve both. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. And I This is skipping down here a few paragraphs. Um and I will give thee a crown of life. Since not even a cup of cold water given in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward, how great shall be the reward to him who gives his life as a martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crown uh with the crown one in a race. In 1 Corinthians 9:24, Paul says, "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain. &gt;&gt; Amen. A crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a garland of olive branches. But the crown spoken of here in Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty. Amen. Jesus calls it the crown of life. The one crown is for those who have striven. The other is for those who have given. &gt;&gt; Both crowns are incorruptible. Amen. That's the that's the crown we're looking for. And not not even to gain a crown. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that the Lord Jesus is the one who gives it. Amen. and we'll be with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He I'd give my crown to him. Amen. He He's the one that that deserves it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's just It's only by his grace that we overcame it all. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Both crowns are incorruptible. They will not perish. The winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plot of the world. Their glory will fail. But those who give their lives for God, either by daily striving, Amen. or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the crown of life. Praise the Lord. Then watch what he says here. Amen. This is this is a main point here. I have this highlighted. All too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of God. Amen. Too little time we spend gaining the eternal things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And maybe sometimes we sometimes it's hard to balance. Amen. Like when we think of work and church. Amen. Um, it's necessary to work, &gt;&gt; but it is more necessary to be in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not that it's not necessary to work, but if you sometimes it's needful, sometimes um our jobs just um once in a while maybe there's a way a reason that out of our control we can't make it to church, you know. But if if uh I hope it's okay to say this, if your job keeps you out of every church service every week, that's not the job the Lord has for you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God's will is for you to be assembled together and not forsake the assembling of yourselves together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you're if it's between your job and church, Amen. It's time to find another job. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope that's all right to say, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But um there's I I know a brother that's that's going through a situation similar to that right now. Amen. That he was praying um he had a job out of necessity. It was it was the job he had at the time to provide for his family. and um and he he uh he was praying. He said, "Lord, I' I'd really like to make it to church. I don't like missing church." So, he was praying about it. And he actually lost that job. And um and it was a rough time for him, but now um the Lord has provided him another job that is um his uh he testified that it's all that they were looking for. Amen. That that he can still make to the church, still provide for his family. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so if you commit it to the Lord, it'll be a trial going in between, you know, when you don't have the job. Amen. That that's that's the trial. Amen. But that's where trusting the Lord comes in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And knowing in your heart that what you're seeking is to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. That is good and right in the eyes of the Lord. That is that is what he wants you to seek. Amen. &gt;&gt; To to to keep his words, to do what he said. Amen. To to seek his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Um, all too little time is spent on laboring for the for the eternal rewards of God. The recompense of God is too lightly esteemed. My that is how true that is. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal kingdom of substance, then we ought to lay up in heaven those good treasures that are available to faithful saints. Amen. Lord, let me be found a faithful saint. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be faithful to Jesus. Amen. That's that's worth laboring for. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is worth it. That's worth my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh the he says the eternal rewards of God. Amen. Um again, the the things that don't pass away, righteousness. Amen. Peace, uh joy, the eternal life, escaping eternal separation from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Eternal separation from love and all all good things. Amen. escaping that and and and gaining everlasting peace, amen, in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the eternal rewards of God. Amen. To those that love him and and overcome and keep his commandments. Amen. Praise the Lord. That's the things we ought to seek after, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in in Luke the 12th chapter, uh Jesus says here starting at verse 15. And he said unto them, "Take heed and beware of covetousness." And what's covetousness? We know one of the commandments is thou shalt not covet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Um thy neighbor's possessions or his wife. Um but covetousness is wanting something that belongs to something else. In other words, it's another form of lusting. It's it's it's lust. &gt;&gt; Um now there's there's a good form of coveting. Is that right? Covet covet the best gifts. Amen. Desire the best gifts. Amen. But this, but beware of covetousness, for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's what the prosperity gospel, the false one, teaches. Amen. That your life does consist of the abundance of things you possess. &gt;&gt; Right? Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And he spoke a parable unto them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. And he thought within himself, saying, "What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?" And and he said, "This will I do. I will pull down my barns and build greater, and there I will bestow all my fruits and my goods." Uh, and I will say to my soul, soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years. Uh, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. Amen. He had everything, everything he wanted. It was taken care of. He now all he had to do was relax and enjoy it. Amen. And um or so he thought. Amen. So he he he just was going to eat and drink and be merry. Uh but God said unto him. Amen. Verse 20. Thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee. Amen. Then whose shall these things be which thou hast provided? Uhoh. He he forgot to worry about his soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was so busy gathering into his barns and all his riches. He said, "Ah, it's all it's all taken care of now. we can relax and and sit sit back and and watch the game and and uh and not worry about anything. Amen. It's all taken care of. But he forgot the main thing. Amen. That was his soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; God called him a fool because he forsook the main thing, eternal life and and gained worldly pleasure pleasures instead. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He forsook his own mercy. Amen. Because he observed lying vanities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God. Amen. That's the riches we're looking for. To be rich toward God. Amen. To buy of him gold tried in the fire. Amen. That fadeth not away. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said to his disciples, therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life what you shall eat, neither for the body what you shall put on. uh don't worry if you have the uh silk suit and and um and and and and the best name brand shoes and and uh you know he said take no thought for any of that. He said the life is more than meat and the body is more than raignment. Amen. Consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap uh which neither have storehouses nor barn and God feedth them. How much more are ye better than the fowls? Amen. And which of you um excuse me, consider the ravens, for they neither sow, neither uh nor reap. Sorry, I lost my place there. Um which neither have storehouse nor barn, and God feedth them. How much more are ye better than the fowls? Amen. &gt;&gt; And which of you There we are. And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? Amen. Can you are you able to by by thinking by mind over matter? Amen. Make yourself able enough to overcome uh every struggle. Amen. Or can you just &gt;&gt; uh manifest enough by meditation riches into your bank account? No, you you can't do it. Amen. That's beyond your power. So if you don't have power over it, Jesus said, um, if you then be not able to do that which is least, I mean to God that's a light thing, but you don't have power to do that in yourself. &gt;&gt; Why take ye thought for the rest? Amen. As if you can do something about it yourself. Amen. But consider the liies, how they grow. They toil not, they spin not. And yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothed the grass which today uh is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, oh ye of little faith. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And seek not uh seek not ye what you shall eat or what you shall drink. Neither be ye of a doubtful mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's Lord help me. Sometimes I have such feel like I have such little faith when I when something maybe &gt;&gt; maybe a real example. Sometimes if something goes wrong in the car. Amen. Right now my thank the Lord we got here safe. I trust we'll get home safe. But your car just sometimes starts making noises. You don't know what it is. You're like, "Oh no." &gt;&gt; You know, as soon as you hear it, you have a doubtful mind. Is that right? &gt;&gt; But we ought to trust the Lord. I mean, if he provided the vehicle for you, then uh then he'll take care of you. &gt;&gt; If I I trust if the Lord didn't want me to be here, he would have maybe the car would have broke down. We wouldn't be here. But he did want us to be here. So he he uh he allowed the car to keep going. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But um he says, "Neither be of a doubtful mind." Amen. For all these things do the nations of the world seek after, and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things. Amen. Like we were saying earlier, don't think that he doesn't see your afflictions. Amen. You think he doesn't know that he he forgot to to check in on you and and he doesn't realize that the bills are coming up and and you're you're a few dollars short, you know, &gt;&gt; and you think he doesn't see that that you you maybe you don't know how there's going to be bread on the table. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't think that he doesn't know. Amen. He sees he sees all of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He does know. And not only does he know, he cares about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. He cares. Praise God. Do you care? Amen. &gt;&gt; Um your your father knoweth you have need of these things, but rather seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you. Now, at first, when somebody hears that, maybe for the first time, they would think that that's crazy. See, why would I seek something I can't see and forsake things I can see that I need? You know, I I need clothes. I need food. You know, that's that's crazy. I can't do that. But remember, Jesus set the example himself of how to do that. Amen. He He made himself poor. Amen. Lowly, having not even a place to lay his head, you know, and and having not didn't even I'm sure didn't even have a bank account, you know, you know, didn't probably didn't own his own. He owned the cattle on a thousand hills. Amen. But the man Jesus, the flesh, Jesus, didn't have a scent to his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was poor so that he could come to the poor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? But he was he was an example of that. So he wasn't just saying it um that that you do this and uh and um I don't need to, but you need to, you know, but he came to fulfill all righteousness, right? Um &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; to to show us our example, our example. Amen. Of of how we ought to be in spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want his mind to be in us. Amen. His the attitude of Christ. Amen. And his humility to be in us. Amen. how much more humble we should be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But rather, seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean all the all the sports cars you want will be added unto you. All these things Jesus was talking about. The body is more than raignment. The the the the things the necessities. Amen. These things will be added unto you. The um David said, "I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging for bread." Amen. that uh how he says that there I was thinking um he says but rather seek ye the the kingdom of God. I was thinking when I read that that of that game, there's a little game, you know, people play would you rather, you know, and they present different different uh questions here, you know, like would you rather get stung by a scorpion or or stung by a by 20 bees, you know, whatever. And uh just random things like that, just uh whatever. But I was thinking on a more serious level of that, would you rather seek the kingdom of God and gain the heavenly treasures or forsake all of that and seek earthly treasures which today are and tomorrow is nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's the ultimate would you rather. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this one's not a game. Amen. &gt;&gt; This one's not this one's not foolishness. Amen. This is serious. You must consider this, brothers and sisters. Amen. &gt;&gt; What What do you rather Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is more needful? Praise God. &gt;&gt; Seek the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not. Verse 32. What a promise this is. Amen. Fear not, little flock, for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sell that ye have and give alms. Provide yourselves bags which wax not old. A treasure in heaven that faileth not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupteth. Amen. That treasure is something no one can take away from you. Amen. Someone might break into your house and take your last dollar. Amen. But they they they can never break into heaven and take your name out of the book. Amen. Praise God. No one can take you out of his hand. Praise the Lord. Amen. That that that faileth not. Hallelujah. Amen. Neither moth corruptth. For where your heart is, verse 34, there will or for where your treasure is, excuse me, there will your heart be also. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't lay up your treasures down here, brothers and sisters. Amen. This is this is this isn't a solid investment down here. Amen. Because today it is, tomorrow it isn't. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That reminds me of old song. Amen. Um I don't know how many of you here know him, but I know Brother Jesse knows Brother Jack back home. Um Brother Jack Hall, and he sings uh his song he's he's known for singing there is hold to God's unchanging hand. Amen. And uh that's the song I was thinking of when I was reading this that um uh covet not this world's vain riches that so rapidly decay but seek to gain the heavenly treasures for they will never pass away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. Build your hopes on things eternal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hold to God's unchanging hand. Praise God. They will never pass away. &gt;&gt; Glory. Aren't you? We should be thankful, amen, that that we know that there's something eternal. Amen. We're not we're not just, oh man, I I I just hope it's true, you know, because everything he's said for all the all the years the earth has been here from creation till now, everything he said, he's done. Amen. He's kept his word. He's been faithful. Amen. He's he's never once lied. It's impossible for God to lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. His immutable promises. Praise the Lord. So So why would he lie about this? Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "In my father's house are many mansions. If it weren't so, if it weren't so, I would have told you." Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He He told us the truth. Amen. To comfort our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "If uh then I I go to prepare that place for you." Amen. And if I go, I will also come again. Amen. That that where I am, there you may be also. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's the reward. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't lay up your treasures down here, brothers and sisters. No, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a It's an investment. What are you investing in? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You're either investing in worldly goods or in heavenly goods. It's it's one or the other. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But but make the glorious decision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Choose the correct path. Choose his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's my way." What a glorious decision thou made. &gt;&gt; Praise God. For here we have no continuing city. Is that right? But we seek one to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we plainly declare that that we seek a country. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I you know having no continuing city here it's for me myself um I'm a uh I tend to be a sentimental person you know and I I have a hard time throwing away notes and things people give me and and stuff and and it's hard sometimes for sentimental people not to get attached to things you know on in this world and uh but you know one day our our houses you know I I I have an attachment um just to to the house where I grew up and I was sad when we moved and you know and uh we were there for a long time. That was all my childhood memories were and and all that and we just get attached to things here and and brother Brandham tells this in his life story too how he would drive he would go and try to find that old cabin he grew up in and one day it just wasn't there anymore. It was knocked down and and there was something else they were building there and developing the area and but we don't want to get too attached to things here. It's hard, you know. We have memories. We have have have uh good things that, you know, hopefully we have good memories, you know, &gt;&gt; and people we love, uh things that we love, you know, and and we get attached. But here, brothers and sisters, we have no continuing city. These things are going to pass away and fail. But over there, there won't even be a a remembrance of it. It'll be the the good things that we think of in the past here won't even be worthy to compare with the good things over there. Amen. We'll be rejoicing so much we won't even the the old things will all be passed away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And and that won't even end. It won't be a memory. It'll be all the time rejoicing, praising God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's hard for sentimental people sometimes because we get we just get caught up, you know, oh man, I I miss this. I you know I I missed the old place, you know, things like that. And uh but don't caught don't get caught up in that, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just we got to look ahead and and seek the heavenly treasures. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're we're this world is not my home. Amen. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somewhere not here. Amen. And I'm glad it's not here. Amen. Because today it is, tomorrow it isn't. You know, houses can burn down. Um treasures can be stolen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But not that treasure. Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Uh, brother Bham says this in things that are to be uh from 65. He says, "Now remember uh we think so much of this body uh we put so many clothes on it. We do so many things that unnecessary change after change after change all these things. And it's just everybody." And he says, "I don't care whether my coat matches my trousers. I I have a hard time. my wife or my daughter-in-law, someone have to tell me what kind of tie to wear with it. I don't care whether they match, though. I want my experience to match God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's the thing because that's where I aim to live. Not down on the corner yonder with the Joneses, but yonder in glory where Jesus is. Praise the Lord. Gone to prepare us a place. Yes, we want that. Yes, sir. Keep from all this. Amen. this old earthly tabern tabernacle here. Forgive me if I'm speaking fast here. I'm just trying to get in. I feel bad last time. I I I went over two hours, I think, and I didn't even realize it. Forgive me. I We want the Lord to have his way, but we also need to use wisdom, you know. And um &gt;&gt; it was good, brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We just ultimately we just want the Lord to have his way. Amen. We don't want to put a time limit on God, but but we do want to be be wise and not wear out people, you know, and uh just get the point across. So, so uh praise the Lord. Anyways, um this old earthly tabernacle here, you know what it is? This body is like an old coat that you wear, a coat that you once wear, &gt;&gt; but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore. What do you do? You hang it in the closet, but you've got one better. You've got a better coat. It's more up to-date than the one you used to wear that's worn out. Thank the Lord there's going to be an up-to-date coat for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not not the old one. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Uh what it's it is that garment you are inside that there. That garment only done what? It bore your image. See? But you don't need it anymore. Now you've hung it up. It's a rag. Amen. And that's the way this whole body is. It bore uh it bore the image of the heavenly yet it is not you. You are on the inside of that body. You and the spirit of God is on the inside of that body. That's what makes the the outside come into subjections because the inside is pulling it. See bringing it in line with the word of God. Your inside yourself uh your being. This this body is just an old coat and someday what will you do with it? Um for you it's only in the garment for a while. That is like the earthly garment. This body, your real body, your real self self is on the inside of this old coat that you call William Brandham or Susie Jones, you know, or David Hawkins, you know, or whatever it is. See, someday it'll hang in the earthall of memory of you. You'll you'll put it out yondering the grave and somebody will put a tombstone up. Here lies Reverend so and so or John so and so. It'll lie there as a memorial of you. Um the people just seen you in this, right? and and and what you was your real you was on the inside of that. But the old coat itself just borne the image of the heavenly. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh people, have you made your reservation to change coats?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you made reservations for heaven? Remember, you you must have reservations. You can't get in without them. Amen. Listen to that, brothers and sisters. You can't get in without that. Amen. He said, 'I'm talking to you in modern language now that you know if you go to the hotel, say, um, do you have reservations? Well, I'm sorry. Everything's filled up. You're out in the cold because you failed to make reservations. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you come to the end of your life's journey, Amen. Listen to this. If you come to the end of your life's journey without reservations, there will be no one there to meet you. Amen. You'll have to step off into a dark eternity where there will be screaming and weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. said you must you can't get into the city because you haven't got a reservation. &gt;&gt; You must have them to enter the city where Jesus has gone to prepare a place for you. Remember, you must have the reservations and the garment of salvation on. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the main thing. Don't miss the main thing, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't need reservations down here. Amen. But we're we want to be reserved there for when the time comes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That that we'll be accepted. Amen. Amen. And it's, you know, you can't afford not to have a reservation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I I urge you. I trust we all here are are saved. You know, I I I pray we are. If not, &gt;&gt; today is the day to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's still while there's still blood. Amen. Still still a way made. Amen. &gt;&gt; Today is the day. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you haven't made reservation, get it now. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say space is limited, but time is limited. You know, usually that's how they're advertised. Reserve now before it runs out. But but time is limited here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to get in before the coming of the Lord because after that you'll you'll seek for the Holy Ghost, it won't be available. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When the when the when the bride is gone, it's she's gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Make reservations, brothers and sisters. Amen. Make sure. Double check. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ground your faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's it's it's worth all that we have. It's worth it. Amen. And Jesus said again here in Matthew 13, um a parable. He's talking here about the kingdom of heaven. He says, "The kingdom of heaven," verse 34, Matthew 13, he says, "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and sellth all that he hath, and buyth that field." Amen. everything he had. There was something in that field that was worth more than everything he possessed. Amen. He put it all behind him. Cast it away. Amen. He sold it. He said, "I would rather have this than this." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how sad it is. Sometimes people will do the opposite. They'll trade They'll trade eternal life just to have a few days of pleasure here on the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Seek to gain the heavenly treasures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls, who when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all he had and bought it. Amen. Praise God. It's It was worth more than the old things he had. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Forsaking all that is behind. Amen. Striving toward that that is before. Amen. Praise the Lord. In First Peter, the first chapter, we'll be winding down here by God's grace. 1 Peter uh chapter 1 and verse three uh it says, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again, thank the Lord. Unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, praise God, joint hes with Jesus, and undefiled and that fadeth not away." Praise God. &gt;&gt; Our vehicles, they fade away. You get them in a it seems in a couple years they just quit on you, you know, and your your house fades away after a while. It needs repairs. It breaks down, you know, after a hundred years it might just rot away, you know, but but this inheritance, Amen. incorruptible, undefiled, which fadeth not away. Amen. &gt;&gt; Reserved in heaven for you, a place prepared for you, brothers and sisters. Amen. who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, &gt;&gt; wherein you greatly rejoice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we rejoice, but sometimes here the gold has to be tried in the fire. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes it it's he said if need be. Sometimes it's needful. Amen. Don't you think the Lord knows what you need? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But sometimes it brings us heaviness, you know, um through manifold temptations. It's hard. &gt;&gt; It's a struggle. It's a labor. Amen. But the reward is worth it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The overcomers reward. Amen. It's worth it. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes, you know, when people suddenly face a hard time or they they all of a sudden there's a trial or a temptation, they think, "Oh, what what did I do? What did I, you know, I made God angry at me, you know, oh, you know, what did I do? Did I look at somebody the wrong way? You know, what did I do to to that I lost my job? You know, &gt;&gt; but maybe it's for God's glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's needful. Maybe it's if need be &gt;&gt; that you go through manifold temptations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I I'm thankful for the the the things the Lord brings us through. Amen. You you all heard my testimony. Amen. how the Lord sometimes he's got to get you in line. Amen. Get you into into shape. Amen. Praise the Lord. To to to take off the things that are not like him to to be molded into his image. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you know, it brings us it ought to if we have faith, it bring us closer to him. Amen. Through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the goal. Amen. That's what he's trying to he's trying to attain in us to to draw us unto himself to to look at him. Amen. Look at the shepherd. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. But it might be for God's glory. Um like the you remember the blind man Jesus healed the the disciples asked him and said, "Lord, was this man born blind because he sinned or his parents?" You know, whose sin was it that caused him to be born blind? But Jesus told him, he said, "It wasn't because of a sin uh that they committed um not because this man sinned or his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him." Amen. that God would get the glory from it. Amen. It was it was an appointed thing for him. Praise God. Um and here I this I love this quote right here from the good shepherd of the sheep uh from 57, excuse me. He says, "And what a relief. What a lovely thing to know that when we are tucked into his blessed keeping, he becomes the door. There's nothing that could happen to you. No matter what it is, it'll all have to come by the shepherd. If it's sickness, it might be for your correction." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It might be for a testimony against the enemy. It might be for the exaltation of Christ's name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But nothing can come to you except permits it to come. He's the door to the sheepfold. Amen. That's one of my favorite quotes right there. It's so personal to me because you've you've heard my testimony. I've seen that in my life. Amen. Praise the Lord. But nothing can come except he permits it. It might be for the exaltation of Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That uh and then going back to first Peter chapter uh one here verse 7 says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth. Amen. Though it be tried with fire, might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Amen. That's what it's all for. Amen. The the appearing of Jesus Christ, the rapture. Amen. Pleasing our bridegroom. Amen. That we can be taken into the into the marriage. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; If you you'd stand to your feet, brothers and sisters, we'll we'll close here. Um and whom having not seen, ye love. Yes. &gt;&gt; Though now ye see him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Receiving the end of your faith. In other words, the manifestation of your faith, the uh the uh the end or the goal of your faith, &gt;&gt; right? It's a means to an end. You say, you would say receiving the end of your faith, even salvation of your souls. Praise God. That shall that will be revealed in this last time. Amen. That's the main thing, brothers and sisters. Amen. The salvation of your souls. Lay hold on eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seek to gain the heavenly treasures. They shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the main thing. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Life. Eternal life. Escaping the eternal separation. Amen. That that that is the end of our faith. Praise God. There's the portion that awaits the overcomer. To him that overcometh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Don't you want to receive the Lord Jesus at the end? Amen. When he says, "Enter into the joys of the Lord." Amen. Prepared for you. Amen. That's our desire. Amen. The the things we suffer here and and experience here can't even be worthy &gt;&gt; to be compared. Amen. To the glory that we shall see. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's just I'm I'm so grateful that our reward isn't just a million dollars or, you know, or a billion dollars, a trillion, you know, it doesn't matter. I'm so glad it's not money that can just perish away. I'm so glad that's not that's not all we're striving for. Amen. But there's something eternal in the heavens. Amen. Prepared for you. There in my father's house are many mansions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Hold to God's unchanging hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Build your hopes on things eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Living with the Lord. Amen. The one who who loved me and gave himself for me. Amen. Let's bow our heads, brothers and sisters. Amen. If there's maybe there's struggles, you know, you're going through, you don't understand that maybe maybe it's something you've struggled with. Lord, why why can't I be rich? You know, how come other people seem to be blessed so easily and more than than I am? You know, how come they always just have to seem to be able to afford everything they they want and need? And maybe sometimes we get jealous and covetous maybe. But Lord, help us to to seek the heavenly treasures. Amen. To to be content in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content, to be instructed, how to be abased, how to abound. Amen. How to be fruitful in the in the fruits of the spirit. Amen. The real riches. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you if you need that that help from the Lord, you can if you want, you can raise your hand to the Lord or if you want, you can just raise your heart to him. But if that's your desire, just make it known to him. Say, "Lord, this is something I I needed because I've been looking to material things. I've been wondering why I haven't been blessed more materially. I thought maybe I did something wrong." And sometimes he will do things to correct you. We know that. But remember, the clear sunny skies are not a sign of his approval. And neither are dark skies and cloudy skies a sign of his disapproval. Is that right? Amen. But we want to seek to please him and to gain the reward. Amen. The portion of the overcomer. Amen. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul. Therefore will I hope in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, we how we love you. Our portion, Lord. Our reward that we're looking forward to, Lord. We're we appreciate that you've promised us a crown, Lord. But really, we're looking forward to just being with you, Lord, living with you eternally, Lord. Crown or no crown, Lord. We which we desire your promise, Lord. We we desire you, Lord. We desire to please you to attain Christ. Lord, we desire the heavenly riches, Lord. I pray that you'd you'd awaken us, Father. If we've if we've got comfortable in this world, Lord, we know we're we're in the Leoysian age, Father. But help us to be living separate from that, looking unto Jesus, the author and the finish of our faith. Amen. As our example, Lord, we we know you didn't on earth here. You didn't live in mansions. You didn't you didn't uh you didn't have all wealth and prosperity after the the world's goods. But Lord, you gave us an example to please God. &gt;&gt; That gain isn't godliness, but godliness is gain. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the the real wealth, the real treasures. Amen. Are not seen and handled with the hands here. But Lord, they are in heaven eternal in the heavens laid up for us. Lord, help us to seek that. Let us attain the portion reserved for faithful saints. Help us to be found faithful. Lord, help me to be found faithful, Lord. Father, I I pray that you'd help me sometimes. I I've struggled, Lord, with with wanting more material possessions, Lord, just for convenience sake. Or, Lord, just to have nice things. It's natural for the flesh to want that. But, Lord, let us put aside all the things that the flesh wants. Lord, we appreciate that which you give us, that which you allow us to have. We thank you for that. We pray you continue to provide our daily bread. Lord, we know you'll be faithful. But Lord, help us to look to eternal things. Father, I pray Lord if if there's anybody that hasn't yet made a reservation. Lord, I pray that this very day before the sun goes down, this very day while it is called today, Lord, that they would make a reservation in heaven, Lord, Father, that their name would be upon the book, Lord, that their soul would be right with you. that when their soul is required of them, not the riches, Lord, but when their soul is required of them, that they would be found rich toward God and the fruits of the spirit in faith and in believing. Amen. In pleasing God. Grant it, Lord, I pray. Help us to do this, Father. Help us to be rich toward God, abounding in good works, Lord. Not not that we're saved by works, but Lord, that men may see our good works and that you would be glorified. Father, help us. Teach us, Lord. Help us not to be uh attached to this world where we have no continuing city, but we seek a heavenly country whose builder and maker is God as the the seed of Abraham by faith. Amen. We declare plainly we seek a country. Lord, help us. Be with us, Lord. Help us, I pray. Be with our spirit, Lord. Hold us up by your grace and mercy. Lord, help us now. We pray. May this word, we thank you for your word. We pray now that it would help us and strengthen us and wake us up, Lord. And help us, Lord, just lead us into your will. Help us to forsake all, to follow thee, Lord, to deny ourselves, take up our cross. Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free. No, there's a cross for everyone. Amen. And there's a cross for me, Lord. Let me be found faithfully bearing my cross, Lord. following you, Father, into death, putting to death the old man, the lust of this flesh, which leads to death to to to spiritual death. But Lord, you've made a way that we can escape that. Father, you've reserved a a portion to believers. That's what we're looking to attain. Father, help us to run with patience and grace that we can that we can attain the prize to achieve the the mark of the high calling of Jesus Christ. Grant it now, Father, I pray I I commit these people to you, these words which you've you've given to your people this morning. I I felt this is what you laid on my heart, Lord. And it's it's the fundamentals of the gospel here. But Lord, we love that. We love your gospel. &gt;&gt; We love your words, Lord. We love your parables, your your teaching, &gt;&gt; your words. For you said, "My words are spirit and they are life." &gt;&gt; Lord, we desire more of your words, more of your life in us. Father, may each one leave here this morning full of joy, full of the Holy Ghost. Remove everything that hinders, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we
