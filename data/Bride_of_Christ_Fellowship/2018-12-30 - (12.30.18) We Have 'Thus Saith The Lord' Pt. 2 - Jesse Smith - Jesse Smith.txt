we exalt you Lord as we prepare for this next year rather bless our time in Jesus Christ's name let's take our Bibles here understand here like to go back to James chapter 5 like to continue this there's just a couple sermons on we have thus saith the Lord I like to continue that we looked at at Wednesday I like to finish that hopefully this morning this afternoon by God's grace James chapter 5 James chapter 5 verse 10 well it's reverse 7 that's kind of encouraging as we wait for the coming of the Lord no man knows the day of the hour but we know we're at very very close to the coming of the Lord whether that's 5 years 10 50 100 150 we know we're close to the coming of the Lord praise God James 5:7 be patient therefore brethren under the coming of the Lord how many can say amen to that being patient behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth that's that's you and I that's and that's everyone else whose name is still on the Lamb's Book of Life who's not yet born again he's waiting patiently for all those seeds and have long patience for until he received the early and the latter rain glory be II also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draws nigh grudge not one against another brethren lest she be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door let's read verse 10 together one two three take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an ample of suffering affliction and of patience amen let's just bow our heads one more time Father in heaven these are your words Lord God teach us today to be patient Lord we know you're very patient of course you have eternal patience Lord let us manifest that fruit of the Spirit is patience Lord let us manifest that that we can be patient until you receive the former and the latter we know the former's falling now Lord God and Lord the latter will be rapturing faith so father help us to be patient Lord God unto your coming Lord we know that you'll be with us Lord until either we go to the grave or meet you in the air and father were very grateful for that Lord teach us today remind us of your promises and speak thy truth to us in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you bein seated praise God I do have quotes today Lydia so we can pull those up here so I had some time to put some quotes together so you can see him how many like reading the quotes you like reading the quotes amen and I always do that I just think it's just a tremendous blessing to be able to see you exactly what brother Branham said I found it helpful to you know sometimes to go back and listen to how he preached him some of these will see today some of them they seem kind of harsh but if you listen to him he says it with a lot of love so while we're here let's just read a few I'm gonna just go over to the scripture let's go to proverbs 30 if you got your Bibles of course you can or you can read it up here I know I want to just lay this in here have these these these things kind of came on my mind just now so I want to pull them up we're gonna be looking of course at thus saith the Lord I'm gonna take the text up a little bit here that's all better don't look at these two quotes or these two scriptures rather not it's kind of small let me make it a little bigger here I'll just go max it out here okay I want to look at these here the Bible says in proverbs 30 verse five and six every word of God is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him now look at the warning add down not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar we're you know I don't know if everybody heard Wednesday night's service but it was just we're looking at statements where brother Branham we believe God's prophet said thus saith the Lord I want to look at some more of those today now if if brother Branham said anything that was thus saith the Lord outside of the word of God that'd be wrong but never in the years that I've studied brother Graham's message which is now coming on 18 years I've never heard him say thus saith the Lord and say anything wrong with it and that's why I believe he's a prophet but he's gonna make brother branham's gonna make some statements today through the preaching we'll see that that he points out where churches have added to the Bible and almost every church does this that's why most churches are not led of the Holy Spirit because they either add to the Bible and say well we should believe this or they take away from the Bible now we try to be and I know many churches say this I know there's millions of churches that say this but we try to really live it we don't try to add anything to the Bible or take anything away we just try to believe everything that's in here I know a lot of people say that but but if you start talking to him you're gonna find out that they do add to the word and they do take away from the word but we try not to do any of that because we know God is going to correct everyone who does and they're gonna be liars they're gonna be found liars if they did it maliciously now don't everybody will do it maliciously but many people do it maliciously in order to gain big churches or money or popularity or all these things but we do not and so the warnings in the Bible if you add to God's Word he's gonna call you a liar and we don't want to be liars we want to tell the truth now the Bible ends with the warning in revelation 22:18 the Bible ends with the same warning and so I want to pull it up here for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book now church sometimes those plagues happen while people are on the earth and they go through awful diseases or they go through awful situations but sometimes the people that add to the Word of God don't experience those plagues in this lifetime but they will experience them later when they're judged we'd say something the Bible said some men's sins go before them we know it in the book of first John some follow after and so some people won't experience that till after now look at verse 19 If any man shall take away from the words of the book of the prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book now that's very very dangerous if you say well that's in the Bible but you don't have to live it or that's not required anymore God has the warning here that he'll take your name off the book of life if you take anything out of the Bible so we don't want to add anything we don't want to take anything away we just want to meet God's requirement and do exactly what the Bible says and Jesus said surely I come quickly now here's what we all need even so let the grace of our Lord Jesus be with us amen how many trust in an amazing grace that's right so we have this great warning we cannot add to the Bible or take away so as we look at this message here we have thus saith the Lord as we look at this brother branham made many statements with thus saith the Lord in fact over 3,200 of them I've gone through all of them and I pulled out the ones that apply to the US now many of those most of those probably 3,000 of those applied to people in the prayer lines he would tell them thus saith the Lord or or maybe he was just teaching and said well you know this prophet said thus saith the Lord but I tried to pull out the ones that apply to us so we can make sure that we not only know thus saith the Lord but that we actually obey thus saith the Lord that's what we want to do how many one obey thus saith the Lord you know Ezekiel was the one in the Bible who said it most often of course all the prophets would say in the name of the Lord or thus saith the Lord but Ezekiel was the one who sent the most he said it over a hundred times thus saith the Lord the Lord tells me this the Lord tells me that that's why when we sing that song we sing these are the days of Elijah these are the days of Ezekiel amen because we've lived in a day where we've had a prophet a man named William Branham stand and say thus saith the Lord and you don't hear many people say that but we've Adam we've received a prophet that said thus saith the Lord and so I've just had all my heart to go back over these it's been a I've never preached them too you I don't think unless it was many many years ago so I've just had a burden to go back over it we started at Wednesday night now in part one a Wednesday we showed how the church is built on thus saith the Lord that is our foundation our foundation is God's own word delivered to us that's our foundation and we won over three of William branham's prophecies that are fulfilled or in the process of coming to pass we know we went over prophecies about the United States how the United States will not see a national revival there's no more national revival for the United States it's just little individual groups or little individuals that God is going to save they'll have revivals in fact they're part of the bride's revival but it will not be revival on a national scale that's nowhere in the scripture she's already had her chance and she took it down in 1933 William Brennan had seven major visions he said they were thus saith the Lord it seems like four or five of them have already come to pass and so there's remaining ones that are coming to pass and brother Branham said tight clothing so women that are dressed immorally or that's the devil's tool and of course that applies to men as well because men can be objects of sexual desire as well so any person would tight clothing showing off their body there are the devil's tool they're dressing in modestly because the Bible said we must dress modestly so we covered that on Wednesday now let me see real quick church if I can pull up those seven major visions I think I preached down at Habakkuk it just kind of came to me I see can I pull it up okay it's not under that one what was the title of that sermon anybody remember that it's been a couple years since I preached that let me look for it real quick is that okay can I look for a real quick I just I know I don't think tiny has ever seen have you ever seen the seven major visions Tonya okay God gave brother Branham seven major visions in 1933 let me see if I can pull it up real quick and if not I'll to do it next week what was the name of that message nobody can remember huh it's worse when I can't remember that's the worst part when I can't remember the name of that I because I appreciate in Iowa as well and I preached it here I feel like I'm getting closer there it is seven major visions that would've been a good term to search under seven major visions it's gonna take a minute to load but in 1933 had seven major visions they were so outrageous and specific that people and his church wanted to kick him out of the church brother Branham said they wanted to call the cops brother Graham said that so let me show those here yeah I appreciate out of habakkuk that's right yeah here they are so brother Branham in 1933 he foresaw Mussolini invading Ethiopia and that came to pass he he foresaw Hitler and the rise and death of Hitler and the building of the Siegfried line he saw fascism Nazism turning into communism he saw advances in science now that's why I said some of these I feel like he said all he said five of them already come to pass but then in 64 he said they don't have the roads yet for the autonomous cars so I believe you were still waiting on part of the fourth and fifth here to happen but he said and science would advance so much until he saw in America he saw driverless cars and he saw a family on beautiful highways playing a game or checkers of some sort on an autonomous car in the United States I believe this last part is still to be fulfilled the fifth vision was the moral problem centering around women where they would almost go to a straight a state of undress so we see that you know women dressing so morally today now brother Rams I thought it was be Hillier Clinton would be president but she wasn't that's why I put her picture there I thought she'd win but she did Oh hit brother madam said there's gonna be a woman that the nation of United States will bow to he said it's either a president vice president or it's the Roman Catholic Church so the the America is going to bow to some woman now I made that last year I thought a couple years ago but it wasn't Hillary Clinton and the seventh and final vision was a bomb exploding in the US and brother RAM saw craters the United States and smoke rising so those were the seven major visions he said they were thus saith the Lord so he knew if all these had come to pass the rest are gonna come to pass and I believe the rest are gonna come to pass as well so that was the the vision from 33 so she hoped I wasn't so bad to wait for that I just want to pull that up so I could show it all right now I want to and then I closed Wednesday by showing that revival only comes through prayer that's thus saith the Lord brother BAM tells us that so I want to read these to you again because Church going forward if we want a revival we've got to get back to more prayer amen I know that's hard to say and it's easy to preach but it's harder to do how many can say amen to that because he said as the devil looked down said I've got a chance now they've gone off without him that's horse marrying Joseph when they left Jerusalem without Jesus he said if he can just get the Pentecostal church to start thinking more of their buildings and their well-dressed congregations then they do an old-fashioned prayer meeting and tarring meeting and the baptism of the holy ghost and a godly life and clean up their women and clean up their men make them live holy and either toe the mark or get out and not put so much on money or more money and raising the first thing you know they're gonna find going off without Christ again brother sister you remember this thus saith the Lord the church better clean up you're drifting too far out come back to the Lord come back to real prayer meetings Church this don't mean we have to pray all night necessarily but it means we got to really pray with real sincerity and we have to have more emphasis on prayer than on buildings on our clothes and on money we gotta have the most emphasis on prayer amen Laura have said see now here's another one when they begin to dig they dug right against things they just throwed it out and they made big ditches this is in the time of Jehoshaphat the next morning the enemy looked out the Sun come up and it looked like blood they said well they fallen on one another they killed each other in a way they went and they were ambushed and they said this is just the light thing before the Lord send forth his water and they went over into the other land they stepped I'm sorry and they stopped up every well they cut down every tree they just had a real old-fashioned revival and when it gets to the place that the people that love God will throw everything they got right into the revival with prayer with everything else and see God's face and pray and seek God and call out in the hours of the night for mercy and get the neighbors saved and so forth I'll tell you will stop the mouth of every critic will knock down every formal thing that's standing up they'll have to know that God's been the camp that's right friends we'll never do it until that thing takes place we can't that's the way of revival for thus saith the Lord said Elijah spoke in the name of the Lord so brother man takes Elijah's physical digging of wells and said we'll never have that until we give we put everything on the way and just give ourselves to prayer and the Word of God amen we'll never do it when ever until we really pray until we want to see the neighbor save until we pray until we see somebody saved on our job will never have the revival until we pray more hallelujah that's why I keep encouraging the church come to church early to pray or stay after and pray prayer is the key and it's not the say Jesse it's thus saith the Lord hallelujah there's got to be a return the people of God have to feel it you have to feel it I have to feel it we have to repeat we have to feel a pull to return to prayer and like Perry Greene said I heard on his testimony listen do it a few months ago he said people brother Perry green said people have said all used to be easy to prey Peregrine said it's never it was never easy to prey it was a sacrifice Amen hallelujah it's never going to be easy it's something we have to build into our lives and that's my prayer for 2019 that God will build prayer into your schedule into my schedule God will build prayer into our lives because it's the only way there's gonna be revival we can't put too much on our building on our clothes or on money we can't those things we have to have them we got to get new clothes every now and then yeah god of a building we got to have money but they we cannot have put more time on that and church only you only you know which one we're putting the most time on in your life right in my life alright so I'm I wanted to start with that one because I think it's so crucial I think that one I think that one drives the whole nature of the church don't you like the whole spirit of the in our church is driven by how much we pray it is because the Bible said you build up your faith by praying in the Holy Ghost let's read it I'm just gonna pull that up there I love that verse it's so I knew it was easy to find - right there I think it's 18 and 19 yeah okay there's mockers how that they told you there should be nut mockers in the last time who should walk out for their own godly lusts these be they separate themselves sensual not having the spirit so let me say like this people that leave our church in order to satisfy their fleshly lusts it's what proof they're not born again because we believe how many believe you're in the true church we baptized the same way Paul did we we pray for the Holy Ghost the same way Paul did we dressed the way Paul said to dress we do everything but Paul said amen so people that separate themselves from our teaching because it's the Bible teaching they're proving they're not mourn'd again but when you say in it it proves you are born again amen hallelujah but he said so see this is the way to combat getting worldly because he says but but II you're not your we're not supposed to be ones that are feeding the lusts of our flesh but you beloved those that God loves how many thankful God loves you hey man I like that song we sang on Wednesday anthem Jesus the anthem own of my heart Jesus the anchor of my soul that song says you call me beloved you call me friend God's the one that called me beloved in other words God the one that loves you praise God hallelujah people can say I love God I love God they can say that all day and maybe God does but the best thing is when God loves you amen when you when he calls you you're my beloved but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost we all want spiritual faith muscles right but the way to pump you hee hee battles Satan battles every true believer with their prayer life because he knows this and he knows that you know this praise God you're only as strong as the time you spend praying to God Almighty glory that's right church amen he knows the scripture you get stronger as you pray more as you say God let your will be done not mine I'm praying for your will to be done I'm not asking selfish things I'm not even asking anything I'm just asking for your will to be done use me Lord God now you're starting to get strong there you go and he says when you do this you're keeping yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and I love this you can't have compassion on everybody but you can have compassion on a son some people others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating this one thing you can hate hating a life that's spotted by sin that's one thing you're allowed to hate you're supposed to love your enemies you're supposed to love everybody in the church so you gotta love everybody which you can hate the sin that's in your life praise God alright so it's by prayer now when you and I are can eyes thus saith the Lord from the message of the hour God starts dealing with us but God will not deal with anyone until they do that as far as the bride now because that's what that's what that's what we're told now let's look at this that's the same thing what's happened to church we've all went to be Methodists or Baptists or Presbyterian or we've got a degree out of Harford I think you meant Harvard but Hartford might be a school as well we got a degree out of wheat and although it's at Christian College I think we got a degree out of somewhere else or Bob Jones we got a Bachelor of Art we got a DDL D D or L LD or something other what is it amounted to a bunch of nonsense it's the way it was in Egypt and God never did deal with Israel till she come to her homeland hear me thus saith the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the homeland the message of the hour come back to the original Bible on an area I'm so glad God dealeth with me amen God's not ignored it means not leaving me he's not rejecting me you know he's not grieved by my attitude God's dealing with me because I've come back to the state the Lord the message of the hour and the message is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen the message is not just william branham is a prophet that's part of the truth but brother man said my message is Hebrews 13:8 it's about Jesus Christ being the same today amen Jesus Christ is the same today and we're supposed to be Jesus Christ was skin-on praise God people are supposed we're supposed to be so much like Christ till people look at you and say mine I see Jesus Christ in you you're really led to the Holy Spirit I've ever met a sweet Christian it was you oh don't you want them to say that about to you church oh I do you said get away from your Methodist Baptist Presbyterian your Pentecostal that was me how spent assemblies I was raised with assemblies oneness 3 news 5's whatever it is Church of God Nazarene pilgrim holiness Church of Christ all Anti Christ movement see once they denominator it becomes an antichrist movement they were there all nice when they start with the movement but once they denominator with that denomination then say then God leaves them because they de nominate a denomination is like a wall they build a wall around themselves and say we've got it and there's nothing else right that's a denomination but God once they do that God moves on and God has moved into our movement and we've got to make sure we don't grieve his Holy Spirit he's dealing with us but we got to let him deal with us amen and how does he deal best with us when we're in prayer when we're in prayer more prayer that's how he deals with us I realized this strikes the world all wrong all the devil all those denominations are of the devil there's godly men I love this he said there's godly men and every one of them godly people and every one of them movements but the organization in itself is not of God and God will never bless it he has never done it see God doesn't bless those organizations they all die right they all just die out but we want to be blessed with the Holy Spirit with God's love in our hearts right we want to be blessed with the presence of God in our lives that's right now I want to see a show of some thus at the Lord's on doctrine and of course these are all in the Bible brother Graham said his teaching on the church ages with us say the Lord the seven seals was thus say at the Lord revelation 10 that's critical was thus saith the Lord marriage and divorce was thus saith the Lord modest clothing is thus saith the Lord hair length short for men long for women is the say at the Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost is thus saith the Lord and he said classical preaching is evil he said that's thus saith the Lord that's why I try to get excited I try to be led of the Holy Spirit because if I stand here just trying to be classical and speak everything eloquent that's of the devil are you with me church that's the devil trying to impress you with words or trying to be scholarly or trying to just be fancy or trying to be educated that's of the devil it's not about education we know it's about Revelation amen in other words God making known his will to you so let's read the quotes now the vision plus the word plus history plus the church ages all been together so I could truly say the best of my understanding in the Courteney of the Word of God and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord so the seals and the church ages were thus saith the Lord that he taught now here's the one I like I had it read this one for a while till this morning notice what is it that what can be done what has to be done let's consult the prophet in the Bible where we cannot add or take away from and if we do God takes us from the book of life the Bible said in Malachi 4 what would happen today revelations 10 how the seven seals would be open and reveal all these mysteries that's been hid down through these reformers he said how it would be done it's in the Bible thus saith the Lord God has completely perfectly identified that to vindicate to be the truth by signs wonders in the heavens in the skies in the signs everything else for 33 years you think they'll listen to it no they're dead they put their hand into something that's killed the whole thing no it won't it won't never no more but see it's thus saith the Lord God is vindicated Malachi 4 and in Revelation 10 it's thus saith the Lord here's where he says now I'm gonna skip down here because he talks about how he foretold the events in Arizona with the sword and everything the sword of the king he saw seven angels coming I'm skipping down because I preached on that he said there stood seven angels and throw to the sword your hand said go home and open the seven seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent seed and all these other things that's been fussed about it's thus saith the Lord Amen cook I know yeah Amen in church that's why I love this message because I know it didn't come from a man it come from the Bible I get emails every week I get texts every week telling me people are amazed at the videos I make on YouTube because they've never heard it and I try not to mention brother Rams name not not because I'm ashamed of it but because I'm not trying to point everybody to him I'm trying to point them to Christ and then if they hang on to the end of the video yeah then I'll mention where I get this I got it from other Branham but that's the way I was taught I was taught point to the word point to the word point to the word and if they point to the word they're gonna love the man that preached the word and that was William Aaron random I don't know yeah I just got an email this morning saying what a I've never heard anything so beautiful about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden I said well thank you it wasn't me it's the Word of God but what is it Church its sayeth the Lord amen it's the word and that's why I love because you can prove all these things by the word of god this is continuing the quote go home yeah he said what is it now so this is what we read earlier seven seals serpentine marriage divorce what is it it's the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power Amen hallelujah Church I hope that's what the message has been to you when you receive the revelation of the marriage and divorce that should give you quickening power power to obey marriage and divorce Amen hallelujah that's power power to live your marriage is the right way and those that don't have the right marriages shows they don't have the right quickening power but God gives us the quickening power to obey all the commands on marriage and divorce Amen idea and then the seven seals with the quickening power in the seven seals is the eagle anointing praise God that's the quickening power for us this is a reality we're flying above all organizations and man-made religions it's not just well this is what the seals mean that's true that's what the symbols mean but we got to get anointed with the revelation of those symbols the holy spirit to fly like a real Christian should flying and and here's what here's how you know church help us to receive to help us see it just depends on what attitude if you just take the attitude well yeah the white horse is just Satan's Antichrist spirit that was good to know what's next if you take that attitude you're failing to see that you you're supposed to take that revelation and now recognize Satan will try to sneak into your life as a white horse writer and you've got to be ready to fight off that white horse rider in the name of Jesus Christ that's quickening power amen so you'll see that so when you leave Church the next temptation that comes you'll be ready to cast down and kill that white horse rider are you with me it's quickening power it's not just sermons and tapes and and different teachings it is teaching but the reality behind that teaching is quickening life amen hallelujah I've always stood for that I've always believed that it just depends the attitude you take to the preaching right that's why tell on their attitude to the preaching I know it's hard but the church says still says Amen your attitude see it depends what attitude is this just education to you or is this quickening power to you coming to church needs to be power amen because it's worth the spirit behind the word is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you you're a power to be a witness amen Oh Mary hallelujah see that's the reality that's why so many people fall away for the message it's their attitude they just oh yeah oh it's just it's just education it's just different teaching it's all it's just it's just different symbols I didn't know that before and it's just attitude it's not power it's gotta be power if you're gonna overcome Satan you can't overcome him it's got to be the power of God to overcome Satan that's right Church and then you'll see if you have the power when it comes to marriage in divorce you're gonna marry the right person or gonna mess up mess up your life or make a mistake it's the power that keeps you in the right situation it's the power that holds you amen that's right all these things now here program gives us a vill thus saith the lord about modest clothing now watch this looky here here's a little lady twisted herself down the street you probably saw some more women sometime this week probably family events here's a young fella saw a man's looking at a sexy dress women his eyes catches it he's a member of the church he's a Pentecostal he's whatever let's just say he's the message believer but the first thing you know there's no hold post in there see there's no born-again experience she'll say hello he's got curly hair and kind of nice looking straight shoulder young man maybe tried to live right she start walking up to him even a preacher the first thing you know what is it this out here the flesh desire and the spirit down there yet anointed saying don't do it don't do it but what will it do it'll move right around there hold there it goes first thing you know he's trying to make a date with her he's guilty of committing adultery whether he touches her or not so today especially with dating a young man he could be in the church he sees a sexy dress women oh can I get your phone number he's already going about it the wrong way he's only once her number because of her outward appearance but if he followed the laws of God he would contact her father first right and he would pray about it first and it wouldn't be just based upon outward and be based upon her inward character amen he would love her not just because she's beautiful on the out but because she loves Jesus Christ which is the only true beauty there is because beauty is vain a woman that feared the Lord that's real beauty she shall be praised amen so see this is them this is how most church people date today and of course the world they don't care they've got apps where people can just meet up now just for casual interactions it's so filthy and awful just so wicked but we're talking about church people here Pentecostals right message message people let's bring it to our day amen but see a genuine born-again son of God amen you can't do it yourself it's totally impossible for a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place but when there's something on the inside that little born-again something here though that man might have shouted spoke in tongues jump dance everything else anointed with the spirit done all the signs wonders that God said in there by his Spirit jesus said many will come to me in that day say lord have we not prophesied in your name haven't I cast out Devils in your name have not he said depart from me ye that work iniquity was iniquity something that you know to do but don't do it depart for me hear that work iniquity I didn't even know you so see this young man knew better he must have known you don't go you don't try to get a woman's phone number just based upon her sexual clothing and how sexy she is that's not the right way to go and so no matter how anointed the young man could have been he already had committed lust in his heart and because of that he's guilty but down on the inside of that man if that little tie post is in there the seed of God that was predestined before the foundation of the world I don't care what takes place it holds him it's there to stay so you brothers you know and when you get temptations and you cast it down what does it show it shows you've got to anchor amen the anchor holds amen hallelujah in the midst of the storm amen and you sisters the same thing when you had a temptation for a man that shouldn't be the right man or shouldn't talk to him what is it it's the anchor of God it's the character of Jesus Christ formed in you what is it it's the Holy Ghost self-control amen that's right male or female let's give them both let's give them both a good pat on the back that's right why that's why the woman will wear them shorts now look a woman that wears these short shorts she's counted a prostitute the same as the woman in the act now if this woman doesn't know better she that's different right because the Bible says if they don't know there's no transgression if they don't know in other words they don't understand what they're doing but a woman that will wear those short shorts or short skirts on purpose and no she's trying to get attention she's got a prostitute spirit on her because she's trying to attach a track tension she's trying to do it sexually so she's got an evil spirit trying to attract the attention of men that's right in fact I just saw I was I didn't read the whole article I was just flipping through the news this morning just maybe five minutes on my phone and a pole I just pulled up what's this this girl this actress now she's an older actress now like in her 30s or 40s but she in this article I'm off to find it afterwards she said Hollywood started having her do evil sexual things at 13 years old she was in movies at 13 and Hollywood had her take her clothes off at even 13 and she said I knew it was wrong and here's someone who does not even a Christian and they put makeup on her face and and made her do sexual things even at 13 years old and there's a woman who's not even a Christian admitting I knew it was wrong see God puts a conscience in every man and woman they know it's wrong they know what's wrong and so God puts it in there now I said earlier that some people might not know what's wrong I don't know now forgive me but that even proves a 13 year old girl knows it's wrong to act sexual like that they put makeup on her face and they give her they put her in sexual scenes with grown men at 13 years old Hollywood did that so people are gonna go spend $50 it goes to movie in Hollywood you're just flushing your money down the toilet you're just getting you're just paving the road to hell is that right you're just paving driving on the road to hell that's right see she doesn't know that spirit how does she know or what does she know her ultimate what is an ultimate is the last word the ultimate is the Amen it's the end of all strife your ultimate and if you're Church a Pentecostal church or message church well in this case probably Pentecostal Pentecostal church that tells you long hair and stuff is just fanaticism you got a spare tire in the back of your head and so forth and then kind of things that man is possessed of the devil amen any man that will make fun of women with long hair is possessed of the devil and church he's going to say thus saith the Lord right after this because the Bible never shows a godly woman ever cutting her hair never shows the godly woman ever taking her clothes off like a strip tease it never shows that so these are witnesses so a man that says Oh sisters you can cut your hair that man's got demons on him for God's Word said it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair should this honor her head if she dishonored her husband and her husband is Christ in the churches Christ she is a dishonorable religious prostitute and look at that you start building it up now that's true think about this think about a person that will break some of the Ten Commandments they blaspheme they murder they lust and they covet if they just do those right there they're a murdering blasphemous covetous I doubt her fornicator are you with me church are you with me they it just compounds from one sin to the next the more demons people get on the more evils they do and it just compounds so now they're a dishonouring this audible religious prostitutes false church member it just builds and builds and builds and if evil builds don't you know righteousness built as well amen you go from faith to virtue to knowledge glory to temperance the patience the godless to brotherly kindness to charity amen then you start bringing forth the fruits of the spirit how did it get pretty soon you coming to your adoption amen just like they build up their filthiness we build up our righteousness a man naked don't do Bible say the woman's covering is her hair isn't the hair to give her for a covering yeah let's go read em real quick giving her for a covering and I've had this year I've had so many I don't know why I met so many people contact me about the cap set you know Amish and Mennonite women wear and I just always take him back to the scripture I take him back to here if a woman have long hair it's a glory to her for her hair is given for her covering I mean if I tell them if it makes you feel good to wear a cap that's fine or a veil that's fine but the Bible never says the cap is your covering or avails your covering the Bible says you're uncut hair is a covering and so Paul says if anybody wants to argue about this we have no such or no other custom we don't do any other practice neither do the Churches of God we have no other way this is the way the Churches of God do it praise God now look what he says some day live this yonder at the judgment bar tried to pour the medicine in and hold it with my hands and you spit it right straight back out between your fingers and that's something God will judge them some day that's thus saith the Lord the Browns preaching hard women you gotta let your hair grow women you got to cover up your bodies men stop lusting after women and he's on the day of judgment God will judge them for those things it hasn't been a bunch of foolishness or some crazy old man all worked up it is it because it's the word of the Lord oh we just love this Bible don't we Church everything we believe is in this word but see I like this a real genuine Christian will cope with that inside man that spirit that was backyard at the beginning which is the word in others you can cope you can agree with it you can obey it because you believe it amen now here's an here's where bonuses we have the stator on the on the baptism the Holy Ghost the evidence is not speaking in tongues and you don't get the Holy Ghost when you get baptized you might get it right after but you'd you're not guaranteed to get it if you get baptized you've got to be justified sanctified and then fill with the Holy Spirit program says I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism Holy Ghost is according to the word it's not according to me it's not according to you it has to be according to the say it the Lord over falsely led and the Word says you're baptized when the Holy Ghost when you obey God let me pull that up acts 5:32 we'll just do little a little maybe the Obama study here today here all right now they're preaching in acts 5 and he said him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour speaking of Christ for to give repentance to Israel forgiveness of sins and we are witnesses of these things I'm sorry we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey Him amen my it's so simple if you weren't the Holy Ghost just obeying the word Amen that's all you got to do if you want to be born-again obey it don't set it aside don't compromise but don't make any any reason to not obey it just do what the word says and then the word will come living you praise God hey you don't give the Holy Ghost to those that disobey Him he gives the Holy Ghost to those that obey Him hallelujah it's very very plain when they heard that they're cut to their hearts that's what it always does right if you got the religious spirit on you that will make you want to just beat me up or something if you got the wrong spirit if I said that and you'd want to beat me up but if you got the right spirit you'd say hallelujah amen God only gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him that's the saith the Lord program told us according to the Bible not me not him thus according to the Bible oh brother what we need today is an old stirring of the Holy Ghost again brother it had to come to me before God ever manifested himself we need rushing mighty wind sense that's right as it did on the day of Pentecost they were all religious and followers of Jesus but they had to go and receive the baptism Holy Ghost is that true and listen here women you got to be salty and listen to this do you realize that up in there when they all went up at 120 to pray they never done like we Baptist do shake hands up with their name on the book and say yes I'm born again they didn't have it like that no scripture is that in the Bible and we Catholic people who come lick out our tongue and take the Holy Eucharist and say we got the Holy Ghost no Scripture in the Bible for that so see either way you can't come to church and shake my hand say well I've got the Holy Ghost now I've been baptized in or Jesus Christ and you can't go to the Catholic Church and get the wafer and say well I got the Holy Ghost now he says we Methodists go on prohibition for six months and no such Scripture in the Bible but the Bible said when the day of Pentecost was fully come there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were setting and the power of God stood and closed those people and anointed them till they run into the street screaming and dancing and hollering and acting like a bunch of drunk people that's the scripture thus saith the Lord hallelujah amen I've never danced in those streets are shot but I have shouted and cried and prayed really loud out in our parking lot I have done that I've never danced in the street I have danced around numerous churches including this one so I know what that's like I have hollered I'm hollering now I've act like a drug person might have seen me act like a drug person praying and sniffing and shouting and crying and and snotting all over the place where I look like I'm drunk so we know what that's like but listen there's no other way the Holy Ghost comes until you open yourself so much that you really worship God and you don't care who's around that's when God you obey God and that's when God will fill you with the Holy Ghost and you'll not be ashamed to worship Jesus Christ if you get the Holy Ghost amen you don't care if it's out in the parking lot you don't care if it's in here just wanna worship him because your fail with eternal life ahead oh yeah yeah it's exactly right here's that quote I was telling you that's why I don't try to impress you with class let me speak this just a minute did you know where class come from classes of the devil now that's thus saith the lord of the bible class and pomp came from the devil in the very beginning when Cain and Abel come up to worship Cain come before the Lord in class Abel came by righteousness by revelation so see there's a difference a pain worship a bloodless lifeless worship is of the devil but a real worship of Revelation will include the blood it'll have life in it amen if you're bringing the right sacrifice it'll have life in it praise God in other words it won't be a burden to go to church it won't be a burden to read your Bible it won't be a burden to pray it'll be life to do those things because that's your sacrifice it was blood life it wasn't class and routine in high society and memorization and pronunciation God don't care about that what he cares about his life that's thus saith the Lord he says now he elaborates a little bit on that now look when Cain come he brought the fruits of the field everything that grows flowers and everything in decorating his altar and he works got a true picture of the carnal church member today and the carnal minded pastor who wants a church that sits higher than the rest of them in the city and their seats are plush and $1,000,000 pipe organ well you can ask bang I never asked for a million dollar pipe or yet have I been no I never asked bang bang can you try to find us the the church that's the highest up in Green Ohio everybody can look at our church and say oh what a great marvelous Church they are nonsense what we want is we want to be a spiritual city on a hill that cannot be hidden and when we got that we'll have the love of Christ the life of Christ we have testimonies of Jesus Christ one of the power and love genes we'll want to share with everybody that's the real church that's the kind of that's the kind of city on a hill we want to be that's right he said God don't care for that just say that you that's a lot of those great big places like that and done your people until they're just about poor paupers and everything else with all your stuff to put in the church and thousands of heathens died on the mission field without knowing Christ one time right it's a disgrace to Christianity oh if you could only see one time you know what I was speaking of build that million-dollar Church in two-thirds of the world never heard of Jesus Christ what a pity I forgot I got a testimony for your church I gave Simon over a thousand dollars to take his missionary trip to Thailand that was your tithing I remember when we remember before he went we prayed and said God may you please find the soul that really loves the message someone that can be a pastor well guess what a pastor received the message and now he's spreading it the brother said he's Simon sitting there spreading like wildfire over there now the only the only thing you got to pray for now is that his wife is against it because you know it's holiness so we got to pray for his wife at the end of the service there but I was so happy I said hallelujah I told the bear said that's exactly what we prayed for is that a pastor would receive the message and look for church God answered our prayer now they in Thailand they have just as much right to hear the gospel hallelujah amen and so that should be our main desire now I know bang and I talked about we'd like to build a church at some point but that if God's in it Church God will help us to do both at the same time if God's in it that's that's how it'll be right now it looks like we go into one right now we'll do the missionary work for now but you never know God's it you know God's a mysterious God he's a great God we don't want to put it past him now we can do our part and save a little bit we can I want to do that more in 2019 as well I'm gonna probably less less preachers but that means you got to put up with me more so hopefully you like that or you say no get more preachers brother Jesse I know you don't say that but you know see Bertram is always bringing this up because he's he's always battling that that Antichrist spirit that cane spear they want a fancy look in church instead of seeing people receive the message that's what they want they want a million dollar pipe organ rather than sending somebody go to preach to a place that's never heard the message before I don't care about him in our pipe organ what I cares about is this message going to somebody that loves Christ and that really wants to know Christ amen I've always cared about that that's all I care about here's some more now this is this is uh thus saith the Lord Miriam brother BAM says was an informal Holy Roller and he says we got to be like Miriam once there's a testimony somebody's got jump up and say where's the tambourine here let me do this let me give an example somebody gets saved and somebody comes to the blood somebody gets saved here somebody needs to break out tambourines this holiday yeah thank you Jesus praise the Lord hallelujah amen there's a woman that did that not a man a woman but it can be woman or man next time we get somebody saved brother bang I do we got a four guys a tambourine thank you I can't play the tambourine but yeah you know we got to have some real excitement praise God there's got to be a real victory because God brought them through the blower they men and all their taskmasters died in the Dead Sea or the red sea rather robe and said there's only one prophet messenger with us saith the Lord the RAM said a woman that cuts her hair is spiritually dead she's not born again thus saith the Lord there's one about divorce and remarriage brother Ham gives the state the law look at that one denominational fruit is is no good fruit that's thus saith the Lord and every nation is dominated by Satan that's the state the Lord notice he said Balak they're sent to bail them and say come over here and curse this people I don't want them in my country and said that's a bunch of holy rollers I don't want them here you say holy rollers brother band yes they were holy rollers can you prove it yes sir when they call us to the red blood of the Red Sea they saw the taskmasters dead behind them poor brother dr. Moses Moses got informal he thrown his hands up in the air and began screaming and singing in the spirit nobody expected Moses to do it but he just did it informally it wasn't scheduled and the church said this is informal Holy Ghost worship is something that's not scheduled it's not the regular routine but God wants to get praise anyway amen so God kind of breaks up the schedule and lets somebody get a little sighted and prays to the lower that's some informal Holy Ghost worship thank you Lord amen hallelujah like when sister Naomi will speak in tongues or something like you know like we've had two or three times over the years that's informal like right we don't expect that right when somebody will scream I think couple years we had somebody scream back there in the back and it was sister Chris and Walker when she first started coming here all of a sudden just let out a scream see God likes that God likes to move upon people and God likes to be worship praise God now it's not always going to be informal every service but there are many times when somebody informally just praises God or worships God that's what he said in informal he got informal he got a little excited about Jesus we should get a little excited about Jesus amen and Miriam the prophetess she got informal grabbed a tambourine and run down the bank beating and dancing and the dollars of Israel found her dancing beating on a tambourine if an old fashioned Holy Roller meaning I never seen one in my life amen they were informal holy rollers you don't want to believe that but that's the truth that's not saith the Lord the scripture I like that praise God that's what happened much in in in message churches because Satan how's it so hard I think but every now and then if we can just break that and we'll see God move we can experience this where God gives us an informal worship nobody was planning on it except God was planning it you and I were planning it but God was planning some informal worship hallelujah sure they were holy rollers interdenominational holy rollers that's that vine over there though oh I'm so glad to be part of that bye hey men glory now here's the court about there's only one one prophet messenger and I know for example I know I don't know anybody who believes their a the eighth messenger but there are some churches that believe that but just so you know I'm gonna go through I'm gonna go this quickly I'm just gonna skip right ahead buh-bam said I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who reveal the mysteries as contained the word and who has the mystery to turn the hearts of the children of the fathers thus saith the LORD bhai's unfailing word stands and shall stand and be vindicated there's one prophet messenger to this age we're not looking for me you're not looking for me to reveal more mysteries you're not looking for any other person no matter the last name brand amour Regan or Pruitt or any any name you're not looking for anyone else to raise up and reveal what God has already done through a seventh church age messenger I didn't think we need to spend too much time on that because I've never heard of anything around this area try to tempt anybody with that an eighth messenger or something but they're there they are there I know there's some in New York another some in Trinidad and different things like that now here's this here's a scripture about a woman that she'd not cut her hair but let's stop here I feel somebody resenting that might have been out on the wire somewhere listen a hair to a woman isn't as right bow hair to Samson was a Nazarite vow and when a woman cuts off her hair she absolutely denies her Nazarite vow that she is the Bride of Christ because they're that one thing she spoils the whole pictures correctly an asura is one that's consecrated for a purpose is that right Samson was consecrated to an age and a purpose before he had long hair I'm sure therefore he had long hair the woman that's a child of God lets her hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of God right if she cuts it off I don't care how much she dances sings in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down or has all kinds of hated societies she's dead that's thus saith the Lord the Word of God yeah she's denied her Nazarite vow and sold out to the god of this modern age she does it now shame on you lady or woman and that true that's true now a man that'll grow his hair long he's just as wrong he's ashamed to Jesus right he dishonored Jesus Christ a man that lettered hair grow uncut now uncut he's a shame there's no way he's born again either right so this woman is not born again she's dead she's not alive by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right now here's one I got to put a disclaimer because I met a pastor in Maine who the previous pastor took this quote he divorced his wife and married another all because his wife cut her hair and that's wrong that's not what brother Branham said here so you have to you have to read this one carefully and it can't go against anything in here the only way a person can marry someone else after divorce is if and ethically be a man because that's what Jesus said Jesus said the only cause for remarriage after divorce is a man whose first wife committed fornication but never told him got married and so when he finds out later he can put her away and he can marry another that's the only way in the Bible writes the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life that's the only way now here brother Branham says this he says the Bible says the hair is given to a woman for glory and the Bible right gives any man a right to leave and divorce and leave his wife that will cut her hair that's the Bible that's the saith the Lord now let me help you to understand this in the Bible days a woman had no right to leave a man she was under his she's like property right because they were they were so mistreated that they were like property now today if a woman's being mistreated she should leave if she's getting beat or something she should leave and run for her life God is not asking a woman to get abused God doesn't want anybody abused now he allows it sometimes for testimonies and for witnesses on the day of judgment right because nobody as awful as abuse is nobody was more abused than Jesus Christ the Bible said he was beaten and bruised and mistreated like he didn't even look like a man anymore nobody could experience any worse abuse than Christ so sometimes God does let people go through abuse but don't misunderstand this brother branham never said this person can remarry so if a man if his wife cut her hair he could divorce her but he cannot marry another woman now if a man really loved his wife I don't think he'd divorce her if she cut her hair but the bible does give them that right because the bible said it's a dishonor she dissed honors her head when she cuts her hair she dishonours her husband right that's true something well there's something someone to say oh no I hope you understand that nobody nobody out here ever ever better getting divorces don't get a divorce don't misunderstand this you stay married you stay in the situation you're in don't misunderstand this stay married here's the next one okay here yeah this is denominations after all the denominations is played out they don't have any light to begin with there'll be a day they can't that can't be called day or night what are they doing what are they doing what does a lemon do on an orange tree it takes the original life of a orange that's coming up and perverts it through a lemon that's where the nominations are done to the Word of God made the Word of God of no effect by their traditions that's thus saith the Spirit of the Lord they have brought forth lemons grape fruits but not oranges so everybody I hope we all can look at denominations not to be critical but just to be honest what have they produced they produced sin loving church members right like many my friends this morning they're posting on Facebook all about the Browns are all about last night's football games they should be posted about Jesus Christ amen but they're just so consumed or the women are boasting about you know getting drunk or the new year you know and going to vacation bill they'll get excited on anything else but Jesus Christ that's what a church member sin loving Church produces it produces death but we should produce life amen hallelujah I'd say that's what it has in me I don't know about you but each day I fall more in love with Jesus I just want to do more for Jesus I was wanting to make sure that I'm doing everything I can do I'm making my calling election sure that I'm a real elected child of God okay that's the reason we Wars and troubles the world every nation is dominated by Satan who never heard many amens on that but that's the truth that's that the Lord now you we hear amens here right because we know every nation on earth is dominated by Satan Satan took up all the other nations I'm sorry Satan took Jesus up on the mountain and showing the United States and all the other kingdoms that said I will give them all to you if you'll bow down and worship me that's why I appreciated you know Tanya's prayer requests we want to pray for people in the government but we know overall the government's gonna go like this they're gonna keep going like this but there can be some few believers in there how many believe that we should pray God save them help them to take away abortion help them take away any evil law that's been made legal if they've made sin legal take it away God take it off the books do something say whatever you can amen all right here's a few more we're almost done almost done a few more brother madam said trinitarian is wrong thus saith the Lord father son Holy Ghost baptism is wrong thus saith the Lord Peter it was never Rome thus saith the Lord and we're at the end of the Gentile dispensation thus saith the Lord now this is one church I encourage you to go back and listen this one brother Branham says it's so nicely I was actually shocked when I listened to I was like whoa he was actually being real sweet he wasn't all like you know fiery you know like like we sometimes yeah let me say this with godly love the hour has approached where I can't hold still on these things no more it's too close to the coming see Trinitarian him is of the devil I say that thus saith the Lord look where it come from you come from the Nicaea Council and when the Catholic Church become in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned the entire book of the Bible and as far as three God's that's from Hell there's one God that's right now do you say then do you believe that all these people are Trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they're Christians but the hours approaching brother when they're sincerely wrong you know I was I've been writing another book and I'm writing in the the Godhead chapter right now so this one means a lot to me right now but you know the Trinity says that the fathers fully God eternal God the sons eternal God the Holy Ghost is eternal God and there proof is on the baptism of Jesus now have you ever thought about this I just thought about this for the first time ever today they said Jesus baptism there was three people right there's the Sun the water the spirits like a dove and the father's the voice now let me try to catch what they believe they believe one person is fully got in the water the third the second person the first person says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and the third person who is fully God comes down like a dove and lives on him so you have fully God getting anointed with fully God are you kidding me why does if Jesus is already eternal full eternal why does he need the third person to anoint him if that isn't try theism to believe in three gods I don't know what is these people Church are completely blind I don't care how new their glasses are they're completely blind they think a third God has to come and enjoy a second God but the reality of it is this is what I say in the book here of them writing if you can just look at it the Father Son Holy Ghost the father the Holy Ghost are the same self spirit well that takes you down to two people right oh he knows although we know it's not two people the father whole ego goes to the self same spirit right it's one spirit it's not two spirits well I think it's done in two but then you know God the invisible father is the really the only one person that invisible spirit made a body and that one invisible spirit made a body and come to dwell in that body it's one person manifesting himself in three ways it's one person making himself known in three different ways okay just like at the burning bush there was a voice of the burning wish and there was a fire at the burning bush but that wasn't to people it was one person that one person made like a he put on his coat this coat God God is invisible spirit this coat was like the fire he came and hid in the fire and then he started talking out the fire and there the fire was burdened like that right there this is the fire all the children is that help the children in the burning bush this was the fire but God was hiding behind there said tell him I am tell him that I am sent you it wasn't two people right because the Holy Ghost and fire remember the ghost came is fire on the day of Pentecost that whole that's that is God that's that's God coming down and putting on a mask putting on a fire see just because there's three manifestations doesn't mean there's three gods it just means God is so powerful he can hide himself in as many ways as he wants and if that's not true then on the day of Pentecost how many licks of fire weathers anybody know how many licks of fire were there a hundred and twenty what does that mean the Holy Ghost is 120 different persons or what how many persons are in the Godhead what's 120 plus two 122 so the Holy Ghost is or God is now under 22 persons see how foolish that is see how ridiculous that is and people swallow that just because they know they're scared to say the Trinity is wrong when it's not even in the Bible if you add to the Bible God as plagues right if you take from the Bible God takes away book of life your name on the book of life we just say what the Bible says amen the times coming where we just got to be honest there sincerely wrong and say in love speak the truth in love how long have I been preaching alright I'm almost done thus saith the Lord the baptism using the title father son Holy Ghost is false thus saith the Lord I command every one of you on here and on tape that has been baptized the name of Jesus Christ be rebaptised again in the name of Jesus Christ I think everybody here has been baptized the name of Jesus Christ is that right okay I think so everybody that saved me give their heart to Lord yeah I think Tonya I we talked about that right time you're right you were baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ okay and it was it was Jesus Christ was that the name okay the same day okay well let's talk about that after church yeah yeah I like to talk to you about that I didn't I thought I maybe I misunderstood you that that's a that's a born that's really important okay all right well let's yeah let's talk about dad I appreciate that I know this is really helpful for you because you've not really heard about brother Branham as much but I want everybody to see that everything he said is right in the Word of God it's right here in the Word of God and now I don't know maybe I could yeah let me see if I can pull this up real quick there was five baptisms in the book of Acts yeah here it is oh yeah I just you're here to skew number Tanya can you see this um it's not really it's not dark but Jesus said Matthew jesus said fives and all he goes ten days later Peter said Jesus Christ a few weeks later Philip said Lord Jesus then Peter said baptize them a name of Lord a few months later a few years later Paul said baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then Paul later said his testing when I was baptized the name of Lord so if you put all three of those together you have Lord Father Son Jesus Holy Ghost Christ Lord Jesus Christ no one was ever baptized with people saying titles father son Holy Ghost it was always in the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ does that make sense so that's why brother Branham as a prophet that's why he could say that church and he could be right how many believe this is right any man it's not saith the Lord I mean this is the scripture now I'm gonna skip bad this is one about yeah let me skip down to Peter and I can prove to you by the written word out of the Bible exactly the days and years of Peter never did leave Palestine but one time and went to Babylon down by the Euphrates never was in Rome by the Scriptures thus saith the Lord it's all pagan idea they try to make Peter the first pope of rome that's thus saith the Lord it's wrong he was not that probe of Rome that's thus saith the Lord that's a lie cuz it's not in the Bible nothing about that in the Bible now here's one that we're getting to where we are remember this is the ending of the Gentile dispensation remember it's thus saith the Lord it's time for the Gentile age to cease we're at the end time that doesn't mean we pack it in and try to just quit and give up and feel sorry for ourselves we keep working till Jesus comes you and I are the 11th hour workers ain't man somebody's gotta work amen it's gotta be you and I and when you give your tithes and offerings that's helping with Simon work it's helping who did we send it to Oh Jason and Mars I gave him a thousand dollars for his next trip and he's going next month we got to work till Jesus comes remember there's a church now in Turkey because Jason DeMars work which we've supported because of that there's now a church in Turkey that hasn't had a Christian Church for five hundred years and you and I had a little part in that amen that's all we're a little Church then we take a little part we just got a new heart to God God will Express us a new a little part cuz we're a little Church so let's just do it by God's grace but don't quit don't give up we can't get discouraged we can't feel sorry for ourselves we got to just find our place do our position and be happy with it and just do all we can for Jesus Christ I'm almost done here bear with me now this gets down to this gets down to us now this may not apply to us but I want to read it anyway because this is this is true this is what's happening today the Bible said because of iniquity abounds the love of many shall wax cold so the real love for God is getting less and less and less and less and less than this unless colder and colder and colder the real love of God is going to get so so so cold now this isn't Chicago now while the people are moving down this is an altar call still coming as long as people are coming in and we're going to hold it I don't think we have too much more time in this in the world to make these kind of calls this is in 1961 now just remember I speak in the name of the Lord the hour is coming when you know I don't know if this is you in Chicago or you like the bride of the church you will scream for a meeting like this you won't be so anxious to get up and go out but be too late then so brother Hannah says when you get to the spot where you're screaming oh I wish we could have a altar call it's too late then so we got to say God give us altar calls now let's see I think this person is probably was to Chicago personally because you know we serve services where people come to the altar but there's not really like sinners here you know it's mostly Saints so but just so you know brother Branham says it was in the name of the Lord the people there would get to the spot where they would scream God give us a revival like that again but it's too late then that might have meant you know brother Branham would have died and could never come back and do one I don't know I'm not sure how to interpret that I'm just letting you know there's gonna come a time when people are crying out for God and he's not going to be there so we've got a crowd to God while we can access him right now I'm almost done bear with me now a lot of people have put a lot of different ideas on the movies on the bride but let's read what brother Graham said now real quietly I'm asking you consecrated men and women who really know God how many really know God most of them it's very strange it seems like it's that way altar calls that I make is mostly all men you know in a regular run it's women but it's all men here I think there's one woman out at the altar tonight maybe two it's usually the women but somehow or another I guess it seemed like that women think I talk against them I don't sister 3 I believe someone said they see can't see over the top of the altar all right some of you consecrated Christians come up here and stand with me in prayer just a minute on the altar wherever you are on the platform somebody that really knows God just knows how to stand here just a few minutes for prayer with them then we'll dismiss the audience everybody be real reverent now don't leave just come here and stand around so brother man was asking for people to come up and pray with those who are coming up for prayer he's asking mature Christians now real Christians who really know how to pray come on up here move up here he says to pray for them and then he says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering another age we're entering the rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that say Amen it's got to get worse and it can't go like this it's got to be something and it's moving right now he says this isn't 65 I believe the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the Lord so he's saying the people that are coming forth that's the move of God the move is on the bride the people who are drawing near to God right now amen oh thank God the moves on me Church the move should be on you we're the ones that are drawing to God and we're the ones that want to pray with people amen the thing is just getting them here to pray with them these people are so in love with the world they don't want to come to church they don't want to do nothing but God help us to be ready when they come now now look we said he says the moves on the bride they'll say the Lord now I'm moving up consecrated Christians that once your record to find out that those who come sincerely that you want to come and offer prayer with them as your brothers and sisters come up around the altar he's saying the move is on the bride right now God isn't drawing his bride to him and then he says move up and pray for these people look at the power of prayer standing around her just a moment for prayer someone else want to come stand around here just kneel down by them just walk where you met around these menu women sweet humbly ask prayer for them to see some people make this some different thing but program saying the move is on the bride it's God drawing the bride to him getting ready for the rapture and he said it's going on right now the move is on the bride whoever God is calling that's the bride whoever responds to the call of God the moves on them thank you lord moving me praise God that's my prayer you've heard this one many times let's read again thus say the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter how many how much religious demonstrations how many good deeds you've done whatever you've done that won't count on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else in here just so fill with the love of God so you can love those who hate you take a moment take a moment who who do you know that hates you that's the person you gotta love who hates you who if they could do it would just speak evil would spit in your face or who would just the Bible bro Graham says perfect love is loving them that's that's perfect love thus saith the Lord that's the love that's gonna get over there I'm gonna skip just for times sake now remember but Graham says this at the end of the seventh seal it's moving that cycle the rapture cycle now it's coming up close so the thing for you is remember that I speak to you the name of the Lord be prepared if you don't know what time something can happen to see that so that's why I brought this out we got to be ready at any time and remember we had somebody to speak of the name of Lord to us William Branham and we must remember these things we must keep all these things right in our forefront of our minds I think these are my last four you let me look I think I got a couple more yeah they've got four or five more there must be someone rise up that's got to come for its thus saith the Lord Malachi the fourth chapter that's exactly what he said would be the sign just before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord I'll send you Elijah what will he do he turned the hearts of the children back to the doctor and see that the doctor and all these doctors I just preached right marriage and divorce baptism God had all these things he turns our hearts back to the by doctrine of the fathers back to the Bible are these denominational difference and come back to the Bible back to God that's what he would do notice what a time we're living in now look he says again we stand today with thus saith the Lord that the water baptism in the last days is to be in the name of Jesus Christ he said another man will stand up perform miracles a trinitarian just showing the anointing falls on the just and the unjust but the Bible said in the last days he would send the spirit of Elijah would call the people the Church of God back to the original faith like it was in the beginning of the word that word was confirmed the Son of Man these last days the same as it was in Sodom yesterday today and forever he promised to do it's God's promise it's thus saith the Lord now remember it's thus saith the Lord it will come to pass in this day now search over the world take every call every clan I think every man every church I charge you in Christ's name to do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers are taken sitting right now I'm sorry too consideration anywhere you wanted to go and see if it isn't on the earth right now let the spirit of Elijah that's quite a challenge he says I challenge you in Jesus Christ's name see if the spirit of Elijah isn't on the earth right now my hallelujah thank God what a what a man who knows what he's talking about that's a man who knows what he's talking about thus saith the Lord he said the spirit of Elijah is here right now thus saith the Lord let's then this last quote now church this is what we need to do I've said in all along what we need to do but this is ultimately what we need to do if we I could just put it really generally we need to unite with thus saith the Lord God is uniting his bride she's coming together from the east in the West the north of the south there's a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the rapture God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens earth will pass away but my words will never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she's the bride that's right and she's United herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah let's give them a round of applause amen Malachi you see Church huh all these doctrines aren't can see how the doctrines are important we have to unite with all the word we can't say well I just believe these certain things we got to unite with all the Bible look at all those well there's four there and we know there's more than that there's three plus there's 10 I just got through let's see 13 16 18 I just got through 18 of them today what about all the other ones we got to unite with thus saith the Lord that's what we're supposed to do the move is on the bride it moves on you and I let's keep doing all we do Church let's keep supporting the move of God the work of God our local church let's support it with our tithes and offerings that supported with our attendance let's support it with main thing that's supported with our prayers that's the only way anything gets done that's the only way faith muscles get established is when we pray in the spirit how many believe that I believe that all my heart only way anything gets done is through prayer amen prayer it's done through prayer let's bow our heads here I want to pray with you I want to ask God as we approach 2019 to help us to unite with every thus saith the Lord there is and especially with prayer as I said I know you believe it same Adil's us hardest with prayer it's easier to do everything else but prayer is the most it's the most powerful weapon so Satan our battles us the most powerfully against our prayer life and I think we all want to see our neighbors save don't we I want to see my neighbors saved I want to see people saved it only comes through this prayer this dedication to God let's pray here Heavenly Father these are your people or they love your word I love your work ever since I've heard at Lord
