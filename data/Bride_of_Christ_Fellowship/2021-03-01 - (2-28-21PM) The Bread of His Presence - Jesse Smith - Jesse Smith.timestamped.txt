[31:12] lord i want to pray with that same
[31:13] compassion lord jesus help him today
[31:15] lord

[31:17] strong and very courageous lord god
[31:20] trusting in you and father anoint me god
[31:22] to preach your word lord and i just pray
[31:24] god you prepare our hearts for
[31:25] this communion this bread father and
[31:27] this wine lord as it represents your
[31:29] body
[31:29] and blood and i pray speak to us by the
[31:31] holy spirit
[31:33] bless each and every heart in jesus
[31:34] christ's name and the saint said
[31:36] amen god bless you as you're being
[31:38] seated praise god
[31:42] all right so let's take about an hour
[31:44] here we'll try to preach god's
[31:46] word
[31:58] the bread of his presence praise god i
[32:00] just have a few quotes i didn't have
[32:01] time you know i was i
[32:02] i didn't know my son was gonna have a
[32:04] fever there so anyways he's doing a
[32:06] little better
[32:06] uh but in other words i normally have
[32:08] time to put all the quotes on there but
[32:10] i don't know
[32:11] i only have time for a few quotes so
[32:12] forgive me and i'm all nervous
[32:15] so see can you switch over there okay um
[32:20] so uh we'll look into this thought here
[32:22] this is kind of what my whole book is
[32:23] based upon and
[32:24] i did talk to a publisher on tuesday so
[32:26] i'm going to go ahead and go forward and
[32:29] he said it should be ready to be
[32:30] published by uh may the end of may
[32:32] so i was really excited about that it's
[32:35] so long it's 270
[32:37] 000 words so he said it's like
[32:40] it'd be like three inches thick and i
[32:42] was telling brother
[32:43] jose right now i was telling brother
[32:46] brian i said that's how the word of god
[32:48] is brother brahm said when the seals
[32:49] were open he said it the bible became a
[32:51] new bible
[32:52] and he said all the loose ends were tied
[32:55] together
[32:56] in other words everything like you can
[32:58] you can see how white represents god but
[33:00] satan also sees that right uh you can
[33:03] see how oil where do we get the
[33:05] oil and wine in the third seal where
[33:06] does that come what does the oil mean
[33:08] you got to go to zechariah to find that
[33:09] it means the spirit of god amen
[33:12] and so that's what the holy spirit did
[33:13] through the seals
[33:15] you know you ripped off all the seals
[33:16] and now the bible's a new bible
[33:18] and you can tie it all together it all
[33:21] makes sense now praise god
[33:22] and as i found as i started writing i
[33:24] thought oh i'll be done within a few
[33:25] months well it took me 26 months to
[33:28] finish that thing
[33:29] i could still add to it but i just want
[33:31] to encourage it
[33:32] i'll probably be i'll probably put make
[33:33] it two books i'm actually going to
[33:34] probably make it two books because it's
[33:35] just too big
[33:37] just too big to be one so i'll probably
[33:38] break it up into two and just as we read
[33:40] this scripture i kind of got that
[33:41] inspiration
[33:43] because the bible said put it in two
[33:45] stacks amen
[33:46] two rows so i'm going to divide it up
[33:49] you know
[33:50] six mystery six mysteries just like that
[33:53] praise god
[33:54] so we'll see but i'm really excited and
[33:56] uh we'll get going on that by god's
[33:58] grace
[33:59] so let's look at this here now i got
[34:01] this kind of thought from
[34:02] brother graham teaches this and sirs it
[34:04] says the end time
[34:06] he said the seventh angel revelation 10
[34:08] is the seventh church age messenger
[34:11] and the days of the voice of the seventh
[34:13] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[34:14] mystery of god
[34:15] should be finished
[34:19] he said now sounding forth this
[34:20] messenger the seventh angel here is
[34:22] sounding forth his message to the
[34:24] laodicean church
[34:25] notice his type of message now it wasn't
[34:27] to the first angel
[34:28] wasn't given to that not the second
[34:31] angel third fourth
[34:32] fifth sixth but in this is the seventh
[34:34] angel
[34:35] that had this type of message what was
[34:37] it
[34:38] notice this type of message finishing
[34:40] all the mysteries of god
[34:42] uh that are written in the book the
[34:44] seventh angel is winding up all the
[34:46] mysteries that's lying
[34:47] loose ended all throughout these
[34:49] organizations and denominations and
[34:50] seventh angel gathers them up
[34:52] and finishes the entire mystery that's
[34:54] what the bible said
[34:56] finishes the mystery of the written book
[35:01] and then he says now let's note a few of
[35:03] these mysteries here if you want to
[35:04] write them down first i'll take what
[35:06] scofield says matthew 13.
[35:08] if you'd like to type some of them down
[35:10] if you haven't got the scofield bible
[35:12] now if you have scofield you just go to
[35:13] chapter 13 of matthew and
[35:15] you'll see schofield lists 11 of the
[35:17] mysteries but it's only 11
[35:19] and there's got to be a 12th because
[35:21] we're we're in the we're in the holy
[35:23] place spiritually right
[35:25] we see the seven candlesticks jesus
[35:27] stands
[35:28] in front of the seven candlesticks right
[35:30] in the book of revelation
[35:31] so there's got to be uh there's got to
[35:34] be the 12 mysteries and there's got to
[35:36] be
[35:36] uh the altar of incense so there's got
[35:40] to be 12.
[35:41] he says now and then he quotes matthew
[35:45] 13 11 and he answered and sent them
[35:46] because it's given to you his disciples
[35:49] it is given to you to know the mysteries
[35:51] of the kingdom of heaven but not to them
[35:53] but to them it is not given the
[35:55] mysteries here is the mystery a mystery
[35:57] in scripture is a
[35:58] previously hidden truth now divinely
[36:00] revealed
[36:01] but which is supernatural element still
[36:04] remains
[36:05] despite the revelation the greater
[36:07] mysteries and the great mysteries
[36:09] are number one the mystery of the
[36:11] kingdom of heaven i'm gonna skip some of
[36:12] this here just to hit the names of them
[36:14] second the mystery of israel's blindness
[36:17] the third the mystery of the translation
[36:18] of the living saints that's the rapture
[36:20] the fourth the mystery of the new
[36:22] testament church composed of both jew
[36:23] and gentile
[36:24] i haven't preached that one yet um the
[36:26] fifth mystery of the church is the bride
[36:28] i'm on that one right now
[36:29] the sixth mystery the living christ
[36:31] saying yesterday today and forever
[36:33] uh that's many places like that that's
[36:36] uh
[36:36] christ in you the hope of glory i
[36:38] believe if i'm not mistaken the seventh
[36:40] mystery of god even in christ as the
[36:42] incarnate fullness of the godhead
[36:43] embodied in whom is all divine wisdom
[36:46] the eighth is the mystery of godliness
[36:48] restored to man that's the statue of
[36:49] perfect man
[36:50] the ninth mystery is the mystery of
[36:52] iniquity found in second thessalonians
[36:54] the tenth is the seven stars that's the
[36:56] seven messengers of the seven church
[36:58] ages
[36:59] and the eleventh is mystery babylon the
[37:00] prostitute now the twelfth i found was
[37:03] the mystery of god's will
[37:05] because paul says in ephesians one god
[37:07] has made known unto us
[37:08] the mystery of his will and what's his
[37:11] will his wills that all would be saved
[37:13] right god would that all men be saved
[37:16] and then his will
[37:16] is that not only be saved but be filled
[37:19] with the holy ghost amen
[37:20] for he said whosoever will let him come
[37:22] and drink of the waters of life amen
[37:25] amen
[37:25] so we know it's god's will god's mystery
[37:28] is is he wants everyone saved and he's
[37:30] offering
[37:31] the baptism of the holy ghost to
[37:32] everyone but only the
[37:34] redeemed will come to it now like what
[37:37] he says here and i mentioned this in the
[37:39] book
[37:39] that's some of the mysteries that the
[37:41] angels supposed to wind up see all the
[37:43] mystery
[37:44] all the mysteries of god and the other
[37:46] man that's
[37:47] may i say i like this may i say this
[37:49] with reverence not referring to myself
[37:51] but referring to the angel of god the
[37:53] holy spirit
[37:55] amen the serpency that's been hidden all
[37:58] through the years now
[37:59] the bible never calls it a mystery but i
[38:01] believe it's part of the mystery of
[38:02] iniquity
[38:03] because that's how sin and iniquity came
[38:05] into the world through the serpent seed
[38:08] the grace straightened out not grace but
[38:10] real true grace and i believe that's
[38:11] part of
[38:12] the fifth mystery
[38:15] because you can have grace you can
[38:17] receive grace but then you can
[38:18] do despite unto the spirit of grace in
[38:20] other words you can have
[38:22] salvation you can have your name on the
[38:23] book but then you can forfeit it
[38:25] right but true grace is obeying the
[38:28] commands
[38:29] and then he says no such thing as
[38:31] eternal burning hell you'll burn for
[38:33] millions of years but anything that was
[38:34] eternal
[38:35] never had a beginning or an end and hell
[38:37] was created all these mysteries
[38:40] then he says the mystery of the baptism
[38:41] of the holy ghost now this is a repeat
[38:43] because he mentioned it earlier without
[38:46] sensation
[38:48] but the person of christ performing in
[38:49] you the same works that he did now did
[38:51] jesus do miracles
[38:53] yes right so if you're born again you're
[38:56] going to have christ in you
[38:58] to do miracles amen or do one of the
[39:00] nine gifts of the holy spirit
[39:02] amen might just be the word of wisdom
[39:04] might just be a knowledge
[39:06] might just be prophecy it might be
[39:08] miracles it might be one of those but
[39:10] it's going to be christ in you doing his
[39:12] life amen
[39:13] living his life the mystery of water
[39:15] baptism now that's a part of the first
[39:16] mystery that god had
[39:18] where the extreme trinitarianism has
[39:20] brought in the titles father son and
[39:21] holy ghost and the mystery of the
[39:23] godhead being
[39:24] filled fulfilled in the baptism in the
[39:26] name of jesus christ according to the
[39:27] book of revelations that the church in
[39:28] this time was to receive
[39:30] there are some of the mysteries now like
[39:31] this one the pillar of fire returning
[39:34] back amen
[39:35] that thing's supposed to take place and
[39:37] we see it oh how we could go on
[39:39] naming the mysteries now the pillar of
[39:42] fire fits in revelation 10 right
[39:44] because all the mysteries of god must be
[39:46] finished right
[39:48] and so when the mystery of god is
[39:49] finished we know the bible's got to be
[39:51] revealed
[39:51] and it's got to be done through a
[39:52] prophet praise god and so the
[39:55] pillar of fire would have to return in
[39:57] order to give a prophet the revelation
[39:59] of the old testament
[40:00] and the new amen i think that might be
[40:03] all i got as far as pictures i got the
[40:05] same picture there
[40:06] and oh yeah i just laid it out like this
[40:08] i preached this about four years ago so
[40:10] i don't think i've shown it since then
[40:11] have i okay so
[40:13] i'll leave that up there just for a
[40:14] moment okay now if you've got your
[40:16] bibles here let's head back to
[40:17] leviticus here
[40:20] now why did god choose twelve now this
[40:22] was a fresh revelation just struck me a
[40:24] few
[40:24] uh days ago why did god choose 12 who
[40:28] knows what the number 12 well don't say
[40:30] it out loud if you don't know
[40:30] who knows what the number 12 means in
[40:32] the bible
[40:34] government 12 is government
[40:37] or rulership or the third word that
[40:39] brought it to make it more sense to us
[40:41] is kingdom right
[40:45] because what do you have tribes of
[40:47] israel
[40:48] so israel was governed by 12 tribes
[40:51] right
[40:53] so when joshua wanted to go over or
[40:54] moses want to go over what'd he do he
[40:55] sent a spy
[40:57] from every tribe right when moses sent
[40:59] him over but then joshua learned that's
[41:00] too many and you can't
[41:02] send people that aren't believers over
[41:04] there right don't send believers
[41:06] or don't send make believers over to the
[41:08] things of god because they're going to
[41:09] deny it anyway right
[41:11] he learned and said oh you only send two
[41:14] only seven real believers over there to
[41:16] look into the promises of god amen
[41:19] anyways 12 tribes of israel
[41:23] jesus said if he asked he could get 12
[41:25] legions of angels
[41:27] right jesus said the 12
[41:30] tribes will be judged by the 12 apostles
[41:34] right so see we even see 12 for the new
[41:38] testament rulership
[41:40] right so we're not just done with 12
[41:42] just because we're in the new testament
[41:43] no god's going to keep the 12 going
[41:45] that's now that's why now there's 24
[41:47] seats now
[41:48] amen before the throne of god amen amen
[41:52] because there's 12 in the old 12 in the
[41:54] new why because there are two kingdoms
[41:56] amen
[41:57] there's the kingdom of the natural with
[41:58] israel but then there's the spiritual
[42:00] kingdom by the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:02] amen amen
[42:03] hallelujah so you have those they have
[42:06] those two kingdoms
[42:08] but we know jesus says that these 12 are
[42:10] going to rule over the other 12.
[42:13] oh that's awesome and then you have 12
[42:16] pieces
[42:17] of shoe bread in the holy place
[42:20] now it's through the shoe bread that we
[42:22] understand these 12
[42:24] mystery doctrines because brother madam
[42:26] saw he quoted them from schofield
[42:29] and of course as you know each one has a
[42:31] scripture
[42:32] so these are not just things you know
[42:33] brother graham chose well i think i'll
[42:35] make the rapture mystery or the godhead
[42:37] no the bible actually calls them
[42:39] mysteries how many know that
[42:41] the bible actually calls the rapture a
[42:43] mystery
[42:44] paul said that first corinthians 15
[42:46] right the godhead is called a mystery in
[42:48] colossians 2 verse 2.
[42:49] these are all called literal mysteries
[42:51] and then revelation 10 says somebody's
[42:53] got to come
[42:54] and finish the mystery of god amen then
[42:57] somebody's got to receive that
[42:58] and then prophesy that again to every
[43:00] nation kingdom
[43:01] people and tongue that's you and i
[43:03] praise god amen i'm glad to be a part of
[43:05] it praise god
[43:06] that's why i thought when i saw that
[43:08] video like uh you know the world's going
[43:10] to end after
[43:11] the election of november i thought well
[43:13] how can that be because i'm writing this
[43:15] book and
[43:15] i i think this book is going to be a
[43:17] part of that finishing the mystery of
[43:18] god
[43:19] no i'm not i don't have thou say the
[43:21] lord on that but that was my thought
[43:22] brother johnny i thought well
[43:24] how can it be so that time you know
[43:26] brother amen i thought well
[43:28] i feel like i got a part in this in
[43:29] other in other words we've heard
[43:31] some churches ha or some countries
[43:32] haven't even heard the message of the
[43:34] hour
[43:35] some of them it hasn't even gotten in
[43:36] there there's no message churches like
[43:38] even in thailand a couple of people have
[43:39] heard about
[43:40] them and said there's still no message
[43:41] churches there so think about the
[43:43] millions of people there
[43:44] that haven't heard it but god said it's
[43:46] going to be preached to every nation
[43:48] amen and so what i mean is that we need
[43:51] to keep spreading it praise god and may
[43:52] god have grace to open up these
[43:54] countries praise god to get the
[43:56] missionaries back in there
[43:58] so i believe we have a part in this i
[44:00] believe we have a part to take this word
[44:02] these revelations and then preach them
[44:05] again to prophesy them again
[44:07] to every nation kindred people and
[44:09] tongue
[44:11] now if you click on the word shoe bread
[44:14] in the
[44:14] in the hebrew it means face or presence
[44:19] that's awesome he said the bread of so
[44:23] uh the smith's bible's dictionary says
[44:25] it has the title the bread of his space
[44:29] now the word face always means presence
[44:31] so when god talks about his presence
[44:32] coming down
[44:33] it's as if his if
[44:36] sorry it's as if his face is here and
[44:39] we're looking into the face of god
[44:42] amen forgive me here i'm stuttering here
[44:44] i'm a little nervous i want to kind of
[44:45] go too fast
[44:47] so this indicates it was through the
[44:50] bread
[44:51] god's face could be seen amen
[44:55] it was only through the bread right now
[44:57] as you know it of course that meant that
[44:59] it meant it was the next step towards
[45:01] god's face
[45:03] right because how many remember the
[45:04] waters of separation you couldn't even
[45:06] come
[45:07] into the the courts you couldn't even
[45:08] come into the outer court
[45:10] until you were sprinkled with the waters
[45:12] of separation the waters of the red
[45:14] heifer right
[45:15] the ashes with water you couldn't even
[45:17] come in and worship
[45:19] unless your first sprinkle then the
[45:20] bible said we're sprinkled with the
[45:22] blood of jesus christ
[45:23] unto obedience in the faith amen praise
[45:26] god amen
[45:28] in other words when you first repent of
[45:29] your sins you're sprinkled with an
[45:31] anointing
[45:32] amen and then you can come in and then
[45:34] you can see my
[45:35] here's the altar the brazen altar and
[45:38] you see the lamb die now you really
[45:40] experience the cross amen
[45:42] now you really know oh my and then they
[45:44] got the labor the water baptism amen
[45:47] hallelujah praise god amen now most
[45:50] churches just live out there right
[45:51] brothers
[45:52] right sisters most churches just live
[45:54] out there how many do you know that
[45:56] actually come into this
[45:57] next area the holy place
[46:00] not many whatever church listens to
[46:04] or whatever church reads clarence larkin
[46:06] they might
[46:07] because larkin believed this too he
[46:09] taught he taught the
[46:10] uh seven churches and everything like
[46:12] that now he didn't name the messengers
[46:14] that's where brother branham gave him
[46:15] god gave brother branham a further
[46:17] revelation of that well brother abraham
[46:19] took most of the dates from larkin on
[46:20] the church ages and
[46:22] he took he took some of the types and
[46:24] not all of them but some of the types
[46:25] from there
[46:26] so and then god revealed to larkin clara
[46:30] i need to study his life a little more
[46:31] actually uh could god reveal to him that
[46:34] there's oh the bible names all these
[46:36] mysteries he found 11 but there's
[46:37] actually 12.
[46:38] amen oh my
[46:41] and so see you're trying to get to the
[46:44] face of god amen
[46:45] brother adam says it like this maybe i
[46:47] can find that quote here
[46:48] uh brother brahm says it like this
[46:52] he says you're not worshiping he said
[46:54] you might have got sprinkled out there
[46:56] but you're not a worshiper yet amen you
[46:58] might have got sprinkled there
[47:00] outside the the gate with the waters of
[47:02] separation he said but you're truly not
[47:04] worshiping yet
[47:06] having fellowship yet until you get into
[47:08] the holy see of holies
[47:10] amen we're saying about you think about
[47:11] this morning brother how how fitting
[47:13] praise god how fitting
[47:15] amen glory so see you're starting on
[47:18] your road to worship right
[47:20] and how many believe that song how many
[47:22] want to go past the outer court amen
[47:24] and you want to worship in his presence
[47:27] amen
[47:27] you want to worship in his face well
[47:29] well the bible said this is the bread of
[47:31] his face
[47:32] so as you approach god yes you got to be
[47:34] sprinkled you got to be
[47:35] forgiven from all the dead things you've
[47:37] touched or or any of the uncleanness
[47:40] then you gotta have a sacrifice you
[47:43] gotta remember the cross and then you
[47:44] gotta be
[47:45] have the water baptism and then you
[47:46] gotta come in you gotta recognize the
[47:48] light of the church age
[47:49] you gotta see which light you're living
[47:51] in amen praise god
[47:53] and then you you feast on the bread of
[47:55] his presence
[47:56] right but you're still not done
[47:59] right how many know you're still not
[48:00] done there's more to the tabernacle
[48:02] than the candlesticks and the shewbread
[48:03] right because the bible says
[48:05] though i have the gift of prophecy like
[48:08] balaam
[48:09] yet understand all mysteries now here's
[48:11] where we finally get to the message
[48:13] that's why this scripture is so
[48:14] prophetic
[48:15] this scripture is such a prophecy the
[48:18] bible said the mysteries couldn't be
[48:19] finished to the end time
[48:21] right and so here it says you understand
[48:24] all mysteries they couldn't understand
[48:26] all mysteries till right now
[48:27] praise god this is such a prophetic
[48:31] scripture
[48:32] it was specifically for our day amen
[48:35] so you can have the gift of prophecy and
[48:37] church even we
[48:38] we can understand all mysteries and have
[48:41] all knowledge
[48:42] and though i have all faith so i can
[48:44] remove mountains and if i have not
[48:46] charity i'm nothing so see god is
[48:49] calling us he's calling us into his
[48:51] presence
[48:52] and eating the bread is part of that but
[48:55] even after that there's still one more
[48:57] there's still the altar of incense
[48:59] there's still a prayer life
[49:01] where we must be devoted in prayer we
[49:03] must be
[49:04] have the service of prayer we must
[49:06] approach god
[49:07] and we must give him the right sacrifice
[49:10] we must pray the right way amen
[49:12] like he taught us to pray our father
[49:14] amen
[49:15] who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[49:17] praise god
[49:20] so that's a very uh quick summary there
[49:23] of what i'm trying to get to here
[49:27] so it's through the bread we can see
[49:29] god's face
[49:30] now israel's high priest could only
[49:32] enter that holiest once a year we know
[49:34] and that represented seeing god's face
[49:36] right
[49:37] but every sabbath so every saturday god
[49:40] was having constant communion with in
[49:42] israel through the continual shoe bread
[49:45] now let's read that that's
[49:46] second chronicles 2 4 and i'm done with
[49:48] visuals so acacia if you want could you
[49:49] switch over there because we could see
[49:50] it
[49:51] that's all i had time for i just had a
[49:52] few minutes before service to put a few
[49:54] up there
[49:56] so let's pull that up second chronicles
[49:59] 2 4.
[50:06] second chronicles 2 4. so i want to give
[50:09] you the
[50:10] uh the scripture on this and i believe
[50:12] it it really helps our attitude with the
[50:15] mysteries of god
[50:18] you know you've heard different
[50:19] preachers say oh there we're too much on
[50:21] the mysteries we need the holy ghost
[50:23] well i
[50:24] uh i think they're all together i don't
[50:26] see how you can get rid of them because
[50:27] the holy ghost is a mystery
[50:30] being born the bible said the mystery of
[50:31] christ in you the hope of glory
[50:33] you can't even get the you can't even go
[50:35] in the rapture unless you understand the
[50:37] mystery right
[50:38] and you receive the the substance of the
[50:41] mystery of christ in you the hope of
[50:43] glory
[50:44] amen hallelujah
[50:48] so
[50:51] second cro i'm sorry second chronicles
[50:53] honey i'm sorry not corinthians my fault
[50:55] second chronicles 2 4 chronicles 2 4.
[51:00] so every sabbath the priests would
[51:01] gather in there
[51:03] and they knew they were going to have a
[51:05] feast
[51:06] they knew they were going to be eating
[51:08] the bread in god's presence
[51:13] here we go behold i build and house to
[51:16] the name of the lord my god to dedicate
[51:18] it to him and to burn before him sweet
[51:20] incense
[51:21] and for the continual shoe bread and for
[51:23] the burnt offerings morning and evening
[51:24] on the sabbaths
[51:26] and on the new moons and the solemn
[51:28] feasts of the lord our god this is the
[51:30] ordinance forever now just leave that up
[51:31] there here
[51:32] now look at this i like how it says it's
[51:34] continual shoe bread
[51:36] we're continually eating the bread of
[51:38] his presence
[51:40] amen we eat on his bread now remember
[51:42] the bible said we read it
[51:43] it's most holy to the lord amen
[51:47] this word that we're preaching this
[51:49] message we received is holy to god
[51:52] amen amen god it says this is a sacred
[51:54] word
[51:55] this is a sacred revelation and you must
[51:57] continually
[51:58] eat the bread of my face here
[52:02] every sabbath you're gonna eat it now i
[52:03] like this too the sweet prayer amen you
[52:06] gotta
[52:06] continually eat the bread and you gotta
[52:08] have sweet prayers go before god amen
[52:12] like we said not discouraged prayers not
[52:14] weak prayers but prayers of faith as we
[52:16] heard this morning
[52:17] strong prayers of faith amen hallelujah
[52:20] it's sweet prayers trusting god knowing
[52:23] he's with you
[52:24] i know that he'll never leave me lord i
[52:25] know you'll never forsake me i know you
[52:27] hear my prayers
[52:28] i know you'll answer in your time in
[52:30] your season i know everything will work
[52:32] together for my good because i love the
[52:34] lord
[52:34] amen see it's continual
[52:38] it was laying before the lord look at on
[52:40] first samuel 21
[52:42] 6. first samuel 21 6. so you have to go
[52:44] through every shoe bread scripture
[52:46] and you see oh it's continual shoe bread
[52:49] it's the bread of his face
[52:51] and here it says it was laying before
[52:54] the lord so in other words
[52:56] god had set the table church just like
[52:58] he did today he used me though to do it
[53:01] right
[53:01] and any preacher who's doing communion
[53:03] today the bible said he sets it before
[53:06] us first samuel 21
[53:08] 6. first samuel 21 6.
[53:13] here we go
[53:16] so the priest gave him hollowed bread
[53:18] for there was no bread there but the
[53:20] shoe bread
[53:20] that was taken from before the lord to
[53:23] put hot bread
[53:24] in the day when it was taken away praise
[53:27] god so they would always switch it out
[53:29] every sabbath now the old bread that was
[53:30] there it was still fresh because it was
[53:32] in god's presence but it wasn't hot
[53:34] it was kind of cooled down i like that
[53:36] don't you like that hot bread
[53:37] and that reminds you of this age must
[53:39] not be lukewarm
[53:40] we must be hot praise god and so god has
[53:43] a hot bread for his hot children
[53:46] because they're hot on fire for the lord
[53:48] amen
[53:49] but see this bread was before god in
[53:51] other words god was
[53:53] can i say it like this god was waiting
[53:55] to meet them there
[53:57] praise god god was saying i've got bread
[53:59] for you now i i
[54:00] pulled off some pieces there for jose
[54:02] and i so we could have it but god was
[54:04] waiting he said
[54:05] this is the bread of my presence you
[54:07] experience my presence
[54:09] as you eat this bread praise god now
[54:12] remember what it means for us
[54:13] the word of god now the beautiful thing
[54:16] is we can read about the mysteries and
[54:17] we can hear brother man preach them
[54:19] and that means we're in god's presence
[54:21] praise god right
[54:22] we can live in it constantly live in his
[54:25] presence amen
[54:26] amen oh that's so true hallelujah
[54:30] live in his presence man and that's what
[54:33] i've done these last two years i've
[54:34] written this book by the grace of god
[54:36] i've lived in his presence praise god
[54:38] i've had shouting spells i've had
[54:40] crying spells i've had to raise my hands
[54:42] when god has shown me things you know
[54:44] as i've just lit i just lived in his
[54:46] presence amen so when you find the word
[54:48] of god or you're meditating on the word
[54:49] like we saw with joshua
[54:51] when you meditate on the word you
[54:53] experience his presence amen amen
[54:55] hallelujah and church that's just not
[54:57] for preachers that's for everybody
[54:59] praise god
[55:00] now some people may have more i'll
[55:02] preachers man more time than others of
[55:03] course
[55:04] but everybody should make time to spend
[55:06] in god's presence amen
[55:08] because in his presence is fullness of
[55:10] joy
[55:12] now look it's before the lord it's
[55:14] continual
[55:15] and when it's lay there it's laid down
[55:17] there and it's hot
[55:18] before the lord so you learn church this
[55:21] lesson
[55:22] to have continual communion with god
[55:25] you come into his presence and you feast
[55:28] on his bread
[55:29] amen that's having continual
[55:32] communion with god every sabbath they
[55:36] would just eat and enjoy and say thank
[55:37] you lord for this meal
[55:38] thank you lord for another week ah we do
[55:41] the same thing amen
[55:43] we come to the house of god thank you
[55:44] lord that i'm a christian amen
[55:46] came back here for another meal thank
[55:48] you for feeding my hungry soul amen
[55:50] glory i think god has really helped my
[55:53] voice because i've been preaching hard
[55:54] the last three weeks and
[55:55] and so far hasn't hurt my voice too much
[55:57] praise god he's been merciful to me
[56:00] very merciful so see
[56:04] this this bread is
[56:07] represents eating before his face i'm
[56:10] eating his bread and i'm communing with
[56:13] the lord
[56:14] amen now the bible says this i want to
[56:18] read
[56:18] exodus 25 30. i think i read that
[56:21] earlier exodus 25
[56:22] 30. let me flip to that
[56:26] another thought here you see with this
[56:27] exodus 25 30.
[56:29] i was gonna see i was racing you who
[56:30] could get there first yeah
[56:32] and thou shalt set the tape i'm sorry
[56:34] upon the table
[56:36] shoe bread before me always amen
[56:39] anytime you're hungry god's got bread
[56:41] for you praise god
[56:43] amen anytime you want to be in this
[56:45] presence and you want to
[56:46] feast on a meal with god it's always
[56:48] there for you amen
[56:49] it would never be absent right as soon
[56:51] as they took it off
[56:53] uh you i read some of the historians and
[56:55] they were very careful
[56:56] just the very second the the plate left
[56:59] the other one was on it right away
[57:01] because they knew the scripture that
[57:03] said the bread was always there they
[57:05] they took such careful efforts to make
[57:08] sure god's word was kept
[57:10] and the holy spirit does the same today
[57:12] amen amen we're careful to keep all the
[57:14] word right we're careful
[57:15] uh to confess our sins we're we're
[57:17] careful to uh believe god's word
[57:20] we're careful to say i'm healed when
[57:21] we're sick praise god
[57:23] we're careful to bring the sick up here
[57:25] and pray for them when they're sick
[57:26] because we know god keeps his word oh
[57:30] hallelujah
[57:33] when is it placed there it's always
[57:35] before the lord in the holy place i've
[57:37] had that you ever had that
[57:38] you stayed up a little late to study and
[57:40] you got really good at studying late at
[57:42] night
[57:42] you're supposed to i'm supposed to go to
[57:44] bed early but i get in a good study and
[57:45] oh
[57:46] see because there's always it's hard to
[57:48] want to go to bed when there's fresh
[57:50] fresh bread there right
[57:53] that's what happened when that song came
[57:54] to me it's like fresh bread i went i
[57:56] really wanted to go to sleep i had i had
[57:58] to get up at 4 30 that next tuesday
[57:59] morning
[58:00] but then the song two songs of god came
[58:02] to me that night fresh bread
[58:04] i couldn't i couldn't get away from it i
[58:06] wanted to go to sleep but god wanted to
[58:08] have fellowship with me praise god
[58:10] amen and so that's what the scripture
[58:13] says here
[58:14] he says he always has it ready for us
[58:17] whether it's morning in the early
[58:19] whether it's late at night whether it's
[58:20] noon whenever you have a chance to feast
[58:23] with god
[58:23] god's got fresh bread for you
[58:26] see he always wanted fresh bread
[58:29] because the people would approach him
[58:31] daily in worship
[58:33] there's never a time where they would be
[58:34] lacking something to eat
[58:37] they were always laying there 12 loaves
[58:39] were laying there
[58:40] and the bible said it was a most holy
[58:43] offering
[58:44] when the 12 new lows were set in place
[58:47] now look at this each tribe was
[58:50] represented as having a loaf
[58:53] amen each one was
[58:56] having a loaf and that represented
[58:57] communion with god
[59:00] through the 12 weekly cakes praise god
[59:04] so god sustained his earthly kingdom
[59:07] through his
[59:07] holy bread today he sustains his
[59:11] spiritual kingdom
[59:12] through his spiritual bread amen
[59:15] that's beautiful praise god oh my
[59:19] thank god uh pull up exodus 19 6
[59:30] so the earthly kingdom of israel was
[59:32] sustained by 12 cakes
[59:35] they were innocent they could eat in his
[59:37] presence through the 12 cakes
[59:39] and so can the spiritual exodus 19
[59:45] six and he shall be unto me a kingdom of
[59:48] priests
[59:49] and a holy nation these are the words
[59:50] which thou shalt speak
[59:52] unto the children of israel amen it's a
[59:55] kingdom right it's a rulership
[59:57] it's a government and god said you're
[59:59] going to be my kingdom
[1:00:00] and i'm going to feed you in my presence
[1:00:02] you'll always have a place at my table
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] oh i'm going to feed you fresh bread
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:10] and you're going to be fed as you
[1:00:12] approach my face praise god
[1:00:15] beautiful picture isn't it
[1:00:19] so god is approached and known
[1:00:22] through eating his fresh sacred word
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:26] jesus said he's the word of god and he
[1:00:28] said
[1:00:29] i am the bread of life church i think we
[1:00:32] need often reminders of that when we
[1:00:34] read our bible we're reading
[1:00:36] jesus we're eating the bread
[1:00:39] it's more than a book in other words
[1:00:41] there's life just laying there
[1:00:43] there's nourishment just waiting there
[1:00:45] praise god
[1:00:46] there's blessings just waiting there
[1:00:48] because jesus is there amen
[1:00:50] he said i am the bread amen hallelujah
[1:00:54] that's what we're symbolizing here
[1:00:56] i am the bread of life he says
[1:00:59] and look god's name is sacred or hollow
[1:01:03] just like he called it
[1:01:04] hallowed and shoe bread right he said
[1:01:07] this is a holy shoe bread well his name
[1:01:09] is holy praise god he is holy amen
[1:01:12] there are so many types here and
[1:01:15] remember
[1:01:15] paul likens true worship unto the
[1:01:18] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:01:20] we saw that on
[1:01:21] on wednesday night remember that
[1:01:24] so see there was no leaven
[1:01:28] it was christ his unleaven his sinless
[1:01:30] life praise god
[1:01:33] and paul said the thessalonians when
[1:01:36] they received his preaching they didn't
[1:01:37] receive it as the word of men
[1:01:39] but as it is in truth the word of god
[1:01:42] which effectually worketh also
[1:01:44] in them that believe how many believe
[1:01:46] the preaching of the
[1:01:48] of the word is god's word amen it's
[1:01:50] god's bread amen
[1:01:51] you don't take it as all that's just a
[1:01:53] man's idea you take it as that's my
[1:01:55] bread
[1:01:56] that's my sustainment that's my
[1:01:58] nourishment that's my life
[1:01:59] god's speaking to me amen
[1:02:03] that's how we approach the throne of god
[1:02:05] that's how we should approach every
[1:02:07] service god is going to speak today
[1:02:09] god is going to deliver his word not
[1:02:11] just the word of a pastor or a preacher
[1:02:13] but the word of god that lives and
[1:02:16] abides forever
[1:02:18] praise god yes jesus said and can you
[1:02:20] pull this up matthew 19 28
[1:02:22] acacia matthew 19 28 that's my honey i
[1:02:25] was talking about this morning right
[1:02:27] that's my honey that's my only honey
[1:02:28] right there
[1:02:30] matthew 19 28
[1:02:33] and jesus said to them verily i say unto
[1:02:35] you that ye which have followed me in
[1:02:37] the regeneration
[1:02:38] when the son of man shall sit in the
[1:02:40] throne of his glory this is the
[1:02:41] millennium right
[1:02:43] because right now he's on the father's
[1:02:44] throne in his on his throne
[1:02:46] but here jesus is on his own throne as
[1:02:49] son of david
[1:02:51] ye also shall sit upon 12 thrones
[1:02:54] judging the 12 tribes of israel
[1:02:58] look at that the 12 new testament
[1:03:01] testament governors
[1:03:03] governing over the 12 old testament ones
[1:03:08] so see this entire christian government
[1:03:11] represents
[1:03:12] the jew and gentile believers who are
[1:03:15] privileged
[1:03:16] to have god's fellowship through the
[1:03:18] word in the times of the gentiles right
[1:03:20] now the church ages
[1:03:22] praise god
[1:03:26] now and here's the real application
[1:03:28] israel could only have
[1:03:30] communion through the 12 cakes that's
[1:03:32] right
[1:03:34] because they were the kingdom of priests
[1:03:35] so this should help prove to us church
[1:03:37] that we're
[1:03:38] we're one of the few churches that
[1:03:39] actually have con communion with christ
[1:03:42] because we're eating the 12
[1:03:43] revelations of the mysteries
[1:03:47] when was the last time you remember the
[1:03:49] last time you tried to share a mystery
[1:03:51] with somebody
[1:03:52] and they spit it out and i'm talking
[1:03:54] spiritually right
[1:03:56] you tried to give them fresh bread oh
[1:03:57] you should try some of this
[1:03:59] fresh bread it's shoe bread it's it's
[1:04:02] straight
[1:04:02] here's a little book on the rapture from
[1:04:04] brother branham
[1:04:05] i tried to give people my my book lately
[1:04:07] on modesty which has some of his
[1:04:09] mysteries in there right
[1:04:10] and they'll say no thanks and can you
[1:04:13] imagine that's bread this is not
[1:04:15] moldy bread this is fresh bread amen
[1:04:19] but satan's deceived them where they you
[1:04:22] know they want it
[1:04:23] like rubber band said they want to eat
[1:04:24] bread with mold on it you know they want
[1:04:25] to eat wiggle tails out of the trash
[1:04:27] brother graham says
[1:04:28] they think that's something delicious
[1:04:30] but we're offering
[1:04:32] bread we're offering fresh bread it's
[1:04:34] holy bread it's sacred bread
[1:04:36] it's continual bread it's the bread of
[1:04:38] his presence amen
[1:04:39] and that's what sustains us is the 12
[1:04:42] mysteries of god's word
[1:04:44] amen that's true because remember if you
[1:04:48] don't
[1:04:49] accept the mystery of the godhead you're
[1:04:51] going to eat what the leaven
[1:04:52] of the three persons and what does that
[1:04:55] produce
[1:04:56] in all these trinitarian preachers well
[1:04:57] you can see it adulteries
[1:05:00] uh love of money blasphemies
[1:05:03] they pretend to speak in tongues they
[1:05:05] get filled with demons instead
[1:05:06] right i mean look look look what it
[1:05:09] produces when they eat the wrong bread
[1:05:11] thank god brothers
[1:05:12] sisters thank god we got a holy bread
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:16] oh my god that's glorious that's just
[1:05:18] one of them there's 11 more
[1:05:21] that's just one
[1:05:24] the unholy the leaven bread that they're
[1:05:26] feeding out there in their churches
[1:05:28] oh but not you and i that we get to eat
[1:05:31] on the bread of his presence amen
[1:05:33] healthy bread church oh it's you think
[1:05:36] organic's healthy my this is uh
[1:05:38] devonic is that a word devineck this is
[1:05:41] divine bread in other words
[1:05:43] better than organic it's divine that's
[1:05:46] not the word but i'm just trying to make
[1:05:48] it sound like organic
[1:05:51] that's what we're feeding on
[1:05:54] remember that other one israel's
[1:05:55] spiritual blindness if they don't
[1:05:57] recognize that
[1:05:58] they're basically cursing jews they're
[1:06:01] cursing god's people
[1:06:02] they're they're saying god's people are
[1:06:04] in hell because they rejected the
[1:06:05] messiah
[1:06:06] but no we've got the fresh bread we
[1:06:08] still pray for them
[1:06:09] they're condemning jews and we're
[1:06:11] praying god bless them protect them
[1:06:13] have mercy on them why because our diet
[1:06:15] is the right diet
[1:06:18] and the bible says you can't curse what
[1:06:20] god is blessed
[1:06:26] see that's why it was so critical and at
[1:06:28] the end of every chapter i have
[1:06:30] all the rewards for receiving the
[1:06:33] revelation
[1:06:34] and all the consequences
[1:06:37] right because there's a consequence if
[1:06:38] you turn down the holy bread which thank
[1:06:40] god we haven't
[1:06:42] but if they turn down the holy bread
[1:06:44] there has to be a
[1:06:45] consequence if you don't want to eat
[1:06:47] god's bread that's fine
[1:06:48] you'll have to go back to the garlics of
[1:06:50] egypt right like brother says the
[1:06:51] garlics and onions and the
[1:06:53] what do they call it all the food of
[1:06:54] egypt but he's saying no my kingdom
[1:06:57] i'm calling them out of that that diet
[1:07:00] i'm calling them to a holy diet
[1:07:02] in heaven a diet of living and eating in
[1:07:05] my presence amen
[1:07:07] oh hallelujah thank god
[1:07:14] one of the worst ones is the baptism of
[1:07:16] the holy ghost like i said
[1:07:18] they're turning down the holy truth of
[1:07:21] it's three works of grace and what are
[1:07:22] they getting
[1:07:23] they're getting a bunch of false
[1:07:25] conversions
[1:07:26] they're getting a bunch of workers of
[1:07:28] iniquity like i said if you want to see
[1:07:30] a video
[1:07:30] i'll share the video with you here's the
[1:07:32] name of the uh youtube site
[1:07:35] uh apostasy report man that guy tears it
[1:07:38] up he goes through all these preachers
[1:07:40] and he shows how they're all preaching
[1:07:41] apostasy i was just watching that or
[1:07:44] listening to that yesterday i said thank
[1:07:45] you jesus my
[1:07:46] you have delivered us from such you
[1:07:48] delivered me from all my denominational
[1:07:50] doctrine
[1:07:50] i could have been doing the same things
[1:07:53] then the reason they do that
[1:07:56] is because their their diet's wrong
[1:07:58] right
[1:07:59] they're not eating on the real word of
[1:08:02] god
[1:08:03] right because when you eat on the word
[1:08:05] you grow up into christ as we saw this
[1:08:07] morning
[1:08:08] if you're really eating on the diet of a
[1:08:10] christian your roots go down and you
[1:08:13] you grow up higher in the spiritual
[1:08:15] things you reach out to the sun you
[1:08:17] reach out to
[1:08:18] uh your life-giving resource amen
[1:08:22] but if you don't we know what happens
[1:08:25] they
[1:08:25] they are corrupted and die right
[1:08:30] i'm trying to think of some real obvious
[1:08:32] ones oh yeah
[1:08:34] well this is the worst this is one of
[1:08:35] the worst ones too mystery babylon
[1:08:40] the bible said any man with wisdom with
[1:08:41] the gift of wisdom can see that the
[1:08:43] babylon
[1:08:44] sits on seven hills right
[1:08:48] and now they show in that video uh all
[1:08:50] the apostasy preachers
[1:08:52] they're all trinitarians except td jakes
[1:08:54] he's kinda sometimes he is sometimes
[1:08:56] he's not
[1:08:58] they showed on there brother sister they
[1:09:01] showed all these preachers
[1:09:03] and they're all saying how the pope is
[1:09:04] such a great man and one of them is rick
[1:09:06] warren which i was really disappointed
[1:09:07] because i really liked his book
[1:09:08] and i didn't i didn't realize he said
[1:09:10] that about the pope all like all the
[1:09:12] things he said about the pope
[1:09:13] and i mentioned him on my video so i
[1:09:15] might have to edit that video
[1:09:17] it's one of my it was one of my
[1:09:18] honorable mention favorite books because
[1:09:19] it was a great book
[1:09:21] but that was before he kind of went in
[1:09:23] the ecumenical move
[1:09:26] but anyways it shows all these people
[1:09:28] and then it shows a famous preacher and
[1:09:29] i forget what state he's in i think it's
[1:09:31] georgia
[1:09:32] in other words he's got thousands in his
[1:09:35] attendance he's a well-known preacher
[1:09:36] and church he walks up there they have
[1:09:38] all the bishops walk up there they kiss
[1:09:39] the pope on this side
[1:09:40] they kiss him on that side and this
[1:09:42] protestant preacher who's got millions
[1:09:44] of
[1:09:45] dollars he walks up there and he kisses
[1:09:47] the pope
[1:09:48] he gets out of the way and then his wife
[1:09:50] comes up they're literally
[1:09:52] kissing the antichrist the soon to be
[1:09:55] antichrist
[1:09:56] did you see it recently he's talking
[1:09:57] about dying you see that
[1:09:59] it was in the news yesterday he said i
[1:10:00] don't want to die in argentina i want to
[1:10:02] die in rome because that's his home
[1:10:03] country
[1:10:04] he's thinking about death he's ready to
[1:10:05] die so i wonder if this next one will be
[1:10:08] now brother brahm did say a quote
[1:10:09] a pope will rise out of america there's
[1:10:11] never been one
[1:10:12] but just you know that quote's not thus
[1:10:14] saith the lord so some people jump on
[1:10:15] that brother back and they're like
[1:10:16] it's got to come out of america but
[1:10:18] again it's not thus saith the lord
[1:10:20] so you got to be careful we make thus
[1:10:21] saith the lord
[1:10:24] but think about that because they turned
[1:10:26] down the holy bread
[1:10:29] of there's a false church and run from
[1:10:32] it right come out over my people
[1:10:34] because they turn down that bread that
[1:10:35] meal have come out over my people they
[1:10:36] said i don't want that
[1:10:38] they're making love to the woman right
[1:10:40] the prostitute
[1:10:42] they are making love to a prostitute
[1:10:45] church the bible said
[1:10:46] she prostituted herself with all the
[1:10:48] nations of the world
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:05] jesus said call no man father on this
[1:11:07] earth now we can see how they live a
[1:11:09] sinful life you know both sides
[1:11:11] that wasn't a big surprise but look but
[1:11:14] see it proves
[1:11:15] they've turned down the fresh bread that
[1:11:17] you and i eat every sabbath amen
[1:11:21] praise god amen glory
[1:11:24] we get to eat the fresh bread but
[1:11:26] they're eating the
[1:11:27] contaminated bread of the days of the
[1:11:31] old days right the contaminated but we
[1:11:32] got a feast on the fresh bread of this
[1:11:34] hour
[1:11:36] oh my oh it's a beautiful picture church
[1:11:38] i wish i i wish i had the
[1:11:41] wish i had the time to explain it that's
[1:11:42] why i wrote the book
[1:11:44] oh my thank the lord
[1:11:48] so see it is through these 12 cakes they
[1:11:51] had continual fellowship with god
[1:11:54] it's through our understanding of the 12
[1:11:56] mysteries
[1:11:58] that we have communion with god any
[1:12:01] other views
[1:12:02] are unholy they're spoiled or stale bred
[1:12:06] sometimes i'll eat a piece of bread
[1:12:08] brother bang my children left it over
[1:12:09] there overnight and i'm like i just
[1:12:10] can't waste this bread
[1:12:11] my wife made this bread it was actually
[1:12:14] really good bread
[1:12:15] it's sour dough it's just a little
[1:12:16] crunchy
[1:12:18] but sometimes i'll eat that i think i
[1:12:20] just got to get it down right and put
[1:12:22] some water on there you know
[1:12:24] i just got to get it out i don't want to
[1:12:25] see this bread go to waste i do that
[1:12:26] with their eggs too you know
[1:12:28] but not not the next day just that later
[1:12:30] that night because that's really gross
[1:12:33] now i'm kind of like oh i'm kind of
[1:12:34] old-fashioned like that we grew up poor
[1:12:36] and so
[1:12:37] i gotta you know lick every i gotta get
[1:12:39] every food off my plate and i just can't
[1:12:40] throw food away i just can't do it
[1:12:42] uh but look these churches
[1:12:46] are serving up spoiled bread stale bread
[1:12:50] moldy bread saying god is three persons
[1:12:55] and he's he's got he's not lonely in
[1:12:57] heaven because he's got two other people
[1:12:59] with him
[1:13:00] he can carry a conversation we need to
[1:13:02] have communion like god had with
[1:13:04] himself oh come on that's that's just
[1:13:06] total insanity that's a polytheism right
[1:13:09] that's the bread they're being served
[1:13:10] and they eat it up and can you imagine
[1:13:12] gobbling that up
[1:13:14] i saw uh i saw a picture recently of uh
[1:13:17] what state was that there's a real bad
[1:13:19] state might have been california i don't
[1:13:20] know which one
[1:13:21] but anyways they have these homeless
[1:13:22] guys walking and they're picking through
[1:13:24] the trash sister naomi
[1:13:26] in america they're picking through the
[1:13:28] trash and
[1:13:29] you can see all the junk and everything
[1:13:32] and that's
[1:13:32] exactly what churches are doing today
[1:13:35] i've seen that south america when i was
[1:13:36] down there dude they had homeless guys
[1:13:37] that were crazy
[1:13:38] they were almost naked one of them i
[1:13:40] think was almost naked i didn't get to
[1:13:41] see him
[1:13:42] but they would there be just trash piled
[1:13:44] up for a whole block and they'd be going
[1:13:45] through there picking
[1:13:47] what condition do you have to be in
[1:13:50] to pick through trash to eat it but the
[1:13:53] scripture and jesus said that's what
[1:13:54] they're doing the bible said
[1:13:56] the tables are full of it's a
[1:13:59] really awful mess because they turn down
[1:14:03] the holy bread of god i think we should
[1:14:04] be thankful tonight don't you
[1:14:07] hallelujah i mean they're all about this
[1:14:10] uh they're all about you know covered
[1:14:12] and clearing off and making everything
[1:14:13] clean i'll tell you
[1:14:14] we got the cleanest table there ever was
[1:14:16] amen praise god amen and ain't because
[1:14:18] of hand sanitizer
[1:14:19] it's because of the power of the
[1:14:21] cleansing power of the blood of jesus
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] hallelujah amen not only did it cleanse
[1:14:26] our table
[1:14:27] it made our bread fresh and clean amen
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:31] holy bread praise god and we won't take
[1:14:34] that defiled bread
[1:14:36] i won't let it come across the pull but
[1:14:38] brother back you've stood by me all
[1:14:39] these years buddy
[1:14:40] by god's grace i've not let defile bread
[1:14:42] come across this pulpit
[1:14:43] as far as i know i've tried to clean up
[1:14:45] everything that anything false i said or
[1:14:47] anything i try to apologize if i say
[1:14:49] something wrong
[1:14:51] and any preacher that i had questions
[1:14:53] about i don't ask him back
[1:14:55] so if you know they were here a few
[1:14:56] years ago but out here now there's a
[1:14:58] reason
[1:14:59] i could tell you more about that maybe
[1:15:00] i'll get to that later not tonight
[1:15:03] but see we want a clean table naturally
[1:15:06] right naturally
[1:15:07] but more importantly spiritually we want
[1:15:10] it natural as well
[1:15:13] so see brother uh brother sister we
[1:15:16] don't want to feed stale bread
[1:15:17] moldy bread it's not a coincidence
[1:15:21] there's 12
[1:15:23] mysteries that are labeled as mysteries
[1:15:26] and there's not three
[1:15:27] there's not five there's not seven a
[1:15:30] seven's completion
[1:15:32] well god didn't want to use completion
[1:15:34] god wanted to use kingdom twelve for the
[1:15:36] kingdom
[1:15:37] this is bread for the kingdom right the
[1:15:39] kingdom of priests praise god
[1:15:42] why do you want anybody to do seven
[1:15:43] seven seven church ages
[1:15:46] because there's a type there was 12
[1:15:49] revelations that the church
[1:15:51] needed to restore to finish the mystery
[1:15:53] of god
[1:15:54] right so as we as the kings and priests
[1:15:59] we're to constantly feast on the
[1:16:00] preaching of his holy bread

[1:22:05] hallelujah bye brother we try to give
[1:22:08] out how many church agent books have we
[1:22:09] tried to give out they're like
[1:22:10] people don't like yeah they don't want
[1:22:11] it right
[1:22:13] oh but me i'm like yes yes i was like
[1:22:15] give me that one give me that one
[1:22:17] it used to be a dollar remember that bro
[1:22:18] now it's eight dollars
[1:22:20] used to be a lot easier to get oh yeah
[1:22:22] give me those revelations i'll i'm going
[1:22:24] to eat those up
[1:22:26] because that's what makes us we're
[1:22:28] priests right that teaches us how to
[1:22:29] serve god
[1:22:30] how to intercede and how to become a
[1:22:32] real child of god
[1:22:34] how to be a real priest brother said and
[1:22:36] we are priests a royal
[1:22:38] priesthood a holy nation peculiar people
[1:22:40] giving spiritual sacrifices to god
[1:22:43] but you must come in behind the veil to
[1:22:45] see the unveiled god
[1:22:46] and god is unveiled that's his word made
[1:22:49] manifest
[1:22:51] all right one more bear with me here one
[1:22:54] more then we'll get to the communion do
[1:22:55] you love the lord tonight
[1:22:57] amen i hope it's a blessing praise god i
[1:22:58] hope i hope the bread is fresh to you
[1:23:00] tonight praise god
[1:23:03] oh thank the lord i just no this does so
[1:23:06] much for me
[1:23:08] now this is what i was talking about a
[1:23:09] few wednesdays ago even though brother
[1:23:11] bram never said 12 mysteries this is a
[1:23:13] this is more information of the same
[1:23:15] revelation
[1:23:16] people are going to criticize me no
[1:23:17] doubt they already have when i preach
[1:23:19] this other places like oh brother ram
[1:23:20] never said 12 mysteries
[1:23:22] well it doesn't contradict anything
[1:23:25] it actually lines up with everything
[1:23:27] right
[1:23:28] it actually makes sense you got to have
[1:23:30] 12 pieces of bread
[1:23:31] before you go into prayer because you
[1:23:33] can understand all the mystery you can
[1:23:35] eat all the bread right
[1:23:36] and still not be in the holiest of
[1:23:38] holies amen
[1:23:39] so see it's it's rightly divided and
[1:23:42] it's placing everything in its right
[1:23:43] position church ages
[1:23:45] mysteries prayer holiest of holies amen
[1:23:49] it's all placed together now this last
[1:23:51] quote here
[1:23:52] the unveiling of god 1964
[1:23:56] he said the shekinah glory so the holy
[1:23:58] spirit in the holy place and the holiest
[1:23:59] place rather
[1:24:01] ripens the shoe bread we feast on
[1:24:04] and drive across the country for
[1:24:07] hundreds of miles and god bless the
[1:24:09] blands amen for driving
[1:24:11] how many miles is it here brother
[1:24:14] not sure okay for wendy it was a 170 i
[1:24:19] think one way
[1:24:21] so every week she drove over 350 miles
[1:24:24] or so
[1:24:25] just to come to church and so i like to
[1:24:27] use that quote with her you know not now
[1:24:28] they get to use it you know they
[1:24:30] they use it too brother ram said the
[1:24:32] shekinah the holy spirit
[1:24:34] is ripening the bread that's in the holy
[1:24:36] place
[1:24:37] that we drive across the country for
[1:24:43] in other words he's not about his
[1:24:44] ministry his ministry was
[1:24:47] the former reign glory the preaching the
[1:24:51] mystery the revelation of the mystery so
[1:24:52] they had to drive around the country
[1:24:55] to get it because that was one of the
[1:24:56] few people preaching it
[1:24:58] he said it's the believer's food it's
[1:25:01] only for a believer ah that's right
[1:25:04] that's the truth
[1:25:05] our church proves that every time
[1:25:07] remember the shoe bread was only for the
[1:25:09] believers see shoe bread
[1:25:10] seed he calls it shoe bread seed
[1:25:14] that's interesting what does it do that
[1:25:16] she kind of glory over the shoe bread
[1:25:18] kept it from spoiling
[1:25:22] what's the kind of glory today to break
[1:25:23] beyond the veil to see who god is
[1:25:26] standing before you to see who god is
[1:25:27] standing before us the pillar of fire
[1:25:29] jesus is veiled now in human flesh but
[1:25:32] what does the shekinah what does it do
[1:25:34] the shoe bred seed the word that we're
[1:25:36] to live on this day

[1:29:53] amen there are nourishment
[1:29:56] when you preach on these things
[1:30:00] but after that you get to a prayer life
[1:30:02] and it's that it's that continual prayer
[1:30:04] life that that incense
[1:30:06] that brings you in the presence of god
[1:30:07] you dare not go in there without the
[1:30:09] burning fire right
[1:30:10] without the burning smoke and the
[1:30:12] incense
[1:30:13] that takes you in there and then when
[1:30:16] you're in there you know there's the ark
[1:30:18] there's a cherubim right and that's all
[1:30:22] that's in there
[1:30:22] but inside the ark you have three items
[1:30:25] and what are those represent let me
[1:30:26] just close with this you have the two
[1:30:28] tables of stone
[1:30:30] you have the pot of mana that's some
[1:30:33] different bread there
[1:30:34] and then you have aaron's rod those
[1:30:37] three things

[1:30:42] sorry the stone tables
[1:30:44] speak of the new testament covenant it's
[1:30:46] now written on the fleshly tables
[1:30:49] of your heart so when you get born again
[1:30:52] you don't got to worry so much about
[1:30:54] memorizing this although it is good to
[1:30:55] do right it is good especially for your
[1:30:57] your human spirit but when you're born
[1:31:00] again the holy spirit
[1:31:01] you don't even have to read it you'll
[1:31:02] just be sitting listening to a sermon
[1:31:04] and the holy spirit will write that word
[1:31:06] upon your soul praise god
[1:31:08] in other words your nature amen
[1:31:11] it'll write the the word of god upon
[1:31:13] your nature so even if you forget glory
[1:31:15] you and satan comes around here he'll
[1:31:17] try to deceive you
[1:31:18] that nature already has a witness and it
[1:31:20] speaks out it says something's wrong
[1:31:22] brother
[1:31:22] says like a little buzzer that goes off
[1:31:24] ah that's wrong stay away from that
[1:31:26] that disagrees with the word thank god
[1:31:28] that he hides his word in our hearts
[1:31:30] amen
[1:31:31] amen without it we might be deceived
[1:31:34] but because we got it in our hearts we
[1:31:37] can't be deceived
[1:31:39] hallelujah it'll deceive so close
[1:31:42] but it will not deceive the very left
[1:31:44] why because he's got the tables of stone
[1:31:47] he's got the word and his soul and you
[1:31:49] can't deny the word if it's in you amen
[1:31:52] no it's your nature amen
[1:31:56] said you have a portion of god in you
[1:31:59] so you've got oh you got a witness
[1:32:01] written on your heart god in other words
[1:32:02] god's marked you right that's what the
[1:32:04] seal is mark
