[0:00] the grace of God
[0:09] let's go to Romans
[0:12] 4 22. we'll start there
[0:15] Grace
[0:26] actually let's go up a few verses
[0:28] because we kind of ended on this on
[0:30] Sunday
[0:33] we go up to um
[0:37] I'll start at verse 17 and then we can
[0:39] all read 21 together so I'll read 17
[0:41] down to 20 myself and then we can all
[0:43] read
[0:45] 21.
[0:49] the Bible says add as it is written I
[0:51] have made thee a father of many nations
[0:54] before him whom he believed even God who
[0:57] quickeneth the Dead
[0:59] and called calleth those things which be
[1:02] not as though they were so that's what
[1:05] Abraham did he would call the things
[1:07] that were not as though they were
[1:08] because God told him to
[1:11] right that's where brother Brown teaches
[1:12] us remember on the third poll I showed
[1:13] you yes brother Ram brother bran can you
[1:15] speak us into the condition for the
[1:16] Rapture mother Ram said only if God
[1:18] tells me to
[1:19] he said I never asked to speak any of
[1:21] those things God told me to speak those
[1:23] things right so same thing with Abraham
[1:25] same thing with us whatever God tells us
[1:27] to speak that's what we speak praise God
[1:29] that's what we believe Verse 18 who
[1:31] against hope believed in hope that he
[1:33] might become the father of many nations
[1:35] according to that which was spoken so
[1:37] shall thy seed be
[1:39] and being not weak in faith he
[1:41] considered not his own body now dead
[1:44] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:46] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:49] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:52] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:55] giving glory to God let's read verse 21
[1:58] ready one two three and being fully
[2:01] persuaded that what he had promised he
[2:04] was able also to perform amen let's have
[2:08] one more word of prayer if you haven't
[2:09] eaten on your heart Let's Make a known
[2:10] unto God Heavenly Father we thank you
[2:12] God for the word of God we've read we
[2:14] thank you for these songs God
[2:15] this is who you are you love us and this
[2:18] is what you do you save us Lord God what
[2:19] a great summary of of your person Lord
[2:22] God so we thank you we give you praise
[2:23] we give you honor and Glory it's a joy
[2:25] to be in your house it's wonderful to
[2:27] sing these songs God our faith is rising
[2:29] Lord even as we we pray here tonight
[2:31] Lord God I pray Lord your Holy Spirit
[2:33] would speak through me Lord and hear
[2:35] through each one of us including me Lord
[2:36] God let my faith be increase Lord God
[2:39] and each one of us Lord God to have
[2:41] faith that's stronger as we uh hear the
[2:44] word of God and ultimately when we leave
[2:46] this place our faith will be stronger
[2:48] we'll keep giving you praise just like
[2:49] the Bible said about Abraham we'd be
[2:51] strong in faith giving you the glory so
[2:53] father God anoint me here tonight God
[2:55] just direct me by the Holy Spirit and I
[2:57] pray God that your will would be done
[2:58] tonight in Jesus Christ's name in the
[3:01] Saint said
[3:01] amen God bless you as you're being
[3:03] seated praise God
[3:06] I want to continue on this here I do
[3:08] have some slides here by God's grace I
[3:09] will put those up there
[3:14] I think what I'll do is I'll go back to
[3:16] that chart I think I'll finish on that
[3:17] chart just uh briefly review that again
[3:20] that was such a help to a couple people
[3:23] so I want to review that
[3:25] uh and sorry again it's so blur I didn't
[3:27] I was off on my anniversary trip I
[3:28] didn't have a chance to study much
[3:30] that's okay I was relaxing by God's
[3:32] grace but I like to at one point make
[3:35] this real clear I just want to rehearse
[3:37] this again uh Abraham was called at 75 I
[3:40] don't know why it says 70 there I have
[3:41] to look it up I thought it was 75.
[3:43] maybe we got some Bible homework we got
[3:45] to do tonight by God's grace he's called
[3:48] at 75 that types a justification right
[3:50] you're called by God yeah even though we
[3:52] get saved we make some partial
[3:54] Disobedience decisions right but we're
[3:57] still saved and God and Abraham was
[3:59] righteous right there when God called
[4:01] him
[4:01] okay and then the next thing he does he
[4:03] gets a covenant you know through God and
[4:05] then he uh the famine comes he leaves
[4:07] the perfect will of God he gets in the
[4:09] permissive will of God but God's still
[4:11] with him God still favors him
[4:13] he had more favor than Pharaoh right
[4:15] even though it was Abraham's fault God
[4:17] still favored Abraham even though it was
[4:19] his fault praise God and God was on God
[4:21] was really on Abraham's side amen
[4:23] because he was the chosen man well then
[4:25] he comes back he gets back in the
[4:26] perfect will of God he rescues lot he
[4:29] saves the soul can I say like that he
[4:31] saved the soul
[4:32] many Souls actually naturally and then
[4:34] he meets God himself
[4:36] uh he meets Melchizedek and shortly
[4:39] after that then God visits him we read
[4:40] over the the Covenant on Sunday a
[4:42] beautiful type where he sees the Abraham
[4:45] sees the the awfulness of hell right but
[4:48] then God puts him to sleep and says you
[4:49] have nothing to do with this Covenant
[4:50] I'm making this Covenant I'm going to
[4:52] bring this to pass I'm confirming my
[4:54] Covenant I'm going to stand in the
[4:56] middle of these sacrifices and I'm
[4:58] confirming this Covenant I'm keeping
[4:59] this Covenant how many know that Jesus
[5:01] is going to keep his Covenant with you
[5:02] praise God you can trust and just just
[5:05] like Abraham is Covenant you can trust
[5:07] in the Covenant of Jesus Christ because
[5:09] it's the blood of his Covenant praise
[5:11] God it's a New Covenant in my blood
[5:13] Jesus said Hallelujah and so we see
[5:16] after that then of course uh uh
[5:19] Abraham has to wait a few years he gets
[5:21] a little impatient he lets Sarah talk
[5:23] him into having another wife a concubine
[5:26] and he gets out of the out of the will
[5:27] of God so interesting right after two
[5:30] look at that two spiritual experiences
[5:31] he meets Melchizedek and then he gets a
[5:33] vision from God
[5:35] after two amazing experiences with God
[5:37] then he disobeys God he tries to make
[5:40] God's word come to pass
[5:42] so see we've got to be careful once we
[5:44] have experience we've got to make sure
[5:45] we don't try to make something come to
[5:46] pass we've got to keep waiting on God
[5:48] keep being patient right okay but after
[5:51] that then God visits him and brings the
[5:54] Covenant of circumcision which is a type
[5:56] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[5:58] what I left out of there was lot uh how
[6:00] he separated from lot now wasn't that
[6:01] something I preached on that and we had
[6:03] some guests that needed to hear that
[6:04] wasn't that something I wasn't even
[6:06] playing that that was God Discerning the
[6:07] thoughts and Tents of their hearts I
[6:09] believe that by God's grace
[6:11] see we got a choice we can choose to
[6:13] live with the world and live a
[6:14] semi-christian life right with among
[6:16] sodomites or we can come out and be like
[6:19] Abraham and his seed praise God
[6:21] and we can travel with with uh the few
[6:24] right the rejected few we can travel
[6:26] with them and we can be separated from
[6:28] the things of the world uh and live a
[6:30] high calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm
[6:32] glad to live with Abraham's seed praise
[6:34] God hallelujah that's where I want to
[6:36] live by God's grace
[6:37] so then he gets the seal the Holy Ghost
[6:39] but he even laughs at God he even lasted
[6:41] God like oh God that's a good one uh
[6:44] it's not going to come I don't I don't
[6:45] believe it can come through Sarah that's
[6:46] what he was laughing about
[6:48] but then God convinced him in the next
[6:50] chapter God visits him in a flesh body
[6:52] with two angels and that's a type of
[6:54] brother Ram's ministry right we believe
[6:56] that because he was uh God gave the sign
[6:58] the Messiah sign Discerning the thoughts
[7:01] and intents of the heart the same sign
[7:03] Jesus did in John chapter 1 and John
[7:05] chapter four like when I preached on
[7:06] when the Junction City saints were here
[7:08] brother brand new the thoughts and Tents
[7:10] of people's hearts through the gift of
[7:11] the Holy Spirit
[7:13] all right uh and then what we we ended
[7:16] with on Sunday was that Abraham now
[7:19] believes God Abraham's not laughing at
[7:21] God but Sarah's laughing at God
[7:24] but God still didn't get rid of Sarah
[7:27] God didn't get rid of either of them
[7:28] because both of them are in the same
[7:30] situation both of them were laughing out
[7:32] both of them were laughing at God's
[7:33] promise unless God helped them believe
[7:36] so it doesn't matter if you're male or
[7:38] female right doesn't matter what you are
[7:40] we're all going to laugh at God's
[7:42] promise we're all going to doubt it
[7:43] until God proves it to us praise God
[7:45] right where in other words we're all
[7:47] going to need God's help to believe
[7:48] God's word hallelujah and if you're in
[7:51] the plan of God God is going to bring
[7:52] he's going to bring you to a place where
[7:54] you can believe his promises
[7:56] that's how it was in every generation in
[7:59] other words God got Enoch ready to
[8:00] believe for the Rapture God got Noah
[8:03] ready to believe for the flood right
[8:05] God got uh uh Moses ready to take two
[8:09] million people out of Egypt to defeat
[8:11] the greatest army there was in the world
[8:13] God always has to get us ready to do
[8:15] anything praise God so if we live to see
[8:17] the Rapture God's going to get us ready
[8:19] for the Rapture praise God
[8:21] because we believe it we believe in the
[8:22] same God that did all those other Mighty
[8:24] works the same God is here today
[8:26] Hallelujah amen
[8:29] he'll get us ready praise God and then
[8:32] remember in 18 also we didn't get to
[8:33] that but but uh Abraham was interceding
[8:36] for lot please don't destroy Sodom
[8:38] because Lots down in there
[8:40] now George that's what we've come to
[8:42] many many uh even brother Diggs when he
[8:44] was here he and I were talking in
[8:46] fellowship and as we talked he brought
[8:48] that up he's like our duty is to pray
[8:50] for the foolish version I said that's
[8:52] exactly right that's what I believe
[8:54] see so we got to remember our family
[8:56] members right we've got to keep praying
[8:57] for our families our friends our
[8:58] co-workers right we got to keep praying
[9:01] for them because that's the ministry of
[9:02] Abraham Abraham doesn't want to see
[9:04] anybody lost can I say like this Abraham
[9:06] don't want to see anybody uh uh go
[9:08] through the tribulation period
[9:10] right he knows they're going to
[9:12] but he doesn't want to see anybody
[9:13] suffer the wrath of God
[9:15] so we've got to keep praying we can't
[9:17] give up on prayer we got to be prayer
[9:19] warriors amen hallelujah I'll say this
[9:22] you have at least three chances to be a
[9:24] prayer Warrior every time we have
[9:25] service praise God you can bow your head
[9:27] in prayer you can get on your knees in
[9:28] prayer you can stand and pray however
[9:30] you want to pray just pray praise God
[9:32] Amen because that's our calling that's
[9:35] our ministry that was Abraham's Ministry
[9:36] I'm interceding so people aren't lost
[9:39] I'm interceding so God will spare the
[9:41] righteous and that's what we're supposed
[9:43] to do praise God
[9:44] amen I forgot I want to pray for the
[9:46] government too tonight I forgot to pray
[9:48] for that but I have to pray for that
[9:49] after service
[9:51] and then church you know the story uh
[9:53] God you know two angels went down there
[9:55] to Sodom and they pulled out a lot that
[9:57] was in Genesis 19 and uh
[10:00] and then of course God sends fire and
[10:02] brimstone down and destroys it destroys
[10:05] the sodomites uh and the Bible said in
[10:07] the book of Jude that's God's example
[10:09] what he's going to do at the end time
[10:11] he's going to again destroy the world by
[10:13] fire
[10:14] just like he destroyed Sodom by fire and
[10:16] brimstone right that's how he's going to
[10:18] deal with homosexuality
[10:20] and then chapter 20 was remember Abraham
[10:23] uh lied to abimelech the Philistine King
[10:26] so verse he lied to the Egyptian king
[10:28] now he lies to the Philistine King about
[10:29] his beautiful 99 year old wife
[10:33] well I'm sorry she would have been 89
[10:34] year old wife sorry this beautiful 89
[10:36] year old woman he wanted to take for his
[10:38] wife and brother man tells us you got to
[10:40] read between the lines and you see God
[10:42] was already changing her back to a young
[10:44] woman Hallelujah so she so the next
[10:47] chapter she could bring forth Isaac
[10:49] right in chapter 21
[10:52] right because Isaac's born in chapter
[10:53] 21. but here we still see Abraham lying
[10:57] in Genesis chapter 20. my wife brought
[10:59] out a good point too remember in Genesis
[11:02] uh Genesis 18 Sarah lied to God
[11:06] so what do we see in their strain in
[11:08] their family what do they struggle with
[11:10] honesty
[11:12] right have you ever seen a strain in
[11:14] your family like my family really
[11:15] struggles with so and so
[11:17] like I just had a preacher tell me today
[11:19] saying I just had a preacher tell me
[11:20] today their family struggles with murder
[11:23] and they've had they've had four murders
[11:26] over the last few few years a number of
[11:28] years
[11:29] poor murders and they know that's the
[11:31] strain in their family anger and
[11:32] violence violence and murder
[11:35] and this brother is in the message
[11:38] now he's he's free of it he's a real man
[11:40] of God but there's people in his family
[11:41] that they're not saved so they murder
[11:43] that's a strain thank God that's not in
[11:46] our families
[11:48] but there are strains in our families
[11:50] look at so what was Abraham's problem
[11:52] lion
[11:54] dishonesty
[11:57] honesty if we're all honest with
[11:59] to be honest
[12:01] we've all got to strain in our family
[12:04] brother Brown was critic I mean critical
[12:05] spirit right he always battle a critical
[12:07] spirit that's what he told us
[12:10] and then he also told us he was a people
[12:13] pleaser he told us that numerous times
[12:14] he didn't want to hurt people's feelings
[12:16] many times he'd preach hard but
[12:18] sometimes he wouldn't
[12:20] he said he didn't like to hurt people's
[12:21] feelings I got this quotes
[12:23] I mean so sometimes he's a little too
[12:25] soft right didn't tell the truth
[12:28] maybe you didn't didn't I shouldn't say
[12:30] that uh didn't uh uh didn't uh maybe
[12:33] correct people when he could have
[12:34] corrected them I made a better way to
[12:36] say that
[12:38] right and of course we know he lied to
[12:39] the IRS so that's maybe something in his
[12:41] family there
[12:42] but I'm just trying to bring out the
[12:43] point I thought that was a good point my
[12:44] wife brought out now look Abraham had
[12:46] lied and then his wife lies and then if
[12:48] you keep reading Abraham lies again if
[12:50] you keep reading Isaac lies about
[12:52] Rebecca being his wife
[12:55] so see how there's strains in our
[12:56] families
[12:57] now who's the who how many here are
[12:59] going to overcome the strains in your
[13:00] family
[13:01] you will because you're Abraham's seed
[13:03] hey amen hallelujah
[13:06] maybe like my family was uh cigarette
[13:10] addiction and an alcoholism
[13:13] and other things you know
[13:16] kind of runs in my my mom's side
[13:20] you know just addictions like that
[13:22] how about uh we talk about anger how
[13:24] about lust running in families
[13:27] how about greed people that their
[13:29] families are all about money
[13:32] see where none of us are exempt from
[13:34] those family strains but all of us have
[13:36] power to overcome hey man that's why
[13:39] you're here tonight praise God Amen
[13:40] because you know there's power in the
[13:42] word of God hallelujah there's power to
[13:45] forgive like our sister testified about
[13:46] amen there's peace that passes all
[13:48] understanding amen Lord remember these
[13:51] are all after he's in tight got the
[13:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of
[13:55] God
[13:57] see how you can lie even after you're
[13:59] born again
[14:01] that means you could lust that means you
[14:02] could have greed you could uh be
[14:05] critical
[14:06] you could have complexes even after
[14:08] having the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:11] so but getting the baptism the Holy
[14:13] Ghost doesn't solve all your problems it
[14:14] just gives you more power to overcome
[14:16] the problems amen hallelujah
[14:19] you said you'll be a witness you have
[14:21] power to be a witness unto me in
[14:23] Jerusalem and Judea and to the uttermost
[14:25] parts of the world praise God Amen
[14:29] now church that proves you know we had a
[14:31] church member years ago who left here
[14:33] and moved over to the Middle East and we
[14:36] thought I thought the person had the
[14:38] baptism the Holy Ghost but when the
[14:39] person got there eventually we found out
[14:41] they didn't because they didn't have
[14:43] power to be a witness they gave into sin
[14:45] and now they don't even believe the
[14:46] message anymore
[14:48] but see that's why the Holy Ghost is
[14:49] given so you have power to be a witness
[14:52] wherever you go praise God
[14:55] no matter where you go no matter what
[14:56] situation you're think about that Paul
[14:58] was in a prison but he still had power
[15:00] to be a witness Hallelujah amen
[15:03] that's what the Holy Ghost is for so
[15:05] you're a witness no matter what
[15:07] situation you're in your family you're a
[15:10] witness and you stand for Jesus Christ
[15:12] you don't give in to the world you don't
[15:14] give into a religious spirit you stand
[15:16] for Jesus Christ
[15:18] amen praise God
[15:21] okay kind of came to me there now so
[15:23] that was uh chapter 21
[15:25] 20 he lies the bimlich but he gets Sarah
[15:27] back again twice
[15:29] same mistake twice
[15:32] uh and then in chapter 21 Isaac's born
[15:34] Ishmael gets cast out
[15:37] and then the chapter 22 Abraham has this
[15:40] is called to sacrifice Isaac the very
[15:43] thing he loved the most he was called to
[15:45] give up in order to obey God but of
[15:48] course God doesn't believe in human
[15:49] sacrifice other than his son
[15:52] right this was a type of that
[15:54] right the type of that
[15:57] okay and then we see in chapter 20
[16:01] uh or the death of Sarah in 23 and then
[16:04] Abraham gets another wife in 24 and then
[16:08] I'm certainly gets a wife for Isaac
[16:10] and then he gets another wife Katura in
[16:12] 25 then he passes away at the end of 25
[16:14] there
[16:16] so just just uh interesting thought
[16:18] there again after he gets the baptism
[16:20] Holy Ghost he has some really severe
[16:22] battles he's got a he can be a prayer
[16:24] Warrior after he's got the seal
[16:25] circumcision amen he intercedes for
[16:28] other people praise God he can really
[16:30] pray Hallelujah yeah you can really pray
[16:32] for the foolish virgin can I say like
[16:33] that
[16:34] because he's got the seal now got sealed
[16:37] Hallelujah uh he can he can have a body
[16:41] change now amen glory the Rapture amen
[16:44] he can have faith he can have faith to
[16:47] sacrifice anything to put God first
[16:51] now Church many times just like in that
[16:52] story it's going to be family members
[16:54] and relationships that we got to
[16:56] sacrifice in order in order to put God
[16:58] first
[16:59] and I don't mean many now sometimes you
[17:01] may have to give up a relationship
[17:02] completely if the person's pulling you
[17:04] down I'm not talking about marriage
[17:05] we're married till death
[17:07] I'm talking about friendships
[17:09] you may have to give up friendships or
[17:10] certain things
[17:11] in order to put God first like always
[17:14] remember this one preacher told me he
[17:16] said he had he was preaching and he had
[17:19] a friend and the friend was a preacher
[17:20] too but this friend would always call
[17:22] him and take up all of his time
[17:24] and it was like a competition the other
[17:26] preacher was trying to get thoughts from
[17:28] him and and have more thoughts and
[17:30] Revelations uh and it really just messed
[17:32] up their friendship but once once they
[17:34] moved apart and once they separated they
[17:35] both got married then they didn't have
[17:37] that competitive spear anymore
[17:39] imagine that preacher is competing who's
[17:41] got the better sermons who's got the
[17:43] better Revelations
[17:45] let's not have that praise God right
[17:49] right but but that can happen people can
[17:51] compete over anything well who had the
[17:52] better song special
[17:54] right or who's the better preacher who's
[17:56] the better
[17:57] who cooks the better food for the
[17:58] carrians
[18:00] who's more generous who dresses more
[18:03] holy who's got fancier clothes anything
[18:06] it's a competitive spirit and see so God
[18:09] that's a good example of you got to
[18:10] choose God
[18:12] you got to see if this is hurting me
[18:14] something's got to be done I either got
[18:15] to approach them I got to talk to them I
[18:16] got to repent to them whatever you got
[18:18] to do but you got to put God you got to
[18:19] obey God first praise God
[18:22] amen
[18:25] and so we see again
[18:27] Abraham here
[18:30] he was a type for you and I praise God a
[18:33] type for you and I I think I'll stop
[18:34] right there by God's grace
[18:36] now I want to go back here let's pick up
[18:37] your Bibles we've got your Bibles here
[18:39] so we are still in this uh second
[18:41] section it's really the third but we
[18:43] went through the introduction we saw how
[18:44] the whole world I just don't fix that
[18:46] was guilty before God the whole hole the
[18:49] hole of the whole was guilty before God
[18:50] now we're in the par of what's the
[18:53] solution to this problem everybody's
[18:54] guilty the solution is justification by
[18:57] faith is a solution
[18:59] and who's who's the example we're going
[19:01] to use how do we get saved brother
[19:02] Austin Abraham's our example hallelujah
[19:05] sister who's our example Abraham
[19:10] we're all Sinners we all deserve hell
[19:12] we've all fallen short of the glory of
[19:13] God if you're a moralist that doesn't
[19:15] save you if you're Heathen a savior if
[19:18] you're a Jew it doesn't save you what
[19:19] saves you faith in the word of God
[19:21] believing God's word alone is what saves
[19:24] you praise God
[19:25] that's the solution believe God don't
[19:28] trust in your ability to get saved trust
[19:30] in Jesus's ability to save you amen
[19:34] hallelujah praise God
[19:37] now eventually we'll get to this here uh
[19:38] this the second this third part rather
[19:40] we'll get to the believer's walk in the
[19:42] Holy Spirit
[19:44] which I've been preaching that over the
[19:45] years you know with Romans 8 these last
[19:46] few years just the promises of God but
[19:49] uh we'll see kind of how the Lord brings
[19:51] us through there
[19:53] now I want to read this I didn't get to
[19:54] read this on Sunday I felt like I should
[19:56] stop I think I preached an hour and a
[19:57] half on Sunday so I
[19:59] stopped there and I felt I felt a good
[20:01] time to pray I felt like the faith was
[20:02] at its highest right there and so we
[20:04] prayed for our brother Austin that was a
[20:06] real good testimony brother random said
[20:07] the Bible said Abraham stagger not at
[20:09] the promise of God through unbelief but
[20:11] was strong giving praise to God his name
[20:13] was changed from Abram to Abraham the
[20:16] changing in the name made his name
[20:17] father of Nations can you imagine a man
[20:20] living with his wife his sweetheart
[20:21] that'll live with her now for all these
[20:24] years
[20:25] Abraham was 99.
[20:28] right and she was 89. and they still had
[20:31] no children
[20:32] right and yet the God said you're the
[20:35] father of many nations
[20:37] I've got no kids
[20:39] right that's what that's what he says
[20:42] he says and his wife 70 years old and
[20:45] yet without one child or any hope of a
[20:46] child yet claim that he was the father
[20:48] of a Nation can you imagine the
[20:49] criticism of his passing fellow man
[20:51] would say father of Nations now how many
[20:54] children do you have at this time and
[20:55] all the criticism he had to go through
[20:57] with
[20:59] see church when God asks us to believe
[21:01] his word he's also going to allow us to
[21:04] be tested to see if we really believe it
[21:06] praise God
[21:09] in other words you're going to face some
[21:11] criticism why do you dress like that why
[21:14] don't you watch that anymore why what
[21:15] happened why you used to act like this
[21:17] you used to say this you said listen to
[21:18] that why don't you listen to that
[21:19] anymore you're going to get criticized
[21:22] oh you're holy I just heard you make a
[21:24] mistake or you just treated me mean last
[21:25] week you're gonna get criticized you've
[21:28] got to expect that
[21:30] and you've got to be able to rebound
[21:31] from your mistakes and get back to
[21:33] trusting in the promises of God
[21:35] hallelujah
[21:37] Abraham could have dwelt on the fact
[21:39] well I haven't I don't have the promise
[21:40] I don't know the promise I must be a
[21:41] failure God must not love me God God's
[21:44] word must not be true but he had to
[21:46] focus on God's promises true praise God
[21:50] he had to choose because he's getting
[21:51] made farther brother said they laugh and
[21:53] say oh father of Nations father Nations
[21:56] where's all your seed Abraham
[21:58] they'd make fun of him oh God told you
[22:01] that why hasn't happened yet it's been
[22:02] 24 years
[22:05] they would just make fun of him
[22:07] but he had to go through the criticism
[22:09] in order to be an overcomer praise God
[22:13] we've got to go through criticism in
[22:15] order to overcome today as well praise
[22:17] God Amen
[22:19] but Abraham didn't stagger anywhere at
[22:21] all of unbelief he believed that God was
[22:24] able to perform that which he had
[22:25] promised that God would prove his word
[22:27] no matter how long it took how many
[22:29] believe that
[22:30] see that's what we got to be so
[22:31] convinced I don't care how long it takes
[22:33] God is going to perform his word in my
[22:36] life
[22:37] ah
[22:39] I'm willing to wait as long as I have to
[22:41] wait because I know God proves his word
[22:44] amen
[22:45] but instead of getting weaker each time
[22:47] like we are prone to do he got stronger
[22:50] all the time
[22:51] now church we saw sometimes he got weak
[22:53] right sometimes he laughed and then
[22:55] other times he gets stronger But as time
[22:57] went on overall he got stronger so
[23:00] that's what we need God's grace Lord
[23:01] make me stronger today
[23:03] don't let me leave this service weaker
[23:05] let me leave this service stronger in
[23:07] the promise of God
[23:09] amen like brother man said let me doubt
[23:12] my doubts
[23:13] amen
[23:15] but man said if you if you don't have it
[23:17] uh if you don't care enough about the
[23:19] word of God brother man I said Lord
[23:21] created me a care so I care more about
[23:23] the word of God
[23:25] I want to doubt my doubts and created me
[23:27] whatever I need of creating me the faith
[23:30] created me the strength as we said on
[23:32] Sunday the Bible said in Hebrews 11
[23:34] Sarah received strength in other words
[23:36] Lord send your strength today and I'll
[23:38] receive it praise God
[23:40] ah Hallelujah amen
[23:44] Abraham said if it didn't happen today
[23:45] tomorrow it'll be a greater Miracle
[23:47] because it's one day older
[23:50] how many people saying that today praise
[23:53] God if God doesn't do my miracle today
[23:55] it's going to be even greater tomorrow
[23:57] it's gonna be a greater testimony
[24:01] praise God if it doesn't happen this
[24:03] year when it happens next year it's
[24:05] going to be even greater praise God yeah
[24:07] more people to tell the testimony to
[24:10] because it went on longer it went on
[24:12] more years and that will encourage them
[24:14] to keep believing over the years
[24:16] oh Hallelujah
[24:19] thank God
[24:22] like I can tell that testimony because I
[24:23] was connected to the 17 Amish people
[24:25] getting baptized now I can share that
[24:27] testimony the man waited 18 years to see
[24:30] a church receive the message
[24:32] and I was part of that I played a part
[24:34] in that
[24:35] and I I just was part of that Vision I
[24:38] was part of that prayer and so now I can
[24:40] share I can share this keep praying if
[24:42] you want your family saved keep praying
[24:44] praise God
[24:45] at least for 18 years amen right and we
[24:49] would say at least probably 25 years
[24:50] because Abraham waited 25 years for
[24:52] Isaac amen
[24:55] Glory
[24:56] amen
[24:59] Hallelujah
[25:01] it's gonna be a greater testimony
[25:02] tomorrow if it happens tomorrow
[25:04] that was God and that was God in Abraham
[25:07] so see church when you are speaking
[25:08] God's word that's God speaking in you
[25:12] how many will let God borrow your vocal
[25:14] cords
[25:16] Hallelujah so you'll be the one that's
[25:18] speaking God's word hallelujah
[25:20] amen for he know that God proved all of
[25:24] his words to be so
[25:26] Oh Glory if his children will only take
[25:28] his word so he can prove it by you
[25:30] that's the only way he can prove his
[25:32] word is if you believe it
[25:34] he doesn't prove it to unbelievers they
[25:36] can't be proved they're unbelievers but
[25:38] it's not to unbelievers it's not for
[25:40] unbelievers it's to him that believes
[25:43] and if you can find somebody who will
[25:45] believe his word he will prove his word
[25:46] by you and sometimes sickness and things
[25:49] happen to us that way that God can prove
[25:52] himself
[25:54] so our sicknesses or our our troubles in
[25:56] general are just so that God can prove
[25:59] his word to us praise God the reason we
[26:02] have troubles is so God can prove I can
[26:04] deliver you from trouble praise God
[26:07] oh thank God may God help us to see our
[26:10] trials like that praise God
[26:13] God lets us go through difficult times
[26:15] to prove that he can bring us through
[26:17] difficult times
[26:18] Hallelujah Amen in other words God let
[26:21] me get coveted a couple years three
[26:23] years ago so I could overcome covet
[26:26] and now I got a testimony right just
[26:27] like anyone who else who had covered and
[26:30] you overcame it right it killed millions
[26:32] of people
[26:33] but if you overcome it's God allowed it
[26:36] so you would have a testimony praise God
[26:38] amen
[26:40] he said you remember what the blind man
[26:41] that Jesus found they said who sin he
[26:44] his father or his mother he said in this
[26:46] case neither but that the works of God
[26:48] might be made known see it happened to
[26:50] that voice that Jesus could be glorified
[26:52] oh
[26:53] sometimes sickness is not a curse it's a
[26:56] blessing oh I'm gonna read that one
[26:58] again because I didn't hear any amends
[26:59] on that one maybe I didn't slow down
[27:00] long enough let me slow down this time
[27:03] he says sometimes sickness is not a
[27:05] curse it's a blessing
[27:09] that's hard to amen isn't it sometimes
[27:11] it's hard for me to amen even amen
[27:14] sometimes sickness is a blessing in
[27:17] other words I'm saying this blindness
[27:20] was a blessing because Jesus healed him
[27:22] and it brought Jesus Glory
[27:25] Hallelujah
[27:27] so see sometimes sickness or trouble is
[27:30] not God's curse in me you see God's
[27:32] curse I mean God and the whole time
[27:33] God's like I'm trying to use you for my
[27:35] glory
[27:36] you're like God why am I so cursed why
[27:39] am I so cursed God's like you're blessed
[27:40] I'm just I'm just trying to get glory in
[27:42] your life
[27:43] I'm trying to bless you you're like
[27:45] why'd you curse me God's like I'm trying
[27:47] to bless you
[27:48] speak my word
[27:50] right church right we can't be cursed
[27:53] we're already blessed amen
[27:55] the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven
[27:58] us it saved us it's already set us in
[28:00] the Heavenly place of church you and I
[28:03] are already accepted in heaven the Bible
[28:05] says we are accepted already in the
[28:07] Beloved amen
[28:09] in other words when you when you pray
[28:11] and you go to heaven and you're I'm
[28:13] sorry your faith goes up to heaven you
[28:14] and you interact with God in the
[28:16] conversation he's already accepted you
[28:18] he's already said come on in come on in
[28:21] and talk to me I'd like to talk to you
[28:22] we'll get to that in chapter five
[28:24] the Bible says we are already welcome to
[28:25] come in
[28:27] we already have access to Heaven praise
[28:30] God
[28:31] so trials are not your curse trials are
[28:33] you're blessed believe my word
[28:36] oh my God
[28:38] thank God
[28:39] why so that we can stick our faith out
[28:41] there
[28:42] and call those things like Austin's been
[28:44] doing call those things which are not as
[28:47] though they were
[28:48] also been sending me some encouraging
[28:50] texts this week right brother
[28:52] God said so and it'll prove it so if
[28:54] you're just not weakened under the test
[28:56] now Church don't get discouraged if we
[28:58] weaken another test because Abraham
[29:00] weaken under the test Sarah weakened
[29:02] under the test but what happened they
[29:03] never quit on God
[29:05] they never quit on God in other words
[29:07] they just kept giving God glory amen
[29:10] they just kept repenting and getting
[29:12] right with God Amen they just kept
[29:14] waiting on God they kept serving God
[29:15] look they never sold out God said we'll
[29:18] move down to Sodom with them sodomites
[29:19] we might as well
[29:20] I haven't got my promise yet I'm gonna
[29:22] move back down to the side I'll just
[29:24] might as well go with lot I haven't
[29:25] gotten my promise yet that's not what
[29:27] Abraham and Sarah did
[29:28] they just stay true to God
[29:31] they just stay faithful to God and
[29:33] Abraham just sat under that oak tree and
[29:35] he was just waiting for God he was
[29:37] looking for God and then God come and
[29:38] then he runs out to him remember that
[29:40] amen
[29:41] but you're here you're sitting here
[29:43] under the oak tree right of God's
[29:45] presence and just waiting for God to
[29:47] come and church when God comes let's run
[29:49] out to meet him praise God
[29:51] in other words when we feel God's spirit
[29:52] when we feel the word of God is speaking
[29:54] to us let's agree with it let's confess
[29:57] it and let's speak God's word let's give
[29:59] God praise for his word amen
[30:01] amen
[30:05] now look he puts and I put some other
[30:07] examples God proved his word through
[30:09] Abraham and Sarah now he could prove to
[30:11] job one time that he wouldn't curse him
[30:13] to his face he proved
[30:15] job will never curse me to my face
[30:18] look at the trial that Joe went through
[30:20] but down the very jaws of death yet he
[30:22] said the lord gave and the Lord take it
[30:23] away blessed be the name of the Lord
[30:26] he certainly believed it God proved his
[30:28] word to job he proves to Abraham he
[30:31] proved it so
[30:33] how many understand that God's trying to
[30:35] prove his word to you
[30:37] but you we got to believe it praise God
[30:41] no let's get back in our Bibles here uh
[30:44] Romans that was kind of like the warm-up
[30:45] there I never I didn't I didn't get that
[30:47] on Sunday that's the warm up there
[30:49] by God's grace
[30:50] verse 20 22.
[30:54] yeah I actually left off 22. and
[30:55] therefore was reputed unto him for
[30:57] righteousness in other words so Abraham
[30:59] was fully persuaded what God promised he
[31:01] performed and therefore God imputed
[31:03] righteousness to him
[31:05] so in other words God God will see us as
[31:08] righteous when we fully believe his
[31:10] promise
[31:11] and I'm just talking about being saved
[31:13] I'm just talking about salvation right
[31:19] well if you raise your hand and you've
[31:20] got the helmet of salvation on praise
[31:22] God thank you for putting on your armor
[31:23] today praise God you ought to because
[31:25] you're in a big fight
[31:27] if you don't put it on you're gonna get
[31:28] hit up by the head and start wondering
[31:30] whether I'm saved or not praise God
[31:32] let's have our armor on praise God let's
[31:34] believe that we're saved Hallelujah
[31:37] verse 23 now it was not written for his
[31:40] sake alone thou it is imputed to him
[31:43] in other words all these scriptures
[31:44] weren't written just for Abraham they're
[31:46] written for us
[31:47] but for us also to whom I shall be
[31:50] imputed if we believe on him that raised
[31:53] up Jesus our lord from the dead how many
[31:56] believe Jesus alive today
[31:58] he's not dead He's Alive I believe that
[32:01] he's actually here tonight praise God
[32:02] Amen he just healed Austin on Sunday
[32:05] he's here praise God amen
[32:09] who was delivered for our offenses so
[32:12] Jesus was delivered and crucified
[32:13] because of what we did
[32:15] and was raised again again for our
[32:19] justification
[32:20] so he was crucified for us and he was
[32:22] raised for us my the whole thing was for
[32:24] us praise God
[32:26] right God wrote about Abraham for our
[32:28] sake that we might believe in our
[32:30] justification and all the other Divine
[32:32] Promises of God
[32:34] now George I always want to bring this
[32:35] to your remembrance
[32:37] you have all Divine blessings and you
[32:40] have all Divine promises
[32:43] that's what the Bible says
[32:46] we've been blessed with how many all
[32:49] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[32:51] praise God
[32:53] so whatever we have need of tonight we
[32:55] have access to it if we believe it
[32:59] right we're talking about overcoming
[33:00] greed and overcoming lies like Abraham
[33:02] had to overcome his lies or overcoming
[33:04] lust or overcoming anger or violence or
[33:07] murder
[33:08] whatever we got to overcome we have
[33:10] access to the power to overcome it
[33:13] praise God because we've got all
[33:15] spiritual blessings amen like that song
[33:17] we sang a while ago bless me Lord oh
[33:20] bless me Lord bless me Lord oh bless me
[33:24] Lord that's what we're talking about
[33:26] Lord bless me with all your blessings
[33:28] praise God
[33:29] Hallelujah
[33:32] and church whatever the blessings we
[33:33] have need of we can go to God and say
[33:36] your word says I'm given all spiritual
[33:39] blessings
[33:40] now notice that wasn't all natural
[33:41] blessings
[33:43] right it wasn't all natural it was all
[33:45] spiritual blessings
[33:48] right
[33:49] I know inflation is really tough right
[33:51] now but but God didn't always always
[33:53] promise to give us so much natural
[33:55] blessings
[33:57] right although we we trust God for all
[33:59] the blessings and all of our provision
[34:01] but he says all spiritual blessings and
[34:05] then Peter remember says
[34:07] his divine power has given us all things
[34:09] that pertain unto life and godliness
[34:13] through the knowledge of him that called
[34:14] us to glory and virtue
[34:17] so whatever you need to live this life
[34:19] the spiritual life and to be like God
[34:22] it's already given to us
[34:24] but how do we possess it whereby our
[34:26] given on us exceeding great and precious
[34:28] promises that by these promises you
[34:32] might be partakers of the divine nature
[34:35] right having escaped the corruption
[34:37] that's in the world through lust
[34:40] so how do you inherit all the spiritual
[34:42] blessings and life and godliness through
[34:45] a promise
[34:47] so church when we need something we've
[34:49] got to find like even like with
[34:50] cisronia's testimony
[34:52] she needed healing or she needed relief
[34:54] from that right and so she knows it's in
[34:56] the Bible I'm sure she at some point
[34:58] thought of this that that blessing is
[35:00] somewhere in the Bible and all she had
[35:02] to do is just find that promise and
[35:04] believe that promise now that applies to
[35:06] each and every one of us praise God
[35:07] whatever spiritual blessing we need we
[35:10] just got to find the Bible say Lord you
[35:12] promised
[35:13] Hallelujah and I'm going to be like
[35:15] Abraham I'll be like Sarah I'm going to
[35:17] give you praise until I receive the
[35:20] promise hallelujah
[35:21] thank God Amen
[35:24] thank you Jesus
[35:27] like I'll just say like this like if uh
[35:30] if someone was scared to dance like we
[35:31] did on Sunday or someone's scared to
[35:33] worship or stand up and praise God
[35:35] Dave just got to quote the promise where
[35:37] the Bible says uh where the spirit of
[35:39] the Lord is there's liberty that's a
[35:41] promise
[35:43] so if they're afraid they just got to
[35:45] say Lord when your spirit's there help
[35:47] me to have the liberty of the spirit you
[35:49] promised it
[35:51] and then you can use that promise where
[35:53] the Bible says the sons of God are led
[35:55] by the spirit of God in other words I'm
[35:57] a Child of God say Lord I'm a Child of
[35:58] God lead me to dance
[36:01] or lead me to shout or leave me to
[36:03] prophesy or whatever you're calling me
[36:05] to lead me to speak in tongues just
[36:07] leave me because I want the freedom I
[36:09] want the liberty of the Holy Spirit
[36:11] praise God
[36:12] Amen thank God Hallelujah
[36:15] praise God
[36:17] that's wonderful
[36:20] so see Church whatever promise we have
[36:22] need of
[36:23] we got to find that in the Bible and
[36:26] quote it like Abraham and Sarah and keep
[36:29] glorifying God until you get it
[36:32] Hallelujah that's why as we've learned
[36:35] with some of the saints that come and go
[36:36] that's why we've learned when we're
[36:38] tired and when we're tired and sick and
[36:40] discouraged that's not the time to miss
[36:42] church that's the time to come to church
[36:46] that's because that because at some
[36:48] point during the service the Holy Spirit
[36:50] Will prompt you to give me praise
[36:52] he'll say give me praise worship your
[36:55] hands
[36:56] now you can be like Abraham and Sarah
[36:58] and now you can be strong in faith
[37:00] giving God glory call those things that
[37:03] are not as though they are and let God's
[37:06] spirit flow through you keep praising
[37:08] God until you receive the promise of God
[37:11] oh my that's wonderful how many times
[37:14] have I seen at church
[37:15] especially during the school year I work
[37:17] all day I get up at 5 a.m many times I
[37:20] got headaches because I don't sleep
[37:21] enough maybe during the school year
[37:22] today I don't have a headache thank God
[37:25] but there's many times church I feel
[37:27] like calling off church I should say
[37:29] many times there's a few times
[37:31] I feel sick I've got a headache I've got
[37:33] a sore throat I don't feel like coming
[37:35] to church sometimes
[37:37] and I'll get a little Whisper of the
[37:38] Satan he'll say you can cancel church
[37:40] you're the pastor
[37:43] thank God I've never gave into that
[37:45] and when I think I had to do it one time
[37:47] I think yeah at one time I think I had
[37:48] to do that I told bang or to play a tape
[37:51] or something like that years and years
[37:52] ago
[37:53] but I have the choice every service I
[37:55] could cancel church
[37:57] or I could come to church and be strong
[37:59] in faith and give God glory well you
[38:02] know what I choose most the time
[38:07] I never forget that one time I had to I
[38:09] was preaching on dancing and I had a
[38:11] headache the whole service and then I
[38:13] started dancing and praising God by the
[38:14] end of it the headache was gone amen
[38:18] show me keep
[38:19] giving us God won't heal every time
[38:21] right sometimes I preach right through
[38:22] sickness I'm still sick at the end
[38:24] but God gives us such encouragement just
[38:27] believe his word just keep confessing
[38:29] his promise let's be like Abraham and
[38:31] Sarah let's keep believing God until it
[38:33] happens praise God ah let's show that we
[38:36] got faith for every spiritual blessing
[38:38] we got faith for God's Divine Promises
[38:40] of life and godliness through believing
[38:43] God's word just believe God's word
[38:45] hallelujah hahaha and I just thought I'd
[38:48] read this I love this quote I heard this
[38:50] I read this the other day I thought well
[38:51] I think the Saints will just like this
[38:52] quote it's a really nice quote
[38:54] works is Faith Express notice the Holy
[38:57] Faith of of God was United with the Holy
[39:00] works of his prophet
[39:04] remember God's Holy Faith was revealed
[39:07] to Abraham what was God's Holy Faith
[39:08] you're going to have a son through Sarah
[39:11] so that was a Holy Faith or a holy
[39:13] promise of God right
[39:15] he received it and by there he started
[39:18] with his holy works by believing
[39:21] the seed of Promise had a place to grow
[39:25] so you've got to we gotta we got to
[39:26] recognize any promise we want from God
[39:28] is like a seed and we got to plant that
[39:31] in our hearts and the way you water is
[39:32] by saying thank you Lord
[39:35] thank you Lord this is going to come to
[39:36] pass I received that
[39:38] Hallelujah
[39:40] so so so so uh so we could take a
[39:42] promise day and say Lord
[39:45] uh you said go into all the world and
[39:46] preach the gospel he that believeth is
[39:49] baptized shall be saved so we can say
[39:50] Lord I'm taking that promise I went to
[39:52] you sent me to Akron I'm here preaching
[39:54] I'm going to see so saved
[39:56] that's a promise of God
[39:58] and church as we've gone on in time a
[40:00] few Souls have got saved praise God it's
[40:02] more souls that God saved is than if we
[40:05] would have quit
[40:06] and said well I believe God for five
[40:09] years and I haven't seen a soul save
[40:10] that's not the time to quit that's the
[40:12] time to say the Miracles right around
[40:14] the corner praise God it's going to
[40:16] happen any time now let's believe God's
[40:19] word let's be strong in faith giving God
[40:21] glory praise God
[40:23] foreign
[40:32] you or something never give up keep
[40:34] believing God God wants to prove his
[40:36] word is true Hallelujah
[40:38] you're not cursed you're blessed
[40:41] hallelujah oh my thank God
[40:44] Hallelujah
[40:46] let's give God's word a place to grow
[40:49] right in here Jesus let your seed grow
[40:52] right in here
[40:54] for all of us it's Lord It's The Rapture
[40:56] or it's the baptism of holy ghost or its
[40:59] loved ones being saved let that promise
[41:01] grow up in your heart
[41:03] say thank you Lord I'm blessed
[41:05] this is This Promise This seed is going
[41:07] to receive water it's going to fall on
[41:08] good ground it's going to fall on an
[41:10] honest heart I'm going to keep praising
[41:11] you I'm going to keep worshiping you
[41:13] until I see the the seed bring forth of
[41:15] its own kind
[41:17] amen praise God hallelujah
[41:20] thank you Jesus
[41:22] so notice this notice what program says
[41:24] Grace sent the promise
[41:27] Abraham only had to believe and overcome
[41:30] his sins his life
[41:32] he had overcome his lust maybe with
[41:33] Hagar he had to overcome his lying to
[41:35] the two kings
[41:37] he had to overcome his own unbelief when
[41:39] he laughed at God and God's even talking
[41:42] to him
[41:44] he just had to keep believing God he
[41:47] just had to keep moving on with God
[41:50] so you you and I ought to feel very
[41:51] encouraged that we're here tonight we're
[41:53] just like Abraham despite our failures
[41:55] maybe Monday through Wednesday or maybe
[41:57] Thursday through Saturday
[41:59] right despite our failures we still come
[42:02] to church and you still give God praise
[42:05] ah
[42:07] God Amen
[42:09] God made sure or he helped Abraham
[42:12] believe the promises
[42:14] God's going to make sure that you
[42:16] believe the promise
[42:18] that's exactly right
[42:21] now Church Jesus I just want to make
[42:23] this very very simple you say you might
[42:25] say brother Jester you might say sister
[42:27] so-and-so how do I do this how do I how
[42:29] do I make this happen there's one word
[42:31] to answer for you believe
[42:34] well just how do I heal the sicker how
[42:36] do I cast out devils
[42:38] which I don't see it as much as I used
[42:39] to you know thank God there's less
[42:41] people filled with the Devils around
[42:42] around me by God's grace I'm thankful
[42:44] for that
[42:45] but how do I do Miracles or how do I
[42:47] live a Godly life believe
[42:50] ah they asked Jesus what shall we do
[42:53] Jesus that we might work the works of
[42:55] God I'm a Believer I would do God's
[42:57] Works how do I do it Jesus he answered
[42:59] and said to them this is the work of God
[43:01] that you believe on whom he has set
[43:04] praise God
[43:06] I want to do something for God today I
[43:07] don't even want to do work God's works
[43:09] just believe Jesus Hallelujah
[43:12] don't believe the world don't believe
[43:13] social media right don't believe the
[43:16] media I don't believe family members if
[43:18] they disagree with Jesus just believe
[43:20] Jesus Hallelujah
[43:22] amen isn't that beautiful
[43:26] and that what is that this is Faith
[43:27] right
[43:28] belief is the same as Faith just have
[43:30] faith
[43:32] just believe God's promise and you can
[43:35] do the works of God
[43:37] I'm the one to hear that I think that
[43:38] served God the longest since 1999 I
[43:40] think so so I can tell you after 25
[43:43] years 24 years of serving Jesus it
[43:45] really boils down to one thing just
[43:47] believe Jesus
[43:49] Hallelujah
[43:52] no matter where the trials I've been
[43:54] through no matter the tests I've been
[43:55] through I've found there's one thing I
[43:57] can do to overcome that's believe
[44:00] just believe God's word how many are
[44:02] believers tonight by God's grace oh I
[44:03] know you are amen now this reminded me
[44:06] of the five sermons that brother random
[44:08] preached called convinced then concerned
[44:11] once you believe God's word then you're
[44:13] concerned about what God is doing
[44:17] right
[44:19] like for the example I'll keep going
[44:21] back to this one that God answered the
[44:22] Roe versus Wade which we're coming up on
[44:24] the one year anniversary of that
[44:25] hallelujah amen thousands of babies have
[44:28] been saved because of that
[44:31] but I first had to be convinced and this
[44:33] is something that most message people
[44:35] don't do they don't pray for the
[44:36] government and laws to change they just
[44:38] want to go if I'm the last seed and go
[44:39] home
[44:41] they don't pray for sin to be removed
[44:44] in fact one of the uh the one of the
[44:46] leaders of Branham Tabernacle said uh
[44:49] get let the next president be the
[44:51] homosexual guy so he can lead the world
[44:53] into destruction and we'll all go to
[44:54] heaven the Rapture like he's actually
[44:56] praying for homosexuals to be the
[44:57] leaders
[44:58] the Bible never says that
[45:01] Jesus said don't give up until I come he
[45:03] said occupy until I come
[45:06] amen
[45:08] but see first I had to be convinced that
[45:09] God would actually care to change the
[45:12] law
[45:13] about uh about abortion and once I was
[45:17] convinced I actually found it by reading
[45:18] about American history through wall
[45:20] builders
[45:21] they she uh that wall Builders Guy
[45:23] what's his name
[45:25] David Barton thank you you're my second
[45:26] you're my third memory second memory
[45:30] David Martin used all these scriptures
[45:31] where
[45:32] and he used all this history of American
[45:34] presidents praying for God to move and
[45:37] God moved for them
[45:40] and if they're using they use the Bible
[45:42] and they saw God intercede in biotics
[45:44] make intercession in politics well he
[45:47] isn't Jesus Christ the same yesterday to
[45:49] him forever
[45:51] Hallelujah and so once I was convinced
[45:54] that that God does care about politics
[45:56] then I became concerned
[45:59] then I would spend time sister who
[46:01] prayed at this altar amen you saw it
[46:03] praise God my wife and the family saw it
[46:05] that's why I pray for all those years
[46:08] and then God changed the law because I
[46:10] got convinced I believed and then I got
[46:13] concerned praise God oh you can apply
[46:15] that to anything in your life first you
[46:17] got to be convinced what does God want
[46:18] you to do what is God's will once you
[46:21] know God's will you're convinced then
[46:22] you can be concerned about it praise God
[46:24] amen
[46:26] you got to be convinced it's God's will
[46:28] or it's God's desire for your life then
[46:31] you get concerned about it
[46:33] amen
[46:36] I like what brother man says now Andrew
[46:38] this is in John chapter one Andrew
[46:39] became very very concerned because he
[46:41] stayed with Jesus all night and was
[46:43] convinced and then when he become
[46:45] convinced that he was the Christ that he
[46:47] was concerned about somebody else
[46:49] now this is what brother Austin's been
[46:50] doing lately
[46:51] he's so convinced the message is right
[46:53] he's inviting people to church at his
[46:55] job
[46:56] right brother Austin
[46:58] don't we love that about our brother now
[47:00] church not everybody's called to be an
[47:01] Andrew
[47:02] Letterman said some people are prayer
[47:04] warriors they're not Soul winners
[47:06] some people are prayer Wars otherwise
[47:08] other people are fire Brands to preach
[47:11] right
[47:12] so we don't have to be all like Austin
[47:14] or Simon is a good witnessing machine
[47:16] and invites people to church all the
[47:17] time
[47:18] you just have to do you just have to
[47:19] believe amen I'll say that you just got
[47:22] to believe amen and you'll do the works
[47:23] of God hallelujah
[47:27] brother Madison I believe every man or
[47:28] woman every boy or girl that ever stays
[47:30] long enough that you're convinced it is
[47:32] right and it is the Holy Ghost you are
[47:34] burdened so hard in your heart you can't
[47:36] stand still and let these people die
[47:38] like this and shame and sin it'll grind
[47:40] the very heart out of you to get out
[47:42] here on these streets
[47:43] it does any Christian to see the people
[47:46] wholly given over to sin drinking
[47:48] gambling cursing swearing smoking now
[47:50] Brotherhood says this which is true it's
[47:52] true for all those people who are
[47:53] supposed to go witness on the streets
[47:55] but I never find brother Brown
[47:56] witnessing on the streets
[47:58] right listen to his ministry never talks
[48:00] about going out witnessing on the
[48:01] streets he says some people are called
[48:02] to do it but he never himself did that
[48:04] because he was praying for the sick
[48:06] right he's preaching behind the pulpit
[48:08] but somebody's going to be so burdened
[48:10] once they're convinced God's in it then
[48:13] they're going to be concerned about the
[48:15] Lost
[48:16] now see we don't ought to go out in the
[48:18] streets but we should all have prayer
[48:20] lives
[48:21] like Abraham ah amen and pray for people
[48:25] to be saved we should all have that
[48:27] desire once we're convinced that people
[48:30] could go to hell we got to be concerned
[48:32] to get them saved praise God
[48:34] amen
[48:37] so that's that's what I like I like
[48:39] brother Ram said uh or Jesus said just
[48:41] believe
[48:42] and then Brothers says once you're
[48:43] convinced once you believe something
[48:44] then you get concerned about other
[48:46] things other people
[48:50] all right now it's eight o'clock here
[48:52] let me go 15 minutes I'll set a timer
[48:54] right here I told my wife and I told my
[48:57] family a long time ago somebody needs to
[48:58] get a white flag back there and wave
[49:00] surrender once I once I I hit my limit
[49:02] okay
[49:04] say brother you said surrender you said
[49:06] you'd be done after 50 minutes okay so
[49:08] I Surrender okay
[49:09] I'll let God's people go
[49:13] you ever hear that joke the preacher
[49:14] said he said the the long way that he
[49:17] was from uh Mercy from Virginia
[49:20] and uh he was the pastor was kind of
[49:23] complaining about a guest preacher who
[49:25] was preaching long and
[49:27] he said he told him after service he
[49:29] said preacher he said you're just like
[49:30] Pharaoh he's like what do you mean I'm
[49:32] preaching the gospel he said you
[49:34] wouldn't let God's people go
[49:37] of course he was joking but that's a
[49:39] pretty rude joke
[49:41] now if you're now I know most people do
[49:44] it and it's led by the Holy Spirit but I
[49:45] do know a few that have held people for
[49:47] hours and they're LED they're not led by
[49:48] the Holy Spirit
[49:51] right
[49:52] we've seen that at another church last
[49:54] year we've seen that I've seen it
[49:57] I talked to some friends about it the
[49:59] man was trying to make a miracle happen
[50:01] and he failed the miracle didn't happen
[50:03] and then he blamed the whole church
[50:04] because America didn't happen
[50:06] that was not at this church it was at
[50:07] another church
[50:09] but that's an example where the man was
[50:10] like Pharaoh he didn't let the people go
[50:12] he was trying to bend in fact he was
[50:14] trying to vindicate that he was right
[50:15] and I was wrong it was about I was a
[50:17] part of it that's why I know about it
[50:21] because that's kind of related I
[50:22] actually preached on that a couple years
[50:23] ago
[50:24] I can tell you more about that if you
[50:26] like but
[50:28] all that to say give me 15 minutes
[50:31] all right Romans 5 verse one I'll be
[50:33] breaking this this we continue this
[50:34] section here therefore being justified
[50:36] by faith
[50:38] therefore means okay now that we've
[50:39] talked what's our conclusion we just
[50:42] went through we're all sinners
[50:45] we all deserve hell
[50:48] but like Abraham we become the
[50:50] righteousness of God
[50:52] amen therefore since we're like Abraham
[50:55] being justified by our simple Faith by
[50:58] just simply believing in Jesus Christ we
[51:01] have peace with God can we all say that
[51:03] let's all say I have peace with God can
[51:05] we I have peace with let's say it louder
[51:07] ready I have peace with now let's yell
[51:10] it ready I have peace with God Amen
[51:13] Hallelujah I memorized that verse about
[51:15] three years ago when I was struggling I
[51:16] was going through a season in my life
[51:17] and I memorized that that helped me so
[51:19] much I would quote that in the mornings
[51:21] I have peace with God and I overcame
[51:26] I don't struggle with that anymore I
[51:28] have peace with God most days I peace
[51:30] with God
[51:31] God has just showed me over and over
[51:32] again that he loves me now he may allow
[51:35] me to be tested like job he made malami
[51:36] tested like Daniel who knows
[51:39] but I just want to tell you I've grown
[51:41] to know that I have peace with God
[51:43] because of God's grace
[51:46] and I just believe with us that's all I
[51:47] do I just believe God's word
[51:49] I can't believe every promise I don't
[51:50] believe I don't bring every promise to
[51:52] pass in my life but I believe in Jesus
[51:54] Christ
[51:55] and that entitles me to peace with God
[51:58] just because I believe
[52:00] Hallelujah entitles you to peace with
[52:02] God just because you believe
[52:05] in other words I'm not fighting against
[52:07] God and church God's not fighting
[52:08] against you
[52:10] God's not fighting against you God's
[52:12] fighting for you
[52:14] remember your sicknesses are blessings
[52:17] Hallelujah
[52:19] the only case like sir and I we were and
[52:21] my wife were texting about communion the
[52:23] only time sickness is not a blessing is
[52:24] when you mistreat the body of Christ
[52:27] let's read that let's read that First
[52:30] Corinthians 11. remember this I preached
[52:31] this a couple years ago when I did that
[52:33] series on curses and blessings
[52:36] the only time sin or sickness would be a
[52:39] curse is if you you don't treat the body
[52:41] of Christ well you mistreat the Saints
[52:43] at church that's the only time
[52:45] sickness is a curse
[52:48] all right
[52:53] yeah verse 29. First Corinthians 11 29
[52:56] for he that eateth and drinketh
[52:57] unworthily ease and drink a damnation to
[52:59] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[53:01] that discernment means judge
[53:03] in other words when somebody doesn't
[53:04] take communion the right way they've
[53:06] judged somebody wrong in the church
[53:09] they treated somebody wrong in the
[53:11] church therefore they're under the curse
[53:14] of God the temporary curse of God and
[53:16] can you I'm sorry and let me read the
[53:18] next verse I'm sorry I'm not I got
[53:19] disconnected
[53:20] verse 30. for this cause many are weak
[53:23] and sickly among you and many sleep
[53:27] okay so when people are weak and sickly
[53:30] and die in the church
[53:33] it can be a curse if they mistreated
[53:36] other people
[53:39] that's what the Bible says
[53:41] now church I've said that before
[53:44] the book of Corinthians was a book of
[53:46] Acts Church it would start in the book
[53:48] of Acts
[53:49] and they had many people dying because
[53:51] they didn't treat each other the right
[53:52] way
[53:53] now I think I'm saying that to help us
[53:55] to be thankful be thankful that we have
[53:56] a healthy Church
[53:58] Hallelujah that's why I'm so glad God
[54:00] healed by the amen
[54:03] see
[54:06] people in the Corinthian Church weren't
[54:07] treating each other well so many of them
[54:09] were dying they had lots that happened
[54:10] at my mother's Church years ago
[54:15] some of the people spoke evil the
[54:16] message and then my brothers watched it
[54:19] and my wife my mom even told me
[54:21] many people died in that church in the
[54:23] next few years they had like 20 or 30
[54:25] funerals in the next couple years right
[54:27] after they spoke evil about this message
[54:29] not to me that's not Discerning the
[54:31] bodybuilder that's my opinion but I
[54:33] believe that's what happened because the
[54:34] woman used thus saith the Lord against
[54:36] this message
[54:37] she said thus say the Lord serpent seeds
[54:39] of the devil and then her husband got
[54:42] sick and then they had 20 or 30 funerals
[54:44] in a couple years
[54:46] it's like death struck the church
[54:49] that's not Discerning the Lord's body
[54:52] so you know you know what I did sister
[54:53] Selena I went over to her house and I
[54:55] took her flowers
[55:02] Hallelujah
[55:05] because that's how you overcome evil
[55:07] with good
[55:09] she called my brother of the devil she
[55:11] called our beliefs of the devil so what
[55:12] do I do I'm gonna take you flowers
[55:15] you know oh yeah I gave him a 50 gift
[55:17] card I said here you take your wife out
[55:18] to eat
[55:21] you can curse me but I'm going to bless
[55:22] you because I choose the Jesus way
[55:26] you curse me I'll bless you
[55:28] Hallelujah
[55:33] kind of got off of that a little bit
[55:35] let's get back to the Romans
[55:37] so see sickness is going to be a
[55:39] blessing
[55:41] unless
[55:42] it's a curse because we've mistreated
[55:45] people in the body of Christ
[55:46] that's why church if somebody offends
[55:48] you go to them one-on-one
[55:51] Even in our church go to them one-on-one
[55:54] if texting is easier do texting
[55:58] or go to them face to face maybe after
[56:00] service or something like that
[56:02] let's treat each other and we do that's
[56:04] why I love this church that's why I love
[56:05] being a part of this church
[56:06] I'm glad to be a member here at the
[56:08] church
[56:09] because everybody treats each other with
[56:11] kindness and respect
[56:13] everybody forgives one another that's
[56:15] why I'm grateful to be a member of this
[56:16] church
[56:18] that's why I'm glad I go to this church
[56:19] and
[56:20] I don't go to the churches
[56:23] and I don't know if my wife my wife
[56:25] might agree with this but I'd say this
[56:26] of all the churches I ever attended
[56:29] I think this one is a church full of a
[56:31] lot of love
[56:32] a lot of love in our church by God's
[56:33] grace
[56:35] so I'm very thankful for that now
[56:36] remember that's the same thing who said
[56:38] Naomi said that
[56:39] and William said that
[56:41] they said they've been to a lot of
[56:42] churches oh then that visitor our sister
[56:44] Elizabeth came
[56:45] and she said to the church that she's
[56:47] been this church had the most love
[56:50] remember brother William left and he
[56:52] said I miss you already I miss the
[56:53] perfect love of Jesus in your
[56:55] congregation that doesn't mean we don't
[56:57] make mistakes it just means we let
[56:58] Jesus's forgiveness forgive all of our
[57:01] mistakes
[57:03] praise God so I've had at least three
[57:05] people come and tell me this is the real
[57:07] church with the real love of Jesus
[57:08] Christ now there's more than that I know
[57:10] that over the years but those are three
[57:12] that I remember
[57:13] so let's have the love of Christ let's
[57:15] treat each other with love and grace
[57:16] here by God's grace
[57:18] to correct people at time just we all I
[57:19] make mistakes I'll apologize
[57:21] let's have the love of Christ everybody
[57:23] can know
[57:24] they're followers of Jesus because they
[57:26] have love one for one for another by
[57:28] God's grace
[57:29] and when somebody curses you let me know
[57:30] if you don't got money to give them
[57:31] flowers I'll I'll pay I'll pay for
[57:33] flowers let's go give them some flowers
[57:36] let's get them a gift card not to Target
[57:38] because they're supporting the
[57:40] lgbtq agenda whatever
[57:43] I'ma stop supporting them just so you
[57:44] know I haven't gone to their place since
[57:46] since I heard they supported the trans
[57:49] movement I'm going to Walmart now
[57:52] they might not be much better but
[57:54] I'm going to Giant Eagle now and just
[57:56] Audi now
[57:58] but in other words if somebody's mean
[58:00] towards you let's show them the love of
[58:02] Jesus Christ
[58:04] praise God
[58:06] therefore so what's the conclusion we're
[58:09] justified by faith we have peace with
[58:11] God through who Jesus Christ notice I
[58:13] didn't say you have peace with God
[58:14] through your good works
[58:17] you don't have peace with God through
[58:18] yours your amazing faith
[58:22] your amazing power
[58:24] no I have peace with God because Jesus
[58:26] gave me peace with God
[58:28] amen praise God
[58:30] I have peace with God because of what
[58:32] Christ did for me Hallelujah
[58:34] amen I'm almost at my 15 minutes I got
[58:36] five more minutes so bear with me here
[58:38] by whom also we have access by faith
[58:42] into this grace
[58:45] where do we stand and rejoice in Hope of
[58:47] the glory of God
[58:50] now that word access means this it means
[58:54] a Act of bringing to a moving to
