[15:44] and she was like this you know all night
[15:46] and
[15:47] we made it through the night and
[15:48] yesterday got a cast on her so
[15:50] let's just remember genevieve

[57:32] of the word of the lord
[57:33] amen do you enjoy good singing amen
[57:36] hallelujah when i say good of course i
[57:38] don't mean the technical part of it i
[57:40] mean the worship part of it amen
[57:43] and uh i want to say to little brother
[57:45] smith back here man that pin is sounding
[57:47] good you're going to have to teach me a
[57:48] few things when i get done with all this
[57:50] amen i like that
[57:52] i never will forget i had the shock of
[57:54] my life been a number of years ago now
[57:56] brother jesse but we've come into the
[57:58] little church for many years but jesse
[57:59] didn't have a piano player you know and
[58:01] you come in i was all raring to you know
[58:03] at your service sir and what can i do
[58:05] and do you need a piano player and he
[58:06] said we got one
[58:08] i said who
[58:12] i couldn't believe it i thought well
[58:14] praise the lord yeah that not that i
[58:15] couldn't believe it in that regard i
[58:17] mean it just really surprised me and
[58:19] shocked me that he had got on there and
[58:21] started playing and come along as quick
[58:23] as he did that was the thing because i
[58:25] thought well you know beginning piano
[58:26] player you know how they are you know
[58:28] mary had a little lamb oh not this kid
[58:31] no no he
[58:32] he was giving it all to it and i i said
[58:34] well i like that i i really like that
[58:37] amen sounded wonderful and you brother
[58:39] also so i don't want to leave you out
[58:41] wonderful talents wonderful guitar
[58:43] playing enjoy the singing and i was um
[58:46] listening to you outside the door there
[58:47] briefly and uh
[58:49] and i just thought the way that
[58:51] everybody's singing from the bottom of
[58:52] their heart it just sounded like real
[58:54] old-time meeting in here and i like that
[58:56] amen ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 if you
[58:59] got your bible i want to speak to you
[59:00] god helping us upon the purchase power
[59:04] amen the purchase power
[59:06] how many knows that we have power
[59:09] amen not within ourself but because the
[59:11] lord jesus
[59:12] has shared with us his power
[59:15] that's the only reason that we have
[59:16] power in the first place is because he
[59:18] has shared with us
[59:20] his abilities his powers his glory amen
[59:24] and how many knows he give it to us in
[59:25] the form of the holy ghost how many
[59:27] knows that
[59:28] that's right and uh looking now at
[59:31] ephesians 1. i want to read two verses
[59:32] 13 14 and i would like for you to read
[59:34] them with me amen as you're following
[59:37] along anyways
[59:38] and uh really pay attention to some of
[59:40] the reading now because paul is going to
[59:42] make some statements here that are very
[59:44] very very essential to understanding the
[59:46] baptism of the holy ghost so first thing
[59:49] we want to look at is
[59:50] the first part of this verse 13. now
[59:52] watch this close
[59:54] in whom ye also trusted
[59:57] after that
[59:59] ye
[59:59] heard the word of truth now stop there
[1:00:01] just a moment
[1:00:02] look at that ye
[1:00:04] y e
[1:00:05] you'll pay attention very closely to the
[1:00:07] very introduction of the holy ghost and
[1:00:10] what the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:12] actually means
[1:00:13] the holy ghost to you is not a they
[1:00:16] not of them
[1:00:17] not a body not a church but it's always
[1:00:20] an individual thing between you
[1:00:23] and jesus christ
[1:00:25] this is why paul didn't say in whom they
[1:00:28] trusted after they
[1:00:30] received the word of truth in whom ye
[1:00:33] also trusted that is the real genuine
[1:00:36] new birth a personal revelation to you
[1:00:39] not to they not to them not to the
[1:00:40] church not to the body but to you
[1:00:42] individually as sons and daughters of
[1:00:45] god
[1:00:46] now watch this is the gospel of your
[1:00:48] salvation now notice you hear the word
[1:00:50] of truth
[1:00:51] but then it is the gospel of your
[1:00:53] salvation so what paul if you link this
[1:00:55] together with other places what paul is
[1:00:58] saying in other words you didn't just
[1:00:59] come to church in the word
[1:01:01] the sound of somebody preaching the word
[1:01:03] reverberated off your eardrum you heard
[1:01:05] it
[1:01:06] but that gospel was demonstrated to you
[1:01:10] for your salvation so it wasn't just the
[1:01:12] preaching of the word of truth but it
[1:01:13] was also the demonstration which the
[1:01:15] gospel is not just word only but power
[1:01:18] and demonstration of the holy ghost so
[1:01:20] he's demonstrating to you those very
[1:01:21] things now watch these in whom also
[1:01:25] after everybody say after
[1:01:28] after that ye believe say it again after
[1:01:31] you believed ye were sealed with that
[1:01:34] holy spirit of promise so not when you
[1:01:36] believe but after you believe
[1:01:40] there'll be
[1:01:41] some old drunks sitting on a bar stool
[1:01:43] you believe god
[1:01:45] yeah i believe in god but he he says
[1:01:48] that and he does believe
[1:01:49] but after a man or woman believes god
[1:01:52] not just when they're on a high or in
[1:01:54] skid row or in trouble on and on and on
[1:01:58] but after they believe god then god
[1:02:00] confirms their faith by sending the holy
[1:02:02] spirit as a seal that seal tells us
[1:02:05] tells you
[1:02:07] that you have fully trusted in the
[1:02:10] gospel of your salvation if you don't
[1:02:12] get that i don't care how much the old
[1:02:14] drunk says
[1:02:15] glory to god i believe him i believe him
[1:02:17] yeah i go to church every sunday sure
[1:02:19] the devil does the same thing
[1:02:21] and got nothing to do with whether
[1:02:23] you're born again or not come on
[1:02:24] somebody talk to me a little bit amen it
[1:02:26] got nothing to do with it believing is
[1:02:27] only a partial step in the full process
[1:02:30] of it
[1:02:31] amen now the holy spirit then verse 14.
[1:02:33] now let's focus on that a moment then
[1:02:35] let's pray
[1:02:36] which is the earnest
[1:02:38] of our inheritance
[1:02:40] now paul uses two words here for earnest
[1:02:44] in the greek there's one word here
[1:02:45] arabhan and then there's another word
[1:02:47] could rio now uses these two greek words
[1:02:49] for the same word earnest
[1:02:51] the first one this one here we're
[1:02:52] reading audubon which he would say in
[1:02:54] the greek in his language of speaking
[1:02:56] greek or ever how they would speak on
[1:02:59] the street they would say uh are a bond
[1:03:01] or in other words this is a down payment
[1:03:03] or a portion of money that i owe you but
[1:03:07] then this this other word carrillo he
[1:03:09] brings it in just a little bit later
[1:03:11] we'll get to that in a moment i don't
[1:03:12] want to leave you standing too long but
[1:03:14] just just to put it out there so you're
[1:03:15] thinking in that direction for a moment
[1:03:17] but this particular now this is arabon
[1:03:20] which is an earnest or a pledge or a
[1:03:22] down payment of the full amount so
[1:03:25] paul's saying christ give us an earnest
[1:03:27] money
[1:03:28] of the inheritance the full inheritance
[1:03:30] may be this but he gives us a portion
[1:03:32] like this
[1:03:34] until
[1:03:35] the redemption of the purchase pres
[1:03:37] possession unto
[1:03:39] the praise of his glory so
[1:03:42] brother
[1:03:44] if the down payment is this good imagine
[1:03:47] what three fours and
[1:03:48] four force and the rest of it would be
[1:03:50] like
[1:03:51] the whole thing would almost take you
[1:03:52] out of this world it will take you out
[1:03:53] of this world one of these days amen
[1:03:55] that's why i believe in laying up
[1:03:56] inheritances and my inheritance is out
[1:03:58] of this world that's right amen my
[1:04:00] benefits are out of this world right
[1:04:02] amen now second corinthians chapter 1
[1:04:04] verse 21
[1:04:05] and 22. now let's catch this verse here
[1:04:08] and uh and then and then let's pray over
[1:04:10] the word now second corinthians chapter
[1:04:12] 1 verse 21 and 22.
[1:04:16] now we're in the second letter to the
[1:04:18] church of corinthians which corinthians
[1:04:20] is a book of correction
[1:04:21] and thank god that was people that was
[1:04:24] low down and sorry and rotten enough
[1:04:26] that could do all kinds of things wrong
[1:04:28] that paul could write about him because
[1:04:30] the rest of us sorry low down good for
[1:04:31] nothing people needed to read this amen
[1:04:33] amen that's that's the way that works
[1:04:35] amen second corinthians chapter 1 verse
[1:04:37] 21 now he which establishes us with you
[1:04:41] in christ
[1:04:42] and hath anointed us
[1:04:45] is god
[1:04:46] who hath also sealed us
[1:04:50] and given the earnest now this word is
[1:04:52] called rio now he's not saying arab like
[1:04:54] down payment now he's using a different
[1:04:56] version we would say of this word like
[1:04:58] for example if i said to you bored
[1:05:00] bored may be in english one word but it
[1:05:02] has four or five different meanings
[1:05:03] behind that one english word same idea
[1:05:06] here now paul when he says he hath given
[1:05:09] us the earnest of the spirit in our
[1:05:10] hearts now he's saying this
[1:05:13] to anoint
[1:05:15] or to furnish
[1:05:16] with the necessary powers
[1:05:19] to equip
[1:05:21] with what is necessary for its
[1:05:23] administration
[1:05:24] so paul in just saying i'm giving you a
[1:05:26] piece of a payment but now he's saying
[1:05:29] christ hath not only given you a portion
[1:05:32] but he hath equipped you anointed you
[1:05:35] furnished you with everything you have
[1:05:37] need of to do the thing god called you
[1:05:40] to do before he takes you out of here
[1:05:43] oh we can close right there and say been
[1:05:44] good to be in church can't we that's
[1:05:46] that's powerful amen let's pray together
[1:05:48] over the word
[1:05:49] and father we thank you so much lord
[1:05:51] it's a privilege to be able to bow our

[1:06:11] word and by thy presence that we might
[1:06:14] be receivers and sponges of the truth of
[1:06:17] this last time

[1:06:26] mercy to us today now and open our
[1:06:28] hearts and lives that we might be

[1:06:55] misdirected lord not knowing what the
[1:06:56] direction is may thy light go forth
[1:06:59] tonight lord jesus from this little
[1:07:02] place and around the world even if it be
[1:07:04] thy will and bring every lost soul into
[1:07:06] thy folders we know you said you would
[1:07:07] never lose not even one
[1:07:10] lord i claim i'm that one they claim we
[1:07:12] are one of those ones we know we are in
[1:07:15] your hand and we thank you and praise
[1:07:17] you and we trust you'll come into our
[1:07:18] midst now and do great things send thy
[1:07:21] angels into this place lord with great
[1:07:24] supernatural signs wonders and miracles
[1:07:27] lord jesus though it may be quiet though
[1:07:29] it may be unseen deliver and drop into
[1:07:32] every heart the need that is laying
[1:07:33] before this body in the name of jesus
[1:07:36] christ now we commit the word both
[1:07:37] speaker and listener to your hands amen
[1:07:40] and amen and amen god bless you you may
[1:07:43] be seated for just a little bit amen may
[1:07:45] the lord bless you so very good you know
[1:07:48] pentecostal preachers say be seated for
[1:07:50] a little bit because we're hoping you'll
[1:07:51] jump up again when the word starts
[1:07:53] hallelujah
[1:07:54] amen but anyways we know that the spirit
[1:07:57] of the lord amen is upon me jesus said
[1:08:00] because he hath carrio or anointed me to
[1:08:04] preach the gospel the very same word
[1:08:06] that paul uses here for the anointing of
[1:08:09] the holy spirit
[1:08:10] is the exact same word that jesus uses
[1:08:13] when he quotes from the book of isaiah
[1:08:15] now we know that as the body of christ
[1:08:17] to be christians to be believers
[1:08:20] that no one i don't care what their name
[1:08:22] is who they are what stature or
[1:08:24] character they might hold amen in life
[1:08:26] of what kind of monies or positions or
[1:08:30] powers they might be in every man every
[1:08:32] woman come to the world shape and
[1:08:34] iniquity in sin my mother conceived me i
[1:08:37] came to the world speaking lies i was a
[1:08:40] loser from my very birth
[1:08:43] there was no under any circumstances
[1:08:46] that i could have changed myself mercy
[1:08:48] and ask for his forgiveness and then he
[1:08:50] justifies me forgives me of all of my
[1:08:52] past sins then knowing that there's no
[1:08:55] way no matter how holy i might dress or
[1:08:58] how righteous i might try to speak or
[1:09:00] how careful i am with my thoughts
[1:09:02] there's no way that i can sanctify
[1:09:05] myself then knowing that i needed a
[1:09:07] further step of mercy and grace amen by
[1:09:10] his holy spirit he sanctified and
[1:09:13] cleansed my heart amen that that i may
[1:09:16] not have been perfect at that time i may
[1:09:17] have had little things that i had to
[1:09:19] work on amen but the desire to want to
[1:09:21] do those things has been taken away can
[1:09:24] you say amen amen and then when he sends
[1:09:27] the holy spirit into my heart he does so
[1:09:30] so that he can lay claim upon me claim
[1:09:34] upon my body claim upon my mind amen
[1:09:37] this is christ making his mark upon you
[1:09:40] and telling the world telling you
[1:09:42] telling the devil telling all of heaven
[1:09:44] telling everyone around amen this is my
[1:09:47] beloved son this is my beloved daughter
[1:09:50] amen and whom i'm well pleased to dwell
[1:09:52] in amen the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:09:55] has been one of the most misunderstood
[1:09:58] subjects in christendom today the reason
[1:10:00] it's misunderstood is because man is
[1:10:03] always trying to figure the formula out
[1:10:06] amen but what we need to know if we want
[1:10:08] to understand what it is that's been
[1:10:10] sent into our heart amen is first of all
[1:10:12] it ain't our formula
[1:10:14] first of all it ain't our promise first
[1:10:16] of all it's not within our power to move
[1:10:19] into the baptism of the holy ghost this
[1:10:21] is a work that christ and christ alone
[1:10:24] can do you can't do it by joining a
[1:10:26] church or believing a message or why
[1:10:28] following a prophet amen you can't do it
[1:10:30] by following a pastor or a teacher an
[1:10:32] evangelist for that matter amen you
[1:10:34] receive the holy spirit amen when christ
[1:10:38] deems your vessel amen is worthy of
[1:10:41] reception of that holy spirit that's
[1:10:44] right amen not how long your hair is
[1:10:47] or your dress amen and i'm going to go
[1:10:50] on the other side not even how long your
[1:10:51] tongue is amen amen christ ain't looking
[1:10:54] for a perfect individual he never come
[1:10:56] to save perfect people
[1:10:58] he came to save those that could believe
[1:11:00] him amen and shove aside all unbelief
[1:11:04] though they might struggle though they
[1:11:06] might fight though they might wrestle
[1:11:08] with that own personal unbelief but
[1:11:10] christ is looking for a willing man or
[1:11:12] woman that'll throw themselves before
[1:11:14] jesus christ and say here am i lord send
[1:11:17] me amen here am i willing hearts
[1:11:22] let me tell you something brother one
[1:11:23] reason that we don't have more
[1:11:24] evangelists on the field today they're
[1:11:26] not willing
[1:11:27] amen it's a hard life
[1:11:29] amen you got to struggle from church to
[1:11:31] church service to service to service
[1:11:33] amen it's either a fight dealing with
[1:11:34] traffic amen and contrary people on the
[1:11:37] road or a fight dealing with traffic and
[1:11:39] contrary people in church it's a battle
[1:11:40] amen amen no matter where you're at or
[1:11:43] what you're going amen it's a tough
[1:11:45] thing some preachers well i'll just work
[1:11:47] me a job preach to a couple times a year
[1:11:49] amen just do a little work for the lord
[1:11:51] amen but there's no suffering amen
[1:11:54] there's no suffering involved they live
[1:11:55] a cushy life in a nice house and a nice
[1:11:58] home amen and everything is hunky-dory
[1:12:00] we say down in the south amen but god is
[1:12:03] looking for a man willing willing to get
[1:12:05] on the road to go out into the jungles
[1:12:07] and be a missionary looking for someone
[1:12:09] willing to sacrifice the things of this
[1:12:12] life to do the works of the lord and
[1:12:15] brother jesse that's what he's looking
[1:12:17] for in his in his saints that's what
[1:12:19] he's looking for in his bride that's
[1:12:21] what he's looking for in his ministers
[1:12:23] that's what he's looking for in his
[1:12:24] singers and his officers is someone
[1:12:26] willing to pay a price amen pay a price
[1:12:29] for the glory of god and jesus christ
[1:12:33] if we want to be recipients of the holy
[1:12:36] ghost we've got to be willing to lay
[1:12:37] down some things
[1:12:39] we've got to be willing to lay our life
[1:12:41] into the hands of someone that we're not
[1:12:42] even sure is around us sometimes we
[1:12:45] don't see him we don't taste him we
[1:12:47] don't uh touch him we don't feel him and
[1:12:50] we don't hear him often amen many hours
[1:12:52] of the day you'll go and not even feel
[1:12:55] like the holy spirit is around you and
[1:12:57] yet he tells us read a book that you're
[1:12:59] not sure is his and trust a presence
[1:13:01] you're not sure is there amen and
[1:13:03] believe on a promise that you're not
[1:13:05] really even sincere wasn't invented in
[1:13:07] hollywood somewhere another amen but
[1:13:09] christ in the very same token still
[1:13:12] tells us lay all of that imagination
[1:13:15] aside lay all of that fictitious aside
[1:13:19] amen and put your confidence in me and
[1:13:21] let me tell you something brother sister
[1:13:23] if a man or woman is willing to take god
[1:13:25] at his word amen he will come
[1:13:29] on the scene he will prove himself he
[1:13:33] will manifest himself he will show
[1:13:35] himself he comes to those that are
[1:13:37] looking for him and expecting him to do
[1:13:39] great things in their midst
[1:13:43] right but it's difficult at first to
[1:13:44] believe such things it's hard at first
[1:13:47] to have it in your mind okay this god i
[1:13:49] can't see him where is he amen the
[1:13:51] agnostic will tell you all it's just a
[1:13:52] thing in your mind all of that is just
[1:13:54] positive self-talk all that thing you
[1:13:56] think is the lord speaking to you that's
[1:13:58] just that's just you being a happy
[1:14:00] person and believing in yourself amen
[1:14:02] but yet at the very same time amen if
[1:14:05] man is so powerful within himself then
[1:14:07] please tell me why the jails are full of
[1:14:09] people that did things and don't know
[1:14:11] why they did it amen tell me why that
[1:14:14] the psychological clinics are full of
[1:14:16] people that have no ability to just
[1:14:18] positive thank themself out of
[1:14:20] depression out of suicide out of all of
[1:14:22] the bipolarism and the manifold things
[1:14:24] that they're facing amen if man is so
[1:14:27] powerful amen then maybe the satan
[1:14:29] worshipers are right amen do you realize
[1:14:32] that the religion of satanism is not a
[1:14:34] religion of worshiping the devil you got
[1:14:37] that wrong if you think that what they
[1:14:39] actually believe is that man is both god
[1:14:41] and the devil and that man is his own
[1:14:44] maker of his own good and his own maker
[1:14:47] of his own enemy and his own evil and
[1:14:49] his own satanic something amen it's not
[1:14:52] they fall down at some altar and go oh
[1:14:54] lucifer that's just a bunch of hollywood
[1:14:56] and fantastic the real essence of satan
[1:14:59] worship is man empowering himself to
[1:15:02] believe that his evil is necessary and
[1:15:04] as good as necessary my god i wish
[1:15:06] somebody would preach with me right now
[1:15:08] amen that's exactly what satan told eve
[1:15:11] in the garden of eden you follow me and
[1:15:13] i'll make you a god that's exactly what
[1:15:16] he tried to do amen empower her with the
[1:15:19] ability to do god-like things but
[1:15:21] brother let me tell you something amen
[1:15:23] when the voice of the lord come walking
[1:15:25] in the cool of the evening amen man both
[1:15:28] man and woman ran ahead from god and
[1:15:31] covered themselves believed at the fear
[1:15:33] of the voice of him who has the real
[1:15:35] control in our lives
[1:15:38] amen adam didn't have the mental prowess
[1:15:40] or the mental strength of the mental
[1:15:41] ability amen to stand in the face of god
[1:15:44] and tell a bald-faced lie
[1:15:46] amen and man still doesn't have the
[1:15:48] ability to make his own evil his own
[1:15:50] good
[1:15:50] i agree he's been born off a tree of
[1:15:52] knowledge of good and evil but this is
[1:15:54] why he must be born again
[1:15:57] amen he cannot make his own fortune he
[1:16:00] cannot fulfill his own destiny
[1:16:02] we hear the expression you know that a
[1:16:04] man is a maker and a master of his own
[1:16:06] directions that's a lie and if you want
[1:16:08] to make god laugh if you know every time
[1:16:10] in your life you ever want to you tell
[1:16:12] god a joke tell him your plans
[1:16:15] amen because one thing's for sure
[1:16:16] whatever you tell the lord amen it's
[1:16:18] like a father laughing at a small child
[1:16:21] amen trying to drive a car about four or
[1:16:23] five years old going
[1:16:25] going down the road run run run amen and
[1:16:27] we laugh at them why because we know
[1:16:29] they don't have the ability to drive
[1:16:31] that car amen that's about the way it is
[1:16:33] with human today amen we make our own
[1:16:35] plans make our own destinies we set
[1:16:38] five-year goals 10-year goals amen but
[1:16:40] my bible tells me amen don't go into a
[1:16:43] city and say we'll make so much money
[1:16:45] today amen and stay here for a year but
[1:16:47] say if the lord be willing we'll do the
[1:16:50] things that god wants us to do
[1:16:53] amen we have as we sing the song we have
[1:16:56] no promise of tomorrow amen jesus said
[1:16:58] don't even think about it that's a hard
[1:17:01] thing to do isn't it i mean i don't mind
[1:17:03] telling you that as a a planner i'm an
[1:17:05] ambitious person that god's made me in a
[1:17:07] way that i like to see things 15 years
[1:17:09] down the steps but i've come to find out
[1:17:12] that everything i ever decided had to be
[1:17:14] a certain certain way was always the
[1:17:17] opposite of everything i ever planned
[1:17:19] amen so i've just tried to learn through
[1:17:21] the years that we trust god we have
[1:17:24] confidence in his direction have
[1:17:26] confidence in his leadership amen that's
[1:17:28] why i'm standing here 23 years later
[1:17:31] amen married to what i think is one of
[1:17:33] the greatest women to ever walk shoe
[1:17:34] leather amen she's got to be great she's
[1:17:36] put up with me for 23 years
[1:17:39] hallelujah and i believe that god leads
[1:17:42] a man leads a woman in the direction
[1:17:44] that they should go the scripture tells
[1:17:46] and i'm quoting now amen ponder the
[1:17:48] direction of your feet that's true amen
[1:17:51] don't just lay down and say i'm not
[1:17:52] going to do this or i'm not going to do
[1:17:54] that amen the prophet said christians
[1:17:56] are the most ambitious people in the
[1:17:58] world amen christ puts within them the
[1:18:01] ability to work and labor and achieve
[1:18:04] amen but they do so amen not because of
[1:18:07] their mental ability not because of
[1:18:10] their education not because of their
[1:18:12] standard or their grit but because they
[1:18:14] are following amen the leadership of the
[1:18:17] jesus christ and they know exactly what
[1:18:19] god wants out of their life
[1:18:22] amen the prophet said here you give me a
[1:18:24] man a painter a farmer a factory worker
[1:18:26] and so forth he said a man or woman that
[1:18:28] will fully surrender their self to god
[1:18:30] and trust god and put him first he said
[1:18:31] i'll show you a man and woman that'll be
[1:18:33] successful in spite of all the devil
[1:18:34] throws at him
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:36] right we talk about success but we talk
[1:18:39] about it from the context of a self-help
[1:18:41] book in a positive affirmation book and
[1:18:43] from the from the from the aspect of the
[1:18:45] latest latest of the latest of the top
[1:18:48] speaker or the latest ted talk and those
[1:18:50] are the ones that inspire us amen but
[1:18:52] jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:18:55] god and all these things will be added
[1:18:58] to you
[1:19:01] amen what i'm trying to say is that we
[1:19:03] make our own plans and we try to form
[1:19:05] our own destinies when we should be
[1:19:07] spending our lives in total surrender to
[1:19:10] the hand of almighty god
[1:19:12] there should never be a time never be a
[1:19:14] moment never be an hour never be a
[1:19:16] minute never be a second or a time of
[1:19:18] day that we don't stop and say lord am i
[1:19:21] still in your will am i still doing the
[1:19:23] things you want me to do
[1:19:25] am i still pleasing you am i still
[1:19:26] following you
[1:19:28] amen i think this is sometimes why uh
[1:19:30] women and forgive me sisters if this
[1:19:32] sounds harsh i don't mean to sound just
[1:19:34] you know dispassionate or to be uh uh
[1:19:39] fail to be courteous in some manner when
[1:19:41] i say this but i think this is why
[1:19:42] sometimes women will get so upset when
[1:19:44] they lose a baby amen or they go through
[1:19:46] a miscarriage or you know some tragedy
[1:19:49] will happen and a child will die amen
[1:19:51] it's not the connection as much as as is
[1:19:55] that's a natural thing of course if a
[1:19:57] woman carries this baby say nine months
[1:19:59] and then it's still born well sure that
[1:20:00] makes sense why that it would affect her
[1:20:02] but i think the deeper reason some can't
[1:20:05] get over such loss like that is because
[1:20:07] we make our own plans and because we can
[1:20:10] carry a child within our body we begin
[1:20:12] thinking or a father can propagate life
[1:20:14] we begin thinking that we have control
[1:20:17] over that child's destiny amen we don't
[1:20:20] this is why the bible said train them in
[1:20:22] the way they should go when we train
[1:20:24] somebody we train them amen hoping that
[1:20:27] they will listen to wise counsel rather
[1:20:29] than become a robot regurgitating
[1:20:32] everything we tell them
[1:20:33] we can't control their destiny i was
[1:20:35] thinking about it in the office
[1:20:37] i thought you know lord you've given me
[1:20:39] a wonderful family some wonderful girls
[1:20:41] and i was thinking of brother jesse and
[1:20:43] his family and how nice it's been that
[1:20:45] the lord has given him kids that want to
[1:20:47] serve the lord and help him in the
[1:20:48] church and i was thinking of that but i
[1:20:50] thought yes but at the same time you
[1:20:53] know and my girls are in church
[1:20:55] amen and they love the lord i believe
[1:20:57] and i i told them just yesterday you
[1:20:59] know i said
[1:21:00] i'm waiting on the hour when you get to
[1:21:03] a spot to where you can receive the holy
[1:21:04] ghost and i told him until that hour
[1:21:06] arrives i'm your holy ghost until that
[1:21:08] time comes i'm the one going to watch
[1:21:10] out for you and protect you and mama and
[1:21:12] i are going to keep our watchful eye on
[1:21:14] until jesus can take over but this is
[1:21:16] the reason we dedicate him at the altar
[1:21:18] this is the reason we give him to the
[1:21:20] hands of god because think of it as much
[1:21:22] as we try to raise our kids in a
[1:21:24] christian environment amen that alone is
[1:21:27] not the destiny of a child amen god is
[1:21:31] the one that shapes look how many
[1:21:33] drunkard homes and drug addict-type
[1:21:35] homes that christ amen will snatch them
[1:21:38] right out of that home amen and give
[1:21:39] them a life worthy of the gospel
[1:21:42] amen now that's not to say we don't want
[1:21:44] to do our part we want to do everything
[1:21:46] we can to serve the lord amen and teach
[1:21:48] our kids to serve the lord to the best
[1:21:50] of our ability amen but just placing
[1:21:52] them in church is not going to put them
[1:21:54] in a condition to where that god's
[1:21:57] predestination will be overrode amen but
[1:22:00] when we lose children in this world
[1:22:02] maybe a baby will die amen or a woman
[1:22:04] cannot carry a child to birth maybe
[1:22:06] she's barren amen we get so upset and so
[1:22:09] tore up but brother sister unless we
[1:22:12] forget amen it was paul that quoted my
[1:22:14] it was god that separated me from my
[1:22:17] mother's womb amen meaning that it was
[1:22:19] god who gave the life god who brought it
[1:22:22] in this world god who took it out amen
[1:22:24] and what i'm trying to say is we get so
[1:22:27] upset because we feel like the power has
[1:22:29] been stripped from us
[1:22:32] but no man can give life
[1:22:34] no woman can give life though she might
[1:22:36] give birth she can't give life
[1:22:39] it takes god to give life and forgive me
[1:22:41] sisters i don't know your background
[1:22:42] your past i don't know i hope i'm not
[1:22:44] saying something that sounds ugly or out
[1:22:46] of the way i'm trying to show you a
[1:22:47] spiritual principle to what i'm saying
[1:22:50] amen just the same exact thing when god
[1:22:52] will take a loved one go to the other
[1:22:53] end of life now amen and you look and
[1:22:56] you see that uh you know maybe maybe
[1:22:58] some teenager get killed on the road
[1:23:00] some drunk driver hit him at a party one
[1:23:02] night or some kind of a thing some boy
[1:23:03] coming from the church amen and he's
[1:23:05] dead now
[1:23:07] they'll go to the casket wheel more and
[1:23:08] we'll cry of course we miss him of
[1:23:10] course we feel the loss of course we
[1:23:12] carry that burden within our spirit
[1:23:14] within our body and our mind amen we'll
[1:23:16] go through the seven steps of grieving
[1:23:18] and those things we'll go through the
[1:23:20] denial we'll go through the acceptance
[1:23:22] we'll go through all of those things
[1:23:23] amen but while we're standing by the
[1:23:25] casket lest we forget it was god who
[1:23:28] taketh
[1:23:30] it's who giveth amen he's the one that
[1:23:33] shows mercy and he's the one we have to
[1:23:35] learn to trust in all things
[1:23:38] amen it's the same way while we're
[1:23:39] living here in life if god gives us a
[1:23:41] life amen and your man lives say to be
[1:23:44] 20 30 40 50 60 years old amen the bible
[1:23:47] said that god promised us 70 years
[1:23:50] but then paul turns around and said but
[1:23:52] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:23:54] and many sleep that means dead
[1:23:57] amen the reason some of them had to go
[1:23:58] prematurely amen it's because they
[1:24:00] wouldn't be obedient to christ in his
[1:24:02] word and if you are a believer amen and
[1:24:04] truly a genuine saved believer if you
[1:24:07] won't be obedient to him he'll let your
[1:24:09] life be cut short of your three score in
[1:24:12] 10.
[1:24:13] what i'm trying to say is that at the
[1:24:14] end of the day we need to understand
[1:24:16] that in order to be a christian we must
[1:24:18] relinquish all control amen from birth
[1:24:22] from conception to life to death our
[1:24:24] journey and where we go all of it has to
[1:24:27] be committed and dedicated to the hands
[1:24:29] of the master of life
[1:24:31] now is he the master of it he's the
[1:24:33] creator of it
[1:24:34] amen but we get so upset when that job
[1:24:36] don't come through we get so objection
[1:24:39] set when that rays don't come through we
[1:24:41] object to god in his presence why'd you
[1:24:43] make it like that lord paul addresses
[1:24:45] that in the book of corinthians or
[1:24:46] excuse me in the book of romans when he
[1:24:48] says amen can the potter amen can the
[1:24:51] clay say to the potter why did you make
[1:24:54] me this way
[1:24:55] amen it's not my choice
[1:24:57] it's not my decision as a matter of fact
[1:25:00] the apostle paul tells us here later in
[1:25:02] the book of ephesians as you're coming
[1:25:03] down amen into a few places that the
[1:25:06] weakness of the law
[1:25:07] amen and i want to tell you something
[1:25:09] we'd put so much on our free moral
[1:25:10] agency and our choice and how we choose
[1:25:13] i believe that a man has to say yes to
[1:25:15] god but let me tell you what it probably
[1:25:17] looks like the truth of the matter is
[1:25:19] amen we cracked the door just enough for
[1:25:21] him to jam his foot in there so he can
[1:25:23] take over amen because you know how it
[1:25:25] is we choose one thing today and then
[1:25:28] decide that choice wasn't good the next
[1:25:30] day amen if you don't believe that just
[1:25:32] watch everybody after church when you're
[1:25:33] trying to figure out where to go eat
[1:25:36] amen it goes to prove that even though
[1:25:38] we are free moral agents there is a
[1:25:40] weakness in our own choosing brother
[1:25:42] jesse amen i'll serve him today but in
[1:25:44] six months when the trials are hard i
[1:25:47] will decide that it's over with and i'm
[1:25:49] done serving the lord amen brother
[1:25:51] that's why i'm so thankful to stand here
[1:25:53] before you this morning and say thanks
[1:25:55] be to god that i had no say in the
[1:25:58] matter once i relinquish my control amen
[1:26:01] he that began this good work is he that
[1:26:04] will finish this work to the day of
[1:26:06] jesus christ
[1:26:08] amen i just say yes long enough for him
[1:26:11] to get in charge
[1:26:13] and when he takes charge and he takes
[1:26:15] over and he takes control praise be to
[1:26:17] god amen that's the moment that i can
[1:26:20] now say i am bought with a price i am
[1:26:22] not my own in that wonderful think about
[1:26:25] it in this way we think to ourselves why
[1:26:28] did god make me this way why did god
[1:26:30] make me and shape me in a certain
[1:26:32] direction why am i the kind of man that
[1:26:34] i am or the kind of woman i am it's
[1:26:36] because god understands
[1:26:39] what is needed to make the body do what
[1:26:41] it needs to do
[1:26:43] and it is honestly the truth i'll say
[1:26:46] this to you it is honestly the truth
[1:26:49] that the only reason we feel bad about
[1:26:51] ourselves by the way we look or the way
[1:26:53] we dress or whatever is because we're
[1:26:55] living in an eden that satan has created
[1:26:57] for himself
[1:26:59] and in this satan's eden in this place
[1:27:01] we live in amen folks that are doing the
[1:27:04] things they do and acting the way they
[1:27:06] act and behaving the way they behave a
[1:27:08] lot of it is the influence of technology
[1:27:11] and hollywood and all of these other
[1:27:13] things because let me tell you something
[1:27:14] sister amen i don't care how big your
[1:27:16] nose is when you get to heaven nobody
[1:27:18] cares
[1:27:21] amen i don't they're not going to care
[1:27:23] whether you have curly hair or straight
[1:27:24] hair amen whether you're asian or
[1:27:26] whether you're a man
[1:27:28] african-american or or anglo-saxon why
[1:27:31] does sugar like me they don't care amen
[1:27:34] god is every bit a bouquet of humanity
[1:27:37] and he's not looking none of us will be
[1:27:39] walking up streets of gold saying why is
[1:27:41] she wearing red red looks so bad on that
[1:27:44] lady amen they won't think that way but
[1:27:46] we're a product of an age of people amen
[1:27:50] that for 6 000 years have tried to take
[1:27:53] their own destinies in their hand and
[1:27:55] let me tell you how powerful man is amen
[1:27:58] i'm reading from the book of genesis now
[1:27:59] amen i can't stop and read all these
[1:28:01] things we'll be here all afternoon so i
[1:28:02] got to keep quoting amen i'm just
[1:28:04] trusting you'll do the homework all
[1:28:05] right amen you do the homework and i'll
[1:28:08] give you the assignments amen but watch
[1:28:10] in the bible god said we went down and
[1:28:12] we looked and we saw a man building the
[1:28:14] tower of babel and his ambition was so
[1:28:17] great to get to heaven that he would
[1:28:19] achieve the thing that he wanted to do
[1:28:22] one mind one accord amen and god said
[1:28:25] let us go down and confuse them amen
[1:28:28] less man a ch
[1:28:32] the things that he was trying to achieve
[1:28:33] you see because where there is unity
[1:28:35] there is power amen when people get in
[1:28:37] one mind and one accord there is power
[1:28:39] in that process once they dedicate and
[1:28:41] commit themselves to being in unity amen
[1:28:43] there's power in it
[1:28:45] if you don't think so just look at a
[1:28:46] sports team
[1:28:48] amen as we was coming over the uh ohio
[1:28:50] river yesterday we hit right at the time
[1:28:52] that the bengals had won their playoff
[1:28:54] thing
[1:28:55] and and the fireworks the orange
[1:28:56] fireworks were going up all around the
[1:28:58] stadium and they were just hooping and
[1:28:59] hollering and we looked up you could see
[1:29:01] the you know the stands going way up to
[1:29:03] the top with fans all dressed in orange
[1:29:05] and the bengals colors and people
[1:29:07] hollering who day who day who they you
[1:29:09] know
[1:29:10] and and going on going on going on amen
[1:29:12] and as we were crossing over there i
[1:29:14] thought to myself yes amen it's a team
[1:29:17] amen that may not have had the best
[1:29:19] players but it was a team that had unity
[1:29:22] they got in the same mind the same goals
[1:29:24] they all work for that goal amen nobody
[1:29:26] stops and looks back at the tape and
[1:29:28] says you know what i didn't like the
[1:29:30] color of my uniform there amen i didn't
[1:29:32] like the way my right shoe felt i didn't
[1:29:34] like the way amen the coach yelled at me
[1:29:36] no they had a vision they had a goal and
[1:29:39] once they got in unity of that goal and
[1:29:41] that vision amen they drove for that
[1:29:43] vision and laid all of that petty stuff
[1:29:45] aside i hope you're spiritual amen i
[1:29:47] hope you're listening to me amen this is
[1:29:49] what the apostle paul tells us amen
[1:29:52] let's hide every weight that easily
[1:29:54] besets us let's hide every stumbling and
[1:29:56] petty thing amen and press to the mark
[1:29:59] of the high calling in jesus christ
[1:30:02] amen get in one mind and one accord and
[1:30:04] man has great power
[1:30:06] however when man begins to achieve if he
[1:30:08] achieves outside of the will of god it
[1:30:11] will always come to naught
[1:30:13] quoting from the book of psalms now
[1:30:14] david made this remark he said i
[1:30:16] considered the green bay tree
[1:30:18] he said i looked at man how that he
[1:30:20] prospered and the wicked how they come
[1:30:22] up and made money and they had houses
[1:30:23] and riches and popularities and things
[1:30:25] he said but as i considered this tree
[1:30:28] and all of its beauty and all of its
[1:30:29] strength and all of its glory eventually
[1:30:32] it died
[1:30:33] and it withered away and became nothing
[1:30:35] you see when we look at other people's
[1:30:37] lives and we judge ourself by them
[1:30:40] amen the apostle paul said we're unwise
[1:30:42] doing that he said they were unwise in
[1:30:44] his day when they measured themselves
[1:30:46] against themselves
[1:30:48] because you see no man can add one cubic
[1:30:51] to his stature just by positive
[1:30:52] affirmation positive thinking he can't
[1:30:55] add one
[1:30:56] a cubit uh one hair to his head or less
[1:30:59] believe me if you could add hair to your
[1:31:00] head amen i'd sit in a dark room for six
[1:31:03] days and do nothing but think about a
[1:31:04] full beautiful head of hair
[1:31:06] hallelujah are with me now what i'm
[1:31:08] trying to tell you is that the destiny
[1:31:10] of a human being is in the hands of god
[1:31:13] you say what's this got to do with the
[1:31:14] earnest money what i'm trying to say to
[1:31:16] you is that the promise of the
[1:31:18] inheritance of the saints of god amen is
[1:31:20] out of my control from the moment i took
[1:31:22] the breath of life and all i can do is
[1:31:25] surrender surrender surrender surrender
[1:31:27] amen and let jesus have control of every
[1:31:30] area of my life and every spot amen and
[1:31:33] keep walking in that willingness and
[1:31:35] that submission until the redemption of
[1:31:38] the purchase praise
[1:31:40] of his glory and the purchase possession
[1:31:43] notice paul said christ hath furnished
[1:31:46] us let me stop here a moment
[1:31:49] in other words what i'm trying to show
[1:31:51] you i'm paralleling i'm doing what they
[1:31:52] call in school a compare and contrast
[1:31:55] i'm trying to contrast for you our
[1:31:57] abilities versus god's ability but now i
[1:32:00] want to compare to you what god's put in
[1:32:02] man now let me read just a couple
[1:32:03] statements from the prophet of god first
[1:32:05] i want to quote to you amen from the
[1:32:07] patmos vision brother man said a man
[1:32:08] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[1:32:10] now wait he didn't say a man was
[1:32:12] omnipotent he said a man fully
[1:32:14] surrendered to god was omnipotent
[1:32:17] it doesn't mean that if you're just a
[1:32:18] man that you're omnipotent like i said
[1:32:20] devil worship that's the idea behind
[1:32:22] satanism i don't encourage you to read
[1:32:24] just read the satanic bible but as a
[1:32:27] minister i've read them all from the
[1:32:28] quran to you name them amen when i was
[1:32:30] in africa some years ago i had it on my
[1:32:32] kindle i went through the satanic bible
[1:32:34] a preacher said to me my god what's the
[1:32:36] matter with your brain i said you got to
[1:32:38] know how your enemy punches if you want
[1:32:39] to punch back
[1:32:41] amen so i don't encourage it i not you
[1:32:43] know maybe too much for you but as a
[1:32:46] preacher you study things that other
[1:32:47] people may not touch but i was i was
[1:32:50] absolutely dumbfounded to see the
[1:32:52] principle of it was empowerment
[1:32:54] self-empowerment self-empowerment i'm
[1:32:56] gonna say something to you i hope you
[1:32:57] catch me but that's exactly a lot of
[1:32:59] these self-help books that you see and
[1:33:01] all these empowerment books you see
[1:33:03] brother it's the very principles of
[1:33:05] satanism hiding in a very pretty cover
[1:33:09] man cannot empower himself this is what
[1:33:11] i'm trying to tell you this is why that
[1:33:13] i read to you these two greek words and
[1:33:14] their definitions amen that if the
[1:33:16] earnest of the holy spirit is christ's
[1:33:18] portion placed inside of you and that
[1:33:21] portion placed inside of you is christ
[1:33:24] doing the furnishing christ doing the
[1:33:26] equipping christ doing the anointing
[1:33:28] amen christ
[1:33:32] can you ready to complete your job amen
[1:33:34] then you have nothing in it
[1:33:37] it's not you or your education right or
[1:33:40] how much you might do in school or how
[1:33:42] much you might do in a trade how much
[1:33:43] plumbing you've learned or how many
[1:33:44] carpentry uh skills you might acquire
[1:33:47] none of that has spiritual value to the
[1:33:50] son of god or a daughter of god
[1:33:52] amen it might help you get you a job it
[1:33:53] might help pay your life bill but it
[1:33:54] ain't got nothing to do with your soul
[1:33:56] amen these things are just tools that we
[1:33:58] use to get along in life
[1:34:00] as the scripture tells us that if a man
[1:34:02] won't work and provide for his own he's
[1:34:04] worse than an infidel he's denied the
[1:34:06] faith
[1:34:07] amen the bible said you don't eat
[1:34:09] because you're not working
[1:34:11] so if you want to eat make sure you work
[1:34:13] right christians aren't lazy people they
[1:34:15] don't sit around their feet up on a
[1:34:16] barca lounge or eating bon bons and
[1:34:18] binging netflix amen christians are
[1:34:20] people that are ambitious and studious
[1:34:23] and thinking about how can i fulfill the
[1:34:25] father's work what can i do for my
[1:34:27] family for my wife my husband my
[1:34:29] children my whatever amen and if there's
[1:34:31] no children maybe mom is still alive
[1:34:33] maybe dad is still alive maybe
[1:34:35] grandparents are still alive and in your
[1:34:37] mind you're thinking to yourself amen
[1:34:39] how can i be a testimony of the glory of
[1:34:41] god amen for those that i love and those
[1:34:44] that love me
[1:34:46] what i'm trying to show you is that when
[1:34:48] he says couturio the lord hath carrillo
[1:34:50] or anointed me
[1:34:52] jesus is not referring back to a time in
[1:34:55] in other words he's not speaking of a
[1:34:57] time when he decided to become god
[1:35:01] now listen i'm going to give you a
[1:35:02] little godhead here for just a moment
[1:35:04] amen i know it's one of brother jesse's
[1:35:05] favorite subjects it's one of my
[1:35:07] favorite subjects amen and him and i
[1:35:09] we've been up down that ladder so many
[1:35:10] times the rungs are all worn out going
[1:35:12] up down to godhead but let's not forget
[1:35:14] that jesus was not born the holy ghost
[1:35:17] he was born a man he was born of the
[1:35:20] holy ghost but he was not born the holy
[1:35:22] ghost the holy ghost is a spirit and a
[1:35:24] spirit can't bleed a spirit can't die a
[1:35:26] spirit can't feel pain a spirit can't be
[1:35:28] tortured amen but he was born of the
[1:35:30] holy ghost if you look at the scripture
[1:35:32] it said jesus was conceived of the holy
[1:35:36] ghost in other words jesus was the body
[1:35:38] or the temple that god created in order
[1:35:42] to place his life in so that he could
[1:35:45] express himself to humanity and we know
[1:35:47] that it was a bridge we know that it was
[1:35:49] a bridging of the chasm that adam could
[1:35:51] not cross back over to god amen so this
[1:35:54] body was created in a way it could put
[1:35:56] one hand on a sinful man and one hand on
[1:35:58] a holy god and bridge both of them
[1:36:00] together again
[1:36:02] hallelujah that's sadly what he did
[1:36:04] that's exactly what his mission was
[1:36:07] amen jesus's job was not to come down
[1:36:10] for three and a half years and open the
[1:36:12] seals
[1:36:13] no
[1:36:14] his job wasn't to come down here amen
[1:36:17] and expose the white horse rider
[1:36:19] amen jesus's mission was not to come and
[1:36:22] explain to us the vials of the trumpets
[1:36:24] nor was it his job to place the church
[1:36:26] in order
[1:36:27] amen jesus come to seek and save that
[1:36:30] which was lost and to give his life for
[1:36:32] propitiation amen i'm happy to say i
[1:36:34] believe he done the very thing god
[1:36:36] called him to do
[1:36:39] but now remember during the period of
[1:36:42] his life leading up luke 2 52 amen he
[1:36:45] grew in wisdom before god and man
[1:36:49] so jesus was not born a person with the
[1:36:52] holy ghost either
[1:36:54] he was born of the holy ghost but not
[1:36:56] born with the holy ghost now listen
[1:36:58] carefully
[1:36:59] jesus you'll never find one scripture in
[1:37:02] the bible where jesus raised the dead
[1:37:05] cast out devils or healed lepers prior
[1:37:07] to the river jordan
[1:37:09] i know this disturbs people brother
[1:37:10] jesse i had a i had a good friend of
[1:37:12] mine tear me all to pieces the other day
[1:37:14] about this godhead teaching you mean to
[1:37:16] tell me you believe that jesus received
[1:37:18] the holy ghost of jordan that's what the
[1:37:20] bible said
[1:37:21] amen there's not another scripture in
[1:37:23] the bible that you'll ever find that
[1:37:25] said jesus full of the holy ghost until
[1:37:27] he goes into the wilderness coming from
[1:37:28] jordan amen to be tempted of the devil
[1:37:30] never any other place does he ever even
[1:37:33] speak that way
[1:37:35] amen and what it was is jesus was not
[1:37:37] going to the river amen because he was a
[1:37:40] sinner who needed to get saved
[1:37:42] he wasn't going down there because he
[1:37:44] was some kind of a you know the dreg of
[1:37:46] society and he needed to discover
[1:37:48] himself and find his true purpose no
[1:37:51] when he was 12 years old the revelation
[1:37:53] was clear when he tells mary i must be
[1:37:56] about my father's business that wasn't
[1:37:58] making tables and making you know
[1:38:00] and working with wood tools and things
[1:38:02] like that and then he was talking about
[1:38:04] his father god amen the kingdom of god
[1:38:07] fulfilling that which was caught amen
[1:38:09] into his hand
[1:38:11] let's not forget that when jesus comes
[1:38:14] into his ministry at 30 years old it was
[1:38:16] the same
[1:38:17] birth year the same uh uh
[1:38:19] uh uh age
[1:38:21] uh a requirement and the same uh status
[1:38:24] of age i'm trying to say as it was when
[1:38:26] a priest would enter into the ministry
[1:38:28] amen at 30 years old
[1:38:32] just like jesus amen a priest like aaron
[1:38:34] of them could enter into the priesthood
[1:38:36] at 30 years old 30 years old jesus comes
[1:38:38] down to the river amen and he speaks to
[1:38:40] john amen and john and jesus were
[1:38:43] cousins by the natural birth they might
[1:38:45] have played together
[1:38:47] fought the sandbox together over the
[1:38:48] same tonka trunk amen but when that
[1:38:51] light of the holy spirit followed jesus
[1:38:53] down to the riverbank amen john forgot
[1:38:55] about all of them old years amen about
[1:38:57] all of that familiarity said behold the
[1:38:59] lamb of god who takes away the sins of
[1:39:02] the world
[1:39:04] amen and when jesus comes and receives
[1:39:06] the holy spirit remember he received it
[1:39:08] without measure let me give you a word
[1:39:10] picture the word we use for emptied
[1:39:13] himself god emptied himself in it's not
[1:39:15] like i take this bottle right here and
[1:39:18] empty it into another thing the bottle
[1:39:19] remains the label remains the cap
[1:39:21] remains that little seal around there
[1:39:23] remains amen the chemicals of the bottle
[1:39:25] remain but when the holy spirit moved
[1:39:27] into jesus
[1:39:29] cap
[1:39:30] that little ring whatever you call that
[1:39:32] little seal thing there amen this the
[1:39:34] chemicals the bottle the water
[1:39:36] everything moved into that temple of god
[1:39:38] there was nothing left on this side it
[1:39:40] all moved and housed itself into the
[1:39:42] holy spirit into the holy spirit into
[1:39:45] the form of jesus christ
[1:39:47] all right you say what was he doing all
[1:39:48] right watch him now luke 4 18.
[1:39:51] now jesus coming from the river jordan
[1:39:53] he's been 40 days tempted of the devil
[1:39:55] now he walks smack into the temple sits
[1:39:57] right down in front of him
[1:39:59] the bible said he opened the scroll open
[1:40:01] the book listen that wasn't an easy
[1:40:04] thing
[1:40:05] the scroll of isaiah alone is about that
[1:40:07] thick around amen was so many chapters
[1:40:10] jesus would have had to take time and
[1:40:12] roll that all the way out
[1:40:14] in order to come to the place there
[1:40:16] where isaiah said he hath anointed me
[1:40:18] lord has anointed me to preach the
[1:40:20] gospel but then look at the word that
[1:40:22] jesus uses he hath anointed me or in
[1:40:25] other words could rio he hath equipped
[1:40:27] me
[1:40:28] he hath furnished me
[1:40:31] with the ability to do that which i am
[1:40:33] administered to do and to complete my
[1:40:35] administration and part of that was to
[1:40:37] preach the gospel to the poor
[1:40:40] you see there's a lot of preachers today
[1:40:41] that don't want to do that part
[1:40:44] amen when they preach the gospel they
[1:40:46] want to preach the gospel to the rich
[1:40:48] because that's where the money's at
[1:40:51] hello somebody preach to me now amen
[1:40:53] they're not interested in preaching for
[1:40:55] the help of the people amen they got a
[1:40:57] different idea in that hallelujah he has
[1:40:59] sent me to heal the brokenhearted you
[1:41:01] see many ministries today want to preach
[1:41:03] to those that are already fixed because
[1:41:05] that's an easier church to work with
[1:41:07] amen i strongly disagree with that those
[1:41:09] that think they are fixed are the
[1:41:10] hardest ones to deal with
[1:41:12] because you spend all your time showing
[1:41:14] them how broken they are
[1:41:15] amen and you got to get ugly with that
[1:41:17] sometimes too amen i know we don't think
[1:41:19] preachers ought to be ugly but hey
[1:41:21] listen you had a school teacher
[1:41:23] amen no offense brother jesse's sister
[1:41:25] sam but you had a school teacher that
[1:41:27] probably yelled at you and told you to
[1:41:28] sit down and be quiet amen preacher's
[1:41:30] got to do the same thing sometimes
[1:41:32] amen you get all excited thinking i can
[1:41:34] do something and then we got to set you
[1:41:36] down and tell you you can't do nothing
[1:41:38] amen i can do all things through christ
[1:41:40] not myself but through christ which
[1:41:42] strengthens me are you with me say amen
[1:41:45] amen now follow my thoughts now jesus
[1:41:47] being furnished now what do you do when
[1:41:49] you go into a house and you furnish your
[1:41:50] house amen you might have empty four
[1:41:52] walls like this but then you put in a
[1:41:54] toilet amen you put it in a sink you put
[1:41:57] in a vanity hallelujah put in uh a soap
[1:41:59] and soap dishes and you go through the
[1:42:01] house and put in all all of the uh
[1:42:04] towels and the uh
[1:42:06] and the sofas and everything what are
[1:42:08] you doing you're furnishing the house to
[1:42:10] live in it you're getting it in a
[1:42:11] condition where you can walk in at the
[1:42:13] end of a hard day at work amen and kick
[1:42:15] your shoes off at the door and sit down
[1:42:18] in your barcalounger and pull the handle
[1:42:19] back amen and snooze for a little while
[1:42:22] pay homage to amorphous that's the god
[1:42:23] of sleep if you didn't know what i'm
[1:42:24] talking about
[1:42:26] amen where you can relax and rest
[1:42:28] yourself for a little while amen and
[1:42:30] enjoy yourself hallelujah you go into
[1:42:32] the place amen and set down in a
[1:42:35] furnished place how comfortable how nice
[1:42:38] it is how welcoming and warm it is and
[1:42:40] inviting it is to walk into a fully
[1:42:42] furnished house why do you think they
[1:42:44] stage them before they sell them
[1:42:46] amen they want you to go in and look at
[1:42:48] that house with them pretty lights
[1:42:50] hanging over there and that certain
[1:42:51] certain thing in the corner and that
[1:42:52] deal on the table and that certain
[1:42:54] little doily hanging off the side of a
[1:42:56] cabinet amen they don't want you to walk
[1:42:58] in and look at four gray walls and
[1:43:00] nothing on the floor they want you to
[1:43:02] picture yourself at the end of the day
[1:43:04] amen in that in that bathtub calgon take
[1:43:06] me away
[1:43:08] amen they want you to picture yourself
[1:43:10] there so they furnish the home amen to
[1:43:13] equip it for the purpose of selling it
[1:43:16] well my brother sister that's exactly
[1:43:18] what the holy spirit has done for you
[1:43:20] and i amen before we started our earthly
[1:43:23] journey he had an inheritance laid up
[1:43:25] for us
[1:43:27] now listen close jesus never came to
[1:43:30] give us
[1:43:33] our inheritance
[1:43:34] no he never
[1:43:36] jesus never came to give us our
[1:43:37] inheritance he didn't he came to
[1:43:39] purchase
[1:43:40] that which had been given before there
[1:43:42] was a son a moon a star or anything else
[1:43:44] you'll find that in the adoption of your
[1:43:46] questioning
[1:43:47] he never come to give us the inheritance
[1:43:49] that was something according to the
[1:43:51] bible how could jesus give you something
[1:43:53] that was already given to you
[1:43:55] those things were already laid in the
[1:43:57] mind of god before the foundation of the
[1:44:00] world read ephesians 1.
[1:44:02] he said without him was not anything
[1:44:04] made that was made going to colossians
[1:44:06] as well amen those things if you connect
[1:44:08] them together you'll find out that
[1:44:09] everything that was ever created god
[1:44:12] created it and everything that would
[1:44:13] ever be given to you was already ready
[1:44:15] for you then amen
[1:44:17] now mind you that clock's going to
[1:44:18] preach a lot faster than i am and i
[1:44:20] won't be able to get it all in again
[1:44:21] you'll have to do your homework on this
[1:44:23] but if you study them deeply you'll find
[1:44:25] out jesus never come to give you an
[1:44:27] inheritance he come to purchase it
[1:44:29] there was a lien placed against your
[1:44:32] inheritance
[1:44:33] because of your first birth and how you
[1:44:35] were born there's no way that man could
[1:44:37] inherit god's blessings
[1:44:40] now listen to me it's impossible
[1:44:43] for you
[1:44:44] to be a recipient of god's blessings of
[1:44:46] your own accord
[1:44:47] you can't do it
[1:44:49] that's why a lot of the prosperity
[1:44:50] preaching and the uh the type of
[1:44:52] preaching we hear today in the
[1:44:53] charismatic world and the denominational
[1:44:55] world and
[1:44:56] organizations of light even independence
[1:44:59] and things will teach the people that if
[1:45:00] you're positive you know old smiley
[1:45:02] osteen i love joel
[1:45:04] this is my bible it is who i say i am
[1:45:06] and so forth like that i like joel i
[1:45:08] think he's a nice man and i would
[1:45:10] certainly like to sit down and have
[1:45:11] coffee with him one day and talk some
[1:45:12] things over
[1:45:14] but let me tell you something as much as
[1:45:15] the positive message is appealing to a
[1:45:18] crowd that can fill up a stadium like
[1:45:20] church it's not reality in the powers of
[1:45:22] the holy spirit
[1:45:23] it's not reality brother it's not a rea
[1:45:25] a real thing amen to listen at a
[1:45:27] self-help book and hear it tell you that
[1:45:30] if you're just a little bit more
[1:45:31] positive that you'll have a better life
[1:45:32] let me tell you something if a man is
[1:45:34] running from the presence of the lord he
[1:45:36] could be in the presence of every
[1:45:38] positive speaker and keynote positive
[1:45:40] man and woman on the face of the planet
[1:45:42] he could listen to every ted talk in the
[1:45:43] world he could speak nothing but
[1:45:45] positivity every day of his life but if
[1:45:47] his soul is running from god he's the
[1:45:49] most measurable person on the face of
[1:45:51] the planet
[1:45:53] my bible tells me amen and that's more
[1:45:56] than the rest of them whether it be
[1:45:57] maxwell or whoever the speaker might be
[1:45:59] my bible tells me the way of a
[1:46:01] transgressor's heart
[1:46:03] amen this is why a man will put his gun
[1:46:05] in his mouth and blow his brains into
[1:46:07] the next world having 65 billion dollars
[1:46:10] in the bank he might have the money in
[1:46:12] the bank but it has no deposit in his
[1:46:14] soul to give him peace
[1:46:16] hallelujah forgive my bluntness i know
[1:46:18] we've got young ones here but amen this
[1:46:20] is the realities of life we cannot be in
[1:46:23] a position to think we have control
[1:46:27] that's the failure of the church today
[1:46:29] amen the failure of message people and
[1:46:30] preachers alike today brother jesse amen
[1:46:33] we've got too much control over what it
[1:46:35] is that we call church
[1:46:38] let me explain something to you coming
[1:46:39] into the house of the lord this morning
[1:46:41] we dedicated this place to jesus christ
[1:46:43] didn't we
[1:46:44] amen the pews the walls everything has
[1:46:46] been given to him tomorrow they could
[1:46:48] come in here and run this as a tax place
[1:46:50] amen you could come here and do your
[1:46:51] taxes tomorrow afternoon but today the
[1:46:53] holy spirit has had a place of dedicated
[1:46:56] for his worship and his glory we come
[1:46:59] into this we call this the house of god
[1:47:01] that's true
[1:47:02] amen but when we come into this place
[1:47:04] and we dedicate it to his holy hands we
[1:47:07] are not saying to him that we are just
[1:47:09] tell you what to do when you arrive
[1:47:12] we commit and dedicate the place so he
[1:47:15] can tell us what he wants to do when he
[1:47:18] arrives
[1:47:20] this is why the bible said where two and
[1:47:22] three are gathered i'll be in the midst
[1:47:24] in other words if you're gathered in
[1:47:25] submission if you're gathered in and
[1:47:28] your response is this way lord we want
[1:47:30] you to come and we're gathering because
[1:47:32] you're the boss not me you the boss not
[1:47:36] me amen the attitude of the two or three
[1:47:38] are god you do the work and you do the
[1:47:40] business and you handle how you want us
[1:47:42] to do
[1:47:45] and yet and i don't mean to make you
[1:47:46] feel bad i don't thank you as contrary
[1:47:48] to brother jesse but just using this
[1:47:49] remark but sometimes when you hear like
[1:47:51] brother jesse when he was saying you
[1:47:53] know lord if it be a prophecy lord if it
[1:47:55] be a tongue lord if it be that people
[1:47:57] are critical sometimes not that you were
[1:47:59] but i mean in general they're critical
[1:48:01] when they hear ministers speak this
[1:48:02] matter they think ah
[1:48:04] something like that
[1:48:06] well the reason they feel that way is
[1:48:08] because when they walk through the door
[1:48:09] of the church and sit down they are
[1:48:11] still in charge but let me tell you
[1:48:13] something brother that the holy spirit
[1:48:15] will come and find just two or three in
[1:48:17] a church building hallelujah amen that
[1:48:19] surrendered and subjected to jesus
[1:48:21] christ amen where he can use my eyes use
[1:48:24] my mind use my mouth use my body use my
[1:48:28] spirit whatever he wants to use i'm at
[1:48:30] his
[1:48:32] and it can drop down and signs wonders
[1:48:35] miracles and prophecies
[1:48:37] you can heal the sick raise the dead do
[1:48:39] whatever he wants to let him just see
[1:48:40] just come in and paralyze us so we
[1:48:42] couldn't even speak
[1:48:43] amen we just sit and look amen at the
[1:48:45] all the presence of god he can do what
[1:48:46] he wants when he is in charge
[1:48:48] but if he is not in charge then we are
[1:48:50] fighting against the wind
[1:48:53] right because in our minds we think well
[1:48:55] i'll do this i'll do that i'll do this
[1:48:57] i'll do that even when we're trying to
[1:48:58] song lead i've been a song leader in my
[1:48:59] lifetime
[1:49:01] i think i'm going to sing this i'm going
[1:49:02] to sing this i'm going to sing this i'm
[1:49:03] going to play it this way and people are
[1:49:04] just going to rejoice and rejoice in
[1:49:06] joys the ones i think they'll shadow and
[1:49:08] they pout on
[1:49:09] the ones they pout on the ones they
[1:49:10] shout on or i thought they'd pout on
[1:49:12] amen i preached this sermon i'll say it
[1:49:14] this way and i'll crescendo this way
[1:49:16] i'll raise on my toes i'll look this way
[1:49:17] i'll gesture it doesn't work it doesn't
[1:49:20] matter i learned as a young preacher
[1:49:21] it's not about the dynamics of how you
[1:49:23] behave it's about following the
[1:49:25] leadership of the holy spirit
[1:49:28] amen this is what the prophet called
[1:49:30] hollywood evangelism
[1:49:32] amen the idea behind hollywood
[1:49:34] evangelism is not a man that's got maybe
[1:49:35] a certain delivery but it's the idea
[1:49:38] that his something is what will stir the
[1:49:40] people
[1:49:41] that's hollywood evangelism amen that's
[1:49:44] why you hear preachers say if you come
[1:49:45] to church to hear me you're going to be
[1:49:46] a failure well that's true
[1:49:48] you don't come to the house of the lord
[1:49:49] to hear that man preach you might like
[1:49:51] his ministry you might like his delivery
[1:49:52] but you're there to hear what the holy
[1:49:54] spirit's got to say using his mouth to
[1:49:56] say it
[1:49:58] right that's why we believe in a
[1:49:59] five-fold ministry again if man is in
[1:50:01] control then tell me why the insane
[1:50:03] words are filled up why are there so
[1:50:04] many hospital patients laying in the bed
[1:50:07] dying of covet and and some of them
[1:50:10] hanging upside down on a hospital bed
[1:50:12] amen with a vent in their mouth and
[1:50:14] laying them upside down so all that
[1:50:15] mucus and thing can drain the other
[1:50:17] direction hoping they don't smother to
[1:50:19] death before another hour passes if man
[1:50:21] is so in control why can't he stop the
[1:50:23] pandemic
[1:50:24] you know what this pandemic has showed
[1:50:26] us how out of control and how
[1:50:28] less powerful and unpowerful and
[1:50:31] whatever else you want to say how
[1:50:32] completely helpless and hopeless we are
[1:50:35] without the grace of jesus christ in
[1:50:38] everything we do
[1:50:41] i want to share something with you he
[1:50:42] told me the other day
[1:50:44] i was thinking when this omicron come on
[1:50:45] i got discouraged brother jesse for a
[1:50:47] moment i heard him talking about the
[1:50:49] resurgence and how it was beginning to
[1:50:50] pick up momentum and i got discouraged
[1:50:52] and i said to myself oh god
[1:50:55] we have to live with another thing now
[1:50:57] now we have to live with this
[1:50:58] and it seemed like the holy spirit said
[1:51:00] to me but haven't we lived with cancer
[1:51:03] haven't we lived with diabetes
[1:51:05] haven't we been living with tuberculosis
[1:51:07] and whooping cough and sinus infections
[1:51:09] and the flu every year and haven't we
[1:51:12] been living with all of these dreaded
[1:51:13] diseases all along and i thought that's
[1:51:15] right lord and it seemed like he kept
[1:51:17] speaking to me it's like he come on the
[1:51:18] end of it and said but haven't you also
[1:51:20] been living with the holy spirit all
[1:51:21] this time
[1:51:22] [Applause]
[1:51:24] hallelujah and i got to thinking about
[1:51:26] that i thought that's right amen the
[1:51:28] bible said in him we move and live and
[1:51:30] have our being
[1:51:34] praise the lord it's not about whether
[1:51:35] we have to go through another strain of
[1:51:37] a virus it's whether we have faith in
[1:51:39] jesus christ to bring us out of the
[1:51:41] thing
[1:51:42] amen i was in the hospital in september
[1:51:45] i went in for seven days
[1:51:47] the last part of august i picked up the
[1:51:49] delta variant from my oldest daughter in
[1:51:51] school was i vaccinated yes had i had
[1:51:53] corona in february yes i did vaccinated
[1:51:56] march and april i was a breakthrough
[1:51:58] come august and by august i was
[1:52:01] uh i had my uh just the sinus the upper
[1:52:04] respiratory type thing i come to that
[1:52:06] first week of september where it dropped
[1:52:08] down into my lungs and with a matter of
[1:52:10] days my lungs were completely eat up
[1:52:12] with covet-based pneumonia i spent seven
[1:52:14] days in the hospital they packed me full
[1:52:17] of their uh their plasmas and their all
[1:52:19] of the antibiotic and those things like
[1:52:21] that and somebody said to me was you
[1:52:23] afraid when you went and i said no i
[1:52:24] wasn't
[1:52:25] and one guy said to me well you know you
[1:52:27] brag a lot about those kind of things
[1:52:29] i'm really not bragging about me i'm
[1:52:31] just telling you that the lord had given
[1:52:32] me peace before i went into the hospital
[1:52:34] that it would be all right that i
[1:52:36] wouldn't have to worry that i would come
[1:52:37] out with a thing and let me tell you
[1:52:38] something folks i ticked every box for
[1:52:40] not having to be able to stand here
[1:52:41] today as far as i was concerned i ticked
[1:52:45] every single box where i should be six
[1:52:47] foot under the ground somebody said they
[1:52:48] don't bury them six foot anymore brother
[1:52:50] ben is three foot i said anyway i'm
[1:52:51] under the ground either way amen but
[1:52:54] anyhow i knew in my spirit when i went
[1:52:56] in there something had said to me the
[1:52:58] lord had anointed my spirit to
[1:53:00] understand i would come out of this
[1:53:02] thing it would not be a sickness unto my
[1:53:04] death i knew that the holy spirit would
[1:53:06] deliver me at the end of the day from
[1:53:08] this from this horrible horrible disease
[1:53:10] that is that's swept the world and has
[1:53:12] taken so many people to the grave amen
[1:53:15] why did i know that not because i
[1:53:17] decided i'm gonna beat it amen not
[1:53:19] because i had grit and i decided like
[1:53:22] people with cancer i'm not gonna let
[1:53:23] cancer beat me let me tell you something
[1:53:25] brother when god pulls your when god
[1:53:28] pulls your card from the rack amen and
[1:53:30] it's your time to go you could be
[1:53:31] surrounded by the best doctors the best
[1:53:33] medicine and the most technological
[1:53:36] scientific minds in the world and still
[1:53:38] amen go to your way amen in the grave
[1:53:41] sign
[1:53:42] amen you take a man like bruce lee
[1:53:45] one of the most strongest fit put
[1:53:47] together
[1:53:48] amen as far as health goes an absolute
[1:53:50] picture of health took an aspirin one
[1:53:52] night and was dead within an hour
[1:53:54] amen his boy had the same condition amen
[1:53:57] what i'm trying to say is that you could
[1:53:58] have everything together everything
[1:54:01] laying the way you think it should be
[1:54:02] done
[1:54:03] and still
[1:54:05] never be able to control
[1:54:08] the true predestination of your life
[1:54:11] we make choices sometimes can i give you
[1:54:13] an example
[1:54:15] jonah had decided he wasn't going to
[1:54:17] preach in nineveh and jonah had decided
[1:54:20] he was going to run from the lord and
[1:54:22] jonah decided it was better for him not
[1:54:24] to go to the ninevites but it was better
[1:54:26] for jonah to go to tarshish and god had
[1:54:29] already prepared a fish a special fish
[1:54:32] that was jonas size swallowing
[1:54:35] and it was ready for jonah and whenever
[1:54:37] that fish amen come right around now and
[1:54:40] if you do the history on this
[1:54:42] you'll find out that from where he took
[1:54:44] that ship to tarshish way down there on
[1:54:47] the riverbank he went plumbed down
[1:54:48] toward galilee and he got on the
[1:54:50] riverbank where it was just a like a
[1:54:52] maritime type town amen and and nineveh
[1:54:55] was way up over on this side
[1:54:58] now we know according to history
[1:55:00] that it was the assyrian empire
[1:55:03] capital was nineveh and the assyrians
[1:55:06] and the jews had nothing but war all the
[1:55:09] time they hated one another despised one
[1:55:12] another now all of a sudden god speaks
[1:55:14] to jonah and tells jonah go up into
[1:55:16] nineveh and preach and tell them to
[1:55:18] repent could you imagine what kind of
[1:55:20] political
[1:55:22] fallout that would have created in
[1:55:23] jonah's home you know how people get
[1:55:25] over politics you know how sitting at
[1:55:27] the dinner table if somebody tells you
[1:55:29] they're going to vote for biden or for
[1:55:30] bush or for trump or for obama or
[1:55:32] whoever they're going to vote for it's
[1:55:34] almost world war iii don't worry about
[1:55:36] the nuclear bombs killing americans amen
[1:55:38] we're going to kill each other at the
[1:55:39] dinner table over who we vote for in the
[1:55:41] next election
[1:55:42] the fact of the matter is
[1:55:44] brother at the end of the day it would
[1:55:46] have been such a devastating thing to
[1:55:48] this man
[1:55:49] to admit to those jewish people that he
[1:55:52] was going to go help one of the greatest
[1:55:54] rivals that the jewish nation had ever
[1:55:57] come in contact with so he decided he
[1:56:00] was going to go to spain that's where
[1:56:01] tarshish was all the way 2 000 miles
[1:56:04] plumbed down to spain in order to get
[1:56:07] away from the presence of the lord now
[1:56:09] if you look at it on a map amen he
[1:56:11] started from the lower part of israel he
[1:56:14] started out this way and when that fish
[1:56:16] got him he took a great big hook and did
[1:56:18] a did a detour a a 360
[1:56:21] or a 180 come all the way around rather
[1:56:24] amen and and
[1:56:25] we call it a u-turn you know what i'm
[1:56:27] talking about a u-turn did a big u-turn
[1:56:29] like this right back to the riverbank
[1:56:31] and he had to walk four more days in the
[1:56:33] desert straight back into nineveh i bet
[1:56:35] that old boy did some thanking amen from
[1:56:37] the three days in the belly as well amen
[1:56:41] in a whale's belly belly's well you
[1:56:42] caught that one didn't you amen in the
[1:56:44] whale's belly hallelujah amen three days
[1:56:47] three nights amen and four days into
[1:56:49] nineveh amen and as he stomped into the
[1:56:51] city of nineveh i figured them seven
[1:56:54] church ages had done made jonah decide i
[1:56:56] better obey the holy spirit
[1:56:58] amen and when it comes to him preaching
[1:57:00] his message amen and telling the people
[1:57:02] to repent amen not only did they repent
[1:57:05] but then jonah gets mad about it
[1:57:08] god i told you i if i preached to him
[1:57:10] you'd save him and i didn't want him
[1:57:11] saved
[1:57:12] it goes to prove that even though with a
[1:57:14] discouraged temperamental prophet god
[1:57:17] still saw to it that his children would
[1:57:19] be taken care of amen sometimes it's not
[1:57:23] about the vessel god's using in their
[1:57:25] personal identities and their personal
[1:57:27] characters and their natures and their
[1:57:29] makeup it's about a man just willing to
[1:57:31] do what god called him to do
[1:57:33] amen sometimes we look at people and say
[1:57:35] i wish they'd be this way i wish they'd
[1:57:36] be this way i wish they'd be that way
[1:57:38] sure i wish some preachers and some men
[1:57:40] and women would behave differently as
[1:57:42] well but again a temperamental prophet
[1:57:44] preached repentance and everybody got
[1:57:46] saved
[1:57:47] amen he didn't even like it when god
[1:57:49] saved him he told the lord he fussed at
[1:57:51] the lord see i told you i told you the
[1:57:54] book of jonah closes out with jonah in a
[1:57:56] bad mood and the ninevite's still saved
[1:58:00] amen i hope you're understanding me
[1:58:01] about something amen the holy spirit
[1:58:03] doesn't look at our abilities or what we
[1:58:06] can offer when he gives us this earnest
[1:58:09] holy spirit he is the one that equips us
[1:58:12] and finished furnishes us rather and
[1:58:14] finishes yes he'll do that too but he
[1:58:16] furnishes us for the administration that
[1:58:19] we're called to
[1:58:20] now in closing i want to say one more
[1:58:22] thing to you if you think in your mind
[1:58:25] that you don't have the ability to do
[1:58:27] what god called you to do if you think
[1:58:29] that you're not qualified or that you
[1:58:31] don't have the strength or the stamina
[1:58:33] or the ability to do what god called you
[1:58:35] to do then you don't understand the holy
[1:58:37] spirit that's living inside of your
[1:58:39] heart
[1:58:40] amen and show us the father brother
[1:58:42] brahman in 1955 says amen i've got it
[1:58:45] laying here in the message that he says
[1:58:47] that it's like a seed remember david
[1:58:49] said you'd be like a tree planted by the
[1:58:51] rivers of water
[1:58:52] but see god didn't plant you like a tree
[1:58:54] meaning that you wasn't just like a
[1:58:56] great big grown tree but you're like a
[1:58:57] seed
[1:58:58] he plants and positionally places that
[1:59:00] seed where it belongs and that seed has
[1:59:02] the responsibility to drink and grow
[1:59:05] where god placed it
[1:59:07] that's my only job
[1:59:09] just let god place me
[1:59:10] and then just keep absorbing and
[1:59:12] drinking and bringing everything god
[1:59:13] says my way
[1:59:15] amen christianity is not hard it's just
[1:59:17] something people have made hard
[1:59:19] amen and then as he grew into the
[1:59:21] stature of what god foresaw he would be
[1:59:24] the prophet said like this he said every
[1:59:26] acorn it was in an acorn tree was
[1:59:28] already in it when it was a seed
[1:59:30] so when god gives you the holy spirit
[1:59:32] and he gives you the new birth and he
[1:59:33] makes you born again everything you have
[1:59:35] need of even your rapture resurrection
[1:59:37] is laying in you right now
[1:59:39] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:59:41] you're going to be able to do what god
[1:59:43] called you to do
[1:59:44] now the lord might lead you to go to
[1:59:46] school he might lead you to take up a
[1:59:48] trade he might lead you to read a
[1:59:49] certain book maybe a self-help book he
[1:59:51] might read you to get counseling he
[1:59:52] might lead you to take a medicine you
[1:59:54] might need something for adhd or for ocd
[1:59:58] or for odd or for
[2:00:02] h i j k l m l p
[2:00:05] you you might need something that's all
[2:00:07] right if the lord is leading you let the
[2:00:09] holy spirit lead you he knows that the
[2:00:11] the mess the conglomeration
[2:00:13] conglomeration that we've been left in
[2:00:15] this physical man sometimes we need
[2:00:17] things to help us along
[2:00:19] a man said to me the other day he said
[2:00:20] well brother ben he said why would you
[2:00:23] even tell people it's okay to take a
[2:00:24] medicine for attention deficit disorder
[2:00:27] and the man standing there looking at me
[2:00:28] had a pair of glasses on a hearing aid
[2:00:30] in and a brace on his left leg and i
[2:00:32] said brother
[2:00:33] heal thyself
[2:00:35] amen physician heal thyself first
[2:00:37] amen the point i'm making to us is that
[2:00:39] we need to understand that the holy
[2:00:41] ghost knows that we need temporary helps
[2:00:44] in this life amen so god will drop
[2:00:47] handfuls on purpose to encourage us and
[2:00:49] to strengthen us and it might be using
[2:00:51] the world oh don't forget amen the
[2:00:54] wealth of this wicked is laid up for the
[2:00:56] the of the wicked is laid up for the
[2:00:57] righteous
[2:00:59] amen every time donald trump drops
[2:01:01] another million dollars into his bank i
[2:01:02] mean he's doing that to help me in some
[2:01:04] way down the line
[2:01:06] that's right amen and don't fear amen
[2:01:09] already i've been praying for 15 years
[2:01:12] or about 10 years now i should say amen
[2:01:14] that god would help me find a way for
[2:01:15] the government to pay my student loans
[2:01:17] all of this talk you see on the
[2:01:18] television out of god you can thank me
[2:01:20] later amen i've been praying that the
[2:01:23] holy spirit amen would find a way for us
[2:01:25] to be able to cancel a lot of this debt
[2:01:27] and help us with some of these school
[2:01:29] loans and things i'm kidding you y'all
[2:01:31] let me let him be serious amen but now
[2:01:33] what i'm trying to say is that i believe
[2:01:35] amen that god uses these things yes he
[2:01:37] can use people amen through massage
[2:01:40] therapy if you've got a bad muscle or a
[2:01:42] doctor to help you with headache
[2:01:43] problems and things of that nature amen
[2:01:46] but don't think that your resources of
[2:01:48] life lay in the external they lay in the
[2:01:52] internal what god amen has already
[2:01:55] placed inside of you let me give you the
[2:01:58] holy ghost
[2:02:00] praise god
[2:02:02] in acts 10 38 the bible said god
[2:02:05] anointed carrillo furnished equipped
[2:02:08] jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost
[2:02:10] and with power
[2:02:12] it went about doing good healing all
[2:02:13] that were oppressed to the devil for god
[2:02:15] was with him
[2:02:16] this is why i could come along in saint
[2:02:18] john 2 19-21 and say if you destroy this
[2:02:21] temple in three days i'll raise it up
[2:02:23] again he knew he had the ability within
[2:02:26] himself to take control of death
[2:02:28] in his own mortal body he knew he was
[2:02:30] equipped to raise this body
[2:02:34] i am equipped to do the same thing
[2:02:36] i could say the very same thing destroy
[2:02:38] this body let me die in a car right let
[2:02:40] let some disease hit me give me a little
[2:02:43] time when rapture time comes i'll take
[2:02:45] that same holy ghost life and raise this
[2:02:47] body back up out of the grave
[2:02:49] yes sir it will be the bride speaking
[2:02:51] the resurrection it'll be the bride of
[2:02:54] jesus christ speaking that voice of the
[2:02:56] resurrection oh you say that's jesus yes
[2:02:58] but i'll remind you paul said christ is
[2:03:00] in you
[2:03:02] the hope of glory he has no voice but
[2:03:03] your voice no hands but your hands amen
[2:03:05] are to be you speaking resurrection
[2:03:08] oh you say how can that be glad you
[2:03:09] asked me i'm going to tell you
[2:03:11] the reason the brine speaks resurrection
[2:03:14] it's not because she has the ability to
[2:03:16] look at death and say death i'm better
[2:03:18] than you
[2:03:19] actually when it comes to dying or the
[2:03:21] way that we die
[2:03:22] we get it in our mind that somehow
[2:03:25] humiliating deaths and things are
[2:03:26] beneath us
[2:03:28] we look at brother branham the way that
[2:03:30] god took brother branham off the scene
[2:03:31] great mighty supernatural works and
[2:03:34] things was done in this prophet's life
[2:03:35] and a drunk driver hit him on the road
[2:03:37] and he finally died of his injuries
[2:03:39] succumb to his injuries some weeks later
[2:03:41] and when you tell people about the
[2:03:42] message of the iron what god done
[2:03:44] through that mighty man of god amen they
[2:03:45] ask you how you die it's embarrassing
[2:03:47] but remember it wasn't beneath brother
[2:03:49] branham to die amen as an immortal human
[2:03:52] being would die as a mortal human being
[2:03:54] but don't forget the very message that
[2:03:57] is spoken out of our mouth amen we'll
[2:03:59] meet it one day and that very positivity
[2:04:02] of jesus christ will meet this body when
[2:04:04] it comes time amen and when he sounds
[2:04:06] from heaven the voice of the
[2:04:07] resurrection my voice will already be
[2:04:09] here to meet it hallelujah amen it'll be
[2:04:11] a deep calleth to the deep amen one
[2:04:13] magnet will pull to the magnetization
[2:04:15] it'll pull it right out of the ground
[2:04:17] amen and bring forth the resurrection
[2:04:20] if you can receive it you're speaking it
[2:04:21] right now
[2:04:23] but you're not speaking your own words
[2:04:24] you're taking his powerful anointed
[2:04:27] creative supernatural omnipotent words
[2:04:31] and you're speaking those words
[2:04:34] and one day your body will catch up
[2:04:36] with the thing that you've been speaking
[2:04:38] last thing we're gonna go amen the bible
[2:04:41] said isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[2:04:44] first of all joseph was not the father
[2:04:46] mary was not the mother she was a mother
[2:04:48] to jesus but not the mother of jesus
[2:04:52] they said well
[2:04:54] some man said to me well you know
[2:04:56] how did jesus get his humanity i said he
[2:04:58] got it from the same place adam did
[2:05:02] adam didn't need a father a mother god
[2:05:03] was enough
[2:05:05] amen god gave him his humanity that's
[2:05:07] how he got it in the first place
[2:05:09] but jesus being virgin born meant that
[2:05:11] his blood
[2:05:12] was not mixed with the tree of knowledge
[2:05:14] of good and evil
[2:05:16] his blood was a direct creation from the
[2:05:18] tree of life all right now listen we're
[2:05:20] going to go when jesus absolutely was
[2:05:23] getting ready to be conceived
[2:05:26] mary had no idea that she was that mary
[2:05:29] the words have been spoken brother
[2:05:31] brahman said let's imagine isaiah might
[2:05:33] have got a little embarrassed when he
[2:05:34] said these words not knowing what he was
[2:05:36] even saying a virgin shall conceive he's
[2:05:38] a grown man probably had a family or
[2:05:40] something else or at least seen people
[2:05:41] with families
[2:05:42] he knew how children got here he knew
[2:05:44] virgins can't conceive
[2:05:46] he might have got embarrassed maybe he
[2:05:47] spent the rest of his life thanking lord
[2:05:49] i must have missed that how but i know
[2:05:50] that was you i know you spoke but how
[2:05:52] how 700 years that question hung in the
[2:05:55] air went around the earth and around the
[2:05:57] earth and around the earth and all of
[2:05:59] those scriptures about messiah were
[2:06:01] circling around the earth around the
[2:06:03] earth and one day a girl about 16 years
[2:06:05] old will say
[2:06:07] he was walking up a dusty road day and a
[2:06:09] man stepped out of nowhere and said mary
[2:06:11] hail
[2:06:12] blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[2:06:16] oh for that which is conceived as of the
[2:06:18] holy ghost what i'm trying to tell you
[2:06:20] is that our full inheritance is laying
[2:06:22] out there it's been spoken and it goes
[2:06:24] around and around and around and what
[2:06:26] we're doing is we are echoing what down
[2:06:28] here what's been spoken up there and one
[2:06:30] day it will match
[2:06:32] when that positive negative comes
[2:06:34] together then i'll just if i'm laying in
[2:06:36] the ground i'll just
[2:06:40] because see christians don't die they
[2:06:42] fall asleep
[2:06:46] glory to god
[2:06:48] right whatever age i fell asleep in i'll
[2:06:51] just wake up at the sound of the
[2:06:53] savior's voice
[2:06:55] amen but it's his voice but it's my
[2:06:57] voice yes if i want to know what god
[2:06:59] hath called me to do i just go to the
[2:07:02] man that called me and say what do you
[2:07:03] want me to do
[2:07:05] if i'm working a job and i don't know
[2:07:07] what job i'm supposed to do i go to the
[2:07:08] man that hired me and i say tell me what
[2:07:10] is it you want me to do we do the same
[2:07:12] thing we go to him and say lord what is
[2:07:14] my calling what is the position what do
[2:07:16] you want me to do listen to this the
[2:07:17] prophet said your body is not yet
[2:07:19] redeemed
[2:07:21] no matter how good how saintly or how
[2:07:23] holy or how much holy spirit that's only
[2:07:25] your soul and your soul is not completed
[2:07:27] yet
[2:07:28] it's just got the blessing the promise
[2:07:30] of god the earnest
[2:07:32] of our salvation
[2:07:34] i think we know what earnest money is
[2:07:35] but just in case you don't earnest money
[2:07:37] let's say you owe a hundred dollars
[2:07:39] earnest money might be ten dollars of
[2:07:41] that hundred dollars
[2:07:42] so the down payment that christ gave to
[2:07:44] us and our soul is only a down payment
[2:07:47] there's more to come down the road
[2:07:48] there's more that he's going to unfold
[2:07:50] to us and more that he's going to lay in
[2:07:52] our lap but listen carefully he doesn't
[2:07:54] give us the full inheritance right now
[2:07:56] because we don't need it right now
[2:07:59] let me say that again he doesn't give us
[2:08:01] the full inheritance right now because
[2:08:02] we don't need it right now
[2:08:04] he furnishes us and equips us with what
[2:08:06] exactly we have need of until it's time
[2:08:09] to go
[2:08:10] we go out of here the rest of it will
[2:08:12] come
[2:08:13] so if there are things in your life you
[2:08:15] feel like you're lacking if there's
[2:08:17] things in your life you feel like you
[2:08:18] ain't there yet if there's spots in your
[2:08:20] life where you feel like i'm just not
[2:08:22] getting to the place i need to get to
[2:08:24] don't worry that's natural that's normal
[2:08:27] every christian feels a
[2:08:30] way because we've only got a down
[2:08:32] payment we don't have the full
[2:08:33] inheritance we always feel like we're
[2:08:34] missing something and we will until our
[2:08:36] bodies change
[2:08:38] even those beyond the curtain of time
[2:08:40] listen out their words he said will
[2:08:42] paul's group be there yes he said then i
[2:08:44] preached exactly the same thing that
[2:08:46] paul preached listen to their words
[2:08:48] that's right we're resting upon that
[2:08:51] and when jesus comes he'll come to you
[2:08:53] and when he does we'll come back to the
[2:08:55] earth with you amen and stand and be
[2:08:57] judged and so on and so forth and he
[2:08:59] asked them do you eat here no do you
[2:09:01] sleep here no even those that have gone
[2:09:03] beyond the curtain of time standing in
[2:09:05] another dimension it's just another room
[2:09:07] like we're standing here like this right
[2:09:09] now if you didn't know what was behind
[2:09:10] that door there could be all kinds of
[2:09:12] people in there playing bunko and
[2:09:14] card games and video games could be all
[2:09:16] doing all kinds of stuff if it was a
[2:09:17] soundproof room you wouldn't know what
[2:09:18] they were doing amen all of a sudden you
[2:09:20] pop the door open there's all this
[2:09:22] activity and things going on and you
[2:09:24] think well what in the world was y'all
[2:09:25] doing here this whole time that's the
[2:09:26] way that other dimension is it's just
[2:09:28] another room beyond us we can't see it
[2:09:30] but there's activity going on all the
[2:09:32] time amen there's rolling fields of
[2:09:34] bluegrass there's women and saints and
[2:09:36] man amen running up and down screaming
[2:09:38] and hugging and crying every time a
[2:09:40] saint goes into the crosses that veil
[2:09:42] amen there's rejoicing from the angels
[2:09:44] of god amen there's powers heaven is a
[2:09:46] beehive of activity amen it's a
[2:09:48] metropolis of activity but it's just
[2:09:50] another room beyond us
[2:09:53] amen but one day
[2:09:55] my body is going to catch up with that
[2:09:57] rhythm
[2:09:58] my soul and my body is going to catch up
[2:10:00] with that rhythm and i'm going to step
[2:10:02] i'm going to be able to grab the door
[2:10:04] and just go
[2:10:05] and step into that place
[2:10:07] amen but one day that which i am lacking
[2:10:10] will be given to me
[2:10:12] amen closing
[2:10:14] amen preachers are liars i've said that
[2:10:16] four times
[2:10:18] hallelujah one one more place so i got
[2:10:20] to get this in amen in the message
[2:10:22] jehovah jairo the prophet said that's
[2:10:23] right he said you're looking at things
[2:10:26] today he said but listen and i'm
[2:10:27] paraphrasing now he said if there's no
[2:10:29] joy here he said then there'll be no joy
[2:10:31] there
[2:10:32] he said there's no love here there'll be
[2:10:34] no love there if there's no resurrection
[2:10:35] here there'll be no resurrection there
[2:10:37] so he said divine healing
[2:10:40] is a down payment of resurrection we
[2:10:42] know that god will change us
[2:10:44] and recreate these cells into the image
[2:10:47] of jesus christ take out all the sex
[2:10:49] glands take out all of the strains from
[2:10:51] your great-great-grandmother and
[2:10:52] grandfather you'll be more like the
[2:10:54] angels
[2:10:55] in other words you won't have to worry
[2:10:57] about propagating your own species amen
[2:11:00] we won't go to heaven amen and try to
[2:11:02] repopulate heaven amen with those in our
[2:11:05] own likeness
[2:11:06] amen we do that as fathers now our
[2:11:08] children are those that we propagate in
[2:11:10] our own likeness but when we go to
[2:11:12] heaven all of that tree of knowledge of
[2:11:13] good and evil be removed from our system
[2:11:15] think about it amen you might even still
[2:11:17] have the same nose but you won't have
[2:11:19] your daddy's temper
[2:11:22] you might have the same ears but you
[2:11:24] won't have your mama's impatience
[2:11:26] hallelujah all of that will be taken out
[2:11:28] of you
[2:11:30] amen you say why because that's the down
[2:11:33] payment that's the full inheritance
[2:11:34] that's everything he's come to give me
[2:11:36] is to change me in a moment
[2:11:38] and a twinkle of an eye let's sing
