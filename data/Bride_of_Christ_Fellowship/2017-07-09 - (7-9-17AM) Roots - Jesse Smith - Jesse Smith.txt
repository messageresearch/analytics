sinless finish that's where our promises were purchased Lord God gratefully walk into those promises years Lord upon this earth as we faithfully walk on their commands thank you than you has a limited offspring you'd be glory this morning in Jesus Christ Nick Scherr set in series our child that means you go pick up your sister between the services so just a few pictures of visual I don't have one here at quite a few visitors at my house the last employees but I have time to study but now they call this quote you gotta change the font change the size make everything fit so they can read it so our eyes are not straining but praise the Lord I'm so grateful for God's mercy so let's look at the thought of reach and I started studying up on roofs and I thought my there's so many different applications it's all trying to get to some of them I have at least four different applications you know I like to get to those but we ran out of text and I thought it'd be best to start without Jesus is the root and offspring of date amen on let's start there with with roots but I first like to define our natural roots and to see the spiritual truths there you know about maps that you can always understand the spiritual by looking at the natural so I went to Britannica you know I went to some different places to try to read about roots and so for like that so I want to look at roots now in botany this is the protective definition it's the part of the plant normally underground so it's snowing in the ground not all the time but most attack so it's something so we're look at that as a spiritual type roots are things that are not easily seen to the public right the things that are hidden from immediate view so we're looking at spiritual things and it says its primary function so it's the part of a plant whose primary functions are to Anchorage or its questions are Anchorage of the plans so a search that's an anchor like that if I was says we have a hope that anchors beyond the veil a bet I see you can see the spiritual type there so it's an underground part not easily seen invisible eyes you can't see my knickers in heaven this morning about me my god even in there not visibly seen its primary functions are Anchorage for the planet absorption of water and dissolved minerals since the second one absorbing the water absorbing the word or he's God all the spiritual mineral something that's not seen on the outside it's seen it's not seen on the outside that's underneath it's a hidden thing about Mary's message it's a hidden the life raised up that's why people can come to church and we can come to church and we can sit down read our Bibles we go in public and have a Bible study in the restaurant or something like that but we people could act like big receiving but that's not where it's actually seen us to serve it on the outside it's a hidden thing on the inside because the Pharisees were the church more than anybody and yet they get it receive the word of the out they weren't receiving the water right and we're receiving the minerals in crisis is his messengers were preaching to him so it's a hidden thing praise done now the third thing is conduction of the east to the stem so the roots you know given Anchorage and soar but the third thing is they're they're flus you know they're flus to pass the water minerals up to the standards the rest of the plant so science at least in this part of the cyclopædia says it has those three okay Walmart and in certain kind of routes in storage or of the reserve foods so it's a place you can store your reserves a man is that in the roots and it gives some examples there's two kinds of two kinds of roots at least I listed them I guess I didn't study you know for hours and hours and ever tip of class home roots or binding or anything that apology you know but this is what I found this out study there's fibrous roots and all the roots here come from the very base you know of the seed there right from the base but the taproot is the one that we just sometimes the root acts as a storage of food and minerals and we like those don't we we like carrots and all those different help tap root kind of plants because that's storing up good things Springs the mornin that's not on the visible eye it's hidden underneath pretty Scott and you got a root that out to get it the blessings of that so the root spiritually has different applications now we can see the Anchorage pretty easily brother branham said what does the wind send for anyhow why does God send the wind run Graham said to shake them trees every time you shake a tree it loosens up the roof and it causes it to grow deeper and deeper I run around lichens that a windstorm to the Holy Ghost he said every time the Holy Ghost falls on the church and an old-fashioned revival it shakes up the roots like this so it can go rooted and grounded ready for the storms and trials as they come upon the earth you see what I are in Bible is so important so your rooster goes deeper that you can handle the storms and they're coming amen so program likens win to the Holy Ghost amen coming and giving you a fresh new Bible and that's the loosen up the roots so they can go down a little bit further praise God so you can clearly see that that's when you heard preached many times and so I haven't really everywhere I go everywhere I've gone I've heard people precess I appreciate that I love that that's a great trip that's Anchorage that's one of the main functions of the roots is to anchor the plan in the right location amen I want to get down to another part of the route it says the primary route or the radical is the first organ to appear when a seed germinates so roots start with the radicals called the radical interstate radical and it says it grows downward in the soil you'll remember the diagrams I don't have it up here I wish you'll read our minds we're going to get down you also remember the diagram of the seat of the embryo and there's a little piece of the fruit that is first sticking out and as soon as water hits that that is the part that goes directly down into the water I'm talking talking to the ground rather and begin once water hits it it germinates the seed and it pushes the radical down and it begins anchoring the little seedling see and it says the radical and some of these plants becomes the taproom so this is what the taproot because this would be that very beginning of the radical like in the original seed and it says here that this part of the plant or this plant part of the root is very important now I've heard this preached before but I never studied it it was years ago but roots grow in length only from their eddies they only grow at the end of the roots right so all these parts up here are not growing the ends are growing so we see how the ends around here the ends down here the end is the only part that grows so it's the initial particle right I'm sorry radical it's that initial radical the radicals the only part that's growing there's only part of it that's really moving is that initial root or that initial member right the initial members that sound familiar like the Bible say we have to have our first love you must live by our first love see this room will only grow deeper bikes first love the very first love that it has going to push down and started growing down the ground and that first love that makes it grow deeper in the Word of God amen and deeper in Christ that's why we cannot live off of a past experience we cannot go further from God we can only grow in God when we get back to our first lab amen because it only grows from that radical which later has the term called the root cap so the very tip of the root is covered by a protective pimple shade root cap just behind the root cap lyza ethical meristem a tissue of actively dividing cells so I want to just get look at the picture there's another picture of a plan so we have the chute of the plant and the bud of your of course the leaves down here we have the roots and here's the root cap I got another picture on it I've shown just a moment so the root cap the root caps are very we say from the cutting edge of life and I see life that first love an initial love you have for Christ that's the cutting edge of growing as a Christian your first love and it cannot grow unless you have your first love but jesus said that himself right I'll say it the Bible to us jesus said until you get back to your first love the first worse you'll never grow as a Christian the roots can't grow deeper down into the things of God until you have your first love that radical we'd say or that root tap there cap week off sorry that's a good buddy terms mixed up now look to if I can read a quote from brother Branham on this from God's provided way of healing 1954 he makes his statement I want you to remember it how many remember when Jesus cursed the fig tree from that the Bible said he was walking by and he was hungry in Mark 11 12 and 14 and he came to a tree victory it wasn't the season for the picture to part the but God was but Christ not in Christ was wanting a fruit right and so Jesus cursed it he said these words he said no man eat of the fruit thereof Hereafter and the disciples heard of Peter hurt other side was hurt they're going to Jerusalem they come out and once they come out the Bible said Peter looks over and he sees it dry up from the roots so brother man picks us up and he says this statement he said Jesus said no fruit will go off growing and no man will eat from henceforth he said now how many knows that the tree has a germ of life everybody does if it didn't it would live now watch the tree died from where on them said the roots the Bible said it was withered from the roots now in the root was the trees life [Applause] boy I want to make that statement as you look at the natural the life actually of the tree or plant is in the roots and there's only one active life that's the life that's in the growing part of this plan is in that root cap its first love its initial its initial experience with the grounding men its initial experience with water hallelujah thank you Jesus hey man its initial experience that's my program said in what house will you build me 65 he said though I see everybody declining away from the spirit how I longed for revival my whole life I longed to have that feeling ahead when I first got saved amen and she just says seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added unto you hey my mind I said the root is in the tree slack because after Jesus cursed it they come back later and there's no I'm sorry the roots themselves were withering up because the life is in the roots how many understand that by God's grace let me give you a picture I think God for science because if I don't read the Britannica and try to give you a picture of this I never could've done it but look at this nice little picture here's the structure of rooms you have this is a very roof cap down here we're talking about the very bottom part of the roots and there's no meristem and there's the root hairs now Ruth Harris increase the surface area for water and mineral absorption did you know that a lot water comes through the root hairs if that root trims off its hairs and you can have any water like that see those sisters if our brothers and our sisters cut their hair they're dead they're not born again right like Samson and become his hair it broke the covenants so the plant gets water through the hairs amen everything the hair counts because it's pulling in the Word of God it's pulling in the light it's pulling in the nutrients that's right and the meristem is the region where the new cells are produced so right here so you have the cap that protects the growing room don't you love how God protects the part of you that's growing aren't you glad God protects the light thank you this is the part that's actually growing it's not actually the tip but it's right behind the tip it's got to have a nice Arrowhead right you've got a break screw to breakthroughs gotta have that sub the breakthrough but the real life is behind it ray stop amen and God has protection for the life aren't you glad that our life is protected our life is hid in Christ amen hallelujah Christ is our cap and that's what the Holy Ghost is the cash dome ring cap cap so baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it's Christ who protects our life amen beautifully met how do you and the root cap protects the tip of the growing root Sokratis Christ that protects our the growth in our life and that's our first love and that's Holy Ghost love me man that's your Holy Ghost up because that's the only thing that grows unless that's the Holy Spirit there your love for Jesus and it needs protected by the capstone amen it's protected by the cap and it has to throw and push down it's going to take in more water our minerals and then the life is protected it'll push down further in the crisis amen hope you like that by the grace okay I said Jesus didn't speak to the leaves neither did he speak to the branches but he spoke to the life amen no man eat from me hence all the days of your life now that there's an interesting type in there brother Graham said that there's two things I've ever said Jesus wanted to show the disciples how he had power over all nature that's why he cursed it see out of season right look I said he wanted to happen show the disciples the spoken word has power over all creation like squirrels right turns that's power over squirms that's power over storms that's how we were fish and apostles that get called back to life in their God Jesus wanted to show that the spoken word has power over all creation the second thing you can think out of that is that we must be instant in season and out of season and Jesus showing that every tree guy only brings forth his new season but it is showing that the real type is that men are trees and then be ready no matter if they say well I'm in the season of it or not they've got to be producing the life of God because the Bible said in Psalm chapter what a man that's really planted by the rivers of waters his fruit doesn't with her so someone who's really gonna baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit born again experience his fruit doesn't wither his knees doesn't wither he's ugly producing the fruit of the Holy Spirit exam yes it's hard times like brother Brandon that he has rough times but he's constantly putting fruit husband putting forth all the time why because he know his Lord is watching him and he wants to please his Lord no matter what stage Almighty's in Hey thank you mom so my map type sis he said the tree was left standing without lighting and they types that now would it be any harder for Jesus to speak to a cancer than it would be to a tree could Jesus lightness to speak into the light to speak in the life of a cancer speak into the light for whatever problem you have how many buddy there's power and speaking the Word of God and if you read this chapter mark 11 without time to David Jesus all the Jesus whole training is on this to show them the power of the spoken word to speak the word to your situation Alleluia now those years of mother have said he said Jesus not in a raised voice but just with real thing said no man even from you sometimes Jesus lifted his voice we do miracles remember last week he said the bowing lifted up his voice and said Lazarus come forth my brother and dramatized his faith can look in a few different ways can make you look really loud and really bald but prevents in this case Jesus just walked by and said with a not a raised voice he said but just with real faith no man is from the hereafter restock see for medicine before he would teach his disciples what he did it he must show them first who he was and that's what he still does today as I've said before when an occasion Rises that needs to be God called on the steam and the way God acts on that occasion if the same occasion would ever rise again God a sac the same way that he did first or he did not he did wrong when he acted the first time he said oh it seems to be such a hard thing for people to comprehend what faith is I mean when the comprehend what faith is it's just something inside of you that just believes the word it's a substance it's something that just has to take out of this word and what is faith it's an assurance it's an inside assurance that you know God will keep his word hey man how about a man said sometimes people have a hope that is a faith I've heard many people say oh I got a lot all fake but then they're standing in the prayer line if they had that type of faith they would not feed in the prayer life it's just an emotional faith now can I say like this when someone's at the Paramount here or at any church you have a measure of faith but you're recognizing you need more faith just my man said when you come up for prayer you're saying I went with your faith with the ministers thing my brother up said if you have perfect faith you don't even need to get the prayer line but it might be God's will though to bring you up to a prayer line because the Avenue might be the laying on of hands or might be the anointing of the oil or might be just speaking the word like we see with Jesus where you don't have to go to prayer line just speak the word God has all these channels for the supernatural all these channels for faith the thing to do is be in harmony with Christ amen and we can understand what basis so Jesus in this case courser the tree doesn't raise his voice it just said no fruit from you on your after and the lattice with ready piece of Lazarus no farm and the man that was dead for days came out alive amen say lipsti man let him go up sorry the power of the risen Christ amen now I want to just that was just fine it made my foundation there I just wanted you to see sometimes as we get further I'm not sure the way the Holy Spirit would take it sometimes I'm really surprised and then the service will hunt no this way I spent so much time on that and church also I could say it's got to believe in him the Holy Spirit we're just trying to follow the leadership with the Holy Spirit now I prepared up these four illustrations I know there's more because I found a fifth one a fifth one is the roots are representative of Israel and then put that one up there but these are the four I've studied up the first illustration of roots is Christ is the root which we read for our text the second one our hunt is the ground that takes in seeds that produce roots that's what I have the most fun right here the third one is I haven't develop this top I got a good thought I'm just kind of waiting for the Lord to reveal we are rooted in Christ so we're the plant so this one Christ is the plant and this one were the ground that takes two plants and the third one Christ is the crowded where the plants the fourth one the church is the branch that's attached to Christ the tree the branches he's the branch knife he's the branch and so forth a fifth one is Israel as the tree or as the branch so any good time we get that woke down just on that one way here so but if you study the word roots off of the Bible this is what I found so well with the highlights of these by the grace of Lord now I want you look at how Christ is the root or the root we read revelation 22:16 I just found this quote here I hope this is a blessing to you I just was so blessed by this this work is a revelation 22:16 said I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David the bright and morning star amen so Jesus says I'm the root of David and I'm the offspring of David so we go back to that picture now if I go back to that picture just let me do it okay yeah Christ is the root and he's the offspring he's gonna be that bug that turns into a flower or fruit or whatever it is Christ said I'm the root and the offspring of David so David was that natural but the but where David came from was a seed praise God or a light and Jesus says I am that seed because I am the root in other words I'm the beginning and the ending praise God you came out of God and you go back to God praising Christ is the root of David hallelujah so Christ is the root and he's the offspring so we win our lives you have to make sure that if the court of the stem here we got to make sure that we're taking in right we're taking in all the water nutrients that the roots are bringing to us how many thankful that you come to church or you read your Bible and you feel God giving you strength that's the roots bringing you live a minute how did it go I feel it all the time and I hope you can go to when you're down and discouraged you feel life coming in I was at it's the roof Christ bringing you the nutrients that's needed for you to produce what you're supposed to produce amen exactly right and in the offspring or the fruit that you produce it's actually Christ own life in your life it's Christ works in your life it's Christ working for you as Christ is the root and the offspring of David now we know of course that can represent Israel as well the root of David and so forth but we're a part of that and I'm not gonna really preach on that too much well when I just read this quote here from brother Branham let me look at draw a visual again here Christ is the root now let me show this picture before you've probably seen it before when I've taught on restoration of the bride tree I was anybody here well that's been a quite a few years ago I don't know Hosea members okay good memory brother praise the Lord I showed this picture it's one from brother Ron Malenko from the Philippines this is the restoration the body bride tree this is Pentecost acts chapter two Apostolic Faith there's the timeline on the side does this look pretty clear you didn't understand you started off with the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and you had all these things just about back your Balaam is with me that church age book the mother harlot nations Baptist you know pilgrim Holiness Nazarenes you and I believe we're up here I believe you're up here at the very top the boats have eaten all these branches right but if this tree under puts forth another branch it'll be at apostolic branch amen that's right and so we believe we're up here about the grace of the Lord and I want to just read this close I think you know in a huff understand you or help you understand because Christ is the Christ is the life in here as well Christ is the light that's coming up into the tree aren't you glad be attached aren't you glad to be grafted in the light of Christ praise God and how do we know from EMSA look at the approve your press on the producer that's how you know if this is bringing forward apples when it's an orange tree then that's a gratitude branch it's not from the original we need to see our lives producing what the Bible said we're supposed to produce a man with a fruit of the spare the gifts of the Spirit the love of God the mercy of God the patience the long-suffering the character of Christ the stature of the perfect man amen all this word for our day we should be manifesting in this hour amen exactly right now I want to just take the bullet off of this and look at the life of Christ programs of this God is determined that his vine won't die so God's determined this will done this is from playing the vine and where to play at 1959 so god plucked it up out of those creeks and fills it with the Holy Ghost and it comes down in Jesus name there that church can Paul say and live and enjoy and feel the Friends of the Living God watching him move and do things that he did when he Reich was when he was here on earth she'd understand that after Christ died he put his life in this tree and as a Pentecostal treated it was the only good but then an organization came up but then God cut it off right denominated so it died and another one comes up and when they denominated dives keep coming up but it's pulsating through the life of Christ now he says he says this Jesus was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world before there was the world he was with God he was the root and offspring of David the Morningstar the lily the valley that he must now look at this look what brother says about Christ I want you to take your mind off this and just put your thought on the life of Christ brother Graham said Christ roots are wrapped he said his roots are wrapped around God around the throne of God and around the kingdom of God his roots are wrapped his life spread forth to the earth so crisis like a tree in the throne of God which at a picture I could put up your mind on Christ was like a tree in heaven and his roots were all wrapped around the throne of God amen so that was his home he'd said that's where he was planted my brother never said this he said his roots are wrapped his life spread forth to the earth so his life grew down to there so he grew from heaven down to earth and He gave His life that he might go back to the roots so can I say like this Christ was a separate tree when he was on the earth around 33 Anki neveress a covered he does agree with that he was like a tree he was not a street right but when he died that tree was cut up from Graham's net but he said but he gave His life that he might go back to the roots of the by the Holy Spirit and Paul say again to bring forth branches out of this fund so Christ was a separate tree they cut him down he died right as his roots rock rap to heaven he was connected to heaven so are you and I obviously when we have the Holy Ghost we are without fault before the throne of God and the Bible said all the chewed all the truth of God about the outfit he's training them for them at the throne of God their faces do always hold the face of my father hey I don't know where they are but there's theophanies up there that always behold the throne of God and every child got a salami smell that the oppening he said but he gave His life so Christ was a separate tree Davis like that he might go back to the roots and this way then he went back to the root of the bride screaming said he says which is this church showing for the same results that he did when he was on earth and to make him the same yesterday today in forever o church living God believed as it's truth there he is when the true Spirit of God comes upon the believer whatever the scripture says he'll say Amen why is the Holy Ghost that wrote the Bible is in him pulsating his life on oh yeah you don't care who's sitting around and what anybody else says it's always did meet with the word he says so it always connect with the word and always and always have harmony with the Word of God so Christ was a tree cut down his life came back down to this tree and he's the life of this street bringing life into the bride tree and here we are at the end time putting forth the final fruit to the final age exactly right now what you've read this quote here let's first go to Matthew 13 now let's first go to Matthew 13 now I'm going to transition to this part like I said I've got an hour I got thirty minutes of time flies halfway done I saw the other two take the last half hour let's do this our heart as brown for the roots that's going to hear this very familiar portion well let's read it again so you know God loves public reading of Scripture could you then when Moses first got the law he read all of it in front of everybody Joshua came to the land he read a public reading in front of everybody Ezra Nehemiah Josiah when they found the law of God they would take the whole day just read the whole Bible to everybody would you like that that's what we do we don't read the whole Bible we read persons Amen and preach the anointed word that we are feeling inspired by amen Matthew 13 God loves the public reading the scripture Jesus stands there and says this day description is fulfilled amen loves our reading of Scripture now I want to go to this thought here this is the parable of the sower you America me with it Matthew 13 3 and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came by and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of the earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away so they had no deepness of Earth they had no minerals nutrients no Anchorage no place to be anchored so they had no root you got to have a ground before he could have a seat right yeah that kind of a place with the sea now verse 7 and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them and other fell into the ground and brought forth fruit some hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold who hath who hath ears to hear it on here now let's go down to verse 18 18 here he therefore the power of the soul when any one heareth the word the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side so we have wayside hearts right we're very foreigners some hearts are this way side the word just lays there and safety to come and take it out right away now verse 20 but he that receiveth the seed into the stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth this person actually has emotional response to the word so a rocky heart it can actually have a rut motional response to be excited about the word from the one your brother Graham said the stony heart was he said that was a person in denomination like the Roman Catholic Church he said because they say up on Peter upon this rock I'll build my church and it's a stony place so brother I said this is someone who's like a denominational believer that doesn't want to go any deeper they're like a Peter or a misinterpretation of Peters rock you know that's it is the stone wall this rock they're thinking about natural rocks right there interpreting the word and actually instead of spiritually so we don't want to be a make-believe Church pepper we want to be a real pure heart appreciative animal now verse 21 yet he had no Ruth himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he's offended so when there's no soil there's no no experience in Christ there's no roots there's no light the light doesn't get to push down into the Word of God what happens a little little persecution comes and the person gets offended at the word at the word they're gonna print out the word because they're not they're not deep in the word because the previous verse Jesus said this is the deepness of the Holy Spirit right the deepness of the word so if people don't get taken deeper into the word when tribulation comes they have no hankering and no foundation the life can't grow and they get offended at the word now verse 20 verse 9 22 he also that received the seed among the thorns is he that hears the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and become he becometh unfruitful this is the one that's gonna be our biggest trial right to make sure our hearts have all the all the cares of the world out right because they choke the word they don't let the word grow right they take the light they take the water from the root cap right from the roots the root hairs their take they're pulling those resources away something's pulling the way my tied with the water something's falling away my time to hear the word who got my mind my ability to receive the Word of God something's hindering me from hearing the preaching I'm not received it like I used to it's a care of the world is something of the world corny Jesus and it becomes unfruitful we don't see the fruit of spirit verse 23 we neither receive a seat in the good ground to see they hear at the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty and that beautiful look I said this is the seed shall possess the gate obscenities 61 let's be the hundredfold everyone don't say he's on a 100 fold I've always thought that but brother have said that let's be 100 400 be hundredfold let's go over he said let's go way over so see we don't want to take a small step into Christianity we want to go all the way into cruciate man we don't want to go shallow Christianity we want to go all the way then he says and let's sell out everything from the world and look to Christ and believe him with all of our that's how you become 100 fold according about the brand you selling everything to the world go deep as deep in Christ but leave Christ's word with all our heart and you can't believe what God Albania I want to just read - so you can see brother Graham said he said that's how these miracles happen when you sell out become 104 so now I'm around connects miracle working to 100-volt selling out all for Christ that's how the power of God moves among us I don't believe that is when there's no roots of bitterness this is where I'm going with roots everything is clean now and the Holy Spirit can work through us then we become a channel praise God if I could go back to my picture we become a channel to push out buzz and fruits of God and works of God well we have all the flues cleaned out amen when we read evil we have no roots of bitterness we can receive all the Word of God when we're full of the Word of God and Paul said don't just have a little bit of the spirit he said be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms spiritual hymns and testimonies right giving God the glory our lips let's always keep the praises of God on this man right if not we're not going to produce trying to push out the right thing that's the way to be 140 said all right so I think we can we have a pretty good understanding this now I just have a few pictures I mean I just found these on the internet and this by the church these these were really nice nobody can go deeper in God and we want to grow more fruitful in God's those are the two the X&Y there that's the the deeper you go got the four types of grounds you know the deeper you go in Christ of course the more rich you have yeah this is wonder that we're talking about here no get up a little depth depth but no fruit right because they got roots but they just got their getting their roots robbed the life is not able to grow and push out right because it's being robbed it's been starved a person who's playing in Christ but yet they're starved by the Peace of the world and the last issue the depth eliminating the weeds and you bring forth a very fruitful seasons that's what I would be right there 30 60 hundred don't you here's just another way to look at they give you another visual face blinders these people are totally blind in the faith the value of God's message is not understood disregarded well I don't I don't pay attention to message the hour who cares about the message who cares about the preaching of the word rocky faith the rocky faith is this contentment in surface faith in God's service I'm saying I go to church it skips dedication to death needed to stand firm because it doesn't have any root right the roots aren't able to grow they're not very hard in the Word of God the faith rebel ID said it like these illustrations the faith rebel is someone that destructively follows worldly priorities to compete with faith in God as primary they don't put God first yeah they do some things that pertain to God because they're rooted there's name stuff roots right have something like we say like a poulos version right they have some life but they're not producing the real fruit in the out and then those of that remaining faith faith that remains they have enduring faith in Jesus and they root for the understanding and practices God's Word I'm so glad to practice God's Word man amen I think I'll leave that but that's my last image if I go yeah I click it that's the end of the show so I'll leave that up there till we close I got a few minutes here like five minutes by the grace of Lord now let me read this quote from Y 1961 I think this will help you these code tell you Grady's down in it brother Branham was the light of the Allah without that light how we going to see so when he preaches on the scripture it ought to bring more light to the scripture of course we can understand that scripture I've never said no to you people that wanted to renew the joy of your salvation he's at an altar call I never feel like that I want to restore the joy of your salvation and to you somewhere you've lost joy think back what you did did you neglect prayer meeting neglect reading the Bible neglect Brandon hold asking the blessing at the table don't never do that that's so unbecoming to Christians to neglect any of these things pray anywhere see and if you ever let that left that joy that whenever we did it out what root of bitterness come in so he said Joy's like a plant to ease that the joys like a fruit we know right so if you don't see joy upon your planet he says see what to see what's growing up in your heart my brother man said remember when a man is saved and gets even be said gets eternal life in your heart that's God and as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God a man was made to be God did you know that he's the image of God he's a son of God he's like him he was given a domain and you know program said that he said the earth wasn't made for God to rule he said the earth was made for man to rule praise the Lord that's where God placed at is it you rule you you be the dominion over this God already rules had an earth and every amen having is my throne urges my footstool we are here on the earth to rule over the earth to rule over sin temptation wickedness unbelief trials perish the world where to rule over all these things aren't you glad to rule over Canaan priest a king will rule over these things as we preach on that numerous times he says now when you become a son of God a daughter of God begin you begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you now if you greet the Holy Spirit somewhere then go right back and think in your mind what did I start doing neglecting church did I start fussing with another denomination another church and that will impact your church right if you pick on somebody from another church no affect your church did I start picking on this one doing this to my neighbor he brings your neighbor's involved if you did that's what's acted out so it's kept your roots from going deeper go and say God I'm sorry I'll go right back and make that thing right I will go and do it then the Jordan will come back to your salvation the Holy Spirit just flew right up on the rafter he's ready to fly back down again anytime you want him to come back he does the leading praise God remember said forgive us of our sins this is an Abraham 1961 that those that have sinned against us may there be not one root of bitterness left in our hearts anyway may the Holy Spirit urge our lives and are conscious that this word that were fixing the Breitbart might come anointed it by the spirit he said you circumcise the lips and the ears it here that it might not fall upon shallow ground we don't to be shallow Christians right or upon rocks that be packed away by the birds of the air may it fall into good ground of faith and bring forth a hundredfold amen praise the Lord I'm reading these I wanted to look at the hearts the condition of the heart let me read this this is from Jehovah Tiger Parks who knows today way that we became by God's grace we know that every seed a promise of God will bring forth of its kind if it strikes the right ground to see that the heart the ground that's prepared ready all the rocks has been thrown out and the roots and the bitterness and the selfishness and the indifference and jealousy has all been crumbed out and the root of Ernest has spreads up that sometimes so spoils the thing that God is trying to do see God is trying to do something in our lives but if we let anything spring up that's not pure word it hinders what God is trying to do in our lives we preach on that land with rewards people can lose part their Lord or they could lose all their reward and still be safe like Saul he lost all of his reward but he was saved at the end there's so many Bible examples that we could show he said we break out that we won't be a money that won't be among us but that the good word will find good ground in these hearts praise God man praise and to whom shall we go 1960 right at this hour Lord we pray that you'll pull out every green fire every root of bitterness and all of this belief from the hearts of the people that the word might all ungood on goodrich fertilized soil that I'm bringing forth great results to this people I'm gonna see results in your life results of the word of you you're believing the word that you planted in your heart and lips I'm going to see the fruit of that calm come on that's his prayer Lord pull out anything that would hinder your your will for my life ah go to Hebrews 12:1 Hebrews 12:1 to Hebrews 12:14 Hebrews 12:14 it says I studied on routes that just all these illustrations I thought had gone Christ says the route use our cap he's on route cap praise the Lord and then also shown out of hearts look at the routes then we can get other ones to Hebrews 12:14 II follow a peace with all men and holiness you story everybody that you have peace does you have any wars anybody you have peace and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God see grace will never fail you but you could avail grace right and you've been erased by not obeying the Word of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled so root of bitterness just doesn't hurt one person it hurts a lot of people right right army lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright so she chose Esau was a man who had a root of bitterness he was bitter against the birthright for ever reason remember we went over when did we go over it was it last Sunday it was Wednesday night with the trailer sermon you remember that we showed how Esau he hated he hated the things of God he wasn't married he's a woman just to make his mom and dad upset right after he sought out the birthright for just up a meal ticket he sold it out and then I remember Rebecca said Rebecca said all my life is in vain unless Jacob marries a real Christian my life as a mother's in vain unless my children walk in the truth SUV are design you want to see everyone in this church walking truth you have nowhere in Jordan to see the children walking truth and you and I have the children understand it's not just by her I want to see my children walk in truth I'd have no greater joy than that but as a church we are the children of God and we have no grandeur to us at church when we see everybody walking in the word exactly right amen but if we let a root of bitterness or root oh look at this later of malice and he root brother up said anything give me a root a root of luster rid of greedy I rid of worldliness anything that gets in there it won't just defiled a person what defiles everybody that's exactly right just like in the garden yo eat your guard I could still do that recently wait my garden it really turned into an awful mess of weeds so I weeded on Thursday night and we didn't took about a hour just weed it all around and got it off phenom I had to wait for the inspiration they need to do that but and then the energy I guess but see without without a clean heart a person's life instead of blessing other people at the files of the people and it defiles many I have to say but brother Graham said and you know this from the adoption series brother have said unconfessed sin the church if somebody doesn't confess his sin will cause the church to bitterly fail any unconfessed sin and program said then God will hold the congregation accountable on the judgment that's that's really serious Church and what was in Bible example akin so Aikens rude up what greed was caught green right he had a root of greed he hid the Babylonian garments and all the things that he took that not only defiled him and his family but it killed what thirty other matter was eighteen I forget how many was so that was a rude that didn't get up rooted he failed to repent he failed to make that riot you see that and so in any root of sinned us left under the best it defiles others my man said your bad attitude are my bad attitude toward the work and keep somebody for being healed right but one thing we're thankful a real humble heart there's there's no unbelief that can keep God from a real sincere heart so let's just say if somebody has a distally spirit in here or somewhere else another church doesn't matter that doesn't means somebody can't get it you know it's just harder to get healed right it's just harder to do it cuz even jesus healed a crippled man at Simon Peters house right in those Pharisees he said what is it easier to do or what's up he's reduced easier to forgive his sins or heal his body so in that vein they have all those unbelief spirits right there and Jesus said rise take up your bed and walk is that right so see it can be done but it makes it harder the trouble with roots of unbelief or a sinner is that it spreads it's like leaven and spreads just like we so easily spread how do you want to spread the love of God instead of sin we ought to be able to spread the fruit of the Spirit the love of God we should be spreading those things rather than fruits of her crop ruin stay like that corrupt fruit and weeds and all these sins but that's one way someone can fail grace grace will not fail you if you accept grace but if you turn upon grace and crucify the word of God afresh to you we know what happens that's what the scripture says now a root of bitterness bitterness in this case means with extreme wickedness that was just bitter violent gall intense bitterness is also used as a poison of serpents let's the other way to look at it and that's what program said in the words of the church and Christ the mystery got revealed he said no men ever any any poisons of bitterness or poisons of greed of poisons of anything get in the church he said it'll hurt you he said it will kill the Spirit of God the church he said I'll hurt your pastor he said it'll do everything so instead remains on your best it defiles everybody at leavens the whole church but god help us to keep the feasts with sincerity and truth and keep all the sin out of the church my mom said that I know you feel the same way but we gotta come to this every time that we got to come to our lives and looking released having our lives do I have all the roots of bitterness out about the crown of my heart now this is alter description but let's go to Ephesians 3 I'm sorry fusions 4:30 but this is from here but let's put feet 4:30 let's try to do a few more quotes I got 8 minutes of everything here that's just one hour beaches for 30 we compromise book this with our eyes closed and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby the are sealed unto the your Redemption so this is where we can show people can be seen with the Holy Ghost but yet still have small falls in feathers now before we go on I'm gonna seal a desire to preach on this recently when brother Graham lied to the IRS don't remember that he said his head he felt like it was spinning it was going to blow up he said in one of the quotes he said I had a root of bitterness towards the IRS that was what was causing him to lie to his wife and the IRS a root of bitterness Manson I got the gold they drive out of my notes if you wanted if you wanted that that's what made him lie he was bitter towards the IRS and the investigation and even the IRS had said oh it's okay brother man the man said no it's not this is my response that you know I read the pokeman he said oh we put too much pressure on you said there's still no excuse for me to have a root of bitterness and that's how it is for every Christian in here there's no excuses that I harvest it right there's no reason to have boys in their lives let's have purity freeze gun crime Church beatings 431 let all bears so now the ball shows how the Holy Spirit is offended this is how always for is offended let all bitterness which we saw is poison we do this toward someone wrath which one problem rapid judgment on people and here I remember you can be angry too sitting up and yours but this is a bad anger where you what you want to do something about it clamor I didn't look at that up evil speaking be put away from you with all mouse mouse is it will like I'm going to do something people this person I'm gonna get them back that's Mouse I have an ill intention I didn't planning to hurt them sometimes you hurt people an accident don't mean it right but malice is when I'm trying to hurt this person because I feel they hurt me or because they hurt somebody else I love that's malice and these are the things that grieve or offend the Holy Spirit but look at verse 32 but be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you so in all things no matter how someone's hurt you or or whatever whoever's hurt you you have to look at every person as how would I treat them if Christ forgave how Christ forgive me how would Christ treat me that when I sit against Christ he would forgive you when you confess and Paul says it's that simple take any bitterness or any hurt towards any person and put yourself in Christ place what would Christ do if I get that to them and what we do you be tender-hearted grace God I mean no the Bible says that you've already obtained mercy if you've obtained mercy it's your possession how many know you should give it to other people let's go to first Peter two out I'll just read that because I just I've been reading through the book of first Peter after I got done with this EQ and first John second third job I'm reading first Peter now go to first Peter 2:9 if we have we actually have mercy as a possession we've actually much we can say we've arrived we can I say like that we don't want to think that like with like we've arrived and it's over there's no more of God but when it comes to actually I've arrived into God's mercy you have that you can say I am at God's mercy I've come to God's mercy I'll obtain this this is my property this is my possession I I have God's mercy aren't you glad you have God's an entertainment the Bible says in Psalms I believe is 92 God is always ready to forgive and pardon so we've come that God's throne of mercy we've obtained this mercy and so we must extend to other people first Peter 2:9 we have our chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that he should show forth the praises of him who hath called us out of darkness into his marvelous light how many how many called out of darkness I know out that darkness because I know what I used to be verse then which in times past were not a people but are now that people have got which have not which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy grace gone it's just like this church just like your bother you pick your Bible say I've obtained the Bible you could say the same thing I've obtained the mercy of God God is going to have mercy on me why because I darkness and walking in the light I've reached you I have obtained it so we like you said never to say well I haven't know everything from the banker I got it all figured out Matt okay I deliver that's not the arrival that I'm talking about also the moist pressing on for more Bob for the longer the hall icon but we should be able to recognize that I have obtained mercy I have the mercy of God and I can plead the mercy of God for myself and for other people I go back to the FISA 3:16 Seasons 3:16 says and he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that's the only way you're gonna get stronger is by accepting more of the Holy Spirit into your inner in their heart see the the light right in the roof since the inner man not the other man the inner man did you get the inner man right the outer man takes care of it right 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that evening what are you church we are rooted and grounded in love this is what I'm gonna get to next services more brother maybe Wednesday so I'm spending more time as our heart as the ground but now Paul is making the statement that you are the plant and you were supposed to be grounded in Christ in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height or look at that fourfold love next time we're sitting on that and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God how many want to understand love I like to understand Paul said we can understand love and there's four parts do I want to preach on that next time at all times that today it's very simple but I think you'll you'll be blessed I know I was blessed by him to be blessed by two but see if you know the love of Christ then you can be filled with all the fullness of Christ praise God don't you love that nah that's beautiful now let me go through a few more quotes here now here's where brother Graham said any room any sin is a route here's where he says it this is in marriage Atlanta 62 beautiful ending to this father they're yours he's praying at the altar they are trophies of your word they're here to be washed by the water of the word because it's the Full Gospel it's not sparing anything it's cut down to get down to the kindergarten place okay so they get down to very depths of things it's grubbing out the roots and the roots of bitterness and the roots of indifference the roots of the world grow them out Lord by the Holy Spirit cast them away from these people I claim them for you tonight Jesus as your own personal treasure as gems in your crown as members of your bride how many like that by God's grace like that and they go back to this I want to go back to that picture right here so program said the room of bitterness so bitterness can be a plant that grows down he said in different just being in different not winning agree with people were leanness any worldliness they're all they all can be roots in our lives I've never seen a root grow up in your life I have I'll be like a little raise my hand I'll be honest it I've seen things grow up a little fear a little bitterness a little greed little selfishness little things like that and program said may they be rooted out by the Holy Spirit he said go all the way down to the kindergarten level go all the way down to the life of that thing remember the story of the new Albanese Sunday school teacher brother am told we were part number as I started telling him she came to program many times saying tell me give me vision my friend gave me vision my man I gotta wait on the Lord for she'd spent all her husband's my girl doesn't work for Chevrolet I remember that girls work for Chevrolet she spent all his money at the doctor in cycling chiropractor was trying to get over her problems she came into program one time and finally the Holy Spirit shoulder with the problem was brother Graham saw a vision of her while she was married to her husband her husband was sent over to the war and she got lonely she went had an affair with another man almost got hit by a train in a car and he said I see you in a certain color car with a certain boy and she's straight after years of having psychiatrists and can't figure out what's wrong I wrote and said you better go confess that she said never she said I'll tell you you need to go or else we're gonna stay in this condition because he exposed the root of the problem the church said the root of the problem wasn't oh I need to go psychologists or I can't sleep her that's not the root the root of it was a sin that was unconfessed and it took the Word of God the Holy Spirit to go down to that kindergarten place that initial life an initial sin that was done and able to root it out and the only way to read out was to go confess it to her husband and we're going to be recursion so you can go because he said the same thing for you just a few nights ago he had a affair with a woman that works at the Chevrolet company and he said no not my husband and she said he said yes your husband go talk and they both confessed and they both asked for forgiveness and God restored their marriage what happened the Holy spirt went down to the root of it now these things I hear all I can't sleep or I need to go to a psychiatrist my stomach on the stomach ulcers all these things the very root of it was the unconfessed sin I mean want to confess all their sins amen and not let this grow up because if it's if the light keeps growing if that's keep saying that it's going to defile her sin to follow the whole church for Ramson it defied a pastor her husband her home life her kids were out of control this sin was the firing so many people but what what think about what rooted out from innocent he said the shovel of the Holy Spirit [Music] the tool of the Holy Spirit the Word of God are you able to go down there and say this is where you're wrong root it up and be freed Christ Nick I've come to my hour here let me find it basically closed program said this he says but when you live what you're talking about and show sweetness and all the roots of bitterness is out of you then then men will realize you've got something see the only way people are going to see anything in your life is when you have all the roots of bitterness up all the mouths all the clam and all the indifference any worldliness that's the only times people are going to well you have different planets in you than I have you have a you're guarded by your darkness is fruitful you don't have these things that I had that's the only way they're gonna know when all of the weeds around you love the Lord man look man upset with all the roots out he said a Christian can let the Holy Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can come back in the same condition that it was in the Garden of Eden hey I'm gonna be amen when a person keeps their heart pure they come back to being a God amateur got on the earth just like Adam just at that point before sin to get no roots of bitterness get no roots of fear in the roots of greed or lust and he was a God on the earth he was constantly sneaking the word and the word manifested itself oh that's what we want don't we Church we want that he wasn't the word who want to speak the word and the word operates the only way to do that he's to confess anything in our hearts but in him said as he pressed himself forward in you don't let a root of bitterness hatred there's another root malice strike that will run him right back out again he says but every time you move a little move out a little unbelief God steps in and takes a little God takes a little more over of you so my bad leg goes down the similar feet but Ram says the Holy Spirit of use like a little white button right a light it's like a light the size of a little button as you keep on as you get all the sins out of the unbelief up that light begins to grow and pretty soon God's got more control of you than the devil has nice get rid of all the habits get rid of all these things get rid of all the thoughts and all the difference of a critical and everything like that hey get rid of all of that and then you're fully filled God moving and growing into your heart today man growing into your life the RAM said like that little button being the Holy Spirit when it came in the baptismal form then it just begins to spread out then when we got all roots of bitterness and evil away from us God just takes over and have another Lord today the Lord said you come here to the piano when you're ready sir but Graham said little isms little funny feelings around you brother and things like that shake it away don't let no root a bit of this ever get into your soul if you do you know canker you so instead of growing in Christ you'll wither in Christ he said right keep love I don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow if you can't do that he said then you ain't sealed yes if we can't love those that hate us perhaps if we're probably not born again oh but love will keep out all bitterness all anger all strife all malice everything like that Oh Graham said Jesus had no bitterness when he was on the cross they mocked him spin his face he had no no roots of bitterness oh you could stand there and just take it like that when they spit his face and beat him around like that there was no root of bitterness he looked down at them and said Father forgive them for they don't know what they were doing the RAM said they all the roots of malice and all bitterness be taken from our lives then we might be humble and sweet before you praise God that's just enough some spirit living God [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this morning if you feel you've lost sweetness or anybody anymore you can't in your heart feel sweetness toward that person or feel nothing for that person
