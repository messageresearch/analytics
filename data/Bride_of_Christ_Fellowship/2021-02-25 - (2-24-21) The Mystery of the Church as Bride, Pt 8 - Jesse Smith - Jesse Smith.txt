talking about on sunday night who's in denomination well his his wife was sick and i got to go see him last night and this very subject that i preached last week came up and i just started just started flowing out of me you know and it was really just a great thing just to witness to him and share all the things that god has spoken to us we talked about how the real bride has christ as the head and he and yes what's a creed brother he said brother jesse what's a creed what do you mean by creeds and denominations and dogmas so i got to explain it to him he's like i want to copy that book as soon as you get it out he said i'll pay for it i don't want your money i said i'll just give it to you so anyways we had a good word of prayer also for his wife uh so asking god to do something great let's remember uh them in prayer well pray for it again on sunday so ephesians 5 32 then we'll read uh the memory verse ephesians 5 32. [Music] and just a reminder we have the lord's supper this sunday night by god's grace for all those who can make it i know we had the last one on a friday night at the new year's and so not everybody got to take the lord's supper but hopefully those who are able can come and partake of the lord's supper praise god ephesians 5 32. let's read that together on three one two three this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church praise god james five verse seven and eight please just trusting the great shepherd of the sheep to feed the sheep of god tonight praise god amen james five seven and eight praise god let's read that on three one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord drawleth nigh amen let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's make it known unto god i also want to pray for my friend's wife as well one more time here heavenly father we just come again to your throne of mercy you deserve the greater glory and the honor lord jesus and we are happy to give that to you lord we don't bring anything in our hands lord our and our hands have done clean works all day lord god we ask you lord though to purge our minds and our thinking and our any evil desires lord god and cleanse us god from any uh wickedness lord any uh any selfishness lord god any pride or fear as we heard on sunday let us be strong in the lord and the power of his might here tonight give us courage lord god to face the battle of fresh lord god we love you lord forgive us of our sins heavenly father and lord i just pray again you'll bless your lambs lord hear uh you told peter feed my sheep to show your love lord and so i show my love to you lord by feeding your sheep so feed them tonight richly lord god with

lord as i prayed last night i speak life in jesus christ's name father may she go to the appointment tomorrow and may there be nothing wrong lord god we just ask for your mercy we ask for your healing lord above all things let thy will be done yet we make our requests on unto you knowing our god is able to deliver her lord god and let this be a light and a testimony to her husband god that he might hunger and thirst for more of you in this message father just use us god to win souls lord god and to show the light and the life of jesus christ in this hour and we'll be forever grateful lord for your mercy and your grace and your provision your protection in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as your being seated praise god all right so we'll look at uh part eight tonight we're looking at uh the mystery of the church as the bride uh last week we looked at uh samson's wife was that a blessing hope everybody thought that was a blessing last week uh and his wife and i still got to follow up i forgot to follow up with uh it was elizabeth's question i still got to look into that you know did samson break any law uh by taking the honey out of the carcass of the line i still need to look that up i got the other ones done but i forgot that one i didn't follow up on that one yet so lord have mercy on me and hopefully we can follow up on that for sunday so let's look here i'll set my timer here let's try to preach a half hour my let's see if we can do that okay so we looked at all these uh we've looked so far at six uh women from the old testament and their lives have typed uh uh the the bride of jesus christ and what i thought was interesting too was many of them you know had jewish and gentile kind of characteristics like lord willing if we'll look at ruth tonight uh the last one is the shulamite from the song of solomon and she's a really good type i was reading through that one today if we can get to that but she's a really good one because we know she's jewish she's shula shulamite i think she's a singer from a town of issachar but yet she said my uh my hair is black like the tents of keter okay so uh and the tents of keter were ishmaelites gentiles and so i just think it's so interesting like esther right she's a jew but yeah for most of her life she was known like a gentile no one knew her characteristics and that's a beautiful type because the the bride is composed of both jew and gentile amen paul was a bride member yet he was jewish right peter and different ones and so we see just a beautiful type it's just it's glorious how god types him in there like we saw with rahab she was gentile but married into the jewish faith right in the very lineage of jesus christ so there's always these things i love what the bible said the bible said jesus tore down the great wall dividing jew and gentile and made of two one new man praise god amen i think that's just glorious how the scripture always gives us these women that are both jewish and have gentile connections praise god let's look at ruth tonight by god's grace she's a gentile moabitus and she types the churches or the gentile churches marriage to jesus so we know ruth was childless she was in a state as a widow and that represents the church's fruitless life before coming to christ and her hopeless marriage to the dead letter of the law amen right she was never going to get any fruit out of the dead letter right in other words you're never going to get real holy ghost fruit through the dead letter right the curse of the law the bible says the law was holy but the law contained curses under it right the bible said to be guilty of one was to be guilty of all of them amen so there was a great curse that uh ruth was under now and it's typed there in romans 7 4 so maybe i have some bible readers here tonight if we could amen all right first one haven roman 7 4. thanks for volunteering can you read romans 7 4 her marriage to boaz is going to symbolize the bride church's marriage to christ all right so romans 7 4 haven when you're ready you saying amen zion is that amen very good keep that up there if you would all keisha thank you let's get off all right great job haven kind of feel like i'm in the sunday night mode he said where for my brother now look you're also become dead to the law so i'm sorry ruth had to be dead to her husband right who passed away by the body of christ that she would be married to another to him who's raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god ruth was never going to bring forth fruit because her husband was dead so she had to have another marriage in order to bring forth life someone who was alive praise god amen not dead alive and so see boaz of course types christ okay so ruth's husband dying represents her being loose from the curse of the law praise god now brother braham breaks it down to ruth deciding ruth laboring and ruth resting praise god that's the three works of grace she had to decide that's justification she had to labor that sanctification then she had to just she had to rest that's the baptism of the holy ghost praise god so we see the beautiful type here now ruth here uh before marrying boaz she chose to travel back to israel with her elderly mother-in-law naomi and that types the gentile christians leaving their past lives and following the old past so naomi represents the old paths she's like the schoolmaster to bring us unto christ right because she had a choice do i go back to my worldliness or do i follow my schoolmaster praise god right and we know what she did she chose to follow naomi she said you'll be your god will be my god amen where you go that's where i'll go amen where you die that's where i'll die amen she saw something holy in that law praise god amen he saw something holy in that law she knew it was right amen so it represents the old strict uh teaching old teacher right the strictness of judaism because it was a school master and naomi led ruth back to israel and then ultimately to boaz because remember she didn't know where to go but it was uh it was naomi's idea amen hallelujah the old testament will always point you to christ amen hallelujah oh that's beautiful it was ultimately this word this old testament law that's pointing forward that's why i love reading this morning i started the book of mark this morning and the bible starts off and says to fulfill the scripture as it is written the bible said the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the lord make his path straight praise god the voice of one crying in the wilderness where are you gonna find that you're gonna find that in malachi you're gonna find that in isaiah right this old law pointing us to christ right pointing us to the messenger amen pointing us to the forerunner and then pointing us to the messiah praise god like naomi would point her to boaz amen now the timing is perfect it's just beautiful so lydia can you read uh ruth 1 22. look at the timing of her justification she she decides to follow the law she decides to follow the school master the teacher right the trainer uh she decides to follow the holy teaching and when look when she arrives in the promised land amen so lily can you read that for us hey man leave that up there so barley harvest was marcher april right that was the first harvest march in april was barley right and then may on to august was wheat harvest so they always had two harvests right why that's why they needed a former rain and a ladder rain praise god they had two harvests and so here we see that they come back and the very timing where the the law is leading the gentile bride the very timing the very place and timing of their return is the time of the passover praise god amen that's what the word of god will do the word of god where will take you it'll take you to the cross of jesus amen hallelujah if you fought follow this law long enough if you believe in it if you believe the word of god memorize it it'll point you to christ it'll take you to isaiah 53 praise god he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities but with his stripes we were healed amen glory so they arrive at uh uh passover time praise god so we see it's a beautiful prophetic type here how in this barley season it included passover which was the death of the lamb the unleavened bread which represents jesus's unleavened life and then the first fruits which represents the resurrection amen so her arrival at barley harvest represents the gentile christians coming to faith in christ by experiencing the spiritual blessings of jesus's death burial and resurrection and let me say i'm still benefiting from those blessings right now praise god amen even tonight church think about that even tonight we're still keeping the feast of passover unleavened bread and the first fruits right because we're living in the blessings of christ we the bible says that we continually preach the cross of christ amen because there's power in the cross there's power in the blood of jesus now let me prove it to you so malachi get first corinthians five seven and eight and then who else wants to read any other newcomers we're going to read heaven again okay that's fine ephesians 5 18. get that so malachi first corinthians 5 7 and 8. this is such a beautiful picture church you know the bible said that jesus ever lives to make intercession is that right well while jesus died 2000 years ago he took he had to have taken some of his blood to heaven because the blood sits there on the the altar in heaven the mercy seat in heaven he he sits on a throne and that throne is the seed of mercy right so it's like a perpetual power of the cross it's as if the cross doesn't lose its power for two thousand years amen and it's a continual sacrifice uh the blood is always there to make intercession aren't you glad there's still blood for your sins amen aren't you glad there's still uh a high priest to intercede for you and i amen hallelujah there's the blood hasn't been taken away the blood's still there praise god and it's not like the catholic where they gotta go partake of of bread and wine where they think jesus has to die again he has to die again he has to die again it's not that it's not a mass right it's not the mass and it's not but it's a continual benefit of the power and of the blood there's still he's still a bleeding sacrifice right is there still a bloody sacrifice there amen there's there's something there to receive us there's something there to speak forgiveness for our guilt amen now here look what he says and it's gonna prove it to you i'm still so like ruth ruth came there right at the time of the passover we're still in passover we're gonna celebrate it in a couple months but church we're supposed to celebrate it tonight praise god amen and that's the reason people fall away is because they stop celebrating and now it celebrates not the right word the right word is worship amen they stop worshiping and like they're at passover right they think they can move on church we can never move on from the blood of jesus christ we'll grow in maturity but we still need the blood every single day so every day is a feast day praise god amen it's proven to us i don't have to prove it it's proven in the bible purge out therefore the old leaven so what's that speaking of unleavened bread right that you may be a new love as you are unleavened for even christ our passover passover is sacrifice for us therefore let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen so what god wants us to do is continually have the the sacrifice of christ before our minds and that's why church we've got to remember to sign cry for the abominations right we got we have to have that sincerity we can't lose our sincerity we have to know all the pain that was put on jesus so that we could be forgiven we can't forget the the the suffering that christ went through or the agony that he went through the cross passover has to remain real to us god help us to always remember the blood of jesus amen and if we keep that feast and you know a feast uh feast is a very solemn time right so all of our days have to be uh we've got to have a real sincerity to our days we have to make sure that we're we're constantly aware of what god has done and here it is right there we've got to keep the leaven out of our lives amen we've got to keep sin from growing in our lives we've got to be able to clean it out before it grows into something that would destroy us right or someone we love or someone that we care about or a friend we've got to keep the leaven from growing so it doesn't spoil our lives right we see it all the time where people let sin spoil their lives and it just ruins their life it'll ruin right their finances it'll ruin their marriage it'll ruin their local churches right it'll ruin their friendships people will let you know politics ruin 40 years worth of friendships right malachi we heard about that on monday now that one little political uh event ruin everything it'll just destroy it because leavens got in there but you and i need to clean it all out we need to wash it out we just sweep it out we let the holy spirit clean out our lives amen that our lives are free from sin and if we do that church it will be like we're keeping a constant feast of sincerity and truth now my bible tells me let me just flip a couple pages here well i shouldn't say well my bible my reference bible i should say my reference bible tells me this was written in 59 a.d 59 a.d almost 30 years after the cross amen paul was still still saying we have access to the benefits of the cross amen we must remember the cross we must keep jesus's sacrifice and and the the crown of thorns uh and the uh the spirit his side and the the beating that he took we must keep that in our memory right we must keep it sincere we must live in truth we got to tell the truth praise god we got to make sure that we remember what he's done for us and live with appreciation and live like it's a feast amen it's what must be done he said let us keep the feast i don't know about you but i it's not easter but i'm still keeping the feast praise god all right i'm praying at my house i'm praying at the church i'm praying in my car right you should do the same thing right we're keeping the feasts we realize that it's a special time amen it's a special time every time is a special time in the prince of the lord amen it's something to keep it's something that is continually going and here's where ruth comes she comes at the time the most sacred time of the year praise god she made the decision i'm going to just i'm going to decide to follow the law i'm going to follow the school master my teacher i'm going to follow the holy teacher right and where does that take her it takes her to a time of feasting amen hallelujah now the next one i think of haven ephesians 5 18 could you read that before son is yes i don't know why i put that one in there actually i'm not sure how that is connected there so forgive me oh oh just being filled with the holy ghost because that came at the day of pentecost right so at the day of pentecost they were finally filled with the holy ghost in the soul so paul says we've got to constantly fill now this is speaking of the mind right be fulfilled or be filled in the human spirit because the soul gets sealed it gets a portion of the holy ghost that's right so we keep all these feasts we keep our sincerity and we keep our sinless lives before the lord now the bride church like ruth came to christ in a timely manner and then we enjoy all the blessings of the cross and of the final harvest pentecost because we know right now we're in the feast keeping a feast we know we know we need the cross we know we need unleavened life amen we know we need the resurrection life and we know the wheat is coming to maturity and jesus is going to harvest all the wheat that belongs to him because he's lord of the harvest amen hallelujah thank god it's a continual feast and church this should remind us look at this this should remind us of romans 12 how we're to continually be a living sacrifice so we have two continual sacrifices going on christ's sacrifice is continually working for us but then we've got to continually lay ourselves on the altar of sacrifice see the trouble is we people will come to come to christ they'll lay themselves on the altar for a few years and then they stop sacrificing right they stop uh dying out to themselves right like you know it's just it's just a point some people never fast some people can be in the message and never fast well jesus said when you fast don't be like the hypocrites he didn't say if you want to fast he said when you fast amen praise god they asked him how come john and his disciples fast and how how come you and your disciples don't fast he said how can the children of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom's with them praise god this is a happy time this is a joyous time he said but after the bridegroom leaves then they will fast church it's a continual sacrifice we've got to beat our bodies and bring them into subjection paul said i'll do anything so i'm not a castaway of the faith amen he said i'll beat my body bring it under subjection i must do many things like one time somebody said uh recently they said well you should gain some weight you should eat more i just had to look at him i said well if i if i do that i won't fast right i i mean i appreciate that that someone cares maybe i'm too skinny and that could be true but the point i'm trying to make is that uh and there was it was in love you know it was a love but the point i'm trying to make is like i've got a choice because i know i'm old enough to know i'm 40 years old right i want to know if the more you eat the more you want to eat is that right i mean that's how it is well it's true with the coffee the more i drink coffee the more i like it right and i don't put sugar in there so it's not it's not a bad thing but the point i'm trying to make is that we've got to bring our bodies into subjection we amen we've got to master our own bodies amen we've got to have temperance which is self-control praise god we're the ones that know how often we should fast right the holy spirit should work with us in such a personal way that we know how to bring our bodies into subjection to find his leadership amen oh hallelujah praise god amen in other words it's a time to seek the lord it's a time to humble yourself so when am i i do it at certain times usually throughout the week and different other times because i know i've got to find the mind of god my wife says i do that all the time amen church that's my little signature you know cam brother cam does this i do this what does simon do you have to look that one up next time he freaks his fart yeah all preachers got there you know main things oh yeah simon thank the lord brother dick she's like you don't get that high voice like that everybody's got their little quirks you know but sea church that's what we're looking at here where we've got to be keeping a feast we've got to be dedicated right we've got to be sincere and we've got to speak the truth praise god it's a continual self-sacrifice you've got to choose like someone sent me a brother he sent me another he fell back to pornography not in our church he's overseas actually and he said please tell me what to do i said i just wrote it in all caps resist the devil and he will flee praise god he said give me a word from the lord i said that's thus saith the word amen that's all you got to do you've got to resist if someone was breaking in your house would you stop it would you resist them or not somebody's going to take your lunch right off the table would you resist them or not you've got to resist you've got to fight back amen hallelujah that's how we realize we gotta fight back against the sin nature inside of us and we've got to be a continual sacrifice we have to realize yeah there's times where we can let off the pressure but then there's time we got to realize i need to sacrifice so i can contact heaven amen hallelujah like the last time jose came up for prayer for the glaucoma some of us were praying and fasting i remember another brother was praying and fast and i believe if i'm not mistaken that same day of course you know i would usually like to pass on sunday saturday a little bit too as i just think it's uh inspiring you know i think it's a it's a it's a thing we have to do we have to keep a con i wasn't planning on preaching this this much i'm using that part of my most of my time here but we have a continual sacrifice in heaven right but it's it's too it's to create glory it's to bring heaven down to earth amen hallelujah right let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven what is going on in heaven continual sacrifice amen right continual intercession amen and what's earth supposed to be like continual intercession amen where we are the priests now praise god he's the high priest we're priests unto god we're not high priests we're just regular priests praise god right but we have access to the high priest amen hallelujah through prayer and intercession we can contact the high priest who's a mediator between god and man amen glory so i didn't mean to preach on that so long but anyways god knows we must need it praise god now in ruth's remaining story boaz redeems naomi in order to purchase and marry ruth in ruth 4 verses 9 through 10. now you know the story so justification she's i said i'm following you when she got justified it led her when she decided that it led her to barley season led her to passover letter to christ right and then but then she's got to find a way to get food right she's got to find a way she's got to go labor right and naomi says go to boaz go to the messiah go to christ right labor for christ amen church labor for jesus and he'll give you all these little extra sheaves praise god like our brother donnie reagan was saying one time uh it was a good one uh that one time boaz said leave her so many sheets i forget how many it was and brother donnie just he illustrated it and he said as ruth was carrying it back he said look i got a sheep or he's looking at the wheat and he said look here's a god hiding himself in simplicity here's serpent seed that those are the seeds that were in that sheath here's the the seven church ages here's the seven seals i thought that was a really good i thought that was a cute illustration because she had the food she had the fresh harvest praise god the fresh word amen boaz the great kinsman redeemer left his word to his future wife amen because you know that church we're not physically married to jesus yet brother brahm said we're potentially married to him by the baptism of the holy ghost but we're not physically married to him till we meet him in the air praise god but i said we are going to the marriage supper praise god we're going to be married to him right now he said we're just potentially we're espoused we're engaged oh that's why we can be so excited because we're looking forward to a holy a perfect and eternal wedding praise god oh hallelujah and i know how excited i was for my wedding praise god so imagine how excited we should be for the heavenly wedding praise god i was so excited i said lord just hold off the rapture so i can get married and have a few kids you know i think i said something like that but i knew i said hold it off so at least at least can get married you know because you know i didn't like my parents divorce and it really hurt me and i just wanted to do it right i want to do it god's way i wanted to know what real love was praise god god sure give me a wonderful wife and family praise god now so boaz redeems uh ruth and naomi he redeems naomi in order to marry your ruth this is the type of jesus shedding his blood on the cross in order to purchase both jew naomi and gentile ruth praise god beautiful acts 20 verse 28 says jesus purchased us with his own blood right just like boaz purchased them with his own money right so jesus purchased us with his own blood amen hallelujah now after their marriage ruth bears a son named obed and lets naomi nurse her son or her seed right this types the seed life of the gentile church the holy spirit right what what is our life the holy spirit's our life right this time's the sea life of the gentile church the life that was in the church the holy spirit returns to the blinded jews after the rapture or wedding of the bride church amen the sea life went through us from boaz through us to naomi praise god amen and all israel women rejoice for naomi who now has a kinsmen nourishment and a restored life through boaz and ruth praise god amen so see now the 144 000 jewish remnant enjoy the same they get a kinsmen redeemer in christ right and they get spiritual nourishment through the new testament truce and they get restored spiritual life through the seal of the holy ghost in their foreheads amen oh it's beautiful praise god what a beautiful type that we see in the scripture remember that i love what i love what naomi said naomi was getting all worried you know whoa what do i got to do and naomi just said rest my daughter rest he's going to go finish the work see that's what the law tells us just rest just obey and trust and jesus is going to work it out praise god amen you just rest with the baptism of the holy ghost just rest in the promise of god amen and jesus will accomplish this church this is what i know you and i are not going to bring forth the rapture jesus is going to bring forth the rapture praise god we've got the rest in his commands and he'll bring it to pass it's his great marriage today praise god the father is putting on this ceremony we're going to be ready but it's jesus that's going to bring it to pass amen oh my god just rest little bride amen just rest boaz is going to take care of it praise god he's going to go out to the gates praise god he's going to make the redemption he's going to purchase it praise god and he's going to call us away for that great wedding day amen hallelujah a great wedding day we'll be ready we've just got to rest in the power of boaz amen what does boaz mean you guys remember that i forgot what it meant what was it amen the quickener and what was it what was the last one strength is in him amen christ our strength i could look down on sunday be strong and courageous amen praise god now why don't we just start uh lord willing let's go to shootemite like i said i tried to i got to narrow this down a little bit let's just start the shunamite so let's go there uh let's go to song of solomon if you would please song of solomon uh yeah give me five minutes here we'll finish because that's almost half hour so it'll be about 35 minutes sermon praise god uh song of solomon and uh little readers here let's have uh nature would you like to read yeah you like song and stop and that's right can you can you read uh song of solomon chapter 6 verse 13 nature and then lydia song of solomon 1 verse 8 malachi song solomon 2 verse 2 and haven solo song of solomon six verse nine so nature's got 613 lydia 1 8 malachi 2 2 and haven 6 verse 9. all right let's close with this thought here by god's grace it's just ah this is so beautiful the name of [Music] yeah great thank you nature praise the lord so here's the the one place in this book where they name this bride this is the only place in the book where she's named she's not given a literal name she's just called the shulamite good job nature shulamite now the hebrew definition at least in the easton's bible dictionary means from shunim and shunim is a little village in the tribe of issachar okay so that's a jewish jewish tribe right all right so here we see a shulamite now the reason she types the bride of christ is because she is solomon's love interest in the entire book and she's his only love interest we know he really fell away in his older days right the bible said when he got old he got cold on god and fell in love with more women and their worship more than he loved god and god got angry god gave him uh god gave him adversaries the end of his life he was always constantly battling this guy i forget the name of the kings he just kept battling them because of his own belief but notice throughout this whole book it's just a beautiful book throughout the entire book he's not interested in any other woman just her she's never divorced and she's never put away like israel was amen she is his one and only lydia read the song of solomon one verse eight she was not a fair one among women she was the fairest among women the bride of jesus christ is not a good church she is the purest church amen i don't know she's not one bride she is the bride amen she's the fairest of all the women amen hallelujah this is the only woman solomon's interest in in the entire book and solomon is what son of david praise god and son of david speaks of the millennium praise the lord amen malachi song of solomon 2 2. amen so we have a bunch of thorns does that remind you of hebrews chapter 6 brother jose it just struck me hebrews 6 the bible talks about thorns and how the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen but we're not thorns we're not bringing forth thistles we're lilies amen bringing forth fragrance and and blessing and beauty praise god amen we're a lily amongst a bunch of thorns amen hallelujah so what should we do grow up in the christ amen hallelujah face the sun let the sun empower you praise god amen use the strength to grow up to the son hallelujah you're the fairest of all the churches you're the lily the beauty amongst all the immorality praise god and then uh haven song psalms 6 9. [Music] foreign hey man george how can you say hardly any better words about a woman here she's blessed she's a dove she's the choicest of all the journal i got eight kids and we're not trying to you know we're not trying to show favorites or anything like that but in a family a big family in the old testament they recognize well this is the fairest of all of them this is the choicest of all of them praise god everybody knew this one this one's a she's extra special praise god hey amen hilaria she's affairs she's the lilly among thorns amen she's the one and only she's the blessed one she's special she's different than all the others why because she's been washed by the waters of the word all the other ones are dirty all the other ones are unclean all the other ones aren't prepared but you and i have been washed by the word amen a real cleansing amen i trust your soul feels that way tonight you're truly clean in your soul amen the bible said purified through the obedience to faith in your soul peter said that you're purified in your soul the other churches can't claim that they can't even get their minds pure let alone their souls but our souls have been washed in the blood of jesus amen hallelujah no he didn't put this one away at least in the book no this one wasn't put away this was the choices this was the the fairest of all of them now solomon was the fairest of ten thousand right so i'm trying to make sure i use the right language here because i keep wanting to say you're the fairest of ten thousand that's that's for that's for christ the bride is the fairest among all the women now the shulami again was from the tribe of issachar a little village in the issachar area now song of solomon 3 verses 9 through 11. can you read that one lydia i'm sorry malachi can you read that song of solomon 3 9-11 this this name solomon so we know it's it's speaking of solomon hey man praise god i was looking on the map i wasn't i didn't have uh didn't think to look up where issachar was but i can't find it right now because all the i was all the words in these old maps but here it names oh this is chapter three so this is solomon getting ready to go uh to meet his bride amen because their honeymoon and uh their wedding night is at the end of chapter three and in chapter four so this is i'm sorry specifically names solomon as the bridegroom and the shulamite as his lover and king so chapters one through three traces their romance from the beginning to the end of their engagement the shulamite she's asking to be drawn into fellowship uh by her lover despite her black sunburnt skin now this black sunburst skin shows she was a vineyard worker labor and she was not of royal ascent to the flesh amen because royalty don't work in the sun right but she worked outside so much you know there's scripture makes it sound like she's a shepherd but she no doubt worked in the vineyard as well so right away her skin color is connected with the gentile clan of keter which was a clan of the ishmaelites in song of solomon 1 verse 5. so can you read that real quick maokai song of psalm 1 verse 5. she said look upon me she she was asking for his love amen now remember she's the most beautiful one of the family but yet she's not royalty right go ahead okay amen so this gives evidence that she's jewish but she has an appearance as a gentile praise god amen hallelujah you and i are gentiles but inside we're spiritual jews amen that's right so see she's a type of the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile amen hallelujah so she's saying don't look at my outside on my outside i'm not royalty i'm i'm nothing special on the outside in fact i look like the ishmaelites right did you do you think israel would like the ishmaelites no like i don't look very good on the outside i'm laboring out here in the hot sun but but call me draw me and i'll run after you praise god amen just just speak the word just speak the word and i'll come to you amen and what does jesus say uh whosoever will let him come unto me he said oh who's thirsty come unto me amen oh that's that's longing for a drink come to me and drink and here the daughter says draw me and jesus says come he invites his bride he invites this beautiful woman come and be my bride amen oh it's such a beautiful picture although i'm nothing special to this earth the scripture says draw me and i'll run after you praise god i better stop right there let's stand to our feet praise god i could probably preach another 15 minutes but i better stop here by god's grace musicians can come here amen church how many believe you're a fairest among the women how many believe that by god's grace i believe it i believe i'm a lily amongst thorns i got a little extra reason to believe that brother jose because brother ram talks about pastor lily that's just a little joke there but the the reality is church you are god's dove you're his tender undefiled right bird that has no gall right can't you can't eat the things you can't enjoy the things of the world like all those other thorns can you're a special built bird amen blessed you're you're special you're different than all the other ones amen in your soul now in your soul cause on the outside you're not nothing royalty you weren't born into mega church maybe you weren't born into the branham family can i say like that or another famous preacher family but one thing is you just you love that solomon you love that man right we love jesus there's just something about jesus and we just say lord i'm really nothing special but if you'll draw me i'll run after you if you draw me if you give me permission i'll do whatever it takes i'll become yours [Music] praise god oh my this is a beautiful story [Music] let's have a word of prayer here [Music] let's just uh end with thanksgiving can we do that today let's be thankful that we're his dove [Music] we're a lily amongst thorns and we're the fairest among women church let's remember what god thinks about you remember what god thinks about you you know your humble beginnings right we know our humble beginnings we're not royalty we're not we're not the royal family from the uk have no connection to those worldly things and the bible says we do have a special character a dove like character praise god a dove like character amen the holy spirit praise god and it's special it's unique it's a lily among authorities it's the bright spot amidst all the chaos the darkness fears among all the women you know there's a song we're listening to last week whether it was remind me who i am it's a nice little song it's not really a worship song i just appreciated that song that night this kind of goes like that remind me who i am because sometimes i don't feel [Music] sometimes i don't feel like a lily right sometimes you don't feel as pure as a lily sometimes we don't feel beautiful sometimes i don't feel like the fairest me but he's not looking at the outside he's looking at the inside the desire he's looking at the soul and the soul is your desire the will of man your free more agency so how many will pledge tonight with the free more agency jesus i love you i will obey you i'll do anything you want me to do i i surrender my entire will to you let's pray heavenly father my hands are up lord my heart is up as well i know i'm nothing of myself my flesh no one here is lord god because we have no connection to those things lord you're the one like history says solomon rode by on his his exalted horse and he saw that beautiful girl although she was black as the intensive eater he fell for her she was just a vineyard worker she had a special personality about it and he redeemed her out of that hard laboring lifestyle and she went from the vineyard laboring in the vineyard to the palace [Applause] that's how you are lord we're going about our lives and you saw us you came riding by hallelujah on the wings of the holy spirit and you saw me that denomination and you found me and you called me out and said come on up you're leaving the vineyard and you're coming up to the palace amen praise god hallelujah thank you jesus the lord are you saying how my word but lord everybody else in this story they saw she was special she was blessed she was unique she was the fairest of us but she herself didn't see it like that and lord we humbly say that in ourselves we don't really see it like that but lord our desire is to love you guys we'll see lord really next week our desire is to the soul of jesus christ that our hearts might be knit together that our souls might be one of the same thank you lord for your love we just want to take a moment and lord renew our desire lord to please we renew our desire to follow all your commands we renew our desire to trust you lord with our lives [Music] if there's anything lord that's hindering that desire if there's any leaven growing up lord clean it out we surrender sweep it out
