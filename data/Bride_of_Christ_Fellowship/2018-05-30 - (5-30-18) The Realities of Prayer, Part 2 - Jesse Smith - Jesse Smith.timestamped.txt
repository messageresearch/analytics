[37:47] like to go back to the prayer series
[37:49] tonight by God's grace let's go to first
[37:51] Timothy chapter 2 I like to look at
[37:53] prayer this is only part two of this
[37:56] series I started that back in April
[38:00] fourth and I haven't got back to her
[38:01] since then so I had a lot of notes on
[38:03] that so I want appreciate tonight by the
[38:05] grace of the Lord trust everyone was
[38:09] real stirred up from the meetings on
[38:10] this weekend
[38:11] I just thought God just spoke in a
[38:13] tremendous way and brother Joe was so
[38:16] blessed to be with all of you and he was
[38:18] he said just have such a wonderful
[38:20] church to preach to you and I said
[38:21] that's right I sure enjoy preaching in
[38:23] this church and you're such wonderful
[38:26] people you pay attention you focus on
[38:28] the word and you pull on the word and
[38:30] yeah you smile and you laughing you clap
[38:33] and cry and I appreciate that by the
[38:36] grace of the Lord he's just a wonderful
[38:37] time with us and so I like I said I
[38:39] invited him back he'll be coming back
[38:40] the last weekend of October by God's
[38:42] grace I want to make sure I get him
[38:44] right back and just really appreciate
[38:47] his ministry by God's grace
[38:48] so first Timothy chapter 2 verse 1 I'll
[38:52] be our text it's the same text we used
[38:53] back on April 4th
[38:55] we started this by God's grace so I've
[38:58] read four chapters in this book by II M
[38:59] bounds and I've been pulling thoughts
[39:01] out of there that of course line up with
[39:02] the message in the Bible and so that's
[39:04] where I'd kind of draw my inspiration
[39:05] from by the grace of the Lord
[39:08] last week I preached on you know
[39:10] learning and then that's one way I've
[39:11] been learning is through this book by
[39:15] God's grace 1st Timothy 2:1 through 4
[39:18] a wise man can always learn more by
[39:21] God's grace and he'll love you more if
[39:22] you correct him thank God for that
[39:25] I want to be corrected by the Holy
[39:26] Spirit praise God 1st Timothy 2:1
[39:29] through 4 for there say Amen I exhort
[39:32] therefore that first of all
[39:33] supplications prayers intercessions and
[39:37] giving of thanks be made for all men for
[39:41] kings and for all that are an authority
[39:42] that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
[39:45] life in all godliness and honesty for
[39:47] this is good and acceptable in the sight
[39:49] of God our Savior who will have all men
[39:52] to be saved and come unto the knowledge
[39:56] of the truth amen let's just bow our
[39:58] heads in word of Prayer if you have a
[39:59] need on your heart just make it known
[40:01] unto God here tonight Heavenly Father we
[40:04] are grateful Lord to be in your presence
[40:05] we're gathered here in your house of
[40:08] worship and we know there's nothing holy
[40:10] of itself in this place except your Holy
[40:12] Spirit so father it's your spirit that
[40:15] makes us a holy place and thank you for
[40:17] visiting us here tonight I feel your
[40:19] presence I feel the sacredness of your
[40:21] spirit and Lord we give you glory and
[40:23] honor for that Lord God Lord we know
[40:26] that you promise to meet with us so Lord
[40:28] we ask that you fill our cups we ask
[40:31] that you feed us Lord and lead us by
[40:33] still waters Lord God and feed us in
[40:35] green pastures Lord Jesus Shepherd us
[40:38] here tonight Lord for we need your grace
[40:40] and mercy
[40:41] Heavenly Father speak to us through this
[40:43] the word and Lord bless every heart and
[40:45] soul that's here hungry and thirsting
[40:47] for righteousness that made sacrifices
[40:49] or to show everyone what side they're on
[40:51] here tonight Lord God we give you all
[40:54] the glory honor and praise in Jesus
[40:56] Christ's name I never said Amen you may
[40:58] be seated god bless you praise the Lord
[41:01] so I just have a few few slides and I'll
[41:03] be preaching off some notes that I took
[41:05] but let's look at part two here
[41:10] this is part two like I said and we
[41:12] started it back in April I haven't got
[41:14] back to it but I kind of been reading in
[41:16] there and hoped would be a blessing to
[41:17] you tonight we read our text and like I
[41:21] said I've been drawn inspiration from
[41:22] e/m bounds he lived in the late 1800s
[41:25] and into 1900 he wrote numerous books on
[41:29] prayer he was a preacher and an attorney
[41:31] his books are free Ani sort if you want
[41:33] to read them I've really been blessed by
[41:34] them they've really been a challenge to
[41:35] me and then I've read the first four
[41:37] chapters now and I've been really
[41:39] blessed on those by God's grace but
[41:42] first I just want to make a few points
[41:43] about this weekend and I just want to
[41:45] share just a few things from my heart I
[41:49] just thought I thought again we heard
[41:52] from heaven you know I wanted to say
[41:53] that again I thought that like we heard
[41:55] from heaven I think I was almost crying
[41:56] almost the whole services both services
[41:58] were so tremendous just because I've
[42:01] been going through battles and I've
[42:02] shared them with you know the last few
[42:03] Sunday nights when I preached actually
[42:05] when I preached on the test of life I
[42:07] shared a little bit of the battles been
[42:08] going through and different things like
[42:10] that
[42:11] but it was very helpful and I hope I
[42:13] hope by God's grace that everybody saw
[42:15] how important it is to in prayer to
[42:18] speak the Word of God in prayer and to
[42:20] fight with the Word of God there's so
[42:23] much truth to what brother Joe was
[42:25] preaching a lot of the things you
[42:27] probably if you're honest you've heard
[42:28] before right but applying them to our
[42:31] lives is what we need a lot of help with
[42:33] by God's grace and that's what we need
[42:35] reminders for and so this weekend my
[42:37] prayer closet in prayer time I've been
[42:38] quoting more scripture and fighting the
[42:41] devil with Scripture I've you memorize a
[42:42] scripture I memorized Romans 5:1
[42:45] therefore you justified by faith and now
[42:49] you have peace with God through our Lord
[42:50] Jesus Christ I've been because I've been
[42:51] battling having this war you know and so
[42:53] I was memorizing that scripture quoting
[42:55] it and driving back the enemy by God's
[42:58] grace I hope you were as well by the
[43:00] grace of the Lord so I've been enjoying
[43:02] that and I want to say to you know
[43:06] brother Tim her brother Joe's ministry
[43:07] is very powerful because and that's
[43:10] where and that's what I was thinking too
[43:11] that's how powerful the Evangelist gift
[43:14] can be because we know we know that God
[43:19] has the fivefold ministry and we know
[43:22] that that
[43:22] complements all the other four gifts
[43:24] right and it was such a blessing to have
[43:26] him come in here because I do a lot of
[43:28] teaching that's kind of nice that's kind
[43:29] of the gift God's given to me and it was
[43:32] great to have him come in here and
[43:33] that's what evangelist is supposed to do
[43:34] he's supposed to come in here and stir
[43:36] up the people and he's supposed to get
[43:37] out of the city like Philip did in
[43:40] Samaria and then go back to where he was
[43:43] and he was just really elated to be here
[43:46] and it ties him perfectly you know he
[43:47] was saying you know we can we can get so
[43:49] caught up on teaching right he was
[43:51] saying how you can get caught up on deep
[43:53] things and that's true you know
[43:55] sometimes people can go too deep on
[43:58] teaching and things like that and I
[44:01] appreciated that because some people
[44:03] when they when they teach on things they
[44:05] don't teach people to get to the cross
[44:07] so what I mean by that is like he was
[44:10] saying you could teach on the seven
[44:11] seals but if you don't teach on that and
[44:14] at the end of it point them to the cross
[44:15] to show all those revelations with the
[44:18] the four horse riders and then the the
[44:20] four anointings if we don't use that and
[44:22] then point the people to the cross it's
[44:24] just gonna be teaching and it's not
[44:26] going to be applied to our lives but I
[44:29] know I know how many times has God broke
[44:32] me when I'm just teaching on a Wednesday
[44:33] night
[44:33] God has broken me and helped mold me and
[44:36] shape me and draw me to repentance or
[44:38] draw me to Thanksgiving or move me to
[44:41] worship or move me and to praise and
[44:45] adoration or rejoicing and so see that's
[44:49] what that gift is to do is to stir us up
[44:51] but all that gift really does it
[44:54] complements the other floor and if they
[44:56] all work together it turns into a
[44:58] wonderful ministry right it turns into
[45:00] the ministry that Christ said this
[45:02] ministry is going to be here until every
[45:04] bride member is fully mature amen like
[45:08] in Ephesians chapter 4 so we appreciate
[45:10] brother Joe's and ministry very much I
[45:13] just couldn't thank him enough for
[45:15] coming and ministering here and remember
[45:18] brother Branham said you know when when
[45:19] you hear teaching he said that really
[45:21] puts your roots down he says that gives
[45:23] you a foundation so teaching when we
[45:25] teach the Word of God like on a night
[45:27] like tonight your roots are supposed to
[45:29] go deeper right in the Lord and when
[45:32] evangelist comes that he's supposed to
[45:33] stir you up praise the Lord so see they
[45:35] they both work
[45:36] work perfectly together and huh me know
[45:39] this too how many know that miracles can
[45:41] even happen in teaching let me know that
[45:42] what was the series brother Adam taught
[45:45] the deepest revelations they would
[45:46] remember the seven seals remember that
[45:50] brother Bram said and he said never in
[45:51] my ministry have I experienced a greater
[45:55] ministry than the revelations in the
[45:57] seven seals come any number that if you
[46:01] listen to the sixth seal questions
[46:02] answers on the seven seals and the
[46:04] seventh seal brother Branham says that
[46:05] over and over and then he talks about
[46:07] how leukemia was healed that week and
[46:09] all these miracles were healed during
[46:11] the preaching of the seven seals when
[46:13] God is teaching he's still doing the
[46:15] same work by the Holy Spirit so even on
[46:19] a night like tonight God can have
[46:21] healing tonight right God can have you
[46:23] just like they're with brother Branham
[46:25] but he said his greatest meetings when
[46:27] God would openly reveal the revelations
[46:29] and the need teach him to the people
[46:31] praise God those were his greatest
[46:33] services that he said that's according
[46:34] to what he said and I believe that
[46:36] because remember the Holy Spirit visit
[46:38] him every day and shorten those
[46:40] revelations so I just want to make sure
[46:42] I say those things that that's a great
[46:43] compliment brother Joe's ministry is a
[46:45] great compliment we have other
[46:46] evangelists like Qadri Diggs
[46:48] we have brother bender are coming next
[46:49] month and then we have brother Keith ran
[46:51] off the month after that he's an
[46:53] evangelist these these evangelists are
[46:55] supposed to come in here and stir us up
[46:57] and brother Joe even told me he said if
[46:59] the people weren't saying Amen or
[47:01] shouting on Sunday he said I could not
[47:03] have preached because that's the only
[47:04] way my gift operates so I'm glad nobody
[47:07] was falling asleep on brother Joe
[47:09] because he even admitted to me said I
[47:11] couldn't preach like when I go to places
[47:13] and people don't Amen and shout or
[47:15] clapper cries to my dad he said I can't
[47:17] preach nothing gets done because there's
[47:19] certain gifts you have to pull upon that
[47:21] gift right now it's we know it's good to
[47:23] Paul on all the gifts but he said his
[47:25] gifts especially if the people don't get
[47:27] it behind it enthusiastically and they
[47:29] don't raise their faith it's hard for it
[47:31] to operate we're very grateful I just
[47:34] want to say again I really appreciated
[47:35] that ministry by the grace of the Lord
[47:40] now let's go
[47:41] to skip ahead now on part one I never
[47:44] finished the part one I had a couple
[47:45] more scriptures I want to go down to the
[47:47] realities of God so if you got your
[47:49] Bibles I just want to encourage us on
[47:51] this the reality that God records
[47:54] prayers in heaven I just want to go back
[47:57] to the reality of this as we look at
[48:00] this just for a few moments here by the
[48:02] grace of Lord let me spend time I think
[48:03] last week I forgot so forgive me I just
[48:06] and I'm really tired this week I got a
[48:08] headache right now I just just I'm not
[48:09] good enough sleep and whatever got too
[48:11] much to go on I've but God can touch me
[48:13] Amen mate perhaps they'll be gone by the
[48:15] time I'm done all things are possible
[48:17] amen God's my healer a man I quote the
[48:19] Word of God I'll fight the devil off
[48:21] amen remember there's this is the
[48:24] reality of this in acts 10 4 the Bible
[48:26] said and when he looked on him he was
[48:28] afraid and said what is it Lord and he
[48:30] said to him thy prayers and 9 arms are
[48:32] come up for a memorial before God this
[48:35] is Cornelius talking to the angel that
[48:38] visited him he said what is it Lord he
[48:41] calls the angel Lord and he said prayers
[48:43] and alms are memorial before God so
[48:46] there's some there's some memorial
[48:49] there's some witness that we have been
[48:53] praying aren't you glad about that now
[48:55] your prayers there's some witness in
[48:57] heaven that you've been praying other
[48:59] churches might be skipping the prayers
[49:00] or maybe they're just making long
[49:02] pretence of prayers like the Pharisees
[49:04] they only like to pray at church but
[49:08] when you pray you're supposed to go in
[49:09] your closet how many like to do that and
[49:11] when those prayers are praying and of
[49:14] course here when they're sincere but
[49:16] when those prayers go before God there's
[49:18] some record of them in heaven and God
[49:21] remembers them let's go to revelation
[49:23] 5:8 and then we'll read these scriptures
[49:26] here
[49:34] sorry I went the wrong way my Bible
[49:37] revelation 5:8 par me okay this is in
[49:44] the the chapter where Jesus takes the
[49:46] seven sealed book verse eight and when
[49:49] he had taken the book the four beasts
[49:50] and four and twenty elders fell down
[49:52] before the lamb having every one of them
[49:55] harps and golden vials full of odours
[49:57] which are the prayers of the Saints
[50:01] praise gods I'm not sure in this case
[50:03] who had the vials it looks like the
[50:05] beasts had the vowels but they have
[50:09] there's golden vials and that striking
[50:11] God put your prayers in a golden vessel
[50:14] that's how highly he values our prayers
[50:17] amen they're not know would one they're
[50:20] not an earth one ceramic they're in a
[50:22] gold vessel in heaven that's where our
[50:25] prayers go aren't you glad to hear your
[50:26] prayers
[50:26] let's go to chapter eight now chapter
[50:28] eight is the last time the Bible
[50:30] mentions the word prayer because of
[50:32] course it goes to end of revelation 22
[50:34] you know so revelation eight is the last
[50:36] time prayers are mentioned I want you to
[50:38] see what's happening here in other words
[50:41] God is fulfilling every prayer every
[50:44] prayer is gonna be answered somehow
[50:45] maybe not the way we wanted maybe not in
[50:47] the time we wanted but it's gonna be
[50:49] answered somehow revelation 8:1 and when
[50:52] he'd opened the Seventh Seal There was
[50:53] silence in heaven about the space of
[50:55] half hour now I'll just stop right there
[50:56] I personally don't believe this silence
[50:58] has happened yet some people do but
[51:01] brother Branham mentioned the silence in
[51:02] heaven and he said he said the reason it
[51:04] was silent he said because Jesus went
[51:06] down to the air to meet the Saints in
[51:08] the in the rapture brother Graham calls
[51:10] him big fellow he says where is that big
[51:11] fellow then when there's silence in
[51:13] heaven he said he went down to meet the
[51:14] Saints in the air so I believe this
[51:16] happens I believe the actual revelation
[51:18] or the loosening of the seventh seal
[51:20] takes place at the moment of the rapture
[51:22] that's when it's broken or release in
[51:24] its reality form because remember all
[51:26] three seals have three forms right
[51:28] symbol reality and I can't remember the
[51:31] other one but there's three forms for a
[51:32] seal okay now look at verse two and I
[51:36] saw the seven angels which stood before
[51:38] God and to them were given seven
[51:40] trumpets and another angel came and
[51:42] stood at the altar having a golden
[51:43] censer and there was given unto Him much
[51:46] incense
[51:47] they should offer with the prayers of
[51:49] all the saints upon the golden altar
[51:50] which was before the throne and the
[51:54] smoke of the incense which came with the
[51:56] prayers of the Saints ascended up before
[51:58] God out of the Angels hand so these
[52:01] prayers are now applied to this altar in
[52:04] heaven it's like an altar of incense in
[52:07] heaven and then this smoke goes up
[52:08] before God okay so the prayers are being
[52:13] poured out the prayers are all going to
[52:16] be answered praise God
[52:17] God is gonna hear those prayers and God
[52:20] is going to answer them very swiftly
[52:22] because look at the next verse verse 5
[52:26] and the angel took the censer and filled
[52:27] it with fire of the altar and cast it to
[52:29] the earth and there were voices and
[52:30] thunderings and lightnings and
[52:31] earthquakes and the seven angels which
[52:33] had the seven trumpets prepared
[52:35] themselves to sound we know the trumpets
[52:36] all sound during the Tribulation Period
[52:39] and this is the last time prayer is
[52:43] mentioned in the Bible so all the
[52:45] prayers of all the saints and all these
[52:47] golden vials are poured out before God
[52:49] and God smells them how many know the
[52:51] Bible says that our lives are
[52:53] sweet-smelling savour unto God God loves
[52:56] to smell our prayers now that's you know
[52:58] in allegory form and he loves to
[53:02] experience that you're praying to him
[53:04] you're seeking Him you're trusting him
[53:06] amen now I want to look at some thoughts
[53:10] here I don't have these on slides that
[53:14] was actually my last slide but you can
[53:18] just take it off maokai so I'm just
[53:19] gonna be reading off these other notes I
[53:22] didn't have time to put all the notes on
[53:23] here so I do apologize about that but
[53:26] let's look at the notes I want to quote
[53:27] John Wesley here because chapter one or
[53:30] I'm sorry this book by e/m bounds on the
[53:32] reality of prayer opens up with a quote
[53:34] from John Wesley our our messenger from
[53:38] the sixth church age look what he says
[53:40] he said I am a creature of a day passing
[53:45] through life as an arrow through the air
[53:47] I am a spirit come from God and
[53:50] returning to God
[53:53] just hovering over the great gulf till a
[53:57] few moments hence I am no more seen I
[54:00] drop into an unchangeable eternity now
[54:04] look what he's saying here you said your
[54:06] Lea said my life is like a arrow that's
[54:07] being shot over a chasm you see it for a
[54:10] while but then it vanishes he says this
[54:14] he says I want to know one thing the way
[54:18] to heaven how to land safe on that happy
[54:23] Shore God himself has condescended to
[54:26] teach the way for this end he came from
[54:30] heaven he hath written written it down
[54:33] in a book he said oh give me that book
[54:36] look at the desire of his man he said at
[54:39] any price give me the book of God Lord
[54:43] is it not thy word that states if any
[54:45] man lack wisdom let him ask God now give
[54:48] us liberally and upbraideth not thou has
[54:51] said if any be willing to do thy will he
[54:53] shall know I'm sorry he will know I am
[54:57] willing to do thy will o Lord let me
[54:59] know your will and quote hey man
[55:02] and that powerful a church age messenger
[55:05] realizes my life's like an arrow so
[55:07] short I just want to know how to land on
[55:10] heaven shore hey hey man so give me that
[55:13] book give me that wisdom and he
[55:15] recognizes the way to get the wisdom is
[55:18] to ask for it through prayer amen that's
[55:22] what I preached on Saturday brother
[55:23] Samuel asked me to preach on Saturday
[55:25] morning so I preached Saturday morning
[55:27] and I preached get wisdom I preached
[55:29] that thought and I got some good
[55:32] testimonies back from that but I was
[55:33] trying to get the children to see if you
[55:35] can get wisdom getting wisdom is like
[55:37] getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:38] because if you get wisdom the Bible says
[55:41] you have life and we know the wise
[55:44] virgins of course they're wise because
[55:46] they have oil and oil represents the
[55:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:49] so John Wesley saying the same thing
[55:52] that the Bible says if you're going to
[55:55] do anything make sure you pray ask God
[55:57] for wisdom make it to heaven God has
[56:00] given us and showed us the way to get
[56:02] there let me know that way I'm willing
[56:04] to do anything to get to have it
[56:06] amen
[56:07] I like that beautiful thought right
[56:09] there now let's look at supplication for
[56:11] a moment chapter one then goes into
[56:12] supplication that's Daniel chapter nine
[56:14] here I just like a look at this thought
[56:17] for a little bit the word supplication
[56:21] means a more intense prayer it means
[56:27] more restricted and more intense form of
[56:30] prayer accompanied by a sense of
[56:33] personal need and it's limited to the
[56:37] seeking in an urgent manner of a supply
[56:41] of a pressing need okay so let's look up
[56:45] supplication and I'm sorry I'm looking
[56:48] to back up and then it's in Daniel 9 the
[56:51] supplications use probably four or five
[56:53] times in Daniel 9 I preached on that
[56:55] last year you probably member last year
[56:57] at this time so let's go to Daniel
[56:58] chapter 9 it's in there four times so I
[57:03] want to just remember remind you of the
[57:05] the realities of Prayer and one of them
[57:08] is supplication you have prayers you
[57:12] have intercession or intercession we all
[57:13] knows what for somebody else
[57:15] oh brother Adam I'm really gonna pray
[57:17] for you brother Jesse I really pray for
[57:19] brother Aaron I'm really gonna intercede
[57:20] for you that's when you pray for
[57:23] somebody else but a supplication is a
[57:25] need that you personally have that's
[57:28] extremely intense for you you've got to
[57:30] have this okay so Daniel chapter 9 now
[57:36] there in verses 3 17 18 20 23 I'm sorry
[57:39] there's five of them but let's just hit
[57:41] the context here let me get there here
[57:47] alright Daniel chapter 9 verse 1 alright
[57:53] this is the vision of seventy weeks and
[57:55] the first year of Darius the son of has
[57:57] you eros of the seat of Medes which was
[57:59] made king over the realm of the
[58:00] Chaldeans in the first year of his reign
[58:02] I Daniel understood by books the number
[58:04] of the years where of the word Lord came
[58:06] to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would
[58:08] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[58:10] in Jerusalem isn't that great you see
[58:13] how he was reading The Book of Jeremiah
[58:14] and God gave him the revelation that's
[58:17] why we said last week we've always got
[58:18] to read the word we
[58:20] got to read Bible books we've always got
[58:21] to keep reading the Word of God because
[58:23] that's when the revelation struck the
[58:25] prophet of God as he read the Word of
[58:27] God as you read Jeremiah that's when it
[58:29] struck him as he read verse three and I
[58:32] set my face unto the Lord the Lord God
[58:35] to seek by prayer and supplications with
[58:38] fasting and sack cloth and ashes
[58:42] so it's prayer and supplication again
[58:47] supplication now let's go to verse 17
[58:49] now Daniel praise and he confesses all
[58:52] the sins of his and then he confesses
[58:54] all the sins of his father's and all
[58:56] Israel verse 17 now therefore o our God
[59:01] hear the prayer of thy servant and his
[59:03] supplications and cause thy face to
[59:05] shine upon thy sanctuary that is
[59:07] desolate for the lord's sake amen
[59:11] verse 18 oh my god incline thine ear and
[59:14] hear open my eyes and behold our
[59:16] desolations in the city which is called
[59:18] by thy name for we do not present our
[59:22] supplications before thee for our
[59:24] righteousness but for thy great mercies
[59:28] hey my head in other words I'm not
[59:30] intensely praying because I'm righteous
[59:33] I'm intensely praying because I know
[59:36] you're a merciful God amen how many need
[59:39] a merciful God Oh mah constantly we need
[59:42] a merciful God and Dave is recognizing
[59:44] this remember he just confessed
[59:45] everybody sins his sins his moms and
[59:47] dads his forefathers his his country's
[59:50] everybody said he confessed and now he's
[59:54] saying Lord we're something we're giving
[59:56] supplications because of your mercy now
[1:00:00] look at verse 20 and why lies
[1:00:05] praying and confessing my sin and the
[1:00:07] sin of my people Israel presenting my
[1:00:09] supplication before the Lord my god for
[1:00:12] the holy mountain of God and you ever
[1:00:14] think about that look he has to present
[1:00:16] a supplication but church did God know
[1:00:19] what Daniel wanted already of course God
[1:00:22] knew what Daniel wanted God knows what
[1:00:25] you and I want right but God tells us to
[1:00:29] ask anyway because prayer is an
[1:00:31] expression of your faith the Bible said
[1:00:34] you have not because you ask not to see
[1:00:39] God knows what your what you and I are
[1:00:40] going to ask for before we already asked
[1:00:42] but God still wants to see us approach
[1:00:44] and pray in faith to prove our faith
[1:00:48] that we do believe in God amen
[1:00:51] and that's what Daniels saying here he
[1:00:53] knew you realize I had to come to this
[1:00:55] place and I had to present my
[1:00:57] supplication God knows my heart but God
[1:01:00] also wants to see me present my heart to
[1:01:02] him praise the Lord and that's what God
[1:01:06] wants to see with you and I God just
[1:01:08] wants to see our hearts it's not about
[1:01:10] how long we pray and church you know it
[1:01:12] - it's not about how loud we pray it's
[1:01:15] just about bearing your heart before the
[1:01:17] Lord letting God see the very inside of
[1:01:21] you letting your faith and letting your
[1:01:22] you know your struggles come out you
[1:01:24] know and just being honest with God did
[1:01:27] you realize that about prayer remember
[1:01:29] how David and job both David and Joan
[1:01:31] went through awful trials and tests but
[1:01:34] if you read their prayers there they're
[1:01:36] just being honest with God they feel
[1:01:38] like where's God where are you Lord well
[1:01:40] haven't you answered my prayer God never
[1:01:42] sent them to hell God understood they're
[1:01:46] human and they're going through a
[1:01:48] difficult time their faith or their
[1:01:50] faith may be wavering but at least
[1:01:52] they're crying out to me right and not
[1:01:55] bail or astronauts like Solomon did you
[1:01:58] know that's why David was more faithful
[1:02:00] than Solomon and God got angry with
[1:02:03] Solomon not so much with David other
[1:02:04] than the sin with Bathsheba and Uriah
[1:02:06] will see God God got remembers that were
[1:02:09] just flesh and blood and God wants to
[1:02:12] hear us cry out because that's what they
[1:02:16] he had to present a supplication so your
[1:02:20] greatest desire of your heart think
[1:02:21] about it what would it be the greatest
[1:02:23] desire your heart - to see all my family
[1:02:25] my children baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:02:26] that's the greatest desire in my heart
[1:02:28] and so God wants to see that presented
[1:02:33] before him God wants to see me and my
[1:02:35] prayer caused it go in there and present
[1:02:38] this is my supplication Lord let your
[1:02:41] will be done because remember we can't
[1:02:43] force God to do anything right God Jacob
[1:02:46] have I loved Esau have I hated
[1:02:48] you no matter how much Isaac and Rebekah
[1:02:50] prayed for Esau he wasn't gonna be saved
[1:02:51] and I don't laugh like that in a bad way
[1:02:54] but just say like there's nothing you
[1:02:55] could do about it
[1:02:56] God knew he saw would despise the grace
[1:02:59] but the point was God still wanted to
[1:03:02] see your faith remember Jesus still had
[1:03:05] a burden for the rich young ruler even
[1:03:07] though he went to hell he looked at him
[1:03:08] and loved him remember that the Bible
[1:03:10] said he looked and loved him Jesus even
[1:03:13] called Judas friend to see has
[1:03:16] Christians we should even we should
[1:03:18] especially love our enemies as well we
[1:03:20] have to if we've really got the Spirit
[1:03:22] of Christ
[1:03:23] we'll love our enemies and this is
[1:03:26] expressed in prayer now there's one more
[1:03:29] so see this is a chapter where it's a
[1:03:31] extremely high concentration of
[1:03:33] supplication Dan separates himself I
[1:03:36] want to know your will forgive me
[1:03:38] forgive my family
[1:03:40] forgive my church forgive that the
[1:03:42] nation of Israel forgive all of us it's
[1:03:44] not because of our righteousness is
[1:03:45] because of your mercy and he's
[1:03:48] presenting a supplication before God
[1:03:50] this is his personal prayer
[1:03:53] this is his intense form a prayer and
[1:03:55] I'm sorry I lost that little piece we
[1:03:57] fell off brother Joe gave it to me it's
[1:03:59] at my house I forgot to bring him back
[1:04:01] here so sorry it's a little bit more
[1:04:03] sensitive Daniel 9 23 so Gabriel touches
[1:04:08] him in verse 21 and then informs him
[1:04:11] that he came to give him skill in verse
[1:04:13] 22 now verse 23 at the beginning of thy
[1:04:16] supplications the commandment came forth
[1:04:19] and I am come to show thee for thou are
[1:04:21] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[1:04:24] matter and consider the vision see God
[1:04:26] loves people that present their prayers
[1:04:29] before him
[1:04:30] amen God loves people that will pour out
[1:04:33] their hearts and pull out their souls in
[1:04:35] prayer unto God because they're going to
[1:04:40] God for help they realize they can't get
[1:04:42] help from man huh me no you can't trust
[1:04:44] men you can trust there are some
[1:04:46] Christians but but for the most part you
[1:04:48] can't trust men in general we've got to
[1:04:50] put our trust in the Living God amen now
[1:04:53] let's go to First Samuel I want to look
[1:04:57] at a Hannah's prayer samuel first samuel
[1:05:02] 1 you remember this she was praying so
[1:05:07] hard she Eli thought she was drunk
[1:05:13] look at verse 14 first samuel 114 oh
[1:05:16] that's what that's that's the kind of
[1:05:18] prayer that needs to pour forth from our
[1:05:20] hearts Eli said unto her how long wilt
[1:05:24] thou be drunken put away thine wine from
[1:05:27] thee she could have said I just had the
[1:05:29] new wine right she could I'm just
[1:05:31] drinking the new wine Eli don't you know
[1:05:33] about that of course he'd say no cuz he
[1:05:34] was back slipping he didn't eat and then
[1:05:37] had that anointing like I verse 15 and
[1:05:39] love this and Hannah answer said no my
[1:05:41] lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit
[1:05:44] I have drunk neither wine nor strong
[1:05:47] drink but have poured out my soul before
[1:05:50] the Lord amen hallelujah praise God this
[1:05:54] is what Daniel did this is what you and
[1:05:57] I have done right through prayer I have
[1:06:00] come here and God knows my heart I've
[1:06:01] literally poured out my soul to God I've
[1:06:05] cried until snout runs down and it falls
[1:06:08] on a tissue and I've got a scramble to
[1:06:10] get a tissue I poured out my soul for
[1:06:12] the church that God would help our
[1:06:13] church to be a book of Acts Church I
[1:06:15] poured out my soul for my family that
[1:06:18] they'd all come in the message and be
[1:06:19] born again I poured out my soul to be a
[1:06:22] full-time pastor I have I pulled out my
[1:06:26] saw blade on my face and said God this
[1:06:29] is what my soul desires but at the end I
[1:06:31] always must say let your will be done
[1:06:32] not mine because brother haven't taught
[1:06:35] us clearly prayer is not changing is not
[1:06:37] about changing God's heart it's about
[1:06:39] God changing our hearts a night
[1:06:41] remember the one man who did pray
[1:06:44] change God's mind but it didn't change
[1:06:45] cause mine was Hezekiah and then he
[1:06:47] didn't do good with what he did after
[1:06:48] that he basically messed up his extra 15
[1:06:51] years because we just read that a few
[1:06:53] wheat Sunday nights ago so the one man
[1:06:56] who supposedly could move God and God no
[1:06:58] doubt hurt his prayer but it didn't
[1:07:00] change God's mind God just knew it was
[1:07:01] gonna happen and God orchestrated that
[1:07:03] way the one man who actually saw that
[1:07:05] happen he squandered it he didn't do
[1:07:08] like he should have done so ultimately
[1:07:11] Church the greatest thing we can pray is
[1:07:13] let God's will be done not mine that is
[1:07:16] the greatest prayer and it has to be
[1:07:20] when brother Joe was preaching on Sunday
[1:07:22] remember what he said he wouldn't listen
[1:07:24] to the point I brought up when I came to
[1:07:25] the pulpit we must only speak what God
[1:07:29] is leading us to speak because we're
[1:07:32] supposed to speak the word speak the
[1:07:34] word he got power and speak the word
[1:07:35] speak to her go fight Goliath but
[1:07:37] remember brother man said David knew God
[1:07:39] showed him a vision he was going to
[1:07:40] defeat Goliath so that's why he could
[1:07:43] speak the word and so see same thing for
[1:07:45] us we must speak the word that we know
[1:07:48] God has revealed to our hearts right
[1:07:51] remember brother Graham said I never
[1:07:53] asked to speak squirrels God told me to
[1:07:55] speak squirrels I just want to remind us
[1:07:58] with that with prayer because if we if
[1:08:00] we're not careful with Sunday's message
[1:08:02] we'll just start speaking well I'm gonna
[1:08:04] be a millionaire or I'm gonna be the
[1:08:07] principal and next year you know or you
[1:08:10] know to mean things you might just want
[1:08:11] but not know you don't have the perfect
[1:08:14] will of God on there to say what I'm
[1:08:16] saying so we've really got to be careful
[1:08:19] how we speak the Word of God because
[1:08:21] it's not about my will it's about God's
[1:08:23] will and then he got many times what
[1:08:26] does God do Church you know and I know
[1:08:27] it he makes us wait for it he makes us
[1:08:31] suffer because it's through learning it
[1:08:33] I'm sorry through suffering that we
[1:08:35] learn just like Jesus because like I
[1:08:38] told you this before but I've know
[1:08:39] numerous people who said I claim this
[1:08:41] woman for my wife and they didn't marry
[1:08:42] that woman
[1:08:43] it's really sad they were just trying to
[1:08:46] speak the word you understand they're
[1:08:47] they're trying to speak it but not have
[1:08:49] the revelation behind it and that's why
[1:08:51] you know on Sunday I didn't speak I
[1:08:53] didn't come up here and you know try to
[1:08:54] get you and I to say certain things I
[1:08:56] tried to get us to practice and you
[1:08:58] I believe for my healing I believe for
[1:09:00] my big drive I'm overcoming
[1:09:01] discouragement simple things like that
[1:09:03] but when you start getting into quoting
[1:09:05] certain things then you're being you're
[1:09:09] if you're not careful you're almost
[1:09:10] prophesying and we don't want to be
[1:09:12] false prophets at Bride of Christ
[1:09:13] fellowship well Graham said the sky is
[1:09:16] full of so much real let's wait till we
[1:09:18] get something real then talk about it
[1:09:20] let's not try to impersonate it let's
[1:09:23] get our lives in prayer let's get
[1:09:24] excited about the word let's be devoted
[1:09:27] to prayer let's be prayer warriors and
[1:09:29] then the revelations will come and then
[1:09:31] we'll speak something amen that'll be a
[1:09:33] true revelation from the Lord and I like
[1:09:37] what joe said to remember joe was
[1:09:39] praying he said i speak life to the
[1:09:40] church how many want life to the church
[1:09:41] we want more life we're thankful for the
[1:09:43] life we have I know I'm alive I don't
[1:09:45] know about you I'm not dead I know that
[1:09:47] for sure I'm alive in Christ Jesus I'm
[1:09:49] just little tired and discouraged and
[1:09:51] worn out but now I'm encouraged by God's
[1:09:52] grace through the word of the Lord see
[1:09:56] because the Bible said I have peace with
[1:09:57] God through our Lord Jesus Christ I'm
[1:10:00] not at war with God I have peace with
[1:10:02] God because I'm justified by faith see
[1:10:05] quoting the Word of God now I hope
[1:10:09] that's a clear example
[1:10:10] and so the supplication David sorry you
[1:10:14] know rather he has an intense need and
[1:10:17] so we see the same thing here with
[1:10:18] Hannah and I had this intense need and
[1:10:21] she poured out her soul before the Lord
[1:10:24] oh just struck me see her prayers being
[1:10:27] poured out just like the prayers get
[1:10:29] poured out in heaven in the golden vials
[1:10:30] ha ha ha hey man there's something with
[1:10:33] this prayer as a pouring forth of your
[1:10:36] soul amen that's beautiful thank God for
[1:10:41] His mercy now intercession then is a
[1:10:45] childlike confidence in asking for
[1:10:48] others you intercede for others am bound
[1:10:53] says intercession is an enlargement in
[1:10:55] prayer a going out in broadness and
[1:10:58] fullness from self to others so when
[1:11:01] you're supplication it's all about I'm
[1:11:03] just pouring this out from my soul but
[1:11:06] when you intercede you're actually
[1:11:07] leaving yourself and you're reaching out
[1:11:09] to pray for your life or pray for you
[1:11:11] husband or pray for your family it's
[1:11:14] actually a reaching out but a
[1:11:15] supplication is I'm just pouring this
[1:11:17] out before God that he hears it that's a
[1:11:19] good visual to understand that pouring
[1:11:23] out for supplication versus interceding
[1:11:25] reaching out like Abraham reaching out
[1:11:27] to save lot amen
[1:11:29] not but it means he says primarily does
[1:11:34] not Center in praying for us are
[1:11:36] primarily as centers and praying for
[1:11:38] others and refers to the freeness
[1:11:41] boldness and childlike confidence of the
[1:11:45] praying amen
[1:11:46] it is in the fullness of confiding
[1:11:49] influence in the souls approach to God
[1:11:51] unlimited and unhesitating in its access
[1:11:55] and its demands this influence and
[1:11:58] confident trust is to be used for others
[1:12:01] humming no also it's a lot easier to
[1:12:04] pray for somebody and believe for
[1:12:05] somebody more than yourself
[1:12:06] I mean know that it's easy to say oh
[1:12:09] brother Adam come on hum pray for you'll
[1:12:10] be well come on brother
[1:12:11] speak the words have faith to be healed
[1:12:13] but when I'm sick that's a whole
[1:12:14] different story you know that I know
[1:12:16] that that's why speaking the word is so
[1:12:19] important of course because there's life
[1:12:21] and death in the power of the tongue but
[1:12:22] you got to be careful what you speak
[1:12:24] but intercession here is childlike
[1:12:26] confidence asking for others Lord I just
[1:12:29] know you're gonna do it I know you're
[1:12:31] gonna help so and so and you just you go
[1:12:33] beyond yourself and you move out and you
[1:12:36] begin feeling the needs of others
[1:12:38] hallelujah I want to look at this
[1:12:42] Vermeer let's go to Hebrews five seven
[1:12:45] just another familiar scripture like I
[1:12:48] said I'm rehearsing the realities of
[1:12:50] prayer Hebrews 5 7 and I just want to
[1:12:55] emphasize these are the thoughts when I
[1:12:56] read the four chapters that really bless
[1:12:59] my heart now before we read this I want
[1:13:09] let me read what am bounds wrote here I
[1:13:11] like this he says prayer always and
[1:13:15] everywhere is an immediate and confiding
[1:13:19] approach to and a request of God the
[1:13:22] Father in the opening universal and
[1:13:25] perfect prayer as the pattern of all
[1:13:28] praying Jesus said it is our Father who
[1:13:31] art in heaven so the universal prayer is
[1:13:34] spoken to our Father at the grave of
[1:13:37] Lazarus Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[1:13:39] said father I thank thee that thou has
[1:13:41] heard me always
[1:13:45] he says prayer to the father as always
[1:13:48] personal familiar and paternal in all
[1:13:53] praying now let's look at Jesus's
[1:13:56] prayers this is what his prayers look
[1:13:58] like to his father who's in the days of
[1:14:00] his flesh when he had offered up prayers
[1:14:02] and supplications with strong crying and
[1:14:05] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:14:08] from death and was heard in that he
[1:14:11] feared so church we know there's times
[1:14:13] where jesus prayed so severely you know
[1:14:16] at the cross you know where he was
[1:14:18] before the cross and the gardener cuz
[1:14:19] cemani he was praying drops of blood but
[1:14:22] before that even before that he would
[1:14:25] pray and he would have strong crying in
[1:14:27] tears now think about your life I'm not
[1:14:29] here as your hand but when was the last
[1:14:30] time you prayed with tears you were just
[1:14:33] so burdened you were so you were you so
[1:14:36] one of the father to hear you that have
[1:14:38] brought tears to your eyes and you wept
[1:14:41] and cried this is how our Lord cried I'm
[1:14:44] sorry this our Lord prayed and cried
[1:14:46] rather help me want to pray like that
[1:14:48] amen
[1:14:49] I want to pray like that I do pray like
[1:14:51] that from time to time I really enjoy
[1:14:53] those kind of prayers this is what Jesus
[1:14:56] gave us for his example strong crying
[1:14:59] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:15:04] from death amen
[1:15:08] next thought here that's a good thought
[1:15:10] so it's always to the father it's always
[1:15:12] paternal it's always looking to the
[1:15:14] heavenly Father now how many of you
[1:15:16] parents when your children ask you for
[1:15:17] something and you don't give it how many
[1:15:19] you like it when they whine and stomp
[1:15:21] their feet and they don't they're not
[1:15:22] happy with your no how many how many
[1:15:24] parents like that does anybody like that
[1:15:25] here oh look there's no hands sugar
[1:15:27] there's no hands so see that's how we
[1:15:31] are to God right we pray to God and we
[1:15:34] say the Lord we're crying to God God I
[1:15:35] need this God I need this God I need
[1:15:38] this what if God says no does God want
[1:15:40] us to show a pity party does God want us
[1:15:43] to complain about it well God didn't
[1:15:46] hear my prayer no that's why we got to
[1:15:49] end the prayer with let thy will be done
[1:15:51] not my will we've got to end it with
[1:15:54] that and always remember that it is
[1:15:57] God's will that's most important nobody
[1:16:01] likes a whiny brat II child and I used
[1:16:04] to be one I'm sure you did too maybe not
[1:16:07] maybe you're more mature than I was I
[1:16:09] used to feel bad I just have sulking
[1:16:11] party sometimes I do still feel sorry
[1:16:13] for myself sometimes I got to get Mick
[1:16:15] to get over that from time to time and
[1:16:17] I'm sure there's times in prayer where
[1:16:19] I'm not you know I I want something
[1:16:20] really bad and it hasn't happened yet
[1:16:22] and maybe I'm a little impatient but God
[1:16:25] is using the fires of that trial to burn
[1:16:28] that out of me so the next time I pray
[1:16:31] even if God doesn't answer I can still
[1:16:33] say okay father you know best Oh dad or
[1:16:39] dad can you go buy me a brand new Lego
[1:16:40] box litter you don't like Legos anymore
[1:16:43] what do you like Lenny now close books
[1:16:47] daddy can you buy me this series of
[1:16:48] books no Lydia I can't oh that's okay
[1:16:51] dad I still love you anyway that ought
[1:16:54] to be our answer right to God
[1:16:55] Oh Lord can you heal this person they're
[1:16:58] dying of cancer right it's pretty pretty
[1:17:01] serious need Lord could you save my
[1:17:04] father's soul or my mother's soul or any
[1:17:06] need and the Lord would say not now we
[1:17:08] all say well thank you Lord anyway
[1:17:10] I trust you Lord God but see the thing
[1:17:14] God wants to see God wants to see us
[1:17:16] sincere prayer and he wants to see us
[1:17:18] pour out our requests present our
[1:17:21] requests before him God wants to see our
[1:17:23] faith God wants to see our souls can I
[1:17:26] say it like that he wants to see us pour
[1:17:28] forth our souls in prayer amen that's
[1:17:32] right I love Wednesday nights we get to
[1:17:33] come here and pray and I'm in charge
[1:17:35] that and I can pray if I want as long as
[1:17:36] I want but I appreciate your patience
[1:17:39] but that's what I love about prayer
[1:17:41] because it's so personal and God is
[1:17:44] collecting them in the golden vials amen
[1:17:47] hallelujah remember prayer is all about
[1:17:51] worship and asking and receiving so just
[1:17:55] as we ask we expect to receive we just
[1:17:58] got to be patient when to receive it now
[1:18:00] let's go to a few scriptures here let's
[1:18:03] go to James 1:5 again just just repeat
[1:18:05] Hebrews and James were right there in
[1:18:07] Hebrews let's just review some of these
[1:18:09] as well it's very helpful to me I don't
[1:18:12] know about you but when I preached it on
[1:18:13] prayer or read on prayer it helps me
[1:18:15] pray better because I'm focusing on it
[1:18:18] it's right on that's right under the
[1:18:19] throw forefront of my mind it's all I'm
[1:18:21] thinking about is prayer prayer practice
[1:18:23] what you preach live what you preach be
[1:18:25] a real man of God James 1:5 if any of
[1:18:33] you lack wisdom let him ask of God that
[1:18:35] upgraded to all men liberally I'm sorry
[1:18:37] they give it to all men liberally and
[1:18:39] upbraideth not and it shall be given him
[1:18:41] now see there's that word liberally
[1:18:44] that's why brother Brad I'm like Joe is
[1:18:45] quoting brother Branham that's my
[1:18:47] brother Graham could say ask abundantly
[1:18:48] ask God for big things you know what
[1:18:53] brother
[1:18:53] I hope brother Joe is okay with me
[1:18:54] sharing this he was telling me the
[1:18:55] testimony of his church hum you know
[1:18:57] evening like Tabernacle in Louisiana he
[1:18:59] told me when he moved in that church he
[1:19:01] said they were just content me in a
[1:19:02] small little country church and he said
[1:19:04] brother brother Joe said God felt it put
[1:19:06] him on his heart like you need to expand
[1:19:08] this church you can have a worldwide
[1:19:10] influence you this church doesn't have
[1:19:12] to stay small he said he told everybody
[1:19:14] there he said if you think small you
[1:19:16] always gonna be small as it makes me
[1:19:20] laugh cuz we're a small church but God
[1:19:22] could make us larger right but he said
[1:19:24] he kept planting those seeds in there
[1:19:26] and then pretty soon the internet got
[1:19:28] big and so brother Joe installed all the
[1:19:31] cameras for live streaming and then he
[1:19:34] said after that people started moving in
[1:19:35] from all over the nation to support
[1:19:38] their work and now they just built a
[1:19:40] brand-new Church it's got 500 seats in
[1:19:42] it and they hold meetings every year and
[1:19:44] there and he said they're there Easter
[1:19:49] youth meetings that now he said they had
[1:19:50] I think about 450 people there on Easter
[1:19:55] for the youth meetings he said they just
[1:19:57] started off with like 20 or 30 people
[1:19:58] and God just got blessing it blessing it
[1:20:01] and blessing it and growing it and
[1:20:03] growing it I thought my that we just
[1:20:05] have to ask God and God will give it
[1:20:07] liberally now the thing for our church
[1:20:10] is like this this is what I think when
[1:20:12] he tells me those things here's what I
[1:20:13] think I think well that's wonderful if
[1:20:15] it's God's will for us right because my
[1:20:18] man said God likes a variety I can show
[1:20:21] you the scripture I don't have a right
[1:20:22] for me but I can show to you the Bible
[1:20:24] said in cleese asking God's makes God
[1:20:26] makes one man rich and God makes another
[1:20:29] man poor so if God makes you poor
[1:20:32] there's nothing you can do to get out of
[1:20:33] your poverty but if God makes you rich
[1:20:36] there's nothing you to get you new you
[1:20:38] get yourself out of God's richness right
[1:20:40] the rich do some of the money so he's
[1:20:42] ever understand what I'm saying I don't
[1:20:43] want to be limited with limited thinking
[1:20:45] while you're just thinking too small bro
[1:20:46] Jess you know I don't want to Adam and
[1:20:48] Magnus in the meeting with me and say
[1:20:49] you know here's just a small thinker
[1:20:51] yeah that's why our church is so small
[1:20:52] like I don't want that but I do want to
[1:20:55] know what does God think about it that's
[1:20:57] what I want to know and that's why if we
[1:21:00] do outreach and pray if Adam and I on
[1:21:02] bang if we just pray and say God lead us
[1:21:04] you know then we'll see what God does
[1:21:07] now if God gives Adam a bang a
[1:21:10] revelation or something like that and
[1:21:11] they know God's gonna grow and build a
[1:21:13] church will praise the Lord but what I'm
[1:21:16] saying is that that was God's will and
[1:21:18] now God is using Tim Pruitt and his
[1:21:20] preachers on a worldwide level they're
[1:21:23] starting to almost starting churches in
[1:21:25] Japan where Japan never had these messy
[1:21:27] churches ever and God is using that
[1:21:29] church to spearhead it to support it
[1:21:32] financially and
[1:21:33] the gospel in Japan after all these
[1:21:35] years 2000 years it's getting in partly
[1:21:38] because of their church and then amazing
[1:21:41] because that was God's leadership of God
[1:21:44] anointed Joe to have that vision to do
[1:21:46] that and now they do churches all around
[1:21:48] the world I mean they go Europe Asia New
[1:21:51] Zealand Australia they go out there they
[1:21:54] can send people everywhere
[1:21:55] but remember brother Tim has been
[1:21:57] pastoring over 50 years I next this
[1:22:00] Sunday is 12 years for me pastor and so
[1:22:03] it's 50 minus 12 38 I got 38 more years
[1:22:07] to catch up just kidding but you
[1:22:11] understand what I'm saying like in other
[1:22:12] words God he has planted so many seeds
[1:22:14] he's now seeing the harvest and we might
[1:22:17] and I said Joe tommy said you're you
[1:22:19] guys are just in the infancy stage of a
[1:22:20] church we want to start a church not
[1:22:23] because we wanted to because God led us
[1:22:24] to and we're planting we're doing a lot
[1:22:27] of planting we're doing a lot of
[1:22:28] breaking up the fallow grounds right
[1:22:30] we're just trying to get the ground
[1:22:31] ready for planting and plant and putting
[1:22:34] the seeds in there and trusting that the
[1:22:36] grace of God will grow this into a more
[1:22:38] mature larger church by God's grace that
[1:22:40] we can do more work on a worldwide level
[1:22:43] if it's God's will but it always has to
[1:22:46] be God's will because remember Jesus
[1:22:49] even prayed he said fear not little
[1:22:50] flock I mean there was little flocks big
[1:22:53] flocks I mean there's gonna be big
[1:22:55] churches little churches I don't want to
[1:22:57] limit us with little thinking but I'd
[1:22:59] also don't want to go outside the
[1:23:01] perfect will of God so hope think
[1:23:03] everybody understands I want I don't I
[1:23:05] don't wanna try speaking a big church or
[1:23:07] try speaking more Souls I just want to
[1:23:10] ask him and let God do his will like
[1:23:12] brother Branham said I just want to get
[1:23:14] myself in such a sanctified spot
[1:23:16] I believe I'm born again but stay
[1:23:18] sanctified that God can use me anytime
[1:23:20] he wants to use me or they wants to send
[1:23:22] me to New York send me to Iowa send me
[1:23:25] to North Carolina to do some work and
[1:23:27] then come back have me stay in Akron
[1:23:29] picky pastor and I'm happy I just want
[1:23:31] to do whatever God calls me to do amen
[1:23:35] so liberally God gives liberally so we
[1:23:38] must ask liberally if we're feeling led
[1:23:41] that way but God knows why we're asking
[1:23:43] now that's the main thing God knows why
[1:23:44] we're asking for what we're asking for
[1:23:47] because we're sickly verse 6 this is
[1:23:48] where it tells the plainly but let him
[1:23:50] ask in the face of see we can't ask for
[1:23:52] it we have to ask for things that's in
[1:23:54] faith that we know is God's will nothing
[1:23:59] wavering for he that waver there's like
[1:24:01] a wave of the sea driven with the wind
[1:24:03] and tossed you know what my you know you
[1:24:06] know what word I've been speaking since
[1:24:08] brother Joe preached I was really having
[1:24:11] a battle like oh should I speak my
[1:24:12] mother and father be saved
[1:24:14] he was anybody thinking about that
[1:24:15] during service - should I speak you know
[1:24:18] certain things should I speak this or
[1:24:21] that you know you know what I've decided
[1:24:22] to speak in my prayer life I decided
[1:24:25] speak this
[1:24:25] I'm returning to my first love by my
[1:24:28] first works because I knew that's God's
[1:24:30] will for me I knew it's God's will for
[1:24:33] me to return to my first love because I
[1:24:36] feel like I've been discouraged I've
[1:24:38] been discouraged I'll be honest but the
[1:24:41] brand was honest he lied there's times
[1:24:42] brother brand was down and discouraged
[1:24:43] if times brother BAM you know went
[1:24:45] through hard times I'll be honest I've
[1:24:47] been discouraged and I know my heart's
[1:24:50] not in the condition where it needs to
[1:24:52] be in the first love because I've let
[1:24:53] myself be discouraged so I know it's
[1:24:56] God's will for me to return to my first
[1:24:58] love and because I know this church if I
[1:25:01] return to my first love everything else
[1:25:04] will take care of itself
[1:25:05] amen if God saves Souls if God does
[1:25:08] miracles if God increases the church or
[1:25:10] whatever God does takes people away it
[1:25:12] doesn't matter if I return to my first
[1:25:14] love I'm walking the perfect will of God
[1:25:16] and my heart will be pure before the
[1:25:18] Lord that's right and I know that's the
[1:25:21] perfect will of God is return to my
[1:25:23] first love you get over my tiredness my
[1:25:25] discouragement whatever I'm going
[1:25:26] through / me so asking and receiving go
[1:25:31] hand in hand we must ask and then we'll
[1:25:35] receive if we believe we will receive
[1:25:37] liberally God will pour out his
[1:25:39] blessings all right now let's go
[1:25:47] let's I want to go to this thought here
[1:25:48] I want to skip ahead a little bit here's
[1:25:54] another quote from am bounds and then
[1:25:57] I'm getting close to closing yeah man is
[1:26:02] the one more immediately concerned in
[1:26:04] this great work of praying it's an and
[1:26:08] Nobles man's reason to employ it in
[1:26:11] prayer so we must use our reasoning in
[1:26:16] prayer so prayer helps us to reason and
[1:26:19] understand why do we do this or why
[1:26:21] should we do that or what should we do
[1:26:23] the office and work of prayer is the
[1:26:26] divinest engagement of man's reason did
[1:26:30] you catch that the way to increase your
[1:26:33] reasoning well here's the reason I'm
[1:26:36] gonna go this go this way or go that way
[1:26:38] here's the reason I'm going to go do
[1:26:40] this the very way to engage your
[1:26:42] reasoning the best is through prayer in
[1:26:44] other words prayer will give you the
[1:26:46] right reasons to do what you're doing
[1:26:48] praise God it'll lead you with the right
[1:26:50] reasons it'll give you the reasons to
[1:26:53] obey the Word of God and walk in the
[1:26:55] perfect will of God
[1:26:57] he says this he says prayer makes man's
[1:27:00] reason to shine intelligence of the
[1:27:04] highest order approves prayer listen
[1:27:08] this he's the wisest man who prays the
[1:27:11] most and the best prayer is the school
[1:27:15] of wisdom as well as of piety day men
[1:27:20] when did Daniel get all the answers for
[1:27:22] all of his prayer oh when attend and
[1:27:24] again all the answers for his questions
[1:27:25] in prayer correct the angel came in
[1:27:28] prayer all those answers came in prayer
[1:27:32] so prayer those who pray the most are
[1:27:36] the wisest people on the earth now
[1:27:37] remember we said this few weeks ago
[1:27:38] we're not in the competition I'm not
[1:27:40] trying to be more wiser than you and you
[1:27:42] shouldn't be trying to be more wise than
[1:27:43] me but we should be trying to be more
[1:27:45] wise than ourselves right we should be
[1:27:49] crucifying the lusts of the flesh and
[1:27:51] the affections thereof and trying to
[1:27:52] live a more godly life I need to be more
[1:27:55] wise I need to be wiser than I was
[1:27:57] yesterday
[1:27:58] I need more wisdom than I had
[1:28:00] month so the wisest man and woman is the
[1:28:04] one who prays the most and the best in
[1:28:06] other words those who are pouring out
[1:28:08] their souls those who are expressing
[1:28:10] their thoughts before God those who are
[1:28:12] interceding for others like I think of
[1:28:15] that one guy that a preacher in Illinois
[1:28:18] he said to pray for me he said I've been
[1:28:20] bleeding when I used the restroom and
[1:28:21] then I prayed for him that night my
[1:28:24] family prayed for him and he emailed me
[1:28:26] back the next day and said God must took
[1:28:28] some time out of his busy schedule to
[1:28:29] hear your prayers because I come back
[1:28:31] and have a full clean of health and I'm
[1:28:32] not bleeding anymore by God's grace that
[1:28:36] encouraged me because that's what it
[1:28:39] were supposed to do we're supposed to
[1:28:40] ask pour out our hearts for that man
[1:28:42] pour out our heart for that woman and
[1:28:44] expect to receive Oh and it's a blessing
[1:28:47] when we receive it right away
[1:28:48] it's a huge blessing so this is the
[1:28:52] school of wisdom prayer is the school of
[1:28:55] wisdom this is how you get wisdom as
[1:28:58] James said let him ask if he needs
[1:29:00] wisdom ask of the Lord hallelujah all
[1:29:05] right let's go to another thought and
[1:29:09] then I want to get back to that thought
[1:29:10] let's go to Matthew 523 Matthew 5 23
[1:29:24] this is quite a
[1:29:25] I can thaw I just want to drop it in
[1:29:26] because it actually came in Chapter what
[1:29:28] chapter is this chapter one yeah so came
[1:29:30] in this order so I'm just going on the
[1:29:33] order I took notes in here Matthew five
[1:29:36] twenty three now in verse 22 that verse
[1:29:51] 22 Jesus teaches that if you have the
[1:29:53] spirit of anger with someone without a
[1:29:54] reason it's the same as murder and he
[1:29:57] could go to hell so we can't be angry
[1:29:58] with people without a reason and if we
[1:30:01] got a reason we need to go tell them a
[1:30:02] reason right we can't just hold it in
[1:30:04] like that
[1:30:05] don't let the Sun go down upon your
[1:30:06] wrath now look at verse 23 therefore if
[1:30:09] thou bring thy gift to the altar and
[1:30:11] there remember that thy brother hath
[1:30:13] ought against thee leave there thy gift
[1:30:16] before the altar and go thy way first be
[1:30:20] reconciled to thy brother and then come
[1:30:23] and offer thy gift so this this
[1:30:28] scripture is to point out dealing with
[1:30:29] prayer that we must have unity with our
[1:30:35] Brotherhood before we can actually have
[1:30:37] unity with God never to catch that this
[1:30:40] man cannot offer a sacrifice to God
[1:30:43] until he's made one with his brother as
[1:30:48] ever understand it so that's what the
[1:30:52] Bible says as well if you pray and the
[1:30:54] Bible said if your heart can you you
[1:30:56] can't expect to hear from God God's not
[1:30:58] gonna hear your prayer God's not gonna
[1:30:59] answer your prayer but Jesus plainly
[1:31:02] teaches here that if we are ready to
[1:31:05] offer our gift and remember that our
[1:31:08] brother has something against us we need
[1:31:11] to leave church and go make that right
[1:31:14] now let me say this don't wait to get
[1:31:19] here to leave on purpose oh I know I did
[1:31:23] something wrong against my mom at home
[1:31:24] well I'll go to church and then I'll say
[1:31:26] that I've remembered it there and then I
[1:31:28] don't have to go to church tonight let's
[1:31:30] not do that
[1:31:31] that then God knows your heart even more
[1:31:33] right thank God knows your heart is not
[1:31:35] even in it in the first place but this
[1:31:38] is the case where the man didn't even
[1:31:39] remember it but once he got to offer his
[1:31:42] offering Jesus said oh he remember oh my
[1:31:45] brother's upset with me
[1:31:48] maybe I didn't pay him back right away
[1:31:51] he said leave your gift there go make it
[1:31:54] right go pay him go make it right then
[1:31:57] come back and offer the gift praise God
[1:32:00] so this shows that prayer as you get to
[1:32:04] as you come to offer your worship at the
[1:32:05] church as you're praying as you're
[1:32:08] interceding our prayers are only going
[1:32:11] to go as far as our relationships with
[1:32:13] others does that make sense if our
[1:32:18] relationships aren't in good order in
[1:32:19] the church then God's not going to hear
[1:32:21] our prayers we have to treat one another
[1:32:24] with love and respect forgive one
[1:32:26] another all these things we must love
[1:32:29] everyone right and then God will hear
[1:32:31] our prayers is that is that alright now
[1:32:33] let me I want to share a thought here
[1:32:36] and I hope it helps you out I'm gonna be
[1:32:42] real careful I say this that my timer oh
[1:32:46] no I'm gonna call from Florida forgive
[1:32:48] me I'm just calling me from Florida I
[1:32:49] want to share this thought here with
[1:32:55] community this is a thought about
[1:32:56] communion I want to make sure I wear
[1:32:58] this the right way I want to speak this
[1:33:01] in love this is all with love in my
[1:33:03] heart
[1:33:05] so there's times we know communion is a
[1:33:08] judgment seat right in other words when
[1:33:12] you come to take communion it's like
[1:33:15] coming to be judged the Bible said you
[1:33:17] judge yourself right brother Branham
[1:33:20] says like a showdown so when we come to
[1:33:23] communion now we're not having communion
[1:33:25] anytime soon but I may call it maybe I
[1:33:27] don't know I'll see how I feel lead all
[1:33:29] right this is your thought I just want
[1:33:30] to I want to connect communion to this
[1:33:32] thought right here everybody could
[1:33:35] understand this I hope I can say it the
[1:33:36] right way help me Jesus before communion
[1:33:40] comes we should make everything right
[1:33:42] before communion so we don't have to
[1:33:44] miss communion
[1:33:45] does that make sense so all right no
[1:33:49] communion is this Sunday oh I've got
[1:33:51] this against my boss I've got this
[1:33:53] against my wife my husband has this
[1:33:56] against me we shouldn't say well I'm
[1:33:58] gonna skip communion and then just well
[1:34:00] maybe it'll work itself out that's
[1:34:02] that's that's not a good reason there's
[1:34:04] miss communion praise the Lord
[1:34:10] Jesus said when you remember you've got
[1:34:14] sin go to that leave Church I'm not
[1:34:17] telling you leave Church like I said
[1:34:19] don't leave Church unless you just
[1:34:21] remembered if you just remembered yeah
[1:34:22] you can leave Church but I wouldn't
[1:34:24] encourage it you might miss a blessing
[1:34:26] but if it's in jesus's case he's talking
[1:34:29] about yes you would leave it at the
[1:34:30] altar
[1:34:31] you go make it right but you know what
[1:34:32] you should slip out in the hallway and
[1:34:33] make a phone call if they don't pick up
[1:34:35] you should come back and service that's
[1:34:37] what you should do but listen the point
[1:34:40] is we should make everything right
[1:34:45] before communion we should not sit out
[1:34:48] of communion and not make it right
[1:34:50] jesus's whole point is so you can go
[1:34:53] make it right instantly and then come
[1:34:56] back and God will receive your worship
[1:34:57] never understand okay
[1:35:00] just because I've known people in the
[1:35:02] past people I love wonderful people
[1:35:04] godly people wonderful people but they
[1:35:07] just they'll go to every service except
[1:35:09] Communion and Lima at Sheffield I've
[1:35:13] known people they're different people
[1:35:16] albian they'll sit out of communion but
[1:35:19] they'll never make things right they'll
[1:35:21] come to every other service miss Skip
[1:35:22] communites not right is that right
[1:35:25] that's not right because jesus said if
[1:35:28] you know someone has it wrong against
[1:35:30] you go talk to them then come back so
[1:35:35] for example with us we have communion at
[1:35:37] Sundays at 4:00 p.m. whenever we have it
[1:35:38] generally well if you know you're not
[1:35:41] fit for communion you want to take the
[1:35:43] time from 1:30 to 4:00 to call somebody
[1:35:46] on the phone and make it right and then
[1:35:48] you should be here at 4:00 for a
[1:35:49] communion and the church said if not
[1:35:53] you're not doing what Jesus said you're
[1:35:57] letting it
[1:35:57] in there and that you're letting that
[1:35:59] since they uh you're letting the Sun go
[1:36:01] down upon who's ever and whoever is
[1:36:03] upset does that make sense and I hope I
[1:36:06] expressed that in love I guess that's
[1:36:09] the love of God in my heart because
[1:36:10] that's how it connects here our prayers
[1:36:12] are hindered if we don't have unity with
[1:36:14] the Brotherhood but it's not an excuse
[1:36:18] to skip Church it's not and the whole
[1:36:22] point of this scripture right here so
[1:36:24] you'll instantly make it right if
[1:36:26] someone's upset with you if I know
[1:36:27] Aaron's upset with me I need to go make
[1:36:29] that right if I know I hurt Adams
[1:36:30] feelings I need to go make that right
[1:36:32] right the point of this is to make it
[1:36:36] right not to skip Church the point of
[1:36:38] this is to make it right so you can come
[1:36:39] back and have Church and God will hear
[1:36:42] your prayers does that help by God's
[1:36:43] grace that was all my heart I just want
[1:36:45] to make sure I didn't have that in my
[1:36:47] notes but it just kind of struck me
[1:36:48] right here because I was think I was
[1:36:50] meditating on that a few weeks ago and
[1:36:51] it's interesting the Lord brought it up
[1:36:53] here tonight by God's grace so I hope
[1:36:55] whether live streamers or archives or
[1:36:58] here hope that was a blessing because
[1:37:00] that's been kind of hovering and
[1:37:01] meditating on my heart the point of this
[1:37:04] scripture is to quickly make it right
[1:37:06] and then come back and worship then
[1:37:09] gotta hear your prayers
[1:37:10] alright let's close with this I just
[1:37:12] want to close with one more thought by
[1:37:14] the grace of God
[1:37:15] let me find I got to skip down okay here
[1:37:18] it is okay yeah I'm gonna read this and
[1:37:26] I'm just gonna tie this thought in with
[1:37:27] brother Graham's quote about a real man
[1:37:33] okay so I you know I I'm taking
[1:37:36] everything am balance says back to the
[1:37:38] Bible never understand that I'm thinking
[1:37:40] everything he says back to brother
[1:37:41] branham's just so you know I'm pulling a
[1:37:51] but for brother branham just give me a
[1:37:52] moment here there it is okay I got it
[1:37:55] all right now I'm ready now here's what
[1:37:56] um balance says prayer is the real work
[1:37:59] how many know that how many want to work
[1:38:00] today you know what that's really not
[1:38:03] about your real work if you went to work
[1:38:04] today for the Rams or the Bible well the
[1:38:09] Bible teaches prayer is the real work
[1:38:11] prayer is vital work prayer has it's
[1:38:16] keeping the very heart of worship there
[1:38:19] maybe the exhibit the circumstance and
[1:38:22] the pomp of praying and yet no real
[1:38:24] praying right people can come to church
[1:38:25] they can be real pompous and pious and
[1:38:27] there could be no real praying going on
[1:38:29] at all because who's pouring out their
[1:38:32] soul to God praise the Lord who's
[1:38:35] interceding for others there be there
[1:38:40] may be much attitude gesture and verbage
[1:38:42] but no real praying that can happen
[1:38:45] Jesus taught us that if we just repeat
[1:38:47] the same prayer over and over and over
[1:38:48] again it's just the waste of Prayer what
[1:38:54] is this prayer to which men are called
[1:38:56] is it not a mere form a child's play it
[1:38:59] is serious difficult work I like this
[1:39:02] here he says the manliest the mightiest
[1:39:05] work the divinest work which man can do
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:11] can I say like this it's the most
[1:39:13] womanly thing a woman can do it's the
[1:39:17] most feminine thing a woman can do is
[1:39:19] pray in the Holy Spirit amen the
[1:39:22] manliest thing I can do and you brothers
[1:39:24] can do is pray in the spirit that's the
[1:39:28] manliest thing you can do he goes on to
[1:39:32] say this prayer lifts men out of their
[1:39:37] earthliness how many can say amen to
[1:39:39] that
[1:39:41] hallelujah and it links them with the
[1:39:44] heavenly praise God it connects you to
[1:39:47] heaven when you really pray and pull out
[1:39:49] your soul
[1:39:50] supplications or intercede it links you
[1:39:53] up to heaven you feel like you touch
[1:39:54] heavens throne amen
[1:39:56] that's because that's where your prayers
[1:39:57] are gonna go one day how do ya praise
[1:40:00] God
[1:40:04] men are never nearer heaven nearer God
[1:40:08] never more God like never in deeper
[1:40:13] sympathy and true partnership with Jesus
[1:40:15] Christ than when praying and the church
[1:40:18] said you're never more manly you're
[1:40:23] never more like God you're never more
[1:40:25] like Christ than when you're pouring out
[1:40:26] your soul to God and praying and
[1:40:29] interceding for other people there's
[1:40:31] nothing more manly you can do love
[1:40:37] philanthropy holy alliances all of them
[1:40:40] are helpful and tender for men are born
[1:40:44] and perfected by prayer amen so helping
[1:40:48] people all these things loving people
[1:40:50] that's all great but it's all started
[1:40:52] with loving godly prayer you know I have
[1:40:57] some friends that go to a mega church in
[1:40:58] Fairlawn and yes Memorial Day they
[1:41:02] raised $60,000 to feed starving children
[1:41:05] in Africa but my question is I wonder
[1:41:10] was their prayer behind that I hope
[1:41:12] there was by God's grace and they said
[1:41:15] every year they raised for the first
[1:41:16] year they raise ten thousand then 30,000
[1:41:18] and 40,000 not $50,000 and I hope
[1:41:22] they're praying behind that that's what
[1:41:25] we need to do we need to pray and say
[1:41:26] God show us who he can help show us who
[1:41:29] he can feed right show us see we're
[1:41:32] never more like God than when we're
[1:41:34] interceding for other people right God
[1:41:37] show me how I can help Lord make it
[1:41:39] plain I can help this person financially
[1:41:41] maybe I can help this person with my
[1:41:44] time maybe I can help this person with
[1:41:46] my wisdom or the teaching or the gift in
[1:41:48] my life show me someone I can help let's
[1:41:50] we should pray for that tonight before
[1:41:51] we go show me someone I can help with
[1:41:55] the heart of love and I want to close to
[1:42:02] the
[1:42:02] quote you remember this from brother
[1:42:03] branham this is in service we would see
[1:42:05] Jesus 1961 you never judge a man by how
[1:42:11] big his hands is and how wide his
[1:42:13] shoulders is I've heard them say oh he
[1:42:16] isn't a man I've seen men that weighed
[1:42:18] 200 pounds didn't have an ounce of man
[1:42:19] in him that's right you don't measure a
[1:42:23] man by his size that's Brut you measure
[1:42:27] him by his character there never was a
[1:42:29] greater character man than Jesus Christ
[1:42:31] a mule stouter than any man so he or
[1:42:36] elephant so that'd be Brut but a man's
[1:42:39] not how big a muscle he's got I don't
[1:42:42] measure him by that but how the bags is
[1:42:44] in the knees of his trousers when he's
[1:42:48] been praying that's the man that's to be
[1:42:52] measured character let's stand to our
[1:42:54] feet by God's grace I thought that'd be
[1:42:58] a blessing we know and I know you've
[1:43:00] heard that quote about the trousers
[1:43:01] before but why don't we just revisit
[1:43:04] that by God's grace why don't refresh
[1:43:06] that in our lives in our homes and I
[1:43:08] know then that faith brother Joe is
[1:43:10] preaching about then it'll be more
[1:43:11] effective won't it all the faith and
[1:43:13] speaking the word and power of the word
[1:43:15] and speaking of all these promises of
[1:43:17] God that will only be effective if we
[1:43:19] prayed first how many can say amen to
[1:43:21] that
[1:43:23] it is the real work of your life church
[1:43:26] it's the real work of my life God
[1:43:30] measures our character by how much we
[1:43:32] pray how much we intercede for other
[1:43:34] people let's close with that by God's
[1:43:40] grace Malachi you can come I want to
[1:43:42] pray that God to show us more people we
[1:43:44] can help all right you like I said I'm
[1:43:46] thanking for these churches can raise
[1:43:47] Ski imagine $60,000 and one day they
[1:43:50] raised now I don't know like brother
[1:43:53] madam said they may have the wrong
[1:43:54] spirit behind it I don't know but one
[1:43:57] thing is if we pray how many know God
[1:43:59] will hear our prayers too and I'm not
[1:44:02] here to raise a certain amount of money
[1:44:03] I'm just here to find God's will for my
[1:44:06] life what does God want me to do who can
[1:44:08] I help how can I look beyond just Jesse
[1:44:11] Smith how kind of look just beyond my
[1:44:13] family and try to reach out and help
[1:44:15] somebody else who needs help that's my
[1:44:17] prayer tonight interceding for others of
[1:44:22] course also if you haven't given a
[1:44:23] supplication before God recently and
[1:44:26] poured out your soul before God I know
[1:44:28] God would love to have that presented to
[1:44:29] him don't you think so
[1:44:30] God would love for you to present the
[1:44:33] supplications he loved to have you
[1:44:36] present your soul before the Lord amen
