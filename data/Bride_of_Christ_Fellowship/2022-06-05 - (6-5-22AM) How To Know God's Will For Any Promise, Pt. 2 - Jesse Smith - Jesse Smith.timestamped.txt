[1:27] saint said
[1:29] god bless you let's take our bibles here
[1:30] as we're standing
[1:32] i want to just read you part two of what
[1:33] we looked at on wednesday how to know
[1:35] god's will for any promise so let's go
[1:37] to jeremiah 29 11 and go there
[1:41] this might be the last one
[1:43] we'll kind of see how it goes here today
[1:50] jeremiah 29 11.
[2:13] some of the most beautiful uh passages
[2:15] of the scripture
[2:17] you know emma after graduation she had
[2:18] this verse up you know never entered
[2:21] my brother paul and amanda they have
[2:22] this versus their wedding you know
[2:25] it's appropriate for any occasion praise
[2:27] god
[2:28] because god is so gracious and he has
[2:30] thoughts
[2:31] plans for us
[2:36] how many thankful for god thoughts of
[2:37] peace on your life praise amen
[2:39] he's going to give us an expected end
[2:42] but you know we've been looking at here
[2:43] in the last wednesday you know how to
[2:45] find god's will so this gives us comfort
[2:47] that god has a will for us
[2:51] and then he tells us
[2:53] how to find that
[2:54] verse 11 let's just read verse 11
[2:56] together
[2:57] and then i'll read afterwards verse 11
[2:59] one two three for i know the thoughts
[3:02] that i think toward you saith the lord
[3:05] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[3:08] give you an expectation again this is
[3:11] spoken to a backslidden israel who was
[3:13] kicked out of their promised land but of
[3:15] course notice there's a little remnant
[3:17] in there of the backslidden right
[3:19] there's a remnant and god was going to
[3:20] bring the believing remnant back to
[3:22] israel
[3:24] so it wasn't all evil right in other
[3:26] words god deals justly with every
[3:28] individual
[3:29] so if your heart is right with god god's
[3:30] going to bless you praise god yes
[3:32] hallelujah now i'll read verse 12 then
[3:35] shall ye call upon me and he shall go
[3:37] and pray unto me and i will hearken unto
[3:39] you
[3:42] so if we want god's peace if we want
[3:43] god's plan we've got to go we've got to
[3:45] leave right we've got to come go to him
[3:47] that means we have to leave our daily
[3:49] uh our daily responsibilities at some
[3:51] point and find a time to seek god's face
[3:54] we've got to go and seek him now of
[3:56] course this meant physically they would
[3:58] go back to israel the program says this
[4:00] means go back to pentecost amen
[4:03] hallelujah
[4:04] he said that the message desperations
[4:06] he said and i will hearken to you verse
[4:08] 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when
[4:11] ye shall search for me
[4:13] with all our heart now church we all
[4:15] know there's times of our lives when
[4:16] we're really seeking god with all of our
[4:18] hearts and other times when we're not
[4:20] you know we we all know that because
[4:21] we're convicted by the holy spirit and
[4:23] but we also know there's seasons we also
[4:25] know seasons of life where you're in
[4:27] desperation and then then you have
[4:29] seasons of rest praise god and so let's
[4:31] remember that you know as we want to
[4:33] know god's will for our lives in these
[4:34] situations
[4:36] uh verse 14 and i will be found of you
[4:39] so see if we put everything we have into
[4:40] seeking god's will we'll find god's will
[4:43] saith the lord i'll turn away your
[4:45] captivity and i will gather you from all
[4:46] the nations
[4:48] amen may god has blessed the reading of
[4:50] his word you may be seated praise god
[4:53] so looking at part two here and
[4:56] i really am going to try to preach an
[4:57] hour hopefully i really want to do that
[4:59] i preached like
[5:00] six hours last week
[5:02] my voice is really tired so
[5:05] try to take care of myself as i promised
[5:06] someone i would
[5:08] and yesterday we had you know a
[5:10] taekwondo test so i'm all worn out from
[5:12] that you know
[5:13] but i got to take care of my body if not
[5:15] i'm going to turn into a
[5:17] disease-filled person and i don't want
[5:19] to do that i want to be a healthy person
[5:23] so i have some quotes here we'd like to
[5:25] share by god's grace
[5:27] how to know god's uh will for any
[5:29] promise of god
[5:33] we'll just kind of work towards the
[5:34] ending you know the ending is
[5:37] kind of where we ended wednesday but
[5:38] just let me briefly review part one
[5:41] in 2016 i preached on divine healing in
[5:43] the other sanctuary over there and how
[5:45] to approach it
[5:46] and i basically had there's four steps
[5:48] to know just about divine healing if you
[5:50] want to know if god's going to heal you
[5:52] but then i saw that this was actually
[5:53] applicable to every promise of god
[5:56] i saw the same thing if i want to know
[5:58] god's will first i must confess my sins
[6:01] right because the bible says if your
[6:02] heart condemns you god won't hear you
[6:04] but then god god is greater than our
[6:06] hearts amen amen so for rebellious if we
[6:08] won't repent then god will bring us to
[6:11] repentance the goodness of god will lead
[6:12] us to repentance amen amen and then once
[6:15] we've confessed then we must actually
[6:17] ask for god's perfect will because the
[6:18] bible says we have not because we ask
[6:20] not
[6:22] we wonder why is this happening
[6:24] what's going to happen with this person
[6:25] well have we prayed about it you know we
[6:27] desire to see god move in certain ways
[6:29] but have we prayed about it have we
[6:31] actually
[6:31] asked god what his perfect will is for
[6:33] the situation
[6:35] and then third you know we must accept
[6:37] god's will
[6:39] and then act like it
[6:41] now this may mean god will show us
[6:43] what's going to happen or we realize we
[6:45] have to wait for it
[6:47] that church let's be honest most of us
[6:49] we got to realize we got to wait for it
[6:51] right because we're not prophets
[6:53] right god doesn't give us thus saith the
[6:55] lords all the time to know okay i know
[6:57] this is going to happen to my mom this
[6:58] is going to happen to my dad this is
[6:59] going to happen to me it's going to
[7:01] happen at this time
[7:02] most of us aren't prophets amen
[7:05] so a lot of a lot of it is going to be
[7:07] just accepting that okay this is god's
[7:09] will to test my faith
[7:12] this is god's will to try me with the
[7:15] fiery trials of my faith
[7:17] praise god in other words this is going
[7:19] to be an abrahamic
[7:20] situation where abraham had to wait 25
[7:23] years praise god
[7:25] and notice as he went along church god
[7:27] revealed more about the
[7:28] promise at the beginning it was just go
[7:31] out to a land you're going to be father
[7:32] many nations but then it was then you're
[7:34] going to you're going to have a son
[7:36] and then later and then i thought it was
[7:37] hagar then he tried to get through hagar
[7:39] but then it's no it's through sarah yeah
[7:42] so that's called progressive revelation
[7:44] amen
[7:45] thank god that god reveals more about
[7:47] his will as time goes on hallelujah
[7:50] he did that with jesus's birth you know
[7:52] from the garden of eden they prophesied
[7:54] uh uh uh the seed of the woman will
[7:56] bruise the head of the serpent and then
[7:58] micah says it'll come out of bethlehem
[8:00] of ephratea ephrata i always say that
[8:02] wrong
[8:03] the least of the the tribes of israel
[8:06] praise god it'll come out of there but
[8:08] as time went on more and more revelation
[8:11] was about it and that's what we can
[8:12] expect in our lives praise god
[8:14] we can expect more revelation about our
[8:17] lives as we go on serving the lord
[8:19] that's what happened with brother
[8:20] branham right first bowl second full
[8:22] third fall
[8:24] hallelujah
[8:26] and so we got to
[8:28] and church and let me say like this if
[8:30] if we don't know it then we've just got
[8:31] to thank god and know that god will give
[8:33] us the best uh answer for our lives that
[8:37] will make us the best christians praise
[8:39] god amen that's what i mean by act like
[8:41] being thankful even though you don't
[8:42] have what you want be thankful because
[8:45] you know god knows what you need amen
[8:47] amen hallelujah
[8:49] and then just for you what you know you
[8:51] similar to number three but you wait or
[8:54] seek the channel for it to come in now
[8:55] divine healing the channel may be
[8:58] right here the channel may be right here
[9:00] i'll anoint you with oil or brother cam
[9:02] or whether digs or somebody will anoint
[9:04] you and god will just give you faith and
[9:06] in that moment you'll know god heard my
[9:08] prayer
[9:09] or maybe a prayer cloth i still got some
[9:11] prayer cloths under here but those day
[9:13] that we prayed for
[9:14] or it might be just a prayer call put
[9:15] this in your bible read your bible every
[9:17] day take it out you know later on you
[9:19] sleep with it whatever you have to do
[9:21] it might be that channel
[9:23] or it might be the channel of a dream or
[9:25] it might be a channel of just sitting in
[9:27] the service or listening to brother
[9:29] random at home you know it might just be
[9:31] in that channel that god will speak
[9:32] something and then you'll know god was
[9:34] talking to you praise god
[9:36] because you're waiting for the channel
[9:38] you know it's god's will or you believe
[9:39] it's god's will just waiting on the
[9:42] channel for it to come in now does that
[9:43] help by god's grace
[9:45] yeah as i was you know brother amen ask
[9:47] me that question last sunday after
[9:48] service that was such a great question
[9:50] but
[9:50] i thought well i think that'll help the
[9:52] church you know
[9:53] so i thought i'd preach on it at least a
[9:54] few services here uh by the grace of god
[9:58] and so we find out that's this is kind
[9:59] of how our approach should be as we wait
[10:02] upon every promise of god and then i
[10:04] showed on wednesday you know brother
[10:05] branham program was many times an
[10:08] evangelist the holy spirit said do the
[10:10] work of an evangelist yes
[10:12] he pastored for a number of years i
[10:13] believe from 33 if i'm not mistaken to
[10:15] 46 or 47 when he went on the mission
[10:18] field there
[10:19] maybe longer than that might have been
[10:20] longer than that too i think in one
[10:22] place he said he fasted for 18 years
[10:25] so
[10:26] but brother random learned when he was
[10:28] out on the evangelistic field he had to
[10:31] make it seem like the promises were to
[10:34] everyone that anyone could receive it
[10:36] right even though he knew that wasn't
[10:39] the case in other words he knew not
[10:40] everybody would receive it
[10:43] now i i take the different approach
[10:45] because i'm in a pastoral ministry
[10:47] now what if you had to wait on a promise
[10:49] for 10 years and every week i said it's
[10:51] for you it's for you it's coming soon
[10:53] it's for you god's with you and jesus is
[10:55] never late jesus right on time wouldn't
[10:57] you be a little discouraged i mean after
[10:59] a while you might be a little
[11:00] discouraged
[11:01] why is this taking so long brother
[11:03] you're preaching like it's coming right
[11:04] now you're preaching like it's for me
[11:06] like it's for everybody
[11:08] right that's just how it is
[11:11] so i just take a slightly different
[11:13] approach that
[11:14] uh it's your it's your duty and your
[11:17] response and mine too it's our
[11:19] responsibility to seek the will of god
[11:21] for our lives
[11:24] let me just give you an example of
[11:27] you know name we might remember this in
[11:28] beatrice uh on a wednesday night a year
[11:30] ago i was preaching on the blessing and
[11:32] cursing series
[11:34] i don't know how many people was here
[11:35] that's why i know they were here because
[11:36] i remember that they were here
[11:38] and i just got real emotional at the end
[11:40] of the service i don't know if you
[11:41] remember this
[11:42] and i cursed the spirit of depression on
[11:44] my dad do you remember that
[11:48] and believing that god would bring him
[11:50] out of depression because i just talked
[11:51] to him you know a few months before that
[11:53] we had the best talk we ever had and
[11:56] then i cursed uh the spirit of
[11:58] unforgiveness on my mom
[12:00] now she has since told me she's forgiven
[12:02] him so that
[12:03] that was a blessing but the one on my
[12:06] dad hasn't come to pass now how do i
[12:08] look at that do i look at
[12:10] i spoke in the name of the lord
[12:13] but i have to look at it as either
[12:15] either it was god's will now god
[12:17] answered the one with my mom
[12:18] but the one with my dad my dad's still
[12:20] battling that
[12:22] so see how do i look at that you know
[12:24] i've got to look at it like this like i
[12:25] was asking god
[12:28] for my desire i was hoping god would do
[12:30] it that's the only way i could say it
[12:33] i was hoping god would do it or
[12:36] it could be the perfect will of god but
[12:37] i've just got to wait longer
[12:40] right because some of the times when
[12:42] i've seen god move the most was when i
[12:43] was most emotional
[12:46] i've been weeping and crying uh at least
[12:48] three or four times i've spoken to
[12:50] mountains spiritual mountains and
[12:52] they've moved in the name of jesus
[12:54] christ
[12:55] the one was with my co-worker i see this
[12:58] paper bugging me i left some paper on
[13:00] the floor so i'm just gonna pick it up
[13:01] okay nothing to do with the sermon
[13:04] he's bugging me my co-worker her name
[13:06] was nikki and they couldn't have kids i
[13:08] did a bible study at her house and one
[13:10] of the people even rebuked me
[13:12] uh
[13:13] and i just you know i just took it you
[13:15] know just saying how you can create my
[13:17] battles in your devil the devil can be
[13:19] in your mind if you'd be a believer and
[13:21] they said no no and everyone looked at
[13:23] me like
[13:24] you're wrong i was like i'm right
[13:27] and one morning in prayer i just saw my
[13:30] knees on a saturday and i looked out the
[13:32] window i was weeping and crying for
[13:33] nicki and her husband
[13:36] i can't remember husband's name but i
[13:37] said i speak to that mountain of
[13:39] infertility and i command to move in the
[13:40] name of jesus christ it wasn't a few
[13:42] days later i got a picture of them
[13:43] holding up their pregnancy test
[13:45] and they had a little baby girl and then
[13:47] i saw her in fairlawn a few years later
[13:52] after this
[13:57] right by the thirsty dog coffee place i
[14:00] don't know if you know where it's right
[14:01] near cleveland road i don't know she was
[14:03] going in to get a smoothie and i saw
[14:05] right before school i said how you doing
[14:07] nikki she said praise the lord i don't
[14:09] know she said i said that
[14:12] and she said you know how to dream about
[14:13] you
[14:14] that we're going to have more kids and i
[14:15] was like like oh my i don't know i said
[14:18] well glory to god and then i saw her a
[14:20] year later she's she's like uh we just
[14:23] had twins and that was the dream that
[14:25] came to pass
[14:26] so the second one i had nothing to do
[14:28] with the first one i had god had me do
[14:30] something to do with
[14:31] right okay so that's one time i spoke to
[14:34] the mountain the other time was who is
[14:35] dead
[14:37] that wasn't crying during that time i
[14:39] was just believing it because i woke up
[14:40] that morning at 4 30 couldn't go back to
[14:42] bed there's power of life and death in
[14:44] the tongue
[14:45] uh the other then the third time was one
[14:47] that i shared in a point last week my
[14:49] high school best friend's dad
[14:52] died i'm sorry didn't die all the way he
[14:54] had a stroke
[14:55] but when simon said he saw all the signs
[14:57] like gideon
[14:58] and simon come back and said he's healed
[15:01] and i was doubting i just went the
[15:02] prayer clause and i was just crying and
[15:04] i gave god a vow i said god i vow if
[15:08] you'll move this mountain i will tell
[15:09] that man about the message and i said i
[15:11] speak to that mountain of heart disease
[15:13] in the name of jesus christ and i said
[15:15] let tom come out of that hospital
[15:17] completely well and he did like a month
[15:18] later that took a while
[15:21] okay so uh and then i called him on the
[15:23] phone i told him about brother graham
[15:24] he's like oh yeah uh yeah he said
[15:27] too bad god didn't show him about his
[15:29] death in a car accident and i was like
[15:30] okay at that moment i was just grieving
[15:32] i said okay well he pointed us back to
[15:34] the bible and i just tried to end this
[15:36] and the call after that i was really
[15:38] grieved you know
[15:39] but i did my part
[15:41] i told him i told him that you know what
[15:43] god has done for us is god sent us a
[15:45] prophet back to the word of god i shared
[15:47] about the message and he turned it down
[15:48] that's okay he's still alive today
[15:50] church he's still alive today
[15:52] so i'm just sharing that example i know
[15:53] naomi and beatrice would remember that
[15:55] and i preached on blessings and cursings
[15:57] so i've got to take that situation back
[15:59] to here
[16:00] you know uh i spoke against those
[16:02] spirits because i felt really emotional
[16:04] felt really moved and one way god
[16:06] answered with my mom but i'm still
[16:08] waiting on the one for my dad
[16:10] okay
[16:11] so we gotta we gotta judge every
[16:13] situation and maybe in that in that
[16:15] situation that maybe in the moment that
[16:18] we try to believe god's word we don't
[16:20] know if it's actually a revelation or if
[16:22] it's just hope
[16:24] but as i as i ended on uh as i ended on
[16:28] wednesday night let's turn to first
[16:29] corinthians 13
[16:30] if you have the love of god you will
[16:32] hope in the will of god for your life
[16:34] amen amen and that's what i'm trusting
[16:36] in church uh because like i said a lot
[16:39] of times i don't have
[16:40] i don't have a hundred percent thus save
[16:42] the lord i mean it's rarely ever
[16:43] happened in my life i would ever say
[16:44] that like i knew it was thus saith the
[16:46] lord because if so i would be a prophet
[16:50] and then i'd be able to say or a minor
[16:51] prophet which some of you might be you
[16:52] know you might
[16:53] we just have to talk about it kind of
[16:55] remember the situations that happened
[16:59] but
[17:00] i found that most time i'm just hoping
[17:02] or i just have some inspiration or some
[17:04] emotion and i speak god's word because i
[17:07] feel so moved emotionally to do it i
[17:09] recognize wow this is different than
[17:11] other prayers i've had i feel the
[17:13] presence of the lord i feel real
[17:14] sincerity amen i feel real sacredness
[17:17] so we speak the word of god
[17:20] but ultimately i would say we all come
[17:22] back to this let god's will be done not
[17:24] my will be done amen
[17:26] right
[17:27] like even when johnny come up here when
[17:29] he had that ankle problem about a year
[17:30] ago whatever it was
[17:32] he told me in prayer life he said
[17:34] brother jesse i know if you curse this
[17:36] god is going to heal my ankle it's been
[17:38] it's been it's been swollen for a week
[17:40] right and he says it keeps getting worse
[17:41] well i didn't know i just said well okay
[17:44] i'll take you at your word i cursed the
[17:45] i laid my hands on the ankle i cursed it
[17:47] he said the next day was ninety percent
[17:49] better than that that week was 100 well
[17:51] that god's great
[17:53] but there's a time i don't know i'm just
[17:55] taking his testimony and i'm hoping god
[17:58] doesn't
[18:00] but i don't know for sure because i
[18:01] didn't have a vision i didn't have a
[18:03] dream i don't have thousands of lord i'm
[18:04] not a prophet so what i'm saying is that
[18:06] the love of god makes us hope in the
[18:08] lord amen amen that's what i'm saying
[18:10] amen first corinthians 13 7 we end with
[18:13] that one
[18:16] bear so charity bears all things
[18:19] see charity can bear with someone when
[18:21] they're when they're in the wrong spirit
[18:24] in other words you can you can be
[18:25] patient with someone if you've got
[18:27] charity
[18:28] that's why i want to be patient with all
[18:29] the jeffersonville people and all the
[18:31] bride pride people all the prideful
[18:33] bride members that call themselves the
[18:34] greatest of all time
[18:38] you can bear that if you have the holy
[18:39] ghost you can bear people's mistakes
[18:42] hallelujah
[18:43] and
[18:44] and one proof that you love me is that
[18:45] you put up with me to spot my mistakes
[18:47] is that right
[18:48] you can put up with your pastor because
[18:50] you can bear all things you can bear my
[18:51] mistakes
[18:53] right and i can bear yours because we're
[18:54] a family praise god
[18:57] beareth all things believeth all things
[19:00] hopeth all things endureth all things
[19:04] and then we get this great scripture
[19:06] charity never fails
[19:09] hallelujah love will never fail praise
[19:11] god amen the love of jesus christ cannot
[19:15] fail
[19:16] the love of jesus christ will always be
[19:18] there praise god the love of jesus
[19:20] christ is eternal love amen amen
[19:22] hallelujah so if you have a portion of
[19:24] that eternal life then you'll be able to
[19:26] hope for all things
[19:28] and that's what i look at you know what
[19:29] i want to know the will of god brother
[19:31] you know that's another great question
[19:32] when i want to know the will of god all
[19:34] i can do is look at the scriptures and
[19:35] then hope
[19:37] that this is what god's gonna do
[19:40] and then watch and see what god will do
[19:42] and then i must rejoice in whatever god
[19:44] allows to come to pass
[19:46] because it's god's it's god's will not
[19:48] my will
[19:50] and remember just like as a guy i don't
[19:51] want my permissive will i want god's
[19:53] perfect will
[19:55] even if that would mean like hezekiah
[19:56] even if it would mean we would go to the
[19:58] grave early
[19:59] now we're all believing we'll go in the
[20:00] rapture but what if we don't
[20:02] all right what if god jerry's 100 more
[20:05] years to take the message around the
[20:07] world
[20:09] now we want to be thankful whatever god
[20:11] allows to come to pass
[20:13] but if we have the love of jesus christ
[20:15] we can hope
[20:17] for the best and we can hope for our
[20:18] desires but ultimately we've got to
[20:20] trust god he'll give us what's best for
[20:22] us
[20:23] amen now remember here's where moderator
[20:25] said that just so you know he says now
[20:27] we have to preach the gospel that
[20:29] healing is raw yet we know it's not
[20:32] so when you're an evangelist or
[20:33] something a prophet and you're just with
[20:35] new crowds every night you know you've
[20:37] got to preach it oh it's for everybody
[20:38] it's for everybody it's for everybody
[20:40] but then you when you really get down to
[20:42] a church you don't always know
[20:45] for every individual case you don't
[20:47] always know unless god would show you
[20:49] yeah right can i give you an example
[20:50] from bubba's ministry let me i just feel
[20:52] like maybe i'll just go to this one
[20:53] right now because
[20:55] remember this when i preached this in uh
[20:57] the purpose series well that was about
[20:59] three or four years remember who's that
[21:01] anyone remember
[21:03] sister
[21:04] sister andy wright's younger sister
[21:06] edith wright
[21:08] so hattie wright is the sister that uh
[21:10] her husband died and she had
[21:13] two boys
[21:15] and she lived on a land and they had a
[21:17] hill and they just planted crops on
[21:19] their hills
[21:21] and uh she gave brother branham 20
[21:24] for construction yeah
[21:26] on the new tabernacle brother brown was
[21:28] going to give that money back
[21:31] and he was inside of her house
[21:34] but then the holy spirit said don't he
[21:35] said remember that with a woman who gave
[21:36] a few pennies
[21:38] so he didn't do it but he was going to
[21:40] do it
[21:42] and he was telling the brothers about
[21:44] the squirrels
[21:45] and remember hattie wright said that's
[21:47] nothing but the truth amen
[21:48] and he said the holy spirit just blew in
[21:50] that room
[21:51] yeah real sacred
[21:53] and he said give her whatever she asked
[21:55] for and she said what do i ask for
[21:56] brother adam he said you could ask for
[21:58] the healing of your sister eden
[22:01] you could ask for the health of your
[22:02] mother and father he said you can ask
[22:04] for a million dollars he said but just
[22:06] as a witness that i'm god's prophet
[22:09] whatever you ask for you're gonna get
[22:11] right now again
[22:12] hallelujah
[22:14] and she said what do i ask for
[22:17] he said ask for the thing that is the
[22:19] greatest desire of your heart thank god
[22:21] money wasn't the greatest desire for
[22:22] heart amen
[22:26] and she asked for the salvation of her
[22:28] two boys i give you their salvation in
[22:30] the name of jesus christ
[22:32] now god can't force that so see god must
[22:34] have known they've been wanting to
[22:35] repent
[22:36] but they were fighting against it as
[22:38] little teenage boys or preteens we might
[22:40] call them i don't remember i don't know
[22:41] their exact age but bromance said they
[22:43] ran over to their lap with their mom and
[22:45] wept and cried and then they got
[22:47] baptized and were doing foot washing
[22:49] with with all the saints
[22:52] they wrote about it in the generation
[22:53] but brother jose got me yeah and one of
[22:56] the sons got older he was just a truck
[22:57] driver
[22:59] and i think if i'm not mistaken they
[23:01] were going to draft him into the uh he
[23:02] was trying to decide whether going to
[23:04] the military
[23:06] and he asked brother branham
[23:08] and i think brother brandon said go
[23:10] ahead and do it he said you're going to
[23:11] come back and be well i know you're not
[23:13] going to die in other words he didn't
[23:14] want to die and he didn't want to miss
[23:14] the rapture
[23:16] but brother man told him go do it you'll
[23:17] be well he did and he came back and he
[23:20] was well by god's grace
[23:22] but this was hattie's little sister
[23:26] edith
[23:27] now look at her legs look see how her
[23:29] legs are paralyzed and twisted up like
[23:30] that she's in a wheelchair yeah
[23:34] i just want to you know if i hadn't i
[23:36] hadn't preached this for a number of
[23:37] years i just thought i'd bring this out
[23:38] again
[23:40] how do you know the will of god for
[23:41] every situation the reality is you don't
[23:45] but if god doesn't answer that god is
[23:47] letting you know his will
[23:49] his will is not to do an immediate thing
[23:51] it's going to be a test of faith
[23:53] and we've got to act like we trust god
[23:56] amen
[23:58] we've got to act like we believe god
[24:00] amen
[24:02] no matter what god allows to come to
[24:03] pass
[24:05] so remember here's the quote so this was
[24:07] an example of someone who's partially
[24:09] healed but i've heard preachers say god
[24:10] doesn't do partial things
[24:13] right
[24:14] have you ever heard that
[24:16] i've heard preachers say god doesn't do
[24:17] a halfway job god does a full job well
[24:20] that's true most of the time
[24:23] right but sometimes god does give a
[24:25] partial healing
[24:27] because this is one example
[24:30] hallelujah
[24:33] you okay brother
[24:34] yeah
[24:35] i'm gonna say we can pray for if you
[24:36] need hands
[24:39] okay okay
[24:43] hallelujah
[24:45] so it's just an example because you know
[24:47] again sometimes we're given messages
[24:49] like god always wants to heal him and
[24:50] god always wants to do miracles
[24:53] and god god will do exceed and that's
[24:55] true god will do it exceedingly
[24:57] abundantly above all we ask or think but
[24:59] it depends on his will for the situation
[25:04] you're going to see these quotes brother
[25:05] bam fasted
[25:07] and wept and cried for her healing from
[25:10] the paralysis i think she was paralyzed
[25:12] from the waist out if i'm not mistaken
[25:13] that's why her legs are all twisted up
[25:15] like that
[25:18] brother random said in 1959 now this
[25:20] isn't a new ministry this is speaking
[25:21] about the third poll
[25:22] so even in the third poll
[25:25] he's concerned about
[25:27] uh you know wanting to see
[25:29] her get a full victory
[25:32] uh brother
[25:33] amen can you go check on jose he might
[25:35] be in the men's restroom because she's
[25:36] not there real quick you might have to
[25:38] pray for him
[25:39] get him some food or water or something
[25:41] he just
[25:43] looked a little uh
[25:45] sick
[25:48] so brotherham said i've prayed and
[25:50] prayed for that little girl i've prayed
[25:52] to see god healer i've seen afflictions
[25:55] even greater than hers healed now the
[25:57] paralysis
[25:58] i've fastened i've prayed i've longed
[26:01] i've sought the lord with tears for the
[26:03] healing of that little girl the poor
[26:05] little fellow was afflicted when she was
[26:06] just an infant perhaps infantile
[26:08] paralysis that's drawn her little hands
[26:11] and feet so it kind of curls them up
[26:13] right curls up you see her legs growing
[26:14] up like that
[26:16] she suffered for many years and when we
[26:18] prayed the first time for her
[26:21] she stopped suffering that was 26 years
[26:23] ago
[26:27] so the suffering aspect of being
[26:29] paralyzed
[26:32] was healed right away god healed it 26
[26:34] years ago from that
[26:36] i've been in the 30s
[26:38] right 30s i've been 33.
[26:42] when she gets a stomachache or toothache
[26:44] just as soon as i go to pray for i know
[26:46] the lord's going to take it
[26:48] isn't that something the lord will tell
[26:50] i'm going to heal the stomach i'm going
[26:51] to give the toothache but the lord will
[26:53] not tell him i'm going to heal the
[26:54] paralysis
[26:55] yet he's seen
[26:57] congressman upshaw get out of the
[26:59] wheelchair
[27:00] praise god
[27:04] but that affliction i've seen her set
[27:06] here in the building when other cripples
[27:07] would get up and walk away and the
[27:09] inflictions and so forth and wonder
[27:12] see sometimes god is going to let us
[27:14] wonder it's a test of our faith
[27:18] right and then the enemy will come in
[27:20] there and say well see god doesn't care
[27:22] god doesn't love you you're not sincere
[27:24] enough you did it fast enough you didn't
[27:25] pray enough
[27:26] and the whole time it might not be that
[27:28] it might just be god has a different
[27:30] testimony for this individual that's why
[27:32] the thing to do is confess first all
[27:34] your sins amen amen that way you know
[27:37] it's confessed
[27:38] yeah
[27:39] i'm not hindering the move of god
[27:41] because i've confessed all that i know
[27:42] how to do
[27:44] amen
[27:46] but i wonder why don't that little girl
[27:48] walk and i forgot to set my timer
[27:51] oh boy
[27:55] lord and now look he's even talking to
[27:57] the lord lord why don't you appear over
[27:59] her let the angel lord overshadow the
[28:01] child so i can speak thus saith the lord
[28:03] if it was up to me
[28:05] i'd speak it
[28:07] see church it was up to me i pray for
[28:09] every one of you and you get everything
[28:11] you want it was up to me
[28:13] all right but it's not unto me it's up
[28:15] to god amen
[28:17] but it ain't up to me it's up to him
[28:24] now
[28:26] uh this is five years later she passed
[28:28] away and she never got the healing from
[28:30] the paralysis
[28:33] now there he's praying before this
[28:34] meeting this is not jeffersonville this
[28:35] is somewhere else
[28:37] he said i got a message from the east a
[28:38] little lady i knew she's a little girl
[28:40] named edith wright passed on to meet god
[28:42] this afternoon at three o'clock
[28:44] we got to go back if there's anyone here
[28:46] that would like to be earned in prayer
[28:47] would you just raise your hand and then
[28:49] he says i think what's that a couple uh
[28:51] yeah eight months later
[28:53] eight months later they still didn't
[28:54] have a memorial service service for her
[29:00] and now look and then he says afterwards
[29:01] he said i didn't get back for edith when
[29:03] she went but sister wright you remember
[29:05] the dream she had about a couple years
[29:07] ago i told you that i said it's little
[29:09] edith won't stay with us very long now
[29:11] because the lord had already told that
[29:13] she was going through that dream that
[29:15] she had so god gave sister edith a dream
[29:18] herself that you're going to come home
[29:20] to meet me
[29:25] does that sound like as a guy
[29:27] set your house in order
[29:29] for you shall die
[29:31] right
[29:32] about two years later she went to meet
[29:34] god now now waiting for papa and mama to
[29:37] cross the dividing line between the
[29:39] mortal and the immortality
[29:41] mr i just want to remind us of this like
[29:43] uh you know we what i mean we all don't
[29:45] we all look to brother brandon's
[29:46] ministry is just such an encouragement
[29:48] don't we
[29:49] i mean you look at all those wonderful
[29:50] testimonies i look at them we all do i'm
[29:52] skipping back up here to where i was
[29:55] um
[29:56] we all look at those wonderful
[29:57] testimonies and we all want to rejoice
[29:59] in them
[30:01] but we have to remember there's times
[30:02] where god has a different plan than we
[30:04] have
[30:07] and so we got to be open uh to receiving
[30:09] god's plan and how do you know you've
[30:11] got to see god
[30:13] no doubt edith was seeking god so what
[30:15] did god do god sent her a dream it's
[30:16] your time to go you have a couple more
[30:18] years to live
[30:20] so she got a partial healing but not a
[30:22] complete healing is god so good
[30:25] is god still merciful
[30:27] is god still eternal
[30:28] does god still care
[30:30] of course he cares amen
[30:32] the bible says cast your cares on the
[30:34] lord for he cares for you amen amen so
[30:37] god in his infinite knowledge knew
[30:40] in his care for edith it was best for
[30:42] her to get a partial healing and then
[30:44] bring her home
[30:47] now for some of us that could be quite a
[30:49] pill to swallow
[30:51] but we have to trust god with our entire
[30:54] lives
[30:55] we have to trust god with everything
[30:57] that we have how we want to do that by
[30:58] god
[31:00] so i ended with these two conclusions if
[31:02] you already have the revelation then
[31:03] just confess your sins be happy act like
[31:06] you've already got it that's the easy
[31:07] one why shouldn't say these one uh
[31:10] that's the one where you already know
[31:12] what's gonna happen right but the other
[31:14] one is if you don't know the will of god
[31:15] now this is what i find myself in i find
[31:18] myself in this case the most often i
[31:20] don't have enough safety lord yeah and i
[31:22] don't know anybody that does either so
[31:24] don't feel bad for me
[31:26] right don't look down on me because i
[31:27] don't know anybody like that if i did i
[31:29] know they were a minor prophet
[31:34] so if you and i don't know god's will
[31:36] for this or this or that then we've got
[31:38] to daily confess our sins
[31:41] be happy or positive waiting and or
[31:44] hoping
[31:45] and see if god is going to move us into
[31:47] desperation or not for that child
[31:50] or sorry not for the child or for that
[31:51] that desire could be a child it could be
[31:53] anything
[31:55] and then while we're waiting we must
[31:56] worship and trust god with his will or
[31:59] his plan praise god
[32:01] now that's a great scripture charity
[32:03] hopes all things if you're born again
[32:05] with the love of god you can hope for
[32:06] anything your heart desires praise god
[32:08] now i went through our recent miracles
[32:10] and testimonies on wednesday night such
[32:12] an encouragement to us
[32:15] um
[32:17] now here's where brother adam says
[32:19] disappointments can happen as we grow
[32:21] the knowledge of god so how do you know
[32:23] when you're first in order how many know
[32:25] that in order to get in the kingdom of
[32:27] god you must become like a child
[32:29] but then the bible says move on from
[32:32] childhood to maturity amen so i found
[32:35] this when i was a younger christian i
[32:36] just thought well god's going to do all
[32:37] these miracles he's bringing in my whole
[32:39] family if he brought in simon and cam
[32:41] and me and he's bringing in everybody
[32:42] he's bringing my mom i mean i just i i
[32:44] thought and then when we had seven
[32:46] people in akron we started the church i
[32:47] thought man if god's given us seven
[32:49] souls in a couple years we'll have like
[32:50] 49 souls
[32:52] now we're actually getting pretty close
[32:53] to that
[32:54] with all these babies and these
[32:56] blessings and god said in austin lena
[32:58] back and god said to people from ghana
[33:00] all the way across the ocean
[33:02] that's a blessing
[33:03] but you know uh
[33:06] i i had a certain way where i thought
[33:08] god was gonna do it but god doesn't work
[33:10] to my way i want god to work in his way
[33:12] praise god
[33:13] but i have to learn that
[33:15] i have to grow in knowledge which means
[33:16] understanding
[33:18] i have to understand that god's
[33:20] that god's not always going to do what i
[33:22] want to do god's going to do what's best
[33:23] for me
[33:25] so sometimes church will have
[33:27] disappointments down through life
[33:30] with divine healing like with sister
[33:31] edith
[33:33] or other other situations in our life
[33:35] like with my dad not being saved yet
[33:38] since i was a boy
[33:40] i prayed for him to stop smoking
[33:43] and serve god so it's a boy i'm 40 i'm
[33:45] almost 42.
[33:47] so that was 8 or 10. so let's just say
[33:48] 10. so for 32 years i pray god help him
[33:51] to stop smoking and every time i see him
[33:53] he keeps smoking and keeps getting worse
[33:54] and worse
[33:56] what does that mean does that mean i'm a
[33:57] sinner and that's my fault that he's
[33:59] still smoking no
[34:01] every man has three more agency that's
[34:03] right
[34:04] all i can do is hope if i've got the
[34:06] love of god i'll keep hoping amen
[34:11] what can i do i prayed now for let's see
[34:14] my parents divorced when i was probably
[34:15] 12 or 13 in middle school so
[34:18] i prayed for all these years 30 years
[34:19] for them to get back together
[34:22] uh i don't know if it'll happen but i'm
[34:24] leaving in the hands of god all i can do
[34:26] is hope
[34:30] so we're going to have disappointments
[34:31] as we grow in the knowledge of god but
[34:33] we've got to still worship god despite
[34:35] our disappointments
[34:38] now remember in the sermon works as
[34:40] faith expressed i just copied these over
[34:41] from that 2016 sermon this whole sermon
[34:44] was a compilation or a combination of
[34:46] what brother adam had learned about
[34:48] divine healing over decades of preaching
[34:52] he says uh we're old men we've been in
[34:54] this a long time we've seen the pros and
[34:56] cons and everything and praying for the
[34:58] sick around the world and seeing the
[34:59] disappointments of people so wow brother
[35:03] i would pray for the sick and some
[35:04] people will be disappointed but then
[35:06] he'd pray for the sick and he'd see
[35:07] hallelujah amen
[35:10] that's why i've got to be encouraged if
[35:11] i pray for people and they don't get
[35:12] well i just got to have courage now
[35:15] the devil will attack me and say it's
[35:16] your fault
[35:18] well i'll say well i just confess my
[35:19] sins right here
[35:21] it can't be my fault
[35:23] the only way of being my fault is if i
[35:24] uh if i didn't ask them to forgive their
[35:26] sins first like like moses right
[35:28] moses uh used his gift without without
[35:31] the right uh spirit without without
[35:33] confessing his sins right
[35:35] and then i get in trouble with god for
[35:36] that that could be
[35:37] but if i confess all my sins it is isn't
[35:39] my fault god's will is something
[35:41] different for their life than what i
[35:42] thought it was going to be
[35:44] and what they thought it was going to be
[35:48] then all this church we learn by
[35:51] see that's why you know with message
[35:53] churches that they are still saying all
[35:54] the time god wants to heal all the time
[35:56] it's always god's will for miracles that
[35:57] means they haven't learned
[36:00] right and i'm not doubting them i'm just
[36:02] saying we've got to come to a place of
[36:03] maturity
[36:05] that whether god gives or god takes away
[36:07] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[36:11] we've got to get to the spot where we
[36:13] want god's will more than our own will
[36:15] praise god amen
[36:18] we're and we're god's helping us we're
[36:20] growing to this spot where we can trust
[36:22] god that god's timing is better than our
[36:24] timing
[36:29] like you know i've recently talked to
[36:30] austin he's come back and we've talked
[36:31] about he's telling me about all the
[36:33] things he desires god to do in his life
[36:36] wonderful desires and each one all we
[36:38] can say is brother if it's the will of
[36:40] god it'll come to pass
[36:42] right i told austin well i wish the lord
[36:44] would do this in my life and what god
[36:46] did this and i really want to do this
[36:47] and i like to travel and started you
[36:50] know uh not start start more like
[36:52] missionary work i told austin all these
[36:54] things that if we could just get a break
[36:55] you know
[36:57] amen you and i have talked about it we
[36:59] have all these desires
[37:01] but we've got to learn as time goes on
[37:04] we got to learn that we might have some
[37:05] disappointments and things that we
[37:07] thought but that's okay it's god it's
[37:09] god accomplishing his will it's god
[37:12] bringing us to his thoughts it's god
[37:14] giving us the mind of christ amen
[37:18] he said just like you're learning to
[37:19] swim you know you splash the water and
[37:21] grow go across across the pool and say
[37:24] i made her
[37:26] now after you learn to swim you're more
[37:28] graceful is the stroke and it don't wear
[37:29] you out so much
[37:31] see that's it you learn how to do it and
[37:32] cut every corner make it better and
[37:35] that's more of an easy
[37:38] so so it is with divine healing so it is
[37:40] with every question in our life it
[37:42] should become easier can i say like this
[37:44] it should become easier to wait on the
[37:46] lord for his answer
[37:48] because we're more mature now
[37:51] we're not like a baby like i gotta have
[37:53] it now i gotta have it now right
[37:55] that's how we were when we're young
[37:56] christians
[37:58] i've gotta have a miracle i've gotta do
[38:00] this i i have to see this i have to know
[38:02] this i have to know this
[38:04] no i've got to know god
[38:06] i've got to know god's will that's what
[38:08] i've got to know
[38:11] we're talking about going from milk to
[38:13] meat
[38:16] praise god amen
[38:18] so the christian life should become more
[38:21] easy
[38:22] right in other words i'll commit this in
[38:25] the hands of god i'll be neutral
[38:28] and whatever god desires
[38:30] i'm gonna let god do it my life
[38:33] now there are going to be times like
[38:35] paul when you have the anointing on you
[38:36] he had power to command that demonic
[38:39] spirit to leave that
[38:40] woman of divination right he waited for
[38:43] many days and she kept saying these are
[38:44] the true servants of god
[38:46] he was grieved and finally said thou
[38:48] fall spirit come out of her in the name
[38:50] of jesus christ now that's commandment
[38:53] so we we can be led of course we can
[38:55] always be led into those types of things
[38:56] or i speak to that uh the swelling ankle
[38:59] right in the name of jesus christ i
[39:00] rebuked that
[39:01] there was going to be moments with that
[39:03] but there's also been moments where
[39:04] we've got to wait on the lord
[39:11] you can say like this there's going to
[39:12] be times of lightning flashes and
[39:15] thunder roars emotional ties that's what
[39:17] i'm talking about
[39:18] but there's going to be times of gentle
[39:20] times too just waiting on the lord
[39:22] just trusting in the lord
[39:24] mighty shouts and mighty miracles and
[39:26] everybody clapping and screaming and
[39:27] crying
[39:29] there's gonna be times
[39:30] i've just got to trust god in this
[39:31] situation
[39:33] i'm committing this to god
[39:38] see we got to learn how many are happy
[39:39] to learn
[39:43] he said we see the same thing with
[39:44] preaching divine healing or anything
[39:46] else as you go along you begin to learn
[39:48] if you don't learn there's something
[39:49] wrong yeah
[39:52] see you've got to learn you've got to
[39:53] learn how to accept god and what it
[39:56] really means
[40:00] so the church that will mean we might
[40:02] have to look back at certain things that
[40:03] we're bothered about like why hasn't god
[40:05] done this or why hasn't god healed that
[40:07] person why does god save my dad why all
[40:09] these things we gotta look back that and
[40:11] accept god for what god is doing
[40:15] right we gotta look back and say lord
[40:17] maybe i've been bitter maybe i've been
[40:19] impatient forgive me for being impatient
[40:24] what do you really mean lord by the fact
[40:26] you haven't answered my prayers what do
[40:28] you really mean and of course what it
[40:30] means is god loves you still
[40:33] but god is either waiting giving that
[40:34] person time to repent
[40:36] or god is molding you to have more
[40:38] patience and the church said
[40:41] who doesn't need more patience
[40:44] lydia i could have a prayer line every
[40:45] service all right all you people that
[40:46] need patience come and get them to the
[40:47] prayer line everybody would everybody
[40:49] would get luck
[40:50] i'd annoy everyone with the oil and then
[40:51] i
[40:52] turn around and say hey man pray for me
[40:53] for patience right yeah every service
[40:55] yes
[40:57] we need more patience because we want it
[40:58] now
[41:00] just like you want that reply on the
[41:02] text what are they gonna text me back
[41:03] what are they gonna text me back
[41:05] when are they going to email me back are
[41:06] they going to answer me
[41:07] you know just we were you're used to
[41:09] that
[41:10] slayer to see them but we've got to
[41:12] learn to accept god's ways god's timing
[41:14] amen amen and what god really means
[41:20] i love this quote i hope i hope i always
[41:22] preach this to you and i hope you can
[41:24] always say amen to this quote
[41:26] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[41:29] signs of god's disapproval
[41:32] amen are the bright skies like we had
[41:35] him yesterday boy when a beautiful day
[41:37] yesterday
[41:38] and still waters signs of his love and
[41:41] approval
[41:44] his approval of any of us is only in the
[41:46] beloved it's from the bosom in other
[41:48] words in the heart of god
[41:51] his love is elected where that means
[41:53] means chosen his love his love is chosen
[41:56] which he had for us before the
[41:58] foundation of the world amen
[42:01] does he love us ah yes
[42:04] but how shall we know
[42:06] we shall know because the bible says so
[42:09] amen and manifest that he did love us
[42:13] for us
[42:15] i'm sorry i did love us for he brought
[42:17] us to himself and gave us his spirit
[42:20] placing us as sons amen
[42:22] how do i know god loves me the bible
[42:25] says so and he saved me he sanctified me
[42:27] he filled me with the holy ghost he gave
[42:29] me a church that loves jesus amen
[42:32] that's how i know he loves me amen
[42:34] hallelujah
[42:36] and he's placed me as a son
[42:39] i'm learning how to handle the father's
[42:41] business hallelujah
[42:43] glory
[42:45] he raised you up as a daughter of god a
[42:47] child of god and you're learning how to
[42:49] handle your father's business hallelujah
[42:52] amen
[42:55] and how shall i prove my love to god
[42:58] by believing what he said
[43:01] and by conducting myself with joy
[43:04] their joy in the house of the lord
[43:07] their joy in the house of the lord she's
[43:10] like yeah
[43:12] that's my song amen
[43:14] god inspired phil for me on that one
[43:17] how am i going to prove my love to him
[43:20] by believing what he said
[43:22] and acting with joy
[43:25] amidst the trials
[43:27] that he and his wisdom
[43:29] allows to come to pass
[43:32] god cannot tempt any man but god does
[43:35] give permission to satan attempt a man
[43:40] but he says you cannot take his life in
[43:42] many cases right in other words you can
[43:44] only go this far satan
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:47] aren't you glad god hasn't uh god hasn't
[43:49] hold your card yet amen
[43:51] you're still here by the grace of god
[43:53] amen fighting the battles amen god can
[43:56] still trust you praise god his wisdom
[43:58] has allowed different things to come to
[44:00] pass uh we might have disappointment but
[44:02] we're still trusting god we're still
[44:04] believing god we're looking for more
[44:05] revelation amen
[44:08] of the will of god for our eyes amen
[44:12] like that list i gave you what greater
[44:14] miracle could we have in austerlina
[44:16] getting saved
[44:18] or did the children get baptized last
[44:20] year what what greater miracle is there
[44:24] right then if stephanie gets a hopefully
[44:25] she's watching god bless you
[44:28] or mj or some of these ones what greater
[44:30] miracle could there be
[44:32] than to see a soul
[44:34] go from a heart of stone to a heart of
[44:36] flesh and then watch as the holy spirit
[44:39] service after service writes his will
[44:41] upon the fleshly tables of their hearts
[44:44] and they learn to love god and serve god
[44:46] and serve with joy in the midst of their
[44:48] trials
[44:50] because none of us are except from
[44:52] trials
[44:54] if you are you're not a child of god
[44:56] you're a faster child of god if you have
[44:58] no trials
[44:59] but if you have trials then surely you
[45:00] know i'm a child of god
[45:02] thank you jesus for the trials amen
[45:05] thanks for correcting me and chasing me
[45:07] and helping me to love you more praise
[45:09] god
[45:14] that's one thing we all know about god
[45:15] he's wise
[45:17] and he orchestrates all the events of
[45:19] our life
[45:20] so that we'll learn to serve him with
[45:22] joy
[45:23] and it should get easier all the time
[45:26] amen
[45:27] amen with ease we should be able to now
[45:30] swim with ease now swimming is still
[45:32] hard work how many know that yeah and
[45:34] some of you are scared of the water i
[45:35] understand
[45:36] i was we had uh we had zion walking
[45:38] around the pond last sunday you know
[45:41] i was a nervous wreck
[45:44] come on don't fall in you know
[45:47] but it's still hard work right christian
[45:49] life is still hard work but it should
[45:51] get better
[45:52] yeah we should know what we're doing we
[45:54] should have better techniques
[45:57] we should have a better a better
[45:59] understanding of how to navigate these
[46:00] trials
[46:03] i know god has allowed this i know god's
[46:05] for me i know i'm a child of god i know
[46:07] i'm going to heaven
[46:09] i know i'm forgiven by the blood of
[46:10] jesus christ but god's allowed me to be
[46:12] tested
[46:17] so what does brother adam say before you
[46:19] try to fulfill any promise of god he
[46:21] says first get in the spirit
[46:24] revelation 1 verse 10 says i was in the
[46:26] spirit on the lord's day in other words
[46:28] get under his anointing by seeking him
[46:31] that's the only way to get on the
[46:32] anointing remember praise it pray praise
[46:34] god when you're when you're privatized
[46:36] with god praise god because he inhabits
[46:38] the praises of his people
[46:42] it's a promise if you start praising god
[46:44] eventually god's gonna come anoint you
[46:46] praise god
[46:48] as you're seeking his face
[46:52] remember bibraham says i'm gonna skip
[46:53] down here this is what we read earlier
[46:57] he says others get healing just by grace
[46:59] it's just given to them there's and
[47:00] there's the difference see that does it
[47:01] that's the real revelation because faith
[47:03] is a revelation from god it must be
[47:05] revealed first
[47:07] so before someone can know they're going
[47:08] to be healed it must be revealed first
[47:11] before someone can know their loved
[47:13] one's going to be saved it's got to be
[47:14] revealed by god first
[47:16] the revelation has to come first and
[47:18] revelation comes when you get in the
[47:20] spirit amen
[47:22] hallelujah now these are familiar quotes
[47:24] but i read these years ago i'm going to
[47:25] keep reading again and i hope you keep
[47:27] saying amen to them
[47:29] i was in the spirit isn't that just
[47:30] beautiful my i love that you could just
[47:33] call those words the whole of the
[47:35] christian life
[47:38] if we're going to live as christians we
[47:40] have to be in his spirit
[47:42] john was not talking about being in his
[47:44] own spirit that would have not brought
[47:46] these visions it had to be the spirit of
[47:48] god it has to be the spirit of god with
[47:50] us too or all our efforts are in vain
[47:53] paul said i will pray in the spirit i'll
[47:55] sing in the spirit i'll live in the
[47:57] spirit if there's any good thing that
[47:59] will come to me it has to be revealed by
[48:01] the spirit confirmed by the word so see
[48:04] you get you have you're in the spirit
[48:06] and then that spirit will remind you of
[48:07] a verse
[48:11] and may manifest by the results it bears
[48:15] as surely as john need to be in the
[48:16] spirit to receive these tremendous
[48:18] revelations fresh from jesus we need to
[48:21] be in the spirit to understand the
[48:22] revelations that god has given to us to
[48:24] live by in his word for it is the same
[48:27] spirit how many one live for jesus amen
[48:30] he just told you if you would have lived
[48:31] by the words of jesus get in the spirit
[48:33] first amen that's why we have a song
[48:36] service first buddy
[48:38] that's why we have specials up there to
[48:39] get you in the spirit so that when the
[48:41] word of god comes you can receive it
[48:44] you can live by it
[48:47] you can walk out of here living by the
[48:49] word that you heard
[48:54] he said look at it this way all too many
[48:56] read where it says acts 2 38 and just
[48:59] pass right on they don't see it if they
[49:01] saw it by getting the spirit they would
[49:03] know if they want to receive the holy
[49:04] spirit they need to repent be baptized
[49:06] in the name of the lord jesus
[49:08] and then god would be duty-bound to
[49:10] fulfill his word by filling them with
[49:12] the holy ghost
[49:14] they never get in his spirit or it
[49:15] happened to them exactly as the word
[49:18] says
[49:19] pray to god for revelation by spirit
[49:21] that is the first step get in the spirit
[49:23] so what's the first step pray
[49:25] right worship sing
[49:28] glorify god get in the spirit and then
[49:32] start going to work on the work of god
[49:34] i'm sorry the word of god then start
[49:36] acting upon the word of god but first
[49:38] pray first worship at first get under
[49:41] that anointing and then start obeying
[49:42] the word of god
[49:46] now let me use another illustration by
[49:48] the man says suppose you need healing
[49:50] what does the word say well we've all
[49:52] read it countless times but did not get
[49:54] in the spirit when reading it
[49:57] did we ask god for our spirit to teach
[49:58] us the real truth of it
[50:00] if we did we would call the elders
[50:03] confess our sins be anointed and pray
[50:05] for and that would be that
[50:09] it might not come immediately yeah the
[50:12] church said amen
[50:13] but it is spirit it is all over yes yes
[50:17] now see we would be hoping right we're
[50:19] hoping unless it was a direct revelation
[50:21] to us we're hoping it's all over
[50:24] right because again you have to look
[50:26] like eateth right you've got to see god
[50:27] for every situation ever for each and e
[50:30] for each life every individual life
[50:32] you've got to see god for your own will
[50:34] of god's will for your life sorry i'm
[50:36] going to cut it up there may the holy
[50:37] spirit give you revelation what i said
[50:40] every individual has to seek god for
[50:42] god's will for their life
[50:45] there's no other court of appeal
[50:47] god will fulfill his word oh we need to
[50:50] get in the spirit and then things will
[50:51] be done don't go through the acts first
[50:54] get in the spirit and then go through
[50:55] the acts and watch what god will do yes
[50:58] amen
[50:59] have you noticed how the world gets in
[51:01] the spirit of things that are in the
[51:02] world
[51:03] they go to their ball games their
[51:04] sporting events their dances they enter
[51:06] to the spirit of it they don't sit there
[51:08] like wall flowers old dried up sticks
[51:10] they enter right into the feel of things
[51:12] become a part of things but oh how they
[51:14] hate the christians for getting in the
[51:16] spirit of god's word
[51:17] they call us fanatics and holy rollers
[51:19] there's nothing they won't do to show
[51:21] their hatred and disapproval but ignore
[51:23] that
[51:24] i said ignore that amen
[51:27] ignore criticism ignore satan's voice in
[51:29] your mind where god's not doing anything
[51:31] and god doesn't hear your prayers ignore
[51:33] that he said you can expect it but
[51:35] knowing where it's coming from just go
[51:37] on and get in the spirit of worship amen

[52:47] we've all felt and know when the church
[52:48] is on fire then the church is struggling
[52:52] right we've gone through all these times
[52:54] so what is our response our response is
[52:56] to trust god
[52:58] confess our sins and get in the spirit
[53:00] praise god
[53:02] i live in the good times for the bad
[53:04] times this is our response we've got to
[53:06] trust god we've got to wait on god we've
[53:08] got to let god perfect us amen he's
[53:11] doing something right now in our lives
[53:13] we've got to trust god we've got to
[53:14] learn from god we've got to believe god
[53:17] hallelujah amen
[53:18] amen
[53:22] there was a time about a year or two ago
[53:24] remember brother and it was like i was
[53:26] preaching just every sunday and it was
[53:27] like we were everybody was shouting and
[53:29] it was such a
[53:31] such a atmosphere remember that i mean
[53:33] brother johnny was here and
[53:34] uh
[53:35] everybody was shouting everybody was it
[53:37] was just a tremendous anointing
[53:40] and we wonder how long will that last
[53:43] now here we are we're the same church
[53:45] what's wrong nothing's wrong we just go
[53:47] through seasons
[53:48] we go through trials
[53:50] we go through tests
[53:53] but we don't criticize others when we do
[53:55] when we go through difficult seasons we
[53:57] lift them up
[53:59] we don't get prideful we get huggable
[54:01] praise god
[54:04] and wait as we know god's going to
[54:06] restore
[54:08] right
[54:12] like i'll
[54:14] always remember that when
[54:15] brother bill sanchez up there in
[54:17] sheffield when we first came in the
[54:18] message we went to their church in 2004
[54:23] it would have been 2002 2003.
[54:29] and he said just having college people
[54:31] sitting on the front row standing up
[54:33] clapping brought their church a revival
[54:37] and he thanked me for that while we were
[54:38] sitting at his wife's funeral
[54:40] with her open cast right there she told
[54:42] my wife and i right there
[54:44] right by his dead way
[54:46] thank you for those 20 years ago thank
[54:47] you guys for coming our church god
[54:49] brought a revival our church was dying
[54:51] we needed a life and god sent life into
[54:53] the church
[54:54] the church that's just a reminder
[54:56] god's going to bring it back praise god
[54:58] if you're struggling it's just a season
[55:00] yeah it's just it's just fall it's just
[55:02] winter my spring is coming amen
[55:05] a new day's coming amen god is faithful
[55:08] gotta restart if you are a revival god
[55:10] will bring it to you
[55:12] hallelujah
[55:14] the whole time really amen all i knew
[55:15] was acts 2 38 and yet i was revival
[55:18] they could say where's revival in
[55:20] sheffield it's right here praise god
[55:23] where's the revival in africa right here
[55:24] right now
[55:26] amen hallelujah
[55:28] but we're waiting on god we're learning
[55:34] we have to ignore criticism from satan
[55:38] and other people
[55:40] now daily i get criticism on youtube so
[55:42] i'm learning to live with criticism okay
[55:46] every week i'm calling the false
[55:47] preacher false prophet paul's teacher
[55:49] i'm like you don't know nothing about
[55:50] the message i shouldn't say that i
[55:51] shouldn't say that
[55:52] i said you really don't know all you
[55:54] know about the message
[55:56] you think you know things but you don't
[55:57] know things
[55:59] and i say god forgive me for that
[56:02] and then when i present the quotes and
[56:03] scriptures they got nothing
[56:06] there's no report
[56:08] but see we may be criticized
[56:11] but we know where we stand amen
[56:15] church when the winds blow and the winds
[56:17] when the storms come your house won't
[56:19] fall because you're built on the rock of
[56:21] god's word amen
[56:24] that's how i know god's for me like
[56:26] psalmist says when my enemies come
[56:28] against me they do not prevail against
[56:30] me i prevail over them
[56:33] hallelujah
[56:35] i'm the one giving the word we're the
[56:37] ones speaking the word speaking the
[56:38] words we're speaking the word so we'll
[56:40] overcome we're bible believers we
[56:42] believe in jesus christ and god backs it
[56:44] up amen amen
[56:46] hallelujah
[56:48] i know god backs up other groups as well
[56:50] of course i believe that
[56:53] i listen to all
[56:55] five services of these uh preachers that
[56:57] call themselves the greatest this past
[56:59] weekend because this week my wife had me
[57:00] weed out in the garden
[57:03] it was pretty hot out there
[57:05] i was waiting at least for five or six
[57:07] hours
[57:08] so i got to put my earbuds in
[57:13] listen the first sermon
[57:15] this is the second sermon and again they
[57:17] call themselves
[57:18] one of them called one of one of the
[57:20] other one one of the greatest preachers
[57:21] of all time
[57:24] i mean you got enoch in there
[57:27] you got john the baptist in there
[57:29] yeah
[57:30] brother branham
[57:32] jeremiah
[57:34] any some of these men were mart
[57:36] paul
[57:38] john
[57:41] and this guy i know this guy's life he's
[57:43] lived as a pastor since he was
[57:45] 15 he's had thousands i mean unlimited
[57:48] money for all these years
[57:50] living a life of luxury
[57:52] can fly around the world any time he
[57:54] wants
[57:56] is that really the greatest life
[57:59] but after listening to them they never
[58:00] mentioned one thing about fasting
[58:02] helping the poor out of i've listened
[58:03] like six hours of preaching
[58:06] some of it was good it was there's my 30
[58:08] minutes okay
[58:10] give me 15 minutes
[58:13] you see i listen to what they say but i
[58:15] also listen to what they don't say
[58:18] because remember what is true what is
[58:21] true anointing in the holy spirit
[58:22] humility
[58:24] serving others the greatest among you is
[58:25] not the one who gets served it's those
[58:28] who do serve right yes
[58:30] so see i'm listening i'll be there say
[58:32] but i just believe a complex has
[58:33] happened
[58:35] it's a different complex than what we
[58:36] normally see because it's a complex of
[58:38] self-confidence
[58:41] so for example brahms complex was
[58:43] criticizing the people that didn't
[58:44] receive his message well now they're not
[58:46] really criticizing anybody they're just
[58:47] lifting each other up
[58:49] and bro and say just you know
[58:51] the preacher that called the other one
[58:53] the greatest of all time the other one
[58:54] or one of the greatest of all time got
[58:55] up and said you're just a politician and
[58:57] the people laughed
[59:00] so even the preacher knew it was a far
[59:02] and above about beyond what he should
[59:04] have said
[59:05] he called him a politician
[59:08] what does the politician what does a
[59:09] politician do they make promises they
[59:11] make flattering words
[59:13] to try to convince you to like them
[59:17] right a lot of politicians they just
[59:18] make promises they don't keep them yeah
[59:21] remember joe biden said he's going to
[59:22] cure cancer where's that at
[59:26] nobody holds him
[59:27] accountable for that
[59:29] right
[59:30] they just make promises they can't keep
[59:33] so see now they can be saved but i
[59:35] believe something has really happened
[59:36] here with pride
[59:39] and remember broadband says if you have
[59:41] the holy spirit on you you're humble
[59:44] so see it's just really it's really like
[59:46] one of those anointed ones of the end
[59:48] times things they can have the anointing
[59:50] still for miracles but then they still
[59:51] got this complex of pride on them
[59:54] i still believe they're safe and i
[59:55] believe some of them are filled with
[59:56] holy ghosts
[59:57] now let's get back to this our spirit is
[59:59] clean
[1:00:00] is that how you feel when you come to
[1:00:01] church
[1:00:03] it is fresh it is real it is sober and
[1:00:06] serious but nonetheless full of the joy
[1:00:08] of the lord
[1:00:09] the christian ought to be just exuberant
[1:00:11] and full of his pleasure in the lord as
[1:00:14] the world when it savors and delights in
[1:00:15] its pleasures
[1:00:17] both christians and the world are human
[1:00:19] both have emotions the difference is the
[1:00:21] christians hearts and emotions are
[1:00:23] purely on the lord of glory and his love
[1:00:26] while the world satisfies the flesh
[1:00:29] that's right
[1:00:33] so see church to get in the spirit we
[1:00:35] have to seek god
[1:00:36] right through bible study prayer
[1:00:40] remember daniel fasted for 21 days and
[1:00:42] he finally got the answer to daniel 17
[1:00:44] weeks that was not
[1:00:45] that was a time of consecration
[1:00:48] he had to seek the lord to understand
[1:00:50] the scripture
[1:00:51] john on the isle of patmos he had to be
[1:00:53] banned out there all by himself no home
[1:00:55] church out there
[1:00:57] there was only broods of dens of literal
[1:00:59] vipers and snakes
[1:01:01] he didn't have a home church out there
[1:01:03] but that's when god revealed the book of
[1:01:05] revelation to him
[1:01:07] remember jeremiah
[1:01:08] they're going to go back but they've got
[1:01:10] to seek god with all that they have
[1:01:13] what would that look like for you well
[1:01:15] you still got to go to work so while
[1:01:16] you're at work you'll be working and
[1:01:18] then in your little breaks you'd pray or
[1:01:20] you listen to a sermon or read your
[1:01:22] bible what would it look like for you to
[1:01:25] see god with all your heart
[1:01:27] what it looks like for me
[1:01:29] every move every waking moment we want
[1:01:31] to be in the word
[1:01:33] in prayer in fellowship yeah we got to
[1:01:35] take care of business but lord
[1:01:37] that's right i'll send a timer lord give
[1:01:38] me 10 minutes i'll email these people
[1:01:40] back and then i'll get back to the word
[1:01:42] i got to limit it
[1:01:44] right because i know my time is most
[1:01:46] valuable nothing's more valuable than
[1:01:47] time so i gotta limit this get this
[1:01:49] business done and then get right back to
[1:01:51] seeking god
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:54] so church we gotta build up our faith
[1:01:56] the bible says
[1:01:58] beloved build up yourselves on your most
[1:02:00] holy faith praying in the holy ghost
[1:02:02] when was the last time you had a real
[1:02:03] good prayer meeting to build up your
[1:02:05] faith brother jess i'm struggling i'm
[1:02:08] struggling with this or that yes so am i
[1:02:09] sometimes so what do we need a prayer
[1:02:11] meeting to build up our faith
[1:02:14] and the most powerful one jesus says is
[1:02:16] praying in your closet
[1:02:18] because he says if you do that i'll
[1:02:19] reward you openly
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:23] and then i love this keep yourselves in
[1:02:25] the love of god
[1:02:28] jerry amen
[1:02:30] keep yourself in charge keep hoping in
[1:02:32] god keep believing god amen
[1:02:35] looking for what the mercy of our lord
[1:02:37] jesus christ
[1:02:38] unto eternal life and if some have
[1:02:40] compassion
[1:02:42] making a difference
[1:02:43] and others say with fear pulling them
[1:02:45] out of the fire
[1:02:46] hating even the garments spotted by the
[1:02:48] flesh
[1:02:52] hallelujah
[1:02:55] now church let's remember how good god
[1:02:56] is remember the parable the talent
[1:02:58] god said so this is the parable of the
[1:03:00] 11th hour worker sorry he says is it not
[1:03:02] lawful for me to do what i will with my
[1:03:06] own is thine i to evil because i'm good
[1:03:10] so god's going to have some people work
[1:03:11] 12 hours and other people one hour and
[1:03:13] they all get the same reward yeah isn't
[1:03:16] god good either way yeah
[1:03:18] i worked a 12-hour day i got paid this
[1:03:21] much money i worked in one hour a day i
[1:03:22] got the same amount of money
[1:03:24] oh we'd all like to be the one-hour
[1:03:26] worker
[1:03:28] not all that suffering now that heat of
[1:03:29] the day
[1:03:30] but that's what god says
[1:03:32] aren't i aren't i good
[1:03:34] didn't i keep my promise
[1:03:36] doesn't god keep his promise to you
[1:03:38] church amen hallelujah god keeps his
[1:03:41] promise but he's got a different plan
[1:03:42] for every life
[1:03:44] a different will a different testimony
[1:03:46] but rather than a different ring to
[1:03:48] every life
[1:03:52] in whom also we obtain an inheritance
[1:03:54] being predestinated according to the
[1:03:55] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:03:58] after the council of his own will
[1:04:00] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:04:02] glory who first trusted in christ
[1:04:05] get your bibles here uh children it's
[1:04:07] going to be like a
[1:04:08] order trophy

[1:06:41] saying the same god is always working
[1:06:43] out

[1:06:53] god's got a place for good doctors
[1:06:55] brother amen absolutely
[1:07:00] god's got a will
[1:07:02] god has a purpose remember jail time was
[1:07:04] important for paul not just to write the
[1:07:06] bible so that everybody in jail in
[1:07:08] philippians 1 knew that paul was a
[1:07:10] christian amen
[1:07:12] and that strengthened some creatures it
[1:07:14] made them firing more excited to preach
[1:07:16] them god's word our prophets in prison
[1:07:18] but he's keeping the word of god others
[1:07:20] ones it discouraged
[1:07:23] so those are the ones that had to grow
[1:07:24] in their faith they were they were
[1:07:25] immature christians
[1:07:28] but the mature ones glory
[1:07:31] he's standing he hasn't he hasn't
[1:07:32] recanted amen
[1:07:34] i don't know he's keeping the faith
[1:07:36] hallelujah
[1:07:37] he's earnestly contending for the faith
[1:07:39] that was delivered to him
[1:07:45] i hope jose likes these ones
[1:07:47] church if
[1:07:49] if you want to know god's will you've
[1:07:51] got to set sign or time apart to know
[1:07:53] god's will
[1:07:55] and i thought of just while driving to
[1:07:57] church i thought of three examples from
[1:07:58] brother branson's ministry first he
[1:07:59] didn't know why he was having visions
[1:08:01] he would tell us pastor can you imagine
[1:08:04] combating if you were having miracles
[1:08:06] and you came to me and said what do you
[1:08:07] think and i said it's the devil
[1:08:09] that's a brother random experience yeah
[1:08:11] roy davis told him these visions and
[1:08:12] miracles that's the devil
[1:08:14] because they've never seen him before
[1:08:16] so brother branham went to seek the lord
[1:08:18] in the cave and the angel visited him
[1:08:20] yeah
[1:08:21] he actually told his wife before he went
[1:08:23] he said honey i may not come back i'm
[1:08:25] going to wait there i'll die yes unless
[1:08:27] god comes and answers my prayer now
[1:08:29] that's sincere right there yeah
[1:08:30] so see how god has to bring us to
[1:08:32] desperation sometimes
[1:08:34] now i'm going to finish the quote
[1:08:36] brother i told the angel i've been told
[1:08:38] that those visions was wrong
[1:08:41] and he the angel lord
[1:08:44] amen the angel
[1:08:46] the angel referred me to
[1:08:48] what
[1:08:49] scripture
[1:08:50] what am i referring to you the scripture
[1:08:53] amen god works everything for your good
[1:08:56] always
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:02] so if you ever need to know god's will
[1:09:03] the angel the angel of the lord angel
[1:09:05] the covenant the holy spirit will direct
[1:09:07] you to the word amen
[1:09:11] angel how do i know these visions are of
[1:09:12] god
[1:09:13] go look at nathanael
[1:09:16] god gave jesus
[1:09:18] a vision about nathaniel i saw you while
[1:09:19] you're under the tree
[1:09:22] oh discernment oh yes
[1:09:24] scriptural yeah yeah my life is
[1:09:26] scriptural it's not the devil it's the
[1:09:29] holy spirit amen amen i don't know
[1:09:32] because i can prove it by the word of
[1:09:33] god
[1:09:35] and the woman at the well
[1:09:38] i don't know
[1:09:40] brother says the angels are always
[1:09:41] scriptural
[1:09:43] they said you still got paul said you
[1:09:44] still got to test them but i have a word
[1:09:45] though yes
[1:09:48] thank god so there's two then he gives
[1:09:50] him a third one where jesus says a
[1:09:52] little while the word will see me no
[1:09:53] more but i'll be with you even in you to
[1:09:55] the end of the world
[1:09:57] in other words people are gonna keep
[1:09:58] having visions until the end of the
[1:10:00] world so it's okay brother man that you
[1:10:03] have visions because it's scriptural and
[1:10:05] they're going to keep happening to the
[1:10:06] end of the world because i'm always with
[1:10:07] you
[1:10:08] amen
[1:10:12] then brother said then i could leave
[1:10:14] there and i could rejoice and he could
[1:10:15] stand against the preachers because he
[1:10:17] had scripture to stand on
[1:10:19] yeah
[1:10:20] what'd it take it took a time to seek
[1:10:22] god
[1:10:23] we had to shut away
[1:10:25] and seek the lord and like i told
[1:10:27] brother mj maybe listen i said you don't
[1:10:29] skip church when you do that you still
[1:10:31] come to church
[1:10:33] because if not you're outside of the
[1:10:34] plan of god you're disobeying the word
[1:10:36] of god
[1:10:38] so you've got to seek god between the
[1:10:39] services
[1:10:41] or before after your
[1:10:42] choice amen but don't don't skip church
[1:10:45] praise god that's when that was going to
[1:10:46] really attack you
[1:10:48] yeah
[1:10:51] now the second one was after mother and
[1:10:53] started preaching
[1:10:55] he went to mishawaka michigan and he saw
[1:10:58] one man speak in tongues the next man
[1:10:59] interpret and they saw a vision this man
[1:11:01] was a good man but this man divorced his
[1:11:04] wife and was living with another one
[1:11:05] yeah
[1:11:06] it was an adulteress yeah
[1:11:08] i thought i was among angels i realized
[1:11:10] there's devils around here right yeah
[1:11:13] so he said i i don't understand this
[1:11:14] i've got to go out he went to the cave
[1:11:16] went to greens mill cave
[1:11:18] praying
[1:11:19] he come out of the cave and his bible
[1:11:21] down and the sunlight was there
[1:11:24] and he said uh
[1:11:26] i just laid the bible down and started
[1:11:28] and the wind blowed over to hebrews
[1:11:30] chapter six don't you love how god uses
[1:11:31] the nature
[1:11:34] hallelujah
[1:11:36] i thought maybe the lord wants me to
[1:11:37] read that
[1:11:39] hallelujah the wind blew me right to
[1:11:41] hebrews chapter six
[1:11:43] oh glory
[1:11:45] he said when i read it oh well praise
[1:11:47] the lord turn around another one i
[1:11:49] thought well i'll just read somewhere
[1:11:50] else laid it down wipe my eyes the wind
[1:11:53] blowed it back to hebrews 6.
[1:11:57] then it happened three or four times
[1:12:00] as many as three anyhow i thought i
[1:12:01] don't see nothing wrong with that what's
[1:12:03] in there
[1:12:06] now you know the story he read it and
[1:12:08] then he saw a vision
[1:12:10] right
[1:12:11] he saw a vision of one man playing
[1:12:13] depending good seeds and then a man in
[1:12:15] black point planting the bad seeds
[1:12:18] in other words he saw a vision of the
[1:12:19] wheat and the tears
[1:12:22] the tares are right amongst the wheat
[1:12:24] but how do we know by their fruits you
[1:12:26] know them amen by their love their joy
[1:12:29] their peace their long suffering by
[1:12:31] their life and what they express in
[1:12:33] their life that's how you know their
[1:12:34] praise god that's how you know you are
[1:12:36] we today praise god when you obey the
[1:12:38] word of god and the love of god and
[1:12:40] humility flows out of your life
[1:12:44] not arrogance not pride
[1:12:46] not selfishness
[1:12:49] with the fruits of the holy spirit
[1:12:54] i must read that the holy spirit
[1:12:56] now for us it might be brother jesse
[1:12:58] keeps preaching on that maybe i need to
[1:12:59] understand that better
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:02] when the guest preachers come in they
[1:13:04] just preach the same thing i must need
[1:13:06] to understand that
[1:13:08] yeah
[1:13:10] the third time was when he preached the
[1:13:11] seals
[1:13:13] he said the land there's my 45 minutes
[1:13:15] okay
[1:13:18] he said the lamb is standing tonight as
[1:13:21] we enter in the sixth chapter he's got
[1:13:22] his book in his hand he's starting to
[1:13:24] reveal it and oh i would have absolutely
[1:13:27] i hope that people are spiritual i would
[1:13:29] have had a horrible mistake on that
[1:13:31] first seal if it hadn't been about 12
[1:13:32] o'clock today when the holy spirit came
[1:13:35] in the room and corrected me on
[1:13:36] something that i was writing down to say
[1:13:39] where did god reveal these things to him
[1:13:41] when he was seeking god all on his own
[1:13:43] when he got in the spirit amen
[1:13:46] when he got in the spirit the spirit
[1:13:48] came down and showed him things that
[1:13:49] were to me praise god
[1:13:52] showed him and answered him all the
[1:13:54] questions in his life didn't have you
[1:13:55] know
[1:13:56] these were major junctions of his
[1:13:58] ministry
[1:14:00] that first one was before he even went
[1:14:02] out on the evangelistic field before the
[1:14:04] first poll
[1:14:07] the second one was a part of the first
[1:14:09] and second poll and now here's the third
[1:14:11] poll the opening of the word amen
[1:14:18] i was taking it from an old context i
[1:14:20] had nothing on it i don't know what the
[1:14:21] second seal is no more than nothing but
[1:14:23] i take out some old texts or context of
[1:14:26] something i wrote on several years ago
[1:14:27] and i wrote it down i gathered this
[1:14:29] context and dr smith many great
[1:14:30] outstanding teachers i gathered all them
[1:14:32] believed that so i wrote it down and i
[1:14:33] was fixing to say well now i'll study
[1:14:35] from that standpoint and there about 12
[1:14:37] o'clock in the day the holy spirit just
[1:14:39] swept right down to the room and the
[1:14:41] whole thing opened up to me and there it
[1:14:43] was oh the first seal being opened
[1:14:46] see it's in this time church when we're
[1:14:48] desperate when we're seeking god when we
[1:14:50] make extra time to seek the face of god
[1:14:53] that's what god will reveal things to us
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:55] we got to get in the spirit
[1:14:57] that's why i told uh oh i can say this
[1:14:59] uh that's why i told virtue you know she
[1:15:01] was coming for the holy ghost so many
[1:15:02] times that's beautiful virtue
[1:15:05] that's why i said go talk to your mom or
[1:15:06] your grandma about receiving the holy
[1:15:08] ghost because i know how i got it
[1:15:11] it took me two or three years
[1:15:13] there was times i had my own prayer
[1:15:14] meetings up in my little
[1:15:16] closet of a college dorm room you know
[1:15:19] it was so tiny it wasn't even like it
[1:15:20] was just like a triangle type of room
[1:15:22] you know triangular pyramid or something
[1:15:24] like that i would just have my own
[1:15:26] prayer meetings and call to god say fill
[1:15:28] me with the holy ghost i'm expecting
[1:15:29] angels i'd wait and see if angels would
[1:15:31] come in the room
[1:15:33] does he virtue you got a hunger thirst
[1:15:34] for righteousness right it's a beautiful
[1:15:36] thing that you're desiring all those
[1:15:37] children who want to be filled with the
[1:15:38] holy ghost that's a beautiful thing
[1:15:42] right but it's in these times of seeking
[1:15:44] god one on one
[1:15:48] seeking god with all your heart soul
[1:15:50] mind and strength it's in those times
[1:15:53] where brotherhood says the real person
[1:15:55] the real character comes out in your
[1:15:56] heart
[1:15:58] that's getting in the spirit
[1:16:00] and then just a few months later that's
[1:16:01] when i got the holy ghost praise god by
[1:16:03] god's grace
[1:16:05] but it was two or three years of
[1:16:06] learning how to understand a christian
[1:16:09] and and do what's right and learn the
[1:16:11] scriptures and then seek god and to seek
[1:16:13] god myself
[1:16:16] see so many people want somebody else to
[1:16:18] give the holy ghost instead to god are
[1:16:20] they trusting the preacher they're
[1:16:21] trusting the mom or their dad or
[1:16:23] something like that only jesus gives
[1:16:25] jesus the one that baptized him with the
[1:16:26] holy ghost amen
[1:16:28] well the same thing only jesus can
[1:16:30] answer the questions of our hearts
[1:16:36] he says i'm just as positive as i'm
[1:16:37] standing right here tonight this is the
[1:16:38] gospel truth i'm going to tell you i
[1:16:40] just know it is because it's a
[1:16:41] revelation because if it's a revelation
[1:16:43] contrary to the word then it isn't
[1:16:45] revelation
[1:16:46] and you know there's some of this stuff
[1:16:48] can look absolutely true and yet it
[1:16:49] isn't see it looks like it is but it
[1:16:51] isn't
[1:16:53] all right let me close with this uh
[1:16:54] let's head to our feet musicians can
[1:16:55] come here
[1:17:01] okay let me just close with this thought
[1:17:02] um
[1:17:04] it's right here
[1:17:08] this is from another server but i just
[1:17:10] want to close with this one
[1:17:19] we're all familiar with this
[1:17:26] but if we want to know the will of god
[1:17:27] for any promise of god we have got to
[1:17:30] seek god
[1:17:32] the bible said acts 17
[1:17:34] the bereans were more noble than those
[1:17:36] in thessalonica
[1:17:38] in that they received the word with all
[1:17:40] readiness of mind
[1:17:42] and searched the scriptures daily
[1:17:44] whether those things were so
[1:17:47] the bible gives them a royalty
[1:17:49] designation
[1:17:51] that's not natural royalty that's
[1:17:53] spiritual role
[1:17:56] in other words people that will be kings
[1:17:58] and queens in heaven nature seek god now
[1:18:01] every day praise god amen
[1:18:04] that's the proof
[1:18:06] that their spiritual royalty because
[1:18:08] they're interested in spiritual things
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:11] thank hallelujah amen
[1:18:13] that's god
[1:18:15] god is calling
[1:18:16] these people spiritual kings because
[1:18:19] they take what paul said they make sure
[1:18:21] well where did paul say that in the
[1:18:23] bible
[1:18:24] okay yes
[1:18:26] they're taking time away from hopefully
[1:18:28] hopefully i'll say like this hopefully
[1:18:29] they're spending that time with their
[1:18:30] families seeking the scriptures
[1:18:33] because we don't want to rob our
[1:18:34] children of their our time together
[1:18:35] right we don't want to rob them anything
[1:18:44] we are clearly given
[1:18:48] the formula for finding any promise of
[1:18:50] god is by seeking god
[1:18:54] searching the scriptures daily
[1:18:56] that's why
[1:18:58] let me
[1:18:59] bring this up i just can't stop here
[1:19:01] just one more help me lord stop
[1:19:04] that's why this is what the message
[1:19:06] people put up
[1:19:07] these are five full people this was
[1:19:09] years ago and as soon as i saw this
[1:19:12] i'm like this is this is clearly wrong
[1:19:16] they said just say amen this is a
[1:19:18] preacher's wife a very famous preacher's
[1:19:19] wife she posted this on facebook and i
[1:19:21] was like what screenshot that's wrong
[1:19:23] i'm going to say that for later
[1:19:25] just say amen to every word of the
[1:19:26] message in other words just say amen to
[1:19:28] everything brother branham said
[1:19:31] don't doubt or question it it's that
[1:19:32] simple i thank god for choosing me to
[1:19:34] see the light of this day now that
[1:19:35] sounds all positive
[1:19:38] but that is actually worship of a man
[1:19:47] then the bible just say who are the
[1:19:50] noble ones the ones that believe
[1:19:52] everything and don't go search it or the
[1:19:54] ones that search it by the bible
[1:19:57] they're both prophets paul and brother
[1:19:58] are both prophets
[1:20:00] which ones are the real believers the
[1:20:03] noble ones are the ones who take every
[1:20:05] day and remember what was preached and
[1:20:07] they go look at it in the bible the next
[1:20:09] day
[1:20:11] i'm not going to ask you to raise your
[1:20:12] hands
[1:20:14] because sometimes i forget what the
[1:20:15] preacher said the next day
[1:20:18] but some of them are like red letter
[1:20:19] days
[1:20:21] like i always remember when simon
[1:20:22] preaches certain things and can't read
[1:20:23] certain things i always remember similar
[1:20:25] services
[1:20:26] brother brian hawkins
[1:20:29] god just it's like god just steps down
[1:20:31] shows us exactly what we need
[1:20:35] you see church you have got to find you
[1:20:36] and i have have to find a way to do this
[1:20:40] we have got to see god every day
[1:20:43] search the scriptures every single day
[1:20:45] for answers to your questions
[1:20:50] that that's what makes you a spiritual
[1:20:52] king
[1:20:53] that's what makes you a spiritual priest
[1:20:55] because you want to see god every single
[1:20:57] day you want to know what god wants from
[1:20:58] my monday what does god want for my
[1:21:00] tuesday
[1:21:03] my wednesday my thursday
[1:21:05] we cannot hear the word and then do
[1:21:08] nothing with it we have to hear the word
[1:21:09] and act upon it
[1:21:15] and then we'll know the will of god
[1:21:17] for every promise of god
[1:21:20] how many want to be noble christians
[1:21:21] praise god
[1:21:22] let's bow our heads
[1:21:24] the secret is
[1:21:25] seeking the face of god having joined
[1:21:28] the midst of trials
[1:21:34] knowing that god allows these things in
[1:21:36] his wisdom to come to pass
[1:21:40] hallelujah
[1:21:43] i think i preached over an hour so
[1:21:47] lord have mercy on me
[1:21:50] i love you church i love
[1:21:52] your love for the lord jesus christ i
[1:21:53] love you with christian brotherly love
[1:21:56] appreciate you listening so intently
[1:22:06] we want to be noble christians
[1:22:08] so we have to do what noble christians
[1:22:09] do they search the scriptures every day
[1:22:13] now for you church it might i know moms
[1:22:14] are busy with kids and grandmas and
[1:22:16] things
[1:22:17] dads have a little bit more free time
[1:22:18] they get to travel and go to work and
[1:22:19] things
[1:22:21] but for you it might just be listening
[1:22:22] to a sermon every day
[1:22:25] and really listening intently if you
[1:22:26] care
[1:22:30] but each of us have to every day seek
[1:22:33] god
[1:22:35] that's what makes us
[1:22:37] noble
[1:22:38] spiritual kings and priests unto god
[1:22:41] that's what makes us
[1:22:42] the royalty of heaven
[1:22:45] we were the beggars now we're royalty
[1:22:46] the song says hallelujah kings and
[1:22:49] priests
