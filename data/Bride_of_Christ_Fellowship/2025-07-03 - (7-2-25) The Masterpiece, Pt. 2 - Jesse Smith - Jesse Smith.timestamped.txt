[0:00] And so I just try to hit the highlights.
[0:01] How many enjoyed that Sunday? Did
[0:02] everybody enjoy that? By God's grace,
[0:03] did that help you? Okay. I just I trust
[0:06] it was, you know, I just try to pray and
[0:07] consecrate and trust that the Lord will
[0:09] speak to everybody. By God's grace, I
[0:11] was surely blessed. Um, but tonight I
[0:13] want to look a little deeper at what he
[0:15] said his masterpiece was. By the way, I
[0:17] went through the masterpiece of
[0:18] Michelangelo with Moses and he went
[0:20] through God's masterpiece, Jesus. And I
[0:22] just briefly touched brother Brandham's
[0:24] masterpiece. So, I want to uh maybe uh
[0:28] spend my time tonight, Lord willing, our
[0:29] time on uh the scriptures, brother Bram
[0:32] used for his masterpiece. And I just
[0:34] imagine, Brother Brand, I'm like
[0:35] chipping away or like like le like
[0:36] Michelangelo, right? I imagine brother
[0:38] Bram chipping away. Uh I didn't add the
[0:41] text yet because I was trying to decide
[0:42] which one. Let's do Malachi 45 and six.
[0:47] So, we'll read that here. By God's
[0:48] grace, very familiar to us. Most of us
[0:50] could probably quote it by heart, which
[0:52] is a wonderful thing. It's the word for
[0:53] our day.
[0:57] I've had numerous people this week say
[0:59] or this last few weeks say, "Oh, Brother
[1:01] Random can't be in Malachi 4 because
[1:03] it's written to the Jews." I said, "You
[1:04] just" I said, "I feel sorry for you. I
[1:06] just don't uh I feel like you just don't
[1:08] read your Bible." If you read the book
[1:10] of Isaiah, it's written to the Jews.
[1:12] Isaiah 25:8 is the rapture for the
[1:14] Gentile church.
[1:17] God can speak through us through any
[1:19] book. Hallelujah. It's called compound
[1:21] prophecy.
[1:23] And I just feel bad these people. It
[1:25] breaks my heart. But you know, all that
[1:27] the father has given me will come to me.
[1:29] Praise God. I'm just glad I can see it.
[1:31] Praise God. Hallelujah. Malachi 4:5 and
[1:33] six. Very familiar. Let's read that on
[1:35] three. One, two, three. Behold, I will
[1:37] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:40] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:43] the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of
[1:45] the fathers to the children and the
[1:48] heart of the children to their fathers,
[1:50] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:53] curse. May God add his blessing to the
[1:54] ring of his word. You can be seated
[1:56] there by God's grace. It's 7 o'clock, so
[1:58] I'll try to preach 40 minutes. We'll see
[2:01] how that goes.
[2:05] Again, this is part two. I do think I'll
[2:06] just review real quick here. U
[2:10] I'll just show those pictures,
[2:11] especially since we got Sandy and Kim
[2:12] here. Uh you know brother Brandham
[2:14] talked about uh are you familiar with
[2:16] the sermon the masterpiece? Okay. Amen.
[2:18] Glory. So brother Brandham talked about
[2:20] this uh sculpture here by Michelangelo.
[2:23] And uh now I could be wrong on this but
[2:26] this is the best I saw. U I mean just
[2:28] look at this amazing craftsmanship. But
[2:30] I if I'm not mistaken that was the the
[2:33] spot where Michelangelo struck it with
[2:35] his uh hammer. And what were the words
[2:38] he said? Why won't you speak? According
[2:41] to this is just one reference the one
[2:42] museum said he said why won't you speak
[2:45] he was so inspired uh by his work it it
[2:49] was the reality of the vision was
[2:52] standing before him and he was so
[2:53] inspired he said speak and then brother
[2:55] Ram used that as a parallel although it
[2:57] was in different order uh brother Ram
[2:59] used that as a parallel of the Lord
[3:02] Jesus Christ and I just like that that's
[3:03] just really humble uh that's really
[3:06] heartfelt how the Lord Jesus suffered
[3:08] for us that's God's masterpiece
[3:10] wasn't somebody handsome or somebody
[3:12] special or something. It was he had no
[3:14] beauty that we would desire him, but he
[3:16] gave his life for us. Praise God. And
[3:18] within each stripe, with each stripe, it
[3:21] purchased our healing and our
[3:22] forgiveness. How many love Jesus
[3:24] tonight? Hallelujah.
[3:26] And so the order was a little off. You
[3:29] know, with Michelangelo, he finished it
[3:31] and then he smoteed it and then said
[3:33] speak. But with Jesus, uh, it was
[3:36] different, right? Jesus spoke first
[3:38] because on mount transfiguration
[3:40] uh God said hear ye him right and then
[3:43] Jesus spoke the doctrine right brother
[3:44] said that was his second part of his
[3:46] ministry was the doctrine first was
[3:47] healing doctrine then the third pole uh
[3:50] prophet I'm sorry third pole preaching
[3:51] eternal loss and his resurrection
[3:53] ministry u so Jesus was a little
[3:55] different first uh he smote him I'm
[3:58] sorry first he said speak then god
[4:00] smoteed him okay hallelujah so we just
[4:03] looked at that now I think that's just a
[4:04] quick review and now uh let's go back to
[4:07] uh tonight's message here by God's
[4:09] grace. Feeling good, Malachi. All right.
[4:11] Good. Amen. Hallelujah. He works 12 to
[4:14] 13 hours a day, too. He gets up at 3:50
[4:16] a.m. I don't know how he does it, but I
[4:18] guess when you're 18, you know, you can
[4:19] do stuff like that. So, uh the word
[4:21] masterpiece means a work done with
[4:23] extraordinary skill. So, let's think
[4:25] about that as we look at Brother
[4:26] Random's quotes. Brother Random is going
[4:28] to give us his teaching and notice it
[4:31] must be done with extraordinary skill.
[4:34] Now we know no man has any skill, right?
[4:37] So it's the Holy Spirit that pointed out
[4:39] certain scriptures to brother Brandham
[4:42] and it was such skill. It's called
[4:44] rightly dividing the word of truth.
[4:46] Hallelujah. Because anybody can pick up
[4:48] the Bible, right? Brother Brham said
[4:49] anybody can read the Bible, but it takes
[4:51] the Holy Spirit to break the bread to
[4:52] us, right? To give us the understanding.
[4:54] What does that verse mean? And and how
[4:56] does this fit with the rest of prophecy
[4:58] of scripture? So that's the skill. The
[5:01] skill is brother Random said uh brother
[5:03] Ram said my gift is getting out of the
[5:04] way so God can speak through me. Amen.
[5:07] Okay. So that's when brother Ram
[5:08] experienced skill. That's when all of us
[5:10] will experience any skill in our lives.
[5:12] Any good that comes out of our life is
[5:14] us dying out to ourselves yielding to
[5:16] the Holy Spirit. Then God can use us.
[5:19] And just think be thinking about that. I
[5:21] want to preach probably one or two more
[5:22] sermons on this and then I'll move back
[5:24] maybe to the Corinthians series. But be
[5:26] thinking in the next few services. What
[5:28] masterpiece have you worked on your
[5:29] whole life?
[5:31] Michelangelo worked on this masterpiece
[5:32] for decades. Brother Brandham said,
[5:35] "What masterpiece have you worked on for
[5:37] your whole life?" Now, like I said, with
[5:39] some of us, like maybe adults or
[5:41] grandparents, you've worked on your
[5:42] children or your grandchildren. I put 18
[5:46] years of work in this guy right here. I
[5:48] got almost 16 in my daughter back there.
[5:52] Where's Lydia? I got 20 years in her,
[5:53] you know, just chipping away every day,
[5:55] right?
[5:57] And when you have children, you'll know
[5:58] what it's like.
[6:00] But you know, uh, everybody has a
[6:03] different ministry. You know, if you
[6:04] don't have kids or don't not married or
[6:06] something like that, you'll have a
[6:06] different work that God's called you to
[6:08] do. Maybe it's witnessing. Maybe it's
[6:10] just working and praying for one or two
[6:12] souls for years and years and decades.
[6:15] And then finally, the person gets saved.
[6:17] Hallelujah. I had a brother from
[6:20] Tennessee
[6:22] uh call me last weekend while I was here
[6:23] at the church, you know, on Saturday,
[6:26] and he told me this beautiful story. He
[6:27] worked with a Catholic man for over 20
[6:30] years. And he's just like, "Lord, give
[6:31] me the words. Give me the words." He's a
[6:33] Catholic man. He's a Catholic man. He
[6:35] worships Mary, you know, because of
[6:36] course they do. And he said one day he
[6:39] just uh he said uh he asked him, "What
[6:42] about Adam and Eve?" The Catholic man
[6:44] asked the message preacher or message
[6:46] minister, and now he's not a minister,
[6:47] he's a piano player. And he's like,
[6:49] "Lord, do you want me to say it?" And he
[6:50] felt the uncction. Say it. So he spilled
[6:52] out everything with serpent seed.
[6:55] And ever since that moment, that man
[6:58] came into the message church, got
[6:59] baptized, and has been there ever since.
[7:03] That's what I call a masterpiece.
[7:06] You're you're pay he said I had to be
[7:08] patient with him. He had a dirty mouth
[7:09] and he was a Catholic man. Of course, we
[7:12] would expect that because they don't
[7:12] have the word of God. But I thought, my
[7:15] that's a great example of just working
[7:16] on somebody. How many can have the
[7:18] longsuffering of the Lord? Amen. And let
[7:21] the Lord use you to just work on people.
[7:24] Brother Ram said, ' I'd rather have you
[7:25] live me a sermon than preach me one.
[7:28] Hallelujah. So, let's keep that in mind.
[7:30] You are working on some masterpiece in
[7:33] your life. Hallelujah. I got nine of
[7:34] them because I got nine children. So,
[7:36] those are my m masterpieces I'm trying
[7:39] to work on by God's grace if the Lord
[7:41] would let me. But as I was I think I was
[7:43] mowing or I was listening to brother
[7:45] Brand while I was driving and I heard
[7:47] brother say these words, "This is my
[7:49] masterpiece." And I thought, "What?" I I
[7:51] listened to this before, but I never
[7:53] listened to it. And the Holy Spirit just
[7:55] spoke that to me like, "Wow, Brother
[7:57] Ram's going to tell me his masterpiece."
[8:00] I preached Brother Random for uh 21
[8:03] years. I preached his message. Well, not
[8:06] too preached in 2004. Okay. Yeah. 21
[8:09] years. I've been preaching the message
[8:11] for 21 years. And I'm like, I I thought
[8:13] I knew Brother Ram's masterpiece, but
[8:15] this was fresh to me. He's talking about
[8:18] the wheat plant and he's talking about
[8:19] Pentecostal brethren.
[8:22] He says, 'I want you to listen, my
[8:23] brother. If this is my last message I'll
[8:25] ever preach, thank God it wasn't. He
[8:27] still got to preach to us uh questions
[8:29] and answers and feast of the trumpets
[8:31] and all these uh the marriage and
[8:32] divorce and uh a spiritual food in due
[8:35] season, all these awesome messages,
[8:37] visible union, the bride, you know, what
[8:39] house will you build me? All these
[8:40] beautiful messages from 64 and 65. He
[8:44] said, "This is my masterpiece." So, he's
[8:47] going to preach about the wheat plant.
[8:49] And the wheat plant is brother's
[8:51] foundation for his masterpiece.
[8:55] Did you notice when the corn of wheat
[8:57] falls into the ground again, then it
[8:59] begins to form back to its grain again.
[9:02] So, picture a a wheat seed, right? A
[9:05] grain of wheat, the grain, the corn of
[9:08] it. Start with that, plant it, grows up,
[9:11] and then when it's all mature, you pull
[9:13] off another grain. That was brother
[9:15] Ram's masterpiece.
[9:17] Sounds pretty simple, doesn't it? But
[9:20] yet, it was his masterpiece. So, it must
[9:23] be very special. Must be very skilled,
[9:24] right? Like these people, uh, wheat
[9:27] plant is very skilled. Like I saw that
[9:30] Ray Comfort, he talked to these
[9:31] atheists. He said, "Do you believe in uh
[9:33] creation is intelligent?" They're like,
[9:35] "No." He's like, "Okay, make me a rose.
[9:38] It's not intelligent. It wasn't
[9:40] designed. So, what they said, I don't
[9:42] have any supernatural powers. That
[9:43] proves there's a God
[9:45] since you can't do it. And and he said,
[9:47] "Well, you told me you're intelligent
[9:48] and you can't create something that's
[9:49] not intelligent."
[9:52] I love how the foolishness of God makes
[9:55] these fools look even more foolish.
[9:57] Hallelujah. The foolishness of God saves
[9:59] them that would believe. Hallelujah. My
[10:04] now brother Random only preaches 30
[10:07] minutes on this topic of his
[10:09] masterpiece. The first hour and so forth
[10:12] is about, you know, Jesus as the
[10:14] masterpiece. Uh it's about uh
[10:16] Michelangelo's masterpiece. And then the
[10:18] last 30 minutes are about his vision of
[10:20] the preview of the bride. That's what
[10:22] we're going to get to hopefully Sunday.
[10:24] And then he prays of course at the end
[10:26] and has a time of singing saying a
[10:28] couple songs. But within this 30 minute,
[10:30] I'm about halfway through. I'm going
[10:31] real slow trying to catch all the verses
[10:34] here. So, here's the Bible principles
[10:36] included in his masterpiece. And we're
[10:38] going to go through these tonight. So,
[10:39] if you got your Bibles, have your Bibles
[10:40] handy. I might start at the front and
[10:42] maybe go back and if you want to read a
[10:43] verse, you could read some of these here
[10:45] as we go by God's grace.
[10:48] So, Brother's masterpiece is the wheat
[10:51] plant and it includes all of these
[10:53] topics. Right now, we got one, two,
[10:55] three, four, five. And I'm not even
[10:56] halfway through. Well, I'm about halfway
[10:58] through through this 30 minute sermon or
[11:00] section of his sermon on my masterpiece.
[11:03] He tells the people, "This is my
[11:05] masterpiece. God let me work on." I can
[11:08] just picture Brother chipping away, just
[11:10] hammering away, making this beautiful
[11:12] masterpiece of a wheat plant. His entire
[11:15] life, this is his life's work, his
[11:17] masterpiece.
[11:18] Hallelujah.
[11:20] Amen.
[11:22] So the first verse he uses, the first
[11:24] topic he gets into is the anointed ones,
[11:26] the end times. So Malachi, do you want
[11:28] to read that? Malachi, I'm sorry,
[11:29] Matthew 24:4. Very familiar to us. There
[11:32] shall
[11:34] prophets.
[11:41] Thank you. So right after saying my
[11:43] masterpiece, he says, "Watch nature."
[11:45] Exactly. Nature is God. In other words,
[11:47] God created nature. So God's in nature,
[11:49] right? The mind of God is in nature. God
[11:52] working in nature, it's all he can. But
[11:54] from the Pentecostal revival, as they
[11:56] think was the seed, it wasn't. And
[11:59] that's true. Remember I preached on
[12:00] Isuza Street last year or two years ago.
[12:02] Remember, they thought the rapture was
[12:04] so close. They said, "Don't get married.
[12:06] Don't have children."
[12:08] Now, no doubt, no doubt they influenced
[12:10] a lot of people because God was doing so
[12:12] many miracles. Brother Bam said it was
[12:13] the greatest revival since Pentecost.
[12:16] So it was amazing with miracles,
[12:18] healing, supernatural
[12:21] uh the the pillar of fire was seen
[12:22] there. I mean it was amazing uh revival
[12:26] but then what that what happened they
[12:27] eventually denominated around tongues.
[12:30] Now Seymour corrected at the end of his
[12:31] life but once it spread out of there a
[12:34] lot of people never corrected it but
[12:36] Seymour corrected it in his short
[12:39] ministry. He didn't live very long
[12:40] because he poured himself into the
[12:41] revival so much just like brother
[12:42] Brandon. brother poured himself into it,
[12:45] died early at 56. He said, "But the
[12:47] Pentecostal Zusa Street wasn't the
[12:49] revival. It wasn't the seed, but
[12:51] something come forth just like the
[12:53] seed." Now, watch what Jesus said in
[12:55] Matthew 24. The two spirits at the last
[12:57] days would be so close together, it
[12:58] would deceive the elected if it were
[13:00] possible.
[13:02] Okay? So now, Brother Ram's getting to
[13:03] his day. The Pentecostal church was the
[13:06] closest thing to Brother Brham's
[13:08] ministry in those days. Okay? Like if
[13:12] you listen to questions answer 64.
[13:15] Brother Ram said I've sent over a
[13:16] million of my children to the Assemblies
[13:18] of God church. How many know what I'm
[13:20] talking about? He says, ' Do you think
[13:21] I'd send them to a death trap? No. He
[13:24] said, because that's the best church we
[13:25] got in ' 64. But now we're past 64.
[13:29] We're 61 years past 64. Now we got some
[13:31] good message churches. Hallelujah.
[13:33] You're in one. Hallelujah. We got more
[13:36] truth than the Pentecostals. I was
[13:38] raised in the Assembly of God. I know
[13:40] what I'm talking about. I was raised
[13:42] Pentecostal before I received the
[13:43] message. I know what they believe. I was
[13:45] in the classes to go through a class.
[13:47] But then when they talked about the
[13:48] tongues, I didn't go in because I didn't
[13:49] know the message. But I knew tongues
[13:51] weren't the evidence. Even as a even as
[13:53] a a a 20-year-old young man, not even
[13:56] know the message, I knew tongues wasn't
[13:57] the evidence. Must have been the
[13:59] election inside of me. Praise God.
[14:02] All right. So, here's what brother Bam
[14:03] is saying. The Pentecostals were like
[14:06] the chaff. They were so close to the
[14:08] truth, right? They look just like it.
[14:11] But then what did they do? They pulled
[14:13] away from Brother Ram's preaching,
[14:14] especially that serpent seed. Brother
[14:16] Ram said, "That's the killer." He said,
[14:18] "You want to break fellowships?" He
[14:20] said, "If somebody wants to break
[14:21] fellowship, they're going to break
[14:22] fellowship on the serpent seed."
[14:24] How many times have we seen it?
[14:27] So that's what brother Ram is saying.
[14:29] Brother Ram said it'll be so close it
[14:31] would deceive the very elected if it
[14:32] were possible. See the chaff, the chaff
[14:34] is so close to the seed. It looks like,
[14:37] look, look at the shape. It's almost the
[14:38] same shape, right?
[14:42] But that's deceptive because it doesn't
[14:44] have the life. And the church said, see,
[14:47] they make the tongues. Tongues are life.
[14:48] Tongues are life. No, no. The Holy Ghost
[14:50] is life. Hallelujah. That's the life.
[14:54] And so, most of those people don't get
[14:55] the real Holy Ghost in their soul. their
[14:57] human spirits might get anointed
[15:00] and they might have wonderful
[15:02] experiences, but if it doesn't get down
[15:03] into the soul, they're going to trip up
[15:05] on the things of this world and not be
[15:07] able to live the life of Jesus Christ.
[15:10] Because we all have mountain tops, but
[15:12] wait, wait till you get down the valley.
[15:14] You're going to see what you're made of.
[15:15] Right? Malachi's learning right now.
[15:17] He's working out there 50 hours a week.
[15:19] He's going to find out what he's made
[15:20] out of, right? Working around sinners.
[15:23] That's what I found out soon as I got
[15:24] saved. As soon as I heard the message, I
[15:26] was in college football. And guess what?
[15:27] I found out right away what I was made
[15:28] of, right? All these other guys, they
[15:31] take off their shirts. I'm in the
[15:32] message. I'm like, "Oh, I'm can't take
[15:33] off my shirt." I found out I had the I
[15:36] had found out I had the real thing. They
[15:38] they all they all wear shorts. I kept my
[15:40] pants on. 99 degrees. I still got
[15:44] sweatpants and t-shirt on. I'm like, I
[15:47] can do all things through Christ who
[15:48] strengthens me. I found out, church,
[15:51] what I was made of. I wasn't a
[15:53] compromiser. I believe the message
[15:55] because modesty is in the message. 1
[15:58] Timothy 2:9. I wrote a book on it. I
[16:01] ought to know about it by God's grace.
[16:04] But see, they're missing the life. Oh
[16:06] yeah. Then I saw a Pentecostal guy. He
[16:07] threw off his shirt and took off his
[16:08] sweatpants. He's like, I just can't
[16:10] handle Jesse. Forgive me. I'm like, I
[16:11] forgive you.
[16:13] But I know what you're made out of. You
[16:16] don't You have experience. You have
[16:17] tongues, but you don't have the life of
[16:19] Christ. Because the life of Christ
[16:21] doesn't compromise. Hallelujah.
[16:24] That's what brother said. The chaff is
[16:26] so close. It's so similar. It might
[16:28] deceive the very elect if it were
[16:29] possible, but it's not possible to
[16:31] deceive the elect.
[16:34] That that that might deceive a child, a
[16:36] child might grab for that and they go, I
[16:38] could eat that or plant that. But no,
[16:40] anyone who's mature, any anyone that's
[16:42] really grown up in the Lord, they know
[16:43] the real thing when they see it. That's
[16:46] the point brother is making. This is my
[16:48] masterpiece. He says, hallelujah. Now, I
[16:51] had two mistakes. And did anybody catch
[16:53] my mistakes on Sunday? Anybody catch it?
[16:55] I made this uh image. It said chaff
[16:58] here. Uh and it said something else
[17:01] wrong.
[17:03] Yeah, some it had something. Yeah, the
[17:04] arrow was pointing there. I'm like,
[17:05] what? How did I miss that on Sunday? I
[17:07] must have been so excited I missed it.
[17:08] So, forgive me. But see, your pastor
[17:10] makes mistakes sometimes, but thank God
[17:12] I can correct them. Hallelujah.
[17:15] Uh love is corrective, brother says. So
[17:17] here's what and now brother didn't use
[17:19] this verse but this is the verse about a
[17:22] wheat plant that has three stages. Okay
[17:25] I found this uh in Mark 4
[17:29] the two previous parts die. So there's
[17:31] three parts brother emphasizes the stalk
[17:34] what Jesus calls the blade. See the
[17:35] blade of leaves blade the blade of
[17:37] leaves and then the ear which we call it
[17:40] the head. Farmers call it the head. That
[17:41] was the Methodist. So the stalk is
[17:43] Lutheran Methodist. And then the full
[17:45] corn, brother Rams calls it the bride.
[17:47] Calls it the bride. It's the restored
[17:48] bride. And it just so happens we're
[17:50] called bride of Christ Fellowship. So
[17:52] that's that's why we named a bride. We
[17:54] want to be the bride. We don't want to
[17:56] be the chaff. We don't want to be the
[17:57] head. We don't want to be the stalk. We
[17:58] want to be the word. We want to be the
[18:00] seed.
[18:02] Now, there's three stages, but brother
[18:04] noticed this one. He said, "This is so
[18:06] close. The chaff was the Pentecostals."
[18:09] Okay? So there's only three stages, but
[18:12] he just notices there's it's like
[18:13] there's a fourth, but it's really not.
[18:14] But there's only three. There's only
[18:16] seven church ages, right? There's not
[18:17] eight church ages, but he just notices
[18:19] there's something very close. It might
[18:21] deceive the very elect if it were
[18:23] possible. And as you'll see, brother Ram
[18:25] said, "This chaff is a pulling away."
[18:28] And then he even gives us a scripture. I
[18:29] mentioned on Sunday, if you remember,
[18:31] there's a scripture for this pulling
[18:33] away from the seed. Okay? Now, notice
[18:36] the two previous parts die. So the stalk
[18:39] dies, the head dies, and we know the
[18:41] third too, but the chaff dies. And this
[18:44] shows the life of the Holy Ghost passing
[18:46] through the church ages. And this is
[18:48] brother Brandham's masterpiece.
[18:51] Is it simple enough for you, church?
[18:54] Notice that he now, as as much as I
[18:56] believe these, did he call the seven
[18:58] thunders the masterpiece? No, he didn't.
[19:01] Now, do I believe in the seven thunders?
[19:03] Yes, they've already uttered. Brother
[19:04] said it's the revelation contains in the
[19:06] seals, right? But notice, and this is
[19:09] after he preached uh on the seven
[19:11] thunders, right? Because he he said
[19:13] right afterwards, he said the seven
[19:14] thunders were preached the other day at
[19:15] the tabernacle in ' 63. So he knew he'd
[19:18] already preached the seven thunders. Is
[19:20] is this the end time? Uh December 1962.
[19:23] God bless you, brother Austin. Good to
[19:24] see you, brother.
[19:26] So he had already preached the
[19:28] revelation of the seven thunders, but he
[19:29] calls this his masterpiece, his skilled
[19:33] work.
[19:35] Hallelujah. I'm glad I could understand
[19:37] it by God's grace. Hallelujah. I'm glad.
[19:40] Now, here, Brother Chris, I did this for
[19:41] you, brother, because brother Chris, you
[19:43] asked about this. Great question,
[19:44] brother. I love the questions. Excellent
[19:46] questions. Here's what it means,
[19:48] brother. It means the wheat plant is
[19:50] like a timeline.
[19:52] So, Luther nailed the 95 thesis in 1517.
[19:55] So, that was the life, right? That was
[19:57] the life coming out of the ground. That
[19:59] was the life coming out of the Catholic
[20:00] Church, right? Uh Wesley said he really
[20:04] got the Holy Ghost in 1738. He thought
[20:06] he had it, but then he met met some uh
[20:09] Morivians. I forgot how to say that.
[20:11] Morivans. I can't never say that. These
[20:13] really godly people. And then he really
[20:15] got on fire for the Lord. Okay. Of
[20:17] course, the the Holy Ghost fell in 1906
[20:20] Street. Now, I put 1960 up there. Uh it
[20:23] could have been any it could have been
[20:24] uh 30 1933 at the at the Ohio River, you
[20:26] know. But I just thought he really did
[20:29] something there with the the church ages
[20:31] because he said they were thus sayith
[20:32] the Lord. And that really started
[20:34] separating uh the wise virgin from the
[20:37] foolish virgin. Okay, so I just put that
[20:39] in there. It could be any date. You
[20:41] could put whatever date you want in
[20:42] there. I just threw it in there because
[20:43] this he said the church ages were thus
[20:45] sayith the Lord. Okay, and they were
[20:47] such an important part. They even said
[20:48] they're part of his masterpiece. Okay.
[20:50] So, Brother Chris, does that help by
[20:51] God's grace? Okay. So, this this this
[20:54] plant represents a time period from the
[20:57] 1500s to our day. All right.
[21:01] So, I like technology. I'm a school
[21:03] teacher, so I I like doing technology.
[21:05] So, I mean, that's not very good, but
[21:07] that's the best I could do. Now, now
[21:09] look what brother Ham says. Notice here
[21:10] that life was in the stalk, the tassel,
[21:12] and now it ends up in the seed. How many
[21:14] parts? Three. The life that come out of
[21:17] the original seed come up through
[21:19] different processes. three different
[21:21] processes and then turned back to its
[21:23] original condition. Hallelujah. Oh my.
[21:25] What does brother have to say? What did
[21:27] his masterpiece masterpiece make him
[21:29] feel? It made him feel happy
[21:32] and the joy of the Lord is your right.
[21:35] So see this made him happy. Gave him
[21:37] strength to preach. I'm the happiest
[21:39] person in the world that God has let me
[21:41] see this the three stages of the wheat
[21:44] plant.
[21:46] Watch how perfect the word and these
[21:48] nature works together.
[21:52] So church, you should feel happy when
[21:53] you listen to the masterpiece. Praise
[21:54] God. Okay. So the next the next
[21:57] principle he gets into after the
[21:58] anointed ones of the end time, right?
[22:01] Because there's going to be a lot of
[22:02] Pentecostals. My they're so close in
[22:03] some ways, you know, they believe in the
[22:05] supernatural. They pray for divine
[22:06] healing. They they some of them dress
[22:08] modestly, but each each decade they get
[22:10] a little more worldly. Most of them wear
[22:12] high heels now. Shame. So, a lot of them
[22:15] are starting to cut their hair and wear
[22:16] a little bit of makeup here, a little
[22:18] bit. Shame on them. But they can't help
[22:20] it. The life has left. Hallelujah. The
[22:23] full life has left. Can people be saved
[22:27] in there? Sure, brother. They can be
[22:28] saved in there as long as they're
[22:29] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[22:31] But if they reject part of the word,
[22:32] they can't be born again of the word.
[22:34] Hallelujah. They can have a portion of
[22:37] it, but they can't have the fullness of
[22:38] it if they uh turn down the fullness of
[22:41] the revelation.
[22:42] Hallelujah. That's right. Amen.
[22:45] So now brother gets into the this this
[22:48] wheat plant represents the church ages
[22:51] and the three works of grace.
[22:54] He said all nature everything works with
[22:56] the word of God. Here it is exactly
[22:59] perfectly in these church ages. His
[23:01] masterpiece was in the church ages too.
[23:04] That's the reason the Holy Ghost came
[23:06] down and draw those things and made them
[23:08] out for us the way he has. I don't know
[23:10] if you saw it last month, I put out a
[23:12] video on my YouTube channel of the audio
[23:14] when the Holy Ghost fell in 1961 in the
[23:17] Brandham Tabernacle. Everybody screaming
[23:19] and shouting and brother Ram said,
[23:20] "You're only seeing one." He said, "I'm
[23:22] seeing two."
[23:24] They saw the light on the back wall
[23:26] making the shadows of the seven church
[23:27] ages. Brother Ram saw that light, but
[23:29] brother Ram saw this the spirit of God,
[23:31] the pillar of fire going over people. He
[23:33] would discern them and they would be
[23:34] healed. You can hear them screaming and
[23:37] crying. So, if you haven't watched that
[23:39] video, I'd encourage you to watch that
[23:40] one. There was uh I think he said what
[23:42] 100 or 200 people there in the audience.
[23:45] They saw they witnessed they saw the
[23:47] supernatural pillar of fire. Hallelujah.
[23:51] Why? Because it was his masterpiece.
[23:53] Hallelujah. Notice here the life that
[23:55] was in the husk in the stalk and the
[23:57] tassel of the husk all gathers in the
[23:59] seed. And the life that was in the stalk
[24:02] went one went to make the other.
[24:04] Justification made a way for
[24:05] sanctification. Sanctification made a
[24:07] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[24:09] The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[24:11] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[24:13] down in perfection back to the word
[24:15] again to manifest itself. Now, don't let
[24:18] that stumble you. He lists four steps,
[24:20] but don't let that stumble you because
[24:22] brother called the baptism of Holy
[24:24] Ghost, that was the tongues movement of
[24:25] Isuza Street. He just used that all the
[24:28] time. Uh especially if you go into 1964
[24:31] 65. But there's not four steps. Uh
[24:34] because the Bible said the wheat has
[24:36] three stages. But in other words,
[24:38] brother Ram's recognizing there was a
[24:40] revival in 1906. It was a powerful
[24:41] revival. Hallelujah. No doubt about it.
[24:46] He says back to the word again to
[24:48] manifest itself. Hallelujah.
[24:51] So again, these three stages represent
[24:55] Luther Wesley Brham. Hallelujah. Or as
[24:59] brother Adam put it, Luther Wesley
[25:01] Elijah.
[25:03] Amen. Because we read, "Behold, I send
[25:06] you Elijah."
[25:09] Okay. So, these three stages represent
[25:11] Sardis, Philadelphia, Leodysia.
[25:18] Now, I want I want to remind you of
[25:19] this. Here's where brother Ram said it
[25:20] uh after he preached the seventh seal.
[25:23] Now, the vision, of course, he's
[25:25] speaking of the vision to go out west
[25:26] and when he got the sword in his hand
[25:28] with the third pole of his ministry, the
[25:30] third attraction, the third stage of his
[25:32] ministry, the vision of that and then to
[25:35] go back east and open the seven seals by
[25:37] the revelation of the Holy Ghost. The
[25:39] vision plus the word, all the Bible
[25:41] verses,
[25:43] plus the history he gave out through
[25:44] this, the seven seals, plus the church
[25:47] ages, they all blend together. So I
[25:50] could truly say that to the best of my
[25:52] understanding and according to the word
[25:53] of God and the vision, the revelation,
[25:55] the interpretation thereof is thus saith
[25:58] the Lord. As I've said before many
[26:01] times, who do you know talks like that?
[26:03] Only a true prophet.
[26:06] Hallelujah. The vision, the word,
[26:09] history, the church ages, the seals, it
[26:11] all blends together. It's thus saith the
[26:14] Lord. Hallelujah. And I've and I've I've
[26:18] questioned that in the past as any
[26:20] person does. And I've went and studied
[26:22] history and exactly what brother
[26:24] preached. Ties together perfectly with
[26:26] history. So I know God's proven it to
[26:29] me. It's thus sayith the Lord.
[26:32] Hallelujah. I went and studied the same
[26:34] books brother Ram did and I've compared
[26:36] other history books and everything
[26:38] brother Ram taught about this church
[26:39] agent seals was exactly right with
[26:41] history. It is thus sayith the Lord.
[26:44] Hallelujah. We're just blessed to
[26:45] receive it. Hallelujah. Amen. No doubt
[26:49] about it.
[26:51] Okay. So now what I do, I put this under
[26:54] here, brother Chris. So now,
[26:56] now we can see. Okay. Now these also
[26:58] represent the three stages or the three
[27:01] works of grace. You get saved. Then you
[27:04] get your habits sanctified, your spirit
[27:06] cleaned out, then you get your soul
[27:08] filled with the Holy Ghost. Yeah.
[27:10] Brother Chris, you got a question?
[27:13] Yeah. I don't know about that, brother.
[27:15] I don't know. There's really uh because
[27:17] Ezekiel 36 only lists three stages. And
[27:21] so, Brother Ram wasn't he wasn't making
[27:23] a doctrine out of this. He just made an
[27:24] observation that that the chaff pulled
[27:27] away. And he compares that to the
[27:29] Pentecostals pulled away from brother
[27:30] Ram's ministry. Okay. So, great
[27:32] question. Great question. Uh let's read
[27:34] that since we got it. Uh let's go to
[27:35] Ezekiel 36, brother. Uh 36:26, brother
[27:39] Chris, if you want to read that,
[27:40] brother, whenever you get it. Ezekiel
[27:41] 36:26. This is the three works of grace.
[27:44] They were foretold, prophesied in
[27:46] Ezekiel. So, whenever you're ready,
[27:48] brother.
[27:59] Okay. Can you read 272? Because there's
[28:00] the third step.
[28:08] Amen. Hallelujah. And the church said,
[28:10] see, there's three steps, right? New
[28:12] heart, that's justification. New spirit,
[28:15] new way of thinking, control over your
[28:17] bodily passions, all those statue
[28:19] perfect man attributes over there. And
[28:20] then my spirit. Think about that. You
[28:23] can have a new heart and a new spirit,
[28:24] but you still don't have the Holy Ghost
[28:26] yet. The baptism I'm talking about,
[28:28] right? But that's how God set it up.
[28:30] Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Very good, brother.
[28:32] Yep. Very good. And there's numerous uh
[28:34] I gota I wrote a whole chapter about it.
[28:36] So we we can do a Bible study on that.
[28:38] It'd be great to see that by God's
[28:39] grace. So, Brother Bam said in this
[28:41] masterpiece, Anointed One is end times.
[28:43] He preached, I think, in August 65 if
[28:45] I'm not mistaken. And then, church ages,
[28:47] 1960, uh, three works of grace. He
[28:49] preached it all throughout his ministry.
[28:51] And the next one, the next one,
[28:54] denominations are dead. And I got about
[28:57] 20 minutes there, buddy. I keep looking
[28:58] at you. I'm gonna I'm gonna remember by
[29:00] God's grace. Not going to get carried
[29:02] away in heavenly places. I'm already in
[29:03] heavenly places. By God's grace, I'm
[29:05] already accepted in the beloved.
[29:06] Hallelujah. But um I'm not going to go
[29:08] too late here.
[29:11] The next beautiful thought uh of this
[29:14] masterpiece, just like Moses, right, his
[29:17] beautiful hair and all those details are
[29:19] just beautiful. My wife said uh on
[29:21] Sunday, she said, Jesse, if you look at
[29:22] his arm, he's even got this one muscle
[29:24] that only comes up like when you put
[29:25] your he's got his pinky up like that or
[29:27] something. And there's a certain muscle.
[29:29] I can feel it. It's right there.
[29:31] And Michelangelo played paid so much
[29:34] attention to detail. even had that
[29:36] muscle right there, that little muscle
[29:38] in your forearm. And that's what brother
[29:40] did. He paid so close attention to the
[29:42] scriptures. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[29:45] right. He paid so close attention. He
[29:48] also saw how denominations are dead. He
[29:51] said, "But what denominated dies like
[29:53] life?" And Luther went to make Wesley
[29:56] and from Wesley went to Pentecost and
[29:59] from Pentecost to make the original seed
[30:01] onto Pentecost comes out of Wesley until
[30:02] that time. The reason that Pentecost
[30:04] come out of Wesley because it was no
[30:06] denomination. Pentecost was. Then
[30:09] Pentecost went to denominate and what
[30:11] did it do? It turned to the husk. It
[30:14] looked like the real thing. Okay.
[30:18] No stalk, tassel, husk living. They
[30:20] produced in their early revival a holder
[30:22] of a certain portion of the seed life.
[30:25] But when they organized, the life moved
[30:27] out of it. That's proved by all history.
[30:30] Never an organization ever done a thing
[30:32] after organized. It was dead. That's
[30:34] right. Watch. The life is traveling on
[30:36] now. It's moving. Okay. So, this is a
[30:39] beautiful thought with the wheat plant,
[30:41] brother. The life goes up, right? And
[30:44] once it once all the seeds get all the
[30:47] life in them, the rest of the plant
[30:48] dies, right? You harvest the wheat
[30:50] plant, right? Now, you can do things
[30:53] with the stalk. I guess you could do
[30:54] some Could you do straw or something
[30:55] like that? You could probably do
[30:57] something, but it's it's dead. The life
[30:59] is out of the rest of the plant. The
[31:01] life is in the seed. Everybody got that?
[31:04] The life moves through the plant and it
[31:06] all the life is in the seed. Hallelujah.
[31:08] That's what brother Ram is saying with
[31:10] denominations. The life was in the
[31:12] Lutheran uh but then it moved into the
[31:14] Methodists and then it moved in the
[31:16] Pentecostals and now it's in this
[31:18] message. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[31:21] The life of Jesus Christ is in this
[31:24] message because we have the word of God.
[31:26] Hallelujah. And I know that because I
[31:28] was raised in a Pentecostal and I didn't
[31:30] have the I don't live the life that I
[31:32] live right now. Amen. And everybody in
[31:35] that church, my family that came to the
[31:38] message, we all live a higher life
[31:39] spiritually than the Pentecostals. Not
[31:41] to brag, but it's bragging on Jesus.
[31:43] Hallelujah.
[31:45] If Christ is in you, you live a higher
[31:47] life. And the church said, "Glory."
[31:50] Didn't didn't Jesus say, "The Holy Ghost
[31:52] will guide you into all truth." That's
[31:55] the point. We can live a higher life
[31:57] because the Holy Ghost leads us into
[31:59] more truth. It's not to make ourselves
[32:01] better. We're not better. We just uh
[32:03] receive more grace by the grace of God.
[32:06] Because Paul said, "I've labored more
[32:08] than all of you." He said, "Not I, but
[32:11] the grace of God that was given to me."
[32:14] Brother Austin, how do you labor more
[32:16] than the Catholics? Because God's grace
[32:17] has given it to you. Right? Hallelujah.
[32:20] Same thing for each one of us. How do we
[32:22] labor more for Jesus than the
[32:23] denomination? Because God has given us
[32:25] more grace because we've accepted more
[32:27] grace. We've received more grace. But
[32:30] the life flowed through the
[32:31] denominations with each one. When a new
[32:34] denomination started, the old one died.
[32:37] God moved out of there.
[32:39] Okay, I think you got that. Notice what
[32:42] they have done. All these have done is
[32:44] proved by history just exactly the way
[32:45] the church has has come. Never to be
[32:47] used to him again.
[32:50] Organization is laid on the shelf.
[32:51] There's never been in all history a
[32:53] church after organized that but it died
[32:56] and the organization died and never did
[32:58] raise again. Can't you see it? Men who
[33:00] are blind open your eyes nature and the
[33:02] word co-ordinating together coordinating
[33:05] together and proving it right here that
[33:08] this is the truth. That this is the
[33:10] truth. In other words, brother Ram's
[33:11] message is the truth that life leaves
[33:14] the stalk to make the tassel. From the
[33:16] tassel it makes the husk and from the
[33:18] husk it goes into the original again.
[33:20] Notice never again to be useful to him.
[33:24] How is God going to use the Catholic
[33:25] Church today?
[33:27] They're praying to Mary. The the priest
[33:29] of uh I need prayer. I need healing.
[33:31] Okay, pray to Mary.
[33:33] Mary can't hear you. How's that going to
[33:35] help you? Uh pray to St. Joseph. Joseph
[33:37] can't Joseph's not the mediator between
[33:39] God and man. How is that going to help
[33:42] you? Oh, I'm sick. If I went to the
[33:44] Assembly of God, I'm sick. Okay, let's
[33:45] pray till you speak in tonesues and God
[33:46] will heal you. That's tongues. Tonesues
[33:48] is a different gift than healing. Praise
[33:50] God. Right? It's a different whole
[33:52] different thing together. It's totally
[33:54] different. So, it proves that God has
[33:57] moved on from those movements. And now
[33:59] we're to have the life of Jesus Christ.
[34:01] Yes, we're supposed to have healing. Uh
[34:03] we've had three, four people speak in
[34:04] tonesues here, but you can speak in
[34:06] tonesues all day and still not have the
[34:08] life. We must have the life of Jesus
[34:10] Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's
[34:13] right. Amen. Don't you see why he never
[34:15] used an organization? He can't get back
[34:18] in it again.
[34:19] Do you think the life once the life is
[34:21] in those seed grains, you think it's
[34:22] going to go back down? Do you think the
[34:24] seeds ever going to lose any of the
[34:25] qualities of it of of its uh
[34:27] chromosomes?
[34:29] No. No. Didn't brother say that they
[34:32] kept seeds from the days of Joseph and
[34:33] planted them, I think maybe in his day,
[34:35] and they still worked like they they
[34:37] still had life in them
[34:39] because the life goes in the seed. So,
[34:42] brother Chris, that's what I want to
[34:43] explain. The life once it's in the seed,
[34:45] it doesn't go back in down to the plant.
[34:47] It stays in the seed. So that's what
[34:49] brother Ram said. The life is not going
[34:50] to go back into Lutheran and Catholic
[34:52] and Methodist and Baptist. The life is
[34:54] going to stay in the word, the message.
[34:55] Hallelujah.
[34:58] He can't get back in it again. It's
[35:00] dead. But the life passes on from one to
[35:03] the other. See, they put creeds and
[35:05] inject.
[35:07] Whosoever shall add one word or take one
[35:10] word out, see he's blocked off from it.
[35:12] Is everybody familiar with that
[35:14] scripture? Revelation 22:18-19.
[35:18] Brother Chris, do you know that one?
[35:19] Okay, let's read that. Lydia, you want
[35:20] to get that? Revelation 22:18-19.
[35:23] This is a very stern warning to anyone
[35:26] who handles the word of God, especially
[35:28] preachers. They'll be judged more
[35:29] harshly than congregations.
[35:32] Whenever you're ready, Lydia, go ahead.
[35:53] How many believe that's a very stern
[35:55] warning there? So, brother Chris, let me
[35:56] give you two examples. Yeah. Amen.
[35:59] Right, brother. So, brother, any church
[36:01] that adds women preachers in here,
[36:03] you'll have they'll have plagues added
[36:04] to them if they don't repent.
[36:06] Adding praying to Mary, anything they
[36:08] add to this, the plagues will be added
[36:11] to them. The other thing is they take
[36:13] things out of here. Oh, it's okay to be
[36:15] homosexual. What what they're doing is
[36:16] really ripping out chapters of the
[36:18] entire chapters in thisi this Bible. And
[36:21] so their name will be taken off the book
[36:23] of life because they took the the truth
[36:26] out of the word of God. Hallelujah. And
[36:28] that's why those denominations die. They
[36:30] don't have the life of Christ. They
[36:31] might have bigger numbers, but God
[36:32] doesn't worry about numbers. God worries
[36:34] about quality, not quantity.
[36:41] Hallelujah.
[36:42] All right. So simple. Simple enough by
[36:44] God's grace. Amen. Uh this might be my
[36:47] last one. It's I'm almost at 7:45 here.
[36:50] The next thought, which is this is why I
[36:52] read Malachi 45 and 6. Uh the next
[36:54] thought in this masterpiece, the next
[36:55] part of it, it's the end time
[36:57] restoration of the bride because the
[36:59] seed that went in the ground has to come
[37:01] back to its original form. In other
[37:02] words, the seed has to produce more
[37:04] seeds. Hallelujah.
[37:07] I'm using this in a parable now of the
[37:09] bride, the masterpiece that's coming
[37:10] forth. As the masterpiece fell, there's
[37:13] a masterpiece rising.
[37:16] Hallelujah. He's talking about the
[37:17] church, how they uh the church was
[37:18] almost extinct, right? Uh during the
[37:20] dark ages, he also uses Nika as well. Na
[37:23] Rome around 3:25 AD. She's come through
[37:27] a process, but she's coming right back
[37:29] again to that masterpiece perfected
[37:31] because she's a part of that word that
[37:34] was spoken by him.
[37:36] He'll have a church without spot or a
[37:40] wrinkle.
[37:42] So that means no sin. That means no
[37:44] adding to the word, no taking any word
[37:45] of the way. Right? That's a church
[37:48] without spot or wrinkle wrinkle. So
[37:50] church, what do we want to do? We just
[37:52] want to be Bible believers.
[37:54] Now the danger today is where people
[37:56] say, "Oh, every word of Brother
[37:57] Brandham, thus sayith the Lord." You
[37:59] poor deceived hypocrite. Brother
[38:01] Brandham said, Brother Brham said
[38:03] there's mixups on the tapes. Brother Bam
[38:04] said, "I'm not infallible."
[38:07] Brother Bam said, "My words will fail,
[38:08] but God's words will never fail." I
[38:11] preach on that a lot, don't I? That's
[38:13] because I can't stand that deity spirit,
[38:15] right? It's the Antichrist. They They
[38:17] worship Brother Brandham. But did
[38:18] brother Brandham point us to the word?
[38:19] Yes. Did Brother Brandham speak with us,
[38:21] say the Lord? Yes. And so we accept
[38:23] those. Brother Brandham said, "Prove
[38:24] everything I say by the Bible." Prove
[38:27] all things by the scripture. Brother
[38:29] Bram said, hallelujah.
[38:32] See it can't it'll not be connected any
[38:35] way with any kind of an organization
[38:36] denomination the curse thing. So the
[38:39] Pentecostal denomination is cursed.
[38:42] That's when I was raised in. It's passed
[38:44] through those things but it will never
[38:46] be there. In other words, it won't be in
[38:48] the bride. There'll be no denomination
[38:50] the bride because they add to the word
[38:52] or they take away. So brother Chris the
[38:55] denomination I was raised in assembly of
[38:57] God. They've added tongues as the
[38:58] evidence to the Bible. That's not the
[39:00] evidence. There's five times the Holy
[39:02] Ghost fell in the book of Acts. Only
[39:03] three of them have tongues. Two of them
[39:04] don't have tongues. Right. And then Paul
[39:07] said, "Do all speak with tongues?" Of
[39:09] course, no. The answer is no.
[39:10] Hallelujah.
[39:12] All right. Let me see how many I got to
[39:14] find a place to close here. Let me see.
[39:16] Okay. Yeah. I think I'll close with that
[39:17] one. Okay. Uh yeah. Now, notice he said
[39:21] the husk when it comes forth looks just
[39:22] like the grain. But when the grain life
[39:24] begins to leave the husk to go to make
[39:27] the grain, the bride,
[39:30] the husk opens up and excommunicates the
[39:33] grain.
[39:35] So I I could we could have named our
[39:36] church grain of Christ fellowship.
[39:41] The husk opens up and excommunicates the
[39:43] grain. I don't know if everybody caught
[39:44] that, but nature. That's exactly what
[39:46] she did in Revelation 3. Now look, this
[39:48] is a beautiful thought. I shared this on
[39:50] Sunday, but I want you to show this. I
[39:51] want to show this again.
[39:53] the husk pulled away from the grain. And
[39:56] brother said, "Let me show you the
[39:57] scripture for that."
[39:59] Revelation 3:20.
[40:03] Revelation 3:20.
[40:06] Do you want to read that, Sister Kim? Do
[40:07] you want to read that for us?
[40:19] Amen. Let's go for two claps. Thank you.
[40:22] We always cheer on people who clap or
[40:24] I'm sorry who read rather but our people
[40:26] are used to it. Your visitors we're
[40:27] going to clap for you. Hallelujah.
[40:30] Brother Ram had women read scriptures in
[40:32] his services. I've heard it. Listen to
[40:33] the adoption series. He had them he did
[40:35] that at times.
[40:38] So So again, the the husk pulling away
[40:42] from the grain. Brother Ram said that is
[40:44] that scripture the the Pentecostal
[40:46] church has pulled away from brother
[40:47] Ram's Bible message and now Jesus is
[40:50] trying to get back into the church. The
[40:53] se the seed is outside the church and
[40:55] the church said the seed is outside the
[40:57] husk. Jesus outside the church. That's
[41:00] beautiful. That's beautiful how we saw
[41:02] that. He said it had to be the Holy
[41:04] Ghost. Now see it didn't back in the
[41:06] other ages because there was something
[41:08] else yet to be made. So notice Jesus was
[41:10] never outside the church till the
[41:12] Leodysian church age. Now he's on the
[41:15] outside trying to get back in. Can I
[41:16] please get in to my church? Hallelujah.
[41:19] He said it passed through and went on to
[41:21] another. I've told you all along there's
[41:22] no more denominations coming. We're at
[41:25] the end. And they put him out because
[41:26] why? He's the word again. He's the one
[41:28] that fell down there. He's the same
[41:31] doctrine. Notice that word. We have to
[41:33] have miracles and we have to have
[41:35] doctrine. We have to have both. We have
[41:37] to have the spirit, miracles, and the
[41:39] word doctrine. Okay? And that's second
[41:42] John 1:9. Would you like to read that,
[41:44] Sister Sandy? Would that be okay? Second
[41:45] John 1:9. Take your time because I'm
[41:47] going to keep reading here. He's the
[41:48] same doctrine that come forth from the
[41:51] beginning. And when the seed word begins
[41:54] to grow forth, the husk puts it from
[41:57] itself. The life leaves all the others
[42:00] to follow it. See, that's why we got to
[42:02] follow the word, right? Wherever the
[42:05] word takes us, we got to follow the word
[42:07] of God. That's the true believers. They
[42:10] follow the life wherever the life goes.
[42:12] And let me just add this in here. If you
[42:14] are in a message church and they started
[42:16] preaching false doctrine, you've got to
[42:18] leave that church and go to where there
[42:20] is life because you will always follow
[42:23] the word. And the church said, if I
[42:25] preach false doctrine and you come to me
[42:27] and I don't correct it, you should leave
[42:28] and find somewhere else to go. You have
[42:31] my permission. I'm not going to keep you
[42:32] here by fear. You go where the life
[42:34] goes. But I've got life. Hallelujah.
[42:36] Amen. And we've kept it straight for 20
[42:39] or 19 years. Our church has been going
[42:41] on for 19 years. We kept it straight
[42:43] because we're found in the life. The
[42:45] life is in us. And we can do nothing
[42:46] else except follow the life. Hallelujah.
[42:49] Amen. Sister, you want to read that? 2
[42:51] John 1:9.
[43:01] Give her two class. Great job, Sister
[43:03] Sandy. Hallelujah. I love that verse
[43:06] because brother Ram said he's the same
[43:08] doctrine,
[43:10] right?
[43:12] So, he's both spirit and life. Brother
[43:14] Ram says in uh the rising of the sun,
[43:16] mechanics and dynamics. Good. You got to
[43:21] have you gota if you got a car, brother
[43:23] said it's great if you got all the
[43:24] parts. Everything's in place. He said,
[43:26] but you need a spark to get it going.
[43:29] Hallelujah. If you don't have a spark
[43:31] plug, you ain't going no matter how nice
[43:32] it looks, you're not going anywhere.
[43:34] Same thing for us. We can we can know
[43:36] all the word. But we got to have the
[43:38] Holy Ghost here to do supernatural
[43:39] things. Praise God. We got to have both.
[43:42] And thank God we got it by God's grace.
[43:44] We just had a a word of faith, right? We
[43:46] just had the gift of faith operate
[43:48] before Tulsi was born back in May.
[43:50] Foretold the future. Hallelujah. By
[43:53] God's grace. Amen.
[43:55] See, so you got to have the spark. You
[43:57] got to have the life as well. And you
[43:59] got to have the right doctrine. I like
[44:00] what brother said. He's the same
[44:02] doctrine.
[44:04] So, we have the same doctrine in the
[44:05] book of Acts church. And we have to have
[44:07] supernatural miracles, signs and
[44:08] wonders, and the gifts of the Holy
[44:09] Ghost. He's going to say it later. I'm
[44:11] not going to get to tonight, but brother
[44:12] says, uh, we don't go after the gifts.
[44:14] He said, but we get the life of the
[44:16] gifts.
[44:18] So, gifts do operate in our lives, but
[44:20] it's not our main thing we go after.
[44:21] Like the Pentecostal church I was always
[44:23] in. Tongue tongue tongue tongue tongue
[44:25] church every once a year in the summer
[44:27] they'd have a revival a week long
[44:28] revival and every night the they'd have
[44:30] a evangelist come up and he'd invite
[44:32] everybody up and they would just pray
[44:33] for you and and say Jesus Jesus Jesus
[44:35] till you get the Holy Ghost every year.
[44:38] It was like clockwork, right? And I was
[44:39] raising I was raising. I know what I'm
[44:41] talking about. And it was just tongues,
[44:43] tongues, tones, tongues, tongues, right?
[44:45] And one night I went up there, I was
[44:46] eight or nine years old. They called me
[44:47] up there. I took the sucker out of my
[44:49] mouth. I was licking a sucker in church.
[44:52] That kind of tells you about no deacons
[44:53] in the church. If you lick a sucker
[44:56] here, I'm gonna say, "Could you go throw
[44:57] that sucker away?"
[45:00] And I and and there was anointing there.
[45:02] They prayed for me. My grandpa shook me.
[45:04] You know, my grandpa loves me. He's
[45:05] like, "Ah, Jesse, come on. Is that
[45:06] okay?" Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hope I don't
[45:08] hurt your neck there, buddy. You're
[45:09] good. But he's just praying for me. I'm
[45:10] like, and just under that anointing and
[45:12] the I started saying, "Jesus, I started
[45:14] crying and they they they thought I
[45:16] spoke in tonesues." Well, church, I
[45:17] walked away there. I didn't know I
[45:18] didn't speak in tonesues. My word just
[45:20] got jobbled up or whatever.
[45:24] It wasn't stammering lips. It was just
[45:25] mixed up lips. Stammering lips was a
[45:28] real thing. And the Bible says that they
[45:29] really spoke in tongues. And the proof
[45:32] of it was after they prayed, I put the
[45:34] sucker in. I was crying, but I walked
[45:35] back outside and played some baseball.
[45:37] But every year that that's what it was.
[45:40] But see, if you have God's word, you'll
[45:43] follow the life of the word. Hallelujah.
[45:46] Now, what we need is more people seeking
[45:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If you
[45:50] don't have it,
[45:51] like I said, come up here. We'll pray
[45:53] for you. Lay at the altar. Uh, wait.
[45:55] Whatever you need. Brother says, "As
[45:57] long as you need to die out, that's you
[45:58] need to die out to be born again."
[46:00] Hallelujah.
[46:02] Hallelujah. Thank God. Okay, now I'm
[46:05] already at my 40 minutes here. So, let
[46:06] me look at the last slide here. I might
[46:07] do one more here uh to kind of finish
[46:10] up. Yeah, let's finish up with one
[46:12] quote, one slide here. Okay. like
[46:15] Israel. So, brother gives us another
[46:16] example. So, not only do we have the
[46:18] wheat seed, not only do we have the
[46:20] three works of grace, now he's going to
[46:21] give us a third example of it, the
[46:23] pillar of fire with Israel.
[46:25] Okay? So, listen. But in a perfect type,
[46:28] in the beginning, everywhere the pillar
[46:30] of fire went was life.
[46:34] As long as they follow the pillar of
[46:35] fire, they had life.
[46:38] Right? God was that light. And I don't
[46:40] care if it was midnight or whether they
[46:41] was in a good selected place. When that
[46:43] pillar of fire moved, the trumpet
[46:45] sounded and Israel moved with it.
[46:47] Hallelujah. And when the trumpet
[46:50] sounded, Martin Luther moved out with
[46:51] it. He organized
[46:54] uh not he himself, the men after him. I
[46:57] believe Martin Luther had the baptism of
[46:59] the Holy Ghost. I believe that. Now, I
[47:01] could be wrong. Some people think he
[47:02] only has a portion, but I believe
[47:03] according to the life he lived, I
[47:05] believe he had the baptism of the Holy
[47:06] Ghost. But his eyes just couldn't see
[47:08] all the revelation of the word. That's
[47:10] just my thought. Because when was the
[47:11] last time you put your life on the line
[47:13] like he did and sacrifice all that he
[47:16] did for the gospel of Jesus Christ? Most
[47:18] people today don't even compare to him,
[47:19] which they don't have to. He's one of
[47:20] the seven stars. Like he's he's one of
[47:23] the seven stars in the hand of Jesus
[47:24] with Paul, with brother Brandham, with
[47:26] John Wesley. Brother said sometimes he'd
[47:28] preach eight sermons a day and they'd
[47:30] throw vegetables at him and all kinds of
[47:32] things. Beat him up, all kinds of
[47:33] things. There's a few times he almost
[47:35] lost his life getting beat up. John
[47:36] Wesley.
[47:39] See the men after Martin Luther
[47:41] denominated and then God took the life
[47:43] out of that brought it in and laid it
[47:45] down in a grave. Okay, this was my last
[47:47] slide. Musicians can come because I'm
[47:49] going to make sure I close. I'm not
[47:50] going to not going to transgress my
[47:52] word. But brother did say though,
[47:55] brother did say in that mastery sermon,
[47:56] he said, "I broke my own rule." He said
[47:58] I was only going to preach, listen to
[47:59] it. He said, "I said I was only going to
[48:01] preach an hour." He preached two hours
[48:02] and 17 minutes.
[48:04] He said he told the brother, "Set the
[48:06] timer, let the light go off at 30
[48:08] minutes." And when he passed 30 minutes,
[48:09] he's like, "Brother, you don't do the
[48:10] light off." He said, "I guess I I break
[48:12] my own rules."
[48:15] See, I try to make a rule. I try to
[48:16] follow.
[48:18] So, here's the uh Now, I added this
[48:20] that's just a nucleus of a cell, right?
[48:22] That's where the life is. The life is in
[48:23] the the the nucleus of the cell. So,
[48:26] that that's what is the life of that the
[48:28] the life in the nucleus here in the
[48:30] cells. The life flows up, okay, to the
[48:34] seed. And now now the life is in here.
[48:37] Once the life's in here, this dies.
[48:40] Okay. When the har after the harvest,
[48:41] I'm talking about after.
[48:44] And so said another example is a pillar
[48:46] of fire. Israel, the pillar of fire led
[48:49] them through the Red Sea. And then the
[48:52] pillar of fire led them through the
[48:53] wilderness. And then the pillar of fire
[48:55] in Joshua's day led them into the
[48:58] promised land, which is a type of the
[49:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[49:02] Hallelujah. How many How many can
[49:03] understand that by God's grace?
[49:06] Are you glad I went over it twice? Okay,
[49:08] let's stand to our feet. Praise God.
[49:10] I'll stop right there. That's a That's
[49:12] actually a really good place to stop.
[49:15] Now, let me just show this. I'm just
[49:16] going to show this one. Give me one
[49:18] more. This is for Sunday. Brother
[49:21] Brandon has a vision. How many remember
[49:22] the preview of the the bride vision? He
[49:24] sees the early Pentecost church walk by
[49:26] and they're marching. He's like, "Oh,
[49:28] this is holy. This is beautiful." And
[49:29] then he sees a church of uh Asia, uh
[49:32] Switzerland, Germany. And then he sees
[49:34] the American church. She said, "That's
[49:35] the worst of all." But said, he started
[49:37] crying.
[49:38] He said, "Is it after all the laboring
[49:40] I've done, the prayers, is this all we
[49:42] could produce?" But said, the voice
[49:43] said, "Here comes the bride one more
[49:45] time."
[49:47] Thank God. And you and I were in that
[49:49] group, I believe. Hallelujah. And he
[49:51] says, "Oh, it's the church. She looks
[49:53] just like she did at the beginning."
[49:56] God's masterpiece. You start with a
[49:58] seed, it produces a whole plant, and
[50:01] then it ends up with another seed. From
[50:04] seed to seed, from glory to from faith
[50:08] to Hallelujah. The light shines more
[50:11] unto a perfect day. Let's bow our heads
[50:14] here. We'll try to get to that, Lord
[50:16] willing, on Sunday. Yeah, that was about
[50:18] 45 minutes or so by God's grace.
[50:21] Hallelujah.
[50:23] Brother Random said, "I'm the happiest
[50:25] person because God let me see this
[50:28] masterpiece." Church, let's leave here
[50:30] happy tonight.
[50:32] There's actually life in our church.
[50:35] Cuz if I took you down the Assembly of
[50:36] God, they say, "Well, you only got the
[50:37] Holy Ghost, so you speak in tonesues."
[50:39] And you try try. You might feel so bad.
[50:42] You might pretend to speak in tongues
[50:43] just so you you get some relief off your
[50:46] off your shoulders. But church, there's
[50:48] real life here.
[50:50] I've seen it, Brother Chris. I've known
[50:52] many people that spoke in tongues turned
[50:53] out to be thieves,
[50:55] adulterers,
[50:57] fornicators.
[50:59] But brother, God has kept our church
[51:01] clean. We got the spirit and the word.
[51:05] Hallelujah. The life of Jesus Christ.
[51:09] And if you don't know, watch my life.
[51:11] Austin's watching my life. Ask my
[51:13] children about my life. Look at my
[51:15] children's life. That's what sets
[51:17] Christians apart from everybody else.
[51:19] The life that they live. the full life.
[51:21] Not just if whether you speak in tongues
[51:23] or you have a miracle here or there,
[51:24] which that's all we can ask. We can't
[51:26] make God do any miracles, but it's
[51:29] living the life of Jesus Christ. Does
[51:31] that make sense? Amen. Praise God. God
[51:33] is good to us. Let's bow our heads.
[51:36] Father God, we're thankful for today.
[51:37] Thank you for these great truths of the
[51:39] masterpiece that you gave to your
[51:41] prophet. This is Elijah's masterpiece,
[51:43] Lord God. Hallelujah. Lord, this meant
[51:46] so much to me when I heard it. And I
[51:48] thank you, Lord, for letting me hear in
[51:50] a special way that I never heard it
[51:51] before where I heard Brother Am said,
[51:53] "Let me let if this is my last sermon,
[51:55] let me tell you my masterpiece." And
[51:58] Lord, I'm so glad I can see the
[51:59] masterpiece. The anointed ones of the
[52:01] end time, the church ages. Hallelujah.
[52:04] Grant it, Lord God, that the three works
[52:06] of grace denominations are dead because
[52:08] the life has left. Oh, thank you, God,
[52:11] for your mercy and grace. Lord, of all
[52:14] my Christian friends that I've met since
[52:15] I've been a child, I can attest that the
[52:18] greatest life of Christ I've seen is in
[52:20] this message. I wouldn't be here, Lord,
[52:22] if I didn't believe that. So God, help
[52:24] us, encourage us to keep living the life
[52:26] we're living, but actually live closer
[52:28] to you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[52:31] Oh Lord, let the full life in the grain,
[52:33] Lord God. Let it be produced in our
[52:35] lives, Lord God. May we keep growing up
[52:37] into the stature, the fullness of Jesus
[52:39] Christ. We're thankful for your prophet,
[52:42] but our prophet was not our God. Our
[52:44] prophet was not our savior. Jesus Christ
[52:47] is our savior. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[52:49] God.
[52:51] And brother Ram's masterpiece wasn't
[52:52] himself. It was the idea of the wheat
[52:55] plant, the life of Jesus Christ, going
[52:58] from seed all the way up to reproducing
[53:01] more seed.
[53:03] Lord, that's what Isaiah 53 said. He
[53:05] shall have travail of soul and he shall
[53:08] see his seed. He shall see the
[53:10] masterpiece reproduced. Oh God, let us
[53:14] be a real work of God. Lord, even our
[53:16] visitors, bless them. Whatever works in
[53:18] their lives you need to do, I pray you'd
[53:20] complete it in their lives. Lord,
[53:22] remember the home church, Lord. My my
[53:24] life needs work. You're still chipping
[53:26] away at my life, Lord. That's what
[53:28] brother said at the end of the sermon.
[53:30] He said, "We don't feel like
[53:31] masterpieces. So keep working on us,
[53:33] Lord. God, keep working on every person
[53:36] here from the eldest to the youngest,
[53:38] Lord. God,
[53:40] each member of the body of Christ, keep
[53:43] working on us, Lord God. Make us more
[53:45] like you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[53:49] And we just want to say thank you, Lord.
[53:50] If your prophet was happy for this
[53:52] masterpiece, we should be happy, too.
[53:56] Lord, we love you. We give you all the
[53:57] honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name.
[54:00] And the saints said,
