[0:10] let's go to the book of first john
[0:12] chapter two i just want to start a short
[0:13] little series here
[0:17] i just like to look at the spirit of
[0:18] pride but i just want to call it
[0:20] overcoming pride by god's grace
[0:22] overcoming pride kind of goes with the
[0:25] doctrines of devils series we were
[0:26] looking at recently
[0:28] um
[0:29] so i like to just call it overcoming
[0:31] pride
[0:32] first john chapter 2 verses 15 through
[0:35] 17.
[0:42] again it's great to see everybody today
[0:44] and last sunday i missed the clap for

[1:33] austin's october
[1:34] october 15th by god's grace
[1:37] hallelujah god a couple maze coming up
[1:40] here first john chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:54] and hopefully as you know hopefully as
[1:56] we minister this morning or as the holy
[1:58] spirit ministers through me
[1:59] uh you'll see why this is such a crucial
[2:02] subject
[2:03] because i believe as far as right now i
[2:05] could be wrong but i believe pride is
[2:07] the evil spirit that we will battle the
[2:10] most
[2:11] and fall to the most
[2:14] the spirit of pride
[2:16] that's just my
[2:18] my understanding of it right now i could
[2:20] be wrong
[2:22] but i feel like that's what i've seen in
[2:23] brother branham's life
[2:26] my life
[2:27] the scriptures
[2:29] i feel like pride is the evil spirit
[2:31] that we will be deceived by the most or
[2:34] just willingly give into the most
[2:37] and of course we'll have to repent for
[2:39] our sins
[2:40] and that god is faithful and just to
[2:42] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[2:44] help us to walk in the light as he's in
[2:46] the light
[2:47] first john 2 15.
[2:54] i'll read 15 and 17 and we'll all read
[2:57] 16. so let me read 15
[2:59] love not the world neither the things
[3:01] that are in the world if any man love
[3:04] the world the love of the father
[3:06] is not in him let's read 16 1-3 for all
[3:10] that is in the world the lust of the
[3:13] flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
[3:16] pride of life is not of the father but
[3:20] is of the world i love verse 17 and the
[3:22] world passeth away don't we see it
[3:24] passed away all the time
[3:26] this person that person that trend that
[3:28] idea that thought
[3:29] the world passes away
[3:31] and the lust thereof
[3:34] but he that doeth the will of god
[3:37] abideth forever how many want to buy it
[3:39] forever
[3:40] how many would say pray for me
[3:42] and let's pray for one another that god
[3:44] helped me to obey the word of god that i
[3:46] can live live forever abide forever
[3:48] let's my hands up too let's pray
[3:49] heavenly father we just come reverently
[3:51] this is the way you set up lord to
[3:54] strengthen your people was by the
[3:56] preaching of the word the world calls it
[3:58] foolishness but to us it is the power of
[4:01] god so lord let your power rest upon
[4:04] each one of us lord as we heard with
[4:06] brother dennis lord whatever state we're
[4:08] in may the power of god may we be
[4:10] content in the state we're in lord in
[4:12] obedience and lord may the power of
[4:15] christ rest upon us this morning
[4:17] lord as i've looked at this subject now
[4:19] for weeks and weeks lord and just kind
[4:20] of waiting lord i've just
[4:23] i've just been convinced this is the sin
[4:25] i fall to the most
[4:27] this is the sin lord
[4:29] we see that believers fall to the most
[4:32] so help us dear god help us lord as we
[4:34] revisit this subject lord god i pray god
[4:37] that we would overcome pride hallelujah
[4:40] and we would have the real spirit of
[4:41] humility that christ had
[4:45] where he said i can do nothing except
[4:47] the father shows me first so god may we
[4:49] always do what you tell us to do first
[4:52] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[4:54] said
[4:54] amen god bless you as you're being
[4:56] seated praise god
[5:03] i think for the sake of this
[5:07] message i think i'll start with a
[5:10] quote here from brother branham
[5:12] in just a moment but
[5:23] just a few thoughts about our text here
[5:25] from 1st john
[5:27] we see the three channels of temptation
[5:30] these are the channels
[5:31] eve battled in the beginning
[5:33] and
[5:34] for the very first temptation adam as
[5:36] well
[5:37] and they're the same temptations jesus
[5:39] battled
[5:40] when satan met him face to face
[5:43] and so these are the channels that you
[5:45] and i must battle
[5:47] every single day of our lives
[5:49] i'm thankful you know we battle
[5:50] sometimes we go through difficult
[5:52] seasons i'm thankful for the seasons of
[5:54] rest aren't you
[5:55] when i feel like i can take a deep
[5:57] breath
[5:58] and i can just enjoy serving the lord
[6:00] and i don't have the intense battles but
[6:02] then there are those weeks those months
[6:05] you know god forbid years
[6:08] when people get really awful diseases or
[6:10] sicknesses
[6:12] or like in the case of my father you
[6:13] know years of depression where they go
[6:16] and this of course self-imposed many of
[6:18] these times you know self-inflicted
[6:22] but there are going to be those long
[6:23] seasons where we're going to need to
[6:25] trust in god we're going to need someone
[6:27] anointed to the holy spirit to come up
[6:29] and give us a word of encouragement
[6:31] we need someone to show us a word of
[6:33] kindness because we don't feel very kind
[6:37] we need someone to show us love because
[6:38] we don't feel very lovely
[6:41] and so may god help us to be sensitive
[6:42] if we're in a spirit of victory help us
[6:44] to may god help us to have
[6:46] uh
[6:47] just love that can pour out of our lives
[6:49] and a manifestation of god's love
[6:52] that can just flow into other people
[6:55] this i saw yesterday there's a man he
[6:57] older man he's got to be in the 60s he's
[6:58] got to be he lost all his hair and he's
[7:00] you know he's got wrinkly skin
[7:02] uh he's the one that put in our we had
[7:04] to get a new fridge because other one
[7:06] but basically you know
[7:08] busted i guess
[7:10] but this old man worked you know for an
[7:12] hour to get our old fridge out and bring
[7:14] in the new one i wasn't there but he
[7:16] left his pocket knife
[7:18] and so we left it there at the house
[7:20] told him he can come pick it up any
[7:21] anytime it was hanging from the doorknob
[7:23] you know well he come right when i was
[7:25] leaving last night
[7:28] and he's just a real short guy real tiny
[7:29] guy
[7:30] and i just you know i was talking to him
[7:32] i just looked over and i said you know i
[7:33] just want to thank you i just kind of
[7:34] felt like i should share the love of god
[7:36] i said i just want to thank you
[7:38] for uh
[7:40] helping us helping our family
[7:42] uh get out this this old fridge and put
[7:44] in the new fridge
[7:46] and i said i believe god anointed you to
[7:48] do that
[7:50] and i said i just want to tell you i
[7:51] really appreciate that he's like thank
[7:53] you he's like oh that makes me feel
[7:55] really good
[7:57] uh and he said i've heard a saying that
[7:59] um the most important need is the uh the
[8:02] most important person is the one who
[8:03] meets your need that you have right at
[8:05] that moment
[8:06] and i thought isn't that the truth
[8:08] like let's say you got a flat tower
[8:09] who's the most important person to you
[8:11] then the person who's going to help you
[8:12] get on a good tire
[8:14] right
[8:15] so in other words in your hour of trial
[8:17] who's the most who's the most important
[8:19] person the person who's the servant the
[8:21] person who helps you at that time
[8:24] but we just started talking about the
[8:25] lord and and how every part of the body
[8:27] is so important you know everybody in
[8:29] the body of christ is so important and
[8:31] how god has no big ones and no no little
[8:33] ones they're all just god's children
[8:35] praise god
[8:37] and uh just to see his face you know
[8:38] turn it from like a stern to a smile by
[8:40] the end and by the end i'm like god
[8:42] bless you man god jesus loves you jesus
[8:44] loves you i said never forget jesus
[8:46] loves you
[8:47] and he drives away and he's waving
[8:48] goodbye we're waving divine just a good
[8:51] example of how
[8:52] we can be such a light to other people
[8:54] just reminded me of how we we got to be
[8:56] there and lift people up praise god and
[8:57] try to try to put a smile on their face
[8:59] by the grace of god the bible said a
[9:01] merry heart maketh medicine
[9:03] hallelujah
[9:04] but you know we're going to not getting
[9:06] back to this we're going to battle these
[9:07] three channels and and we want to be
[9:09] when we're strong we want to be strength
[9:11] to other people
[9:13] we want to be an example the bible said
[9:14] when you're young be an example unto the
[9:16] believers praise god
[9:18] hallelujah
[9:21] so we're going to battle these three
[9:22] throughout the seasons of our lives
[9:25] but like joshua remember we're going to
[9:26] stay with that joshua theme here
[9:28] since god bless us with so many great
[9:30] thoughts and revelations in there and
[9:32] blessings
[9:34] we can conquer and possess
[9:36] all the gates of the enemy
[9:38] hallelujah
[9:39] so
[9:40] the the pride of life is a very
[9:44] i say a major gate of the enemy
[9:47] in other words there's areas of there's
[9:49] uh in in the in the inheritance god has
[9:52] for us in god's plan for our lives in
[9:54] order to conquer all of it
[9:56] one of the major gates is pride
[10:00] and we've got to be able to conquer that
[10:02] gate we've got to be able to approach
[10:04] that and we've got to conquer that by
[10:06] humility praise god
[10:09] and then can i say it like this you know
[10:10] we'll drive back the gates we'll move
[10:12] the gates we'll possess the land but if
[10:14] we're not careful
[10:16] we we we won't drive it out all the way
[10:19] how many want to drive it out all the
[10:20] way praise god
[10:24] there's so many good thoughts in here
[10:25] but i want to just read this quote this
[10:27] is from influence
[10:29] november 14th 64. brother bam said any
[10:32] man is subject to mistakes
[10:35] he's subject to heir because he's human
[10:38] he's subject to the violations of god's
[10:40] laws and he's subject to many things
[10:43] because satan tempts him and he is just
[10:46] a human being
[10:48] now we got to balance that out with
[10:50] you're more than a conqueror you're an
[10:52] adopted son of god
[10:54] your soul doesn't sin amen right
[10:59] with all those are all true all those
[11:00] statements are true but at the same time
[11:03] you are just a human can we all say i'm
[11:05] just a human i'm just a human
[11:08] now we should not continue in sin that
[11:10] grace may abound but we should
[11:12] remember that we have a human element we
[11:16] won't get the victory over it fully on
[11:18] this side and there's going to be times
[11:20] when we feel just like a human
[11:23] we don't feel divine we don't feel
[11:25] inspired we don't feel anointed
[11:30] we don't feel like a conqueror in fact
[11:32] we feel like a failure
[11:35] i know
[11:35] when i get a chance i want to look up
[11:37] that quote where brother bam says
[11:38] sometimes i don't even feel like i'm
[11:39] saved and see what year that was
[11:43] maybe i can look it up
[11:45] real quick feel like
[11:47] i just had that thought i'm saved
[11:52] well that's 51. praise god 51. so he had
[11:56] already been preaching i started his
[11:57] revival in 46 as worldwide revival in 46
[11:59] so he already had five years in he said
[12:01] sometimes i don't even feel like i'm
[12:03] saved
[12:07] he says he's just a human being and if
[12:09] god now listen listen this here's what i
[12:11] want you to get this why am i starting
[12:12] with this if god ever lifted his hands
[12:15] he would fall
[12:17] that's all
[12:19] so let me say like this in your soul you
[12:21] are sealed to the day of redemption and
[12:23] the church said
[12:24] in your soul you don't sin and the
[12:25] church said
[12:28] but god has his hand over your mind
[12:31] and your body as a hedge and he can
[12:34] remove that hedge if he wants
[12:37] so never remove the seal because it's
[12:39] sealed to the day of your redemption but
[12:41] if he chooses he could remove that hedge
[12:44] from your body right because satan could
[12:46] put a disease on your body
[12:48] if god removes the hedge or he could
[12:50] remove that hedge around your mind where
[12:52] you don't have the sound mind you once
[12:53] had
[12:55] take that back to the scripture god left
[12:57] hezekiah for a season to test him after
[12:59] he got his 15 years of extra life god
[13:02] left the anointing on his mind god took
[13:04] that hedge around and now he he got all
[13:06] prideful he said yeah you babylonian
[13:08] guys can come in you can check out the
[13:10] house of god little did he know they'd
[13:12] go back and they'd make a plan to come
[13:14] and steal all the things from the house
[13:16] of god
[13:18] a huge mistake major mistake
[13:20] where god said it would have been better
[13:22] for you to die
[13:26] so brother madam says if god ever lift
[13:28] his hands you would fall that's all
[13:33] so how did you get here today god's hand
[13:35] was on you amen hallelujah praise god
[13:38] amen
[13:39] you didn't get here by your power you
[13:41] got here by god's power amen
[13:47] brother man said i've heard people say
[13:49] oh satan can't do that
[13:52] in other words satan can't get to them
[13:54] brother brahm said yes
[13:57] you just let god lift his hand one time
[14:00] and watch what happens i was listening
[14:01] to this in the car yesterday i'm like
[14:02] what
[14:04] oh my goodness
[14:06] you just let god lift his hand one time
[14:08] and watch what happens
[14:10] he says i constantly plead
[14:14] god
[14:15] don't send him speaking of satan
[14:19] keep mercy on me
[14:21] keep satan away from me you see i need
[14:24] god's mercy and we all need that
[14:30] a prophet's constant prayer yet he saw
[14:33] visions all the time but like that brown
[14:35] bear vision video showed he can you can
[14:37] disobey visions
[14:38] still be a child of god
[14:42] and i got a good testimony a family said
[14:43] thank you so much for this video we love
[14:45] the message but we had so many doubts
[14:47] they said now that you made this video
[14:48] our family you've dissolved all of our
[14:50] doubts
[14:52] hallelujah
[14:53] we're strengthening souls one at a time
[14:55] amen
[14:56] hallelujah thank you jesus
[15:01] but brother adam says here that if god
[15:03] doesn't protect him he would fall
[15:06] and he was constantly praying so in and
[15:08] out of visions in and out of praying for
[15:10] sick and then in in that in between time
[15:12] who is he praying for himself
[15:15] church it's okay to pray for yourself i
[15:16] know you're not supposed to pray for
[15:17] yourself more than other people but
[15:19] when you do pray for yourself
[15:22] amen when you do pray for yourself say
[15:24] god
[15:25] please keep your hand of mercy on me
[15:28] please don't remove the hedge about my
[15:31] body and my mind amen
[15:35] because if he ever did you'd surely fall
[15:37] i'd surely fall no doubt about it amen
[15:40] if god didn't protect us and keep us
[15:43] we'd fall
[15:46] and personally i think we'd most easily
[15:47] fall into pride because the other two
[15:49] are so obvious the lust of the eyes and
[15:52] the pride of life i'm sorry yeah i'm
[15:54] sorry lust of the eyes lust of the flesh
[15:56] right
[16:02] so that's a quote i need to
[16:04] bookmark that one and i need to
[16:06] make a reminder revisit that quote again
[16:08] re when i'm struggling i need to see
[16:09] that go i need to hang that quote up on
[16:11] my wall
[16:12] we need to constantly bleed
[16:15] that god does not take his hand away
[16:18] from us and god have mercy on me
[16:23] hallelujah
[16:25] now what's a modern definition of pride
[16:27] as we move on
[16:29] it is
[16:31] consciousness of one's own dignity or
[16:33] honor so in other words you're aware of
[16:36] how dignified you are or how honorable
[16:38] you are
[16:41] it's also the quality of having an
[16:43] excessively high opinion of oneself
[16:46] or one's importance
[16:50] well in my opinion i'm pretty great
[16:54] in my opinion i'm very important
[16:58] goodness gracious
[16:59] help us jesus amen
[17:02] in my opinion i deserve a lot of honor
[17:06] in my opinion i'm a very dignified
[17:09] person
[17:10] i'm a very respectful person
[17:14] that's the new oxford
[17:16] dictionary
[17:17] definition of pride
[17:19] so see as we just maybe preach a few
[17:20] sermons on this we'll see lord willing
[17:24] we need to have the right opinion of
[17:26] ourselves but it cannot be uh
[17:29] an excessively high opinion of ourselves
[17:33] so you want to have the opinion i am
[17:35] more than a conqueror but you got to you
[17:36] got to have this a part of your opinion
[17:38] as long as i humble myself and obey
[17:40] god's word amen amen hallelujah
[17:44] i am more than a conqueror as long as i
[17:47] pray before i make major decisions amen
[17:51] as long as i read my bible i'm praying
[17:53] as long as i seek the kingdom of god
[17:55] first amen then i'm more than a
[17:57] conqueror hallelujah then i'm an adopted
[17:59] child of god
[18:00] hallelujah
[18:03] see
[18:04] so we don't want pride
[18:07] excessively high opinion of ourselves
[18:10] to creep into our lives we don't want to
[18:11] think we're more important than we
[18:14] really are
[18:15] like we're joking out there about you
[18:16] know your job if you don't show up if
[18:19] you die they're going to replace you the
[18:21] next day
[18:22] they might have a moment of silence
[18:23] let's have a moment of silence for mr
[18:24] smith
[18:25] all right back to work guys you know
[18:27] let's go
[18:28] i don't even know if they do that
[18:32] but you know that's brother madam calls
[18:34] it dog eat dog
[18:36] that's the way in the world right
[18:43] and that's why we can never let
[18:46] things of the world become more
[18:47] important than the things of god that's
[18:49] why we must always put the things of god
[18:51] first in our lives
[18:53] and above everything else i'm just
[18:56] remember reminding of uh reminding of a
[18:58] family that used to come here that fell
[18:59] away from the message
[19:01] uh and i'm not bad mouthing them but i'm
[19:02] just saying they ne god was never first
[19:04] in their life
[19:06] whenever a family would come they'd skip
[19:08] church
[19:09] right or live stream but you know if
[19:11] you're live streaming at home you've got
[19:12] family visiting are you really paying
[19:13] attention to the sermon
[19:15] are you really amending it like you
[19:16] should and singing along like you should
[19:18] it's not the same as being with the
[19:19] saints
[19:23] and just you know
[19:25] without god being number one
[19:28] that shows the the pride of life had
[19:30] entered in family is more important i'm
[19:33] taking my family above the church above
[19:35] the word of god
[19:38] pride
[19:42] in other words just like eli in other
[19:44] words i'm giving my family more honor
[19:47] than jesus christ and the church
[19:50] that's what eli did so because eli did
[19:52] that his office was removed from his
[19:55] his uh offspring
[19:57] right
[19:59] he honored his sons more than god well
[20:01] just like any family can do today they
[20:03] can honor friends or family or money or
[20:05] riches or pride or whatever they can
[20:07] magnify that they can honor that above
[20:10] god
[20:12] and the bible said pride always goes
[20:15] before what the fall
[20:18] that's what we want to avoid by god's
[20:20] grace
[20:22] a fall
[20:25] may our falls be very small
[20:28] i want small falls
[20:33] i want i can i say like this i want
[20:34] private falls
[20:36] where i don't fall publicly and it
[20:38] brings a disgrace upon the name of jesus
[20:40] christ
[20:42] now before i forget remember on
[20:43] wednesday or last sunday no last friday
[20:46] i was preaching
[20:48] and i was talking about how um i'm just
[20:50] going to add this in here so i don't
[20:52] forget
[20:53] remember brother i was talking about
[20:54] brother ramsey's death by a car accident
[20:56] right
[20:58] and the thought that i like behind now
[21:00] this is totally unrelated but the
[21:01] thought behind that
[21:03] uh that i like from the brother i went
[21:04] and listened to it again this week to
[21:06] follow up with with my church because i
[21:07] love you so much
[21:08] i want to keep my word to you
[21:11] but the thought was
[21:13] um just because brother ram died in a
[21:15] car accident doesn't mean he was a false
[21:16] prophet he said if that and here's the
[21:18] thought if that was the case what about
[21:20] all these false prophets
[21:22] he said the hospitals will be full with
[21:24] all these false prophets that are on the
[21:25] internet right now and the church said
[21:29] and yet these false prophets get to live
[21:30] to their 70 80 have their own private
[21:33] planes
[21:36] natural blessings are no sign of god's
[21:38] approval on your life amen
[21:42] now it might be if you're humble and
[21:43] you're private but i'm talking about in
[21:45] general
[21:46] a natural blessing not is not
[21:48] necessarily proof that you're right with
[21:50] god
[21:51] because if anybody was right with god it
[21:53] was that humble prophet praise god
[21:55] who turned down riches and and
[21:57] cadillac's and all these things he
[21:59] turned that down and he he left his
[22:00] family he forsook the family and he left
[22:02] jeffersonville to go out uh
[22:05] and go to arizona and receive the
[22:06] revelation and he just forsook
[22:09] everything for the ministry if anybody
[22:11] deserved to live it was him
[22:15] but now these present-day prophets they
[22:16] can they've already uh
[22:18] they've already lied so many times it's
[22:20] just it's coming out there's just
[22:21] there's total there's complete youtube
[22:23] pages by atheists that are dedicated to
[22:26] mocking these christian false prophets
[22:29] and they have hundreds of thousands of
[22:30] views
[22:31] it becomes a sport to them because
[22:33] they're so obviously false
[22:36] so just the way someone dies doesn't
[22:38] mean that they were a false if it's a
[22:41] it's a tragic death it doesn't mean they
[22:43] were a false prophet
[22:45] so that's what i want to share with you
[22:47] last friday it slipped my mind forgive
[22:49] me
[22:50] so i got that off my checklist okay all
[22:52] right
[22:54] so church we don't want to excessively
[22:57] high opinion of ourselves
[23:00] and really as our brother
[23:02] dennis preach which is my life scripture
[23:04] john 15 5
[23:06] jesus said apart from me you can do
[23:09] nothing
[23:11] so let's have the right opinion i'm
[23:13] nothing let's all say that ready i'm
[23:15] nothing that's that's the best opinion
[23:17] i'm nothing
[23:18] if any good comes out of my humble
[23:20] little insignificant tiny little life
[23:23] then it was jesus that did it and i
[23:25] finally got on the way so he could do
[23:26] something with me praise god
[23:28] then he gets the glory then i'm going to
[23:30] surely throw the crown at his feet not
[23:32] my feet amen
[23:35] in other words i don't have this crown
[23:36] unless you overcame
[23:38] you conquered for me praise god
[23:43] now the bible uh or lexicon greek
[23:46] definition of pride is self-confidence
[23:52] oh my another definition is boasting
[23:54] which means
[23:56] self-satisfied talk
[23:58] about one's achievements or compliments
[24:00] look what i've done boy
[24:02] i am so satisfied with what i've done i
[24:04] have i have really done something
[24:08] i have really achieved
[24:10] it's you're so satisfied with yourself
[24:14] i have arrived
[24:17] i have made it
[24:19] that self-confidence now we see in
[24:21] peter's life right on the night of jesus
[24:23] erection or
[24:24] arrest rather
[24:26] jesus said you're all going to deny me
[24:27] tonight and peter said i will not
[24:31] i'll die with you
[24:32] i'll die for you
[24:34] i'll not deny you he said before the
[24:35] crack crows you'll deny me three
[24:38] times
[24:39] and he said where's a sword give me a
[24:40] sword
[24:44] self-confidence
[24:49] now the beautiful part church the
[24:51] beautiful part is that even jo even
[24:52] though jesus told him that when they
[24:54] went to the garden jesus said here's
[24:56] your escape amen here's your way out of
[24:58] temptation amen he said pray that you
[25:01] enter not into temptation praise god
[25:04] ah
[25:06] he told him he told him he told him his
[25:07] face he was wrong and then they went
[25:09] glory they went to a prayer meeting amen
[25:11] hallelujah that's what we need a prayer
[25:14] meeting amen
[25:16] our own individual prayer meeting
[25:17] hallelujah we have a prayer meeting
[25:19] before every service if you want to come
[25:21] or you can pray after church it don't
[25:22] matter just pray amen
[25:24] this is a house of prayer hallelujah
[25:28] but look how gracious jesus is he warns
[25:30] him and he says now here pray up so you
[25:33] don't fall here's your chance
[25:35] but he got tired he said
[25:38] i could really use a nap right now
[25:41] self-confidence
[25:43] look at that bragging i will i won't
[25:45] deny you i'll die for you i'll die for
[25:47] it but when it come to time he was too
[25:49] tired to back up his words
[25:52] help us to only say
[25:55] what we know god has called us to do and
[25:57] then say
[25:58] if the lord is willing
[26:01] praise god hallelujah
[26:03] help us to only say
[26:05] what we know is right and then say i'll
[26:07] do it if the lord is willing
[26:10] if god's willing like remember james
[26:12] says the bible doesn't say or james says
[26:16] don't say well i'm going to move next
[26:18] year year go to that place make some
[26:20] money and then come back the bible says
[26:22] don't boast about tomorrow say if the
[26:24] lord is willing i'll move there and make
[26:26] some money
[26:27] and then come back
[26:28] if god is willing because church how
[26:30] many know god has a different plan for
[26:32] your life than maybe what you have
[26:37] now in my life personally i've you know
[26:38] i've seen my life stay very stable since
[26:41] i moved to akron you know nothing out of
[26:42] the ordinary
[26:44] but church i can't be complacent
[26:47] i can't be prideful and think well i'm
[26:49] never going to move i'll always be right
[26:51] here i always you know i want to always
[26:53] be a faithful servant i always will by
[26:55] god's grace
[26:57] but i i can't be so i can't be so secure
[27:00] in my human mind
[27:02] that i'm not open to the leadership of
[27:04] the holy spirit
[27:10] i can't have self-confidence i've got to
[27:11] have confidence in christ
[27:14] confidence in christ
[27:18] another word is like braggadocious they
[27:20] say you know
[27:22] boasting
[27:23] here look let me tell you what i've done
[27:24] let me tell you what i'm gonna do
[27:26] let me tell you what i have done
[27:29] bragging
[27:30] now let's look at the first
[27:32] man
[27:34] spiritual man who fell lucifer isaiah 14
[27:36] let's go there isaiah 14.
[27:41] isaiah 14 verse 12. i'm sorry i don't
[27:43] have slides you know it's just been a
[27:45] busy week been a but it's been a good
[27:46] week a good week of recovery but it's
[27:48] just been a busy week here
[27:54] isaiah 14 12.
[28:01] i just caught a good thought in here you
[28:02] know i think when brother dennis or
[28:04] brother simon or i can't remember his
[28:05] brother brian one of those preachers
[28:07] they were preaching and they talked
[28:08] about
[28:09] satan weakening the nations i thought ah
[28:11] that's a good thought
[28:13] isaiah 14 12
[28:15] how art thou thou fallen from heaven o
[28:18] lucifer son of the morning
[28:21] how art thou cut down to the ground
[28:24] which did weaken the nations
[28:27] for thou has set in thine heart i will
[28:30] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[28:32] throne above the stars of god i will sit
[28:34] also upon the mount of the congregation
[28:36] in the sides of the north
[28:39] i will send above the heights of the
[28:40] clouds i will be like the most high
[28:43] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[28:45] to the sides of the pit and the church
[28:47] said
[28:48] thank god hallelujah
[28:51] verse 16 they that see thee shall
[28:54] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[28:56] thee saying is this the man that's why i
[28:58] said man
[28:59] spiritual man right because angels are
[29:01] all men is this the man that made the
[29:03] earth to tremble
[29:05] that did shake the kingdoms that made
[29:06] the world as a wilderness and destroyed
[29:08] the cities thereof that opened not the
[29:10] house of his prisoners
[29:12] so all those ukrainian cities that are
[29:14] being destroyed who's doing it satan's
[29:15] doing that
[29:17] he destroys the cities he weakens the
[29:18] nations
[29:20] he makes the wilderness
[29:25] now i just want you to uh
[29:27] consider this i was thinking about this
[29:30] pride was the first thing that entered
[29:32] into satan's heart now the other
[29:33] scripture says he was lifted up because
[29:35] of his beauty and his wisdom and i think
[29:37] it's ezekiel 28.
[29:40] the church i don't know let's just
[29:42] rehearse some of these moments here
[29:44] before there was anything there was just
[29:45] god
[29:46] and then god said
[29:48] let there be light
[29:50] and brother man said it could have been
[29:52] millions millions billions of years then
[29:53] the pillar of fire came out
[29:56] a picture of fire there
[30:00] and then from that pillar of fire
[30:02] god spoke creation because the bible
[30:04] said god created all things by jesus
[30:06] christ who is the word amen
[30:08] so the pillar of fire started speaking
[30:10] the logos
[30:13] speaking all creation
[30:15] and then
[30:17] before the earth
[30:19] that light spoke angels
[30:22] innumerable number of angels
[30:25] all these angels and all the angels
[30:27] would have turned and seen the light
[30:28] there's god
[30:30] by that time maybe he had his seventh
[30:31] dimension set up you know
[30:35] and then god said now look down here
[30:36] look out here in the universe i'm going
[30:38] to set up the earth
[30:42] and god spoke the word
[30:44] and all of a sudden uh brother branham
[30:45] said that he said the earth came out of
[30:47] another ball of fire and i can't explain
[30:49] all that another burning star or
[30:51] something like that he said look it was
[30:53] a clinker out of another one so i don't
[30:55] know
[30:56] he spoke it he said that little clinker
[30:58] was burning he said but then it cooled
[30:59] off
[31:00] and all the angels even satan is
[31:02] watching that earth fly out there and
[31:05] then all of a sudden god said stop
[31:09] and the earth stopped
[31:12] and then when it stopped god founded the
[31:15] earth and set it right there
[31:19] and god said this is going to be my
[31:20] crowning planet and they're probably
[31:22] confused like look at all these huge
[31:23] planets and these huge stars this is
[31:25] your crowning achievement
[31:27] remember it was in darkness
[31:30] the earth was without form and what void
[31:33] it was just as dark
[31:35] and god said look angels this is my
[31:38] crowning achievement
[31:40] it was there was no green on it there
[31:42] was no plants it wasn't beautiful it's
[31:44] just
[31:44] water but yet the bible said all the
[31:48] sons of god amen all the angels
[31:51] the bible said they shouted for joy
[31:54] they said hallelujah praise god amen
[31:57] this dif all the all the other plants
[31:58] were different this one had water
[32:02] yet it was without former void and
[32:04] lucifer was right there he was shouting
[32:05] and praising god oh my look at this
[32:09] special it's it's it's the home
[32:11] it's the home of god's children
[32:15] and the bible said they all shouted for
[32:16] joy now church don't be deceived that
[32:18] wasn't you shouting for joy
[32:20] because brother branham said you
[32:21] bypassed your theophany and went from
[32:23] thought to flesh body and the church
[32:25] said
[32:27] you'd be surprised how many people think
[32:28] those sons of god shouting were
[32:30] christians they weren't
[32:32] you were in the thoughts of god you were
[32:34] not manifested yet
[32:37] those were angels and lucifer was
[32:39] shouting right there
[32:41] glory
[32:42] look at that
[32:48] they were worshiping singing
[32:50] lucifer was right there next to god
[32:54] and some sometime during a worship
[32:55] service he had all these pipes and
[32:57] tablets he was such a musician
[32:59] at one point he thought
[33:03] i
[33:04] am very wise
[33:05] i am so beautiful
[33:08] i've seen god now he's been he's this
[33:10] pillar of fire this with this
[33:11] theophanies been on the throne all these
[33:14] millions and maybe hundreds of thousands
[33:16] of years man we we talk about that all
[33:19] the time in our house
[33:23] but at some point he thought
[33:25] i deserve this worship
[33:28] now how did he get to the spot where he
[33:30] was shouting and rejoicing
[33:32] about earth being created and now
[33:34] thinking he could make himself a throne
[33:38] just like god's
[33:40] the bible said because of pride
[33:44] he had a he realized wow look at me i'm
[33:46] actually much more beautiful than these
[33:48] other angels
[33:51] look at me
[33:52] i'm much more talented
[33:56] and i will ascend above the th of the
[33:59] above above the stars of the of the sky
[34:02] i will ascend i can be greater god made
[34:05] me like this but i could be greater than
[34:06] this
[34:09] now look how church look at that thought
[34:11] look how humble god was
[34:14] he made all this creation but yet he
[34:16] humbled himself so much he must have
[34:17] been so humble that even the even
[34:20] lucifer looked at him and said well i
[34:21] can be just like him i can do that
[34:23] now member church he had a lot of power
[34:26] the bible said he can transform himself
[34:30] didn't he take jesus the bible said he
[34:31] took jesus on a pinnacle in jerusalem
[34:33] then the bible said he took him up into
[34:35] a high holy mountain how does he do that
[34:36] he's got powers
[34:41] so he's able to transform himself he has
[34:44] all these powers he can control nature
[34:47] right you can only can influence the
[34:48] nature when god allows it
[34:51] we saw him here he could make deserts
[34:54] now the thing what i want to get to you
[34:56] and i for you and i is that the thing
[34:58] he's trying to do to you is to weaken
[35:00] you
[35:01] the bible said he weakened the nations
[35:03] but i want to tell you and i the thing
[35:05] he's trying to do is make us less strong
[35:07] than what we currently are praise god
[35:10] amen that's the thought that i got from
[35:13] i felt it maybe mcbride or i can't
[35:14] remember who it was maybe simon
[35:20] so consider consider your strength what
[35:22] is your spiritual strength today what do
[35:24] you think about what are you overcoming
[35:26] today or what have you overcome this
[35:27] week now satan's looking at that and
[35:30] through his his many servants
[35:32] his wicked demon servants he's trying to
[35:35] say how can i weaken brother vang this
[35:37] week how can i weaken brother jess's
[35:40] weak that's what he's trying to do he's
[35:41] not he's not going to be able to throw
[35:42] you away from the faith and the church
[35:44] said
[35:45] he won't be able to totally deceive you
[35:47] but he's going to try to weaken you
[35:50] so your faith is not as strong as it
[35:52] should be
[35:57] he weakens the nations and what he does
[35:59] he weakens churches
[36:02] remember brother i'm warned bradham
[36:03] tabernacle you're going to be weaker he
[36:05] said you're going to oh yeah he said
[36:06] brother he said random tabernacle you're
[36:08] going to lose your strength and he said
[36:09] how did it happen through gossip
[36:12] talking about other people
[36:14] see church if we got a problem let's go
[36:15] talk to somebody ourselves
[36:17] you can talk to me i like to counsel too
[36:19] i'll do that
[36:21] but there's an individual if there's an
[36:22] individual need you know
[36:25] and we need a counselor you got to go to
[36:26] that person or let's have a group
[36:28] meeting by god's grace
[36:31] because gossip and pride pride
[36:33] ultimately it weakens a church
[36:37] weakens us
[36:38] or we don't have as much joy anymore
[36:40] don't even we're not as zealous for the
[36:42] word as we should be
[36:45] he knows he's not going to get you to go
[36:47] steal or go kill or commit adultery he
[36:49] knows but he's trying to weaken you so
[36:51] he can get you to fall in some other way
[36:54] that will be a disgrace upon
[36:56] christianity or your family
[37:00] but here we see
[37:02] lucifer's pride
[37:04] i mean this is all this is the awful
[37:06] state of pride how could you ever think
[37:07] you could be like god how could you ever
[37:09] think you could have a throne and defeat
[37:12] the all the other angels of god
[37:18] now this ought to encourage us church if
[37:19] we're here today god's protected us to
[37:21] be here
[37:22] and if we've overcome sin this week then
[37:24] we're strong in the lord
[37:26] and the power of his mind hallelujah
[37:28] we're putting on the armor of god
[37:29] through humility through prayer
[37:32] by pleading with god saying don't take
[37:33] your hand away from me hallelujah amen
[37:37] but satan's goal today is to weaken you
[37:40] listen to less sermons
[37:43] read your bible less
[37:46] testify remember that good testimony had
[37:47] about testified
[37:49] testify less
[37:50] no but we should testify the same
[37:53] keep jesus on our lips keep jesus on our
[37:56] mind at all times
[38:00] lucifer thought he could be like the
[38:02] most high
[38:04] so church this makes me wonder how often
[38:06] do they see god create things because
[38:08] that what power separates lucifer from
[38:11] god lucifer is not a creator but god is
[38:13] a creator
[38:15] so i wonder if god hid a lot of the
[38:16] creation from the angels
[38:19] i wonder if everything was already there
[38:20] brother hosea he already had the stars
[38:22] all out there then the angels come in
[38:24] and then maybe one of the last things we
[38:25] placed was right there the foundation of
[38:27] the earth
[38:28] he told the angels this is going to be
[38:30] my crowning achievement right here
[38:33] my whole plan for this whole universe my
[38:37] whole plan is focus right there on that
[38:39] little that little watery
[38:42] dark
[38:44] planet that's tiny little planet
[38:46] comparative you've seen you've seen
[38:47] you've seen the comparisons earth is
[38:48] tidy
[38:51] that's where we find god god puts
[38:53] himself in little things amen
[38:55] hallelujah god's interest in the details
[38:58] hallelujah
[39:00] so we see lucifer's pride
[39:05] now let's learn from that church
[39:08] let's learn not to say i will i will i
[39:10] will six times
[39:12] let's learn to say thy will thy will thy
[39:14] will be done
[39:16] because that's the first step out of the
[39:18] plan of god is saying i will do this i
[39:21] will do that
[39:24] i don't need i don't need to pray about
[39:25] this i don't need to consider that
[39:30] overcoming pride how many overcoming
[39:32] pride by god's grace amen
[39:35] now let's go to genesis 3 verse 1. now
[39:36] let's look after satan
[39:39] falls himself
[39:42] then he goes to eve
[39:44] and i got a good thought from a youtube
[39:45] preacher i wasn't actually listening to
[39:46] a baptist preacher
[39:48] he was doing a uh
[39:50] he was doing a documentary on like music
[39:52] you know i was like well i'm interested
[39:54] and we just talked about that we don't
[39:55] want to do we always avoid rock and roll
[39:57] but i was listening to a music
[39:59] documentary and he brought this
[40:01] beautiful thought out about eve's
[40:03] deception and satan's tactics in the
[40:05] garden just a i maybe you heard it
[40:07] before i never heard it before and if i
[40:09] did i forgot
[40:10] genesis 3 1
[40:14] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[40:16] beast of the field which the lord god
[40:18] hath made and he said in the woman yea
[40:20] hath god said ye shall not eat of the
[40:22] tree of the garden and the woman said
[40:24] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[40:26] of the trees of the garden by the fruit
[40:28] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[40:29] garden god has said ye shall not eat of
[40:32] it neither shall you touch it lest ye
[40:34] die and the serpent said unto the woman
[40:36] ye shall not surely die
[40:38] for god doth know that in the day ye eat
[40:41] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[40:43] ye shall be as gods knowing good and
[40:45] evil and when the woman saw that the
[40:47] tree was good for food and that it was
[40:49] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[40:52] desired to make one wise she took of the
[40:54] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[40:57] under her husband with her and he did
[40:59] eat of course the eating is a spiritual
[41:01] symbolism here
[41:03] good for food that was a spiritual
[41:05] aspect
[41:07] right because the bible says
[41:09] i don't know if we've done that study
[41:10] with austin lena have we done the
[41:11] serpentine study with you too
[41:13] not since you've been back i don't think
[41:15] have we
[41:16] well keep your place there and go to
[41:17] proverbs 30 verse 20.
[41:18] that scripture is kind of like
[41:20] etched on my mind
[41:22] it's a good thing too proverbs 30 verse
[41:24] 20.
[41:28] so eating here is not natural that's
[41:30] what denominations see you know and you
[41:32] know god bless their hearts those that
[41:33] are faithful there's a few saved in
[41:35] there
[41:37] and all those all those that want to see
[41:38] it we'll see it probably 30 verse 20.
[41:42] but i also want to read that for us
[41:43] brother proverbs 30 verse 20.
[42:00] amen thank you so see
[42:02] eating is like it unto
[42:05] fornication or in this case adultery
[42:08] right so this was we'd say adultery
[42:10] because eve was already promised and
[42:12] espoused to adam and then the satan
[42:14] anointed the serpent to commit this act
[42:17] with eve and it was adultery
[42:19] so it was a symbolized as eating and i
[42:22] preached i appreciate a few months ago i
[42:24] preached a few months ago how uh
[42:27] idolatry is spiritual intercourse
[42:30] idolatry so worshiping idol is actually
[42:32] spiritually making love to an idol evil
[42:34] spirit
[42:36] so i don't expect to remember that but i
[42:37] remember that
[42:41] so she eats it was good to be eaten
[42:43] which means it was a sexual thing
[42:45] there's a sexual relationship
[42:47] now i want you to notice here's the
[42:48] thought that the brother brought out i
[42:49] thought was really good satan's first
[42:51] tactic was to diminish the vision of god
[42:55] downplay god's vision and that was in
[42:57] verse 1. because he said yea hath god
[43:00] said you shall not eat the tree of the
[43:02] garden so god's vision was never eat the
[43:04] tree of the garden
[43:06] so his first thing is to diminish the
[43:08] vision are you sure that's god that's
[43:09] what god wants for your life for us it
[43:12] might be are you sure god wants you to
[43:15] be humble like that and just little
[43:17] little known and a nobody are you sure
[43:19] god wants you to be nobody for the rest
[43:20] of your life
[43:21] shouldn't you be somebody
[43:24] could you be somebody famous or popular
[43:26] or money or something like that should
[43:28] you be somebody great now god does have
[43:29] some of those
[43:31] right god does have some of the job is
[43:32] the richest man in the world at that
[43:33] time david and solomon were the richest
[43:35] men in the world at that time
[43:38] now we know what it did to some of them
[43:39] right we know it
[43:41] caused david and solomon to fall
[43:44] but god can have great ones among us
[43:46] but the bible said there's few of them
[43:48] most of us might like scotland remember
[43:49] that scripture simon brought out not
[43:51] many are noble
[43:52] right not many are great
[43:54] there's not many like that there could
[43:55] be a few like that but most of god's
[43:57] children are poor people or little
[44:00] people the bible said they're poor in
[44:02] this world but they're rich in faith
[44:03] hallelujah thank god amen god's faith
[44:06] has anchored in your heart that you
[44:08] trust in god more than riches hallelujah
[44:11] so satan's first thing is i'm going to
[44:13] diminish the vision of god well maybe my
[44:15] life doesn't have to be all this
[44:16] holiness all the time maybe i could get
[44:19] a tv
[44:22] just that's a simple example
[44:24] well maybe i could you know drink a
[44:25] little bit at home even when my stomach
[44:27] doesn't hurt
[44:29] yeah you're going the wrong way yeah
[44:31] i'll tell you
[44:33] see how brother like brother said see
[44:35] how far you can get away from sin don't
[44:36] see how close you can get to sin see how
[44:38] far you can get away from it
[44:40] so that's verse one this first thing is
[44:42] diminish the vision of god
[44:46] the second thing is he dismisses the
[44:49] vengeance of god in verse 4 because he
[44:52] says
[44:53] you shall not surely die
[44:56] now we've got to balance this out
[44:57] because
[44:58] god has grace many times
[45:01] but this is the first time sin has ever
[45:04] manifested itself on earth
[45:06] so he
[45:07] he diminishes the vision of god well god
[45:09] don't want it to be like that all the
[45:11] time and then you won't surely die i
[45:13] mean surely god's not going to be mad i
[45:14] mean
[45:15] you sin all the time now that's how it'd
[45:17] be for us what you said all the time
[45:18] it's okay for you to do this sin on
[45:20] purpose
[45:22] it's different it's different when we
[45:23] know it it's different when we don't
[45:25] know what the sin is and that's
[45:26] different when we do know what the sin
[45:27] is
[45:29] when we do know it there's a greater
[45:30] consequence a greater punishment
[45:33] or as the bible says if you don't like
[45:34] the word punishment to me it's a fine
[45:36] word but if you don't like that word
[45:37] it's chastisement
[45:39] hebrews chapter 12. god chastens every
[45:42] son that he loves
[45:46] see that's what satan's going to try to
[45:47] battle us on he's going to first say
[45:49] well you know i mean
[45:51] message people can do this i mean
[45:52] message people don't have to live like
[45:53] this forever brother amen you have to do
[45:55] that forever i mean just just when you
[45:57] first get saved you
[45:58] know no no he's diminishing the vision
[46:01] of god
[46:02] i'm growing in grace amen i'm going from
[46:05] glory to glory amen
[46:07] we're going from faith to faith the
[46:09] light of god shineth more unto a perfect
[46:12] day then he says well god's not gonna
[46:16] he's not you're not gonna die
[46:19] god's not gonna punish you
[46:22] he takes that away
[46:24] the third thing is he distorts the voice
[46:27] of god or he twists the voice of god
[46:30] for god knows god knows this
[46:34] god knows in the day he eat thereof your
[46:36] eyes will be opened and you should be as
[46:38] gods knowing good and evil he twists
[46:40] that
[46:41] says well you will be god's the fact was
[46:43] they already were gods
[46:45] they already were adam already was a a
[46:48] little g god
[46:50] he already he already had dominion over
[46:52] the whole earth and satan's telling his
[46:53] wife well you're not even there yet
[46:56] there's a greater place you could be
[46:57] there's a greater thing you could ascend
[46:59] to
[47:01] and god's vengeance he's not going to be
[47:02] met you're not going to die
[47:05] and you don't have to live like this
[47:07] forever
[47:09] but what is our prayer my prayer is god
[47:11] keep your heads about me forever amen
[47:14] keep a hedge on my mind keep a hedge on
[47:16] my body protect me hallelujah that's why
[47:19] the bible said pray that you enter not
[47:20] in temptation amen
[47:23] pray god keep me from evil
[47:25] hallelujah
[47:31] that's the third thing he does he
[47:32] distorts the voice of god well see god
[47:34] knows this is going to happen that's
[47:36] going to happen and god you know you're
[47:37] actually god was actually keeping you
[47:39] from something that some pleasure that
[47:40] you actually like
[47:43] and then the fourth thing he does he
[47:46] uh he causes eve to be
[47:48] deciding to be void of god
[47:51] so she leaves the plan of god she
[47:53] doesn't need god you can be a god so see
[47:56] he convinces her you can be void of god
[47:59] you'll be like god
[48:00] and you won't need to be you then you
[48:02] won't need god
[48:05] but see our attitude's different we just
[48:06] want to follow jesus we want to we when
[48:08] we get to heaven we will we want to be
[48:10] one place with jesus praise god
[48:12] hallelujah
[48:14] the bible said that they'll follow him
[48:15] wherever he goes amen they'll never lead
[48:18] aside his wife will serve him in the
[48:20] temple praise god
[48:22] amen
[48:24] so he diminishes the vision
[48:26] you don't have to always live like that
[48:29] then he says dismissed is the vengeance
[48:31] god's not going to punish you
[48:33] and then he twists the voice
[48:35] well god knows it's actually like this
[48:38] and then he gets them to decide to be
[48:40] void of god
[48:42] they don't need god
[48:44] and you can choose the sin and do the
[48:46] sin
[48:50] but we see jesus doing the opposite amen
[48:52] hallelujah even though even adam fell
[48:55] jesus stands there says no satan i will
[48:57] not bow down i will not change this
[48:59] bread into rock amen because i don't
[49:01] live by every word i
[49:03] don't live by bread i live by every word
[49:05] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[49:08] see satan's trying to give evil live by
[49:10] this word this is a different word than
[49:11] god's word
[49:13] but jesus had the victory over that i
[49:15] will only live by the word of god
[49:19] remember church the bible says take heed
[49:22] lest you fall
[49:25] that's why these services like this now
[49:27] look i love guest preachers but these
[49:28] services are just regular
[49:31] common services
[49:33] these are just as important as all the
[49:34] other ones
[49:36] because if you just if you just if you
[49:38] if you let satan convince you that this
[49:39] is just a regular service and you don't
[49:41] pray constantly for god to hold you amen
[49:44] i don't know if you don't plead with god
[49:46] protect me keep me strong if you don't
[49:48] do that if you let down on god that's
[49:49] where satan can weaken you
[49:52] that'll cause you to give in to the
[49:54] enemy
[49:55] and into a
[49:56] fall where you've fallen short of the
[49:59] glory of god
[50:02] i believe we've got some pretty strong
[50:03] soldiers here today by god's grace
[50:05] i believe we've got some faithful
[50:06] watchers today that are watching for the
[50:08] enemy and keeping them out by the grace
[50:10] of god
[50:11] hallelujah
[50:13] so see we see how satan fell now
[50:15] pride and eve's pride
[50:18] remember pride
[50:19] is just exalting your way above god's
[50:21] way it's well i've got self-confidence
[50:24] i can interpret like eve i can interpret
[50:26] the word i'll take satan's i'll take the
[50:28] serpent's interpretation of the word
[50:29] i'll take that above god's word
[50:34] she just took that and that was a
[50:35] prideful thing to do exalted that
[50:37] exalted his interpretation above god's
[50:39] interpretation of the word
[50:42] hallelujah let's put let's go uh i'm
[50:44] sorry let's go to first peter five
[50:46] please first peter five i'm gonna hit
[50:47] some general scriptures here for a
[50:48] moment
[50:51] first peter 5 verse 5.
[50:58] in church as i said you know this is
[51:01] pride is what i see in the message that
[51:02] has attacked the message most
[51:05] i'm not going to show that this morning
[51:06] but you know at some point i want to
[51:07] show all the videos on that i'm still
[51:08] actually combine compiling some
[51:14] first peter
[51:16] verse five
[51:20] and as i said on that wednesday night
[51:21] pro i'm sorry time is the great
[51:23] vindicator time will show who is right
[51:25] and who is wrong
[51:26] time will show who was prideful and who
[51:28] was humble
[51:31] it'll always show because the bible said
[51:33] uh wisdom is justified over children and
[51:36] i'll say this a tree is known by its
[51:38] fruit
[51:39] whether it's a corrupt fruit
[51:41] sinful prideful fruit or if it's genuine
[51:44] holy ghost humility fruit
[51:46] humble fruit
[51:49] first peter 5 verse 6.
[51:56] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[51:57] unto the elder yea all of you be subject
[52:00] one to another
[52:01] and be clothed with humility for god
[52:04] resists the proud
[52:08] and giveth grace to the humble
[52:11] now there's lots of things in here bless
[52:13] you brother
[52:14] the first thing is clothe you put
[52:16] humility on like your garment you put on
[52:18] today
[52:19] all right i had to put on my shirt
[52:21] get the tie going on there i had to put
[52:23] it on you have to do the same thing
[52:25] every day you got to put on a humble
[52:26] attitude
[52:28] church can i say this you got to put on
[52:29] an attitude of a servant every day when
[52:32] you walk in these doors may god help me
[52:33] all of us say we're walking here lord
[52:35] how can i serve the people here today
[52:38] i'm not coming here to be served i'm
[52:40] coming here to serve
[52:43] put it on just like you did your nice
[52:45] sunday best here today by god's grace
[52:52] god resists or god opposes god is
[52:55] against the proud full i'm sorry the
[52:57] prideful rather
[52:59] god is against the proud
[53:01] but he gives grace to the humble that
[53:02] means the pride will the prideful will
[53:04] not get a lot of grace from god
[53:07] god will oppose them oppose them oppose
[53:09] them
[53:10] they won't get the grace that the
[53:12] believers will get
[53:16] look at verse six
[53:18] who's going to humble you is the
[53:20] preacher going to humble you
[53:22] is the deacon going to humble you
[53:24] is your mom going to humble you
[53:27] how about your dad your dad gonna hump
[53:28] you
[53:29] no the bible says humble yourselves
[53:33] in other words this is a soul decision
[53:36] where is the will of god brother brahm
[53:37] says he said the will of god free more
[53:39] agency is in the soul
[53:41] this is a soul decision now what's
[53:43] interesting this i don't have this
[53:44] mystery figured out yet but
[53:46] if you're seeing with the holy ghost in
[53:47] your soul and you have three more ages
[53:49] in there
[53:50] how does the soul be sealed but then
[53:51] also make decisions
[53:53] to be
[53:54] prideful
[53:56] so i don't have that one figured out yet
[53:58] i don't
[54:00] i'm not sure about that
[54:03] but it's just something to keep in mind
[54:05] if free more agencies in the soul well
[54:07] how can you have a sealed soul but yet
[54:10] make that decision so i'll be waiting
[54:12] for my questions
[54:13] i'll be waiting for my questions for my
[54:14] little girls here this evening and so
[54:16] see if they can stump me on that one
[54:18] i'll just say i don't know
[54:20] i don't know
[54:22] but it's a mystery it's a great mystery
[54:24] god did a great
[54:25] a great amazing
[54:27] creation when he made our bodies and our
[54:28] minds
[54:29] humble yourselves church therefore under
[54:32] the mighty hand of god
[54:35] that he may exalt you in due time so can
[54:38] i say like this church it is true god
[54:40] wants to exalt you
[54:41] but it's not in your time it's in his
[54:43] time
[54:45] amen in other words god wants a city on
[54:47] a hill amen that's shining that
[54:49] everybody sees amen
[54:51] god wants a city on a hill he wants to
[54:54] exalt you but it's not in your time it's
[54:56] in god's time hallelujah
[54:58] you just got to be humble
[55:00] serve god obey the word and wait for
[55:02] it's your time where god's going to
[55:04] shine his light upon you
[55:06] remember that's a good example of joshua
[55:08] for all those years for 40 years he was
[55:10] waiting behind moses just yes yes moses
[55:12] yes sir yes sir okay i'll go fight that
[55:14] battle but all of a sudden moses died
[55:17] now god was going to exalt joshua
[55:20] praise god
[55:23] just wait church just wait in your place
[55:25] find your position brother brahma says
[55:27] find your position and just wait there
[55:29] do not leave your position
[55:32] brother brant said you're just as
[55:33] important as billy graham now he was a
[55:36] worldwide evangelist you're just as
[55:38] important as long as you stay in your
[55:40] position
[55:42] that's true
[55:45] that is true
[55:47] each part of the body is so important
[55:51] praise god
[55:54] you are just as important as me
[55:58] right
[56:00] you sisters you're just as important as
[56:02] the brothers
[56:04] hallelujah i thought i'd get a little
[56:06] more amen than that but that's okay
[56:07] maybe you're thinking about it real hard
[56:11] glory
[56:13] just as important
[56:16] because you're a soul that god made
[56:17] worth ten thousand worlds you're a soul
[56:19] that's very valuable in the sight of god
[56:22] he doesn't want to lose that soul he
[56:23] wants that soul
[56:25] to love him to serve him to worship him
[56:28] to do his will for their life praise god
[56:32] so
[56:34] we can't expect somebody else to hum us
[56:36] now maybe god will use somebody to
[56:37] correct us but ultimately you have to
[56:39] receive the correction
[56:41] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[56:43] god and god will exalt you in due season
[56:50] well what do i do with all my cares
[56:52] brother jesse verse seven what are you
[56:53] doing here here's what you do with all
[56:55] your cares
[56:56] well i've gotta i've gotta take care of
[56:57] this i've gotta i've gotta take care of
[56:59] that care care right casting all your
[57:01] care i gotta take care of this i gotta
[57:02] take well what about god is god ever
[57:04] gonna take care of anything for us
[57:06] absolutely
[57:10] there's a lot of cares we have but he
[57:12] said cast your cares upon the lord for
[57:16] he careth for you
[57:18] now look at verse eight be sober now
[57:21] don't be too silly right it's okay to
[57:22] laugh for a little bit but then we gotta
[57:23] get back to business amen
[57:26] it's okay laugh and joke
[57:28] feel human for a little while but then
[57:30] we got to get sober again
[57:32] be sober be vigilant
[57:35] alert because your adversary the devil
[57:37] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[57:40] whom he may devour and i got seven
[57:42] minutes left on my hour hard to believe
[57:43] that
[57:47] so satan is constantly roaming about and
[57:49] there come a time in season where he's
[57:51] going to use his demons to try to attack
[57:54] you and roar at you
[57:57] but you've got to be clothed with
[57:59] humility praise god
[58:01] you've got to be clothed with power amen
[58:04] so that when he roars you're not shaken
[58:06] by the roar
[58:08] when he roars that's when you pull your
[58:10] sword out praise god
[58:11] hallelujah
[58:13] because you know he roars but he don't
[58:14] have any teeth
[58:16] right
[58:17] brother said he lost his teeth at
[58:19] calvary amen hallelujah praise god
[58:24] and he's as aligned he's not a lion
[58:26] there's only one line that's jesus
[58:28] christ the lion of the tribe of judah
[58:30] amen
[58:31] he's the real lion
[58:33] so he's impersonator lion
[58:36] he's a fake line and yes he can roar
[58:39] that still doesn't take away your
[58:41] ability to put on humility to put on the
[58:43] armor of god and stand with the word of
[58:45] god in hand
[58:50] and not be prideful but be humble
[58:53] because god will oppose you if you're
[58:54] proud
[58:56] but he'll exalt you if you're humble
[59:00] one way god does this many times
[59:02] is in the marriage relationships so
[59:04] those of us who are married
[59:06] you see this often in scripture
[59:11] uh go to
[59:12] first peter 3 7. first peter 3 7.
[59:15] yeah we're already we're heard in
[59:16] chapter 4 let's go to the first period
[59:17] of three good
[59:21] so brothers here we go likewise your
[59:23] husbands dwell with them according to
[59:24] knowledge
[59:26] giving honor unto the wife
[59:30] as unto the weaker vessels so brothers
[59:32] have to acknowledge my wife's a weaker
[59:33] vessel
[59:34] but i've got to give them honor
[59:37] that's what i must do god's called me to
[59:39] be to give my wife honor and respect
[59:43] and as being heirs together of the grace
[59:45] of life so we're in this life together
[59:47] we're partners amen in other words
[59:49] you're a part of me i'm not complete
[59:51] without you
[59:55] that your prayers be not hindered
[59:58] so here's where god will oppose a man
[1:00:01] if he's mistreating his wife he won't
[1:00:04] listen to his prayers
[1:00:07] lord i need this money or i need this i
[1:00:08] need this uh lord
[1:00:10] heal this person help this person and
[1:00:12] god doesn't hear their prayers because
[1:00:14] he's not honoring his wife
[1:00:16] and of course the same can work for the
[1:00:18] sister too
[1:00:19] right
[1:00:20] but especially the man he has more
[1:00:21] responsibility he's called to be the
[1:00:22] leader
[1:00:24] the same is true in malachi 2 verse 14.
[1:00:27] we see the same thing in old testament
[1:00:29] new testament
[1:00:37] god is talking about all the sins
[1:00:40] that israel has done against him in this
[1:00:41] section of scripture
[1:00:45] where god in verse 13 god doesn't even
[1:00:47] regard their offerings anymore can you
[1:00:48] imagine church bringing all these
[1:00:50] animals to sacrifice and god doesn't
[1:00:51] receive any of it you just killed all
[1:00:53] those animals and god didn't even
[1:00:55] god didn't receive any of that
[1:00:58] think of the value of all that well the
[1:01:00] same is true today you can pour in all
[1:01:01] your ties and offerings but if your
[1:01:02] heart is not right with god god don't
[1:01:04] receive it
[1:01:05] right the pharisees tithe on their ties
[1:01:08] offerings on their cumin all their
[1:01:10] spices all their oils they do everything
[1:01:12] they tithe and offered offered on
[1:01:14] everything
[1:01:15] yeah jesus said you have your child i'm
[1:01:16] sorry you have your father the devil
[1:01:18] you're the children of hell
[1:01:23] and jesus said inwardly
[1:01:25] or outwardly you look beautiful like a
[1:01:27] whited suffolker like a whited
[1:01:29] gravestone but inwardly you're full of
[1:01:31] dead men's bones
[1:01:33] i'll say like this may we look good on
[1:01:35] the outside maybe we look holy on the
[1:01:36] outside but may we have cleanliness on
[1:01:38] the inside amen
[1:01:40] may we have life on the inside a new
[1:01:42] heart a new sphere and god's spirit
[1:01:44] praise god
[1:01:45] but they were dead on the inside let the
[1:01:47] life of god shine out of your life
[1:01:49] church show the love of god manifest the
[1:01:51] light of god let your light sign sow
[1:01:54] before men that they'll see your good
[1:01:55] works and glorify your father in heaven
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] hallelujah
[1:02:00] i like that song i've got the life of
[1:02:03] god in me
[1:02:06] i've got the life of god in me
[1:02:12] i got his life
[1:02:14] his nature
[1:02:15] and his liberty i've got the life of god
[1:02:20] in me
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:24] we don't have dead men's bones in us
[1:02:26] praise god we've got the life of jesus
[1:02:28] inside of us
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:33] well then let it shine let the love of
[1:02:34] jesus shine especially in your marriage
[1:02:37] especially in your family
[1:02:41] because here's where god says i won't
[1:02:42] receive your offering if you're
[1:02:44] mistreating your wife or your husband
[1:02:46] verse 14. yet ye say wherefore in other
[1:02:48] words why don't you receive my offerings
[1:02:50] because the lord had been witness
[1:02:52] between thee and the wife of thy youth
[1:02:54] against whom thou hast dealt
[1:02:55] treacherously yet is she thy companion
[1:02:58] and the wife of thy covenant
[1:03:02] did he not make one
[1:03:04] yet had he the residue of the spirit and
[1:03:06] wherefore one that he might seek a godly
[1:03:09] seed take i'm sorry therefore take heed
[1:03:12] to your spirit and let not i'm sorry and
[1:03:14] let none deal treacherously with the
[1:03:15] wife of his youth see that's why we're
[1:03:17] here today church we're here to take
[1:03:18] heed to our thinking
[1:03:21] so you don't get weak on the week on god
[1:03:23] this week
[1:03:26] it's my prayer you don't go home tonight
[1:03:28] after second service and you fall into
[1:03:30] some temptation
[1:03:32] or you fall into some weak spiritual
[1:03:34] state where you're not as strong as you
[1:03:36] were when you came here this morning
[1:03:39] if you do it wasn't my fault because i
[1:03:40] preached the word amen hallelujah as far
[1:03:43] as i know my honesty in my heart i
[1:03:44] prayed here half hour before the service
[1:03:46] i've tried to confess everything you
[1:03:47] know just trying to consecrate myself if
[1:03:49] you knew it wasn't my fault amen now it
[1:03:51] could be sometimes it could be my fault
[1:03:52] sometimes i could miss the sometimes i
[1:03:54] miss the leading of the lord
[1:03:56] i'm not perfect
[1:03:59] like i felt bad on a good friday let me
[1:04:00] just share this this will kind of get it
[1:04:01] off my heart i felt like i just missed
[1:04:03] the main thought of the sermon on good
[1:04:05] friday when i shared all those examples
[1:04:07] of the old testament after each one
[1:04:09] after each one i said i wanted to
[1:04:10] emphasize but the blood of the covenant
[1:04:13] forgave them and kept them strong i felt
[1:04:15] like i was just too harsh on just you
[1:04:17] know just their sins
[1:04:19] but i wanted to give you hope i didn't
[1:04:20] want to just
[1:04:21] preach all those sins and i want to give
[1:04:23] you hope i want to emphasize the power
[1:04:25] of the blood so
[1:04:27] i enjoyed the service but i felt like i
[1:04:28] didn't emphasize it the way i wanted to
[1:04:32] so forgive me on that one i just felt
[1:04:34] like
[1:04:35] i felt i put too much emphasis maybe on
[1:04:37] hardness of cutting preaching and
[1:04:39] you know stay away from these sins but i
[1:04:40] want to give you some hope i want to
[1:04:42] give you uh some joy through the blood
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:45] if their blood covenants protected them
[1:04:47] and forgave them of drunkenness and lies
[1:04:50] and deception and all these things
[1:04:52] surely the blood of jesus will forgive
[1:04:53] us of all of our sins amen
[1:04:55] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:05:00] but the man said it's good for your soul
[1:05:02] to be honest
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:06] james 4 6 james 4 6 how does god oppose
[1:05:10] you in your prayers if you get prideful
[1:05:13] james 4 6
[1:05:18] hebrews james
[1:05:22] there's my hour so let me try to finish
[1:05:24] up here
[1:05:28] james 4 6
[1:05:31] now in this text he's talking about
[1:05:32] worliness and how christians are friends
[1:05:35] with the world and
[1:05:37] james says
[1:05:38] god gets jealous when you're friends
[1:05:39] with the world
[1:05:43] doesn't the bible say i'm a jealous god
[1:05:45] god don't want you to make love to
[1:05:47] netflix
[1:05:48] god i don't want you to make love
[1:05:50] to cigarettes
[1:05:52] i don't want you to make love to
[1:05:53] chocolate
[1:05:59] i don't want your uh
[1:06:01] god i don't want you all your pleasures
[1:06:02] to go somewhere else he wants to be your
[1:06:04] pleasure
[1:06:06] amen he wants to feel your love and your
[1:06:08] praises amen
[1:06:10] he don't want me to love sports you
[1:06:12] don't want me to worship a pigskin can
[1:06:14] you imagine a piece of pigskin filled
[1:06:16] with air he don't want me to worship
[1:06:17] that he wants me to worship him praise
[1:06:19] god
[1:06:20] the god who made the made the pig amen
[1:06:23] the god who made all these things praise
[1:06:25] the lord hallelujah
[1:06:27] and the main thing with pride he don't
[1:06:29] want us to worship ourselves amen there
[1:06:31] it is right there because that's what
[1:06:33] lucifer did amen
[1:06:34] i will be like i'll get the worship i'll
[1:06:37] be like the most high
[1:06:38] he don't want us to make love to you
[1:06:40] know
[1:06:41] the spirit of pride
[1:06:43] look how great i am well i'm really
[1:06:44] accomplished i've really done something
[1:06:46] i'm really confident in myself
[1:06:48] just wait a while you'll get sick and
[1:06:50] then you'll see how little you are you
[1:06:51] know just wait a little bit
[1:06:53] winter's coming around you know you'll
[1:06:54] see
[1:07:02] because remember church whatever we reap
[1:07:04] that's what we sow i'm sorry no whatever
[1:07:06] we sow forgive me whatever we sow
[1:07:08] whatever we plant that's what we're
[1:07:09] gonna reap
[1:07:14] james 4
[1:07:15] 6.
[1:07:17] now verse 5 is where he says god is a
[1:07:20] jealous god he lusts us doesn't the
[1:07:21] spirit lust is to envy doesn't god get
[1:07:24] jealous
[1:07:25] when we are friends with the world
[1:07:26] instead of friends with him and his word
[1:07:29] verse 7.
[1:07:31] i'm sorry verse 6 but he giveth more
[1:07:33] grace wherefore he saith god resists the
[1:07:35] proud but gives grace into the humble
[1:07:39] that's what i love about david
[1:07:40] although
[1:07:42] he committed murder although he
[1:07:43] committed adultery
[1:07:45] he laid there in the temple for seven
[1:07:47] days
[1:07:48] asking god god will you give me another
[1:07:50] thus saith the lord can you give me was
[1:07:52] that a permissive thus saith the lord
[1:07:54] that's what i love about david amen
[1:07:57] when nathan told him it was him he said
[1:07:59] i'm the man i'm the guilty one
[1:08:02] now church i don't know how long it was
[1:08:04] that he denied it
[1:08:06] but i love when he finally repented he
[1:08:09] the bible said he threw himself into the
[1:08:11] house of god jerusalem don't we see the
[1:08:12] same pattern
[1:08:14] we get distracted from the things of god
[1:08:16] but then thankfully god by his grace
[1:08:17] brings us back to our first love the
[1:08:19] house of god worshiping god reading the
[1:08:21] word hearing the preaching singing a new
[1:08:23] song in the god event being together
[1:08:26] with god's people god always brings us
[1:08:27] back to the house of god why because
[1:08:29] you're just like david you're a bride
[1:08:31] after jesus's own heart praise god
[1:08:34] amen
[1:08:36] see it's a very similar parallel
[1:08:38] david a man after god's own heart we
[1:08:40] should be the bride
[1:08:42] after the heart of husband jesus
[1:08:46] right when you got married you should
[1:08:47] have been after that person's heart you
[1:08:49] just been doing a lot of nice things for
[1:08:50] that person
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] you're after their heart
[1:08:56] you want them to love you for the rest
[1:08:58] of their lives
[1:09:00] that's a pretty big task sometimes i
[1:09:01] don't think we consider how
[1:09:03] how much a big tax task that is
[1:09:06] decades long decades decades yes decades
[1:09:09] a whole lifetime amen
[1:09:14] thank god for his grace
[1:09:16] he gives us more grace
[1:09:20] verse 7 here's how you do it you submit
[1:09:22] yourself to god in other words you obey
[1:09:24] god
[1:09:26] you resist satan and he will flee from
[1:09:28] you
[1:09:29] praise god
[1:09:31] in other words you obey you obey obey
[1:09:33] until the power well brother jess i
[1:09:35] still feel tempted we'll keep obeying
[1:09:36] keep resisting keep fighting and pretty
[1:09:39] soon you'll you'll probably wake up and
[1:09:40] that spirit all be gone
[1:09:42] kind of wake up from your uh just from
[1:09:45] your battle realize oh i'm not even
[1:09:47] bound with that anymore praise god thank
[1:09:48] you jesus
[1:09:50] for the victory i've been so focused on
[1:09:52] you the enemy has left amen
[1:09:55] hallelujah
[1:09:56] satan's left
[1:09:59] because i submitted to god i obeyed the
[1:10:02] word i read the word i worshiped god i
[1:10:05] was focusing on god and not myself amen
[1:10:09] i resisted satan so he had to flee
[1:10:12] well if he's gone who's there jesus amen
[1:10:16] so just me and jesus amen
[1:10:18] it's just the lord and i
[1:10:21] it's just a fellowship what a fellowship
[1:10:23] what a joy divine leaning on the
[1:10:25] everlasting arms praise god
[1:10:28] it's just the lord and i i'm leaning on
[1:10:29] into my lord i'm enjoying his fellowship
[1:10:31] i'm laying in his bosom like john the
[1:10:33] beloved
[1:10:35] hallelujah
[1:10:38] humble yourself in the sight of the lord
[1:10:40] i'm sorry verse 8 draw night to god
[1:10:42] he'll draw night to you cleanse your
[1:10:44] hands ye sinners purify your hearts you
[1:10:47] double-minded
[1:10:50] be afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[1:10:52] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[1:10:54] joy to heaviness sure sometimes i battle
[1:10:57] temptations and things so hard i've got
[1:10:59] to go in the prayer closet and i've told
[1:11:00] my wife this different things you know i
[1:11:02] struggled with over the years and then
[1:11:03] when there's troubles in the church i'll
[1:11:05] get so upset i've got to go and i've got
[1:11:07] to just pray in the prayer closet and
[1:11:08] i'll just start weeping and crying
[1:11:10] saying god help me i need your help
[1:11:13] i need your strength i can totally
[1:11:15] relate to this scripture
[1:11:18] praise god
[1:11:19] when you're tempted when you're tested
[1:11:21] the only way out is god amen i don't
[1:11:24] know he's the only way out he's the only
[1:11:25] way in amen he's he's everything praise
[1:11:28] god hallelujah
[1:11:29] draw night to god what's the answer
[1:11:31] every time the answer is draw nigh to
[1:11:33] god confess your sins get rid of your
[1:11:35] pride humble yourself and he'll lift you
[1:11:37] up praise god
[1:11:42] and if god lifts you up then you'll know
[1:11:43] god lifted you up
[1:11:45] right because you know god did this god
[1:11:47] answered this prayer hallelujah
[1:11:50] many times he'll do it publicly too
[1:11:51] he'll just honor you publicly in front
[1:11:52] of other people because if you pray in
[1:11:54] secret he rewards you publicly
[1:11:56] if you can humble yourself and give in
[1:11:58] secret he rewards you openly
[1:12:00] publicly
[1:12:09] proverbs 16 18.
[1:12:12] we'll just hit a couple of proper
[1:12:13] scriptures and we'll finish up i thought
[1:12:14] i would get the king more on king uzziah
[1:12:16] today
[1:12:20] but i think i'll save that
[1:12:23] proverbs 16 18. oh good you're fast good
[1:12:25] job
[1:12:26] i didn't have to turn there
[1:12:28] pride goeth before destruction
[1:12:32] and a haughty spirit before a fall
[1:12:35] so anytime we would fall into a
[1:12:37] temptation
[1:12:39] it's because
[1:12:40] we first accepted the evil spirit of
[1:12:42] pride
[1:12:44] and we are all susceptible to it
[1:12:50] that's the point i want to make i
[1:12:51] believe if you're a wise virgin
[1:12:56] it seems to me
[1:12:58] the greatest battle you'll have is with
[1:13:00] the spirit of pride
[1:13:02] where you become self-confident in
[1:13:04] yourself rather than trusting in god
[1:13:10] i've got a list of brother branhams real
[1:13:11] quick and i may preach these maybe
[1:13:13] wednesday night we'll see
[1:13:16] brother bam one of the first things with
[1:13:18] pride he battled was his mother-in-law
[1:13:20] remember his mother-in-law told him
[1:13:21] don't you go with those pentecostals
[1:13:23] they're a bunch of trash
[1:13:26] brother ram knew that wasn't true but he
[1:13:27] said okay i don't want to disobey my
[1:13:29] wife's mom
[1:13:31] and then he suffered greatly because of
[1:13:33] that
[1:13:34] lost two family members
[1:13:37] suffered
[1:13:39] because of what pride that wasn't lust
[1:13:41] of the flesh was it
[1:13:43] no was that lust of the eyes i'm not
[1:13:45] going to go with the pentecostals
[1:13:46] because of the lust of the eyes or the
[1:13:48] lust of the it was the pride of life
[1:13:51] well my mother-in-law doesn't want me to
[1:13:53] do this now what about us my dad doesn't
[1:13:55] want me to do this my mom don't want me
[1:13:57] to do that my
[1:13:58] you know my brother don't want me to do
[1:14:00] it my sister don't want me to do it
[1:14:02] are we going to take god's way or we're
[1:14:04] going to take mom's way
[1:14:06] dad's way
[1:14:08] mother-in-law's way
[1:14:12] so when i look at brother bram's life
[1:14:13] most of his trials most of his falls
[1:14:16] which he he talked about openly we're
[1:14:18] not bashing brother branham
[1:14:20] it's just great
[1:14:21] it's just great to see he was human like
[1:14:23] us
[1:14:24] praise god
[1:14:25] it's great to know that he needed jesus
[1:14:27] christ for his advocate just like we
[1:14:29] need jesus christ for an advocate today
[1:14:31] lying to the irs what was that was that
[1:14:33] lust of the flesh
[1:14:34] his flesh wanted something was that lust
[1:14:36] of the eyes he was lusting after
[1:14:37] something it was the pride of life
[1:14:44] brother branham had amoebas for six
[1:14:46] months
[1:14:47] laid in the bed after that uh south
[1:14:49] africa meeting
[1:14:50] durbin meeting
[1:14:53] six months he laid in bed why because he
[1:14:56] went with the preacher's schedule and
[1:14:58] itinerary rather than god's angel
[1:15:00] telling him where to go
[1:15:02] what was that was that lust of the flesh
[1:15:04] no the lust of the eyes
[1:15:07] pride of life
[1:15:09] part of life i'm going to take the
[1:15:10] denomination schedule look at this he
[1:15:13] had to overcome his mother-in-law and
[1:15:14] denominations
[1:15:15] he had to learn all these lessons amen
[1:15:18] the church who's influencing you is it a
[1:15:20] mother-in-law father-in-law
[1:15:22] you got to be we got to be careful
[1:15:24] careful who's influencing us
[1:15:27] because that's where we're going to fall
[1:15:28] many times
[1:15:30] as if we pridefully take somebody else's
[1:15:32] influence rather than god's influence
[1:15:40] how about the critical spirit brother
[1:15:41] branham had
[1:15:43] he said this critical spirit is haunting
[1:15:45] me i'm criticizing voice of healing i'm
[1:15:46] criticizing this preacher criticizing
[1:15:48] that spirit what is that that's not lust
[1:15:50] of the flesh that's not pride of life
[1:15:51] i'm sorry that's not lust of the eyes
[1:15:52] that's part of part of life
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:56] brother branham told god one time you
[1:15:58] owe me an understanding why
[1:16:00] uh this you let this mother die after
[1:16:02] she was healed
[1:16:06] god wouldn't talk to me i felt like for
[1:16:07] two weeks he said like a black sheep
[1:16:09] came down what is that god resist what
[1:16:11] god resists the proud
[1:16:14] god's resisting his prayers i'm not
[1:16:16] gonna hear your prayers
[1:16:18] do you ever hear about brother brown
[1:16:19] falling into cigarettes or alcohol
[1:16:21] no
[1:16:22] ever feel heard brother i'm falling
[1:16:24] about into adultery or anything like
[1:16:25] that no
[1:16:27] what did he fall into
[1:16:29] he fell into pride
[1:16:32] what are you likely to fall into bride
[1:16:36] what am i likely to fall into likely
[1:16:38] pride
[1:16:40] he said god you owe me something and god
[1:16:42] told him i don't owe you anything
[1:16:45] now church look how humble that is
[1:16:49] we think something has to work out a
[1:16:50] certain way god don't have to god don't
[1:16:52] have to heal
[1:16:54] god don't have to give us
[1:16:55] god don't have to give us the desires of
[1:16:57] our heart
[1:16:59] praise god
[1:17:00] his word says he will but of course
[1:17:01] that's conditional
[1:17:03] based upon what the will of god
[1:17:14] and of course you were familiar with the
[1:17:15] complex that he had in 1963 standing in
[1:17:18] the gap he wanted to leave the ministry
[1:17:20] and i just i'm going to leave all these
[1:17:22] churches because they just cut their
[1:17:23] hair anyway these the men just smoke and
[1:17:24] cuss and
[1:17:25] i'm just going to leave the ministry
[1:17:28] i'm just going to live up in the
[1:17:29] mountain i'm going to run away from
[1:17:30] everybody i'm going to be a hermit up in
[1:17:31] the mountains that's that's like my
[1:17:32] that's like that's just like my dad
[1:17:33] that's just exactly exactly like my dad
[1:17:35] he just wants to be a hermit wants to
[1:17:37] live out all there in his apartment
[1:17:39] we visit him a couple weeks ago that's
[1:17:40] just exactly what it is so sad
[1:17:43] just live away from everybody i don't
[1:17:44] want nothing to do with anybody
[1:17:45] everybody hates me i hate everybody
[1:17:47] this was a complex he had to battle and
[1:17:50] god had to help him overcome aren't you
[1:17:52] glad god was faithful
[1:17:54] aren't you glad god never took that
[1:17:56] hedge away from his mind hallelujah god
[1:17:59] never lifted his hand from the prophet
[1:18:01] thank god but god gave him grace
[1:18:04] to overcome pride
[1:18:11] proverbs 13 10. i'll close with this one
[1:18:14] i'll close with this one i will close
[1:18:17] hallelujah you join the word today
[1:18:20] amen it's good to be back with the home
[1:18:22] home church you know about god's grace i
[1:18:23] feel i was out i was out of this pulpit
[1:18:25] for a whole month can you believe that
[1:18:27] but i guess god has a time and season
[1:18:29] for everything
[1:18:30] i had it you know from january all the
[1:18:31] way till april anyway so it was good
[1:18:35] so church if you see contention life
[1:18:37] only by pride comes contention or strife
[1:18:40] if there's strife in your life it's
[1:18:42] likely because pride started it
[1:18:45] if you have a strife or division against
[1:18:46] a brother sister
[1:18:49] husband wife mother father if you have
[1:18:52] contention or strife
[1:18:54] in your life
[1:18:56] it's probably due to someone's pride
[1:19:00] you know what it takes it takes somebody
[1:19:01] with humility if you like jesus said if
[1:19:03] you know somebody's got to ought against
[1:19:04] you what do you do you go to them
[1:19:07] and you make it right if you've got to
[1:19:09] ought against somebody what do you do
[1:19:10] you humble yourself go to that person
[1:19:15] that's real humility
[1:19:18] now church when we think about this when
[1:19:20] i thought about this the first thought i
[1:19:21] had was wow thank god that i can live a
[1:19:24] peaceful life
[1:19:28] how many people's lives are filled with
[1:19:30] drama and strife and arguments and
[1:19:32] debates and fusses all that's all they
[1:19:35] go through
[1:19:36] austin knows tell me about that with his
[1:19:38] life we've all been through it
[1:19:41] everything's a battle everything's a
[1:19:42] strife everything's an argument
[1:19:44] everything's a straining and
[1:19:45] everything's a fight
[1:19:47] that's because of
[1:19:48] pride and it can be easily taken care of
[1:19:52] if someone will be clothed with humility
[1:19:55] if someone will put on
[1:19:57] the garment of humility
[1:19:59] humble themselves
[1:20:01] draw night to god confess your sins
[1:20:04] and then god will exalt you in due
[1:20:06] season
[1:20:08] let's stand to our feet here musicians
[1:20:09] can come
[1:20:26] you can stop the live stream hundred
[1:20:28] maybe it stopped already right we've
[1:20:29] been having such trouble
