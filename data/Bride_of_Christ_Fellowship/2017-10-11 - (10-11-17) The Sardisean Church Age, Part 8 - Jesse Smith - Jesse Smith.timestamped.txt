[4:47] and made me what I am today and so we've
[4:50] been texting I got his number and he

[5:00] and said the name of Jesus Christ so
[5:03] we're trying to set up a meeting but you

[46:10] god bless your being seated praise the
[46:11] Lord now I can switch over when you're
[46:15] ready praise the Lord so I want to just
[46:28] go over these quick quotes real quick
[46:30] going verse by verse brother Branham
[46:32] said there's a great benefit to the
[46:34] churches and it's only a ministry that a
[46:37] pastor can do so I want you to be
[46:39] encouraged you know and I encourages me
[46:43] to read these as well by God's grace
[46:45] remember brother Branham said oh my he
[46:47] said I remember staying a year and six
[46:48] months in the book of Revelation and the
[46:50] tabernacle here that's what I liked in
[46:52] teaching I just love teaching oh my I
[46:54] think it's wonderful it gives the basis
[46:57] so the foundation and it settles the
[47:00] church amen aren't you glad that these
[47:02] doctrines can be settled praise God in
[47:04] fact the person who has come in here
[47:06] said told me in an email that their
[47:09] church has no no foundation they have no
[47:11] doctrine they just preach on thunders
[47:13] and all kinds of things like this and
[47:15] they want to come to our church because
[47:16] they've been streaming and felt led of
[47:17] the Holy Spirit that they feel settled
[47:20] and the word is being taught well Ram
[47:22] said he loved teaching how many love
[47:24] teaching the Word of God oh I love it I
[47:26] love going deep in God's Word don't you
[47:28] now he said here he talks brother Brown
[47:30] just got done reading Ephesians chapter
[47:33] 1 verses 4 & 5 he said this book is not
[47:35] addressed to evangelistic teaching or
[47:38] evangelistic I'm sorry Vangelis sermons
[47:41] he said I don't touch this on the fields
[47:43] I bring this to the church for Paul
[47:44] addressed to the Saints those that are
[47:46] called and preserved in our field and
[47:48] our set aside and are in the holy spirit
[47:50] already in Canaan's land just take a
[47:52] moment stop and think about that when
[47:54] was the last time you heard evangelists
[47:58] go verse by verse and teach you like a
[47:59] whole chapter
[48:00] when was the last time anybody ever
[48:01] heard what sister Beatrice is shaking
[48:03] her head and she served the Lord a
[48:05] wonderful amount of years by God's grace
[48:07] and that's true brother and said there
[48:09] are certain gifts you know they don't
[48:11] that do certain things but we appreciate
[48:12] Evangelos Evangelos coming here they're
[48:14] supposed to set a fire in the church
[48:15] amen
[48:17] but pastors are supposed to teach the
[48:19] Word of God scripture by scripture this
[48:22] is something that evangelist can do is
[48:24] go right here and teach the Word of God
[48:25] like we've been doing by the grace of
[48:27] God so I just want to review those
[48:30] briefly
[48:30] so you remember those now I want to show
[48:34] you how this chapter ends now I want to
[48:36] get your feedback what I did was I put
[48:38] like the main idea of a section of this
[48:42] last part of the chapter and then I put
[48:44] the scriptures behind it and I want your
[48:45] hands raised if you want me to if you
[48:47] want me to go through the scriptures
[48:49] because I want to know how familiar you
[48:51] are with those scriptures you might be
[48:53] very familiar that's wonderful we'll go
[48:55] right to the end then but I kind of
[48:58] would like to know so have your hand
[48:59] ready if you can if not I'll just preach
[49:02] what I feel like to preach okay because
[49:04] I would like your feedback but I don't
[49:06] want to get redundant if you've already
[49:07] know these things and they bless your
[49:09] soul and you've already you invested
[49:12] been blessed by them we'll head to the
[49:13] end where where brother em take sus in
[49:16] this teaching okay so I got the the main
[49:20] ideas in white and then the scriptures
[49:23] in yellow so you'll see it right here so
[49:26] brother Branham in the next portion of
[49:28] the church age book he quotes these
[49:30] three scriptures and shows there's a
[49:32] separation of people at the white throne
[49:34] judgment now we know we know the
[49:39] scripture so in Matthew 25 he separates
[49:43] the the group that's the righteous from
[49:46] the goats and they're as sheep separated
[49:49] from the goats and this is also
[49:51] revelation 20 where the books are open
[49:54] and they separate those to eternal life
[49:55] and those to eternal judgment and then
[49:59] Daniel 7 where the thousands upon
[50:02] thousands ministered minister to Christ
[50:04] and the books are open as anybody would
[50:06] need to go through those by God's grace
[50:07] I thought that was pretty familiar I'd
[50:09] like to go through this okay praise the
[50:10] Lord let's do that let's go to Matthew
[50:12] 25 this is a really good scripture
[50:14] I love this portion mother so much and
[50:19] recently when I've sat down with a few I
[50:21] think it's been two or three people I
[50:23] said I said do you know how merciful God
[50:26] is and I used Matthew 25 God is so
[50:30] merciful he's gonna give people eternal
[50:32] life just for being good to the
[50:34] righteous I'm sorry just being good to
[50:36] the Bride of Christ
[50:38] 25:31 so the white throne judgment is a
[50:44] separation of people now the rapture is
[50:48] kind of like that too except it's
[50:49] separating the bride from the whole rest
[50:51] of the world but at the white throne
[50:54] judgment you're separating the righteous
[50:56] from the goats
[50:57] now remember program said they're not
[50:59] sheep the foolish virgin are not sheep
[51:02] necessarily because the sheep already
[51:04] heard the voice of Christ and were
[51:06] already raptured are you with me but the
[51:09] Bible said they're separated as sheep
[51:11] from the goats and remember this is a
[51:14] parable so let's go to verse 21
[51:16] I'm sorry 31 25 31 when the Son of man
[51:22] shall come in his glory and all the holy
[51:23] angels with him then shall he sit upon
[51:26] the throne of his glory and before him
[51:28] shall be gathered all nations look at
[51:30] that even Russia right China North Korea
[51:33] all nations will be gathered before
[51:36] Christ amen
[51:37] and he shall separate them one from
[51:39] another as a shepherd divideth his sheep
[51:41] from the goats now look as a shepherd so
[51:44] brother ram catches the inspiration of
[51:45] the Holy Spirit and said now look it's
[51:47] as a shepherd it's not literally the
[51:50] Sheep though he said because the sheep
[51:52] are the bride members because the Sheep
[51:54] won't follow a stranger you see a
[51:57] foolish virgin might follow a stranger
[52:00] they might follow somebody who's not
[52:02] exactly on the word because they're just
[52:03] living the best they know how right some
[52:06] of them are just given eternal life just
[52:07] because they were nice to a bride member
[52:10] but see the Sheep already heard the
[52:13] shepherd and they got eternal life and
[52:15] they're in the rapture amen
[52:16] now he says this verse 33 and he shall
[52:20] set the sheep on his right hand but the
[52:23] goats on the left so I'll just stand
[52:24] over here like this sheep are over here
[52:26] and the goats are over there
[52:28] so you are sheep tonight by God's grace
[52:31] you understand what I'm saying there say
[52:32] what I'm saying we want the believers
[52:34] right all the believers to be on the
[52:35] right side now the bride will be with
[52:37] him on the throne amen
[52:39] so you all if we're bride members will
[52:41] sit on the throne with Christ that's
[52:43] right now
[52:45] verse 34 then shall the King saying to
[52:48] them on the right hand come you blessed
[52:49] of my father inherit the kingdom
[52:51] prepared for you from the foundation of
[52:53] the world now stop right there you see
[52:56] and that scripture Jesus knows the
[52:58] foolish virgin he knew them before the
[53:00] foundation of the world so just when you
[53:03] and when people preach all where the
[53:04] bride we were known before the
[53:05] foundation world that's true but also
[53:08] the foolish virgin was known before the
[53:10] foundation of the world as well right
[53:12] because God God has full omniscience
[53:15] right he's all-knowing so it's no
[53:18] surprise that Christ is giving them
[53:19] salvation because he already knew they'd
[53:21] be saved before the foundation of the
[53:23] world now verse 35 for I was hungered
[53:26] and you gave me me so think about times
[53:28] you were hungry and somebody fed you now
[53:31] this just my thought right here my
[53:32] grandmother grandma Emma Smith she fed
[53:37] my family when we were so poor we got
[53:40] kicked out of what we lost our house
[53:41] because my dad was got laid off and the
[53:44] farm they had a drought the farm fell we
[53:47] went bankrupt and my grandmother fed all
[53:50] of us little children and took all eight
[53:53] of us in because my parents had six kids
[53:55] so I'm I'm hoping this scripture reaches
[53:58] out to my grandmother
[53:59] my grandmother wore shorts painted her
[54:01] face went to the Catholic Church but
[54:03] Church I'm hoping listen I said hoping
[54:06] I'm hoping God will give my grandma
[54:08] Smith eternal life because she fed a
[54:11] family and look now we got we believe
[54:13] bride members in the family we believe
[54:16] we're trusting with all of our hearts we
[54:20] were poor they'd have no money and she
[54:22] fed us now I'm just just trying to let
[54:24] you know I'm trying to apply this to my
[54:26] life here okay now I said I was thirsty
[54:29] and you gave me drink
[54:30] I was a stranger and you took me in
[54:32] naked and you clothed me I was sick and
[54:35] you visited me I was in prison and you
[54:38] came unto me then shall the righteous
[54:41] answer him saying Lord
[54:42] or when saw we thee a hungered and fed
[54:44] thee or thirsty and gave thee drink let
[54:46] me stop right there a church do you
[54:48] understand this real quick we must be
[54:52] humble enough to receive gifts from
[54:54] people recently I've talked to so many
[54:57] Russians they somebody but a few people
[54:59] that they tell me well I'm I got so much
[55:02] pride I won't take a gift but I look
[55:04] Church if we that if these people didn't
[55:06] take a gift they wouldn't have received
[55:08] eternal life you see that they had to
[55:11] let a sinner come and give them food
[55:14] they had to let somebody come help but
[55:16] when they're sick are you with me Church
[55:17] we have to be humble enough to receive
[55:20] help but so often we get so prideful we
[55:23] won't we won't let anybody know that
[55:24] we've got struggles I'm not I'm not
[55:27] telling you to go tell everybody all
[55:28] your problems or put all your problems
[55:29] on Facebook I'm not saying that but if
[55:32] somebody knows you ever need sometimes
[55:35] you got to be humble enough to receive
[55:36] that that does that you understand that
[55:38] Paul was the same way in Philippians for
[55:41] I just read through the whole book of
[55:42] Philippians and on Alman colossians paul
[55:44] said i received your gift that you sent
[55:46] me not that I necessarily needed it but
[55:48] so that you would have fruit for your
[55:50] rewards that's what he said in
[55:52] Philippians chapter 4 because he said I
[55:54] can do all things through Christ who
[55:56] strengthens me I know how to abound and
[55:59] I know how to be abased I know to be
[56:01] content with whatever I have but see
[56:04] Church even as the bride of Jesus Christ
[56:05] we if we're in a bad state we got to
[56:08] accept people's gifts so I thought that
[56:11] would be helpful to you then show the
[56:13] rights okay we've did 3738 when saw we
[56:16] thee a stranger and took thee in or
[56:17] naked and clothed thee when saw we thee
[56:20] sick or in prison and came unto thee and
[56:22] the King shall answer and say to them
[56:24] verily I say to you as in as much as
[56:25] you've done it delete one at least of
[56:26] these my brethren you've done it unto me
[56:29] praise God
[56:30] there's the Living God in the Living
[56:32] Church then shall ye say also unto them
[56:35] on the left hand depart from me you
[56:37] cursed into everlasting fire prepared
[56:38] for the devil and his angels for I was a
[56:40] hungered and you gave me no meat I was
[56:42] thirsty and you gave me no drink I was a
[56:46] stranger and you took me not in naked
[56:48] and you clothed me not sick and in
[56:50] prison and you visited me not then shall
[56:53] they also answer to him saying Lord when
[56:55] saw thee we in hung
[56:56] or thirst or a stranger naked or sick or
[56:58] in prison and did not minister unto thee
[57:01] then shall ye answered them saying
[57:03] verily I say to you in as much as you
[57:05] did it not unto the one at least of
[57:06] these you did it not to me and these
[57:09] shall go away into everlasting judgment
[57:11] but the righteous into eternal life now
[57:16] I want you to go back to verse 37 now
[57:21] here's a group that's receiving eternal
[57:24] life and they're surprised to receive it
[57:28] can you imagine that that I wonder what
[57:32] kind of life did they live on earth
[57:33] where when they stand before Christ
[57:35] they're surprised what when did we do
[57:38] this Lord when they weren't even aware
[57:41] right because they say Lord when saw
[57:44] thee we hungered or fed thee or thirsty
[57:46] and gave thee drink they're surprised
[57:47] and mother and said there'll be
[57:49] surprises and disappointments on the day
[57:51] of judgment look at this church this is
[57:54] quite striking the foolish version is
[57:56] gonna be surprised when did we see you
[57:59] so see the foolish version doesn't even
[58:01] have enough spiritual understanding to
[58:04] recognize God in flesh right because
[58:07] they did something good to God in flesh
[58:09] brother Adam and they didn't even have
[58:11] an idea that was God in flesh look how
[58:12] humble a real Christian is they are so
[58:16] humble that a foolish virgin don't even
[58:17] know that this is God in flesh
[58:19] oh my holiday that encourages me tonight
[58:22] amen
[58:22] that God can be in me Christ can be in
[58:25] me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[58:27] I can live such a humble life that
[58:29] people don't even know God is inside me
[58:31] they might think oh he's a nice fella
[58:33] like people told me this week the nicest
[58:35] fellow they ever met or something like
[58:36] that but by the grace of God look how
[58:41] the foolish virgin is not even aware
[58:43] that God's in flesh how many want to be
[58:45] aware of God in flesh I do I want to see
[58:48] Christ in you I want you to see Christ
[58:49] in me but these voice version they
[58:52] didn't they're certain they're shocked
[58:53] what do you mean when did we do this
[58:54] when did we do this to you Jesus they
[58:57] didn't know Christ was in his bride they
[58:59] maybe know that now go to Revelation 20
[59:01] verse 11 let's do that because we had
[59:03] one hand up that one to read over this I
[59:05] appreciate your patience here tonight
[59:06] now see Church we'll get something out
[59:08] of this if we just keep pulling on
[59:10] the Word of God amen there's things in
[59:12] here that we can learn from theirs but
[59:13] this book's eternal I went back and
[59:16] listened to a sermon I preached five
[59:17] years ago and I was hearing things like
[59:19] my I forgot all about that
[59:21] and boy was I a lot louder and I was a
[59:23] lot more what could I say
[59:25] zealous I had a lot more energy now I
[59:28] feel like I hardly have any energy
[59:31] mystery this week I'm gonna preach five
[59:33] times this week I preach on Tuesday
[59:36] morning at the Bible club preach tonight
[59:39] I'll preach tomorrow after school advice
[59:42] on Sunday I just want to give everything
[59:45] I can to Christ if that's what my life
[59:47] is praise the Lord that's usually not
[59:49] that busy but this week is extra busy
[59:52] week all the weeks all the turns off
[59:54] fell on me this week that's okay I can
[59:57] do all things through Christ I can be
[59:59] content with whatever my love is it's 11
[1:00:04] and I saw a great white throne and him
[1:00:07] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[1:00:09] and heaven fled away my and there was
[1:00:12] found no place for them think of that
[1:00:15] heaven and earth there's found no place
[1:00:18] so where we at we're in heaven right
[1:00:21] hallelujah where the Friends of the Lord
[1:00:23] then the earthly heavens right the
[1:00:26] atmospheres verse 12 and I saw the dead
[1:00:28] small and great stand before God and the
[1:00:31] books were opened another book was
[1:00:32] opened which is the book of life and the
[1:00:34] dead were judged out of those things
[1:00:35] which were written in the books
[1:00:36] according to their works now get ready
[1:00:39] remember we're talking about separation
[1:00:41] remember separate God's separating
[1:00:43] people from the sheep as sheep from
[1:00:46] goats now look at this verse 13 and the
[1:00:50] sea gave up the Dead which were in it
[1:00:52] imagine those bodies laying down there
[1:00:53] in the bottom of the sea Christ is gonna
[1:00:55] call those bodies up amen and death and
[1:00:59] he'll delivered up the Dead which were
[1:01:00] in them so see it is there it is that
[1:01:03] like the rich young ruler
[1:01:05] remember he died in hell he lifted up
[1:01:06] his eyes he's gonna get called out of
[1:01:08] that and they were judged every man
[1:01:12] according their works and death and
[1:01:13] he'll were cast in like a fire and this
[1:01:15] is the second death and whoever was not
[1:01:18] found written in the book of life was
[1:01:19] cast in the lake of fire see the
[1:01:21] separation Christ caused everybody
[1:01:24] from the seas from the lands wherever
[1:01:25] they are he calls him even from Hell
[1:01:27] right from Hades we'd say he calls their
[1:01:30] souls out of Hades pulls their bodies up
[1:01:32] out of the sea and then he brings them
[1:01:34] together reads what's in the book
[1:01:36] separates one to one to eternal life and
[1:01:38] the other to the lake of fire that's
[1:01:41] right the last one Daniel 7 9 and 10
[1:01:44] let's go there we just got done
[1:01:45] preaching on Daniel and I believe it was
[1:01:47] June if I'm not mistaken preach the
[1:01:50] whole Book of Daniel praises God Daniel
[1:01:52] chapter 7 verse 9
[1:01:59] all right 7 9 and 10
[1:02:01] I beheld to the thrones were cast down
[1:02:03] and the Ancient of Days did sit whose
[1:02:04] garment was white as snow and the hair
[1:02:07] of his head like pure wool his throne
[1:02:09] was like a fiery flame and his wheels as
[1:02:12] burning fire amen picture that that's
[1:02:15] the remember this is the same picture
[1:02:16] same idea fiery flames there's just fire
[1:02:20] everywhere and Christ is sitting there
[1:02:22] and you're right next to him amen
[1:02:24] hallelujah verse 10 a fiery stream
[1:02:28] issued and came out four from a for my
[1:02:31] thousands thousand thousands ministered
[1:02:33] unto him in ten thousand times ten
[1:02:36] thousand stood before the judgment was
[1:02:38] set and the books were open there are
[1:02:40] those same books we just read about amen
[1:02:43] and we know they're judge by their works
[1:02:46] praise God okay now let's go the next
[1:02:50] point that's the first point
[1:02:51] God separates people how about this why
[1:02:54] do the righteous or foolish virgin why
[1:02:57] do they must appear at the white throne
[1:02:59] and why they're given eternal life we

[1:05:56] they shall be priests of God and of
[1:05:57] Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:05:59] thousand years so that's the first
[1:06:01] resurrection all the Holy Ghost field
[1:06:04] Saints live during the thousand years
[1:06:06] the millennium after that all that in
[1:06:08] the graves are raised up now the next
[1:06:12] verse this will be the last one we read
[1:06:14] before we go to that next point go to
[1:06:15] Philippians 3:11 you probably haven't
[1:06:17] read this one ment lately unless you
[1:06:19] were in the church age book Philippians
[1:06:22] 3:11
[1:06:31] how many are doing everything they can
[1:06:33] do to go in the rapture how many are
[1:06:34] doing that tonight that's what Paul's
[1:06:37] saying right here he's gonna do
[1:06:39] everything he possibly can do to be in
[1:06:41] the resurrection hallelujah
[1:06:44] I'm Church honestly most people are
[1:06:46] gonna be guilty of not doing enough
[1:06:48] right they didn't do enough like the
[1:06:50] foolish virgin she didn't do enough she
[1:06:53] didn't bring enough oil right and they
[1:06:55] said go get some you should've went got
[1:06:57] some before see we got to be guilty of
[1:06:59] doing a lot we got to make our calling
[1:07:03] election sure praise God because the
[1:07:04] foolish version is gonna be guilty of
[1:07:06] not doing something they should have
[1:07:07] done now listen they lived all the word
[1:07:11] that they knew except the Holy Ghost
[1:07:13] word that's something we got to clarify
[1:07:15] when we don't think Sunday I'll preach a
[1:07:17] little bit more on the Fujin and the
[1:07:18] wise virgin for the RAM said the foolish
[1:07:20] virgin lives all the word that they know
[1:07:22] except the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:26] because they knew about it right the
[1:07:28] foolish virgin knew oh I should have had
[1:07:29] more oil I'm gonna go out and get some
[1:07:31] oil real quick right because that's what
[1:07:33] the white wise virgins said so they
[1:07:35] lived all that they knew under
[1:07:37] sanctification but they didn't live what
[1:07:39] they heard about the Holy Ghost is that
[1:07:41] true so see that's something we got to
[1:07:43] keep in mind - foolish virgin lives all
[1:07:46] of the justification all sanctification
[1:07:48] but they don't get born again they don't
[1:07:50] have the power that they ought to have
[1:07:51] amen now Philippians 3:11 here's a
[1:07:54] mighty man of when we say oh I shouldn't
[1:07:56] exalt the man but here's a wonderful man
[1:07:58] of God an obedient man of God and look
[1:08:00] what he says in verse 11 if by any means
[1:08:03] I might attain in the resurrection of
[1:08:05] the dead now program brings us out in
[1:08:08] the church edging he said why would Paul
[1:08:10] say if there was only one resurrection
[1:08:12] and that was the white throne why would
[1:08:14] Paul say if by any means
[1:08:15] he said because everybody's already
[1:08:18] going to be called to that resurrection
[1:08:19] he's talking about the first
[1:08:21] resurrection eighty men if by any means
[1:08:24] I can go on the rapture
[1:08:26] I'm gonna try to go in the rapture amen
[1:08:28] you see that if by any means I'm trying
[1:08:32] to get to the first resurrection I don't
[1:08:34] want to be in the second resurrection I
[1:08:36] already want to be resurrected by that
[1:08:37] time hey I already want to be living a
[1:08:39] thousand years during that time huh
[1:08:42] yeah amen glory now how about this one
[1:08:46] the souls under the altar also receive
[1:08:48] eternal life or white robes at the white
[1:08:50] throne judgement anybody need to go over
[1:08:52] that one that's the Jews right here
[1:08:55] brother Branham said the Jews and the
[1:08:57] foolish virgin get their white robes
[1:09:01] judgment because that's when they're
[1:09:03] either given eternal life or that's when
[1:09:06] their caste and like a fire does anybody
[1:09:09] need to read that by God's grace okay
[1:09:12] let's just read this one right here
[1:09:13] let's just read revelation 6:9 brother
[1:09:16] Branham said the white robes equal
[1:09:18] eternal life that's what white robes
[1:09:20] symbolized is eternal life revelation 6
[1:09:23] 9 through 11 I think that'd be the best
[1:09:27] one to see because other ones I can
[1:09:31] quote in just a minute
[1:09:32] Revelation 6:9 11 brother Adam you wanna
[1:09:35] read for us a little bit tonight
[1:09:37] thank you sir can you read 9 and 10 then
[1:09:39] I'll read 11 hey men look what are they
[1:10:05] crying out for Church vengeance but God
[1:10:08] said don't cry out for vengeance he said
[1:10:10] Ben used his mind saith the Lord and
[1:10:11] here this scripture right here is when
[1:10:14] Stephen said father let he said Jesus
[1:10:16] lay it not to their charge when he's
[1:10:17] getting stoned in this scripture Luke
[1:10:19] 23:34
[1:10:20] was when Jesus said Father forgive them
[1:10:22] they don't know what they're doing we
[1:10:23] looked at that last week so see this
[1:10:26] proves these Jews are not born again and
[1:10:28] when you say Lord
[1:10:29] oh I hope these people go to hell that
[1:10:32] proves you don't have eternal life
[1:10:33] right you say God have mercy on them
[1:10:36] they've sinned against me please forgive
[1:10:39] them that shows you got something inside
[1:10:40] of you amen
[1:10:41] you've got eternal life well this
[1:10:43] preacher did this or this sister did
[1:10:45] that forgive them because that's what
[1:10:47] eternal life will do it's exactly right
[1:10:49] so white robes is immerse 11 revelation
[1:10:53] 6 11
[1:10:54] and white robes were given unto every
[1:10:56] one of them and it was said unto them
[1:10:58] that they should rest yet for a little
[1:10:59] season until their fellow-servants also
[1:11:01] and their brethren that should be killed
[1:11:04] as they were should be fulfilled so
[1:11:05] that's the Jews right they said let
[1:11:08] Jesus blood be upon us and our children
[1:11:09] so that number of martyrs has to be
[1:11:12] fulfilled and then they're given white
[1:11:15] robes at the white throne judgment
[1:11:16] that's eternal life okay
[1:11:21] then brother Branham goes through a
[1:11:23] review of the three kinds of believers
[1:11:24] and the fourth class or it's also called
[1:11:27] the second kind of believer and here's
[1:11:30] their quick review you have everybody's
[1:11:32] either saved or lost the saved are
[1:11:35] believers the lost or make believers and
[1:11:37] unbelievers and here's the fourth class
[1:11:39] brother Branham said you have a wise
[1:11:41] virgin and a foolish virgin you have a
[1:11:43] make believer and an unbeliever and
[1:11:45] brother BAM reviews all this and then he
[1:11:48] says the wise virgins names cannot be
[1:11:51] removed off the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:11:53] he said the righteous their names remain
[1:11:56] on the book of life he said the make
[1:11:58] believer has their names removed and
[1:12:00] then he said the unbeliever their names
[1:12:02] were never written on the book of life
[1:12:04] he said but there is some record
[1:12:06] somewhere of them because they lived but
[1:12:08] not on the records of life as far as
[1:12:11] trusting in God for salvation is that
[1:12:14] helped by God's grace that helped names
[1:12:17] cannot be removed names remain on the
[1:12:18] book of life names removed and names
[1:12:21] were never on the book of life they
[1:12:22] never claimed to have life but these
[1:12:24] like Judas they claimed to have life oh
[1:12:26] yeah I'm I'm an apostle I cast out
[1:12:29] devils I do all these things but yet he
[1:12:31] turned and sold Christ away right amen
[1:12:36] all right November in our day but man
[1:12:38] lists these those who worship the Pope
[1:12:40] those who worship the ecumenical move
[1:12:42] their names were never on the book to
[1:12:44] begin with that's what the Bible said
[1:12:46] their names were never on the book even
[1:12:49] though they went to church Bible said
[1:12:50] their names were not written on the book
[1:12:52] of life before the foundation of the
[1:12:54] world all right now I just want to read
[1:12:57] a couple of these the next point the
[1:12:59] program says the sovereignty of God and
[1:13:03] how he can do what he pleases with his
[1:13:06] own creation
[1:13:08] so God can do whatever he wants with the
[1:13:10] foolish virgin I can do whatever he
[1:13:11] wants with the make believer or the
[1:13:13] unbeliever let's read a few of those uh
[1:13:16] brother Adam will you get that one
[1:13:18] proverbs 16:4 Malachi you get job 2130
[1:13:22] these were some really good scriptures
[1:13:24] in there I thought might be helpful I'm
[1:13:26] gonna read Romans 14 7 through 9
[1:13:31] his brother Adam said oh you might read
[1:13:33] this and think that's unfair you know
[1:13:35] how can God remove names and and all
[1:13:37] these things and brother branham brings
[1:13:39] out the scripture that shows that God
[1:13:40] because of his foreknowledge he knows
[1:13:43] what they choose and so because of that
[1:13:45] he can do whatever he wants with them
[1:13:46] because he made them and he knows
[1:13:48] whether they're a vessel of honor or
[1:13:50] vessel of dishonor alright
[1:13:53] so Romans 14 7 through 9 I'm gonna pull
[1:13:56] that up here real quick Church if you're
[1:14:00] a vessel of Honor we ought to rejoice
[1:14:02] tonight amen
[1:14:03] God's using me to honor his name
[1:14:05] hallelujah 14 7 through 9 now for none
[1:14:10] of us liveth to himself and no man dieth
[1:14:12] to himself so whether you live or die
[1:14:15] eternal life or separation you belong to
[1:14:18] Christ for whether we live whether we
[1:14:21] live unto the Lord whether we die we die
[1:14:23] unto the Lord whether we live therefore
[1:14:25] or die we are the Lord's for to this and
[1:14:29] Christ both died and rose and revived
[1:14:31] that he might be Lord both of the Dead
[1:14:34] amen so whichever side you're on saved
[1:14:38] or lost you're still belong to Christ
[1:14:41] amen you're his possession okay for the
[1:14:44] Adam read proverbs 16:4 please sir amen
[1:14:54] God made the wicked people for the day
[1:14:56] of evil right and we're gonna get to
[1:14:59] that next it's the people that are
[1:15:01] burned in this in the lake of fire God
[1:15:03] made them for that he knew for knew what
[1:15:06] they decide so he their vessels of
[1:15:09] dishonor
[1:15:09] okay next Malachi job 2130
[1:15:19] amen they're reserved into that they're
[1:15:22] ordained to that that's their destiny
[1:15:24] that's why people that's why I seen on
[1:15:26] the Emmys a few years ago they had all
[1:15:28] these famous people I forget some of
[1:15:29] their names but they're all singing
[1:15:31] highway to hell we're on the highway to
[1:15:32] hell and they're rockin and rollin to a
[1:15:35] CD with Church many of those people
[1:15:36] that's exactly where they're going they
[1:15:39] were made for that but you and I that
[1:15:41] makes us sad you and I that makes us
[1:15:43] pity them you and I we cry I'm on the
[1:15:46] highway to heaven amen and none can walk
[1:15:48] up there but the pure in heart amen
[1:15:51] that's why they put devil hats all when
[1:15:53] they sing that and do all kinds of evil
[1:15:55] stuff like that because that's where
[1:15:57] they're going that's what they're made
[1:15:58] for
[1:15:59] they're children of Satan but we're
[1:16:00] children of Christ amen
[1:16:02] so we sing about heaven so we sing about
[1:16:04] Jesus and nothing will deter us nothing
[1:16:07] will pull us away
[1:16:08] nothing can remove our names from God's
[1:16:10] book amen because we are God's seed
[1:16:12] hallelujah so see all those scriptures
[1:16:15] prove that God sovereign I know what
[1:16:18] they're gonna choose I can make him to
[1:16:19] honor I can make him or her to dishonor
[1:16:21] her to honor he does that it's his
[1:16:23] choice it says Prag ative all right next
[1:16:27] the church age is like it on the wheat
[1:16:29] plant as we are the wheat seed of
[1:16:31] Abraham that we would be gathered in a
[1:16:32] Christ garner does anybody need to read
[1:16:36] those the Bible said if we're believers
[1:16:38] in Christ were Abraham's seed okay and
[1:16:41] then John the Baptist said Christ is
[1:16:43] going to gather his wheat into his
[1:16:44] garner the wheat seed right the seed the
[1:16:47] believer hallelujah now brother Branham
[1:16:50] said the history or record of this wheat
[1:16:53] plant is the book of life which is a
[1:16:55] part of a book I'm sorry is the book of
[1:16:58] life or of which a part of the book of
[1:17:00] life is the record of eternal life
[1:17:02] that's quite a deep statement so let me
[1:17:04] show you a picture I just pulled this
[1:17:05] off the internet here so you have a
[1:17:08] wheat plant
[1:17:08] all right brother Bram said the blade
[1:17:11] right here the stalk you get a stalk I
[1:17:14] imagine this is the stock imagine tassel
[1:17:19] maybe that the husk would be what's
[1:17:22] around the seed and that I'm sorry the
[1:17:24] chaff is around the seed the Huskers are
[1:17:26] or the chaff well Bram said all that is
[1:17:29] the church
[1:17:30] so all this is just the people that call
[1:17:32] themselves believers all the way up but
[1:17:34] brother Graham said each church group
[1:17:36] protected and contained the believers
[1:17:38] who possess the life of Christ in other
[1:17:41] words the life of that seat right there
[1:17:43] was down here but it was hidden away
[1:17:45] praise God that that church group
[1:17:48] protected it as a church grew on and on
[1:17:50] the life kept moving amen and brother
[1:17:52] Branham compares us like the Ephesus and
[1:17:54] and you know in Samara and all the way
[1:17:56] up and then now it's layer to SIA
[1:17:58] we're supposed to be seed time amen but
[1:18:01] all these ages protected that life the
[1:18:04] same life that's in that seed does that
[1:18:06] help by God's grace but Ram said think
[1:18:09] of the book of life as a wheat plant he
[1:18:11] said that's what you think of it so part
[1:18:14] of this is let's say you take the seeds
[1:18:17] out here what you can do with the rest
[1:18:18] of it well Graham so you're gonna burn
[1:18:19] the rest of it right right some of it
[1:18:23] might be saved you know but we're
[1:18:24] definitely say the seed okay and then
[1:18:27] the rest of its gonna be burned with
[1:18:28] Ramson that's what you do with it
[1:18:30] and he said that's what is it the book
[1:18:32] of life there's a part of the book of
[1:18:33] life
[1:18:34] that's the Lamb's Book of Life that's
[1:18:35] the seed part amen let's read quote so
[1:18:38] I'll have the quotes here for you if I'm
[1:18:40] not making sense then this has to make
[1:18:42] sense and brother Branham said if I
[1:18:44] don't make sense then the Holy Spirit
[1:18:45] will make sense for you praise God
[1:18:47] because I don't have the education and
[1:18:49] do it or I'm not smart enough to do it
[1:18:50] that's the Holy Spirit reveal it to your
[1:18:52] heart Jesus Christ died he gave his life
[1:18:55] that life was to come back up on the
[1:18:58] church and bring many sons like on
[1:18:59] himself under glory in the resurrection
[1:19:02] but as the wheat seed had to have a
[1:19:04] carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat
[1:19:07] seed even so there had to be a church
[1:19:09] which would be the carrier of the life
[1:19:12] of Christ amen let me just say like this
[1:19:15] can I just apply it to my life the
[1:19:17] Assembly of God denomination brother
[1:19:19] Adam was a carrier for the life that was
[1:19:21] in me amen
[1:19:24] Jose what church were you in before the
[1:19:26] message any church okay great - the
[1:19:28] message okay it was anybody in the
[1:19:30] denomination I know whose sister beau
[1:19:32] was the Christian Missionary Alliance
[1:19:34] was a carrier of the life that was in
[1:19:37] the yang family amen are you with me
[1:19:39] that that church protected that life
[1:19:42] until the lie
[1:19:43] hit that part and then when that life at
[1:19:47] that part and the light at that part
[1:19:48] the life of the seed came forth praise
[1:19:51] God that's what happened to Simon and
[1:19:53] cam and I hallelujah and sister Betsy
[1:19:55] we're the life was just carried by that
[1:19:58] denomination and then the light shone
[1:20:00] and here come the believers amen
[1:20:02] and so the Prophet said the church was
[1:20:05] just the carrier the denomination just
[1:20:07] carried the life and that's why I'm glad
[1:20:09] they pray for me that's why I'm glad
[1:20:11] they they gave food to me I so I'm glad
[1:20:13] they paid for our bills and clothes us
[1:20:15] when we didn't have clothes thank God
[1:20:17] for the carrier amen Graham said as the
[1:20:20] blade stocked a stone husk were the
[1:20:22] carriers for the seed but not the seed
[1:20:25] itself so the church corporate through
[1:20:28] the ages has been the carrier of the
[1:20:31] true seed though not the seed itself
[1:20:36] that is why we can say that the book of
[1:20:38] life is the whole wheat plant all right
[1:20:42] so I'm going to show that picture again
[1:20:43] a little bit smaller I had some more
[1:20:45] words at the bottom so brother have said
[1:20:48] a Bible example of this is Israel
[1:20:50] leaving Egypt they all ate drank and
[1:20:54] we're baptized and saw the cloud this
[1:20:56] plant enjoyed all the blessings right of
[1:20:59] the rain enjoyed all the blessings
[1:21:01] enjoyed all the all the hot Sun it sat
[1:21:04] in the laying the Friends of the Sun
[1:21:05] right it drank all my was baptized when
[1:21:08] I had a big rain right but all but a
[1:21:12] tiny minority had their names blotted
[1:21:14] out of the book of life for the Bram
[1:21:16] said the group protected the life praise
[1:21:21] God
[1:21:22] now the Prophet said we have the very
[1:21:27] same thing today in the church names are
[1:21:30] going to be blotted out of the book of
[1:21:31] life no names though will be bought it
[1:21:33] out of the book of eternal life for that
[1:21:35] is another record though contained in
[1:21:37] the Book of Life that's quite a
[1:21:39] statement I don't care I fully can't
[1:21:40] explain that church like I said in
[1:21:42] church let me just say like this the
[1:21:44] book of life to me right now is the
[1:21:46] deepest doctrine that I've ever studied
[1:21:48] now that's just for right now it used to
[1:21:51] be the seven thunders but when I saw the
[1:21:53] quotes on the seven thunders
[1:21:54] to me it wasn't deep anymore to me it's
[1:21:57] seven thunders were the seven times
[1:21:59] brother branham breached with thus saith
[1:22:01] the Lord the seven seals like to me
[1:22:02] that's pretty mean it's pretty simple to
[1:22:05] Revelation to see that I guess God just
[1:22:06] dropped in my heart but one of the most
[1:22:09] deepest doctrines of all to me is the
[1:22:13] book of life because I can't quite fully
[1:22:15] understand everything but do I believe
[1:22:17] it you bet you I believe it was all my
[1:22:20] heart amen
[1:22:21] I can't explain everything but I do
[1:22:23] believe it's right this is the record
[1:22:26] God has given us eternal life and this
[1:22:28] life is in his son he that hath the son
[1:22:30] hath life eternal and he that hath not
[1:22:32] the son hath not life eternal and that's
[1:22:35] first John 5:11 and those who have that
[1:22:39] life were in him before the foundation
[1:22:40] of the world Ephesians 1:4 they were
[1:22:42] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:22:44] the world amen
[1:22:45] Brandon said that great royal see Jesus
[1:22:48] Christ was planted he died and that life
[1:22:52] that was in him came up through the
[1:22:53] wheat plant and is reproducing itself in
[1:22:56] multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[1:22:58] same life in them and being like the
[1:23:00] original because by spirit they are
[1:23:03] original amen hallelujah honey I've got
[1:23:07] the original spirit that fell on the day
[1:23:09] of Pentecost amen you have that
[1:23:11] hallelujah if you have that then you
[1:23:13] love the Word of God because after they
[1:23:16] got it the Bible said they didn't stop
[1:23:18] fellowshipping with all the Apostles
[1:23:20] they kept breaking bread having
[1:23:21] communion they kept here in the Word of
[1:23:23] God why because they loved the Word of
[1:23:24] God they're a part of the Word of God
[1:23:26] they're a part of Christ amen that's
[1:23:29] what this wheat plant was amen it
[1:23:31] carried the seed now we can see why the
[1:23:35] redeemed now it's all about the foods
[1:23:36] virgin bought back by the original owner
[1:23:38] I'm sorry she's sorry talking about the
[1:23:40] bride I'm sorry why the redeemed bride
[1:23:42] I'm sorry I thought he was gonna say
[1:23:44] redeemed foolish virgin now we can see
[1:23:47] why the redeemed bride she was in the
[1:23:49] meze he was in Adam cannot ever have her
[1:23:51] member names taken off the record she's
[1:23:54] part of him she's in the throne she can
[1:23:56] never be judged everyone in the bride is
[1:23:59] a member of him and he loses none but
[1:24:02] that is not so concerning the all in the
[1:24:04] book of life for amongst them are even
[1:24:06] those like Judas etc who have a part in
[1:24:10] the record
[1:24:10] but their names are removed at one time
[1:24:13] his name was there but it had to be
[1:24:15] blotted out because of idolatry remember
[1:24:18] that he idolized money so God removed
[1:24:20] his name on the book of life now I'm
[1:24:23] coming up to something that I don't know
[1:24:25] if you remember this but in yellow we'll
[1:24:26] get to that in just a minute we can see
[1:24:28] those who come in the last days that are
[1:24:30] after having done wonderful works Jesus
[1:24:32] will say that they never knew that
[1:24:33] member that Matthew 7:21 it is not that
[1:24:37] he was not aware of them his omniscience
[1:24:39] precludes that but they were not for
[1:24:42] known as in the bride and neither were
[1:24:45] they for known as amongst the righteous
[1:24:47] of the second resurrection now here's
[1:24:48] where we're good to they bore no fruit
[1:24:52] so let me stop right there
[1:24:54] those who did miracles and cast out
[1:24:56] devils and spoke in tongues and
[1:24:58] prophesied that was not fruit of the
[1:25:01] Spirit are you with me that was gifts of
[1:25:04] the Spirit do you understand that but
[1:25:06] Graham said they bore no fruit yet they
[1:25:09] did miracles so see miracles are not
[1:25:11] fruit fruit is fruit simple statement
[1:25:15] miracles are not fruit fruit is love
[1:25:19] long-suffering patience godliness
[1:25:23] temperance right brotherly kindness all
[1:25:25] these things we'll get to that in just a
[1:25:26] minute see miracles are not fruit
[1:25:30] he said because they were outside the
[1:25:32] word they didn't abide in the word and
[1:25:35] they therefore were sentenced to death
[1:25:38] see they would just take the rain they'd
[1:25:40] shout and they they do miracles all
[1:25:42] these things but they wouldn't live in
[1:25:43] the word they wouldn't lay in the word
[1:25:45] so the word could actually produce
[1:25:47] something in their lives they just
[1:25:49] wanted to produce miracles they want to
[1:25:51] produce fruit praise God
[1:25:52] look at that that's striking to me
[1:25:54] church that's striking they had miracles
[1:25:57] but miracles are not the same as fruit
[1:25:59] of the Spirit and listen I'll say like
[1:26:02] this they're not as important what would
[1:26:04] you have miracles and go to hell or
[1:26:06] fruit and go to heaven pretty simple
[1:26:08] answer to me I rather have the fruit
[1:26:10] praise God you see this is what we're
[1:26:13] taught then as we have previously shown
[1:26:15] there are those who stood for the bride
[1:26:17] and were an aid and comfort to her those
[1:26:22] had their names remaining on the book of
[1:26:24] and go into life everlasting that's the
[1:26:26] foolish version finally there are those
[1:26:27] such as Pharaoh who never had their
[1:26:29] names in the book of life and their
[1:26:30] caste and they could fire now I want to
[1:26:32] make a note here I may want to teach
[1:26:35] more on the fruit of the Spirit cuz I
[1:26:36] Lee preached one sermon on it was it two
[1:26:38] years ago last year I think was last
[1:26:41] year because this in church the fruit of
[1:26:44] the Spirit is part of the evidence of
[1:26:46] being filled with the Holy Ghost I said
[1:26:47] part on purpose and that's because the
[1:26:51] fruit of the Spirit is part of the
[1:26:52] evidence of being filled only goes
[1:26:53] because the evidence is being in the
[1:26:55] word all the way right and the fruit of
[1:26:58] spirit is just part of the word for our
[1:27:01] day now get your Bibles handy I got what
[1:27:05] I got ten more minutes
[1:27:06] can bear with me 15 more minutes bear
[1:27:08] with me here I just made this today at
[1:27:11] work I thought you know maybe I'll I'll
[1:27:13] help the church with this now well first
[1:27:15] thing I want you to notice I put three
[1:27:16] question marks I don't have this fully
[1:27:18] studied out but at least that know this
[1:27:22] and at least know the quotes that we've
[1:27:24] just read so I'm trying to take the
[1:27:26] quotes I just read and then apply them
[1:27:28] to all these scriptures hello here the
[1:27:32] wise version has all the fruits of the
[1:27:34] spirit
[1:27:35] now the foolish virgin at least now this
[1:27:38] is the part understand at least in Jesus
[1:27:40] parable they don't bring forth any fruit
[1:27:42] of the Spirit which would make sense
[1:27:44] because they're not born again right
[1:27:47] they don't have the original seeds not
[1:27:48] quit the Seas not quickened if you leave
[1:27:51] a seat on your shelf and don't put in
[1:27:53] the ground you're never gonna get fruit
[1:27:54] because the seeds got to be quickened
[1:27:56] right so foolish version have seed
[1:27:59] inside their souls but it's not
[1:28:00] quickened that's why I can see it
[1:28:02] because remember Jesus said I for knew
[1:28:04] you and I prepared this for you from the
[1:28:07] foundation in the world we just read
[1:28:08] that tonight are you with me Jesus for
[1:28:11] knew they're gonna be saved they must
[1:28:13] have a seat inside of them but it's not
[1:28:14] quickened by the Holy Ghost because
[1:28:17] Jesus prepares the kingdom for the
[1:28:19] foolish virgin all right I'm just I'm
[1:28:21] just telling red letter words okay all
[1:28:24] right let's see that's why I don't quite
[1:28:26] fully understand that what does that
[1:28:27] mean now here's the part I really don't
[1:28:28] understand because the make believer is
[1:28:30] gonna be lost and the Bible said their
[1:28:32] fruit is withered so that's that's a
[1:28:36] hard part I don't understand
[1:28:39] which is also called Krupp true and
[1:28:40] we'll read these Churchill reading so
[1:28:42] you can you can see exactly what I'm
[1:28:43] talking about that's why I don't quite
[1:28:44] fully understand this how can they have
[1:28:46] corrupt fruit but these guys have no
[1:28:48] fruit that I understand that I
[1:28:52] understand unless you're just looking at
[1:28:54] this seed right because this would be a
[1:28:55] this would be a evil seed this would be
[1:28:56] a seed of Satan because Judas was a son
[1:28:58] of perdition he was a son of Satan so
[1:29:01] they just had the wrong seat these must
[1:29:02] have the right seed but no fruit when
[1:29:05] all the fruit and these must have the
[1:29:06] wrong seat and bring forth corrupt fruit
[1:29:08] it just came to me right now so I hope
[1:29:11] that's the Lord here tonight and now the
[1:29:13] unbeliever
[1:29:14] I don't know do the Hat I don't know I
[1:29:15] don't think they could have even any
[1:29:17] fruit so let's read that ok let's go
[1:29:20] here let's see what you and I need to
[1:29:21] have how many how many one have all the
[1:29:22] fruits of the spirit there's nine of
[1:29:24] them so Church we got nine things we
[1:29:27] should be searching for tonight I know I
[1:29:29] am praise God that's like on the church
[1:29:31] I pray on the mum in the morning in my
[1:29:33] prayer closet every morning and read my
[1:29:35] Bible every morning I can by God's grace
[1:29:37] I want to see the fruits of God because
[1:29:41] only the bride has the fruit of God only
[1:29:44] the bride the foolish virgin choked out
[1:29:47] there's no fruit jesus said so glacials
[1:29:51] 5:22 all right but the fruit of Spirit
[1:29:54] is love joy that's what we need today
[1:29:59] how many oh how we love the joy of the
[1:30:01] Lord in the presence of God is fullness
[1:30:04] of joy if people don't have joy it's
[1:30:07] because they haven't been in God's
[1:30:08] presence was it Sunday just a time of
[1:30:12] joy with brother Brooks and and all the
[1:30:13] saints boy just a time of joy hallelujah
[1:30:16] see but that's a fruit you have to have
[1:30:19] that it takes time to be born again and
[1:30:22] you got to say with it so you gotta stay
[1:30:24] in the word and then you produce joy in
[1:30:26] its season love joy now what about love
[1:30:31] can you love people that's I call you a
[1:30:33] Holy Roller can you love people that
[1:30:35] hate you can you love people that say
[1:30:38] well you're just off preacher I disagree
[1:30:41] with you preacher and you're you're the
[1:30:43] most this and this than that can you
[1:30:45] still love those people yeah God will
[1:30:48] test you if you say yes then he's gonna
[1:30:50] test you
[1:30:51] like he has me and everybody else right
[1:30:54] love joy peace got peace like a river in
[1:30:57] the midst of all this trials you still
[1:31:00] have peace in your soul I'm not fighting
[1:31:02] a war against God I've got peace with
[1:31:04] God
[1:31:04] alright next longsuffering can you wait
[1:31:08] and have patience with somebody even
[1:31:10] when they're wrong
[1:31:11] can you suffer with them a long time are
[1:31:13] you gentle now there's times Jesus
[1:31:16] wasn't gentle we don't we know that
[1:31:18] but gentleness is a fruit of the Spirit
[1:31:21] Jesus was gentle with many people though
[1:31:24] right especially on the cross he said
[1:31:25] Father forgive them they don't know what
[1:31:27] they're doing that's gentle if I ever
[1:31:29] saw gentle that's gentle Stephen father
[1:31:32] laid out to their charge right as the
[1:31:33] stone is coming to hit his head father
[1:31:36] don't lay it to their charge that's
[1:31:38] gentleness of the Holy Ghost right there
[1:31:40] now look goodness now I don't study on
[1:31:43] that too much but you got to be good
[1:31:45] ever studied on that one
[1:31:47] faith hallelujah you have revelation in
[1:31:50] your heart amen that's a fruit of this
[1:31:52] spirit I got the revelation meekness the
[1:31:55] member' meekness is putting yourself
[1:31:56] last meekness is realizing you're
[1:31:59] nothing and Christ is Christ has
[1:32:01] preeminence and everything that's me
[1:32:03] realizing I'm nothing he's everything
[1:32:06] temperance is self-control right that's
[1:32:08] also in the statue perfect man but
[1:32:10] there's another level when you get born
[1:32:12] again of controlling your fleshly
[1:32:14] passions that's what the Greek says
[1:32:16] cause it passions of the lusts of the
[1:32:18] flesh against such there's no law now
[1:32:23] who do you know church no no don't say
[1:32:25] it out loud who do you know that
[1:32:27] manifests those fruits of the spirit
[1:32:28] that's somebody you want to follow amen
[1:32:30] that's somebody you want to follow on
[1:32:32] Facebook or Instagram if they're not on
[1:32:35] Instagram that's somebody you want to
[1:32:36] watch their life and see how do they
[1:32:38] live their life because they have all
[1:32:41] nine and seasons on seasons you see the
[1:32:45] nine fruits of the spirit of their life
[1:32:47] that's the kind of person you want to
[1:32:49] model your life after because it takes
[1:32:51] the Holy Ghost to do that and remember
[1:32:53] very few Jesus had few there be that
[1:32:55] find this road and this road even right
[1:32:58] few be saved Jesus said okay now mark
[1:33:01] let's go to mark 4:8
[1:33:05] I might do it on time okay I got ten
[1:33:06] minutes all right bear with me I just
[1:33:11] want to be humble that's why I put those
[1:33:12] question marks on there I honestly don't
[1:33:14] have it all figured out other than like
[1:33:17] I just said these are of course
[1:33:18] different seeds this would have to be
[1:33:20] the true seed of God because God for
[1:33:22] knew they'd be saved and that just kind
[1:33:24] of came to me today like I said I
[1:33:26] haven't put as much time into studying
[1:33:27] that as I like to but I think that's
[1:33:30] right that's my thought that just came
[1:33:32] to me okay mark for seven I'm sorry for
[1:33:35] eight we can read worried both but let's
[1:33:38] start with verse eight okay it's the
[1:33:41] parable the force foregrounds seeds
[1:33:43] fought on four types of grounds verse a
[1:33:48] and other fell on good ground and did
[1:33:49] yield fruit that sprang up and increase
[1:33:51] and brought forth some thirty and sixty
[1:33:54] and some hundred thirty times the fruit
[1:33:58] 60 times the fruit a hundred times the
[1:34:01] fruit oh my what a harvest for Jesus
[1:34:04] amen
[1:34:05] I want to see my life bring forth thirty
[1:34:07] fold I want to see my life bring 460
[1:34:10] hundredfold I want to see fruit in my
[1:34:12] life praise God I want to be able to see
[1:34:14] mine it's five years after I preached
[1:34:16] that sermon I want to see I got more
[1:34:18] long-suffering now I've got more joy now
[1:34:21] hallelujah I've got more faith now amen
[1:34:23] fruits of the Holy Spirit
[1:34:25] look at verse seven now here's what I
[1:34:27] said the foolish virgin she Hearst is
[1:34:32] her her see we say their seed their
[1:34:34] plant is choked and so they get no fruit
[1:34:37] of the Holy Spirit that's what the Bible
[1:34:39] says mark 4 7 let's read it together
[1:34:44] ready one two three and some fell among
[1:34:47] thorns and the thorns grew up and choked
[1:34:50] it and it yielded what no fruit so they
[1:34:54] have the right seed but they don't have
[1:34:58] any fruit they don't really love like
[1:35:00] Christ loved right they don't really
[1:35:04] have goodness like Christ had goodness
[1:35:06] they're not really as temperate as
[1:35:08] Christ was you see there has to be a
[1:35:11] difference so what's the difference the
[1:35:13] fruit was the difference the fruit was
[1:35:16] the difference between the wise virgin
[1:35:17] and the food
[1:35:18] lish the wise had all the fruit 3060
[1:35:21] hundred the foolish had no fruit of the
[1:35:23] Holy Spirit see why it's important to
[1:35:26] really believe in the fruits of the
[1:35:27] spirit I know there's a couple quotes
[1:35:29] people misunderstand but we'll have to
[1:35:31] go through that again I appreciate last
[1:35:33] year like I said we went through the
[1:35:34] whole quotes and I don't I don't really
[1:35:38] wanna get that tonight now make believer
[1:35:40] now here's where I said here's a little
[1:35:41] bit of a sticker brand called a stickler
[1:35:43] I think he called it which is like I
[1:35:45] said I can't explain all these but
[1:35:46] Matthew 7:15 I just want to be humble
[1:35:50] and keep on learning I want to be honest
[1:35:52] with you brother Ram said he wouldn't
[1:35:53] preach on hell until he understood it
[1:35:55] right he was that humble okay Matthew
[1:35:58] 7:15 I can I can lay these scriptures I
[1:36:03] can understand these scriptures by it
[1:36:04] like I said to explain it especially
[1:36:06] with these right here these two but like
[1:36:10] I said it must be corrupt okay Matthew
[1:36:12] 7:15 now look we're talking about beware
[1:36:14] of what church false prophets so this
[1:36:17] group is false prophets just like Judas
[1:36:18] right they might have had the genuine
[1:36:21] anointing to prophesy but then their
[1:36:22] souls were false they were not believers
[1:36:25] they were unbelievers right they were
[1:36:28] pretenders beware of false prophets
[1:36:31] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[1:36:32] but inwardly of their ravening wolves
[1:36:34] remember Judas he didn't want Mary to
[1:36:37] wash Jesus feet because he wanted that
[1:36:39] money what was he a wolf he was hungry
[1:36:41] to take their money remember that we've
[1:36:43] reached out last week I think it was it
[1:36:44] two weeks ago yeah I was Mary Mary
[1:36:47] washed Jesus feet and Judas said why
[1:36:49] don't you sell that money give it to the
[1:36:50] poor he was a wolf in sheep's clothing
[1:36:53] trying to eat up that money
[1:36:55] I really wanted that money he was a wolf
[1:36:58] in sheep's clothing
[1:36:59] oh brother just you should have used
[1:37:03] that money on this and you should have
[1:37:04] did this and that now be careful Judas
[1:37:08] one of the money himself
[1:37:11] verse 16 ye shall know them by their
[1:37:15] what fruits I gotta say they have fruit
[1:37:20] but it's the wrong kind of fruit do men
[1:37:24] gather grapes or thorns or figs of
[1:37:26] thistles even so every good tree
[1:37:27] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[1:37:29] tree bringeth forth evil fruit
[1:37:32] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[1:37:36] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[1:37:38] forth good fruit that's that really
[1:37:41] helps right there every tree that brings
[1:37:43] not good fruit is hewn down and cast
[1:37:46] into the fire wherefore by their fruits
[1:37:48] you shall know them
[1:37:50] amen that helped hoping to help now go
[1:37:53] to Jude 112 I think we're gonna end
[1:37:55] there listen we'll end with that by
[1:37:56] God's grace Jude 112 I think I'm at
[1:38:01] about an hour yeah I got five minutes
[1:38:02] left here and I'll save that last few
[1:38:07] paragraphs for Sunday Lord willing we'll
[1:38:09] see the Holy Spirit can always change my
[1:38:10] message he's done that before
[1:38:13] Jude 112
[1:38:17] okay now Kai you want to read that for
[1:38:20] me Jude 112 thank you sir
[1:38:36] okay there you go that's why I put the
[1:38:38] question mark because when I read Jude
[1:38:39] 112 I put it in both places because the
[1:38:42] one place is set of withered fruit and
[1:38:44] one place is said no fruit so this is
[1:38:47] one I'm not quite sure do they have any
[1:38:48] I'm not even sure so that's when I still
[1:38:51] don't know but we can definitely see how
[1:38:53] these are both the right seed once
[1:38:56] quickened brings forth fruit other ones
[1:38:58] choked these would be the wrong seed
[1:39:00] right because they're lost so like I
[1:39:03] said I may want to teach on each
[1:39:04] individual fruit of the Spirit since the
[1:39:06] Prophet said did you know this remember
[1:39:08] this he said we should judge ourselves
[1:39:09] based upon the fruit based upon our
[1:39:12] current fruit that we're producing all
[1:39:17] right let me see how much i'm marga cuz
[1:39:18] i think i got four minutes here yeah
[1:39:20] four minutes okay yeah let's just I got
[1:39:24] three more quotes we can get through
[1:39:25] that four minutes I'm pretty sure yeah
[1:39:26] cuz it's the last part on the wheat
[1:39:27] plant thus the grain of wheat that
[1:39:29] became a plant for the harvest is the
[1:39:31] record of the church and even as not all
[1:39:35] the wheat plant is wheat seed and as not
[1:39:37] all the plant is used in the harvest so
[1:39:40] with the church all the churches not the
[1:39:42] bride and neither is it all given
[1:39:44] eternal life but a part of it is
[1:39:46] gathered in the garner and a part of it
[1:39:48] is kept that it might enter into the
[1:39:51] eternal life in the second resurrection
[1:39:53] and part of it which is accounted chaff
[1:39:56] is burned and like a fire and this is
[1:39:59] exactly what John the Baptist and Jesus
[1:40:00] said for John said the wheat would be
[1:40:03] gathered in the chat burn let's enter
[1:40:04] our feet here Jesus said buying the
[1:40:06] tares then gather the wheat now here it
[1:40:08] is right here
[1:40:09] here's today the ecumenical move will
[1:40:12] bind the tare churches together for the
[1:40:15] tares must be bound first remember that
[1:40:17] Jesus said that's the season our program
[1:40:19] said that's the season when right now is
[1:40:20] the binding of the tares and though
[1:40:23] their end is burning they're not burned
[1:40:25] at their binding but it reserved to
[1:40:27] later date but one of the tares about
[1:40:34] the rapture contains and does sometime
[1:40:38] between the binding and the revelation
[1:40:41] of the Antichrist did you catch that
[1:40:43] clue right there but I just gave us a
[1:40:44] good clue with the rapture you take
[1:40:46] place because jesus said that we cannot
[1:40:50] gathered until the tears are bound in
[1:40:52] the Academical Council so what does that
[1:40:54] mean Church it means we're going to see
[1:40:56] the churches bind themselves together
[1:40:58] before the rapture we don't know
[1:41:01] everything that's going to happen before
[1:41:02] the rapture brother houses go to the
[1:41:04] scripture we are going to see the
[1:41:06] churches by themselves together in a
[1:41:08] tight ecumenical council remember graham
[1:41:11] also said it's the american churches
[1:41:13] that are going to bring on the squeeze
[1:41:15] the american churches then will come the
[1:41:21] day when all stand together as seen in
[1:41:25] Daniel the King will be there with his
[1:41:27] bride to him and in front of it will be
[1:41:30] the multitudes who are to be judged yes
[1:41:32] all over there all the books are open a
[1:41:35] final disposition of all is made the
[1:41:38] harvest is indeed over the books once
[1:41:40] opened are closed let me pause right
[1:41:44] here let's feel where the tears of those
[1:41:47] are me let's go where the tears are
[1:41:50] bound first let's go to Matthew 13 he
[1:41:55] said gather together the tears first
[1:41:57] let's just read taxes you got that okay
[1:41:59] there it is remember Jesus sends out the
[1:42:04] angels and he said of them an enemy have
[1:42:06] done this what planned the tears the
[1:42:09] servant said unto Him wilt thou then
[1:42:10] that we go and gather them up but he
[1:42:12] said nay lest ye gather up the tares ye
[1:42:16] root up also the wheat with them see so
[1:42:20] they had to both had to mature we've got
[1:42:22] the tares mature but while they returned
[1:42:24] you and I are mature what do you mean
[1:42:27] mature with more fruit brother sister
[1:42:29] more fruit by the grace of God more love
[1:42:31] for my enemies right more self-control
[1:42:35] my life I'm not getting more worldly
[1:42:37] insipid back in the world habits I'm
[1:42:39] getting more devotees I can't control my
[1:42:42] passions better now than before I knew
[1:42:46] yeah it's exactly right
[1:42:48] glory he said let all throw together
[1:42:51] until harvest time rapture time if the
[1:42:56] time of harvest I'll say the Reapers
[1:42:58] gather ye together first the tares
[1:43:02] let those tear churches by themselves
[1:43:05] together in a world economical council
[1:43:07] member Rick Warren shouldn't call his
[1:43:09] name but forgive me
[1:43:10] memory said oh look at our Pope he's
[1:43:14] claiming the Pope is his spoke about you
[1:43:16] but he's not Mike ok ahem
[1:43:18] whoever's Pope he is is going to bind
[1:43:21] them together in the ecumenical council
[1:43:23] and they're gonna find themselves
[1:43:24] together first he said and buy them in
[1:43:28] bundles to burn them but gather the
[1:43:30] wheat into my barn praise God and church
[1:43:33] those are not my words those aren't even
[1:43:35] brother branham's words those are Jesus
[1:43:37] Christ by the tares first get them ready
[1:43:43] for the burning right which would be
[1:43:44] Armageddon and also a lake of fire
[1:43:47] I think Armageddon is the actual the
[1:43:50] first burden and then he said then
[1:43:52] you'll gather the we see we've gathered
[1:43:54] the seeds into my bar there's one hour
[1:43:56] right there a perfect time how doesn't
[1:43:57] you thank you though thank you Jesus
[1:43:59] trying to control myself here now this
[1:44:02] is that server from 2012 I'm preaching
[1:44:05] hour and 50 minutes and everybody was
[1:44:08] patient with me that was a great
[1:44:10] reminder that everybody loves me good
[1:44:14] I'll tell ya I was too zealous my wife's
[1:44:16] like yes he used to preach to sermons in
[1:44:17] one sermon and I heard both a name that
[1:44:21] I heard John released the same day the
[1:44:22] bank god bless them
[1:44:24] oh they preach an hour tonight can you
[1:44:27] imagine if I preached 50 more minutes
[1:44:29] and you didn't get out till 9:42 night
[1:44:34] and I'm still preaching I can't do it
[1:44:38] anymore
[1:44:38] God is humbling me God said helping me
[1:44:41] to understand my zeal you know I gotta
[1:44:43] have more wisdom with my zeal but look
[1:44:46] how much these people love and that was
[1:44:48] a great reminder but I need to love you
[1:44:50] too I do but I want to be more mindful I
[1:44:54] want to grow in grace and not anymore
[1:44:57] the see Church I want to grow in grace I
[1:44:59] want to grow and participate how do you
[1:45:01] want more fruit to the stage that's as
[1:45:03] we close let's pray for that let me put
[1:45:05] these scriptures up here sorry you look
[1:45:11] at that list and you look let's look
[1:45:13] long and hard for about 30 seconds
[1:45:15] let's look at this list there's nine
[1:45:17] fruits of the spirit sorry I don't have
[1:45:19] any but you understand to get the fruits
[1:45:22] what you have to do Church crucify your
[1:45:24] flesh that's the only way we've got to
[1:45:29] take things out of our lives if you want
[1:45:31] to be more like Christ man that's why we
[1:45:35] always say like you can't coach as a
[1:45:36] Christian you can't coast and say well
[1:45:38] stop reading my Bible I'll stop
[1:45:39] listening to brother branham I'll stop
[1:45:41] the attendant as many church services
[1:45:42] and I don't want to sound critical but
[1:45:45] there is no other way to bring forth
[1:45:48] fruit then crucify people think I'm
[1:45:53] being you know maybe critical or oh he's
[1:45:55] going down the same thought again but
[1:45:57] don't you see how it all works together
[1:45:59] like this is how you grow as a Christian
[1:46:01] you hear the word you say hey man you
[1:46:03] say hallelujah we water that seed and
[1:46:05] then tomorrow to the right hand of life
[1:46:07] tomorrow you live exactly what was
[1:46:09] preached tonight hey another new year
[1:46:12] that's what you got to do if it becomes
[1:46:16] a foolish life it becomes a life that's
[1:46:19] choked out by the cares of the world and
[1:46:22] then money becomes more important than
[1:46:24] tarnish right then a relationship
[1:46:26] becomes more important than praying and
[1:46:29] pretty soon that seed is choked out and
[1:46:31] it shows people aren't even born again
[1:46:33] to begin with oh it's so important to
[1:46:36] have the fruit of the Holy stream jesus
[1:46:39] said that foolish merchant hasn't no
[1:46:40] none of this fruit I'll be encouraged in
[1:46:44] that just by God's grace that's a good
[1:46:45] list again in your heart let's just take

[1:49:48] subject the book of life and Lord I
[1:49:50] personally believe to me is the deepest
[1:49:52] subject right now that I've studied he
[1:49:54] put twenty pages of the church age book
[1:49:56] about the book of life far more than any
[1:49:59] other subject dear God and Lord he
[1:50:03] brings us down to the end of the chapter
[1:50:04] and it shows that the Bride of Christ
[1:50:07] the wise virgin is the only one with
[1:50:09] real through the spirit Oh God
[1:50:12] then your prophet said we should judge
[1:50:14] our lives by the fruit that would
[1:50:17] presently produce it because that's what
[1:50:19] Jesus said
[1:50:20] a tree is known by its fruit Lord you

[1:52:38] a servant of mind of Christ who made
[1:52:41] himself of no reputation God hope that

[2:00:56] the church to perfection Lord I just
[2:00:59] believe with all my heart I'm sure
[2:01:00] something was said tonight in all these
[2:01:02] scriptures that helped your people Lord
[2:01:05] for their sheep and sheep are fed on a
[2:01:09] sheep food which is the Word of God Lord

[2:01:26] us Lord God maybe abided your word may
[2:01:28] we ever clean closer to the cross when
[2:01:31] we clean closer to the message of the
[2:01:32] hour the Word of God the preaching of
[2:01:34] the word then we clean ever closer then
[2:01:37] we never loosen our grip and start
[2:01:40] reaching room for things of the world
[2:01:42] dear God maybe that never happened may
[2:01:45] we keep the cross so close to us
[2:01:48] brick we see if we keep it close we'll
[2:01:50] see Jesus's blood will remember his
[2:01:53] sacrifice will feel the weight of the
[2:01:55] cross and if Jesus bore across surely we
[2:01:58] can have a burden in this hour we can do
[2:02:01] something for the kingdom of God thank
[2:02:04] you lord
[2:02:05] father bless your saints Lord I'm glad
