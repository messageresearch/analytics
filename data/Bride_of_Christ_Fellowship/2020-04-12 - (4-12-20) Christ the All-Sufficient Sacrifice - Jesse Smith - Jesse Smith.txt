to our memory verse here for the pins 4 7 8 with the ins 4 7 & 8 where my main text will be Hebrews 10 like to preach on price the all-sufficient sacrifice I should have preached on true seal for Easter Steve let's try to keep all my Easter sermon is a good Friday serving all the same documents I can always remember what did I preach before better give us a more larger perspective of what Christ has done praise God Philippians Philippians 4:7 8 let's read that together on three one two three and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things praise God let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 hebrews 10:7 you know I love this time of the year I know we've said it before you know a lot of churches make this a more special week than any week I believe every week is special every week is holy week every season is Lenten season but it is wonderful just to review a lot of these foundational principles and it really reminds me of Christ power praise God and what he's done to my sins praise God they were far away as our brothers were singing it he's taken my sins far away he took them down to hell praise God and then he blotted out all the handwriting just washed it away with the bleach of his blood as we saw last night nailed it to his cross he's got such a beautiful reminder I love this time of year as well hebrews 10:7 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hats pleasure there and which are offered by the law verse 9 then he then said he lo I come to do thy will O God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second let's read verse 10 together on three one two three by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all once for all this all sufficient sacrifice praise God they go down to verse 14 let's read that as well this is what I cling to church when I see my mistakes or I get down and I love to revisit these I can clean to these scriptures right here I only need a one sacrifice and it has forever perfected me for ever forgiving me I'm in the process of it but Jesus sees me as a finished work praise God he's working with me he's helping me to die daily but he sees me he sees you by the blood of Christ as perfect sanctified a finished word praise God verse 14 that's Rita on three one two three four by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified amen let's have one more word of Prayer if ever need on your heartless making no names of God Heavenly Father we love this time we love this holy season every Sundays holy to me I lay on my face O God and cry out to you Lord we do it all the time Lord every days holy but here probably get there remember Lord all that you did through the resurrection in the cross and father we pray God let these truce be Lord more evident to our minds remind us of your all-sufficient sacrifice your resurrection Lord God how you justified us by raising Lord defeating death and hail Lord God bless us today in your divine presence Lord just renew our hearts our God with these truths that we might be better Christians Lord God we're thankful that it only took one sacrifice Lord God to finish all of our sin problem father we give you glory for that and we'll faithfully serve you all the days of our life from this easter on to every one until your coming in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous B&C did praise God praise the Lord so I like to look at Christ the all sufficient sacrifice and just again back to the coronavirus I was just looking again this morning I think a hundred thousand worldwide have died but remember in two thousand nine and ten almost six hundred thousand died from the swine flu before that over a million died in the Hong Kong flu in 1968 and 69 two million in the Asia flu from 1957 and 58 and 50 million in the Spanish flu of 1918 and 1919 and I don't say that to you know make it seem like the world's you know doing anything wrong it's obviously a very awful sickness but we need to keep that in perspective that the church has gone through this before by the blood of Jesus Christ and we'll get through this praise God I've never thought you know I've just never thought that the way some people are approaching it like it's the end of the world or I've just never thought that you know it could it could eventually lead to that but we have to keep these things in perspective and recognize that God is still on his throne he's faithful and it's our duty right now is our brother prayed the prayer crest our duty is to be kings and priests right now were to intercede if no one else is gonna do it will intercede for the sinners praise God hallelujah because we know the power of intercession amen so I do have a few quotes or slides here to share by God's grace let's look to the word this morning and trust the Lord will minister to us here by God's grace so Christ the all sufficient sacrifice I'd wanted to preach on all the sacrifices yesterday but then I just felt inspired to preach on the keys to the kingdom the keys of death and hell rather keys of death and hell and really enjoyed the fellowship last night in the Word of God brother man said Jesus Christ fulfilled every sacrifice when he preached the the red heifer and the waters of separation he said from one side to the other typing everything even the waters of separation the red heifer it couldn't be a brown one had to be a red one not a spot on it had to be burned and then made into the waters of separation he said its to sprinkle the people after they had sinned and gone outside the camp how the hyssop and the cedar wood and all mixed in together how the wood and the tabernacle how the brazen altar the Laver the shewbread everything pointed to Christ and in him we are complete in Jesus Christ praise God we know everything pointed to him so I just want to build up I want to start we're looking at these at these three kinds of sacrifices and then I want to finish with the feasts of the Lord we're just gonna revisit the seven feasts of the Lord it's been a while I think I only preached on actually once a year you know and I just caught the revelation today that I need to add the seven feasts of Israel into the current chapter I'm writing right now it's about the two the two people become one the Jew Gentile become one church because that's what happened at Pentecost and so just has just been refreshing revealed to me this morning and that's where that ties in we saw it last night there was a wall of partition between Jew and Gentile Jesus Christ tore down the wall praise God oddly he tore the veil between man and the holiest of holies praise the Lord and here as we'll see later with the Feast of Pentecost he took all these individual grains and baked them into one body praise God amen so we'll see that here I love God's imagery praise God I love what God has done it's a beautiful picture so let's go to Exodus 29 here by God's grace let's go to Exodus 29 verse 38 let's look at the daily sacrifices remember it was through Abraham that God finally decided there's going to be Jew and Gentile right because everybody was just one people but it was that time of Abraham Abraham God's own separate yourself and I'm gonna make of you a kingdom praised God I'm gonna make of you a family to bless all the other families in the earth so starting with Abraham God now has what we would say a group of separated individuals later through Moses he said I'm making you a kingdom of priests praise God natural praise got natural priests and so God with Abraham started focusing on this particular people they became known as Jews Israel later but but here through Moses God makes a kingdom of priests he develops a priesthood and a tabernacle because he wanted this nation to be a peculiar nation amen a peculiar a special nation unto me praise God because he knew you member he saw at the tower Babel he saw all men were still corrupt even after the flood they're still all corrupt so he said I'll I'll have to just choose one family that can be special unto me that I can reveal myself to that will love me and obey me that will be Abraham's seed praise God amen and now we know of course we're a peculiar people by the blood of Jesus Christ amen thank the Lord so Exodus 29 here 38 to 46 just a little reading I like to just spend one more time reading this morning the scriptures and then it just gives us church a beautiful picture of what Jesus Christ has done I've said it here before I think I'll say it again I'm so thankful I'm under the new tongue of the New Testament praise God can you imagine as we read these you imagine the priests having to kill all these animals and their their hands is covered in blood all the time all the time we know they work seven days at a time right and then they take seven off or whatever sometimes 14 days or 30 days the different times of the Old Testament calendar they'd work different shifts but can you imagine just all the blood it was all blood all the time and then during the feast it was even more blood it was just constantly bloody all the time I remember by the time Isaiah comes around David said I'm tired of your sacrifices and he had that great revelation that he read it real to saw King Saul David he said the Lord not delight so much in blood but the Lord delights in obedience praise God amen his obedience comes from the heart amen and that's why Paul said you've obeyed from your heart the gospel that was preached unto you to Haven that's the beauty of the New Testament it's by the heart the heart now serves God amen as we saw last night in the Old Testament they didn't have the fertile ground did they because they just remember years of the sins and a guilty conscience and it could never purge the conscience but now in the New Testament our conscience can be pure we can smile and rejoice and be happy and have the joy of the Lord because we know God has totally done away with our sins amen it could not be done under the blood of bulls and goats but it is done through Jesus Christ amen so we truly do experience and a spiritual experience that they cannot experience because the blood of animals could never purge their conscience but we can have confidence and know that we're forgiven we're accepted not just on earth amongst each other but we're accepted in the beloved praise God we're accepted in heaven because we sit spiritually our souls sit in spiritual places called heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen hallelujah Exodus 29 38 you know with preaching Friday Saracen I just lost track what day is it I woke up today I don't even know what day it was I'd be like last night we felt like Wednesday every every day just feels the same you preach every day Exodus 29 38 what day is it praise God it's the Lord's Day praise God hallelujah now he says now this is the that which thou shalt offer upon the altar to lambs of the first year day-by-day continually two Lambs every day two Lambs the one lamb that shall offer in the morning and the other lamb thou shall offer it even and with the one lamb a tenth deal flour mingled with the fourth part of a hint of beaten oil and a fourth part of a hint of wine for a drink offering so look you had a a meet offering and then a meal offering right the grain and the flower that was meat that was called a meal offering so God said everyday you have to have a lamb to die and then a bread and then wine praise God I don't know that's that's what we have everyday Bray's God bread and wine praise God we've got to land that dives for us every day are you he's already busy he ever lives to make intercession we have a lamb available to us I'll say like that we have the blood of lamb available you only died once but his blood is available to us every day praise God remember Jesus said to Satan don't touch that oil in wine amen praise God Satan can't touch our experience with God that's what God was showing remember he was prefiguring it here natural wine as we had last night in friday natural oil and flour it was a figure of what we experienced today praise God thank the Lord my goodness verse 41 in the other land thou shall offer even shall do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning in the corn to the drink offering thereof for a sweet savour and offering made by fire unto the Lord so there's fire there's oil there's wine there's lamb there's meat there's bread oh what an experience to have with God every day praise God every day these are the blessings are available to you and I and that beautiful he said I'm just trying to show them something he wanted continual fellowship with them and he wanted them to enjoy it praise God Oh verse 42 this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations mine so burnt that means they didn't eat any of that meat so they guess they just ate the bread right they ate the bread and drink the line here he says continue a burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee praise God and there will I meet with the children Israel in the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory I will sanctify the tabernacle the congregation and the altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons that Minister me to me in the priests office and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God and they shall know that I am the Lord their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell among them I and the Lord their God every morning a lamb died to Oly burnt nothing was left over and they hate they gave a meat offering bread and then wine offering a drink offering every morning praise God and then every evening the same there was wine there's fire there's bread oh it's just it's continual worship unto God every single day they didn't skip any days it was every single day praise God now this is really small let's get past that but see once the consecration of the altar was described it tells us that about the lambs the daily lambs that were going to be offered praise God and he says he's gonna meet with them I like that see he meets with this church when we have the appropriate sacrifices so many people start living a Christian life and they wonder how come I'm not meeting with God anymore are you making the sacrifices right remember Romans 12:1 he said it's your reasonable service present yourselves a living sacrifice unto God that's the reason people get far from God they don't make the continual sacrifices but God said in the Old Testament continue to make these sacrifices and I'll meet with you there praise God amen I'll meet with your daily amen that's right so it has to be a daily sacrifice praise God now let's let's reiterate these personal sacrifices and there were and there's various scriptures about the personal sacrifices was that my fault hmm I didn't know what I was doing there okay forgive me I'm not sure what happened there praise God now there's five Old Testament personal sacrifices now remember the the priests always did those two lambs every single day but then men and women could bring sacrifices to the temple as well for worship there was burnt there was a meal which also called grain peace sin and trespass offering all these were part of the experience so the God had daily worship with with his people the daily sacrifices and then when the occasion called for it the people would fall short and they would want peace with God again praise God they want their sins taken care of amen they had a way to take care of their guilt amen they had a way to take to have a meal with the Lord praise the Lord they had a way to give to show God they're fully devoted to God amen now so let's look at he's the burnt was the the burnt sacrifice is the oldest sacrifice it's from Genesis 8:20 with Noah and this was complete and total submission to God's will see none of this was eaten by anyone because it represented the whole will being sacrificed to God praise the Lord so church whenever there was a moment where the believers one to show I'm fully devoted I'm fully sold out to God they would offer the burnt offering praise God to show that God that I'm not I'm not we're not keeping any of this I'm giving all that I am to you praise God and we know Jesus Christ was the burnt offering praise God he freely gave him himself all of himself because he said not my will but thy will be done he gave all of himself praise God to be a burnt or we say to be sacrifice to the Lord praise God Amen this word actually means burn actually means an offering of a cent that's what it means it was a expressing of total devotion to God the directions are given in Leviticus 1:3 to 17 it could be a bowl and look at this depending on how much money you had you could give a bull or a sheep or goat or a dump or a pigeon isn't God so merciful god could let the poorest person have a total devotion to him praise God amen you give according to what you're able I'll say like this just like Jesus said remember that woman gave the two mites and Jesus said she gave more than all the Pharisees with their thousands of millions of dollars amen because it's always based upon what you have not on the actual amount of what you give and God's saying the same thing here you can be devoted to me whether it's a small thing or whether it's a large thing as long as you give a burnt offering as long as you give full devotion I'll receive it praise God amen thank God hallelujah that's why I'm so thankful Jesus said if you're faithful with the little I'll make you ruler over much praise God we don't have much in this world as far as even our church or we don't have a much compared to lots of people now we're blessed in America no doubt about that tremendously but we might feel like we have little but we must still be fully devoted whenever we have we must give our full devotion to God's Word amen then that way we can express ourselves as being fully devoted to God now we know of course Christ fulfilled all these but we can see how we can see how believers would want to come and bring a burnt offering I hope you come to church like that don't you come to church like that that's what I was thinking some of these you come to church with this feeling you should come to church when you feel guilty you should come to church when you want to have peace and just Thanksgiving with God you should come when I just want to be fully devoted praise God amen I like it because it gives every believer chance I feel sinful will come to the house of God make a sacrifice amen right common approach before God and you know God will receive you amen if he received them under the blood of bulls and goats he'll gladly receive us under a more sufficient blood the blood of Christ amen hallelujah so the meal was grain but it wasn't meat it was flour and then this is also called a food and drink offering and this represented the devotion of the works of your hands to God so you were a farmer in those days right your family farm so it showed that you were devoted with your grains and also with your your vineyards wait for the wine so this was your work and you're coming here to have fellowship with God amen this word means means a great offering here and this was a devotion to God and it recognized his goodness and His Providence so when Israel wanted to show God I'm so thankful you've given me food on my table amen when you you've been so good to me and I want to and another way you can look at it they could bring baked bread they could bring grilled bread or fried bread or roasted bread and it was oh it could be a seasoned that was always seasoned you always had to season it and there was there's no sweetness and no leaven and here a portion of the offering was the root be burnt the rest went for the priests and their meal so this was a time where everybody got part of the meal the priest could eat it the worshiper could eat it and God and they're saying we're gonna fellowship and we're gonna have this communion with God amen we're thankful Lord all you provided because of your provision I've come to recognize that you provided all four for me and for our priesthood and that we want to have continual fellowship with you amen hallelujah and these are instructed to be freewill offerings so these were ones where God where you really saw the ones who really loved the Lord praise God they did whenever it's free whenever it's on your heart come bring a meat on a meal offering unto the Lord come and have fellowship and just come tell God how thankful you are for all that he's provided for you praise God amen thank the Lord I love this because God gave everyone a fair chance God let them live according to the dictates of their heart praise God and however however much in love they were with God God allowed them to express it praise God see this was a mandate and this was whoever would like to come and show me thanks and whoever like they come worship you can come and worship praise God from your heart hallelujah oh thank the Lord thank you thank you Jesus praise God I just have nothing so happy today praise God now have a peace offering the peace offering was expressing your gratitude and thanks to God it was again free will and many times they finished there was the finishing worship of a vow some was given to God someone's given to the priest some of the worshiper and his family this had nothing again to do with sin praise God these were also called Thanksgiving offerings freewill offerings and waive offerings it could be cattle sheep or go according to Leviticus 7 it could be male/female but it must be without defect that's what God wants God wants a pure sacrifice praise God hallelujah if it was Thanksgiving it could also be a variety of breads and the purpose of this was to consecrate a meal between two or more parties before God and share that meal together in fellowship of peace and a commitment to others future prosperity praise God amen so again we see a lot of similarities in the meal and the peace there as far as God recognizing God providing for you and our opportunity to come back and tell the Lord thank you for what he's provided for us amen praise God that's why we seen that song we bring the sacrifice of praise we bring the sacrifice of Thanksgiving into the house of God amen thank the Lord now next in offering now this is for the atonement to purge our sins and many times these are unintentional sins this is expressing our sorrow and desire for fellowship with God and the size mattered based upon the severity of the sin a few could not be eaten but most were eaten by the priests so this is found in Leviticus chapter 4 we're not going to read that of course by just reading over some overviews of it now it contains elements some things were like the burnt offering yet not the same and even elements of the peace offering Wow some of the sins from which one needed atonement were not moral sins but matters of ritual impurities as well some have also called this the purification offering as as long as along with the sin offering praise God so the the purpose is to purify yourself and re-enter the presence of God amen so your unintentional your your your impure you brought a sin offering say Lord I want to re-enter into your fellowship praise God hallelujah so I'm bringing a sin offering before your throne today receive me I want to feel your presence again amen like David said restore to me the joy of my salvation praise God receive it praise God and we know he does now the last one the gill or trespass offering this is for intentional sin and again you're supposed to be sorrowful and these were eaten by the priests this also is translated as a guilt offering this is something that you owe on account of your sins for something you did on purpose also called the trespass offering or the reparation offering all right now sometimes this had a specific monetary value when someone owed another person on account of a debt due to a sin and it could be repaid with silver as well my with or sacrificing of a in addition a 20% fee was added on to it so 20% freeze god so a double tithe can you imagine that when you actually did somebody wrong God made sure you paid extra to cover because you did it on purpose this one was extra expensive to offer think about the time you pay think about what's that number you pay every paycheck when times at times two to go along with the ties you regularly pay that's what God is saying see God is trying to teach them as a schoolmaster sin is awful and there's certain sins that are more awful than others praise God right remember Jesus said because his generation rejected him they'll suffer more than those of Sodom and Gomorrah because a greater than Solomon is here right so there's some sins that were greater and God was trying to show them by like it - God was showing them there's a way back from all sins praise God amen no matter how awful David did it intentionally right he did he he stoled Bathsheba had Uriah killed he did it intentionally but God made our way back amen he always had a way back praise God hallelujah as long as they repent humble themselves and get and give a sacrifice God had a way to receive them because he was merciful and loving praise God the merciful God thank the Lord so now church you can see I'm skipping besties because that's what come what I was referencing it's so smart it when it hurt your eyes now you can see how Jesus fulfilled all of these Old Testament sacrifices you can clearly see right now he had to become our burnt offering he saved the game is full well for you and I praise God he was our meal offering he was our peace offering he was our sin offering and he took all of our trespasses as well praise God Jesus Christ fulfilled every one of these amen now you remember this and let's go to numbers 31 this is the first time first time in a long time I've actually seen this in real practice on of all those sacrifices I remember those are all the sacrifices that we've seen the people who just could come and give a free will they could come and give a sin-offering whenever they wanted to be right with God but remember there was also a special red heifer sacrifice we preached on this extensively I believe this is what a beautiful revelation for our homes if we let sin in our homes and today it's usually with TV screens right in smartphones and evil books and evil magazines if we let that in our home it's going to defile our home and that destroys everybody spiritual growth it's so important for our homes to be a real family author of God amen because remember even Paul said he said if two people are married one save one's that he said the believing wife sanctifies the husband hallelujah praise God oh the believing husband sanctifies the wife amen that's the power of the believer and just their home the prints of God dwelling in that house praise God we had one of our children my wife told we've had one of our children this week go up to my wife and they're talking and and they said I really need the Holy Ghost amen and we prayed and everything like that we'll keep praying but we had a child I look that's that's from dwelling in our home they can feel the presence of God they see some of their shortcomings and they can recognize I really need to be born again why because all the sin all the death is being kept out of the house the Friends of God is found in the home praise God amen I mean even that if the Lord willing if I ever get this book done and I go I'm next one I do I want to do a family book that will be one of the great chapters because it's so beautiful outside of all the other sacrifices Israel would get unclean by touching a dead thing right or they let a dead thing coming to their home or something would die in their home and because of that they had to go get purified and remember them to get sprinkled on the first day the third day and the seventh day and finally after the seven day they could come back to the temple of God amen oh thank god now here I read this this week's number is 31 now we're not going to read all this this is quite a sobering story I I was really sober after because Moses you know the God set him against the Midianites you know the many nights wouldn't let them remember they were traveling through the prophetess and the many nights would not let them stop and eat the food and and the cattle have the grass and drink the water and so God sent later he sent he sent an army to destroy him and he did and this is where Balaam was also killed as well Batum was killed in this battle because he went on the enemy's side he joined the enemy side and didn't take the commands of God he took the second Word of God he took the permissive will of God not the perfect will of God and God help us to take the perfect will amen now I'm gonna skip ahead to the end of the chapter so let's go to the end of the chapter and I'm sorry it's 2:24 okay that's right okay I was going 19 yeah numbers 31 19 sorry I have something confused there 19 and do he abide without the camp seven days so he's talking now to all the soldiers that have come back and they brought back a bunch of spoils the Bible says and he says stay out seven days whosoever hath killed any person who sever have touch any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day what's he talkin about the waters of separation verse 26 and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all the work of goats hair and all things made of wood and elli of the leaves of the priests and under the men of the war which went to the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses only the gold and the silver and the brass and the iron of the ten and the lead everything that ye that may abide the fire he shall make it go through fire and it shall be clean never less it shall be purified with the water of separation amen and all that abide is not the fire shall you make go through the water praise God so God says if whatever we're gonna bring in this house amen how many of you whenever we're gonna bring this church it's got to be first purified before the part of the church amen how did I tell you thank God he's saying if you're bringing these spoils in these metals they must be first go through the fire and if they make it through the fire then they got to go through the water praise God the washing of water by the word Amen thank the Lord so see that's why this red heifer was there they had to have the ashes burn it mix it with water outside the camp and then before anything could come into the church it had to be sprinkle with the waters of separation wait three days make sure it's clean sprinkle it bring it back four days later on the seventh day sprinkle it and then after those seven days then they can be declared holy they could be purified they could be cleaned may God help that to be a lesson to us in our families that we will not let anything into our families or in our homes except it's been purified and we know it's right by God's Word now I know there's areas of Liberty like we've talked about that over the years there's areas of Liberty but makes your Liberty doesn't just humble praise God right so I just wanted to show you there's a beautiful real example before even metals could come into the church they had to be sprinkled with the waters of separation see that's my brother man said we got to be careful what we allow in our homes like even clothes right and even toys and even things because some of them can carry spirits right like I've heard different preachers I don't know anyone but I've heard different preachers that have they've just received like art from overseas there are different art and they just you know like dragons or you know swine or something like that evil art they've got a souvenirs or people have given them they bring it in their home and then they recognize there's trouble right because the evil spirits they carry spirits right one time brother Branham had that well the the family that had the child that that had the spasms to burn the clothes that they had on right and then the devil left so see this gives us an idea that we have to keep our homes very clean and something had to die there's a thank god there's a sacrifice to keep our houses clean amen thank God there's a way if I touch something dead there's a way to make me pure again amen a special sacrifice a red heifer amen hallelujah without blemish praise God died for me and I can be sprinkled which we know means an anointing right Peter said your sprinkle with the blood of Christ just like Moses sprinkled the people that sprinkle men they join them to the Covenant right and when we're sprinkled that covenant to renew right then anointing comes back upon us praise God amen and that's what David that's right I know that's what Moses is saying here this red sacrifice a red heifer sacrifice died so that we could be pure again we can be clean again praise God for everything else that wasn't covered now you've got the red heifer sacrifice amen so anyone who contacted the dead whether soldiers anyone else they had a way to be pure again praise God thank the Lord now here I want to get you I guess I'm not watching my time or he's God yeah I'm trying not to wear myself out after last few days yeah getting getting weak gotta get stronger praise God ah along with all those sacrifices now we come to the feasts and number with the feast God told Moses you don't get rid of all the other ones when you do this you add to it so he said do all this besides what you've already done so with God it was never all you got a day off now you you have to go to church now you have to read your Bible now you got a day off you know God wasn't doing that he was saying I need more devotion if you want to stay true if you want my presence you must stay continually devoted praise God amen now there was three annual feasts the Bible just calls them the unleavened bread the weeks and the Tabernacles but we know there's seven within the three there's seven within the three and remember God told Moses he said tell tell the male's three times a year those men have to come up to the the temple and they have to worship he said don't let them come empty praise God amen don't let anybody come in the church and they're just going to come in empty he said make sure they're bringing some type of sacrifice amen make sure they're devoted make sure they want to get right with God make sure they want to show their appreciation to God amen hallelujah he would have they said oh if they saw a man say Oh where's your sacrifice I'm not bringing any this time he said you can't worship if you're not willing to sacrifice you can't worship right like Jesus said you got a worship in spirit and in truth it takes a sacrifice our worship always takes a sacrifice amen and God said don't come empty listen after all God's done for us how can we come empty to church praise God after all God has done for us saved us fill us with the Holy Ghost give us blessings and answered our prayers now protecting us from the coronavirus how can we come here empty we know we come bringing a sacrifice of praise amen so see on top of these the daily personal redheffer now you have the feast three times a year these three feasts now I'm gonna put this up here a visual for you to see the three are the Passover in the first month now Moses also called it the feast of unleavened bread that was in the first month usually end of March early April we'll just say April ok so April May June so Pentecost was the third month in June June July August September October so Tabernacles October so yeah those three you have those three feasts and then within those you had special days as well so the Passover was on the fourteenth day of the first month unleavened bread was a seven-day feast from the fifteenth of 21st here's what we're rejoicing in the day the firstfruits praise God the sheaf of the first fruits on the 18th day of the month and then fifty days later was the Feast of Pentecost and then four months later on the first day the seventh month the blowing of trumpets and the tenth day the Day of Atonement of the seventh month and then the fifteenth through 21st was the Feast of Tabernacles how's that helped by God's grace I tell you I got to review these every couple of months because I forget them there's so much to remember but God has laid these out church and let's read now let's go to Leviticus 23 let's go there let's review these and we can see the beauty of what Christ has done and we can see where we're living at by God's grace and through Paul's preaching that's my last point through Paul's preaching we can see how there's not there's really not a special time of the year where we shouldn't be more devoted to God our devotion should be steady all year Leviticus 23 now verses 1 through 3 speak of the Sabbath's and the feasts soda speaks of the the Sabbath here because he's introducing them now to Moses now the Passover verses 4 and 5 these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which he shall proclaim in their seasons in the fourteenth day of the first month that even is the Lord's Passover now we can recall out of those things this is a type of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ before Moses brought him out the night before they left they had to kill the lamb in the evening time right as Jesus was killed in the evening time praise God and there to eat it with bitter herbs and they had to be ready to travel the next day praise God then to be ready to leave because if once they ate of the lamb they had to put the lambs blood upon the doorpost and the lentils amen where it is there it is again God dealing with every house praise God he said a lamb for a house praised I'll say like this I've got a lamb for my house and you and I we should all have a lamb for our houses praise God let me if there's a lamb for a house then we got to let the Lambs blood come in praise God we got let the Lambs blood be applied to our house we have to apply the Holy Spirit to our lives especially our homes amen remember that night the Death Angel passed over about midnight and anyhow it didn't have the blood of lamb the death angel took the firstborn and God said because I spared all your firstborn he said I'm not gonna take your firstborn he said I'm gonna take the Levites and they're gonna be my ministers praise God he said so you'll remember that I spared your firstborn amen God is so gracious to us praise the Lord so that represents the cross of Jesus Christ that Passover because passed over and anyone under the blood was saying praise God anyone not everyone on the blood was spared thank God that we're spared by the Passover sacrifice today are you glad amen glory the fourteenth day now here's the one verse 6 verses 6 to 8 and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord seven days he must eat the unleavened bread and the first day shall have a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you should offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days in the seventh day is a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein praise God so we know along with all the daily sacrifices then to sacrifice the lambs at the Passover and now here you have the unleavened bread which every day you would have you would eat the unleavened bread now look everybody notice how many days was it seven days it's a type of the seven Church ages right if you're gonna accept the Passover blood of the lamb then you got to enter into a time called a time of unleavened bread amen where you eat God's Word where there's no there's no leaven in it oh yeah there's no sin in it praise God and this is the second part of the first feast the feast of unleavened bread and this of course represents communion can you imagine they're just eatin and there's eating the same the bread we had last night the same bread just for seven days no leaven no leaven no special effects to the bread right just unleavened bread unleavened bread communion plain humble simple pure communion with God Almighty that's right unleavened this is the second part here praise God now next is where we are today praise God let's go to verse nine amen and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak on the children of Israel and say to them when ye come into the land which I've given unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then he shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest under the priest remember a sheaf was like a handful right is a handful of the stalks of wheat that had the grain still attached to them it's just like a handful and they would buy and bundle up together so he says bring a handful of the firstfruits and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you amen so this sheep was accepted for you amen hallelujah even in other words God was accepting Jesus Christ for us amen oh yeah yeah when Jesus was wave he said I'm I'm alive I'm risen he's risen he was accepted he was way before all the people that because he lives we shall live also praise God God accepted him God accepted him and raised him and so God accepts us and will raise us as well amen see it's accepted for you this is wave for you so you know the first fruits made it and if the first fruits made the rest of it is going to make it praise God amen and you should offer that day when you wave the sheaf and he lamb without blemish so see now there's another sacrifice right another lamb without blemish in the first year for a burnt offering see burnt offering so on the resurrection we need a total total devotion to God oh we don't we need today a Friday Christ Fellowship amen we need Saints who are fully devoted to God all the time amen they're not going to hold any area of their lives back they're gonna be fully devoted and give this offering on the day of the resurrection hallelujah thank the Lord I love this verse 13 and I get some meat and I get some fellowship here and the meat offering there shall be two tents deals of fine flour mingled with oil there's oil oil on the Day of Resurrection action and offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet savour and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine the fourth part of an hints Oh bread oil line on this Resurrection Day I love it I love it George don't you oh my verse 14 and you shall eat neither bread nor parched corn nor green ears until the self-same day that you have brought an offering unto your God remember is all unleavened bread right 11 bread unleavened bread 11 bread he said until you bring this offering you won't eat it any of that until you fulfill all your vows praise God until you feel fulfill all the time praise God it should be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings so he said forget the corn forget the green ears he said first bring these offerings and now you can go back to that diet that you were on before I love the Lord don't you oh my showing us these great things in his word okay now that was the third firstfruits that's where we are today so the Passover represents Jesus blood the unleavened bread represents separation from leaven separation from sin and the first fruits represents the magnification of Christ in the resurrection this magnifies Christ in the resurrection and now you had seven weeks right seven weeks 49 days plus the next one was the fiftieth day now you have seven weeks you have to wait till June for the next feast Pentecost let's read that verse 15 now as far as I know this is the portion Leviticus 23 that has the most information about the Feast of Pentecost praise God now we know this represents so as we read it let's think about the baptism of the Holy Ghost or Acts chapter 2 and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought those chief of the wave offering seven Sabbath be complete even under the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days he shall offer a new me offering so it's something new praise God remember me twas like chicken or wasn't like lamb it was bread so this is a new offering so you halfway or three months in this year you're gonna bring something new it's gonna represent something different praise God and you shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of 2/10 deals they shall be a fine flower and they should be bacon with leaven they are firstfruits under the Lord so see what's God's showing he's saying there's no leaven in Christ there's no leaven in his death burial and resurrection there's no leaven at all praise God but about three months down the road there's going to be some leaven in your year praise God every year you're gonna recognize that there's leaven and I love what Schofield says I want to read it he said observe now to lows not a sheaf not a handful like the firstfruits of separate grouse loosely browned together right that's where the that's what this was they're loosely bound together all these stocks you know it's just a handful of there's a sheaf there of the of the stocks but now they're not all separate now they're all one he says not a separate growth but a real union of particles making one homogeneous body praise God even so on the day of the day of firstfruits it was all separated right everybody was still separated but three months later God says now you're not all separate now you're one praise God now those two lows represent remember that I believe the Jew and Gentile they represent the former rain latter rain you can represent the off the alpha bride and the Omega bride praise God they can all they can all be represented there because you have to male female praise God right beginning and end God is the beginning and end of the Gentile dispensation and sin leaven represents sin so this represents the Gentile dispensation now God is going to have there's going to be bread there's gonna be unity but there's gonna be eleven amongst unity right as much as I love each one of you as much as you love me I still see some leaven sometimes Church right as much as I love Hosea much as Hosea we love each other sometimes I fall short of God's glory you see leaven in it but church that if the leaven is confessed let's be honest let's confess we have leaven let's not lose the unity let's keep the unity that God wants us to have as a loof unto God praise God not loosely but United were united under one mater under one faith one spirit the Holy Spirit so he must exist with one another despite the leaven we must stay unified as Christians hallelujah and he said wave them this is accepted for you praise God this is accepted for you this is what God is waving before the people were united now praise God we had the firstfruits we saw the rest of it's going to come to harvest in other words there's going to be bread now let me say like this there's gonna be bread for four months there's gonna be bread for two thousand years Amen it's gonna be a long season that we get to the end of the the the religious year now you're gonna have bread for these two thousand years I'm glad we got bread today praise God the Bible said there's a famine right now in almost every church but we've got the fresh bread of God amen thank God the fresh revelations of God's Word amen we are witnesses that this feast is a reality and it's being fulfilled and there's still bread today amen like Simon prayed and even I talked to Mike McCluskey yesterday the man who was in the wheelchair I talked to him yesterday just like he prayed he was at his wits end he's like he's like they're saying like this there's no bread in these denomination churches send me the truth and a few days later brother Jose Simon comes up said you need help with your plumbing he said I need more than that he said I need a Bible study praise God amen that was Simon's testimony to remember he prayed for three months in the closet send me the truth there's no truth in these denominations there's no fresh bread it was all rotting out they meant it had hotels in the right the old manner but we need fresh bread and God's obligated if we ask for god's obligating to send it because it's the season of pentecost it's the season of weeks it's time for bread hallelujah amen thank the Lord and this represent out the pouring of the Holy Spirit the firstfruits of raised there way before the people just wait a little bit longer and now the people are gonna be united it's one bread and Paul says that we are one bread Paul says that in Ephesians so I love this now program calls it a long hot season of Pentecost it's long C third fourth fifth six four months long it's a long hot church age right but it's the season that we're in and let me read that to you just so you know this is prophetically where we are right now we are so close to the blowing of the trumpets but let me read you the quote so you can see that oh I'm far behind ya recognizing your day listen to this morning but BAM said we have been going through that long Feast of Pentecost he says at numerous times we are in the prophetic season of Pentecost the program talks about the Jews being scattered and how all the trumpets sound under the sixth seal and they says where we've been 2,000 years in the Pentecostal feast he says it again Feast of Trumpets now this is beautiful here one of these was really beautiful he noticed the scripture the long period of Pentecost which Israel did reject back there see they rejected it he called the Gentile church out through this Pentecostal feasts how many understand what the Pentecostal faeces it's the first fruit of the harvest it's dipped first through the resurrection the Pentecostal feast don't miss his people and you on tape listen close this has been the time of the pentecost feast the Jews laid silent they rejected it now they've got to be called back to the atonement we know who the toment was they didn't and the trumpets sound after the jubilee or Pentecost was jubilee cause the Jews together the church said one more the one more yep one more now he said now years ago he was a good one I like this well the foolish version be saved no they start about saved from the tribulation they got to go through the tribulation they will be saved their souls being saved but they'll have to die during the tribulation whatever she happens now after that time she's in the state now she will have to go through the Tribulation Period and the reason of it is is because she's rejected the atonement in its fullness all right so let me go back to that one here she's rejected that atonement in its fullness now we know the day of atonement is later for the Jews but see our atonement was made right here praise God our atonement our blood was shed right there we're in the process of the the the religious calendar right we're in the season of God's prophetic prophetic feasts and we have the atonement praise God amen we've recognized the Passover lamb we are eating the unleavened bread and that's what is church most churches are not eating unleavened bread most churches are eating leavened bread right now you slip in oh it's okay to marry two three times they it's over they slip in that leaven Oh God three persons pray to that one and and bow to that one and then do that to that one now that one doesn't hear anymore it's 11 it's 11 next in so how are they ever going to get to the resurrection when they when they did haven't even got here they haven't even recognized that once you get saved you got to get sanctified amen hallelujah ah I know right where I'm sitting tonight where today by God's grace amen they have not really been they're not even eating unleavened bread there's a lot of message churches that are eating unleavened bread too as soon as they let leaven in there they've broken this and they don't move on this is why they'll never get here to get born again they don't live long enough they gotta live seven Church ages they got live they got a little distance they got to keep going in the sanctification praise God they got to live long enough to get all the live in all their lives and then they can have a Pentecost and then they can see the resurrected Christ thank God amen then they could have their own resurrection praise God this is why church that's why I was saying earlier see the foolish version they're not a lot of them already even preaching unleavened bread they're giving out dead you know dead Wiggly rotting bread we'd say every now and then you know we'll buy that well bye-bye the Aldi bread my wife makes homemade bread but I'll buy the Aldi bread the organic and if I'm a little busy during the week I don't get a chance to eat the bread I'll come down open up and I'll see white all over the bottom of it like oh can i spare it can i save any pieces no you can't save it but if you just leave it sit there or do it it's not finished and you lose track of it it just automatically becomes moldy that's what happened to people you give them the word you give them water baptism in Jesus name they'll have it they'll be excited for a while but if they don't keep eating on the bread the rest of its just gonna get old and disgusting now they're not interested in it anymore they don't like to hear preaching about baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they don't want to hear preaching about the cross they don't want to hear that why because laven has entered in and it's defiling the bread so that statement brother man makes is true the foolish virgin is still eating bread that's got leaven in it so how they ever going to experience the real resurrected Christ and then go to Pentecost themselves and get the Holy Ghost my praise God all right now let's go back to the Leviticus 23 here lo will try to finish up here I want to read this whole chapter but I'm seeing work kind of short on time here now look at this verse look at 18 I need to offer with this bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year and one young Bullock and two Rams look at that seven eight nine ten ten offerings they shall be for a burnt offering my unto the Lord there it is again Watchers oh my what a revelation what's God asking for from us in this Pentecost full devotion complete burnt offerings amen how do you praise God unto the Lord with their meat offering drink offering even offering made by fire of sweet savour unto the Lord then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a while there's even a sin offering and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings and the priests shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits Wow for a wave offering before the Lord with the two lambs they shall be holy to the Lord for the priests so the priests got to eat on that as well I just know I didn't check that and catch that right there verse 20 the other offerings get waved with the bread of the firstfruits that's the two loaves before the Lord with the two lambs they shall be holy to the Lord for the priests praise God so look at this look there's a lot more sacrificed Church under this Pentecostal feast right there's a lot more sacrifices how many are willing to sacrifice more for God praise the Lord hallelujah now verse 22 and when you reap the harvest of your land thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reposts neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of the harvest thou shalt leave them under the poor and the stranger I am the Lord your God so he tells them at the end of this make sure there's a little gleaning left that's what's happening right now there's a little bit of gleaning left right gleaning a soul here gleaning a soul there meeting a soul there praise God amen now finishing up let me just finish this here it's a good review by God's grace now next is the trumpets the blowing of the trumpets now I agree with this these are historically fulfilled the Passover 11 bread sheaf of firstfruits Pentecost the next thing on God's prophetic calendar is the blowing of trumpets to gather Israel together praise God after that is the Day of Atonement and we know that's when all the sin of everyone was washed away everyone in the entire camp that's when the sin was washed away everything was forgiven at that moment praise God and then the last was Tabernacles that of course represents dwelling in houses right temporary houses that represents the Millennium praise God so from the cross of Jesus Christ to the Millennium we must go through these seven feasts and right now we're on number four praise God is it interesting the fourth seal as well we're under the fourth seal right now as well not the fifth and not the sixth not the seventh we're under the fourth seal right now as well let's stand to our feet praise God I'll stop right there and go one more scripture first Corinthians five let's yeah that's right I want to close with that now this is something I'm I'm very honest I'm growing in this understanding because right now and I'll put it on the screen so you can see it right now there is spiritual observance of these feasts Paul says it that's why it's not just Holy Week from April whatever April 9th to the 12th it's not just Holy Week it's continual Holy Week because that's what Paul says in 1st Corinthians 5 1 to 8 now you know the story a man was sleeping with his stepmother and Paul says you're not even morning if your sin doesn't make you feel bad something's wrong if you still cuss and you don't feel bad something's wrong with you with your life if you watch dirty movies and anything and you don't feel bad something's wrong with your life if you can tear down somebody's character and put them in hell something's wrong with your life any sin any leaven we're under the feast the ball says we're still under the feast of unleavened bread and Passover he shows it right here first Corinthians 5 verse 2 and he are puffed up and have not rather mourned so see now you know what leaven is in a church leaveners churches people that do not mourn for their sin they don't feel bad about it they'll come here sermon they'll get their sins preached on and they won't feel bad about it they'll just go right out there and Paul said that is leaven leavens enters in the church that ye have done this deed might be taken away from among you that's my prayer anybody that's gonna live in sin God taking them out of our church okay how small we get I don't care how big we get we don't want sin among us cuz it'll destroy us it starts with one person right the worst thing is when it's in the pastor that's why I got to keep my life right because he's the one giving the word he's the one giving the word and so if he's got letter in his life it'll jump to the next person then the next it'll just keep growing it grows slowly and Paul says that's when a church is puffed up when sin is not mourned over see how important it is for us to keep sin out of our lives every single service is an opportunity to bring a sacrifice in offering Hey raise God hey man thank God amen whether it's a trespass or sin every service is a chance for us to keep the lemon out of our church he said there or not he says you know how I judge he said take that brother and deliver him to Satan in verse five number six and your glorying is not good no you not that a little leaven love it leaveneth the whole lump they were glory about it they were laughing about it he says that destroys the whole church let me give it just a real thing a real story there's a married couple I had uh I counseled years and years ago I got to know him pretty good counseled them you know before they got married a little bit after they got married not to our church and I didn't know it but later they the husbands started introducing pornography into the marriage he got he tried to started convincing his wife to do it to watch it and then church that spread very small he pretty soon they started missing church pretty soon that woman started wearing high heels yes she had long skirts on and pretty soon her clothes got tighter and tighter and tighter and pretty soon they had a fight and now they stand divorced today because and you think what did it just one little a few minutes on the cell phone watching the evil thing and now the children now they got boys and girls now the boys not not that I'm not being critical but they wear shorts and and the girls wear just one small little thing if not taking care of they weren't warning over it sin must be more no sin must be addressed it's going to spread and we've got to keep it out of our families praise God and now their divorce struggling financially I mean all these other problems all because they compromised on one thing what is it Church leaven because you say well we don't know any message people that sleep with their mother-in-laws and it doesn't matter as long as they have any evil fantasies or any little desires or lusts that are evil they don't even have to do it jesus said you're guilty just by looking praise God and then it grows and grows silently till it destroys and consumes the whole family and that sister I've heard her speak in tongues I've heard her prophecy or prophesy I've seen her pray for people and God come down and give them experiences and shout and scream and praise the Lord and now divorce and wears pants all the time and living with different men all kinds of things that used to belong to the message so see it's just not like doing the physical act it's letting anything contrary to God's Word into our homes now was he saying verse 7 purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump that's why but Eamon and I were talking about it we talked about before brother Jose when when sometimes when people leave or things things get confessed we can feel like a brand new church amen any time sins out it's like it's a brand new church amen yeah it's a new love Abdo praise got a new lump of flour ain't my head ready to be full and then baked and united as one body praise God hallelujah as ye are unleavened that means we mourn over sin we're sorry God forgive me help me to overcome for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us so now Paul saying because we have a Passover sacrifice we can find forgiveness so he's saying we're still in the Passover right the Passover effects are still lasting hey amen praise God and then verse eight therefore let us the feast what the Passover Feast with so I lost my place let us therefore keep the peace not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth hey Church this is why we always have Holy Week musicians you can come this is why we always purge leaven from our lives our houses and our church now there's something to theirs I'm making this later if the Lord opens up perhaps for those a we've already heard the trumpet of the gospel I remember this happens after we're born again so I believe there's more revelation in here you can be born again and then hear trumpets to gather you somewhere to see the feast of atonement and then I don't know how it works out I don't know other maybe Tabernacles is crossing over to the new body I don't know but bro man said they haven't accepted the atonement and we see Paul says we must accept the Passover lamb we must eat unleavened bread you know why because the Saints shall judge the earth they're the only ones that will keep the feasts there are the only ones that will keep out all the leaven and so God uses those that keep the Feast to be judges at the end a praise God it's a long feast this Pentecostal feast is a long feast sometimes seem like when is this gonna end what is this hot hard difficult battles gonna end you don't know but there's got to be bleeding right at the end time praise God and we where we see the gleaning happening where no we're really close to those two trumpets Moses and Elijah blowing out the trumpets praise God where you won't see that from here Lord willing we'll see it from heaven but those two trumpets will blow gather Israel so they can be forgiven by Jesus Christ the fountain open the house of David that will lead us all into God's Millennium [Music] how many would our heads here how many to say lord help me to give or help me to accept your sacrifices and help me to give the sacrifices I'm called to give remember church weeks was a time of burnt offering total sacrifice father you see the hands my hands as well no God and now Lord as we pray help us remember that we live constantly in this feast of unleavened bread help us to take warning from these examples I've given just a few minutes on the cell phone can destroy if not if not cut out can destroy families testimonies churches ruined lives god help us Lord Jesus help us dear come now but the mourn over our sin dear God especially seeing the price that was paid on Friday night hallelujah Heavenly Father we love you Lord you saw the hands of a race
