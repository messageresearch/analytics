His name let's take our Bibles here tonight let's get right into the Word of God like to go to the Book of Psalms but I'd like to go back to the numerology series here I just got a few thoughts and just feeling a little bit inspired here I did take this tonight let's go to Psalm 71 verse 15 I'm gonna continue of course the purpose series there another revelation series and just trying to go day by day all the way in this holy Union only sweet communion that's what I'm trying to do by God's grace saying communion with the Holy Spirit stay in the word meditate on the word so we're thankful to do that by the grace of the Lord so I'm 70 115 if you're there say Amen all right he's got up there great now look at the the psalm rider here I didn't actually check and see this was David or not can anybody look and see is that David Psalm 71 in the Bible I didn't get a chance to look it up I would guess it would be but but the psalm rider says here about the numbers I just came across the scripture and I thought mine that's inspired Oh doesn't really say does it this home 71 doesn't say okay but Psalm 70 115 let's read this together on three one two three my mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for I know not the numbers thereof it's so great his righteousness and salvation is so great he can't even number it God in his numbers Amen let's have a word of Prayer let's bow our heads one more time Heavenly Father thank you Lord that your salvation and righteousness is so great the songwriter couldn't even count it Ord if we tried to count all of our blessings and all the things you've done or we run out of numbers we wouldn't be able to do it because of all your greatness because of all your mercy all your love Lord God we think of every breath each breath we have as a gift we'd have to count each one of those each song we sing we have to count one of those Lord every good thought we'd have we'd have to count all those for every good and perfect gift is from above Lord God and apart from you we can do nothing none of us have done anything good except we yielded to your sweet presence O God so we thank you for that it's without number Lord God Lord of all the greatness Lord that you've done in our lives and you're continuing to do so we give you glory help us to see you and your numbers revealed that we might know you better in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yours being seated here I do have quotes here and a few scriptures I think the main number I'll be looking at probably as number seven again the book I've been reading is just so incredibly long I'm just I'm still in Chapter seven it's so long because then once I see I got to go look them all up you know so it takes a lot of time then I want to see what a brother band say about it and so it's it's good it's going really good part nine we've probably looking at numbers 3 5 7 and 8 tonight we'll revisiting some of those I'm just adding to the list I'm hoping someday down the long line I could make some YouTube videos or maybe write a book on God's numerology for those people who are interested in it because it can tell us many things now most things as we said a few weeks ago most things with numbers apply to the Bible right and understanding the Bible for example I'm sure you don't walk around all day counting the number of times that you you know what certain places or did certain things and you probably don't do that every day or you know so maybe we're not seeing numbers like every day in our life speaking to us but there are times of course when numbers will speak to us you know and a simple one as I told you when I got had my van fixed and I didn't know I was under a warranty but the the number on the windshield they put was five five five you know three fives that's more than double grace that's triple grace and just saved us you know hundreds of dollars just because it was under warranty I wasn't aware of it brother branham you know spokes squirrels six times into existence and he said oh that's the number of a man and we know that's the number of anointed man and there's different things you know maybe the number of children that you have that might have speaks something now I'm not I don't know if we're done yet but we got seven I don't know if that's completion or not it might go over into eight a new beginning we'll have to pray my wife and our got to pray about that but you know you know you look at different things and what's interesting I was the fourth born child and then when I first started preaching brothers came up and said wow you have a row deliverance ministry and four is the number of deliverance the fourth man in the fire so just you know little interesting things like that but we don't run into them every day but there are many times though important times in our lives where we would see that they would have an important meaning for us and so hopefully you're seeing more of those but for me as a Bible teacher and a pastor I see numbers playing the most important part in teaching the Word of God and excelling explain different things of course like we do with number three three so important seven so important eight so important all these numbers are so important to understanding the message of the hour why did it have to be seven seals why did it have to be four horse riders all these numbers are so important why have to be three works of grace right all these things so it all works together they're God's numbers all work together to make himself known and we see it playing a major part in our Bible doctrine now I'm going to start again with my text remember David or the psalm writer just says how great the numbers are but I just heard brother Graham Satan I was listening to future home because there's a quote I was listening to him there and I was just saying how brother Graham said after the seven day said the seven days millennium I mean I remember he said that he said but he didn't run out of types there because after the millennium comes the eighth day which is the first day all over again he said it's the new day and he said he said someone might say well brother Branham you run out of numbers he said no eight is the day of eternity it's a day of new beginnings it's the eternal number and then he says see at once that eighth day hits right after the Millenium he said we come into the light throne judgment and after that he said we're done away with numbers there's no more numbers and the numbers he said all vanish they're all done away with because we all going to raise god so he won't need numbers necessarily we don't need them any more because it'll just be eternity amen you might be able to come you know we'll be able to know every 12 months right I'm sorry yeah every 12 months when there's new fruit on the trees right the Bible says that in book of revelation 20:2 every month there's a new fruit so every every month they'll be calculated I'll be counted but it won't be like oh oh we can't wait till this is over or I can't wait to this like we're anticipating the next one it won't be likely there'll be any anticipation or any nervousness it'll we'll be peace it'll all be joy it'll all be contentment because in God's presence is perfect contentment amen no doubt things will happen you know with months and years and and decades and millenniums and all these things but it won't be any pressure behind it amen because if we all be peace and joy amen but there won't be any need to count it anymore praise God because it'll all be finished up now let me give you a lesson here well let me give you the less than the Holy Spirit gave me this week okay so I'm gonna give you the lesson the Holy Spirit gave me so I was the first one to get the lesson and now you get it alright so this is why church we need the fivefold ministry today we're not going to just get rid of preachers and just play brother Branham although you should be playing brother Branham in your home I enjoyed listening to him today I was a sure blessing but this is why brother Graham said he's not the only preacher he said we need all the preachers this is why we need all the preachers I'm gonna give you two examples because brother Branham was a man and he said things that that needed corrected he's a man now most of his message teaching most of his Bible teaching I would say 99.9% is right but there's little things where he just made little mistakes he admitted it I'm gonna show you one of them and so that's why we need balance and discernment we must have a right balance and we must not make brother Branham God right but we must not do away with him we've got to have the balance right in the middle road we need him we need his teaching we need what God told him but we're not going to exalt him we're not going to get rid of him we're going to give him his proper place and back brother Brandon tells in the church age book we need to give the seventh age messenger the same honor and respect that they gave to John the Baptist because John the Baptist was a forerunner brother Branham was a forerunner they deserved the same respect amen but just like John the Baptist said I must decrease so he must the same thing as today but Jesus Christ is supposed to be increasing and and and our and our maybe our our affection for brother Branham and our she loved her brother Ram that's supposed to be decreasing any any human dreaming you know anything that's unscriptural anything that's not right there's not the right kind of love anything that's not right shouldn't be decreasing right and all of our level all of our focus should be on Jesus Christ the word but we don't do away with brother random he's still that seven star in the hand of Jesus he still hates his light glory it's still a hot shining bright light of the Holy Ghost amen so when I preach I still uses quotes I still use my story like last week remember last week when we look when we preach on purpose I showed you the purpose program said he was born for how many remember that that his life shines like a star in a dark black universe that's how bright his life is like children were listening to Billy Graham we just listened to five minutes of Billy Graham last night remember girls and they were saying while he's quite a preacher I said yeah brother and said he was a great preacher but around said he had justification down to a tea but too bad he's in precinct vacation right too bad he didn't preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he preached like an archangel boy he can really preach up salvation through Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is God he preaches all these things but it he only goes so far he only takes you a third of the way praise God amen but God said that's the messenger to not take us a third of the way not even the second part of the way but all the way in over Jordan into the Promised Land amen Billy Graham will bring you out of Egypt but we need the Holy Ghost to guide us through the desert the pillar of fire and then we need Joshua to take us into the Promised Land amen hallelujah thank you Lord remember Billy Graham started the year after brother Branham praise God God always sends his messenger first that's right now let me give you the lesson the Holy Spirit gave me this week I'm not downplaying brother Branham I'm not trying to nitpick brother Ram please get that out of your mind but I'm trying to help you understand why we need preachers today another reason we need it is because all five gifts mature the bride of Jesus Christ so here I just started this week oh no this is the one where brother bear made a mistake in feast of the trumpets brother and made a little mistake and he says he said I got something mixed up I caught it right there it's on the tape I'll probably hear from it and that's good if I make a mistake Church I want to hear about it brother Ram knew he'd hear about it if I make a mistake I like to hear about it so I can make sure I fix it the next time I don't want anybody believe in a wrong thing right then I skip down a little bit you said oh it's a great teaching there he said I didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible so see if brother Branham ever made a mistake or if you're not showing something where should we look we should look in the Bible praise God if it's something that the mother aunt says doesn't make a sense his advice to you and I would not be just up to it just to forget about it he said especially you preachers is what he said I must say oh yeah yeah especially ministers that's why this is important for me now you if you know if you're not you know called to study or or you're not know if you led to study that much you don't have to go look it up in the Bible but but as a minister I've got to I've got to make sure everything that he says I line it up with the Word of God first because brother Branham never took a text from his own sermons he always took a text from this holy book right here the Holy inspired King James Bible and the church said he couldn't take a text from well let me take a text when when I preached Christ the mystery of God revealed when I said it so eloquently now he didn't do that he said I like to read the Bible he said but man said because he said my words may fail but these words will never fail he said look in the Bible see some minister might pick that up and then you'd have it now now his mistake let me skip down here you remember which was just simple he said there were seven weeks from firstfruits I'm not I'm sorry he said there were seven seven weeks or seven Sabbath's from the feast of weeks till the Feast of Trumpets but there's not there was four these are months four 8:12 there was like 16 weeks so brother Graham just made a little mistake he said there were seven weeks from here to to here but as actually he meant seven weeks from firstfruits two weeks because weeks was Pentecost that was fifty right seven times seven is forty-nine plus one the day of Pentecost would be the fiftieth day so brother man made a mistake on tape and that's what he said he said if I if I make a mistake the ministers he said she'd go look the head up in the Bible now does everybody remember that I mean am i okay to go on they'll be okay with that okay he just made a mistake he said I'll probably hear about him the tape he said go look in the Bible especially ministers all right I'm happy to do that brother branham now I heard this this week now look I've heard people I've sat across and fellowship with people that said oh six is a bad number four is a bad number because of this quote but man said I want you to bear in mind there's no this is the first seal there there's Church and there's a bride you always have to make it run in threes fours is wrong threes three sevens tens 1224 40s 50s and those unbroken numbers see and God runs his message in not numerals of the Bible these numbers and you get something that flies off one of those numbers you better watch it won't come out next or write on the next things you got to bring them back here to where you start from so someone without understanding will read this in self for is always a bad number oh you were the fourth born one Jesse that's a bad number well if you remember when I preached for force a great number but what is Satan knew he impersonates it right and then it becomes a bad number when Satan uses but when God uses it it's a great number what brother Branham is saying here he says a fours wrong when you're dealing with threes if you're trying to teach something by threes and you put a four in there then that's when a four is wrong when you're trying to make a four into a three okay so without understanding I've heard people tell me this they've said oh six is a bad number four is a bad number nonsense it depends it's only a bad number when Satan either perverts it or you're trying to squeeze a four and make it a three and you're trying to cut out something in the Bible all right Oh like yeah it was like this I heard a preacher years ago he said instead of three works of grace like brother man said he changed it to four works of grace can you believe that four works of grace that is where force is wrong there's not four steps to redemption there's three steps right water blood spirit we could go through all those threes so that's where he's done something wrong that preacher did something wrong that's when a four is wrong does that help everybody okay now you've got to be very very careful Church because look at this two years earlier brother Branham was preaching this is when I preached Revelation chapter four I use this quote but Rams talking about the four creatures and brother Aaron you and I were texting about that remember recently he's talking about oh we may bring that right down to the gospel and bring it right back and placing it today just as perfect as it is here and remember for is an earthly number and see it's just a beautiful lesson here and so I'm pretty sure we won't get down to that maybe we will but it's so wonderful so there's nothing wrong with four creatures by the throne of God so it is for a wrong number no only when it's used the wrong way but he says for here is a beautiful teaching and the church said so one place he says four is wrong because he's saying you can't make a four into a three the next time he says oh there's four creatures it's a beautiful teaching the next time this is one brother Aaron was texted about now I'm skipping down here he's not about the four Gospels exactly was the same one talked the line the other was the Ox now there was four Gospels there it is four Gospels is the protection of the Holy Spirit so four beasts guarding the throne represents four Gospels guarding the book of Acts amen God didn't have three Gospels guarding ax he had four Gospels and that was a good number c4 is only wrong if you try to make it into something else that it's not or Satan perverts that for all right now let me give you another one church this is the one I heard today here's another lesson I've heard preachers and people use this all the time and I'm not downing them I'm just saying we need to sermon you and I need to sermon every quote from brother Branham we've got to take it back to the word I just heard this yesterday I thought oh this would be a good lesson for the church so and here's what I mean if somebody says something about a quote from brother Rama you don't understand it the thing to do is not get upset and not get prideful and translate well listen I know brother Han said this that's the wrong thing to do because you got a prideful spirit well I just heard it I studied and I know more about it let me hear Robo Graham said this that's the wrong attitude because look what he says here brother Ram said Christ does not appear from revelation 5 I'm sorry from revelation 6 no from liberation for all the way to 18 Christ is not in revelation 4 to 18 with the church okay let's read it John was caught up in the fourth chapter to see things which was is which is to come but the church finishes at the fourth chapter and Christ takes up the church and caught up in the air to meet him and does not appear again until the nineteenth chapter when he comes back with as king of kings and Lord of lords with the church huh so he says Christ and the church do not appear the church does not appear from the fourth chapter all the way to the nineteenth now brother Branham but brother Branham says later Christ appeared in Revelation 10 I sure hope that was Christ in Revelation chapter 10 praise God because who else did gene or who else - brother Ram get that open book from who else was that mighty angel is that was that was that Gabriel who was that see so people take this and say no no Christ in the church there's no Christ in the church from chapter 4 all the way to 19 and there's just so Gog Matic about it which church is ok it's ok like people want to respect brother Branham I do too people want to respect their pastor I want to respect their pastor too but the attitude behind the person it's all about their attitude they become a stuffed shirt or they become prideful we need to be humble amen because look at the next quote the day before this the day before he reads revelation 10 and if you notice that a mighty angel that's Christ skee because he's in the Old Testament was called the angel of covenant and he's directly coming to the Jews now for the churches finished see alright now even here he said he's coming for the Jews was revelation 10 for the Jews or was it for the bride according to brother branham revelation 10 7 is brother Branham receiving the message and then John the church eats the book and prophesized again before every nation people tongue and kindred Oh glory stay with me Church stay with me now we see the seven book of seal book is their mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God now all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger now here's the angel on earth and another mighty angel messenger come down see this angel as an earthly angel messenger but here comes one down from heaven a rainbow covenant only Christ it could be just exactly like it was a revelation first chapter standing amidst of the golden candlesticks with a rainbow to look upon as Jasper and sardius stone who is that that's Christ but he said Christ in the church don't appear from till the nineteenth chapter but here we have Christ in the church in Revelation chapter 10 now what should we do it now listen if you don't understand it yeah just put it on the shelf but don't get mad we shouldn't get mad and try to start a fight with somebody and try to make them look like they don't know what they're talking about just because we heard one quote and we think we know it all let's ask God to give us balance and discernment to make sure we understand what we believe in revelation 6 God is dealing with the church right the Antichrist is riding on four horses right he's riding on four horses who's he battling he's battling the church so God has to send a line anointing on the church so chapter six deals with the church is everybody with me he's a man if you're with me alright so the church is in Revelation chapter six the church is also in Revelation chapter 10 but if you take this quote too far but you don't see Christ in the church doesn't appear to the nineteenth chapter oh my to see wheat what do we need we need discernment and we need balance in the script in the quotes right that's what we need we need balance in the scripture when you balance in the quote all right all right now that's that that's the last I just want to give you a short lesson there all right hopefully everybody got the lesson now you have to take every quote oh four is the wrong number bro Jes oh six is an awful bad number well you got to balance that out you've got to go back to the word you've got to go you got to find other quotes why no brother answer this and I know that and I believe that let's just be sweet about it praise God let's just keep searching let's keep searching okay now we'll go threes five seven and I think we'll close with eight here give me about half an hour more I want to preach about 45 minutes two nights so three means life and what else - brother MC Oh divine perfection yeah now there's three appearances of angels before the life of Jesus on earth so God was testifying with angels here about Jesus's life it was a perfect it was divine perfect witness from angels that Jesus Christ was coming to Zacharias an angel appeared to Mary and then to Joseph before Jesus Christ came amen now I'm skipping right to five now five means grace or favor five can mean laboring grace and five can mean redemption now hi this was new to me I found this in the book there's five steps in Jesus humiliation to accept the death of the Cross and taste death for every man he had to go through five steps so we had to labor in God's grace for five steps but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God there's the grace labor and grace how is he gonna taste death by God's grace amen how are you gonna overcome Satan by the grace of God amen how are you gonna face death if God terry's and you die and we have to go to your funeral how are we gonna face it by the grace of God amen because Jesus tasted death by God's grace hallelujah amen so if we're going through a hard time right now what do we say Jesus give me grace give me your unmerited favor give me your favor so I can labor through this difficult time I can't do it alone Lord I'm being honest I need you Jesus give me labor and grace because Jesus Christ only took death by grace now here's the five steps the first step and now you and I can copy this can't we glory Laurie what's the first step Jesus did he made himself of no reputation you meant when Jesus said that in John Jesus said I don't want any man to testify me because I don't need to testimony of men hey then he said it's my father that testifies of me he does the works in my life amen praise God that's what Jesus said I'm not giving myself any reputation his first 30 years he didn't make himself of any reputation right but then after the Holy Ghost came on him the Bible said the Holy Ghost came on it and it led him out in the wilderness praise God and then he in the Bible said he came in the power or the Holy Spirit back into Nazareth and he started doing miracles he turned water to wine praise God he was a fully the fullness of God was anointing him but he made himself of no reputation that's what we need to do we need to not brag on ourselves we need to brag on Jesus but we need to brag on Jesus though we need to do that brag on Jesus we have no reputation but God is a reputation in us number two how do you make yourself a no reputation don't make yourself big take upon in the form of a servant become a servant find a way to serve that's what we're gonna be looking at with the purpose series brother man says this like a hundred times he says the flower serves its purpose serves serves a flower serves other people you ladies like getting flowers brothers do you like advice when you hand flowers to a sister a woman or some men it's a purpose Oh Oh smells so fresh it reminds me of springtime because I hate winter it's serving the flower is doing something for you the flower is not doing something for herself look how beautiful I am it's doing something for you and then you try to do something just for yourself you put it in water keep it as looking good as long as you can that's for you it's serving you amen and church that's what you're supposed to do that's what I'm supposed to do when you come to church you're supposed to be here to serve somebody else amen serve your purpose jesus said the Son of man did not come to be served but to serve others amen hallelujah you have a purpose and it's to serve most of us is to serve our families right how many would say amen to that most people it's your calling in life I think of these mothers and grandmothers most of you your calling in life is to serve your family that's what God called you to do amen so do it the best you can hallelujah be the best servant be the most kind loving servant you can possibly be because that's your purpose in life is the serving it hallelujah because you are here to serve a purpose that's what Christ lived by he wasn't here to build his own house although we have to have houses you know he was called through three and a half years and he knew it he knew his time was short so he said foxes have holes birds have nests but the Son of Man doesn't have a mortgage he doesn't have a roof over his head that's right so he says I open any reputation from any man I'm not bragging on myself jesus said the works that I do he said the father does them he said the son can do nothing of himself but that's what he sees the father do that doeth the son likewise how many how many remember that Scripture he said the father that dwelleth in me he drew the works he does the works and then he became a servant I'm here to serve I'm not here to be served well nobody did anything nice for my birthday nobody gave me a Christmas present or no one gave me a fourth of July whatever nobody gave me this don't wait that's okay if nobody gives us anything that's okay because God's already given us his love God's already given us eternal life and we're here to serve others amen and part of it too so the part reason people don't get things back many times is because they don't give the Bible says give and it shall be given unto you right I've seen people complain about oh they had a party for this person but then a party for that person now not in our church but other churches or that they did this for that they did that for that what about this person and those people that are complaining they're usually the ones that are living in sin because contention comes by pride right and then those people are some of the stiffest artiest people that won't share they they're not givers but the Bible says if you give it'll be given to you praise God don't give yourself a reputation don't brag on yourself brag on Jesus become a servant serve serve the church serve the Saints in that are here and then 3 he was made in the likeness of men so we know he left his theophany right Jesus left his theophany that pillar of fire in heaven whatever form he was in and he come down in the form of man he come down in flesh praise God now we don't have to worry about that one we're already in the flesh that's right number 4 in the step the Bible said I'm being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself now we can all use that right church humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he'll exalt you in due season he'll that he'll do something in your life and or he'll that all the people point at you or he'll let other people testify of what God is doing your life if you humble yourself he'll exalt you and part of the reason people don't get that - they don't get exalted is because they don't go in the prayer closet the Bible says if you go pray in secret I'll reward you openly right that's a promise like it's a promise because if you're anointed with prayers you're gonna walk out in public and you're gonna do something for God's glory and then you're gonna be a city on a hill that can't be hidden Amen how didn't you praise God and people are going to listen to you they're gonna listen to you they're gonna want to sit with you and watch videos about Jesus right they don't want to come to your church when they meet you right like Tanya amen and did you hear testimony did you hear her testimony she was crying and rejoicing on New Year's Eve and she said this is the first year she's ever started the year off right and with a home church and I thought look at Connie's purpose in the church she God set her - Connie gets her information for our church and now for the first time how do we don't know how old Anya's is probably I do not to ask right because we don't ask people especially women but think about that and all the years of her life this is the first year she started the year right with God and with a home church all because our sister served her purpose praise the Lord wasn't afraid to mention the church by deterring church patient loving kind sweet shouldn't say get out of my face you cut your hair right didn't say that we just have to serve our purpose and we have to humble ourselves humble or nothing who are we God used me let me be a glove that you put your hand in I'm just this useless glove put your hand in me amen move and me cuz I can't move myself I'll mess it up iris I can do nothing unless you move me and v v final laboring grace he became obedient I love that amen look at church obedience always follows what humility first humble yourself and say yes Lord forgive me I'm not gonna do it my way humble yourself and then obey what the word says oh it's so simple isn't a brother Lydia isn't so simple humble yourself nothing I just need to obey I've been I've been I've been disagreeing too long I should not I just should not have waited I should have just done what I what I knew the Lord wanted me to do humble yourself and then it be obedient and church that's how you be like Christ that's how you let God humiliate you that Christ might be exalted in that beautiful has anyone ever seen that in the Bible I appreciate these riders that wrote with the Holy Spirit program said they wrote by the Spirit of God he said they wrote and they glorified God I don't know yeah praise God alright next now in the same chapter Philippians 2 so I didn't know this there's five steps to his humility then there's five steps to his exaltation that's double grace to fives right grace grace thank you Jesus amen so it's God's grace that allowed to Humble himself and it's God's grace that raised him up and exalted him amen well I'm sorry to feel good here race to the heart thank you Jesus it's not a few little religious tonight they've had I didn't hear the praise God Church we need to be humbled that God can exalt us amen humble us by His grace His grace we'll do that it'll humble us make us finally obey and then he'll exalt us later so the first thing as when he got exalted he was given a name which is above every name praise God second every knee should bow in heaven Lord think about that church holy angels bow their knee to Jesus Christ hey every demon power the demon of bone cancer right the demon of depression hallelujah the demon of suicide every one of those demons bow their knee to Jesus Christ amen everything in heaven does its knee third everything in earth posits need and fourth everything under the earth they men even in Satan's Dominion hallelujah and fifth God it's so highly exalted after every knee bow after it gives in the name of a little name every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ you are Lord amen hallelujah which you should be so thankful if you can confess it right now praise God you are Lord Jesus Christ your brooder your God your Elohim your Jehovah I know we must confess he's Lord Amen we must let him be the Lord of our lives five steps to humiliation and five steps to exaltation hallelujah but what I'm most when I cry about is the humiliation we need more humility praise God amen I've always prayed that maybe that's why God's keeping our church small but I've always said this or every year I always say this I say Lord just keep me little humble and keep me little in your sight because Mela Ram said the way up is down the remnant say how see how big you can be he said see how little you can become see how humble you can become and then God can use you in something great so maybe that's why but I've also asked God to grow the church so it's all in God's hands anyway I can't add one cubit to my stature neither can you so it's all in God's hands the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord all right you ever seen this the double grace I'm sure you did you probably preachers preaching on it get your Bibles let's go to Zechariah chapter 4 this is like double grace double favor now to me it looks like a double labor and grace as well praise the Lord because of who it's speaking about speaking about these labouring prophets these two witnesses alright Zechariah chapter 4 all right you got any readers out there anybody that could read for me how about how about read 1 2 for Malachi why don't you read 1 and 2 Lydia why don't you read 3 and 4 Zechariah 4 1 & 2 Malachi than 3 and for Lydia three and four please all right now so we see two olive trees and the midst of that is a seven golden candle stick right verse 5 then the angel that talked with me answers send to me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then the answer is speaking to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel remember zerubabbel was the first Jewish leader that brought that first group of Jews out of Babylon back to Jerusalem to start reestablishing worship after they all got taken captive to Babylon and Assyria in different places where they went he was the first leader this is the word Lord on the zoobel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts amen so he was showing the light of God the worship of God was going to be fueled by two anointed preachers amen two anointed olive trees that because oil comes from the tree right those two anointed ministries would forgive fuel to the lamp stand to shine brightly amen right now verse seven who art thou a great mountain before his removal out shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it amen so this is enzo rubles time church can everybody see that this is endure beable his time so the headstone so this this temple was going to be finished and when the headstone would be put on of the new temple there be shoutings of grace grace double grace right now how many know that those two olive trees were a Haggai and Zechariah how many know that Israel started rebuilding the temple but then the government shut them down for sixteen years and there was no work done on the tabernacle or temple rather sixteen years and all of a sudden God raised up two olive trees anointed with the holy spirit and they were the two prophets of Israel and look what the Bible said then the prophets haggai the prophet Zechariah the son of Inno prophesied on the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of God of Israel even unto them then rose up zuru babul the son of shealtiel and Jess you are the son of josedech and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them amen hallelujah the people could not rise up until they had anointed prophets preaching and then that anointing was so powerful it calls them to write up let's build let's get the work that's what the message of brother instead of them to you praise God you should have heard that word and should cause you to rise up and start building the people of God amen the Church of God see it's anointed preaching it's olive trees that are giving forth its olive oil that gives light to the church that's what will cause you to build when you and I truly receive the word of the Prophet amen hallelujah I've been rising up for what received it in 2001 I've been rising up 18 years Ray's hot I've been up trying to do something for Jesus amen trying to preach his way or trying to point everybody I know to Jesus Christ what caused me to rise up the anointed prophet that's right Church hallelujah and I couldn't rise up out of my sins until I heard brother Branham preach hallelujah neither could they they couldn't rise up either and finish the work and see the work can only be finished when we hear the anointed preaching of the Prophet that's right to see we're not doing layers brother Graham but we got to balance out everything he said back with this Holy Bible because mother Mary said in the Brotherhood never said I'm your absolute he said this Bible he said if I died my tracks right now he said this Bible is my absolute amen glory oh sure thank God for anointed prophet it'll cause you to rise up you ever you ever feel down crowded and to be undefeated press play listen to that prophet hallelujah or you can listen to brother Jesse preach what bro Graham said that helps to write we're all working together right now I didn't stop there I just left it on their own accident that's where I stopped the last time that the humiliation see I found that in the book I think I copied that that was such a good thought one that a good thought I appreciate anointed men of God now seven let's get the seven and eight then we'll be done here I got a few more minutes I found a few more sevens and I'm still not done with this chapter this chapter is like the biggest chapter in the book chapter seven seven God just stamped seven over everything it's like God's putting his signature all over creation all over the book of Revelation the number seven is in Revelation 57 times I think like it's just all over like I'm finishing this this is my hand I'm coming I'm completing this my numbers gonna be on this god is just putting sevens all over everything amen and we got seven kids I don't know we'll see Old Testament sevens I've found some more from the old Desmond clean beasts were taken in the ark by sevens now by sixes not by fives by sevens unclean were taking the ark by twos so twos and sevens unclean twos clean sevens they even had files were taken by sevens as well so the birds were by sevens as well I can't explain that but all's I know is the clean ones were in groups of seven praise God they're complete the number of the complete be the complete beasts were clean they were clean interesting I can really can't explain it but that's what the Bible says in the Old Testament as well the day of atonement was in the seventh month so when was the time that they could be one with God all through the spiritual year what month was that the seventh that's when everything came to a complete completion right the religious year from Nissan all the way to Tishri I think I'm saying that right in the son Nissan Nissan the first month all the way to Tishri the seventh month was when it was completed and the Bible says that there in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month would be the day of atonement now there's your calendar again now remember they started their year in mid-march that was Nisan of course we started our year in January right but they started their year in March and it goes the first seven months go to middle of September there I guess the middle of October and then they start what they call their civil year from Heche shavon all the way to Adar so the seventh month was the month it was complete that was the finishing up before they get to the the regular civil year now the Feast of Trumpets was the first day of the seventh month the Day of Atonement was the tenth day of the seventh month and you probably heard preachers say right 10/7 set the tenth day the seventh month revelation ten seven who's heard that before okay I remember that okay so they're saying ten seven the tenth day of the seventh month was when total atonement came and people are saying preachers are saying no revelation ten seven that's when our atonement came when the open book came down from heaven well I can say amen to that I like that I like that that's pretty good tenth day seventh month revelation 10 seven atonement comes the open book eat the book now praise God amen feast of tabernacles all on the fifteenth day of the seventh month and that was the last feast of the year and of course that's in Leviticus 23 that's the completion so seven the seventh month the completion of the spiritual year seven months long now I didn't have time to look this up maybe next time but there are seven steps that lead up to the temple in Ezekiel twenty or forty 22 and 26 so seven completion right you got to walk these seven steps so interesting I don't know if this is the Millennial temple or this is just the temple after Ezekiel or in Ezekiel's day I'm not sure so I didn't have time look that one up now but this one will help us church there are seven things that completely defile humans and jesus said they start in the heart there's seven things how many want to be clean before Jesus okay I've got to get these seven things we got to come get these complete we got to be completely cleaning of these seven things out of our hearts a manager's amen so what first gotta get evil thoughts out of there don't think anything evil that's the first thing don't think about ending someone's life right or get doing away with someone or wrath on ppl adulteries don't lust in your heart right after someone else's husband someone else's else's wife fornications that's someone that wouldn't be married don't lust after anyone who's not married don't steal always tell the truth don't lie on anybody and never blaspheme God the church said Jesus Jesus Christ said there's seven things that defile completely to foul men and women there they are may the Lord keep us pure praise God now isn't it interesting I just it just struck me I should have caught it earlier there's seven things that defile inside but there are seven things that you got to get inside the statute perfect man thank you Lord amen I've been a fool to forget that or miss that one but seeing then once you got those seven God cast it off for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I knew ya so I wonder if these connect with those seven I never thought about that like in other words in order to get faith you got gonna gotta get rid of this in order to get virtue you got to get the other one off to see if that works out maybe in that beautiful oh thank you Jesus praise God take these seven out I'll give you seven better ones I'll trade those any day of the week praise God give me those seven Jesus give me those seven attributes of a real Christian praise God all right we're almost done did you know there are seven appearances of angels during the life of Jesus there were seven before as I'm sorry three before his life and there were seven during his life which that was complete he had a complete witness from angels in seven visitations first he visited the Shepherd's when he was a baby then the angels visited Joseph to flee to Egypt and then the angel visited Joseph to return the Egypt and then the angel met Christ after his temptation the Bible said the angel strengthened him Oh church if you need strength tonight just say God send your angel to strengthen me I'm tired of being weak I'm good to go through all these temptations I've been go through to all these trials send an angel of God and have him touch me amen I'm fighting hard I'm going through battles this week God send an angel if you resist the devil like Jesus did God is obligating to send you an angel amen because God can't expect Jesus and give Jesus something that you don't give us and then the angel is seen in Gethsemane and then there's angels at his resurrection and then there's angels at his ascension and the church said ah a complete angelic witness during the life of Jesus Christ only God could do that Church I love this one the Lord's Prayer has seven requests let your name be exalted let let us touch your name be hallowed sacred hallowed be your name let your kingdom come what's the kingdom the baptism the Holy Ghost we pray that every day oh my I need to pray that every day don't you jesus said the kingdom of God is within you Lord let your name be sacred let the Holy Ghost come to a cur and amen glory then they come to every place all over the world let every name on the lens McHale I be born again then we can go home oh thank you Lord that the kingdom of God come into my children's life praise God I know it's in my life I know that for sure I should work for the Dark Kingdom I know what it's like to work for that King for that awful King right that God this world but I know what it's like now to work for the God of heaven praise God the Lord Jesus I know it's like delivery he's a much better boss praise God he's so faithful he never got me to any trouble fact he always gets me out of trouble and usually I'm the one that gets in trouble sometimes the devil might have permission to get me in trouble but usually it's myself that gets myself in trouble he then the next is let that I will be done on earth as it is in heaven let's give us this day our daily bread physical bread and spiritual bread forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil in that beautiful seven parts did you know the Pope I didn't find this article but I saw the article online the Pope was trying to change the Lord's Prayer did you know that it just happened in 2018 let me see it can I hold you have a minute can I pull it up real quick let me see I'll just go to the the web here see this is the book I'm reading right here look at this thing this is seven look at this church I'm and you some of your like wondering well why isn't brother just done with chapter 7 look at this chapter that's crazy well I should say that crazy that's divine that's complete that's the word it's seven it's complete Pope change Lord's Prayer there dis right there yeah December 11th 2018 Pope Francis enacting change to the Lord's Prayer this is this is CBN this is a Christian well known television network don't you know the Pope is 666 and he's trying to change 7 the prayer has 7 parts the 666 office now I don't know if he's the one but he sees in the office of the 666 is trying to change the 7 Oh the Lord's errors and good enough the Vatican under the direction of Pope Francis will soon change the verbage in the Lord's Prayer to clarify God doesn't act in fact 10 10 people so he's trying to change it make it a little bit better ah are you with me oh my goodness trying to well I'll fix this prayer a little bit come on who's gonna fix Jesus Prayer what does he people don't like this right here lead us not the Bible said God does not tempt any man how many know that what this is praying is saying God help me not to be like job and a lot please don't allow Satan to tempt me that's what it's saying is there anything wrong with that no Jesus says you should pray that god help God please don't take all my children no little my children die what's wrong with saying that there's nothing wrong with saying that God don't let all my are my money be lost from from some tragedy don't let the devil destroy me keep your Holy Spirit around me amen what's wrong with that nothing's wrong with that that's good but the Pope wants to change that verbage let him change it we're keeping it hallelujah it's my headquarters is American it's heaven thank you thank you Jesus I get my orders from heaven I don't get an email from the Vatican every month you know what they do Church they send out a book every year and this is what the preachers have to sing him preach all year they send it out most of the nominations do that the denomination I was raised in the Pentecostal their denomination sent out here's what you need to preach all year know to everyone if anybody ever something like that you know what I do I throw it right in the trash because you're not my headship my headship comes from heaven hey man I know ya see what it is it's math that's 666 trying to well we can make this a little bit better now I like the old-time way I'm just those old-time Holy Ghost field Saints praise God somebody give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion where I can pray don't leave me in the temptation keep the devil off me keep your heads around me keep me pure keep me healthy serving you Jesus amen there's nothing wrong with praying that because remember boy what about him say Church brother man said those things came upon Joe because he feared them so see it was something he should have committed to prayer rather than being scared about it and the church said I can show you the quotes in perfect faith 1963 I appreciate not long ago he said Joe allowed to come upon himself so that's why it's okay to pray Lord please don't bring me through a temptation help me to stay humble help me to stay true please keep me healthy keep my family healthy help me God to be humble help me not to fear anything amen glory couple more here now I didn't get I didn't get to do what I wanted to do on this I want to go through hours a fifty three and kind of all the different things I tried it and I told you last week I tried I tried like for an hour to go through Isaiah 53 but my mind just wasn't right that morning I don't know maybe I was maybe I think enough sleep or something like that but anyways here's though the numbers you can see in the cross amen Jesus had five wounds what's five fives redemption two wounds in the hands - and his feet and a pierced side Jesus was wounded five times - tell us we had to be redeemed they are there were five Old Testament sacrifices were fulfilled on the cross how many can say amen to that there was five there's a sin offering the trespass offering the burnt offering the meat or meal offering which really didn't have any meat in it it was all grains right and the drink offering was included in there and then there's the peace offering so Jesus Christ on the cross fulfilled all five Old Testament sacrifices at one time even hallelujah praise God amen so church if you need forgiving for a sin that you did you've got blood for it if you trespassed against your brother you've got blood for it if you were to fully give yourself as a sacrifice to God you've got blood for it amen if you were to give a meat offering and give have communion with the Lord there's an offering for it and if you would have peace with God there's a way to have peace with God amen it's through the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah the Bible said he's the once-and-for-all sacrifice he fulfilled all five on the cross I'm about done there was seven statements Jesus spoke from the cross he completely spoke everything you need to say he completed his testimony on the cross by saying seven things on the cross first thing was Father forgive them they don't know what they do verily I say to thee today thou shalt be with me in paradise that's the second thing third thing my God my God why hast thou forsaken me can you believe this Jesus spoke this to the the safe thief and then a few moments later the same thief hears him say my God my God why are you forsaken me Wow so this man saw Jesus is pure humanity right he heard the words of eternal life you'll be with me in paradise and then he hears him crying out to God feel like he's forsaken by God and then he tells John woman or his mother Mary behold thy son and John behold Your Mother then he says I thirst have him fill the Psalms they said father into thy hands I commit my spirit remember Jesus said he said you don't take my life I lay it down in other words I'm ready to give up the ghost now you and I you've heard of people - right you've heard of people that they could they didn't die they hung on because they wanted to hang on they weren't ready to go how many of ever heard of that I've had numerous friends tell me that like they've had loved ones that just wouldn't give up and then someone would just whisper and say what we prayed for you it's okay to go home and then they would die shortly after that not that we have a choice in it but see sometimes our choice has to line up with God's timing that's right but Jesus no man took his life he gave it brother Branham said this means dismiss into thy hands I dismiss my spirit amen and then the last thing he said it's finished praise God alright now I'm just doing one on this I think I think I just got one on here and this is kind of a personal one I just this is why I felt led to preach on this this week eight means eternity or the first day again I kind of mentioned this earlier the future home is like the eighth day it's the first day all over again because the millennium is the seventh day right and then the future home is the eighth day it can also mean new creation or new beginning now if how many one the Bible said be renewed be transformed in the spirit of your mind you have a choice God gives you eight choices that you can think about if you're having mind battles brothers or sisters God gives you eight choices choose any of these eight things and you can have a transformed mind he says finally brethren whatever things are true think about something that's true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report well if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things uh-huh thank you lord so if you want a new a new beginning if you want a fresh start in your mind meditate on things that are true why know this is true don't meditate on well I don't is this pastor a living writer is this person pure or not did this person really say this or this person really do that is this this rumor true we can't meditate on those things we got to meditate on things that are true well here's what I know I'm gonna think about this now if we did more of that right we'd have more transformed minds instead of worrying about well is this gonna happen or we should not worry but we should meditate on things that are a good report well I believe I'll get a good report next Wednesday we're believing for a good report right our sister Tanya's eyes we're believing for a good report for all the things we prayed for tonight we're believing a good report praise God think about those things how many could try to do that this week I'll think about good things brother Jess I'll try I won't try anything about anything evil I'll try think about pure things true things now last one you can spend your free time just closing with this one this is why I felt led to preach this because you know my coach was dying and there's a picture I didn't know this person was taking the picture I didn't know this they sent it to me later every time I would visit him I'd start crying and then you know I didn't know she was taking this picture I didn't say hey take a picture of me kissing the coach I didn't say that she took it and then she emailed or she sent me a text I just was so sad my coach was dying and church I didn't visit him seven times before he died not even six I didn't visit him nine times I visit him eight times now I'm not proper for saying I'm not a prophet what I'm saying is I kept watching each visit I had I would write a Facebook post each visit and I said here's my first visit I don't know how many visits I'd have I thought I'd have more visits but I visited him eight times before he died eight what is eight eternity first day again new creation new beginning now let me say this I hope that's what this means I'm not God I hope but the first three visits I think it was we'll have to look off to look later on Facebook but the first three or four visits I there were so many people around I never could ask him are you trusting in Jesus Christ for salvation there was too many people around they're all gone Pete family are they just joking they just try to the TV's on they're watching football basketball and you know whatever shows on and the Sunday not last Sunday when Troy was here but the Sunday before I got all my knees up here and I said God would you give me a chance to ask him about his soul because I've been turned down like four or five times in a row well that night after church I went to visit him and I got out my phone and I recorded my conversation with him so I'd have a witness and I put it like this I was talking like this but I prayed that morning at church I said God give me the strength to ask and I got a chance I had the phone right there I said John I say can I ask you a personal question I said are you depending on Jesus Christ for salvation he said yes I am he said I am I am now here's a man that's it's Catholic his family said he never missed a Saturday night Mass now we know Mass is wrong we know Katherine Doctrine is wrong I just showed you how the Pope is wrong but I asked him are you trusting in Jesus Christ he said yes and that of course I was so happy I started laughing you know I get when I get her happy I said oh thank you Lord I said John do you love Jesus Christ and he said yes he said I sure do in church I got it right here as soon as those words God his lips somebody walked in and started changing the subject I had just enough time as a matter I think tour two visits later he was dead we don't after this time of this last time and also I pray was God helped me to know is he saved or not help me to know and I found out the night he died I was there 90 minutes before he died 90 minutes and I found out that night he told his priest when his priest came to give him the holy water blessing which you know there's no such thing as holy water we know that the holy water is the Holy Spirit praise God but he told his priest he said he said I was so faithful what he was telling the preteen and say that but he was so faithful he read his Bible every morning and every night he said he read his Bible 25 times now how many message people do you know who read their Bible 25 times now church I heard cussed though I heard him cussed a few weeks before he died now he's you know not real bad words but he still cost and that's why I was praying God helped me to just hear this witness help me to hear this testimony that at least he's trusting in you and so 90 minutes before he died I read 2nd Timothy 4 where it says my time of my departure is at hand I fought a good fight I've run the race I finished the course and then 90 minutes later he passed away and I didn't know that I thought maybe I'd see him again but I just felt led of the Holy Spirit to say that now look what brother Adam says if a Roman Catholic if he's depending on the Roman Catholic Church which is their fundamental doctrine but if he believes that that the Catholic Church is gonna save him he's lost but if he's got faith in Jesus Christ God's Son and depending on him for salvation he saved now God is my witness I didn't remember this quote when I went to go talk to him the Holy Spirit just had me ask her who are you depending on Jesus Christ for salvation and he said yes God knows God knows my heart I did not have this court in mind in fact cam sent me this later him my brother and I see the see the Holy Spirit just inspired me to ask him uh who are you depending in Christ now if he'd have been a real Catholic he said no I'm saved by the church I don't say by the rosary he said I'm depending in Jesus Christ for my salvation he said yes I am he said I am I am alright I'll stop right there now I come here now my church that's why I went to eight I thought that is so striking eight eight why eight visits why eight not to me I'm just trusting that now now these passed on he's got a new beginning and he's got a he's got a theophany body I'm just trusting in that could I be wrong certainly but I'm not God but why did God allow me eight times to visit him and why he God answered my prayer so all those other times I couldn't have any conversations with him one on one but that one Sunday night everybody left and I had my five minutes and I didn't know it why did God allow that well I'm believing because I prayed a prayer of faith and I believe I'll see him again in good standing not bad standing that's what I'm trusting in church I'm trusting in the grace of Jesus Christ tonight now what's interesting is that at the end of his teaching career his last year was my last high school year we both went out at the same time and my brothers and I we took him out on top because we were state champions my junior year in state run or state runner-up my senior year we took him out on top he hung her around a little bit longer he worked three extra years in order to go out on top and we were the ones at the end of his career he stayed around to be with us to go out on top and now look at the end of his life I'm not saying I'm anybody special you know I'm not at the end of his life and there at the end of his career God brings me back I'm the only one close to him of all the thousands of people he's taught I am the only one there at the end of his life in church I believe it was because of this because Jesus Christ said he that confesses me before men I'll confess him before the Holy Angels glory so he could go out in salvation that's what I believe I could be wrong but why eight sister Connie y8y eight visits why would I cried pray God just give me at five minutes to talk to him then God would honor my prayer why why and I live I'm the only one of all his students he hung around for me to go out on top and God sends me at the end of his life I believe to go home and be saved was he perfect no far from it but church if we look at ourselves are we perfect all the time far from can we live a higher life of course can we live a sanctified life without custom sir sir we believe all the word do we go same we say Hail Marys and go to masses no we don't but are you saved by your works or you saved by grace I'm saved by grace that's why I love what brother Branham said they said brother Ram were all Trinitarians lost he said of course not I believe they're saved he said but it's just time now where they need to know where the truth it's time to tell them the truth that's what I've been writing Facebook post about the Trinity I've been blasting the Trinity the last 12 days on Facebook I'm get thongs up and a men's loves
