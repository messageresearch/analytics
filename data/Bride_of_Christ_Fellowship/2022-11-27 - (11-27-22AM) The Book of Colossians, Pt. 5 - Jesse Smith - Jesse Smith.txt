========================================

continue that Series this morning and Lord willing tonight you know either do the kids Bible study or we can preach another sermon God's grace but we'll I'll try to watch the time then for communion by the grace of the Lord Colossians chapter 2 verse 1 we'll read verses 1 2 and 3 by the help of the Lord Hallelujah Colossians chapter 2 verse 1. I'll read verse one and then we can all read verse two and three together a little bit a little bit more reading but trust me a blessing to you this morning by God's grace verse one says for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh verse two let's begin that on three one two three that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all Riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge praise God how many believe that that every Treasure of wisdom and knowledge is in Christ Jesus praise God any treasure you're searching for in your life any great uh any great thing you can attain to in life it's all hid in one place in Christ and notice it said hid that gives you a good understanding you have to search for it yeah let's have one more word of prayer if we can hear by God's grace Heavenly Father we just come reverently and we ask that the great Holy Spirit Lord will do what only he can do Lord God I am nothing the people here we're all nothing of our own selves but Lord you did Place gifts inside of our lives and those gifts are special powers the the Greek says the Lord God special abilities where Lord if we if we can yield to your spirit Lord you can use those special abilities so Lord we just trust that the Holy Spirit Lord will be pleased with our worship forgive us of any sin any evil words any evil thoughts any evil Deeds Lord God forgive us oh God forgive me your humble servant Lord I realize I'm nothing Lord and without you we can do nothing but with you Lord we're more than conquerors with you Lord we can say greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world Hallelujah the great one is in us today so Lord move through us and minister to each one today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God okay so we'll try to preach an hour here we'll see how that goes and uh and then we will try to have communion here I think it's a good idea so thanks hun that's a good idea I appreciate that I didn't think about that so we'll start here in Colossians chapter two I'll do a little review you know um I haven't preached on this subject since September and uh you have a lot of subjects on my heart it's the trouble is just always finding what what to preach because there is so much to preach like as I said on Wednesday the Bible is so concentrated you know this one scripture can have so much so many Deep Thoughts in it and then it could be even compound prophetic on top of that it can apply to one generation and then a future generation so we're thankful for God's grace I'm glad it's that way praise God I'm I'm glad we're not just I don't have nothing to preach or we have nothing to read we have nothing I'm glad there's so much truth that every time we go back there's another there's another meal waiting for us praise God hallelujah I'm very thankful for that by God's grace so let's look at part five here of the book of Colossians you can switch over how to govern a few quotes to a few scriptures to show uh we'll begin looking at this thought here today you know I was thinking that quote from Brother bran I mean he says Jesus Christ should be the Principal theme of our living of our speaking of our acting of our entire lives and he said if you don't see Jesus Christ in every verse go back and read it again amen so how many times have we read the book of Colossians or you know just any book in general I believe it behooves us to go back and read it again and no doubt we'll see more of Christ in there Hallelujah so that's what we want to do today we want to look here uh to the book of Colossians I'm going to do a quick review and uh I I want to if I want to look here uh actually verse 2 of chapter one and just remember who this was written to this book was written to the Saints so that means to the separated ones and look how you are all separated ones you've separated yourself from the worldly endeavors that's just for today but your whole life you separated yourself from the influence of sin so this is clearly true clearly proves we are the Saints how our lives proves we are separated from the things of the world Hallelujah like that song says the things I used to do I do them no more the light that I used to live I don't live that anymore praise God I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man old things have passed away I've been born again more than a conqueror that's what I am Hallelujah I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man hallelujah thank God Amen that he makes all things new Hallelujah you know there was a time I'm sure you remember as a sinner there's a Time Church wasn't new there was a time in your life probably Church wasn't the best part of your week I can remember that quite well for 19 years Church wasn't the best part of my life but for all these years since praise God these 23 years since church has been the greatest part of my life amen never gets old Hallelujah yes we got to press through the flesh we've got to press through the trials and press through the Mind battles and press through the sickness but if we can just press beyond that Hallelujah we can enter into the anointing of the Lord praise God and we can say like David my cup is not half full my cup isn't empty my cup runs over praise God I'm looking for a running over Cup today amen hallelujah thank God Amen let us have that a cup that runs over with the joy of the Lord amen but the victory of Christ Jesus our lord but verse 2 says to the Saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at colossi Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ now that's interesting they're they're Saints they are faithful Saints as well Hallelujah and that's what I appreciate you you all of you for being faithful praise God I'm to worry is he going to be here today is she going to be here today am I going to hear from them or not you know I don't have that we don't have those issues praise God hallelujah because we have faithful Saints Hallelujah faithful Brethren that are separated to the uh the the doctrine of Christ you know in fact you're so faithful you would probably come here sick if we didn't ask you to come right you probably spread it all around right you spread all your signals all around if we didn't ask you to maybe use caution sometimes make sure you're letting the Holy Spirit praise God that's how we've gotten all sick in the past you know we've we've sometimes been together and we've been so faithful that we wouldn't miss it for the world praise God you wouldn't miss gathering with the Saints and being with God's people I just think it's you know also as we get more or as we review some of these thoughts I think it's beautiful that Paul wishes them Grace and peace I remember this was a church that would likely be re or be destroyed by an earthquake in less than 10 years but Paul's wishing them Grace and peace Hallelujah and yet God knew and this will I want to get to this eventually God never warned them of the earthquake in this letter he never warned him because the natural disasters pale in comparison to spiritual disasters that people can face praise God like we preached that sermon with the 13 metaphors of a Judas Iscariot that type of Destruction or that type of Shipwrecked is way worse than a natural earthquake or a natural shipwreck or a natural car accident the spiritual destruction the spiritual Shipwrecked is way worse because there's Eternal consequences to that but a natural disaster or a car accident or a earthquake or tsunami or something you can clean up from that you can recover from that if you survive right but if it's a Judas Iscariot and someone uh crosses the line between mercy and judgment there's no coming back for that as the Bible said with Esau he sought it with tears but he couldn't find it so that means he had worldly sorrow he didn't have Godly sorrow right like like the book of Corinthians speaks about like Judas he had worldly sorrow well I should not have betrayed an innocent man but Godly sorrow would have been said would have said Jesus Take Me Back praise God Hallelujah try me again I want to come back have mercy on me but see it wasn't the right kind of Sorrow and so we have to understand that that God's grace and his peace is probably one of the most valuable things we can have in this life because as we can see the world is falling apart around us every day every week every month every year it's falling apart more and more uh at a at a more deceptive rate or at a more at a faster rate we'd say and it's actually more deceptive than ever this is the most deceptive time to live and so we know that we preached on that but let's just review The Colossus background again so here this is the ancient city of colossi remember uh it's 100 miles from Ephesus and 12 miles from laodicea it's it's unexcavated they haven't dug it up uh there it is on the map of modern day Turkey of Ephesus laodicea and then colossi is quite close to that so just as an idea again of that uh now they they became famous because they could make purple wool that's how they became a great City um kind of like Lydia was a seller of purple you know uh in the the city of Philippi but also colossi also adopted a similar practice and that's how they became wealthy and they became an important Roman uh Roman city on a route here of course the the history says the city was an important stop on a major Roman trade route because Rome was ruling the world at that time naturally now they're ruling it spiritually now it was destroyed by an earthquake between 60 and 62 A.D less than a decade after receiving Paul's letter now here's what I found out today I was reading today it was actually rebuilt but it never revived to its original state so it's as if God you know shook that City literally God literally shook that City in order to shake it spiritually and then by by the year 400 it was no longer a city it's the pile of ruins that it was and so we see again that that that rule that God has a time and season for everything the Bible says we have no continuing City here I don't care how fancy New York looks there's gonna of course it's Fallen apart now because in leadership they got I don't care how big you know Los Angeles looks or or Hong Kong or any of those cities we don't have a continuing City they're going to fall apart if time goes on they're gonna have to rebuild and eventually God's gonna start all over again and renovate the whole outside of the earth and God's going to create a civilization that's built on righteousness amen and Jesus Will Rule Every Nation with a rod of iron amen but these are reminders church we should take this as a reminder all of your possessions someday might be a mound of dirt all the work we've done at our house in Doylestown one day it might be just a mound of dirt in fact we drive by houses right on our road used to be beautiful houses but then they knocked them all down and now it's literally just a pile of rocks at one time it was a nice house but because it didn't take care of it or maybe there was mold there or something they let it go and it became now all it is it's not even a mound it's a pile of rocks not even a mound of dirt like the Bible says let us not boast of Tomorrow praise God amen let us be confident in the word of God that he's spoken to us today praise God and let us seek God's Mercy For Today Hallelujah amen just a great reminder here that all great things in the eyes of man come to an end and the word of the Lord endures forever praise God I love it colossi the whole cities in this pile ruins but here we are we got the word of God preserved today praise God Hallelujah the earthquake could destroy this and time could destroy the city but the word of God stands stronger than ever praise God Eternal as ever it's as faithful as ever praise God let's put our hope and our trust in Jesus Christ amen the word of God remember these Saints never saw Paul's face just like our church and our prophet yet we can still be Believers Hallelujah we can still manifest Jesus Christ for our day it was likely epperphress started this ministry and was composed of Gentiles and Jews and you'll see that you know the the composition of the church determined what they struggle with and you're going to see that in this chapter we probably won't get to it today but let me just say that for us the composition of our church is going to determine what we struggle with now because and culturally now I'm talking about culturally Jews and gentiles now all of us are Gentiles but we come from different backgrounds I don't think bang would mind me sharing this but you know with his parents in Laos they had a lot of superstitions right he wouldn't mind me saying that does that bother you brother it don't bother him just honestly they have honest superstitions like they'll kill certain animals and they'll believe if you do certain things you know you get there's certain results but it's not led by Christianity or it's not led by the spirit of God it's led by superstition you know and because of our backgrounds and because of our our ethnic backgrounds it determines a lot of our attitudes about God we keep some we all of us keep feelings and memories from our past right and so how we were raised is going to determine how the enemy May battle us today and you'll see that in chapter two Paul has to lay out all these uh doctrines that they're battling all these ideas uh that they're battling now for us I'm looking at Emma and I'm thinking about me and Emma you know how we grew up in you know Emma's my niece and we all grew up in the liver Center area we basically grew up in modern day laodicea farm farm town you know and so you know our battles are going to be more intellectual because we were raised in an intellectual sit style right like now bang that was more spiritual right his parents were raised in a more spiritual they believe in superstitions and and you'll see that exact thing in Colossians chapter two Colossians chapter 2 is a beautiful chapter as we're getting going to get into it um it's actually where I preach Christmas out of the the place where I find this Christmas in the Bible is Colossians chapter 2 of all places I'm talking about the modern Christmas you know how how people uh worship at Christmas time or don't worship at Christmas time uh but you know Apple fris had visited colossi come and told Paul how Paul was in prison told him about all the heresies they were battling and so Paul wrote the letter to bring them correction the city church and I'm just kind of preaching off the cuff here a little bit but you know there's times if you see somebody struggling and you know somebody else could help them you should let them know epipheris a preacher let Paul know and then Paul as the Apostle they never even met Paul but they knew about Paul Paul sends a letter to correct them so that there's a fine line between tattling on somebody or gossiping about somebody but but then sharing something that they might get help for it that's what I've you know I've counseled with amen numerous times over the years and other of you as well or sometimes we have to talk about specific struggles we have or struggles in the church we we do that though of course very carefully but we have to do it if we do it with the spirit of Christ it's done in the right way like the the saying I always say is I want to say something about somebody as if they're standing right here now we don't want to do it all the time but there's times you might have to do that the same thing happened to the Corinthian Church they told Paul about all the struggles and Paul had to write them a letter rebuke them and and uh think about the attitude you know they could have had a bad attitude against you know the person who shared with Paul they could have said oh you're telling my troubles you're you're telling my struggles now it's never good to gossip it's never good to gossip but if you know you can help them and you're led by the Holy Spirit and love to share about a person's weaknesses in order that might be helped that could that could be the spirit of God you have to look at the fruits of it what comes out of it amen does good fruit come out of it does repentance come out of it praise God what is the fruit that comes out of it because uh that's what Jesus says wisdom is Justified of her fruits just so you know I'm not telling anybody to gossip I'm just saying there's times where you need to share something with somebody in order that they might someone else might help the person you see as you see a person in need that's why you know over the years I've asked Beau and Adam and amen and who are different ones you know do you have any neighbors I think I've asked Bank do you have any neighbors that need any food for Christmas or Thanksgiving or do anybody who's struggling it's not that I want to know people struggling it's not that I want to know you know details about people's lives but I want to help people praise God and if you know anybody who can help out let's help them out by the grace of God so I just think it's a an important point to stay in here that Paul never met them Paul didn't know their struggles but he was informed of their struggles and the spirit of God led him to discern their struggles right he knew about it and then write the word of God to them praise God and church don't ever underestimate the power of a letter Hallelujah how many can raise your hand say uh uh someone's written them a letter before it's been very powerful to them anybody can say that okay a couple people praise God that think about that that's all the church had at colossi was a letter you know of course they have the spirit of God but then the letter and the spirit of God had to come quick in that letter and that letter would build them up in Christ words on a page amen words on a scroll written words amen the word came to anoint the written word praise God the word Jesus Christ the spirit of Jesus Christ the Eternal one the eternal spirit praise God came to anoint the written word the Eternal Word Quicken the written word and that quickened the Believers amen Glory that's how I know if I preach this today if you're a Believer and the spirit of God is in you and the spirit of God is in me it will Quicken your mortal body praise God and you can leave out of here a quick in person moved and quickened if I can use brother Brian's title there he got it from another brother too so I'm going to use it as well you know I could borrow from the other other guy he got it from but see I noticed this the Holy Ghost never warned them about the earthquake he just warned them about false Doctrine why because you can recover from an earthquake you can't recover from false Doctrine it's a it's 11 right it's a canker it's a cancer and you can't recover from it so the Holy Ghost never said well in about three years everybody wants to move out of the city you're going to lose your homes you're going to lose all you work for can you imagine that some of them saints probably lost everything they work for but really that's not what they were working for your Treasures are not on this Earth Amen in fact that's what he tells him in chapter three set your affections on things above oh now I can see why I did it amen now I can see why set your affection on things above because there's a coming earthquake think about the earthquake coming to Los Angeles there's a coming earthquake do not set your affections on Earthly things keep your eyes on Jesus amen keep your sight on Christ Hallelujah keep looking to him keep looking to the sky keep looking for the Rapture praise God keep looking for his mercies because he comes so all those that look for him and love him Hallelujah see a spiritual disaster far outweighs any natural disaster we might go through I think churches we get more mature in Christ as we get older in Christ we realize losing Natural Things is really no no big deal the the you know the debts we may have financially the what we don't have physically that bothers us less as we mature in Christ because we realize it's all perishing anyway I think the word is fleeting the Bible because these are all fleeting things they're all vain things right it's all vanity the natural things we're talking about but the spiritual things are what we labor for praise God the spiritual Rewards are what we live for and the Bible is Jesus says you store up Treasures in Heaven praise God Hallelujah so yeah that was that was an interesting thought I had I felt it was led by the Holy Spirit to share with you now remember the purpose is brother Raymond had a vision and he saw all these comments running to him and he says does every leader have to be judged like Paul he said yes he said if Paul's group goes in Soul of mine because I preach exactly the same word the water baptism and the millions screamed out we're resting on that he said if I had only known this before I come I would make people come here I wish we could make people come here I always be good my goodness but see we're resting on what Paul preached because Paul said God will judge all of our hearts think about that God will judge all the secrets of our hearts by Jesus Christ according to the book of Colossians right Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians Romans right Hebrews Thessalon Thessalonians the Lehman all these books Titus God is going to judge The Seekers of our hearts by Jesus Christ according to the word of God okay so for resting on Paul's gospel we didn't know what he said and I think this chapter is a beautiful chapter here um because Paul wrote the whole Council of God and you'll see some of the things they battled I preached this one in Indiana just a reminder brother Branham said of course thus saith the Lord says thus saith Malachi chapter 4. he said he will turn the hearts of the children back to the doctrine of the fathers back to the Bible out of these denominational difference come back to the Bible back to God that's what he would do notice what a great time we're living I'm gonna believe it's a great time to live praise God I believe any time I'm still alive is a great time Hallelujah could I get another chance to serve Jesus amen now remember the outline here chapter one the outline was Paul's Apostolic reading and then his beautiful prayer remember he prayed for five things for the Saints it's probably the most beautiful prayer I've ever read in the Bible that there's five things he prayed you have all the wisdom and the Revelation and and long-suffering and Thanksgiving it was just such a beautiful prayer when we preached that and then he looked at the Supreme deed of Christ that we looked at the power of Christ and then we saw the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory it works in us mightily think about that church the world just goes along with the flow of of a stream think about a stream the world is like those leaves they just get pulled but we are going against the grain how much more strength does it take to go against the grain praise God we're not being carried away on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas Hallelujah see you got to understand whenever you go against the grain God is working and you mightily praise God whenever you go against the grain or the wave of laodicea and you fight against that and you try to draw closer to Christ you're making progress it might be slow progress but you're not being Carried Away by hell amen you're making progress It's Working you mightily you're going against all the demons out of hell you're going against every Temptation you're living you're you're you're you're you're you're living a life free from deception you see the reality of the Bible the reality of God the reality of Christ amen the reality of the Rapture praise God you see the reality of it praise God and it's God working in you not a small thing but a mighty thing amen It's mighty praise God the word of God works in us mightily praise God now in chapter two we'll get probably just a verse seven we'll probably just get to there and then maybe Wednesday or we'll see however the Lord leads me I never quite know exactly what I'm going to preach I want to preach on uh over stimulation maybe tonight I want to preach on that because I feel like we're always over stimulated by cell phones I kind of want to look at cell phones tonight if I can maybe by God's grace like I said maybe we might do a kids Bible study or we can do a kids Bible study on that um but chapter two has the this was our text verses one to three the treasures in the mystery of the godhead um and then notice Paul after these after this beautiful introduction after this prayers and all the work of the Cross and the baptism Holy Ghost and all the Treasures of the godhead then he starts getting into what they're battling they're battling enticing words and notice they weren't battling riches they weren't battling a physical Army of Roman soldiers that wasn't this Church's battle the church's battle with smooth talkers enticing deceiving speakers Church you got to be real careful who you listen to yeah right you better be very careful you listen to you got to make sure people aren't deceiving you into a sinful habit or a sinful lifestyle I've got to constantly watch my life as well praise God we all have to watch our lives but here's the advice the Holy Ghost will give a church less than 10 years before their Church would be destroyed likely what advice would you give somebody if they had just a certain number of years to live or a certain number of years to have prosperity Paul the advice he gives them is overcome evil spirits and then he gets into some of the specifics philosophy legalism mysticism and I don't even know how to say that ascetism is how you say ascetism I was looking up the definitions earlier um we'll get into each one here as we go on by God's grace but let's look at this verses one to three here I'm already at uh 25 minutes hard to believe that I guess that's my normal uh background right that's my normal review let me review for just a minute this is 25 minutes what can I do but I added some new stuff in there too bye guys Grace The Treasure of the mystery of the godhead verse one for I would that ye knew so Paul wishes they knew something Paul wish these Believers could feel his great conflict that he has for them kind of like I wish you how much I cared about you I've never met you I've never seen you face to face but I wish you knew how much I cared and not just for you but them at laodicea so see a real Christian cares about all the people of God praise God now of course there's going to be ones that are closer to us those are the ones that are going to mean the most to us you know we're gonna have more interaction with them we can help them out more um but Paul's heart was not just for the church at colossi it was also for the church at laodicea and he said and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh so Paul had a great burden for all those who never got to meet him so in other words other preachers had preached to these churches and started the churches but they never got to meet the prophet of the hour they never got to meet the messenger of the hour but I love it the messenger's heart was still with them he was so thankful there was churches there he prayed for them amen hallelujah like he told the Philippians he said I every time I think of you he's every time I remember you I give thanks to God hallelujah upon every remembrance of you I feel about all you and amen on his birthday amen every time I think of you I say thank God for a saint like that Hallelujah thank God for a friend thank God for a Christian that will stand on God's word hallelujah there are few and far between we saw the Baptist Church last week or two weeks yeah last week we see they're a few and far between Pastor said the numbers are dwindling and uh yeah that's what all the research says churchgoer church then this is going down I showed you that article a few months ago about that by I think 2040. um I forget the exact number on it I think it was by 2035 or or 2040 Christianity will no longer be the majority religion in the United States I think uh I think atheism is going to take it over if I'm not mistaken see it's we have to battle the intellectual sphere right that's what we got to battle the intellectual uh spirit so that means we've got to have a spiritual mind praise God we have to be in contact with the Holy Spirit praise God to overcome these spiritual intellectual battles but the word conflict means a fight so this is quite a word Paul Paul wishes they knew the great fight he was fighting for them and of course it hadn't been in prayer because he never met them this is the only letter that we know that he wrote him so he says I wish you knew how I was fighting for you in prayer amen and then of course Paul was praying for them regarding the evils that he's going to write about okay and so this gives us a lesson too you can have family and friends you don't see all the time that doesn't stop you and I from praying for them praise God just because we're not with somebody just go just because we don't see somebody doesn't mean we shouldn't have a burn for them right and Paul as an example he said in first Timothy chapter one his life was an example to all other Christians amen you might persecute the church you might blaspheme against Jesus he said but God save me God had abundant mercy on me so that I might be a pattern to all those who would accept Christ afterwards see church that's why I love that song I can pray to the walls come down if there's nothing else you can do or I can do we can pray Hallelujah and that's where Paul says I wish you knew the fight I was fighting for you in prayer and of course he's going to get bring some rebukes on here in this chapter and a lot of wisdom as well but see this is the so what does that mean church that means we got to have an attitude of battle when it comes to prayer now God help all of us on that let's just be honest there we get so tired I get I don't know about you I'm just speaking for my own experience I get so tired just from life just living life I get mentally tired and physically tired sometimes I don't go into prayer with a with a Warrior's mindset you know rebuking principalities or rebuking Satan and Satan get behind me Church let's be honest sometimes we go we don't go into prayer with that attitude but Paul said I've got a great burden to pray for you and I'm taking A Warrior's attitude amen hallelujah you'll be able you haven't seen my face but I'm trusting you'll see the face of Christ amen hallelujah the face of the Holy Spirit praise God I trust you see that he said I've been fighting a good fight of faith for you Hallelujah praise the Lord now verse 2 he said I so he says I wish you knew the great fight now verse two that their hearts might be comfortable so this is what he is fighting for he was fighting in prayer that the Colossians heart might be comforted which means edified or strengthened I was looking up right before I come up I didn't get a chance to write that one down and they would be knit together in love and unto or going towards all the riches of the full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ so he was fighting for their loving Unity now of course here's knit in the Greek it means coalesce to join together to unite or knit together to put together one's mind I'm going to go down that third definition to unite with one another in a conclusion or come to the same opinion amen to prove to demonstrate to teach to instruct Hallelujah Paul says I'm praying that your hearts will be knit together that your mind and my mind and in your mind all of our minds will be as one mind praise God and he was willing think about that he was willing to fight in prayer so they would have one heart and one mind praise God a church honestly a lot of times I'm sure you and I we pray for the Natural Things natural things God help us get well you know help us to not get sick you know help us God help us with the financial needs but Paul is praying God let their hearts be United as one that's right may they have the same heart may they have the same desire as one another Lord please keep them from being divided help them to be United together may they have hearts that are knit together in the love of God I think that's a beautiful prayer don't you that's why I love reading this because it brings a refreshing of what I should be praying for and what all of us should be praying for the most important things we should pray for Paul lays it out right here amen that we'll be loving Christians amen we'll be a family of God we'll have one motive one objective praise God one Mission amen and one Victory and that's that we all have hearts full of love and we manifest the love of Jesus Christ to each and every person Glory of course it's the same Unity from the day of Pentecost remember the Bible said they were one of before the Holy Ghost fell for ten days they were in one Accord the Bible says and then the day of caught the day of Pentecost they were in one Accord in one place amen then the Holy Ghost fell hallelujah praise God thank God and then afterwards in Acts chapter 4 the Bible said they had one heart and one Soul praise God and that's when they started selling things to make sure everybody had of course they had some rich Christians right they could sell their whole lands well I only have one land you know these guys had multiple lands to sell I guess I could sell a little plot of my land but be a real small plot don't even own an acre you know but these almost had some rich Christians in there some Jews who got the Holy Ghost they sell some of their lands and they say give this to the the church give it to the people so they can feed the widows they don't have food every day praise God so that's what the same spirit of God does to our hearts it makes our hearts like one heart all of our hearts have the same heartbeat wouldn't that be something Hallelujah we all have the same spiritual heartbeat do the will of God do the will of God do the will of God Hallelujah pray for Unity pray for Unity pray for God's love you know we got the same heartbeat praise God is our brother okay is our sister okay how's everybody doing does anybody need anything you know the same heartbeat praise God but see only God can do that only Jesus can do that only Jesus can sow us together if we do it ourselves it'll probably fall apart right but if Jesus sows it together Hallelujah then it's going to be perfect Hallelujah thank God and I want to break down some of these words here so this strengthened uh and unify these strengthened loving unified hearts would produce the riches or the wealth so see what see what loving each other does loving each other produces riches it produces wealth how many want to be spiritually wealthy notice I said spiritually if you want to be spiritually wealthy then let your heart be knit by the holy spirit with the other believer's hearts that is the way that's the path it's like an equation right be unified in one heart and if you do that plus God God and that will equal spiritual wealth oh hallelujah amen thank God Amen and then that produces when you're spiritually wealthy this produces full Assurance of understanding it's when you love me when we love each other like a family it gives us spiritual riches we're rich in spiritual things and then that gives us a certain confidence amen of understanding so see where confidence comes knowing that God loves you and you're going to be saved and you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you're going the Rapture where does this come from it comes from the love of God knitting your heart amen but you got to submit to that you and I have to submit to that we have to let God help us to love each other more praise God and loving each other more produces this confidence it doesn't produce a doubt the love of God produces confidence that we know absolutely the understanding of Jesus Christ so the more love we have for one another the more we treat one another with love the more certain we'll be of what we believe and what God is going to do praise God oh it's beautiful the more wealthy we are Hallelujah right we can all we should all take a moment here today to check our spiritual bank accounts I check my natural one every day except Sunday I don't check Sunday right because their banks are closed on Saturday night you know so I don't check Sunday but I make sure nobody's I've had we've had our uh account you know hacked many times my goodness probably 10 times maybe more so I gotta check it every day but just like you check your natural we're checking up our spiritual today as well Hallelujah because if we're lacking anything it's because of love we have to love one another that will produce the spiritual riches this will produce a confidence amen a certain confidence Hallelujah and understanding about God oh thank God beautiful now notice this understanding leads to the acknowledgment or the precise and correct knowledge of the mystery of the God isn't this interesting Paul ties in love with spiritual riches confidence and it gives us the understanding of God and the godhead genuine love leads to understanding and knowing god because God is love amen hallelujah he that loveth not noeth not God Amen Hallelujah for God is love amen something like that Sunday school song beloved let us love one another first John 4 7 today all right that old Sunday school song we used to sing well I sing it I don't know about be private sang it here we probably need to sing it here okay so that's a good thought there let's sing that one maybe tonight genuine love leads to knowing god and having God's riches in your life praise God spiritual wealth Hallelujah in church this is all in verses one and two all this is just in the first two verses I haven't even got the verse three yet my goodness is it something like this is I told you this is so concentrated it's like kind of like a orange or like a rag that's wet you know you keep squeezing more and more comes out it's like our rags run up it's like God's word just get keep coming more like oh my goodness I thought I was out of orange juice there's it just keeps coming this thing is so there's so much in there praise God that's how it is and Paul lays it out this is foolishness to the world but to the believer this is spiritual riches hallelujah amen this is eternal life amen foolishness to the world but this is the wisdom of God to the believer Hallelujah now this is when I when I when I went to the funeral two weeks ago I did share with the former pastor and his wife and different members thank you for the degree of love that I felt because they did a good job loving us you know as I said we were poor and sometimes our electric would get shut off right in the middle of winter or Heating and the church would come in sometimes and pay for that sometimes other people donated to our family and then you know uh they my former Pastor would take us out to eat on Sunday it was all all you can eat at Wendy's you know fast food it wasn't healthy at all of course you know but we didn't care we didn't even know about organic food at that time you know all we knew about was our stomachs are growling and we need to eat you know got four or five teenagers and we're hungry you know and and I was talking to him about that thanking him for that and so I told him I you know in my in my mind I thought wow I felt a degree of Love here uh but I just as one example there wasn't a degree of love to go further and tell us the truth about certain things like tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost right and that women ought not to wear makeup and Men ought not to wear it either I'll start preaching out that dude because the way this world's going man and wait a minute I have to change our video to make up men and women in the Bible you know men should not wear makeup but I we could see a degree of love where they took care of our natural needs but really Church it with all the grace of God and love for these people they didn't give us the love of God with the spiritual needs like they didn't say you should get rid of your TV and I'll say it again we should get rid of our TVs we should get rid of our smartphones if it's causing us to stumble if we cannot if we like the Bible said if we aren't snared by these things you've got to get rid of the snare right you've got to get rid of snare I've known two or three grown men uh older than me one's older one younger actually that have gotten rid of their smartphones and gone back to the flip phones I admire that I think that's a great thing to do because like I said I've run into four people that have uh porn problems in the last two three months because of their cell phones and some say it's not just full-blown videos it's just those little gifts or GIFs or just still pictures or whatever it is or Instagram or uh some of them do like uh comments and they just whoever's there I don't know if it's a robot or something but they're texting back and forth with inappropriate conversations sexual conversations see it's it's it's it's a it's more deceptive how many times church I was thinking about this morning how many times have I picked this up to do something good but then I get distracted by something and I forget the good I wanted to do like I want to text Brother Austin or that I forget I'll just pick it up oh there's a notification I I forgot the whole reason I picked it up what did I what did I do this for because then you get to that and then to that app and then that that that this app it's challenging it's the challenge of the hour but I'll tell you if we got the love of God it's going to help us have spiritual riches amen God's love will help us on these issues amen amen and memories I'm gonna preach on this maybe later I want to revisit the fear of the Lord uh the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the Lord is to hate evil and in a in a in a wealthy prosperous Nation like United States sometimes we lose the fear of the Lord because we got everything everything We're Not Afraid now think about we're not afraid of food running out because it's always there at the grocery store every time we go there they go now sometimes they're missing our favorite vegetable cilantro sometimes they're missing my favorite kombucha but like we're trained here in America every time we go it's there we got it we got it and we lose the fear of God now God was with Israel if they didn't obey they weren't getting the rain they weren't getting their kombucha you know what I mean they weren't getting their wine they weren't getting their favorite vegetables it was more based on that but we're in a different age we're different people and so we need reminders to fear God and to hate evil praise God and to love righteousness and to love each other amen hallelujah that's why I'm glad amen preached on that Brother season so you better now you're giving me inspiration for weeks in advance here see it's true I mean Love Is The Love is the whole Center of Christian Life it's the whole the whole goal because God is love so see just in these first two verses here after you know Paul goes through the cross and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the godhead these great Mysteries he brings actually back to the godhead through the love of God if you love each other you'll have an understanding of God I hope you feel this way I believe I know God greater today than I ever have I know that his character I know the things he does I know his patterns and the church said right you that's how it should be but you'd be surprised how many people don't know and they'll say oh God always wants to heal or God always wants to save or God always wants to do this or always God always wants to be prosperous that shows they don't know God very well but you and I have the pleasure of knowing god in truth the Bible says see we know his character like like let me give you an example like when Austin uh we prayed for his grandma his grandma got a good report right well all of a sudden it switched like I was shouting rejoicing I even wrote it on my paper at home as a testimony Austin's grandma was healed praise the Lord within one week she was had a terminal uh sickness and then die within two weeks well think about that that didn't make me upset with God like God you owe me an understanding I was like well God you give and take away and God you gave her a second chance you gave her two extra weeks to live but see without that understanding we could get bitter against God see we in other words we learn to deal with God's different times and seasons we can love God in the good times amen we can love God in the hard times amen but we keep coming back to God because God keeps pouring out his blessings amen he keeps pouring out his word his promises they're certain praise God they're unfailing Promises of God hallelujah amen that's just one example where look we have the character to understand well we thought we got thought God was going to do something but no God is going to change it and God is the author of all of it how many believe God's the author and finisher of your faith that means he's author and finisher of Austin's Grandma's face as long as they're a Believer right as long as they accept faith he's the author and finisher of it and he'll he'll take whatever place they give Jesus if you give Jesus first place he'll be first in your life amen hallelujah he'll take second though like we got a family member in the message for 40 years but they admitted it before they left they admitted Jesus was never number one in their life family was number one they admitted that to me so you can sit in a message to church brother William said in a message to church for over 40 years this family sat there for over 40 years for some raised in it but see the eventually the truth is going to come out eventually we're going to see what fruits your tree's producing may God help us to always put Jesus number one in our lives so we have the real fruit the real riches amen ah there it is the real wealth of Jesus Amen which is love well if I love you I'm going to come see you glory on Sunday on Wednesday sometimes other times during the week if I love you I'm going to come fellowship with you praise God that's why people don't come Fellowship anymore they don't love us but see we love each other we still love them right we pray for them but it's the love of God how can we stay apart our hearts are knit together amen how can I stay apart from you brother bang my heart is knitted with yours amen my heart's a new with the birthday boy today right the birthday girl yesterday our hearts are knit how can we stay away from each other we're just drawn to one another because God has unified our hearts together he's placed them together how could we stay apart that means when the enemy comes in with with doubt or anger or jealousy against a saint of God or something you just you just you extinguish that with the shield of faith you just hold up that shield and that fiery Dart is extinguished distinguished right there extinguished rather not distinguished extinguished you just hold up that she'll say no Satan not today I like those coffee cups not today Satan because not today Satan my heart is going to be knitted to my family in Christ Hallelujah Glory thank God Amen now let's summarize these first two verses now Paul's great fight was to see the believer's heart knit together in love this love then would produce full Assurance riches and understanding of God now the opposite is true as well this Unity produces doubt in someone's walk with God and it also produces idolatry three persons right but see the people that believe in three persons almost always have other Idols in their life because they've already accepted a three-person Idol right so the opposite is true I think it's beautiful Paulie's Paul connects the godhead with your loved one for another if you truly love the family of God he says you'll know God you have spiritual riches and you'll acknowledge the mystery of God you'll acknowledge that godhead God is one person God is love but the opposite is true if people don't really labor to love one another they don't try really with all their hearts to love one another there'll be disunity and they'll doubt their experience with God am I really saved am I really filled with the Holy Ghost really sincere am I really a child of God does God really love me see all this doubt but the more you love amen the more you love each other praise God the more certain it becomes Hallelujah this is all in the first two verses see certainty God wants you to feel certain God doesn't want you to doubt the future God wants you to be certain about the future and the way to get that is through loving the family of God that will produce spiritual wealth and those spiritual wealth the spiritual wealth is is then certain it's absolute certainty about God and about your walk with the Lord praise God I'm almost at an hour I'm at 50 minutes so this is going pretty good I think I'm going pretty good here by God's grace you know I was wondering what to preach and I opened my Bible app on my iPad actually and had a big big picture the book of Colossians read this for the month of November so I thought that's a pretty good sign I should preach that today but you know Church think about the colossian church they would have had this letter of Paul they would have read it service after service the preachers would have read it and then preached on it you know let's go back over this Paul the prophet told us this let's preach a little bit more on this let's preach let's preach about the love of God let's preach about the godhead let's preach about the cross amen see they would take inspiration from the letter the word of God and the spirit would then give them further inspiration to inspire the Saints to more faithful service praise God because that's who Paul was writing to faithful not Unfaithful Paul's writing to the faithful Saints Hallelujah now notice the whom or the one person of the godhead he didn't say in they notice he did he's he didn't say in they I read uh was I want to read today Psalm uh or no Isaiah 42 and God said over again he said there's no other God beside me if there's any other God I don't know him I stretch out the heavens by myself there's no God with me there's no other one I formed Israel I formed you out of my love is oh it's always one person I'm the Holy One of Israel there's no God beside me and Paul says the same thing not in they not in three persons in one person in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge how many people desire the wisdom of God with the wisdom of God you can recognize the mother Harlot revelation 17. that's super important when you recognize her you don't join her you don't partake of her sins right wisdom also governs all the other gifts praise God but wisdom also is called the Bible says the principal thing brother William and I were talking about this on Thanksgiving night it's better that I don't play games because I I don't the worst parts of me come out when I play games I'm too competitive so my wife can tell you all about after service I just really like to win it if I don't win sometimes I get a little bit uh mad [Laughter] the right word so it's better I just talk about the Lord you know I gotta stay away from my flesh the uh weaknesses but it's wisdom we were looking at the Book of Proverbs and the Bible said I wisdom dwell with prudence and I wisdom dwelt with the father before the foundation of the world and I was daily his Delight remember that in Proverbs chapter 8 wisdom was God's daily life so wisdom is pictured as the Holy Spirit the logos before the foundation of the world praise God and Paul says if you love each other he said I've got a great I've been fighting for you that you love each other and you would have be certain of your faith and then he says in God in the godhead are he had all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge wisdom is the principal thing you need on this Earth praise God it's not really finances it's not hitting the lottery of course we wouldn't play the lottery but it's not hitting the lottery that's not the principal thing in this life in America that's what people think but the principal thing is having wisdom about what to do and how to do it when to do it as well wisdom of God is the right decision making they some people call it sound advice but wisdom is what to do and how to do it now I think I think it's again let's just take this thought as we close here I'll try to close here I got uh six minutes till my hour here hard to believe that uh but the Bible said all the wisdom is hid in the godhead it's hidden there so see we see notice this means trinitarians lack Treasures of wisdom and knowledge we also know that they lack love too right because they're not born again they don't have the baptism Holy Ghost their hearts aren't knitted together in love right like I've seen different uh denominational people if the pastor says one thing they don't like they leave that denomination go to the other denomination that happened at our church when I was being when I was raised you see it all you see in the message you see the message they say one thing against your pet doctor one thing contrary to what you think they're out that's a denominational Spirit where's the love of God and all that now of course there are reasons to leave churches no doubt about that I've preached those fully I think uh the doctrines of devils those are reasons to leave churches no doubt about that because it's 11. but just noticed I would want you to be encouraged and be happy today about the love of God that we have amen because trinitarians have the wrong understanding of God therefore and that they're lacking the love of God they're not certain of where they stand they're not sure of the raptures before the tribulation during after they don't even know if there is a Rapture they might think the Rapture already happened they might think we're already living and then there's no Millennium there's none of that you know Catholic Church doesn't believe in the Millennium they're living in their Millennium this is their Satan's Millennium so brother Adam said they're living in Satan's Millennium right now but see it's because they don't have the love of God they have it I'll say like this they haven't searched for it like they ought to have praise God amen didn't the Bible say in Jeremiah 29 he said when you search for me with all your heart you'll find me how many believe that so we've got to search the treasures of God our head deep deep in the ground the treasures of God are not always obvious and apparent they're not just laying out on the surface level of Our Lives we're not really going to find the treasures of God while we're shopping at Lowe's like I was doing a couple times this weekend now God could speak to you there no doubt but the illustration Paul gives is the the treasures of God are hidden and we have to go look for them and find them and as long as we're in the love of God we're gonna find them and though it's certain that we'll we we know our destination we know where we're going we know the word of God we know the destination we know of the future it's certain if we keep the love of God we'll be able to find all the hidden wisdom of God and it's in Christ the word Hallelujah treasure amen all wisdom all knowledge praise God go to Proverbs here uh chapter 3 I believe it is this is just coming off my memory here as I'm trying to close I'm sorry chapter two Proverbs two I was one chapter away forgive me now look at verse one Proverbs two verse 1. now here's my instruction to maokai and uh Zion so lucky lucky for them they're my sons but you know Solomon wrote this letter for his sons how many times I preached this when William first came I preached this whole book of proverbs hit the highlights of it he wrote this for his sons my son Malachi thou will receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee where's Heinz he's sleeping yeah he gets a pass today so that thou incline thine heart unto wisdom see you have to Humble your heart if you want the wisdom of God it's not found by pridefully living your life however you want you must find it by humility and apply thine heart to understanding that means you got to work with understand you got to apply yourself in it you got to spend time you've got to devote time to finding the understanding of God and notice isn't this something this the wisest man there ever was is telling his son spend time with God he built all I mean he built the temple I'm going to preach on that eventually seven years ago the temple the most beautiful building the world ever had ever has ever seen until the New Jerusalem praise God but he had done all these natural things but he tells his son stay in the word of God Search the word of God humble your heart and and find some of these treasures and the church said what treasure are you going after what treasure are you and I seeking the father tells his son the wisest father there ever was until he got backslidden the wisest father ever was says son apply your heart verse three yea If thy if thou Christ after knowledge what God expects you to cry out yes now a lot of you raise your hands a few moments ago and I said who wants who wants wisdom how do you raise your hands and I said how many willing to cry for it now that's a different story that's why I usually cry at church cry in your car cry at your house cry after it see the the treasures are hidden in God but you got to cry out to God God wants to know that you really want to praise God it's a free gift but in order to appreciate a gift you sometimes got to pay the price for the gift amen you got to appreciate it you can't be selfish right you can't be loose with it you got to appreciate it praise God if you cry after knowledge and lift up thy voice for understanding look it even says sometimes in prayer you've got to raise your voice in prayer or it could be in a song Church how many songs talk about oh the Lord is my shepherd you know that's a song cry out to God I have all I want the Lord's my shepherd I shall not lack that's how we should sing it maybe we'll sing it afterwards brother that should be I wish we should sing it Lord I don't want to lack wisdom pour out your wisdom give me understanding praise God the wisest man ever tells his sons you got to lift your voice up when you pray so let me tell Malakai publicly you got to pray louder buddy now do I have scripture to back that up yes do I wish my dad would have told me that yes actually he did when I got older but he said I'd go in the closet and pray so I appreciate my dad for telling me that but the wisest man Solomon told his son you have to apply your heart to it you got to lift up your voice for it ain't gonna come easy all the time that's the Manna every day that was sanctification that was just given to him like a they were babies right but when they become mature they got to go work for it I think it's beautiful language Paul uses here all the treasures of God are hidden in Christ Jesus verse four here's where we're going if thou seek is her as silver and searches for her as for hid Treasures head there's that word hand ever see the word head what in whom are HID all hid they're hidden the scriptures they're hid in those quiet times with God Hallelujah I'll share our good testimony you know this summer I I said something you know uh to one of the Saints I'll just say Austin he's probably watching you I said something to Austin and it I kind of took him off guard and I appreciated one thing about him he went he was at work he went in the in the bathroom and prayed unto God until he got the answer I thought that was a good he had to go hide away and find the answer was what brother Jesse was saying was it the truth or not and so I want to appreciate that about our brother he had to go pray and the Holy Spirit revealed to him that's right it wasn't easy to hear was it you know it wasn't maybe fun to hear but there's truth sometimes that we say right there's truth God's speaking through us and church it's a good thing if we go pray about it like that's what the devil doesn't want us to do go pray about something right go pray about your knee go pray about the question in your life I just wants you to quickly make a hasty decision but God's not always in Hasty God's in in waiting on the Lord amen renewing strength praise God confidence God is in God wants you to have confidence about your salvation praise God he wants you confident about the decisions of your life so if you seek as for hid Treasures then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding so look let's listen church can you catch us sometimes you're not going to hear God's voice unless you lift up your voice if we're quiet all the time which I don't I'm not saying nothing there's nothing against quiet but you still know that I'm God right I mean there's time for quiet but if we don't make sometimes an effort to lift our voice and pray we're not going to hear the voice of God in other words we've got to pray until we gotta call out to God until God gives it why doesn't this happen God why why what about this why do they do that what why is this happening keep calling out to God and the Bible said if you lift your voice give me wisdom help me to understand this how should I act in this situation the Bible said if you cry out to God you'll hear the voice of God speak back and that's where you find all your Treasures I already passed my hour so sorry about that I'll end with verse three this is my last one here last last I could have went to some other ones you know some of the other verses church are like second Corinthians the Bible said we have Treasures in Earthen vessel but hey man it's your birthday buddy this is the Earthen vessel this this body God give you but the Treasures of the Holy Spirit are inside this Earthen vessel I see it every time I see you buddy I see the treasures of God the love of God the Devotion to God the joy to sing to God that's a treasure a lot of people don't have that most people don't because most people are lost few therapy that find the narrow road that's right we see these church we got to make sure don't become common to us that we see the treasures of God in our lives we have The Treasure of God in Earthen vessels and so by God's grace we have wisdom today we have wisdom for the gifts of the Spirit right we don't have the wrong evidence of the spirit we don't always believe God's always going to heal every time see we have wisdom to understand these things the will of God must be sought we have wisdom for our daily living right it wouldn't be wise for me to do this because then this is going to happen or this will that that wouldn't be wise for you to make that decision marriages would it would be wise to marry this one and not that one RB wise to be in this relationship but not with that friend wisdom but all these answers are HID in Jesus Christ and you have to take some time searching it out take some time lifting up your voice Church attendance finances jobs your words have us Lord what should I say how can I how can I get in a good habit of doing you know serving the lord how can I get a good good Ministry how can I how can I do that how can I handle my finances the wisdom of God will give you the right leading but all of that wisdom is hid in the Eternal one and it takes someone who will seek God my son you must apply your heart to wisdom and I'll just say like this my friends my congregation I'm your pastor you're my congregation apply let's apply our hearts to wisdom let us lift up our voices for wisdom let us seek for wisdom the Bible said as you'd seek treasure how does it start it starts with loving each other then you get the the wealth right and then you move here to this verse here then you understand God and then in God are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge that you could possibly desire how many grateful for all those wisdom all the treasure and knowledge of god let's stand to our feet musicians can come any treasure you seek today any treasure you desire today it's hidden in Jesus Christ and church let's be willing to go deeper in our walk with the Lord that's a good message for communion I didn't I really didn't know I was going to turn out it's a good message for communion everybody enjoy the word of God today amen my son my church if thou will receive my words from the Bible and hide God's Commandments with thee if you'll incline your heart unto wisdom and apply your heart to understanding if you cry after knowledge if you lift up your voice for understanding if you seek wisdom as for silver and search for her as for hid Treasures then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord Hallelujah what a beautiful scripture and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding let's bow our heads Here For a Moment by God's grace [Music] [Music] you know as a pastor I've been so thankful you know we've got so many people come to our church they say they feel the love of God they love the worship they love the preaching the singing and I believe God has knit our hearts together but of course we know the enemy is going to try to battle us in our minds well the ram said Satan won't let you stay that loving group of church he said he'll either anoint somebody in the church or send somebody in seen that over the years I believe this sermon especially with these scriptures from Colossians Proverbs are great reminders that we continue to love one another and for every question in our life church let's see let's seek for Christ's answers let's seek for it like in Treasures the answer is head in Christ every treasure every desire of your heart is in Christ the word today let's have a word of prayer
